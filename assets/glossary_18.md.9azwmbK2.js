Other nearby settlements in North Lanarkshire are Stepps to the south and Chryston to the south-east, each approximately away across farmland and on the opposite side of the M80 motorway; the City of Glasgow boundary and the suburb of Robroyston is about the same distance to the west. In previous years Auchinloch was in the Parish of Cadder and, from 1975 until 1996, the district of Strathkelvin within Strathclyde Region. The village's name - \\"Field of the Loch\\" - derives from its proximity to a small loch called the Gadloch. The area was sometimes known as the Loch Lands. History The etymology of the name is ‚ÄòField of the loch‚Äô (achadh an locha). Several old documents show Auchinloch with various spellings including maps by Timothy Pont, Charles Ross, and William Roy. There is some evidence that the religious revivals of the 18th century touched the village. The housing used to consist mainly of two parallel rows of single- storied weavers' cottages. One gazetteer, Samuel Lewis, describes coal being hardly worth digging with some limestone quarrying with a works established at Garnkirk. He quotes 138 inhabitants. Around the year 1860 there were 126 inhabitants. There was also a convalescent home at Auchinloch; in 1864 it had 64 places for residents. Industrialisation came in the 1880s, with the opening of the Lumloch colliery, and then in the 1920s Wester Auchengeich Colliery near Moodiesburn. The latter closed in 1968. Outside modern Auchinloch near Auchinleck Farm is the Wallace Well, sited almost exactly on the boundary between Glasgow and North Lanarkshire. This used to be called Auchinloch Well, was common to all farmers, and is mentioned in the New Statistical Account. The Village Auchinloch newsagents Auchinloch and Gadloch from the air, with Lenzie beyond Auchinloch Primary School Blaeu's Map (1654) showing the area around Auchinloch eastwards of Glasgow The newer western part of the village (sometimes known as 'Wester Auchinloch', while the older part at Stepps Road is prefixed with 'Easter') includes Auchinloch Primary School. The present building dates to the 1930s, whilst the original 19th century building still remains to the east and now serves as the village hall/community centre. Auchinloch Community Centre lies at the top of the village near the local pub, the Golden Pheasant, which is located on Stepps Road. The pub has been bought over by a new owner and following extensive refurbishment is now a thriving hub for food and drinks. A grocery shop is located in the village where in December 1999 the local shopkeeper was murdered. There is also a Bowling Green in the village and Cardyke Farm Shelter, a branch of the Cats Protection Society, a short distance to the west. The village is in the catchment area for Lenzie Academy.

Self-regulation may ease compliance and ownership of standards, but it can also give rise to conflicts of interest. If any organization, such as a corporation or government bureaucracy, is asked to eliminate unethical behavior within their own group, it may be in their interest in the short run to eliminate the appearance of unethical behavior, rather than the behavior itself, by keeping any ethical breaches hidden, instead of exposing and correcting them. An exception occurs when the ethical breach is already known by the public. In that case, it could be in the group's interest to end the ethical problem to which the public has knowledge, but keep remaining breaches hidden. Another exception would occur in industry sectors with varied membership, such as international brands together with small and medium size companies where the brand owners would have an interest to protect the joint sector reputation by issuing together self-regulation so as to avoid smaller companies with less resources causing damage out of ignorance. Similarly, the reliability of a professional group such as lawyers and journalists could make ethical rules work satisfactorily as a self-regulation if they were a pre- condition for adherence of new members. Advantages and disadvantages An organization can maintain control over the standards to which they are held by successfully self-regulating. If they can keep the public from becoming aware of their internal problems, this also serves in place of a public relations campaign to repair such damage. The cost of setting up an external enforcement mechanism is avoided. If the self-regulation can avoid reputational damage and related risks to all actors in the industry, this would be a powerful incentive for a pro-active self-regulation [without the necessity to assume it is to hide something]. Self-regulating attempts may well fail, due to the inherent conflict of interest in asking any organization to police itself. If the public becomes aware of this failure, an external, independent organization is often given the duty of policing them, sometimes with highly punitive measures taken against the organization. The results can be disastrous, such as a military with no external, independent oversight, which may commit human rights violations against the public. Not all businesses will voluntarily meet best practice standards, leaving some users exposed. Governments may prefer to allow an industry to regulate itself but maintain a watching brief over the effectiveness of self-regulation and be willing to introduce external regulation if necessary. For example, in the UK, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee in 2015 investigated the role of large accountancy firms in relation to tax avoidance and argued that \\"Government needs to take a more active role in regulating the tax industry, as it evidently cannot be trusted to regulate itself\\".House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, Tax avoidance: the role of large accountancy firms (follow-up): Summary, published 6 February 2015, accessed 9 January 2019  Organizations When directly self-regulating, the organization directly monitors and punishes its own members. For example, many small organizations have the ability to remove any member by a vote of all members. Another common form is where the organization establishes an external policing organization. This organization is established, and controlled by, the parent organization, so cannot be considered independent, however. In another form, the organization sets up a committee or division for policing the remainder of the organization. The House Ethics Committee is an example in the United States government, while various police departments employ an Internal Affairs division to perform a similar function. *American Bar Association (ABA) formulates model ethical codes related to the legal profession. The ABA has 410,000 members. * Every state bar association in the U.S. is a self-policing organization. * The American Advertising Federation (AAF), the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA), the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), and the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) together work with the National Advertising Division (NAD) to establish and enforce guidance related to truth in advertising for national advertising. * The Direct Selling Association (DSA) works with the third-party Direct Selling Self-Regulatory Council (DSSRC) to establish and enforce guidance related to the direct- selling industry. *Canadian Disc Jockey Association Within organizations Self-regulation is the process whereby an organization is asked, or volunteers, to monitor its own adherence to legal, ethical, or safety standards, rather than have an outside, independent agency such as a governmental entity monitor and enforce those standards. Self-regulation can have an effect on specifying existing guidelines or laws in certain contexts, foremost in the context of specific technical fields such as environmental protection, biotechnology, but also for the field of business and trade.W. Norman, Business Ethics as Self-Regulation: Why Principles that Ground Regulations Should Be Used to Ground Beyond-Compliance Norms as Well, J Bus Ethics, DOI 10.1007/s10551-011-1193-2.

The Bones of the Moon of the title are five bones that give power over the dream world in which Cullen James spends her time.

By night, in dreams, she begins to visit a strange land called Rondua, where the sea is full of fish with mysterious names, where she and a huge, behatted dog escort a young boy named Pepsi across places such as the Northern Stroke, the Mountains of Coin and Brick, the Plain of Forgotten Machines. As her days become more disjointed and episodic, her dreams grow in intensity, and she learns more about the adversary she and her dream friends race against, searching for the last of the Bones of the Moon.

It was the all-coach supplemental train of the all-Pullman Capitol Limited. It operated from 1931 to 1964. The train's initial route was between Jersey City, New Jersey and Washington, D.C., but in 1941 the Columbian route was lengthened to Jersey Illinois. It was the first air-conditioned train in the United States.  History  The Columbian between Jersey City and Washington was the first air-conditioned passenger train in North America. Air-conditioned equipment began operating on the train on May 24, 1931.Harry Stegmaier, Baltimore & Ohio Passenger Service, Vol. 2 - Route of the Capitol Limited. Lynchburg, Va.: TLC Publishing, 1997 (). IN 1937 the B&O; re-equipped the Columbian with cars from the Royal Blue. On December 19, 1941 the B&O; extended the Columbian from Washington to Chicago. To support the longer service the Columbian again received cast-offs from the Royal Blue, plus other equipment. The Columbian operated in tandem with the all-Pullman Capitol Limited, running thirty minutes behind. The Capitol Limited conveyed the Columbians coaches between Jersey City and Washington. During World War II the Columbian's consist swelled to 14 cars. In 1949, a brand new lightweight Columbian train set for travel between Baltimore, Maryland, via Washington to Chicago was built. The consists were ordered from Pullman-Standard for April, 1949 delivery and these two train sets have the distinction of being the only all-new consists built for the B&O; in the postwar period. These two eight-car streamlined trains were the first trains in the eastern U.S. to be equipped with dome cars, the \\"Strata-Dome\\". Although the pair were intended as a daytime operation between Chicago and Baltimore by way of Washington the two new trains entered overnight service May 5, 1949. In the 1950s saw a wave of consolidations as the B&O;'s passenger services contracted. The Columbian and Ambassador (which served Detroit, Michigan) began joint operation between Washington and Willard, Ohio on January 10, 1954. On December 1, 1957, the Columbian's dining car stopped operating west of Willard. On April 26, 1958, the B&O; discontinued all passenger service between Jersey City and Baltimore, Maryland, and thereafter the eastern terminus of the Columbian was Baltimore. At the same time the Columbian and Capitol Limited began joint operation between Washington and Baltimore. On October 26, 1958, this joint operation extended all the way to Willard, ending the independence of both trains. The B&O; dropped the Columbian name altogether on April 26, 1964. When Amtrak took over train service on May 1, 1971, the B&O;'s combined Capitol Limited - Columbian was discontinued, along with all other B&O; long-distance passenger trains.  Equipment  CBS Radio vocalist Harriet Lee aboard the new Columbian in June 1931 In December 1937 the Columbian received equipment originally rebuilt in 1935 for the Royal Blue. These were heavyweight cars given a streamlined appearance. The consist included a baggage-coach, three coaches, a coach-buffet, diner-lunch car, a parlor car which included a drawing room, and a buffet-observation car. The December 1941 re-equipping for long-distance service again involved refurbished Royal Blue equipment, although with long-distance-specific changes such as reducing the number of seats in the coaches. Each consist included a baggage-dormitory-buffet lounge, three coaches (each seating 45), a 46-seat coach with a stewardess' room, a dining car (room for 47), and a buffet-observation car. The B&O; removed the buffet-observation cars in 1943. Diesel locomotives began handling the Columbian in 1945. Pullman-Standard constructed two lightweight consists for the 1949 iteration of the Columbian. Each consist included a baggage- dormitory-coffee shop, four coaches, Strata-Dome dome coach, dining car, and tavern-observation car. Each coach could seat 56; the dining car had seating space for 36.

He was a governor of the London School of Economics (1997‚Äì2002) and chaired his own charitable trust, the Robert Gavron Charitable Trust (1974‚Äì2015). He was in 1996 elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Politics Gavron was active in the Labour Party and a financial contributor to the Labour Leader's Office Fund, run by Lord Levy, which financed Tony Blair's private office before the 1997 General Election. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1990 Birthday Honours, and received a life peerage as Baron Gavron, of Highgate in the London Borough of Camden, on 6 August 1999. Gavron served on House of Lords, UK Parliament, Works of Art Committee from 1999 to 2003 and 2005 ‚Äì 2009. Gavron was a member of the Groucho and the MCC. Personal life Gavron was married three times. In 1955, he married Hannah Fyvel, the daughter of T. R. Fyvel who was literary editor of Tribune and The Jewish Chronicle. They had two sons before she took her own life in 1965. One son, Jeremy Gavron, a novelist, has written a book about the tragedy. In 1967, Gavron married Felicia Nicolette Coates, who later became a Labour member of the London Assembly, and is now known as Nicky Gavron. Before they divorced in 1987, the couple had two daughters including the film director Sarah Gavron. In 1989, Gavron married Katherine Gardiner (n√©e Macnair). An MCC member, Gavron was a great supporter of cricket, especially in Barbados where he was an honorary life member of the Barbados Cricket Association. He established the Lord Gavron Scholarship for promising young cricketers in 2001. Recipients are presented with a trophy, a computer, cricket equipment and an attachment to a cricket club overseas or the opportunity to study at a local institution. Since 2010 two players, usually winners of the award, have spent a season with Sefton Park and Wavertree cricket clubs in England. Winners of the award who have gone on to play Test cricket for the West Indies include Kemar Roach, Kraigg Brathwaite, Jason Holder, Jomel Warrican, Shane Dowrich and Shai Hope. Gavron survived cancer and heart surgery. Gavron died of a heart attack on 7 February 2015 after playing tennis.

Eurimages promotes independent filmmaking by providing financial support to feature-length fiction, animation and documentary films. In doing so, it encourages co-operation between professionals established in different countries. Eurimages is located in Strasbourg, France. The Eurimages offices are in the Agora building of the Council of Europe. The current chairman is Catherine Trautmann. Purpose The fund was created in 1988 within the framework of the Council of Europe, as a Partial Agreement, under Committee of Ministers Resolution (88) 15, with an independent budget of 21M ‚Ç¨. It currently (as of October 2019) numbers 38 of the 47 member states of the Strasbourg-based organisation plus Argentina and Canada as associate members. These member states are: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. Eurimages aims to promote the European film industry by encouraging the production and distribution of films and fostering co-operation between professionals. Eurimages has a clear cultural aim and is complementary to the Media programme of the European Union, which has an industrial goal. Eurimages has four support schemes: feature film co-production, the promotion of co- production, theatrical distribution (to be suspended as from the 2020 cycle in its current form) and exhibition. Eurimages promotes independent filmmaking through a number of collaboration agreements with various festivals and film markets and has also adopted a strategy to promote gender equality in the film industry. Eligibility The fund supports feature-length fiction, animation and documentary films of a minimum length of 70 minutes, intended for cinema release. A main condition of obtaining Eurimages support is that the project is an international co-production between at least two independent producers, established in different member states of the Fund, of which at least one is a member state of the Council of Europe. Co-producers from non-member states of the Fund may participate in the project provided that their combined co- production percentage does not exceed 30% of the total co-prouction budget. Other conditions of eligibility for projects applying for Eurimages support are: *Every co-producer has to have at least 50% of financing in place, at the moment of the application *The project has to have the support of either a film fund, a distributor or a television presale (Eurimages cannot be the first fund which supports the project) *Deferrals and in-kind contribution shall be accepted as confirmed sources of financing only up to a maximum of 15% of the total co-production budget *The principal photography should not have been started before the meeting of the Eurimages Board of Management. However and for duly justified reason, shooting/animation has already started, the project is still considered eligible if no more than half of the total shooting/animation (80% for documentaries) has taken place before the examination of the application by the Board of Management. In order to receive Eurimages support, projects must comply with the legislation if the countries concerned, the bilateral treaties in force between the co-producing countries or, where applicable, with the European Convention on Cinematographic Coproduction or Council of Europe Convention on Cinematographic Co-production (revised). Eurimages provides a conditionally reimbursable interest-free loan. Financial support shall not exceed 17% (25% for documentaries) of the total production cost of the film and shall in no event be superior to ‚Ç¨500,000. The loan is reimbursed from the first ‚Ç¨ of each co-producer‚Äôs net receipts - at the rate of the percentage of Eurimages support.

It prefers the woods, but can also live in fields and cities. The common opossum is sometimes used by humans for food. Habitat and shelter This opossum is found in tropical and subtropical forest, both primary and secondary, at altitudes up to 2200 m. They use a wide range of nest sites. Most commonly they will create one in the hollow of a tree; however, they will also dig a burrow or nest in any dark location if nothing else is suitable (which often gets them in trouble with humans). Description Skeleton, Natural History Museum of Genoa The common opossum is similar in size to a house cat. The fur of the opossum is actually yellow in the under-fur, but is hidden by the longer black guard-hairs that cover it, while the tail, fingers, and face are lighter \\"with the tail being without fur, somewhat similar to a giant rat tail.\\" It can measure nearly 20 inches long. It has large ears that are usually black, and its face is usually a pale peach in color, with black whiskers and eyes that reflect reddish in light. With a body length of nearly a foot, and a tail that can reach almost two feet, the common opossum is one of the larger members of its family. An adult can weigh more than three pounds. Behavior Their activity is mainly nocturnal and terrestrial, with some arboreal exploration and nesting. Outside of mating, they are usually solitary. They are considered pests due to their somewhat raccoon-like behavior. Raiding trash cans, nesting in locations that are not suitable, and causing mayhem if encountered within a human living space, they are often trapped and killed. The common opossum is a host of the acanthocephalan intestinal parasite Gigantorhynchus lutzi. Diet Common opossums have a broad ability to adapt to environmental changes, and their teeth allow them to eat many different types of food, which is obtained mostly on the ground. They can eat small insects, small animals, fruits, vegetables, and also carrion. Their ability to digest almost anything edible gives them a broader range than a human. Reproduction The female will have 5-9 offspring between one and three times per year after maturity. The mother raises the young by herself. Lifespan The common opossum lives for around 2.5 years. Classification They are members of the genus Didelphis, which contains the largest American opossums, and the order Didelphimorphia, to which all Western hemisphere opossums belong.

Schreiber (born 6 February 1956) is a scientist at Harvard University and co-Founder of the Broad Institute. He has been active in chemical biology, especially the use of small molecules as probes of biology and medicine. Small molecules are the molecules of life most associated with dynamic information flow; these work in concert with the macromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins) that are the basis for inherited information flow. Education and training Schreiber obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from the University of Virginia in 1977, after which he entered Harvard University as a graduate student in Chemistry. He joined the research group of Robert B. Woodward and after Woodward's death continued his studies under the supervision of Yoshito Kishi. In 1980, he joined the faculty of Yale University as an assistant professor in Chemistry, and in 1988 he moved to Harvard University as the Morris Loeb Professor. Work in 1980s and 1990s Schreiber started his research work in organic synthesis, focusing on concepts such as the use of [2 + 2] photocycloadditions to establish stereochemistry in complex molecules, the fragmentation of hydroperoxides to produce macrolides, ancillary stereocontrol, group selectivity and two-directional synthesis. Notable accomplishments include the total syntheses of complex natural products such as talaromycin B, asteltoxin, avenaciolide, gloeosporone, hikizimicin, mycoticin A, epoxydictymene and the immunosuppressant FK-506. Following his work on the FK506-binding protein FKBP12 in 1988, Schreiber reported that the small molecules FK506 and cyclosporin inhibit the activity of the phosphatase calcineurin by forming the ternary complexes FKBP12-FK506-calcineurin and cyclophilin-ciclosporin-calcineurin. This work, together with work by Gerald Crabtree at Stanford University concerning the NFAT proteins, led to the elucidation of the calcium-calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway. The Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway was not elucidated for another year. In 1993, Schreiber and Crabtree developed \\"small-molecule dimerizers\\", which provide small-molecule activation over numerous signaling molecules and pathways (e.g., the Fas, insulin, TGFŒ≤ and T-cell receptors) through proximity effects. Schreiber and Crabtree demonstrated that small molecules could activate a signaling pathway in an animal with temporal and spatial control.\\"Functional Analysis of Fas Signaling in vivo Using Synthetic Dimerizers\\" David Spencer, Pete Belshaw, Lei Chen, Steffan Ho, Filippo Randazzo, Gerald R. Crabtree, Stuart L. Schreiber Curr. Biol. 1996, 6, 839-848. Dimerizer kits have been distributed freely resulting in many peer- reviewed publications. Its promise in gene therapy has been highlighted by the ability of a small molecule to activate a small-molecule regulated EPO receptor and to induce erythropoiesis (Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), and more recently in human clinical trials for treatment of graft-vs-host disease. In 1994, Schreiber and co-workers investigated (independently with David Sabitini) the master regulator of nutrient sensing, mTOR. They found that the small molecule rapamycin simultaneously binds FKBP12 and mTOR (originally named FKBP12-rapamycin binding protein, FRAP). Using diversity-oriented synthesis and small-molecule screening, Schreiber illuminate the nutrient- response signaling network involving TOR proteins in yeast and mTOR in mammalian cells. Small molecules such as uretupamine\\"Dissection of a glucose- sensitive pathway of the nutrient-response network using diversity-oriented synthesis and small molecule microarrays\\" Finny G. Kuruvilla, Alykhan F. Shamji, Scott M. Sternson, Paul J. Hergenrother, Stuart L. Schreiber, Nature, 2002, 416, 653-656. and rapamycin were shown to be particularly effective in revealing the ability of proteins such as mTOR, Tor1p, Tor2p, and Ure2p to receive multiple inputs and to process them appropriately towards multiple outputs (in analogy to multi-channel processors). Several pharmaceutical companies are now targeting the nutrient-signaling network for the treatment of several forms of cancer, including solid tumors. In 1995, Schreiber and co- workers found that the small molecule lactacystin binds and inhibits specific catalytic subunits of the proteasome, a protein complex responsible for the bulk of proteolysis in the cell, as well as proteolytic activation of certain protein substrates. As a non-peptidic proteasome inhibitor lactacysin has proven useful in the study of proteasome function. Lactacystin modifies the amino-terminal threonine of specific proteasome subunits. This work helped to establish the proteasome as a mechanistically novel class of protease: an amino-terminal threonine protease. The work led to the use of bortezomib to treat multiple myeloma. In 1996, Schreiber and co-workers used the small molecules trapoxin and depudecin to investigate the histone deacetylases (HDACs). Prior to Schreiber's work in this area, the HDAC proteins had not been isolated. Coincident with the HDAC work, David Allis and colleagues reported work on the histone acetyltransferases (HATs). These two contributions catalyzed much research in this area, eventually leading to the characterization of numerous histone-modifying enzymes, their resulting histone ‚Äúmarks‚Äù, and numerous proteins that bind to these marks. By taking a global approach to understanding chromatin function, Schreiber proposed a ‚Äúsignaling network model‚Äù of chromatin and compared it to an alternative view, the ‚Äúhistone code hypothesis‚Äù presented by Strahl and Allis. These studies shined a bright light on chromatin as a key gene expression regulatory element rather than simply a structural element used for DNA compaction. Chemical biology Schreiber applied small molecules to biology through the development of diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS),(a) (b) (c) chemical genetics,\\"The small-molecule approach to biology: Chemical genetics and diversity-oriented organic synthesis make possible the systematic exploration of biology‚Äù, S L Schreiber, C&E; News, 2003, 81, 51-61. and ChemBank. Schreiber has shown that DOS can produce small molecules distributed in defined ways in chemical space by virtue of their different skeletons and stereochemistry, and that it can provide chemical handles on products anticipating the need for follow-up chemistry using, for example, combinatorial synthesis and the so-called Build/Couple/Pair strategy of modular chemical synthesis. DOS pathways and new techniques for small-molecule screening \\"Printing Small Molecules as Microarrays and Detecting Protein-Ligand Interactions en Masse\\" Gavin MacBeath, Angela N. Koehler, Stuart L. Schreiber J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 7967-7968. provided many new, potentially disruptive insights into biology. Small-molecule probes of histone and tubulin deacetylases, transcription factors, cytoplasmic anchoring proteins, developmental signaling proteins (e.g., histacin, tubacin, haptamide, uretupamine, concentramide, and calmodulophilin), among many others, have been uncovered in the Schreiber lab using diversity-oriented synthesis and chemical genetics. Multidimensional screening was introduced in 2002 and has provided insights into tumorigenesis, cell polarity, and chemical space, among others. Schreiber also contributed to more conventional small molecule discovery projects. He collaborated with Tim Mitchison to discover monastrol ‚Äì the first small-molecule inhibitor of mitosis that does not target tubulin. Monastrol was shown to inhibit kinesin-5, a motor protein and was used to gain new insights into the functions of kinesin-5. This work led pharmaceutical company Merck, among others, to pursue anti-cancer drugs that target human kinesin-5. Schreiber has used small molecules to study three specific areas of biology, and then through the more general application of small molecules in biomedical research. Academic screening centers have been created that emulate the Harvard Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology and the Broad Institute; in the U.S., there has been a nationwide effort to expand this capability via the government-sponsored NIH Road Map. Chemistry departments have changed their names to include the term chemical biology and new journals have been introduced (Cell Chemical Biology, ChemBioChem, Nature Chemical Biology, ACS Chemical Biology]) to cover the field. Schreiber has been involved in the founding of numerous biopharmaceutical companies whose research relies on chemical biology: Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX), Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ARIA), Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc (INFI), Forma Therapeutics, H3 Biomedicine and Jnana Therapeutics. These companies have produced new therapeutics in several disease areas, including cystic fibrosis and cancer.  Other research  Schreiber has collaborated with the pharmaceutical company Eisai. Other work focused on targeting the cancer therapy-resistant states.

It dates back to 1277, taking its name from Sultan al-Zahir Baybars (1223‚Äì1277) who is buried here.  The funerary complex of al-Zahir Baybars  Baybars.  Background: Sultan al- Zahir Baybars  Sultan Al-Zahir Baybars, also known as Rukn Uddin Baybrus (full name: al-Malik al-Zahir Rukn al-Din Baibars al-Bunduqdari) was a political and military leader of major historical importance. He played an important role in the establishment of a new mamluk-based regime in Cairo that would rule Egypt and Syria for a long period known as the Mamluk Sultanate (1250-1517). After playing a central role in repelling the Mongol advance at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 (often cited as a turning point in history) he rose to the position of sultan. During his reign, he undertook a series of effective campaigns against the remaining Crusader states in the Levant, conquering a number of important cities and fortresses such as Antioch and the famous Krak des Chevaliers, which paved the way for the later final demise of the Crusader presence in the region. Baybars died unexpectedly in July 1277 in his palace (called al-Qasr al-Ablaq) in Damascus after drinking a poisoned cup that was intended for someone else. His death was kept a secret and he was temporarily buried in the Citadel of Damascus while arrangements could be made for his permanent burial and for a transition of power to his 18-year-old son al-Sa'id Barakah. Baybars had reportedly expressed a desire to be buried near the town of Darayya, but his son judged that he should be buried in a more prestigious location near the great mosque and near the tombs of illustrious Ayyubid sultans, including the Mausoleum of Salah ad-Din. On al-Sa'id's orders, the governor of Damascus, emir Aydamur, purchased a house opposite the 'Adiliyya Madrasa, in the al-Amara neighbourhood near the Great Ummayyad Mosque. The house, called Dar al-'Aqiqi, had originally belonged to the father of Salah ad-Din (Saladin), and Salah ad-Din himself had spent part of his childhood there. It was remodeled into a madrasa and funerary complex. When al-Sa'id himself died in 1280, he was buried in the same mausoleum as his father.  The madrasa and mausoleum  Construction of the complex began in 1277 but did not finish until later. It was still unfinished when al-Sa'id died and was buried here in 1280, and the new sultan al-Mansur Qalawun was required to see to its completion. This may have been accomplished in 1281, with the mausoleum's decoration probably being the last element to be executed. The architect of the complex was Ibrahim ibn Ghana‚Äôim al-Muhandis, who was also responsible for building al-Qasr al-Ablaq, the palace of Baybars in Damascus, in 1264. Like many subsequent Mamluk foundations, the funerary complex of Baybars served multiple functions, which were outlined in its waqf (trust agreement for charitable foundations under Islamic law). It included two madrasas (teaching Islamic law), a Dar al-Hadith (school for teaching the sayings of the Prophet), and the sultan's mausoleum (called a turba). The complex included a monumental portal with a broad canopy of stone-carved muqarnas (honeycomb or stalactite-like forms) culminating in a shell-like hood, considered one of the most accomplished examples of its kind in Syria. The portal and exterior of the building also demonstrates alternating layers of dark and light stone, known as ablaq masonry. Today, the portal and the mausoleum are the best-preserved historical parts of the complex. The mausoleum is covered by a large dome and its interior is boldly decorated with marble paneling along its lower walls (dadoes) and a large frieze of glass mosaics along its upper walls. The mosaics are reminiscent of the more famous ones found in the Ummayyad Mosque nearby, illustrating scenes of trees and palaces. However, their craftsmanship is of somewhat lesser quality, suggesting that this skill was in decline compared to earlier periods. The mihrab (a wall niche symbolizing the direction of prayer) also features an elaborate composition of marble mosaic paneling forming geometric and foliated patterns. The muqarnas portal (the earliest example of which is the Bimaristan of Nur al-Din), the marble dadoes, and (to a lesser extent) the mosaic friezes of the mausoleum were decorative elements that would recur throughout the Mamluk period after Baybars.

The Library  The madrasa had a library from the outset. Its first books were donated by the mother of al-Sa'id Barakah as part of the madrasa's endowment. It was only turned into a \\"general library\\" in 1876 or 1877 by Sheikh Tahir al-Jazari and Salim al-Bukhari, who collected thousands of items for the library. He was helped in part by the governor of Damascus, Midhat Pasha, who used an edict from the Ottoman sultan to collect books from around the region. The library was nationally recognized by the Syrian state and opened to the public in 1880 or 1881. It continued to consolidate collections throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century and became the National Library. It played a part in the Arabic literary renaissance that was ongoing in Syria in that period. In 1919 the \\"Arab Academy was charged with the supervision of the al-Zahiriyya Library. ‚Ä¶ Its collection consisted at that time of the surviving manuscripts from different small libraries in Syria. ‚Ä¶ The collection grew from 2,465 manuscripts to 22,000 volumes between 1919 and 1945.\\" In 1949 a legal deposit law decreed that two copies of every work published in Syria be deposited in the library. The law was not enforced until July 1983, when a presidential decree required the deposit of 5 copies of each work published by a Syrian author. In 1984 the Al-Assad Library became the Syrian national library, replacing al-Zahiriyah Library. The manuscript department includes over 13,000 classical Islamic manuscripts, the oldest being Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal‚Äôs Kitab al-zuhd and Kitab al-fada'il. Other notable manuscripts include Ta'rikh Dimashq by Ibn 'Asakir (1105‚Äì1175), al-Jam bayn al-gharibayn by Abu \`Ubaydah Ahmad ibn Muhammad Al-Harawi (d. 1010), and Gharib al-hadith by Ibn Qutaybah al-Dinawari (d. 889).Bibliography for Alternative Sources of Nahj al-Balagha As of 2011, the library's holdings included some 100,000 holdings, 13,000 manuscripts, and 50,000 periodicals.

He also studied in Antwerp under Flemish painter and draughtsman, Frans Floris.Frans Floris in Karel van Mander, Het Schilderboeck, 1604 Upon his return to Ghent, he established a school of painting. One of his students was Karel van Mander. In 1565, he married Eleonore Carboniers. He became a refugee from the Dutch Revolt against Philip II of Spain, who tried to suppress Protestantism. In 1568, De Heere went to France, where he was employed by Catherine de' Medici designing Gobelins tapestry.James, Ralph N., Painters and Their Works, L.U. Gill, 1896, p. 533.

It ascends the Helderberg Escarpment in the towns of Berne and New Scotland. Within the town of Bethlehem and the city of Albany, NY 443 is known as Delaware Avenue. NY 443 was originally designated as the Albany County portion of NY 43 in the 1920s, but the NY 43 designation was truncated to Rensselaer in the early 1970s. The portion of NY 43 west of Madison Avenue in Albany was then redesignated as NY 443\\\\. Many of the reference markers along NY 443 bear the number \\"43\\" instead. Route description NY 443 at the junction with NY 30 in Schoharie NY 443 begins at an intersection with NY 30 in the town of Schoharie, just north of the namesake village. NY 443 proceeds east along a tributary of Schoharie Creek, crossing through rural parts of Schoharie County as a two-lane roadway. The route begins to wind eastward as it enters the hamlet of Shutters Corners, bending southeast through the town of Wright. After leaving the residential hamlet of Shutters Corners, NY 443 continues creekside through Wright, entering the hamlet of Gallupville. In the residential community, NY 443 turns southward at a junction with the western terminus of NY 146. At the Factory Street intersection, NY 443 turns eastward through Gallupville, turning southeast once again at a junction with County Route 24 (CR 24; Knox Road). NY 443 and CR 24 parallel each other through Wright as they leave Gallupville, paralleling a nearby creek before it turns southeast along Fox Creek. After a long stretch along Fox Creek, NY 443 turns east at Freeman Hill Road, turning southeast again after Schell Road. A short distance southeast of Schell Road, NY 443 and Fox Creek cross the county line into Albany County. Now in the town of Knox. Now known as Helderberg Trail, NY 443 turns south into the hamlet of West Berne. In West Berne, the route turns east at a junction with CR 9 (Bradt Hollow Road). NY 443 at NY 146 in Gallupville Crossing east through West Berne, NY 443 continues along the creek, soon leaving West Berne for the town of Berne. The route crosses CR 1 (Switz Kill Road) and skirts the northern edge of Town of Berne Park. At the junction with the eastern terminus of CR 9 (Canaday Hill Road), NY 443 enters the hamlet of Berne, becoming the main commercial street, turning northward at a junction with Irish Hill Road. At the northern end of the north stretch, the route intersects with the western terminus of NY 156 (Berne-Altamont Road). NY 443 continues east along Helderberg Trail through Berne, soon turning southeast through the town. At the junction with Turner Road, the route bends southward, then turns eastward once again. Continuing east through Berne, NY 443 becomes a two-lane rural roadway, reaching the hamlet of East Berne. The route passes south of Warners Lake and intersects with Thacher Park Road (NY 910J) just south of that road's junction with NY 157A. Bending southeast out of East Berne, NY 443 passes south of a local airstrip, bending southeast through the rural community. At the junction with CR 303 (Pinnacle Road), NY 443 makes a short dart to the southeast and intersects with NY 85 (Delaware Turnpike). Dropping the Helderberg Trail moniker, NY 443 and NY 85 become concurrent along Delaware Turnpike, passing south of Helderberg Lake. NY 443 and NY 85 remain a two-lane residential road, crossing into the town of New Scotland. After passing the Letter S roads, NY 443 and NY 85 turn southeast, reaching a junction with New Scotland Road, where NY 85 turns eastward. NY 443 continues southward on Delaware Turnpike. Crossing through a wooded section of New Scotland, NY 443 soon bends southeast, reaching the northern terminus of CR 312 (Clarksville South Road). After a short distance east, through the residential neighborhood of New Scotland, intersecting with the western terminus of CR 301 (Tarrytown Road), which eventually becomes NY 396 in Bethlehem. Continuing east along Delaware Turnpike, NY 443 leaves the residential area, returning to the dense woods in New Scotland. NY 85 at the junction with NY 443 in the town of Berne Bending northeast through New Scotland, NY 443 crosses multiple residential roads that branch off, soon crossing into another residential area near the junction with CR 308 (New Scotland South Road). Entering the hamlet of Unionville, NY 443 crosses another junction with CR 308 (Feura Bush Unionville Road). NY 443 crosses under the Selkirk Subdivision of CSX Transportation, passing through the center of Unionville. The route bends northward and crosses into the town of Bethlehem, changing names to Delaware Avenue. Passing south of multiple housing residences, NY 443 passes an intersection with CR 52 (Elm Avenue / Cherry Avenue). After crossing CR 52, NY 443 continues northeast along Delaware Avenue, entering the hamlet of Delmar. Along this stretch, NY 443 is a long residential street, intersecting with the eastern terminus of NY 140 (Kenwood Avenue) in the center of Delmar. Reaching the hamlet of Elsmere, NY 443 intersects with the northern terminus of NY 335 (Elsmere Avenue). Near Euclid Avenue, the route begins to parallel the Normans Kill, crossing under the New York State Thruway (I-87) just east of the latter's exit 23\\\\. The route now enters the city of Albany, crossing through the Delaware Avenue section of the city. A commercial and residential street, NY 443 soon intersects with US 9W (Southern Boulevard). NY 443 and US 9W continue northeast along Delaware Avenue, running along the western edge of Lincoln Park, crossing into the Capitol Hill section of Albany. In this neighborhood, NY 443 and US 9W turn north into a junction with US 20 (Madison Avenue). At this intersection, US 9W runs north on Lark Street, while NY 443 terminates at this intersection and the right-of-way merges into Lark Street. History NY 443 roughly follows an 18th-century trail of the Mohawk Indians from the Hudson River to Schoharie Valley. It was probably a few years before 1787 when Stephen Van Rensselaer III had it upgraded and straightened slightly to make it accessible by wagons. Before that the settlers in the Beaver Dam as the Town of Berne is now known, had to go by way of the wagon road from Altamont, through what is now Knox, to the Schoharie Valley. In the mid-1920s, the entirety of modern NY 443 was designated as part of NY 43, a highway extending from NY 9 (now NY 7) in the hamlet of Central Bridge north of Schoharie to Albany. The 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York brought about a pair of changes in NY 43's alignment. On its western end, it was truncated to a junction with the newly created NY 30 just north of Schoharie. To the east, NY 43 was extended east through Albany and across the Hudson River to the Massachusetts state line. NY 43 was truncated on its western end in the early 1970s to Rensselaer, a city bordering Albany on the eastern bank of the Hudson River. Its former routing from Schoharie to Madison Avenue in Albany was redesignated as NY 443. Many of the reference markers along NY 443 still bear the number \\"43\\".

The team is owned by Frank Cicci of Elmira, New York and was last driven by Jay Sauter.  Beginnings  FCR first began racing as a short track team in Upstate New York. They won the Late Model division championship in 1985 at Shangri-La Speedway (later Tioga Motorsports Park before closing after 2005) That year, they made their NASCAR Busch Series debut at North Carolina Speedway, as the No. 67. Jimmy Spencer qualified 30th and finished 19th. They hired Spencer to race in NASCAR's National Modified Tour after that, and subsequently won the championship in that series in 1986 and 1987. During the 1987 season, Cicci and Spencer ran two more races in the Busch Series with Quick Stop Beverage sponsoring. They decided to run Busch full-time in 1988, the team being named Team 34 Racing. Despite not winning a race, Spencer had 13 top-ten finishes, and finished seventh in points that season. They began 1989 without major sponsorship, but Spencer was able to pick up his first career victory at Hickory Motor Speedway, then won two more races that season at Rougemount and Myrtle Beach. Suddenly, Cicci released Spencer to have Randy LaJoie drive the 34 for the rest of the season, who posted two top-ten finishes. Spencer returned to run a limited schedule in a second Cicci car, the Lowe's Foods No. 87 car, and had two top-ten finishes as well. He left for the Winston Cup Series at the end of the season.  Early 90s  In 1990, FCR hired Clifford Allison to drive the Gwaltney Meats Buick. Allison struggled, however, and was released after the seventh race of the season. Jack Sprague took over for the balance of the season, and had a sixth- place finish at Orange County. Still searching for competitiveness, Cicci teamed up with Jeffrey and Scott Welliver for 1991 and hired Todd Bodine to drive. Bodine rewarded them with a win at the Budweiser 200 and a seventh- place finish in points. The next season, armed with sponsor Hungry Jack, Bodine won three times and finished third in points. After switching to Chevrolets for 1993, Bodine won three more races but struggled with consistency, and finished 9th in points. He left for Butch Mock Motorsports at the end of the season. He was replaced by Mike McLaughlin, who had eight top- ten finishes in the Fiddle Faddle-sponsored car.  Prime years  In 1995, French's Mustard became primary sponsor, and McLaughlin picked up his first career win at Dover International Speedway, and finished third in points. After a winless 1996, McLaughlin chalked up two more wins in 1997, and was named the Series' most popular driver. During the 1997 season, the team expanded to a multi-car operation, fielding the No. 36 Stanley Tools Pontiac Grand Prix for Bodine. He won one race and finished runner-up in the championship chase. Goulds Pumps was the team's new sponsor in 1998, and together they won two more races and finished 3rd in points. Bodine had left for Team Tabasco at the end of the season, and rookie driver Matt Hutter took his place. Despite posting one top-ten finish, Hutter was replaced mid-season by David Green, who put together seven top-five finishes. A third car appeared for Cicci-Welliver in 1998 as well, the No. 30 Slim Jim Chevy driven by Mike Cope. Cope struggled with consistency as well, and would be replaced by Bodine for the balance of the season. The team changed its name to Cicci-Welliver Racing before the 1999 season. In 1999, Tim Fedewa took over the No. 36, and had 9 top-ten finishes and a 14th-place finish in points. Bodine continued driving the newly renumbered 66 Phillips Chevy and had ten top-fives. McLaughlin meanwhile decided he needed a change of scenery, and announced he was leaving the team for Innovative Motorsports, to the shock of the NASCAR community. David Green returned to take his place with AFG Glass as sponsor. He had eleven top-tens and a 9th in points. Fedewa picked up a win at New Hampshire, but failed to qualify twice and finished 18th in points. Bodine picked up one more victory and had a fourth-place finish in points.  Struggles and rebirth  In 2001, Bodine left for Haas-Carter Motorsports, and Fedewa took his place in the 66. Consequently, Stanley was replaced by GNC, and Hank Parker Jr. took over the driving duties for the No. 36. Green stayed in the No. 34 and had six top-tens, but was not happy with the results and left. Parker picked up his first career win and finished 15th in points. Fedewa struggled with his new ride however, and would be released midway through the season. Geoffrey Bodine took over for the rest of the season, his best finish being a fourth at Richmond. In 2002, the Wellivers pulled out of the team after a long association. Cicci sold the 36 and 66 teams to Wayne Jesel. Jimmy Spencer returned to the team as a partner, with the United States Air Force came aboard to sponsor the No. 34, which was to be driven by rookie Stuart Kirby on a part-time schedule. Kirby ran eight races, but did not finish higher than 17th, and he was replaced by Steve Grissom, who didn't fare any better than a 22nd-place run at Richmond. The next season, former National Football League quarterback Jim Kelly came on board as a partner to try to attract sponsors. They could only get LesCare Kitchens to run that season, on a part-time basis. McLaughlin returned after a prior deal had fallen through, and had one top-ten finish, but LesCare did not live up to their sponsorship obligations, causing Spencer to dissolve the partnership. The team shut down after that, but returned in 2005 with Dollar General sponsoring the car, driven by Randy LaJoie. LaJoie had three top-ten finishes, but was replaced by Todd Bodine on occasion, and finished 19th in points. For 2006, Champ Car World Series driver Paul Tracy took the wheel for 5 races with SportClips and American Crew. Other drivers that drove the car included Bodine, Scott Lynch, Carlos Pardo, Kertus Davis, Mike Bliss, Jason Keller, Jeff Fuller and Kim Crosby. For Frank Cicci Racing's 20th year in the Busch Series the team was set to run the full 2007 season with new driver Brian Conz, coming over from the ARCA RE/MAX Series, with Scottish Rite as the sponsor. After Steve Grissom drove at Daytona, it was reported that Cicci has placed Conz and his sponsor on notice for failing to pay its financial obligations. Jay Sauter was to drive the car for most of the 2007 season, but the team suspended operations in April. They attempted to run the Zippo 200 but could not come up with funds to do so.

Career A gifted vocalist, Carr recorded for King Records in the mid 1950s before being signed in 1958 by Roulette Records, where she remained until 1962. At Roulette, one of her 45 rpm recordings, \\"When The Boys Talk About The Girls\\", peaked on the 1958 Billboard chart at No. 19, and also reached the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart. The lack of further chart action in the UK gave Carr the tag there of being a one hit wonder. However, the b-side of the record was her version of \\"Padre\\" that had been released a short time before by Toni Arden and became a million-seller hit. \\"Padre\\" is a hauntingly beautiful ballad of love lost that demonstrated the purity of Carr's voice. At the time, many believed Carr's version to be superior, and it was rumored that radio listeners may have mistakenly bought the Arden version in error. In 1959, Carr put out two modestly successful LPs, Song Stylist Extraordinaire and Ev'ry Hour Ev'ry Day of My Life, the latter considered by some as her best work. In 1960, she recorded \\"Oh Gee\\"/\\"You Belong in Someone Else's Arms\\", the b-side written by Burt Bacharach and Bob Hilliard.

Oswaldo Frota-Pessoa was born in Rio de Janeiro, where he did all his studies, first in natural history at the Federal District University (currently the State University of Rio de Janeiro), graduating in 1938; and subsequently medicine at the National School of Medicine of University of Brazil, graduating in 1941. He got his doctoral degree at the same school, in 1953 and soon afterwards went abroad on a scholarship for post-doctoral studies at Columbia University, in New York City, from 1953 to 1955. His teaching and research professional career began in 1942, when he accepted a position of assistant professor at the School of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, a post he held until 1958. In that year he accepted a new position at the University of S√£o Paulo, moving to S√£o Paulo City, where he worked until his retirement. He attained a full professorship there in 1978 and was elected an emeritus professor in 1995. In 1964 and 1965 he was a Visiting Professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison on a Fulbright Program fellowship. As a scientific leader, Dr. Frota-Pessoa held many prominent positions, such as: specialist in Science Education of the Pan American Union (Organization of American States) in Washington, D.C. (1955‚Äì1956), consultant in Human Genetics for the World Health Organization (1961‚Äì1986), director of the Coordination Center of Brazil of the Multinational Program of Genetics of the Pan American Union (1968‚Äì1973), director of the Centro de Estudos sobre Curr√≠culo para o Ensino de Biologia (CECEB) from 1972 to 1979, president of the Brazilian Society of Genetics (1968‚Äì1970) and of the Latin American Association of Genetics (1969‚Äì1971), founding member of the Academy of Sciences of the State of S√£o Paulo (1974). He published more than 130 research papers on genetics and about 500 popularization articles. His main research interests were the systematics of Drosophila, the genetics of human populations, cytogenetics, medical genetics and genetic counseling, and genetics in psychiatry. Dr. Frota-Pessoa was always one of the most active and respected enthusiasts for the teaching of biology and the popularization of science and a promoter of public understanding of science. He actually taught science and biology in secondary schools of the public system of Rio de Janeiro from 1939 to 1958. Based on this experience, he wrote one of the first textbooks on biology for secondary education, which became a best-seller and was published in many editions. In all, he published 26 textbooks and 17 guides for science and biology teachers. For these efforts, he won the UNESCO Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science and the CNPq Jos√© Reis Award for the Divulgation of Science. He was also decorated by the Brazilian government with the Great Cross of the Brazilian Order of Scientific Merit and was awarded the 1989 Alfred Jurzikowyski Prize of the Brazilian Academy of Medicine, for relevant basic research for medicine.

Stickit minister is a colloquial idiom that connotes disgrace or dishonour. The Scottish Gaelic equivalent is ministear-maide. There are two possible origins: One is, as the Scottish Gaelic version maide implies, that the minister is \\"wooden\\" and stick like, or alternatively that it refers to hesitancy, or \\"sticking\\". (stickit is the Lowland Scots for stuck). John Jamieson quotes an example: \\"Puir lad! The first time he tried to preach, he stickit his sermon\\", and further glosses: \\"A speech is stickit when the speaker hesitates and is unable to proceed\\". The stickit minister was a recurring theme in Scottish literature during the 18th and 19th centuries; the most notable example is S. R. Crockett's short story \\"The Stickit Minister\\" (1893). A theme of this work is the humanity of Christianity. The stories offer examples of good ministerial behaviour and bad, and they theorise the role of faith in confronting hypocrisy, whether in others or in oneself.

It is a part of the wider field of Oriental studies. Iranian studies is broader than and distinct from Persian studies, which is the study of the modern Persian language and literature specifically. The discipline of Iranian Studies focuses on broad trends in culture, history, language and other aspects of not only Persians, but also a variety of other contemporary and historical Iranian peoples, such as Azeris, Kurds, Lurs, Gilakis, Talysh, Tajiks, Pashtuns, Ossetians, Baluchis, Scythians, Sarmatians, Alans, Parthians, Sogdians, Bactrians, Khwarazmians, Mazandaranis, etc.  Iranian Studies in pre-modern Iran  The medieval Iranian poet Ferdowsi, author of the Iranian national epic the ', can be considered the \\"founder\\" of Iranian studies in the sense that in his work he made a deliberate effort to highlight Persian culture prior to the Arab conquests. In this sense Ferdowsi's nationalistic approach can be contrasted with that of Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, the famous ninth-century Iranian historian whose History of the Prophets and Kings reflects a more specifically Islamic perspective. Ferdowsi's work follows earlier semi-historical works such as the lost Sasanian-era Khwaday-Namag. Persian historiography strictly speaking begins with the Tarikh-i Mas'udi of Abulfazl Bayhaqi (995-1077), whose fluent prose style was highly influential on subsequent Persian literature. Persian historical writing reached its peak two centuries later with the Jami al-Tawarikh of Rashƒ´d al-Dƒ´n Fadhl-allƒÅh HamadƒÅnƒ´ (1247‚Äì1318). Other important historical works include the Tarikh-i Jahangushay by Ata-Malik Juvayni and the Zafarnamah of Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, a history of the Mongolian conqueror Timur (Tamerlane; 1370‚Äì1405).  Iranian Studies in modern Iran  Among the most prominent scholars of Iranian Studies in Iran during the twentieth century may be counted Badiozzaman Forouzanfar, Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub, Zabihollah Safa, Mojtaba Minovi, Mohsen Abolqasemi, Ahmad Tafazzoli, Alireza Shapour Shahbazi,and Fereydoon Joneydi. The Loghat-nameh of Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda is the largest comprehensive Persian dictionary ever published, in 15 volumes (26, 000 pages).  Iranian Studies in Europe  European scholarly interest in Iranian language and civilization dates back to the late eighteenth century, with the emergence of comparative Indo-European linguistics and the translation of the Avesta by French scholar Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron. British interest in Persian was spurred by the fact that it was the administrative language of much of India; German scholars were attracted by the purported cultural links with Iran as a fellow \\"Aryan civilization\\". The major European scholarly organization devoted to Iranian Studies is the Societas Iranologica Europea. The London-based Iran Heritage Foundation supports Iranian studies at several universities and sponsors a wide range of public cultural events.

V. Williams Jackson (1862-1937), a scholar of Indo-Iranian languages who is known for producing a grammar of the Avestan language. During the 1950s Richard Frye developed Iranian Studies at Harvard. An Iranian Studies program was created at UCLA in 1963 in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures (NELC) that was established by Wolf Leslau a few years before, in 1959. The doctoral Program at UCLA (now the largest program in North America), was the home institution of Professor emeritus Hanns-Peter Schmidt who used to read Old Iranian and Old Indic (Indo-Iranistik), and is now led by M. Rahim Shayegan who also specializes in Ancient Iran. Other Universities where Iranian Studies are offered include the University of Chicago; Princeton University; Indiana University, Bloomington; and the University of Toronto. The Society for Iranian Studies (now the International Society for Iranian Studies) was founded by a group of Iranian graduate students in 1967 and began producing a journal, Iranian Studies. The field expanded considerably during the 1970s, with a number of Americans having served in the Peace Corps in Iran taking up academic positions. Close relations between Iran and the US facilitated the growth of academic programs as well as the Asia Institute in Shiraz and the American Institute of Iranian Studies. The 1979 revolution initially reversed this trend; American academic centers in Iran were closed and their assets seized. Over the past three decades, lack of funding and the difficulty of research travel to Iran have been major obstacles to scholars based in North America. Nevertheless, the field has seen some important achievements such as the monumental Encyclopedia Iranica project led by retired Columbia University professor Ehsan Yarshater. In recent years several new centers for Iranian Studies have been established, notably at the University of California-Irvine, which is the first and oldest center established in the UC system, and the University of Maryland.

Arendt is interested in the vita activa (active life) as contrasted with the vita contemplativa (contemplative life) and concerned that the debate over the relative status of the two has blinded us to important insights about the vita activa and the way in which it has changed since ancient times. She distinguishes three sorts of activity (labor, work, and action) and discusses how they have been affected by changes in Western history.  History  The Human Condition was first published in 1958. A second edition, with an introduction by Margaret Canovan, was issued in 1998. The work consists of a prologue and six parts.  Structure =I - The Human Condition Arendt introduces the term vita activa (active life) by distinguishing it from vita contemplativa (contemplative life). Ancient philosophers insisted upon the superiority of the vita contemplativa, for which the vita activa merely provided necessities. Karl Marx flipped the hierarchy, claiming that the vita contemplativa is merely a superstructure on the fundamental basic life- processes of a society. Arendt's thesis is that the concerns of the vita activa are neither superior nor inferior to those of the vita contemplativa, nor are they the same. The vita activa may be divided into three sorts of activities: labor, work and action. II - The Public and the Private Realm According to Arendt, ancient Greek life was divided between two realms: the public realm in which \\"action\\" was performed, and the private realm, site of the household ruled by its head. The mark of the private was not intimacy, as it is in modern times, but biological necessity. In the private realm, heads of households took care of needs for food, shelter, and sex. By contrast, the public realm was a realm of freedom from these biological necessities, a realm in which one could distinguish oneself through \\"great words and great deeds.\\" Property requirements for citizenship reflected the understanding that unless one was able to take care of one's biological necessities, one could not be free from them and hence could not participate in the public realm as a free person among equals. Slaves and subordinated women were confined to the private realm where they met the biological necessities of the head of the household. The public realm naturally was accorded higher status than the private. With the fall of the Roman Empire, the church took over the role of the public realm (though its otherworldly orientation gave it a character distinct from the previous public realm), and the feudal lords ran their lands and holdings as private realms. The modern period saw the rise of a third realm, the social realm. The social realm is concerned with providing for biological needs, but it does so at the level of the state. Arendt views the social realm as a threat to both the private and the public realm. In order to provide for the needs of everyone, it must invade the private sphere, and because it makes biological needs a public matter, it corrupts the realm of free action: There is no longer a realm free from necessity. III - Labor Arendt claims that her distinction between labor and work has been disregarded by philosophers throughout history even though it has been preserved in many European languages. Labor is human activity directed at meeting biological (and perhaps other) necessities for self-preservation and the reproduction of the species. Because these needs cannot be satisfied once and for all, labor never really reaches an end. Its fruits do not last long; they are quickly consumed, and more must always be produced. Labor is thus a cyclical, repeated process that carries with it a sense of futility. In the ancient world, Arendt asserts, labor was contemptible not because it was what slaves did; rather, slaves were contemptible because they performed labor, a futile but necessary activity. In the modern world, not just slaves, but everyone has come to be defined by their labor: We are job-holders, and we must perform our jobs to meet our needs. Marx registers this modern idea in his assertion that man is animal laborans, a species that sets itself apart from the animals not by its thinking, but by its labor. But Marx then contradicts himself in foreseeing a day when production allows the proletariat to throw off the shackles of their oppressors and be free from labor entirely. By Marx's own lights, this would mean they cease to be human. Arendt worries that if automation were to allow us to free ourselves from labor, freedom would be meaningless to us without the contrast with futile necessity that labor provides. Because we define ourselves as job-holders and have relegated everything outside of labor to the category of play and mere hobbies, our lives would become trivial to us without labor. Meanwhile, advances in production and the transformation of work into labor means that many things that were once to be lasting works are now mere disposable objects of consumption, \\"The solution...consists in treating all use objects as though they were consumer goods, so that a chair or a table is now consumed as rapidly as a dress and a dress used up almost as quickly as food.\\" IV - Work Work, unlike labor, has a clearly defined beginning and end. It leaves behind a durable object, such as a tool, rather than an object for consumption. These durable objects become part of the world we live in. Work involves an element of violation or violence in which the worker interrupts nature in order to obtain and shape raw materials. For example, a tree is cut down to obtain wood, or the earth is mined to obtain metals. Work comprises the whole process, from the original idea for the object, to the obtaining of raw materials, to the finished product. The process of work is determined by the categories of means and end. Arendt thinks that thinking of ourselves primarily as workers leads to a sort of instrumental reasoning in which it is natural to think of everything as a potential means to some further end. Kant's claim that humanity is an end in itself shows just how much this instrumental conception of reason has dominated our thinking. Utilitarianism, Arendt claims, is based on a failure to distinguish between \\"in order to\\" and \\"for the sake of.\\" The homo faber mentality is further evident in the substitution of the notion of \\"use value\\" for \\"worth\\" in economic discourse, which marks the beginning of the disappearance of a notion of a kind of worth that is intrinsic, as opposed to value, which is relative to human demand or need. Although use objects are good examples of the products of work, artworks are perhaps the best examples, since they have the greatest durability of all objects. Since they are never used for anything (least of all labor), they don't get worn down. V - Action The third type of activity, action (which includes both speech and action), is the means by which humans disclose themselves to others, not that action is always consciously guiding such disclosure. Indeed, the self revealed in action is more than likely concealed from the person acting, revealed only in the story of her action. Action is the means by which we distinguish ourselves from others as unique and unexchangeable beings. With humans, unlike with other beings, there is not just a generic question of what we are, but of who each is individually. Action and speech are always between humans and directed toward them, and it generates human relationships. Diversity among the humans that see the action makes possible a sort of objectivity by letting an action be witnessed from different perspectives. Action has boundless consequences, often going far beyond what we could anticipate. The Greeks thought of the polis as a place where free people could live together so as to act. Philosophers like Plato, disliking action's unpredictability, modeled the ideal polis on the household. In it, the philosopher king produces the lasting work of legislation, and the people labor under him. Against attempts to replace action with work and labor, Arendt offers two solutions to the two greatest problems action creates: forgiveness to temper action's irreversibility, and promises to mitigate its unpredictability. ‚ÄúHuman plurality, the basic condition of both action and speech, has the twofold character of equality and distinction. If men were not equal, they could neither understand each other‚Äù (175) VI - The Vita Activa and the Modern Age Arendt thinks that three great events determined the character of the modern age: \\"the discovery of America and the ensuing exploration of the whole earth; the Reformation, which by expropriating ecclesiastical and monastic possessions started the two-fold process of individual expropriation and the accumulation of social wealth; the invention of the telescope and the development of a new science that considers the nature of the earth from the viewpoint of the universe.\\" None of these events could have been foreseen. They happened suddenly and had repercussions their instigators never intended. One effect of each of these events is to increase our alienation from the world, which Arendt thinks is far more characteristic of our age than alienation from the self (as Marx thought). The shrinking distances brought about by exploration and transportation technology makes us more an inhabitant of the Earth than of our particular place within it. The process of expropriation kicked off by the Reformation expropriated people from their land and place in the world. Galileo's discovery of the continuity between the earth and the universe alienates people from their world by showing that our earth-centered view of the world is illusory, that the sun does not rise and set as it appears to. What set Galileo apart from other heliocentric theorists is that he proved that heliocentric theories were not merely useful instruments for predicting/explaining data but proper descriptions of reality. Ironically, the outcome of the scientific revolution is that current theories have become so bizarre and that perhaps no one can grasp the world they describe. They have turned out to be useful primarily as instruments, after having shattered our previous understanding of the world. Meanwhile, science now further alienates us from the world by unleashing processes on earth that previously occurred only further out in the universe. We have found an archimedean point to move the world, but only by losing our place in it. The consequence of this world alienation for philosophy has been an intense focus on the self, the one remaining sphere of certainty and knowledge. The world described by science cannot be known, or not with certainty, but the self, Descartes and other moderns thought, could be known. Though his cogito ergo sum was anticipated by Augustine, his dubito ergo sum is original and a hallmark of modernity: beginning from doubt. The notion of common sense as a sense in which the other five were fitted to a common world ceded to a conception of common sense as an inner faculty with no relationship to the world, and the assumption that all humans had faculties like this in common became necessary to get theories going, but without the assumption of a common world, the assumption of faculties in common lost some warrant. Galileo's discoveries also have implications for the 'vita activa' and 'contemplativa'. That he made the discoveries with a telescope, with a product of human work, signals an important change in science. Knowledge is acquired not simply by thinking, but by making. Homo faber and the life of work were thus exalted over the life of contemplation. Indeed, the model of scientific inquiry, the experiment, is one in which the scientist unleashes a process by which the scientist produces results. This way of doing science is naturally understood in terms of work processes. The philosopher has consequently been relegated to a position of relative insignificance, merely puzzling over what the scientists have shown. But in the end, Homo faber ceded primacy to animal laborans. The life of labor became the central concern because all of these developments took place in a Christian society that valued life far more than others have. After secularization, this vestigial preoccupation with life as the central value dominates our activities. It has made us into a society of laborers. Judged by the historical significance of what they do, the people most capable of action now are perhaps the scientists, but unfortunately, they act into nature and not human relationships, and thus their action cannot be the source of meaningfulness that illuminates human existence. Action is still possible in free societies, but fragile.

Biography Plaxico was born in Chicago, Illinois, into a musical family, and started playing the bass at the age of twelve, turning professional at fourteen (playing both double bass and bass guitar). His first recording was with his family's band, and by the time he was twenty he had moved to New York City, where he had stints playing with Chet Baker, Dexter Gordon, Sonny Stitt, Junior Cook, and Hank Jones. He won the Louis Armstrong Jazz Award in 1978. Plaxico first came to public attention through his work with the Wynton Marsalis group in 1982, though his first regular attachment was with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (1983-86), with whom he recorded twelve albums. In the mid-1980s Plaxico joined the M-Base collective and played on the debut- releases of Steve Coleman (Motherland Pulse, 1985), Cassandra Wilson (Point of View, 1986) and Greg Osby (Sound Theatre, 1987). On Wilson's recordings he appeared regularly ever since and is the musical director and first bassist of her tour band for more than 15 years. In 1986 Jack DeJohnette reformed his Special Edition and engaged beside guitarist Mick Goodrick the M-Base saxophonists Greg Osby and Gary Thomas and Plaxico on bass. The band existed until 1993, after three albums with pianist Michael Cain replacing Goodrick on the last. Plaxico has also performed and recorded with a wide range of artists, including Dizzy Gillespie, David Murray, Alice Coltrane, Stanley Turrentine, Andrew Hill, Joe Sample, Abbey Lincoln, Bill Cosby, Lonnie Liston Smith, Ravi Coltrane, Scott Tixier, Barbara Dennerlein, Helen Sung and Nina Vidal.

Teribus ye teri odin or teribus an teriodin () is popularly believed to have been the war cry of the men of Hawick at the Battle of Flodden,The Antiquary, Vol. IX. January-June 1884 p.62ff and still preserved in the traditions of the town. A Hawick Wordbook - Douglas Scott The phrase is probably a string of meaningless syllables without literal meaning. Description The full chorus of the Border ballad Teribus ye teri odin is often sung at festive gatherings, not only in the gallant old border town itself, but in the remotest districts of Canada, the United States and Australia, wherever Hawick men (\\"Teris\\"), and natives of the Scottish Border congregated to keep up the remembrance of their native land, and haunts of their boyhood.MacKay, Charles (1888) A Dictionary of Lowland Scotch p.232 :\\"Teribus ye teri odin :Sons of heroes slain at Flodden :Imitating Border bowmen :Aye defend your rights and common\\" The full version of the Border ballad written by James Hogg in 1819 (not James Hogg, \\"The Ettrick Shepherd\\", with the same name),Teribus which replaced an earlier one by Arthur Balbirnie used a generation earlier,A sketch of the history of Hawick, Hawick 1825 p.343Transactions of the Hawick Archaeological Society 1863 p.35 is still sung at the Hawick Common Riding in June of every year. History Attempts have been made to connect the phrase teribus an teriodin with the names of the Scandinavian and Norse gods, Tyr and Odin from the Old English T»≥r h√¶bbe ≈´s, ƒ°e T»≥r ƒ°e ≈å√∞inn \\"Tyr keep us, both Tyr and Odin\\", an unlikely explanation since the gods' names are given in their Old Norse forms, not the Old English Tƒ´w and W≈çden and the normal phonological development would not result in the modern pronunciation, apart from that, the survival of a supposed Old English sentence in its near original form for more than 700 years is barely conceivable. Charles Mackay described the ballad, of which these mysterious words form the burden, is one of patriotic \\"defence and defiance\\" against foreign invaders and suggested that the phrase is a corruption, or phonetic rendering, of the Scottish Gaelic \\"T√¨r a buaidh, 's t√¨r a d√¨on\\" meaning \\"Land of victory and land of defence\\".MacKay, Charles (1888) A Dictionary of Lowland Scotch pp.232-233 The linguist Anatoly Liberman states, however, that Mackay's goal was to discover the Gaelic origin of all wordsAnatoly Liberman (2008), An analytic dictionary of English etymology: an introduction,University of Minnesota Press, p. 194 and that he thought that most English words are traceable to Gaelic,Anatoly Liberman (2009), 'THE ETYMOLOGY OF 'BRAIN' AND COGNATES', Nordic Journal of English Studies, p. 46 which is certainly not true. Liberman also described MacKay's 1877 dictionary as \\"full of the most fanciful conjectures\\", noting that MacKay \\"was hauled over the coals by his contemporaries and never taken seriously\\". Suggestions It has also been suggested that the phrase is a series of vocables imitating the sound of a march played on drums and bagpipes.SND:Teribus Alistair Moffat suggests in Arthur and the Lost Kingdoms (1999) that the phrase was originally the Welsh \\"Tir y Bas y Tir y Odin,\\" meaning \\"The Land of Death, the Land of Odin\\", although Odin wasn't noted for his popularity amongst the Welsh. However, he also postulates that the phrase could mean \\"Land of Death, Land of the Gododdin\\" (The initial G is often elided), the Gododdin being the local Britonnic tribe of the area. References to the \\"war cry\\" teribus an teriodin do not appear much before the early 19th century.

The park was located behind the West Hotel at 6th St and 1st Ave North in Minneapolis near where Target Center and Target Field are today. Spectators watching a baseball game at Athletic Park from the grandstand, c. 1894-1896. The park was originally built in 1889 under the supervision of local architects Fremont D. Orff and George W. Orff. Bleachers seating roughly 1,600 people were added in 1890; a grandstand with capacity for 1,800 people was built in 1892. The park burned down in 1893, but was rebuilt the next year and further improved. Athletic Park's playing field was very small with distances estimated at between to to the left and right field foul poles. This meant home runs were common in an era otherwise not known for them. Perry Werden's 42 home runs in 1894 and 45 home runs in 1895 were several times higher than contemporary American Association or National League players and would not be challenged until Babe Ruth's rise in the 1920s. The park's shallow outfield meant hits (particularly to right field) still required batters to run hard to first base to avoid being thrown out. High fencing and wire mesh in the outfield helped prevent balls from leaving the field. The park's small dimensions also required some ground rules for ruling whether outfield hits were counted as a ground rule double or home run. The park was the stage for one major league game: a contest between Columbus and Milwaukee of the American Association on October 2, 1891. Milwaukee won 5-0 thanks to excellent pitching from former Minneapolis Miller Frank Killen. Several other games had been planned, but cold and rainy weather prevented playing on October 1st and 3rd. This would be the last major league baseball game played in Minnesota until the Minnesota Twins were founded in 1961. Ice hockey was played here in 1896 when the Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey team played the Winnipeg Victorias. The Minnesota Golden Gophers football team also made use of the field. The ballpark was sold during May of the 1896 baseball season and the Millers were evicted. They returned from a June road trip and opened their hastily-constructed new facility, Nicollet Park. The site remained open as a site for various events, until finally being turned over to developers. In 1901, the so-called \\"baseball block\\" was purchased by T. B. Walker and later developed into the Butler Square warehouse. ReferencesFurther reading *\\"On to Nicollet\\", Nodin Press, 1988, by Stew Thornley.

Plot  The film tells the story of twin German sisters Lotte (Thekla Reuten) and Anna (Nadja Uhl), who are separated when they are six. After the deaths of their parents, they are \\"divided\\" between quarreling distant relatives, one being raised in the Netherlands and the other in Germany. Lotte grows up in a loving middle-class intellectual family in Amsterdam, and Anna is raised in virtual servitude by a poor Catholic peasant family in a backward area. The two girls seek to keep in contact, but Anna's family lacks Lotte's address, and Lotte's new family fails to mail her letters for fear that the brutal farmers will claim her, as well. The cataclysmic events of World War II sweep them even further apart. Lotte falls in love with a young Jewish man who is eventually caught by the Nazis and sent to his death. Anna falls in love and marries a young Wehrmacht soldier who joins the Waffen SS and is killed in the last days of the war. Although the girls find each other just before the outbreak of the war, Anna's attempt to reunite with Lotte in its aftermath is thwarted by Lotte's bitter discovery that Anna's husband had been part of the apparatus that murdered her fianc√©. Only in her old age, when they meet again at a spa, does Lotte reconcile herself to their divergent lives and reclaim the tender sibling feeling of her childhood. The two girls/women are each played by three different actors from the Netherlands and Germany.

Biography  Born in Berlin on 8 June 1933, Hamburger fled from the Nazis with his parents to Brazil when he was three years old.Ernst Hamburger: A courageous S√£o Paulo citizen, Pesquisa FAPESP magazine, Jan.2014, Ed.215 He studied physics at the University of S√£o Paulo and joined its faculty (Institute of Physics) soon after his graduation, in 1960, and retired as a full professor of physics. Hamburger was married to Am√©lia I. Hamburger (d. 2011), also a physicist and colleague at the university. They had five children. One of them, Cao Hamburger, is a film and TV director and scriptwriter. Hamburger died on 4 July 2018, in S√£o Paulo, of lymphoma, at the age of 85.

Early life and education Grover was born in Corpus Christi. Grover lived as a youth in San Antonio. A Roman Catholic, he graduated from the college-preparatory and all-male St. Thomas High School in Houston. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in history and political science from the University of St. Thomas and his Master of Arts degree in the same subjects from the University of Houston. His master's thesis was on Colonel Edward M. House of Houston, a Democrat active in the campaign to elect Woodrow Wilson as the U.S. President. 1972 gubernatorial run Grover was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1960, 1962, and 1964 as a Democrat. In 1966, he switched parties and was elected to the District 15 of the Texas State Senate. In the 1972 Republican gubernatorial primary, Grover led a field of five with 37,118 votes (32.6 percent). Houston businessman Albert Bel Fay ran second with 24,329 ballots (21.3 percent). Three other largely unknown candidates shared a surprisingly large 41.8 percent of the vote. Grover carried the backing of prominent Houston developer and Republican activist James E. Lyon, who discouraged a potential gubernatorial primary bid by Jim Reese, then the mayor of Odessa in West Texas. In an even lower turnout runoff primary, Grover defeated Fay (1913‚Äì1992), the Republican national committeeman from Texas (1960‚Äì1969). Grover received 37,842 votes (66.4 percent), some 700 more votes than he received in the first primary, to Fay's 19,166 (33.6 percent), or 5,000 fewer votes than he obtained in the primary. The Sharpstown bank scandal, which had damaged many of the state's Democratic leaders, worked to Grover's advantage, for he could depict himself as an untainted Republican nominee for governor. His uncompromising conservative, constitutionalist views may have hurt him among moderate voters in both parties. Grover lost the general election by almost exactly 100,000 votes to the Democratic nominee, former state Representative Dolph Briscoe, Jr., of Uvalde. Grover carried almost all of the state's urban centers. The final tally was 1,633,493 (47.9 percent) for Briscoe and 1,533,986 (45 percent) for Grover. Briscoe was a \\"minority governor\\" because he failed to garner a simple majority of the votes. The Hispanic La Raza candidate, then 29-year-old Ramsey Mu√±iz, received 214,118 votes (6 percent), nearly all believed to have been at Briscoe's expense. (Two other minor candidates shared 27,994 votes, or 0.8 percent.) Mu√±iz's support was insufficient to deny victory to Briscoe, but political analysts contend that Briscoe's margin was largely dependent on Hispanic voters in rural areas of south Texas who traditionally stuck with their Democratic nominees. Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland at the time and a leading state Republican, described his friend Grover as \\"his own worst enemy. He couldn't get along, let personal things interfere in the political realm.\\"Billy Hathorn, \\"Mayor Ernest Angelo, Jr., of Midland and the 96-0 Reagan Sweep of Texas, May 1, 1976,\\" West Texas Historical Association Yearbook Vol. 86 (2010), p. 87 In retrospect, Angelo said that Grover's gubernatorial loss set back the development of the Republican Party of Texas by a number of years. During the 1972 campaign, Grover had wanted Angelo to take the state chairmanship to replace George Williford of Austin, a Tower partisan. Grover's Catholicism was apparently not an issue with Texas voters. Had he been elected, he would have become the first Catholic governor of the State of Texas. Many believed that Texas had supported Republican Herbert Hoover in 1928 because opponent Alfred E. Smith was Roman Catholic. Texas, however, had voted narrowly in 1960 for John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president. On the direction of GOP Grover and Republican Senator John G. Tower disagreed over the focus of the GOP. Grover wanted the party to move in a populist direction to attract those who had previously favored Alabama Governor George C. Wallace, for president and combine those otherwise traditionally Democratic voters with the Republican base, consisting mostly of fiscal conservatives. Tower favored a different approach to expand the party by attracting middle-of-the-roaders who stressed \\"good government\\" and those with economically conservative views. Tower and Grover nearly came to fisticuffs in the 1972 campaign when Ernest Angelo, the new mayor of Midland, tried to get the two to work out their differences. The bitterness persisted. While Grover lost his race to Briscoe, Tower was a relatively easy winner for a third term in the Senate over Democrat Harold \\"Barefoot\\" Sanders, a former federal judge. The Grover approach appeared to have been vindicated with the 1976 primary victory of former California Governor Ronald W. Reagan in the first Texas GOP presidential primary in which voters chose the delegates. Indeed, Grover supported Reagan in 1976 over Tower's choice, then U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr. Tower's approach was, however, consistent with the later successes in Texas of the two George Bushes. In his 1991 autobiography, Tower referred to Grover in only one paragraph. 1984 U.S. Senate campaign Tower announced in the summer of 1983 that he would not seek a fifth term. Grover, who had disagreed with Tower on many issues, therefore, entered the Republican primary held in May 1984. He fared poorly in that race. In the first primary, Republicans nominated Congressman Phil Gramm of College Station, another convert to the GOP. Also seeking the 1984 Senate nomination were Robert Mosbacher, Jr., of Houston, son of later U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher, and conservative-to-libertarian Congressman Ron Paul of the district southwest of Houston. Gramm in turn defeated the Democratic nominee, then state Senator and later U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett, and went on to serve three terms in the U.S. Senate. Challenging the \\"Johnson law\\" Grover's reputation as a gadfly to the establishment surfaced again in 1995. As a private citizen, he sued the Texas Republican Party on the grounds that an elections rule, approved by the legislature in 1960, which permits a person to run for the White House and another office at the same time, is unconstitutional. He sued then party chairman, the conservative Thomas Pauken to prevent Gramm from filing for both offices in 1996. \\"It violates the spirit of representative government in the Texas Constitution,\\" Grover said in his lawsuit, filed at 126th State District Court in Travis County. The rule, named for Lyndon B. Johnson, allows a candidate to seek the presidency or the vice presidency and another office in the same election cycle. It was written in 1960 so that then U.S. Senator Johnson could run for re-election to the Senate as well as for president or vice president if he secured a national Democratic nomination. The Johnson rule was since used by former U.S. Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., who ran for reelection in 1988 and was also the 1988 Democratic nominee for vice president. Several other states, including Connecticut with Senator Joseph Lieberman in 2000 and Delaware with Senator Joseph Biden in 2008, also permit presidential and vice presidential candidates to seek other offices at the same time, usually the U.S. Senate being the preferred choice. Former Republican Senator Phil Gramm may have benefited from the rule as well had he won his party's presidential nomination in 1996, but he withdrew from the presidential race even before the New Hampshire primary. Grover's suit went nowhere: the Johnson rule remains in effect in Texas. 1996 Republican Senate primary Grover's filing of the suit could have been motivated too by his own decision to challenge Gramm for renomination in the 1996 Republican senatorial primary. Though he won the support of some Second Amendment groups, Grover finished last in the three-man primary, with just 72,400 votes (7.34 percent). David Young, who termed himself \\"more moderate\\" than Gramm, finished second with 75,463 (7.65 percent). Gramm polled 838,339 (85 percent). Gramm, a former college economics professor, then defeated the Democrat Victor Morales, like Grover a former school teacher, in the general election. Political philosophy The 1996 campaign offered a glimpse into Grover's later political views, largely compatible to those of then Republican presidential contender Patrick J. Buchanan. Grover proposed a $10-a-barrel oil import tax to, in his view, reduce American dependence on imported oil, raise revenue to cut the deficit, and provide an incentive for independent oil drillers to find new wells. Grover proposed bringing home all American troops from Europe and placing them on the Mexican border from Brownsville, Texas to San Diego, California. He believes the military is needed to prevent illegal immigration to the United States and drug smuggling. On abortion, Grover said, \\"I'm 100 percent pro- life.\\" He said that abortion should be outlawed under all circumstances, even when the mother was raped: \\"As sad as those situations are, it's not that child's fault\\", he said. Speaking at Baylor University in Waco, Grover said that the most feminine thing a woman can do is give birth, adding that perhaps college-age women could not understand the full meaning of abortion. Grover also said that he agreed with the 1996 government shutdowns, saying it was \\"the only time Congress has faced up to the fact that the nation is bankrupt\\". Obituary Until his death of Alzheimer's disease, Grover resided in Houston with his wife, Kathleen D. Grover, the mother of his three sons and three daughters. The couple had married in 1952. Prior to entering politics, Grover was a history and civics teacher at Houston's Lamar Senior High School. His eldest son, Bernard D. Grover, who graduated from St. Thomas High School, is known for his activism with the Convention Pro-Continuation of 1861, a moderate group devoted to Texas independence using the federal courts and Texas history and law for that purpose. Grover was a member of the Annunciation Catholic Church in Houston. He was cremated. \\"My husband was not a politician. He was a statesman. His wonderful integrity worked against him in the political process ... I just try to put all the politics out of my mind\\", Mrs. Grover said.Statement of Kathleen D.

He was the eldest son of the Margrave Egbert I of the Brunonen family. Still a minor, he succeeded his father on the latter's death 11 January 1068 in Brunswick and Meissen. He was married to Oda, daughter of Count Otto of Meissen-Orlam√ºnde, whose lands he inherited, including the castle of Wanderslebener Gleichen. In 1073, the Saxons, led by Duke Magnus and Otto of Nordheim, rebelled against King Henry IV. The insurrection was crushed by Duke Vratislaus II of Bohemia in the First Battle of Langensalza on 9 June 1075. Whether Egbert had participated in the Saxon rebellion remains unclear based on extant sources, but since he had nonetheless proved himself an opponent of the king, he was deprived of Meissen, which was given to Vratislaus. However, Egbert drove Vratislaus from Meissen the next year and was condemned. A Frisian county then in his possession was confiscated and given to the Bishop of Utrecht. Egbert originally supported anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfeld, but eventually he and many other Saxon nobles withdrew their support and remained neutral. After the death of Otto of Nordheim in 1083, Egbert was the most important, but also inconsistent, Saxon opponent of Henry IV. In 1085, the two were briefly reconciled and Egbert entertained Henry in Saxony in July. In September, the conflict was resumed, but in 1087, Egbert and Henry made peace. Some sources report that after the death of anti-king Herman of Salm, bishops Hartwig of Magdeburg and Burchard of Halberstadt persuaded Egbert to turn against the king and himself aim for the crown. Whatever the case, Egbert soon broke with his new allies, probably because of unkept promises. Bishop Hartwig's submission to the king isolated Egbert completely. In 1088, Egbert was besieged in his castle of Gleichen for four months by Henry, but on Christmas Eve he managed to escape, during the confusion of battle, with a relief army. He was outlawed and deprived of Meissen and his Frisian possessions by a court of princes in Quedlinburg, and later again at Ratisbon in the same year. The fleeing Egbert, undefeated but isolated, fell in combat in 1090. His remaining possessions fell to his sister Gertrude and her husband Henry the Fat, Margrave of Frisia, whose daughter Richenza married Lothair of Supplinburg, the later Duke and Emperor.

This is in contrast to random effects models and mixed models in which all or some of the model parameters are random variables. In many applications including econometricsGreene, W.H., 2011. Econometric Analysis, 7th ed., Prentice Hall and biostatistics a fixed effects model refers to a regression model in which the group means are fixed (non-random) as opposed to a random effects model in which the group means are a random sample from a population.Ramsey, F., Schafer, D., 2002. The Statistical Sleuth: A Course in Methods of Data Analysis, 2nd ed. Duxbury Press Generally, data can be grouped according to several observed factors. The group means could be modeled as fixed or random effects for each grouping. In a fixed effects model each group mean is a group-specific fixed quantity. In panel data where longitudinal observations exist for the same subject, fixed effects represent the subject-specific means. In panel data analysis the term fixed effects estimator (also known as the within estimator) is used to refer to an estimator for the coefficients in the regression model including those fixed effects (one time-invariant intercept for each subject). Qualitative description Such models assist in controlling for omitted variable bias due to unobserved heterogeneity when this heterogeneity is constant over time. This heterogeneity can be removed from the data through differencing, for example by subtracting the group-level average over time, or by taking a first difference which will remove any time invariant components of the model. There are two common assumptions made about the individual specific effect: the random effects assumption and the fixed effects assumption. The random effects assumption is that the individual-specific effects are uncorrelated with the independent variables. The fixed effect assumption is that the individual-specific effects are correlated with the independent variables. If the random effects assumption holds, the random effects estimator is more efficient than the fixed effects estimator. However, if this assumption does not hold, the random effects estimator is not consistent. The Durbin‚ÄìWu‚ÄìHausman test is often used to discriminate between the fixed and the random effects models. Formal model and assumptions Consider the linear unobserved effects model for N observations and T time periods: :y_{it} = X_{it}\\\\mathbf{\\\\beta}+\\\\alpha_{i}+u_{it} for t=1,\\\\dots,T and i=1,\\\\dots,N Where: * y_{it} is the dependent variable observed for individual i at time t. * X_{it} is the time-variant 1\\\\times k (the number of independent variables) regressor vector. * \\\\beta is the k\\\\times 1 matrix of parameters. * \\\\alpha_{i} is the unobserved time-invariant individual effect. For example, the innate ability for individuals or historical and institutional factors for countries. * u_{it} is the error term. Unlike X_{it}, \\\\alpha_{i} cannot be directly observed. Unlike the random effects model where the unobserved \\\\alpha_{i} is independent of X_{it} for all t=1,...,T, the fixed effects (FE) model allows \\\\alpha_{i} to be correlated with the regressor matrix X_{it}. Strict exogeneity with respect to the idiosyncratic error term u_{it} is still required.  Statistical estimation = Fixed effects estimator  Since \\\\alpha_{i} is not observable, it cannot be directly controlled for. The FE model eliminates \\\\alpha_{i} by demeaning the variables using the within transformation: :y_{it}-\\\\overline{y}_{i}=\\\\left(X_{it}-\\\\overline{X}_{i}\\\\right) \\\\beta+ \\\\left( \\\\alpha_{i} - \\\\overline{\\\\alpha}_{i} \\\\right ) + \\\\left( u_{it}-\\\\overline{u}_{i}\\\\right) \\\\implies \\\\ddot{y}_{it}=\\\\ddot{X}_{it} \\\\beta+\\\\ddot{u}_{it} where \\\\overline{y}_{i}=\\\\frac{1}{T}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{t=1}^{T}y_{it}, \\\\overline{X}_{i}=\\\\frac{1}{T}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{t=1}^{T}X_{it}, and \\\\overline{u}_{i}=\\\\frac{1}{T}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{t=1}^{T}u_{it}. Since \\\\alpha_{i} is constant, \\\\overline{\\\\alpha_{i}}=\\\\alpha_{i} and hence the effect is eliminated. The FE estimator \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_{FE} is then obtained by an OLS regression of \\\\ddot{y} on \\\\ddot{X}. At least three alternatives to the within transformation exist with variations. One is to add a dummy variable for each individual i>1 (omitting the first individual because of multicollinearity). This is numerically, but not computationally, equivalent to the fixed effect model and only works if the sum of the number of series and the number of global parameters is smaller than the number of observations. The dummy variable approach is particularly demanding with respect to computer memory usage and it is not recommended for problems larger than the available RAM, and the applied program compilation, can accommodate. Second alternative is to use consecutive reiterations approach to local and global estimations. This approach is very suitable for low memory systems on which it is much more computationally efficient than the dummy variable approach. The third approach is a nested estimation whereby the local estimation for individual series is programmed in as a part of the model definition. This approach is the most computationally and memory efficient, but it requires proficient programming skills and access to the model programming code; although, it can be programmed even in SAS. Finally, each of the above alternatives can be improved if the series-specific estimation is linear (within a nonlinear model), in which case the direct linear solution for individual series can be programmed in as part of the nonlinear model definition.  First difference estimator  An alternative to the within transformation is the first difference transformation, which produces a different estimator. For t=2,\\\\dots,T: :y_{it}-y_{i,t-1}=\\\\left(X_{it}-X_{i,t-1}\\\\right) \\\\beta+ \\\\left( \\\\alpha_{i} - \\\\alpha_{i} \\\\right ) + \\\\left( u_{it}-u_{i,t-1}\\\\right) \\\\implies \\\\Delta y_{it}=\\\\Delta X_{it} \\\\beta+ \\\\Delta u_{it}. The FD estimator \\\\hat\\\\beta_{FD} is then obtained by an OLS regression of \\\\Delta y_{it} on \\\\Delta X_{it}. When T=2, the first difference and fixed effects estimators are numerically equivalent. For T>2, they are not. If the error terms u_{it} are homoskedastic with no serial correlation, the fixed effects estimator is more efficient than the first difference estimator. If u_{it} follows a random walk, however, the first difference estimator is more efficient. = Equality of fixed effects and first difference estimators when T=2 = For the special two period case (T=2), the fixed effects (FE) estimator and the first difference (FD) estimator are numerically equivalent. This is because the FE estimator effectively \\"doubles the data set\\" used in the FD estimator. To see this, establish that the fixed effects estimator is: {FE}_{T=2}= \\\\left[ (x_{i1}-\\\\bar x_{i}) (x_{i1}-\\\\bar x_{i})' + (x_{i2}-\\\\bar x_{i}) (x_{i2}-\\\\bar x_{i})' \\\\right]^{-1}\\\\left[ (x_{i1}-\\\\bar x_{i}) (y_{i1}-\\\\bar y_{i}) + (x_{i2}-\\\\bar x_{i}) (y_{i2}-\\\\bar y_{i})\\\\right] Since each (x_{i1}-\\\\bar x_{i}) can be re-written as (x_{i1}-\\\\dfrac{x_{i1}+x_{i2}}{2})=\\\\dfrac{x_{i1}-x_{i2}}{2} , we'll re-write the line as: {FE}_{T=2}= \\\\left[\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\dfrac{x_{i1}-x_{i2}}{2} \\\\dfrac{x_{i1}-x_{i2}}{2} ' + \\\\dfrac{x_{i2}-x_{i1}}{2} \\\\dfrac{x_{i2}-x_{i1}}{2} ' \\\\right]^{-1} \\\\left[\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\dfrac{x_{i1}-x_{i2}}{2} \\\\dfrac{y_{i1}-y_{i2}}{2} + \\\\dfrac{x_{i2}-x_{i1}}{2} \\\\dfrac{y_{i2}-y_{i1}}{2} \\\\right] := \\\\left[\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2 \\\\dfrac{x_{i2}-x_{i1}}{2} \\\\dfrac{x_{i2}-x_{i1}}{2} ' \\\\right]^{-1} \\\\left[\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2 \\\\dfrac{x_{i2}-x_{i1}}{2} \\\\dfrac{y_{i2}-y_{i1}}{2} \\\\right] := 2\\\\left[\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_{i2}-x_{i1})(x_{i2}-x_{i1})' \\\\right]^{-1} \\\\left[\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\frac{1}{2} (x_{i2}-x_{i1})(y_{i2}-y_{i1}) \\\\right] : = \\\\left[\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_{i2}-x_{i1})(x_{i2}-x_{i1})' \\\\right]^{-1} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_{i2}-x_{i1})(y_{i2}-y_{i1}) ={FD}_{T=2} Chamberlain method Gary Chamberlain's method, a generalization of the within estimator, replaces \\\\alpha_{i} with its linear projection onto the explanatory variables. Writing the linear projection as: :\\\\alpha_{i} = \\\\lambda_0 + X_{i1} \\\\lambda_1 + X_{i2} \\\\lambda_2 + \\\\dots + X_{iT} \\\\lambda_T + e_i this results in the following equation: :y_{it} = \\\\lambda_0 + X_{i1} \\\\lambda_1 + X_{i2} \\\\lambda_2 + \\\\dots + X_{it}(\\\\lambda_t + \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta}) + \\\\dots + X_{iT} \\\\lambda_T + e_i + u_{it} which can be estimated by minimum distance estimation. Hausman‚ÄìTaylor method Need to have more than one time-variant regressor (X) and time-invariant regressor (Z) and at least one X and one Z that are uncorrelated with \\\\alpha_{i}. Partition the X and Z variables such that \\\\begin{array} [c]{c} X=[\\\\underset{TN\\\\times K1}{X_{1it}}\\\\vdots\\\\underset{TN\\\\times K2}{X_{2it}}]\\\\ Z=[\\\\underset{TN\\\\times G1}{Z_{1it}}\\\\vdots\\\\underset{TN\\\\times G2}{Z_{2it}}] \\\\end{array} where X_{1} and Z_{1} are uncorrelated with \\\\alpha_{i}. Need K1>G2. Estimating \\\\gamma via OLS on \\\\widehat{di}=Z_{i}\\\\gamma+\\\\varphi_{it} using X_1 and Z_1 as instruments yields a consistent estimate.  Generalization with input uncertainty  When there is input uncertainty for the y data, \\\\delta y, then the \\\\chi^2 value, rather than the sum of squared residuals, should be minimized. This can be directly achieved from substitution rules: :\\\\frac{y_{it}}{\\\\delta y_{it}} = \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta}\\\\frac{X_{it}}{\\\\delta y_{it}}+\\\\alpha_{i}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta y_{it}}+\\\\frac{u_{it}}{\\\\delta y_{it}}, then the values and standard deviations for \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta} and \\\\alpha_{i} can be determined via classical ordinary least squares analysis and variance- covariance matrix. Testing fixed effects (FE) vs. random effects (RE) We can test whether a fixed or random effects model is appropriate using a Durbin‚ÄìWu‚ÄìHausman test. : H_{0}: \\\\alpha_{i}\\\\perp X_{it},Z_{i} : H_{a}: \\\\alpha_{i} ot \\\\perp X_{it},Z_{i} If H_{0} is true, both \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_{RE} and \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_{FE} are consistent, but only \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_{RE} is efficient. If H_{a} is true, \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_{FE} is consistent and \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_{RE} is not. : \\\\widehat{Q}= \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_{RE}-\\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_{FE} : \\\\widehat{HT}=T\\\\widehat{Q}^{\\\\prime}[Var(\\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_{FE})-Var(\\\\widehat {\\\\beta}_{RE})]^{-1}\\\\widehat{Q}\\\\sim\\\\chi_{K}^{2} where K=\\\\dim(Q) The Hausman test is a specification test so a large test statistic might be indication that there might be errors-in-variables (EIV) or our model is misspecified. If the FE assumption is true, we should find that \\\\widehat {\\\\beta}_{LD}\\\\approx\\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_{FD}\\\\approx\\\\widehat{\\\\beta}_{FE}.

This organization plan and stage, with the help and support of the city of Rockford, the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade. They also hold an annual St. Patrick's Day Party. The group, known as IMS Unit 1, is located in that city. The first party was originally planned for a small Rockford Faust Hotel meeting room, but as word spread of the celebration, the party was moved to the Grand Ballroom. By 1984, the party had outgrown the Faust Hotel, and it was held in the Forest Hills Lodge. The party then moved to the Armory on North Main Street where it continued to grow in popularity. The largest estimated attendance was in 1991 when over 7,500 members, both IMS members as well as some non-members and their children. With the closing of the Armory, the party was moved around the downtown area - the Ing Skating Palace in 2002 and the Lyran Singing Society in 2003. In 2009 the party was held at the Cliffbreakers Restaurant in North Rockford. The first parade was held in 1980 in downtown Rockford and the tradition has continued along various routes over the years. The parade includes not only members and their families, but also bag pipe bands, high school bands, floats, various government officials, including in one year a U.S. Vice President, various animals including an elephant & birds of prey, color guards, various beauty pageant winners and participants and, of course, clowns. The IMS was founded to help preserve and celebrate the Irish heritage however membership is opened to person of all ethnic heritages. All event proceeds are contributed back to the community to various charities, with a total over $40,000 as of 2005.

The name indicated the primary geographical region in which the Front first fought, based on the city of Stalingrad on the Volga River.  Formation  By order of the Stavka on July 12, 1942, Stalingrad Front was formed, under the command of Marshal S.K. Timoshenko, with N.S. Khrushchev as member of the Military Council and Gen. P.I. Bodin as chief of staff. Ostensibly this was simply a renaming of the now-dissolved Southwestern Front, but in fact was a largely new formation, as the only effective units under its command were the new 62nd, 63rd and 64th Armies, formed from the 7th, 5th and 1st Reserve Armies, respectively.David M. Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp 214, 226Glantz and Jonathan House, When Titans Clashed, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1995, p 121 The armies of the former front had been badly battered and partly encircled in the German Operation Wilhelm (June 10‚Äì15), Operation Fridericus II (June 22‚Äì25), and the opening stages of Operation Blue (began June 28) and the remnants were in retreat towards the east bank of the Don River. The new front was ordered to hold a defensive line within the great bend of the Don, roughly between Kletskaya and the confluence of the Chir and the Don, preparing for the oncoming German Sixth Army. On July 21, Stalin concluded that Timoshenko was no longer capable of effective command, and called Lt. Gen. V.N. Gordov to Moscow, appointing him to command of the front effective July 23. Khrushchev and Bodin remained in their respective posts. At this time Stalingrad Front had eight armies under command: the above-mentioned had been joined by the 51st, 57th, 21st, 28th and 38th Armies, of which the last four were in particularly poor condition. The remnants of 28th Army were being rebuilt as the 4th Tank Army, while 38th was similarly rebuilding as 1st Tank Army. The front also commanded 8th Air Army and the Volga River Flotilla.Glantz, Gates of Stalingrad, pp 226, 229  Defense of Stalingrad  On July 23, Sixth Army began a pincer operation with its XIV and XXIV Panzer Corps against 62nd Army. By the end of the next day two rifle divisions of the army had been pushed aside to the north, the army's right flank had been deeply penetrated and partly encircled in the Maiorovsky region before the advance had to be slowed due to supply difficulties and Soviet resistance. Stalin ordered the half-formed tank armies into the attack against the northern pincer, which began on the 25th. While these attacks were too disjointed to achieve decisive results, by the next day German progress was halted, with Soviet tanks breaking into the rear of XIV Corps, and a 35 km gap remaining between the pincers. The rebuilding 21st Army joined the counterstroke that day as well. During the remainder of the month these actions continued to stymie the German advance and wear down their strength, and also relieve the partially-encircled Soviet force, although at considerable cost in men and vehicles.Glantz, Gates of Stalingrad, pp 226-37 On July 28, the STAVKA released an additional nine fresh rifle divisions to the front from the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. Two days later, Lt. Gen. V.I. Chuikov was reassigned from the command of 64th Army to Gordov's deputy commander of the front; Lt. Gen. M.S. Shumilov took over command of the 64th.Glantz, Gates of Stalingrad, p 245 On Aug. 1, the order of battle of the Stalingrad Front was as follows: * 21st Army (1 Guards rifle and 11 rifle divisions, most rebuilding) - Mjr. Gen. A.I. Danilov * 51st Army (4 rifle divisions, 2 cavalry divisions) - Mjr. Gen. Trofim Kolomiets * 57th Army (1 Guards rifle and 1 rifle division, and 1 anti-tank brigade) - Mjr. Gen. Fyodor Tolbukhin * 62nd Army (1 Guards rifle and 5 rifle divisions) - Mjr. Gen. V.Ya. Kolpakchi * 63rd Army (1 Guards rifle and 5 rifle divisions) - Lt. Gen. V.I. Kuznetsov * 64th Army (6 rifle divisions and 2 rifle brigades) - Lt. Gen. M.S. Shumilov * 1st Tank Army (3 tank corps, 1 tank brigade and 2 rifle divisions) - Mjr. Gen. K.S. Moskalenko * 4th Tank Army (1 tank corps, 2 rifle divisions and 1 anti-tank brigade) - Mjr. Gen. V.D. Kriuchenkin * 8th Air Army - Col. Gen. Timofey Khryukin * 7th Sapper ArmyBoevoi sostav Sovetskoi armii, August 1942Glantz, Gates of Stalingrad, pp 231-32 By Aug. 4, the STAVKA recognized that the size of this front could not be controlled effectively from one headquarters, and so created the new Southeastern Front, to take command of the southern sectors of the front. After some considerable discussion, Col. Gen. A.I. Yeryomenko was given command of Southeastern Front, leaving Gordov in command of the truncated Stalingrad Front. Yeryomenko was given responsibility for the defense of the city itself, and also held a supervisory role over Gordov.Glantz, Gates of Stalingrad, pp 282-83 On Sept. 3, the dispositions and strengths of the armies of Stalingrad Front were as follows: * 63rd Army (Babka to the Khoper River) - six rifle divisions with about 45,000 men; * 21st Army (The Khoper River to the Ilovlia River - 11 rifle divisions, one tank destroyer brigade, and three separate tank battalions, with about 60,000 men; * 4th Tank Army (The Ilovlia River to Kotluban) - five rifle divisions and one tank and one motorized rifle brigade, with about 40,000 men; * 24th Army (Kotluban to 564 km Station) - five rifle divisions and one tank brigade, with about 50,000 men; * 1st Guards Army (564 km Station to the Motor Tractor Station) - eight rifle divisions and three tank corps, with about 80,000 men; * 66th Army (The Motor Tractor Station to the Volga River) - six rifle divisions and four tank brigades, with about 60,000 men. Armor strength: 350 - 400 tanks.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, p 30 By Sept. 28, Stalingrad and Southeastern Fronts had been reinforced to the extent that another reorganization was ordered. Don Front was created, with the 63rd, 21st, 4th Tank, 1st Guards, 24th and 66th Armies, under command of Lt. Gen. K.K. Rokossovsky, who was transferred from command of Bryansk Front; Gordov was removed to the STAVKA reserves. Southeastern Front was disbanded, and Yeryomenko was put in command of the reorganized Stalingrad Front, with under his command *62nd Army (Vasily Chuikov), *64th Army (Mikhail Shumilov), *57th Army (Fyodor Tolbukhin), *51st Army (Nikolai Trufanov), *28th Army (Vasyl Herasymenko). This command structure would remain for the duration of the battle.Glantz, Armageddon, pp 272-73  Counteroffensive from Stalingrad  As of Nov. 19, Stalingrad Front commanded five field armies, plus the 8th Air Army (Timofey Khryukin).

It was formerly ranked by MAKE as the world's fifth largest wind turbine supplier.Source: MAKE Report: Global Wind Turbine OEM 2013 Market Share.  History  In 1995, founder Tulsi Tanti was managing a 20-employee textile company. Due to the erratic availability of power locally, and its rising costs, the highest business expenditure after the raw materials was electricity. The cost of electricity also offset any profits made by the company.Heroes of the Environment , Time, 17 October 2007, accessed on 26 December 2009. After providing electricity for his own company, Tanti moved into wind energy production as a way to secure the textile company's energy needs, and founded Suzlon Energy. Suzlon adopted a business model wherein clients would be responsible for 25% of the up-front capital investment and Suzlon would arrange the remaining 75% on loan. Initially, banks were hesitant to fund loans for this model, but by 2008, many Indian banks started financing wind power projects for Suzlon clients. In 2001, Tanti sold off the textile business; Suzlon is still actively run by Tulsi Tanti, now in the role of Chairman, Suzlon Group. In 2003, Suzlon got its first order in USA from DanMar & Associates to supply 24 turbines in southwestern Minnesota. Also in 2003 Suzlon set up an office in Beijing. Suzlon Rotor Corporation in 2006 began producing the blades in Pipestone, Minnesota in the United States. Among its clients is Wind Capital Group.Renewable energy world In the year 2006, Suzlon reached a definitive agreement for acquisition of Belgium firm Hansen Transmissions, specializing in gearboxes for wind turbines, for $565 million. In 2007, the company purchased a controlling stake in Germany's Senvion (then operating as REpower Systems) which valued the firm at US$1.6 billion. In June 2007, Suzlon had signed a contract with Edison Mission Energy (EME) of US for delivery of 150 wind turbines of 2.1 megawatts in 2008 and a similar volume to be delivered in 2009. EME had an option not to purchase the 150 turbines due to be delivered in 2009, which it has chosen to exercise. In November 2009, the company decided to sell 35% stake of Hansen for $370 million as part of its debt restructuring program, through placing new shares. It appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley as the managers and book runners for the same. In January 2011, Suzlon received an order worth US$1.28 billion for building 1000 megawatts of wind energy projects from the Indian branch of the Lord Swaraj Paul-owned Caparo Energy Ltd. In May 2011, Suzlon announced returning to profitability after the financial crisis of 2009 Suzlon Press Release of 14 May 2011 In October 2011, Suzlon sold its remaining 26.06% stake in Hansen Transmissions International NV to ZF Friedrichshafen AG for . In the same month, it also achieved full control of its German subsidiary REpower Systems (now Senvion) by acquiring the remaining 5% stake held by minority shareholders that resisted the takeover. The takeover was completed through the squeeze-out procedure by paying EUR 63 Million. It has to redeem 500 million worth of FCCB's (foreign currency convertible bonds) in 2012 in tranches of 300 million in June and 200 million in October respectively. In line with the previously announced strategy to dispose of non-critical group assets to reduce long-term debt, Suzlon Chairman said that Suzlon Energy, will sell stake in its China manufacturing unit to China Power New Energy Development Company Limited for 3.4 billion rupees ($60 million). On 30 November 2013 the Suzlon Group subsidiary REpower Systems (now Senvion SE) won an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract from Mitsui & Co (Australia) Ltd to deliver 52 wind turbines with a total rated output of 106.6 MW for the Bald Hills Wind Farm in Victoria, Australia.Suzlon to Supply 52 Turbines to Australian Wind Farm As of August 2014, Suzlon's debt was over 8000 crores. On 22 January 2015, Suzlon announced the sale of Senvion SE, its wholly owned subsidiary, to Centerbridge Partners, a private equity firm in a deal valued at 7200 crores. The deal is expected to ease Suzlon's debt burden. In a further equity infusion, Dilip Shanghvi Family and Associates (DSA), run by Dilip Shanghvi, the founder and managing directory of Sun Pharmaceutical, agreed to purchase a 23 percent stake in Suzlon for a sum of 1800 crores. The deal will see Tanti's holding shrink to 24 percent, but management control will still remain with the Tanti family. Its total borrowings stood at Rs 11430.76 crore in FY16 from Rs 17810.96 crore FY15. On 17 January 2017, Suzlon Energy achieved 10,000 megawatts installed wind energy milestone in India. Suzlon's 10,000 MW of wind installation is capable of powering over 5 million households per annum and offsets approximately 21.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission annually which is equivalent to planting over 1500 million trees. As on date, the company has fifteen manufacturing facilities and a workforce of over 8,000 employees globally.Company Profile: Suzlon  Wind parks  Globally, Suzlon has installed over 17000 MW of wind power capacity in 18 countries.  India  Suzlon crossed 11,000 megawatts of cumulative installations in India. Suzlon has cumulatively added over 11000 megawatts of wind power capacity for over 1,700 customers in India across 40 sites in eight States. Suzlon accounts for nearly one-third of the country's total wind installations. Its notable installations in India include: * The 1064 MW Jaisalmer Wind Park in Rajasthan. * The 1100 MW wind park in the Kutch district, Gujarat, with plans to expand it to 2000 MW in the next four to six years. As of February 2015, this is the largest wind park in Asia at a single location. *The 650 MW wind park in the Sakri Taluka of Dhule District of Maharashtra. And planning to reach 1000 MW. * A 584 MW wind park in the Eastern Ghats, (Tamil Nadu). * The 210 MW Vankusawade Wind Park near the Koyna reservoir in the Satara district of Maharashtra. In 2012, Suzlon signed an Expression of Interest with the government of Karnataka to develop 2500 MW of wind power in the state between 2012 and 2017.

United Kingdom and the United States declared war on Bulgaria on 13 December 1941. The Southern Italy-based Allied air forces extended the range of their strategic operations to include Bulgaria and other Axis allies in 1943. Raids=April 1941 During the invasions of Yugoslavia and of Greece, the Yugoslav and British air forces targeted strategic points in Bulgaria, from which German troops had staged the invasions. On 6 April, Yugoslav Dornier Do 17 aircraft bombed the industrial section of Sofia and Kyustendil. In Sofia, eight people were killed. In the bombing of Kyustendil 58 civilians, two Bulgarian and eight German soldiers were killed and 59 civilians, five Bulgarian and 31 German soldiers were wounded. Between 20:05 and 21:40 on 6 April, the Royal Air Force (RAF) carried out bombing raids over Bulgaria. Bristol Blenheim aircraft bombed Petrich and Haskovo and six Vickers Wellington bombers dropped bombs over Sofia and nearby villages. During the bombing of the capital, 14 building were destroyed and three fires were started.Milanov, Yordan (officer). –í—ä–∑–¥—É—à–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –í–æ–π—Å–∫–∏ –Ω–∞ –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è –ø—Ä–µ–∑ –≤–æ–π–Ω–Ω–∏—Ç–µ 1912-1945 –≥.

Oxford University Press, 1988 Forty-seven buildings and structures were destroyed, 59 military personnel were killed and over 128 were injured. 24 November 1943 A new bombing followed on 24 November, this time executed by 60 B-24 Liberator aircraft. 87 buildings in the vicinity of the Central Railway Station were destroyed with 29 being wounded. Bulgarian fighters shot down two bombers for the loss of one aircraft to escorting American fighters. 10 December 1943 The 10 December raid was carried out by 120 aircraft. About 90 bombs were released over the Hadzhi Dimitar, Industrialen, Malashevtsi and Voenna rampa quarters, another 90 hit Vrazhdebna Airport and the nearby villages. 20 December 1943 One of the most destructive raids followed on 20 December, with over 113 buildings being razed to the ground, the belt line being cut off, with 93 people injured. Bulgarian fighter aircraft downed three bombers and seven fighters for the loss of two aircraft, including one destroyed in a suicidal ramming attack by Dimitar Spisarevski which brought down a bomber. 30 December 1943 A day bombing in the Sofia railway junction area was executed on 30 December 1943, injuring 96. 10 January 1944 Sofia suffered another bombing on 10 January 1944, carried out consecutively by 143 American B-17s during the day and 44 RAF Wellingtons (during the night). 448 buildings were destroyed. 611 were wounded. During the daylight raid by the B-17s, Bulgarian fighters shot down six of the bombers and three escorting P-38 fighters for the loss of one aircraft. 16 March 1944 During the night 50 British bombers attacked Sofia. 58 people were wounded and 72 buildings were destroyed. 24 March 1944 During the night about 40 British bombers attacked Sofia.

Some 450 American and British heavy bombers escorted by 150 fighters attacked the city center of Sofia, destroying 3575 buildings. Over 3000 high explosive bombs and 30000 incendiary bombs were used. Bulgarian fighter aircraft intercepted the attackers, shooting down eight bombers and two fighters for no losses in return.http://warisboring.com/outnumbered-and-outgunned-the- bulgarian-air-force-battled-the-allies-over-sofia/ The casualty figures were relatively modest due to preliminary evacuation of the civilians. The targets of the bombing were neither military installations, nor armed forces, but historical central Sofia. 17 April 1944 This bombing is known as \\"the black Easter\\" (the second day of Easter) for the citizens of Sofia. The raid was carried out by 350 bombers (B-17 and B-24) with an escort of 100 fighter planes -Mustangs and Lightnings. About 2500 bombs were dropped over the target - railroad marshaling yards. 749 buildings were totally destroyed. Casualties were 69 people wounded.

He holds the Asian indoor record for 60 metres with 6.51 seconds. Early life and career Mansour was born in Qatar's capital city, Doha. His parents were nomads who had emigrated to Doha from the Rub' al Khali desert. He received limited education and as a result of few employment opportunities he joined the Qatar Armed Forces when he was 17 years old. From a young age, he participated in basketball, swimming and athletics. In 1983, when he was 19 years old, his coach Uli Kunst encouraged him to focus solely on athletics. Initially a high jumper, he adapted into a sprinter under Kunst's guidance. He participated in the 1985 Asian Athletics Championships, finishing in 4th place in the 100 metres category. Consequently, he received little recognition for his accolade at the time, having been overshadowed by the top 3 contenders. In the 1986 Asian Games, he achieved a gold medal. During the tournament, most of the media initially centered on Zheng Chen, the Asian record holder at the time. However, Mansour's high knee-lift and power running technique impressed many spectators. He knocked off Anat Ratanapol in the semi-finals, clocking a time of 10.32. He clocked a time of 10.30 in the final, and may have had a possibility of surpassing the Asian record at the time had he not decided to play to the audience by raising his arms in triumph before he hit the tape. He set an Asian record in the 60 metre sprint on 3 March 1993 in the annual LBBW Meeting where he clocked a time of 6.51. He also received a bronze medal in the men's 60 metre sprint at the 1993 IAAF World Indoor Championships, making him the first sprinter from Qatar to win a medal in global athletics. After retiring from athletics, he was installed as a member of the board of directors of Al Sadd Sports Club.

He published the book The Jewish Rite of Circumcision (1873). He died in London, England. Life Asher Asher was educated at the Royal High School. He was a prominent member of the local Jewish congregation, as its Honorary Secretary. Then, he abandoned for studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating as Doctor of Medicine in 1856, as the first Jewish doctor of Scotland. He practiced at Glasgow and the nearby Bishopbriggs, a mining town. In 1862, Asher Asher moved to London and became medical officer of the Jewish Board of Guardians, where he helped providing medical care for poor Jews, beside the founder, Dr. Canstatt. In 1866 was appointed secretary of the Great Synagogue. About this time the idea of a union of the various London synagogues had been put forward, chiefly by Lionel L. Cohen; and Asher devoted himself to the project with intense energy. In March, 1870, he became first secretary of the United Synagogue, contributing largely to the success of that institution -- he wrote the introduction to the by-laws of the constituent synagogues, and practically founded its visitation committee. This office he retained until his death. Owing to Asher's intimate relations with the Rothschilds, in his capacity of medical attendant, unofficial almoner, and personal friend, his advice was generally followed by them in communal matters. He was connected with a large number of institutions in the London community, and may be regarded as one of its organizers. Looking for better conditions for Jewish immigrants, Asher undertook journeys to Palestine, the United States, and Russia, in company of Samuel Montagu. Particularly, Asher was pledged about the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe. After the visit to Palestine he also wrote a report on the condition of affairs in Jerusalem, which effected much good. His sympathetic nature attracted to him most of the young men of ability of the rising generation, and upon them he exerted great influence. Asher wrote much for the Jewish press, chiefly under the pen-name \\"Aliquis.\\" Legacy *At the entrance of the Garnethill Synagogue, a plaque remembers Asher Asher. *Since 1910, the University of Glasgow awards the Asher Asher Memorial Medal and Prize, annually for its Ear, Nose and Throat course. *Asher Asher is buried in the Willesden United Synagogue Cemetery, at London.

It is near the village of Goudet in the d√©partement of Haute-Loire, in the Auvergne region. It was built in the 13th century and modified in the 15th and 16th centuries. Perched on a rocky headland overhanging the granitic rocks of the Margeride, the fortress is today a ruined shell. Robert Louis Stevenson stopped here on his trip documented in Travels with a Donkey in the C√©vennes (1879). > \\"In this pleasant humour I came down the hill to where Goudet stands in a > green end of a valley, with Ch√¢teau Beaufort opposite upon a rocky steep, > and the stream, as clear as crystal, lying in a deep pool between them.\\" History Built for surveillance and domination of the Loire valley, the castle provides an interesting example of how a 13th-century feudal castle could be adapted to the evolution of military construction, notable with the development of artillery. During the Hundred Years' War and the Wars of Religion it was of historical importance but after the French Revolution it fell victim to a gradual abandonment which reduced it to the state of ruin. The site includes an enceinte, partly rebuilt in the 15th century, which surrounded the fortress halfway up the hill. The castle itself was, right from the start, of square plan with a courtyard occupied on the south by a residence. In the 16th century, Antoine de la Tour added a tower in the north- western corner, a large horseshoe-shaped tower in the south-western corner, and other walls, parts of which remain on the north and south sides, the latter with a corner tower. with turn of angle. Inside the enceinte, the vestiges on the ground or hidden provide little help to suggest how the inhabited parts were divided. In the north-east, are remnants of an arched room and a chimney. The 15th-century tower was reinforced internally by a second wall and was pierced with holes for archers and cannons. It has been listed since 1994 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. See also *List of castles in France ReferencesExternal links * Chateau Beaufort, includes pictures.

The MICLIC system consists of an M353 3¬Ω ton (3,175 kg) or M200A1 2¬Ω ton (2,268 kg) trailer (or M200 tracked trailer) chassis, a launcher assembly, an M147 firing kit, an M58A3 line charge and a 5-inch (127mm) MK22 Mod 4 rocket. The line charge is 350 feet (107 meters) long and contains 5 pounds (2.27 kg) per linear foot of C-4 explosive. In the event a MICLIC fails to detonate normally, it can be manually activated by time-delay fuses every few feet along the length of it. The M147 Firing Kit can also be employed from other combat engineer vehicles, namely the M60AVLB and the M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicle.

It is a suburb of Jamestown and is situated at the top of Ladder Hill which forms the southern side of the James Valley, at the base of which sits Jamestown. The hill was fortified in the late 1700s and Ladder Hill Fort was subsequently built. The village grew during the 1960s because the James Valley lacked any room for expansion. Description viewed from Rupert's HillThe district is bounded by the contours of Ladder Hill and is essentially a flat plateau. Half Tree Hollow is the largest settlement in Saint Helena, with a population exceeding that of the territory's capital of Jamestown. Its population has fluctuated from 901 in 1998 to 1,140 in 2008 and 984 in 2016. History Ladder Hill was initially known as Fort Hill, even though it was not initially fortified. It was first used by the East India Company as an execution ground with the gibbet visible from Jamestown for the moral edification of the population. The first road to Ladder Hill was completed in 1770 and construction of fortifications on the seaward side of the hill began around 1790. Additional works were built over the next several decades and the complex was known as Ladder Hill Fort by 1815. The fort was reinforced and expanded while Napoleon was in exile in St Helena (1815‚Äì21) and the 20th Regiment of Foot is known to have been garrisoned there in 1819. Additional barracks and officer's quarters were built during the 1820s.Denholm, pp. 91‚Äì94 viewed from the seaA funicular was built to connect Jamestown and the fort in 1829. The cars and rails were removed in 1871 and it was converted into a staircase, commonly known as Jacob's Ladder.

He studied art at Liverpool University, and also completed a psychology degree. Firth admitted that he only found out about Embrace by chance, as he was looking in the music adverts section of a local paper as an old habit and had temporarily given up due to several failures in bands and now having a wife and full-time job, and was actually looking for a new suit as his phrenologist had destroyed his best one. He replaced the band's original bass player J Senior in 1995. In spite of the band's affiliation with football through the release of the 2006 World Cup song, Steve is believed to be the only member of the band who is largely interested, and supports Leeds United.

Biography Davidson was born of Presbyterian parents at Old Deer, near Aberdeen. After graduating from Aberdeen University (1860) as first graduate and Greek prizeman, he held the position of rector of the grammar school of Old Aberdeen (1860‚Äì1863). From 1863 until 1866, he was master in several English schools, spending his vacations on the continent. In 1866 he moved to Canada, to occupy a place in the London Collegiate Institute. In the following year, he came to the United States, and, after spending some months in Boston, moved to St. Louis, where, in addition to work on the New York Round Table and the Western Educational Monthly, he was classical master in the St. Louis high school, and subsequently principal of one of the branch high schools. In 1875, he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. He traveled extensively, and became a proficient linguist, acquiring a knowledge of French, German, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin, and Arabic. In Greece, he devoted himself mainly to archaeology and modern Greek. He wrote Fragments of Parmenides (1869). In Italy, he studied the Catholic Church, scholastic philosophy, Dante, and Rosmini. For studying the Catholic Church, unusual opportunities were thrown open to him, chiefly through the Princess Carolyne of Sayn-Wittgenstein and Cardinal Hohenlohe, who offered him an apartment in his episcopal palace at Albano, and also in the Villa d'Este at Tivoli. His interest in Thomas Aquinas having come to the ears of the pope through Bishop (later Cardinal) Schiatlino, he was invited to the Vatican, where the pope suggested that he should settle in Rome and aid his professors in editing the new edition of St. Thomas. For more than a year he lived at Domodossola, in Piedmont, where the Institute of Charity, founded by Rosmini, has its novitiate. Here he produced the work that first brought Rosmini to the notice of English-speaking students: The Philosophical System of Antonio Rosmini- Serbati, translated, with a Sketch of the Author's Life, Bibliography, Introduction, and Notes (London, 1882). At the same time he wrote essays on classical subjects, mainly archaeological, published under the title The Parthenon Frieze and Other Essays (London, 1882). He also translated Rosmini's Psychology (3 vols., London, 1884). In 1883, he occupied a villa in Capri, and there translated Rosmini's Anthropology. Davidson was a frequent contributor to periodicals, and delivered courses of lectures, before the Lowell Institute in Boston and elsewhere, on modern Greece, on Greek sculpture, etc. He was mainly instrumental in founding \\"The Fellowship of the New Life,\\" which had branches in London and New York. Davidson's most successful work was in connection with the Educational Alliance in New York, where he attained wide popularity by a series of lectures on sociology. A special class was formed for Jewish young men and women, whom he introduced to the great writers on sociology and their problems. He aimed at founding among them what he called a \\"Breadwinners' College,\\" but his work was cut short by his sudden death in Montreal, Quebec. Apeirotheism Thomas Davidson taught a philosophy called apeirotheism that has been described as a \\"form of pluralistic idealism...coupled with a stern ethical rigorism...\\"Charles M. Bakewell, \\"Thomas Davidson,\\" Dictionary of American Biography, gen. ed. Dumas Malone (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1932), 96. Increasingly, he preferred to identify his philosophy as apeirotheism, an appellation he defined as \\"a theory of Gods infinite in number.\\" The theory was indebted to Aristotle's pluralism and his concepts of the soul and Nous. Aristotle's \\"soul\\" is the rational, living aspect of a living substance and cannot exist apart from the body because it is not a substance, but rather an essence; Nous is rational thought and understanding. Davidson argued that Aristotle's Nous identified God with rational thought, and that God could not exist apart from the world just as the Aristotlean soul could not exist apart from the body. Thus Davidson grounded an immanent Emersonian World Soul in a sophisticated Aristotelian metaphysics.Davidson, Journal, 1884‚Äì1898 (Thomas Davidson Collection, Manuscript Group #169, Sterling Memorial Library, Yale University). Quoted in DeArmey, \\"Thomas Davidson's Apeirotheism,\\" 692 Though initially a panentheist, Davidson's studies in Domodossola‚Äîincluding the work of the Italian Renaissance philosopher Giordano Bruno, Leibniz, Kant, and Rosmini‚Äîled him to a panpsychistic monadology, a theory that reality consists of an infinite number of mental or spiritual substances, each with an Aristotelian telos.In this context, panentheism is the view that, not only are man and nature modes or elements of God, as in pantheism, but God also transcends nature. Davidson co-authored a book on Bruno that was published in 1890. Brinton, Daniel G. and Thomas Davidson, Giordano Bruno, Philosopher and Martyr‚ÄîTwo Addresses (Philadelphia: McKay, 1890). Human psyches are unique however, because they possess autonomy, which provides the potential to become divine through proper, moral association with other human psyches. This allowed Davidson to reject pantheism, which, he reasoned, led to a God \\"scattered through the universe...so that the total Absolute exists only in the sum of things taken together.\\" Rather, Davidson argued, God exists everywhere, but he \\"exists fully or completely\\" in each monad. Reality is a G√∂ttergemeinschaft, a society of gods; metaphysical, social and spiritual unity is moral rather than ontological.Thomas Davidson, \\"Noism,\\" The Index (29 April 1886), 525. Concerning Davidson's views on pantheism, see his letter to Havelock Ellis, 20 October 1883. Quoted in Knight, 41. Cf. DeArmey, \\"Thomas Davidson's Apeirotheism,\\" 698. Davidson's religious philosophy had important consequences for social thought. Apeirotheism was utterly democratic and perfectionistic because it entailed that each individual has the potential to be a God, although restrictive social relations have thwarted the development of most people's potential. For Davidson, because we contain the divine within us, our unfettered natural instincts would impel us to act morally. As individuals became increasingly aware of the divine within themselves, so they became increasingly moral.Davidson, \\"The Power Not Ourselves,\\" The Index (15 October 1885), 184. Cf. Davidson, The Philosophy of Goethe's Faust, ed. Charles M. Bakewell (New York: Haskell House, 1969), 157‚Äì58. James believed this individualistic religion made Davidson \\"indifferent...to socialisms and general administrative panaceas.\\" According to James, Davidson taught that \\"Life must be flexible. You ask for a free man and these Utopias give you an interchangeable part, with a fixed number, in a rule-bound social organism.\\" James, \\"Professor William James's Reminiscences,\\" in Memorials of Thomas Davidson, 115. Apeirotheism called for the release of each individual's potential divinity through self-cultivation and the nurturing of others rather than through changes in one's material conditions. Davidson was convinced that this release would lead to the only true reform of human society; it was to this task that he devoted the rest of his life.Cf. Anne C.

It is a Fox owned-and-operated television station in New York City, New York that is owned by the Fox Television Stations subsidiary of Fox Corporation. It was the first morning newscast to air on a Fox-owned station, having launched on August 1, 1988. The program broadcasts each weekday morning from 4:30 to 10 a.m. Eastern Time. The 4:30‚Äì7 a.m. portion is a general news/traffic/weather format. The 7-9 a.m. portion still features news, traffic and weather, but also incorporates entertainment news. The 9-10 a.m. hour addition is entertainment segments including celebrity interviews, politicians etc., as well as feature segments, food, fashion and more. History At the program's debut, Good Day was hosted by veteran WNYW reporter Marian Etoile Watson and radio personality Bob Fitzsimmons. After only a few months, Watson and Fitzsimmons were dropped in favor of Jim Ryan, who became sole anchor; Watson remained on the program in a reduced role. By 1990, Ryan was joined by weathercaster Julie Golden and newsreader Lyn Brown, who also later served as the anchor of Good Day Wake Up. Brown later flipped positions with then-GDNY co-host Maria Genero, with Genero co-anchoring Wake Up alongside Mario Bosquez. When Genero was let go from WNYW, Brown moved back to Wake Up as Bosquez's co-anchor, Ryan anchored the main program solo, and Brown provided news updates and conducted interview segments. Good Day New Yorks inaugural logo, used from August 1, 1988 to 1991. On the morning of September 11, 2001, the program broadcast some of the first live images of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. The program interrupted a commercial for the 2001 Ben Stiller comedy film Zoolander at 8:48 a.m., to show video from a tower camera atop the Empire State Building and its news helicopter Chopper 5 (now SkyFox HD) of the WTC's North Tower on fire after the first plane hit. Kai Simonsen reported from Chopper 5, which captured footage of the second plane crashing into the South Tower. In 2003, Mario Bosquez left WNYW for WCBS-TV (channel 2), and was replaced on Good Day Wake Up by Chris Gailus. Lyn Brown also provided news stories and interview segments on GDNY, with Ryan acting as primary anchor. Ryan and Brown displayed a great deal of chemistry on-air, and Brown appeared on-air for the majority of the 7-9 a.m. block. In 2004, Lucy Noland joined WNYW as Gailus' co-anchor on Wake Up, with Gailus also taking over as newsreader on GDNY. Brown's role on GDNY, shifted to doing interviews and feature stories during the 7-9 a.m. block of the program. When Gailus was moved to the evening newscasts, Brown was brought back for a few months to anchor Wake Up with Noland, continuing to provide interviews and feature stories on the main GDNY program. Jodi Applegate later replaced Brown completely, when she moved to the evening newscasts with Ernie Anastos, anchoring solo from 6-7 a.m. with Noland, and acting as newsreader and co-anchoring with Ryan on GDNY from 7-9 a.m. Ryan retired shortly afterward, and Gailus took over as co-anchor of GDNY from 6-9 a.m., with Noland doing news updates and news-related interviews; Noland then began to solo anchor Wake Up. In April 2006, former WCBS-TV traffic reporter Vanessa Alfano joined WNYW as a feature reporter and substitute meteorologist for the morning newscasts. At the same time, she became a full-time weathercaster for channel 5's Secaucus sister station WWOR-TV (channel 9). In late 2006, Mark Joyella joined the Good Day New York team with his infamous Mark's Missions and Fox Soup segments, which aired every Friday. The first segment featured Joyella being assigned missions from the anchors; if he did not complete the mission as it was requested, he would be ordered to perform an embarrassing stunt. The latter segment, Fox Soup, reflected on the highlighted mistakes/bloopers that occurred in the corresponding week. Joyella left the station in early 2007, effectively resulting in the removal of the two segments. In March 2007, both Lucy Noland and Stacy-Ann Gooden left Good Day. Lynda L√≥pez unofficially replaced Noland, before Christina Park joined as a full-time anchor; Gooden, meanwhile, was replaced by Ines Rosales. Park would eventually be moved to the weekend 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts with then- weekend anchor Karen Hepp moving to Good Day, and former WPIX reporter Julie Chang joining the program to cover entertainment stories. Ron Corning was let go from the program while on vacation during the week of April 7, 2008. It was the first move by news director Dianne Doctor, notorious for shaking up the talent lineup on New York area newscasts, often with mixed results. Corning's departure was met with an overwhelming outcry from GDNY viewers, highlighted by Richard Huff of the Daily News and on various New York media blogs. That same week, Corning and Applegate won Good Day an Emmy Award for best morning show. On July 9, 2008, WNYW announced that Greg Kelly would replace Corning on the program beginning July 1. On September 22, 2008, popular WNYW 10 p.m. anchor Rosanna Scotto was moved to the main Good Day program, taking over the co-anchor spot with Kelly in place of the departing Jodi Applegate. In February 2009, Heather Nauert was appointed co-anchor of Good Day Wake Up, alongside Reid Lamberty; she would later go on maternity leave in July of that year, with business reporter Lisa Murphy filling in for Nauert. On July 13, 2009, Good Day New York was expanded by one hour until 10:00 a.m., as a result of the cancellation of syndicated talk show The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet. After Lamberty departed the station in October 2009, Murphy was named co-anchor of Wake Up alongside Nauert. Murphy left WNYW for Bloomberg Television in October 2010, with Dick Brennan, the station's chief political correspondent, serving as an interim anchor until a permanent replacement was found. Nauert went on maternity leave again in November 2010, prior to the birth of her second child, with Good Day New York reporter Tai Hernandez filling in. In August 2011, Nauert returned from maternity leave, with Hernandez resuming her reporting duties. Steve Lacy was also named full-time co-anchor of Wake Up. In March 2012, Nauert joined the Fox News Channel's Fox and Friends First as its co-host, simultaneously remaining on Good Day, although typically appearing every three weeks; Tai Hernandez then took on co- anchoring duties. On June 30, 2012, Greg Kelly was appointed anchor of the 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts, respectively replacing Harry Martin and Ernie Anastos on both programs. It was also announced that former Good Day weather anchor Dave Price would rejoin the program, replacing Kelly as co-anchor. The move was met with much controversy, with ratings in the first month of Price's role as morning co-anchor becoming significantly lower than usual, falling behind perennial runner-up WPIX (channel 11)'s morning newscast. In October 2012, Nauert left WNYW, due to her increased duties on Fox and Friends First. Tai Hernandez became Wake Up co-anchor, although she would later leave the station in March 2013. On January 24, 2013, Dave Price announced his departure from Good Day New York and former host Greg Kelly would be returning and Good Day Early Call and Wake Up anchor Steve Lacy would replace Greg Kelly at the 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. news. Antwan Lewis would become the interim host of the 4:30-7 a.m. show, while the station decides on the new permanent host. In June 2013, Ben Simmoneau joined Good Day New York as the co-anchor to Juliet Huddy, for Good Day Wake Up) who replaced Tai Hernandez. Simmoneau would take Antwan Lewis' seat while he moved to become the anchor of the Weekend Editions of Fox 5 News at 6 and 10 PM with Christina Park. On June 14, 2016, it was announced that he would be joining WCVB Channel 5 in Boston as an anchor/reporter, where, beginning July 6, he co-anchors NewsCenter 5 at 5PM as well as The 10 O'Clock News on MeTV Boston. On November 1, 2016, Antwan Lewis was moved from anchor of the Weekend Editions of the Fox 5 News at 6 and 10 PM to join Teresa Priolo as host of the 4:30-7am show. The two fill the slots left by the departure of Juliet Huddy in September and Ben Simmoneau in May. On August 21, 2017, Sukanya Krishnan and Jennifer Lahmers became anchors of Good Day Wake Up 4:30-7 a.m. Teresa Priolo and Antwan Lewis were moved to the evening newscasts at 5 and 10 p.m. becoming news reporters. On September 29, 2017, Greg Kelly, announced his departure from Good Day New York, leaving Co-anchor Rosanna Scotto after being on the air together since 2008. Kelly and Scotto were one of a kind, and had very special chemistry together which made the ratings very high for the show. Lori Stokes, was named Gregs replacement right away and appeared on Good Day New York not even a week since Kelly's departure, on October 4, 2017. It is still unclear if it was in the works by Fox 5 WNYW to have Kelly out. Stokes left WABC-TV in August. Ratings For much of the time since its debut, Good Day New York has placed second among the New York City market's morning newscasts overall (behind WABC-TV), and ahead of WPIX's PIX Morning News in the 7-9 a.m. timeslot. For the May 2008 sweeps period, Good Days ratings had slipped, with WPIX's morning newscast tightening WNYW's lead. For the February 2013 sweeps period, Good Day New York placed second in the 7-9 a.m. time period in the key demographic of adults 25-54, behind Good Morning America on WABC, but ahead of Today by 10,000 homes, which placed third behind the locally produced WNYW newscast. The sweeps results were highly noted among industry media for being the first time that a local news program in the New York market placed ahead of Today in the people meter ratings. March 2014, was an all-time high as well.

History of Fox 5 Midday At the time of the newscast's inception in 1995, the broadcast was initially a combination talk show/newscast (similar in format to future sister station WWOR-TV's Nine Broadcast Plaza from the late 1980s), hosted by veteran NY anchor Carol Jenkins (who had just left WNBC), titled Carol Jenkins Live; a call-in number was a part of the format. This would be followed by a straight newscast dubbed the Fox Midday News. Soon after, this approach was abandoned and the program instead became just a straight newscast, re-titled to Fox 5 Live, and anchored by Mario Bosquez and Jenkins, who was later replaced by Lyn Brown. The program, which originally aired at 11:30 a.m., was created as an earlier alternative to the noon newscasts on competitors WNBC and WABC-TV. After Basquez left the station for WCBS-TV in 2003, Brown solo anchored the program until her retirement on June 30, 2006. Immediately afterwards, Lucy Noland became anchor of the broadcast, with Mike Woods as meteorologist. When Noland left in March of that year, Lynda Lopez began anchoring the program on a trial basis. Anne Craig, Ron Corning and Jodi Applegate occasionally served as fill-in anchors and reported for the broadcast, with Vanessa Alfano serving as a fill-in meteorologist. Reid Lamberty joined Lopez as co-anchor on August 13, 2007, in addition to a trial run on Good Day Wake Up as possible permanent replacements for Lucy Noland and Chris Gailus. On September 12, 2006, the newscast was expanded to one hour and was moved up a half-hour to 11 a.m., in order to improve ratings. Despite this, WABC-TV's broadcast of ABC's The View remained in the ratings lead in the 11 a.m. timeslot. In October 2007, Lopez returned to MyNetworkTV-affiliated sister station WWOR-TV and was replaced by CNN alumnus Christina Park. At the end of June 2008, however, Park was replaced by Karen Hepp, due to Park's move to the weekend evening newscasts. Soon after, Rosanna Scotto and Greg Kelly took over as anchors of the newscast when Hepp was released by the station. The program was cancelled (rather than being retained in its existing slot or moved to the noon hour) on July 13, 2009, coinciding with the addition of the 9:00 a.m. hour of Good Day New York.

It is headquartered in Houston, Texas. The magazine states that its goal is to \\"honestly and accurately cover the current state of hard music and alternative culture from a faith-based perspective.\\" It is known for being one of the first magazines dedicated to covering Christian metal. The magazine's content includes features; news; album, live show and book reviews, culture coverage and columns. HM's occasional \\"So and So Says\\" feature is known for getting into artists' deeper thoughts on Jesus Christ, spirituality, politics and other controversial topics.  History  Theocracy In 1985, Doug Van Pelt started Heaven's Metal as a fanzine. The classified ad Van Pelt's friend placed in Kerrang! happened to be in the British rock magazine's 100th issue ‚Äî an issue with 100,000 extra copies. This affected the number of people ordering subscriptions. During that time, many Christian record labels became interested in Christian metal, and they started to advertise newly signed metal bands on in Heaven's Metal since it was the only publication exclusively covering the movement. Soon, Heaven's Metal achieved more popularity and became an official, professional publication, with five full-time journalists working for the magazine. Heaven's Metal achieved a regular subscription base of 15,000 readers. The name was changed to HM Magazine in 1995, HM stands for \\"Hard Music.\\" Despite name and format changes over its history, the magazine's spiritual focus remains Christian, as it follows both the Christian rock and the Christian metal movement. Bands' sales usually rose when the ensembles were covered in the magazine. For example, during the mid-1990s, HM was the only magazine that covered P.O.D. The band's label appreciated HM for this, and eventually Atlantic Records bestowed upon Van Pelt the gold P.O.D. plaque. During the 1990s, HM sealed a distribution deal with a major magazine wholesaler that immediately increased its print-run from 13,000 to 22,000 copies, and it allowed Van Pelt and his co-workers to double ad rates, making HM a stable business enterprise. Two specific articles greatly bolstered HM's popularity. The first was the band King's X's vocalist Doug Pinnick revealing his homosexuality. The second was Alice Cooper's interview in 2002 when he, for the first time in public, admitted being a Christian, though he had avoided becoming a \\"celebrity Christian\\" since other news portals in the world quickly noted this interview. In October 2004, Van Pelt revived the Heaven's Metal name, starting a fanzine under the same name, to be released between issues of the primary HM Magazine. (At the time, HM was a bi-monthly publication.) Christianity and metal music were also themes of this venture, but it was produced in a smaller, less formal format. The fanzine focused on the more traditional styles of heavy metal, and it regularly featured bands considered not as mainstream as those featured in the HM Magazine. Currently, Heaven's Metal is run alongside HM Magazine as a \\"magazine within the magazine,\\" coming out 12 times a year as part of HM Magazine. HM has expanded to include acts other than those that would fit into the hard rock or metal category. It is not unusual to find an article on a softer rock band like Deas Vail or a synthpop group like Owl City. However, the magazine's focus remains steadfast in covering \\"left-of-center\\" bands. In an attempt to get out of debt, HM launched a \\"Save HM Magazine Campaign\\" in March 2012 through their website to raise funds in order to continue printing the publication. As a thanks to donors, contributors were offered a collection of songs available for download. After more than 26 years of publishing as a print magazine, with simultaneous digital editions starting to run in May 2007, the publication went exclusively digital starting with the December 2011 (issue #151) and changed to a monthly format. In February 2013, Van Pelt sold the magazine to current editor David Stagg under undisclosed terms. Stagg had previously interned at HM Magazine in the summer of 2003, and remained on staff as a feature writer and reviewer when ownership changed to his hands.

Description There are around 10,000 Catholic faithful in Cyprus, corresponding to just over 1% of the total population. Most Catholic worshippers are either Maronite Cypriots, under Joseph Soueif Archeparch of the Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Cyprus, or Latins, under the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, with a Patriarchal Vicar General. The Latin Patriarchal Vicariate for Cyprus has four parishes: * The Holy Cross church in Nicosia, with a dependent mission at the St. Elizabeth Catholic Church in Kyrenia, Northern Cyprus. * The St. Mary of Graces Church in Larnaca. * The St. Catherine Catholic Church in Limassol. * The St. Paul Catholic Church in Paphos. The Sisters of St. Bruno and Bethlehem have a small convent at Mesa Chorio served by the parish priest of Paphos. A recently constructed hospice provides palliative care, regardless of nationality or religious persuasion. There is also a Catholic presence through chapels and chaplains serving British military personnel, staff and dependents in the Sovereign Base Areas of the island that were established in 1960. Sacred sites in Cyprus The Catholic Chrysopolitissa Church, Paphos Many of the religious sites in Cyprus can be traced to early Byzantine foundations, built before the East-West Schism between Rome and Constantinople in the 11th century. Their architecture and iconography reveal a profound influence on ecclesial building traditions still in use in the Cypriot Orthodox Church. In the Middle Ages, Cyprus was ruled by a Frankish aristocracy, the Lusignan dynasty. They favoured the Gothic style when establishing cathedrals and monasteries. The former Catholic Augustinian Cloister of Bellapais near Kyrenia was transferred to Orthodox Church authorities when the Ottomans conquered Cyprus at the end of the 16th century. Other Gothic churches were converted to mosques, for example Saint Sophia Cathedral, now Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia), and Saint Nicholas Cathedral in Famagusta, now the Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque.

In his career, Lapointe played for the Quebec Nordiques, Colorado Avalanche, Calgary Flames, New York Islanders, and Philadelphia Flyers. Early life Lapointe grew up in the city of Lachine, Quebec. As a child all he did was play hockey. As a teenager his first job was not an average job. It was playing in the QMJHL. Players in this league got paid just like players in the NHL do, just not as much money. Other than this, Lapointe had no other occupations other than hockey.. He was offered a scholarship by the University of Michigan but he refused it. Playing career He was drafted by the Nordiques (now the Colorado Avalanche) in the 12th round of the 1988 NHL Draft, with the 234th overall pick. Lapointe spent most of his NHL career with the New York Islanders. He was there from the 1996‚Äì97 season to the 2002‚Äì03 season. While with the New York Islanders, he received many honors such as many NYI Fan club MVP awards and three Bob Nystrom awards, which is awarded to the player who most exemplifies leadership, hustle, and dedication. He also received awards for reaching the 800 game mark, (over 1000 NHL games including reg. season, playoffs, and pre-season), over 100 goals. Other achievements include being named Assistant captain with the Islanders, ranking among the Top 3 in the NHL for face-off win percentage for 15 years consecutively - his entire NHL career. Similarly, Lapointe was among the league's elite in terms of physical conditioning. In 1999, he represented Canada at the IIHF World Hockey Championships in Norway, only to lose to Sweden in the bronze medal game. Lapointe was a strategic player with great anticipation skills, incredible skating skills and played every shift with intensity. He had an in- your-face hockey style but was well-liked and well-respected by coaches, teammates, referees, and management around the league. During the 2002‚Äì03 season he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers and in 2004, Lapointe retired from the NHL. Personal life Lapointe has two sons: Kirk and Kody. He coaches and trains aspiring hockey players both on ice and off ice. His training and technical approach has raised eyebrows and gotten much notice from junior and NHL general managers. Lapointe's ability to rapidly develop and hone talent far exceeds the norm - He consistently takes Midget BB kids and transforms them into high Midget Espoir and AAA draft choices in as little as three months with targeted on and off ice regimens. Lapointe credits his motivational approach and his attention to detail as the keys to successfully understanding what each player needs to keep them improving beyond what they think they are capable of achieving.

Captain Archer is ordered to transport Vulcan Ambassador V'Lar from a planet where her integrity has been called into question. This episode also includes special effect sequences with a science fiction vessel, the 22nd century Vulcan Sh'Raan class. Plot After ten months without a break, Sub-Commander T'Pol notes efficiency on board Enterprise is down, and suggests shore leave on Risa. Captain Archer agrees. En route, however, Archer receives a transmission from Admiral Forrest, informing him of a Vulcan Ambassador in need of extradition. With the closest Vulcan starship over a week away Enterprise is ordered to retrieve and deliver her to the Vulcan cruiser Sh'Raan. Arriving at Mazar, Archer and T'Pol are surprised to hear the Ambassador has been expelled for abuse of her position. Archer is called to the bridge and speaks to a Mazarite captain who requests that V'Lar be returned for further questioning. He stalls for time to contact Starfleet, but the Mazarite ship opens fire. During the battle, the aft phase cannons disable the enemy ship's engines, allowing Enterprise to escape. Confronting V'Lar, Archer finds her unwilling to reveal more, stating that it is a matter for Vulcan High Command only. Archer then orders Ensign Mayweather to set a course to return to Mazar. Later, after speaking with V'Lar in private, T'Pol persuades Archer to continue the rendezvous with the Sh'Raan, but Enterprise immediately comes under attack from three Mazarite ships. Archer opts for flight but even at Warp 5, the Mazarite ships still gain steadily. V'Lar suddenly confesses that her reputation was intentionally sullied to make the Mazarites believe she would no longer be a credible witness against corrupt officials. V'Lar offers to surrender herself for the safety of the crew, but Archer refuses. Stalling for time, Archer informs the Mazarites that V'Lar suffered injuries and is in critical condition, allowing them to board Enterprise. The Sh'Raan arrives and threatens to destroy the Mazarite ships unless they surrender immediately. At this point, Archer's ruse is revealed, and V'Lar appears unharmed. A grateful V'Lar tells them that their bond of trust and friendship bodes well for future human-Vulcan relations. Reception \\"Fallen Hero\\" includes special effect scenes of the science fiction spaceship, the Sh'Raan of Vulcan, which was ranked as the 22nd most powerful spacecraft of the Star Trek franchise by CNET in 2016. The Vulcan Sh'raan fictional spacecraft was ranked the 14th best spacecraft of Star Trek by Space.com in 2017.

Her work aimed to create functional living spaces in the belief that better design helps in creating a better society. In her article \\"L'Art de Vivre\\" from 1981 she states \\"The extension of the art of dwelling is the art of living ‚Äî living in harmony with man's deepest drives and with his adopted or fabricated environment.\\" McLeod, Mary. \\"Domestic Reform and European Modern Architecture: Charlotte Perriand, Grete Lihotzky and Elizabeth Denby.\\" In Modern Women: Women Artists at the Museum of Modern Art. Ed. Cornelia Butler and Alexandra Schwartz. New York: Museum of Modern Art (2010). Charlotte liked to take her time in a space before starting the design process. In Perriand's Autobiography, \\"Charlotte Perriand: A Life of Creation\\", she states: \\"I like being alone when I visit a country or historic site. I like being bathed in its atmosphere, feeling in direct contact with the place without the intrusion of a third party.\\" Her approach to design includes taking in the site and appreciating it for what it is. Perriand felt she connected with any site she was working with or just visiting she enjoyed the living things and would reminisce on a site that was presumed dead.  Early life  Perriand was born in Paris, France to a tailor and a seamstress. Her high school art teacher noticed her drawing abilities early on, and her mother eventually encouraged her to enroll in the √âcole de L'Union Centrale des Arts D√©coratifs (=\\"School of the Central Union of Decorative Arts\\") in 1920 to study furniture design until 1925. One of her noted teachers during this period was Art Deco interior designer Henri Rapin. Perriand continued her education through attending department store classes that provided design workshops. She also went to lectures by Maurice Dufr√™ne, the studio director of workshop 'La Ma√Ætrise'. In 1925, her projects from schoolwork were selected to be a part of the Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes. Dufr√™ne also put her wall-hanging designs on display at the Galeries Lafayette around this time.  Career  Si√®ge pivotant (1927), Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, Paris Two years after graduating Perriand renovated her apartment into a room with a built-in wall bar made of aluminium, glass and chrome and a card table with built-in pool-pocket drink holders. She recreated this design as the Bar sous le Toit (=Bar under the roof, i.e. \\"in the attic\\") at the 1927 Salon d'Automne. Her design featured an abundance of light-reflecting aluminium and nickel-plated surfaces, as well as leather cushions and glass shelves. Her design received wide praise from the press and established Perriand as a talent to watch. The Bar sous le Toit showed her preference for designs that represented the machine age, a departure from the preference of the time for finely handcrafted objects made of rare woods. Perriand took advantage of the use of steel as a medium in this project, which formerly was used primarily by men. Despite the success of the Bar sous le Toit in getting her name known, Perriand was not satisfied with creating designs just for the well-off; she wanted to work for Le Corbusier and pursue serial production and low-cost housing. She was inspired by his books, because she thought his writings that criticized the decorative arts aligned with the way she designed. When she applied to work at Le Corbusier's studio in October 1927, she was famously rejected with the reply \\"We don't embroider cushions here.\\" A month later however, Le Corbusier visited the Bar sous le Toit at the Salon d'Automne, which convinced him to offer her a job in furniture design.  Work with Le Corbusier 1927-1937  At Le Corbusier's studio she was in charge of their interiors work and promoting their designs through a series of exhibitions.Hinchman, Mark: History of Furniture. New York: Fairchild Books, 2009. pp. 493-496. Print. Perriand described the work as being highly collaborative between Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret (his cousin) and herself; they were \\"three fingers on one hand.\\" In 1928 she designed three chairs from Corbusier's principles that the chair was a \\"machine for sitting,\\" and that each of the three would accommodate different positions for different tasks. At Corbusier's request, a chair was made for conversation: the B301 sling back chair; another for relaxation: the LC2 Grand Comfort chair; and the last for sleeping: the B306 chaise longue. The chairs had tubular steel frames. In the prototype models, the steel was painted; in production the steel tubes were nickel- or chromium-plated. In the 1930s Perriand's focus became more egalitarian and populist. Along with designing furniture and living spaces she was also involved with many leftist organizations, such as the Association des √âcrivains et Artistes R√©volutionnaires and Maison de la Culture. She also collaborated with the \\"Jeunes\\" in 1937 and helped to found the \\"Union des Artistes Modernes\\". In her designs from that period, rather than using chrome, which proved to be expensive, she began to use traditional materials such as wood and cane, which were more affordable. She also used some handcrafted techniques which she displayed at the 1935 Brussels International Exposition.From Tubular Steel to Bamboo: Charlotte Perriand, the Migrating Chaise-longue and Japan by Charlotte Benton. Journal of Design History VOL.11, No.1 (1998). Many of her designs from this period were inspired from the vernacular furniture of Savoie, where her paternal grandparents lived ‚Äî a place she visited often as a child. After working with Le Corbusier for a decade she \\"stepped out of his shadow into a successful career of her own.\\"  Japan & Vietnam 1940-1946  After finishing her work with Le Corbusier she worked with Jean Prouv√©. He designed metal objects, like screens and stair railings. The war turned their focus to designing military barracks and furnishings for temporary housing. In 1940 France surrendered, and they parted ways until 1951. Perriand left France to go to Japan when the Germans arrived to occupy Paris in 1940. She travelled to Japan as an official advisor for industrial design to the Ministry for Trade and Industry. While in Japan she advised the government on raising the standards of design in Japanese industry to develop products for the West. On her way back to Europe she was detained and forced into Vietnamese exile because of the war. Throughout her exile, she studied woodwork and weaving and also gained much influence from Eastern design. The Book of Tea which she read at this time also had a major impact on her work and she referenced it throughout the rest of her career. In the period after World War II (1939‚Äì45) there was increased interest in using new methods and materials for mass production of furniture. Manufacturers of materials such as formica, plywood, aluminum, and steel sponsored the salons of the Soci√©t√© des artistes d√©corateurs. Designers who exhibited their experimental work at the salons in this period included Perriand, Pierre Guariche, Ren√©-Jean Caillette, Jean Prouv√©, Joseph-Andr√© Motte, Antoine Philippon and Jacqueline Lecoq.  Return to Paris 1946-1966  Charlotte Perriand's work was in high demand and she worked on many projects from ski resorts to student housing. She often refused to furnish buildings designed by other architects. However, she was eager to work with Jean Prouv√© again, who collaborated with her on and produced several of her designs from 1951 to 1953. She also designed the interiors and kitchens for the famous Unit√© d'habitation. Some of her work at that particular period of time includes: * The M√©ribel ski resort * The League of Nations building for the United Nations in Geneva * The remodelling of Air France's offices in London, Paris and Tokyo  Les Arcs 1967-1982  The ski resorts at Les Arcs in Savoie combined Perriand's interests in prefabrication, standardization, industrialization and mountain architecture, and has been called the climax of her career. Since guests would spend most of their time outdoors, Perriand designed minimal rooms, the minimal cell style being a hallmark of her design. Instead the buildings have great spaces that are open to the nature and the elements. Importantly standardization of the wet units (bathrooms and kitchens) increased efficiency and allowed them to build 500 inhabitable studios very quickly.  The Chaise Longue  Chaise Longue by Charlotte Perriand and Le Corbusier Perriand was familiar with Thonet's bentwood chairs and used them often not only for inspiration but also in her designs. Their chaise longue, for this reason, bears some similarity to Thonet's bentwood rocker although it doesn't appear to rock when sitting on the 4-legged base. But when the chaise is removed from the base and set on a flat surface, it rocks very smoothly. The chair has double tubing at the sides and a lacquered sheet metal base. The legs unintentionally resemble horse hooves. Perriand took this and ran with it, finding pony skin from Parisian furriers to cover the chaise. Perriand wrote in a memoir: \\"While our chair designs were directly related to the position of the human body...they were also determined by the requirements of architecture, setting, and prestige\\". With a chair that reflects the human body (thin frame, cushion/head) and has decorative qualities (fabrication, structural qualities) they accomplished this goal. It wasn't instantly popular due to its formal simplicity, but as modernism rose, so did the chair's popularity.  Personal life  In 1926 Perriand married her first husband, Percy Kilner Scholefield, and they converted their attic apartment into a 'machine age' interior. In 1930 Charlotte and Percy separated and she moved to Montparnasse. She had a daughter born in 1944, Pernette, with her second husband, Jacques Martin, who worked alongside her mother for over 25 years. She died three days after her 96th birthday in 1999.

It was rediscovered by Keith Stroup, founder of NORML, who circulated prints of the film around college film festivals in the 1970s. The company who produced the prints, New Line Cinema, was so successful they began producing their own films. The most controversial was perhaps a clip from a newscast from Portland, Oregon in November 1970. In the clip, the disposal of a beached whale carcass by dynamite is documented, including the horrific aftermath of falling mist and chunks since the exclusion zone was not big enough.\\"Long before the viral video or 'breaking the internet', there was the exploding whale\\". 13 November 2015. 9News.com.au.

The series showcased amusing film clips, mostly shot on 8mm equipment by amateurs. The idea was revived in 1989 with America's Funniest Home Videos, a series described by an ABC executive as a one-time \\"reality-based filler special\\" that was inspired by a segment of a Japanese variety show, Fun With Ken and Kaito Chan, borrowing clips from various Japanese home video shows as well.Wiener-Bronner, Danielle (21 October 2015) \\"The internet was supposed to kill 'America‚Äôs Funniest Home Videos.'

Later distribution of viral videos on the internet before YouTube, which was created in 2005 and bought by Google in 2006, were mostly through websites dedicated to hosting humorous content, such as Newgrounds and YTMND, although message boards such as eBaum's World and Something Awful were also instrumental. Notably, some content creators hosted their content on their own websites, such as Joel Veitch's site for his band Rather Good, which hosted quirky Flash videos for the band's songs; the most popular was \\"We Like the Moon\\", whose viral popularity on the internet prompted Quiznos to parody the song for a commercial.Fine, Jon (16 February 2004). \\"Pop culture: Veitch's critters hit big in Quiznos spots\\".

The introduction of social media such as Facebook and Twitter has created even more avenues for videos to go viral. More recently, there has been a surge in viral videos on video sharing sites such as YouTube, partially because of the availability of affordable digital cameras. Beginning in December 2015, YouTube introduced a \\"trending\\" tab to alert users to viral videos using an algorithm based on comments, views, \\"external references\\", and even location. The feature reportedly does not use viewing history to serve up related content, and the content may be curated by YouTube.Cox, Jamieson (9 December 2015). \\"YouTube is making it easier to find viral videos\\". The Verge. Retrieved 27 December 2015.  Qualification  There are several ways to gauge whether a video has \\"gone viral\\". The statistic perhaps most mentioned is number of views, and as sharing has become easier, the threshold requirement of sheer number of views has increased. YouTube personality Kevin Nalty (known as Nalts) recalls on his blog: \\"A few years ago, a video could be considered 'viral' if it hit a million views\\", but says as of 2011, only \\"if it gets more than 5 million views in a 3-7 day period\\" can it be considered \\"viral\\".O'Neill, Megan (9 May 2011). \\"What Makes A Video 'Viral'?\\" AdWeek.

To compare, 2004's Numa Numa received two million hits on Newgrounds in its first three months (a figure explained in a 2015 article as \\"a staggering number for the time\\"). Nalts also posits three other considerations: buzz, parody, and longevity, which are more complex ways of judging a viral video's views. Buzz addresses the heart of the issue; the more a video is shared, the more discussion the video creates both online and offline. What he emphasizes is notable is that the more buzz a video gets, the more views it gets. A study on viral videos by Carnegie Mellon University found that the popularity of the uploader affected whether a video would become viral, and having the video shared by a popular source such as a celebrity or a news channel also increases buzz. It is also part of the algorithm YouTube uses to predict popular videos.Southern, Matt (10 December 2015). \\"YouTube Introduces a 'Trending' Tab, Surfacing Viral Videos in Real Time\\". Search Engine Journal. Retrieved 27 December 2015. Parodies, spoofs and spin-offs often indicate a popular video, with long-popular video view counts given with original video view counts as well as additional view counts given for the parodies. Longevity indicates if a video has remained part of the Zeitgeist.  Reasons for popularity  Due to their societal impact and marketability, viral videos attract attention in both advertising and academia, which try to account for the reason viral videos are spread and what will make a video go viral. Several theories exist. A viral video's longevity often relies on a hook which draws the audience to watch it. The hook is able to become a part of the viral video culture after being shown repeatedly. The hooks, or key signifiers, are not able to be predicted before the videos become viral.Burgess, Jean (2008).'All Your Chocolate Rain Are Belong to Us?' Viral Video, YouTube, and the Dynamics of Participatory Culture \\"Video Vortex Reader: Responses to YouTube\\". Institute of Network Cultures, Amsterdam, pp. 101‚Äì109. The early view pattern of a viral video can be used to forecast its peak day in future. Notable examples include \\"All your base are belong to us\\", based on the poorly translated video game Zero Wing, which was first distributed in 2000 as a GIF animation and became popular for the grammatically incorrect hook of its title, and Don Hertzfeldt's 2000 Academy Awards Best Animated Short Film nomination \\"Rejected\\" with the quotable hooks \\"I am a banana\\" and \\"My spoon is too big!\\"Moreau, Elise (30 October 2014). \\"10 Videos That Went Viral Before YouTube Even Existed\\".

For the first time, YouTube hosted the CNN-YouTube presidential debates, calling on YouTube users to pose questions. In this debate, the opinions of viral video creators and users were taken seriously. There were several memorable viral videos that appeared during the campaign. In June 2007, \\"I Got a Crush... on Obama\\", a music video featuring a girl claiming to have a crush on presidential candidate Barack Obama, appeared. Unlike previously popular political videos, it did not feature any celebrities and was purely user-generated. The video garnered many viewers and gained attention in the mainstream media. YouTube became a powerful source of campaigning for the 2008 Presidential Election. Every major party candidate had their own YouTube channel in order to communicate with the voters, with John McCain posting over 300 videos and Barack Obama posting over 1,800 videos. The music video \\"Yes We Can\\" by will.i.am demonstrates user-generated publicity for the 2008 Presidential Campaign. The video depicts many celebrities as well as black and white clips of Barack Obama. This music video inspired many parodies and won an Emmy for Best New Approaches in Daytime Entertainment.Wallsten, Kevin (2010). \\"Yes We Can\\": How Online Viewership, Blog Discussion, Campaign Statements, and Mainstream Media Coverage Produced a Viral Video Phenomenon, Journal of Information Technology and Politics. The proliferation of viral videos in the 2008 campaign highlights the fact that people increasingly turn to the internet to receive their news. In a study for the Pew Research Center in 2008, approximately 2% of the participants said that they received their news from non-traditional sources such as MySpace or YouTube. The campaign was widely seen as an example of the growing influence of the internet on United States politics, a point further evidenced by the founding of viral video producers like Brave New Films. During the 2012 United States presidential election, ‚ÄúObama Style‚Äú and ‚ÄúMitt Romney Style‚Äù, the parodies of Gangnam Style, both peaked on Election Day and received approximately 30 million views within one month before Election Day. ‚ÄúMitt Romney Style‚Äù, which negatively portrays Mitt as an affluent, extravagant, and arrogant businessman, received an order of magnitude views more than ‚ÄùObama Style‚Äù.  Financial implications  The web traffic gained by viral videos allows for advertising revenue. The YouTube website is monetized by selling and showing advertising. According to the New York Times, YouTube uses an algorithm called \\"reference rank\\" to evaluate the viral potential of videos posted to the site. Using evidence from as few as 10,000 views, it can assess the probability that the video will go viral. If it deems the video a viable candidate for advertising, it contacts the original poster by e-mail and offers a profit-sharing contract. By this means, such videos as \\"David After Dentist\\" have earned more than $100,000 for their owners. One successful YouTube video creator, Andrew Grantham, whose \\"Ultimate Dog Tease\\" had been viewed more than 170,000,000 times (as of June 2015), entered an agreement with Paramount Pictures in February 2012 for the development of a feature film. The film was to be written by Alec Berg and David Mandel.McNary, Dave (13 February 2012). \\"Paramount inks scribe duo for canine romp: Project based on YouTube 'Dog Tease' video\\" . Variety.

Murals  The bridge has thirty concrete nine-foot obelisk-lampposts that feature trompe l'oeil still-life paintings by AlbanyMural Ltd . The Hudson River Way paintings were awarded the Americans for the Arts Public Art Network Award in 2004 for exceptional quality. Sponsored by individuals and organizations, each mural depicts a historical period or event in Albany's history, from prehistoric times to the present. Many of the paintings are based on archaeological artifacts in area museums. Research for the composition of the paintings took 18 months and involved dozens of experts and historians from across the Capital District. The paintings themselves took two years to complete and were executed by principal artist Jan-Marie Spanard and assistant artist Koren Lazarou. The paintings are made of a permanent pigment called potassium silicate. This same material has been used on exterior architecture in Western Europe since the mid-19th century and around the world in the past half-century. Very few American artists create paintings with potassium silicate mineral coatings, but these are the only pigments that can be applied to a stone or concrete substrate that will last indefinitely without fading or lifting from the surface.

It was created as an alternative to the use of a meta compiler such as found in the signals and slots implementation in Qt. libsigc++ originated as part of the gtkmm project in 1997 and later was rewritten to be a standalone library. Each signal has a particular function profile which designates the number of arguments and argument type associated with the callback. Functions and methods are then wrapped using template calls to produce function objects (functors) which can be bound to a signal. Each signal can be connected to multiple functors thus creating an observer pattern through which a message can be distributed to multiple anonymous listener objects. Reference counting based object lifespan tracking was used to disconnect the functors from signals as objects are deleted. The use of templates allowed for compile time typesafe verification of connections. The addition of this strict compile time checking required the addition of template typecasting adapters which convert the functor callback profile to match the required signal pattern. libsigc++ was a natural expansion of the C++ standard library functors to the tracking of objects necessary to implement the observer pattern. It inspired multiple C++ template based signal and slot implementations including the signal implementation used in the boost C++ libraries. libsigc++ is released as free software under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

A number of outstanding patriots, pioneers, and other notables of the Jewish faith who made important contributions to the history and freedom of America during the Colonial and Revolutionary period were interred here, and for this reason, in 1959, by an act of Congress, the burial ground was designated as a unit of the Independence National Historical Park, while continuing to be maintained by the sponsoring Congregation Mikveh Israel.Federal Register Doc. 59-2549, Filed March 25, 1959 The cemetery was certified by the Philadelphia Historical Commission, and in 1971, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form, Entry Number 71.6.42.0041 6/24/71 The site is , less than in size, and is located in the Washington Square West neighborhood, in the center city section of Philadelphia, about mi west and mi south of Independence Hall. History Mikveh Israel Cemetery was originally a private burial ground for the family of Nathan Levy. In 1738, one of Levy's children died. Rather than bury the child in unsanctified ground, he applied to John Penn (chief of Pennsylvania's proprietary government at that time) for \\"a small piece of ground\\" with permission to make it a family cemetery. This property was at the corner of 9th and Walnut Streets, the present site of the Walnut Street Theatre. Two years later, Nathan Levy secured a larger plot from the Penn family at the present location of Mikveh Israel Cemetery. This was meant to be a permanent burial ground for the entire Jewish community of Philadelphia. Levy was buried there upon his death in 1753. The cemetery in 1740 was a 30' x 30' plot. In 1752, Nathan Levy received an additional grant of land north of the first plot. In 1765, John Penn granted Mathias Bush an adjacent piece of ground for burial purposes. By that time, the burial place was managed by the Sephardic synagogue Congregation Mikveh Israel (official name: ◊ß◊î◊ú ◊ß◊ì◊ï◊© ◊û◊ß◊ï◊î ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú, Kahal Kadosh Mikveh Israel, or \\"Holy Congregation Hope of Israel\\"), founded in 1740 and still active in the 21st century. In 1791, the Congregation appointed trustees for the burial ground, and in 1793, the Levy family recognized the right of the Congregatin Mikveh Israel to the Spruce Street Cemetery. However the dissensions among the descendants of the buried still disputed the right of ownership, until April 14, 1828, when the Legislature passed an act giving the burial ground to the Jews of Philadelphia, with the names of the trustees affixed to the petition. After the purchase of the Federal Street Cemetery, the burials on Spruce Street had almost ceased, the last recorded one being Hetty Pesoa, July 3, 1886.

They include: *Nathan Levy (1704‚Äì1753), a merchant, he was the founder of the Jewish community of Philadelphia and established first Mikveh Israel Cemetery. Born in New York City, he moved to Philadelphia at a young age where he would engage in business with David Franks, under the firm name of Levy & Franks, this being the first Jewish business-house in Philadelphia. Levy's ship, Myrtilla, was long reputed to have transported the Liberty Bell from England to Philadelphia in 1752 (though the Hibernia, captained by William Child, is more likely to have transported the bell). *Haym Solomon (1740‚Äì1785), Polish-born patriot and financier of the American Revolution, arrived in New York in 1772, joined the Sons of Liberty, one of George Washington's personal friends, captured and sentenced to death by the British in 1776, used his knowledge of German (he spoke eight languages) to convince his Hessian jailer to escape with him to Philadelphia, where he arrived penniless. *Michael Gratz (1740‚Äì1811), signed the Maryland's Resolution of Non-Importation of 1765 to protest the Stamp Act, and, with his brother Barnard Gratz, encouraged the opening of the West to settlement. *Jacob Gratz (1790‚Äì1856), son of Michael Gratz, served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and State Senate, veteran of the War of 1812. *Rebecca Gratz (1781‚Äì1869), daughter of Michael Gratz, noted for her philanthropy, regarded as the model for the character Rebecca in Walter Scott's Ivanhoe, and the first Jewish female college student in the United States (at Franklin College, later part of Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania). *Aaron Levy, founder of Aaronsburg, Centre County, Pennsylvania in 1786. Named for him, Aaronsburg is the first town in Pennsylvania (and probably in the entire United States) that was planned by and named after a Jew. He was also a known benefactor of Christian churches there. A pioneer and fur trader, he was a close friend and financial supporter of Haym Salomon. *Benjamin Nones (1757‚Äì1826), born in France, he served on the staffs of both General Washington and General Lafayette. While still a private under Count Pulaski, he received a letter of commendation in 1779 written by Captain Verdier, a splendid testimonial to his courage. He fought in almost every action in the Carolinas. Nones became a Major of the Hebrew Legion of 400 men attached to Johann de Kalb‚Äôs command.

Such processes, if they existed, would have the effect of reducing the weight of an object. The shape of the shielded region would be similar to a shadow from the gravitational shield. For example, the shape of the shielded region above a disk would be conical. The height of the cone's apex above the disk would vary directly with the height of the shielding disk above the earth. Experimental evidence to date indicates that no such effect exists. Gravitational shielding is considered to be a violation of the equivalence principle and therefore inconsistent with both Newtonian theory and general relativity.Bertolami, O. & Paramos, J. & Turyshev, S. G. (2006), General Theory of Relativity: Will it survive the next decade?, in H. Dittus, C. Laemmerzahl, S. Turyshev, Lasers, Clocks, and Drag-Free: Technologies for Future Exploration in Space and Tests of Gravity: 27-67 The concept of gravity shielding is a common concept in science fiction literature, especially for space travel. One of the first and best known examples is the fictional gravity shielding substance \\"Cavorite\\" that appears in H. G. Wells's classic 1901 novel The First Men in the Moon. Wells was promptly criticized for using it by Jules Verne. \\"I sent my travelers to the moon with gunpowder, something one sees every day. Where is Monsieur Wells' 'Cavorite'? Let him show it to me!\\"  Tests of the equivalence principle  , no experiment was successful in detecting positive shielding results. To quantify the amount of shielding, at the beginning of 20th century Quirino Majorana suggested an extinction coefficient h that modifies Newton's gravitational force law as follows: : F = \\\\frac{GMm}{r^2} e^{-h \\\\int \\\\rho(r) dr} The best laboratory measurements have established an upper bound limit for shielding of 4.3√ó10‚àí15 m¬≤/kg. Another recent analysis suggested a lower bound of 0.6√ó10‚àí15.Caputo M., On new limits of the coefficient of gravitation shielding,J. Astrophysics and Astronomy,vol. 27, 439-441 (2006). The best estimate based on the most accurate gravity anomaly data during the 1997 solar eclipse has provided a new constraint on the shielding parameter 6√ó10‚àí19 m¬≤/kg. However, astronomical observations impose much more stringent limits. Based on lunar observations available in 1908, Poincar√©Poincar√©, H. (1908). \\"La dynamique de l'√©lectron\\", Revue g√©n√©rale des sciences pures et appliqu√©es 19, pp. 386-402, reprinted in Science and Method. Flammarion, Paris. An English translation was published as Foundation of Science, Science Press, New York, 1929. established that h can be no greater than 10‚àí18 m¬≤/kg. Subsequently, this bound has been greatly improved. Eckhardt showed that lunar ranging data implies an upper bound of 10‚àí22 m¬≤/kg, and Williams, et al.,Williams, et al., ‚ÄúTesting the Equivalence Principle on the Ground and in Space‚Äù, (2006), to be published by Springer Verlag, Lecture Notes in Physics, gr-qc/0507083 have improved this to h = (3 ¬± 5)√ó10‚àí22 m¬≤/kg. Note that the value is smaller than the uncertainty. The consequence of the negative results of those experiments (which are in good agreement with the predictions of general relativity) is, that every theory which contains shielding effects like Le Sage's theory of gravitation, must reduce those effects to an undetectable level. For a review of the current experimental limits on possible gravitational shielding, see the survey article by Bertolami, et al. Also, for a discussion of recent observations during solar eclipses, see the paper by Unnikrishnan et al.Unnikrishnan, Mohapatra, Gillies (2002), ‚ÄúAnomalous gravity data during the 1997 total solar eclipse do not support the hypothesis of gravitational shielding‚Äù, Physical Review D, vol 63, available online at  Majorana's experiments and Russell's criticism  Some shielding experiments were conducted in the early 20th century by Quirino Majorana.Martins, R. A., 2002. \\"Majorana's experiments on gravitational absorption \\", in: Pushing Gravity: New Perspectives on Le Sage's Theory of Gravitation (ed. Edwards, M. R.), Apeiron, Montreal, pp. 219-238. Majorana claimed to have measured positive shielding effects. Henry Norris Russell's analysis of the tidal forces showed that Majorana's positive results had nothing to do with gravitational shielding.Russell, H.N. (1921). ‚ÄúOn Majorana's theory of gravitation‚Äù. Astrophys. J. 54, 334-346. To bring Majorana's experiments in accordance with the equivalence principle of General Relativity he proposed a model, in which the mass of a body is diminished by the proximity of another body, but he denied any connection between gravitational shielding and his proposal of mass variation. For another explanation of Majorana's experiments, see Co√Øsson et al.Co√Øsson, R.; Mambriani, G.; Podini, P. \\"A new interpretation of Quirino Majorana's experiments on gravitation and a proposal for testing his results\\", Il Nuovo Cimento B, vol. 117, Issue 04, p.469. But Majorana's results couldn't be confirmed up to this day (see the section above) and Russell's mass variation theory, although meant as a modification of general relativity, is inconsistent with standard physics as well.  Minority views  The consensus view of the scientific community is that gravitational shielding does not exist, but there have been occasional investigations into this topic, such as the 1999 NASA-funded paper which reported negative results.R. Koczor and D. Noever, Fabrication of Large Bulk Ceramic Superconductor Disks for Gravity Modification Experiments and Performance of YBCO Disks Under e.m. Field Excitation, NASA Marshall, Huntsville, AL, AIAA 99-2147, 35th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference, 20‚Äì24 June 1999, Los Angeles, CA.Space.com on NASA funding Eugene Podkletnov claimed in two papers, one of which he later withdrew, that objects held above a magnetically-levitated, superconducting, rotating disc underwent a reduction of between 0.5 and 2% in weight. Theoreticians have attempted to reconcile Podkletnov's claims with quantum gravity theory.

Bingham first discovered Llaqtapata in 1912. \\"We found evidence that some Inca chieftain had built his home here and had included in the plan ten or a dozen buildings.\\" Bingham locates the site \\"on top of a ridge between the valleys of the Aobamba and the Salcantay, about 5,000 feet above the estate of Huaquina.\\" \\"Here we discovered a number of ruins and two or three modern huts. The Indians said that the place was called Llacta Pata.\\" Bingham did not investigate the ruins thoroughly, however, and they were not studied again for another 70 years. A mid-2003 study of the site conducted by Hugh Thomson and Gary Ziegler concluded that the location of Llaqtapata along the Inca trail suggested that it was an important rest stop and roadside shrine on the journey to Machu Picchu. This and subsequent investigations have revealed an extensive complex of structures and features related to and connected with Machu Picchu by a continuation of the Inca Trail leading onward into the Vilcabamba. Llaqtapata may have been a member of the network of interrelated administrative and ceremonial sites which supported the regional center at Machu Picchu.

Life and career Davidson was born at Kirkhill, in the parish of Ellon, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on 25 AprilR. A. Riesen, Criticism and Faith in Late Victorian Scotland London 1985 1831\\\\. He was educated initially at the Aberdeen Grammar school under Dr MelvinR A Riesen, Criticism and Faith in Late Victorian Scotland,London 1985, p. 259 and afterwards at the University of Aberdeen, graduating in 1849. Following graduation he took the position of teacher in the Free Church school in Ellon and while in that position taught himself French, German, Dutch and Spanish in addition to the classical languages he already knew.R A Riesen, Criticism and Faith, p. 259. He entered New College, Edinburgh, in 1852, to study for the ministry, and was licensed in 1857. While a student in 1854 he went during the vacation to study under Heinrich Ewald in the University of G√∂ttingen.F A Dalrymple-Hamilton personal research for new biography. Following his licensing in 1857 he became a missioner first in Carstairs Junction/Village and later in Craigsmill, near Blairgowrie, thereafter a Probationer Minister in Gilcomston Free Church under the ministry of Dr MacGilvary for a period of six months.J. Strahan, Andrew Bruce Davidson, London 1917, p. 72. In 1858, Davidson became Hebrew tutor in New College, with the express purpose of teaching the Hebrew language to the first class.R A Riesen, p. 261. During this appointment he produced his first book on the Hebrew language in 1861 \\"Outlines of Hebrew Accentuation\\" which was followed later during his professorship by an Elementary Hebrew Grammar (1st ed., 1874) and his Hebrew Syntax (1894).R A Riesen,p. 261. It is important to note that an examination of his Hebrew Syntax reveals that Davidson had an intimate knowledge of the comparative syntax of Syriac and Aramaic, Arabic, Ethiopic and Assyrian.J. Strahan, Andrew Bruce Davidson, London 1917, p. 126. In 1862 his first book on Job (chapters 1‚Äì14) was published by Williams & Norgate, despite the fact that he never finished this project, it was still classed as, \\"the first really scientific commentary on the Old Testament in the English language.\\"R A Riesen, p. 261. When, in the following year, the chair of Hebrew fell vacant, Davidson was appointed professor by the unanimous vote of the Free Church Assembly. In 1871 he was chosen to be one of the Old Testament revision committee‚Äîa position he held until 1884, which resulted in the publication of the Old Testament section of the Revised Version of the Bible in 1885. As far as his teaching in New College, Edinburgh is concerned, most of it was published after his death in volumes entitled, 'Biblical and literary Essays,' 'Old Testament Prophecy,' and 'The Theology of the Old Testament.'J. Strahan, 'The Writings of the Late Professor A B Davidson,' The Expository Times, vol. 15 (103‚Äì1904), pp. 450‚Äì455. He understood it to be the first duty of an exegete to ascertain the meaning of the writer, and he showed that this could be done by the use of grammar and history and the historical imagination. He supplied guidance when it was much needed as to the methods and results of the higher criticism. Being a master of its methods, but very cautious in accepting assertions about its results,Personal conversation with Professor W. McKane he secured attention early in the Free Church for scientific criticism, and yet threw the whole weight of his learning and his caustic wit into the argument against critical extravagance. He had thought himself into the ideas and points of view of the Hebrews, and his work in Old Testament theology is unrivalled.  Development of his critical views It is a moot question as to how and when Davidson's critical views on the authorship of the Pentateuch actually evolved. It is equally a moot question as to what these actually were. At the beginning of his teaching career he wrote in defence of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch.'The Recent introductions to the Old Testament.' The British and Foreign Evangelical Review, vol 10, 1861, p.762 However, by 1863 he had retreated to a partial Mosaic authorship in a further article in the same journal.'Recent Attacks on the Pentateuch ‚Äì Davidson and Colenso,' The British and Foreign Evangelical Review, vol 12, 1863, p.391. From the notes of lectures taken by one of his students, namely, Henry Drummond it is clear that Davidson was then discoursing to his class on Pentateuchal criticism, but with a leaning to more conservative positions. In fact Drummond had recorded that, 'Davidson did not then take his students beyond the positions reached by Ewald.'George Adam Smith, A Life of Henry Drummond, London 1899, p. 43f.(For a detailed analysis of Ewald's views on the authorship of the Pentateuch see J. Rogerson, 'Old Testament Criticism in the Nineteenth Century,' London 1984, p. 94f.)The Next piece of evidence comes from Davidson's review of Delitzsch's Neuer Commentar ≈±ber Genesis and Dillmann's Numeri, Deuteronomium, und Joshua which is regarded by Strahan as 'important as perhaps the first indication of his accepting Wellhausen's general position, which he is careful to guard against misconception and exaggeration.'J. Strachan, 'The Writings of the Late Professor A.B. Davidson, Expository Times, vol 15 October 1903 ‚Äì September 1904, p. 452. In the first of those reviews he stated that, 'the improbability of Moses having given one system of laws (Exodus chaps. 20ff.)at Sinai and another so very different (Deuteronomy) on the plains of Moab; and the impossibility of conceiving of Deuteronomy as extant in the days of the judges and early monarchy. In the second on the work of Dillmann he noted that, 'he is dissatisfied with that scholar's theory of the origin for the Priestly code in the eighth century and leans to a later date.'George Adam Smith, 'The Late Professor A.B. Davidson, The Biblical World, vol 20, no 3 1902, p. 176. These briefs comments are the only published explicit statements that Davidson ever made. In this paragraph reference was made to a course which Davidson had given on Pentateuchal criticism‚Äîit is a matter of regret that the manuscript of that course was never published, nor had it survived in any other form; otherwise the views of Davidson could be culled from it. What we do know of the contents of that course comes from the biography of Henry Drummond, which states that, 'Besides the grammar, Dr Davidson then gave to the First Year a few lectures introductory to the Higher Criticism of the Pentateuch. It was by such lectures that Dr Davidson started in the early seventies the great movement of Old Testament study which has characterised Scottish Theology during the last thirty years. He did not then take his students beyond the positions reached by Ewald; but that was sufficient to break up the mechanical ideas of inspiration which then prevailed in the churches, while, with the teacher's own wonderful insight into the spiritual meaning of Scripture, it made the student's own use of his Bible more rational and lively, and laid upon a sounder basis the proof of a real revelation in the Old Testament.'George Adam Smith, 'The Life of Henry Drummond,'London 1899, pp. 43‚Äì44. The final question which may be asked on this topic is did Davidson ever accept in full the tenets of the documentary theory of the origin of the Pentateuch? The answer to that question, in as far as it can be answered is that they did not. There are two reasons for this answer, the first of which is that he had studied as was noted earlier under Heinrich Ewald, who had revived Wellhausen's interest in the Hebrew language and history in his teaching, but Ewald never accepted the basis of the documentary hypothesis. The second reason has been reported by Professor Andrew Harper who stated that, 'Consequently, though he recognised the greatness of scholars like Wellhausen, he was never affected by the Wellhausen or other orthodoxies which soon grew up in the critical schools.J. Strahan, 'Andrew Bruce Davidson,' London 1917, p. 113. Finally, it is a fact that, 'he remained sceptical and even sarcastic of the finer distinctions, to which so many critics have carried literary analysis within the limits of the four main Pentateuchal documents.'George Adam Smith, 'The Late Professor A.B. Davidson,' The Biblical World, Vol 20 No 3 1902, p.177. A piece of supportive evidence which should be considered is the fact that in a recently published collection of the letters written by Julius Wellhausen to various correspondents around the world not one was ever written to Andrew Bruce Davidson, whereas some 118 were written to and in support of William Roberston Smith.Rudolf Smend, 'Julius Wellhausen Briefe,' Mohr Siebeck 2013, p. 881. It should be further noted that the only Davidson mentioned in Smend's collection is that of Professor Samuel Davidson, to whom 2 letters were addressed.  Publication and editing controversies A further matter connected with the publication of his writings is that following the publication of a list of his writings a dispute broke out between the compiler of that list James Strachan and Professor J A Paterson who had edited a number of his manuscripts for posthumous publication. This dispute took two forms, firstly on the question of the editing itself and secondly relating to the order of the lectures as originally given by Davidson on his lecture room. On the first matter, namely, the poor quality of the editing, this charge would appear to be justified, since in his biography Strahan has noted that, 'no lecture of Professor Davidson's was finer than the one on \\"False Prophecy.\\" It was ultimately published in the Expositor in 1895. But in the posthumous Old Testament Prophecy an ancient and inferior manuscript has again been palmed off upon the innocent reader, while the perfect Expositor article is left in obscurity.'J. Strahan, 'Andrew Bruce Davidson, London 1917, pp 210‚Äì211. This judgement has been confirmed by Professor G.W. Anderson.Personal conversation with F.A. Dalrymple-Hamilton. The second cause for dispute is slightly more interesting, since it concerns the order of the lectures that Davidson had given in his lecture room. Strachan has noted that, 'Dr Davidson was above everything else a lecturer on Hebrew prophecy. he gave his students a new and inspiring conception of the real nature of Prophecy and its function in the history of Revelation. I fear that many of them will read the posthumous Old Testament Prophecy with a sense of disappointment. They will protest that this is not the Old Testament Prophecy to which they listened. The difference is not merely the absence of the living voice ... the course itself is altered.'J. Strachan, 'The Writings of the Late Professor A.B. Davidson,' p. 453. The question that remains why had Paterson altered the order of the course that Davidson had taught? The answer is that both of these scholars had been students of Professor Davidson, but at different times. Paterson had been a student of Professor Davidson in 1874, whereas Strachan had been a student in 1884. In Paterson's time the main focus had been on a course of lectures dealing with Pentateuchal criticism as noted by Henry Drummond above. Whereas, when Strachan had been a student the course had been altered to be a course on Old Testament Prophecy, about which Paterson had no knowledge whatsoever. The reason for this was that when the troubles arose over the Robertson Smith case, Davidson dropped the former course and replaced it with one on Old Testament Prophecy. George Adam Smith had noted about this that, 'Yet, after the controversy on Robertson Smith's articles broke out, Davidson dropped his lectures on the Pentateuch‚Äîthey were not given to his students in the later seventies‚Äîand did not resume till nine years later.'George Adam Smith, 'The Late Professor A.B. Davidson,'p. 176. The reason that Davidson gave for concentrating on the eighth century prophets was that with these writings we were on historical ground.George Adam Smith, 'The Late Professor A.B. Davidson,'p. 176. Death He died at home, Corrennie GardensEdinburgh Post Office directory 1901 in Edinburgh on 26 January 1902. He is buried in Grange Cemetery on the south side of the city. The grave lies on the southern edge of the north-west quadrant, backing onto the embankment over the central vaults.  General assessment of his teaching Davidson was above all a great teacher of Hebrew grammar and syntax and it is to his credit that his grammar is till in print today having now reached its 27th edition, which was published in 1993 having been revised by Dr James Martin. The syntax is also still in print having now reached its fourth edition and was published in 1994 having been revised by Professor J.C.L. Gibson. His work was recognised by several honorary distinctions, LL.D. (Aberdeen), D.D. (Edinburgh), Litt.D. (Cambridge).

Back in England on 7 June 2005, the UK Dream Team defeated \\"The Chippendales\\", Mikey Whiplash (Michael Gilbert) and Johnny Midnight, to be recognized by All Star Promotions as the British Tag Team Champions. Allmark went on to renew his feud with Robbie Dynamite and after months of rapidly intensifying rivalry, things came to a head when Allmark defeated Dynamite in January 2006 for his All Star British Mid-Heavyweight title, making Allmark a double champion in the promotion. Dynamite fought back though (with the aid of \\"Chippendale\\" Mikey Whiplash) and defeated the UK Dream Team on 25 February 2006 in Staffordshire to win the British Tag Team titles. Allmark was hospitalised after the match with a gash to the head that needed nine stitches. Allmark commented on the situation between the him and Dynamite on All Star's website writing; Allmark tried to return to action in March 2006 only for the wound to re-open. He had to go back to hospital for more treatment. It was later announced that Dynamite and Allmark would meet in a no-holds-barred match on 18 March at the Victoria Hall in Hanley. However, this match never took place because only hours before the event Allmark received news that his 18-month-old son had been taken ill. The two rivals repeatedly met in matches throughout the rest of 2006, many of which were for Allmark's Mid-Heavyweight title. Dynamite finally defeated Allmark for the title in 2007.vIn 2006, Allmark became the head trainer at the All Star Wrestling school. On 1 September 2010, Allmark wrestled for Dragon Gate Pro Wrestling in St.Ives (DG:UK \\"Invasion 2\\"). There he defeated fellow British wrestler Stixx with a Spanish Fly Shiranui Kai. On 10 July 2010, Allmark wrestled for IPW:UK's Summer Sizzler which in Sittingbourne to compete in the quarter final Of the IPW:UK Cruiserweight Championship Tournament. He went on to defeat Max Angleus with a single man Spanish Fly but mainly known as a Shiranui Kai. Allmark is now in the semi finals of the tournament which should be held at the next IPW:UK show. On 3 December 2011, Allmark made his debut for PCW - Preston City Wrestling, taking on the former UKFF number one, Dave Mastiff. This show also featured Desmond Wolfe's return to a UK ring. Allmark next appeared for PCW on 24 February, taking part in a 4-way Cruiserweight match against Noam Dar, Joey Hayes and Zack Sabre, Jr. On 20 February 2013 Dean won a rumble match. His reward was to choose a partner on 10 April 2013 to face Robbie Dynamite and Rampage Brown in the first ever cage match in Gravesend. They won the match. Through ASW's relationship with Wrestle-1, Allmark made his debut for the Japanese promotion on 6 July 2014, losing the British Light Heavyweight Championship to Seiki Yoshioka. He regained the title from Yoshioka back in the United Kingdom on August 19.

He was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the seventh round of the 2001 NFL Draft. He played college football at Michigan State. He is currently the Defensive Backs Coach for the Broncos. Early years Hill attended Chadsey High School in Detroit, Michigan, where he was a four-year starter at defensive back. He was also named to the school‚Äôs academic honor roll on two occasions. College career Hill was a three-year letterman (1998‚Äì2000) for the Michigan State Spartans, the first two years of which he played under former head coach Nick Saban. Hill started all 35 games in which he played during that time at right cornerback, and concluded his career with 182 total tackles, 11 stops for loss, nine interceptions and 36 passes defensed. Hill had a career-high five interceptions during his first season in 1998. He was an honorable mention All-Big Ten Conference selection the following year when he amassed 57 tackles, an interception and 13 passes defensed. His senior season in 2000, Hill was a second-team All-Big Ten performer in his when he posted 71 tackles, three interceptions, and 11 passes defensed. Professional career=Arizona Cardinals Hill was originally drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the seventh round (202nd overall) in the 2001 NFL Draft. He played in 14 games in his rookie season, including one start, and recorded 22 tackles, three passes defensed and a half-sack. He added five special teams tackles. He had five tackles and the first half-sack of his career on a five-yard sack of Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb. Hill's first pro start came against the New York Giants on December 15. He was inactive for the final two games of the season with a hamstring injury. In 2002 Hill appeared in 14 contests, including seven starts at cornerback, and missed two games with a foot injury. He posted 66 tackles, two interceptions, 10 passes defensed, a sack and two fumble recoveries on the year, while also contributing 11 stops on special teams. He collected a season-high 10 tackles against the San Diego Chargers when he came off bench in first quarter to replace an injured Duane Starks. Hill went on to start each of the next four games in Starks‚Äô spot. In 16-13 win against the Carolina Panthers on October 6, he recovered a pair of Panthers fumbles - the first Cardinal to do that since Michael Bankston on October 17, 1993. Hill's first career interception came against the Dallas Cowboys on October 20 when he picked off a Quincy Carter pass in the end zone during Arizona‚Äôs 9-6 win. He recorded an eight-yard sack of Marc Bulger against the St. Louis Rams, which was the first full sack of his career. Hill also intercepted a Jeff Garcia pass in the fourth quarter against the San Francisco 49ers on December 21. Hill started all 14 games in which he played at cornerback in 2003, posting 67 tackles, five interceptions for 119 yards in returns including a touchdown, seven passes defensed, two sacks and a forced fumble. His interception ranked second on the team behind only Dexter Jackson's six. Hill missed two games during the season with a sprained ankle. During the season, Hill intercepted a pair of Marc Bulger passes in one game, including one returned 70 yards for a score. He also picked off Quincy Carter, Jon Kitna and Trent Dilfer during the season. His two sacks came against Bulger and Kitna. Hill played in 13 games in 2004 with ten starts at cornerback, and was inactive for three contests in 2004. On the year, he collected 46 tackles, an interception, nine passes defensed, a sack and a forced fumble. His lone interception of the year occurred on October 24 against the Seattle Seahawks, as he picked off a Matt Hasselbeck pass in the Cardinals‚Äô 25-17 victory. His only sack of the season came against then-Rams quarterback Chris Chandler. Oakland Raiders As an unrestricted free agent in 2005, Hill signed a one-year contract with the Oakland Raiders. The deal included a base salary of $565,000 and a $25,000 signing bonus. It was also heavily based on incentives, which could have allowed Hill to earn as much as $1.4 million. Hill played in all 16 games during his lone season with the Raiders, opening three games at free safety and ten contests as the nickel cornerback behind Charles Woodson and Nnamdi Asomugha. He recorded 89 tackles, an interception and five passes defensed on the year, while also tallying three special teams stops. His only interception of the year came against the Cleveland Browns on December 18 when he snared a Charlie Frye pass. Miami Dolphins On March 16, 2006 Hill agreed to a three-year deal with the Miami Dolphins. The contract was worth $6 million and included a $2 million signing bonus. The move reunited him with then-Dolphins head coach Nick Saban, who was the head coach at Michigan State during Hill's first two seasons with the Spartans. Thanks in part to the contract holdout of rookie defensive back Jason Allen, Hill was able to win the starting free safety job before the regular season began. He went on to start all 16 games for the Dolphins in 2006 and finished third on the team (behind linebackers Zach Thomas and Channing Crowder) with 83 tackles. Hill also had two interceptions, which tied him with Jason Taylor for the team lead, and a fumble recovery he returned for a touchdown. Hill picked off Detroit Lions quarterback Jon Kitna and Chicago Bears quarterback Rex Grossman during the season (both in wins by the Dolphins). He also returned a Chester Taylor fumble forced by Matt Roth 48 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter of a 24-20 win over the Minnesota Vikings. During training camp, Hill initially lost his job to recently signed free agent Chris Crocker. Eventually, though the secondary was exposed during the first two weeks particularly in Week 2 against the Arizona Cardinals, giving up pass plays of 50 or more yards. In Week 3, Hill got the free safety job once again, and it paid huge dividends as the secondary play became more solid and it also helped Miami earn its first victory of the season against the Patriots. Renaldo Hill also proved to be solid in run support, finishing with 74 tackles. He nabbed three interceptions. Denver Broncos On February 27, 2009, Hill signed a four-year, $10 million contract with the Denver Broncos. The contract included $3 million guaranteed. Hill played in Denver for two seasons before being released on July 30, 2011.Broncos release Renaldo Hill Hill ended his career with a total of 596 tackles, 6.5 sacks, and 19 interceptions.Renaldo Hill transitions from NFL player to Wyoming graduate assistant Personal life Renaldo is the younger brother of Ray Hill, who also played at Michigan State and with the Dolphins as well (1998‚Äì2000).Broncos' Renaldo Hill fashioned by his family They are the third set of brothers to have played for the Dolphins, joining the Blackwoods (safety Glenn, 1979‚Äì87; safety Lyle, 1981‚Äì86) and the Ayanbadejos (fullback Obafemi, 2003; linebacker Brendon, 2003‚Äì04).

Mud logging is usually performed by a third-party mud logging company. This provides well owners and producers with information about the lithology and fluid content of the borehole while drilling. Historically it is the earliest type of well log. Under some circumstances compressed air is employed as a circulating fluid, rather than mud. Although most commonly used in petroleum exploration, mud logging is also sometimes used when drilling water wells and in other mineral exploration, where drilling fluid is the circulating medium used to lift cuttings out of the hole. In hydrocarbon exploration, hydrocarbon surface gas detectors record the level of natural gas brought up in the mud. A mobile laboratory is situated by the mud logging company near the drilling rig or on deck of an offshore drilling rig, or on a drill ship. The service provided Mud logging technicians in an oil field drilling operation determine positions of hydrocarbons with respect to depth, identify downhole lithology, monitor natural gas entering the drilling mud stream, and draw well logs for use by oil company geologist. Rock cuttings circulated to the surface in drilling mud are sampled and discussed. The mud logging company is normally contracted by the oil company (or operator). They then organize this information in the form of a graphic log, showing the data charted on a representation of the wellbore.[1] Well-site geologist mudlogging The oil company representative (Company Man or \\"CoMan\\") together with the tool pusher, and well-site geologist (WSG) provides mud loggers their instruction. The mud logging company is contracted specifically as to when to start well-logging activity and what services to provide. Mud logging may begin on the first day of drilling, known as the \\"spud in\\" date but is more likely at some later time (and depth) determined by the oil industry geologist's research. The mud logger may also possess logs from wells drilled in the surrounding area. This information (known as \\"offset data\\") can provide valuable clues as to the characteristics of the particular geo-strata that the rig crew is about to drill through. Mud loggers connect various sensors to the drilling apparatus and install specialized equipment to monitor or \\"log\\" drill activity. This can be physically and mentally challenging, especially when having to be done during drilling activity. Much of the equipment will require precise calibration or alignment by the mud logger to provide accurate readings. Mud logging technicians observe and interpret the indicators in the mud returns during the drilling process, and at regular intervals log properties such as drilling rate, mud weight, flowline temperature, oil indicators, pump pressure, pump rate, lithology (rock type) of the drilled cuttings, and other data. Mud logging requires a good deal of diligence and attention. Sampling the drilled cuttings must be performed at predetermined intervals, and can be difficult during rapid drilling. Another important task of the mud logger is to monitor gas levels (and types) and notify other personnel on the rig when gas levels may be reaching dangerous levels, so appropriate steps can be taken to avoid a dangerous well blowout condition. Because of the lag time between drilling and the time required for the mud and cuttings to return to the surface, a modern augmentation has come into use: Measurement while drilling. The MWD technician, often a separate service company employee, logs data in a similar manner but the data is different in source and content. Most of the data logged by an MWD technician comes from expensive and complex, sometimes electronic, tools that are downhole installed at or near the drill bit. Scope 1\\" (5 foot average) mud log showing heavy (hydrocarbons) (large area of yellow) Mud logging includes observation and microscopic examination of drill cuttings (formation rock chips), and evaluation of gas hydrocarbon and its constituents, basic chemical and mechanical parameters of drilling fluid or drilling mud (such as chlorides and temperature), as well as compiling other information about the drilling parameters. Then data is plotted on a graphic log called a mud log. Example1, Example2. Other real-time drilling parameters that may be compiled include, but are not limited to; rate of penetration (ROP) of the bit (sometimes called the drill rate), pump rate (quantity of fluid being pumped), pump pressure, weight on bit, drill string weight, rotary speed, rotary torque, RPM (Revolutions Per Minute), SPM (Strokes Per Minute) mud volumes, mud weight and mud viscosity. This information is usually obtained by attaching monitoring devices to the drilling rig's equipment with a few exceptions such as the mud weight and mud viscosity which are measured by the derrickhand or the mud engineer. Rate of drilling is affected by the pressure of the column of mud in the borehole and its relative counterbalance to the internal pore pressures of the encountered rock. A rock pressure greater than the mud fluid will tend to cause rock fragments to spall as it is cut and can increase the drilling rate. \\"D-exponents\\" are mathematical trend lines which estimate this internal pressure. Thus both visual evidence of spalling and mathematical plotting assist in formulating recommendations for optimum drilling mud densities for both safety (blowout prevention) and economics. (Faster drilling is generally preferred.) 1\\" (every foot) mud log showing corrected d-Exponent trending into pressure above the sand Mud logging is often written as a single word \\"mudlogging\\". The finished product can be called a \\"mud log\\" or \\"mudlog\\". The occupational description is \\"mud logger\\" or \\"mudlogger\\". In most cases, the two word usage seems to be more common. The mud log provides a reliable time log of drilled formations.P.W. Purcell \\"Chapter 16 Mud Logging\\" pp. 347-354 in L.W. Leroy, D.O. Leroy, and J.W. Raese, editors, 1977, Subsurface Geology, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, 941 pp.  Details of the mud log  *The rate of penetration in (Figure 1 & 2) is represented by the black line on the left side of the log. The farther to the left that the line goes, the faster the rate of penetration. On this mud log, ROP is measured in feet per hour but on some older, hand drawn mud logs, it is measured in minutes per foot. *The porosity in (Figure 1) is represented by the blue line farthest to the left of the log. It indicates the pore space within the rock structure. An analogy would be the holes in a sponge. The oil and gas resides within this pore space. Notice how far to the left the porosity goes where all the sand (in yellow) is. This indicates that the sand has good porosity. Porosity is not a direct or physical measurement of the pore space but rather an extrapolation from other drilling parameters and therefore not always reliable. (Figure 3) Sample of drill cuttings of shale while drilling an oil well in Louisiana. For reference, the sand grain and red shale are approximately 2 mm. in dia. *The lithology in (Figure 1 & 2) is represented by the cyan, gray/black and yellow blocks of color. Cyan = lime, gray/black = shale and yellow = sand. More yellow represents more sand identified at that depth. The lithology is measured as percentage of the total sample, as visually inspected under a microscope, normally at 10x magnification (Figure 3). These are but a fraction of the different types of formations that might be encountered. (Color coding is not necessarily standardized among different mud logging companies, though the symbol representation for each are very similar.) In (Figure 3) you can see a sample of cuttings under a microscope at 10x magnification after they have been washed off. Some of the larger shale and lime fragments are separated from this sample by running it through sieves and must be considered when estimating percentages. Also, this image view is only a fragment of the total sample and some of the sand at the bottom of the tray can not be seen and must also be considered in the total estimation. With that in mind this sample would be considered to be about 90% shale, 5% sand and 5% lime (In 5% increments). *The gas in (Figure 1 & 2) is represented by the green line and is measured in units as the quantity of total gas, but does not represent the actual quantity of oil or gas the reservoir contains. In (Figure 1) the squared-off dash-dot lines just to the right of the sand (in yellow) and left of the gas (in green) represents the heavier hydrocarbons detected. Cyan = C2 (ethane), purple = C3 (propane) and blue = C4 (butane). Detecting and analyzing these heavy gases help to determine the type of oil or gas the formation contains.

A free-return trajectory is a trajectory of a spacecraft traveling away from a primary body (for example, the Earth) where gravity due to a secondary body (for example, the Moon) causes the spacecraft to return to the primary body without propulsion (hence the term free).Diagram of the free return .  Earth‚ÄìMoon  The first spacecraft to use a free-return trajectory was the Soviet Luna 3 mission in October 1959. It used the Moon's gravity to send it back towards the Earth so that the photographs it had taken of the far side of the Moon could be downloaded by radio. Symmetrical free-return trajectories were studied by Arthur Schwaniger of NASA in 1963 with reference to the Earth‚ÄìMoon system. He studied cases in which the trajectory at some point crosses at a right angle the line going through the centre of the Earth and the centre of the Moon, and also cases in which the trajectory crosses at a right angle the plane containing that line and perpendicular to the plane of the Moon's orbit. In both scenarios we can distinguish between: * A circumlunar free-return trajectory around the Moon. The spacecraft passes behind the Moon. It moves there in a direction opposite to that of the Moon, or at least slower than the Moon in the same direction. If the craft's orbit begins in a normal (west to east) direction near Earth, then it makes a figure 8 around the Earth and Moon when plotted in a coordinate system that rotates as the Moon goes around the Earth. * A cislunar free-return trajectory. The spacecraft goes beyond the orbit of the Moon, returns to inside the Moon's orbit, moves in front of the Moon while being diverted by the Moon's gravity to a path away from the Earth to beyond the orbit of the Moon again, and is drawn back to Earth by Earth's gravity. (There is no real distinction between these trajectories and similar ones that never go beyond the Moon's orbit, but the latter may not get very close to the Moon, so are not considered as relevant.) In both the circumlunar case and the cislunar case, the craft can be moving generally from west to east around the Earth (co-rotational), or from east to west (counter- rotational). For trajectories in the plane of the Moon's orbit with small periselenum radius (close approach of the Moon), the flight time for a cislunar free-return trajectory is longer than for the circumlunar free-return trajectory with the same periselenum radius. Flight time for a cislunar free- return trajectory decreases with increasing periselenum radius, while flight time for a circumlunar free-return trajectory increases with periselenum radius. The speed at a perigee of 6555 km from the centre of the Earth for trajectories passing between 2000 and 20 000 km from the Moon is between 10.84 and 10.92 km/s regardless of whether the trajectory is cislunar or circumlunar or whether it is co-rotational or counter-rotational.Schwaninger, Fig. 9, p. 16. Using the simplified model where the orbit of the Moon around the Earth is circular, Schwaniger found that there exists a free-return trajectory in the plane of the orbit of the Moon which is periodic. After returning to low altitude above the Earth (the perigee radius is a parameter, typically 6555 km) the spacecraft would start over on the same trajectory. This periodic trajectory is counter-rotational (it goes from east to west when near the Earth). It has a period of about 650 hours (compare with a sidereal month, which is 655.7 hours, or 27.3 days). Considering the trajectory in an inertial (non-rotating) frame of reference, the perigee occurs directly under the Moon when the Moon is on one side of the Earth. Speed at perigee is about 10.91 km/s. After 3 days it reaches the Moon's orbit, but now more or less on the opposite side of the Earth from the Moon. After a few more days, the craft reaches its (first) apogee and begins to fall back toward the Earth, but as it approaches the Moon's orbit, the Moon arrives, and there is a gravitational interaction. The craft passes on the near side of the Moon at a radius of 2150 km (410 km above the surface) and is thrown back outwards, where it reaches a second apogee. It then falls back toward the Earth, goes around to the other side, and goes through another perigee close to where the first perigee had taken place. By this time the Moon has moved almost half an orbit and is again directly over the craft at perigee. Other cislunar trajectories are similar but do not end up in the same situation as at the beginning, so cannot repeat. There will of course be similar trajectories with periods of about two sidereal months, three sidereal months, and so on. In each case, the two apogees will be further and further away from Earth. These were not considered by Schwaniger. This kind of trajectory can occur of course for similar three- body problems; this problem is an example of a circular restricted three-body problem. While in a true free-return trajectory no propulsion is applied, in practice there may be small mid-course corrections or other maneuvers. A free- return trajectory may be the initial trajectory to allow a safe return in the event of a systems failure; this was applied in the Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 11 lunar missions. In such a case a free return to a suitable reentry situation is more useful than returning to near the Earth, but then needing propulsion anyway to prevent moving away from it again. Since all went well, these Apollo missions did not have to take advantage of the free return and inserted into orbit upon arrival at the Moon. The atmospheric entry interface velocity upon return from the Moon is approximately Entry Aerodynamics at Lunar Return Conditions Obtained from the Fliigh of Apollo 4, Ernest R. Hillje, NASA, TN: D-5399, accessed 29 December 2018. whereas the more common spacecraft return velocity from low-Earth orbit (LEO) is approximately . Due to the landing-site restrictions that resulted from constraining the launch to a free return that flew by the Moon, subsequent Apollo missions, starting with Apollo 12 and including the ill-fated Apollo 13, used a hybrid trajectory that launched to a highly elliptical Earth orbit that fell short of the Moon with effectively a free return to the atmospheric entry corridor. They then performed a mid-course maneuver to change to a trans-Lunar trajectory that was not a free return.Hybrid trajectory diagram . This retained the safety characteristics of being on a free return upon launch and only departed from free return once the systems were checked out and the lunar module was docked with the command module, providing back-up maneuver capabilities. In fact, within hours after the accident, Apollo 13 used the lunar module to maneuver from its planned trajectory to a circumlunar free-return trajectory.Stephen Cass, \\"Apollo 13, We Have a Solution\\", IEEE Spectrum, APRIL 2005 (accessed August 6, 2012). Apollo 13 was the only Apollo mission to actually turn around the Moon in a free-return trajectory (however, two hours after perilune, propulsion was applied to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean).  Earth‚ÄìMars  A free-return transfer orbit to Mars is also possible. As with the Moon, this option is mostly considered for crewed missions. Robert Zubrin, in his book The Case for Mars, discusses various trajectories to Mars for his mission design Mars Direct. The Hohmann transfer orbit can be made free-return. It takes 250 days (0.68 years) in the transit to Mars, and in the case of a free- return style abort without the use of propulsion at Mars, 1.5 years to get back to Earth, at a total delta-v requirement of 3.34 km/s. Zubrin advocates a slightly faster transfer, that takes only 180 days to Mars, but 2 years back to Earth in case of an abort. This route comes also at the cost of a higher delta-v of 5.08 km/s. Zubrin writes that faster routes have a significantly higher delta-v cost and free-return duration (e.g. transfer to Mars in 130 days takes 7.93 km/s delta-v and 4 years on the free return), and so he advocates for the 180-day transfer. A free return is also the part of various other mission designs, such as Mars Semi-Direct and Inspiration Mars. There also exists the option of two- or three-year free-returns that do not rely on the gravity of Mars, but are simply transfer orbits with periods of 2 or 1.5 years, respectively. A two-year free return means from Earth to Mars (aborted there) and then back to Earth all in 2 years. The entry corridor (range of permissible path angles) for landing on Mars is limited, and experience has shown that the path angle is hard to fix (e.g. +/- 0.5 deg). This limits entry into the atmosphere to less than 9 km/s. On this assumption, a two-year return is not possible for some years, and for some years a delta-v kick of 0.6 to 2.7 km/s at Mars may be needed to get back to Earth.Wooster et al., op. cit., Table 2. NASA published the Design Reference Architecture 5.0 for Mars in 2009, advocating a 174-day transfer to Mars, which is close to Zubrin's proposed trajectory.Human Exploration of Mars Design Reference Architecture 5.0. It cites a delta-v requirement of approximately 4 km/s for the trans-Mars injection, but does not mention the duration of a free return to Earth.

The Valley Gardens and the nearby Savill Gardens are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Plants They contain unrivalled collections of azaleas, camellias, magnolias and many other spring-flowering shrubs and trees. There are several acres of daffodils. A heather garden of gives pleasure even in winter. History The gardens were planted from 1946 onwards, under the eye of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. It was J.B. Stevenson of Tower Court who urged the selection of the Kurume azaleas for the Punch Bowl and it was his famous collection of rhododendrons which was added to the Gardens in the 1940s after his death. It is worth noting that all this work was undertaken at a time of great austerity. The publicity at the time said, the Gardens \\"always open to the public would provide pleasant hours of relaxation for many a tired worker from factory or office\\". They were and should remain \\"private gardens accessible to the public\\". Proposed developments As the Valley Gardens entered the 21st century, the Crown Estate were proposing to fence Valley Gardens with a 1.7 metre steel deer fence and charge for entry. Many residents from Berkshire and Surrey and all the parishes around Windsor Great Park opposed this scheme. They were joined by a nationwide and international protest from all those who know and love the gardens as a magnificent and unique woodland landscape. The Valley Gardens Action Group were formed to fight these proposals. After an intense campaign,http://www.valleygardens.org.uk the Crown Estate backed down and deferred these plans. The Crown Estate will conduct \\"extended monitoring of horticultural and landscape management issues over the next few years. Other proposals ...such as the provision of a land train, children's adventure play area and closure of the Valley Gardens car park are also subject to further review\\".

The natural chemical balance of grapes is such that they can ferment without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes or other nutrients. Wine is produced by fermenting crushed grapes using various types of yeast. Yeast consumes the sugars found in the grapes and converts them into alcohol. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are used depending on the type of wine being produced. Wine includes the following ingredients: * Ethanol - the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages. It is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid, and also a psychoactive drug. * Fermented grape juice - what wine is made from ** Fermentation - process that turns grape juice into an alcoholic beverage. During fermentation yeast interact with sugars in the juice to create ethanol. ** Grape - fruit that grows on the perennial and deciduous woody vines of the genus Vitis. Grapes can be eaten raw or used for making jam, juice, vinegar, wine, raisins, and grape seed oil. ** Juice - the liquid that is naturally contained in fruit or vegetable tissue. Scientific makeup: * Wine chemistry ** Acids in wine ** Phenolic compounds in wine ** Proteins in wine ** Sugars in wine ** Yeast assimilable nitrogen ** Minerals ** Dissolved gas (CO2) ** Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes ** Glutathione  Types of wine = Wine styles  * Aromatized wine - A fortified wine with added herbs, spices, or flavorings. * Dessert wine - A category of sweet wines served with dessert. * Fortified wine - Fortified wine is a wine that has had a distilled spirit added to it in order to end fermentation, help preservation, or influence flavor. The addition of additional ethanol kills yeast, leaving a wine that is high in sugar and alcohol content. * Fruit wine - Fruit wine is a fermented alcoholic beverage made from a variety of base ingredients and can be made from virtually any plant matter that can be fermented. The fruits used in winemaking are fermented using yeast and aged in wood barrels to improve the taste and flavor quality. * Ice wine - Ice wine is a type of dessert wine made from frozen grapes. Grapes are frozen on the vine around 20 ¬∞F (-7 ¬∞C), and late crushed in a grape press. The sugars in the grapes do not freeze, thus creating wine with higher sugar concentrations. Ice wine production is risky because many grapes do not survive the cold temperatures‚Äîresulting in ice wines being generally expensive. * Orange wine - Amber wine gets its name from its deep orange color. This wine is made by leaving white wine grapes in contact with the skins, stems, and seeds during fermentation. * Red wine - A still wine with red to purple hues created by grape skin pigments, made from dark-colored grapes * Ros√© - Ros√© is a style of wine that is made by juicing red grapes and allowing them to macerate for a short period to give the juice a pinkish hue. The maceration step only lasts two to three days and after that, the skins are removed, and the juice is allowed to ferment. Provence, France is the region that is most famous for the best ros√©s in the world. * Sparkling wine - Sparkling wine is made by fermenting wine twice. During the second fermentation, the wine is aged with lees at the bottom of the wine barrel. While the wine is being aged, the autolysis of yeast occurs which gives the wine the sparkling component. * Straw wine - Straw wines are made from a centuries-old method of laying grapes out on straw mats for long periods to be dehydrated by the sun. The dehydration results in more concentrated flavors and sugars in the grapes, leading to typically sweeter wines. They are often paired with desserts, fruit, and charcuterie, or served as an aperitif. * Table wine * White wine - A clear to yellow wine made from white grapes or dark-colored grapes  Grape varieties  Grape varieties - below are some examples of grape varieties from which wine is made: (This list does not render on mobile; try the Desktop view link at the bottom of the page)  Wine by country and region  * Argentina **Mendoza - Prominent for Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Tempranillo **San Juan - Argentina's second largest wine producer, with Syrah, Bonardo, sherry-style wines, brandies, and vermouth. **La Rioja - The small region produces Moscatel de Alexandrias and Torront√©s made from a local sub-variety known as Torront√©s Riojano. **Northwestern regions - **Patagonia - The source for much of Argentina's sparkling wine * Australia ** New South Wales - ** South Australia - ** Tasmania - ** Victoria - ** Western Australia - ** Queensland - * Chile ** Central Valley - * France ** Alsace - ** Bordeaux - ** Burgundy - ** Champagne - ** Corsica - ** Jura - ** Languedoc-Roussillon - ** Loire - ** Provence - ** Rh√¥ne - ** Savoy - ** South West - Classification systems * European Union: Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) ** Austria: Districtus Austriae Controllatus (DAC) ** Cyprus: ŒïŒªŒµŒ≥œáœåŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑ ŒüŒΩŒøŒºŒ±œÉŒØŒ± Œ†œÅŒøŒ≠ŒªŒµœÖœÉŒ∑œÇ ** France: Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) ** Germany: German wine classification ** Greece: ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒ±œÉŒØŒ± œÄœÅŒøŒµŒªŒµœçœÉŒµœâœÇ ŒµŒªŒµŒ≥œáŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑ ** Italy: Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) ** Luxembourg: Appellation contr√¥l√©e ** Portugal: Denomina√ß√£o de Origem Controlada (DOC) ** Romania: Denumire de Origine ControlatƒÉ (DOC) ** Spain: Denominaci√≥n de origen protegida (DOP) * Switzerland: Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) * Australia: Geographical Indications (GI) * Argentina: Denominaci√≥n de origen - see also Argentine wine * Canada: Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) * Brazil: Denomina√ß√£o de Origem (DO) * Chile: see Chilean wine * South Africa: Wine of Origin (WO) * United Kingdom: Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) * United States: American Viticultural Area (AVA)  Wine industry = Wine packaging  * Wine label - ;Types of wine packages * Bottle - * Box and bag - * Jug - ;Seals * Wine cork * Alternative wine closure * Screw cap Accessories * Wine glass * Corkscrew * Decanter  Wine professions and qualifications  * Vintner - * Master of Wine - * Winemaker - * Court of Master Sommeliers * Wine & Spirit Education Trust  Trends and impacts  * Wine club - * Globalization of wine - * Global warming and wine -  Wine production  * Winery - * Vineyard - * Viticulture - ** Annual growth cycle of grapevines - ** Ripeness in viticulture - * Winemaking - ** Harvest - *** Mechanical harvesting - ** Pressing (wine) ***Wine press - device used to extract juice from crushed grapes during wine making. *** History of the wine press ** Must - freshly pressed fruit juice (usually grape juice) that contains the skins, seeds, and stems of the fruit. *** Pomace - solid remains of grapes, olives, or other fruit after pressing for juice or oil.

Holles became an author often writing on military life but not limited to this alone. Holles was prolific in the 1960s and '70s, he wrote with wry humour in such works as Religion and Davey Peach, and experimented with the horror genre in Spawn amongst his non-fiction books he wrote on his experiences with Soldiering (The Guide to Real Subversive Soldiering). Holles lived for many years in the Essex village of Stebbing and was a keen village cricketer there which was reflected in his book The Guide to Real Village Cricket. As well as published works he was a successful TV writer with credits for Coronation Street and Hine, as well as one-offs for the prestigious Play for Today slot on the BBC's main TV channel (Michael Regan and The Vanishing Army), two episodes for The Man Outside (Drama series, BBC 1972) and several plays in Thames TV's Armchair Theatre series.

This pencil is usually made from non-toxic opaque wax (such as paraffin, beeswax, ceresin, carnauba or spermaceti wax) that is similar to a crayon but stronger. Marks made by grease pencils are resistant to moisture and cannot usually be removed by rubbing the marked surface with a paper towel. Grease pencils are available in several forms. The outer casing may be made of wood (like an ordinary pencil) and sharpened with a knife or pencil sharpener. Other types are covered in paper and sharpened by pulling a string to peel off the paper, needing no additional tools to remain functional. More recently, it has been produced in propelling form, essentially similar to a clutch pencil, this type in particular being associated with knee boards employed by NATO aircrew. Surfaces used with grease pencils include porcelain, glass, rock, polished stone, plastic, ceramics and other glazed, lacquered or polished surfaces, and metal, as well as the glossy paper that is used for photographic printing (particularly for contact sheets), x-rays, maps, and for marking edits on analog audio tape and film. It is also used to label theatrical lighting gels. It is often used as a construction or handyman's marking tool as it rarely scratches the surface it is used on. It may be used to mark a wet surface. They are also favored among some traditional artists. They were also used to mark glassware, during production (the original Chinagraph is so-named for marking porcelain during manufacture) and in medical or scientific applications. Grease pencils were also widely used during the mid-20th century in aircraft control centers, military radar defense system stations on land and in aircraft carriers in particular. As information came in from radar and radio operators, technicians would take details of aircraft locations, vectors, weapons and fuel status and other information and write it in reverse on a large, clear panel of glass, which was readable to the officers on the other side of the panel. The information would be continuously updated as the situation changed. They have largely been replaced by digital displays in the modern era. In the days when broadcast studios had a library of LP records, a track which was prohibited from public performance could be defaced by a wavy white or yellow chinagraph line, giving a visible warning to the presenter as well as making that track unusable.

He is the founder and former CEO of the US-based consumer brand, The Sharper Image. He established The Sharper Image in 1977, after taking an interest in watches. The early watch designs were inspired by a $69 watch that he owned and advertised his watch range in Runner's World magazine. The success of the watch advertisement led to the inaugural distribution of The Sharper Image catalog in 1979. Thalheimer took his company public in 1987 on the Nasdaq exchange. The San Francisco-based company grew from three employees in the late 1970s, to 195 stores, a staff of 4,000 and revenues of $750 million. Thalheimer left the company in 2006. After leaving his role at The Sharper Image, Thalheimer started his own online retail business in 2007, RichardSolo. Early life Thalheimer's family-owned The Blass Department Store, which for many years was Arkansas' largest department store. He was born and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas. After graduating from Hall High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, he left for New Haven and graduated from Yale University in 1970. He entered San Francisco's University of California, Hastings College of the Law the following year, graduated with a J.D. degree, and was admitted to the California Bar in July 1974. After graduating from law school in 1974, he practiced law in San Francisco for a year. Career=The Sharper Image After graduating from law school in 1974, Thalheimer passed the California bar exam and practiced law in San Francisco for a year. While still studying law, Thalheimer at the age of 24 started a part-time office supply business, named Thalheimer Business Systems. Based in San Francisco he started the supply business with $500 worth of copier paper. He later renamed his venture The Sharper Image. The rebrand was to help promote the quality of the copier paper and toner sold by his business. After rebranding to The Sharper Image, Thalheimer stated in interviews that he had a desire to transform the business into a mail-order retail empire. He then began to study tech products that could be supplied by the business. His first idea was digital watches, after seeing a $300 Seiko watch. He spotted that some wealthy runners were using the Seiko, but many everyday runners would never have been able to afford the price tag. He took a flight to Las Vegas to visit a trade show, where he came across his first product, a wholesale digital watch. The watch manufacturer was based in Taiwan and was looking to distribute their product in the United States. Thalheimer purchased a watch and gave it to the head of his run club. He tested it running, cycling and swimming. The watch held up to the challenge and Thalheimer decided to start distributing the watch. He believed it could be marketed as a similar product to the more expensive Seiko. The product was marketed directly to runners in Runner's World, with a full-page ad offering the watch at $69. The ad contained a large photo of the famous San Francisco runner Walt Stack. He generated $5k in profits from the watch and marketing campaign and began to repeat the process with other products and became a millionaire aged 27. The process became successful enough for Thalheimer to decide to launch his own catalog in 1979. He stated to The Hustle magazine, it was a high tech catalog of devices no one knew they needed. Over the coming years, Thalheimer promoted products through magazine ads and catalog mailings. The Sharper Image regularly introduced new products to its line, and they were often seen as innovative. In the 1980s, Thalheimer introduced many products to the mass market, including the first cordless telephone. Other products included the first telephone answering machine, the first hand-held microcomputer, the first children's two-wheel Razor Scooter, and the Ionic Breeze Air Purifier. By the mid-1990s, the company became known for selling \\"quirky gadgets\\" and with the rise in electronic devices in homes, the company grew exponentially. During the opening of a Sharper Image store on Sutter Street in San Francisco in 1996, Thalheimer gave a presentation with NeXT Computer founder, Steve Jobs. Thalheimer spoke about how he witnessed Jobs' presentation earlier that year at WebMania, where he presented NeXt's dynamic web page builder. Thalheimer during his speech stated that at the time he thought \\"I gotta have this.\\" Two months later, The Sharper Image launched its online catalog, which was built in partnership with NeXT Computers. Jobs presented The Sharper Image website to a select group of people in the store, explaining that thousands of webpages could be built depending on information about that user stored in a database. While NeXT Computer was using dynamic webpages with other clients, it is believed this is the first time it was used on this scale within retail. Job explained during the presentation that he and Thalheimer would \\"continue to enhance it, but it's already way ahead of anything else that is out there.\\" Later, Jobs presented the software at a number of expos, using The Sharper Image's website as an example. In some cases, Thalheimer also presented a short segment on how the website had allowed the company to transition from a traditional catalog model to online. At Internet World expo in 1996, Thalheimer presented a segment during Steve Jobs' speech about dynamic web pages. Thalheimer stated that The Sharper Image spent $35 million in 1995 in order to distribute 2 million catalogs each month to its clients. He explained that the web catalog would completely transform how they did business. The partnership established between Thalheimer and Jobs went onto become what today is seen as modern-day eCommerce. At the time, some magazines such as Wired spoke about the technology used by The Sharper Image and how Jobs' innovations were likely to change the retail sector forever. In the coming years, the model worked on with Thalheimer was offered and reproduced at other large retailers across the United States. Thalheimer announced that The Sharper Image was introducing a device called the Ionic Breeze in 1998. The device was an air purifier which made numerous innovations in the market. At the time, while air purifiers were available on the retail market, it was the first time After the 3.0 version was released in 2003, The Times newspaper reported \\"unlike most air purifiers it is silent,\\" which was seen as a revolutionary step in the market at the time. In 1999, Thalheimer's vision for eCommerce saw The Sharper Image increase its online revenues 243% in a single year. The strong online performance allowed the business to continue expanding and launch new innovative products. Thalheimer moved from managing the day-to-day operations that year to spending 4 days a week with the design-time coming up with new concepts and products. The company also focused on their store offerings during this period, and were one of the first United States retailers to offer the Razor scooter. According to an interview in CNN, Thalheimer first saw the scooter at a Hong Kong trade show and signed a distribution deal 7 months before any other retailers in the United States stocked the scooter. In 2006, Thalheimer left the business after 29 years at the helm. Thalheimer remained on the board until 2007 when he sold his remaining shares in the business. Thalheimer appeared on numerous prime time television shows including Late Night with David Letterman and The Joan Rivers Show. He was featured in the Citibank Diner's Club network commercial. RichardSolo After leaving The Sharper Image, Thalheimer founded RichardSolo in 2007. As soon as he founded the business, he continued where he left off with Sharper Image and began to invent and distribute useful gadgets. It began in 2007 when he signed an exclusivity agreement to distribute a backup battery pack for smart devices, such as iPhones. By 2008, the company had grown to a turnover of $4 million, simply by offering a single product. Thalheimer recognized that the success wasn't only the charging of a phone on the go, but also the notoriously poor battery life of the iPhone. RichardSolo also launched other products, such as the Back-Up, which was a back support. The Sharper Fund In 2010, Thalheimer devoted his full-time energies to managing his stock portfolio and began to study with the Najarian Brothers. In 2015, Thalheimer launched his family office fund, which is known today as The Sharper Fund. The Sharper Fund recorded gains of 96% during 2019. Through the first half of 2020, recorded gains of 73%. During a podcast interview, Thalheimer spoke about his simple, yet effective option trading strategies and public stock predictions. He compared his investing strategy to how he created and marketed Sharper Image products; looking at long term benefits and market factors at the time of investment. Then, he gave an example of his investment in Chipotle. The company suffered a sharp fall in share price after numerous food poisoning issues. Thalheimer stated that after the fall in share price, Chipotle hired the ex-Taco Bell CEO, Brian Niccol. He believed that Niccol's expertise would change the culture at Chipotle and subsequently they would see the share price return to its highs of $750 a share. At the time of the podcast interview, Thalheimer stated he had made large returns due to the increase he had seen in the restaurant chain's share price. In December 2018, Thalheimer was interviewed on a couple of occasions about his position on Tesla's stock price. Thalheimer stated in the interview he had always held a bullish view on the stock after owning four Teslas since 2010. He stated that many of the critical views by both analysts and industry experts, such as Bob Lutz, were looking at market conditions incorrectly. He believed that many were overlooking the technology in Teslas in the same way analysts and experts ignored how revolutionary the iPod would become. He also stated that his belief that Tesla was in a stronger position than Ford and other traditional motor manufacturers. Thalheimer announced in early 2020 that Tesla stock was up almost 200% since he made the call in late 2018. The Sharper Fund also recorded a 93% gain during 2019. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Thalheimer announced that he was long on Restoration Hardware. Towards summer 2020, it was announced that the stock was up 47%. Design The Sharper Image based an \\"invention lab\\" in Novato, California that had the sole purpose of designing and developing new products. It was Thalheimer's vision to design products and during the last decade at The Sharper Image, he spent a lot of time at the Novato facility. At its peak, the facility employed 15 people and was granted 300 patents. Author Creating Your Own Sharper Image is a business book written by Thalheimer. In this book he shares his techniques for building a successful business.

Clove oil is commonly used in aromatherapy and for flavoring food and some medicines. Madagascar and Indonesia are the main producers of clove oil. Although it may be promoted as having analgesic properties, there is insufficient medical evidence to support such uses. Types and phytochemicals There are three types of clove oil: * Bud oil is derived from the flower-buds of S. aromaticum. It consists of 60‚Äì90% eugenol, acetyl eugenol, caryophyllene and other minor constituents. * Leaf oil is derived from the leaves of S. aromaticum. It consists of 82‚Äì88% eugenol with little or no eugenyl acetate, and minor constituents. * Stem oil is derived from the twigs of S. aromaticum. It consists of 90‚Äì95% eugenol, with other minor constituents. Distilled clove oil from buds contains mixed phytochemicals, including as main constituents phenylpropanoids (primarily eugenol), carvacrol, thymol, and cinnamaldehyde, with smaller quantities of polyphenols, carbohydrates, lipids, oleanolic acid, and rhamnetin.  Uses = Toothache  Particularly in South Korea and India, eugenol, a phytochemical extracted from clove oil, is used to relieve toothache. Applied to a cavity in a decayed tooth or tooth socket remaining after extraction, eugenol or clove oil may relieve toothache temporarily. In the United States, the FDA considers eugenol ineffective for treating dental pain, and has downgraded clove oil as an analgesic due to insufficient evidence to rate its effectiveness. Fish Clove oil is commonly used to anesthetize or euthanize laboratory or pet fish. Toxicity In Australia, clove oil is one of several essential oils implicated with poisoning, mostly of children. In the period 2014-2018, there were 179 cases in New South Wales, accounting for 4% of essential oil poisoning incidents.

Louis Davis was born on 28 May 1860 and raised in Abingdon, Oxfordshire on East St Helen Street. He was the son of Marianne and Gabriel Davis. His mother, also known as Mary Ann, was from Ewelme, Oxfordshire. His father was a manufacturer, with an interest in the Davis Engineering and Launch Building Company, which built and refurbished boats, barges and canals. Gabriel Davis was also a grain, alcohol and coal merchant. Louis Davis had two older brothers, Arthur and David, and a younger brother named Oliver.Louis Davis. Abingdon School. Retrieved 1 October 2012. Davis married the much younger Edith Jane Webster in 1901 in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. Due to the similarity between the faces of women in his works and that of a picture of Edith, it is probable that she was his model for much of his glass work. The couple never had children, but Edith's sister, Ethel, lived with the couple and was a companion and housekeeper for a period of time. Edith and Louis were both injured due to an accidental gas fire and the resulting fumes in 1915. Davis seemed to have suffered a stroke, lost his ability to speak, and occasionally required a wheelchair for mobility. Edith fully recovered from the incident. Davis died in 1941 after which Edith sold their home and studio and returned to East Anglia where she was raised. She died in the late 1970s. Education 1871 Abingdon School day boys, Davis sitting front row, second left. Davis was educated at Abingdon School from 1870-1875. Recognised as talented, he was awarded a foundation scholarship based upon his artistic skill in 1871. In 1891 he became a student of the glass artist, Christopher Whall, at his combined home and studio in Dorking. One of Whall's first students, Davis lived with his mentor's family for a time. Davis assisted Whall on one of the windows commissioned by the St Mary's Church in Stamford, Lincolnshire.

His work was exhibited often, but he had an increasing interest in stained-glass work and by 1911 worked exclusively with glass. Stained glass Louis Davis, Window at Dunblane Cathedral A few years after having worked with Christopher Wall, Davis worked with Mary Lowndes and Alfred J. Drury at Lowndes and Drury. He worked first in their location in Chelsea and then at their Glass House studio in Fulham, London from 1906 on. When the volume of work that Davis commissioned exceeded his ability to have the works made, he contracted with the London-based James Powell & Sons to make the works, particularly relying on principal glass-painter Thomas Cowell to interpret and execute the designs.

Texas Biomed is funded by government and corporate grants and contracts, and donations from the public.  History  Texas Biomed was founded in 1941 by Tom Slick as the Foundation of Applied Research. Its initial mission was to provide research and advanced education in agriculture, natural sciences and medicine. It became the Southwest Foundation for Research and Education in 1952. In the late 1950s, the Institute moved to its current location on Military Drive. In 1982, The Foundation was renamed Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research (SFBR) and Texas Biomedical Research Institute on February 1, 2011. Tom Slick‚Äôs sister, Betty Moorman, helped establish a club whose members could make an annual contribution to support the Foundation‚Äôs research. In the 1950s, the Foundation purchased an historic 1854 mansion in San Antonio called The Argyle to serve as the headquarters. Members of the club continue to meet and support scientific research at Texas Biomed today with their time and resources. A group of women called the Texas Biomedical Forum raises money to support pilot grants for Texas Biomed scientists, science awards for outstanding teachers, and tours of the Institute for high school students. In 1988, the Founders Council formed. It includes supporters ages 25 to 46 who support the Institute are community advocates and financial supporters. The Founders Council also provides grants for equipment to Texas Biomed scientists.  Structure  Located on a campus on the northwest side of San Antonio, Texas Biomed employs over 60 doctoral level biomedical scientists, including 18 principal investigators and 360+ staff members. Focused on basic biomedical research, the Institute is divided into the Department of Genetics and the Department of Virology & Immunology. The Southwest National Primate Research Center, a part of Texas Biomed, is an international resource that provides specialized facilities and expertise in research with nonhuman primates to investigators from around the US and other countries. It maintains 2,500 nonhuman primates.

Controversy On April 14, 2018, four baboons escaped from the facility. They were contained within the same day. In 2015, it was announced that the institute is under a federal investigation after the death of at least five primates over a five-year period. According to news reports, one monkey was crushed to death by a cage door, another died from strangulation, and another from blood poisoning following a traumatic injury. In 2014, the Humane Society of the United States released undercover footage from inside the institute which, according to the animal welfare group, ‚Äúfound a pattern of animal mistreatment, including overcrowding and lack of veterinary care‚Äù. The group said their investigation found animals suffering from severe stress and improper treatment after injuries. In response, the institute argued they have ‚Äúa long-standing commitment to treating animals humanely and with the highest regard for their well-being, and [‚Ä¶] continuously seek to enhance the care provided to‚Äù the animals in their facility. Between 2012 and 2015, the institute was cited by federal inspectors for at least 16 alleged violations of the Animal Welfare Act. In 2012, the institute was fined $25,714 for alleged violations and two years prior it paid a $6,094 settlement to the government for additional alleged violations. The institute says the alleged violations are a result of isolated incidents and are not reflective of their treatment of the monkeys in their laboratories.

It is built on three biblical presumptions: the sinfulness of humanity, the freedom of humanity, and the validity and seriousness of the Great Commandment. The key political concepts of Christian realism are balance of power and political responsibility. This political-theological perspective is most closely associated with the work of the 20th-century American theologian and public intellectual Reinhold Niebuhr. Niebuhr argued that the Kingdom of God cannot be realized on earth because of the innately corrupt tendencies of society. Due to the injustices that arise among people, we must be willing to compromise the ideal of Kingdom of Heaven on earth. Niebuhr argued that human perfectibility was an illusion, highlighting the sinfulness of humanity at a time when the world was confronted by labor disputes and race riots in industrial hubs like Detroit, Michigan where he pastored, the horrors of the Second World War, the Communist and Fascist totalitarian regimes, and the Holocaust. Christian realism was in part a reaction to the 20th-century Social Gospel movement. Numerous American political figures have been influenced by Christian realism, among them Barack Obama, Martin Luther King Jr., and Jimmy Carter. Political influence Christian realism exerted a strong influence on American foreign and domestic policy in the Cold War era. Many members of the neoconservative movement have claimed allegiance to Niebuhr's philosophy, however, some critics argued that neoconservatism neglected Niebuhr's strong commitment to social justice. Perspectives on Christian realism Gary Dorrien wrote: The New York Times obituary for Niebuhr, written by Arthur Schlesinger Jr., read, Christian realism in the 21st century In the post-9/11 era, a number of scholars have been questioning the overly secular character of political realism, especially in the light of postmodern critique. Charles Jones of the University of Cambridge has suggested that international law and normative theory presuppose Christian ethics in the international relations theory. Despite the Christian realist underpinnings of scholars, originally associated with the English school, the revival of the interest towards religion in International Relations is a relatively recent phenomenon.

Biography  K√°lalov√° was born in Bernartice. Her father Jan K√°lal was a teacher and zealous breeder of rabbits. He was very supportive of her education. Simultaneously, she studied medicine (she specialized in surgery), Arabic and Persian at Charles University in Prague. She graduated with honours in 1922. Female surgeons were quite extraordinary in Czechoslovakia in the early 1920s. After attending a lecture on exotic parasitology given by professor Jaroslav Hlava, she became interested in tropical diseases and their treatment. Later she focused on examining the so-called ‚ÄúBaghdad boils‚Äù. She established the Czechoslovak Surgical Institute in Baghdad, where she worked both as a director and surgeon between 1925 and 1932. She was soon nicknamed ‚ÄúAlbert Schweitzer in a skirt‚Äù. She was so respected that she even treated some members of the Iraqi Royal Family. In Iraq she started collecting various kinds of local insects which she preserved and sent to the Czech National Museum. During the years spent in Baghdad, she enriched the museum with 500,000 specimens; some of them had not been explored before and were named after her. She married Italian Giorgio Di Lotti and they had two children ‚Äì Radbor and Drahomila Lydie. However, she was still obsessed with work; she did not go on maternity leave and continued to work in the hospital. Later she became ill with feared dengue fever which confined her to bed for a few months. In 1932, she came back to Czechoslovakia where she recovered. Her entire family was wiped out by accidental shooting from German troops on 8 May 1945, at the very moment when the Czechs were being finally liberated. She barely survived the accident herself with two bullets shot at her. Many reports show that the \\"shooting\\" was not accidental at all, rather it was an execution style by the Nazi. She herself survived only because the killers believed she was dead among all those that they killed. Additional reports show that her husband and children were killed by the Nazi first in front of her eyes as a form of punishment. In 1947, she attended an international women's conference in United States, held by Eleanor Roosevelt. Here she befriended the Norwegian author Ingeborg Refling Hagen among others. Under the Communist regime, K√°lalov√° strongly protested against the death sentence for Milada Hor√°kov√° who was executed on charges of conspiracy and treason in 1950. Apart from her medical skills, K√°lalov√° had a gift for languages. She was fluent in fourteen foreign languages: in English, French, German, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, Arabic, Persian, Norwegian, Icelandic, modern Greek, Tajik and Georgian. She also worked as a translator. She died in P√≠sek.

It was released for the Dreamcast in Japan in 2001. A version of this game was developed and released in 2018 for the Nintendo Switch, by Zerodiv. This version was given the title \\"Zero Gunner 2-\\" as Zerodiv had to rebuild the game almost from scratch, due to the original data being missing, and out of respect for both the original version of the game and purists.\\"A Quick Look At Zero Gunner 2 - Dreamcast & Switch Comparison\\", The Dreamcast Junkyard, January 26, 2018. Story In the near future, an Asian conglomerate known as Igem develops a unique energy source capable of developing a number of innovative machines. Their over-abundant research with the energy leads to the construction of a weather control machine called ONI, developed entirely for the purpose of taking over the world. Once ONI is activated, the countries of the world suffer and Igem's secret militia move in to destroy any opposition. It is here that the Zero Gunner squadron is called into action to stop Igem and to destroy ONI. Gameplay One or two players can take their pick of three helicopters, each with their own firing pattern and battle oncoming waves of enemies through 7 different stages, each with a boss at the end. Each boss has a different form at the beginning, such as a train, boat, airplane, or submarine, but after the players have inflicted enough damage, it turns into a giant robot. After the players destroy the robot, the stage ends and they progress on to the new stage. There are 9 modes of difficulty, ranging from \\"Child\\", where enemies fire little to none when fired upon to \\"Very Hard\\", where enemies fire at almost any given moment. The game is particularly innovative by including a way to rotate the helicopter in 360 degrees, allowing the player to fire in any direction. Most of the time this is required to survive, as enemies not only come from the top of the screen, but the left, right, and bottom as well. Like other scrolling shooters, the game makes use of power-ups to improve a helicopter's firepower. Each player also has a \\"Special\\" Bar, which slowly rises whenever players collect the little \\"E\\" icons from destroyed enemies. Every time the bar fills, the player has an opportunity to unleash their helicopter's special attack which often is capable of destroying every enemy on the screen. The first 4 stages, either Alpine Armored Train, Submergence City, Sea of Cloud, or Marine Base, are chosen in random order. The last 3 stages, Asian Slum, Orbital Elevator, and Aerial Capital, are in a set order. Helicopters are: ‚Ä¢ the Comanche, which is blue and has lasers as its main weapon. ‚Ä¢ the Apache, which is dark green and has blue bullets and straight- firing missiles as its weaponry. ‚Ä¢ the Hokum, which is yellow and is the best helicopter, considering it has guided missiles, bullets that deal high damage, and a Special Attack that is 99 rounds and includes small planes that fire at the enemy and follow you around. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Zero Gunner 2 on their July 15, 2001 issue as being the eighth most-successful arcade game of the year.

Big Bad Beetleborgs Here is a list of monsters brought out of the comics by the Magnavores. The monsters here are adapted from Juukou B-Fighter: Amphibious Monster * First Appearance: \\"Beetle Rock, Part 1\\" (9/7/96) * Voice Actor: Lex Lang An armored amphibious monster shown in Drew's Beetleborgs comic and day-dream. This monster later appeared again when Vexor released numerous monster from the comics during the \\"Curse of the Shadow Borg\\" saga, yet was not seen again after being summoned. Drew names this creature \\"Hairball\\", though it may have just been an insult. Terror Bear * First Appearance: \\"The Ghost is Toast\\" (9/10/96) * Voice Actor: Mike Reynolds A people-eating black bear monster....or at least he was supposed to be in the comics. Terror Bear had a huge sweet tooth and preferred junk food over human flesh. He was the first monster to be pulled out of the comics. Terror Bear was black and stood on two legs. He had iron mace balls shackled to each wrist and a third eye on his chest. In battle, he launched spikes that protruded from his body like explosive missiles. He was defeated and sent back to the comics by the Beetleborgs and their Sonic Laser Sabers. Mean Green Cannon Machine * First Appearance: \\"The Treasure of Hillhurst Mansion\\" (9/11/96) * Voice Actor: Tom Wyner (1st time), Ezra Weisz (2nd time) A green android monster that had cannons in his fists and shoulder-mounted missile launchers. The Magnavores were seeking Hillhurst's treasure. To aid them, they summoned the Mean Green Cannon Machine to obstruct the Beetleborgs. The Beetleborgs did him in with their weapons. This monster was re-released by Vexor during the \\"Curse of the Shadow Borg\\" saga, where he was one of the first victims of Drew's Thunder Stinger (before upgrading to Mega-Blue). Sword Warrior * First Appearance: \\"Say the Magic Word\\" (9/13/96) * Voice Actor: Peter Greenwood A samurai monster summoned by the Magnavores. He was first released when Jo was invisible and later defeated by a restored Jo and her Striker Blaster. He was then released during the comic book convention alongside Cataclazmic, Wingar and Goldex, and was also released during the \\"Curse of the Shadow Borg\\" saga. He was one of the first victims of Drew's Thunder Stinger (before upgrading to Mega-Blue). Galaclops * Mentioned in Episode:\\"Lights, Camera, Too Much Action\\" (9/14/96) Unseen monster from the comics suggested by Typhus as the monster to send to the Hollywood filmmakers set. Graxxis * First Appearance: \\"Lights, Camera, Too Much Action\\" (9/14/96) * Voice Actor: Tom Wyner A mantis-like monster. In battle, Graxxis could release green lasers (when angry) and launch a sharp stinger-tipped rope from its mouth. While Hollywood filmmakers were making a horror flick in Charterville, Vexor ordered Jara, Noxic, and Typhus to summon a monster to cause havoc on their behalf. Graxxis was summoned at the suggestion of Noxic. Graxxis was mistaken for the leading monster of the horror flick. After he grew tired of the director's abuse, he went out to cause real trouble in the city. His rampage was ultimately stopped by Drew's Stinger Drill. He was released again during the \\"Curse of the Shadow Borg\\" saga by Vexor where he was one of the first victims of Drew's Thunder Stinger (before upgrading to Mega-Blue). He was released again by Nukus during the finale of Season 1. LottaMuggs * First Appearance: \\"Nano in the House\\" (9/16/96) * Voice Actor: Ezra Weisz A multi-faced amoeba-like monster. The Magnavores stole the Amulet of Subjugation, which hypnotizes people into becoming the wearer's servants. LottaMuggs was determined to get his amulet back at any cost. LottaMuggs could summon blasts from his hands as well as turn into flying worm-like energy projectiles. He was eventually defeated by the Sonic Lasers. He was released from the comics again by Vexor in the \\"Curse of the Shadow Borg\\" saga where he was one of the victims of Drew's Thunder Stinger (before upgrading to Mega-Blue). He was released again by Nukus during the finale of season 1. Garganturat * First Appearance: \\"Locomotion Commotion\\" (9/17/96) * Voice Actors: Will Long A hunchbacked rat monster. The Magnavores wanted to steal a train, but needed a diversion. They summoned Garganturat to be the diversion. Garganturat kidnapped Heather to keep the Beetleborgs busy. He then shrunk himself and hid in a mousehole dimension where he was finished off by the Beetleborgs' power weapons. He came back twice, once by Vexor's powers in the \\"Curse of the Shadow Borg.\\" saga where he was one of the victims of Drew's Thunder Stinger (before upgrading to Mega-Blue). He was released again by Nukus during the Season 1 finale. Firecat * First Appearance: \\"Cat-Tastrophy\\" (9/18/96) * Voice Actor: Tom Charles Firecat was a weak cat creature that required recharging through a special machine. When fully charged, he was stronger and had the ability to breathe fire. Noxic proudly took credit for creating Firecat, claiming he was the one who took a \\"weak and helpless pussy cat\\" and changed it into Firecat through the special machine. Typhus, seemingly based on the monster's theme, argued that the creature was from his army of monsters. He scratched Drew in battle, causing Drew to turn into a cat-like creature himself. Firecat, on the other hand, could not be controlled. Noxic and Typhus lured it with candy so they could place him back into the machine to restore him. Drew's condition worsened, and his only chance to get back to normal was by getting into the machine himself. The machine overloaded, but Drew came out in full Beetleborg form. Firecat came out too, but was angry and blackened, seemingly from being burnt to a crisp in the machine. Aside from being blackened, Firecat was still not under control and released fireballs everywhere. Firecat was defeated in the end by Drew's Stinger Drill. Queen Magna * First Appearance: \\"Drew and Flabber's Less- Than-Fabulous Adventure\\" (9/19/96) * Actor: Lisa Walsh A white and blue butterfly-themed sorceress with a hypnotic voice who wore a blue jeweled necklace. Heather's birthday had arrived and Drew wanted to give her as a present. The latest issue of Beetleborgs comics had Queen Magna on the cover and Heather was fixated by the necklace that the villainess wore around her neck. Drew decided to give Heather that necklace for her birthday, so he convinced Flabber to take them into Magna's comic book world. However, Drew's Beetleborg powers would not work inside the comic book, so he and Flabber were at a disadvantage when confronted by Magna. As Magna tried to put them under her spell with her hypnotic vocalizing, Flabber broke free, and both he and Drew escaped leaving the necklace behind. Magna, in her dimension, sat on a throne and was fawned over by various Scabs, some of which were seen fanning her off, brushing her wings, and serving her nectar to drink. The Magnavores tried to trap Drew and Flabber in the comic book/comic book's dimension while they were inside. Dominailer * Mentioned in Episode: \\"Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun\\" (9/20/96) Unseen monster from the comics mentioned by the Beetleborgs as a possible secret weapon for the Magnavores. Photominator * First Appearance: \\"The Littlest Brattleborg\\" (9/27/96) * Voice Actor: Gregg Bullock Photominator is a camera monster with deadly lenses. When Drew and Jo's cousin Oliver, dressed as the Blue Stinger Borg, came for a visit, the Magnavores mistook him for the real one. Oliver constantly took their pictures, giving Vexor inspiration to summon the Magnavore's old friend the Photominator. Photominator was easily beaten by the Beetleborgs (including the REAL Blue Stinger). He appeared again during the \\"Curse of the Shadow Borg\\" saga thanks to Vexor's magic. Mace Warrior * First Appearance: \\"Haunted Hideout\\" (9/28/96) * Voice Actor: Peter Greenwood An axe-bladed mace-wielding warrior with a cattle skull-shaped helmet and a red tunic summoned by Jara. He wielded and could toss his mace at far distances causing explosions, one of which set the nearby forest on fire. His mission was to stir-up some trouble, which he attempted to do by destroying a forest (and its wildlife) near Hillhurst. In battle, he could also blast lasers from the top of his mace. He deflected the Beetleborgs laser blasts back at them with his shield. Roland sent him back to the comics using his Hunter Claw. Amphead * First Appearance: \\"Monster Rock\\" (10/4/96) * Voice Actor: Bob Papenbrook An over- sized amplifier robot that played loud, devastating music. The Magnavores got word that a famous rock band was in town and were inspired to create music mayhem of their own. He was defeated but came back twice, once by Vexor in the \\"Curse of the Shadow Borg\\" saga and again by Nukus during the Season 1 finale. Cataclazmic * First Appearance: \\"Convention Dimension\\" (10/5/96) * Voice Actor: Damian Pappahranis Cataclazmic is a yellow caterpillar monster. He first appeared as part of the comic book army used to terrorize the comic convention. In \\"She Wolf,\\" Cataclazmic was brought back once more to help Noxic and Typhus retrieve Jara (who had been turned into a werewolf by Wolfgang). He was sent back to the comics by Drew's Stinger Drill. Wingar * First Appearance: \\"Convention Dimension\\" (10/5/96) * Voice Actor: Richard Epcar A bird-like monster pulled from a comic book at the convention. It was defeated with the aid of Karato and Silver Ray and by the combined effort of the Beetleborgs weapons. Despite being from a different comic, Wingar's face was later seen on Borgslayer. Goldex * First Appearance: \\"Convention Dimension\\" (10/5/96) Karato's arch enemy. He was designed like Karato only with a red and gold armor plate. It was defeated with the combined power of the Beetleborgs weapons. Despite being from a different comic, Goldex's face was later seen on Borgslayer. Venus Claptrap * First Appearance: \\"Root of All Evil\\" (10/11/96) * Voice Actor: Bob Johnson A large man-eating plant monster that could fire burning pollen. In the comics, Vexor was once surrounded by his kind. He was brought from the comics to steal Drew's unusual plant. During battle, Claptrap swallowed Roland and Jo inside and they clung onto his inner roots to avoid falling into his stomach acid. He ended up defeated in the end, when Drew used the power of Gargantus. Venus Claptrap was later brought out of the comics again by Vexor during the \\"Shadow Borg\\" saga. Cyber-Serpent * First Appearance: \\"The Doctor Is In\\" (10/18/96) * Voice Actor: Ezra Weisz A very powerful snake monster that came from a two-part comic. He has no head and has a snake where his head and arms should be. When Cyber-Serpent was first released from the comics, it was said that he was immune to the Beetleborgs weapons. This trait was never mentioned again after he was brought back a second and third time. Because his issue had not reached the stores yet, the kids had no idea on how to defeat Cyber-Serpent. With the help of Dr. Baron von Frankenbeans, the Beetleborgs came up with a strategy to trick the monster and send it back into the comic book....and it worked as they blasted him with their Sonic Lasers when he was unsuspectingly standing right above a copy of the comic book he came from and was promptly sent back. He reappeared in the \\"Curse of the Shadow Borg\\" saga, and was summoned by Nukus at the end of Season 1. Dicehead * First Appearance: \\"The Brain in the Attic\\" (10/25/96) * Voice Actor: Steve Jones Watson A monster whose brain was stolen by Typhus and placed into Hillhurst mansion. Whoever held the brain, their worst fears were brought to life (with Jo facing her Aunt May and her \\"slobbery kisses,\\"Wolfgang facing giant fleas, Nano facing a trio of ninjas, Count Fangula facing his \\"nightmare\\" of an ex-wife, Drew facing giant broccoli, and Mums facing a giant pair of scissors). When Dicehead came to life, he was clueless and idiotic (and speaking in surfer slang). Once reunited with his brain, Dicehead's intelligence was restored, making him extremely dangerous (and his real voice was deep and fiercer). To defeat him, the Beetleborgs had to confuse him, causing his brain to shatter, his intelligence to dissipate, and his defeat to come quick. He later reappeared in the \\"Curse of the Shadow Borg\\" saga and was later released by Nukus amongst the other monsters. Both of those times he was wiped out by Drew's Thunder Stinger (the latter in Mega- Blue mode). Grenade Guy * First Appearance: \\"Bye, Bye Frankie\\" (10/31/96) * Voice Actor: Michael Sorich A humanoid grenade monster that was assigned to kidnap Frankenbeans so the Magnavores could ransom him for the Beetle Bonders. At the Halloween party held at Zoom Comics, Frankenbeans (who had left Hillhurst) tried to blend into the costumed crowd, and soon, Grenade Guy was there to kidnap him while the Beetleborgs were distracted. In the ensuing battle, Grenade Guy overpowered Roland, but then the Beetleborgs decided to try a new maneuver with their AVs. Jo equipped her AV with the Blue AV's magnet attachment to capture Grenade Guy, who was being held still by Roland's Hunter Claw. She then dropped him onto the other two AVs, which were waiting to finish him off. He reappeared during the \\"Curse of the Shadow Borg\\" saga. Porkasaurus * First Appearance: \\"Fangs Over Charterville\\" (11/2/96) * Voice Actor: Bob Johnson Porkasaurus is a pig monster. Like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers monster Pudgy Pig, Porkasaurus was brought out to consume all the food in Charterville during a blood drive. He was taken down and condemned back to the comics by Drew's Stinger Blade. He reappeared during the \\"Curse of the Shadow Borg\\" saga and was later released from the comics by Nukus amongst the other monsters in the Season Finale. Detestro * First Appearance: \\"Raiders of the Tomb\\" (11/15/96) * Voice Actor: Rick Tane A demonic humanoid white-haired warrior attired in a brown robe and armed with a spear. Drew and Josh broke into the cemetery to steal the Energy Axis from Vexor when he was powering up Shadowborg. Vexor then summoned Detestro the Cave Warrior to hunt the boys down and retrieve the device. When Drew used the Energy Axis to become his Mega-Blue form for the first time, Detestro was eventually swept back to the comic books by the Thunder Stinger. Cataclaws * First Appearance: \\"Yo Ho Borgs\\" (11/25/96) * Voice Actor: Alex Borstein A sloth monster who impersonated Blackbeard the Pirate. Cataclaws was large with orange and white fur and green eyes. She was sent back to the comics by the Beetleborgs' weapons. Mucant * First Appearance: \\"Pet Problems\\" (3/21/97) * Voice Actor: Steve Kramer An orange muscular bird-faced monster with dragon-like wings, bird-like feet, built-in shoulder cannons (one-shaped like a dragon head and the other shaped like a lobster claw), and a scorpion-like tail. It was summoned by the Magnavores to kidnap people's pets and ransom them. Mucant met his match when he tried to capture Wolfgang's strange pet, a feisty purple furred animal with a large mouth. Roland and Jo fired their weapons at Mucant to send him back to the comic books. He reappeared in the Season Finale when he was released by Nukus amongst other monsters. Furocious * First Appearance: \\"Operation Frankenbeans\\" (3/28/97) * Voice Actor: Brad Orchard A blue moth-headed monster with brown fur. Furocious could breathe fire in battle. Vexor's strategy to harm the kids was to constantly disrupt their daily lives so they would fail school. To add further complications, Furocious was called upon by Vexor. Once the kids saw through Vexor's plan, he was sent back to the comics when Roland used/powered up his Green Hunter Claw. Even though the monster is called Furocious, he is never referred to by name and is named in the credits. Skullhead * First Appearance: \\"The Curse of Mums' Tomb\\" (4/3/97) * Voice Actor: David Walsh A skull-headed monster. In battle, Skullhead could blast lasers from his eyes, teleport, and move/attack at great speeds (albeit upside down mostly). The kids confronted the Magnavores to retrieve Mums' lost, cursed, and magical scarab necklace. To deal with the Beetleborgs, Skullhead was called from the comics and he pulled the heroes into another dimension. Skullhead was referred to (by Jara) as her bodyguard He was quickly defeated in this new dimension, with the combined efforts of the Beetleborgs' weapons and the power of Mega Blue Beetleborg and his Thunder Stinger. When he was defeated, the Magnavores retreated and left behind the scarab necklace. Malavex * First Appearance: \\"This Old Ghost\\" (4/4/97) * Voice Actor: Brian Tahash A green monster with a bird-like face and a voice like Scatman Crothers. He almost resembles Mucant, minus the wings (and add in the fact that Malavex was green). Malavex's pastime was playing his trumpet, but his music was disturbing the grave of Old Man Hillhurst. For Hillhurst to rest in peace again, the Beetleborgs had to send Malavex back to the comic. Roland did just that with his Hunter Claw. Drew pointed out that Malavex was from issue #138 (and was the most vicious Magnavore ever drawn). Malavex's head later appeared on Borgslayer. Hammerhands * First Appearance: \\"Jo's Strange Change\\" (4/10/97) * Voice Actor: Bob Papenbrook A one-eyed hammer-headed robot with hammer-shaped hands. He attacked the Beetleborgs at the time when Wolfgang accidentally used a spell on Jo which made her look different. When the Beetleborgs scanned him, in battle, they discovered his one eye was his weak spot. When Drew fired his Stinger Drill at this spot, Hammerhands was sent back to the comics. Swamp Scumoid * First Appearance: \\"Something Fishy\\" (4/17/97) * Voice Actor: Dave Mallow Vexor summoned a monster named Swamp Scumoid to impersonate Charterville's urban legend called Charterville Charlie. Swamp Scumoid was a dark green Gillman-resembling monster with the most horrid odor. The Beetleborgs were at first hesitant to kill it, thinking this creature was a real scientific discovery. Vexor had released him before the comic was made available to the public though Jara, Noxic, and Typhus didn't know it. However, the monster took Trip hostage by knocking him out with his odor, holding him until he managed to escape. He later took Mums hostage in the catacombs below Hillhurst. Roland quickly discovered the latest issue of the comics and learned that this fishman was not the actual Charterville Charlie after all, but the Swamp Scumoid. After Mums was rescued, the smelly fish was zapped with the Sonic Lasers. Crimson Creep * First Appearance: \\"Bride of Frankenbeans\\" (4/18/97) * Voice Actor: Patrick Thomas A red moth monster summoned by the Magnavores to crash the wedding of Frankenbeans and Bride of Frankenbeans. He ended up getting his own party crashed into when Drew, in Mega Blue Beetleborg mode, sent him back to the comics with his trusty Thunder Stinger. He was later released from the comics by Nukus amongst other monsters in the Season Finale. Unctuous * First Appearance: \\"Fangula's Last Bite\\" (4/21/97) * Voice Actor: Jimmy Theodore A clawed red-and-orange crab/shrimp monster who was to help the Magnavores capture Fangula's boss Vlad. The plan did not work, though, as he fell victim to Roland's Hunter Claw and the Beetleborgs' Sonic Lasers. He was later released from the comics by Nukus in the Season Finale. Super Grenade Guy * First Appearance: \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Scary\\" (4/25/97) * Voice Actor: Michael Sorich Grenade Guy was brought back by Noxic who claimed that he was much more powerful than last time. He could self-destruct and pull his dismembered body back together at any time. The Beetleborgs focused and blasted their weapons at him, for an extended period of time, causing his levels to rise to a dangerous amount. Once his meters were full, he exploded for a final time and was sent back to the comics. He was later released from the comics by Nukus in the Season Finale. Kombat Gnat * First Appearance: \\"Buggin' Out\\" (4/28/97) * Voice Actor: Billy Forester Kombat Gnat is a blue/lavender gnat monster with large teeth that could shrink in size so he could act as a spy at Hillhurst. However, Flabber was messing around with a teleportation machine while Kombat Gnat crept inside. The machine fused them together and Flabber slowly transformed into Combat Gnat (similar to Jeff Goldblum in The Fly). The Beetleborgs were faced with a difficult dilemma: let Charterville get destroyed by Kombat Gnat, or fight Kombat Gnat (which meant having to fight Flabber) and risk losing Flabber forever. Kombat Gnat was destroyed and sent back by the Beetleborgs' weapons, but Flabber somehow survived much to the happy surprise of the kids and Hillhurst monsters. He later reappeared in the Season Finale (minus Flabber attached to him) when Nukus released him amongst other monsters where he was taken down for good by Drew's Thunder Stinger (in Mega Blue Beetleborg mode). Hypnomaniac * First Appearance: \\"Svengali, By Golly\\" (5/2/97) * Voice Actor: Joey Lotsko An insectoid sorcerer-like monster with hypnotic abilities. Vexor was tired of the trio's failures. After they bungled their mission to capture Flabber, Vexor fired them. Hypnomaniac was summoned to hypnotize the Hillhurst monsters into becoming Vexor's new servants. Ultimately, Hypnomaniac fell victim to Drew's Thunder Stinger (in regular Blue Stinger mode). He was later released from the comics by Nukus amongst other monsters in the Season Finale where his head was later seen as the seemingly main head of Borgslayer. Evil Eye * First Appearance: \\"Big Bad Luck\\" (5/5/97) * Voice Actor: Frank Tahoe A green skeleton monster with a peach-colored head that has one green eye and has smaller skulls on its upper back. The Magnavores were hiding in the Hillhurst attic to cause bad luck for Flabber and the house monsters. They turned things up a notch by calling Evil Eye. Evil Eye's powers came from his eye; by attacking the eye, Evil Eye would be defeated. And he was when the lasers he shot from his eye were reflected back onto him with a reflective old hubcap that the Beetleborgs used. He was later released from the comics by Nukus in the Season Finale. Rocket Man * First Appearance: \\"A Monster is Born\\" (5/9/97) * Voice Actor: Oliver Kat Rocket Man was a blue robot that fired blinding flash bombs. The Magnavores left a baby at Hillhurst. Little did they know, the baby was really Rocket Man in disguise. However, Rocket Man briefly reverted to a baby-like persona when Flabber materialized an over-sized bottle to distract him. The Beetleborgs took the window of opportunity and defeated him with the Sonic Lasers. Super Noxic * First Appearance: \\"Brotherly Fright\\" (5/16/97) * Voice Actor: Derek Stephen Prince Noxic's younger brother that looks like Noxic, but very muscular. The Hillhurst monsters were getting in shape with Flabber's aerobic workout, but Noxic wanted to make the exercise brutal. He summoned his brother, who disguised himself as an S&M; muscle- headed trainer named Hurt-Ulese. As Hurt-Ulese, he put the Hillhurst monsters through the most intense workout they had ever experienced. His true identity was found out by the kids, though, when Jo found his ID in his gym bag - the picture ID had the face of Super Noxic on it. Soon afterwards, he revealed himself to the kids and took them on in battle. He and Noxic briefly combined in battle, with Noxic controlling him from the inside. While Super Noxic proved to be a tough opponent for the Beetleborgs, he turned out to be no match for Drew's Thunder Stinger (in Mega Blue Beetleborg mode). Before being sent back to the comics, Super Noxic released Noxic from being pulled back in with him. Borgslayer * First Appearance: \\"Borgslayer!\\" (5/20/97) * Voice Actors: Bob Papenbrook and Dave Mallow (simultaneous) The final monster of Season One. After Nukus was brought to life, he brought out 14 Beetleborgs monsters (Graxxis, LottaMuggs, Garganturat, Amphead, Cyber-Serpent, Dicehead, Porkasaurus, Mucant, Crimson Creep, Unctuous, Super Grenade Guy, Kombat Knat, Hypnomaniac, and Evil Eye) from their comic issues to battle the Beetleborgs. During battle, a few monsters (namely Kombat Knat and Dicehead) were sent back again by Drew (who was in Mega Blue Beetleborg mode) before Nukus fused the energies of every one of Vexor's remaining monsters with the energies of the Beetleborgs' blaster powers to create one massive creature called Borgslayer, a composite monster that resembled Hypnomaniac with many monster faces on his front torso and large arms (among which were the faces of Vexor's brief second form, Shadowborg, Evil Eye, Kombat Knat, Malavex, Wingar, and Goldex). Borgslayer was far too powerful as he destroyed Gargantis with little to no trouble, while the Magnavore Jet Fighters destroyed the Beetle Battle Base and all 3 A.V.'s. The only way to defeat Borgslayer was for the Beetleborgs to triangulate their firepower. By doing so, Borgslayer was finished and the residual energy from the explosion managed to suck all the Magnavores and Vexor, back into the comic book world forever. Beetleborgs Metallix Here are the monsters that are brought out of Les Fortunes' drawings by Nukus. They are adapted from B-Fighter Kabuto: Aqualungs * First Appearance: \\"Ghoul Trouble\\" (9/11/97) * Voice Actor: Bob Papenbrook Aqualungs is a red-and-yellow prehistoric starfish monster who had the ability to liquify his body, making him a difficult attack target. He was sent to infiltrate Hillhurst through the pipes in the basement. After a one-on-one with Roland, he was defeated with the Metallix Grappler. Hagfish of Gar * First Appearance: \\"Totally Slammin' Sector Cycles\\" (9/12/97) Les was inspired by the legend of the Hagfish of Gar, a Beelzebufo-like monster that could hypnotize the minds of children with its singing. After creating a real Hagfish, it was unleashed so Nukus could capture the Beetleborgs while under the Hagfish's trance. However, the signal was useless when the Beetleborgs were borged. In fact, it even blocked the signal to the Beetle Battle Station when they tried to summon the B.V.'s. So the Crustaceans proceeded to hypnotize all the other kids in Charterville by amplifying Hagfish's singing with a stolen truck and loud speakers. Another technique Hagfish could do was to spray opponents with a very sticky goo, as demonstrated after Nukus releases him and sprays Les, and later Drew and Jo on their new Sector Cycles (which they, along with Roland, were taking out for a test-drive; they were to be activated using their Data Bonders). Hagfish ended up defeated by the Beetleborgs' Data Lasers. Changeling * First Appearance: \\"Monster Impostor\\" (9/16/97) * Voice Actor: Ethan Murray A shapeshifting salamander monster that looks like it is composed of many salamanders. He could disguise himself as any house monster, even Flabber. When on a mission to infiltrate Hillhurst, Changeling captured Flabber in a jar and took over his identity. At one point, he even disguised himself as Drew. Roland defeated the Changeling with his Metallix Grappler. His picture was seen among the many of Les' drawings that were combined with toxic chemicals and Nukus' powers to create Repgillian. Fernzilla * First Appearance: \\"Horror Hotel\\" (9/17/97) * Voice Actor: Juliana Bolden Fernzilla is a fern monster that could control vines to entangle anything and shot out deadly pollen spores from the vines sprouting from her head. Flabber and the monsters converted their mansion into a hotel. Among the hotel guests was an old hag who was really Fernzilla in disguise. She ended up losing to the Beetleborgs when she was shot by their Data Lasers. Her picture was seen among the many of Les' drawings that were combined with toxic chemicals and Nukus' powers to create Repgillian. Roo-thless * First Appearance: \\"Les is More\\" (9/18/97) * Voice Actor: Lance Wingnut A boxing giant kangaroo monster with a voice like Mickey Mouse and Mike Tyson, brought to life by Vilor much against Nukus' wishes (though Vilor did tell Nukus that Les brought him to life). Monsters that were not brought to life by Nukus himself were uncontrollable and if he wasn't sent back in 24 hours, all 2 dimensional beings, meaning the Crustaceans, would be forced back to the 2nd dimension. He had boxing gloves and a sword and could fire energy blasts from his pouch. It took the unlikely teamwork of the Beetleborgs, Nukus, and Horribelle to send Roo-thless back where he belonged. Ultimate Conqueror * First Appearance: \\"Sunset Boo-levard\\" (9/19/97) * Voice Actor: Henry Douglas Grey Basically, he claims to be what his name suggests, but there is not much to him. Ultimate Conqueror is a strong white-scaled horned chameleon monster with horns and large claws. He had the Beetleborgs beaten, but he quickly met his match at the mercy of a has-been actress who simply screamed in his face enough to knock him over. The Beetleborgs took the opportunity to then defeat the monster with their weapons. Torch Mouth * First Appearance: \\"Extra...Beetleborgs Revealed\\" (9/22/97) * Voice Actor: Brad Orchard A fire- breathing smilodon monster that looked like a combination of a mouse with a tiger's second head on his forehead. He can breathe fire out of his tiger head. He was used by the Crustaceans to capture a reporter. He succumbed to Drew's Data Laser, which was in Freeze Ray mode. His picture was seen among the many of Les' drawings that were combined with toxic chemicals and Nukus' powers to create Repgillian. Ultra Vulture * First Appearance: \\"Who's That Ghoul?\\" (9/23/97) * Voice Actor: Gene Holliday A fiery wind-breathing armored Teratornis monster. His fiery wind breath set the forests near Hillhurst on fire. Les called him the \\"Ultimate Bird of Prey.\\" Ultra Vulture fell prey to the Beetleborgs' power weapons instead. Nukus was not pleased that Ultra Vulture didn't live up to his description. His picture was seen among the many of Les' drawings that were combined with toxic chemicals and Nukus' powers to create Repgillian. Brain Sucker * First Appearance: \\"Attack of the Brain Suckers\\" (9/24/97) * Voice Actor: Brett Walkow Les began his own line of comics called Brain Sucker. The main character is a gray scorpionfish monster who had the ability to drain the intellect from anyone (by merely doing what his name suggests - sucking their brains), even Nano and the Hillhurst monsters (minus Frankenbeans, who apparently had no brains for the monster to suck on). Brain Sucker was created, according to the story, by the Monster Mother herself, and was hatched from an egg she laid in her lair. In battle, Brain Sucker could blast sharp darts from its mouth. The Data Lasers did this hideous creature in once and for all. After this, Nano, the Hillhurst monsters, and all of the Brain Sucker's other victims regained their intelligence. Monster Smasher * First Appearance: \\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\" (9/29/97) An orange deformed woolly mammoth monster. The Grim Reaper was in town and rumor had it that he was seeking a successor before retiring. Nukus got word of the news and had Les draw Monster Smasher. Nukus and Monster Smasher were on their way to Hillhurst to eliminate the competition so Nukus could become the next Grim Reaper. They never got far, though, as Roland and Jo (on their Sector Cycles) eliminated Monster Smasher with their Beetle Battlers, forcing an angry Nukus to retreat. Triplesaurus Rex * First Appearance: \\"The Old Gray Flabber\\" (10/3/97) * Voice Actor: Ari Ross A blue 3-headed Tyrannosaurus monster with two short arms and two long tail-shaped tentacles. Les had drawn a portrait of Flabber which caused him to get old (in a situation akin to a revered \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\"). Les then drew Triplesaurus Rex to distract the Beetleborgs from Flabber's rapid aging. After Triplesaurus Rex was seemingly destroyed by the Beetleborgs, his 3 heads came back to attack them. They ended up getting taken out of the picture also. Triplesaurus Rex's picture was seen among the many of Les' drawings that were combined with toxic chemicals and Nukus' powers to create Repgillian. Piranha Khan * First Appearance: \\"Son of Frankenbeans\\" (10/10/97) * Voice Actor: Robert Axelrod A black coelacanth/piranha monster who attacked the Beetleborgs while they were in the midst of their dissent stemming from the contest to see who was the best Beetleborg. Only after they learned to work together again does this monster get defeated. Emily the Seed of Evil * First Appearance: \\"How Does Your Garden Grow?\\" (10/20/97) * Voice Actor: Anne Britt Makebakken Little Ghoul was taking up a hobby in seed planting, so Horribelle took advantage by sending her a seed created by Les. The seed grew into a cactus (which Little Ghoul decided to name Emily), and then into a full female cactus monster, armed with a cactus shaped sword, which sucked the life out of Flabber and the house monsters in the process. However Little Ghoul had grown so attached to the monster, that she did not want the Beetleborgs to destroy her. The Beetleborgs decided they needed a distraction for the monster and Jo decided plant food was the best one for the job. Hearing that Emily needed help, Nukus sent Vilor and the Dregs to battle. Drew and Roland took on them while Jo took on Emily. But, with a heavy heart, she used her finisher (the Metallix Baton) on the monster, and then the others joined her, using the Data Lasers, to send Emily back to paper form. After destroying Emily, Jo thought about what Little Ghoul would think of all this, so the kids and Flabber decided to give Little Ghoul a new hobby to cheer her up. Fangula Bat Monster * First Appearance: \\"The Curse of The Mummy's Mommy\\" (10/30/97) * Voice Actor: Joe Hackett During a scuffle between Les Fortunes and the Hillhurst monsters, Fangula was accidentally transformed into a giant vampire bat monster by Mums' family heirloom (a sacred ring passed down to him by his mother). Mums was later captured by Horribelle while the ring was stuck on his finger. His mother agreed to reverse the spell only if her son was returned to her safely. Once Mums was rescued from Nukus' clutches, the spell was reversed thus turning Fangula back to normal in the midst of his battle with the Beetleborgs. El Scorpio * First Appearance: \\"Halloween Haunted House of Horrors\\" (10/31/97) * Voice Actor: L.B. Bartholomew A yellow sea scorpion monster sent to infiltrate a Halloween party at Hillhurst. The Beetleborgs lured him outside and to an abandoned warehouse. El Scorpio could split his body to attack multiple opponents. Once outside, the Beetleborgs sent him back to the 2-D world after a short battle. Shellator * First Appearance: \\"Booger Man\\" (11/3/97) * Voice Actor: Dave Mallow Shellator is a green/yellow trilobite monster who can grow to giant size during battle. Les was running out of ideas, so the Crustaceans captured a Bogeyman called Booger Man to give Les nightmares to serve as inspiration and Shellator was created (Shellator was the monster that appeared in Les's nightmare). During Shellator's fight against the Beetleborgs, Shellator grew to giant size. The Beetleborgs managed to cut him down to normal size, then put the final blow on him with their Data Lasers. Mole Monster * First Appearance: \\"The Poe and the Pendulum\\" (11/6/97) * Voice Actor: Michael McConnohie A brown mole monster with red hair and sharp claws who was capable of digging underground. He was used to steal the book of Edgar Allan Poe's ghost, who was visiting Hillhurst at the time. The Beetleborgs' power weapons sent him spinning back to Les's drawing. He would be the final monster seen before the Lost Comic era. Monster Mother: Root of all Evil * First Appearance: \\"Experiment in Evil\\" (2/23/98) Monster Mother was originally shown on a screen summoned by Nukus' power, with Les' narration, to demonstrate the birth and history of \\"Brain Sucker comics\\". Outside of the Brain Sucker comics origin, this monster was created by Dr. Frankenbeans. The Hillhurst monsters were tired of being caught in the middle of the Beetleborgs' war, so they enlist the doctor's assistance. However, Dr. Frankenbeans and the creation were captured. When the Beetleborgs went to save him, they soon discovered that the Crustaceans fled in fear of the monster after she hatched from her egg. To kill Dr. Frankenbeans' monster, they had to sever the main root. They did so with their Mega Spectra armor and mega-weapons (Drew's Wrist-Rocket, Roland's Spectra-Lance, and Jo's Cross-Bow). Repgillian * First Appearance: \\"Mega Borg Power\\" (3/2/98) * Voice Actor: Anne Britt Makebakken The final monster the Beetleborgs faced. Repgillian was created from mixing toxic chemicals, Les' old drawings (consisting of Changeling, Fernzilla, Torch Mouth, Ultra Vulture and Triplesaurus Rex), and Nukus' powers, and when sent to Charterville, attacked the city as a giant. This creature was more powerful than anything the Beetleborgs had ever faced, and even Roboborg had trouble when he fought her. In a last-ditch effort, Roland stole the Astral Ax from the Crustaceans and called on Boron, which subsequently caused Boron to switch sides and join the Beetleborgs' side. It took the combination of the Mega Spectra Beetleborgs, Roboborg and Boron to finally destroy Repgillian.

It broadcast as an independent station until picking up the Fox network affiliation on September 1, 2005. Prior to this, Fox had only been carried as a secondary affiliation, first on NBC affiliate KUAM-TV, then on KTGM (which Sorensen acquired in November 2005) from 1990 onward, until near the end of the decade, when KTGM dropped it to focus on ABC programming. After this, local cable systems carried San Francisco Bay Area affiliate KTVU before the network affiliated with KEQI. The station airs a mix of Fox network programming and syndicated fare. It also airs the Fox primetime schedule on the same week as the continental United States, except that shows are aired on a Tuesday-through-Monday pattern rather than the Monday-through-Sunday pattern, since Guam is a day ahead of the United States. This does not apply to live sports, which mainly air live early in the morning. KEQI's syndicated programming includes Entertainment Tonight and Inside Edition. These same programs are also repeated on KTGM. In 2008, the station added news programming from the Philippines, using content from ABS-CBN and its sister news cable channel ANC through The Filipino Channel, throughout the day when they do not air any Fox programming.

His performing career began at age 14 with the Young Oregonians in Portland, Oregon where he met and played with Native American saxophonist, Jim Pepper. He graduated with a degree in History and Literature from the University of Oregon. His formal bass instruction started after college with Jerome Magil in Portland, James Harnett in Seattle, Gary Karr in New York, Plough Christenson in Copenhagen, Ludwig Streicher in Vienna and Francois Rabbath in Hawaii. For the past 30 years, Glen has played a Klotz bass fiddle crafted in Tyrol circa 1715 on which he has made extensive use of a unique tuning with both a low and high C string. Moore is a founding member of Oregon, but worked also regularly with Rabih Abou-Khalil, Vasant Rai, Nancy King and Larry Karush.

His mathematics professors were Karel Petr (1868‚Äì1950), Jan Sobotka (1862‚Äì1931) and then beginning Bohumil Byd≈æovsk√Ω (1880‚Äì1969). He attended physics lectures by ƒåenƒõk Strouhal (1850‚Äì1922), Bohumil Kuƒçera (1874‚Äì1921), Franti≈°ek Kol√°ƒçek (1851‚Äì1913) and Franti≈°ek Z√°vi≈°ka (1879‚Äì1945). He obtained his doctorate in 1911 with a thesis on the Problem of Dirichlet and Neumann with integral equations. Then he did his one-year military service and afterwards taught at a business school in Prague in 1912-1914. During World War I Trkal was twice wounded and in March 1915 he was made prisoner of war by the Russians, after he first was considered dead but shouted \\"Don't shoot!\\" to a Russian soldier. He then stayed in several prison camps where he also contracted malaria. He wrote to Professor Orest Khvolson of St. Petersburg. Thanks to his advocacy, Trkal was assigned to the new University of Perm in the Urals, where he obtained his habilitation qualification and became associate professor of mechanics and physics in 1918. After the war he returned to Czechoslovakia where he taught in high school and became a physics assistant to Professor Z√°vi≈°ka. In the academic year October 1919 - June 1920 Trkal studied with Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Paul Ehrenfest in Leiden, where he was Ehrenfest's assistant and met Albert Einstein. In 1921 he graduated from the University of Prague in theoretical physics. In 1922 he was appointed extraordinary and in 1929 a full professor of theoretical physics.

He was born in New Orleans. In a seven-season career, Bonura posted a .307 batting average (1099-for-3582) with 119 home runs and 704 RBI in 917 games played. Defensively, he was a good first baseman, recording a career .992 fielding percentage. One of Bonura's more noteworthy athletic accomplishments has nothing to do with the sport of baseball. In June 1925, at the age of sixteen, Bonura became the youngest male athlete ever to win an event at the National (AAU) Track and Field Championships. He threw the javelin 65.18 meters (213-10) to claim the title. Bonura's winning effort was a meet record by nearly twenty-feet; a prodigious mark that remained on the books until 1930.http://www.legacy.usatf.org/statistics/champions/USAOutdoorTF/men/mJT.asp Military service in 1941, Bonura joined the army and was stationed at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. With the outbreak of World War II, he was recalled to active duty, and returned to Camp Shelby where he was in charge of organizing baseball. In mid 1943, he was posted to Oran, Algeria. He organized large- scale baseball operations, consisting of 150 teams in 6 leagues. Playoffs among the teams narrowed them to two finalists ‚Äì the Casablanca Yankees, consisting of medics, and the Algiers Streetwalkers, consisting of MPs. The North African World Series was a best two-out-of-three-game championship played on October 3 and 4, 1943, at Eugene Stadium in Algiers, Algeria, between the two teams. The Casablanca Yankees won the series in two straight games. The winners were presented with baseballs autographed by General Eisenhower, and the winning team received a trophy made from an unexploded Italian bomb. In mid 1945, Bonura was discharged from the army with the rank of master sergeant. He received the Legion of Merit medal while serving in the US Army during World War II, for his work as athletic director for the Army in Algeria in 1943 in 1944. Highlights * Hit .300 or more in four of his seven major league seasons, with a career-high .345 in 1937, fourth in the American League, behind Charlie Gehringer (.371), Lou Gehrig (.351) and Joe DiMaggio (.346). * Averaged 17 home runs per season, with a career-high 27 in his 1934 rookie season, setting a White Sox team record.

Definition Strictly speaking, all refinancing of debt is \\"cash-out,\\" when funds retrieved are utilized for anything other than repaying an existing loan. In the case of common usage of the term, cash out refinancing refers to when equity is liquidated from a property above and beyond sum of the payoff of existing loans held in lien on the property, loan fees, costs associated with the loan, taxes, insurance, tax reserves, insurance reserves, and in the past any other non-lien debt held in the name of the owner being paid by loan proceeds. Example of cash out refinancing A homeowner who owes $80,000 on a home valued at $200,000 has $120,000 in equity. This equity can be liquidated with a cash-out refinance loan providing the loan is larger than $80,000. The total amount of equity that can be withdrawn with a cash-out refinance is dependent on the mortgage lender, the cash-out refinance program, and other relative factors, such as the value of the home. How does a cash out refinance differ from a home equity loan? * A home equity loan is a separate loan on top of a first mortgage. * A cash-out refinance is a replacement of a first mortgage. * The interest rates on a cash-out refinancing are usually, but not always, lower than the interest rate on a home equity loan. * The borrower pays the mortgage refinance closing costs. * Generally, the borrower does not pay closing costs for a home equity loan. * Closing costs can amount to hundreds or thousands of dollars. Related topics The opposite, \\"rate-and-term\\" refinancing, occurs when a better note rate, better loan terms, or both become available to an owner which restructures their debt portfolio as it relates to liens held against a subject property. Consolidating multiple loans into one loan without extracting cash is also a rate-and-term. Loan-to-value limits, and other factors in loan approval determine how much cash can be taken out from the equity of any one property.

The story tells of the fortunes of a group of schoolboys stranded on a deserted island in the South Pacific, and of their struggles to overcome adversity. In his preface to the book, Verne explains that his goals were to create a Robinson Crusoe-like environment for children, and to show the world what the intelligence and bravery of a child were capable of when put to the test. Plot summary Map of \\"Chairman Island\\" The story takes place in March 1860 and opens with a group of schoolboys aged between eight and fourteen on board a 100-ton schooner called the Sleuth moored at Auckland, New Zealand, and preparing to set off on a six-week vacation. With the exception of the oldest boy Gordon, an American, and Briant and Jack, two French brothers, all the boys are British. While the schooner's crew are ashore, the moorings are cast-off under unknown circumstances and the ship drifts to sea, where it is caught by a storm. Twenty-two days later, the boys find themselves cast upon the shore of an uncharted island, which they name \\"Chairman Island.\\" They go on many adventures and even catch wild animals while trying to survive. They remain there for the next two years until a passing ship sinks in the close vicinity of the island. The ship had been taken over by mutineers, intent on trafficking slaves. With the aid of two of the surviving members of the original crew, the boys are able to defeat the mutineers and make their escape from the island, which they find out is close to the Chilean coast (Hanover- Island located at 50¬∞56‚Äô S, 74¬∞47‚Äô W).  Publication  As with most of Verne's works, it was serialized (in twenty-four parts between January and December 1888) in the \\"Extraordinary Journeys\\" section of the French Magasin d‚Äô√âducation et de R√©cr√©ation by the Parisian publisher Hetzel. It was also published in book form in two volumes in June and early November of that year. An illustrated double volume with a color map and a preface by Verne was released in late November.  Translations and adaptations * An English translation of the book was serialized in 36 installments in the Boy's Own Paper between 1888 and 1889. * In 1889 a two-volume English-language book titled A Two Year's Vacation was published by Munro in the United States.

History The Salesian College, Celbridge was original formed in 1981 in a disused primary school on the Hazeltatch Road, which is now the Church of Ireland Primary School. Fr. Tony McEvoy SDB was the first principal with four staff members and fifty-five students. In the summer of 1984, the school moved to a newly built premises, where it remains today. The new school and sports grounds are situated on fifteen acres, and there have been a number of developments and extensions since then. As of 2019, the school has over 700 students and over 50 staff. Subjects Salesians offers Junior Certificate, Transition Year, and Leaving Certificate courses, as well as a unit for autistic youths. The school's classes have been mixed since 2004. In the Leaving Certificate cycle, courses in biology, chemistry, and physics are offered. The Junior-cycle subject broadly defined as \\"Business Studies\\" is devolved into separate courses accounting, business and economics. Students may also pursue courses in art, construction, technical drawing or engineering. The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, which aims to provide a more vocation- oriented education can also be taken by students of the College. The school also has IT facilities. Sport Sports played at Salesians include soccer, athletics, hurling, rugby, badminton and Gaelic football. An annual road race, held each October, is a road race participated in by around 450 students. The Fr. Archer Cup, named after the late Fr. Charles Archer, a former teacher, is awarded to the winner. Salesians won the U14 All-Ireland Soccer Final in 2006. The Salesians' senior soccer team advanced to the Senior Soccer All-Ireland final in 2008 in Buckley's Park in Kilkenny, but ultimately lost 2‚Äì1 to CBS of Sexton Street in Limerick. They reached the final again in 2010 when they lost to St. Marys, Galway, in the last minute of extra time. The Salesian Senior football team reached the All-Ireland \\"B\\" semi finally in 2010, losing to √âire √ìg in Carlow by 2 points. The U16 football team reached the Leinster \\"B\\" Final against Moath CBS, where they lost by 2 goals the same year. Staff The school is no longer run by priests of the Salesian order. The principal is Brenda Kearns, who took up the position on 17 August 2009 succeeding Fr. Dan Carroll. There are over 60 teachers in the school in total. Each year in the school is given a 'Year Head' who is responsible for that year. It varies from year to year but the 'Year Head' of Transition Year is permanent. Resource The Resource Department (Centre) was set up in 2005 by Mark Ryan, a teacher in the school. It first started off in three rooms in the school. It was set up to help students with learning difficulties and disorders. A newer facility was later opened in August 2009 by the school Principal Brenda Kearns. There are currently about nine teachers in the Resource Department with seven Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Associations A Parents' Association was established focusing on Salesian College in 1994. The Parents' Association is involved with producing a newsletter, in pastoral and remedial requirements. The Salesian college student council, over the years, helped to raise money for a defibrillator, installed new basketball equipment and organised the first ever student-led talent show. The student council has been inactive since 2014.

It is the only member in monotypic genus Semioptera. Etymology George Robert Gray of the British Museum named this species in honour of Alfred Russel Wallace, British naturalist and author of The Malay Archipelago, who in 1858 was the first European to describe the bird. The generic name Semioptera is composed of semeion for a flag or military standard and ptera for wings. Subspecies and taxonomy The standardwing bird-of-paradises' closest relatives are the superb birds-of-paradise (Lophorina species), and actually evolved after the Drepanornis sicklebills, making them one of their other closest relatives. It has two subspecies: *Semioptera wallacii halmaherae Salvadori, 1881 *Semioptera wallacii wallacii Gray, 1859 Conservation status A common species in its limited habitat range, the standardwing bird-of-paradise is evaluated as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species due to its increasingly fragmented habitat. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES. Description Semioptera wallacii wallacii male. Museum specimen The standardwing bird-of-paradise is medium-sized, approximately 28 cm long, and olive brown. The male has a gloss violet-and-lilac coloured crown and emerald-green breast shield. Its most striking features are two pairs of long white plumes coming out from the bend of the wing that can be raised or lowered at the bird's will. The unadorned olive-brown female is smaller but has a longer tail than the male. Behaviour and ecology The males are polygamous. They gather and perform a spectacular aerial display, \\"parachuting\\" with wings and its vivid green breast shield spread, and the wing \\"standards\\" fluttering above its back. Its diet consists mainly of insects, arthropods and fruits. Distribution The standardwing is endemic to Northern Maluku in eastern Indonesia and is the westernmost species of the true birds-of-paradise. It can be found on the islands of Halmahera and Bacan in lowland tropical rainforests and hills, and occasionally in woodland. History The first introduction of a bird-of-paradise to Europe was a result of Ferdinand Magellan's first circumnavigation of the earth. When the voyagers were at Tidore in December 1521, they were offered a gift of beautiful dead birds by the ruler of Bacan to give to the King of Spain. Based on the circumstances and description of the birds in Antonio Pigafetta's account of the voyage, they were likely standardwings. An alternate account by Maximilianus Transylvanus introduced the term manucodiata (a corruption of the Malay manute-dewata; \\"bird of the gods\\"), used for birds-of-paradise up to the 19th century. Following its original discovery in 1858, the standardwing bird- of-paradise was not seen again for nearly 60 years, and then only a handful of times until 1953. No further sightings were reported until the British ornithologist David Bishop rediscovered the species in 1983 and began making the first detailed observations of its behaviour. The standardwing bird-of- paradise was filmed for the first time in 1986 for the BBC nature documentary Birds for All Seasons, when a cameraman Michael W. Richards stationed in the canopy captured footage of a male bird displaying. Ten years later, David Attenborough observed a mass display of dozens of males for the BBC Natural World film \\"Attenborough in Paradise\\", leading him to speculate that the reason for their extravagant behaviour is to establish the hierarchy for breeding rights, rather than to directly impress the females.

She was considered part of the \\"Literary Brat Pack\\", whose members included Bret Easton Ellis, Jay McInerney, and Tama Janowitz.The Harvard Crimson Like her contemporaries at Bennington, she sometimes wrote in a sparse minimalist style influenced by such writers as Raymond Carver and Joan Didion. Her first novel, From Rockaway, published by Knopf in 1987, was submitted as her MFA thesis while at Columbia University. The book is a coming-of-age tale about four teenagers from Rockaway Beach in Queens. The protagonist, Alex, escapes the working- class milieux with a scholarship to the fictional Camden College (a stand-in for Bennington) while her three friends work menial jobs and live in the now, spending summers lifeguarding and winters doing odd jobs. Eventually the foursome reunites at a beachside party and comes to terms with their diverging lives. Publishers Weekly called it a \\"finely tuned first novel.\\" From Rockaway was translated into six languages and optioned by film director Sydney Pollack. It was re-issued by Little, Brown & Co in 2017. Eisenstadt followed with a second Knopf novel, Kiss Out, in 1991 and a third novel, Swell in 2017. While not a sequel, Swell is also set in Rockaway Beach and features several characters from her first novel.

Discovery and naming In 1970, a Polish-Mongolian expedition discovered an ankylosaurian skull near Khulsan. In 1977, Teresa Marya≈Ñska named and described the type species Tarchia kielanae. The generic name is derived from Mongolian tarkhi, \\"brain\\" and Latin ~ia, in reference to a brain size presumed larger than that of the related form Saichania. The specific name honours Professor Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, the leader of the expedition. Skull PIN 3142/250, which has been referred to both Saichania and Tarchia The holotype, ZPal MgD-I/111, was discovered in the Upper Cretaceous (possibly Campanian-Maastrichtian) Barun Goyot Formation (previously known as the 'Lower Nemegt Beds') of the Nemegt Basin of Mongolia. It consists of a skull roof, braincase and rear skull elements.Marya≈Ñska, T. 1977. \\"Ankylosauridae (Dinosauria) from Mongolia\\". Palaeontologia Polonica 37: 85-151 Marya≈Ñska referred three additional specimens: ZPAL MgDI/43, a large postcranial skeleton containing three \\"free\\" tail vertebrae, twelve tail vertebrae of the \\"handle\\" of the tail club and a scute; ZPAL MgDI/49, a right humerus; and PIN 3142/251, a skeleton with skull, that as yet remains undescribed. Tarchia is the geologically youngest of all known Asian ankylosaurid dinosaurs. In 1977, Tatyana Tumanova named a second species: Tarchia gigantea. This was a renaming of Dyoplosaurus giganteus Maleev 1956, which had been based on specimen PIN 551/29.Tumanova, T. A. 1977. \\"New data on the ankylosaur Tarchia gigantea\\", Paleontological Journal 11: 480-486 In 1987, Tumanova concluded that both species were identical. This would make Dyoplosaurus giganteus the senior synonym of Tarchia kielanae.T.A. Tumanova, 1987, Pantsirnyye dinozavry Mongolii, Trudy Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya 32, 80 pp This was generally accepted and Tarchia gigantea became the usual species name, as a combinatio nova replacing Tarchia kielanae. However, recent study by Victoria Megan Arbour indicates that D. giganteus is indistinguishable from other ankylosaurs from the late Campanian-Maastrichtian of Mongolia, and hence a nomen dubium; the study revived the name Tarchia kielanae.Arbour, Victoria Megan, 2014. Systematics, evolution, and biogeography of the ankylosaurid dinosaurs. Ph.D thesis, University of Alberta. https://era.library.ualberta.ca/public/.../Arbour_Victoria_Spring2014.pdf A rump with tail and club, specimen ZPAL MgD I/113, once referred to Dyoplosaurus giganteus and subsequently to Tarchia gigantea, was by Arbour seen as different from the D. giganteus holotype.Victoria M. Arbour, Nicolai L. Lech-Hernes, Tom E. Guldberg, J√∏rn H. Hurum, and Philip J. Currie, 2013, \\"An ankylosaurid dinosaur from Mongolia with in situ armour and keratinous scale impressions\\", Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 58(1): 55-64 Cast of a tail club assigned to T. gigantea The study by Arbour also concluded that specimen PIN 3142/250, in 1977 referred to Tarchia by Tumanova, probably belonged to Saichania instead. This would radically change the common image of Tarchia as this exemplar had been by far the best preserved and most illustrations, museum mounts and indeed scientific research had been based on it. Arbour discovered that the holotype of Tarchia shared distinguishing traits with that of Minotaurasaurus Miles & Miles 2009, concluding that the latter is a junior synonym of Tarchia.Victoria M. Arbour, Philip J. Currie and Demchig Badamgarav, 2014, \\"The ankylosaurid dinosaurs of the Upper Cretaceous Baruungoyot and Nemegt formations of Mongolia\\", Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 172(3): 631‚Äì652 Subsequently, in 2016, a study conducted by Penkalski & Tumanova indicated that PIN 3142/250 is not referable to Saichania due to significant anatomical differences, but instead represents a new species of Tarchia, T. teresae. The study also recognized Minotaurasaurus as a distinct genus. Description Size estimates of Tarchia have been largely based on Dyoplosaurus giganteus, the holotype of which is one of the largest ankylosaurian individuals known. This would make Tarchia the longest known Asian ankylosaur, with an estimated body length of .Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix. Confusingly, the skull size often mentioned, with a length of and width of , was again based on specimen PIN 3142/250, a much smaller individual. The holotypes of Tarchia kielanae and Minotaurasaurus also indicate a medium size. In 2016, Gregory S. Paul had estimated a body length of 5.5 meters (18 ft) and a weight of 2.5 tonnes (2.75 short tons) suggesting that Minotaurasaurus was a juvenile of the species.Paul, G.S., 2016, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs 2nd Edition, Princeton University Press p. 261 As an ankylosaurid, Tarchia would have had a broad, low-slung body, positioned on strong short legs. The body would have been protected by skin ossifications, named osteoderms. It probably had a bony tail club, for active defence against predators. Front view of PIN 3142/250, holotype of T. teresae Tarchia had previously been distinguished from Saichania on the basis of its relatively larger basicranium, an unfused paroccipital process-quadrate contact and, based on PIN 3142/250, the fact that the premaxillary rostrum is wider than the maximum distance between the tooth rows in the maxillaries. In 2014, Arbour reported two distinguishing traits apart from those known exclusively from the holotype of Minotaurasaurus; the back of the head is visible in top view; and a deep groove runs along the front and outer side of the squamosal horn, and at the front it surrounds around an accessory osteoderm placed on the rear supraorbital, forming a deep furrow. The 2016 redescription of Tarchia notes that it differs from Saichania in having a postorbital fossa (which separates the squamosal horn from the supraorbital) and an accessory osteoderm; the occiput being visible in dorsal view; the large, deep braincase; the foramen magnum being higher than it is wide; and the nuchal osteoderms being taller laterally than medially. In addition, it differs from both Saichania and Minotaurasaurus in that it lacks postocular caputegulae (or small, polygonal bony plates behind the orbit) and has a proportionally high occiput in caudal view. The study additionally found that PIN 3142/250 (i.e. T. teresae) can be distinguished from T. kielanae in that the accessory osteoderm is not fused to the roof of the skull, the quadrate and paroccipital process are not fused, the back of the skull roof is strongly sculptured, and the openings for the fourth to twelfth cranial nerves is bifurcated. Much information given about Tarchia in older work refers to PIN 3142/250 (which was briefly referred to Saichania until it was named as T. teresae in 2016). In 2001, it was stated that, in Tarchia, wear facets indicative of tooth-to-tooth occlusion are present;Barrett, P.M. 2001. \\"Tooth wear and possible jaw action in Scelidosaurus harrisonii and a review of feeding mechanisms in other thyreophoran dinoaurs\\", in Carpenter, K. (ed.) The Armored Dinosaurs. Indiana University Press, Bloomington. pp. 25‚Äì52 this likely does not refer to the holotype specimen, since in the holotype no teeth are preserved. Phylogeny Vickaryous et alii in 2004 stated that Tarchia was basal to two distinct clades of Late Cretaceous ankylosaurids: one comprising North American taxa (Ankylosaurus, Euoplocephalus) and the other comprising Asian taxa (Pinacosaurus spp., Saichania, Tianzhenosaurus, Talarurus).Vickaryous, Marya≈Ñska, and Weishampel, 2004, Chapter Seventeen: \\"Ankylosauria\\", in: The Dinosauria (2nd edition), Weishampel, D. B., Dodson, P., and Osm√≥lska, H., editors. University of California Press. However, this was again based on PIN 3142/250, the characters of which usually defined the operational taxonomic unit named Tarchia in the various cladistic analyses. Remarkably, Tarchia and Saichania nevertheless in these analyses often occupied very different positions. ZPAL MgD I/113, a specimen with skin impressions referred to the dubious T. cf. gigantea The following cladogram is based on a 2015 phylogenetic analysis of the Ankylosaurinae conducted by Arbour and Currie: A limited phylogenetic analysis conducted in the 2016 redescription of Tarchia, focusing on the interrelationships between Tarchia, Saichania, and Minotaurasaurus, is reproduced below. Palaeobiology The rocks in which Tarchia fossils were found likely represent eolian dunes and interdune environments, with small intermittent lakes and seasonal streams. Hence, we know that Tarchia was a desert animal. On the other hand, well-watered forest would have been present. Tarchia would have been preyed upon by Tarbosaurus. Paleopathology One skull of Tarchia shows tooth marks identified as belonging to the tyrannosaurid, Tarbosaurus, indicating the theropod hunted the ankylosaurid.

Early life The son of Taiwanese immigrants, George Huang grew up with an avid love of motion pictures. After high school, he attempted to move from his love of film into something tangible by enrolling in a producing program at the University of Southern California. After graduating, he began working from the bottom-up as an aspiring executive assistant at Columbia Pictures. Career In 1992, Columbia acquired the distribution rights to the film El Mariachi by Robert Rodr√≠guez. As the film was being prepared for release, Rodriguez struck up a friendship with the young studio assistant with whom he shared a love of film. As Rodriguez, a native and resident of Austin, Texas, had no L.A. residence, he stayed at Huang's apartment. Rodriguez ‚Äì known for his money-saving and high-quality filmmaking techniques ‚Äì was amazed by Huang's blas√© attitude toward the way his superiors spent millions and millions on the production of a single motion picture. Huang, believing his own original stories would never be told, shared some story ideas with Rodriguez, who promptly told his new friend and roommate that he needed to immediately quit his job and make his own films. Huang was understandably reluctant to this idea, but in January 1993, he resigned from his post at Columbia. Huang next began writing, and seeking financing for, a script loosely based on his experiences at Columbia. Released in 1994, Huang's debut film, Swimming with Sharks, is a satire of Hollywood politics from the point of view of a studio underling.The New York Times Since then, Huang has gone on to do a lot of behind-the-scenes work with directorial turns on several short-lived television series, such as Significant Others, Live Through This, and The Invisible Man. He also directed the independent films Trojan War (starring Jennifer Love Hewitt) and How to Make a Monster (which has become a cult favourite, starring Clea DuVall as the only leading role). Huang shot Elijah Wood's audition tape that landed him the role of Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. In 2005, comic book creator Mike Allred announced that Huang was writing the screenplay for the movie Madman, based on Allred's comic of the same name.

Young people were the primary participants in the protests as the bill would have directly affected their future jobs in a way that they considered negative.  The labour bill  To protect the city, public authorities ordered the Place de la Sorbonne closed. This square has been a symbol for French student protests since May 1968. The controversial bill, entitled \\"Loi pour l'√©galit√© des chances\\" (\\"Equal Opportunity Law\\"), created a new job contract, the Contrat premi√®re embauche (CPE ‚Äì First Employment Contract or Beginning Workers Contract). Under this job contract, which aimed to encourage the creation of new jobs, it would have been easier, during a contract's first two years, for workers under twenty-six years old to be fired. It would have allowed employers the opportunity to terminate employment of workers under twenty-six without any reason, within their first two years of employment. Those opposed to the First Employment Contract were worried that it could compromise job security, encourage social pressure with a view to lowering wages, and impede employees in having legal recourse in cases of sexual harassment or other abuse, since this could lead to their subsequently being fired. Proponents of the bill argued that France's tightly regulated employment market discourages French businesses from employing staff, which has led to France suffering high unemployment. High unemployment, especially for young immigrants, was seen as one of the driving forces behind the 2005 civil unrest in France and this unrest mobilized the perceived public urgency for the First Employment Contract. Youths are particularly at risk as they have been locked out of the same career opportunities as older workers, contributing to both a rise in tensions amongst the economically disenfranchised underclass, and, some claim, a brain drain of graduates leaving for better opportunities in Britain and the United States. The French population was roughly split on the issue of whether the First Employment Contract should be implemented. The contract was first proposed after the civil unrest that occurred in France in October and November 2005. French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin's rating dropped to a four-month low of forty-two percent, largely because of the recent protests against the bill. He stated though that he had the backing of French President Jacques Chirac. Later on, polls in L'Express and Paris-Match displayed a swing of the population behind protesters ‚Äì around 70% were against the CPE law when it was promulgated by president Chirac. The bill also included the possibility of manual labour apprenticeships for 14-year-olds, suspension of family welfare in cases of students skipping school (a measure long in the programme of the far-right National Front party), and night labour being permitted for youths as young as 15 years old (as compared to 16 years old before). The protests=February Protests against the bill originally occurred before the bill was approved by Dominique de Villepin. On 7 February, between 200,000 and 400,000 people took part in 187 demonstrations. Some universities, include Rennes, were also occupied during February. A torched car burns in Paris on 18 March Early March Over a million took part in protests on 7 March. On 9 March, around 38 universities were on strike. 16 March Protests across France on 16 March led to widespread disruptions. Approximately one hundred bicyclists barricaded streets around the Louvre in protests unrelated to the labour contract. (The protest around the Louvre concerned the lack of sports teachers in schools.) Another hundred protesters descended on City Hall in Rennes, refusing to leave. Other, mostly peaceful, protests occurred throughout the country, in cities such as Marseille. Many universities, including the University of Toulouse, were forced to close on 16 March as some wanted them to remain open and others wanted them closed during the large protests. 18 March Media attention focused on the violent element of the demonstrations in Paris on 18 March, when as many as 700,000 protesters converged on the city's Place de la Nation. Once the protesters departed from the meeting, a few dozen rioters began to torch cars and vandalize store fronts as police were called in to calm the situation. To suppress the crowd, police officers began to spray tear gas. In the evening, new clashes occurred on the Place de la Sorbonne, between a hundred demonstrators and the police, until 1 am. A protester from that night, Cyril Ferez, a trade unionist from the Sud-PTT union, trampled by riot police, was in a coma for three weeks after skirmishes in the Place de la Nation, Paris. That day saw 156 people being arrested in Paris. Protesters in Marseille were also sprayed with tear gas after some of them climbed Marseille's City Hall and replaced a French flag with a flag that proclaimed \\"anticapitalism.\\" Throughout the rest of the country, less violent protests occurred. In the estimated 160 protests organized around the country, police estimated that half a million students and labourers participated. Organizers estimated the number was closer to 1.5 million. Students (including high school students) demonstrations began to become daily, and often were the site of clashes with the police. 21 March After large demonstrations and subsequent riots on 16 and 18 March, on the 21st the Dijon students' union called for a general strike., as demanded by left-wing papers such as Lib√©ration. A meeting that day of various labour and student groups agreed for another 'day of action' against the law, including strikes, demonstrations and university occupations across the country. 23 March Riots erupted again after a day of relative calm in several cities in France. According to the French national ministry of education, universities had continued their strike and 21 universities out of 84 were entirely blocked by students. In total, 67 universities were either on strike or blockage. 28 March In Cannes, on 31 March, a few hundred youths blocked the important junction \\"Place du 18 juin\\" for 10 to 15 minutes. CPE opponents convened a fourth national 'day of action' against the law on 28 March, including strikes, demonstrations and university occupations across France. Strikes disrupted rail and air transport, public education and mail services while between 1.055 million people (according to police estimates) and 2.71 million (according to union estimates) marched against the law. Much of the discrepancy in crowd estimates is in Paris where the police estimated 92,000 demonstrators while unions estimated 700,000. Whatever the sources, this is double the number that on 16 March demonstration, and more than during the December 1995 protests against the reform of pensions laws. 600 persons were arrested by the police Police repression also took place in minor towns, such as Lons-le-Saunier (Jura) or Lannion (C√¥tes d'Armor). 4 April In total 3.1 million people (according to the CGT) or 1 million (according to the police) people turned out to protest the law throughout the country, while rail and air transport were affected. 11 April The CPE was scrapped by Chirac on 10 April under the pressure of ongoing protest and blockade across France, though some protests continue against the law of which it was part (the loi pour l'√©galit√© des chances [Equal Opportunity Law], or LEC). Protests were smaller in scale as the movement against the CPE split into those that wanted to fight the LEC and those that considered the victory against the CPE to be an acceptable compromise. Because of this split, and because of the universities' Easter holidays, the movement lost its momentum and within a week of the law's withdrawal, the major acts of protest, such as university occupations, had essentially ceased. By 18 April the students at every one of the blocked universities had either voted to reopen immediately, or were on holiday with no blockade planned afterward. University occupations gendarmes mobiles around the Sorbonne. During the dispute, numerous student bodies went on strike, or occupied parts of their faculties. Due to police counter-attacks at the Sorbonne, an initial occupation was repulsed ‚Äì yet the national student federation UNEF claimed that the number of occupations carried on increasing ‚Äì by the end of March, 68 of France's 89 universities were on strike according to UNEF. \\"The strikes that formed the backdrop to the protests disrupted aspects of daily life from transportation to services.\\" (New York Times Database). Many places within those areas were with closed or worked a lot slower than they normally did. Some places that were affected were universities, schools, post offices, etc.  Detentions  According to the Collectif Assistance Juridique (CAJ) independent group, a total of 4,500 people were arrested during the events. Among them, 1,950 were kept in garde √† vue and 635 prosecution cases opened. Less than 15% of the arrested people were therefore presented to the magistrates, due to insufficient evidence of alleged legal violations. The CAJ note that many of the people presented before the courts had no previous criminal record and were far from the profile of \\"criminal rioters\\". They included many leaders of the movement, in particular outside Paris. A 24 March 2006 internal administrative order asked the magistrates not to be too lenient on their judgments. 42% of the persons presented before courts passed in immediate comparution, a specific (and controversial) procedure, which allow them to be judged on the spot.Collectif Assistance Juridique , L'Humanit√©, 28 April 2006 During the 1994 demonstrations against the CIP, a student law prepared by Balladur's government, 1000 persons only had been arrested, although the clashes had been more violent. Although Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy stated on 16 March that his \\"priority was to arrest casseurs\\" (rioters), the independent CAJ (Judicial Assistance Group) noted that the vast majority of arrestations hadn't been of on-the-spot witnessed violence (flagrant d√©lit) and that many were contested. For example, on 31 March a US citizen visiting Paris was detained by the police, while on 7 April an old man getting out of a supermarket was also detained. Furthermore, many young people from the suburbs were blocked from demonstrating in Paris. According to the government, this was to impede turmoils in the capital, but critics such as the CAJ have spoken of a negation of presumption of innocence and of \\"racial and social discrimination\\", since some categories of the population ‚Äì mainly youth living in housing projects, those accused of having taken part in the riots in autumn 2005 ‚Äì were blocked from exercising their civil rights of demonstrating against a law that affected them as well as other categories of the population. These blockings in suburbs' train stations have provoked in some cases clashes with the police, for example in Savigny-sur-Orge, in Saint-Denis or in Les Ulis... \\"There is no evidence which permit us to establish a parallel between the young rioters of November and the disturbing elements of this spring\\", notes the CAJ report, countering the Interior Minister's claims. Furthermore, police abuse was reported on a number of cases, including Cyril Ferez, a trade union member who entered coma state for several weeks following the 18 March demonstration. In Caen Charlotte entered coma for a day; Victor had two ribs broken, etc. A three-year-old child was placed 24 hours in observation after having inhaled gas. On 16 March, the Parisian pr√©fecture de police announced that 18 demonstrators had been injured. The IGS (internal affairs department) was charged of Cyril Ferez' case (who was in coma for several weeks) and litigation was initiated against police officers allegedly excessively brutal and violent during arrests. Additionally, cooperation between the police forces and the trade union \\"service orders\\" (SO, in charge of the demonstrations) was observed, including handing-over of several demonstrators to the police by the trade union's SO. Finally, the CAJ note the disproportion of sentences toward young demonstrators, while others acts of vandalism currently committed by farmers or viticulturists were more lightly punished. It thus alluded to this Alsatian mayor accused of having burned 14 travel trailers but who was condemned only to six months on parole, contrasting with the sentences given to demonstrators (for example, a high school student condemned to 41 days of jail in Fleury-M√©rogis because he had burnt two garbage cans before his school).

His 1512 voyage was the first known European sailing east past Malacca through modern Indonesia and the East Indies. He became a confidante of the Sultan Bayan Sirrullah, the ruler of Ternate, becoming his personal advisor. He remained in Ternate where he died around the same time Magellan died. Voyage to the Indies Serr√£o served as captain of one of three vessels (and second in overall command under Ant√≥nio de AbreuHannard (1991), page 7) sent from Malacca by Afonso de Albuquerque to find the Spice Islands of Banda in Maluku in 1511. Banda was the world's only source of nutmeg and mace, spices used as flavourings, medicines, preserving agents, that were at the time highly valued in European markets. The Portuguese sought to dominate the source, rather than relying on Arab traders who sold it to the Venetians for exorbitant prices. Malay pilots guided the expedition east via Java and along the Lesser Sundas before steering them north to Banda via Ambon. When Serr√£o's ship had berthed at Gresik on Java, he married a Javanese woman as his wife, who then accompanied him on the expedition's further journey. In 1512 his ship was shipwrecked but managed to reach Luco-Pino island (Hitu), north of Ambon. The expedition remained in Banda for about one month, purchasing and filling their ships with nutmeg and mace, as well as cloves in which Banda had a thriving entrep√¥t trade. Serr√£o left Banda in a Chinese junk purchased from a regional trader to replace his lost ship. D'Abreu sailed through Ambon while Serr√£o went ahead towards Maluku islands. With nine Portuguese crew and nine Indonesians, the ship foundered in a squall and broke up on a reef off a small island. When the island's inhabitants, notorious shipwreck scavengers, surveyed the wreck from a boat, Serr√£o's crew posed as unarmed and helpless but wealthy castaways. As the scavengers drew near, the Portuguese attacked and commandeered both their craft and crew. Their inadvertent rescuers were then forced to take them to Ambon, where they disembarked in Hitu. Serr√£o's armour, muskets and marksmanship impressed the powerful chiefs of Hitu who were warring against Luhu, the principal settlement on Seram's Hoamal Peninsula near Hitu.Hannard (1991), page 7; Muller (1997), page 43 The Portuguese were also welcomed in the area as buyers of food and spices during a lull in the spice trade due to a temporary disruption to Javanese and Malay sailings to the area following the 1511 conflicts in Malacca. The visitors were recruited as military allies and their subsequent exploits were heard in the rival neighbours of Ternate and Tidore who both rushed emissaries to induce the visitors to assist. Supporting the territory of the Sultanate of Ternate, the Portuguese strongest power, Serr√£o served as the head of a mercenary band of Portuguese warriors under the service of the island's Sultan Bayan Sirrullah, one of two feuding powerful sultans who controlled the spice trade. They became close friends and the Sultan appointed Serr√£o as his personal adviser for all matters, including military (Portuguese document purport) and family issues. Having been well received by the Sultan, Francisco Serr√£o decided to remain there, not making any efforts to return to Malacca. Final years Francisco Serr√£o's letters to Ferdinand Magellan, carried to Portugal via Portuguese Malacca and describing the 'Spice Islands', helped Magellan persuade the King of Spain to finance his circumnavigation.Hannard (1991), page 8 Before they met each other, Serr√£o mysteriously died in Ternate at almost the same time Magellan was killed in the Philippines (in Mactan Island, Cebu). One theory suggests Serr√£o died of poison administered by the Sultan of Ternate. His family ties with Jo√£o Serr√£o remain unclear in the historiography of Portuguese expeditions to Southeast Asia. The only written document is a list of captains' names in the fleet of Magellan's.

Major cities in the region are Razgrad, Novi Pazar, Pliska and Isperih. Part of the Danubian Plain, the region is hilly in the east, reaching up to in height near the village of Samuil, but merges with the plains of Dobruja and the Danube to the north, with the lowest point near Yuper (). The region is bordered to the west by the Provadiya River and the Beli Lom; to the east it transitions into the Dobruja plateau. The plateau was formed of Karst limestone from the Lower Cretaceous covered by loess material. Among the region's geological resources are kaolinite, fireclay and mica. The climate is temperate continental, with up to of precipitation yearly. Although the Ludogorie is poor in overground water resources, with only a few low rivers such as the Krapinets and the Kulak, it is rich in underground waters. In ancient times, the Ludogorie was inhabited by the Thracian tribes of the Getae who left behind local architectural landmarks such as the Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari, a richly-decorated 3rd-century BC tomb that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Until the end of the 18th century, the Ludogorie was largely dominated by forests that merged with the ones of the Balkan Mountains (Stara Planina) to the south, giving the name of the region both in Bulgarian and Turkish, literally translated as \\"region of wild forests\\" in English. In recent times, the forests have been nearly completely replaced by arable land and only the woods in the Voden Reserve are the reminiscent of the former larger forest area. The soil from the chopped down forests is a rich soil with humus, very eligible for agriculture. Ludogorie is a relatively new name, a Slavic calque of the older Turkish name Deliorman; it was officially introduced in 1950. In 1942, the name had been changed to Polesie, a Slavic toponym meaning \\"place by the woods\\", but this name never entered common use. The Turkish name is etymologically and semantically akin to the name of Teleorman County in southern Romania. The Ludogorie mostly belongs to Razgrad Province, with a western part in Ruse Province, and has a mixed population of Bulgarians, Turks and Romani. The Ludogorie has attained fame for its oil wrestlers throughout the time, including Koca Yusuf and Hergeleci Ibrahim.

It is the fifth track on their 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind. Writing and recording For three weeks in late 1998, U2 worked at Hanover Quay Studios with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois in hopes of quickly developing new material for a studio album. With Eno on keyboards and Lanois on rhythm guitar and percussion, the six of them composed songs during jam sessions. Guitarist the Edge said that these group sessions did not produce many great ideas, resulting in him bringing in his own individual musical ideas for them to work on. One of these was a loop of a string section that inspired \\"Kite\\". After hearing the loop, the others quickly improvised the entirety of the song. During this process, lead singer Bono said his \\"voice returned\\" after several years of him suffering vocal difficulties. After hitting a high note when singing the line \\"I'm a man, I'm not a child\\", the others in the studio were taken aback. Bassist Adam Clayton called it a \\"memorable moment\\", saying, \\"I don't think we had heard that voice for a long time.\\"McCormick (2006), pp. 289, 296, 299 With the song near completion, the band was not entirely satisfied and decided it \\"needed a twist\\". As a result, they edited in an additional section of the song and the Edge played a guitar solo on his 1964 Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he plugged into an Ampeg Scrambler distortion pedal and a Vox AC30 amplifier. According to him, the addition of the solo \\"really made that part of the song come alive\\". The lyrics were inspired by a kite-flying outing on Killiney Hill overlooking Dublin Bay that Bono attempted with his daughters Jordan and Eve.\\"U2's Bono loses dad to cancer\\", Associated Press, August 23, 2001. The outing went quickly awry when the kite crashed and Eve asked if they could go home and play with their Tamagotchis. The Edge assisted Bono in writing the lyrics and felt they were actually about Bono's emotionally- reserved father, Bob Hewson, who was dying of cancer at the time. The Edge said, \\"[Bono] couldn't see it, but I could.\\" Bono recalled a similarly ill- fated kite-flying outing in his own childhood with his father in the County Dublin seaside towns of Skerries or Rush. Composition and theme The song was at first written with Bono's daughters in mind, or more generally, about a kite as a metaphor for someone or something escaping one's realm of control; the song is, more or less, about Bono realizing a day will come when his daughters will \\"no longer need him\\". During early promotional appearances Bono emphasized the song could be about letting go of any kind of relationship.U2 promotional concert at Irving Plaza, New York, December 5, 2000. The music to \\"Kite\\" was equally evocative. The song begins with a string loop that the Edge had arranged. The verses feature the Edge playing a simple repeating slide guitar piece, while the chorus featuring an emphatic wail from Bono set against the Edge's churning guitar lines. The song concludes with an odd coda in reference to the new media. In concert the coda is sometimes repeated, with almost all instrumentation dropped out; Bono later said the coda was intended to pinpoint the narrative by \\"just setting it in time, saying that's the moment, and then leaving it behind you.\\" As is often the case with U2 songs, listeners heard various things from \\"Kite\\". Rolling Stone magazine saw it describing \\"the plight of a fraying couple; when Bono glimpses 'the shadow behind your eyes,' his lyric evokes the music's slanted conversations of melody and rhythm and guitar figures.\\"James Hunter, All That You Can't Leave Behind album review, Rolling Stone, October 26, 2000. The New York Times entitled their review of an Elevation Tour concert \\"Like a Kite, Grounded But Soaring to the Skies\\", and said the song was \\"music made after the fall,\\" merging idealism with experience.Ann Powers, ROCK REVIEW: Like a Kite, Grounded But Soaring To the Skies, The New York Times, June 19, 2001. A United Methodist Pastor in McGregor, Texas took the song's lines \\"I'm not afraid to die / I'm not afraid to live\\" and related it to his belief that Christians should not think of God as a stern judge and should not be afraid to live to the fullest,Steve Hayduck, \\" Afraid to Die? Afraid to Live?\\", July 7, 2005. while a London memorial service honoring The Door magazine founder and religious figure Mike Yaconelli used it as the spiritual pivot of the service.John Davies, \\"A day for Mike\\", November 23, 2003. Author Vi≈°nja Cogan partially echoed Edge's interpretation, seeing the duality of Bono's role as both father and son embodied in the song's interior climax \\"I'm a man, I'm not a child....\\" Live performances During the band's Elevation Tour, \\"Kite\\" was played to a set of swirling images projected against a scrim above the stage, furthering the song's central theme. \\"Kite\\" took on an additional meaning later in 2001 on the tour, when Bono's father, Bob Hewson, died after a long bout with cancer.Dominic Mohan, \\"Bono's agony after dad dies\\", August 22, 2001. Bono would alter the line \\"The last of the rock stars\\" to \\"The last of the opera stars\\", a reference to Bob's past as an amateur opera singer. Bono paid tribute to him with a tearful rendition of this song on the live release, U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle, which depicts the band's memorable performance at Slane Castle, one day after Bob Hewson's funeral. Prior to the song, Bono fondly recalls his father and the Edge's father, Garvin Evans, walking down Madison Avenue late-night in New York City drunk together and singing \\"the duet from The Silver Fish\\". \\"Kite\\" was played for the first time on the Vertigo Tour on 7 November 2006 in Brisbane, Australia, when the tour resumed after a long hiatus. It was also the first time that \\"Kite\\" has closed a concert, and was the regular closer on the Australian leg of the tour, while it also closed the first show in Auckland, New Zealand. A live version of the song from the Vertigo Tour, recorded in Sydney's Telstra Stadium on 11 November 2006, was released as a B-side to \\"Window in the Skies\\" on 1 January 2007. The live Australian version featured the use of didgeridoo (especially audible toward the end).

She operated on the Mississippi River and Yazoo River during 1862 and 1863. Construction and acquisition Monarch was built as a sidewheel towboat at Fulton, Ohio, in 1853. She sank in the Ohio River at Louisville, Kentucky, on 5 March 1861, but was refloated and repaired.Gaines, W. Craig, Encyclopedia of Civil War Shipwrecks, Louisiana State University Press, 2008, , p. 100. The United States Army purchased her at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in April 1862 for service in support of Union Army operations and converted her into a ram in 1862 for service in conjunction with the Western Flotilla on the Mississippi River as part of the Army‚Ä≤s United States Ram Fleet under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Ellet, Jr.. She was commissioned at Pittsburgh with Captain R. W. Sanford in command. Service history=Battle of Memphis After fitting out at New Albany, Indiana, Monarch began active duty with the Ram Fleet. Steaming downriver in May 1862, she scouted Fort Pillow, Tennessee, in June 1862 and joined her sister ship, the sidewheel paddle steamer , and the ironclad gunboats , , , , and in the Battle of Memphis on 6 June 1862. Engaging the Confederate River Defense Fleet, the rams destroyed seven of the Confederate ships, wiping out the Defense Fleet as an effective naval force. During the battle, Monarch rammed the cottonclad rams CSS Colonel Lovell and General Beauregard. The Union forces took Memphis, Tennessee, on 6 June 1862, clearing the upper Mississippi River of Confederate forts and naval craft. On 26 June 1862, Monarch and the ram pursued General Earl Van Dorn down the Mississippi and up the Yazoo River, the Confederates burning General Earl Van Dorn below Yazoo City, Mississippi, to prevent her capture. Battle of Vicksburg Beginning in June 1862, Monarch operated against Vicksburg, Mississippi. Monarch and five other ships departed Helena, Arkansas, on 16 August 1862 on a U.S. Army-U.S. Navy expedition in Mississippi up the Yazoo River with troops landing at various points along the shore and destroying Confederate artillery batteries on the river. Union ships captured the sidewheel paddle steamer CSS Fairplay above Vicksburg on 27 August 1862; Monarch then cruised the Yazoo with the sidewheel paddle steamer to prevent Confederate use of the steamer Paul Jones and to hinder communications with Vicksburg. Later that year, Monarch swept naval mines in the Yazoo. Battle of Arkansas Post Monarch joined 11 other ships in the expedition to capture Fort Hindman, Arkansas, 4 January 1863, a point that Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter noted as \\"a tough nut to crack.\\" Joining efforts with Major General William Tecumseh Sherman's troops on 9 January 1863, the Union ships fought in the Battle of Arkansas Post and shared in the capture of Fort Hindman on 11 January. Later service In February 1863, Monarch steamed up the Yazoo to Greenville, Mississippi, to relieve Commander Prichett, controlling guerilla activity. In April 1863, she joined the rams , , and in supporting Colonel Ellet's marine brigade in the Tennessee Valley. With the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863 and the collapse of Confederate naval forces on the western rivers, Monarch‚Ä≤s mission was accomplished. She was laid up on the Mississippi River below St. Louis, Missouri, after July 1863 and was dropped from the naval list in 1864, but remained in reserve, ready for recall to active service. She was sunk by ice in December 1864, but was refloated and taken to Mound City, Illinois, for dismantling in July 1865.

The production was led by James Paul Wisner, Mike Green, Nick Trevisick, and Roger Alan Nichols. All songs were written by vocalist Hayley Williams and guitarist Josh Farro. The departure of bassist Jeremy Davis, which occurred a few days after arriving in Orlando, served as the album's main theme. This theme was reflected especially in the album's cover and title. Mostly categorized as a pop punk album, the album received mostly positive reviews and has been labeled a \\"scene classic\\". The album's production took place in Orlando, Florida. Instead of making a major push towards radio, the band's A&R; recommended that the band build a fanbase through word of mouth. Initially, the album received positive reviews by music critics, praising the vocals of Hayley Williams. The album had a weak domestic commercial performance: it failed to enter the Billboard 200, though it did reach number 30 on Billboards Heatseekers Chart. It reached No. 4 on the UK Rock Chart, and in 2010 it managed to reach No. 51 on the UK Albums Chart and earned a gold certification by the BPI. In July 2014, after the group found success with its following records, All We Know Is Falling received gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Three singles from the album were released: \\"Pressure\\", \\"Emergency\\" and \\"All We Know\\". None of the singles managed to reach any major chart, although \\"Pressure\\" was certified gold by the RIAA in 2016 after the band found commercial success with subsequent releases. Background Hayley Williams was originally signed to Atlantic Records in 2003 as a solo pop singer. However, Williams resisted the label's solo-career wishes, saying she did not envision herself as \\"the next Madonna\\". As a result, she formed Paramore with Josh Farro, Zac Farro, and Jeremy Davis. In her short solo career, Williams recorded some demos, which were later re-recorded with the band for a \\"more authentic\\" sound. However, the band was almost fired because the label thought they \\"were terrible.\\" Williams and Farro wrote two new songs, \\"Here We Go Again\\" and \\"Hallelujah\\", which saved the group from being fired. The former song became the fifth track on All We Know Is Falling, while \\"Hallelujah\\" was saved for their sophomore album Riot! (2007). Production The departure of bassist Jeremy Davis served as one of the themes for the album. The group traveled to Orlando, Florida to write and record the remainder of the album. A few days after arriving in Orlando, Davis left the band. The remaining members continued work on the album. The band decided to base the album's theme and around Davis' departure. According to Williams, the album's cover art also represented Davis' departure: \\"The couch with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space.\\" The album's artwork was created by Electric Heat. The album's recording process took about three weeks, with Josh Farro calling the sessions \\"rushed\\". \\"All We Know\\", \\"Never Let This Go\\" and \\"My Heart\\" were recorded with producer James Paul Wisner at Wisner Productions, located in St. Cloud, Florida. \\"Pressure\\", \\"Emergency\\", \\"Brighter\\", \\"Whoa\\", \\"Conspiracy\\" and \\"Franklin\\" were recorded with producer Mike Green at ARS Studios, located in Orlando, Florida. \\"Here We Go Again\\" was recorded with producers Roger Alan Nichols and Nick Trevisick at Bigger Dog Studio, located in Franklin, Tennessee. Additional recording took place at Stone Gables Studio, located in Brentwood, Tennessee and at The Skyview Church of Tone and Soul, located in East Nashville, Tennessee. All of the songs were mixed by Green, except for \\"Here We Go Again\\", which was mixed by Nichols and Trevisick. Tom Baker mastered the recordings at Precision Mastering in Hollywood, California. Nath Warshowsky acted as the studio drum tech for every song, except for \\"Here We Go Again\\". Dave Buchman engineered \\"Here We Go Again\\". Lucio Rubino, formerly of StorySide:B, replaced the absent Davis in the studio. He performed bass on every song except for \\"Here We Go Again\\", which was done by Jeremy Cadwell. Typically, Farro would write the music while Williams wrote the lyrics. On occasion, Farro would contribute lyrics as well. \\"Conspiracy\\" was composed by Williams, Farro, and Taylor York. It was the first song they wrote together. Many of the lyrics in All We Know Is Falling which are not related to Davis' departure deal with the bad relationship and divorce of Williams' parents. The band's influences varied in sound during the album's recording. Williams claimed influence from metal bands Underoath and Failure, and from pop rock band The Academy Is... Davis said the band were heavily influenced by Slipknot.  Composition  Critics have variously called All We Know Is Falling a pop punk, emo, or pop rock album. Trevor Kelley at Alternative Press categorized the music on the album as \\"vaguely emo, but mostly mall-punk\\". Tom Whitson of Click Music defined the music on the album as emo with \\"pop-punk beats\\", drawing comparisons from Avril Lavigne and Fall Out Boy. The Allmusic review by Neil Z. Yeung referred to the album as a \\"formulaic\\" pop punk album, complete with \\"head-bobbing drums, straightforward riffs, and a midtempo sameness throughout\\". In a retrospective Alternative Press review by Tyler Sharp, the album was referred to as what would have been \\"just another pop- rock effort that ultimately fell short in the face of its true potential\\" if not for the band's later success. Gigwise reviewer David Renshaw also drew comparisons to Lavigne, but believed that the songs on the album were inferior to those of Lavigne's. Release and promotion Hayley Williams performing on July 4, 2006 in Phoenix, Arizona as part of the 2006 edition of Warped Tour. Paramore released All We Know Is Falling on July 26, 2005 in the United States. According to Paramore's A&R; at Atlantic Records, Steve Robertson, the promotion strategy behind the album was that the band would start small and slowly build through word of mouth instead of giving the debut album a major radio promotional push. In his own words, Robertson \\"wanted kids to discover the band without it being shoved down their throats.\\"Blumentrath, Jan (November 9, 2009).\\"Interview With Paramore A&R; Steve Robertson\\" HitQuarters. Retrieved December 30, 2016. In September 2005, a special Japanese edition containing a previously unreleased song \\"Oh Star\\" was made available. In January 2009, the album was released on vinyl for the first time. On May 19, 2009, a deluxe edition of the album was released exclusively on iTunes with live versions of \\"Pressure\\" and \\"Here We Go Again\\", and the music videos for all the singles. A 10th anniversary edition of the album was released on December 4, 2015 on vinyl, which contains \\"O Star\\" and \\"This Circle\\" as bonus tracks; this version was limited to 4,000 copies. The album featured three singles: \\"Pressure\\", \\"Emergency\\" and \\"All We Know\\". Two weeks before starting a tour to promote the album, John Hembree joined the band to replace bassist Jeremy Davis, though Davis ended up rejoining the group after five months away from the band. In October and November, the group supported Simple Plan on their headlining tour in the United States, followed by a supporting slot for Funeral for a Friend in December. In February 2006, the group went on Midwest and east coast tour with Halifax, My American Heart, and So They Say. Through the spring of 2006, Paramore was an opening act on tours for both BaysideSpin Staff (March 1, 2006). \\"Spotlight - Bayside\\" Spin. Retrieved August 5, 2016. and The Rocket Summer. The band was initially planned to appear on the 2006 edition of the Take Action Tour in early March 2006, but Williams came down with flu, which resulted in the band being replaced by Sullivan. The band went on the 2006 edition of the Warped Tour, which took place in Nashville, near the group's hometown. In August and September, the band headlined a tour in the US with support from Hit the Lights, Cute Is What We Aim For and This Providence, followed by some dates in the United Kingdom in October. Reception=Critical reception All We Know Is Falling was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Kelley stated \\"it's obvious that someone has done Williams wrong\\" from the lyrics in the album's the songs, and noted its similarity to Lavigne's previous studio album Under My Skin (2004). Tony Pascarella of The Trades said that \\"these passionate, rocking tracks are what make this Tennessee group so talented [...] Paramore is a band you may not yet have heard of, but look for them to make a major splash in the very near future.\\" He also praised Williams' voice as \\"a rich, powerful voice that rarely makes a mistake on this stunning debut.\\" In a tenth-anniversary review from Alternative Press, Tyler Sharp wrote that the album evolved into \\"a scene classic\\" after the band's gradual rise to mainstream popularity in later years. The album is often held in a negative light in comparison to the band's subsequent studio albums, and retrospective reviews have been mixed. In a retrospective review, Yeung showed mixed feelings about the album. He regarded the album as \\"alright\\", however, he believed that the songs were too straightforward and lacked \\"differentiation, excitement, or the brightness that would be found on later albums.\\" Whitson said that the album was \\"this group of youngsters have written a great debut album for their age [...] [All We Know Is Falling] isn't the best album around, but is far from the worst.\\" Renshaw was critical about the fact that \\"Paramore are for the kids who think Pink is not cool enough but My Chemical Romance are too scary, they want to rebel but they have to be in by 9 o' clock. Paramore are not terrible; they are simply a transitional band.\\" Jordan \\"Anchors\\" Rogowski from Punknews.org was more critical of the album; he praised Williams' voice, but criticized the structures of the songs, regarding them \\"just too flat, too linear [...] the guitar seems a bit uninspired, the drumming a bit lazy, and the bass is barely existent, if existent at all.\\" Commercial performance Initially, All We Know Is Falling only charted on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, peaking at number 30 in September 2006. After the success of their second studio album Riot! (2007), the album sales gradually built. Although it never charted on the Billboard 200, it did manage to take number eight on the Billboard Catalog Albums chart in 2009. All We Know Is Falling only reached number 51 on the UK Albums Chart, but still received gold certification in 2009 by the British Phonographic Industry for shipping over 100,000 copies. It was then certified in Australia in 2012, where it went gold for shipments of over 35,000 units despite never reaching an Australian chart. In 2014, the album was certified gold in the United States for shipments of over 500,000 copies. Initially, none of the singles managed to chart, but after the success of Riot!, \\"Pressure\\" was able to peak at number 62 on the Billboard Digital Songs chart. In 2016, the recording was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Track listing Credits adapted from the album's liner notes unless noted.

It has been frequently represented in film and on television, in literature, on the Internet and in all kinds of games. General impact Tyrannosaurus rex is unique among dinosaurs in its place in modern culture; paleontologist Robert Bakker has called it \\"the most popular dinosaur among people of all ages, all cultures, and all nationalities\\". From the beginning, it was embraced by the public. Henry Fairfield Osborn, the President of the American Museum of Natural History, billed it the greatest hunter to have ever walked the earth. He stated in 1905,John \\"Jack\\" Horner and Don \\"Dino\\" Lessem, The Complete T. Rex (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1993), pages 58‚Äì62 Tyrannosaurus gained widespread public attention on December 30, 1905, when the New York Times hailed T. rex as \\"the most formidable fighting animal of which there is any record whatever,\\" the \\"king of all kings in the domain of animal life,\\" \\"the absolute warlord of the earth,\\" and a \\"royal man-eater of the jungle.\\"\\"Mining for Mammoths in the Badlands: How Tyrannosaurus Rex Was Dug Out of His 8,000,000 Year old Tomb,\\" The New York Times, December 3, 1905, page SM1. In 1906, Tyrannosaurus was dubbed the \\"prize fighter of antiquity\\" and the \\"Last of the Great Reptiles and the King of Them All.\\"\\"The Prize Fighter of Antiquity Discovered and Restored,\\" The New York Times December 30, 1906, page 21. In 1927, Charles R. Knight painted a mural incorporating Tyrannosaurus facing a Triceratops in the Field Museum of Natural History,\\"Charles Knight: Prehistoric Visions of a Beloved Muralist\\" 2002 Field Museum, In the Field article by Alexander Sherman establishing the two dinosaurs as enemies in popular thought; paleontologist Phil Currie cites this mural as one of his inspirations to study dinosaurs. Bakker said of the imagined rivalry between Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops, \\"No matchup between predator and prey has ever been more dramatic. It's somehow fitting that those two massive antagonists lived out their co-evolutionary belligerence through the very last days of the very last epoch of the Age of Dinosaurs.\\"Bakker, R.T. 1986. The Dinosaur Heresies. New York: Kensington Publishing, p. 240. On that page, Bakker has his own T. rex/Triceratops fight. Film appearances The Lost World, featuring Agathaumas, Tyrannosaurus and Pteranodon Promotional photo of a Tyrannosaurus battling King Kong (1933) Tyrannosaurus rex has played a major role in many films, starting in 1918 with The Ghost of Slumber Mountain, written and directed by stop motion special effects pioneer Willis O'Brien. The Ghost of Slumber Mountain is also, and most likely, the first film showing Tyrannosaurus facing Triceratops. The king of the tyrant lizards came back in 1925 with the classic adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The Lost World. Tyrannosaurus fossils were not so famous at the time of the publication of the novel (1912), and the only main villain dinosaur in the book was Allosaurus, with no appearance of Tyrannosaurus, but this 1925 film featured Tyrannosaurus anyway, for a more dramatic and spectacular effect.T. rex did not actually feature in the book, but O'Brien made sure there was a role for him in the film, T. rex: A Dinosaur in Hollywood (2005 documentary) Stop motion animator Willis O'Brien, who had worked on The Ghost of Slumber Mountain and The Lost World, was again responsible of special effects in the 1933 monster movie King Kong, which featured a climactic battle between the giant ape and a Tyrannosaurus. The Tyrannosaurus model was made using a cast based on an early painting by Charles R. Knight. O'Brien stated that the battle between Kong and the Tyrannosaurus was one of the most technically difficult scenes in the film to animate. Many early films depicted Tyrannosaurus with an upright posture based on the current thinking of the time. Most of these films inaccurately portrayed the dinosaur with three prominent fingers on each hand like Allosaurus (though Tyrannosaurus had a third, vestigial finger, it would not have been noticeable at first glance);\\"T. rex Missing 3rd Finger Found ,\\" Discovery News October 17, 2007. Walt Disney is reported to have informed dinosaur hunter Barnum Brown that \\"it looked better that way\\", and the creature was depicted as such as in the Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring segment in the Walt Disney 1940 animated film Fantasia. Since that time, T. rex has appeared in a great number of \\"monster\\" films and educational documentaries. One of the first appearances which portrayed a proper posture and anatomy of Tyrannosaurus is the 1984 short Prehistoric Beast, fully conceived and made by Phil Tippett by means of his so-called go motion technique. One of the most iconic depictions of Tyrannosaurus in film was in 1993's Jurassic Park, where dinosaurs, including T. rex, are brought back to life using blood from fossilized mosquitoes. In the film, the dinosaur breaks free of its theme park enclosure, and proceeds to roam the park after attacking the visitors and killing one (a lawyer). In the film's finale, the Tyrannosaurus indirectly saves the main characters by killing the Velociraptors, who had been hunting them through the visitor center. The popularity of T. rex has long had a reciprocal effect on dinosaur science; the popularity of Jurassic Park factored into the discovery of the dinosaur genus Scipionyx; fossils of this genus had lain in storage in a basement in Italy until the film's release attracted attention from the fossil owner. Two Tyrannosaurus appeared again as primary antagonists in The Lost World, the sequel to Jurassic Park. In Jurassic Park III, it appeared briefly in a confrontation against the main antagonist, Spinosaurus, only to be killed by it. In a twist, the same Tyrannosaurus from the original 1993 film appears as the climactic protagonist in Jurassic World (2015), making an entrance by smashing through a Spinosaurus skeleton. Against the odds, it defeats the \\"Indominus rex\\", with the assistance of a Velociraptor, dubbed \\"Blue,\\" and a Mosasaurus. This specific Tyrannosaurus reappears in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Tyrannosaurus is one of the three dinosaur types whose physical characteristics were combined by the designers at Toho, to create the Japanese monster Godzilla; the other two dinosaurs were Stegosaurus and Iguanodon. Among other appearances, Tyrannosaurus has made major appearances in many other films, including Dinosaurus! (1960), The Last Dinosaur (1977), The Land Before Time and its direct-to-video sequels (1988-present), We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993), Toy Story (1995), Night at the Museum (2006), Meet the Robinsons (2007), Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009), and The Good Dinosaur (2015). The IMAX 3D film T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous (1998) featured a Tyrannosaurus in various time travel sequences, as well as its discoverer, Barnum Brown. Some Japanese animated films have a Tyrannosaurus as a main protagonist (You Are Umasou, 2010), as the main villain (Daikyouryu no Jidai, The Age of the Great Dinosaurs, 1979), as a minor antagonist (Magic Tree House, 2011), or as a neutral character (Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur, 1980, as well as its 2006 remake). Television appearances Tyrannosaurus has starred in several television series, including children's programs, both in those intended as fiction, and, more recently, documentaries. In the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers television series from 1993-1995, Jason who was the Red Ranger, powered the Tyrannosaurus Rex Megazord. His red Power Ranger outfit resembled that of a tyrannosaurus rex as well. He also yelled \\"Tyrannosaurus!\\" when he morphed which was fairly common throughout the television series. In Barney & Friends, Barney is a stylized Tyrannosaurus rex. In the Australian children's show The Wiggles, the character \\"Dorothy the Dinosaur\\" is a stylized adaptation of a Tyrannosaurus. Some Tyrannosaurus characters appear in Dinosaur Train, most prominently Buddy. Tyrannosaurus was one of several dinosaurs featured in the 1974 Doctor Who adventure Invasion of the Dinosaurs, starring Jon Pertwee. A sleeping juvenile is also seen on the Silurian ark in \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\". A time-travelled Tyrannosaurus is seen in London in \\"Deep Breath\\". In 1985 the 1984 Prehistoric Beast short was served to Robert Guenette to direct a full length TV documentary titled Dinosaur!, for which Phil Tippett made new Tyrannosaurus go motion sequences (chasing Hadrosaurus) in addition to those he made for Prehistoric Beast (where Tyrannosaurus was chasing Monoclonius). In the 1985 anime Transformers the popular Autobot, Grimlock, transformed into a mechanical Tyrannosaurus and in later incarnations a \\"Megaraptor\\". In the sequel series, Beast Wars, Megatron, the leader of the Predacons, turned into a techno-organic Tyrannosaurus. In the cartoon The Terrible Thunderlizards, 'Mr. T' plays a Tyrannosaurus rex called Mr. T-rex. General Galapagos, the boss of the Thunderlizards, is also a Tyrannosaurus. The T-rex plays recurring supporting roles in Dinosaurs (Roy Hess, Earl Sinclair's friend and the Sinclairs' neighbor), Dinosaucers (Genghis Rex, who is the leader of the Evil Tyrannos), Extreme Dinosaurs (T-Bone, the leader of the heroic group of the same namesake) as well as the anime television series Dinozaurs (as \\"Dino Tyranno\\" and his short-lived evil counterpart \\"Drago Tyran\\"). In Land of the Lost a Tyrannosaurus rex played the villain in both the 1974 series (as \\"Grumpy\\") and the 1991 version (as \\"Scarface\\", who had a scar covering his right eye). In the Ben 10 episode \\"Washington B.C.\\", Dr. Animo brings back a Tyrannosaurus with its skeleton. In Dino-Riders, the main villain Lord Krulos uses a Tyrannosaurus as his mount. In the Japanese TV series Dinosaur War Izenborg, a Tyrannosaurus named Ururu (renamed \\"Tyrannus\\" in the US re-edit Attack of the Super Monsters) served as the main villain for the first half of the series. A Tyrannosaurus named Tyrannor was the main antagonist of Dink the Little Dinosaur. An anthropomorphic Tyrannosaurus named Johnny T. Rex is one of the villains in the Disney Afternoon series Darkwing Duck. Documentaries and quasi- documentaries featuring Tyrannosaurus have included Dinosaur!, Dinosaur Planet, Prehistoric Park, T. Rex: New Science, New Beast, The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs, Walking with Dinosaurs, When Dinosaurs Roamed America, Sea Monsters - A Walking with Dinosaurs Trilogy, Valley of the T-Rex, Dinosaurs Decoded, Bizarre Dinosaurs, Giant Monsters, Animal Armageddon, Jurassic Fight Club, Dinolab, T-rex: Warrior or Wimp?, T. Rex: A Dinosaur in Hollywood, Dinosaur Revolution, The Last Dragon, and Planet Dinosaur, in which it only appears as a skeleton image. Chomper from The Land Before Time series, as well as Red Claw from the TV series, and Sharptooth from the original film are all tyrannosaurs. Tyrannosaurus-themed mecha have appeared in the Super Sentai series since Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger in Shogozyu Tyrannosaurus, V-Rex of Mirai Sentai Timeranger, Bakuryu Tyranno of Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger, Gozyu Rex of Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger, Gabutyra of Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger and recently Tyramigo of Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger. They also appear in their respective Power Rangers adaptations in Season One of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, Power Rangers Time Force, Power Rangers Dino Thunder, Power Rangers Super Megaforce, Power Rangers Dino Charge and Power Rangers Dino Fury. A CGI animated Tyrannosaurus rex named Tina Rex is a bully in Gumball's school in the 2011‚Äìpresent animated series on Cartoon Network, The Amazing World of Gumball. Literature In literature, a dominant representation of Tyrannosaurus since 1990 has been that of Michael Crichton's, as seen in the novel Jurassic Park and its sequel The Lost World (homage title to the 1912 novel by Arthur Conan Doyle, about scientists discovering a South American plateau where dinosaurs still exist). Its skeleton was also used to illustrate the covers of these books. A Tyrannosaurus rex was the protagonist of the children's book We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (later adapted into a feature- length film of the same name). Tyrannosaurus has also been featured in the novel Primeval: Extinction Event, by Dan Abnett. Other appearances A depiction of a Tyrannosaurus on a German postage stamp. Tyrannosaurus has appeared in many media and is perhaps one of the most widely used dinosaurs. Various incarnations of, and creatures based on T. rex have appeared in video games, and several game series have featured Tyrannosaurus a centerpiece. These include 3D Monster Maze, the Dino Crisis/Dino Stalker line, various Jurassic Park tie-in games, the Turok game series, Tomb Raider, the Zoo Tycoon series, the survival game Ark: Survival Evolved, the simulation games Saurian and The Isle, and Super Mario Odyssey.Full size animatronic Tyrannosaurus being assembled in Combe Martin Wildlife and Dinosaur Park, North Devon, United Kingdom. Numerous models and children's toys depicting Tyrannosaurus have been produced, particularly in promotion of the Jurassic Park films. The Carnegie Museum Dinosaur Collection toy line released two versions of the dinosaur, with the second brought in line with more modern scientific understanding. Sinclair Oil ads from the 1950s frequently featured T. rex, and products from radio-controlled helicopter models to a rifle cartridge (the .577 T-Rex) have been named after the dinosaur. In music, the popular 1970s glam rock band T. Rex took their name from the famous dinosaur. In the Calvin and Hobbes comics, fantasy sequences often featured Tyrannosaurus rex. In one story arc, in which Calvin writes a school paper on the T. rex predator/scavenger debate, he argues that T. rex was a predator because \\"They're so much cooler that way.\\" T. rex is also featured as the protagonist in the long-running webcomic Dinosaur Comics by Ryan North. Various T. rex have featured in stories published in the British comic 2000AD. Ursula Dubosarsky's picture book, simply called Rex and illustrated by David Mackintosh, concerns a pet lizard who assumes the proportions of a T. rex in the imagination of a series of children.http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/757858.Rex Retrieved 11 July 2012 In Pok√©mon X and Y, there is an evolution family consisting of Tyrunt and Tyrantrum both of which are based on Tyrannosaurus.

The body is that of a man dating from the late 3rd century BC, during the early Germanic Iron Age. Based on the evidence of his wounds, he was most likely killed by having his throat slit. His corpse was then deposited in the bog, where his body was naturally preserved for over two millennia. He was not the only bog body to be found in the peat bogs of Jutland: with other notable examples Tollund Man and the Elling Woman, Grauballe Man represents an established tradition at the time; it is commonly thought that these killings, including that of Grauballe Man, were examples of human sacrifice, possibly an important rite in Iron Age Germanic paganism. Grauballe Man has been described as \\"one of the most spectacular discoveries from Denmark's prehistory\\"Foreword to because it is one of the most exceptionally preserved bog bodies in the world. Upon excavation in 1952, it was moved to the Prehistoric Museum in Aarhus, where it underwent research and conservation. In 1955 the body went on display at the Moesgaard Museum near Aarhus, where it can still be seen today. Due to the preservation of the man's feet and hands, his fingerprints were successfully taken. Evidence Grauballe Man was initially dated to the late 3rd century BC by analysing the stratigraphic layer of peat that his body was found in. This date was subsequently confirmed by radiocarbon dating his liver, the results of which were published in 1955. Life The body of the Grauballe Man upon his discovery. Information about the Grauballe Man's life have been ascertained from his remains. His hands were smooth and did not show evidence of hard work, indicating that Grauballe Man was not employed in hard labour such as farming. Study of his teeth and jaws indicated that he had suffered from \\"periods of starvation or a poor state of health during his early childhood.\\" The man's skeleton showed signs of significant calcium deficiency, and his spine also suffered the early stages of spondylosis deformans, a generalized disease of aging that is secondary to the degeneration of intervertebral disks. Due to the shrinkage that the corpse suffered in the bog, the man's actual height is not known. It is known that he had dark hair, although this too was altered in the bog, and now appears reddish in colour. Death The corpse was not found with any artifacts or any evidence of clothing, indicating that when he died he was entirely naked, or his clothing had deteriorated, something that had also happened with the Tollund Man. The actual manner of his death was by having his throat cut ear to ear, severing his trachea and oesophagus. Such a wound could not have been self-inflicted, indicating that this was not suicide. A damaged area to the skull that was initially thought to have been inflicted by a blow to the head, has since been determined by a CT scan to have been fractured by pressure from the bog long after his death.Karen E. Lange, \\"Tales from the Bog\\", National Geographic, September 2007, retrieved 23-04-2009 He was around 30 years old when he died. Discovery, preservation and exhibition The well preserved hand of Grauballe Man Facial reconstruction of the Grauballe Man's face The Grauballe Man's body was first discovered buried in the bog on 26 April 1952 by a team of peat diggers. One of the workmen, Tage Busk S√∏rensen, stuck his spade into something that he knew was not peat; upon revealing more they discovered the head protruding from the ground, and the local postman, who was passing, alerted the local doctor as well as an amateur archaeologist named Ulrik Balslev. With the body still in the peat, various locals came to visit it over the next day, one of whom accidentally stepped on its head. The following morning, Professor Peter Glob from the Prehistory Museum at Aarhus came to visit the body, and arranged for it to be moved to the museum, still encased in a block of surrounding peat. Glob and his team decided that they should not only research the body but that they should also attempt to preserve it so that it could be exhibited to the public. This concept was new at the time as most of the bog bodies previously discovered had been re-buried, sometimes in consecrated ground, with the Tollund Man which had been discovered two years earlier having only its head preserved. Despite the warnings of some scientists who believed that the corpse should immediately undergo preservation, it was exhibited straight away in order to capitalise on public interest. Indeed, the scientists' fears were proved right, as mould started to appear on certain areas of the body as a result of it having to be kept permanently moist. The body then underwent research, including a post-mortem, and then preservation, which was organised by conservator C. Lange-Kornbak, who had to decide on the best way to do this, as no entire bog body had ever been preserved before. He examined various methods for doing so, before deciding on a programme of tanning the body to turn it into leather and then stuffing it with oak bark.Strehle, Helle (2007). Grauballe Man: An Iron Age Bog Body Rediscovered. Jutland Archaeological Society. Page 36-43. In 1955, the body went on display at the Moesgaard Museum near Aarhus, only to be removed for a time in 2001-2002 when it underwent more modern scientific study, including radiological study, CT scanning, 3D visualisation, stereolithography and analyses of the gut contents.

After winning, the player can continue to explore the setting. Reception Trent Ward of GameSpot reviewed the game as having low-quality visuals and audio but being possibly useful for passing time. Billboard magazine mentioned the game's randomly generated environment and its target audience of \\"gamers on the go\\", and deemed it \\"An unambitious title that will rope you in.\\" A Next Generation reviewer noted that the randomly generated scenarios are essentially repetitive, and complained at the fact that the player character cannot shoot diagonally but enemies can. He concluded, \\"All this said, however, the game only costs around 12 bucks and if you don't expect too much, it is pretty fun. The underlying idea is sound, and if you don't mind repetition, check it out.\\" Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World wrote, \\"For a genius, George Lucas sure has a lot of bad ideas. [...] Some time ago, someone from his computer game division must have come to him and said, 'Hey, let's put out a really simple, randomly generated RPG-style adventure game, stick a whip in the hand of the main character, use the Indiana Jones nameand make it look really ugly.' And Lucas must have said, 'Sounds good to me.'\\" Ardai wrote that Indiana Jones fans may enjoy the theme music featured in the game, but concluded that the game was, \\"Embarrassingly retro,\\" with its \\"overly simplistic gameplay; crude visuals and sound\\" and \\"ludicrous ethnic stereotypes.\\" Rob Tribe of PC Zone called it \\"very, very addictive,\\" though like Next Generation, he criticized the fact that the player character cannot shoot diagonally but enemies can. In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared Indy's Desktop Adventures the 15th-worst computer game ever released.

It was named after Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca, and was recorded simultaneously with Blue Afternoon, though notably different in style. It was one of Buckley's two avant-garde albums, and explored some sounds and ideas he had not previously used. Also importantly, it was an attempt to break away from more traditional and prevalent pop music songwriting styles, such as the verse/chorus binary form, that Buckley had explored in the earlier parts of his career.Tim Buckley Interview at timbuckley.com Production Lorca is a move away from traditional pop music forms towards a free-form mix of jazz, avant-garde and folk. Musically, Buckley uses the lack of a constant rhythm section to drive the songs forward with his voice. Many songs make use of a chromatic scale which makes them stand in stark contrast to Buckley's earlier melodic works. The lyrics of Lorca also represent a departure from his previous traditional pop-music writing, instead Buckley uses a more abstract descriptive style, avoiding direct narratives and standard song themes. This is a reflection of the poetry, such as the works of poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, that Buckley and guitarist Lee Underwood were reading at the time. The album's opener and title track is a much less guitar-based song, something in contrast to Buckley's previous works, and this would be a theme Buckley would explore further in his later avant-garde works. According to Larry Beckett, his songwriting partner from Tim Buckley and Goodbye and Hello, he was purposely trying to alienate fans at this point. Buckley described it as an album that, \\"To this day, you can't put...on at a party without stopping things; it doesn't fit in.\\" Buckley describes the second track as a \\"real advance,\\" and that \\"It deals with a ballad in a totally personal, physical presentation... It has to be done slowly; it has to take five or six minutes; it has to be a movement. It has to hold you there and make you aware that someone is telling you something about himself in the dark.\\" The album was written during a very prolific time for Buckley as he recorded and released four albums within a space of less than two years. Two of the albums, Blue Afternoon and Lorca were recorded in the space of a single month. Buckley completed these albums around the same time as an obligation to Warner Bros. Records, and also separately, Elektra Records owner Jac Holzman. Holzman, responsible for signing the artist, was in the process of selling the company and Buckley wanted to fulfil his contract in the time before Holzman's departure.

Their role was originally mainly for reconnaissance purposes. They provided humans with the first available method of elevating themselves well over the battlefield to obtain the proverbial \\"birds-eye view.\\" They were an early instrument of definitive intelligence collection, and were also particularly useful in the preparation of accurate battlefield maps, before which time this rudimentary craft had led to many a battlefield failure. Incendiary balloons also have a long history.  Kongming lantern  Kongming lanterns were used as military signalling. The lantern was invented in late Han dynasty, when the Han dynasty chancellor Zhuge Liang (Kongming) was surrounded by Wei dynasty General Sima Yi at Pinlo, Sichuan. Zhuge Liang used paper made \\"lanterns\\", or hot air balloons, to signal the rescue forces. The Kongming lantern become a common military signal in China, and it was inherited by the Mongolian troops, seen in the Battle of Legnica. Flying the Kongming lantern is now a civilian festival of memorizing chancellor Zhuge Liang in the Lantern Festival.  Early Western balloons = Early French balloons  Balloons escaped from the Siege of Paris (1870‚Äì1871) The first successfully flown balloons were made in France by the Montgolfier brothers in 1782‚Äì1783. They were rigid-style spheres made of cotton or silk stretched over a simple light wood frame resembling a large egg. These rigid balloons were held up over a fire so that the smoke billowed well into the cavity of the sphere. It was thought that the smoke made the balloons rise, but actually it was the hot air of the smoke that caused the elevating. The first decisive use of a balloon for aerial observation was performed by the French Aerostatic Corps using the aerostat l‚ÄôEntreprenant (\\"The enterprising one\\") at the Battle of Fleurus in 1794. The following year, during the Siege of Mainz an observation balloon was employed again. However, the French military use of the balloon did not continue uninterrupted, as in 1799 Napoleon disbanded the French balloon corps. In 1854, French aeronaut Eug√®ne Godard performed several manned balloon demonstrations at the wedding of Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I. The Emperor was so impressed that he drafted an agreement with the Godard stating that in the event of a war, he would build balloons, organize balloonists companies, and perform observation ascents for the Austrian military. However, in 1859 the French went to war against the Austrians, and Godard's observation balloons were used instead by French forces, contributing to a victory for Napoleon III over Franz Joseph. Godard's aerial reconnaissance balloons were again employed by the French in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War and the Siege of Paris. During the 1900 Boxer Rebellion in China, the French forces did bring a balloon with them, although there is no record of it ever having been deployed. Austrian use at Venice in 1849 The first aggressive use of balloons in warfare took place in 1849.Air Power in the Age of Total War, John BuckleyThe Future of Drone Use: Opportunities and Threats from Ethical and Legal Perspectives, Asser Press - Springer, chapter by Alan McKenna, page 355 Austrian imperial forces besieging Venice attempted to float some 200 paper hot air balloons each carrying a bomb that was to be dropped from the balloon with a time fuse over the besieged city. The balloons were launched mainly from land; however, some were also launched from the side-wheel steamer SMS Vulcano that acted as a balloon carrier. The Austrians used smaller pilot balloons to determine the correct fuse settings. At least one bomb fell in the city; however, due to the wind changing after launch, most of the balloons missed their target, and some drifted back over Austrian lines and the launching ship Vulcano.Military Aircraft, Origins to 1918: An Illustrated History of Their Impact, Justin D. Murphy, page 9-10Military Ballooning During the Early Civil War, The Johns Hopkins University Press, F. Stansbury Haydon, page 18-20 Mikesh, Robert C. \\"Japan's World War II balloon bomb attacks on North America.\\" (1973).  Balloons in the American Civil War  With the outbreak of the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln did consider the possibility of an air-war mechanism. This had some of the top balloonists in the country vying for position as chief aeronaut of a would-be aeronautics division. The scientific community as well showed great support in influencing Washington to consider the use of balloons. Eventually it was Prof. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe who would be awarded the title Chief Aeronaut of the Union Army Balloon Corps. The first major-scale use of balloons in the military occurred during the Civil War with the Union Army Balloon Corps established and organized by Prof. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe. Originally, the balloons were inflated with coal gas from municipal services and then walked out to the battlefield, an arduous and inefficient operation as the balloons had to be returned to the city every four days for re-inflation. Eventually hydrogen gas generators, a compact system of tanks and copper plumbing, were constructed which converted the combining of iron filings and sulfuric acid to hydrogen. The generators were easily transported with the uninflated balloons to the field on a standard buckboard. However, this method shortened the life of the balloons, because traces of the sulfuric acid often entered the balloons along with the hydrogen.\\"Encyclopedia of War Machines\\" edited by Daniel Bowen. In all, Lowe built seven balloons that were fit for military service. The first application thought useful for balloons was map-making from aerial vantage points, thus Lowe's first assignment was with the Corps of Topographical Engineers. General Irvin McDowell, commander of the Army of the Potomac, realized their value in aerial reconnaissance and had Lowe, who at the time was using his personal balloon the Enterprise, called up to the First Battle of Bull Run. Lowe also worked as a Forward Artillery Observer (FAO) by directing artillery fire via flag signals. This enabled gunners on the ground to fire accurately at targets they could not see, a military first. Lowe's first military balloon, the Eagle was ready by 1 October 1861. It was called into service immediately to be towed to Lewinsville, Virginia, without any gas generator which took longer to build. The trip began after inflation in Washington, D.C. and turned into a 12 mile (19 km), 12-hour excursion that was upended by a gale-force wind which ripped the aerostat from its netting and sent it sailing to the coast. Balloon activities were suspended until all balloons and gas generators were completed. With his ability to inflate balloons from remote stations, Lowe, his new balloon the Washington and two gas generators were loaded onto a converted coal barge the George Washington Parke Custis. As he was towed down the Potomac, Lowe was able to ascend and observe the battlefield as it moved inward on the heavily forested peninsula. This would be the military's first claim of an aircraft carrier. The Union Army Balloon Corps enjoyed more success in the battles of the Peninsula Campaign than the Army of the Potomac it sought to support. The general military attitude toward the use of balloons deteriorated, and by August 1863 the Balloon Corps was disbanded. The Confederate Army also made use of balloons, but they were gravely hampered by supplies due to the embargoes. They were forced to fashion their balloons from colored silk dress-making material, and their use was limited by the infrequent supply of gas in Richmond, Virginia. The first balloon \\"pilot\\" in the Confederate \\"air force\\" was Edward Porter Alexander.Michael R. Bradley, It Happened in the Civil War (2002; rev. 2010) pp. 22. By the summer of 1863, all balloon reconnaissance of the Civil War had ceased. = First balloon assignments = Intrepid being cross-inflated from Constitution in a mad-dash attempt to get the larger balloon in the air to overlook the imminent Battle of Fair Oaks. The first assignment for tethered military balloons was given to the Union Army's Corps of Topographical Engineers for mapmaking, and observation of enemy troops as early as 1850. Up until that point, maps were made from ground level perspectives and their innate inaccuracy led to many a battlefield failure. The aerial perspective ostensibly improved mapmaking, especially when combined with the use of photography. General Irvin McDowell, commander of the Army of the Potomac, called on the balloon to perform aerial observations of enemy encampments and movements in the First Battle of Bull Run. With Lowe's techniques proven to the top commanders, he was eventually tasked to build seven balloons and a series of hydrogen gas generators to inflate them in the battlefield. Even though Thaddeus Lowe was Chief Aeronaut, his bitter rival John La Mountain is credited with having made the first aerial observations of intelligence value while stationed independently at Fortress Monroe. The balloon, under flight direction of Prof. Lowe, was also used to direct artillery fire from an unseen location onto a Confederate encampment. The balloon, Eagle, was ascended with tether and telegraph from Fort Corcoran north of Falls Church, Virginia. (The use of a telegraph to a balloon was previously successfully tested by Lowe on June 18, 1861.) An artillery battery was located at the easterly Camp Advance. With a series of predetermined flag signals, Lowe directed fire onto the Rebel encampment until the shots were landing on target. This first-used concept was the predecessor to the Forward Artillery Observer (FAO) and revolutionized the use of artillery even to modern day. Prof. Lowe was once approached by the young Graf Ferdinand von Zeppelin in 1863, who was at the time acting as a then-civilian observer for the Union Army, about possibly serving as an aerial observer with Lowe, but this was forbidden by Union military authorities during the Civil War years, due to von Zeppelin's then-civilian status. The future rigid airship pioneer was instead directed to the camp of John Steiner, a German aeronaut already in the United States, to get his first flight experience in a balloon, which von Zeppelin was able to do at a slightly later time while he still was in the US. = The first aircraft carrier = Balloons and generators were loaded onto the USS George Washington Parke Custis, a converted coal barge. The balloons were towed down the Potomac River and were able to ascend and make observations of the battle front as it moved toward Richmond. On November 11, 1861, Lowe made the first observations from a balloon based from a ship. This is the first ever recorded observation from an aerial station by water, essentially the first-ever aircraft carrier (balloon tender). Lowe went on to make observations at Fair Oaks, Sharpsburg, Vicksburg and Fredericksburg before political ambush both from within the military and in Congress forced him to resign in April 1863 at which point he returned to the private sector. The Balloon Corps all but ceased to exist by August 1863. = Confederate ballooning = The Confederates tried their hand at ballooning as well, more only to counter the balloons of the Federals. One type of balloon was a Montgolfier style of a rigid, cotton, ‚Äúhot smoke‚Äù balloon. The attempts worked, but their handling techniques were poor at best and the balloon was easily lost and captured by the North. Another style is referred to as the ‚Äúsilk dress balloon,‚Äù aerostat envelopes made of multicolored dress making silk (not actually silk dresses) which, when gas was available, were used effectively over Richmond. Again, these were easily lost, destroyed or captured, and the lack of supply made it impossible to replace them. They were relieved when the Union Army had discontinued the use of balloons. The Confederate Balloon Corps also made use of an aircraft carrier, the CSS Teaser. The Teaser transported and launched one of the Confederate balloons to several observation positions before being captured by the Union Navy in July 1862. = Analysis = The idea of dropping ordnance on the enemy was not seriously considered, although there were mechanical drawings made up depicting bomb dropping devices that could be floated aloft by balloons. These depictions were paper theory at best designed by mechanical wizzes with no idea about aviation, in particular, balloons, and all that it takes to successfully launch gas-filled aerostats. There were no practical types of grenades or bombs to use during the Civil War. Weight was a great factor in determining the size of balloons to be used and the amount of gas they needed to ascend. Carrying heavy ordnance and ungainly mechanisms in balloons would have been out of the question. With the newer, larger and more manageable aerostats, and smaller munitions, the use of bombs would make aerial warfare much more appealing in later days.  Paraguayan War  In 1867 during the Paraguayan War, observation balloons were used by Brazil, assisted by the Allen brothers, James and Ezra, after their aerial intelligence pioneering for the Union army.  British ballooning  Between 1862‚Äì71 efforts by two Royal Engineers officers, were made to catch the attention of senior British officers to the potential use of balloons. In July 1863 experimental balloon ascents for reconnaissance purposes were conducted by the Royal Engineers on behalf of the British Army, but although the experiments were successful it was considered not worth pursuing further because it was too expensive. However, by 1878 a Balloon Equipment Store was established at Woolwich by the Royal Engineers. By this time the limitations imposed by the need to produce hydrogen in the field by some portable apparatus and finding a suitable material for the envelope of a war balloon had been resolved. In 1888 a School of Ballooning was established at Chatham, Medway, Kent. It moved to Stanhope Lines, Aldershot in 1890 when a balloon section and depot were formed as permanent units of the Royal Engineers establishment. Balloons were first deployed by the British Army during the expeditions to Bechuanaland and Suakin in 1885. They were also deployed during the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), where they were used in artillery observation with the Kimberley column and during the Siege of Ladysmith. On October 5, 1907, Colonel John Capper (late Royal Engineers) and team flew the military airship Nulli Secundus from Farnborough around St. Paul's Cathedral in London and back with a view to raising public interest.  World War I  German observation balloon launching at √âquancourt in the Somme (22 September 1916) kite balloon (1918) World War I was the high point for the military use of observation balloons, which were extensively deployed by both sides. The British, despite their experience in late 1800s Africa, were behind developments and were still using spherical balloons. These were quickly replaced by versions, commonly referred to as kite balloons, which were flyable and could operate in more extreme weather conditions; at first the German Parseval-Siegsfeld type balloon, and then French Caquot type dirigible. By World War I, artillery had developed to the point where it was capable of engaging targets beyond the visual range of a ground-based observer. Positioning artillery observers on balloons, generally a few miles behind the front lines and at altitude, allowed them to see targets at greater range than they could on the ground. This allowed the artillery to take advantage of its increased range. German Balloon Corps, 1910 Because of their importance as observation platforms, balloons were defended by anti-aircraft guns, groups of machine guns for low altitude defence and patrolling fighter aircraft. Attacking a balloon was a risky venture but some pilots relished the challenge. The most successful were known as balloon busters, including such notables as Belgium's Willy Coppens, Germany's Friedrich Ritter von R√∂th, America's Frank Luke, and the Frenchmen L√©on Bourjade, Michel Coiffard and Maurice Boyau. Many expert balloon busters were careful not to go below in order to avoid exposure to anti-aircraft guns and machine-guns. Prussian Balloon Corps Barracks at Tegel World War I observation crews were the first to use parachutes, long before they were adopted by fixed wing aircrews. These were a primitive type, where the main part was in a bag suspended from the balloon, with the pilot only wearing a simple body harness around his waist, with lines from the harness attached to the main parachute in the bag. When the balloonist jumped, the main part of the parachute was pulled from the bag, with the shroud lines first, followed by the main canopy. This type of parachute was first adopted by the Germans and then later by the British and French for their observation balloon crews. Observation balloons began to be used at sea for anti-submarine purposes towards the end of World War I. The idiom \\"The balloon's going up!\\" as an expression for impending battle is derived from the very fact that an observation balloon's ascent likely signaled a preparatory bombardment for an offensive.  World War II  Barrage balloons, widely known as \\"blimps,\\" were used by the United Kingdom to intercept air attacks by German bombers and V-1 cruise missiles. Japan used recently discovered high-altitude air currents to send fire balloons (or fu- go) carrying explosive payloads to the United States. About 300 made it across the Pacific, causing some property damage and at least six deaths. The US government called for a press blackout on all balloon incidents, fearing what might happen if the Japanese started using fu-go to deliver biological weapons. Britain used free balloons in a number of ways including Operation Outward which launched nearly 100,000 small balloons to drop incendiaries on German occupied Europe or to trail wires to short out electrical distribution cables. Balloons also were used at sea, particularly by the US Navy for anti- submarine work. The Red Army of the Soviet Union used Observation Balloons for artillery spotting. 8 \\"Aeronautical Sections\\" existed and 19,985 observation flights were performed by balloonists of the Red Army during the war, clocking up 20,126 flight hours. 110 Soviet Observation Balloons were lost.  Postwar  Observation balloon over Afghanistan, 2011 The US military developed high- altitude ballooning programs for nuclear detection and surveillance, such as Project Mogul (linked to the Roswell Incident), Project Genetrix and Project Moby Dick. They also worked on the E77 balloon bomb, refining the principles of the Japanese fire balloon explosive-delivery system. Aerostats have been used by US and coalition military forces in Iraq and in Afghanistan. Balloons are used to gather intelligence and patrol above Israel's borders. What really makes the balloons stand out is their ability to remain in the sky for long periods of time. A balloon doesn't require constant refuelling like an aircraft does, and therefore is able to supply a constant source of intelligence on a target or a suspected area. If there's an area not visible from the ground, these surveillance balloons can reach a height and cover ground that may be difficult to detect from below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOW0SM2fpB0  Future of military ballooning  * A DARPA project explores the possibility of using balloons as non-line-of-sight communication relay among ground units and between ground units and aircraft.http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,Defensewatch_072105_Helms,00.html * As of 2013, military researchers are investigating lighter-than-air craft for carrying cargo and, possibly, troops in the Integrated Sensor is Structure (ISIS) and Long Endurance Multi-intelligence Vehicle (LEMV) programs.

She has written over 150 books as of June 2020, including 18 books for The Boxcar Children series, The Time Spies series and the Sunfire series. She wrote the Dungeons & Dragons novel, Key to the Griffon's Lair (October 2005). Her work includes picture books, easy readers, middle grade fiction, biographies, and nonfiction. More than 45 of her titles have been translated into 12 languages. Early years Ransom was born on July 10, 1952 in Washington, D.C. and was raised in Centreville, Virginia. Her parents are Thomas Garland and Irene Dellinger Farris. Her experiences growing up in rural Virginia, especially those as a student at Robert Frost Junior High School, provided ideas for her books' plots and characters. As a child, Ransom wanted to grow up to be a \\"Writer-detective-veterinarian-artist\\". She wrote her first book at age 7 because she had finished reading all the books for her grade at the school library. After that she scribbled stories in her spare time, usually casting herself as the star who had all the fun and solved all the mysteries, inventing the adventures that were in short supply in real life. \\"I was a very nerdy kid. And I didn't have a best friend until I was in fifth grade, so I wrote stories about how I imagined life could be.\\" In her senior year of high school Ransom began writing in earnest, and she made a commitment to herself to become an author; she decided to become a children's author because she loved children's books best of all. Career Lacking the finances to go to college, Ransom wrote magazine articles in her spare time while she earned a living as a secretary. Her first two submissions to publishers were a book titled ‚ÄúMystery of the Hidden Carousel‚Äù, which was sent to Harper, and a picture book about a mouse (text and colored pen drawings on the same page), which was sent to Whitman. \\"The mystery came back with tire tracks across the envelope. The picture book disappeared down a mouse hole.\\" Her first published book, The Silvery Pass, came out in 1982. The next big step in Ransom's career came when her publisher called with the chance to write a four-hundred-page historical novel for teens. This offer turned into the first two novels of the highly successful \\"Sunfire\\" series. By 1989 Ransom had published 17 books, and was invited to be the keynote speaker for the annual conference of The Society of Children's Book Writers. In 2004 Ransom graduated from Vermont College of Fine Arts with a MFA in Writing for Children, followed by an MA in children‚Äôs literature at Hollins University in 2007. Ransom has a monthly column in Bookology Magazine, titled \\"Big Green Pocketbook\\". The column discusses a range of issues related to books and reading, shares reflections on Ransom's own life as a child who read constantly, and shines a light on her writing influences and processes. In addition to her writing, Ransom teaches courses in writing at the university level. In 2006 she taught Creative Writing at Spalding University's graduate program, and has been a faculty member at Hollins University, teaching in the Children‚Äôs Literature Graduate Program, since 2008. As of June 2020 Ransom has written 150 books, including 18 books for The Boxcar Children series, The Time Spies series and the Sunfire series.

Organization  It is organized into 13 ecclesiastical provinces, subdivided into 13 archdioceses and 52 dioceses, and a Maronite apostolic exarchate. Over 120 religious orders, institutes, and lay organizations run hundreds of primary and secondary schools, hospitals, clinics, orphanages, colleges, and 8 universities across the country. The best known is Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (in Cali) and Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (in Bogot√°), both Jesuit universities.Annuario Pontificio, 2009. Based on studies and a survey, about 90% of the Colombian population adheres to Christianity, the majority of which (70.9%) are Catholic, while 16.7% adhere to Protestantism (primarily Evangelicalism). History Catholicism was introduced to the country 1508. Two dioceses were organized in 1534. The Church grow significantly by the mid-17th century, in spite of the variety of Indian languages, government interference and competition among religious orders. Some persecution followed the declaration of independence, in 1819. Throughout Latin America, the Church was subject to Spain and served its purposes throughout the colonial period and part of the nineteenth century. It was responsible for founding and directing schools for educating native elites (San Bartolome, El Rosario and the University of St. Thomas), creating and sustaining hospitals, help from the colonial bureaucracy and generally, as an instrument of control and social cohesion. In the late eighteenth century, the Bourbon reforms began to break down this scheme, especially with respect to education. For the first time the usefulness of the scholastic system used until then was questioned, and changes were sought. At Independence, the clergy split between those who supported the king (royalists) and those who preferred absolute independence (nationalists). The high clergy (bishops and dignitaries) supported the former, while parish priests and many of the religious, supported the latter. The role played by the clergy in Independence was decisive, because it contributed to the mobilization and recruitment of fighters; they served as chaplains and military leaders. With the Constitution of Colombia of 1991 the Colombian State was no longer Catholic. Equality and religious freedom were recognized. On June 22, 2012, media in Colombia, published the report titled \\"The Pope is concerned about the penetration of Pentecostals in Colombia\\" where religious pluralism merited serious consideration. The increasingly active presence of Pentecostal and Evangelical communities in many parts of Latin America were eviden. On October 31, 2012 Bishop Juan Vicente C√≥rdoba, Secretary General of the Colombian Episcopal Conference, announced that the Catholic Church would seek parishioners in shopping centers, placing parishes in these commercial establishments. 4 Mariano de Jesus Euse Hoyos (the \\"father Marianito\\") and 7 religious of San Juan de Dios were beatified while Mother Laura Montoya, founder of the Missionaries of Mary Immaculate and St. Catherine of Siena (lauritas), was canonized.  Influence  Catholicism wielded a strong influence on public opinion and government affairs. The Church influences various fields and institutions, including: * Military and Police‚ÄìThe Bishopric of Colombia Castrense serves exclusively as staff diocese to active and retired staff and family members of the Colombian Armed Forces and the National Police. * The Apostolic Nunciature‚Äìthe embassy of the Holy See in the country. * The faithful‚Äìrepresenting about 90% of the population. * Churches‚Äìland acquisition and construction * The Concordat with the Holy See came into force in 1886; the Constitutional Court enforced some of its provisions in 1993. The Colombian Bishops ' Conference spoke against it two weeks later.

Janice is raising a new daughter with Bobby Baccalieri, who has taken up model railroading as a hobby. Meadow continues her relationship with Finn. A.J. is now attending college. Adriana is remembered by a worrying Carmela. Vito Spatafore is thinner and is now a spokesperson for a weight loss company; he is Tony's best earner and is ambitious. Phil Leotardo, now the acting boss of the Lupertazzi crime family, is taking care of business for the imprisoned Johnny Sack. In Brooklyn, Hesh Rabkin and his son-in-law Eli Kaplan are assaulted by Lupertazzi associates. Trying to escape, Eli is knocked down by a hit-and-run driver and seriously injured. At Hesh's request, Tony tries to reach out directly to Johnny through his optometrist brother-in-law, Anthony Infante, but Johnny is only paying attention to his immediate family's financial troubles. Finally, Tony, Vito, and Christopher - now a caporegime in the DiMeo crime family - meet with Phil and Gerry \\"The Hairdo\\" Torciano. Disputes between Tony and Phil are resolved, and it is explained that the New York associates were protecting Gerry's area and did not know Eli associated with the Sopranos; they agree to pay Eli $50,000 compensation. Carmela's construction of her spec house is suspended, due to a \\"stop order\\" issued by a building inspector because improper lumber has been used. Her father, Hugh De Angelis, thinks an inspector he used to know would waive the requirement, but his contact has retired. Carmela repeatedly asks Tony to see if he can get the stop order lifted, but he keeps putting it off. Eugene Pontecorvo inherits $2 million, and would like to retire with his family to Florida. Bearing gifts, he goes to Tony to ask permission. Tony reminds Eugene that he took an oath. Later, Eugene gives him a cut of the inheritance. At Chris's behest, he then kills a debtor; in return, Chris says, \\"I'll put in a good word to T about the Florida thing.\\" Tony's decision is relayed through Silvio: \\"Your Florida thing. That's a no-go.\\" Eugene is also an informant for the FBI. He is now more valuable than before because Ray Curto has died; they, too, will not free him. His wife is bitter. His son is almost certainly on heroin again. Eugene hangs himself. Uncle Junior's mind is deteriorating. Tony helps him look for some money he thinks he buried in his backyard thirty years ago, but they find nothing. Both Dr. Melfi and Janice suggest a retirement home or assisted living for him, but Tony forcefully refuses. One afternoon, when Junior is particularly agitated, no one else is free to look after him, so Tony goes. While Tony is cooking dinner Junior, thinking he is a long-dead mobster, shoots him in the gut. While Junior cowers in a closet upstairs, Tony manages to dial 911 before passing out. First appearances The episode marks the first appearances of: * Agent Ron Goddard: FBI Agent Harris' new partner working counter-terrorism. * Anthony Infante: Ginny Sacrimoni's brother, who owns an eyewear store. * Domenica \\"Nica\\" Baccalieri: Janice and Bobby's 12-month-old daughter. * James \\"Murmur\\" Zancone: Christopher's associate and Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor who Christopher says is also good at forging documents. * Gerry \\"The Hairdo\\" Torciano: soldier and acting capo in the Lupertazzi crime family and Phil Leotardo's prot√©g√© after his brother's death; responsible for Phil Leotardo's business in Brooklyn following his promotion to acting boss. Deceased * Raymond Curto: stroke * Teddy Spirodakis: shot by Eugene in a diner * Eugene Pontecorvo: suicide by hanging * Dick Barone: (offscreen) owner of Barone Sanitation; died of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). Title reference * Eugene Pontecorvo is shown wearing a \\"Members Only\\" jacket and is made fun of for it by Vito Spatafore. * It could refer to the Mafia code of being a member only and never a retiree, just what Eugene Pontecorvo attempted to become. Production * The \\"traditional\\" season premiere sequence involving The Star-Ledger newspaper is not featured. Instead, a montage of the characters is featured showcasing what has happened in the past two years. A new version of the scene with the delivered newspaper appears in the fifth episode of the season, \\"Mr. & Mrs. John Sacrimoni Request.\\" * Frank Vincent (Phil Leotardo), Dan Grimaldi (Patsy Parisi), Joseph Gannascoli (Vito Spatafore), and Toni Kalem (Angie Bonpensiero) are promoted to starring cast and are now billed in the opening credits but only for the episodes in which they appear. * Jamie-Lynn Sigler is again billed by her original last name in the opening credits, following her separation from her agent and husband, A.J. DiScala, after Season 5 ended. * In the original broadcast of this episode (March 12, 2006), no previews for the next episode were shown in order to keep the aftermath of Tony's shooting a mystery. References to prior episodes * Pussy Malanga, the man Uncle Junior was convinced is after him and whom he eventually mistakes Tony for is the same mobster Uncle Junior wanted to kill in Artie Bucco's first restaurant in the pilot episode. * Dr. Melfi recalls that Tony grabbed a pillow in order to smother his mother in \\"I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano,\\" but Tony denies this, saying he only grabbed the pillow to occupy his hands. * Dr. Melfi calls the home that Tony put his mother in a \\"retirement community\\" and Tony corrects her and calls it a nursing home. Before this, whenever somebody called it a nursing home, Tony always corrected them and called it a retirement community. * The appearance of Adriana La Cerva's ghost to Carmela in the spec house recalls Adriana's statement to FBI Agent Robyn Sanseverino in \\"Watching Too Much Television\\": \\"Why don't you go haunt a house or something\\"? Other cultural references * Tony refers to his forgetful Uncle Junior as \\"Knucklehead Smiff.\\" * Vito asks Agent Harris if he had lost weight due to the Atkins diet. * When Eugene proposes retiring, he cites the precedent set by \\"Joe Bananas\\" (Joseph Bonanno). * The movie Junior watches is Paths of Glory, a 1957 war movie directed by Stanley Kubrick. * When Junior says Pussy Malanga is prank calling his house Tony says they will get FBI director J. Edgar Hoover to investigate. Music * The song featured in the opening scene and closing credits is \\"Seven Souls\\" by Bill Laswell. It features William S. Burroughs reading from his novel The Western Lands. Creator David Chase describes the song as featuring a strong foreboding tone and themes touching the concepts of death and resurrection.

For that reason, his portrait hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. Early life Triplett, the son of a postal worker, was born and raised in the Philadelphia suburb of La Mott, Pennsylvania, part of Cheltenham Township. His reputation as a talented high school football player, combined with his upscale address, prompted the University of Miami to offer him a scholarship sight unseen, under the assumption Triplett was white. The then-segregated university rescinded the scholarship when they discovered Triplett was black. Triplett instead earned a Senatorial Scholarship for his academics and chose to attend Penn State University in the fall of 1945. Penn State Along with Dennis Hoggard, Triplett was one of the first African-Americans to take the field in a varsity football game for the Penn State Nittany Lions. During the 1946 season, the Penn State team voted to cancel a regular-season game in Miami against the Miami Hurricanes, rather than compromise by not bringing their black players. (Miami, like other southern schools at the time, refused to compete against integrated schools unless they left their black players at home.) In 1948, Triplett became the first African-American to play in the Cotton Bowl Classic, catching the tying touchdown in Penn State's 13-13 tie with Southern Methodist University. Triplett also co-founded the Gamma Nu chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha while at Penn State. Triplett returned to Penn State on November 11, 2015, to meet with head coach James Franklin and the team after their bye-week scrimmage. NFL Although Triplett was the third African-American chosen in the 1949 NFL Draft, he was the first of the draftees to take the field in a league game.

When he returned from active duty, the Lions traded him to the Chicago Cardinals. He retired from professional football in 1953. After his playing days, Triplett worked as a teacher, in the insurance business, and in management for the Chrysler Corporation. Triplett died on November 8, 2018, at age 92.

Each book featured a teenage girl who experienced a particular period or event in American history. At the same time, with very few exceptions, the girl was torn between two potential lovers. The girl was typically ahead of her time in ideas and actions and the suitor she almost always chose was the one who approved of or accepted her actions. The cover art always featured the main character flanked by her two potential lovers, along with scenes from the historical event or period that was the setting for the book.

Critic Heather Phares writes that Zedek's music can be defined by \\"the permanent, aching rasp in her voice, her guitar's bluesy bite, the startlingly clear-eyed lyrics about life and loss.\\" Biography Thalia Zedek Band at Club W71, Weikersheim 2019 Zedek grew up in the metropolitan area of Washington, D.C. She attended Springbrook High School in Maryland, where she played clarinet in the marching band under band director Charles Sickafus. The early punk era of the late 1970s in which she came of age, and in particular Patti Smith, contributed deeply to the formation of her musical aesthetic. While still at high school, she would travel to New York City with her brother, Dan Zedek, to see Smith perform. Zedek moved to Boston in 1979, attending Boston University for one semester before deciding to pursue a musical career instead. Her first band, the all- female White Women, broke up after a couple of years, and she formed the Dangerous Birds. This group had somewhat more success, including a single, \\"Smile on Your Face/Alpha Romeo\\", which achieved airplay on college and alternative-commercial radio; but Zedek wanted a more \\"violent\\" sound in contrast to the somewhat \\"girlie pop\\" tendencies of her Dangerous Birds bandmates. Her next project, Uzi, worked towards this aim, producing an EP, Sleep Asylum. The EP was characterized by elusive yet subtly menacing lyrics superimposed upon lugubrious but driving instrumental tracks, featuring layers of dense, murky yet muscular guitar arrangements, blended with heady synthesizer and tape effects. However, despite the promise of \\"Sleep Asylum\\", Uzi dissolved, owing to tension between Zedek and the band's drummer, Danny Lee. She next took the role of primary vocalist for New York City's Live Skull, a band already well established. While the album Dusted, the first product of this collaboration, reflected an intense synergy between Zedek's vocal style and the complexly histrionic instrumental work of Live Skull, the follow-up Positraction floundered, and Live Skull also disbanded, due to conflicts, in 1990. By that time, Zedek had also run into problems regarding heroin addiction. Motivated to quit, she returned to Boston and the support of her friends. She soon co-founded Come, with Codeine drummer and guitarist Chris Brokaw. It was with them that she had her biggest successes, releasing four albums before the group disbanded in 2001. In that same year, she also released Been Here and Gone, her first solo project. Since then she has released two other full-length albums and several EPs. Zedek was also a participant in the 1998 Suffragette Sessions tour, organized by the Indigo Girls. In 2006, she performed at North East Sticks Together. In spite of limited commercial success, Zedek has been acclaimed by music critics throughout her career, and has arguably been deeply influential within the indie-rock realm, particularly through her influence within the prolific Boston indie scene, which has spawned many noteworthy artists. She is an \\"out- and-proud lesbian\\".

History Catholicism has historically been the majority religion since Cuba's colonization. However, Communist Cuba is no exception to the ideological clash between Communism and Catholicism that was common in communist countries. After Fidel Castro's ascent to power in 1959, he imposed restrictions on religious activities such as Christmas celebrations, and in 1962 barred personnel of the Church from joining the Communist Party of Cuba - following a communist tradition of Marxist-Leninist atheism. However, Castro's efforts were not as successful as in traditionally communist countries such as the USSR or China. When the Cold War ended, such restrictions were lifted and the atheist guidelines outlined in the Cuban Constitution were removed. Catholics have been able openly join the Party since 1990. In 1998 Pope John Paul II made an official visit to Cuba and met leader Fidel Castro in person. Castro honored the Pope publicly. Pope Benedict XVI visited in 2012, meeting both Fidel and Ra√∫l Castro, as did Pope Francis in 2015. Current status The Catholic Church body in Cuba is governed by the Cuban Bishops Conference. There are over six million Catholics - around 60.5% of the total population. The country is divided into eleven dioceses including three archdioceses. The Catholic Church in Cuba has taken on a more politically active role than in many other countries. It claims to have engaged in discussion with the government on issues such as political prisoners and free market reforms. Catholics in Cuba have greater religious freedom than those in other Communist countries such as China and Vietnam.

Overview According to the 2011 census, there were 1.08 million Catholics in the country representing about 1/10 of the total population. There are eight dioceses including two archdiocese. In addition, there is a separate jurisdiction for those of the Byzantine Rite called the Ruthenian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Czech Republic. The Catholic Church is the largest single religious denomination in the country. History=Protestant Bohemia vs. the Habsburgs After the death of Jan Hus in 1415, the Czechs were mostly Hussite, a diverse sect which was considered heretical by the Catholic Church. The Hussite wars were fought over religious freedom in Bohemia as five consecutive crusades ordered by the Pope failed miserably. The majority of Hussites (the Utraquists) eventually made peace with Rome in the Religious peace of Kutna Hora of 1485. However, the Unity of the Brethren, founded in 1457, maintained a radical course and eventually played an important role in the Protestant Reformation and widely disseminating its principles. By the end of the 16th century, less than 20% of the population remained Catholic. After their defeat in the 1620 Battle of the White Mountain, Bohemia and Moravia were subjugated and forcefully re-converted to Catholicism by the imperial authorities, with Protestantism all but vanquished. The Czechs were made once again majority Catholic until after World War I (although many openly resented the church and were forced to hold a membership to avoid persecution, especially under the Habsburgs), when anti-Catholicism fed by nationalist anti-German sentiment and national revival perceiving the Church as historical enemy caused mass defections from the Church.Political Catholicism in Europe 1918-1945, Volume I; Wolfram Kaiser and Helmut Wohnout, editors, pp. 181-2 Following World War II The reconstituted Protestant Hussite Church and the Czech Brethren were major beneficiaries of this defection from Catholicism until after World War II, when the overall belief in organized religion started to fall steeply. In addition, the Sudeten Germans, who were those Austrians who ended up within Czech borders after World War I, were mostly Catholics, and their expulsion after World War II also reduced the Church's presence. Over 90% Catholic in 1910, the Czech Republic is now reduced to some 10%. Communist regime The Communist regime, which seized power in 1948 in what was then Czechoslovakia, confiscated all the property owned by churches and persecuted many priests. Churches were then allowed to function only under the state's strict control and supervision and priests' salaries paid by the state. Churches were seized, priests jailed or executed and those allowed to celebrate liturgies did so under the supervision of the secret police. After the Velvet Revolution, some churches and monasteries were returned, but the churches have since sought to get back other assets such as farms, woodlands and buildings. During the Communist regime, various underground Catholic movements existed. Among these is the Koinotes group, centered on Bishop Felix Davidek, whose vicar general was Ludmila Javorov√°, ordained by him to the presbyterate. 2012 Agreement In January 2012 the Czech government agreed to pay billions of dollars in compensation for property seized by the former totalitarian regime from the Church. The compensation plan was to be spread over 30 years Under the plan, the country's 17 churches, including Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox, would get 56 percent of their former property now held by the state ‚Äì estimated at 75 billion koruna ($3.7 billion) ‚Äì and 59 billion koruna ($2.9 billion) in financial compensation paid to them over the next 30 years. Eighty percent of funds and property will go the Catholic Church, by far the biggest recipient. The state will also gradually stop covering their expenses over the next 17. In 2008, a similar bill was approved by the government but Parliament rejected it.\\"Church restitution opponents in papal plea,\\" Jonathan Luxmoore, THE TABLET, 25 May 2013, 25.\\"Churches compensated for seized properties,\\" CHRISTIANITY TODAY, November 2011, 12.

The Gosannen kassen arose because of a series of quarrels within the Kiyohara clan (sometimes referred to as \\"Kiyowara\\"). The long-standing disturbances were intractable. When Minamoto no Yoshiie, who became Governor of Mutsu province in 1083, tried to calm the fighting which continued between Kiyohara no Masahira, Iehira, and Narihira.

During the Siege of Kanezawa, 1086-1089, Yoshiie avoided an ambush by noticing a flock of birds take flight from a forest.

History The station opened on 25 May 1844, The old station house, closed for many years, is a listed building, but when the line was completed, was the first stop for the ceremonial train, the guests disembarking for a meal at Violet Hill (Edenmore House, now St. Joseph's Hospital.) The station was built to serve the small village (back then) of Raheny. Trains often stopped there and were convenient for passengers going into the city. As time went on, urban sprawl started to develop. Most houses in the area were built in the 1950s and 1960s. But because of closures across the rail network, the service level to the station remained the same and usage volumes did not rise. But as the 1980s came, the station was modernised with a new ticket office steps and upgraded platforms, as part of the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) development. Ever since the station's service level has remained similar, with minor upgrades such as new shelters ticket machines and information screens. Facilities The station today comprises a modern ticket office, with a bypass gate when this is closed, with a lift to the southbound platform. With a footbridge and ramp connecting the northbound platform with accessibility also. On the platforms there is space for 8 carriage trains. Along with 2 shelters on the southbound platform and 1 shelter on the northbound. On each platform there are LED and direct telephone line to the control offices in Connolly. Within the ticket office are two automatic ticket machines. The ticket office is open between 05:45-00:30, Monday to Sunday. Services At peak times, trains come every 5-10 minutes each way, while off-peak frequency on weekdays is every 10 minutes in each direction from 06:50 and 20:00, and every 15 minutes outside of those times. On Saturday the frequency is around every 15 minutes in each direction, and on Sunday every 20 minutes in each direction.

Summary Based on his participant observation field work (he was employed as a physical therapist's assistant under a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health at a mental institution in Washington, D.C.), Goffman details his theory of the \\"total institution\\" (principally in the example he gives, as the title of the book indicates, mental institutions) and the process by which it takes efforts to maintain predictable and regular behavior on the part of both \\"guard\\" and \\"captor,\\" suggesting that many of the features of such institutions serve the ritual function of ensuring that both classes of people know their function and social role, in other words of \\"institutionalising\\" them. Goffman concludes that adjusting the inmates to their role has at least as much importance as \\"curing\\" them. In the essay \\"Notes on the Tinkering Trades,\\" Goffman concluded that the \\"medicalization\\" of mental illness and the various treatment modalities are offshoots of the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution and that the so-called \\"medical model\\" for treating patients was a variation on the way trades- and craftsmen of the late 19th century repaired clocks and other mechanical objects: in the confines of a shop or store, contents and routine of which remained a mystery to the customer. The book comprises four free-standing essays On the Characteristics of Total Institutions, The Moral Career of the Mental Patient The Underlife of a Public Institution and The Medical Model and Mental Hospitalization. Reception Asylums brought Goffman immediate recognition when it was published in 1961, and by the 1970s had become required reading in some introductory sociology courses, according to socialist author Peter Sedgwick, who considered the book a \\"powerful and compelling study\\" and the recognition it brought to Goffman \\"thoroughly deserved\\".

In the last game of his career, an Alamo Bowl victory against Michigan, he shut down the Wolverine receivers, switching positions when necessary to stop the \\"hot\\" receiver. For his career, he had 162 tackles and nine interceptions for Texas A&M.; He started the final 34 games of his college career and finished his career 4th on A&M;'s all-time passes defended list. NFL Mickens was drafted in the third-round by the New York Jets in the 1996 NFL Draft. He played for the Jets from 1996 to 2004. Mickens only sat out two games in his first eight NFL seasons before missing the 2004 season because of a torn ACL. He built a reputation as one of the top nickel backs in the NFL and also a very capable starter. He played in 126 games with 36 starts over the course of his first eight seasons while registering 365 tackles, 79 passes defended, 11 INT, four forced fumbles and six sacks. Mickens was released by the Jets.. He signed a one-year contract with the Browns as a free agent prior to the 2005 season and played in all 16 games, starting three, and recording 33 tackles and 16 passes defended. Mickens signed with the Jets once again on May 31, 2006, but was eventually waived when rosters were reduced to the 53 men following the last pre-season game. He was signed by the New England Patriots in December 2006 and was a prominent player in their run to the division championship game. He filed for free agency on March 3, 2007. PersonalHis brother Fred Williams played for the 1993 Houston Oilers. Mickens won the 1999 Madden Bowl.

The resulting hexafluorosilicic acid is almost exclusively consumed as a precursor to aluminum trifluoride and synthetic cryolite, which are used in aluminium processing. Salts derived from hexafluorosilicic acid are called hexafluorosilicates.  Structure  Hexafluorosilicic acid is generally assumed to consist of oxonium ions charge balanced by hexafluorosilicate dianions as well as water. In aqueous solution, the hydronium cation (H3O+) is traditionally equated with a solvated proton, and as such, the formula for this compound is often written as . Extending that metaphor, the isolated compound is then written as , or .The situation is similar to that for chloroplatinic acid, fluoroboric acid, and hexafluorophosphoric acid. Hexafluorosilicate is an octahedral anion; the Si‚ÄìF bond distances are 1.71 √Ö. Hexafluorosilicic acid is only available commercially as solution. Production and principal reactions The commodity chemical hydrogen fluoride is produced from fluorite by treatment with sulfuric acid.USGS. Fluorspar. As a by-product, approximately 50 kg of (H3O)2SiF6 is produced per tonne of HF owing to reactions involving silica- containing mineral impurities. (H3O)2SiF6 is also produced as a by-product from the production of phosphoric acid from apatite and fluorapatite. Again, some of the HF in turn reacts with silicate minerals, which are an unavoidable constituent of the mineral feedstock, to give silicon tetrafluoride. Thus formed, the silicon tetrafluoride reacts further with HF. The net process can be described as: : + 6 HF ‚Üí + 2 Hexafluorosilicic acid can also be produced by treating silicon tetrafluoride with hydrofluoric acid. In water, hexafluorosilicic acid readily hydrolyzes to hydrofluoric acid and various forms of amorphous and hydrated silica (\\"SiO2\\"). At the concentration usually used for water fluoridation, 99% hydrolysis occurs and the pH drops. The rate of hydrolysis increases with pH. At the pH of drinking water, the degree of hydrolysis is essentially 100%. :H2SiF6 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí 6 HF + \\"SiO2\\" Neutralization of solutions of hexafluorosilicic acid with alkali metal bases produces the corresponding alkali metal fluorosilicate salts: :(H3O)2SiF6 \\\\+ 2 NaOH ‚Üí Na2SiF6 \\\\+ 4 H2O The resulting salt Na2SiF6 is mainly used in water fluoridation. Related ammonium and barium salts are produced similarly for other applications. Near neutral pH, hexafluorosilicate salts hydrolyze rapidly according to this equation: : + 2 H2O ‚Üí 6 F‚àí \\\\+ SiO2 \\\\+ 4 H+ Uses The majority of the hexafluorosilicic acid is converted to aluminium fluoride and cryolite. These materials are central to the conversion of aluminium ore into aluminium metal. The conversion to aluminium trifluoride is described as: :H2SiF6 \\\\+ Al2O3 ‚Üí 2 AlF3 \\\\+ SiO2 \\\\+ H2O Hexafluorosilicic acid is also converted to a variety of useful hexafluorosilicate salts. The potassium salt, Potassium fluorosilicate, is used in the production of porcelains, the magnesium salt for hardened concretes and as an insecticide, and the barium salts for phosphors. Hexafluorosilicic acid is also used as an electrolyte in the Betts electrolytic process for refining lead. Hexafluorosilicic acid (identified as hydrofluorosilicic acid on the label) along with oxalic acid are the active ingredients used in Iron Out rust-removing cleaning products, which are essentially varieties of laundry sour. Niche applications H2SiF6 is a specialized reagent in organic synthesis for cleaving Si‚ÄìO bonds of silyl ethers. It is more reactive for this purpose than HF. It reacts faster with t-butyldimethysilyl (TBDMS) ethers than triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) ethers. Hexafluorosilicic acid and the salts are used as wood preservation agents. Natural salts Some rare minerals, encountered either within volcanic or coal-fire fumaroles, are salts of the hexafluorosilicic acid. Examples include ammonium hexafluorosilicate that naturally occurs as two polymorphs: cryptohalite and bararite.https://www.mindat.org/min-1163.htmlhttps://www.mindat.org/min-511.htmlKruszewski, ≈Å., Fabia≈Ñska, M.J., Segit, T., Kusy, D., Motyli≈Ñski, R., Ciesielczuk, J., Deput, E., 2020.

Since its independence from Indonesia, East Timor became only the second predominantly Catholic country in Asia (after the Philippines), a legacy of its status as a former Portuguese colony. About 96.9% of the population is Catholic in East Timor as of 2006, which means over 900,000 faithful. The country was divided into three dioceses: Dili, Baucau and Maliana (erected in 2010). These dioceses are immediately subject to the Holy See. The Apostolic Nuncio to East Timor is concurrently the nuncio to Indonesia. The position has been vacant since 11 October 2019, and the nunciature is located in Jakarta. History Procession in Becora, Dili Virgin and child from East Timor, 19th century In the early 16th century, Portuguese and Dutch traders made contact with East Timor. A Dominican mission was sent by the bishop of Malacca to Solor in 1562, and became established at Lifau in present-day East Timor in 1641. Portugal took over and maintained control of East Timor until 1974, with a brief occupation by Japan during World War II. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed the former Portuguese colony. East Timorese animist belief systems did not fit with Indonesia's constitutional monotheism, resulting in mass conversions to Christianity. Portuguese clergy were replaced with Indonesian priests and Latin and Portuguese mass was replaced by Indonesian mass.Taylor, Jean Gelman (2003), p.381 The Church played an important role in society during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. While just 20% of East Timorese called themselves Catholics at the time of the 1975 invasion, the figure surged to reach 95% by the end of the first decade after the invasion. During the occupation, Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo became one of the most prominent advocates for human rights in East Timor and many priests and nuns risked their lives in defending citizens from military abuses. Pope John Paul II's 1989 visit to East Timor exposed the occupied territory's situation to world media and provided a catalyst for independence activists to seek global support. Officially neutral, the Vatican wished to retain good relations with Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation. Upon his arrival in East Timor, the Pope symbolically kissed a cross then pressed it to the ground, alluding to his usual practice of kissing the ground on arrival in a nation, and yet avoiding overtly suggesting East Timor was a sovereign country. He spoke fervently against abuses in his sermon, whilst avoiding naming the Indonesian authorities as responsible. The Pope spoke out against violence in East Timor, and called for both sides to show restraint, imploring the East Timorese to \\"love and pray for their enemies.\\" In 1996, Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and Jos√© Ramos-Horta, two leading East Timorese activists for peace and independence, received the Nobel Peace Prize for \\"\\"their work towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor\\".http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1996/ A number of priests and nuns were murdered in the violence in East Timor that followed the 1999 Independence referendum. The newly independent nation declared three days of national mourning upon the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005. The Catholic Church remains very involved in politics, with its 2005 confrontations with the government over religious education in school and the forgoing of war crimes trials for atrocities against East Timorese by Indonesia. They have also endorsed the new Prime Minister in his efforts to promote national reconciliation. In June 2006 Catholic Relief Services received aid from the United States to help victims of months of unrest in the country. The number of churches has grown from 100 in 1974 to over 800 in 1994.Robinson, G. ‚ÄúIf you leave us here, we will die‚Äù Princeton University Press 2010 p 72.

While Holmes exists predominately in the context of Victorian-era London, he has been mentioned in such outre contexts as the 22nd century or hunting aliens or supernatural enemies. These references are in addition to the innumerable passing references to Sherlock Holmes made in many literary and cinematic works, such as the labeling of a person as a \\"Sherlock\\", whether in reference to their intelligence (or in jest or sarcasm). Books One of the first attempts was made in response to the \\"Great Hiatus\\" (when Arthur Conan Doyle decided not to write any more Holmes stories, to the dismay of his fans). Stepping into the breach, John Kendrick Bangs wrote Pursuit of the House-Boat (1897) [a sequel to his A House-Boat on the Styx(1895)], in which a deceased gentleman's clubhouse boat is stolen, whereupon Holmes arrives to help his fellow-deceased track down the boat by chartering a ship from Hades to London. Bangs' version of Holmes then comments to himself: > \\"For now,\\" he said, with a chuckle, \\"I can get back to earth again free of > cost on my own hook, whether my eminent inventor wants me there or not. I > never approved of his killing me off as he did at the very height of my > popularity.\\" However, in 1894, Conan Doyle decided to return to writing, bringing Holmes back from the dead by claiming he had faked his death in \\"The Empty House\\". While Bangs' attempt was reverential, Maurice Leblanc decided to write the short story \\"Sherlock Holmes arrive trop tard\\" (\\"Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late\\"). In it, Holmes meets the young thief Lupin for a brief time, unaware that he is, in fact, Lupin. After legal objections from Conan Doyle, the name was changed to \\"Herlock Sholm√®s\\" with the pseudonym \\"Holmlock Shears\\" in the earliest English versions. Holmes returned in two more stories collected in Volume 2, Ars√®ne Lupin contre Herlock Sholm√®s, having opened the floodgates to less flattering versions of Holmes. One of the more recent parodies in print is \\"The Lord Mike Saga\\", wherein Mycroft Miles (n√©e Mills) is the Holmes figure, with the titles reflecting the styles: \\"A Study in Varlets\\", \\"The Strange Case of the Moth-Eater of Clapham Common\\", \\"Happy Times and Places\\", and \\"A Cameo Broached\\". Miles refuses to speak of Holmes, referring to him only as \\"the other chap\\". Frequent speculation as to the \\"real\\" Holmes has existed since publication, and Mark Frost's novel The List of Seven (1993) and its sequel The Six Messiahs (1995) are not the first to put a spin on this. Frost has Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as its main character and tells the (fictional) story of how Doyle's Holmes was inspired by Johnathon Sparks, a mysterious man who saves Doyle's life from a mad occultist. The Wold Newton family series connects multiple famous fictional characters together to a mail coach that passed a radioactive asteroid in the eighteenth century - Holmes is a descendant of one of the travelers in that coach. In his 1967 Man from U.N.C.L.E. novel The Rainbow Affair, David McDaniel inserts unnamed cameos by The Saint, Miss Marple, John Steed, Emma Peel, Willie Garvin, Tommy Hambledon, Neddie Seagoon, Father Brown, and Dr. Fu Manchu.

Later films would blur the lines between canon and non-canon, however. *In the sci-fi film Time After Time (1979), H.G.

The name \\"Basil\\" is no mere coincidence: one of Holmes's aliases in the original Conan Doyle stories is \\"Captain Basil\\". Also, the actor Basil Rathbone famously portrayed Holmes on film. The film is based on the Basil of Baker Street novels. *Continuing the print tradition of goodnatured irreverence, the comedy film Without a Clue (1988) presents the premise that Holmes was a fictional creation of John Watson's, who was the true deductive genius.

The estate grew and in 1826 it was called Hope Estate. Hope Botanical Garden and Zoo The Hope Botanical Garden and Zoo, located on Old Hope Road, includes a botanical garden, orchid house, and stone aqueduct. There is also a children‚Äôs amusement park and a zoo. It is located on what was formerly the Hope Estate. In 1881, the government acquired the land and laid out the gardens. In 1953, the Royal Botanical Gardens were formed for a visit by Queen Elizabeth II. The Botanical Gardens are the largest in the Caribbean.

At the Vienna Academy he published a work on physical chemistry. He also studied mineralogy. In 1859, together with fellow chemist Anton√≠n Bƒõlohoubek, he participated in a detailed chemical and microscopic analysis of the authenticity of the notorious Queen's Court (Dv≈Ør Kr√°lov√©) and Green Mountain (Zelen√° Hora) manuscripts. Finding Prussian Blue (unknown until the 18th century) in the initialling of the manuscripts, which were purported to date from the 1200s, they came to the conclusion that the manuscripts were forgeries and literary hoaxes.

He worked to improve Czech chemical terminology, building on and improving over the nomenclature of Czech chemist Jan Svatopluk Presl and the linguist Josef Jungmann. In 1882 he was appointed as the first professor of chemistry at Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague.

It has been referred to as the Nintendo 64's first native fighting game, though in actuality it is a port of a cancelled Sega Saturn game. In addition, it was originally announced that the Microsoft Windows version of the game would precede the Nintendo 64 version by one month. It was originally announced under the title \\"Criticom II\\", and is the second of three fighting games developed by Kronos Digital, falling between Criticom and Cardinal Syn. Gameplay Players choose from eight playable characters to start; there are also two hidden characters which are unlocked by completing the game in single-player mode. Fights go for a default three-out-of-five rounds, as opposed to the more conventional two-out- of-three. Plot Dark Rift takes place far in the future, sometime after the events of Criticom. Gameplay spans three dimensions: the Neutral Dimension (where Earth is located), the Dark Dimension (home to demons), and the Light Dimension (home to energy beings). Although the creatures of the Dark Dimension are demonic, there is no indication that the inhabitants of the Light Dimension have any angelic qualities. The crystal (the acquisition of which is the main motivation of the characters of Criticom) turns out to be the Core Prime Element of a Master Key, one which holds the power to all the secrets in the universe. The Master Key was found eons ago lodged in a spatial tear. When it was retrieved it burst into three pieces, sending two pieces into alternate dimensions, and widening the tear into the game's namesake Dark Rift. Development Stan Liu (head and founder of Kronos) said \\"we got stuck doing fighting games for a while simply because we were one of the very few U.S. game developers that actually made a fighting game. Hence, Dark Rift and Cardinal Syn.\\" Unlike its predecessor Criticom, motion capture was used to create all the fighter animations in Dark Rift. The animation work was directed by Ted Warnock, whose background was in traditional animation. Reception Dark Rift received generally mixed reviews. A number of critics deemed it a dramatic improvement over Kronos's previous fighting game, Criticom. Doug Perry of IGN, for example, concluded that \\"Kronos has overcome its Criticom syndrome: the level of character detail is there, the many chained combos, the feel of the game, the variety of fighters and fighting styles are all good. Dark Rift shines through its weaknesses, and, for the time being, can be called the best fighter on Nintendo 64.\\" The most widely praised aspects were the graphics and animation; Shawn Smith of Electronic Gaming Monthly went so far as to compare it to Virtua Fighter 3 (a game which ran on cutting edge arcade hardware) in this respect. However, he and his three co-reviewers further commented that the game is weak in every other respect, and Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot said that it \\"feels like a Virtua Fighter-inspired mishmash of monsters, demons, and guys with guns. The graphic effects are the only things that save Dark Rift from falling below average.\\" By contradiction, Perry and a Next Generation critic both highly praised the character designs, particularly Demonica and Morphix. The specific criticisms of the game varied. Doug Perry and EGMs Dan Hsu said that the projectiles are slow to the point of being useless. Edge criticized Dark Rift for lacking original features, calling it an average fighting game that \\"fails to produce a single surprise or elicit one impressive moment of action.\\" GamePro found the combos too difficult to perform, but nonetheless deemed Dark Rift \\"a fast, fun, polygon-based 3D fighting game that's imaginative with its use of graphics, and may break ground for other poly-fighters like Tekken on the N64.\\" Full review content appears only in printed version.

Relationships The city maintains two types of relationships with other cities, partnership and friendship. Partnership cities are selected by city staff, with a focus toward economic development. Friendship cities activities are proposed by the community and endorsed by a member of Toronto City Council. Partnership cities * Chicago, Illinois, United States (1991) * Chongqing, China (1986) * Frankfurt, Germany (1989) * Milan, Italy (2003) Friendship cities * Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (2006) * Kyiv, Ukraine (1992) * Quito, Ecuador (2006) * Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2015) * Sagamihara, Japan (1991) * Warsaw, Poland (1990) * Hawaii, United States (2018) Formation of relationships Toronto's city council considers requests to form relationships with other cities through its International Alliance Program. The criteria for both Partnership Cities and Friendship Cities were adopted by council December 5‚Äì7, 2005. Forming a relationship is primarily dependent on budget constraints of the Economic Development Committee, the municipal office which administers the program. Proposals for new relationships are requested by city staff, of their own volition or on behalf of a third party. These proposals are analyzed for political and financial impact, and a recommendation is then presented to the Economic Development Committee. Principles for new relationships In order to prevent spurious proposals, cities that are candidates for a relationship with Toronto must satisfy the following conditions: * there can be no more than one relationship in any region * the candidate city cannot have a relationship with another Canadian city * community groups must raise funds to support exchanges with Friendship Cities to which they have committed * the federal government must have a relationship with the country in which the candidate city is located Proposals for new candidates are submitted to the General Manager of Economic Development; all proposals are analyzed and compiled into a yearly recommendation which coincides with the city's budget process. Criteria for Friendship cities To be considered for Friendship City status, a candidate city must fulfill the following criteria: * it must be sponsored by a member of Toronto City Council * it must be co-sponsored by an individual, group or association in the community that will assume responsibility for all activities with the Friendship city * it must have support from the candidate city with respect to community interest and participation * it must be a community of interest, with active support in Toronto and the Friendship city * it must follow the international policy framework approved by Council in May 2002 Candidate analysis Once a proposal is presented to the General Manager of Economic Development, it is reviewed by staff to determine the candidate's status and applicability for formation of a relationship with Toronto. Whereas the criteria identified are minimal requirements, the review process is a more thorough investigation of the candidate city. Recommendations to accept a proposal are often made only for cities which have strong similarities to, or compatibility with, Toronto. It must exhibit a diverse economic structure, instead of being dependent on one factor only, such as tourism. It should have sizeable population in the city core, and be the centre of an urban agglomeration. Proposals for 2006 On June 14, 2006, a report analyzing the candidacy of four cities was presented to, and considered by city council. Four cities were discussed: * Lisbon was deemed to meet most of the criteria for a relationship, but was ultimately rejected because of Toronto's numerous relationships in the region, citing that \\"adding one more European city to an already unbalanced international portfolio is not recommended\\". The report noted that Lisbon and Toronto have very strong community and business relationships, as well as Toronto having a significant Portuguese population. * Manila was rejected because it already has a relationship with another Canadian city, and also because Toronto has a relationship with a city in that region * Monte Carlo was rejected because it does not have a diverse economy, being dependent on tourism, and because it does not match demographically with Toronto * Montego Bay was rejected for lack of compatibility both demographically and economically with Toronto; the report noted the strong presence of Jamaican culture in Toronto, and its lack of relationship with cities from the Caribbean Former partnerships * Amsterdam, Netherlands * Wuxi, China * New York City, New York, United States * Indianapolis, Indiana, United States * S√£o Paulo, Brazil References Sister cities Toronto Sister cities ","title":"Sister cities of Toronto"},{"id":"4436091","text":"Blitz is a Portuguese media brand that focus on popular music and pop culture, based in Pa√ßo de Arcos.

Description Like several stations in central Dublin, it is elevated above street level, with steps leading down to Barrow Street in South Lotts, beside Google's European headquarters. The ticket office is open between 06:00-00:00, Monday to Sunday. The station has three platforms. Platform 1 is a former terminal platform, which became the Northbound main line on 18 July 2016. Platform 2 is the terminal platform for South Western Commuter trains to Newbridge. Platform 3 is the Southbound main line platform. Platforms 1 and 2 are accessed by a footbridge and platform 3 has level access. History Grand Canal Dock was built on the site of a former locomotive shed at Canal Street, across from the engineering works of the Dublin & Kingstown Railway, which were in use between 1834 and 1925. This station was opened on 23 January 2001. Grand Canal Dock was Dublin's newest station until Docklands Station opened in March 2007. Between November 2014 and July 2016, the station underwent a major refurbishment to prepare it to serve South Western Commuter trains to Newbridge, which commenced operations on 21 November 2016. Irish Rail rebuilt platform 1, resurfaced the other platforms, installed new destination displays, and provided a new evacuation bridge. Platform 1 lacked overhead electric cables and had a permanent sign reading \\"Do not board any trains at platform 1\\" that was removed in May 2015. Platform 1 was fitted with overhead cables in November 2015. Irish Rail also added a centre road terminating turn-back facility to accommodate southbound trains. The refurbishment of the station itself was completed in May 2015, although major resignalling and track work took place for one more year. City Centre Resignalling The new signalling was commissioned, along with platform 1, on 17 July 2016. The completion of the Irish Rail City Centre resignalling project has provided for *An increase in the number of Northern and Maynooth line suburban trains stopping at Grand Canal Dock *Trains from Newbridge terminating at Grand Canal Dock This has been made possible by making available all three platforms at Grand Canal Dock and increasing the ability of the signalling system in the city centre to operate 20 trains per hour in both directions instead of 8.

The immediate popularity of the ride led SeaWorld Orlando and three other amusement parks to announce plans to install Floorless Coasters in 2000; aside from the announcement of Kraken on May 6, 1999, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom announced Medusa, Geauga Lake announced Dominator, and Six Flags Fiesta Texas announced Superman: Krypton Coaster. Kraken was announced as costing approximately $18‚Äì20 million. Krakens announcement more than one year out from its opening was an attempt by the park to drive international attendance. Construction for the ride was well underway in January 2000. During construction, Superior Rigging & Erection was responsible for erecting the supports and track of the roller coaster. On June 1, 2000, Kraken officially opened to the public. At the time of opening Kraken held the record for the tallest and longest roller coaster in the state of Florida. It held this record until 2006 when Disney's Animal Kingdom opened the Expedition Everest.  Kraken Unleashed (2017‚Äì2018)  On September 27, 2016, the park announced that the ride would undergo extensive refurbishment and reopen in 2017 with virtual reality headsets. It reopened as Kraken Unleashed on June 16, 2017. In early 2018, the virtual reality headsets were removed from the attraction‚Äôs ride vehicles and the ride went back to being Kraken due to technical difficulties. They returned to the ride in June 2018. Later that summer, the virtual reality was permanently removed due to slow dispatches and excessive wait times. Characteristics=Statistics The Kraken stands tall. With a top speed of , the ride was the fastest roller coaster at SeaWorld Orlando until the opening of Mako in summer 2016. The ride features seven inversions including two vertical loops, a dive loop, a spiraling camelback (zero-g roll), a cobra roll and a flat spin (corkscrew). Trains One of Krakens trains descending the first drop Kraken Unleashed operates with three floorless trains. Each train seats 32 riders in eight rows of four. This gives the ride a theoretical hourly capacity of 1500 riders per hour. The open-air trains feature seats which leave riders' legs dangling above the track. Riders are restrained with over-the-shoulder restraints. As the trains are floorless, the station has a retractable floor for safe boarding. Theme Kraken Unleashed is themed after the mythological sea monster of the same name, kept caged by Poseidon. Much of the ride is located above water, with three sections featuring subterranean dives. The ride's station and surrounding area are themed as Kraken's lair. Eels are said to be Kraken's young and therefore feature throughout the ride's queue. A SeaWorld Orlando spokesman stated \\"although it's a roller coaster, the theme of the ride brings it back to the sea, and to our (SeaWorld Orlando's) core\\". Ride experience After riders have boarded, the station floor is retracted and the front gates open. Kraken Unleashed departs with a right U-turn out of the station. This leads directly to the chain lift hill. At the top, the train crests the lift hill and follows a fairly level turn to the right before dropping towards the ground. The ride then enters the first 128-foot-tall (39m) vertical loop followed by a diving loop, passing by Mako's lift hill. A spiraling camelback (zero-g roll), where riders experience a feeling of weightlessness, is followed by a cobra roll. A banked turn to the left leads into the mid-course brake run. The exit from the mid-course brake run drops down directly into the second vertical loop. A subterranean dive into Kraken's lair is followed by a corkscrew. The ride concludes with a final brake run and a short path back to the station. An overview of Kraken in 2007, showing the ride as it looked prior to Mako's construction on the opposite side of the lake Reception The Orlando Sentinel commended the ride for \\"perfect timing and keeping folks guessing\\", giving the ride ratings of 4 out of 5 for both thrill and theming. Sentinel reporter Dewayne Bevil ranks the ride at number 7 in his Top 50 Orlando Theme Park Attractions list. Although it was reported that the ride would be more exciting than The Incredible Hulk at the nearby Islands of Adventure theme park, Mike Thomas of the Sentinel concluded that \\"Hulk clobbers the competition\\", with Kraken taking the number two spot. In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Jerry Dane of the Florida Coaster Club described the floorless experience like \\"you are hung out there open and free\\". Dane also commended the ride's ability to provide different, yet equally good experiences in a variety of seats. In 2012, Kraken was featured on the Travel Channel TV series Insane Coaster Wars, and received first place in the public-voted \\"Wrong Way Up\\" category. Theme Park Review's Robb Alvey shared the view that Kraken was better than the competition which included Dollywood's Wild Eagle and Dorney Park's Hydra the Revenge. In Amusement Today's annual Golden Ticket Awards, Kraken was ranked in the top 50 steel roller coasters numerous times since its opening. It debuted on the poll at position 48 in 2003, peaked at position 26 in 2005, before it off the poll in 2009. Early reception to Kraken Unleashed was mixed, with theme park enthusiasts noting long dispatch times as the main detractor. Overall VR experience seemed to be positive, however.

The site was established as a California state park in 1951. Natural history Malibu Lagoon is an estuary at the mouth of Malibu Creek at the Pacific Ocean in Malibu. It is being restored by a multiagency partnership. Migratory birds use the lagoon when on the Pacific Flyway. Snowy Plovers nest on the beach. Surfing Malibu Lagoon is a famous right-break that had a big impact on the surfing culture in Southern California in the 1960s. Located near the Malibu Pier, it is among the most popular surf spots in Los Angeles County. The shoreline is usually triple-cornered due to the buildup of silt, sand, and cobble at the mouth of the creek. The tapering, smooth-breaking waves are recognized among surfers worldwide as the gold standard for summertime \\"point\\" surf. Malibu Lagoon has three primary surfing areas. First Point has waves popular with longboarders and shortboarders during bigger swells. Second Point is used for high performance surfing. It has a main takeoff that lines up and connects into the inside called the \\"kiddie bowl\\". Third Point has a left and right side. On the south swells most common in late August and September, surfers can ride all the way to the pier.

A yellow solid, it is a coordination polymer. It was the first palladium compound isolated in pure form. In his attempts to produce pure platinum metal in 1804, W.H. Wollaston added mercuric cyanide to a solution of impure platinum metal in aqua regia. This precipitated palladium cyanide which was then ignited to recover palladium metal‚Äîa new element.  Structure  Structure of \\"Pd(CN)2\\", which consists of 2-dimensional nanosheets terminated with water and cyanide. It had long been suspected that the structure of palladium cyanide consists of square planar Pd(II) centers linked by bridging cyanide ligands, which are bonded through both the carbon and nitrogen atoms. The CN stretch in the infrared spectra of Pd(CN)2, at 2222 cm‚àí1, is typical of bridging cyanide ions. It is now known that the compound commonly known as \\"palladium(II) cyanide\\" is in fact a nanocrystaline material better described using the formula Pd(CN)2.0.29H2O. The interior of the sheets do indeed consist of square-planar palladium ions linked by head-to-tail disordered bridging cyanide groups to form 4,4-nets. These sheets are approximately 3 nm x 3 nm in size and are terminated by an equal number of water and cyanide groups maintaining the charge neutrality of the sheets. These sheets then stack with very little long range order resulting in Bragg diffraction patterns with very broad peaks. The Pd-C and Pd-N bond lengths, determined using total neutron diffraction, are both 1.98 √Ö.  Properties and reactions  Palladium dicyanide is insoluble in water with a solubility product of log Ksp = -42. The equilibrium constant for the competition reaction :PdL2+ \\\\+ 4CN‚àí [Pd(CN)4]2‚àí \\\\+ L, L = 1,4,8,11-tetraazaundecane (2,3,2-tet)The tetramine 2,3,2-tet, H2N(CH2)2NH(CH2)3NH(CH2)2NH2, is similar to triethylenetetramine (2,2,2-tet) but has an additional methylene group between the two central nitrogen atoms was found to have a value of log K = 14.5. Combination with the formation of the palladium complex with the tetradentate ligand :[Pd(H2O)4]2+ \\\\+ L PdL2+ \\\\+ 4 H2O, log K = 47.9 gives :[Pd(H2O)4]2+ \\\\+ 4CN‚àí [Pd(CN)4]2‚àí \\\\+ 4H2O, log Œ≤4 = 62.3. This appears to be the highest formation constant known for any metal ion. The affinity of Pd(II) for cyanide is so great that palladium metal is attacked by cyanide solutions: :Pd(s) + 2 H+ \\\\+ 4 CN‚àí [Pd(CN)4]2‚àí \\\\+ H2 This reaction is reminiscent of the ‚Äúcyanide process‚Äù for the extraction of gold, although in the latter reaction O2 is proposed to be involved, to give H2O. Exchange of between free cyanide ion and [Pd(CN)4]2‚àí has been evaluated by 13C NMR spectroscopy. That exchange occurs at all illustrates the ability of some compounds to be labile (fast reactions) but also stable (high formation constants). The reaction rate is described as follows: ::rate = k2[M(CN)42‚àí][CN‚àí], where k2 120 M‚àí1‚àís‚àí1 The bimolecular kinetics implicate a so-called associative pathway. The associative mechanism of exchange entails rate-limiting attack of cyanide on [Pd(CN)4]2‚àí, possibly with the intermediacy of a highly reactive pentacoordinate species [Pd(CN)5]3‚àí. By comparison, the rate constant for [Ni(CN)4]2‚àí is > 500,000 M‚àí1‚àís‚àí1, whereas [Pt(CN)4]2‚àíexchanges more slowly at 26 M‚àí1s‚àí1. Such associative reactions are characterized by large negative entropies of activation, in this case: -178 and -143 kJ/(mol¬∑K) for Pd and Pt, respectively. In organic synthesis palladium cyanide is used in the synthesis of olefinic cyanides from olefins. and as a catalyst in the regioselective reaction between cyanotrimethylsilane and oxiranes .

The series is a crossover that ties the Supreme Power universe into the Ultimate Marvel universe and was written by Brian Michael Bendis, J. Michael Straczynski and Jeph Loeb with art by Greg Land. History Ultimate Power signifies the first complete Ultimate Universe crossover, that effectively integrates all current ongoing series and is also the first that spans another already extant Marvel Universe. One notable effect is the absence of the Ultimate incarnation of Nick Fury from his home reality, as he is given over to the custody of the Squadron Supreme in the series finale. This absence is already present in the Ultimate Spider-Man story arc \\"Death of a Goblin\\", where Carol Danvers has taken Fury's place as the commanding officer of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Plot=Issue One The Fantastic Four defeat the Serpent Squad, an all-female supervillain team attempting to infiltrate Project Pegasus at the Devil's Point, Wyoming facility. As the captured Serpent Squad is led away by authorities, one member admonishes Ben as a freak who will die alone, renewing his grief over his irreversible condition and Reed Richards' promises to reverse the transformation that turned him into the Thing. Reed requests funding from S.H.I.E.L.D. to send advanced data retrieval probes into neighboring dimensions for inter-dimensional research and exploration purposes. S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury refuses, not wishing to risk inter-dimensional security solely to potentially cure Ben Grimm. Fury also bans Reed from attempting the project on his own time. Despite Fury's orders, Reed sends five probes into other dimensions, including the N-Zone. Days later, as the team view prototypes for Fantastic Four action figures, the roof of the Baxter Building is ripped open by a massive explosion, heralding the sudden appearance of a group of costumed superheroes, the Squadron Supreme. Issue Two Spider-Man and Kitty Pryde swing through Manhattan when they encounter the smoldering ruins of the Baxter building, atop which the Fantastic Four are battling the Squadron Supreme, who speak only in garbles and cannot fully control their powers. Kitty calls the X-Men for assistance moments before Nick Fury and the Ultimates drop out of the sky, declaring the Squadron Supreme under arrest. The X-Men arrive and enter the full-scale superhuman brawl just as the Squadron Supreme adjust to the new dimension and declare Reed Richards under arrest for his crimes against humanity. They demand that he accompany the Squadron Supreme back to their world, holding up one of the devices Richards sent through the N-Zone, much to Nick Fury's bewilderment. Issue Three In the Supremeverse, the President of the United States is moved to a secure bunker by the Secret Service where he learns that an unknown, rapidly growing organism has overwhelmed much of the Eastern United States. The Squadron Supreme are battling the organism and rescuing civilians when Hyperion discovers that the source of the organism is apparently one of Reed Richard's probes. The Squadron Supreme analyze the device and inadvertently trigger it. A holographic projection appears with an audio greeting from Richards and snapshots of the Fantastic Four and his universe. Hyperion, deducing that Richards knows about the organism, and is responsible for it, immediately organizes an invasion force to apprehend Richards from his own dimension. In the Ultimate Universe, Hyperion demands that Richards return with them to solve the problem and stand trial for crimes against humanity. Reed agrees, despite fierce resistance from Invisible Woman, and disappears with the Supreme Squadron. Nick Fury immediately begins assembling a rescue team from elements of the X-Men, Ultimates, and Fantastic Four. Issue Four The combined forces of S.H.I.E.L.D., the X-Men, the Ultimates, the Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man board a S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier. Thor generates a portal with Mjolnir and traces the signature of the Squadron Supreme towards the Supremeverse. In the Supremeverse, an intense yet distraught Reed busily studies samples of the organism, in the face of mounting pressure from the rising civilian body count and the mocking comments of Dr. Emil Burbank, who asks Reed what it feels like to be compared to Stalin and Hitler. Reed confesses that he knows nothing about the organism or how to stop it. On the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Shadowcat searches for Nick Fury, who isn't responding to his pages. She phases through a wall and overhears Nick Fury converse with an unseen conspirator about how Richards cannot examine any of his probes, hinting that Fury and the unseen conspirator are keeping something from the Ultimates. Fury finally leaves and returns to the Ultimates, unaware that Kitty has been listening to him. Hyperion, floating high above Earth's orbit, observes the helicarrier's arrival and charges in, only to meet a battle-ready Thor. Issue Five Thor and Hyperion collide with a flurry of blows high above Earth while the Ultimate heroes look on from the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier. Nick Fury sends the Invisible Woman and the Human Torch to assist Thor and tip the scales in his favor. Hyperion regains much of his strength and defeats Thor, the Invisible Woman, and the Human Torch, who hurtle through the atmosphere to the Earth below. Aboard the helicarrier, Spider-Man and Captain America grow suspicious of Nick Fury, believing that he conceals his true motives. Back on the ground Reed Richards, being escorted to a more secure location, peeks outside an air vent to notice the Ultimates locked in a titanic battle with the Squadron Supreme. Issue Six The Ultimates engage the Squadron Supreme, each hero fighting counterparts who are startlingly equal to one another. Reed Richards, now aware that his friends are attempting a rescue mission, pleads with Dr. Burbank to speak with them. Burbank is unsympathetic, rendering Reed unconscious with an odorless, colorless gas. In the bowels of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Fury suits up for battle before conferring with the unseen conspirator, outlining his plan to steal the probes and to escape back to the Ultimate universe. Moments later, the conspirator betrays him, knocking him unconscious. S.H.I.E.L.D. guards responding to the sound are likewise dispatched. Spider-Man awakens Fury, and both rush to the bridge to see that Doctor Doom, revealed as the unseen conspirator, has defeated the Squadron Supreme and the Ultimates and is ready to conquer the Supremeverse. Issue Seven Aboard the Helicarrier, Spider-Man confronts Nick Fury about Dr. Doom's involvement in the Supreme Universe. Fury reveals that he recruited Dr. Doom to alter Reed Richards' probes to transmit information to S.H.I.E.L.D. before reporting back to Richards. In the Supremeverse Pentagon, Burbank gloats to an unconscious Richards that the Defense Department approached him to develop a weapon to kill Hyperion. The alien organism raging across the country is the result, with Richards' probes serving as a scapegoat to eliminate the trail to the Defense Department. Reed, previously feigning unconsciousness, takes Burbank hostage and demands Burbank reveal the truth to the world. Aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Fury leads Spider-Man to the hangar of the Helicarrier to reveal his secret weapon, a drugged and unconscious Hulk. In the Pentagon, the X-Men rescue Richards. Before they can escape, the roof disintegrates, leaving Richards and the X-Men staring at Squadron Supreme of Earth-712, who declare that their world too was destroyed; they also demand answers. Issue Eight The Earth-712 Squadron Supreme attacks the Ultimate force, with all sides clearly confused about the presence of more doppelgangers in the Supremeverse. On the street, Thor defeats Hyperion and prepares to rejoin the melee when he is stopped by Dr. Spectrum, who reasons with Thor and asks him to help seek out the truth behind the entire affair. Dr. Doom defeats Iron Man and is attacked by the Thing, who rips Doom apart and reveals him as a Doombot. As Squadron Supreme 31916 attacks Squadron Supreme 712, Nighthawk 712 approaches Captain America, mistaking him for the Captain America of Earth-616. Scarlet Witch reveals that her powers have resulted in this unusual doppelganger phenomenon. On the Helicarrier, Nick Fury orders Spider-Man to oversee the Hulk and act as his \\"conscience\\" as Hulk leaps into the fray. Issue Nine The Hulk battles both Squadrons Supreme and the Ultimates heroes and begins overwhelming them all. With their combined powers, the Squadrons and the Ultimates narrowly manage to subdue the Hulk before he is knocked unconscious by the Thing. Both Arcannas succeed in helping the Scarlet Witch return the Earth-712 heroes to their own universe. Nick Fury and Emil Burbank are taken prisoner by the Squadron, both identified as responsible for the worldwide disaster in the Supremeverse. Doctor Doom, the third co-conspirator who escapes apprehension, is promised to the Squadron Supreme when the Ultimates capture him. To ensure their full cooperation, Zarda volunteers to travel to the Ultimate Universe to ensure their compliance. Back in the Ultimate Universe, Captain America discusses the considerable power of Scarlet Witch's abilities and mentions that Carol Danvers is in the front-running to become the new leader of S.H.I.E.L.D. Back at the Baxter Building, the Thing attempts to come to terms with his permanent condition, but takes solace in being able to defeat the Hulk.

He performed influential research in both clinical and social aspects of sexology, as well as drug use. He spent the majority of his career as a professor, practicing psychotherapist, and research scientist at the University of California, San Diego.  Early Life  Mattison was born in Brooklyn, NY. He graduated from Xaverian High School in 1966 and got his Bachelor's Degree in English Literature at Fairfield University. He graduated with a Master's in social work, from the Stony Brook University in New York. He received his Ph.D. from United States International University (now Alliant International University) in 1975, with the dissertation Onset of Erectile Dysfunction in Diabetic Males. His best-known book was The Male Couple: How Relationships Develop, coauthored with his partner David McWhirter (March 29, 1932 - July 28, 2006). The book argued that gay male relationships have particular tendencies distinct from other categories of sexual relationships, an innovative thesis that encouraged the growth of a new field, homosexuality studies. However, the book was also used by anti-gay marriage activists in legal arguments, because it does not use heterosexuality as a model for understanding homosexuality.  Career  Mattison later began studying the use of party drugs by gay men, a controversial subject, which eventually led to a more thorough investigation of drug use in general. In 2000 he cofounded the University of California Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, of which he was co-director until his death. He died of stomach cancer at the age of 57.

NFL career=San Francisco 49ers Wright was signed by the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent on April 26, 2004. In the preseason, Wright was run down and tackled by Brock Lesnar, better known for his wrestling career. He was released as a part of the team's roster cuts to get down to 53 for the regular season. Atlanta Falcons He was signed by the Atlanta Falcons and signed to its practice squad on September 7, 2004, before being elevated to the active roster on December 14, 2004, where he made his NFL debut that week in a game against the Carolina Panthers. He was waived on September 3, 2005. Cleveland Browns He was signed by the Cleveland Browns on September 13, 2005. He was assigned to the practice squad a few times before he saw his first playing time for the team when he had eight carries for nineteen yards and a touchdown in a game against the Tennessee Titans. Wright became the team's starting running back after Reuben Droughns was injured midway through the 2006 NFL season, only to be put on injured reserve himself that December following an injury. On February 20, 2007, he signed a contract extension with the team through the 2008 NFL season.

This employment contract, available solely to employees under 26, would have made it easier for the employer to fire employees by removing the need to provide reasons for dismissal for an initial \\"trial period\\" of two years, in exchange for some financial guarantees for employees, the intention being to make employers less reluctant to hire additional staff. However, the enactment of this amendment to the so-called \\"Equality of Opportunity Act\\" (loi sur l'√©galit√© des chances) establishing this contract was so unpopular that soon massive protests were held, mostly by young students, and the government rescinded the amendment. Actually, President Jacques Chirac declared that the law would be put on the statute book, but that it would not be applied. Article 8 of the 31 March 2006 Equality of Opportunity Act, establishing the CPE, was repealed by a 21 April 2006 law on the Access of Youth to Professional Life in Firms. The rest of the Equality of Opportunity Act, whose dispositions were also contested by the students' protests, was maintained. Legislative process CPE was introduced by the Government as an amendment (n¬∞3) to the \\"Statute on the Equality of Opportunities\\" law. This law was proposed by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin allegedly to tackle a 23% unemployment rate among the young, and also as a response to the civil unrest in October 2005. The reasoning of the government for introducing CPE was that unemployment was one of the major causes of lawlessness in poorer neighbourhoods, that workforce laws putting the burden of proof for valid reasons for dismissal on the employer discouraged hiring, especially of people with \\"risky\\" profiles, and thus that making dismissal easier would improve the employment prospects of such youngsters. The bill was examined by the French National Assembly between 31 January and 9 February. The amendment was adopted by the Assembly around 2 AM on 9 February 2006, after much heated debate. On the same day, in the afternoon, Prime Minister de Villepin announced to the National Assembly that he invoked article 49-3 of the Constitution of France on that text; this meant that the law would be considered adopted in its current state, without being approved by the National Assembly, unless a motion of censure were adopted by the Assembly. Since Villepin's UMP party had an absolute majority in the Assembly, there was no chance that such a motion could be adopted. Predictably, a motion of censure was proposed by the left-wing opposition and was rejected by the Assembly on 21 February. The Law was then examined by the Senate between 23 February and 5 March, at which date the Senate approved it. Since the texts from the Assembly and the Senate were different, and the law was deemed urgent by the Prime Minister, the bill was sent before a mixed Assembly/Senate commission charged with the drafting of a compromise text. The law was then adopted on 8 March by the Assembly, and on 9 March by the Senate. Because opposition members of the Assembly and the Senate requested constitutional review of the text, the law was sent before the Constitutional Council. The Council considered the law constitutional, but made a number of reservations, on 30 March. Those reservations impose guidelines under which the law was to be applied. Meanwhile, the law was disapproved by a sizable proportion of the French population. Massive street protests began, mostly by students from high schools and universities, and Prime Minister de Villepin's approval rate began to plummet. The protest movement was certainly the biggest seen in France since 1968. The whole act was signed into law on 31 March by president Jacques Chirac. However, Chirac paradoxically asked for a delay of application of the law (which he is not constitutionally empowered to do), to allow the conservative Union for a Popular Majority (UMP) to prepare a new law modifying the \\"Statute on the Equality of Opportunities\\" law (changing, in particular, the two years \\"probationary period\\" to only one year). The student movement as well as all trade unions (including the CGT) and the Socialist Party asked not only for the suppression of the CPE but also of the CNE, a similar contract passed in November 2005 by the same government. On 10 April, as the protests were still getting bigger, the government completely withdrew the law, and substituted for it fiscal incentives to firms employing young people. Controversy The CPE sparked debates among the political classes, and drew massive protests from students in the streets of France, along with sudden strikes. Criticism was levied at both the substance of the CPE and the way it was enacted. Instead of putting the clauses creating CPE inside the bill it was proposing to Parliament, the government chose to submit it as an amendment of its own text. This bypasses some compulsory legal review by the Conseil d'√âtat and reduces the time available for examination by members of the Parliament. Earlier in 2006, president of the Assembly Jean-Louis Debr√©, though a fellow member of UMP and an ally of Villepin, complained about the Villepin government submitting lengthy amendments of its own bills and said that it showed these bills were badly prepared. Furthermore, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin forced approval of the law by the Assembly on its first reading by invoking article 49-3 of the Constitution: under 49-3, a bill is considered approved in its present state by the Assembly unless the Assembly chooses to dismiss the Prime Minister. Such a move hardly ever occurs, since both the Assembly and the Prime Minister are from the same majority. Use of 49-3 is seen as an infringement on the legislative prerogatives of Parliament and is thus reserved for exceptional cases. As many have pointed out, especially when the Prime Minister announced the use of 49-3, Dominique de Villepin has never run for elected office. Although the CPE is the primary target of the student movement against the law, other measures of the \\"Statute on the Equality of Opportunities\\" have also been contested. Among them, allowing apprenticeships from as young as 14 years old (allowing a youth to leave the standard public education system), night work from the age of 15 (instead of 16 now) and suspension of certain type of welfare measures (families with more than three children have the right to some governmental financial support in France) when students skip school. This last measure has been for a long time in the program of the far-right movement Front National, thus also explaining part of the popular protests. The most controversial part of this new law lies in the way it brings flexibility to employers: this contract allows French employers to fire workers under the age of 26 without juridical motive during the first two years of the contract, among other things. If the employee seeks juridical recourse against arbitrary firing, the burden of proof would be reversed. In an indefinite contract, the burden of proof was reversed during the probationary period, which lasted from just a few days to three months, depending on the type of job, requiring an employee seeking legal recourse to prove they were unjustly fired rather than the employer to prove just cause for the dismissal. Supporters The CPE was officially designed to encourage employers to hire more employees under 26 by offering tax cuts and flexibility to employers, and was expected to offer young people access the job market that they have been desperately missing previously (One in four young people in France is unemployed, but the figure rises to 50% in the poor suburbs.) Unlike in more conservative employment environments, such as those of the US or the UK, firing an employee under long-term contract is made hard for French employers once the probation period (maximum three months) elapses. \\"Firing people is difficult and costly, this has made firms over the years more and more reluctant to take people on\\" The purported aim of the CPE law was to break this reluctance. Supporters of the CPE believe it will reduce the high unemployment, particularly among poor youths. Employers, they contend, will be more willing to take chances with young employees if they are not constrained by France's job security laws. They claim that unemployment is partially caused by the restrictive labor laws which they believe have also helped keep economic growth at a low level by discouraging business foundation and expansion. Softening the \\"rigid employment code\\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/23/news/manage.php has been the motto of MEDEF and employers in general for years, and is claimed by French liberals (those supporting free-market policies) to be a key way to help both economic growth and employment. Supporters of the CPE and opponents of the blockading of the universities called demonstrations in the streets in March and April. These demonstrations of support from the government only mustered hundreds, while the anti-government protests got millions. Critics Critics of the law included all trade unions (evincing a rarely found unanimity between the various politically oriented unions CGT, CFDT, FO, CFTC, CGC-CGE etc.), many students (for example the students' union UNEF), all the left-wing political parties, and to a lesser extent some centrist opponents, such as the moderately conservative Union for French Democracy (UDF), saying that the CPE would make it easier for employers to exert pressure on employees (lowering wages, sexual harassment, etc.) since they could dismiss their younger employees at any time, without any judicially contestable reason. Some opponents dubbed it the \\"Kleenex contract\\", implying that the CPE would allow employers to discard young people like facial tissue. According to them, the law will only encourage the growth of the working poor and the precarity phenomena, and violates a requirement of French labor law introduced in 1973, as well as article 24 of the European social charter, which states that the employer must provide a motive for dismissal of employees. Sixty socialist deputies and sixty socialist senators appealed against the law to the Constitutional Council; see below. Protests The law has met heavy resistance from students, trade unions, and left-wing activists, sparking protests in February and March 2006 (and continuing into April) with hundreds of thousands of participants in over 180 cities and towns across France. On 18 March, up to as many as 1.5 million demonstrated across France, over half of the country's 84 public universities were closed because of student blockades, and Bernard Thibault, the leader of the CGT, one of France's five major labour unions, suggested that a general strike across the country would occur if the law was not repealed. A big march was prepared for 4 April, while students' organizations had already called for a general strike. In the biggest student movement since 1968, mass meetings were held in many universities (In Toulouse over 4,000 students occupied the rugby stadium to hold their meeting). Motorways were blockaded and employers organisations offices were occupied. The actions were (unusually) supported by all of the main trade union federations and all the Left political parties (more or less enthusiastically). The protests spread to high schools, and involved large numbers of young people both from prestigious universities, and from technical high schools and other places of education drawing a mainly working class student body. Demonstration against CPE, 18 March 2006, Paris Strikes Amid calls for a general strike, opponents agreed to a 'day of action' against the law, including strikes, demonstrations and university occupations across France on 28 March to oppose the law. Strikes disrupted transport, public education and mail services while more than one million to three million marched against the law. The estimates vary; the police estimate in the lower one million range while the unions estimate much higher.In France, systematized revolt  csmonitor.comThe Guardian On 4 April, between 93,000 (police estimate) and 700,000 (union estimate) demonstrated in Paris and three million in all of France. Official response On 21 March, the Prime Minister refused to change tack, saying that \\"with this law, there are three things which are impossible. The first is its withdrawal, because that would mean that we are surrendering to the logic of ultimatums and prerequisites. This is obviously what our electorate does not want, and they would not forgive us for it. The second is its suspension, quite simply because that is against our Constitution. And the third is reworking the bill, because if it loses its balance, any chance for success would be deprived.\\" Le Monde article On 30 March, the Constitutional Council, the highest constitutional authority, validated most of the law, along with its 8th article instituting the First Employment Contract. The law was considered to abide by the Constitution of France; the Constitutional Council didn't pronounce on the question of conformity to international and European law, which it is not empowered to consider. The Socialist deputies and senators who had deposed the legal recourse before the Constitutional Council notably claimed that the law was superseded by article 24 of the European social charter, which states that the employer must give a juridical motive before firing an employee, and against the International Labour Convention (n¬∞158). Labor courts would have to create jurisprudence concerning this point. Lib√©ration Decision of the Constitutional Council On the evening of 31 March, President Chirac announced in an address to the nation that he would promulgate the law, but asked the government at the same time to prepare a new law including two modifications: the trial period would be reduced to one year, and employers would now have to give a reason for the dismissal of the employment. However, Chirac did not specify whether this reason would be a juridical motive or a simple letter without any juridical value. He also asked employers not to start using the contract until these modifications came into force, but suggested no means of enforcement. Chirac's paradoxical call (officially promulgating the law while unofficially asking at the same time for its suspension) has only baffled both partisans and opponents of the text. The president's move was widely analyzed by the press as support for his prime minister Dominique de Villepin against his 2007 election rival, Nicolas Sarkozy, who was the leader of Chirac's political party, the UMP. Villepin had declared that he would have resigned had Chirac refused to promulgate the law. Some 2,000 students were waiting on the Place de la Bastille for Chirac's address to the nation. After hearing it, they carried out a night demonstration, which collected as many as 6,000 persons between the H√¥tel de Ville and the Op√©ra. A few hundred demonstrators continued until four in the morning. Substitution On 10 April, the French government decided to withdraw the CPE and rewrite it by introducing new measures. This decision appears to be an about-face for Dominique de Villepin.

It was first released as an Xbox exclusive before later being ported to Microsoft Windows, both in 2003. The Xbox version was released in North America in later 2004, while the PC version was released in North America as Aerial Strike: Low Altitude - High Stakes: The Yager Missions in February 2005. In this game, gamers take on the role of Magnus Tide, a freelance pilot adventurer. Yager and Aerial Strike is set over 20 levels in which the player takes possession of various weapons and ships in an effort to accomplish each mission. The game, while well-received critically, was not a commercial success, largely in part due to a delayed North American release amidst a lack of advertising. Gameplay Yager is set in a futuristic world where countries borders no longer exist and the earth is controlled by a number of mega corporations, most notably DST, as well as Proteus and Lobos Robotics. Although the old countries officially do not exist there are tell tale signs identifying each environment. The Proteus Islands are a tropical paradise and the headquarters of the Proteus Corporation. The Free Trade Zone, a landscape dotted with turbines and palm trees, is the only zone not controlled by any corporation. The DST zone and surrounding fjords are connected to the Free Trade Zone by a system of caves, rivers, and deltas that run deep into DST territory. Bitterfeld is a desolate area littered with disused industrial buildings, crashed ships, abandoned machinery and other debris left behind by the old Progress Company. Reception Yager and Aerial Strike received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

A Janousek coxed four used by University College Boat Club at Henley Royal Regatta 2001. The boats are made of a honeycomb-sandwich laminate that is heat-cured at high temperatures, producing stronger shells than the more traditional cold-curing method of construction. Janousek was one of the first rowing boat makers in the world to offer this method of rowing boat construction. Janousek manufacture singles, doubles, coxless pairs, coxless fours and quads (in one of three hull shapes), bow and stern-coxed fours and quads (in one of two hull shapes), and sectional eights. They offer a wide range of boats designed for different average crew weights. Janousek boats are a very popular choice of club boat in Britain due to their relatively low price and the company's high production capacity, they are also more durable compared with other makes of racing shells. The Janousek company also owns St√§mpfli Racing Boats, another manufacturer of rowing boats which was acquired in 1991. Janousek boats have been used at all levels of competition including World Rowing Championships with the British men's heavyweight coxed four using a Janousek in the 1983 World Rowing Championships and Italy using one for their lightweight coxless four Gold medal winning crew of 1982.

It operated from 1962 to 1994.CKLM history at Canadian Communications Foundation The station broadcast on 1570 kHz with a power of 50,000 watts full-time as a class B station, using a directional antenna with different patterns day and night (the nighttime pattern being significantly tighter). While the station's signal was not particularly impressive from a strictly local point of view, the station was received by many DXers in Europe and was considered there as one of the \\"easy\\" targets for Transatlantic DX. CKLM originally began with a variety format and identified itself as \\"the only unilingual French station in the world\\", referring to the fact that it only played French-language music (unlike most other French-language stations which played a significant amount of English-language music). It quickly became identified as a strongly nationalist station. Late in 1967, the station feared that it would lose its licence, after it had broadcast special programming describing the July 1967 visit of French president Charles De Gaulle in Quebec, in which he made his extremely controversial \\"Vive le Qu√©bec libre !\\" statement. Because of these fears (radio broadcasting is a federal jurisdiction in Canada), the station changed its format to Top 40 (including English-language hits). CKLM moved from Montreal to Laval in 1976 over the objections of CFGL-FM, which was already operating in that city. That station actually bought CKLM a few years later, but sold it in 1983 to new investors. The station then suffered from heavy financial difficulties, as listeners deserted the station in droves. In April 1994, the company which held CKLM's licence (CKLM Radio Laval-Montr√©al Inc., controlled by G√©rard Brunet), went bankrupt and all assets were transferred to a guaranteed creditor (2754363 Canada Inc.). That company rented the station to R√©seau RadioCom Inc., a company operated by Ren√© Bourdelais which was already operating the station since January 1, 1994. All of this posed a problem as such changes legally have to be approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), and no approval was sought by any of these companies. On July 15, 1994, the CRTC determined that there were too many irregularities going on, and it ordered CKLM to go off the air by July 17. CKLM initially ignored that order, but early on July 20, 1994, the station's transmitter was apparently hit by lightning and CKLM went off the air.Daniel Lemay. \\"CKLM 1570 a quitt√© les ondes\\", La Presse, July 22, 1994.\\"En bref...

He published previously unedited works by Saint John Chrysostom. Life He was born at Marmande, made his preliminary studies in the Jesuit College at Bordeaux, and joined the Dominican Order in 1624. After finishing his theological course, he became professor of theology, and taught in several houses of his order. In 1640 he was transferred to Paris where he undertook the publication of patristic texts. He remained there until his death. Works He published successively the works of Amphilochius of Iconium, of Methodius of Olympus, and of Andrew of Crete, together with some writings of John Chrysostom not yet in print. In 1648 appeared his Novum Auctarium Graeco-Latinae Bibliothecae Patrum in two parts, exegitical and historico-dogmatic. The \\"Historia haeresis monothelitarum sanctaeque in eam sextae synodi actorum vindiciae\\", which formed part of the historical section of this work, met with much opposition in Rome, principally because it was at variance with the opinions of Bellarmine and Baronius. In an assembly of the French bishops held in Paris, 1655, an annual subsidy was voted to enable him to carry on his publications, the sum voted being subsequently doubled. In 1656 he edited St. John Chrysostom's \\"De educandis Liberis\\", in 1660 a collection of Acts of the martyrs. In 1662 there appeared the \\"Bibliotheca Patrum Concionatoria\\", or \\"Preachers' Library of the Fathers\\", a rich and comprehensive work, prepared in a painstaking manner from all the available manuscripts, and containing a short historical account of all the authors whose names appeared in the work. Another important work, \\"Auctarium Novissimum Bibliothecae Patrum\\", appeared at Paris in 1672. The three following years saw many publications from the pen of Combefis. In 1674 appeared \\"Ecclesiastes Graecus, i.e. illustrium Graecorum Patrum ac oratorum digesti sermones ac tractatus\\", etc. In 1675 appeared \\"Theodoti Ancyrani adv. Nestorium liber et S. Germani patriarchae Constantinop. in S. Mariae Dormitionem et Translationem oratio historica\\", and in the same year an edition of the works of Maximus Confessor in two volumes with a Latin translation. A third volume of the works of Maximus Confessor was ready when Combefis died. Perhaps the most important of the works of Combefis is his edition of St. Basil in two volumes, \\"Basilius magnus ex integro recensitus, textus ex fide optimorum codicum ubique castigatus, auctus, illustratus, haud incerta quandoque coniectura emendatus. Versiones recognitae\\", etc. (Paris, 1679). This shows the critical skill of Combefis at its best, though it was later surpassed by the Maurist edition (Paris, 1721‚Äì30). Besides these and several other critical editions of works of the Fathers, there were some polemical works of Combefis.

In contrast to the Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout (FF), the center of mass of the engine is behind the front axle. This layout is typically chosen for its better weight distribution (the heaviest component is near the center of the car, lowering its moment of inertia). Since the differences between the FF and MF layouts are minor, most people consider the MF layout to be the same as the FF layout. Renault 4 rolling chassis However, the mid-engined layout uses up central space, making the resulting vehicle rather long. This may be why no manufacturer currently offers the MF layout. Examples of road cars using the MF layout include the Acura Vigor, Cord 810, BSA Scout, Citro√´n Traction Avant, Citro√´n DS, Renault 4 (and derivatives R5 and R6), Renault 16, Saab 900 Saab Sonett mk1, and the Citro√´n SM, also some commercial vehicles like the Tempo Matador. These vehicles have longitudinal mounted engines; transverse engined vehicles are possible in theory if the issue of passenger footwell location is addressed. The Toyota iQ comes close to this by having its front differential in front of the engine, however despite this, the iQ is still considered to have an FF layout. Traditionally, the term mid-engine has been reserved for cars that place the engine and transaxle behind the driver and in front of the rear axles , as in the Lamborghini Countach or Ferrari Testarossa, but an engine placed in front of the driver's compartment but fully behind the front axle line also qualifies as mid-engine.

The village lies in the R√∏ldal valley along the Storelva river on the north end of the lake R√∏ldalsvatnet. R√∏ldal is located about southeast of the town of Odda. R√∏ldal was formerly part of the independent municipality of R√∏ldal from 1838 until 1964 when it became a part of Odda municipality. Then in 2020, it became part of Ullensvang. The 13th-century R√∏ldal Stave Church is located here. The village is located at the junction of the European route E134 highway and the Norwegian National Road 13. The E134 highway follows a historic route that connects Eastern and Western Norway, passing right through R√∏ldal. It is located near the borders of three counties: Hordaland, Rogaland (to the south), and Telemark (to the east). The village has a population (2019) of 353 and a population density of . People from this area use the demonym r√∏ld√∏l for themselves, others who live outside of R√∏ldal generally use the term r√∏ld√∏ling. History Due to its location near the border of three counties, the parish of R√∏ldal has been part of three different dioceses over the centuries. It originally belonged to the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin, but it was transferred to the (new) Diocese of Stavanger in 1125. In 1684, it became a part of the (new) Diocese of Kristiansand. R√∏ldal was finally transferred back to the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin in 1864. Historically, the R√∏ldal area was part of the parish of Suldal (to the south), with R√∏ldal being an annex to the main parish. Suldal and R√∏ldal each had their own churches, but they shared a priest since R√∏ldal was a sparsely populated area and could not support their own priest. Suldal was located in Stavanger county and R√∏ldal was located in S√∏ndre Bergenhus county. In 1838, R√∏ldal became a its own municipality which existed until 1964 when it was merged into Ullensvang. Attractions Tourists visit R√∏ldal for a number of reasons. The centuries-old R√∏ldal Stave Church is a preserved museum, but it is also a regularly-used church for the village. The R√∏ldal skicenter in the Hordadal valley is famous for receiving the most snowfall of any populated area in Norway. R√∏ldal also is a point for access to the nearby Hardangervidda plateau. Other places of interest include the R√∏ldal Village Museum (showing a traditional local farm), some iron-age burial mounds, and the Kalvatr√¶et Literature House. Name The village is named after the old R√∏ldal farm where the local church (R√∏ldal Stave Church) is located. The farm was probably named after the valley in which it is located. The Old Norse form of the name might have been R≈ìrgudalr. The first element would then be the genitive case of the local rivername R√∏yrga (derived from r√∏yrr which means 'rocky ground') and the last element is dalr which means 'dale' or 'valley'.

The key is put in the array position with the fewer (colliding) keys. Some collision resolution scheme is needed, unless keys are kept in buckets. The average-case cost of a successful search is O(2 + (m‚àí1)/n), where m is the number of keys and n is the size of the array. The most collisions is \\\\log_2 \\\\ln n + \\\\theta(m/n) with high probability.\\" 2008\\\\. (accessed 2016-07-28). How It Works 2-choice hashing utilizes two hash functions h1(x) and h2(x) which work as hash functions are expected to work (i.e. mapping integers from the universe into a specified range). The two hash functions should be independent and have no correlation to each other. Having two hash functions allows any key x to have up to two potential locations to be stored based on the values of the respective outputs, h1(x) and h2(x). It is important to note that, although there are two hash functions, there is only one table; both hash functions map to locations on that table. Implementation The most important functions of the hashing implementation in this case are insertion and search. * Insertion: When inserting the values of both hash functions are computed for the to-be-inserted object. The object is then placed in the bucket which contains fewer objects. If the buckets are equal in size, the default location is the h1(x) value. * Search: Effective searches are done by looking in both buckets (the bucket locations to which h1(x) and h2(x) mapped) for the desired value. Performance As is true with all hash tables, the performance is based on the largest bucket. Although there are instances where bucket sizes happen to be large based on the values and the hash functions used, this is rare. Having two hash functions and, therefore, two possible locations for any one value, makes the possibility of large buckets even more unlikely to happen. The expected bucket size while using 2-choice hashing is: . This improvement is due to the randomized concept known as The Power of Two Choices. Using two hash functions offers substantial benefits over a single hash function. There is little improvement (and no change to the expected order statistics) if more than two hash functions are used: \\"Additional hash functions only decrease the maximum by a constant factor.\\"Paul E. Black, DADS, retrieved 29 January 2015. Some people recommend a type of 2-choice hashing called two-way skewed-associative cache in some CPU caches. \\"Micro- Architecture\\". 2-left hashing--using two hash tables of equal size n/2, and asymmetrically resolving ties by putting the key in the left hash table--has fewer collisions and therefore better performance than 2-choice hashing with one large hash table of size n. 19 December 2012.

Pauken then joined the transition team of President- elect Ronald W. Reagan. Attorney General 1983‚Äì1991 In 1982, Mattox did not seek re-election to his redistricted House seat, but was instead elected statewide to succeed the outgoing attorney general Mark Wells White of Houston, who was elected governor in a stunning upset of incumbent Republican Bill Clements of Dallas. Nineteen eighty-two was the last year in which Texas Democrats swept all statewide races on the ballot. To win the nomination for attorney general, Mattox defeated fellow Democrat Max Sherman, a former state senator and former president of West Texas A&M; University. Mattox then easily defeated the Republican State Senator William C. \\"Bill\\" Meier of Euless in Tarrant County, a former Democrat, who holds the filibuster record‚Äî43 hours‚Äîin the Texas Senate. In 1983, Mattox was indicted for commercial bribery and prosecuted by Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle, a Democrat close to the late Governor Ann Richards. Earle later prosecuted the Republican congressional leader Tom DeLay. Like the DeLay prosecution, the political background of the Mattox prosecution related to an attempt to conceal the delivery of corporate funds to an election campaign. Mattox had received a campaign contribution of $125,000 from his sister Janice, a Dallas lawyer. Janice Mattox in turn had obtained a similar amount from Seafirst Bank in Seattle, which had close ties to Mattox supporter Clinton Manges, a controversial South Texas rancher-oilman who was the successor to George Parr, the corrupt \\"Duke of Duval\\". Manges was co-plaintiff with the state (represented by Mattox) in major litigation against Mobil Oil Company. Mobil had attempted to depose Janice Mattox concerning the Seafirst transaction, which led Mattox to threaten Mobil's law firm, Fulbright & Jaworski, with loss of its tax-exempt bond practice, a power held by the attorney general in Texas. Secretly recorded by the recipient of the threats, Mattox did not deny threatening the law firm, nor did he deny the Seafirst transactions, his defense being based on the legal definition of the crime of \\"commercial bribery.\\" After a long trial, Mattox was acquitted. In 1986, Mattox was narrowly reelected attorney general with 53 percent of the statewide vote; he beat back an unusually strong Republican opponent in San Antonio, lawyer Roy Barrera, Jr., who garnered 45 percent of the vote. In that election, many Hispanic voters supported Mattox, rather than Barrera. As attorney general, Mattox highlighted the state's accelerated efforts to help mothers collect child support from divorced or unwed fathers. His aggressive attacks on alleged wrongdoing by corporations gained him considerable popular support. In 1989, Mattox was inducted into the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame. Challenging Ann Richards, 1990 In 1990, Mattox chose not to seek re- election to a third term as attorney general and sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. He alleged that his principal opponent, outgoing State Treasurer Ann Richards, had used cocaine and was a recovering alcoholic who might falter in handling the strains associated with being governor. Mattox went into a runoff election with Richards because the third contender, former Governor Mark White, polled enough votes to keep both Mattox and Richards from winning an outright majority. Due to publicity exposing Mattox's aggressive tactics used in Corporate attacks to bolster his support, Richards went on to win the nomination and the election, very narrowly, over Republican businessman Clayton Wheat Williams, Jr., of Midland. Failed comeback attempts, 1994 and 1998 In 1994, Mattox ran for the U.S. Senate, but he eventually lost the Democratic nomination to Richard W. Fisher, who had been a Ross Perot operative in the 1992 presidential election. Fisher was also the son-in-law of former Third District Republican Congressman James M. Collins of Dallas. Collins lost the 1982 senatorial general election to Lloyd Bentsen. Fisher was then defeated in the November 1994 general election by the freshman Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. In 1998, Mattox tried to return to the attorney general's position, but lost the general election to Republican John Cornyn, a former member of the Texas Supreme Court. Cornyn polled 2,002,794 votes (54.25 percent) to Mattox's 1,631,045 ballots (44.18 percent). (A third candidate received 1.56 percent.) Cornyn had defeated two other candidates for the Republican nomination as attorney general, outgoing Texas Railroad Commissioner Barry Williamson and Mattox's old rival, Tom Pauken. Cornyn became the first Republican ever elected as attorney general of Texas. Four years later, Cornyn vacated that office to become one of Texas's two U.S. senators. Advocate for Ending the Texas Two-Step Five days before his death, Jim Mattox testified to a Texas Democratic Party Committee on the Party's method of awarding presidential delegates based on a primary vote plus evening caucuses. Mattox said the system, known as the Texas Two-Step, was an embarrassment to the party. \\"Now let me tell you, folks,\\" Mattox said. \\"This system we've got is an expensive system. It's an unintelligible system. It is an acrimonious system across the board. It is subject to misconduct, it is subject to fraud, it is subject to manipulation. It's unfair, it's uncertain, it's inaccurate, and it's an embarrassment to our party.\\" Death In 2008, Mattox worked in Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. He died eight months thereafter at the age of 65 of a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Dripping Springs in Hays County west of Austin. In addition to sister Janice L. Mattox, he was survived by his wife, Marta K. Mattox (born February 26, 1955), and their two children, Jim \\"Jimmer\\" Mattox and Janet \\"Sissi\\" Mattox, and his younger brother, Jerry Mattox (deceased 2016). Chuck McDonald, the Richards spokesman during the 1990 gubernatorial primary described Mattox as \\"the original maverick. He prided himself on being the voice of the little guy and took on every big-money interest group he could find. As a political rival, he was as tough as they came. He never backed down from a fight, and he made all the candidates stronger.\\" Jim Mattox monument at Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas Garry Mauro, the Texas land commissioner from 1983‚Äì1999 who was defeated for governor in 1998 by George W. Bush and who later managed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in Texas, described Mattox as a man \\"pounding on the table for the people. Anybody that thinks of Jim Mattox and doesn't think of the 'people's lawyer' really didn't know him. He never saw a fight he'd walk away from.\\" Mattox's body lay in repose at the Texas House of Representatives chamber inside the Texas Capitol rotunda on Monday, November 24, 2008. Services were held on Tuesday, November 25, 2008 at the First Baptist Church, 901 Trinity Street in Austin. He is interred at the Texas State Cemetery, 909 Navasota Street in Austin.

Using traditional animal documentary style footage along with narration, the series told the story of the Whiskers, one of more than a dozen families of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert being studied as part of the Kalahari Meerkat Project, a long- term field study into the ecological causes and evolutionary consequences of the cooperative nature of meerkats. The original programme was narrated by Bill Nighy, with the narration redubbed by Mike Goldman for the Australian airings and Sean Astin for the American broadcasts. The fourth series, subtitled The Next Generation, saw Stockard Channing replacing Astin as the narrator in the American dubbing. Meerkat Manor premiered in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2005, and the first 13-episode series concluded on 24 October 2005. With the success of the programme in the United Kingdom, Animal Planet started broadcasting it on its national channels in Australia, Canada, and the US. It has since been rebroadcast in more than 160 other countries. The fourth, and final, series aired initially in the United States from 6 June 2008 to 22 August 2008. In August 2009, it was reported that the programme had been cancelled. Although the show faced criticism from viewers for not intervening when a meerkat was injured and faced death, Meerkat Manor enjoyed considerable success and was Animal Planet's top series in October 2007, both on the cable channel and through its video-on-demand service. The show's experimental format broke new ground in animal documentary filming techniques and gave viewers a long-term, intimate look into the lives of its meerkat stars, breaking the traditional wall between viewer and subject found with most documentaries. Meerkat Manor was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards: two in 2007 and one in 2008. It won awards at the 2006 Omni Awards, and at the 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals TV Broadcasting Awards. The first three series have been released to DVD in both Region 1 and Region 2. In 2007, a book entitled Meerkat Manor ‚Äì The Story of Flower of the Kalahari was released in the UK, detailing the life of Flower and the Whiskers before the series' filming began. A television film, Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins, documenting Flower's birth and rise to matriarch of the Whiskers, aired on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008.  Production details  Robin Smith finds himself surrounded by foraging meerkats while filming them Meerkat Manor was created by Caroline Hawkins, executive producer and series editor at Oxford Scientific Films, and commissioned for Animal Planet International by executive producer and commissioning editor Mark Wild. Filming for a 13-episode series took seven to eight months, and was limited to the Kalahari spring and summer seasons, as meerkats are less active during winter. Series three was filmed from November 2006 through April 2007, and Series four began filming in October 2007. Most scenes were filmed on location at the Kuruman River Reserve, where the Kalahari Meerkat Project that the meerkats are a part of is based. However, the meerkats seen in commercials and on the show's website were not the same animals portrayed in Meerkat Manor. Instead, tamer- rescued meerkats from the Fellow Earthlings' Wildlife Center were filmed against a green screen. The show was primarily filmed using Sony DSR-570 cameras, although special equipment was needed for some unique footage. For scenes inside the animals' burrows, mini fibre-optic infra-red cameras were employed; wide-angle shots were filmed with a seven-metre crane and a remote- controlled camera platform. An off-camera wireless microphone was also used to record many meerkat vocalizations, only partially audible to cameras' on-board systems. Most filming was done by a single cameraman and a single sound engineer; researchers have required a minimal human presence to avoid stressing the animals. Eye-level shots were difficult to achieve at times, due to the meerkats' small size and the limited height of even the smallest tripods. For tracking purposes by the researchers, the dominant female of each group is fitted with a radio collar, as are some dominant and roaming males. The meerkats ‚Äì especially younger animals ‚Äì are marked with dye to differentiate them. As the meerkats are habituated, they would tend to ignore the camera crew as long as their \\"personal space\\" was respected.  National variations  The UK and US versions of the show have the same content for most episodes; however, the latter was sometimes edited for length to allow for more commercial breaks. Content was also sometimes altered; mating scenes in particular were often removed from the US version. Animal Planet US occasionally changed the names of meerkats and episode titles. Two of Flower's pups were renamed from Ren and Stumpy to Len and Squiggy; the title of the episode was also changed. De la Soul (named for the rap group of the same name), one of the sisters who started the Starsky group, was renamed Whoopi in the US as a tribute to actress Whoopi Goldberg, an early fan of the series. Animal Planet US has also renamed some of Flower's pups born in season three to honour two other famous fans of the show, Elizabeth Taylor and Denis Leary. Several episodes were renamed: the title of the final episode of the second series was changed from \\"The Killing Fields\\" to \\"The Quiet Fields\\". During the third series, the third episode's title was changed from \\"Something's Got to Give\\" to \\"Sister Act\\" (another Goldberg reference), while the sixth episode's title changed from \\"The House of Zappa\\" to \\"Sibling Rivalry\\".  Narrative  The use of underground cameras allows the crew to capture never before seen footage of a meerkat mother and her pups deep in their burrow. The show follows several groups of meerkats, who act communally for the benefit of the groups in which they live. These groups are typically led by a dominant female and male, who maintain almost exclusive rights to have offspring. The group followed most closely is known as the Whiskers family. This group was chosen because of its matriarch Flower, an unusually successful dominant female who led the group for five years. During series three, Flower died from a snake bite and was succeeded by her daughter Rocket Dog. Animals in neighbouring groups were highlighted in each series as well. In the first series, a group called the Lazuli were shown frequently in competition with the Whiskers family, and the opening credits referred to them as the \\"neighbours from hell\\". Although their dominant male Big Si died between series, the Lazuli appeared in the second series, mostly as a source of roving males. Another group called the Commandoes, led by a one-eyed male named Hannibal, introduced themselves by attacking the Lazuli burrow, killing a pup and badly wounding the babysitting adult. The Commandoes became the new major rivals in the area, killing the pups of evicted Whiskers female Mozart and taking over some of the Whiskers' territory. The Whiskers' new neighbours were the Zappa and the Starsky. Although smaller than the Whiskers, the Zappa attacked frequently, and when they fled after one attack, the Whiskers ‚Äì in a rare occurrence ‚Äì adopted an abandoned Zappa pup. The Starsky group, on the other hand, was no threat to the Whiskers. Formed by a trio of Flower's daughters permanently evicted from the Whiskers, the small group was ravaged by illness, predators, and a lack of new pups. The constantly struggling Starsky succumbed in the penultimate episode, with the death of the last survivor, Mozart, who was killed by a jackal. Former Whiskers female Maybelline broke away from the group at the end of the third series, forming a new group called the Aztecs which became the Whiskers' rivals in the fourth series.  Changes in representation  While the show portrays real events among the Kalahari Meerkats, it also removes repetitive elements of the animals' lives. Because many days are filled with behaviour related to grooming and foraging, these routines were often left out of the show in favour of more unusual events. The meerkats are all named by Kalahari Meerkat volunteers; the individual who first sees a new litter emerge from the burrow is awarded naming rights. This has produced a variety of names, frequently drawn from volunteers' favourite books, movies, musical groups, family and friends, historical figures and geographical locations. Animal Planet sometimes renamed the meerkats for narration, arguing that researchers' names were too limited, often relating to spices and food condiments. Because of these changes, fans of the series who seek information on the Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project website sometimes have trouble locating particular animals. The project has created a list of alterations to help viewers connect the animals on the show to their real-life counterparts, and to match episodes to the monthly KMP Life History reports. The list, however, is only available to paying members of their website. Two of the major Whiskers family rivals were composites, created with footage and blended stories from multiple groups. For example, the Commandoes group on the show uses some of events from the real Commandoes group, but was primarily shown with footage from the Vivian research group ‚Äì including its dominant couple. Similarly, the show's Zappa group was mostly presented using footage from a group called \\"The Young Ones\\" (named after the British television show); however, the actual story and dominant pair were from the real Zappa Group. Axel, the abandoned pup from series three, has a research number that indicates he was probably a Young Ones pup, rather than being a Zappa as the show claims.  Reception  Meerkat Manor has been well received by viewers and critics alike. In October 2007, it was Animal Planet's top series, with an audience of more than four million in the United States alone. In the United States, its first episode was viewed by one million viewers, and the second and third series premieres were watched by approximately 800,000 viewers each. The fourth series premiere did not fare as well, with fewer than 500,000 viewers. The viewership of the on-demand video offerings for Meerkat Manor grew 20% in September 2007, when Discovery offered each third series episode, video capsules of series one and two, top ten moments from the show, and a memorial sequence for Flower. Building on the success of Meerkat Manor's unique format, Animal Planet commissioned two similarly formatted programmes: Orangutan Island, which focuses on a group of orphaned orangutans at the Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilitation Center, and Lemur Street, which looks at the lives of two rival gangs of ring-tailed lemurs in Madagascar. Some fans have criticized the show for its non-interference policy with regard to the meerkats, asking why the film crew and researchers do not give anti- venom to snake-bitten meerkats, or euthanize those dying and suffering. US Executive Producer Mick Kaczorowski pointed out that Meerkat Manor was a show about the real lives and deaths of the meerkats. The research group has a policy against film crews interceding in natural events \\"because they don't want to have an effect on the gene pool by saving a weaker meerkat [or] affecting the outcome of what's natural in the Kalahari.\\" As the research project is monitoring \\"...the breeding success and survival of individuals and ... the factors that affect reproduction and survival\\" interfering in the natural processes would render the research results invalid. There is one exception to this rule: researchers will euthanize meerkats that contract tuberculosis, to prevent outbreaks that would threaten both the meerkat population and nearby cattle.  Awards  Meerkat Manor was nominated for a 2005 Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival Award in the \\"Animal Behaviour\\" category, and in 2007 for \\"Best Original Score\\". At the 2006 Wildscreen Festival, the series was a finalist in three categories: \\"Animal Behaviour\\", \\"Innovation\\", and \\"Popular Broadcast\\". The series won Gold Statues in \\"Natural History\\" and \\"Cinematography\\", and a Silver Statue for \\"Writing\\", at the 2006 Omni Awards. The eighth episode of series three, \\"Journey's End\\" which depicts the death of Whiskers matriarch Flower, was awarded the 2008 Wildscreen Festival Panda Award in the \\"Five Award for Popular Broadcast Programme\\" category. Meerkat Manor was a two-time Gold Medal winner in the \\"Nature & Wildlife\\" category at the New York Festivals Award Gala, in 2006 for series one, and again in 2007 for series one and two. The series was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards in 2007, one for \\"Outstanding Cinematography for Nonfiction Programming\\" and one for \\"Outstanding Picture Editing for Nonfiction Programming\\", and again for \\"Outstanding Cinematography\\" in 2008. In 2009 the series was awarded the Grand Award at the New York Festivals International Television Programming and Promotion Awards in the \\"Family Programmes\\" category.  Impact on the genre  Meerkat Manor's innovative new methods of filming allowed the Kalahari Project scientists a chance to uncover aspects of meerkat life never before seen, including life within the burrows. The film crew was also the first to capture meerkat infanticide on film. While many documentaries maintain an emotional distance from their subjects, Meerkat Manor ‚Äì due to its extended length, soap opera-like narration, romanticization of the animals' lives, and close-up filming techniques, provides a closer, more personal view of the meerkats. Viewers describe being emotionally involved in the animals' lives, sometimes forgetting they are watching a documentary. The meerkats' frequently short lives and brutal deaths become surprising and disturbing to some audiences. This experimental format was seen as expanding the boundaries of both the nature documentary genre and the nature of reality TV.  Merchandise  Cover of the original UK release of Meerkat Manor: The Story of Flower of the Kalahari A book written by Professor Tim Clutton-Brock entitled Meerkat Manor: The Story of Flower of the Kalahari () was released in the UK in a hardback edition on 4 October 2007. The book focuses on Flower's life and the story of the Whiskers, tracing how the group started, providing a timeline of Flower's life, and detailing all of the pups she had over her lifetime, as well as their current locations. The book also gives more background on how the Kalahari Meerkat Project started, the research goals and results, and researchers' personal lives. A paperback edition of the book was announced for release in the United States by Simon & Schuster through their Touchstone imprint on 15 April 2008. The US release was titled Meerkat Manor: Flower of the Kalahari (). In November 2007, Discovery Communications announced that it was partnering with Activision to make a video game based on Meerkat Manor as the first in a new series of nature-based games. The announcement stated the game would be released to multiple platforms in late 2008, but no game was ever released.  Film  Oxford Scientific Films produced a feature film for Discovery Films that acts as a prequel to the Meerkat Manor series. Originally announced as Flower: Queen of the Kalahari, Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins was directed by Chris Barker and Mike Slee and narrated by Whoopi Goldberg. The film documents Flower's early life as she grows from a young meerkat to become one of the most successful leaders of the Whiskers clan. The film was introduced at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival in the Spotlight section, and then aired in the United States on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008 as a lead-in to a thirty-minute Making of Meerkat Manor: the Story Begins special. It was released to Region 1 DVD in North America on 3 June 2008, with the Making of Meerkat Manor special, and another special, The Science of Meerkat Manor, included as extras. The film included re-edited footage and a new musical score. The Whiskers story was simplified, with the Lazuli being the only rival group to appear in the film. Unlike with the Meerkat Manor series, the film does not actually depict any of the real Whiskers meerkats. Untrained \\"meerkat actors\\" play the role of Flower and her family, with the camera crew searching out appropriately-aged meerkats, then following them until the meerkats acted in a way that was needed for the film. Flower herself was depicted by approximately eight female meerkats.

It was published by Palladium Books in October 1986 and uses the Palladium Megaversal system. Publication history Road Hogs was written by Erick Wujcik, and was published by Palladium Books in 1987 as a 48-page book. Content Road Hogs is an After the Bomb! supplement describing the postholocaust West Coast, including maps, new character rules, new animals, equipment and skills. The book focuses on vehicle combat, with a scenario and a comics story.  Setting  The storyline of After the Bomb introduced a post-nuclear warfare setting centered around the eastern United States, where most of the area is populated by mutated animals that form the predominant societies, as opposed to the setting of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness where mutants live on the fringes of contemporary human society. Road Hogs expands that setting to include the western United States, which is largely controlled by vicious gangs of mutants in heavily modified vehicles, scavenging for their existence. It is reminiscent of the movie The Road Warrior. The book outlines many new rules for the operation of vehicles and acquisition of resources in a bleak wasteland setting, as well as several adventure scenarios. These include road maps of Southern and Central California that indicate where the various factions and gangs occupying the region are located. Most of the civilized mutants and humans are located in what was previously known as Sacramento, California. A short story was included with the book to give feel of environment the supplement provided. It involves the tale of an ancient, slightly senile turtle martial-arts master who wields a pair of sais, hinting that this character may in fact be Raphael. He also mistakes one of his students for \\"Mike\\". This suggests that he was one of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The book is also noted for its original artwork by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman, which has not been reproduced in other books from Palladium.

All three creations are extinct. The first creation, Baron Clermont, of Clermont in the County of Louth, came in the Peerage of Ireland on 26 May 1770 for William Fortescue, who was later made Viscount Clermont and Earl of Clermont. For more information on this creation see Viscount Clermont, a title which became extinct in 1829. The second creation came in the Peerage of Ireland on 11 February 1852 when Thomas Fortescue, formerly Member of Parliament for Louth, was made Baron Clermont, of Dromisken in the County of Louth, with special remainder failing heirs male of his own to his younger brother Chichester Fortescue and the heirs male of his body. Thomas Fortescue was the son of Chichester Fortescue, member of the Irish House of Commons for Hillsborough, son of Thomas Fortescue, member of the Irish Parliament for Trim, son of Chichester Fortescue, MP for Trim, grandson of Chichester Fortescue, whose brother William Fortescue was the grandfather of the aforementioned William Fortescue, 1st Earl of Clermont (see Viscount Clermont). Chichester Fortescue was the great-grandson of John Fortescue, husband of Susannah, daughter of Sir John Chichester and sister of Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester and Edward Chichester, 1st Viscount Chichester, ancestor of the Marquesses of Donegall (hence the common first name of Chichester). In 1866 Lord Clermont was also made Baron Clermont, of Clermont Park in the County of Louth, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. He died childless in 1887 when the barony of 1866 became extinct while he was succeeded in the barony of 1852 according to the special remainder by his younger brother, Chichester Fortescue, who in 1863 had assumed the additional surname of Parkinson. He was a Liberal politician and had already been raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Carlingford, of Carlingford in the County of Louth, on 28 February 1874, with normal remainder to heirs male. Like his elder brother Lord Carlingford was childless and both the Carlingford and Clermont baronies became extinct on his death in 1898. Sir Chichester Fortescue, son of Chichester Fortescue, MP for Trim, was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy and member of the Irish Parliament for Trim.

The circuit has two associated phone numbers. When one side of the loop is called (side A), the caller receives a test tone of approximately 1000 Hz (milliwatt test). When the second number (side B) is called, it produces dead silence, but the party on side A hears the milliwatt test tone drop, and is connected to the person on side B. The purpose of the loop around test is to allow circuit testing to a distant central office without needing a person at the far end. The technician can send a tone down either line and measure the response tone on the second line to determine the path loss parameters. When a line is connected to side A, multiple telephone lines, within limits, may connect to side B and thus be connected into a conference with the person on side A. The function of the tone on side A was to alert those already connected, when somebody called the B side and connected.

Early life Seated left to right: Rudolph Schott, Apollo Milton Olin Smith, Frank Malina (white shirt, dark pants), Ed Forman and Jack Parsons (right, foreground). Nov. 15, 1936 Malina was born in Brenham, Texas. His father came from Bohemia. Frank's formal education began with a degree in mechanical engineering from Texas A&M; University in 1934. The same year he received a scholarship to study mechanical engineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he obtained his doctor degree in 1940. \\"Memoir On the Galcit Rocket Research Project, 1936-38\\". Frank Joseph Malina's presentation at the First International Symposium on the History of Astronautics, \\" PRE-1939 MEMOIRS OF ASTRONAUTICS \\", organized by the International Academy of Astronautics with the cooperation of the International Union of the History and Philosophy of Science at Belgrade on 25-26 September, 1967. In 1935, while a graduate student at Caltech, Malina persuaded Professor of Aeronautics Theodore von K√°rm√°n to allow him to pursue studies into rocketry and rocket propulsion. The formal goal was development of a sounding rocket. Malina and five associates (including Jack Parsons and Hsue-Shen Tsien) became known at Caltech as the \\"Suicide Squad\\" because of their dangerous experiments (and failures) when testing rocket motor designs. Malina's group was forced to move their operations away from the main Caltech campus into the more remote Arroyo Seco. This site and the research Malina was conducting would later become the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Malina served as the second Director of JPL. In 1939, the Soci√©t√© astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society) awarded Malina the Prix d'Astronautique for his contribution to the study of interplanetary travel and astronautics. Career Malina and his fifth WAC Corporal, October 11, 1945 In 1942, von K√°rm√°n, Malina and three other students started the Aerojet Corporation. By late 1945, Malina's rockets had outgrown the facility at Arroyo Seco, and his tests were moved to White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Here, the project's WAC Corporal sounding rocket was the first U.S. rocket to break the 50-mile altitude mark, becoming the first sounding rocket to reach space.The U.S. at the time used a definition of space as beginning at 50 miles' altitude, instead what would become the international standard . See K√°rm√°n line. During 1947, with rocket research in high gear, Malina's demanding travel and administrative schedule, along with a dislike of so much rocketry research being devoted to weapons systems and not scientific research, caused him to re-evaluate his career and leave Aerojet. Malina's interest in the Communist Party, Caltech's \\"Unit 122,\\" and labor activism while he was a graduate student in the 1930s had also attracted the attention of the FBI. However, there is \\"scant evidence\\" that Unit 122 or its \\"communist offshoot\\" ever passed rocket information to the Soviet Union in the 1930s or 1940s. (\\"The surveillance of suspected 'communists' hardly ever revealed espionage and served mainly to feed prejudice.\\") He moved to France and joined the fledgling United Nations as secretariat of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) under Julian Huxley. In 1951, Malina became head of UNESCO's division of scientific research. Two years later, Malina left UNESCO to pursue an interest in kinetic art. In 1952, at the height of the Red Scare, Malina was indicted for having failed to list his Communist Party membership on an old security questionnaire from Caltech. He was declared a fugitive, to be arrested if and when he returned to the United States. In 1968 in ParisOrigin of Leonardo journal at its official website he founded Leonardo, an international peer-reviewed research journal that featured articles written by artists on their own work, and focused on the interactions between the contemporary arts with the sciences and new technologies. The Leonardo journal is still published as a project of Leonardo/ISAST, the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology. In 1990, Malina was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame. Death and family Malina married twice. In 1939, he married Liljan Darcourt, a daughter of French Catholic immigrants; they divorced in 1945 (she later married advertising executive Lester Wunderman). Frank Malina died in 1981 in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, France. His widow Marjorie Duckworth Malina died in 2006. Their sons Roger and Alan Malina live and work in France and Portugal, respectively.  See also  * Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory * Qian Xuesen (H.S.

It is the holiest temple of the Yazidis. It is the location of the tomb of the Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir, a central figure of the Yazidi faith. The temple is above the town of Shekhan, which had the second largest population of Yazidi prior to the persecution of Yazidis by ISIL. The temple is about sixty kilometers north of Mosul and 14 kilometers west from the village Ayn Sifna. The temple is built at about 1000 meters above sea level and situated between three mountains, Hizrat in the west, Misat in the south and Arafat in the north. At least once in their lifetime, Yazidis are expected to make a six-day pilgrimage to Lalish to visit the tomb of ≈û√™x Ad√Æ and other sacred places. These other sacred places are shrines dedicated to other holy beings. There are two sacred springs called Zamzam and the KƒÅniyƒÅ spring (White Spring).

He was active in Germany in the 1940s and 1950s after World War II.  Teachings  Gr√∂ning said that his ideas were not a new teaching or religion, but rather an ancient knowledge that had been lost, saying that people had forgotten \\"the most important thing\\", that there is a higher power or force that is available to help people. At the center of his teachings was the importance of love, both for God and for others, saying \\"A human being is a creature of Love. What‚Äôs created in love can live only in Love. Love is God!\\" Gr√∂ning regarded health (rather than illness and disease) as the natural state of all living things and asserted that one can maintain health and heal from illness by absorption of a Divine life force that he called \\"heilstrom\\". which translates into English as \\"healing wave\\" or \\"healing stream\\".  Tuning in to divine energy  To connect with and receive this energy, Gr√∂ning taught a technique he called \\"einstellen\\" (German for \\"tuning in\\"). He said that human beings were like batteries that used energy. To maintain health, a person needed to daily renew themselves by tuning into the healing wave.Hausler, Grete. (2008) An Introduction to the Teaching of Bruno Groening. Thalmassig, Germany. p. 11. The practice of einstellen consists of sitting in an upright position with arms and legs uncrossed and palms facing upwards. He stated that it was very important for the back to be straight and to not have any kind of backrest if possible. Inwardly the practice consists of having the wish to receive the heilstrom, having faith that healing is possible, and then focusing on the body, observing the sensations and feelings thereof. He told people to \\"take on health\\" and that in this one regard, in regard to healing that it was permissible, even necessary to be selfish in a manner, that is, to focus on oneself. Gr√∂ning believed that when a person tunes into the healing stream that healings can occur spontaneously or slowly, depending on variables such as the quantity of life force flowing through the body, accelerated during \\"einstellen\\". Sometimes the symptoms may worsen or increased pain is experienced, before a healing occurs. Gr√∂ning called this occurrence regelungen (German for \\"regulation\\") and stated that it is sometimes a necessary part of the healing process.Hausler, Grete. (2008) An Introduction to the Teaching of Bruno Groening. Thalmassig, Germany. p. 10.  Power of thought and faith Gr√∂ning emphasized the importance of not thinking about negative things, especially dwelling on an illness one was hoping to heal, in maintaining a positive attitude and having faith, especially the faith that healing was possible. Gr√∂ning said that, ‚ÄúThoughts are energies which will come true! If now you take up the firm intent in your mind to regain your health and the belief that this is possible, with God‚Äôs help, you have built up the right mental attitude for healing to begin.‚Äù In his teachings, he emphasized that negative thinking and dwelling on problems interferes with the healing process. Gr√∂ning often stated that people needed to \\"Trust and believe --the Divine Power helps and heals.\\" He went so far as to say that the act of having faith in the divine, or in healing, is an essential part of the healing process.  Gr√∂ning's ideas about himself  Gr√∂ning's concept of himself was that he was an \\"appointed person\\", given the task and capacity to help people by God. He spoke of himself also as a \\"mediator\\" and a \\"transformer\\", in terms of his role and ability to help people connect with the healing stream. He never took credit for the healings, saying that he was only an instrument and servant of God and that it was God who accomplished healing, not himself. He said often that he was calling humanity to the \\"Great Reversal\\" or \\"Great Turnaround\\" - to live a life connected to the divine and to live in harmony with nature. \\"The sole purpose of my deeds and workings is to guide all people on this earth once again onto the right path, onto the divine path. This is the great reversal.\\"  Other teachings  The particular religion people followed was not considered important by Gr√∂ning; rather, what was important was that people had a type of spiritual or religious orientation, saying \\"To be connected with God, that is all.\\" Gr√∂ning spoke of God as the father of all people, who sends help and healing through the \\"healing stream\\" regardless of their religion or nationality. He encouraged people to strengthen their connection with whatever faith or denomination they adhered to, and to practice their faith or religion with more diligence, saying \\"It makes absolutely no difference how the person finds God; the main thing is, that he finds God!‚Äú  Life  Gr√∂ning had no formal medical training. After working as a carpenter and pursuing some other occupations, he was conscripted during World War II. After being drafted, he stated that he would not kill another human being and came close to being executed for this stance at a court martial. Later, he was made a prisoner of war in Russia; he argued with his captors for better conditions in the prison.Kamp, Matthias. M.D. (1999) Healing the Spiritual Way through the teachings of Bruno Gr√∂ning, Monchengladbach, Germany. pp. 113-114. Gr√∂ning came to public attention in 1949. In Herford, the father of a young boy named Dieter Hulsmann, claimed that Gr√∂ning had healed his son of muscular dystrophy and told many people of his belief. News of this story circulated and soon crowds gathered in front of the Hulsmann residence, seeking healing.Kamp, Matthias. M.D. (1999) Healing the Spiritual Way through the teachings of Bruno Gr√∂ning. Monchengladbach, Germany. p. 114 Soon newspapers began covering the story, which drew larger crowds of up to 5,000 people. As he traveled around Germany, Austria and Switzerland he would often draw similar size and larger crowds. In September 1949, up to 30,000 people daily came to the city of Rosenheim to see him. Once again, newspapers ran stories about him, even printing entire special editions about the gatherings there. Gr√∂ning died at the age of 52 of stomach cancer.  Reception  Media coverage of Bruno Gr√∂ning was mixed, with contradictory reports. Some called Gr√∂ning a \\"miracle doctor\\", others \\"charlatan.\\" Gr√∂ning faced many legal challenges. In many towns he was forbidden to heal or speak to people. Reasons for this varied. One charge brought against him was that he was practicing medicine without a license. At other times officials were concerned about the large crowds that gathered. He went on trial twice. He was unable to take part in the second trial because he was undergoing surgery at the time.  Following  Various groups continue to promulgate Gr√∂ning's teaching, including the Circle of Information, the Bruno Groening Trust, the Bruno Groening Friends, the Association for the Advancement in Germany of Spiritual and Natural - Psychological Foundations for Living, the Association for Natural Spiritual Living, the Bruno Gr√∂ning Circle of Friends and Help and Healing Sessions. Gr√∂ning founded the Association for the Advancement in 1958 to replace the Gr√∂ning Association. The Circle of Friends was founded in 1979 by Grete Hausler, an Austrian school teacher who worked closely with Gr√∂ning. The Circle of Information was created by Thomas Busse, who has written a number of books about Gr√∂ning and directed the documentary film The Gr√∂ning Phenomena. Help and Healing Sessions is an association of independent Groening groups and hosts online meetings. The Bruno Gr√∂ning Circle of Friends was listed as a commercial cult in an official 1997 report by the Berlin Senate Committee.

The monorail is associated with the names Louis Brennan, August Scherl and Pyotr Shilovsky, who each built full-scale working prototypes during the early part of the twentieth century. A version was developed by Ernest F. Swinney, Harry Ferreira and Louis E. Swinney in the US in 1962. The gyro monorail was never developed beyond the prototype stage. The principal advantage of the monorail cited by Shilovsky is the suppression of hunting oscillation, a speed limitation encountered by conventional railways at the time. Also, sharper turns are possible compared to the 7 km radius of turn typical of modern high-speed trains such as the TGV, because the vehicle will bank automatically on bends, like an aircraft, so that no lateral centrifugal acceleration is experienced on board. A major drawback is that many cars ‚Äì including passenger and freight cars, not just the locomotive ‚Äì would require a constantly powered gyroscope to stay upright. Unlike other means of maintaining balance, such as lateral shifting of the centre of gravity or the use of reaction wheels, the gyroscopic balancing system is statically stable, so that the control system serves only to impart dynamic stability. The active part of the balancing system is therefore more accurately described as a roll damper.  Historical background =Brennan's monorail Harmsworth Popular Science illustration showing the monorail mechanism, and (inset) Louis Brennanc.1913, Vol.3, p.1684 The image in the leader section depicts the 22 tonne (unladen weight) prototype vehicle developed by Louis Philip Brennan CB. Brennan filed his first monorail patent in 1903. His first demonstration model was just a 2 ft 6in by 12 inch (762 mm by 300 mm) box containing the balancing system. However, this was sufficient for the Army Council to recommend a sum of ¬£10,000 for the development of a full-size vehicle. This was vetoed by their Financial Department. However, the Army found ¬£2000 from various sources to fund Brennan's work. Within this budget Brennan produced a larger model, 6 ft (1.83m) long by 1 ft 6in (0.46m) wide, kept in balance by two 5 inch (127 mm) diameter gyroscope rotors. This model is still in existence in the London Science Museum. The track for the vehicle was laid in the grounds of Brennan's house in Gillingham, Kent. It consisted of ordinary gas piping laid on wooden sleepers, with a fifty-foot wire rope bridge, sharp corners and slopes up to one in five. Brennan demonstrated his model in a lecture to the Royal Society in 1907 when it was shown running back and forth \\"on a taught and slender wire\\" \\"under the perfect control of the inventor\\".Revolution in Travel, Birmingham Daily Gazette, 9 May 1907, p8 Brennan's reduced scale railway largely vindicated the War Department's initial enthusiasm. However, the election in 1906 of a Liberal government, with policies of financial retrenchment, effectively stopped the funding from the Army. However, the India Office voted an advance of ¬£6000 in 1907 to develop the monorail for the North West Frontier region, and a further ¬£5000 was advanced by the Durbar of Kashmir in 1908. This money was almost spent by January 1909, when the India Office advanced a further ¬£2000. On 15 October 1909, the railcar ran under its own power for the first time, carrying 32 people around the factory. The vehicle was 40 ft (12.2m) long and 10 ft (3m) wide, and with a 20 hp (15 kW) petrol engine, had a speed of 22 mph (35 km/h). The transmission was electric, with the petrol engine driving a generator, and electric motors located on both bogies. This generator also supplied power to the gyro motors and the air compressor. The balancing system used a pneumatic servo, rather than the friction wheels used in the earlier model. The gyros were located in the cab, although Brennan planned to re-site them under the floor of the vehicle before displaying the vehicle in public, but the unveiling of Scherl's machine forced him to bring forward the first public demonstration to 10 November 1909. There was insufficient time to re- position the gyros before the monorail's public debut. The real public debut for Brennan's monorail was the Japan-British Exhibition at the White City, London in 1910. The monorail car carried 50 passengers at a time around a circular track at 20 mph. Passengers included Winston Churchill, who showed considerable enthusiasm. Interest was such that children's clockwork monorail toys, single-wheeled and gyro-stabilised, were produced in England and Germany. Although a viable means of transport, the monorail failed to attract further investment. Of the two vehicles built, one was sold as scrap, and the other was used as a park shelter until 1930. Scherl's car Just as Brennan completed testing his vehicle, August Scherl, a German publisher and philanthropist, announced a public demonstration of the gyro monorail which he had developed in Germany. The demonstration was to take place on Wednesday 10 November 1909 at the Berlin Zoological Gardens. Scherl's Monorail Car Scherl's machine, also a full size vehicle, was somewhat smaller than Brennan's, with a length of only 17 ft (5.2m). It could accommodate four passengers on a pair of transverse bench seats. The gyros were located under the seats, and had vertical axes, while Brennan used a pair of horizontal axis gyros. The servomechanism was hydraulic, and propulsion electric. Strictly speaking, August Scherl merely provided the financial backing. The righting mechanism was invented by Paul Fr√∂hlich, and the car designed by Emil Falcke. Although well received and performing perfectly during its public demonstrations, the car failed to attract significant financial support, and Scherl wrote off his investment in it. Shilovsky's work Following the failure of Brennan and Scherl to attract the necessary investment, the practical development of the gyro-monorail after 1910 continued with the work of Pyotr Shilovsky, a Russian aristocrat residing in London. His balancing system was based on slightly different principles to those of Brennan and Scherl, and permitted the use of a smaller, more slowly spinning gyroscope. After developing a model gyro monorail in 1911, he designed a gyrocar which was built by Wolseley Motors Limited and tested on the streets of London in 1913. Since it used a single gyro, rather than the counter-rotating pair favoured by Brennan and Scherl, it exhibited asymmetry in its behaviour, and became unstable during sharp left hand turns. It attracted interest but no serious funding. –ú–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–∑–∞–¥–æ–ª–≥–æ –¥–æ –∏—Å–ø—ã—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–π.jpgSchilowsky's gyrocar Post-World War I developments In 1922, the Soviet government began construction of a Shilovsky monorail between Leningrad and Tsarskoe Selo, but funds ran out shortly after the project was begun. In 1929, at the age of 74, Brennan also developed a gyrocar. This was turned down by a consortium of Austin/Morris/Rover, on the basis that they could sell all the conventional cars they built.  Principles of operation = Basic idea  The vehicle runs on a single conventional rail, so that without the balancing system it would topple over. Basic principle of operation: rotation about the vertical axis causes movement about the horizontal axis. A spinning wheel is mounted in a gimbal frame whose axis of rotation (the precession axis) is perpendicular to the spin axis. The assembly is mounted on the vehicle chassis such that, at equilibrium, the spin axis, precession axis and vehicle roll axis are mutually perpendicular. Forcing the gimbal to rotate causes the wheel to precess resulting in gyroscopic torques about the roll axis, so that the mechanism has the potential to right the vehicle when tilted from the vertical. The wheel shows a tendency to align its spin axis with the axis of rotation (the gimbal axis), and it is this action which rotates the entire vehicle about its roll axis. Ideally, the mechanism applying control torques to the gimbal ought to be passive (an arrangement of springs, dampers and levers), but the fundamental nature of the problem indicates that this would be impossible. The equilibrium position is with the vehicle upright, so that any disturbance from this position reduces the height of the centre of gravity, lowering the potential energy of the system. Whatever returns the vehicle to equilibrium must be capable of restoring this potential energy, and hence cannot consist of passive elements alone. The system must contain an active servo of some kind. Disturbed cg height. (The difference in height shown is exaggerated.) The balancing system must do work against gravity to right the vehicle when disturbed.  Side loads  If constant side forces were resisted by gyroscopic action alone, the gimbal would rotate quickly on to the stops, and the vehicle would topple. In fact, the mechanism causes the vehicle to lean into the disturbance, resisting it with a component of weight, with the gyro near its undeflected position. Inertial side forces, arising from cornering, cause the vehicle to lean into the corner. A single gyro introduces an asymmetry which will cause the vehicle to lean too far, or not far enough for the net force to remain in the plane of symmetry, so side forces will still be experienced on board. In order to ensure that the vehicle banks correctly on corners, it is necessary to remove the gyroscopic torque arising from the vehicle rate of turn. A free gyro keeps its orientation with respect to inertial space, and gyroscopic moments are generated by rotating it about an axis perpendicular to the spin axis. But the control system deflects the gyro with respect to the chassis, and not with respect to the fixed stars. It follows that the pitch and yaw motion of the vehicle with respect to inertial space will introduce additional unwanted, gyroscopic torques. These give rise to unsatisfactory equilibria, but more seriously, cause a loss of static stability when turning in one direction, and an increase in static stability in the opposite direction. Shilovsky encountered this problem with his road vehicle, which consequently could not make sharp left hand turns. Brennan and Scherl were aware of this problem, and implemented their balancing systems with pairs of counter rotating gyros, precessing in opposite directions. With this arrangement, all motion of the vehicle with respect to inertial space causes equal and opposite torques on the two gyros, and are consequently cancelled out. With the double gyro system, the instability on bends is eliminated and the vehicle will bank to the correct angle, so that no net side force is experienced on board. When cornering, the counter-rotating gyros avoid instability on corners. Shilovsky claimed to have difficulty ensuring stability with double-gyro systems, although the reason why this should be so is not clear. His solution was to vary the control loop parameters with turn rate, to maintain similar response in turns of either direction. Offset loads similarly cause the vehicle to lean until the centre of gravity lies above the support point. Side winds cause the vehicle to tilt into them, to resist them with a component of weight. These contact forces are likely to cause more discomfort than cornering forces, because they will result in net side forces being experienced on board. The contact side forces result in a gimbal deflection bias in a Shilovsky loop. This may be used as an input to a slower loop to shift the centre of gravity laterally, so that the vehicle remains upright in the presence of sustained non-inertial forces. This combination of gyro and lateral cg shift is the subject of a 1962 patent. A vehicle using a gyro/lateral payload shift was built by Ernest F. Swinney, Harry Ferreira and Louis E. Swinney in the US in 1962. This system is called the Gyro-Dynamics monorail.  Potential advantages over two-rail vehicles  The advantages of the monorail over conventional railways were summarised by Shilovsky. The following have been claimed.  Reduced right-of-way problem  The close association of the vehicle with its single rail, its inherent ability to bank on bends, and the reduced reliance on adhesion forces are all factors which are pertinent to the development of surface travel. In principle, steeper gradients and sharper corners may be negotiated compared with a conventional adhesion railway. Typical high speed train designs have radius of turn of 7 km, with consequently few options for new routes within developed countries, where almost all of the land is under individual or corporate ownership. In his book, Shilovsky describes a form of on-track braking, which is feasible with a monorail, but would upset the directional stability of a conventional rail vehicle. This has the potential of much shorter stopping distances compared with conventional wheel on steel, with a corresponding reduction in safe separation between trains. The result is potentially higher occupancy of the track, and higher capacity.  Reduced total system cost  While the individual vehicles are likely to be expensive, the greatest cost arises from the construction and maintenance of the permanent way, which, for a single rail at ground level must be cheaper.  Benign failure modes  The angular momentum in the gyros is so high that loss of power will not present a hazard for a good half-hour in a well designed system. Monorail v two track response  Reduced weight  Shilovsky claimed his designs were actually lighter than the equivalent duo-rail vehicles. The gyro mass, according to Brennan, accounts for 3‚Äì5% of the vehicle weight, which is comparable to the bogie weight saved in using a single track design.  Potential for high speed  High speed conventionally requires straight track, introducing a right of way problem in developed countries. Wheel profiles which permit sharp cornering tend to encounter the classical hunting oscillation at low speeds. Running on a single rail is an effective means to suppress hunting. Turning corners Contribution of body rotation Considering a vehicle negotiating a horizontal curve, the most serious problems arise if the gyro axis is vertical. There is a component of turn rate \\\\Omega acting about the gimbal pivot, so that an additional gyroscopic moment is introduced into the roll equation: :::A\\\\frac{d^2\\\\phi}{dt^2}+H(\\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{dt}+\\\\Omega \\\\phi)=Wh \\\\phi This displaces the roll from the correct bank angle for the turn, but more seriously, changes the constant term in the characteristic equation to: :::\\\\frac{(Wh-H\\\\Omega)k}{AJ} Evidently, if the turn rate exceeds a critical value: ::\\\\Omega=\\\\frac{Wh}{H} The balancing loop will become unstable. However, an identical gyro spinning in the opposite sense will cancel the roll torque which is causing the instability, and if it is forced to precess in the opposite direction to the first gyro will produce a control torque in the same direction. In 1972, the Canadian Government's Division of Mechanical Engineering rejected a monorail proposal largely on the basis of this problem. Their analysis was correct, but restricted in scope to single vertical axis gyro systems, and not universal. =Maximum spin rate= Gas turbine engines are designed with peripheral speeds as high as 400 m/s, and have operated reliably on thousands of aircraft over the past 50 years. Hence, an estimate of the gyro mass for a 10 tonne vehicle, with cg height at 2m, assuming a peripheral speed of half what is used in jet engine design, is a mere 140 kg. Brennan's recommendation of 3‚Äì5% of the vehicle mass was therefore highly conservative.

History  The Society was formed in September 1920 by the amalgamation of the Stratford Co-operative Society and the Edmonton Co- operative Society, two of the largest societies in the London Metropolitan area, forming the largest retail co-operative society in the United Kingdom. Initially, the LCS headquarters were located at 54 Maryland Street, Stratford, E.15. A key agreement reached with the London Trades Council and London Labour Party led to a plan to develop in Central London a meeting center consisting of restaurant, general store, club and hall accommodations to address an unmet need of the city. In 1921, the LCS was also joined by the West London Society, the Kingston Society and the Co-operative Brotherhood Trust. In addition, the Society also took over two branches of the Staines Co-operative Party. The consolidation of co-operative societies in the Greater London area continued until 1938, with the absorption of Hendon Co-operative Society in 1925, the North West London Co-operative Society in 1928, the Epping Co-operative Society in 1929, the Yiewsley Co-operative Society in 1931, the Willesden Junction Railway Society in 1935 and the Radlett Co-operative Society in 1938. Hence, the LCS was able to extend its area of the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey. The company's general manager through part of this period (1924‚Äì1933) was Sidney Foster, who in 1933 went on to manage the Milk Marketing Board. By 1946, LCS had reached a membership of 832,670 members, the highest of any of Britain's co-operatives, and had an annual revenue of . Also in 1946, LCS acquired 200 Oxford Street in London, which had been the headquarters of the BBC Overseas Service since 1941; LCS moved its headquarters into the building in 1949. By 1952, the LCS and its associated co-operative organisations, the major being the London Co-operative Chemists Limited, had over 550 establishments of sales and services, varying from large department stores to small grocery shops. By 1963, the London Society was noted as being the largest co-operative of its kind in the world, which was led by John Stonehouse as President at the time, who also served as a Labour Member of Parliament. In 1981, Co-operative Retail Services acquired LCS, which had been losing millions of pounds.  Operations and influence  The LCS played a large part in the national co-operative movement and was a member of the national and regional organisations, chief of which being the Co- operative Union to which the LCS subscribed. The LCS was also a shareholding member of the English Co-operative Wholesale Society, generally known as the CWS, a federal wholesaling organisation for co-operative societies in England and Wales. 1950s-era establishments consisted of grocers, butchers, fruit, vegetable and flower sellers, coal depots, furniture sellers, drapers, tailors, footwear sellers, chemists, laundries, estate agencies, funeral services and even guesthouses.Former London Co-operative Society creamery and railhead for milk trains at Puxton, Somerset on the Bristol to Exeter line LCS administered many manufacturing and processing establishments. It had creameries located at various places in the West Country, including Puxton, Somerset which served as a regional railhead, product from which was transported via milk trains to the main London creamery and distribution point at West Ealing.  Politics  Politically, the Society has also had a major impact. In the interwar years, the LCS Political Committee played an important role in winning Londoners over to the Labour Party, mobilising people behind co-operative ideals, and shaping policy at a national level, working as part of the national Co-operative Party. In 1938, LCS initiated a boycott against Japanese goods, encouraging the Cooperative Wholesale Society to follow its example. At the 1945 election, all 11 LCS-sponsored candidates were elected, including Dan Chater in Bethnal Green North East, Percy Holman in Bethnal Green South West and C.S.Ganley in Battersea South. Alfred Barnes, also elected for East Ham South, even became a Cabinet Minister in the Attlee administration after 1945. In the post-war world, it continued as an important campaigning force, providing key organisational backing for mass movements like Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Anti-Apartheid, supporting the fight against the Vietnam War and campaigns during the miner's strikes, and generally at the forefront of the campaign for peace, co-operation and socialism. A political presence was also maintained in the House of Commons through the work of MPs, such as Stan Newens and Laurie Pavitt. Alf Lomas (the former Secretary of the London Co-op Political Committee) was also an MEP and Leader of the British Labour Group of MEPs.

He had been accompanied by four priests. Nombre de Dios (mission) is at the spot of the first Thanksgiving Mass celebrated on the grounds. Martin Francisco Lopez de Mendoza Grajales became first parish priest of St. Augustine, the first established parish in the United States. Pending the arrival of regular missionaries, Men√©ndez appointed soldiers he deemed qualified to give religious instructions to the Indians. The Jesuits were the first to arrive. Three were sent by St. Francis Borgia in 1566 and ten in 1568. The few who survived the martyrdom of their brethren were recalled in 1572. In 1577, the Franciscans arrived. In 1597, a young chief, smarting from a reprimand, instigated a general massacre of the missionaries. In 1609, several Indian chiefs sought baptism at St. Augustine. Evangelizing became easier afterwards. This lasted past the middle of the century. In 1634, the Franciscan province of St. Helena, with mother-house at St. Augustine, contained 44 Indian missions, 35 missionaries, and 30,000 Roman Catholic Indians. By 1674, evidences of decline begin to appear. Bishop Calderon found his episcopal jurisdiction questioned by the friars. Although he confirmed many Indians, he complained of their religious ignorance. Relations between the colonists and natives worsened. The colony was menaced by the growing English power to the north. In 1704, the blow fell. Moore's raid burned, plundered, destroyed, and enslaved the natives at the Mission San Luis de Apalachee. Efforts at re- establishment partially succeeded. By 1720, there were six towns of Roman Catholic Indians and several missions. Persistent conflict between the Spanish and English colonies reduced these to four missions with 136 people by 1763. The cession to England in 1763 resulted, not merely in the final extinction of the missions, but in the complete obliteration of Florida's ancient Roman Catholicity. Catholic Heritage of Florida Plaque in Cathedral-Basilica Formation of Dioceses St. Augustine began its existence as a regularly constituted parish of the Diocese of Santiago de Cuba. Its church records, dating from 1594, are preserved in the archives of the present cathedral. The first recorded episcopal visitation was made by Bishop Cabeza de Altamirano in 1606. In 1674, Bishop Gabriel Diaz Vara Calderon visited the Floridian portion of his diocese; he conferred minor orders on seven candidates, and during an itinerary of eight months, extending to the Carolinian confines, confirmed 13,152 persons, founded many mission churches, and liberally supplied others. The permanent residence of Bishops-Auxiliary Resino (1709‚Äì10), Tejada (1735‚Äì45), and Ponce y Carasco (1751‚Äì55) at St. Augustine, demonstrates that, despite the waning condition of the colony and missions at this period, the Church in Florida continued episcopal oversight. Bishop Morell of Santiago, exiled from his see during the English occupation of Havana (1662‚Äì63), remained four months at St. Augustine, confirming 639 persons. When Florida in 1763 passed under English rule, freedom of worship was guaranteed, but the illiberal interpretation of officials resulted in the general exodus of Roman Catholics, so that by 1765, the bi-centenary year of the Church in Florida, a few defaced church buildings presented the only evidence of its former Catholicity. Five hundred survivors of the New Smyrna colony of 1,400 Roman Catholics, natives of Mediterranean lands, settled at St. Augustine in 1776 and preserved the Faith alive through a trying epoch. In 1787, Florida became subject to the newly constituted See of St. Christopher of Havana, and the following year Bishop Cyril de Barcelona found the church at St. Augustine progressing satisfactorily under the care of Fathers Hassett and O'Reilly, who had arrived on the retrocession of Florida to Spain in 1783. In 1793, Pius VI established the Diocese of Louisiana and the Floridas, appointing the Right Rev. Luis Pe√±alver y Cardenas, with residence at New Orleans, as first bishop. After Bishop Pe√±alver's promotion to the Archbishopric of Guatemala in 1801, no successor having been appointed, Louisiana, which was annexed to the United States in 1803, came under the jurisdiction of Bishop Carroll of Baltimore in 1806, the bishops of Havana reassuming authority over Florida until the appointment of the Rev. Michael Portier in 1825 to the new Vicariate of Alabama and Florida. Bishop Portier undertook single-handed the work of his vast vicariate, not having a single priest, until at his request, Bishop England of Charleston sent Father Edward Mayne to St. Augustine in 1828. In 1850, the See of Savannah was created and included that part of Florida which lies east of the Apalachicola River; this was constituted a separate vicariate in 1857 under the Right Rev. Augustin Verot as vicar apostolic and erected into the Diocese of St. Augustine in 1870, with Bishop Verot, who had occupied the See of Savannah since 1861, as first bishop. Bishop Verot's unwearied activity and zeal in promoting religion and education soon bore fruit; schools were opened by the Christian Brothers and the Sisters of Mercy in 1858, but the outbreak of the Civil War frustrated all hopes of success. In 1866, the Sisters of St. Joseph were introduced from France, and despite the most adverse conditions, they had several flourishing schools and academies in operation before many years. The era of progress inaugurated by Bishop Verot continued under the administration of Bishop John Moore (1877‚Äì1901), whose successor, the Right Rev. William John Kenny, was consecrated by Cardinal Gibbons 18 May 1902, in the historic cathedral of St. Augustine. The Catholic population of the State, including 1750 coloured Catholics, is (1908) about 30,000. The Diocese of St. Augustine, wholly included within the State, contains about 25,000 Catholics; there are 49 priests with 40 churches and several missions, and 2897 young people under the care of religious teaching institutes. That portion of the state situated west of the Apalachicola River forms part of the Diocese of Mobile since 1829; the Catholic population is about 5000, there are five churches with resident priests and 6 Catholic schools with 807 pupils; Pensacola, founded 1696, is the Catholic centre. Parishes There are 52 active parishes in the Diocese of St. Augustine.

Frederick the Great had the building constructed to house his collection of antique artifacts, coins and antique gems. Carl von Gontard created the building in 1768/69 near the New Palace north of the Central Alley, as a complement to the Temple of Friendship situated south of the Alley. Since 1921 the Antique Temple has been used as a mausoleum for members of the House of Hohenzollern and is not open to the public. Usage under Frederick the Great The Antique Temple was, like the Sanssouci Picture Gallery, envisioned from the beginning as a museum and at the time of Frederick the Great could be visited after notifying the castellan at the New Palace. Next to dozens of antique ornaments, such as marble urns, bronze figurines, tools, weights and ceramics, could be found the so-called 'Family of Lycomedes', ten life-sized marble statues on marble plinths. They came to Frederick the Great from the art collection of the French Cardinal Melchior de Polignac. Fifty busts of marble, basalt and bronze sat on brackets, 31 of which also came from Polignac's collection; the rest were from Friedrich's favourite sister, Princess Wilhelmine, Margravine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. In a square annex that could only be reached through opening a door from the round central hall, the Coin Chamber was created. Four cedar wood cupboards were filled with over 9,200 gold, silver and bronze coins, around 4,370 engraved gems and cameos, 48 marble, terra cotta and bronze reliefs, and books from Frederick the Great's archaeological library. New usage under Frederick William III Frederick William III, who ruled Prussia from 1797, announced in a Cabinet Order on 1 September 1798: > \\"...for the progress of the study of the antiquities and art... the > collection of medals and antiques in the Antique Temple in Potsdam shall be > united with the similar collections in Berlin and entrusted with the Academy > of Sciences...\\" Consequently, the coin and gem collection were placed in the Antique Chamber of the Berlin City Palace. In 1828 the sculptures and busts followed, which, after being restored in the workshop of the sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch, found their place in the Altes Museum in Lustgarten. The museum was built to the design of the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and opened in 1830. In June 1828 Friedrich William III had the second version of a coffin designed by Christian Daniel Rauch set into the now empty Antique Temple. The coffin's famous original lay in the mausoleum in the park of Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin, which was completed for Queen Louise, who died 19 July 1810. Until 1904 the copy remained in the Antique Temple, and arrived in Spring 1877 in the Hohenzollern Museum, situated in Monbijou Palace, which was open to the public. The Monbijou Palace was destroyed during the Second World War. Planned change of use under Wilhelm II The Antique Temple after 1921 with the likeness of the late Empress Augusta Victoria Plans for the use of the Antique Temple as a court chapel were made during the reign of Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor. The architect Ernst von Ihne drew up several designs. The first from 1904/05 suggested a conversion in the style of the Italian High Renaissance. Eight years later, in 1913, came plans for classical interior decoration. Due to other building projects and the outbreak of the First World War, the project was never realised, however. Even a suggestion from 1918, to furbish a gravesite for the imperial leadership, did not come to fruition. However, on 19 April 1921, Empress Augusta Victoria was laid in the Antique Temple, according to her wishes, and until the 1940s the Antique Temple became the final resting place of other members of the House of Hohenzollern. Usage as a mausoleum Five members of the House of Hohenzollern found their final resting place in the Antique Temple: *Empress Augusta Viktoria (born 22 October 1858; died 11 April 1921) :The first wife of Emperor Wilhelm II died in exile in Doorn House, near Utrecht in the Netherlands, following a serious illness. The house was from 1920 the home of the abdicated German emperor. *Prince Joachim of Prussia (born 17 December 1890; died 18 July 1920) :The youngest son of Wilhem II died one day after a suicide attempt with an army revolver in St. Josef Hospital, Potsdam. The prince's coffin initially lay in the sacristy of the Potsdam Church of Peace and was transferred to the Antique Temple in 1931. *Prince Wilhelm of Prussia (born 4 July 1906; died 26 May 1940) :Prince William was the eldest son of Crown-Prince Wilhelm, German Crown Prince and his wife, Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, as well as grandson of Wilhelm II. The prince took part in the invasion of France during World War II. He was wounded during the fighting in Valenciennes and died in a field hospital in Nivelles. *Prince Eitel Friederich of Prussia (born 7 July 1883; died 8 December 1942) :The second eldest son of Wilhelm II died in Ingenheim, his villa in Potsdam. *Hermine Reuss, German Empress and Queen of Prussia (title held in pretence as her husband had ceased to be German Emperor and King of Prussia in November 1918), formerly Dowager Princess of Sch√∂naich- Carolath, (born 17 December 1887; died 7 August 1947) :The second wife of William II died suddenly of a heart attack in a small flat in Frankfurt (Oder), where she was under heavy guard by the Russian occupation force. Architecture= Outer features  The building is an unadorned closed round temple, surrounded by ten Tuscan columns, forming a Beehive tomb. The inner diameter of the building (the rotunda) is about sixteen meters in length. The square annex at the back of the building measures 9.4 metres √ó 9.4 metres, and is overlooked by three windows. The arched roof is crowned by a cupola, from which four diagonal-oval window openings admit light into the central chamber. The building can be entered through a single entrance: a rounded, door at the head of a staircase. An oblong gable over the cornice accentuates the building's front. Interior decoration The wall surfaces of the rotunda are decorated with grey Silesian marble. Large sculptures and vessels stand on a bench of wood which still runs around the building. Above them are antique busts, which stand on fifty brackets on three tiers. A marble relief Emperor Trajan on his Horse, in gold framing, likewise still decorates the area of wall over the entrance door today. A faded painting on the inside of the cupola shows genies in the clouds holding a garland of flowers. The surfaces of the annex, which can be reached from the rotunda through a rounded door, are paneled with wood.

He has been in the show since 1996. Marlon has been married four times: firstly to Tricia Fisher (Sheree Murphy); secondly to Donna Windsor (Verity Rushworth); thirdly to Laurel Thomas (Charlotte Bellamy); and fourthly Jessie Grant (Sandra Marvin). In 2010, he dated Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry), and is father to a Down syndrome child named Leo, who Rhona gave birth to in 2011. Storylines Marlon arrived in 1996 to stay with his uncle, Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell). He arrived in a red sports car and later brought his dad Albert back to the village. Marlon supported his uncle Zak through his testicular cancer and became good friends with Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt). Marlon also had a brief relationship with Sonya. In 1997, Marlon started working at Kathy Glover's (Malandra Burrows) establishment - tea rooms at day and wine bar at night, where he first showed his cooking skills. When Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) and Dee de la Cruz (Claudia Malkovich) split up, Eric went into despair and put Marlon in charge of his business. The ambitious chef was overwhelmed by such a huge responsibility and grabbed the opportunity with both hands ‚Äì even though the Dingles tried to take advantage by regularly dropping in for free food. However, Marlon's reign as the culinary king of Emmerdale was cut short when Kathy hired Carlos Diaz (Gary Turner) to work at the diner. Marlon was getting his feet well and truly under the table at The Woolpack anyway. Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles) was impressed by Marlon's cooking and let him work some nights there and even shared a cheeky snog one night. But while his kiss with Bernice led to nothing, Marlon would find true love at The Woolpack. New barmaid Tricia Stokes (Sheree Murphy), a dippy girl with a heart of gold, began flirting with Marlon. After a few months of misunderstandings the couple got together and went on holiday to Spain to celebrate. Their relationship was severely tested when Tricia agreed to marry Jason Kirk's (James Carlton) boyfriend, Joe Fisher, so he could stay in the country. Although Joe offered Tricia a considerable sum, Marlon was shocked she would even consider it and they nearly broke up. Just before the wedding, they reconciled and Tricia invested the money from Joe in Marlon's business, Chez Marlon. The business failed, and Tricia disappeared after a few months. After spending ages trying to find her, Marlon moved on and began dating locum vet Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry). However, Marlon's world was turned upside down when Tricia returned and they decided to get married. When the big day came, Tricia injured her neck and needed to wear a collar. She was so upset that she called off the wedding and their friends Paddy and Emily Kirk (Kate McGregor) got married instead. However, Marlon and Tricia did eventually marry a few months later. Tricia was offered the chance to star in a Bollywood film and went to India for six months. While she was away, Marlon was dreadfully lonely and had a drunken one night stand with his cousin Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins). When Tricia returned, the secret came out and she left Marlon. His desperate attempts to win her back seemed to have failed but she was willing to forgive him after reading a romantic list of her characteristics written by Marlon. On New Year's Eve 2003, Tricia was injured during a storm which resulted in part of the Woolpack's roof collapsing on top of her. Tricia was found alive and rushed to hospital but suffered a heart attack. The hospital staff revived her but tests revealed that she had suffered serious brain damage. She was declared braindead and the medical team requested permission to switch off her life support machine. Marlon took some convincing to agree, as he was still determined that she would recover, but he finally agreed on realising that there was no hope of her recovering. Emily supports Marlon after the death of his first wife, Tricia (2004). The grief suffered by Marlon was prolonged close to a year until he developed a friendship with Donna Windsor (Verity Rushworth). It was thanks to Donna's kind heart that Marlon moved on from his loss. Although he rebuffed her attempts to snare him early in the year, Donna proved she was the woman for Marlon when she helped him look after his cousin, Lilith Dingle's (Amanda Hennessy), children when she suddenly left them with him. It didn't take long for Marlon and Donna to fall in love. When he proposed to her en route to a chef's competition in Newcastle, Donna agreed and it looked like there was a happy ending in sight. However, being so young, marriage was a big thing for Donna to consider. She'd also recently become close to Max King (Charlie Kemp) and his death left her absolutely devastated. Shortly before the wedding, Marlon started having nightmares about Tricia. This was made worse when Marlon caught Donna trying on Tricia's wedding dress, making him think that Tricia had come back. Donna explained she felt like she was always being compared to Tricia. On the morning of the wedding, Donna confided in Marlon that she had feelings for Max while they were together. Heartbroken by this admission, Marlon wondered if they should get married but his love for her overwhelmed his doubts and they married. On return from honeymoon, Marlon and Donna spent their first few months of married life living at Smithy Cottage with Paddy and Toni Daggert (Kerry Stacey). Donna and Marlon were desperate to get on the property ladder but the prices at King & Sons' new development were too steep. So when they won the Kings River Showhome, they were thrilled but shocked to discover that they still had to pay a deposit. Donna's mother, Viv Hope (Deena Payne), offered Donna the money if Donna would be her surrogate. Marlon and Donna were stunned by Viv's suggestion that Donna get pregnant with her half-brother or sister but agreed because they needed the money to keep their new home. However the showhome collapsed following a gas explosion, leaving Marlon and Donna's dream shattered. Donna returned her mother's money as there was no longer a house to buy and Viv didn't need a surrogate, discovering she was pregnant. Following the showhome collapse, Marlon and Donna lived in a caravan outside Wishing Well cottage. They were building an \\"Eco Home\\" but realised the land they were building on belonged to Matthew King (Matt Healy) and the local council. Donna had a major run in with Marlon's family when she reported Shadrach (Andy Devine) to the police for theft. Called up before the Dingle Court, Donna defied Zak and Lisa Dingle (Jane Cox), revealing she planned to join the police force. Marlon backed her up and they stood strong together. In October 2006, two men were looking for Marlon's brother Eli (Joe Gilgun) and broke into The Woolpack to get Marlon to tell them where Eli was, although Marlon didn't know. The pair wrecked the pub, beat up Marlon and stole thousands from the till. The men were later arrested after Eli framed them for firearm possession. In December, Lilith left her children with Marlon and Donna again while she went to work. Marlon, Donna and the children moved into The Woolpack, following Lilith's arrest for armed robbery. This didn't work out and Marlon decided the children should live with their uncle because his and Donna's living arrangements were inadequate. Donna was very upset and the children returned after running away from their uncle. Marlon saw how miserable they were and they went on the run, rather than return them to their uncle. However, they were soon caught by the police and Social Services took the children away. Marlon and Donna applied for custody of their children via the courts and prepared a room for the children but Val Lambert (Charlie Hardwick) accidentally started a fire in The Woolpack, damaging the building temporarily. Despite a positive report, their social worker, Mrs Jenkins, told them that they wouldn't get the kids until they had more suitable accommodation. Marlon is shot accidentally by Eli in the robbery (2007). Marlon, attempting to improve his and Donna's financial problems, used their savings to place a bet. He won ¬£18,000 but the bookie refused to pay up so he and Eli came up with a plan to get his winnings. Just before Eli went into the bookie's, Marlon found he had a gun and learned Eli was planning an armed robbery. Marlon was shocked but let him go ahead. Eli threatened the bookie and was almost successful when a customer came in and a fight ensued. Marlon, who had been waiting in the car, got frustrated and went inside to find Eli struggling with the customer. Pretending not to know him, Marlon yelled at Eli to leave but he wouldn't. Marlon went to grab the gun but it went off, hitting Marlon in the chest. Marlon collapsed, telling Eli to go, leaving the customer and the bookie to ring the police. Marlon was rushed to hospital and made a full recovery. Marlon is put in the paper as a hero. Marlon is filled with guilt when the grateful bookie turns up to give him his winnings and when Donna even praised him for stopping the robbery. With the money, Marlon and Donna purchase a house, hoping to raise their family there. However, Marlon later told Donna the truth and although she was very angry, quickly forgave him. Eli began blackmailing them. He got Donna to use her position in the police force to allow him to break into a warehouse. While at the warehouse, Marlon got cold feet and warned Eli that it was a trap. Eli was angry, but Donna had informed Zak of everything that had happened. Zak confronted Eli and kicked him out of Donna and Marlon's house. However, far from it all being over, Marlon set off to work only for Eli to kidnap him. Bundled into the back of a van, Eli drove him to the top of a multi-storey carpark, where he pretended he was going to throw him off the edge of the building to punish him for his 'betrayal'. Marlon was terrified, unsure of what his volatile brother was capable of, and asked what he had ever done to Eli. Eli revealed that he had always resented his older brother because everybody loved him and nobody had ever loved Eli. Marlon eventually managed to get free and the brothers had a fight which ended with Eli toppling over the edge of the building and only hanging on by his fingertips. Marlon tried to save him - offering his hand - but Eli refused to be rescued. Eventually Donna arrived and helped Marlon haul him to safety, but Eli ran off, apparently upset at being saved. Marlon broke down in tears and later confessed to Donna that he had considered allowing his younger brother to die and he thought that made him a terrible person. He warned Donna that being with him might only cause her trouble, but Donna reassured him. In 2008, The Woolpack was entered in a magazine Pub of the Year competition. Val bribed Jasmine Thomas (Jenna-Louise Coleman) to tell her when the judge was coming. Marlon, Val and Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) went frantic with Marlon trying to create a gourmet menu. Diane reminded him that they were a traditional pub and not to get worked up about it. Unbelievably, they discovered they made it to the finals. Antony Worrall Thompson was discovered to be the celebrity judge. This coincided with Val's surprise wedding to Eric. Anthony was impressed with Marlon's cooking and asked Marlon to call him. When Marlon summed up the courage to call, Marlon was invited to a local television audition. A camera crew arrived at The Woolpack to record a programme featuring a special from Marlon. Marlon hired Jake Doland (James Baxter) to help him in the kitchen and also had a column in The Hotton Courier. Marlon was later approached by the owner of Malt, The Woolpack's rival pub. He offered Marlon a better job with better pay but Marlon declined, wanting to stay in Emmerdale. In 2008, Viv, was arrested for fraud. However, Viv had been framed by Freddie Yorke (Keith Woodason). Donna found it hard, knowing her colleagues knew about her family situation. Wanting to prove her mother's innocence, she started going on unofficial stakeouts with colleague Ross Kirk (Samuel Anderson). After some time searching, they discovered where he lived. Donna tried to apprehend him but Freddie escaped. Donna followed closely at high speed but she lost control of the car and crashed. Ross pulled them from the car before it exploded and Donna spent months in hospital learning how to walk again. She became convinced she was a laughing stock at the station and decided to resign. Marlon was thrilled but when Donna came home, he saw she was miserable. He told her that he'd support her if she wanted to return to work. In September, Donna and Marlon attended a police comedy night. Marlon's cousin Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter), Ross's date, got into a fight with the comedian. Marlon defended her and the fight ended with Marlon and Chas being thrown out. Marlon took Chas home, leaving Donna with Ross. Donna and Ross shared a night of passion in Donna's hotel room which Donna regretted afterwards. She and Marlon decided to go on holiday. When they returned, Marlon announced he and Donna were planning to start a family but Ross tried to convince Donna that would be a mistake. He also told her that she had married too young. On 1 January 2009, Donna told Marlon of her affair with Ross. Marlon had suspected it but was still devastated, especially when Donna said she loved Ross and Marlon. Hellbent on revenge, Marlon went to the police and implicated Ross in the murder of Shane Doyle (Paul McEwan). He gradually started to warm to Donna and was considering taking her back, although Zak warned him against it. After a conversation with Eli, who reminded him that Donna had forgiven Marlon for the raid on the bookies, Marlon agreed to give his marriage another go - on the condition that she never saw Ross again. Donna agreed, but she was certain that Ross was innocent and broke her promise to Marlon, visiting her ex-lover in prison. Meanwhile, the other Dingles remained hostile towards her and she got a very cold reception at Zak's birthday party. Surprisingly, Eli came to Donna's defence, for which Marlon was grateful. However, during a conversation with Eli, Donna noticed a vital piece of evidence that could clear Ross's name and she shopped her brother-in-law to the police. When Marlon realised that Donna had betrayed both him and his family in order to free Ross, he dumped her and later asked for a divorce. They might have reconciled had not Donna caught Marlon in a drunken clinch with his cousin Chastity. Following this, Donna departed the village - seemingly for good - leaving behind a devastated Marlon. To make matters worse, Marlon's best friend Paddy (who is in love with Chas) also found out about the kiss and the two of them fell out for quite a while. Following a period of depression, Marlon dedicated himself to helping little brother Eli, who had been disowned by the rest of the Dingle clan after his confession led to the arrest of Debbie. The pair came up with several plots to try and set her free. Faced with Debbie's release, Eli went missing for a time, but Marlon eventually found him sleeping rough and managed to convince his wayward sibling to come home. The two brothers lived together until Eli's departure in 2010, along with Lizzie Lakely (Kitty McGeever), a blind woman who Marlon befriended. Lizzie upset Marlon when she preyed on his gullibility by pretending to be a psychic, causing Marlon to spend a fortune on phone bills pouring his heart out to her. He got his revenge by tricking her into paying back his money. His life was going smoothly until Moira Barton (Natalie J. Robb) began to work in The Woolpack. Marlon had a previous confrontation with Moira when she criticised his cooking. The two argued furiously at work as Marlon felt that she was invading his domain and finding fault with his food on purpose. It reached boiling point and Moira quit, which led to an angry Diane giving Marlon the cold-shoulder until he apologised. Marlon did so and Moira returned to work, as Marlon explained that since Donna left him, his job was the one area in his life where he felt in control and Moira had threatened that. They reached an understanding and became friends. When Marlon received a letter from Donna, saying that she had met someone else and wanted him to file for divorce, a devastated Marlon found himself turning to Moira as a shoulder to cry on. Because of this, he developed romantic feelings for her and convinced himself that she felt the same way. Going against Paddy's advice, Marlon finally confessed to Moira that he thought he was falling in love with her, leaving her shocked. She let him down and Marlon was left feeling humiliated. After a long heart-to-heart, she convinced him that she was flattered and that he would one day meet the right woman. Alongside this, Marlon also took in Charity and her young son, Noah (Jack Downham) after the family turned against her for trying to steal Cain's money. When Zak and Cain found out, they were angry and Cain punched Marlon in the stomach. In 2010, Rhona returned to the village of Emmerdale. She and Marlon re-began a relationship, until Rhona expressed an interest in Marlon's best mate and her work partner Paddy Kirk. She split up with Marlon, and began a relationship with Paddy, much to Marlon's despair. It was later revealed that Rhona was expecting Marlon's baby, while she was still with Paddy. Marlon was very upset and told Rhona he did not want to be the part of the baby's life. He refused to go to Rhona's first scan. On Monday 13 December 2010, it was revealed that there was a possibility that Marlon and Rhona's baby may suffer from Down syndrome. It was later confirmed. On Monday 20 December 2010, Rhona decided she was going to go ahead with the pregnancy, and Marlon and Paddy backed her up happily. The trio are all now good friends again. In January 2011, Marlon admitted to his housemate and colleague Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw) that his and Rhona's baby was going to suffer from Down syndrome. Later in the evening, Marlon comforted Bob after his wife, Viv, and best friend Terry Woods died in an arson attack caused by Katie Sugden's (Sammy Winward) new boyfriend, Nick Henshall (Michael McKell). Soon after this, he told his friend Laurel Thomas (Charlotte Bellamy) about the baby's Down syndrome. On Tuesday 1 February 2011, Marlon, Rhona and Paddy went for a scan of the baby, and learned that its heart rate was healthy. When the boy was born, he was named Leo, and Marlon became a very proud father. In the summer of 2012, Marlon and Laurel became a couple after a year of love and attraction between them. This caused major problems for Laurel's marriage to Ashley Thomas (John Middleton), who started abusing his father Sandy Thomas (Freddie Jones) as a result of the stress of trying to make the marriage work. When Laurel discovered this, it signaled the final blow for the couple. With Marlon, Laurel is now maintaining a friendship with Ashley. Marlon let Ashley move in with him after he had nowhere else to go, having moved out of the marital home, where Laurel remained with Sandy and the kids. The children struggled to cope following the recent events, particularly Gabby (Annelise Manojlovic), whose biological mother Bernice returned to the village in November. In late 2012, Marlon became involved in a row and custody battle with Paddy and Rhona, who wanted to move to New Zealand for a couple of years, with Leo. They eventually decided not to move to New Zealand. Paddy and Marlon resumed their friendship but kept it a secret from Laurel and Rhona. Eventually the two couples reconciled completely and have stayed on good terms. In October 2013, he is attacked by serial killer Cameron Murray (Dominic Power) and is knocked out cold in the flooding Woolpack cellar. Cameron later takes people hostage but eventually lets them go except for Chas and Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb). He later escapes from the cellar and holds Cameron at gunpoint while Chas and Debbie attempt to escape. Marlon then runs to the cellar (now flooding to the top) but Cameron follows. After nearly drowning the three,Cameron is electrocuted. Marlon is put in the paper as a 2nd hero after what happened with Eli and the Bookie years back. He later tells Laurel the truth, she is angry but later forgives him. Donna dies and Marlon is awarded custody of April his long lost daughter. He marries Laurel but is devastated when she becomes an alcoholic. In February 2016, Marlon learns from Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) that Chas' son, Aaron Dingle (Danny Miller) was repeatedly raped by his father, Gordon Livesy (Gary Mavers) throughout his childhood. In 2018, Marlon got married a fourth time to Jessie Grant on 25 December 2018 (Christmas Day) as a surprise wedding that he didn't know about. In January 2020 Marlon is arrested and fitted up for killing Graham before getting in a fight with bosses. In June, he opens up to Al about what happened at the Bookie years back. Reception In 2005, Charnock was nominated for and won a British Soap Award for Best Dramatic Performance, after the death of his wife Tricia Dingle, and was nominated again in 2011 for Best Actor. The episode 'The Betrayed' was also nominated for Best Single Episode at the 2011 British Soap Awards. The Northern Echo's Steve Pratt said Marlon does not have the best of luck with women.

Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1976, 15, 639. While the related 1,2-addition reaction, the benzoin condensation, was known since the 1830s, the Stetter reaction was not reported until 1973 by Dr. Hermann Stetter.Stetter, H. and Schreckenberg, M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1973, 12, 81. The reaction provides synthetically useful 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds and related derivatives from aldehydes and Michael acceptors. Unlike 1,3-dicarbonyls, which are easily accessed through the Claisen condensation, or 1,5-dicarbonyls, which are commonly made using a Michael reaction, 1,4-dicarbonyls are challenging substrates to synthesize, yet are valuable starting materials for several organic transformations, including the Paal‚ÄìKnorr synthesis of furans and pyrroles. Traditionally utilized catalysts for the Stetter reaction are thiazolium salts and cyanide anion, but more recent work toward the asymmetric Stetter reaction has found triazolium salts to be effective. The Stetter reaction is an example of umpolung chemistry, as the inherent polarity of the aldehyde is reversed by the addition of the catalyst to the aldehyde, rendering the carbon center nucleophilic rather than electrophilic. Scheme 1. Stetter reaction overview Mechanism As the Stetter reaction is an example of umpolung chemistry, the aldehyde is converted from an electrophile to a nucleophile under the reaction conditions.Albright, J. D. Tetrahedron 1983, 39, 3207. This is accomplished by activation from some catalyst - either cyanide (CN‚àí) or thiazolium salt. For the use of either catalyst, the mechanism is very similar; the only difference is that with thiazolium salts, the catalyst must be deprotonated first to form the active catalytic species. The active catalyst can be described as the combination of two contributing resonance forms - an ylide or a carbene, both of which portray the nucleophilic character at carbon. The thiazolium ylide or CN‚àí can then add into the aldehyde substrate, forming a cyanohydrin in the case of CN‚àí or the Breslow intermediate in the case of thiazolium salt. The Breslow intermediate was proposed by Ronald Breslow in 1958 and is a common intermediate for all thiamine-catalyzed reactions, whether in vitro or in vivo.Breslow, R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958, 80, 3719. Scheme 2. Formation of the Breslow intermediate Once the \\"nucleophilic aldehyde\\" synthon is formed, whether as a cyanohydrin or stabilized by a thiazolium ylide, the reaction can proceed down two pathways. The faster pathway is self-condensation with another molecule of aldehyde to give benzoin products. However, benzoin condensation is completely reversible, and therefore does not interfere with product formation in the Stetter reaction. In fact, benzoins can be used instead of aldehydes as substrates to achieve the same overall Stetter transformation, because benzoins can be restored to their aldehyde precursors under the reaction conditions. The desired pathway toward the Stetter product is the 1,4-addition of the nucleophilic aldehyde to a Michael-type acceptor. After 1,4-addition, the reaction is irreversible and ultimately, the 1,4-dicarbonyl is formed when the catalyst is kicked out to regenerate CN‚àí or the thiazolium ylide. Scheme 3. Mechanism of the Stetter reaction Scope The Stetter reaction produces classically difficult to access 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds and related derivatives. The traditional Stetter reaction is quite versatile, working on a wide variety of substrates. Aromatic aldehydes, heteroaromatic aldehydes, and benzoins can all be used as acyl anion precursors with thiazolium salt and cyanide catalysts. However, aliphatic aldehydes can only be utilized if a thiazolium salt is used as a catalyst, as they undergo aldol condensation side reaction when a cyanide catalyst is used. In addition, Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated esters, ketones, nitriles, nitros, and aldehydes are all appropriate Michael acceptors with either catalyst. However, the general scope of asymmetric Stetter reactions is more limited. Intramolecular asymmetric Stetter reactions enjoy a range of acceptable Michael acceptors and acyl anion precursors in essentially any combination.de Alaniz, J. R.; Kerr, M. S.; Moore, J. L.; Rovis, T. J. Org. Chem. 2008, 73, 2033. Intramolecular asymmetric Stetter reactions can utilize aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic aldehydes with a tethered Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ester, ketone, thioester, malonate, nitrile or Weinreb amide. It has been shown that Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated nitros and aldehydes are not suitable Michael acceptors and have markedly decreased enantiomeric excess in such reactions. Another limitation encountered with intramolecular asymmetric Stetter reactions is that only substrates that result in the formation of a six-membered ring show synthetically useful enantiomeric excess; substrates which form five and seven-membered rings either do not react or show low stereoinduction. On the other hand, intermolecular asymmetric reactions are quite confined to specifically matched combinations of acyl anion precursor and Michael acceptor, such as an aliphatic aldehyde with a nitroalkene.Jousseaume, T.; Wurz, N. E.; Glorius, F. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2011, 50, 1410. In addition, these substrates tend to be rather activated, as the intermolecular asymmetric Stetter reaction is still in the early stages of development. Scheme 4. Scope of Stetter Reaction Variations Several variations of the Stetter reaction have been developed since its discovery in 1973. In 2001, Murry et al reported a Stetter reaction of aromatic aldehydes onto acylimine derivatives to give Œ±-amido ketone products.Murry, J. A.; Frantz, D. E.; Soheili, A.; Tillyer, R.; Grabowski, E. J. J.; Reider, P. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 9696. The acylimine acceptors were generated in situ from Œ±-tosylamide substrates, which underwent elimination in the presence of base. Good to excellent yields (75-90%) were observed. Mechanistic investigations showed that the corresponding benzoins were not adequate substrates, contrary to traditional Stetter reactions. From this, the authors conclude the Stetter reaction of acylimines is under kinetic control, rather than thermodynamic control. Scheme 5. Stetter reaction with acylimines as acceptors Another variation of the Stetter reaction involves the use of 1,2-dicarbonyls as precursors to the acyl anion intermediate. In 2005, Scheidt and coworkers reported the use of sodium pyruvate, which loses CO2 to form the Breslow intermediate.Myers, M. C.; Bharadwaj, A. R.; Milgram, B. C.; Scheidt, K. A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 14675. Similarly, in 2011 Bortolini and coworkers demonstrated the use of Œ±-diketones to generate an acyl anion.Bortolini, O.; Fantin, G.; Fogagnolo, M.; Giovannini, P. P.; Massi, A.; Pacifico, S. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2011, 9, 8437. Under the conditions they developed, 2,3-butadienone is cleaved after addition to the thiazolium catalyst to release ethyl acetate and generate the Breslow intermediate necessary for the Stetter reaction to proceed. Scheme 6. Stetter reaction with acyclic Œ±-diketones In addition, they showed the atom economy and utility of using a cyclic Œ±-diketone to generate the Stetter product with a tethered ethyl ester. The reaction precedes through the same mechanism as the acyclic version, but the ester generated by attack of ethanol remains tethered to the product. However, the conditions only allow for the generation of ethyl esters, due to the necessity of ethanol as solvent. Substitution of ethanol with tert-butanol resulted in no product. The authors speculate this is due to the difference in acidity between the two alcoholic solvents. Scheme 7. Stetter reaction with cyclic Œ±-diketones In 2004, Scheidt and coworkers introduced acyl silanes as competent substrates in the Stetter reaction, a variation they termed the \\"sila-Stetter reaction.\\"Mattson, A. E.; Bharadwaj, A. R.; Scheidt, K. A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 2314. Under their reaction conditions, the thiazolium catalyst induces a [1,2] Brook rearrangement, which is followed by desilylation by an isopropanol additive to give the common Breslow intermediate of the traditional Stetter reaction. The desilylation step was found to be necessary, and the reaction does not proceed without an alcoholic additive. Acyl silanes are less electrophilic than the corresponding aldehydes, preventing typical benzoin-type byproducts often observed in the Stetter reaction.Mattson, A. E.; Bharadwaj, A. R.; Zuhl, A. M.; Scheidt, K. A. \\"Thiazolium-Catalyzed Additions of Acylsilanes: A General Strategy for Acyl Anion Addition Reactions.\\" J. Org. Chem. 2006, 71, 5715. Scheme 8. Sila-Stetter reaction Asymmetric Stetter Reaction The first asymmetric variant of the Stetter reaction was reported in 1996 by Enders et al, employing a chiral triazolium catalyst 1.Enders, D.; Breuer K.; Runsink, J.; Teles, J. H. Helv. Chim. Acta 1996, 79, 1899. Subsequently, several other catalysts were reported for asymmetric Stetter reactions, including 2,Kerr, M. S.; de Alaniz, J. R.; Rovis, T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 10298. 3,Pesch, J.; Harms, K.; Bach, T. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2004, 2025. and 4.Mennen, S. M.; Blank, J. T.; Tran-Dub√©, M. B.; Imbriglio, J. E.; Miller, S. J. Chem. Commun. 2005, 195. Scheme 9. First Asymmetric Stetter Reactions The success of the Rovis group's catalyst 2 led them to further explore this family of catalysts and expand their use for asymmetric Stetter reactions. In 2004, they reported the enantioselective formation of quaternary centers from aromatic aldehydes in an intramolecular Stetter reaction with a slightly modified catalyst.Kerr, M. S.; Rovis, T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 8876. Further work extended the scope of this reaction to include aliphatic aldehydes as well.Moore, J. L.; Kerr, M. S.; Rovis, T. Tetrahedron 2006, 62, 11477. Subsequently, it was shown that the olefin geometry of the Michael acceptor dictates diastereoselectivity in these reactions, whereby the catalyst dictates the enantioselectivity of the initial carbon bond formation and allylic strain minimization dictates the diastereoselective intramolecular protonation.de Alaniz, J. R.; Rovis, T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 6284. Scheme 10. Formation of quaternary centers The inherent difficulties of controlling enantioselectivity in intermolecular reactions made the development of an intermolecular asymmetric Stetter reaction a challenge. While limited enantiomeric excess had been reported by Enders in the early 1990s for the reaction of n-butanal with chalcone,Enders, D. Enzymemimetic C-C and C-N Bond Formations. In Stereoselective Synthesis; Ottow, E., Schoellkopf, K., Schulz, B.-G., eds.; Springer-Verlag: Berlin- Heidelberg, 1994; pp 63-90. conditions for a synthetically useful asymmetric intermolecular Stetter reaction were not reported until 2008 when both the groups of Enders and Rovis published such reactions. The Enders group utilized a triazolium-based catalyst to effect the coupling of aromatic aldehydes with chalcone derivatives with moderate yields.Enders, D.; Han, J.; Henseler, A. Chem. Commun. 2008, 3989. The concurrent publication from the Rovis group also employed a triazolium-based catalyst and reported the Stetter reaction between glyoxamides and alkylidenemalonates in good to excellent yields.Liu, Q.; Perreault, S.; Rovis, T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 14066. Scheme 12. First Asymmetric Intermolecular Stetter Reactions Rovis and coworkers subsequently went on to explore the asymmetric intermolecular Stetter reaction of heterocyclic aldehydes and nitroalkenes.DiRocco, D. A.; Oberg, K. M.; Dalton, D. M.; Rovis, T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 10872. During optimization of this reaction, it was found that a catalyst with a fluorinated backbone greatly enhanced enantioselectivity in the reaction. It was proposed that the fluorinated backbone helps to lock the conformation of the catalyst in a way the increases enantioselectivity. Further computational studies on this system verified that the stereoelectronic attraction between the developing partial negative charge on the nitroalkene in the transition state and the partial positive charge of the C-F dipole is responsible for the increase in enantiomeric excess observed with the use of the catalyst with backbone fluorination.Um, J. M.; DiRocco, D. A.; Noey, E. L.; Rovis, T.; Houk, K. N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 11249. While this is a marked advance in the area of intermolecular asymmetric Stetter reactions, the substrate scope is limited and the catalyst is optimized for the specific substrates being utilized. Scheme 13. Asymmetric Intermolecular Stetter Reaction with Nitroalkenes Another contribution to the development of asymmetric intermolecular Stetter reactions came from Glorius and coworkers in 2011. They demonstrated the synthesis of Œ±-amino acids enantioselectively by utilizing N-acylamido acrylate as the conjugate acceptor. Significantly, the reaction can be run on a 5 mmol scale without loss of yield or enantioselectivity. Scheme 14. Enantioselective synthesis of amino acids with intermolecular Stetter reaction Applications The Stetter reaction is an effective tool in organic synthesis. The products of the Stetter reaction, 1,4-dicarbonyls, are valuable moieties for the synthesis of complex molecules. For example, Trost and coworkers employed a Stetter reaction as one step in their synthesis of rac- hirsutic acid C.Trost, B.M.; Shuey, C. D.; DiNinno, F., Jr.; McElvain, S. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979, 101, 1284. The intramolecular coupling of an aliphatic aldehyde with a tethered Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ester led to the desired tricyclic 1,4-dicarbonyl in 67% yield. This intermediate was converted into rac-hirsutic acid C in seven more steps. Scheme 15. Total synthesis of hirsutic acid c utilizing an intramolecular Stetter reaction The Stetter reaction is commonly used in sequence with the Paal-Knorr synthesis of furans and pyrroles, which a 1,4-dicarbonyl undergoes condensation with itself or in the presence of an amine under high temperature, acidic conditions. In 2001, Tius and coworkers reported the asymmetric total synthesis of roseophilin utilizing an intermolecular Stetter reaction to couple an aliphatic aldehyde with a cyclic enone.Harrington, P. E.; Tius, M. A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 8509. After ring-closing metathesis and alkene reduction, the 1,4-dicarbonyl product was converted to a pyrrole via the Paal-Knorr synthesis and further elaborated to the natural product. Scheme 16. Total synthesis of roseophilin utilizing an intermolecular Stetter reaction and Paal-Knorr pyrrole synthesis In 2004, a one-pot coupling-isomerization-Stetter-Paal Knorr sequence was reported.Braun, R. U.; M√ºller, T. J. J. Synthesis 2004, 14, 2391. This procedure first utilizes palladium cross-coupling chemistry to couple aryl halides with propargylic alcohols to give Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones, which can then undergo a Stetter reaction with an aldehyde. Once the 1,4-dicarbonyl compound is formed, heating in the presence of acid will give the furan, while heating in the presence of ammonium chloride and acid will give the pyrrole. The entire sequence is performed in one-pot with no work-up or purification between steps. Scheme 17. One-pot coupling-isomerization-Stetter-Paal Knorr sequence Ma and coworkers developed an alternative method for accessing furans utilizing the Stetter reaction.Ma, C.; Yang, Y. Org Lett. 2005, 7,1343. In their report, 3-aminofurans are synthesized under Stetter conditions for coupling aromatic aldehydes with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), whereby the thiazolium ylide is hydrolyzed by the aromatization of the furan product. As the thiazolium is destroyed under these conditions, it is not catalytic and must be used in stoichiometric quantities. Scheme 18. Synthesis of 3-aminofurans using Stetter chemistry They further elaborated on this work by developing a method in which 2-aminofurans are synthesized by cyclization onto a nitrile.Liu, P.; Lei, M.; Ma, L.; Hu, L. Synlett 2011, 8, 1133. In this method, the thiazolium ylide is employed catalytically and the free amine product is generated. Scheme 19.

Most of the film was shot at the village of Cre≈£ule≈üti some kilometers from Bucharest and some of the actors are local Romani people. Plot St√©phane, a young French man from Paris, travels to Romania. He is looking for the singer Nora Luca, whom his father had heard all the time before his death. Wandering along a frozen road, he meets old Izidor, a Rom and tries tell him of Nora Luca. Drunken Izidor only hears the handful of Romani words and takes St√©phane to his village, determined to teach the boy the Romani language. St√©phane believes that Izidor will take him to Nora Luca when the time has come, so he lives in the Roma village for several months in Izidor's house, as Izidor's son Adriani has been arrested. Izidor is happy to have him as a guest, calling him \\"his Frenchman\\" and fixing the young wanderer's worn-out shoes. The other Roma dislike St√©phane at first, insulting him in their language and believing him to be a lunatic, tricking him into saying rude words and even into entering a tent where women are bathing. St√©phane gradually wins them over by showing his respect for their music and culture and is rewarded with an intimate look into every aspect of Roma life, from a raucous wedding to a bittersweet funeral. The only person in the village who speaks any French is the young Sabina, a divorced Romani dancer who is blatantly hostile towards him at first, but the pair eventually bond through a series of trips across the countryside to record traditional Romani music. One day, just as the pair are beginning to make love for the first time, Adriani returns after many months in jail. The village rejoices, but the men soon have to leave to work at a performance and the two lovebirds sneak off to be together. While they are away, Adriani goes to the local bar, where he murders a man that he accuses of being responsible for his imprisonment. Adriani escapes, but a mob follows him and burns the village to the ground, killing him. St√©phane and Sabina return to find the smoldering ruins and are both devastated. They hurry to the concert venue and tell Izidor, who races outside and begs the earth to open and reunite him with his son. St√©phane leaves the village and drives to the mile marker where the film opened. Grief-stricken, he smashes all the tapes he recorded during his travels with Sabina on the stone marker and buries them. He then drinks from a vodka bottle, spills some on the \\"grave\\" of the tapes, lays the bottle of the \\"grave\\" and then dances as Izidor did at his brother's funeral. A shot of the back of the car reveals Sabina sleeping in the back seat. She wakes up, notices the impromptu \\"funeral\\" that St√©phane is holding and smiles before the screen fades to black.

The Romani people, so often accused of numerous crimes and demonized by outsiders, are shown as predominantly positive, yet wronged figures. They at first fear St√©phane, accusing him much in the way they themselves are accused by the local non- Roma, fearing he will steal from them or kidnap the children (both are racist stereotypes falsely associated with Romani people). Initially, their fears seem absurd, yet it becomes clear that these are the very prejudices that Romani people must endure every day. Music plays another major role in the film, echoing Gatlif's magnum opus, Latcho Drom. St√©phane cannot communicate with the Roma without help and vice versa, but his passion for their music helps the lack of communication and aids in healing their prejudices.

She is best remembered for founding and publishing the Women's Suffrage Journal between 1870 and 1890. Biography Born in Cooper Street, Manchester, the oldest daughter of Hannibal Becker, whose father, Ernst Becker had emigrated from Ohrdruf in Thuringia. Becker was educated at home, like many girls at the time. Intellectually curious, she studied botany and astronomy from the 1850s onwards, winning a gold medal for an 1862 scholarly paper on horticulture.Holton, p. 22. An uncle, rather than her parents, encouraged this interest. Five years later, she founded the Ladies' Literary Society in Manchester. She began a correspondence with Charles Darwin and soon afterwards convinced him to send a paper to the society. In the course of their correspondence, Becker sent a number of plant samples to Darwin from the fields surrounding Manchester. She also forwarded Darwin a copy of her \\"little book\\", Botany for Novices (1864). Becker is one of a number of 19th-century women who contributed, often routinely, to Darwin's scientific work.'Women and Science' section of the 'Darwin & Gender' resources of the Darwin Correspondence Project Her correspondence and work alike suggest that Becker had a particular interest in bisexual and hermaphroditic plants which, perhaps, offered her powerful 'natural' evidence of radical, alternative sexual and social order.Bernstein, S. D., '‚ÄòSupposed Differences': Lydia Becker and Victorian Women's Participation in the BAAS' in Clifford, D., Wadge, E., Warwick, A., & Willis, M. (eds.), Repositioning Victorian Society: Shifting Centres in Nineteenth-Century Scientific Thinking (London, 2006). She was also recognised for her own scientific contributions, being awarded a national prize in the 1860s for a collection of dried plants prepared using a method that she had devised so that they retained their original colours. She gave a botanical paper to the 1869 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science about the effect of fungal infection on sexual development in a plant species Botany remained important to her, but her work for women's suffrage took over the central role in her life. Her involvement in promoting and encouraging scientific education for girls and women brought these two aspects together.  Role in women's suffrage  In autumn 1866 Becker attended the annual meeting of the National Association for the Advancement of Social Science, where she was excited by a paper from Barbara Bodichon entitled \\"Reasons for the Enfranchisement of Women\\". She dedicated herself to organising around the issue, and in January 1867 convened the first meeting of the Manchester Women's Suffrage Committee, one of the first organisations of its kind in England.Liddington and Norris, p. 70; Fulford, pp. 54‚Äì55. She got to know there Dr. Richard Pankhurst, known as 'the red Doctor' whom Becker described as 'a very clever little man with some extraordinary sentiments about life in general and women in particular'. He married Emmeline in 1879. Several months later, a widowed shop owner, Lilly Maxwell, mistakenly appeared on the register of voters in Manchester. She was not the first but she was a good opportunity for publicity. Becker visited Maxwell and escorted her to the polling station. The returning officer found Maxwell's name on the list and allowed her to vote. Becker immediately began encouraging other women heads of households in the region to petition for their names to appear on the rolls. Their claims were presented in court by Sir John Coleridge and Richard Pankhurst in Chorlton v. Lings, but the case was dismissed.Liddington and Norris, p. 71; Phillips, p. 103; Fulford, pp. 63‚Äì64. On 14 April 1868, the first public meeting of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. The three main speakers were Agnes Pochin, Anne Robinson and Becker.The Struggle for Suffrage, English Heritage The meeting was presided over by Priscilla Bright McLaren.The Woman's Signal, 2 January 1896 Becker moved the resolution that women should be granted voting rights on the same terms as men. Becker subsequently commenced a lecture tour of northern cities on behalf of the society. In June 1869, Becker and fellow campaigners were successful in securing the vote for women in municipal elections.Herbet, pp 37‚Äì38 Having campaigned for the inclusion of women on school boards, in 1870 she was one of four women elected to the Manchester School Board on which she served until her death. In the same year Becker and her friend Jessie Boucherett founded the Women's Suffrage Journal and soon afterward began organising speaking tours of women ‚Äì a rarity in Britain at the time.Phillips, p. 132. At an 1874 speaking event in Manchester organised by Becker, fifteen-year-old Emmeline Pankhurst experienced her first public gathering in the name of women's suffrage.Bartley, Paula. Emmeline Pankhurst. London: Routledge, 2002. . p. 22. The Journal was the most popular publication relating to women's suffrage in 19th-century Britain. Roger Fulford, in his study of the movement Votes for Women: The Story of a Struggle, writes: \\"The history of the decades from 1860 to 1890 ‚Äì so far as women's suffrage is concerned ‚Äì is the history of Miss Becker.\\"Fulford, p. 78. The Journal published speeches from around the country, both within and outside of Parliament. Becker published her correspondence with her supporters and her opponents, notably in 1870, when she chastised the MP for Caernarvonshire after he voted against a proposal offering women the vote.Fulford, pp. 77‚Äì78. In 1880, Becker and co-workers campaigned in the Isle of Man for the right of women to vote in the House of Keys elections. Unexpectedly, they were successful and they secured for women voting rights in the Isle of Man for the first time in the elections of March 1881.Herbet, P39. Becker became the chair of the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage. This organisation had been formed in 1871 to lobby parliament. Other committee members included Helen Blackburn, Millicent Fawcett, Jessie Boucherett, Eva McLaren, Margaret Bright Lucas, Priscilla Bright McLaren and Frances Power Cobbe. Becker differed from many early feminists in her disputation of essentialised femininity. Arguing there was no natural difference between the intellect of men and women, Becker was a vocal advocate of a non-gendered education system in Britain.\\"Lydia Becker ‚Äì The Life and Times\\". Famous Chaddertonians. Chadderton Historical Society. 25 May 2008. Accessed on 6 August 2008. She also differed with many suffrage activists in arguing more strenuously for the voting rights of unmarried women. Women connected to husbands and stable sources of income, Becker believed, were less desperately in need of the vote than widows and single women. This attitude made her the target of frequent ridicule in newspaper commentary and editorial cartoons.Liddington and Norris, p. 74.  Death and legacy  In 1890 Becker visited the spa town of Aix-les-Bains, where she fell ill and died of diphtheria, aged 63. Rather than continue publishing in her absence, the staff of the Women's Suffrage Journal decided to cease production. Memorials A book collection by women, with books from Helen Blackburn's collection, her friends and from second hand sources, was placed in two bookcases decorated with paintings of Becker and Caroline Ashurst Biggs, who had been chairs of the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage before Blackburn. These bookcases were given to Girton College and are extant. Becker's name is listed on the south face of the Reformers Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery in London. Her name is also listed on her father's gravestone (Hannibal Becker) in the churchyard of the Parish Church of St James, Altham in Lancashire.. A plaque commemorating her life is situated adjacent to the Moorfield Colliery Memorial on Burnley Road, Altham, (A678) at the junction with Moorfield Way. Becker's name and image, alongside those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters, are etched on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London.

Paddy is one of the longest-serving characters currently in the programme. He has been married three times: to Mandy Dingle (Lisa Riley) in 1999, to Emily Dingle (Kate McGregor) in 2002, and to Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry) in 2012. He has also had several affairs since arriving, notably with Viv Hope (Deena Payne) and Tess Harris (Nicola Stephenson). Brunt took a break from the show with Paddy departing on 18 April 2016 and returning on 29 August 2016. Storylines Paddy comes to Emmerdale as a locum for Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell). He is drawn to Mandy Dingle (Lisa Riley) and they are smitten but their relationship is rocky. Paddy's mother, Barbara (Judi Jones), disapproves of Mandy and offers her money to marry someone else. Needing money to stop her family from being evicted, Mandy takes it and marries her cousin, Butch (Paul Loughran), leaving Paddy depressed. After a bad date with Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles), Paddy proposes to Mandy and she accepts. They marry the following year but over the next two years, Mandy is frequently absent as her father, Caleb, is ill. She misses Paddy but begins an affair with her father's carer and their marriage breaks down. A heartbroken Paddy becomes close to Emily Dingle (Kate McGregor). They begin dating and later get engaged. On the day that Marlon (Mark Charnock) and Tricia Stokes (Sheree Murphy) were supposed to marry, Tricia gets cold feet so Emily and Paddy get married instead. Their marriage is happy and they become foster parents, looking after several children including Debbie Jones (Charley Webb) but over time, the marriage loses its spark. Emily tries to make things work but Paddy tells Emily about his affair with Viv Windsor (Deena Payne), after Viv jokes to Paddy that she told Emily. When it becomes public knowledge, Paddy is punched by Viv's estranged husband, Bob Hope (Antony Audenshaw) and Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell). Soon after, Emily leaves the village with Debbie's baby daughter, Sarah. Paddy begins internet dating and goes to Portugal after Jo Stiles (Roxanne Pallett), plays a practical joke by pretending to be his Internet lover Fireblade and suggesting they meet. He goes but realizes he was tricked and returns with Toni Daggert (Kerry Stacey). A horrified Jo thinks Toni wants Paddy's money and is relieved when Paddy and Toni reveal they were paying her back. Paddy later develops feelings for Toni but she didn't feel the same so he moves on and starts dating Del Dingle (Hayley Tamaddon), making Toni realize that she is in love with Paddy. Toni tries to split them up but it fails but Paddy and Del's relationship ends after Del accidentally burns Toni with hot fat in The Woolpack kitchen. Paddy admits that he loves Toni but the relationship breaks down when Toni learns Paddy does not want to marry her. Paddy's cousin Ross Kirk (Samuel Anderson) comes to the village. One morning, Ross accidentally hits Gennie Walker (Sian Reese-Williams), and knocks her off her moped. Gennie seems fine and Ross, afraid of losing his job, persuades Paddy to say he was responsible. Gennie soon collapses and is intensive care. Ross refuses to own up so Paddy tells Ross's colleague, Shane Doyle (Paul McEwan), what really happened. Shane convinces Paddy that he will be jailed for perverting the course of justice so he remains silent. After he learns about Ross's affair with Marlon's wife, Donna (Verity Rushworth), Paddy throws Ross out. Paddy begins a relationship with Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and deals with her wayward son, Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller). The problems aren't helped by Carl King (Tom Lister), telling Paddy that he and Chas slept together. At first Paddy refuses to believe it, thinking that he was just stirring things but realises it is true and evicts Chas but Aaron convinces him to let him stay. The two grow closer and Paddy acts as a surrogate father to Aaron. He starts to become suspicious of Aaron's behavior and follows him in town, thinking that he is involved with drugs. When he confronts Aaron, he learns that he was meeting with his crush Jackson (Marc Silcock). Paddy realizes that Aaron is gay but Aaron can't handle hearing it and viciously beats him. He is immediately remorseful and the two have a long talk where he admits that he is gay. Paddy promises to keep Aaron's secret but is forced to tell Marlon and later Chas. He takes care of Aaron after his suicide attempt and helps him come to terms with his sexuality. Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry) returns to the village. She and Marlon reignite their relationship but Rhona falls in love with Paddy and ends it with Marlon. Rhona learns she is expecting Marlon's baby and he initially decides not to be part of the baby's life but has a change of heart once he learns that the baby may have Down's Syndrome. They repair their friendship and Rhona gives birth to a baby boy, Leo, in 2011. Paddy gets a job in New Zealand and Marlon decides to go too but changes his mind. The Kirks and Marlon go to court over Leo when Marlon refuses to allow them to take Leo out of the country. Paddy creates a distraction for Rhona and Leo going to New Zealand by fighting with a police officer but has to stay in the country to face charges of assaulting a police officer and his veterinary licence is suspended. This leads to the job in New Zealand being withdrawn and Marlon tells Paddy to tell Rhona to come home voluntarily or risk being arrested for not attending a court hearing and brought back under arrest. Rhona and Leo return and Rhona takes over Paddy's work and gets an old friend, Vanessa Woodfield (Michelle Hardwick), to help her. Paddy resents her for doing his job but he and Vanessa later learn to get on and Vanessa later buys a share of the business. When Paddy's suspension was over, he, Rhona and Vanessa all had their names above the door. Paddy and Rhona's marriage faces a major test after Rhona becomes addicted to the painkillers she was prescribed for a back injury. Paddy and Vanessa become worried as Rhona's mood swings are visible and matters get worse when Rhona begins buying pills from a dealer named Gary, leading her to attack Paddy physically when he confronts her. Eventually, Rhona collapses from taking too many painkillers and is rushed to hospital where she learns that her kidneys are about to collapse. Consequently, Marlon removes Leo and Rhona goes to rehab. Eventually, when Marlon is satisfied that Rhona is capable, Leo returns to live with her and Paddy. Paddy became involved in Aaron's affair with Robert Sugden (Ryan Hawley), after Aaron tells him in February 2015. Paddy and Chas tried to keep Aaron and Robert apart, with little luck. In July, Paddy was worried that Aaron and Robert were continuing their affair and found he was right when he caught them half dressed at the scrapyard. Paddy sent a note to Robert's wife, Chrissie White (Louise Marwood), telling her to 'rein her cheating husband in'. While helping out at the farm, Paddy fell into a grain pit and injured his leg. Robert then turned on the grain pit to scare Paddy after he discovered that Paddy sent the note to his wife. Paddy fell unconscious and was about to drown when Robert turned the machine off and went to help, only to be scared off by Andy Sugden's (Kelvin Fletcher) approach. Paddy spent a night in hospital. He suspected Robert of being responsible and this was confirmed when Robert threatened him and his family. A while later, Paddy told Aaron so Aaron planned a night at a lodge with Robert to get him to confess. Worried what Robert might do, Paddy went to the lodge and was shot by Robert. Paddy helped Robert stitch his wound and persuaded him to let him and Aaron leave but Aaron retaliated by telling Chrissie about his affair with Robert. Paddy demanded Aaron leave Robert alone, telling him that it'd be his fault if something happened to his family. Following the helicopter crash, Paddy discovered Rhona and Marlon had kissed at Debbie Dingle's (Charley Webb) wedding so he set up an online dating profile for Marlon. Marlon invites Paddy to a night out and meets a woman named Tess Harris (Nicola Stephenson). He offloads on her about the situation regarding Robert and Aaron and they end up having sex in her car. Tess turns out to be Leo's teaching assistant, who is also married. They break things off, but resume things after a short while. Feeling broody after Vanessa gives birth to her son, Johnny, Rhona suggests to Paddy that they adopt a child and Paddy eventually agrees. Amongst others, Aaron and Tess are asked to be references for the social worker. After Tess gives her reference, she texts Paddy but Rhona finds the phone and asks why he has a second phone, Paddy says that it's Aaron's and consequently tells him about the affair. Reeling, Aaron tells the social worker that Paddy and Rhona are having marital issues. After Aaron blames Tess, she is furious and reminds Paddy that she can take everything away from him in an instant. In February 2016, Paddy and the Dingles are informed by Cain, that Aaron was sexually abused as a child by his father, Gordon (Gary Mavers). Tess and Paddy's affair comes to an abrupt end when a drunken Kirin Kotecha (Adam Fielding) accidentally kills her. Tess dies during surgery. Rhona learns about the affair after Paddy goes to Tess's funeral but is spotted by Megan Macey (Gaynor Faye). After a series of rows, which includes Paddy telling Rhona about Aaron and Robert's affair, nearly dying in the grain pit, getting shot by Robert and also revealing that Robert killed Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward), Rhona decides that the conversation never happened and that they should continue as normal. Unfortunately they try to make it work but Rhona is haunted by the extent of Paddy's deceit and cannot forgive him so they agree that he should take a new job in Germany and cancel the adoption plans. In October, he is involved in a car pile up, caused by Emma Barton (Gillian Kearney) pushing her husband James Barton (Bill Ward) off a bridge along with several other villagers, such as Rhona and Paddy is badly injured but asks Pierce to help him survive which he does, but in the ambulance, tells him if Rhona doesn't survive then Paddy will suffer. Paddy watches as Rhona gets more and more involved with Pierce but every time someone suggests to Rhona that Pierce isn't quite what he seems to be, she refuses to listen. As they still work together, Pierce reluctantly accepts that Paddy is still part of Rhona's life but when he learns that Rhona and Paddy kissed just before his and Rhona's wedding, he confronts her on their wedding night and rapes her. Rhona reports Pierce to the police but Pierce initially convinces him and Marlon that she's back on the painkillers and making up stories about him to cover herself but Rhona and Vanessa tell them the truth. Disgusted, Paddy and Marlon support Rhona. Paddy and Chas rekindle their relationship. In early 2018, Chas learns that she is pregnant. Paddy is excited to have a baby but is heartbroken when they discover that their child has bilateral renal agenesis and will not survive long after birth. Despite this, they agree to continue with the pregnancy. They make plans to marry, but Chas tells Paddy that she doesn't want to marry him just yet. Chas goes into labor at Aaron and Robert's stag do and gives birth to their daughter Grace who lives for about an hour. During their time together, Paddy imagines the life he and Chas would have had with their daughter. In early 2019, Chas and Paddy learn that they are pregnant again, initially believed to be a boy, who they plan to name Teddy. Paddy's ex-wife Mandy returns to the village with her teenage son Vinny in January for Marlon's surprise wedding to Jessie Grant (Sandra Marvin). Chas initially suspects that Paddy is Vinny's father but Mandy explains that he isn't. She gives Chas and Marlon a letter for Paddy originally from his mother to pro wrestler Bear Wolf (Joshua Richards), explaining that Bear is Paddy's biological father. At first Paddy tries to ignore the revelation but he eventually meets Bear at a convention in Belfast. Bear later arrives at the village and Paddy and Chas allow him to stay with them. He and Paddy begin to form a relationship. Paddy, Chas, and Liv rally around Aaron after Robert is about to be charged with manslaughter. They are able to stop him from going on the run with his husband but he is devastated when Robert turns himself in. Aaron plans to break him out of jail before his sentencing but Paddy and Liv lock him in his house to stop him from leaving. Chas goes into labor at this time while locked in the Woolpack bathrooms. After talking Aaron down, they are freed by Lydia and make it to the pub in time for Paddy to catch the last few seconds of the birth. The baby is revealed to be a girl, who they name Eve.

The station is currently owned by Educational Media Foundation and broadcasts at 93.7 MHz at 1,250 watts ERP from a location near Rotterdam Junction, New York. The station is an O&O; of EMF's Air 1 network. Times Union article accessed February 28, 2006 Corinth history The history of WYAI dates back to December 1981, when 93.5 signed on in Corinth as country station WSCG. WSCG was a live 24-hour-a- day operation throughout the 1980s, that ran into financial difficulties in the early 1990s. In early 1991, WSCG left the air, returning under new ownership in the summer of 1991, as beautiful music station WZZM. WZZM encountered financial problems of its own by early 1993, and left the air itself. It returned to the air, during the summer of 1993, as an Oldies station. It abruptly left the air again in March 1994. It returned to the air in May 1994, still doing oldies, but flipped to country two weeks later as Z-Country 93. In the late 1990s, Bradmark Communications began studies for moving the station down to the Albany market and selling it at a profit. These plans were expanded when Bradmark sold the stations to Vox Media in 2000, which in March 2001, moved the oldies format of 107.1 WHTR to 93.5, and relaunched the Z-Country format as the locally-run WFFG (Froggy 107.1). Galaxy purchased the station in late 2001, and surprisingly retained the WHTR calls with the move, a rarity among move-in stations. Move into Scotia WHTR moved into the Albany market from Corinth (when it was moved to 93.7 MHz to protect WZCR's signal) in 2002, signing on at 3:00 p.m. on April 22, 2001. The call letters initially remained WHTR at that time, and took on the Hot Talk 93.7 name with a hot talk format and simulcast on AM 1400 (the original WABY, now known as WAMC). The station's key personalities were former WPYX morning co-host John Mulrooney in morning drive and the syndicated Opie and Anthony show in afternoon drive; most weekend programming was a simulcast of K-Rock WKRL Syracuse, albeit with local ads. Within four months, Mulrooney was fired and the \\"Sex for Sam\\" incident ended Opie and Anthony's original syndication attempt. Outside of drivetimes, the WKRL simulcasts on WHTR-FM were the highest rated programs on the station (impressive given the presence of two full-time stations, WHRL (now WGY-FM) and WQBK-FM (now WPBZ-FM), in the market). With a hole to quickly fill, on August 30, 2002, the station took on the WKRD calls and flipped to modern rock as K-Rock 93.7. The station became notable for hiring former WGY afternoon host JR Gach for mornings in January 2003 after being released from WGY. This format was simulcast on 1400 until Galaxy sold that station in April 2003. However, on January 22, 2004, WKRD abruptly flipped to classic country as 93.7 The Eagle, taking on the WEGB calls, which were quickly switched to WEGQ to alleviate confusion with television station WRGB. For nearly two years, WEGQ played Dial Global satellite-fed classic country music from the 1960s to 1980s. The station had only one local personality under this format, former WYJB afternoon personality Chris Holmberg who left for Galaxy on the heels of WYJB's first #1 (12+) ratings book. On January 4, 2006, after simulcasting the Eagle format on WRCZ (which was formerly 94 Rock) for about a week, the station relaunched as 93.7/94.5 The Bone, taking on the WOOB calls. The Bone had a mainstream rock format with the tagline Everything That Rocks, and featured J. R. Gach in mornings with co-host Pi and traffic gal Alecia. On February 16, 2007, the Bone format ended anticlimactically right in the middle of the song \\"Ride the River\\" by Eric Clapton, when Galaxy Communications exited the Albany market and sold both stations to Educational Media Fund in a fire sale. WOOB was converted to an Air 1 O&O;, broadcasting a Christian CHR format, and later changed its calls to WYAI several months later on July 6, 2007.

Barltrop grew up in the East End of London, descended from a long line of blacksmiths, although his great-grandfather had become highly successful as a brickmaker and builder, and was responsible for the building of large numbers of houses in Walthamstow. Robert's father Edwin was a horse fodder dealer; Robert won a scholarship to the Sir George Monoux Grammar School in Walthamstow, now Sir George Monoux College. During World War II, he served with the Royal Air Force, but was invalided out with tuberculosis before seeing active service. He was for many years a member of the Socialist Party of Great Britain, and edited their magazine The Socialist Standard. His written contributions were prolific, and he also contributed illustrations of his own making. He had various careers, and at different times was a professional boxer, a labourer, a strip cartoonist, a schoolteacher and a sign-painter. Barltrop also published widely and his books include: The Monument: Story of the Socialist Party of Great Britain (1975), Jack London: The Man, the Writer, the Rebel (1977), Muvver Tongue with Jim Wolveridge (1980), A Funny Age (Growing up in North East London between the Wars) (1985). He was also writing Yes Mush: A Cockney Dictionary: The Cockney Language and Its World, intended to be published in 2004, but remaining unfinished at the end of his life. In the late 1950s, he produced a series of illustrated panels on aspects of the history of Walthamstow, north-east London; these were published weekly in the Walthamstow Guardian. Later, he was a regular contributor to the Newham Recorder newspaper, producing some 1200 illustrated weekly articles for them during a 24-year period up to his death, and contributing also to other Recorder titles. Robert Barltrop was President of the Waltham Forest Local History Society, and was a proud and respected member of the Old Monovians Association, the 'old boys' organisation of the Monoux School. He was admitted to Newham General Hospital but died after a short illness on 26 April 2009.

It was released as the only single from the band's second and final studio album In the Aeroplane Over the Sea in October 1998. \\"Holland, 1945\\" is one of the album's louder, more upbeat songs, featuring overdriven and distorted guitars. The song also showcases fuzz noise on all of the instruments, a quality created by producer Robert Schneider. \\"Holland, 1945\\" was one of the last songs Neutral Milk Hotel frontman Jeff Mangum wrote for In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. It remained untitled until art director Chris Bilheimer asked Mangum what to title the song in the liner notes; when Mangum told him to use either \\"Holland\\" or \\"1945\\", Bilheimer suggested combining the two. Single release The single version of \\"Holland, 1945\\" was released in October 1998. It was the second single released by the band, and was the band's last official release before a decade-long hiatus and their subsequent reunion in 2011. Orange Twin Records released some un-numbered versions through its website. A rare promo CD was released on October 19, 1998. The single contains the b-side track \\"Engine\\", which was recorded live in a London Underground station underneath Piccadilly Circus. In 2011, the single was re-issued as a 7\\" picture disc with a fold-out poster and a different version of \\"Engine\\". Interpretations The song contains references to Anne Frank. In 1945, World War II ended and Anne and her sister Margot died of typhus. The lyric \\"all when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes\\" could be seen as a reference to the White Rose resistance group that existed in Nazi Germany in the early 1940s, though songwriter Jeff Mangum claims that he had never heard of the movement before In the Aeroplane Over the Sea was released. Also referenced in the song is a \\"dark brother wrapped in white\\". In the liner notes for the song, Mangum initialed the letters \\"(h.p.)\\" after the words \\"your dark brother\\". A critic for The Boston Phoenix wrote in 1998 that this \\"dark brother\\" was someone who committed suicide, a family member of one of Mangum's close friends. Legacy In 2010 Pitchfork included the song at number 7 on their list of the \\"Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s\\". \\"Holland, 1945\\" is played during the closing credits of the final episode of The Colbert Report. Slate speculated the song was chosen to pay tribute to host Stephen Colbert's father James William Colbert, Jr. and older brothers Peter and Paul, who were killed in the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 212, when he was 10 years old. Colbert's emotional connection to the song was noted in an article by Maureen Dowd in The New York Times in 2014.

It was influenced by lunchtime concerts organised by Hilda Bor at the Royal Exchange and by Myra Hess at the National Gallery. The driving force in the Society's foundation was Ivan Sutton, with help and encouragement by Bor, who became its Vice-President, and from Edric Cundell, Principal of the Guildhall School of Music, who served as its first President. It was described in an obituary of Sutton as \\"one of the City of London's most remarkable institutions\\".Obituary: Ivan Sutton The Independent, June 28, 1996 The first event, a lecture by Cundell, took place in December 1943 at the Guildhall School, shortly followed by the first concert, a performance by the Morley College Choir, in January 1944. After subsequent Society concerts at the Chartered Insurance Institute and the Royal Exchange, Sutton succeeded in convincing the Goldsmiths' Company to allow the use of its hall for a series of three evening concerts in the autumn of 1946. In the autumn of 1947 the lunchtime concerts moved from the Guildhall School to the Bishopsgate Institute where the opening concert by Louis Kentner attracted a capacity audience. Since then evening concerts at Goldsmith's Hall and Tuesday lunchtime concerts at Bishopsgate Institute have provided the regular framework within which the work of the Society has evolved. The Society, at present, stages around 26 concerts per year and has over 2000 lunchtime and early evening concerts to its credit. It completed its 60th-anniversary season in April 2004. As well as featuring well-established musicians, the Society's policy has always attempted to invite outstanding young professional artists who are at the beginning of their careers to perform at its concerts, many of whom have since attained international status. Furthermore, over the years the Society has commissioned many new works - on average one every three years - from a wide and diverse range of British composers, including Roger Smalley, Nicholas Maw, Diana Burrell, Richard Rodney Bennett, Elizabeth Maconchy, Phyllis Tate, Robin Holloway, John McCabe, Geoffrey Burgon, Peter-Paul Nash, Kevin Volans and Michael Berkeley.

The Tour is the signature attraction at the park, and goes into a working film studio, with various film sets on the Universal Studios Lot. In recent years, guests have sat in multi-car trams for the duration of the ride. The Tour lasts about 45‚Äì60 minutes and is led by a live tour guide who can be seen throughout the tram on video screens. It travels through the Front Lot, Backlot and various attractions, passing sets and props from movies along the way. The tour inspired a smaller but similar version at Universal Studios Florida, which was removed in 1995. History of The Tour The tour has always been at the heart of Universal Studios Hollywood. From 1915, when visitors sat on bleachers for 25 cents, to the 1964 introduction of pink and white Glamor Trams, to the current technological sophistication, the behind- the-scenes view of a working movie studio has been a large attraction of the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park. During the early years of the tram tour (1964‚Äì1965), all of the attractions at Universal were reached via the tram. The tour originally departed from the front lot commissary. In 1965, the upper lot studio tour center opened. As the movie studio has continued to evolve, the tour has evolved along with it. In late 1989, CD players finally gave the tour guides a chance to rest their voices. In 1999, the CD players were replaced by DVD players and LCD screens, allowing the tour guides to show scenes from movies filmed at the locations which the tram passes. In 2009, the LCD screens were upgraded to high-definition screens. In 2011, Jimmy Fallon joined the tour as a video host to supplement the live-action narration and also appeared in some filming scenes, who also performs an original song at the end of the tour, thanking the riders of the trams for attending and to have a great rest of the day. The song was temporarily removed in 2016 and now becomes a billboard signature. Since 2006, some studio tours have bypassed the Collapsing Bridge, due to aging and wearing. However, the bridge has since undergone renovations, and was added back to the tour schedules in August 2008. Since July 2010, the Collapsing Bridge has been used as a representation of the Skull Island area for the new King Kong: 360 3-D attraction. Film sets Courthouse Square from the Back to the Future films (while redressed for the TV show Ghost Whisperer) Sets from the Universal movies Psycho, Back to the Future, The Sting, The Great Outdoors, and Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas, and the Paramount/DreamWorks film War of the Worlds are visited in the tour. Walt Disney Studios has also used the backlot for movies such as the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, 101 Dalmatians, 102 Dalmatians, and The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, specifically for town scenes. There are also 'general purpose' sets visited, such as the neighborhood Wisteria Lane from Desperate Housewives, and a neighborhood that is made to look like an old west town. This neighborhood has six streets, each with the essentials of a saloon and sheriffs station. Before the advent of sound, up to six westerns could be shot at once. The tour also winds through sound stages, and the tour guide explains what movies, television shows, music videos, commercials, and/or still camera photo shoots are currently shooting on the lot. Stage One, where The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien was filmed from June 2009 to January 2010, was added to the tour. O'Brien and announcer Andy Richter staged events outside the studio on occasion as part of The Tonight Show's Tour-ific Tramtacular sketch. The tram also passes by miniature models of the ship and Skull Island from the 2005 King Kong remake. The house used in Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho (1960), as seen from the tram. Until June 1, 2008, the tour also passed through a group of facades resembling city streets of New York (used in the filming of Bruce Almighty and some elements in Transformers), Bring It On: In It to Win It, and New England, as well as the Courthouse Square set famously seen in the Back to the Future trilogy. However, these sets were constructed mainly of wood and therefore were highly flammable, and burned to the ground in an early morning fire. All the sets have been rebuilt and a new attraction at the Studio features King Kong: 360 3-D, which opened July 1, 2010. The area beside the Psycho house (known as Psycho Flats) used to be the site of Falls Lake ‚Äî a large water-tank and waterfall used in numerous productions. Falls Lake was moved over the summer of 2008, and the area is currently occupied by the huge outdoor airplane-crash set built for War Of The Worlds, directed by Steven Spielberg. Spielberg and crew were on the Universal backlot for three days shooting on the massive outdoor set. A commercial Boeing 747 aircraft was chopped into pieces and transported to Universal, where the full set has been left fully dressed as it was during filming. The only change made to the set following filming was to move the houses on the right of the tram off the road (so the tram can pass safely). As in the movie, there are no bodies in the plane wreckage, but during Halloween Horror Nights, a combination of cast members and dummies have been put in place as crash victims. This set has also been used for two music videos, The Fray's \\"Never Say Never\\" and \\"Fly\\" by Nicki Minaj. During the pass back to the tour's entrance, it passes through Burbank and Glendale. Staged events The Studio Tour includes some special demonstrations, as well as some small segments. For example, an encounter with King Kong (King Kong: 360 3-D), a simulated flash flood, an 8.3 earthquake, a short encounter with Jaws, and a high speed car chase featuring the cast from the Fast & Furious movie franchise (Fast & Furious: Supercharged). Jurassic Park (1996) When the tram passes through the Isla Nublar set, guests are sprayed by animatronic Dilophosaurus. It is very similar to the end of the Jurassic World ride. Prior to the event, the tram also passes props and vehicles from the original Jurassic Park films. Norman Bates in front of the Bates Mansion as seen during the Psycho section of the Universal Studios Studio Tour in Hollywood. Psycho: Bates Mansion (1964) The Psycho house was one of the big draws of the Universal Tram Tour, back in 1964, and has continued to be instantly recognizable in recent years. In 1984, the Psycho house was used in the Knight Rider episode \\"Halloween Knight\\". The episode mentions of a man named Norman Baines who is supposed to be the murder suspect at a Halloween party. Also, when Michael Knight, Bonnie and KITT arrive at the house, Michael mentions that \\"Boy, this place looks really familiar\\" before he says \\"Nah!\\". During production of the film Man on the Moon, a biopic about Andy Kaufman's life story, in 1999 at an area near the house, Jim Carrey, who portrayed Kaufman in the film, became bored during break hours and tried to channel Kaufman's creative energy by playing Norman Bates. Dressing up as \\"mother\\" and wielding a rubber knife, Carrey emerged from behind the Psycho house and jumped on the tram, scaring the passengers, including the guides. The tour guides and tram operators reported the incident to the film crew who told them that the person in the costume was none other than a bored Jim Carrey himself. Carrey wanted to repeat the stunt one year later while filming How The Grinch Stole Christmas which was being filmed behind the house, but this time in full Grinch costume. However, he was stopped by the production that wanted to keep his costume and make-up under wraps until the film came out. The park however kept Carrey's idea and have cast actors dressed as Norman Bates slowly approach the tram with a rubber knife. Flash flood attraction on The Studio Tour. Flash Flood (1968) The downhill flood effect has appeared in many films, including Big Fat Liar and Fletch Lives. There is a story that when a group of dignitaries and celebrities including John Wayne visited the Flash Flood in the early days, the water levels were still being perfected and the group got soaked. Jaws (1975) The Jaws event opened a year after the release of Steven Spielberg's 1975 film. It is an attraction that features the moving shark anamatronic from the film and other sets. The actual hero prop boat 'Orca' was placed in the lagoon as a center piece, but was removed between 1991 and 1992 and chopped up for timber (Jaws director Steven Spielberg learned of the fate of the 'Orca', much to his anger, after noticing it gone while he was on the ridehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1HwAvSfZSA). The shark as seen in the attraction has had cameos in multiple television shows and films including the made-for-TV film The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island in 1981, the episode \\"Hooray for Hollywood\\" from Diff'rent Strokes in 1984, and the episode \\"Fright Knight\\" from Knight Rider in 1986. The Amity Harbor/Village area that is associated with the Jaws attraction (minus the moving shark) was the set used in two Airwolf episodes \\"The American Dream\\" (Season 2) and \\"Where Have All the Children Gone\\" (Season 3). Earthquake (1974) The Earthquake event is an 8.3 earthquake inside a soundstage, designed to make it look like a San Francisco subway station. They have a hot set; a hot set is a stage in which various props stay in use and cannot be moved. The attraction features a gimbal which allows it to shake the tram, a burning gasoline truck that collapses through the roof, fire and spark effects, a derailing subway train, and a flood of water. The attraction resets itself within just 15 seconds to prepare itself for the next tramload of guests. Psycho: Bates Motel (2008) As the tram passes the Bates Motel, the guests witness Norman Bates carrying a corpse to a car. After placing the body in the trunk, he notices the tram and walks towards it with a kitchen knife as the tram leaves just in time to escape. Bates is portrayed by an Anthony Perkins lookalike and on some occasions, a Vince Vaughn lookalike. If the actors are not available, a cardboard cutout of Anthony Perkins as Bates is used in the Cabin 1 window. Whoville Comes To Life (2008) During the holiday season, at the Whoville set all of the Whos, even Max the dog, perform a musical spectacular for the guests' enjoyment. The songs are remixes of songs from the movie. This is part of Universal's Grinchmas celebration. King Kong: 360 3-D (2010) Studio Tour guests wear 3-D glasses as the tram enters a sound stage dressed as a recreation of Skull Island. Two Venatosaurus creatures attack and begin to chase the tram, which disturbs King Kong, who begins to fight them. The fight continues from one side of the tram to the other, as air and water effects are blown onto guests to further the illusion. Near the end of the experience, a V-Rex gets a hold of what is supposed to be the last tram car and pulls it from the train, throwing it down a pit. Kong defeats the V-Rex and roars in triumph. Previously, the tour showed a large pond area with a small scale boat to show how the filming of the boat arriving to Skull Island was done. The Collapsing Bridge (1974‚Äì2006, 2008‚Äì2010, 2013, 2014) The tour guide tries to take the tram around a bridge rather than going over it, but suddenly the tram driver takes the tram towards the bridge. Just as the tram reaches the midpoint of the bridge, it creaks and massive timbers fall away, causing the bridge to \\"drop\\" the tram a short distance. The tram drives on and guests can see the bridge rebuild itself for the next tram. The bridge was used less-frequently starting in 2005, and by March 2006 was no longer part of the regular tram tour due to mechanical problems. The Collapsing Bridge was repaired and returned as part of the Studio Tour in August 2008, after the June fire had closed much of the normal tram route. As of July 2010, King Kong: 360 3-D is located in front of the Collapsing Bridge. The bridge itself is still there, but King Kong: 360 3-D has replaced it. The current route is blocked by a crushed tram, used as set dressing for King Kong. Fast & Furious: Supercharged (2015) Fast & Furious: Supercharged is located at the former site of the Curse of the Mummy's Tomb tunnel. This ride opened on June 25, 2015. Nighttime Studio Tours (2015) In celebration of Universal Studios Hollywood 50th anniversary, the Nighttime Studio Tour complements the popular daytime experience by offering a nighttime tour of the famous studio backlot.  Former events  Avalanche Tunnel (1974‚Äì2001) The tour guide leads the tram into a revolving tunnel, simulating an avalanche, including fake snow spinning around the tram, and damaged signs, along with special sound effects. It was replaced by Curse of the Mummy's Tomb. Rockslide (1974‚Äì1979) The tram stops inside a rock cliff which begins to collapse. The tram gets past the cliff safely, but not before having a collision with the rocks. The attraction was replaced by Battle of Galactica in 1979. Runaway Train (1974‚Äì1985) The tour guide leads the tram across a train track, thinking it is safe to cross. However, a train suddenly rushes from the tracks and stops just in time before colliding with the tram. The guide leads the tram away from the tracks to safety. The train is now a stationary train in the backlot. Battle of Galactica (1979‚Äì1992) This high-technology attraction featuring animatronics and live actors in a spectacular laser battle based on the television series Battlestar Galactica with a 200-foot long spaceship that \\"swallowed\\" the passengers, opened June 9, 1979. This was the first themed attraction to feature Audio-Animatronics characters outside Disney Parks, and was the first dark ride to combine sophisticated animatronics and lasers with live actors. At a cost of $1 million, it was the most expensive special effects attraction ever built at the park at the time. It was replaced in 1992 by the foundations of Back to the Future: The Ride. King Kong Encounter (1986‚Äì2008) The tram enters 1976 New York City where King Kong is on the loose and grabs and shakes the tram, which eventually escapes his grasp and gets out of the city safely. The 7-ton, Kong figure was the largest and most complex animatronic figure in existence for many years. The sophistication of the attraction broke new ground and paved the way for today's themed attractions, including a Universal Studios Florida version. The Kong sequence was also featured in the film The Wizard starring Fred Savage and Indie singer Jenny Lewis. This attraction opened on June 14, 1986, and was completely destroyed by a fire in the early morning of June 1, 2008. As of June 3, 2008, Universal Studios officials stated that the experience would not be rebuilt, and instead was replaced by the new King Kong: 360 3-D attraction, based on the 2005 film. Curse of the Mummy's Tomb (2001‚Äì2013) The tram guide tells guests that they are going to take a look at some props from the film The Mummy, but instead the tram is led into Imhotep's cursed tomb, where he sucks them into a powerful revolving sandstorm. The guide eventually leads the tram out of the sandstorm, and Imhotep is defeated. The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb closed on September 3, 2013 and was later demolished in the same month. It was confirmed on April 8, 2014 that the site would become home to the new Fast and Furious attraction, replaced by Fast & Furious: Supercharged, which opened on June 25, 2015. The Fast & The Furious: Extreme Close-Up (2006‚Äì2013)''' Extreme Close-up is a demonstration of some of the special effects used in The Fast & The Furious: Tokyo Drift. The attraction started construction in March 2006 and opened on June 15, 2006. The area was formerly occupied by a model used in Dante's Peak. The section was closed in late July 2013. The studio had become increasingly frustrated with the portrayal of its Fast and Furious franchise at Universal Studios Hollywood after the blockbuster success of the sixth film. This frustration eventually led to the unplanned closure of Fast and Furious on the Studio Tour after producers from the film witnessed the attraction first-hand. On April 8, 2014 it was confirmed that a new Fast & Furious attraction would be built on the former site of the Curse of the Mummy Tunnel. King Kong Sea (2006‚Äì2016) The guide leads the tram to a body of water around Skull Mountain Island. Suddenly, the waves part, and the tram travels between them, and guests get a view of the mini island. Prior to the promotion of King Kong, guides informed guests that the waterfall effect was originally installed for the \\"parting of the Red Sea\\" scene from The Ten Commandments. The surrounding pond was also featured as part of the film set from The Creature from the Black Lagoon. For many years a mock-up of the creature stood in the pond.

The disease arises firstly through the deposition of silica or coal dust (or other dust) within the lung, and then through the body's immunological reactions to the dust. Presentation According to the International Labour Office (ILO), PMF requires the presence of large opacity exceeding 1 cm (by x-ray). By pathology standards, the lesion in histologic section must exceed 2 cm to meet the definition of PMF.Craighead JE et al. Diseases Associated with Exposure to Silica and Nonfibrous Silicate Minerals. Arch Pathol Lab Med, 1988;112:673‚Äì720. In PMF, lesions most commonly occupy the upper lung zone, and are usually bilateral. The development of PMF is usually associated with a restrictive ventilatory defect on pulmonary function testing. PMF can be mistaken for bronchogenic carcinoma and vice versa. PMF lesions tend to grow very slowly, so any rapid changes in size, or development of cavitation, should prompt a search for either alternative cause or secondary disease. Pathogenesis  The pathogenesis of PMF is complicated, but involves two main routes ‚Äì an immunological route, and a mechanical route. Immunologically, disease is caused primarily through the activity of lung macrophages, which phagocytose dust particles after their deposition. These macrophages seek to eliminate the dust particle through either the mucociliary mechanism, or through lymphatic vessels which drain the lungs. Macrophages also produce an inflammatory mediator known as interleukin-1 (IL-1), which is part of the immune systems first line defenses against infecting particles. IL-1 is responsible for 'activation' of local vasculature, causing endothelial cells to express certain cell adhesion molecules, which help the cells of the body's immune system to migrate into tissues. Macrophages exposed to dust have been shown to have markedly decreased chemotaxis. Production of inflammatory mediators ‚Äì and the tissue damage that ensues as an effect of this, as well as reduced motility of cells, is fundamental to the pathogenesis of pneumoconiosis and the accompanying inflammation, fibrosis, and emphysema. There are also some mechanical factors involved in the pathogenesis of Complex Pneumoconiosis that should be considered. The most notable indications are the fact that the disease tends to develop in the upper lobe of the lung ‚Äì especially on the right, and its common occurrence in taller individuals. DiagnosisTreatmentIncidence Progressive massive fibrosis increased during the period 1970‚Äì2016 among coal miners in central Appalachia who filed for black lung benefits.

The ASARS-2 system was developed in the early 1980s by Hughes Aircraft, and is currently supported by Raytheon. It is capable of detecting and accurately locating both stationary and moving ground targets; target information is transmitted via a wideband data link to a ground station. The radar is capable of producing extremely high resolution images at long range. ASARS-2 was used extensively during Operation Desert Storm for target location and battle damage assessment. It has also been used to survey damage after various domestic disasters, including floods along the Mississippi River and the 1994 Northridge earthquake. In the late 1990s, the ASARS Improvement Program (AIP) incorporated several performance and supportability enhancements into the system. Making extensive use of commercial off-the-shelf technology, the AIP redesign increased on-board processing capability and upgraded the data link. The first of these ASARS-2A radars was delivered in 2001.

It is an industrial town located some 45 km north of Virar, on the Western Railway line of Mumbai Suburban Division (Mumbai Suburban Railway). Tarapur can be reached from Boisar, the nearest railway station. It is 20 km off National Highway NH-8.  History  At the end of the thirteenth century (1280), Tarapur is mentioned as one of the towns conquered from the Naiks by Bhim the legendary ruler of Mahim in Bombay island. (Naime's Konkan, 22.) In 1533 it was burnt by the Portuguese. (De Barros, VII. 501; Faria in Kerr, VI. 223, 225.) In 1556 the Portuguese possessions near Tarapur were greatly increased, and it was the head of the richest of the Daman districts. (De Couto, VIII. 208.) In 1559 an assault by some Abyssinian troops was successfully beaten off. (De Couto, VIII. 208.) In 1582, and again in 1612, the fort was unsuccessfully attacked by the Moghals. (De Couto, XI. 195; Mickle's Lusiad, ociii.) In 1634 the town was the seat of a magistrate with powers over half of the Daman territories. It exported provisions in which the country round was rich, and had a good trade with Surat and Diu. (O Chron. de Tis. III. 199.) The fort was surrounded by a wall with round bastions, and, besides quarters for the garrison, had a church, a Dominican monastery, and a hospital or misericordia. The garrison included a captain, a naik, ten peons, and a bombardier, a police inspector and four peons, an interpreter, a writer, a torchbearer, and an umbrella boy. Besides the garrison there was the vicar, and fifty Portuguese, 200 Native Christians, and about 100 slaves, good fighters and well armed with swords, lances, and guns. [O Chron. de Tis. III. 199.] In 1670 Ogilby mentions it as a coast town, (O gilby's Atlas, V. 208.) and, in 1695, Gemelli Careri describes it as well inhabited with monasteries of the Dominicans and Franciscans of the Recolet school. (Churchill, IV. 190.) In 1728 it Was said to be of no strength and to be garrisoned by sixty soldiers. [O. Chron. de Tis. I. 35.] In 1739 the fort was attacked by the Marathas under Chimaji Appa. Four mines were laid, of which two succeeded in making great breaches in a bastion and curtain. Bajibevrav, Ramchandra Hari, Yeshvant Pavar, and Tukaji Pavar rushed into the breaches with their colours. They were stoutly opposed by the Portuguese, and success was doubtful, till Ranoji Bhonsle scaled the wall in another part and divided the attention of the garrison. Still, as Chimnaji wrote, they fought with the courage of Europeans, till, at last overpowered, the survivors asked for and were granted quarter. [Grant Duff's Marathas, 241; Thornton's Gazetteer, 959-60.] In 1750 Tieffenthaler mentions Tarapur as a place once Portuguese now Maratha. [Res. Hist, et Geog. de l'Inde, I. 407.] After the capture the Marathas repaired the sea face of the fort in European style. In 1760 it was in good order and protected by four guns. [Anquetil du Perron's Zend A vests, occlxxxi.] In 1776 Raghunathrav took shelter in the fort. [Grant Duff's Marathas, 398.] In 1803 it passed to the British without resistance. In 1818 it was described by Captain Dickinson as one of the largest, best conditioned, and most central of the sea-coast forts in the north Konkan. The walls, most of which were of cut stone, enclosed a space 500 feet square. They were about thirty feet high and ten thick, except the parapet which was seldom more than four feet wide. The north face was washed by the sea at spring tides, and in many places was out of repair. Long stretches of the parapet had fallen, and, at the south-east angle of the fort, there was neither tower nor bastion. On three sides were remains of a dry ditch of inconsiderable width and depth. In the middle of the eastern face was the principal gateway, uncovered by traverse or any sort of outwork. Inside the fort were some large ruins and several buildings four of them private. There were besides two granaries and a guard-room, with some inferior buildings and several wells containing abundant and excellent water. As in Dahanu fort, houses and gardens came within 150 feet of the works. In 1862 it was in a ruined state, part of the north wall having fallen. In the fort were some wells and gardens. The fort was given in inam by the Peshwa to Vikaji Mehrji, for a hundred years, and is still held by his heirs. Taylor mentions, on the south bank of the creek, the remains of a Portuguese fort which was built in 1593. [Taylor's Sailing Directory, 372.] Chinchani town on the north side of the creek has a customs-house and traveller's bungalow now used as school. On the beach, about a mile north of Tarapur, is a ruined brick tower, which, in 1818, Captain Dickinson found twenty-two feet high with a mean diameter of twenty-eight feet. The lower or main battery was nine feet above ground and contained five guns, the side parapet walls not exceeding three and a half feet in thickness. Over this battery was another, suited for an equal number of guns. Its parapet wall supported a wretched roof, and was not more than a foot and a half thick. Today its one of the biggest industrial hub near Mumbai. Regarding sea transport now its possible for barge to arrive near Satpati-Murbe jetty. GR Engineering Pvt. Ltd. had transport 70 mtrs cargo by this jetty.  Geography  Tarapur is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Tarapur It has an average elevation of 456 metres (1496 feet). Economy=Atomic power stations The Tarapur nuclear power station houses two boiling water reactors (BWRs), each of 200 MW (De-rated to 160MW), the first in Asia, and a recent unit with two pressurised heavy water reactors each of 540 MW. This PHWR based power station is not only the largest nuclear power reactor in the country but also the largest power unit in India. It was commissioned seven months ahead of schedule, at a cost much lower than the original estimate, by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India. Tarapur Atomic Power Station (320 MW) (T.A.P.S.) was constructed by the American companies Bechtel and GE near village Akkarpatti. The new reactors (1080 MW) were constructed by Larsen & Toubro and Gammon India. Both these power stations are operated by Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited. The personnel operating the power plant live in a residential complex called T. A. P. S. Township. This residential complex is a fifteen-minute drive from Boisar, the nearest railway station. The residential complex was also constructed by Bechtel to house both Indian and American employees. Because it was the home to American engineers and technicians, the residential complex had a very American small-town look, with neat sidewalks, spacious houses, a club with tennis courts, gyms and swimming pool, a commissary etc. While the original American residents have long gone, the colony continues to thrive. Industrial estate Tarapur also houses two huge industrial estates Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation, Tarapur Industrial Estate and Additional Tarapur Industrial Estate), which include bulk drug manufacturing units, specialty chemical manufacturing units like JSW Steel Ltd, Aarti Industries plants and a few textile plants. =Gas-fired power station= MIDC has proposed a gas-fired power station for captive use at Tarapur Industrial Area. MIDC has decided to explore the concept of group captive power plant (GCPP) as proposed in the Electricity Act of 2003. Subsequently MIDC appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers as consultant to study the concept of GCPPs. =Planning and layout= Unlike other industrial estates, this industrial estate has a pleasant look due to the roads crossing at right angles and many small gardens adjacent to the boundary walls of the industrial units. The location near Mumbai Port/Mumbai Harbour (MbPT) and JNPT as well as proximity to Trans Thane Creek (TTC) MIDC, Vapi GIDC add a great value to this industrial estate. It is located on the most important rail-route, Mumbai to Delhi and the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Highway, a part of the Golden Quadrilateral project. =Environment= The first \\"Common Effluent Treatment Plant\\" (CETP) in Maharashtra came up at Tarapur. Tarapur Industrial Manufacturers' Association is responsible for planting saplings.  Residential  Tarapur is spread across a number of villages. The location comprises excellent schools, hospitals, multiple shopping complexes, hotels and restaurants, and is well connected to Mumbai through road and rail. The main shopping areas are Chitralaya and Boisar (oswal, Yashvant shristi), which have a huge number of small and big shops.  Demographics  India census, Tarapur had a population of 7012. Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%. Tarapur has a literacy rate of 91% for both males and females, much higher than the national average of 72%. In Tarapur, 11% of the population is under 6 years of age. Among minority languages, Gujarati is spoken by 15.68% of the population and Hindi by 26.78%.  Attractions  Two beaches lay about four kilometres west from Tarapur. Well known is the Tarapur beach with a dilapidated Portuguese fort which was in a ruined state in 1862, part of the north wall having fallen. The Tarapur Fort, with wells and gardens within, was given in inam (a grant of real estate) by the Peshwa to Vikaji Mehrji, for a hundred years, and is still held by his heirs, and is currently in custody of Chorge family. Another beautiful site is the Chinchani beach, one and a half kilometres north of the fort.  Transport  Rented cars/taxis, state transport buses (Maharashtra State Transport Corporation) and auto rickshaws are the general mode of transport.  Transport history  Tarapur, a port in the Mahim sub- division, had a population of 2939 in 1881. It lies in a low wooded tract on the south bank of the Tarapur creek, sixty miles north of Bombay, fifteen miles north of Mahim, and road seven miles north-west of the Boisar station of the Baroda railway. The road from Boisar station was built in 1871 at a cost of ¬£14,536 (Rs. 1,45,365). The traffic at Boisar station show an increase in passengers from 11,711 in 1873 to 24,329 in 1880, and in goods from 1289 to 3302 tons. From the village on the north bank of the creek the town is known by the joint name of Tarapur-Chinchni.  Ship transport  In 1634 the bar of the Tarapur river was described as of the same width as the Dahanu bar, with a similar sand bank at the mouth and a channel in the middle which was dry at low tide, but at high water allowed a ship to enter and anchor.O Chron. de Tis. III. 199. Within a rocky reef, to the north-west of the town, there is still anchorage for small craft. But particularly in the south, the bottom is full of rocks and shoals, which stretch from Tarapur point to the north-west and north abreast the town. Between Tarapur and Bombay the tides set nearly in the direction of the land, the flood a little towards it or north, and the ebb a little from it about south by west.Taylor's Sailing Directory, 371-72. In the 1881 population of 2939, there were 2124 Hindus, 397 Musalmans, 366 Parsis, and 52 Christians. The sea-trade returns for the five years ending 1878-79 show average exports worth ¬£10,529 (Rs. 1,05,290) and average imports worth ¬£6134 (Rs. 61,340). Exports varied from ¬£1115 (Rs. 11,150) in 1877-78 to ¬£16,840 (Rs. 1,68,400) in 1878-79, and imports from ¬£4690 (Rs. 46,900) in 1878-79 to ¬£7220 (Rs. 72,200) in 1876-77. [The details are: Exports, 1874-75 ¬£14,031 (Rs. 1,40,310), 1875-76 ¬£11,828 (Rs. 1,18,280), 1876-77 ¬£8835 (Rs. 88,350), 1877-78 ¬£1115 (Rs. 11,150?), 1878-79 ¬£16,840 (Rs.1,68,400); Imports, 1874-75 ¬£5370 (Rs. 53,700), 1875-76 ¬£6694(Rs. 66,940), 1876-77 ¬£7220 (Rs. 72,200), 1877-78 ¬£6696 (Rs. 66,960), 1878-79 ¬£4690 (Rs. 46,900).] A municipality was sanctioned in 1866, but the sanction was withdrawn in 1869. There is a Government school and a school founded by the Bombay Parsi Panchayat for teaching Zend Avesta. In the Parsi quarter of the town is a fire-temple, built about 1820 by the well-known Parsi contractor Vikaji Mehrji. Opposite to the fire-temple is Vikaji Mehrji's mansion, a large two- storied building visible for miles. About two miles to the south there are three Towers of Silence. The earliest of unknown date is built of undressed stones and mortar.

They are culturally, linguistically, ethnically and socially distinct from the Parsis, who ‚Äì although also Zoroastrians ‚Äì emigrated to the Indian subcontinent from Greater Iran many centuries before the Iranis did. Distinction from Parsis The Parsis and Iranis are considered legally distinct. A 1909 obiter dictum relating to the Indian Zoroastrians observed that Iranis (of the now defunct Bombay Presidency) were not obliged to uphold the decisions of the then regulatory Parsi Panchayat. Some of the Irani community speaks an ethnolect called Zoroastrian Dari. However, the two communities increasingly intermarry and are said to have been \\"integrated well\\" with each other. History Although the term 'Irani' is first attested during the Mughal era, most Iranis are descended from immigrants who left Iran and migrated to the Indian subcontinent during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At the time, Iran was ruled by the Qajars and religious persecution of Zoroastrians was widespread. The descendants of those immigrants remain ethnically closer to the Zoroastrians of Iran, in particular to the Zoroastrians of Yazd and Kerman, than to Parsis in India. Consequently, some Iranis still speak Persian and the Dari dialects of the Zoroastrians of those provinces. Iranis are generally seen as a subset of the wider Parsi community. As is also the case for the Parsis, the Iranis predominantly settled the west-coast of India, in the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. A concentration of their people live in and around the city of Mumbai. Notable Iranis Irani is the generic surname for the community. Some families have adopted surnames related to their ancestral hometowns in Iran, such as Kermani, Yezdani, Khosravi, Faroodi, and Jafrabadi. Notable members of the Irani community include: *Anosh Irani, Indian-Canadian novelist *Aruna Irani, Bollywood actress *Ardeshir Irani, director of the first Indian sound film Alam Ara *Bakhtiyaar Irani, TV actor *Boman Irani, film and theatre actor *C R Irani, Indian journalist and Editor- in-Chief of The Statesman *Daisy Irani, Bollywood child actress of the 1950s and 60's *Delnaaz Irani, Bollywood actress *Dinshah Irani, Zoroastrian leader who provided aid to the Zoroastrian community of Iran. *Faredoon Irani, Indian cinematographer *Mehera Irani, Meher Baba mandali *Honey Irani, Bollywood actress and screenwriter *Jenni Irani (Jamshed Khudadad Irani), cricketer *Kaikhosrov D.

The Old Avery Oak Tree was a white oak tree that stood in Dedham, Massachusetts until it was knocked down in 1972. It had a circumference of over and stood on East Street near the Fairbanks House. It was named for Jonathan Avery, the owner of the tree, who had an estate that was bounded roughly by East Street, Mt. Vernon Street, Barrows Street, and Brookdale Avenue. The Avery family was one of the early settlers of Dedham, arriving in 1650. By the time the first settlers arrived in Dedham in 1635, the tree was already quite old. It was owned by the Dedham Historical Society after being donated by J.W. Clark in 1886. Clark, who owned the house where the tree was located, also donated a square of land around it extending seven and a half feet from three sides of it, and to East Street on the fourth. The deed also allowed the roots and branches to grow over and under Clark's land. Today, wood from the tree is used in the chairman of the Board of Selectmen's and the Town Meeting Moderator's gavel. Historical Society president Henry Hildreth also commissioned a chair to be built from the timber. The tree also lives on in the seal adopted by the Town in 1878, and that of the Dedham- Westwood Water District. Storms In the terrible winter of 1723, when the snow lay so thick over the landscape that the residents could not access their woodlot, another Avery chopped off the top of the tree to keep his family from freezing. By the 1790s, the Avery Oak‚Äôs gnarled and crooked branches spread more than 90 feet from a trunk five feet in diameter. Although over 450 other trees, on public land alone, were felled by the New England Hurricane of 1938, the Avery Oak survived. It was struck by lightning, however, and a limb at the top was knocked off. The tree lived until late July, 1972, when a strong thunderstorm toppled it. Then-police chief Walter Carroll was driving down East Street when it toppled, and the tree very nearly struck his car. Hundreds of people gathered to see the fallen tree, and the police protected it while the Historical Society made plans for how to dispose of it. The tree was estimated to be over 450 years old. USS Constitution Samuel Nicholson, the first captain of the Constitution, was living in Dedham at the time the ship was being built. The Avery Oak at that time had limbs full of crooks and angles, which Lord Bacon called knee timber, and which was particularly required in ship building. Its massive trunk would also have yielded a good quantity of planking. Designer Joshua Humphreys specified white oak for the hull of the USS Constitution. Timber merchants from New Jersey to Maine scrambled to find old growth trees that had the straight trunks needed to cut long runs of plank, but also crooks and bends that could supply the hundreds of hanging, standing, and lodging knees needed to support deck beams. The ship builders, presumably Nicholson, made several offers to buy the tree, eventually rising to \\"the unheard of price of $70,\\" but the owner would not sell. Local legend contends that it was Avery's wife who spared the tree.

It is usually made with cottage cheese and eggs. Recipes can range from sweet to savoury, and from simple to festive and elaborate multi-layered cakes. A derivative of the South Slavic verb gibati/–≥–∏–±–∞—Ç–∏ meaning \\"to fold; sway, swing, rock\\", the pastry was mentioned in Serbian linguist Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá's Serbian Dictionary in (1818) and by a Slovenian priest Jo≈æef Kosiƒç in 1828, where it was described as a special Slovenian cake which is \\"a must at wedding festivities and is also served to workers after finishing a big project\\". It is a type of layered strudel, a combination of Turkish and Austrian influences in different cuisines of the former Yugoslavia. Today the versions of this cake can be found in Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, and other regions of the former Yugoslavia. Variants of this rich layered strudel are found in Hungary, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, and Syria. Gibanica may sometimes also refer to a walnut roll, which is a sweet bread with a spiral of walnut paste rolled up inside. Etymology In the vocabulary of the Yugoslav Academy, as well as in the etymological dictionary of Slavic languages, the word gibanica is a derivative of the Croatian verb g√≠bati and Serbian verb –≥–∏–±–∞—Ç–∏, which means \\"to fold; sway, swing, rock\\". There are also derivatives like the word / ‚Äì one who makes gibanica, one who loves to eat gibanica, and one who always imposes as a guest and at someone else's expense. Some believe that the word gibanica actually comes from the Egyptian Arabic gebna (ÿ¨ÿ®ŸÜÿ©), a type of soft white salty cheese used in making gibanica. Preparation The original recipe for Gibanica included traditionally homemade Phyllo dough and cow's milk cheese. Homemade cheese can be feta or sirene. The pie is usually made as gu≈ævara (crumpled pie), so the phyllo dough in the middle is crumpled and filled. Besides cheese, the fill contains eggs, milk, kaymak, lard, salt and water. Also, stuffing may include spinach, meat, nettle, potato and onion. To speed up preparation, phyllo dough from a store can be used and sunflower oil or olive oil can be used instead of lard. Variants Prekmurska gibanica, a Slovenian variant. Meƒëimurska gibanica, a Croatian variant. Many varieties of Gibanica and related dishes can be found throughout the Balkans; different gibanica are known as part of the national cuisines of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, and Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy, where it is called ghibanizza), Greece, North Macedonia and Bulgaria, where it is usually called Banitsa. Recipes can range from sweet to savoury, and from simple to festive and elaborate multi- layered cakes. The so-called \\"Chetnik Gibanica\\" is the fatter, greasier version; it received the name after World War II. From the basic recipe, many local specialties have evolved. Prekmurska gibanica, for example, is a \\"fancy\\" multi-layered cake from Prekmurje in Slovenia, served as a dessert course on festive occasions. Meƒëimurska gibanica, from the neighbouring Meƒëimurje region of Croatia, is a closely related but simpler and less \\"formal\\" dish consisting of four layers of fillings (prepared fresh cheese (quark), poppyseed, apple and walnut). Another gibanica variety, called Prle≈°ka gibanica, is known from Prlekija to the west of the Mur River. The basic concept of Gibanica, a cake or pie involving a combination of pastry with cheese in differentiated layers often combined with layers of various other fillings, is common in the cuisines of the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Eastern Mediterranean. For example, a similar dish known as Shabiyat (Sh'abiyat, Shaabiyat) is part of the cuisine of Syria and Lebanon. Gibanica can also be considered to resemble a type of cheese strudel, with which it likely shares a common ancestry in the pastry dishes of the region, and the cuisines of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires. In culture Gibanica is one of the most popular and recognizable pastry dishes from the Balkans, whether served on festive occasions, or as a comforting family snack. In Serbia, the dish is eaten as breakfast, dinner, appetizer and snack, and is often consumed at traditional events such as Christmas, Easter and Slava. The largest Gibanica ever made was in the town of Mionica in 2007. It weighed over 1,000 kg, and was applied for inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records. Around 330 kg of phyllo dough, 330 kg of cheese, 3,300 eggs, 30 l of oil, 110 l of mineral water, 50 kg of lard and 500 packets of baking powder went into its creation. In Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia there are festivals dedicated to gibanica. One of them, called the Gibanica festival or Days of Banitsa, is held each year in Bela Palanka. It first took place in 2005. The Slovenian festival of Prekmurska gibanica and ham is held in the Slovenian region of Prekmurje, and the Croatian festival of gibanica is held in Igri≈°ƒáe in the Croatian region of Hrvatsko Zagorje.

The title Pater Indiges or simply Indiges is also used.Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book 14 The Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus notes that when the body of Aeneas was not found after a battle between his group of Trojan exiles in Italy and the native Rutulians, it was assumed that he had been taken up by the gods to become a deity.

Its history is connected with the need for an advanced AIFV by the Greek Armed Forces. The vehicle takes its name from the Greek word for Centaur the creature from Greek mythology. After aborted efforts including Leonidas-2 variants and other attempted improvements and joint developments, ELVO worked entirely on its own, on a new design according to the specifications given at the time by the Hellenic Army. The resulting AIFV developed by the Greek company, named 'Kentaurus' ('ŒöŒïŒùŒ§ŒëŒ•Œ°ŒüŒ£'), was officially introduced at the Defendory Arms Exhibition in Athens in 1998. It features a 420 hp MTU Diesel engine, 30 mm EBO cannon and 7.62 mm machine-gun (built on Mauser and Rheinmetall designs), Pyrkal smoke- grenade launchers, Toxotis computerized fire control system and KUKA turret. The crew is 3+8, maximum speed on roads is 75 km/h and maximum weight is 19.8 tons. Despite successful tests by the Greek army, its approval, and an initial agreement in 2003 for an order of 140 vehicles, its fate is uncertain due to subsequent cutbacks in relevant military spending, and evaluation of cheaper alternatives. In 2009 the Greek army signed an MoU for 450 BMP-3s but as of 2012 the contract was frozen and the Greek army is still looking for 500 IFVs to replace the ageing BMP-1 and the purchase of 500 Kentaurus IFV's is being considered. Description The hull is made of welded steel. The engine is placed in the front-right compartment, with the driver in the front-left. The turret follows and then the troop compartment. The driver accesses his position either from a roof hatch or from the troop compartment. The commander is situated in the E-8 KUKA 1-man turret behind the driver. The troop compartment is accessed from two rear-doors, as well as from two roof-hatches. The squad leader sits alone, with the rest of the men at the sides in a 3-man and 4-man rows. The troops have two optical periscopes for situational awareness. The interior of the vehicle has been designed to permit comfortable movement for men of up to 1.90m height.TOMA ¬´KŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ¬ª, Œ†œÑŒÆœÉŒ∑ & ŒîŒπŒ¨œÉœÑŒ∑ŒºŒ±, 177 - ŒúŒ¨œÅœÑŒπŒøœÇ 2000 The vehicle has steel armor, concentrated mostly to the front arc.

The name also refers to the organizational body that oversees the event and its preparation. History The foundation of the competition was conceived by three French instructors from Jacksonville, Florida in the fall of 1952: Lelia Alexander of Julia E. Landon High School (now Julia Landon College Preparatory and Leadership Development School), Cornelia Burge of Duncan U. Fletcher High School, and Doris McCleary of Andrew Jackson High School. The first competition was held in April of 1953 at the Proven√ßal House of Rollins College and continued to take place there on an annual basis. Suzanne Carrell In 1962, French professor Suzanne Carrell facilitated the relocation of the event to Jacksonville University where it had remained for several years. Carrell, a French national, was highly praised for her work in strengthening the cultural ties between the United States and France, particularly in the relationship between the sister cities of Jacksonville and Nantes. In 1980, a scholarship open to participants of the Congr√®s was established in her name and continues to this day. In recognition of her work, French President Jacques Chirac decreed upon her the French Legion of Honor on the competition's fiftieth year (2002). On the competition's sixtieth year (2012), Carrell would also receive the National Order of Merit. Despite having retired in 1989, Carrell continued to chair the organization until her passing in 2019. After Jacksonville Today, the competition is principally held in Orlando, Florida. Purpose Students from participating Florida middle schools and high schools compete in various challenges designed to test fluency in French as well as knowledge of French culture. These challenges include la lecture (reading proficiency), le discours (improvised oration), la d√©clamation (poetry recitation), and le casse-t√™te (lit. \\"break-head\\", a quiz bowl). The rewards for these challenges are primarily ribbons and plaques. Separately, students who demonstrate in writing an intent to continue their studies in French (especially into higher education) are given the opportunity to win multiple scholarships, the most notable of which is the Bourse Suzanne Carrell. The organization's homepage claims that the event serves to allow students to \\"meet other enthusiastic Francophiles who inspire one another.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Current Homepage for Le Congr√®s de la Culture Fran√ßaise en Floride * \\"Retired Professor Honored by French Legion of Honor\\" (Jacksonville University press release) Category:Recurring events established in 1952 Category:Competitions Category:Education in Florida Category:Francophonie Category:1952 establishments in Florida ","title":"Congress of French Culture in Florida"},{"id":"4436896","text":"Auto-lead Data Format (ADF) is an open XML-based standard specifically for communicating consumer purchase requests to automotive dealerships.

The parish has a population of 308.  History  The village was known in the Domesday Book as Hantone, the Blewett part of the name coming from the Bluet family in the fourteenth century. Hantone is believed to mean 'A poor enclosure' from the Old English hean and tun. The parish was part of the hundred of Chewton. The name of the village is sometimes spelled as Hinton Blewitt. There is a village green outside the pub and church, sometimes known as the \\"Barbary\\". William Rees- Mogg took the title of Baron Rees-Mogg, of Hinton Blewett, when he was made a life peer in 1988, although in 1998 he and his family moved to nearby Mells. Lord Rees-Mogg's children Jacob and Annunziata spent much of their childhood in the village.  Governance  The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, unitary council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as being consulted by the unitary council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. Along with East and West Harptree, Hinton Blewett is part of the Mendip Ward, which is represented by one councillor on the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset, created in 1996, responsible for almost all local government functions, including local planning and building control, education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal, strategic planning, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Fire, police, and ambulance services are provided by the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, and the South Western Ambulance Service. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, Hinton Blewett was in the Wansdyke district of the county of Avon, and before 1974 was part of the Clutton Rural District of Somerset. The parish is represented in the House of Commons as part of North East Somerset, which elects one Member of Parliament, and is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects six MEPs.  Demographics  According to the 2001 Census, the Mendip Ward (which includes East and West Harptree), had 1,465 residents, living in 548 households, with an average age of 39.0 years. Of these 79% of residents describing their health as 'good', 22% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.5% of all economically active people aged 16‚Äì74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 25,387 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.  Buildings = Church  Church of St Margaret The Church of St Margaret is largely built of Blue Lias with Doulting Stone arcade, and probably dates from the 13th century although parts are as late as the 16th or 17th century. The five bells were cast in 1708 by the Bilbies of Chew Stoke. It includes the coat of arms of Simon Seward (Rector 1514‚Äì59) over the doorway.

Boulter was born in El Paso, Texas, to Eldon Howard Boulter and Betty Sue (Heavenhill) Boulter. He graduated in 1960 from Levelland High School in Levellandin Hockley County, near Lubbock. In 1965, he graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, and in 1968, he earned his law degree from Baylor Law School in Waco, Texas. He was thereafter admitted to the bar and practiced law in Amarillo. From 1981 to 1983, he was a member of the Amarillo City Commission. In 1982, Boulter lost the Republican primary for the 13th district congressional seat. Two years later, he unseated Democratic U.S. Representative Jack Hightower in the general election. He was helped by Ronald Reagan's massive landslide that year; Reagan won most of the counties in this district by margins of 2-to-1 or greater. Although the 13th District had become increasingly Republican at the national level, Boulter's win is still regarded as an upset. He was one of six freshmen Republican congressmen elected from Texas in 1984; they were collectively called the Texas Six Pack. Running for the Senate, 1988 Boulter was convincingly reelected in 1986, and was thought to be all but invincible in his district. It therefore came a surprise when he announced he would give up his seat after only two terms to challenge three-term Democratic U.S. Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen. Some of Boulter's staunchest supporters were dismayed that he would surrender a seemingly \\"safe\\" House seat for the vagaries of challenging the popular and entrenched Bentsen. After all, Bentsen had already defeated three sitting Republican congressmen from presumably \\"safe\\" districts: George Herbert Walker Bush of Houston in 1970, Alan Steelman of Dallas in 1976, and James M. Collins of Dallas in 1982. He'd won the latter two races fairly handily, taking more than 55 percent of the vote each time. Geography also was against Boulter as well; no one from west of San Antonio has ever represented Texas in the U.S. Senate. An Amarillo lawyer, however, does serve on the Texas Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Boulter had difficulty winning the Republican Senate nomination. In the primary, he trailed Houston businessman Wes Gilbreath, a friend of the Bushes. Boulter's 228,676 votes (30.5 percent) were nearly 50,000 below the 275,080 ballots (36.7 percent) received by Gilbreath. In the low-turnout runoff, Boulter prevailed with 111,134 ballots (60.2 percent) to Gilbreath's 73,573 (39.8 percent). The primary totals were a harbinger that Boulter might be yet another weak Republican candidate attempting to unseat Bentsen, who despite a generally liberal voting record in the U.S. Senate was perceived by most voters as \\"moderate\\" to \\"conservative\\". Boulter tried to make an issue of Bentsen's use of the \\"Johnson Law,\\" which allowed the senator to run for vice president while also seeking reelection to the Senate. Boulter took the anti-abortion position in the campaign, whereas Bentsen supported a woman's right to procure an abortion. Boulter polled 2,129,228 (40 percent) to Bentsen's 3,149,806 (60 percent). Bentsen's raw vote was the highest numerically ever obtained by a statewide Democratic candidate in Texas history. Boulter's weak showing was highly embarrassing for the state GOP, magnified because the candidate at the top of the Republican ticket, George Herbert Walker Bush, who also had been the first of the four Senate nominees to lose to Bentsen, carried Texas fairly easily and in the process, won the 13th in a landslide. Moreover, Boulter's congressional seat went Democratic once again, with the election of then State Senator Bill Sarpalius. Attempted congressional comeback fails, 1992 Boulter tried to make a comeback in 1992 by running for his old House seat. However, it was‚Äîat least on paper‚Äîslightly less Republican than its predecessor, and he was handily defeated by Sarpalius, who took 117,892 votes (60 percent) to Boulter's 77,514 (40 percent). Personal life Today, Boulter owns a successful lobbying firm in Washington called Beau Boulter, LLC. Boulter's clients have included the United Seniors Association, an organization associated with the late entertainer Art Linkletter, but with ties to Jack Abramoff and CapitolWatch, a taxpayers lobby that Boulter chaired in the late 1980s. Boulter and his wife, Rosemary R. Boulter (born 1943), live in Falls Church, Virginia. They have three children: Rebecca, Matthew, and Elizabeth.

It is the sequel to Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters, it was originally announced in 2006 and released in October 2008. A compilation of the game, and its two downloadable content packs, was released on 24 October 2009, titled the \\"Game of the Year\\" edition. The game takes place in the fictional land of Albion, five hundred years after Fable's original setting, in a colonial era resembling the time of highwaymen or the Enlightenment. Guns are still primitive, and large castles and cities have developed in the place of towns. Unlike the original, the player may choose to be either male or female.  Gameplay  There are both interactive and non-interactive cutscenes in the game. According to Lionhead Studios, the non-interactive cutscenes consume less than five minutes of game time. In the fully interactive cutscenes a player can use their expressions during the dialogue or even run away from the scene, thus skipping it; afterward the player can return to the cutscene location to start it again. If the player runs away from a cutscene which contains important information, the character will await the player's return. The player's companion is a dog which the player befriends as a child. This dog follows the player almost all of the time during the game. The dog can learn tricks, fight enemies and find treasure, and lead the way to quest objectives (when required, though this is rare; typically the player is led to objectives via a sparkling gold \\"bread crumb\\" trail). It can also aid in combat situations by attacking downed enemies. The dog cannot be killed, but can become injured and ineffective, requiring healing by the player. The appearance of their dog will also mirror the player's choices and changes colour depending on the player's alignments; if the player is neutral it will remain grey, being good will turn the dog's coat to golden and evil will turn it to black. There are no other animals in the game, save for neutral rabbits and birds, a fact commented on by one NPC who notices the oddness of carriages with no horses. In the downloadable content \\"See the Future\\", it is possible to change the dog's breed with potions. The three choices are Dalmatian, Bloodhound and Husky.  Family and relationships  In Fable II, it is possible for the player's character to get married, including same-sex marriage, and have children. Divorce with the player's spouse can occur, and can be initiated by either the spouse or the player themselves. As with a real family, time spent around and interacting with them will keep the bond between them strong and reduce the chance of them leaving. It is possible to become widowed through the death of a partner. It is also possible for the player character's children to die through cot death or disease, or to run away from home to become an adventurer, in which case the player can rescue them from danger. The relationships, as in the original Fable, are initiated by flirting, gift-giving, and the common expression. By performing a potential mate's favourite expressions, or giving them their preferred gifts, they will become infatuated more easily. Beyond a certain level of interest, or payment in the case of prostitute characters, a character may proposition the player for sex. Unprotected sex may lead to the birth of a child, but can also lead to sexually transmitted disease; this does affect the player, as it may lead to sterilisation. If the player has purchased or found a condom, they will have the option of protected sex. No sex is actually shown; the screen is black when the option is selected.  Character morphing  Fable II enhances the system of morphing one's character based on their actions as introduced in Fable. Character morphing revolves around two major alignment scales: Good and Evil, and Purity and Corruption. Good players will enable a pleasant-looking Hero, with tanned skin and light hair, while evil players will have a more frightening look, with pale skin and black hair. Pure players will find that their hero will have a clear complexion and a halo, while corrupt players will find their hero with a flawed complexion and horns. These scales are independent of one another, meaning that it is possible to be both good and corrupt simultaneously or any other variation. Also related to character morphing is the character's slimness or fatness, determined by what foods the player eats; fruits and vegetables (mainly celery), make the player thinner, while alcohol, meat and pies make the player fatter. In addition, fruits and vegetables give the player purity points (because no animals are harmed in their creation/consumption), while meats and alcohol give the player corruption points (because animals were harmed in their creation/consumption and they can cause drunkenness, respectively). This has no effect on gameplay other than attractiveness or the lack thereof in the eyes of NPCs. Levelling up stats will also alter the player character's appearance. Increasing the Physique level will make the Hero more muscular. Increasing the Skill stat will make the Hero taller. A high level of Will power and spells create glowing blue markings, called Will Lines, all over the body.  Jobs  Unlike Fable, the player does not acquire money through doing quests, but by doing jobs around Albion. These are Blacksmith, Woodcutter, Bartender, Assassin, Civilian Displacement (Slaver), Bounty Hunter, and Merchant. The first three involve correctly pressing the A button during certain times, and the latter three are combat related. Merchant, however, is done by taking advantage of the economies of each town, buying low and selling to richer vendors for a profit. The jobs become available depending on how much renown the player has and story progression. The trade skill jobs can be done over and over again for a certain number of days, but the side quest jobs are single use, requiring the player to wait for another task to become available. The trade skills can be leveled up to five stars via promotions, allowing for more money to be made.  Recreation  Exploration plays a primary role in the game. As in the original Fable, gameplay is very linear; however, main story-advancing missions may be performed whenever the player chooses and there are additional missions that do not affect the storyline. The player may also choose to perform any of the many different jobs, gambling-based mini-games, participating in the arena-style minigame called the Crucible, explore dungeons, tombs, and caves, or roam the countryside. The player may even choose to kill innocents in town. All of these optional diversions can result in rewards for the player in the form of additional wealth, items, experience points, or character-altering attributes. Exploration is essential to discovering much of the game's hidden content, in the form of 50 silver keys, special treasure chests, 9 Demon Doors, and 50 gargoyles that can be destroyed. Co-operative play Players are able to drop in and out of other players' games at will. The host player can set certain rules; e.g. how loot gained is split between the players and if friendly fire is active. The joining player cannot load their custom hero; they must select a premade male or female character. This \\"henchman\\" cannot buy property or gamble in their friend's world, nor can he/she accept quests. Co-op can be achieved through Xbox Live, System Link, and by playing on a single console. Fable II did not ship with online cooperative, but a free patch has been available from Xbox Live since the European and American release date which adds this functionality. Without the patch, players cannot play online due to being disconnected from Xbox Live. On 14 July 2008 at E3 2008 lead designer Peter Molyneux demonstrated 'Albion Orbs'. These orbs show where other players are in their worlds and allows bringing them into their world to co-op with. Only orbs for friends are initially viewable, with all players viewable if an in- game setting is changed. Online chat is automatically enabled between players that can see each other's orbs. While on the same console, a second player with their own account can drop in and out as a \\"henchman\\" to the first player. If the second player on the same console does not have an account of their own, the henchman is made in a brief character-creation screen that pauses the game. Henchmen created this way are not saved into the main player's game. The first player also decides how much bounty the henchman will obtain, e.g. gold and experience. The second player is also able to port any experience, renown and gold to their own Fable II Hero via a memory card if they have imported their character and not created the henchman from scratch. Also, it is possible to use a profile on the Xbox 360 itself to create a henchman, the earned gold and experience being transferred there.  Synopsis = Setting  Like the first game, Fable II takes place in the land of Albion, but about 500 years later in a setting resembling the early modern period. The Heroes' Guild no longer exists; after the defeat of Jack of Blades, Albion entered a period of relative safety and stability during which the increasingly corrupt Heroes were no longer needed. Ultimately the people of Albion revolted against the Guild and destroyed it. Firearms of exotic design now dominate the art of war. Cities such as Bowerstone have now greatly expanded, and the old ideas and religions of medieval Albion have since been ousted by modern ideals of science and philosophy. There are fewer locations than in the first game, however they have been expanded upon greatly. The islands of Witchwood and Hook Coast, as well as the Northern Waste have been rendered inaccessible. There are also many references to the land of Samarkand in the game, though the player never travels there. At the beginning of the player's childhood, they start out in Bowerstone's slums, then grow up in a Gypsy camp near Bower Lake. The world in Fable II is fully dynamic, interactive and mostly free roaming with no set quest path to take. Since the game takes place over a hero's lifetime, many things can change; Molyneux gave an example of a trade camp that the player could either help or destroy. Trading in such camps would increase their profit, resulting in a small town growing around them. Additionally, every accessible property (those that can be entered by the player) in the world can be purchased (except for the Tattered Spire), and ownership of unique buildings can unlock further quests. In addition to purchasing and renting homes, businesses and stalls are now available for purchase. These businesses produce income for the player every 5 minutes, depending on the quality of the business, the economy level of the town, and the opinion of the shop owner for the player (a shopkeeper with a high opinion will work harder), and the rent or goods prices set by the player; this happens even while the Xbox 360 is turned off. Rent is also accumulated every 5 minutes. Also, if the player visits his own shops, the quality of their goods will improve, and improve the quality of the shop. Players are able to furnish the houses with furniture and other items available for sale. In addition, titles will be awarded for buying property; if one were to buy every building and piece of land in a town he/she may become the mayor of that town; owning more land leads to higher titles such as king/queen, and eventually Emperor of the entire land of Albion. Players can become more Pure by setting prices and rent low, or more Corrupt by increasing them. The environment in Fable II features trees with branches and leaves that are individually animated according to their own physics, each tree having roughly 120,000 leaves. There are also around 15 million poppies in Albion. Plot The game begins in the city of Bowerstone, where the protagonist, a young child known as Sparrow, lives in poverty with his/her older sister, Rose, and dreams about living in Castle Fairfax, the home of Lord Lucien. Their dreams are cut short when they hear a commotion at the market. A man known as Mystical Murgo is selling 'magical' wares and a magic box that grants a wish. Convinced by an old woman named Theresa, Sparrow and Rose decide to collect the five coins required for the box by completing jobs. During this time, they save a dog, which later takes up residence with them. When they finally collect the money needed, they buy the box and wish to live in Castle Fairfax. However, the box disappears in a flash of light, seemingly having failed to work. In the middle of the night, they are awakened by a guard, who escorts them to Castle Fairfax on Lucien's order. Overjoyed at their wish coming true, the two follow eagerly. After meeting Lucien and telling him of the box, he asks them to step in a circle on the floor, which emits a blue light but turns red, to Lucien's anger, upon his touch. Proclaiming that they are not any of the three \\"Heroes\\" he is seeking, and one of them is a fourth Hero, he kills Rose and wounds Sparrow, who falls out of a window. Upon waking up, Sparrow learns that they survived the fall due to their heroic line, and was rescued by Theresa and the dog. Ten years later, Lucien has been rebuilding the Tattered Spire, which grants the user enormous power. Sparrow is told by Theresa that they are the descendant of a great hero, and destined to bring Lucien's downfall. However, they must first find three heroes in order to defeat Lucien with their combined powers. Given the quest to stop Lucien's plans, the Hero begins a great journey, enlisting the aid of Hammer, the Hero of Strength; Garth, the Hero of Will, and Reaver, the Hero of Skill. Reaver, who is a former pirate living in Bloodstone, tells the Hero to take a Dark Seal to his friends in Wraithmarsh. The Seal turns out to be an item marking its bearer for sacrifice to the Court of Shadows, allowing Reaver to stay young forever. The Hero has a choice of either sacrificing their youth or the youth of a young woman trapped in the Court. The Hero then returns to Reaver at his mansion, which turns out to be a trap as Reaver has brought Lucien to attack the Hero, aiming to collect the bounty on them. However, Lucien turns on Reaver, causing him to rejoin the Hero. The Heroes perform a ritual near the old Guild of Heroes, but are attacked by Lucien, who kills the Hero and their dog and captures the others. The Hero is taken to a dream-like paradise, set when they were a child. The Hero forces their way through the nightmares, arrives at the Spire, and defeats Lucien with a music box from the nightmares. Lucien is killed by either the Hero or Reaver. Theresa then appears and grants the Hero one of three wishes: \\"Sacrifice\\", which will resurrect the thousands of people killed during the construction of the Tattered Spire; \\"Love\\", which will resurrect the Hero's dog, sister, and family (if the Hero was married); or \\"Wealth\\", which will grant the Hero one million pieces of gold. The Heroes then part ways and Theresa tells the Hero that while Albion is theirs to enjoy, the Spire is hers. In the DLC See The Future, the Hero visits Theresa once again at the Spire. Theresa shows the Hero a vision of the future showing them as King or Queen of Albion, and also a child in the crib by the throne who will become a great hero, setting the background for Fable III. Marketing=Tales of Albion Lionhead Studios released a section on their website entitled \\"Tales of Albion\\", which provides a back-story to Fable, Fable: The Lost Chapters, and Fable II. In \\"Fragments of the Old Kingdom\\", it details how the Archon came to power in Albion, and how the Heroes' Guild was founded. \\"Tales\\" also chronicles the end of the Heroes and ruin of their Guild in \\"Fall of the Heroes\\", and \\"Travels in Today's Albion\\" (which has been completed since its release) describes where some places are and has a little description of each notable area/artefact. Online competitions Just as Lionhead has done with The Movies, online competitions were made available through Lionhead's forums. One such competition was naming a title to be used in the game, similar to the first game wherein a character was addressed by various titles that the character purchased from a \\"Title Vendor\\". Lionhead has stated these titles would be bought but they have to be earned first. They are bought from a town crier in Fable II; the winning title was Lionheart, which can be bought for 2000 gold or earned for free by winning in The Crucible. An \\"insult the hero\\" competition also took place and the winner is yet to be announced. On 30 May, Lionhead held a competition for artwork that would be used in the game; there has been no winner announced to date. Video diaries * On 24 May 2007, episode one of The Lionhead Diaries, examining the love and emotion aspect of Fable II was released. * On 30 July 2007, episode two was released, highlighting the one button in the combat system, and featured the Lionhead staff playing a game of football against fellow Microsoft satellite Rare and winning. It also included a professional combat specialist instructing the animation staff. * On 8 October 2007, episode three was released, going in depth about the Central Technology Group, and featured Lionhead's 10-year Anniversary. * On 11 January 2008, episode four was released, focusing on how the graphics department made the world of Albion. * On 19 March 2008, episode five was released, looking at magic, GDC 2008 and co-op. * On 22 June 2008, episode six \\"Art and the Hero\\" was released, looking at the artwork of the Hero, Albion, and many different characters in Fable II. * On 2 October 2008, episode seven \\"Music and Audio\\" was released, showing how and where the main scores were made, where the voice-overs were recorded and taking a brief glimpse at the various voice talents for the game. * On 8 January 2009, episode eight \\"Finishing Fable II & Creating Knothole Island\\" was released, detailing the Lionhead Team's euphoria over having finally completed Fable II, and giving a brief look at how Knothole Island was made, and why it didn't ship out in December 2008. * On May 2009 episode nine \\"See the Future\\" Fable II Pub Games In August 2008 Lionhead Studios released Fable II Pub Games. This includes three of the games that can be played in pubs throughout Albion: Fortune's Tower, Keystone and Spinner Box. For 800 Microsoft Points all three games can be downloaded on the Xbox Live Marketplace. Alternatively, some video game retailers offered a product code when a pre-order for Fable II was made. Limited Edition Before the game was released, there was a production problem resulting in the Hobbe figurine, special box, and fate cards being removed from the collector's edition package. Due to the loss of these items, the suggested retail price was decreased to the normal game price in some stores. As an apology, Lionhead Studios created a free music album available for download over the Internet (not Xbox Live) that contains several songs from Fable and three songs from Fable II, as well as printable pdf versions of the fate cards to be released. There was another supply chain issue that occurred in North America that caused some Limited Edition games not to have the token card for in-game content. A Limited Edition was available on its release date with the following extra features: * Alternative packaging including cardboard slip cover * 1 token card code for in-game content (downloaded over Xbox Live) * Bonus disc containing the \\"Making of Fable II\\" There was also a 2nd European release of the Limited Edition game which featured the extra features minus the token card code for downloadable content. Downloadable content The first downloadable content (DLC), \\"Knothole Island\\", includes the ability to resurrect the player's dog by sacrifice. It was released 13 January 2009, and features a new map, with new items and quests. The DLC includes 3 new achievements worth 100 points. A free update allows players who haven't purchased \\"Knothole Island\\" to still play online with others who did. \\"Knothole Island\\" is available for 800 Microsoft Points. The DLC was awarded positive to average reviews. It holds a score of 66/100 on Metacritic. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer awarded it a score of 6/10 while Tom Orry of VideoGamer.com awarded it a score of 7/10 saying that \\"Knothole Island is a good effort but far from the standard the full game set.\\" The second DLC, \\"See the Future\\", includes the ability to change the player's dog's breed. It was released 12 May 2009 The DLC includes a quest based around three cursed items from Murgo the Trader. In addition to these new quests and items, one new area is included and players have the ability to change the breed of their dog as well as the ability to get their dog back if players chose not to resurrect their dog at the end of the main storyline. The DLC includes 13 new achievements worth 250 points. It is available for 560 Microsoft Points. The DLC was met with positive criticism: \\"[See The Future] should be an essential purchase for Fable fans. It doesn't change things enough to win over anyone who didn't enjoy the main game, but as an expansion it extends the game in ways that are certainly worth experiencing.\\" As of September 2009, the entire Fable II game is available for download through Microsoft's Xbox Live Game Marketplace. When first released, the downloadable version of the game was broken up into 5 game episodes that play identical to the disc version of the game, and the first episode of the game was free to download, while Episodes 2, 3, 4, and 5 could be purchased within the game. Any player who purchased the disc version after the first episode can transfer all save data. Currently, only the entire game can be purchased, and Episode 1 is no longer available as a demo. The downloadable version features the complete version of the disc-based game, as well as full compatibility with the previously released game add-ons, \\"Knothole Island\\" and \\"See the Future\\". On 7 September 2009, a compilation of the Fable II disc with all the downloadable content was made available in Europe, sold as \\"Fable II - Game of the Year Edition\\". On 5 January 2010, the \\"Game of the Year Edition\\" was made available in North America using the Platinum Hits branding. Reception=Critical reception Fable II received critical acclaim from critics citing its adherence to the original, while praising the changes that redefined the game system. Eurogamer welcomed the \\"bread crumb\\" trail feature in the game, \\"as leads you ever onwards to your next objective, but even though you can't get lost it still allows for deep exploration.\\" OXM lauded the game as \\"probably the most consistent sequel ever made\\" and suggested combat is \\"great when you're winning and nothing but irritating when you're losing.\\" Edge ranked the game #52 on its list of \\"The 100 Best Games To Play Today\\", stating that \\"With a quest that tugs you through to the plot and a bucolic paradise ripe for exploration, never before has so much work been put into making sure the humble player feels special.\\" People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) praised Fable II for its animal-friendly nature, giving it the Proggy Award for the most animal-friendly game of 2008, saying they enjoyed the game's pro-vegetarianism, giving the player purity points for eating non-meat products and corruption points for eating meat. However, there are also achievements encouraging players to hurt particular animals. Sales According to NPD, the game attained the status of best-selling title in the United States across all platforms for its debut month of October 2008 with 790,000 copies sold. Such sales volume occurred despite the game's release on 24 October consequently allowing only nine days of sales before the end of the month. The game received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Fable II was a success, and, with approximately 3.5 million copies sold as of 11 March 2010, it is a best-selling RPG title for Xbox 360. Awards *IGN Best of 2008: **Best Original Score (Xbox 360) *X-play's Best Game of 2008 award *Joystiq's Best Game of 2008 award *Best Action and Adventure Game of 2008, British Academy Video Games Awards In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die. Technical issues A number of users, writing on the Fable II message board, have experienced technical issues with the game. The most notable were the freezing, progression bugs, and incompatibility with standard-definition television screens. Sequel Fable III was officially announced at Gamescom on 19 August 2009. It was released on Xbox 360 in October 2010 and on Microsoft Windows in May 2011.

It is the unique example of a chantefable, literally, a \\"sung story\\", a combination of prose and verse (similar to a prosimetrum). History The work probably dates from the late 12th or early 13th century, and is known from only one surviving manuscript, discovered in 1752 by medievalist Jean- Baptiste de La Curne de Sainte-Palaye (BnF, Fonds Fran√ßais 2168).Karl Uitti. \\"Aucassin et Nicolette\\" in Dictionary of the Middle Ages, Vol. 1, pg. 642‚Äì644 Stylistically, the chantefable combines elements of many Old French genres, such as the chanson de geste (e.g., The Song of Roland), lyric poems, and courtly novels‚Äîliterary forms already well-established by the 12th century. Aucassin et Nicolette is the only known chantefable, the term itself having been derived from the story's concluding lines: \\"No cantefable prent fin\\" (\\"Our chantefable is drawing to a close\\"). Plot summary The story beginsThe plot summary is extracted with alterations from Library of the World's Best Literature, Ancient and Modern ‚Äì Volume 2, ed. Charles Dudley Warner, 1896. See \\"Aucassin and Nicolette\\" by Frederick Morris Warren, pg. 943. with a song which serves as prologue; and then prose takes up the narrative. It recounts the tale of Aucassin, son of Count Garin of Beaucaire, who so loved Nicolette, a Saracen maiden, who had been sold to the Viscount of Beaucaire, baptized and adopted by him, that he had forsaken knighthood and chivalry and even refused to defend his father's territories from enemies. Accordingly, his father ordered the Viscount to send Nicolette away, but instead the Viscount locked her in a tower of his palace. Aucassin is imprisoned by his father to prevent him from going after his beloved Nicolette. But Nicolette escapes, hears Aucassin lamenting in his cell, and comforts him with sweet words. She flees to the forest outside the gates, and there, in order to test Aucassin's fidelity, builds a rustic home to await his arrival. When he is released from prison Aucassin hears from shepherd lads of Nicolette's hiding-place, and seeks her bower. The lovers, united, resolve to leave the country. They board a ship and are driven to the (fictional) kingdom of \\"Torelore\\", whose king they find in child-bed while the queen is with the army. After a three years' stay in Torelore they are captured by Saracen pirates and separated. The wind blows Aucassin's boat back to Beaucaire - where he succeeds to Garin's estate. Meanwhile another wind carries Nicolette to \\"Cartage\\" (perhaps a play on Carthage or Cartagena). The sight of the city reminds her that she is the daughter of its king. She informs the king and soon it is planned that she should marry a Saracen king. She avoids this by disguising herself as a minstrel. She then sets sail for Beaucaire to rejoin her beloved Aucassin. There, before Aucassin who does not immediately recognize her, she sings of her own adventures and the love between them. Finally, in due time she makes herself known to him, and the two marry. The story ends by saying that now the two have found (lasting) happiness the narrator has nothing left to say. Major themes Critics have seen the story as a parody of such genres as the epic, the romance, and the saint's life. \\"Few Old French genres escape parody in this concise literary encyclopedia.\\" For example, the theme of distant love (amor de lonh), common in Proven√ßal poetry, is reversed: the lady dresses up as a troubadour and seeks out her beloved man. Many of the scenes which seem outwardly comedic, such as the pregnant King (more gender reversal) or wars fought with cheese and apple projectiles (wars are usually fought over food, not with food), are further examples of flipping traditional literary tropes on their heads. Aucassin's speech that he would prefer hell to heaven because hell's inmates are likely to be more entertaining is a play on Saints Lives. Even the names are at odds, \\"Aucassin\\" (al-Kassim?) sounds more Saracen than the very Christian \\"Nicolette\\". The story and manuscript derive from the bourgeois Arras region in Picardy, not from the aristocratic and courtly Isle de France of Paris. It satirizes courtly love, turning it upside down. The story was included in Mortimer J. Adler's Gateway to the Great Books (1962) collection, which called it one of the freshest and most delightful \\"springtime flowers of literature.\\"Mortimer Adler. Gateway to the Great Books: Volume 2: Imaginative Literature I. Gateway to the Great Books Index Later mentions Dealt with in Walter Pater's work on \\"The Renaissance\\".

Shackley's School\\", and Thomas Cooke taught there.White's Directory, entry of \\"professions and trades\\" for York, 1840. Comprehensive Until 1985, it was an all-boys' grammar school. With the reorganisation of education in York in 1985, the school changed its name to Archbishop Holgate's School, and became a co-educational [comprehensive] school. During this transition period the outdoor swimming pool was converted to an indoor pool, a new sports hall was built, and upgrades were made to music, design and technology, home economics and other facilities. The school's facilities now include an indoor heated swimming pool, a chapel and a boathouse on the River Ouse. In 2009 a ¬£4.3 million two-storey learning centre with landscaping, parking and bike storage, called the LearningCentre@AHS was built, and now serves as the home of the school's sixth form facilities. Former headteachers Recent headmasters have included Donald Frith OBE (1959‚Äì1978), Dr J M Frost (1979‚Äì1984), and Alan Walker, an old boy and former English teacher at the school (1984‚Äì92), all of whom have since died. Dr Frost went on to become principal of the then-New York 6th Form college (now York College (York)), established in the building previously occupied by Ashfield Secondary Modern School, and opened as part of the reorganisation in 1985. The last headmaster was John Harris (1992‚Äì2010), who joined the school when it had the lowest results in York, and saw it through expansion from 439 students in 1992 to almost 900 and the best exam results in the school's history before his retirement in 2010. The current headmaster is Andrew Daly, who prior to joining the school, held a position in the senior leadership team at St Wilfrid's Catholic School and Sixth Form College in Wakefield.

Reese is considered to be the biggest draft bust in Buccaneers history. Reese played college football in Bethune-Cookman College and was drafted in the second round of the 1982 NFL Draft by the Buccaneers. The Buccaneers intended to draft him in the first round, but a broken communication resulted in their mistakenly drafting Sean Farrell. They were so convinced of his talent that they traded a future first round pick in the 1983 NFL Draft to get him, despite advance knowledge that 1983 would be a particularly strong draft class. Although highly talented, Reese had trouble making the mental adjustment to professional football. Frustration over his inability to excel, along with his unpreparedness for the NFL lifestyle, led to problems with alcohol and cocaine. Reese's best season in the NFL came in 1983. He played in all 16 games that season, scoring one sack and two interceptions. Reese only lasted two seasons with the Bucs before being traded to the Rams for a 12th round draft pick in 1984. He played eleven games with the Rams, who then sent him to rehab and released him. He signed with the San Francisco 49ers in 1985, but was released before the season after again failing a drug test. Ironically, the man that the Buccaneers drafted initially due to the communication error, Sean Farrell, would go on to have a productive NFL career that lasted a decade. Reese served two two-year sentences at Okaloosa Correctional Institution for cocaine possession and parole violation: one from 2002 to 2004, and another from 2005 to 2007.

It is one of the few U2 songs without Bono on lead vocals, instead featuring country singer Johnny Cash. Based on the Old Testament's Book of Ecclesiastes and its narrator \\"The Preacher\\", the song lyrically describes the narrator wandering through a post-apocalyptic world \\"in search of experience\\", sampling all facets of human culture and hoping to find meaning in life.Stockman (2005), p. 115 Cash's haggard voice is juxtaposed against a synthesised bassline and mostly electronic instrumentation. Background Cash recorded the vocals for the song in Dublin in February 1993 during the Zooropa sessions. The song underwent several provisional titles, including \\"The Preacher\\" and \\"Wandering\\".Rolling Stone (1994), p. 201 Producer Brian Eno tried to get Bono to sing the song, but Bono maintained it was Cash's voice he imagined singing the song. Bono and Cash had previously worked on a song called \\"Ellis Island\\".McGee (2008), p. 158 Composition The lyrics describe a man searching for God in a post- Apocalyptic world. He expresses concern over society's diminished view of Jesus Christ; \\"They say they want the Kingdom but they don't want God in it.\\" There is little guitar from the Edge, and Adam Clayton's synthesised bassline is the prominent musical sound throughout the song. However, Larry Mullen's soft drumbeats can be heard. As previously noted, this is one of the few songs not to be sung by Bono, but he does provide a country-style howl towards the song's ending. In an interview, Flood, one of the song's producers, singled out \\"The Wanderer\\" as one of Zooropa's highlights; \\"For me, that's a great song and it translates emotionally brilliantly, yet there's a load of sonic experiments going on there. There's the idea of this person sort of wandering through this desolate landscape, but there's an air of nonchalance. Everything about the lyric, the delivery, the sound of his voice, the music -- it just seems fantastic. It delivers on all levels\\" . At the end of the song (on most versions of Zooropa), there are 30 seconds of silence (4:45‚Äì5:15). Following this, an alarm-sound fades in at 5:15. The alarm sound repeats, even once it has completely started (at about 5:20). The alarm sound finishes at 5:41. Apparently, this is the same sound some DJs hear after 10 seconds of dead air on the radio. Live performances Johnny Cash performed \\"The Wanderer\\" on at least one occasion at the Nevada County fairgrounds in Grass Valley, California, in August 1993. U2 played it in a television special entitled I Walk the Line: A Night for Johnny Cash, following Cash's death in 2003. Bono performed the song in a similar fashion to Cash's rendition, with The Edge adding dramatic falsetto background vocals that were not on the original recording. On 2 July 2011, U2 performed an extended snippet of the song, running for two verses, in Nashville, Tennessee as a part of their U2 360¬∞ Tour. Bono explained to the audience they chose to play the song in Nashville as a tribute to Cash and his wife June. \\"The Wanderer\\" was used as the intermission song during U2's 2015 Innocence + Experience Tour. An extended version of the song including an extra verse is included on the soundtrack to the film Faraway, So Close! The extended version is 5:16 in length. The song was included on the Johnny Cash compilations, The Essential Johnny Cash (Legacy/Columbia, 2002) and The Legend of Johnny Cash (American/Island, 2005) and The Legend. Reception According to William Richey and Kevin J.H. Dettmar, U2 \\"skillfully exploited the image of Johnny Cash in a... provocative way\\", clarifying that \\"they seemingly imbue their vision of a postapocalyptic wasteland with a deeper sense of poignance and sincerity because Cash's storied voice is associated in the public mind with a man whose very public struggles with drugs, alcohol, and love prove that he has 'walked the line'.\\"Richey, Dettmar (1999), p. 4 Other reviews of the song have been mixed. In Spin's 20th anniversary review of Zooropa, Rob Harvilla described \\"The Wanderer\\" as being \\"... monumentally incongruous and gets a little sassy about the separation of church and state.\\" The A.V. Club's Annie Zaleski described as \\"surprisingly shapeless, despite faint bass twang, sighing background vocals, and minimal drums.\\" References Footnotes Bibliography  Category:U2 songs Category:Johnny Cash songs Category:1993 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Brian Eno Category:Songs written by Bono Category:Songs written by the Edge Category:Songs written by Adam Clayton Category:Songs written by Larry Mullen Jr. Category:Song recordings produced by Flood (producer) ","title":"The Wanderer (U2 song)"},{"id":"4436998","text":"Hacke is a German surname.

Additionally, Houser's Offering of the Sacred Pipe is on display at United States Mission to the United Nations in New York City.  Childhood and school days  Born in 1914 to Sam and Blossom Haozous on the family farm near Apache, OklahomaHOUSER (HAOZOUS), ALLAN (1914-1994). Oklahoma Historical Society. Retrieved March 30, 2011 and Fort Sill, Houser was the first member of his family from the Warm Springs Chiricahua Apache tribe born outside of captivity since Geronimo's 1886 surrender and the tribe's imprisonment by the U.S. government. The tribe had been led in battle by the spiritual leader Geronimo, who would later rely on his grandnephew Sam Haozous, Allan's father, to serve as his translator. In 1934, Houser left Oklahoma at the age of 20 to study at Dorothy Dunn's Art Studio at the Santa Fe Indian School in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Dunn's method encouraged working from personal memory, avoiding techniques of perspective or modeling, and stylization of Native iconography. For the latter, Houser made hundreds of drawings and canvasses in Santa Fe and was one of Dunn's top students, but he found the program too constricting.  Early career  In 1939, Houser began his professional career by showing work at the 1939 New York World's Fair and the Golden Gate International Exposition. He received his first major public commission to paint murals at the Main Interior Building in Washington, DC. He also married Anna Maria Gallegos of Santa Fe, his wife for 55 years. In 1940, he received another commission with the US Department of Interior to paint life-sized indoor murals, then returned to Fort Sill to study with Swedish muralist Olle Nordmark, who encouraged Houser to explore sculpture. He made his first wood carvings that year. When World War II interrupted Houser's life and career path, he moved his growing family to Los Angeles where he found work in the L.A. shipyards. Houser worked by day and continued to paint and sculpt by night, making friends among students and faculty at the Pasadena Art Center. Here, he was first exposed to the streamlined modernist sculptural statements of artists like Jean Arp, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, and the English sculptor Henry Moore. These three men ‚Äì along with the English sculptress Barbara Hepworth, who was among the first sculptors to place sculptural voids within the solid planes of her works ‚Äì would come to have a huge influence on Houser. After World War II, Houser applied for a commission at the Haskell Institute in Lawrence, Kansas. Haskell, a Native American boarding school, lost many graduates to the war and wanted a sculptural memorial to honor them. Though Houser had been carving in wood since 1940, he had never before sculpted in stone. He convinced the jury with his drawings and his conviction, and completed the monumental work Comrades in Mourning from white Carrara marble in 1948. It has become an iconic work, both for the artist and for Native American art in general.  Teaching  In 1949, Houser received a Guggenheim Fellowship in sculpture and painting, which granted him two years to work on art and still provide for growing family. From 1952 to 1962, Houser worked as an art teacher at the Intermountain Indian School in Brigham City, Utah, which was primarily a Navajo boarding school. The Intermountain years gave Houser time to teach, raise a family, and focus on his painting. He completed hundreds of paintings there, experimenting with watercolors, oils and other media. While at Intermountain, he also worked as a children's book illustrator, providing drawings and paintings for seven titles ‚Äì including an illustrated biography on the life of his granduncle Geronimo. In 1962, Houser was asked to join the faculty of a new Native American art school, the Institute of American Indian Arts. He returned to Santa Fe with his family to head up the Institute's sculpture department. Casting his first bronzes in 1967, Houser was student and teacher as well, bringing forth his own history and ideas for a student body culled from every corner of Native America. He began working with the iconographies of other tribes, using modernist sculptural influences to forge the tribal and the abstract into a visual lexicon all his own. During the early 1970s, Houser continued to teach at the Institute and began the rigorous production and exhibition cycle for which he became well known. As head of the sculpture department, he felt compelled to work in as many sculptural media as possible, evidenced by his solo exhibition of stone, bronze and welded steel sculptures at the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona in 1970. The following year, Houser exhibited paintings and sculpture at the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, and in 1973 was awarded the Gold Medal in Sculpture at the Heard Museum Exhibition. Exhibitions, awards, and accolades continued. In 1975, he was asked to paint the official portrait of former U.S. Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall. That same year, he had a solo exhibition at the Governor's Gallery at the State Capitol in Santa Fe. After thirteen years at IAIA, Houser retired from full-time teaching to devote himself to sculpture.  Later work  \\"Legends Begin,\\" bronze, at Allard Hall Law School building in Vancouver Houser's retirement in 1975 marked the beginning of the most prolific stage of his career. With time, materials, and the family compound in southern Santa Fe county, Houser honed the visual language that was to become his artistic legacy. Fusing Native subject matter with the abstract forms and sculptural voids of his Modernist peers, Houser carried the mantle of both Native American and Modernism to new levels, bringing forth such memorable images as the Lead Singer, Abstract Crown Dancer, and The Mystic. Houser also continued to produce remarkable figurative pieces as well, including the life-sized bronze work Chiricahua Apache Family, dedicated in 1983 at the Fort Sill Apache Tribal Center in Apache, OK. The piece honored both the memory of his parents, Sam and Blossom, and commemorates the 70th anniversary of the release of his tribe's prisoners-of- war from Fort Sill. Houser's work was explored in a series on American Indian artists for the Public Broadcasting System (PBS). Other artists in the series included R. C. Gorman, Helen Hardin, Charles Loloma, Joseph Lonewolf, and Fritz Scholder.Steven Leuthold, \\"13: Native American Art and Artists in Visual Arts Documentaries from 1973 to 1991,\\" in On the Margins of Art Worlds, ed. Larry Gross. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1995, 268. Accessed via Questia, which is a subscription required source. In 1985, Houser's monumental bronze, Offering of the Sacred Pipe, was dedicated at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York City. A year later, he made a bronze bust of Geronimo to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the surrender of the Chiricahua Apaches. A cast of the bust was later presented to the National Portrait Gallery, where it remains in the permanent collection. In his last five years, Houser produced a remarkable number of pieces, and received many awards for his life's work. In 1989 he dedicated As Long as the Waters Flow, a monumental bronze commissioned for the Oklahoma State Capitol building in Oklahoma City. In 1991, he presented a casting of a bronze Sacred Rain Arrow to the Smithsonian Institution. In the dedication before the US Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, he dedicated the work to the American Indian. And in 1992, he became the first Native American to receive the National Medal of Arts, awarded at a ceremony at the White House by President George H. W. Bush. In 1993, Houser was honored by the dedication of the Allan Houser Art Park at the Institute of American Indian Arts, and in 1994, he returned to Washington, DC for the last time to present the United States government with the sculpture, May We Have Peace, a gift, he said, \\"To the people of the United States from the First Peoples.\\" The gift was accepted by First Lady Hillary Clinton for installation at the Vice President's residence.  Drawings  Houser's primary skill as a draftsman is evident in the astounding volume of drawn work that was left behind in the Allan Houser Archive, located at the Houser family compound and sculpture garden in southern Santa Fe County, New Mexico. With over 6,000 images left behind, one can trace the remarkable output and varied subjects of an artist who began all of his creations, including paintings and sculptures, with the act of hand to paper.  Sculptures  While Houser's early career was marked by his drawings and paintings, it was for sculpture that he eventually became a world-renowned artist. Beginning in 1940 with simple wood carvings, Houser created his first monumental work in stone in 1949, the iconic piece Comrades in Mourning at the Haskell Institute in Lawrence, Kansas. But it would be quite some time before he had the time and resources to produce the remarkable bronzes shown here.  Collections  Allan Houser's work can be found in collections all over the world.

He was fortunate to have been the kind of artist who did not need to be \\"discovered\\" after his death, for he enjoyed a career in which he was able to create not just for his own satisfaction, but for an appreciative public as well. Upon his death, the honors kept coming. Among these was the installation of 19 monumental works of art in Salt Lake City during the 2002 Olympics, and a retrospective of 69 works at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, DC. in 2004‚Äî2005. The exhibition marked the first major show for the new museum, and over three million people viewed it while it was on display. As a teacher for most of his working life, Allan Houser also enjoys the legacy of having passed on his direction, patience and skills to generations of Native American artists, including many from the IAIA years who are, in turn, passing on their skills to other generations. After Houser's death in 1994, his legacy has been carried on by family members, including his two sons who have achieved success as sculptors, Philip Haozous and Bob Haozous, and his grandson, Sam Atakra Haozous, an experimental photographer. The non-profit Allan Houser Foundation is devoted to the proliferation of the Houser name. The family also maintains a commercial gallery of Allan Houser's work in downtown Santa Fe and the Allan Houser Compound, a foundry and sculpture garden located south of Santa Fe.Allan Houser.

The original body is disintegrated once reception at the destination is confirmed. In the story a woman is teleported to an alien planet, but the original is not disintegrated because reception cannot be confirmed at the time. Reception is later confirmed, and the original, not surprisingly, declines to \\"balance the equation\\" by re-entering the scanning and disintegrating device.

Part of the original house still stands, with a coat of arms in the corner, beside a family chapel. In spite of his family's wealth, as a young boy he often went about naked because he had given his clothing to the poor. At the age of sixteen years, Thomas entered the University of Alcal√° de Henares to study Arts and Theology. He became a professor there, teaching arts, logic, and philosophy, despite a continuing absentmindedness and poor memory.Foley O.F.M., Leonard. Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast, Franciscan Media In 1516, he decided to join the Augustinian friars in Salamanca and in 1518 was ordained a priest. He became renowned for his eloquent and effective preaching in the churches of Salamanca. Thomas composed beautiful sermons, among which stands out the Sermon on the Love of God, one of the great examples of sacred oratory of the 16th century. Charles V, upon hearing him preach, exclaimed, \\"This monsignor can move even the stones!\\". Charles named Thomas one of his councilors of state and court preacher in Valladolid, the residence of the Emperor when on his visits to the Low Countries. His scathing attacks on his fellow bishops earned him the title of reformer. Some of his sermons attacked the cruelty of bullfighting. He also had a great devotion to the Virgin Mary, whose heart he compared to the burning bush of Moses that is never consumed. Within the Order, he successively held the positions of prior of his local monastery, Visitor General, and Prior Provincial for Andalusia and Castile. In 1533, Thomas sent out the first Augustinian friars to arrive in Mexico. Charles V offered him the post of Archbishop of Granada but he would not accept it. Bishop Thomas of Vilanueva Heals The Sick, Murillo In 1544 he was nominated as Archbishop of Valencia and he continued to refuse the position until ordered to accept by his superior. Given a donation to decorate his residence, he sent the money to a hospital in need of repair. He began his episcopacy by visiting every parish in the Archdiocese to discover what the needs of the people were.\\"St. Thomas of Villanova\\", Midwest Augustinians Aided by his assistant bishop, Juan Segri√°, he put in order an archdiocese that for a century had not had direct pastoral government. He organized a special college for Moorish converts, and in particular an effective plan for social assistance, welfare, and charity. In 1547 he ordained as a priest Luis Beltr√°n, a noted missionary in South America. Thomas started Presentation Seminary in 1550. He was well known for his great personal austerity (he sold the straw mattress on which he slept in order to give money to the poor) and wore the same habit that he had received in the novitiate, mending it himself. Thomas was known as ‚Äúfather of the poor.‚Äù His continual charitable efforts were untiring, especially towards orphans, poor women without a dowry, and the sick. He possessed, however, an intelligent notion of charity, so that while he was very charitable, he sought to obtain definitive and structural solutions to the problem of poverty; for example, giving work to the poor, thereby making his charity bear fruit. \\"Charity is not just giving, rather removing the need of those who receive charity and liberating them from it when possible,\\" he wrote. He established boarding schools and high schools.\\"Saint Thomas of Villanova, O.S.A.\\", Augustinians of the Western United States Thomas died in Valencia on September 8, 1555 of angina at the age of 67.

They released over 30 songs under the name Children of the Corn, as they tried for a record deal. They got paid any way they could, rhyming for local DJs and selling mixtapes out of their trunks. The group disbanded after the death of Bloodshed in a car crash on March 2, 1997 at age 21 and the murder of Big L on February 15, 1999 at age 24.

A page break causes a form feed to be sent to the printer during spooling of the document to the printer. Thus it is one of the elements that contributes to pagination. Form feed Form feed is a page-breaking ASCII control character. It forces the printer to eject the current page and to continue printing at the top of another. Often, it will also cause a carriage return. The form feed character code is defined as 12 (0xC in hexadecimal), and may be represented as control+L or \`^L\`. In a related use, control+L can be used to clear the screen in Unix shells such as bash. In the C programming language (and other languages derived from C), the form feed character is represented as \`'\\\\f'\`. Unicode also provides the character as a printable symbol for a form feed (not as the form feed itself). The form feed character is considered whitespace by the C character classification function \`isspace()\`. Form feed is seldom used when programming with modern printers in modern operating environments like Windows, Unix, Linux or macOS. Instead, form feeds are generated by having the printing program call a form feed API function. For example, when printing using the .NET Framework, the PrintPageEventArgs.HasMorePages\` property is used to indicate a form feed is desired.  Semantic use  The form feed character is sometimes used in plain text files of source code as a delimiter for a page break, or as marker for sections of code. Some editors, in particular emacs and vi, have built-in commands to page up/down on the form feed character. This convention is predominantly used in Lisp code, and is also seen in C and Python source code. GNU Coding Standards require such form feeds in C. Editors like Vim and Emacs understand such sections and have shortcuts for moving among them. In Usenet, the form feed character is used by several newsreaders as a \\"spoiler character\\", causing them to automatically hide the following text until prompted, as a way to prevent spoilers from being inadvertently revealed.Spoilers on newsreaders.com The precise behavior depends on the client displaying the article: for example, Gnus displays \\"Next page...\\" in boldface, and switches to a second screen to display text after the form feed; slrn displays all non-space characters following the form feed as asterisks; Dialog turns the font and background color red between form feeds; and XRN simply inserts blank lines to fill up the remainder of the article display area so the user must scroll down to reveal the spoiler. This use of the form feed character is not supported by all newsreaders, and is not standardized, although it has appeared in a draft of a Usenet Best Practices document by the IETF's USEFOR working group, as a feature that user agents should (but are not required to) support.IETF USEFOR USEAGE Draft See also *Carriage control tape *Newline References Category:Control characters ","title":"Page break"},{"id":"4437183","text":"\\"Mr. Boy\\" is a science fiction novella by American writer James Patrick Kelly, originally published in the June 1990 issue of Asimov's Science Fiction. It tells the story of a wealthy boy in the year 2096 who falls in love with a working class girl who inspires him to abandon his decadent lifestyle. The story won the Asimov's Reader's Poll Award for Best Novella and was nominated for the Locus Poll Award and the Nebula Award. Since its original publication, it has been reprinted in several science fiction anthologies. Plot The story takes place in the year 2096 in the town of New Canaan, Connecticut, and centers on Peter Cage, who goes by the nickname \\"Mr. Boy\\". Peter has lived for 25 years but possesses the body of a 12-year-old as a result of continually undergoing genetic modification (\\"twanking\\") to reverse his biological clock. This process is done at the direction of his wealthy but emotionally distant mother. His mother has assumed the form of a three-quarters scale replica of the Statue of Liberty (also through gene twanking), which Peter lives inside. Peter has only ever interacted with his mother through robotic avatars which she controls ‚Äì her private quarters in the statue's head are inaccessible. Peter spends much of his time socializing with other wealthy children, including his best friend Stennie, who has been twanked to resemble a \\"grapefruit yellow stenonychosaurus\\". The children indulge in orgiastic gatherings such as \\"smash parties\\", where they destroy valuable antiques and kill animals. Peter and his social circle look down on members of the working class, referring to them as \\"stiffs\\". At school, Peter sees and falls in love with a girl named Treemonisha Joplin (named for the opera Treemonisha by ragtime composer Scott Joplin). After introducing himself to her, Peter learns that she comes from a working class family who operate a floristry business in a shopping mall. Peter brings Treemonisha to parties, but finds himself increasingly disillusioned with his life of privilege, and worries that the milieu of wealth and nihilism is having a corrupting influence on Treemonisha. In the story's climax, Peter angrily storms his mother, expressing resentment of his upbringing. He says that he intends to leave behind his life of comfort and become a working stiff, despite Treemonisha urging him against this and warning him that he is unprepared for a life of poverty. Peter forces entry into her sanctum in the head of the statue, and is surprised to find a cold cleanroom filled with computing hardware. Unbeknownst to him, his mother had been dead all along, existing only as a \\"downloaded intelligence\\". Peter leaves with Treemonisha, hoping that being poor is better than \\"being rich and hating yourself\\". In the final line, Peter asks Treemonisha to call him \\"Pete\\", rather than the \\"Mr. Boy\\" moniker he had previously used throughout the story.  Analysis  In an introduction to the story, Gardner Dozois draws parallels between \\"Mr. Boy\\" and the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald, alluding to the opening line of Fitzgerald's short story \\"The Rich Boy\\": \\"Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me.\\"  Publication history  \\"Mr. Boy\\" was originally published in the June 1990 issue of Asimov's Science Fiction. It has subsequently been reprinted in the following anthologies: * The Year's Best Science Fiction: Eighth Annual Collection (1991, edited by Gardner Dozois) * Modern Classic Short Novels of Science Fiction (1994, edited by Gardner Dozois) * Visions of Wonder (1996, edited by David G.

Andr√© Ren√© Lefebvre was born in Louvres, France (North of Paris, Val d'Oise). He began his career as an aviation engineer working for Voisin, then later for Renault and Citro√´n. He was also a racing driver and race car designer. After studying at Supa√©ro he began to work for Gabriel Voisin in March 1916. Voisin placed Lefebvre in charge of his Laboratoire where he worked on aviation projects until the end of World War I, and then automobiles. He is particularly noted for creating the Voisin C6 Laboratoire, which was a race car prepared for the 1923 French Grand Prix. Voisin C6 Laboratoire When Voisin ran into business problems in 1931, Lefebvre was recommended to Louis Renault. Renault was persuaded to recruit Lef√®bvre by Fran√ßois Lehideux, himself a senior executive within the company (who was also married to the daughter of Renault's brother). Lefebvre remained with Renault only until 1933, when he was hired by Andr√© Citro√´n to work on the Traction Avant project. After the death of Andr√© Citro√´n in 1935, Lef√®bvre continued his work at Citro√´n, now led by the innovative entrepreneur Pierre-Jules Boulanger, who came to the company from Michelin. Citro√´n DS Working with Citro√´n designers Flaminio Bertoni and Paul Mag√®s, Lef√®bvre created four of the most dramatic, boldly designed vehicles of 20th century: *Citro√´n Traction Avant (1934‚Äì1957) ‚Äì a large family sedan, a favourite of gangsters, the French resistance and the Gestapo, built for 23 years *Citro√´n 2CV (1948‚Äì1990) ‚Äì a small, advanced, utilitarian sedan, known as \\"the duck\\" or \\"Tin Snail\\", built for 42 years *Citro√´n DS (1955‚Äì1975) ‚Äì a radically advanced, large family sedan, seen as shark like, built for 20 years *Citro√´n HY (1947‚Äì1981) ‚Äì a corrugated, practical delivery van, built for 34 years The 1955 Citro√´n DS placed third in the 1999 Car of the Century competition, behind the Ford Model T and BMC Mini.

The name \\"Speed\\" was given to him by a childhood friend in high school. Levitch has appeared in multiple films and has had his poetic and philosophical works published in books and periodicals. Biography Levitch was born July 9, 1970 in New York City. He mostly grew up in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx, where he attended the Horace Mann School.Bruni, Frank. \\"Manhattan Through a Warped Window; Featured in a Film: A Homeless Tour Guide's Offbeat City View\\", The New York Times, October 1, 1998. Accessed May 4, 2008. \\"Mr. Levitch grew up in a middle-class Jewish family of five in Riverdale, the Bronx, and attended Horace Mann, a respected private school.\\" When he was 12, his parents bought a house in Westchester County, New York, and he was briefly a suburbanite. He longed to return to New York City and eventually did. In 1992 he received his tour guide license from the Central Park Conservancy. He later took a position with Apple and Gray Line Tours as a tour bus guide. He soon attracted a cultlike following, due not only to his fast talking style, but also for his obvious love of portraying his native city in psychedelic terms and with passionate philosophical ideas. Levitch's cult spread beyond New York when he became the subject of the 1998 documentary The Cruise. In 2000 he was a citizen of the art project Quiet, We Live in Sane. In 2012 Levitch premiered a new documentary video series, Up To Speed, on its own Hulu channel. Directed by Richard Linklater, the series takes viewers on virtual tours of American cities, conversing with inanimate objects like San Francisco's gold fire hydrant and Chicago's original Haymarket Riot memorial. Levitch is a member of The Ongoing Wow, a band in which he does spoken word over improvised music with Gals Panic and The Sinus Show member Jerm Pollet.

This can be used to quantify the mass transfer between phases, immiscible and partially miscible fluid mixtures (or between a fluid and a porous solide.g.: during adsorption process.). Quantifying mass transfer allows for design and manufacture of separation process equipment that can meet specified requirements, estimate what will happen in real life situations (chemical spill), etc. Mass transfer coefficients can be estimated from many different theoretical equations, correlations, and analogies that are functions of material properties, intensive properties and flow regime (laminar or turbulent flow). Selection of the most applicable model is dependent on the materials and the system, or environment, being studied. Mass transfer coefficient units * (mol/s)/(m2*mol/m3) = m/s Note, the units will vary based upon which units the driving force is expressed in. The driving force shown here as '{ \\\\Delta c_A}' is expressed in units of moles per unit of volume, but in some cases the driving force is represented by other measures of concentration with different units. For example, the driving force may be partial pressures when dealing with mass transfer in a gas phase and thus use units of pressure.

Later, the Comet moniker was adopted by NJ Transit for all of its non-powered single level commuter coaches. Additional series of cars bearing the Comet name, based on the original design, have since been built by Bombardier Transportation and Alstom. The successful design was adopted by numerous commuter agencies.  History = Comet I  Ridgewood These cars were the first of the Comet series, built by Pullman Standard in 1970‚Äì73 for the New Jersey Department of Transportation and used the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad's diesel-hauled commuter services. These were considered state of the art at the time, due to their all-aluminum body shell construction as well as their use of head-end power (HEP). Their automated entrance doors, designed for use with low platforms only, earned them the nickname \\"Sliders\\". 155 cars were built, with 35 cab cars, 110 trailer coaches and 10 bar cars. In 1987, the fleet was rebuilt by Bombardier at Barre, Vermont, with the 35 cab cars and a number of trailer cars receiving high doors, for ADA access and future compatibility with high platforms. They were given NJ Transit logos adjacent to the entrance doors at this time, as NJ Transit had taken over EL commuter service. The bar cars were converted to standard coaches. The low door cars were retired from service in 2005. 25 of the cars were sold to Utah Transit Authority (UTA) for the FrontRunner service, and 20 were leased to Metrolink in 2008 to help with an acute car shortage there. In March 2011, Metrolink returned the cars to FrontRunner upon the expiration of the lease. Metrolink also leased 15 cars directly from New Jersey Transit in 2009. These cars have not been used since 2011. The Comet I cars have become popular with western commuter lines as the low door setup is compatible with the low-platform stations in use. Eight Comet Is were sold to SEPTA, but are now out of service and put into storage. Some of these have recently been used in work service. NJ Transit retired the last of its Comet Is in March 2009. The Comets that were not sold to SEPTA, Metrolink, UTA or to private railroads and museum fleets were scrapped by 2010. Preserved examples are located at several museums, including the Whippany Railway Museum in Whippany, New Jerseyhttp://www.whippanyrailwaymuseum.net/exhibits/equipment/passenger- cars/comet-i-commuter-coaches and the Southern California Railway Museum.https://www.atrrm.org/2015/06/njt-comet-cars-entering-museum-service/ File:PS COMET CAB.pngCab car layout File:PS COMET TRAILER.pngTrailer car layout File:PS COMET BAR.pngBar car layout  Comet II  Plainfieldalt=NJT Comet II 5446, former cab car, at Plainfield The Comet II cars were built by Bombardier Transportation, which acquired the rights to the railcar's design from Pullman. The first order of cars was built for NJ Transit between 1982 and 1983. A second order, the Comet IIB, was purchased in 1988. These cars feature long end-doors with trapdoors over the stairs for use at both low-platform and high-platform stations. The cars are similar to the MBTA's BTC-1 and CTC-1 cars, built in 1978 by Pullman Standard. These cars were intended for use on lines formerly operated by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, operators of the Blue Comet train to Atlantic City. This led to the NJ Transit series of single-level cars becoming known as Comets. These cars have been overhauled by AAI Corporation and Alstom between 1999 and 2003 to make them aesthetically and technologically similar to the Comet IV series and are now compatible with later equipment. Shoreliner I and II coaches, purchased by Metro-North and the Connecticut Department of Transportation for use on non-electrified territories east of the Hudson River, are variations without long doors. Amtrak's Horizon coaches are also a variation without long, automatic doors. Metro-North also purchased Comet II coaches for use on the Port Jervis Line, where they ran until replaced by the Comet V. The Comet II cars have since been transferred to the East-of-Hudson pool, where they remain in service. SEPTA Regional Rail and Exo also purchased cars based on this class.  Comet III  Princeton Junctionalt=Comet III cab car 5003 on NJT train at Princeton Junction The Comet III cars, ordered by NJ Transit in 1990, feature center doors and long end-doors, permitting end doors to open and close with traps open. The Metro-North Shoreliner III fleet is a variation without long doors. The Comet III fleet was removed from revenue service in 2011, and remain in storage as of 2016. Metro-North also has a fleet of Comet IIIs from 1991.http://railfan44.rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=1567192 These cars were sold to NJT in 1998,http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=554082http://www.rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=744078 but were later sold back to Metro-North in 2008. The cars are currently stored at Croton.  Comet IV  A train made of Comet IV cars operates on an alt= The Comet IV cars, delivered in 1996 and purchased for NJ Transit's new Midtown Direct service, are similar to the Comet III cars, except they have no door by the engineer's cab and have thicker stripes. The Metro-North Shoreliner IV fleet is a variation without long doors. With the completion of the Comet V order, all Comet IV cab cars are no longer allowed to lead a train following the deactivation of their cab controllers. Instead, they are now used exclusively as blind coaches, in which they are inserted into a train consist and act as regular trailer cars.  Comet V  Dunellenalt= These cars were ordered in 1999 by NJ Transit and Metro-North Railroad and delivered between 2002 and 2004. Unlike previous series which were built by Bombardier, the Comet Vs were built by Alstom. The major external differences are a stainless-steel exterior, larger windows, and visible, roof-mounted air conditioning units. \\"Comaro\\" coaches Additionally, the \\"Comet\\" name has been applied to two distinct orders of coaches used on NJ Transit lines. As both orders had connections to the Arrow series of electric multiple unit (EMU) cars, they have become known as \\"Comaros\\", a portmanteau of \\"Comet\\" and \\"Arrow\\", and a play on the Chevrolet Camaro.  Comet IA  Metro North Comet IA #9198 at Port Jervis in 2002 Ten Comet IA cars (two cabs and eight trailers) were built in 1978 by General Electric for the MTA from surplus shells from Avco and Canadian Vickers remaining from the \\"Arrow III\\" EMU fleet built for NJDOT. They saw use primarily on the Port Jervis Line. These cars were retired in 2004 and scrapped by 2006.  Comet IB  NJT Comet IB Cab Car #5160 at Hoboken Terminal The Comet IB cars were rebuilt from 30 former Penn Central Arrow I EMU cars originally built by the St. Louis Car Company between 1968 and 1969. The Arrow I cars suffered from chronic mechanical problems and were out of service by 1980. The cars sat unused for several years, but realizing that the car bodies still had many decades of service left on them, NJ Transit made the decision to have them rebuilt into un- powered coaches. In 1987 and 1988 the cars were converted into cab control cars and trailer coaches by Morrison-Knudsen for use on non-electrified lines. After two decades of service the Comet IB cars were retired by NJ Transit in late 2008, with some surplus cars temporarily leased to Exo's predecessor agency, AMT. One car is now owned by SEPTA for the wire inspection train. = Amtrak California refurbishment = Amtrak San Joaquin train at the Martinez station, 2019. In 2008 the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) purchased 14 Comet IB coaches from NJ Transit for $75,000 per car to relieve overcrowding on the popular San Joaquin route. The Comet IB coaches were refurbished at Amtrak's Beech Grove shops to make them more suitable for inter-city rail service including adding reclining seats with tray tables (with only four seats in a row), more luggage racks, a restroom, WiFi and 6 workstation tables in the center of the car. 12 of the cars California purchased from NJ Transit were cab cars and were reconfigured into trailer cars by removing the train controls and plating over the cab windows. Instead they are used with Non-Powered Control Units that have cab controls and space to store checked baggage. Caltrans had planned to use the \\"Comet car\\" trainsets on trains starting in July 2013, but the refurbishing process took longer than expected. The first of the Caltrans Comet IB coaches, 5008 (ex-NJT 5165) was completed in March 2013. The first \\"Comet car\\" trainset was put into regular service on October 21, 2013, and the second trainset was put into regular service on April 15, 2014.

He amassed Primeira Liga totals of 224 matches and six goals over 11 seasons, mainly with Benfica with which he spent nine years, winning ten major titles. √Ålvaro represented Portugal at the 1986 World Cup and Euro 1984. In 1994, he began working as a coach. Club career Born in Lamego, Viseu District, √Ålvaro made his Primeira Liga debut in 1980 with Acad√©mica de Coimbra, moving subsequently to S.L. Benfica. After two seasons he became first choice, helping the Lisbon club to four leagues and as many domestic cups (three consecutive in the latter competition) while amassing more than 200 official appearances. In June 1990, after only 13 games in his last two seasons combined ‚Äì Benfica also appeared in two European Cup finals during that timeframe, but he was only a fringe player ‚Äì √Ålvaro left and signed with neighbours C.F. Estrela da Amadora, helping the team to the second round of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup; however, the league ended in relegation. He closed out his career at the age of 32 in the second division, with Leix√µes SC. One year after retiring, Magalh√£es began a coaching career, working with several first and second level teams. His first experience in the former tier was with G.D. Chaves in 1997‚Äì98, narrowly avoiding relegation. From 2003 to 2005, Magalh√£es was assistant manager at Benfica under Jos√© Antonio Camacho and Giovanni Trapattoni respectively, winning the league title in the second season. In the latter years of the decade he had spells in Romania and Angola, being Girabola champion in the latter country with G.D. Interclube, the second time in the Luanda club's history. Magalh√£es penned a new two-year contract in November 2009 but, on 29 March 2011, he was relieved of his duties. In early February 2012, he was appointed coach of fellow league side Clube Nacional de Benguela; shortly after, however, he returned to his country, signing with Associa√ß√£o Naval 1¬∫ de Maio which he had already managed in 2005‚Äì06's top flight and 2002‚Äì03's second tier. International career √Ålvaro was capped 20 times for Portugal, his debut coming on 16 December 1981 in a 2‚Äì5 defeat with Bulgaria, a friendly match. He was picked for the squads present at UEFA Euro 1984 and the 1986 FIFA World Cup. After the infamous Saltillo Affair in the latter tournament, √Ålvaro was one of the few players that did not defect from the national team, and his last international appearance came on 16 November 1988 in a 1‚Äì0 win against Luxembourg for the 1990 World Cup qualifiers, in Porto.

History ABIM was established by Ustaz Abdul Wahab Zakaria on 6 August 1971 during an international trend of Islamic revivalism. Founded by Muslim students, PKPIM (National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students) in particular, the organisation promoted Islam through its charity work and education programs aimed at the poor. Yayasan Anda, a private school known as the \\"Institute\\", served as a centre for its promotion of Islamic education. The popularity of the organisation was aided by widespread scepticism among the youth towards secularisation and Westernisation. ABIM supported and assisted Islamic students practising Dawah, the preaching of Islam, and was a crucial organisation in the early stages of the Malaysian dawah movement. According to Bubalo and Fealy, ABIM was inspired and influenced by the Muslim Brotherhood, which the authors describe as both a socio-political movement and intellectual tendency or current within Islamism. The group reached its height during the late 1970s with a call to return to the basics and the true teachings of Islam through advocacy channel. In the 1980s decade, ABIM renewed its approach through the concept of \\"partnership in nation building\\" with the government. The idea that also was known as \\"the reform from within\\" had undergone the highly successful period particularly when the idea of establishing Islamic University and Islamic Banking that derived originally form ABIM's Annual General Assembly had been realised through the establishment of International Islamic University of Malaysia-IIUM (1982) and Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (1983). For an organisation that was nominally not political, ABIM consistently criticised the government particularly in the scope of good governance which is non-compliance with Islamic principle. By 1986, the group had 40,000 members and now reaching 60,000 members and ABIM's mission continuously received encouraging support from Muslims in Malaysia. ABIM now remain as strong youth based and non-partisan movement led by ninth President Mohamad Raimi Ab Rahim. ABIM managed to enhance its religious legitimacy and gain international recognition by maintaining excellent relations with International NGOs from various Islamic countries. Domestically, they became one of the most significant religious pressure groups, promoting the idea of moderation and progressive thinking.

He most notably played for Benfica and Barcelona, but made the majority of his appearances for Bundesliga side Hannover 96 in his homeland. He won eight full international caps for the German national team between the 1999 Confederations Cup and his death in 2009, and was part of the squad which finished as runners-up in Euro 2008. On the evening of 10 November 2009, Enke committed suicide. At the time of his death, he was widely considered to be a leading contender for the German number one spot at the 2010 World Cup. Club career=Early life and youth career Enke was born on 24 August 1977 in Jena, where he grew up in a flat in the district of Lobeda. He was the youngest of three children born to Dirk Enke, a sports psychologist, and Gisela Enke. He began playing football from an early age, initially playing as a striker, before making the switch to goalkeeper, where he displayed obvious talent. He joined Carl Zeiss Jena in 1985 after an impressive performance while playing against them in a youth team match for SV Jenapharm. He rose through the youth ranks at the club, and in 1993, he played for the Germany under-15 national team against England at Wembley Stadium. The game finished 0‚Äì0, with Enke receiving praise for multiple saves made throughout the match. At the age of 17, Enke signed his first professional contract with Carl Zeiss Jena. Early career Enke worked his way up to the first team at Carl Zeiss Jena during the 1995‚Äì96 season. He made his professional debut on 11 November 1995, against future club Hannover 96 in the 2. Bundesliga. He was given the opportunity after the club suffered two consecutive fiascos against Duisburg and Bochum, prompting coach Eberhard Vogel to drop the former first-choice goalkeeper Mario Neumann for the youngster Enke. Enke played three games during November 1995, but Neumann was restored to the team after this period and Enke did not appear for the first team again that season. The goalkeeper actually would never play for the club again as he was signed by Bundesliga club Borussia M√∂nchengladbach in the summer of 1996. Enke spent his first two seasons here with the club's U-23 side, playing in the lower leagues, as well as for the Under-21 national team and honing his talent, studying the club's number one goalkeeper Uwe Kamps. His chance came on the eve of the 1998‚Äì99 season when Uwe Kamps suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon and new coach Friedel Rausch gave Enke his big chance to finally make his club debut. His first Bundesliga game came on 15 August 1998 in a 3‚Äì0 win over Schalke 04 that put them top of the table. However, this position quickly changed as, despite Enke's best efforts, fifteen goals were scored past him in just one week. The club plummeted to the foot of the league where they remained from October until their eventual relegation (Rainer Bonhof was manager from November onward). Life abroad In June 1999, he joined Benfica in Portugal, signing a three-year contract, and becoming one of four goalkeepers on the team's books. Enke had a history of panic attacks and had second thoughts soon after signing for the team. He realised however that, having signed a contract, he was obliged to fulfil it. The club were then managed by Enke's countryman Jupp Heynckes, who promptly made him captain. His time in Portugal was a turbulent one, as the club changed manager three times in his three seasons there and suffered their lowest ever league finish (sixth) in a trophyless spell, beset by financial difficulties that caused players wages to often be late. Despite these problems, Enke's performances gained him the admiration of Encarnados (reds) fans, as well as interest from clubs like Arsenal, Atl√©tico Madrid and Manchester United chasing him. After contract talks with Benfica stalled, Enke took up the offer of Spanish giants Barcelona and moved on a free transfer in June 2002 on a three-year deal. Life at the Camp Nou proved tough for Enke ‚Äî he later labelled the goalkeeper's spot at Bar√ßa as the \\"most difficult goalkeeping position in Europe\\" ‚Äì as he ended up playing second choice to Roberto Bonano and then V√≠ctor Vald√©s. His debut set the mark, as the club was humiliatingly knocked out of the Spanish Cup by third flight Novelda CF at the first hurdle on 11 September 2002 and was criticised by teammate Frank de Boer in public for his part in their exit. His brief taste of La Liga came in a 20-minute appearance as a substitute in a 2‚Äì2 draw at Osasuna on 2 March 2003. He did manage to sample some European action during his spell though as he made two UEFA Champions League appearances, against Club Brugge and Galatasaray in the group stage. The following season, as Frank Rijkaard replaced Louis van Gaal as coach, Enke was loaned out to Turkish side Fenerbah√ße ‚Äì then managed by German coach Christoph Daum ‚Äì as part of the deal that saw R√º≈üt√º Re√ßber move to the Spanish club. However, his career continued to stall as he managed to play just a solitary game there, a traumatic 0‚Äì3 defeat to Istanbulspor on 10 August 2003. His own fans pelted him with firelighters and bottles during the game, blaming him for this bitter defeat. These scenes caused Enke to immediately quit the club and his planned one-year loan and return to Spain. It was at this time that Enke suffered his first spell of depression, and led to his almost quitting football altogether. After a four-month spell back at Barcelona, but outside the first team squad, Enke dropped down to the Spanish Segunda Divisi√≥n when he was loaned to CD Tenerife in January 2004 for the remainder of the season. Here, he enjoyed an upturn, performing strongly and winning acclaim from the fans and other clubs. Although he believed his career was destined to remain in the lower leagues, he left Tenerife to join Hannover 96 in the Bundesliga. Bundesliga return captaining Hannover in 2009 Following his return to form at CD Tenerife, Enke returned to his homeland joining Bundesliga side Hannover 96 in July 2004 on a free transfer in an initial two-year deal. His career enjoyed its greatest success and stability, as he became firmly established as the club's first choice and was voted the best goalkeeper in the league by his fellow professionals in kicker magazine. Such form caused Enke to be linked with moves to larger clubs, particularly VfB Stuttgart. In December 2006, however, he ended this speculation by signing a contract extension with Hannover 96 until the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. He was elected team captain by his teammates for the 2007‚Äì08 season, a role he would retain for the rest of his career. He again won the best goalkeeper award for the 2008‚Äì09 season, which would tragically prove to be his final full campaign. Enke played 180 times for Hannover 96 in total. He made the final appearance of his career on 8 November 2009 in a 2‚Äì2 draw at home to Hamburg, just two days before his death. International career Enke's No.1 shirt alongside those of other German sportspeople, on display at the Niedersachsenstadion, 2013 Enke first represented his country in 1997 whilst playing for Borussia M√∂nchengladbach, winning a place in the German Under-21 side and retained the number one jersey for the remainder of the season, playing 15 times in total. His performances there convinced former national team coach Erich Ribbeck to include him in the squad for the 1999 Confederations Cup, although he did not feature in any games. His international career then stalled when he left Germany and he was not considered again until his return to the Bundesliga. The growing acclaim he enjoyed after saw him in contention for the 2006 FIFA World Cup squad, under J√ºrgen Klinsmann, although he missed out ultimately. He succeeded in breaking into the squad shortly after, under new coach Joachim L√∂w, in being chosen for a friendly against Georgia, and, after first choice Jens Lehmann caught the flu, again against Cyprus. He finally made his senior international debut for Germany in a 0‚Äì1 friendly defeat to Denmark in Duisburg on 28 March 2007. After further games, he was selected for their Euro 2008 squad which would compete in Austria and Switzerland. Enke was an unused substitute during the tournament that saw Germany finish as runners-up. With the international retirement of previous number one Jens Lehmann at Euro 2008, Enke was poised to make the position his own and played in several World Cup 2010 qualifiers. However, in October 2008, he broke the scaphoid of his left hand while training with the national team for a qualifier against Russia. After undergoing surgery, he was sidelined for two months, and was replaced by Ren√© Adler. Upon his return in January 2009, he again became the number one keeper in the national team. In September and October 2009, Enke was again out of action for several weeks. The reason given to the Hannover 96 coaching was an intestinal infection campylobacter, although it is revealed in Ronald Reng's book A Life Too Short: The Tragic Story of Robert Enke that this was only partly true and in fact Enke's depression had returned. He did not return to football until late October, as a result of which he was not called up for a friendly against Chile for which the national team was preparing when he died. This game was subsequently called off as a mark of respect to Enke. Prior to his death, Enke was expected to be Germany's number one goalkeeper at the 2010 World Cup, ahead of Manuel Neuer. He died having won eight full international caps. His final international appearance came on 12 August 2009 when he kept a clean sheet against Azerbaijan. Personal life Robert Enke was married to former modern pentathlete Teresa Reim and had a daughter, Lara, who was born with a heart birth defect (hypoplastic left heart syndrome). She was rendered deaf by the drugs used to treat her heart problems. Her cochlear implant surgery was successful but she died in 2006 due to complications of her heart defects. In May 2009, they adopted a baby girl, Leila. Enke lived with his family on a small farm in Empede, near Neustadt am R√ºbenberge, until his death in November 2009. Enke and his wife were involved in several animal rights campaigns, and they owned many pets. Death Tributes at AWD-Arena in Hanover On the night of 10 November 2009, at the age of 32, Enke committed suicide, standing in front of a regional express train at a level crossing in Eilvese, Neustadt am R√ºbenberge. Police confirmed a suicide note was discovered but would not publicise its details. His widow, Teresa, revealed that her husband had been suffering from depression for six years and was treated by a psychiatrist. After the death of his daughter Lara in 2006, he struggled to cope with the loss. Many fans immediately flocked to Hannover 96's AWD-Arena home to lay flowers and light candles and sign the book of condolences upon news breaking. His former club Barcelona held a minute's silence before their game that night, and several international matches the following weekend paid the same tribute. As a mark of respect, the German national team cancelled their friendly match against Chile which had been scheduled for 14 November. A minute's silence was also held at all Bundesliga games during 21‚Äì22 November 2009 and at Benfica's game in the Cup of Portugal. Germany also cancelled a planned training session and all interviews after his death. Oliver Bierhoff, the national team's general manager, said: \\"We are all shocked. We are lost for words.\\" On 15 November 2009, nearly 40,000 attendees filled the AWD-Arena for his memorial service. Enke's coffin, covered in white roses, was carried by six of his Hannover 96 teammates. He was then buried in Neustadt, outside Hannover, next to his daughter's grave. As a further mark of respect for their former team mate, the players of Hannover 96 displayed the number one in a circle on the breast of their jerseys, as approved by the DFL as a subtle tribute, for the rest of the 2009‚Äì10 Bundesliga season. In 2019, a ten-year memorial event was held at a theatre hall in Hannover. Biography Ronald Reng's biography A Life too Short: The Tragedy of Robert Enke (2011) won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year in 2011. Robert Enke Foundation The German Football Association, Hannover 96 and the Deutsche Fu√üball Liga participated in a foundation in memory of Enke. The Robert Enke Foundation deals primarily with mental health of players.

She was launched on 14 June, and was commissioned on 22 January 1944 under the command of Lieutenant F. H. Beardaley, Jr. After initial shakedown in Miami, Florida, PC-1140 escorted convoy runs in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean until early June 1944, when she was sent for an overhaul in Norfolk, Virginia. In July she sailed for the Mediterranean, arriving in Bizerte, Tunisia on the 28th. She was assigned to patrol duties along the coast of Italy until 14 August when she was assigned to escort a convoy en route to the invasion of Southern France. She patrolled the assault area and ran convoy escort duty during the assault, returning to Naples, Italy on 17 August. For the remainder of World War II, she operated on patrol and escort duty between the Italian and French coasts. After VE Day, PC-1140 returned to the United States, arriving in Key West, Florida on 14 June 1945.

Instead she served in training exercises off the coast of Florida until 6 November 1946 when she returned to Norfolk. PC-1140 was decommissioned in January 1947 and joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. While berthed at Green Cove Springs, Florida, she was given the name Glenwood, after the cities in Mills County, Iowa and Pope County, Minnesota on 15 February 1956. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1960 and she was disposed of by Navy sale in March 1961. PC-1140 received one battle star for World War II service.

The area was colonized in 1833 when a group of The New Brunswick Land Company became interested in the area. Early impressions of the land were not positive, with surveyors noting the rocky soil as one problem. The general remoteness of the location was also a problem. Initial immigrants to Stanley arrived in three waves. The first was young children and teens from London. The second was farmers and tradesmen from the Eastern Borders of Scotland and England. The third arrived from the Isle of Skye. In 1846, were established as the Parish of Stanley. By 1951, there were 130 residences, and 149 stores and barns. The village is home to the annual Stanley Fair, the longest continuously running agricultural fair in Canada. The first edition of the fair was held in October 1851, although it is now held in the summer. The first sawmill was constructed at the bottom of Stanley hill in 1856, by the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Land Company. There were schools in Tay Creek, North Tay, Fredericksburg, Currieburg, Limekiln, Red Rock, English Settlement, Tay Falls, Tay Valley, Giants Glen, Ward Settlement, Cross Creek, Green Hill, Maple Grove, Williamsburg, and Napadogan.

Owned by iHeartMedia, it is the second-oldest radio station in Toledo, and during AM radio's heyday it was a close second in popularity to WSPD-AM for many years. History The station signed on in 1938 as WTOL-AM, founded by former Toledo prosecutor Frazier Reams (whose family would continue to own the station all the way until 1996). Originally licensed for daytime operations only, WTOL was granted authority for around-the-clock operations in 1939 and affiliated with NBC's Blue Network (later to become ABC Radio) shortly thereafter. Programming on WTOL, until the mid-1960s, was a full-service format of news, information, sports, ABC network programs and various types of music, including pop, country, jazz, and, by the early 1960s, some rock and roll. The station started broadcasting 24 hours a day in 1962 with the new format \\"Demand Radio 123\\". The format was very tightly controlled, and the announcers said very little, other than time and weather. there were scripted intros for songs. The playlist contained about 200 popular favorites of the 40s and 50s. The tight format wore out in less than two years. In 1964 WTOL became a personality driven full service facility, and played popular music, while avoiding \\"hard rock\\". You could hear the Beatles, and the Stones, but only songs like Yesterday, Michelle, and As Tears Go By. For many years, WTOL was a family of three broadcast stations which included TV-11 and FM-104.7. Channel 11 remains WTOL to this day and is the most popular television station in Toledo. The call letters were changed in 1965, when the two radio stations split from Channel 11. The call sign \\"WCWA,\\" or \\"seaway,\\" was meant to pay tribute to the St. Lawrence Seaway, of which Toledo is a major port (and the seaway itself a major boon to the city's economy. The call sign was originally assigned to a German merchant ship (the MS Karl Trautwein) which gave up the call sign for a modest payment. The easy listening format continued. In 1969, Station Manager Garry Miller persuaded Former WCWA DJ Jim Felton to leave CKLW in Detroit and return to program the station. The new format included PAMS jingles, and a slightly more Top 40 approach, while still avoiding the \\"harder rock'. The playlist contained the biggest variety of music available, and gained a much larger audience, even topping the ratings of local station WSPD, which remains as a news/talk station, and Detroit stations like WJR and CKLW. Meanwhile Felton, and his boyhood friend, Dennis Moon, who was now working in the engineering department, attempted to move WCWA-FM to \\"Album Rock\\", a format which was taking hold all over the country. The idea was met with great disdain by Frazier Reams, Jr. who asked if the two were out of their (bleeping) minds? (The FM finally switched to \\"Album Rock\\" some years later, and became an enormus success as WIOT.) Felton left in 1971. Moon remained, and is, to this day, the finest engineer any radio station ever had. WCWA went through many Format changes in the early 1970s, causing it to be known as \\"which way radio\\". One person who loved to call it by that name wound up running the station in the mid-70s. That person was the legendary Bob Martz. Bob worked at almost every station in Toledo at one time or another, and always left his mark. The station was always fun to listen to, mostly because of his fantastic sense of humor. Martz switched the format to oldies, and brought in friends like Terry Shaw, Bob Kelly, Lou Hebert and Mike Shaw. Kelly and Hebert were a very popular morning duo for several years. Kelly later paired with Dennis Staples, and the two worked successfully at WCWA and various other stations in Toledo for 17 years until Staples' death. In the early 1980s, WCWA Manager, Dan Dudley, took the station in another direction with help from consultant Jim Felton, who was working at CFTR in Toronto at the time. They mixed the oldies with country music cross-over songs. The Urban Cowboy craze was in its heyday, and the fit worked very well. They also brought veteran newsman Don Edwards in to run the news department. Mornings were handled by John Mack Brown, a controversial host, who was counterbalanced by the impressive image of Don Edwards. Deejays were Larry Fletcher, Jay Richards, Larry Weseman and radio legend Don King who hosted Sports Talk every evening. The format did extremely well for about two years, but the \\"cowboy\\" fad faded, and WCWA with program director Mike Sheppard, took on another format change, \\"Nostalgia\\". The \\"Music of Your Life\\" format was making ratings headway across the country as baby boomers began to feel their age. WCWA kept this format in both live and satellite delivered versions until 2002. The last live version of WCWA in the nostalgia format originated from the Fort Industry Square studios, (designed and maintained by the infamous Denny Moon) from 1997 until 2002. The staff included the legendary Bob Martz, program director Jim Felton, Suzanne Carroll, Bill Charles, Michael Drew (Mike) Shaw, and Dennis Williams. The ratings increased with the live programming, but sales and management claimed they couldn't sell advertising time easily on a station which catered to \\"old people\\". Translation: anyone over 50. After two decades playing nostalgia/standards, WCWA changed format to talk radio in November 2002. The station's ratings subsequently crashed, and the current sports-talk format was adopted in May 2004; although this change also did nothing to help the station's ratings. Along with abysmal ratings, the format change away from music brought much heated protest within the community, specifically from an organization known as CORRAL. WCWA today WCWA is owned by iHeartMedia, and is part of that company's Toledo cluster. WCWA (and its predecessor WTOL) was owned by Frazier Reams for many years prior to radio deregulation in 1996. Other stations in the Toledo cluster are: WSPD 1370 AM, WVKS 92.5 FM (KISS FM), WRVF 101.5 FM (The River), WCKY-FM 103.7 FM, and WIOT 104.7 FM. WCWA transmits at a power of 1,000 watts, from studios located atop the Fort Industry Square building on Summit Street in downtown Toledo. The station's advertising offices are located at Superior and Lafayette. The transmitter is located near the intersection of Hawley & Whittier Streets and can be easily seen from the Anthony Wayne Trail. WCWA also streams its signal and available on the IHeartRadio app WCWA is the Toledo affiliate of Fox Sports Radio. Play by play WCWA is the flagship station for Toledo Mud Hens baseball, with all regular season games, playoffs and the Triple-A All-Star Game broadcast. Jim Weber is the play-by-play voice of the Mud Hens, having called the team's games since the mid-1970s. WCWA is also the flagship of the Toledo Walleye, which played its inaugural season in 2009-2010. Matt Melzak is the play-by-play announcer for the Walleye. WCWA also carries University of Toledo women's basketball, with Jim Heller calling the plays courtside. Fox Sports 1230 is an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Steelers radio network (due to quarterback Ben Roethlisberger being a native NW Ohioian from nearby Findlay). The station also broadcasts Whitmer High School Football and Basketball. Chris Schmidbauer is the play by play voice. Signal strength Since 1969, the station engineer at WCWA and WIOT (named Chief Engineer in 1974) has been the legendary Dennis Moon. WCWA was known for having a clearer, fuller sound than most AM stations that offered music programming. This has been attributed by many who have worked there to Moon's decades-long devotion to WCWA's audio quality. The \\"Moon-unit\\" updated WCWA to digital HD Radio (IBOC) in the summer of 2007. With just 7 watts of digital power, the station could be received in hybrid digital all the way to the Michigan border. Specialty shows WCWA has also featured a large schedule of ethnic and religious programming for most of its history. This includes shows devoted entirely to Polish, German, Mexican, and Irish music, as well as immensely popular Polka, Jazz, and Gospel programs. In addition to these specialty music programs, WCWA is also the home of several spoken-word religious shows covering many different faiths. Some of these religious shows have been on WCWA since its inception. All or most of these programs survived the format switch, and can mainly be heard on weekends.

He held command in the Swedish army under Gustavus Adolphus during Thirty Years' War. He also fought for the Scottish Covenanters during the Bishop's Wars in Scotland and commanded the Scottish Covenanter army during the Irish Confederate Wars. He was the author of a diary recounting his military experiences during the Thirty Years' War, published as Monro, His Expedition With the Worthy Scots Regiment Called Mac-Keys.MacKay. (1885). An Old Scots Brigade. Edinburgh. Quoting: Monro, Robert. (1637). Monro, His Expedition with the Worthy Scots Regiment. London. Early life Robert Monro was the second son of George Munro, 1st of Obsdale and grandson of Robert Mor Munro, 15th Baron of Foulis, chief of Clan Munro. As a cadet of the Munro of Obsdale family, Robert is sometimes referred to as Robert Monro of Obsdale. He was seated at Contullich Castle.Munro, R.W. (1987). Thirty Years War=Early Skirmishes During the Thirty Years' War Robert Monro gained a Lieutenancy in the regiment that was raised by Donald Mackay, 1st Lord Reay for services in the Bohemian army, along with his chief of the similar name, Robert Munro, 18th Baron of Foulis.Mackenzie. pp. 210. On the 10 October 1626 the regiment embarked from Cromarty and after a sail of five days arrived at Gl√ºckstadt on the River Elbe. On the 10 July 1627, a division of the regiment was sent to join their comrades who were stationed at a fortification in Boitzenberg, near Hamburg, where Monro had his first brush with the enemy.Mackenzie. pp. 211. The Scots after a desperate struggle gained a victory over an overwhelming force of their assailants although they themselves also had to retire, carrying with them their guns and ammunition. Monro next comes into notice at a severe engagement at the Pass in Oldenburg where he was wounded, receiving a wound to his own account, a \\"favourable mark\\" to the inside of the knee, while his partisan was broken in his hand by a cannonball. Robert's elder brother John Munro, 2nd of Obsdale, distinguished himself highly on this occasion and escaped unhurt. The Danes were defeated and had to retire however as they did so the Imperialists returned, this time mounted on cavalry.Mackenzie. pp. 212. Robert Monro realising the gravity of the situation resolved a plan to bring his men to safety. Monro ordered his pike-men to advance steadily and charge the horsemen, whom they quickly forced over the shelving edges of the pier.Mackenzie. pp. 213. Monro and his men then escaped via ship to escape the Imperialists who had been reinforced by more cavalry. Siege of Stralsund In 1628 Robert Monro, then a Major, along with his cousin, Robert Munro, 18th Baron of Foulis, both led their men at the Siege of Stralsund where they defended the town for six weeks against the Imperialists.Mackenzie. pp. 215 - 216. One such assault on the city was made on 26 June when Imperialist General, Albrecht von Wallenstein arrived on the scene.Mackenzie. pp. 217 - 219. The defenders having heard of his arrival expected a severe attack on their position. The assault was made that night between ten and eleven o'clock, directed chiefly against the post guarded by the Highlanders under Major Monro. The enemy advanced with above one thousand men and Highlanders were immediately called to arms, and after a severe battle which lasted for an hour and a half the Imperialists were driven back. However the Imperialists returned and continued to attack until the next morning when they finally forced open the gate and managed to get inside the \\"outworks\\" but were finally beaten back by the Highlanders with great loss, with swords, pikes and butts of muskets. The Imperialists retired having lost over a thousand men, while the Highlanders lost nearly two hundred. Relief for the defenders came when Alexander Leslie arrived with contingents of Scots, Swedes and Germans from the Swedish army.Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Generals of the Thirty Years' War, 1618-1648 (London, 2014), pp.47-51. Leslie reorganised the defences and was made governor of the city. He used the Highland contingent in a spectacular assault on the enemy which finally broke the siege. As Monro recorded: Sir Alexander Leslie being made governour, he resolved for the credit of his countrymen to make an out- fall upon the Enemy, and desirous to conferre the credit on his own Nation alone, being his first Essay in that Citie.Monro, His Expedition, I, pp.77-78 cited in Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Generals of the Thirty Years' War, 1618-1648 (London, 2014), p.49 After the siege Major Robert Monro was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. Siege of Schivelbein In 1630, the MacKay and Munro Highlanders had marched to Schivelbein (Schiefelbein, now ≈öwidwin) a small fortified place in Pomerania, known as Schivelbein Castle, in order to obstruct the passage of the Austrians, who were advancing for the relief of Ko≈Çobrzeg.Mackenzie. pp. 223 - 224. They were commanded to hold the town as long as possible and to defend the castle or fort to the last man. How well they fulfilled this task an eloquent Latin Ode tells us, printed in front of Monro‚Äôs Memoirs and bearing the title: \\"Schiefelbeinum urbs et arx Marchiae Brandenburgicae a generoso Domino Roberto Munro bene defensae.\\" The five hundred Highlanders under Monro are said to have withstood a siege from an enemy of 8000 Imperialists Siege of Neubrandenburg In January 1631, the King accompanied by Colonel Monro, proceeded to besiege Neubrandenburg (New Brandenburg).Mackenzie. pp. 224. The Highlanders soon stormed the palace and forced the defenders to retire from the town. The defending Austrians then sent a messenger to ask for a truce, which was granted. The garrison which according to Monro was a \\"brave little band of five hundred horse, and twelve hundred foot, being as complete to look at as you wish\\", allowed to \\"march out with bag and baggage, horse and foot, with full arms and a convoy to Havelburgh. The Swedish King left a small garrison in the town and the army proceeded on its way. Frankfurt and Leipzig Robert Monro later fought at the Battle of Frankfurt on the Oder,Mackenzie. pp. 225 - 226. and the Battle of Breitenfeld in Leipzig in 1631,Mackenzie. pp. 227 - 228. where the Scots and Swedes took victory on both occasions. However the Swedish army was later defeated at the Battle of N√∂rdlingen (1634), Robert Monro survived and returned to Scotland.Mackenzie. pp. 232. He returned to Swedish service in May 1637 with fresh recruits.Murdoch and Grosjean, p.87 Bishops Wars Robert returned to Scotland about 1638, and took part in some of the early incidents of the Bishops Wars against Charles I and also in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in service of the Scottish Covenanters.

Monro also led the forces that left Inchdrewer Castle, the family seat of George Ogilvy, 1st Lord Banff, in ruins. Irish Confederate Wars=Rebellion in Ulster In 1642 he went to Ireland, nominally as second in command under Alexander Leslie, but in fact in chief command of the Scottish army sent to put down the Catholic Irish rebels who had massacred Scottish settlers in Ulster during the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Monro's campaign in Ireland was largely confined to the northern province of Ulster. After taking and plundering Newry in April 1642, and ineffectually attempting to subdue Sir Phelim O'Neill, Monro succeeded in taking prisoner the Earl of Antrim who was Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim at Dunluce Castle.Mackenzie. pp. 243 - 248. The arrival of Owen Roe O'Neill in Ireland strengthened the cause of the rebels, now organised in Confederate Ireland, and Monro, who was poorly supplied with provisions and war materials, showed little activity. Moreover, the English Civil War was now creating confusion among parties in Ireland, and the king was anxious to come to terms with the Catholic rebels, and to enlist them on his own behalf against the parliament. The Earl of Ormonde, Charles's lieutenant-general in Ireland, acting on the king's orders, signed a cessation of hostilities with the Catholic Confederates on 15 September 1643, and exerted himself to despatch aid to Charles in England. Conflict in Ulster Monro's strategy was just as ruthless and no measure was spared in his campaign against O'Neil. The conflict led to thousands of innocent people being killed on both sides. O'Neil waged a guerilla type offensive in Ulster, whereas Monro, superior in numbers systematically destroyed castles and villages throughout the land. Some accounts tell of him laying waste to Antrim and Down in what we would now call a \\"scorched earth policy\\". Monro attacked and took Newry in 1642 and took Belfast in 1644. After taking Newry Robert Monro then raised the Siege of Coleraine, a town which later became the centre of military activities and the headquarters of Major Daniel Munro during the coming years. Belfast is seized Monro in Ulster, holding his commission from the Parliament of Scotland dominated by the Covenanters, did not recognize the armistice, and his troops accepted the Solemn League and Covenant, in which they were joined by many English soldiers who left Ormonde to join him. In April 1644 the English parliament entrusted Monro with the command of all the forces in Ulster, both English and Scots. He thereupon seized Belfast, made a raid into the Pale, and unsuccessfully attempted to gain possession of Dundalk and Drogheda. In response, the Irish confederates sent an armed expedition to Scotland to join the Scottish Royalists there under James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. Battle of Benburb Monro's force was weakened by the necessity for sending troops to Scotland to withstand Montrose. Meanwhile, Owen Roe O'Neill was strengthened by receiving supplies from the Papal Nuncio to Ireland, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini. On 5 June 1646 was fought the Battle of Benburb, on the Blackwater, where O'Neill routed Monro, inflicting over 2000 dead on the Scottish force but allowing him to withdraw in safety to Carrickfergus. Conflict at Carrickfergus In 1647 Ormonde was compelled to come to terms with the English parliament, who sent commissioners to Dublin in June of that year. Monro supported the royalist \\"Engager\\" movement and sent men under the command of his nephew George Munro, 1st of Newmore back to Scotland to support the Engagers against the English Parliamentarians. Meanwhile, the Scots under Monro held out stubbornly at Carrickfergus and refused to surrender Carrickfergus Castle and Belfast. They were besieged by the forces of George Monck. In September 1648 Carrickfergus was delivered over to Monck by treachery: a number of Monro's officers were divided and some aided the parliamentary commander Monck, and as a result Monro was taken prisoner. He was committed to the Tower of London, where he remained a prisoner for five years. In 1654 he was permitted by Oliver Cromwell to reside in Ireland, where he had estates in right of his wife, who was the widow of Viscount Montgomery of Ardes. Monro continued to live quietly near Comber, County Down, for many years, and probably died there about 1680. Family Robert Monro is known to have at least two children: #Andrew Monroe, a Colonel who was killed at the Siege of Limerick (1690).Mackenzie. pp. 263. #Ann Monro, who married her cousin, George Munro, 1st of Newmore.Mackenzie. pp. 264.

The murder became the topic in many heated debates and articles in Swedish media, political papers and in Swedish society at that time, and the motives and cause of the murder is still debated even today.

The official police investigation leaves it somehow unclear what really caused the fight and murder since there was many accused and many witnesses who gave different versions of the events. Stieg Larsson, then the editor of Expo, an pro-Islam magazine, denied that the Expo organisation had ever defended the murder of Wretstr√∂m, pointing out that the Turkish-born journalist Kurdo Baksi had been one of the first to condemn the perpetrators.

Stanmer Church, 2006 The eighteenth century park contains the Grade I listed Stanmer House and also 25 Grade II listed buildings and structures. These form the village of Stanmer and Stanmer Church within the park, which would once have been the estate of the house. All were private until bought by Brighton's Council in 1947. There is a caf√©, Stanmer Tea Rooms, in the village. A major restoration project is underway funded through the National Lottery, the City Council, Plumpton College and the South Downs National Park Authority. Once completed, this should give improved infrastructure, facilities and accessibility to the park, explain the heritage better and provide a new walled public garden One Garden Brighton. New employment and volunteer opportunities and events are also planned to start in 2021. Stanmer House was built for the Pelham family in 1722 around an earlier building. A mistress of King George IV later lived there. It was used as the first administrative centre of the 1961 University of Sussex, during the construction of its campus over a part of the park. A walk of elm trees was preserved within the campus design, by architect Sir Basil Spence. The house reopened in June 2006 after extensive restoration but there have been difficulties in bring it into successful use. The church, adjacent to the village pond, was built in 1838 on the site of a 14th-century building. The church is now maintained by the Stanmer Preservation Society, which also runs the Donkey Wheel. The woods beyond the park to the north and west lead into Wild Park and the open South Downs countryside, part of the South Downs National Park. Immediately to the south of the park runs the major A27 road.

His discoveries of ohmic contacts and research in the fields of organic insulators and semiconductors led to techniques enabling organic semiconductors to carry relatively large currents, and to convert electricity into light and vice versa. These discoveries have had application in electrophotography, organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), photovoltaic cells, biological sensors, transistors, molecular electronics and batteries. For his work, Dr. Pope was awarded the Davy Medal from the Royal Society in 2006. Biography Martin Pope was born in 1918 to Jewish immigrants from the Ukraine. The second of four sons, Pope grew up on New York's Lower East Side. He attended the City College of New York and graduated with a bachelor's in chemistry in 1939. While at CCNY, Pope assisted in nuclear experiments at Columbia University and met Fermi, Schwinger, Dunning and other key figures in the development of nuclear fission. After graduation, he served in the Army Air Force in the Pacific, where he reached the rank of first lieutenant. After the war, Pope returned home and found work at Balco Research Laboratories, where he received two patents for thin film inventions. He received his Ph.D. in 1950 from the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. He joined the faculty of New York University in 1956 as a researcher in the Radiation and Solid State Physics Lab (RSSL). In 1988, he retired as professor of chemistry and director of the RSSL. Since 1988, Pope has been professor emeritus, physical chemistry at NYU. He is still active in research, and most recently published papers in 2003 and 2004. Pope married Lillie Pope, an educational psychologist and author, in 1946. She died in 2015.

A Grand Theft Auto clone (also known as a GTA clone) is a subgenre of open world action-adventure video games, characterized by their likeness to the Grand Theft Auto series in either gameplay, or overall design. In these types of open world games, players may find and use a variety of vehicles and weapons while roaming freely in an open world setting. The objective of Grand Theft Auto clones is to complete a sequence of core missions involving driving and shooting, but often side-missions and minigames are added to improve replay value. The storylines of games in this subgenre typically have strong themes of crime, violence and other controversial elements such as drugs and sexually explicit content. The subgenre has its origins in open world action adventure games popularized in Europe (and particularly the United Kingdom) throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The release of Grand Theft Auto (1997) marked a major commercial success for open-ended game design in North America, and featured a more marketable crime theme. But it was the popularity of its 3D sequel Grand Theft Auto III in 2001 that led to the widespread propagation of a more specific set of gameplay conventions consistent with a subgenre. The subgenre now includes many games from different developers all over the world where the player can control wide ranges of vehicles and weapons. The subgenre has evolved with greater levels of environmental detail and more realistic behaviors. As usage of the term \\"clone\\" often has a negative connotation and can be seen as controversial, reviewers have come up with other names for the subgenre. Names such as \\"sandbox games\\", however, are applied to a wider range of games that do not share key features of the Grand Theft Auto series. Definition A Grand Theft Auto clone is a video game that falls within the genre popularized by the 2001 title Grand Theft Auto III,Sources that refer to Grand Theft Auto popularizing or inventing a genre include: i. ; ii. ; iii. where players are given the ability to drive any vehicle or fire any weapon as they explore an open world. These games are sometimes treated as a 3D action-adventure game,Sources that refer to games similar to Grand Theft Auto as action-adventure games include: i. ii. ; iii. iv. ; v. or third-person shooter. They are noted for frequently bearing strong violent or criminal themes, though exceptions like American McGee Presents: Scrapland have copied its gameplay and structure with a Teen rating.Navarro, Alex (2004-11-11). Scrapland Review], GameSpot, Retrieved on 2009-6-17 Other terminology Calling a game a \\"Grand Theft Auto clone\\" is sometimes considered unfair or insulting. This is because reviewers sometimes use this term to suggest that the \\"clone\\" is a mere imitation, which commonly occurs in the video game industry, designed for the sole purpose of capitalizing on the success of the Grand Theft Auto series. However, this term can also be used as a neutral description of a game, which can range from good to bad. Reviewers have used \\"Grand Theft Auto clone\\" to describe games that rest on their own merits, and do not necessarily dismiss the entire class of games as mere imitators. Games of this type are sometimes defined under the broader terminology \\"open world games\\" or \\"sandbox games\\". However, many games that predate Grand Theft Auto III, such as Metroid from 1986, are also called open world games.i. ii. Conflictingly, games such as Grand Theft Auto III and Body Harvest are credited with inventing this genre more than a decade later.i. ii. Furthermore, reviewers have stated that this genre does not include every game with a freely explorable world and that this genre is much more specific, thus excluding the free-roaming titles Spider-Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction from this class of games. The terminology is inconsistent, sometimes including any game with open level design, while other times focusing on a specific genre created at the turn of the century. Without clear classifications to describe the genre popularized by Grand Theft Auto, reviewers have created a number of alternate names for this genre. Some reviewers have focused on the pervasive criminal themes and content in the genre, using terminology such as \\"crime games\\", \\"crime-based action games\\", and what CNN called the \\"gangsta genre\\". Other journalists have emphasized gameplay by describing the genre as \\"free roaming action adventure games\\", \\"driving-and-shooting games\\", and \\"driving action hybrids\\". Game design=Driving and shooting Grand Theft Auto clones offer players the ability to steal and drive a number of vehicles. Games have included all kinds of vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, helicopters, boats, fixed-wing aircraft, and military vehicles. Reviewers have compared these games based on the number of vehicles they offer, with greater choice resulting in better reviews. Players can also use vehicles as weapons, either by driving into enemies, or by damaging the vehicle until it explodes. Some games allow vehicles to perform stunts. Games in the genre thus incorporate elements of driving simulation games. Some games even allow players to customize their vehicles. Players can engage in combat using a range of weapons depending on the game setting, such as firearms, explosives, close-range melee weapons, or even exaggerated fictional weapons (e.g. laser weapons or a hand-held minigun) . As such, several reviewers have stated that games in this genre are partially third person shooters.For examples of reviewers who have called these kinds of games third person shooters, see: i. ii. Players can find weapons scattered throughout the game world, and may buy weapons in shops or take them from dead enemies. Virtually anyone in the game world can be attacked by the player. In many games, excessive violent behavior will provoke a reaction by police authorities, who the player may then choose to fight or evade. Players must also keep track of their health and ammunition in order to succeed in combat. These games have employed a variety of aiming mechanisms, such as free look aiming or a \\"lock-on\\" button. Several games have been criticized for difficult or burdensome controls when it comes to shooting, and thus video game designers have tried to refine the aiming and shooting controls in these games. Open world and missions Grand Theft Auto clones allow players to freely explore the game world, which is typically on the scale of an entire city. Some games base their level design on real world cities, such as London, New York City, and Los Angeles. Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot. Some games put greater emphasis on leaping, climbing, and even swimming. Exploring the world is not just necessary to complete objectives, but also to gain valuable items, weapons, and vehicles. Different parts of the game world may be controlled by different enemy factions, who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways. However, more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their own territory. The freedom of navigating a huge game world may be overwhelming or confusing for new players. Game designers have come up with a variety of navigational aids to solve this problem. A mini-map feature is common, while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV go so far as to offer a GPS service. Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing. The player's freedom to explore may be limited until they complete certain objectives and advance the game plot. Players must visit specific locations and complete specific missions in order to win the game,i. ii. iii. such as racing, tailing, couriering, robbing, stealing, shooting, assassinating, and driving to specific checkpoints. There may be multiple ways to complete these missions as the game environment is designed to facilitate shortcuts, experimentation, and creative ways to kill enemies. Completing a core mission will unlock further missions and advance the storyline, and if the player fails a mission they will be able to resume the game from before the mission began. In addition, these games usually offer optional side missions, which allow players to gain other rewards. These side missions improve the game's replay value. These games are also known for incorporating numerous minigames into the game world, such as circuit races. Ultimately, this allows the player to follow or ignore the game's storyline as they see fit. History=Origin Open world, 3D action-adventure games existed for years prior to the release of any similar game from the Scottish developer DMA Design.Whitehead, Dan (February 4, 2008). \\"Born Free: the History of the Openworld Game\\" . Eurogamer. Retrieved on 2008-07-25. Mercenary (1985) has been described as a major ancestor to the Grand Theft Auto series, because it featured an open world which the player could explore freely. The Terminator, released in 1991, was a free-form, open world game that set its action in a modern-day city that extended for miles, and included the ability to fire at civilians and steal cars. This game was also among the first American- developed games to feature these elements.Fahs, Travis (2009-05-20). IGN Presents the History of Terminator , IGN, Retrieved on 2009-06-17 Hunter (1991) has been described as the first sandbox game featuring full 3D, third- person graphics, thus making it an important precursor to the Grand Theft Auto series.Fahs, Travis (2008-03-24). The Leif Ericson Awards , IGN, Retrieved on 2009-07-16 The game consisted of a large, open world in which there were numerous possibilities to complete different missions. The character could travel on foot, or steal different vehicles such as cars, tanks, or even bicycles, boats, helicopters and hovercrafts. Moreover, Hunter also had many unique features such as day and night lighting, fuel modelling, a log book, aerial observation units, tank traps, land mines and computer-controlled rocket batteries and tracer guns.Patterson, Mark (August 1991). Amiga Reviews: Hunter, CU Amiga, Retrieved on 2009-07-16 It was also possible to ride a bicycle, swim, windsurf or even make a parachute jump from a helicopter. DMA Design began pursuing open world game design with the first Grand Theft Auto, which allowed players to commandeer various automobiles and shoot various weapons within a mission-based structure. Unlike later games in the series, and indeed many earlier influences, the first two GTA games were 2D. In 1998, DMA moved many of these design concepts into a 3D world, with Body Harvest, a Nintendo 64 game developed by DMA Design (which eventually became Rockstar North when it was acquired by Rockstar Games). This title featured an open world with nonlinear missions and side-quests, as well as the ability to commandeer and drive a variety of vehicles. As such, it has been retroactively called \\"GTA in space\\" (despite the fact that most of the game takes place in various settings on Earth), and is credited with making Grand Theft Auto III possible. Dan Houser has also cited the 3D Mario and Zelda games on the Nintendo 64 as major influences. In 1999, Midtown Madness by Angel Studios (which later became Rockstar San Diego) was released. This driving game was 3D and featured an open world in an urban environment like Grand Theft Auto. It was however not a sandbox game, as the player could only choose one of the pre-defined gameplay modes. Travelling on foot or switching cars during gameplay was not possible. Rockstar Games approached Angel Studios with a long-term partnership in 1999, which resulted in the creation of video game series Midnight Club (another open world 3D race game) and Smuggler's Run. In November 2000, almost a year before Grand Theft Auto III, Driver 2 by Reflections came out. Set in a 3D open world in an urban environment with the ability to traverse on foot and commandeer other vehicles, Driver 2 featured many aspects of what would later become known as a Grand Theft Auto clone, though violence was restricted to cutscenes. Grand Theft Auto III took the gameplay foundation of the first two Grand Theft Auto games and expanded it into a 3D world, and offered an unprecedented variety of minigames and side- missions. The title was a much greater commercial success than its direct precursors, and its influence was profound. As such, Grand Theft Auto III is credited with popularizing this genre, let alone inventing it. Its release is sometimes treated as a revolutionary event in the history of video games, much like the release of Doom nearly a decade earlier. GamePro called it the most important game of all time, and claimed that every genre was influenced to rethink their conventional level design. IGN similarly praised it as one of the top ten most influential games of all time. Subsequent games that follow this formula of driving and shooting in a free-roaming level have been called Grand Theft Auto clones. Other critics, however, likened Grand Theft Auto III to The Legend of Zelda and Metroid, as well as Shenmue in particular,Brendan Main, Lost in Yokosuka , The EscapistShenmue: Creator Yu Suzuki Speaks Out , GamesTMYu Suzuki , IGNThe Disappearance of Yu Suzuki: Part 1, 1UP and noted how GTA III had combined elements from previous games and fused them together into a new immersive experience. For instance, radio stations had been implemented earlier in games such as Sega's Out Run (1986) and Maxis' SimCopter (1996), open-ended missions based on operating a taxi cab in a sandbox environment were the basis for Sega's Crazy Taxi (1999), the ability to kill non-player characters dated back to action role-playing games like Hydlide II (1985),Kurt Kalata & Robert Greene, Hydlide , Hardcore Gaming 101 and Final Fantasy Adventure (1991), and the way in which players run over pedestrians and get chased by police has been compared to Pac-Man (1980). Recent history One of the first games to be compared to Grand Theft Auto's foray into the 3D video game landscape was Mafia. Its development during the same time and release a year later in 2002 had a few review websites draw comparisons, notably comparing the open world city and driving. These comparisons were mostly positive, with Game Informer writing \\"This is a lot like GTA III. Awesome!\\" and \\"There's no shame in taking a proven gameplay formula and changing it a little bit\\" in its review. Rockstar North finished development of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City later that year, which expanded on the open world concept by letting players explore the interior of more than sixty buildings. The game featured an expanded soundtrack and the voice talent of several Hollywood actors, including Ray Liotta. This set a new standard for the genre, making studio talent a pre-requisite for success. Other game developers entered the field that year, with releases such as The Getaway. The Simpsons: Hit & Run in 2003 applied the concept to a cartoon world, while True Crime: Streets of LA reversed the Grand Theft Auto formula by putting the player in the role of a police officer. Some reviewers began warning parents of the growing number of games in this genre, due to the violent themes intended for mature audiences. A mural ad for Grand Theft Auto IV, which currently holds numerous sales records. Ultimately, rival developers were unable to match the reception of the Grand Theft Auto series. Rockstar North released Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas in 2004, which featured an open world on the scale of three distinct cities. The game also allowed players to customize the player-character and vehicles, as well as compete for turf by fighting with rival gangs. The continued success of the Grand Theft Auto series led to successful spin-offs, including Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories in 2005, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories in 2006, and the 2D Grand Theft Auto Advance for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console. A market analysis in early 2006 found that new games in this genre would have more difficulty than new first-person shooters or racing games, and noted that overall revenue for this genre declines during periods without a new Grand Theft Auto game. By 2006, developers were producing fewer games in this space, estimated at half the number seen in 2005. Grand Theft Auto clones for mobile phones were also released by a number of developers, most notably those from Gameloft's Gangstar series, the first being Gangstar: Crime City in 2006. With the arrival of the seventh generation of video game consoles, the first \\"next- gen\\" Grand Theft Auto clones were released in 2006, beginning with Saints Row from 2006 and Crackdown from 2007 both introduced online multiplayer to the genre, a feature that had been requested by many fans. Crackdown attracted attention for being created by David Jones, the developer of the original Grand Theft Auto, and featured the ability to develop the player character's superpowers in a semi-futuristic setting. Meanwhile, The Godfather: The Game and Scarface: The World Is Yours entered the market in 2006, and attempted to apply the Grand Theft Auto formula to popular movie franchises. Still, reviewers continued to measure these games against the standard set by the Grand Theft Auto series. Grand Theft Auto IV was released in April 2008 and featured a large, detailed environment, redefining gameplay and even adopted the GPS navigation system seen in Saints Row. The game broke numerous sales records, including the record for the fastest selling game in its first 24 hours. Since its inception, this genre has evolved to include larger settings, more missions, and a wider range of vehicles. In 2010, Rockstar Games published Red Dead Redemption, an open world Western themed game. Later that year, the second entry in the Mafia series, Mafia II, was released and met with a few comparisons to Grand Theft Auto as well. On the day of Grand Theft Auto V 's release on September 17, 2013, Volition released a free downloadable content pack for Saints Row IV titled \\"GATV\\", purposely playing the similarity in the abbreviated titles to promote their game due to the confusion raised on various social networks. Variations of the Grand Theft Auto formula have also been applied to games aimed at children and younger audiences, most notably with Lego City Undercover, first released in 2013 for the Wii U with a remastered version for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One released in 2017. As is with the True Crime and later Sleeping Dogs games, the game is role-reversed with the player taking on the role of a police officer enforcing the law, rather than of a criminal, although the player is required to commit criminal acts on some occasions in order to infiltrate criminal gangs.

Overview Liuboml is situated southeast of Warsaw and west of Kyiv, in a historic region known as Volhynia; not far from the border with Belarus to the north, and Poland to the west. Because of its strategic location at the crossroads of Central and Eastern Europe, Liuboml had a long history of changing rule, dating back to the 11th century.

Before the ensuing Holocaust, Luboml was a town with the highest percentage of Jews anywhere in the country by 1931, exceeding 94% of the total population of over 3,300 people. In Yiddish, the town was called Libivne. During World War II, Liuboml was occupied twice. It remained under the German occupation from 25 June 1941 until 19 July 1944 in the years following the anti-Soviet Operation Barbarossa. It was administered as a part of the Nazi German Reichskommissariat Ukraine. The entire Jewish community of Liuboml was annihilated in a mass shooting action conducted in 1942 on the outskirts of town in the deadliest phase of the Holocaust. The town's Jews along with refugees from western Poland estimated at around 4,500 people, were taken by the German Einsatzgruppen aided by the local Ukrainian collaborators and Auxiliary Police to nearby pits and shot. There were 51 known survivors from the virtually eradicated town. Liuboml was repopulated during the postwar repatriations.

He played bass and provided occasional backing vocals for the English band The Verve. Personal life Jones attended Rudston Road primary school in Childwall, Liverpool and moved to Wigan when he was 13 years old. He is married to Myra and has two sons - Jude and Jonah Jones. The Verve Away from the musical side of The Verve, Jones is the only other band member other than the band's main mouthpiece, lead singer Richard Ashcroft, who tends to speak publicly and in interviews. Most notably, he, along with Ashcroft, made a speech at the 2007 Q Awards as they won a classic album award for their 1997 album Urban Hymns. He thanked the band member's wives and children and also thanked former Verve guitarist Simon Tong, who was not included in the newly reformed Verve line up. He also did an interview on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show after the band's 2007 reformation, and he also appeared alone and alongside Ashcroft in a handful of Verve documentaries and other miscellaneous interviews throughout the 1990s. When The Verve split in 1999 due to in-band tensions, many believed they were down to tensions between singer Richard Ashcroft and lead guitarist Nick McCabe. While this is true, there were in fact problems, described as 'serious' by Ashcroft in later interviews, between Ashcroft and Jones also. In June 2007, he rejoined The Verve in their reunion but by 2009 they had disbanded again. Other musical projects After the breakup of The Verve in 1999, Jones later played bass and wrote songs for the short lived band The Shining, who former Verve bandmate Simon Tong also played with. They would release just one album in 2002 called True Skies. In 2003, Jones was the recording bassist for Howie Day on Day's second album, Stop All The World Now, on Epic Records. Since 2004, Jones has been an official member of the backing band for Cathy Davey. In November 2005, he performed with the Gorillaz live band playing guitar at the Manchester Opera House, as part of the Manchester International Festival, again alongside fellow Verve member Simon Tong. In 2015 Simon featured on the out of the hive Ep by Scottish band, boletes.

For their investigative work in the field of steroids, Williams and Fainaru-Wada were given the 2004 George Polk Award. In the course of their investigative research, Williams and Fainaru-Wada were the first to report that: *track star Marion Jones purportedly received illegal drugs from the steroid supplier BALCO *world record-holder Tim Montgomery testified before a federal grand jury that he had used steroids *baseball slugger Jason Giambi testified that he had used steroids On May 5, 2006, Fainaru-Wada and Williams were subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury about how they obtained leaked grand jury testimony. On May 31, the authors urged United States District Judge Martin Jenkins of San Francisco to excuse them from testifying. This appeal was supported by affidavits from Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Mark Corallo, a former press secretary to former Attorney General John Ashcroft, but was denied on August 15, 2006.\\"Judge: Reporters must reveal sources in Bonds case\\" On Sept 21, 2006, after refusing to comply with the subpoena, the journalists were sentenced to 18 months in prison for contempt of court. The two have repeatedly stated that they would go to prison before revealing their sources. The two avoided jail time, however, when attorney Troy Ellerman pleaded guilty on Feb. 14, 2007, to leaking the information, lying to prosecutors, obstructing justice and disobeying a court order not to disclose grand jury information. The two reporters were awarded the 2007 Dick Schaap Award for Outstanding Journalism. Fainaru-Wada left the Chronicle in November 2007 to join ESPN. In August 2009, Williams left the Chronicle for California Watch, a new West Coast division of the Center for Investigative Reporting.Joe Strupp, \\"Lance Williams to Write for CIR\\", Editor and Publisher (July 31, 2009) Grand jury subpoena=Forced to testify On August 15, 2006, as part of United States v. Fainaru-Wada, 06-90225, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White ordered Fainaru-Wada and Williams to comply with their subpoenas and testify, saying that, if they do not, they will be held in contempt and incarcerated until such time as they decide to talk or if the grand jury expires and has to be thrown out. They may also be freed from this obligation if a higher court reverses the ruling. The reporters have previously stated that they would rather go to jail than testify. Controversy Following Judge White's decision to uphold the subpoena, public controversy stirred concerning whether or not the two reporters should be forced to reveal their sources. While many contend that confidential sources have been utilized by the press since the beginning of its existence, others believe that by not revealing their confidential sources, Fainaru-Wada and Williams are, in effect, obstructing justice and should be punished accordingly. Those who believe that confidential sources are necessary in reporting often point to the work of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post and their mysterious source, \\"Deep Throat,\\" to whom they refer several times in their articles detailing the Watergate scandal. In an affidavit, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer stated that, \\"To jail a journalist because he protected his source is an assault not only on the press, but on Californians as well.\\"Justice Department on steroids August 20, 2006 Eve Burton, who has been the Hearst Corporation lawyer for the two reporters, said, \\"I think that they [Fainaru-Wada and Williams] have the constitutional right to protect their sources. I think law-enforcement's interest in determining who leaked the information to the press has to be balanced against the significant public- reporting that these guys did. Without the laws that have protected journalists for the past thirty years,\\" she contended, \\"We wouldn't have had Watergate, we wouldn't have had BALCO, and we won't have the next government corruption case that comes along. That's the importance to the public in this. The reporters [must] be able to provide public information, and without the use of confidential sources -- carefully conceived, properly used -- we will not learn about important matters that involve our government.\\" Lance Williams also expressed a similar concern, saying, \\"As far as the government coming after us, the world has changed since this story was published. In [the days of Woodward and Bernstein], the government was not going around the country subpoenaing reporters. This is a very new development. It's really an innovation of the current Attorney General, as far as I can tell. But the number of reporters subpoenaed in the past decade is not very great. And the number subpoenaed recently is a large proportion of the number subpoenaed in the past 20 to 25 years. We didn't know we were risking jail, we thought [the government] would try to find out the sources, but we really did not anticipate that it would get to this point. Because as a matter of practice, that wasn't what they were doing in those days.\\" On Jan. 18, 2007, John Conyers and Tom Davis sent Alberto Gonzales a letter asking him to withdraw the subpoenas.BALCO journalists find ally in Conyers Jan. 18, 2007 Government motivation On August 21, 2006, in an interview with Forrest Wilkinson of RealGM, Lance Williams was quoted as saying, \\"We always thought there was a disconnect between the government's interest in steroid use. There's no question that the people who put the case [against BALCO] together bent over backwards to protect the users of the drugs, first they condoned their use of illegal drugs, then they excised all of their names from the court filings. It goes on to this day -- this attempt to protect these wealthy athletes.\\" Fainaru-Wada also questioned the government's motives, \\"You have these high-profile athletes, multi-million dollar athletes in some cases, who were the users of the drugs and, wanting to clean up sports,\\" he contended, \\"[Congress] probably [should] expose those people, and yet, all those athletes are protected and their names were hidden from public file, or retracted by using generic names such as 'A Major League Baseball player', 'an NFL player', those types of things.\\"Lance Williams: 'Government Bent Over Backwards To Protect Drug Users' 22nd August, 2006 Criticism=Profit from book After having published Game of Shadows, it has become a topic for debate as to whether it should be acceptable to profit from material illegally disclosed to them. Both Fainaru-Wada and Williams claim that they have received little-to- no profit from their book, to this point. \\"We haven't seen anything from royalties yet. All I can say is, we're not getting rich, we're not retiring, we're not buying new houses, we're not buying mansions or anything like that. I'm not going to change my status (Laughs). And I would just say, even if it did, it's not relevant. I didn't do this for the money, Lance didn't do this for the money; we did this because we love reporting, because this is a great story, and because it's an important one, and that's why we did it,\\" Fainaru- Wada said in the RealGM article. He also remarked, \\"Lance has a 'semi-joke' that, he did the math, and he makes, in a year, as a reporter for the Chronicle, what [Barry] Bonds makes in three innings.\\" Williams went even further, saying that they had actually received an advance-payment so that they could afford to take time off work to write Game of Shadows.

Situated on Moor Road, Prudhoe, PCHS is a high school and sixth form college. Students range from year 9 to year 13 (years 12 and 13 being sixth form). The school was opened in 1958, starting with 350 pupils, and has expanded over the years. The school now serves around 1,000 students. In September 2016 the new all in one school building opened its doors. This replaced the old, outdated campus buildings. The Old School Building The school used to consist of several buildings and departments (housed within 'blocks'). The main school building was where the maths, languages, and sciences departments were based, as well as ICT rooms, the Contemporary Arts department, the music department, and part of the PE department. Other buildings included the humanities block, where the student support areas (Pastoral and Learning Support teams), finance office, and administrative staff were based. It was also where the Humanities department, consisting of history, geography, and ethics, was based. The block also housed the Drama department and a Police Office (which was staffed by Northumbria Police). The school included an English block, a Sixth form study area, a DT and Business and ICT block, an Engineering building, and a full sports hall and gymnasium. The Art Building was opened by HM Queen Elizabeth II in May 1998. The old sports hall used to include a squash court, a fitness room, and a large gym with cricket batting nets, two small and one large basketball court. In the main building there was also a gymnastics hall. The school had on average one IT classroom per department (with art, maths, and contemporary arts departments being the only departments not to have an IT room).  New School Building  In March 2015 it was announced that Prudhoe would be getting a full new school rebuild after years of campaigning by both MP Guy Opperman and Head Teachers at the school. The tender for the building work was won by Sir Robert McAlpine who carried out the main construction. Various other contractors worked on the site including Owen Pugh and Armac Demotion. The new building came at a cost of around ¬£12.5m. Building work on it officially begun in the end half of 2015 and opened in September 2016. Located on the existing school site, The work entailed demolition of the existing main school building and part demolition of the existing sports hall, the erection of a two-storey school building, phased relocation, reconfiguration of vehicular and pedestrian access and laying out of associated car parking, cycle parking, boundary treatments and landscaping. The scheme was built under the Priority Schools Building Programme and work was funded by the Education Funding Agency following a successful bid to the agency from Northumberland County Council. When the old school closed there was a large fire in the old hall. It caused a lot of damage and made the area temporarily unsafe due to asbestos in the roof. The finished landscaping and car parking is due to be completed by the end of Summer 2017. Technology Prudhoe Community High School used to be a specialist technology college, although from 2011 students were not obliged to study a technology subject at GCSE level.About us . Currently courses include textiles, electronics, resistant materials, food, graphics (I.C.T. and traditional) and the 14‚Äì19 nationally acknowledged engineering diploma.  IT facilities  The school now has 7 IT classrooms. As an educational establishment within the Northumberland LEA, PCHS has full WiFi access for staff and students in all of its buildings and outside coverage as well. Every classroom in the school has at least one PC, with portable laptops available to students. Learning Resource Centre Prudhoe Community High School supports its pupils through a learning resource centre (known also as the LRC), which includes a library, career advice centre, creative area, and 26 computers for use by students. Clubs The Learning Resource Centre hosts to several after-school clubs. These include the year nine reading group and a homework club. Sports facilities Outside the building are some basketball and tennis courts. The school also has three large playing fields. One has athletics facilities (a sand pit and running track), one has football posts and the third is a 5G astro-turf pitch. The schools sporting facilities were reduced in wake of the construction of the FUSE Media Centre but have now been fully reinstated.

The ground had two main grandstands and was surrounded by a grass covered hill, giving it a capacity of more than 35,000. It was demolished along with the smaller No.2 Ground in 1986 to allow the building of the SFS, which opened in 1988. During its lifespan the Sports Ground hosted Rugby league, Rugby Union, Soccer, Motorcycle speedway and Speedway car racing. The Sports Ground was the home ground of NSWRL team, the Eastern Suburbs Roosters, the club playing 500 games at the ground from 1911 until 1986, with a 283-199-18 W-L-D record.

The Roosters played their last game at the Sports Ground on 29 June 1986, defeating North Sydney 21‚Äì14 in front of only 8,175 fans.Sydney Sports Ground at Rugby League Project The South Sydney Rabbitohs club also used it as a home ground from 1928 to 1947.Club Records at rabbitohs.com.au The Roosters recorded their biggest ever win at the Sydney Sports Ground on 18 May 1935, when they defeated Canterbury-Bankstown 87‚Äì7 in a Round 6 clash of the 1935 season. Easts ran in 19 tries to one with Australian test centre Dave Brown, the \\"Bradman of rugby league\\", scoring 45 points from 5 tries and 15 goals. Easts would win their 5th premiership in 1935 while Brown would go on to be the season's leading try scorer with 38 (still the league record for tries in a season as of 2017) and leading point scorer with 244 points (38 tries, 62 goals). The Sydney Sports Ground also hosted the 1951 NSWRL Grand Final with South Sydney easily accounting for Manly-Warringah playing in their first ever grand final by a score of 42‚Äì14 in front of 28,505 fans, the smallest grand final crowd since 1944. The Sports Ground was used as the Sydney Cricket Ground was in use on that day. Soccer and rugby league were among the sports held at the ground, but soccer teams also used the ground for major matches. It was also an important open-air boxing venue between the 1930s and 1960s. The champion Australian boxers Jack Carroll, Ron Richards and Jimmy Carruthers has memorable victories there. The Sydney Sports Ground was one of the venues used in the 1938 British Empire Games. The ground also hosted six matches the 1981 FIFA World Youth Championship with a highest attendance of 28,932 for the double header with Argentina defeating Cameroon 1-0 and host nation Australia holding England to a 1-1 draw. The average attendance at the Sports Ground for the tournament was 17,270. For many years the ground also hosted minor Rugby union representative matches and the annual Sydney rugby premiership grand final. Among some of the most memorable of these games were wins by the Sydney team over more fancied visitors such as Wales and Ireland, and a 13-all draw with the New Zealand All Blacks. Sydney's 18‚Äì16 win over Wales in 1978 featured one of the most famous field goals ever kicked in Australia when winger Laurie Monaghan's long range effort sailed over the crossbar in the dying minutes to seal a legendary victory. To raise money for Boys' Town - a Catholic home for troubled youths at Engadine, south of Sydney - the bookmaker George Nathan each Sunday organized a fund-raising carnival, with trotting, cycling and midget-car racing that packed the Sydney Sports Ground. Speedway From 1907 the Sydney Sports Ground was used as a Motorcycle racing track. The track that was later to become the dirt speedway was then concrete. The concrete was removed in the 1920s and replaced by a ¬º Mile, dirt track, and starting on 30 October 1937 the Sports Ground was a Dirt track racing Speedway venue hosting Solos, Sidecars and Speedcars. The Sydney Sports Ground Speedway was officially opened in 1937 by Mr E. A. Buttershaw, NSW Minister for Lands. The ground held the first ever Australian Speedcar Grand Prix on 12 March 1938 and was won by Sydney driver Les Dillon who was killed at the track only two months later becoming the speedway's first fatality. Between 1938 and 1953, eight Solo riders and four Speedcar drivers died as a result of accidents on the dirt track. The Sports Ground held its last speedway meeting on 25 March 1955.http://www.vintagespeedway.com/Sportsground.html England's Speedway Star of the 1930s through to the early 1950s Jack Parker, stated that the Sports Ground track was \\"The best Speedway track in the World\\" after one of his visits to Australia to captain England in numerous test matches at the ground against the Australians who often had among their ranks Speedway World Champions Lionel Van Praag, Bluey Wilkinson, and later Jack Young. During its 18 years of operation, the Sports Ground Speedway also played host on occasion to the Australian Solo Championship, Australian Sidecar Championship, Australian Speedcar Championship, NSW Solo Championship, NSW Sidecar Championship and the NSW Speedcar Championship.

History Artemis 30 A proposal in 1975 by a big Greek chemical company, Chropei of Piraeus, for the adoption of its own-developed rifles and submachine guns, was rejected after testing proved that its weapons were not up to desired standards. Similarly, the Greek state did not support Pyrkal, which was already producing the FN FAL rifle under license. Subsequently, EBO was founded by the state in Aigio in 1976, after an agreement to initially produce under licence Heckler & Koch models adopted by the Greek Army, but with the intent to also design arms of its own. During its foundation ceremony, a Greek pistol of the 1820s (used in the Greek Revolution) was placed on the foundation stone to represent the continuity of Greece's arms- making craft. Since that time, the company has grown by significantly acquiring other companies, and has produced in its several factories hundreds of thousands of rifles (military and civilian) and machine guns, as well as pistols, mortars, ammunition and explosives, rocket launchers, land mines, grenades, anti-aircraft weapons, various types of bombs, cannons, night vision equipment, aircraft metal parts, as well as specialized machinery, tools, uniforms, body armor vests and reinforced composite/plastics.

The Colorado University Schools campus was the multi-collegiate campus in Golden, Colorado, spearheaded by the visionary missionary Bishop George Maxwell Randall of the Episcopal Church. History Having a ministerial passion for education and seeing great need for it in frontier Colorado Territory, Randall first established the Wolfe Hall collegiate school for girls in 1868, then in 1869 received a gift from Charles Clark Welch to begin this collegiate campus for boys. This land was on a small plateau overlooking Golden to the north, that is now annexed within the city limits. Colleges Three colleges were opened by Randall and the Episcopal Church here: *Jarvis Hall in 1870 *Matthews Hall in 1872 *Territorial School of Mines in 1873, the present day Colorado School of Mines.CampusExplorer.com: Colorado School of Mines Jarvis Hall was a liberal arts, grammar and military school. Matthews Hall was a divinity school to train future Episcopal clergy for the region. Randall strongly felt a School of Mines would be vital to the future of Colorado because of its mining economy.Goldenlandmarks.com: Colorado School of Mines Demise After Randall died in 1873 the campus began to be dismantled, from efforts within the church striving to remove its colleges to Denver. In 1874 the School of Mines was sold to the Colorado Territory government, after years of controversy over government support of a church- owned college. On 4 April 1878, Jarvis Hall burned, knocking a hole in the center of the campus. Several days later on 8 April Matthews Hall was burned by arsonists. This effectively destroyed the campus. The two schools and the Territorial School of Mines quickly moved to the Loveland Block in downtown Golden. After a short return by the School of Mines back to its original building in 1879, it then moved to its new permanent campus in the city. The campus' plateau site was fully acquired by the new state government in 1880. The remaining original School of Mines Building became the center of the Colorado State Industrial School for Boys. This original Mines building was destroyed by fire in 1893.

Gough and Millar wrote the pilot, which was directed by Greg Beeman. Justin Hartley starred as Arthur \\"A.C.\\" Curry, a young man living in a beachside community in the Florida Keys who learns about his powers and destiny as the Prince of Atlantis. The Aquaman pilot was expected to debut in the fall schedule of 2006, but following the merger of the WB and UPN, the resulting CW Network opted not to buy the series. After they passed on the pilot, it was made available online through iTunes in the United States and became the number-one most downloaded television show on iTunes. It received generally favorable reviews, was later released on other online markets, and aired on Canadian television network YTV. Pilot summary Arthur and his mother Atlanna are flying over the Bermuda Triangle. As they get closer, Atlanna's necklace begins to glow and a surge of light and energy erupts from the ocean, causing cyclones which bring their plane down. Atlanna is kidnapped by a siren, but not before giving Arthur her necklace and calling him Orin. Ten years later, Arthur is charged for releasing dolphins from a marine park. His father bails him out of trouble, but gives him a stern lecture on responsibility. Later, Arthur tells his friend Eva that he felt like the dolphins were calling to him. While he's working, he is approached by a lighthouse keeper who identifies himself as McCaffery. The Coast Guard picks up an unidentified man floating in the Bermuda Triangle and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area. Arthur is also at the Triangle, and his necklace triggers another surge of light, which causes Torres to crash her jet. Brigman transports the John Doe to another facility, and persuades Torres to join his team. Brigman is looking for a connection between the disappearances of thousands of individuals, and their reappearance years later without ever aging a day. That evening, Arthur meets a seductive young woman named Nadia, who convinces him to go swim naked with her. In the water, Nadia reveals herself to not only be a Siren, but the one that took his mother. Arthur barely escapes with a little help from McCaffery. McCaffery explains that he, Arthur and Arthur's mother were all exiled from Atlantis, and that Arthur is the prince of Atlantis. Arthur convinces Eva to leave Tempest Key for a few days, but it comes too late as Nadia injures Eva and captures Arthur. When he wakes up, Arthur finds that Nadia has also captured McCaffery and she is bringing them both back to Atlantis to be executed. Breaking free using a flask of water to enhance his strength, Arthur destroys Nadia by putting a spear through her head. The next morning, McCaffery explains that there will be more creatures that will come looking for Arthur and that he should have started his training years prior. Arthur agrees to start his training, and McCaffery leaves him with Henry IV Part 1 and Part 2 to read. McCaffery informs Arthur, who would rather just skip to the ending, that \\"It isn't about the ending, it's about the journey.\\" Ideas for future episodes focused on environmental threats, such as \\"ocean polluters\\" and \\"evil oil companies.\\" The first 13 episodes already planned out, with a possible story arc involving McCaffery being captured and taken back to Atlantis. Stories regarding mythology were set to play a small role in later episodes. Gough and Millar chose to go with a more classic version, from the comics, of Aquaman's mythology. Gough stated, \\"Unlike Superman, there really isn't a set core mythology for Arthur Curry. There are a couple different versions of it. We went with the most classic one.\\" Cast and characters * Justin Hartley as Arthur \\"A.C.\\" Curry / Orin / Aquaman: The central character of the show. He runs a dive shop in his day-to-day life.

She was the first to call him \\"Orin\\". Production=Development The concept of Aquaman stemmed from a fifth season episode of Smallville, \\"Aqua\\". The episode featured Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) coming to Smallville to stop an underwater weapons project being developed by LuthorCorp. \\"Aqua\\" became the highest rated episode for Smallville that season, but it was never meant to be a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman series. However, as work progressed on \\"Aqua\\", the character was recognized to have potential for his own series. Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, the creators of Smallville, also considered a series featuring Lois Lane, but felt more confident about Aquaman. Millar said,\\"[Aquaman] was the first idea where we really thought we had a franchise where we could see 100 episodes.\\" Alan Ritchson was not considered for the role in the new series because Gough and Millar did not consider it a spin-off from Smallville. Gough said in November 2005, \\"[The series] is going to be a different version of the 'Aquaman' legend.\\" Gough did express the idea of a crossover with Smallville at some point. There was initial speculation that the show's title would not be Aquaman. Tempest Keys and Mercy Reef were rumored to be the working titles for the series. The show would eventually be listed as Aquaman, when it was later released on iTunes. Greg Beeman, who has produced and directed episodes of Smallville, was hired to direct the pilot. Casting The role of Arthur Curry was originally given to Will Toale, after Gough and Millar saw over 400 candidates from England, Australia, Canada and the United States. Before filming began, Toale was replaced with Justin Hartley. A CW spokesman said, \\"We have made the decision to go in a different direction with the Aquaman role and wish [Toale] the best of luck in all of his endeavors.\\" Graham Bentz was cast as a young Arthur Curry, while Adrianne Palicki was cast as a Siren named Nadia. Ving Rhames, Amber McDonald, Denise Qui√±ones, Rick Peters, and Lou Diamond Phillips filled in the rest of the regular cast members. Staff Sergeant Leo Castellano teaches two actors how to salute Four of the cast members guest starred on Smallville before the Aquaman pilot. Denise Qui√±ones played Andrea Rojas in the season five episode \\"Vengeance\\", while Adrianne Palicki appeared in the season three episode \\"Covenant\\". Rick Peters was cast as Bob Rickman in the season one episode \\"Hug\\". Kenny Johnson, who briefly appears as the Sheriff in the pilot's opening, guest starred in the season five episode \\"Mortal\\". Filming Production was based in North Miami, Florida; filming began in March 2006 with an estimated budget of $7 million. Practical and exterior footage was shot around Coconut Grove, Miami. Some scenes were filmed on location at the Homestead Air Reserve Base adjacent to Homestead, Florida. The 482nd Fighter Wing Airmen were used as extras while filming at the base, along with several of their fighter aircraft. The production was expected to continue in June of that year, had it been given the greenlight. Some of the actors received training from Staff Sergeant Leo Castellano on the proper way to present arms. Much of the filming took place underwater; Hartley filmed his underwater scenes without a tank, breathing from the safety divers' tanks around him for the scenes out on the ocean. Hartley had never been scuba diving and was not a diver, but did say that he was a good swimmer. Entity FX, the firm which did the special effects for Smallville since its second season, was contracted to work on the Aquaman pilot. Arthur's powers Hartley explained that Arthur would be aware of his powers at the beginning of the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weakness around kryptonite in Smallville ‚Äì if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land. Release The pilot was considered to have a good chance of being picked up, but ultimately the CW passed on the show. Discussing the excitement surrounding the project, Lou Diamond Phillips said, \\"The funny thing about the Aquaman project is that there's so much buzz about it already. Which is amazing, I mean you don't usually get that with a pilot, because they're sort of sight unseen.\\" There were reports of two WB pilots in contention for the new CW network, one being Aquaman, which was a frontrunner. On May 18, 2006, when The CW announced its fall lineup Aquaman was not on the list. Dawn Ostroff, The CW's president of entertainment, stated that it was still a midseason contender. Gough and Miller were so passionate about the pilot that they wanted it released in some form so the fans could see it. Gough said in an interview, \\"The implication when a network doesn't pick up a show is that the pilot sucks and that's not the case. It's not a perfect pilot by any stretch of the imagination. There are other reasons‚Äîwhich are a mystery to us‚Äîas to why The CW didn't pick it up.\\" He mentioned a potential release as an extended episode during the sixth season of Smallville. On July 24, 2006, the pilot became one of the first shows offered by Warner Brothers on the iTunes Store (available only to US customers) for $1.99, under the title Aquaman. Within a week, it reached the number-one spot on the list of most downloaded TV shows on the digital store's list, and it held that spot for over a week. Gough stated, \\"At least the pilot is now getting its day in court with the fans, and the reviews have all been very positive.\\" It became the first show available on iTunes which had not previously aired on a network. The pilot was released the week of March 12, 2007 on the Xbox Live Video Marketplace. By March 24, 2007, the pilot reached #6 on the Video Marketplace's top downloads. On June 9, 2007, Canadian television network YTV, aired the pilot as part of their \\"Superhero Saturday.\\" Warner Home Video in association with Best Buy released the pilot as a promotional DVD on November 11, 2007, bundling it together with selected Smallville season sets. On February 23, 2009, Warner Bros. attached it as a bonus feature to the Blu-ray release of Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths. Critical response was generally positive. The pilot was found comparable in quality to Smallville, with suggestions that Aquaman was indeed worthy of a place on The CW's schedule. The cast was well received; in addition, Hartley was praised for his portrayal of Arthur Curry. Cinematography and underwater special effects were well received. The project was commended for keeping the comic book myth fresh and exciting for a modern audience.

The first class graduated in 1922, and consisted of 24 students.Memorial High School Website, \\"Our History\\" (accessed June 24, 2010). As Edmond grew, the school changed location several times, moving to its current location on 15th Street in the mid-1960s. The current building was built in 1966 as a seventh grade only school. It opened to its first class of seventh graders the second semester of the 66-67 school year. At that point, Edmond High School was located at the corner of Ninth Street and Rankin. It housed all sophomores, juniors and seniors in Edmond. That building is now called Central Middle School and houses sixth, seventh and eighth graders from several elementary schools on the east side of Edmond. Also, it has lost its original, distinctive E shape due to new additions. In 1975, the name of the school was changed to Edmond Memorial High School to honor six alumni who were killed while serving in Vietnam: Floyd Frazier, Jr., Allen Garrett, James Johnson, James Leonard, Danny Shores, and John Wilson. Because of its rapidly increasing size, in 1994 the school split into three, now rival schools, including Edmond North High School and Edmond Santa Fe High School. In the past decade, Memorial has undergone a wave of new construction projects, including an expanded library, new parking lots, a new football locker room/pom and cheer practice facility, and a new freshmen academy. The auditorium has also been renovated. Statistics For the 2016‚Äì2017 school year, the school had an enrollment of 2,220 students and 98.8 classroom teachers.

The third party providing the support is termed the forfaiter. The forfaiter provides medium-term finance to, and will commonly also take on certain risks from, the importer; and takes on all risk from the exporter, in return for a margin. Payment may be by negotiable instrument, enabling the forfaiter to lay off some risks.A.I. Trade Finance, Inc. v. Laminaciones de Lesaca, S.A., 41 F.3d 830 (2d Cir. 1994). Like factoring, forfaiting involves sale of financial assets from the seller‚Äôs receivables. Key differences are that forfait supports the buyer (importer) as well as the seller (exporter), and is available only for export/import transactions and in relation to capital goods.J. Downes, J.E. Goodman, \\"Dictionary of Finance & Investment Terms\\", Baron's Financial Guides, 2003; and J.G. Siegel, N. Dauber & J.K. Shim, The Vest Pocket CPA, Wiley, 2005. The word forfaiting is derived from the French word forfait, meaning to relinquish a right (in this case, the exporter‚Äôs right to receive payment from the customer - the importer).Treasury Today, Forfaiting, published September 2008, accessed 7 July 2018 Characteristics The characteristics of a forfaiting transaction are: * Credit is extended to the importer for a period of between 180 days and seven years. * The minimum bill size is normally $250,000, although $500,000 is preferred. * The payment is normally receivable in any major convertible currency. * A letter of credit or a guarantee is made by a bank, usually in the importer's country. * The contract can be for either goods or services. At its simplest, the receivables should be evidenced by a promissory note, a bill of exchange, a deferred-payment letter of credit, or a letter of forfaiting. Pricing Three elements relate to the pricing of a forfaiting transaction: * Discount rate, the interest element, usually quoted as a margin over LIBOR. * Days of grace, added to the actual number of days until maturity for the purpose of covering the number of days normally experienced in the transfer of payment, applicable to the country of risk. * Commitment fee, applied from the date the forfaiter is committed to undertake the financing, until the date of discounting. The benefits to the exporter from forfaiting include eliminating political, transfer, and commercial risks and improving cash flows. The benefit to the forfaiter is the extra margin on the loan to the exporter. Professional associations The oldest forfaiting association in the world is VEFI, the Association of Forfaiters in Switzerland (), which was founded in 1978.Welcome to the VEFI-Website!, accessed 7 July 2018 The International Trade & Forfaiting Association (ITFA) was founded in 1999 as a worldwide trade association for the forfaiting industry with a cash contribution from VEFI. Its purpose is to develop business relationships and assist other forfaiting-related organizations.

Two other buildings were added to what was called the Colorado University Schools, which School of Mines and St. Matthew Divinity, an Episcopalian seminary, flanked the central Jarvis Hall. Jarvis donated and solicited donation of books for the Jarvis Hall Library. Annual prizes were awarded at the school year end, funded and chosen by Jarvis. In July 1873, three students won multiple volume sets of the History of Rome, Tyndale's Lectures and Library of Wonders. Graduates included Francis William Loveland and architect James H. Gow, and a fire caused by a defective flue burned Jarvis Hall down on April 4, 1878. After an arson attack on sister school Matthews Hall four days later, professor in charge Thomas Lloyd Bellam decided to combine the schools as one. Jarvis Hall was temporarily relocated to the Loveland Block in downtown Golden, and before the end of 1878 Bellam funded a new Jarvis Hall building (now 921 19th Street in Golden). The 19th Street Jarvis Hall was a liberal arts and commercial college open to women. Denver Episcopal Church members in Denver succeeded in moving Jarvis Hall near the city in 1882 where it resumed as a boys school. The Jarvis Hall Military School in Montclair, Colorado burned down in 1904, and the site was subsequently used as a military airfield (Lowry Air Force Base in World War II).http://www.piton.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=CommunityFacts.Notes&neighborhood;_id=884&UseEmptyLayout; See also * Colorado School of Mines References Category:Buildings and structures in Golden, Colorado Category:Buildings and structures in Arapahoe County, Colorado Category:Defunct schools in Colorado Category:Military history of Colorado Category:Education in Denver ","title":"Jarvis Hall (Colorado)"},{"id":"4437594","text":"William Lester Wendt (March 20, 1915 ‚Äì March 12, 1966) was an American basketball coach and professional player.

Floor plans. The Boardman House, also known as the Scotch-Boardman House or the Bennett-Boardman House, is a historic house located at 17 Howard Street, Saugus, Massachusetts. Built about 1692, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961 because of the remarkable amount of original building material still present in the house. It has been owned by Historic New England since 1914, and is open to the public on select weekends between June and October. Description and history Estimates of the house's history have varied over the years, but it is currently believed that the house was constructed circa 1692 for William Boardman. Boardman purchased the property, with a different house standing on it, in 1686. Although it was long thought to have been built not long after this purchase, dendrochronology research on its beams confirms a later construction date. The house as first built had two rooms per floor, with a central chimney. On the ground floor it has a parlor and hall, with two bedrooms above, and an attic above the bedrooms. By 1696 a characteristic lean-to was added at the rear for the kitchen and milkroom giving it the appearance of a saltbox. This lean-to was completely rebuilt in 1731, reusing some of the timbers of the old one. There are five fireplaces in the house, one in each of the original rooms, and another in the kitchen. Although the house's general shape has not changed since this time, its original leaded-glass windows were at some point replaced with more modern sash windows, two original front gables were removed, and in about 1725 a new interior staircase was added. The house was owned by members of the Boardman family from its construction until 1911, when the property was sold to a developer. Concerns over the preservation of the landmark house brought it to the attention of William Sumner Appleton, who purchased the house in 1914 for the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, now Historic New England. The society restored most of the house to its original late 17th/early 18th-century appearance, removing wallpaper and other 19th-century artifacts. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961,Patricia Heintzelman and Charles Snell (1977(?)) , National Park Service and and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.

Many named variations exist, including with legs in lotus position and Supta Konasana with legs wide apart, toes on the ground. Sarva·πÖgƒÅsana has been nicknamed \\"queen\\" or \\"mother\\" of all the asanas. Etymology and origins The mudra Viparita Karani uses a variety of inverted poses, sometimes similar to the modern Sarvangasana. Illustrated manuscript of the Joga Pradipika, 1830 The name comes from the Sanskrit ‡§∏‡§≤‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§¨‡§æ Salamba, \\"supported\\", ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó SarvƒÅ·πÖga, \\"all limbs\\", i.e. \\"the whole body\\", and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® ƒÄsana, \\"posture\\",\\" position\\", or \\"seat\\". The name Sarvangasana is modern, but similar inverted poses were in use in medieval hatha yoga as a mudra, Viparita Karani, which is documented in the 14th century ≈öiva Sa·πÉhitƒÅ 4.45-47, the 15th century Ha·π≠ha Yoga Pradƒ´pikƒÅ 3.78-81, the 17th century Ghera·πá·∏ça Sa·πÉhitƒÅ 3.33-35, and other texts. Description Shoulderstand is entered from a supine position with the knees bent. The shoulders may be supported on folded blankets, and the upper arms may be held in with a belt just above the elbows. Beginners may lift with bent legs, advanced users with straight legs. The back is supported by the hands: once up, the hands reach lower down the trunk towards the head, and the trunk is lifted further; the legs may then be straightened to a vertical position. Variations The posture may be entered from Halasana (plough), moving to a cycle of poses such as Karnapidasana (ear pressing pose) with the knees bent close to the head and grasped by the arms; or to Parsva Halasana (sideways plough) with the body vertical, the trunk twisted to one side, and legs out straight with the feet touching the ground (to that side); to Supta Konasana, with the legs spread as wide as possible, the fingertips grasping the big toes; or Parsva Sarvangasana, an advanced pose, with both legs leaning to one side; and Urdhva Padmasana in Sarvangasana, with the legs in lotus position. Salamba Sarvangasana may be performed on a strong and stable chair, with the legs resting on the chair back, the body supported by a folded blanket on the chair's seat, and the shoulders and neck supported on a bolster on the ground. The hands may grasp the back legs of the chair to open the chest. The pose is entered by sitting astride the chair facing the back, lifting the legs on to the back, holding the chair and leaning back, then sliding down until the head reaches the ground. The pose is exited by bending the legs and sliding down carefully. Niralamba Sarvangasana is Unsupported Shoulderstand, with the arms off the ground. Claims Twentieth century advocates of some schools of yoga, such as B. K. S. Iyengar, made claims for the effects of yoga on specific organs, without adducing any evidence. Iyengar devoted a whole page of Light on Yoga to the beneficial effects of Sarvangasana, claiming that the pose is \\"one of the greatest boons conferred on humanity by our ancient sages\\", calling it \\"the Mother of asanas\\" and \\"a panacea for most common ailments.\\" He asserted that the pose had a direct effect on the thyroid and parathyroid glands, explaining that the chin lock increased their blood supply. He stated that the inversion increased venous blood flow to the heart, increasing the blood supply to the neck and chest, and hence relieving \\"breathlessness, palpitation, asthma, bronchitis and throat ailments.\\" He stated that it soothed the nerves and abolished headaches and with continued practice also the common cold. The soothing of the nerves in turn, he wrote, relieved hypertension, irritation, shortness of temper, nervous breakdown, and insomnia. The inversion assisted, he wrote, with bowel movements. It was useful, Iyengar claimed, for urinary disorders, menstrual problems, piles, hernia, epilepsy, low vitality, and anaemia. Safety Sarvangasana, alongside Sirsasana and Padmasana, is one of the asanas most often reported as the cause of an injury. Iyengar advised against the pose for people with high blood pressure, for whom he recommended halasana instead, as in his view it brought similar benefits.

Their line-up on most of their major releases was Karl Middleton on vocals, Owen \\"Oz\\" Packard and Joe Roberts on guitar, David Anderson and Graeme Watts on bass and Simon Hutchby on drums (the latter replaced for their EP Omega by Alex Baker). History Signing to Copro Records in 1998, the band's first major release was the album lo-def(inition) discord, which comprised songs from their three demos with a few new tracks. The record was produced on a budget of ¬£500. Their harshest and noisiest recording, it quickly grabbed the attention of the British rock press, with favourable reviews in Terrorizer and Metal Hammer and a five-star rating in mainstream modern rock magazine Kerrang!. After extensive touring, ...Discord was followed in 1999 by Off Kilter Enhancement. Again it was a critical success, but commercial recognition was limited. The band had more time and money to play with this time, and it is here that the classic et9 sound crystallised ‚Äì harsh metal inspired by Helmet and Neurosis, mixed with softer textured moments, with Tool-esque dynamics and arrangements, not to mention enigmatic song titles and lyrics (e.g. \\"M√∂e=ra (t-talk)\\", \\"i nagual eye\\"). Barely a year later, after the departure of original bassist Graeme Watts, who was replaced by David Anderson, the band delivered their third album ‚Äì voted 16th best album of 2000 by Metal Hammer ‚Äì arc'tan'gent. It was described by the band as the first record they were truly happy with, having for the first time not been rushed in the recording process. During a break in touring and rehearsing following the release of arc'tan'gent, Karl Middleton briefly entered the studio to lay down additional vocals on a song called 'unhinged' by the rising post hardcore UK band Landmine Spring. The song featured on their first full-length album Elephantine, which was released in 2001 via Loudspeaker records, and also lead to Landmine Spring playing on Earthtone9's autumn tour. Apart from some minor distribution of their existing material, attempts at an American record deal failed. The band announced their dissolution in early 2002. After their farewell tour, their rejected demo saw release as the Omega EP. In 2004, hi- point (rem), which was a remastered version of 2000's first EP hi-point, was released. Post break-up All members continued to play in bands ‚Äì notably, Karl Middleton joined hardcore supergroup The Blueprint. Furthermore, Karl Middleton and Simon Hutchby are now in Twin Zero, and Middleton is also in the Brighton-based band Blackstorm, as well as providing guest vocals on \\"Alpha Signal Three\\", a track on second album Very Fast Very Dangerous by British rock band Reuben. Owen Packard has played guitar and guested on the This Is Menace album on the track \\"No End in Sight\\". Reunion In May 2010, the band announced they were reforming \\"to play a handful of gigs to remind everyone just how good they were\\". A great hits compilation, Inside, Embers Glow..., was released for free download in July 2010. Their first announcement of a new gig came at the end of May when they were the first band confirmed for the 2010 edition of the Damnation Festival. Their first gig however was at Sonisphere Festival on Saturday 31 July 2010. On Sunday 30 January 2011, Earthtone9 announced that they will be embarking on a six date United Kingdom tour with The Ocean, Maybeshewill and Humanfly. Earthtone9 announced that they were searching for supporters through Pledge Music for their new EP For Cause and Consequence that features four new songs which at the time were already in production. The EP was released on 16 May 2011 featuring 4 new tracks; \\"Tide of Ambition\\", \\"Ghosts\\", \\"The Trail That We Carved Out\\" and \\"Reborn\\". The EP was available for download for fans who had contributed via the Pledge Music scheme.

Labaki first came into the spotlight as an actress in the early 2000s. Her film-making career began in 2007 after the release of her debut film, Caramel, which premiered at the Cannes 2007 Film Festival. She is known for demonstrating everyday aspects of Lebanese life and covering a range of political issues such as war, poverty, and feminism. She is the first female Arab director to be nominated for an Oscar in the category for Best Foreign Language Film. Early life Labaki was born in Baabdat, Mount Lebanon Governorate, Lebanon, in a Maronite family to Antoine and Antoinette Labaki. Her father is an engineer while her mother is a homemaker.‚ÄúNadine Labaki‚Äù. American University Beirut. She spent the first seventeen years of her life living in a war-torn environment, until 1991 when the civil war in Lebanon had ended. Early in life she learned the art of story telling from her uncle, who was the family hakawati (story teller). Her grandfather also owned a small theatre in Lebanon where she found her love for film. She began her career with Studio El Fan, a Lebanese talent show, in 1990. The show aired during the 1970s, which continued through to the early 2000s. At the talent show, Labaki won a prize for directing various music video productions. Labaki obtained a degree in audiovisual studies at Saint Joseph University in Beirut. In 1997, she directed her graduation film, 11 Rue Pasteur, which won the Best Short Film Award at the Biennale of Arab Cinema at the Arab World Institute in Paris. Labaki is unique among her fellow Lebanese and Arab Film Makers in that she was not educated or trained abroad. In 1998, she attended a workshop in acting at the Cours Florent in Paris. With her sister Caroline Labaki as executive producer, she went on to direct advertisements and music videos for renowned Middle Eastern singers, for which she won several awards. Striving to project the contemporary Lebanese woman, she \\"created examples of Lebanese women who were very at ease in their bodies.\\"  Career  Labaki in 2007  Director  In 2003, Labaki's name began to become more popular within the Arab media. 2003 was also the year when she began directing music videos for singer Nancy Ajram. The song, \\"Akhasmak ah\\" (I'll taunt you), sparked controversy due to the nudity presented and its sexually explicit dancing. Ajram's female character, who serves as a waitress to male customers, was seen as inappropriate and too evocative Labaki defended her script, stating that Ajram was actually portraying an \\"assertive and powerful female figure\\". Labaki and Ajram worked to redefine the image of the current Arab woman as feminine, alluring and in control. Ajram continued to collaborate with Labaki on her music videos, \\"Ya Salam,\\" \\"Lawn Ouyounak\\" and \\"Inta Eih.\\" The three videos were awarded with best music video honors. In 2005, Labaki took part in the Cannes Film Festival Residence for six months, during that time, she wrote Caramel, her first feature film. In 2006, she directed and played one of the leading roles in Caramel, which showcases a Beirut that most people are not familiar with. Rather than tackle political issues that have plagued Lebanon, she presents a comedy that deals with five Lebanese women in Beirut who gather at a beauty salon and deal with issues related to love, sexuality, tradition, disappointment, and everyday ups and downs. The film premiered at the Directors' Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007, which was a commercial success in the summer of that same year. It sold worldwide and collected important prizes at many festivals around the world, garnering Labaki much acclaim both as a director and actress. It also put her on Variety's 10 Directors to Watch list at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2008 the French Ministry of Culture and Communication gave her the Insignia of Chevalier in the Order of Arts and Letters. In 2010, Labaki directed and starred in her second feature film, Where Do We Go Now? The film humorously tackles a delicate subject about a war ravaged Middle Eastern village in which Muslim and Christian women try to keep their men from starting a religious war. The idea for this film first came about when Labaki was pregnant with her son in 2008. At that time, Lebanon was at the brink of its most violent turmoil in decades. Interreligious conflict led to outbursts in the streets of Beirut. Labaki speaks of friends becoming enemies due to religious differences. Preparing for motherhood, she began to ponder what extreme lengths mothers would go to prevent their sons from obtaining arms and taking to the streets to fight. This one idea sparked the narrative of this film, in which an entire town of women begin a mission to prevent the men from brutally killing each other. The story takes place in Lebanon, although never explicitly stated. Labaki's reasoning for this was that \\"the film is universal... this conflict does not only happen in Lebanon. I see it everywhere . . . We are scared of each other as human beings.\\" Similarly to Caramel, her second feature casts non-professional actors. In effort to heighten the reality, Labaki states that \\"normal people deserve to be on the big screen.\\" The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard category in 2011. The film won the Cadillac people's choice award at the Toronto International Film Festival. It also collected many other awards in festivals around the world, like Cannes Film Festival, San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival, Stockholm Film Festival, Doha Tribeca Film Festival. The film was also nominated for best foreign film at the Critics Choice Awards in Los Angeles. During its opening weekend, the film hit the largest ever admissions total for an Arabic-speaking film in Lebanon, amounting 21,475 admissions for a total of $153,358. In late 2013, Nadine Labaki started work on her third feature film called Capernaum which was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at 2018 Cannes Film Festival. The film tells the story of a 12-year-old boy living in the slums of Beirut. He strives to sue his parents for bringing him into a world of suffering and negligence of children. Labaki wrote the screenplay along with Jihad Hojeily, Michelle Kesrouani, Georges Khabbaz and her husband, Khaled Mouzanar. Mouzanar further produced the film and composed the music. The title Capernaum, means 'chaos'. For three years prior to writing, Labaki extensively researched the city's children to gather accounts of their experiences, stories and pasts. She used mostly non-professional actors for this film, including lead child actor Zain Al Rafeea, who was found in one of the slums playing with friends, a Syrian refugee himself. Although a rather anti-classical style of filmmaking, Labaki deems her system as \\"very organic.\\" She strived to provide these \\"forgotten children\\" with a voice and use her cinematic tools to ignite a lasting change. Labaki's style of cinematography uses cinematic conventions, such as illuminations, atmosphere lighting, and silence to help convey the meaning in her films. Despite the often dangerous political situations Labaki continues to write and direct films that do not focus on conflict. Capernaum won the Jury Prize at Cannes, and Labaki won Best Directing at the 12th Asia Pacific Screen Awards. She was selected to be on the jury for the Un Certain Regard section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. Following the success Capernaum, Creative Artists Agency (CAA) signed Labaki in all areas, but she continues to be represented in France by Art Media Agency. Her movie Capernaum was nominated in the foreign-language Oscars category, which was a first for a female director in 2019. She is the first female Arab director to ever be nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. In collaboration with the UNHCR and UNICEF, Zain Al Rafeea and his family have been resettled in Norway. He and his siblings are attending school for the first time in their lives with a hope of regaining their childhoods. This, says Labaki, is the greatest reward. Actress Nadine Labaki started acting in short films during the early 2000s. She starred in Zeina Durra's The Seventh Dog. The work won the audience award at the Circuito Off Venice International Short Film Festival in 2006. In 2006, Labaki starred in \\"Bosta,\\" a Lebanese musical comedy. The film was a box office success, outgrossing \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\\" In the same year, Labaki acted in her first feature film, Caramel. Labaki starred in Stray Bullet, directed by Georges Hachem in 2010. She appears in the Moroccan production Rock The Casbah, directed by Laila Marrakchi, alongside actors Hiam Abbas and Lubna Azabal. She has also performed in her films Where Do We Go Now? and Capernaum. Labaki often casts herself in her movies. She feels, \\"When I act with the people I cast, they feel more comfortable. I like to improvise a lot, and when I am in the film, it's like directing the scene from the inside.\\"  Themes and directing style = Themes  Growing up during the Lebanese Civil War, Labaki's films are informed by her experiences of political unrest in her home country, often exploring themes of violence and trauma. Labaki's films challenge apathy towards important issues, such as the refugee crisis and poverty. Though themes of war and tragedy are prevalent in Labaki's works, so is humour. Her films cover the Lebanese Civil War and the lasting impacts it had on the country. Her experiences impacted Labaki personally as well as how it shaped her filmmaking. Labaki has stated that she feels that as a director she has to do something good for her country. She then decided that talking about problems such as poverty and the refugee crisis is important. FF2 Media covered a Q&A; with Labaki in 2018 about her movie Capernaum, which received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year (as well as 34 other wins and 46 other nominations). She stated that while trying to brainstorm concepts for the script, her team came up with ideas that she wanted to include, such as \\"child labor, migrant labor rights, children's rights, the absurdity of having to have the papers to prove that you exist, the absurdity of borders, and early marriage\\". She believes that ‚ÄúCinema can be a way to [create] change.‚Äù She has stated that she believes that politics and art are intertwined and that her films are her own ‚Äúway of revolt‚Äù. According to Labaki, \\"sometimes, a line in a film, or a scene can make you think about yourself, about your decisions. By touching your hearts films can offer hope more than politics\\". Labaki's films have no solutions for the issues Lebanon faces, but she hopes that her films will \\"simply shake audiences out of their chronic lethargy\\". She has stated that for her, filmmaking and activism are one and the same, believing that cinema can effect social change. Another common theme in her work is feminism and the female narrative. She does this by focusing on the everyday lives of women in the middle East in her films. Through her films, Nadine Labaki connects themes from the Arab world and the Western world. Her transnational feminism highlights ordinary women affected by complex realities deeply rooted in decades of political turmoil.  Style  Labaki's films are often cast with non-professional actors. She often finds men, women, and children who live in the real neighborhoods shown on screen where they re-enact scenes from their own experiences, often in some of Beirut's grittiest slums. Labaki does this to make the film as realistic as possible. Labaki is also known for spending long periods of time to research and pick the cast for her films. She immerses herself in the lives of her subjects and spent four years researching her subject and the mistreated children in Beirut. For her film Capernaum, she gave her actors minimal direction and used hand-held cameras to capture life in the streets of Lebanon. For her film Caramel, she spent almost a year searching for women who resembled her characters. She purposely did not want professional actors, she explained, and the spontaneity of each authenticates the plot of women supporting each other as they cope with their problems. The filmmaker amassed months of raw footage, which she later edited down to just over two hours. Labaki states that she was inspired by the photo of a 3-year- old Syrian refugee whose lifeless body sparked outrage around the world. Stating, \\"I remember thinking if this child could talk, what would he say, and how would he address the adults that killed him?\\" she says. \\"I wanted to become their voice, their vehicle for them to express themselves.\\" In a 2012 interview with Jan Lisa Huttner from FF2 Media, Labaki said: \\"I have a problem with injustice. I have a problem with seeing the wrong things around me and just not saying anything about them\\".

It is accessible only by boat or by air, and in appearance and way of life is thought by some to be as close to a pre-20th century community as may be found. McCallum lies in an enclosed harbour and is sheltered between two hills. The community survives primarily on the fishery. Whaling was also a major industry in the late 19th century. It is also about an hour and a half from the nearest road, in a similar community called Hermitage.  Geography  As a result of resettlement, the community has grown and has taken in people from surrounding communities such as Pushthrough, Muddy Hole, Indian Cove, Lock's Cove, Richards Harbour, Great Jervais and Mosquito. In the past there was only a muddy or dirt walkway. Today there is a wooden walkway and also two major concrete roads. Walking is still the primary means of land transport around the community. ATVs have become rather popular, however.  History  McCallum takes its name from Sir Henry Edward McCallum, Colonial Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador from 1899 to 1901. The waters around McCallum have been fished since at least the 16th century, however no permanent settlement existed until after the Seven Years' War, after 1816. When the French gained possession of the Islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the English on the Islands were forced to find new homes, and looked just north, to Newfoundland's southern coast. It was during this time that Captain James Cook was appointed marine surveyor of Newfoundland, and mapped out in detail the coastline and waters around McCallum to create a boundary for where the French were still allowed to fish.  Facilities  McCallum has a public wharf, a fire department, a bed-and-breakfast, local internet access, a ferry service to Hermitage (where the nearest road is located), and distance education facilities. There is only one general store, Fudges Store (there were two for many years until Riggs and Sons Ltd. went out of business); the church is St Peter's Anglican, and the school is St Peter's All Grade School. The school is small with only around ten students. Distance education is a popular means of education for the high school students (grades 9 to 12). There are now more than four ATV's used for various jobs in the community, such as garbage pickup, hauling freight, and bringing groceries to the shop. Also, ATVs have become popular for residents needing to get various jobs done quicker. Snowmobiles are popular in winter. Aside from the traditional fishery, there is also a lobster fishery. In recent years there has also been aquaculture in and around the community of McCallum. However, it is now little seen. The lifeblood of McCallum revolves around the sea.

Overview Defarge is the owner of a wine shop in the slum of Saint Antoine in Paris. He and his wife Madame Therese Defarge are passionate advocates for revolution and regularly dispense and gather information from inside the wine shop. When the story starts, Defarge is harboring Dr. Alexandre Manette, his old employer, who has just been released from eighteen years of unjust and secret imprisonment in the Bastille. Defarge is loyal to Dr. Manette and truly cares for him, but he doesn‚Äôt shrink from a little exploitation by showing Manette to other patriots as an inspiration for the revolt he hopes to incite. Defarge tells Manette‚Äôs story to a group of men in the hopes that they will spread the word of abuses perpetrated by the aristocracy - specifically, two brothers named St. Evr√®monde. Defarge is the leader of his community and will be pivotal in leading the people on the Storming of the Bastille. He discovers a paper in Dr. Manette‚Äôs old cell in the Bastille which documents why Manette was imprisoned and by whom. These papers prove nearly fatal to the novel's protagonist, Charles Darnay, in recounting a series of injustices and murders by his father and uncle. Worse still, these infamies were committed against the family of Madame Defarge, Ernest's ruthless wife, who convinces him to denounce Darnay to the guillotine. Generally good-natured and decent, Defarge is torn by loyalty to his wife and loyalty to Dr. Manette; he does nothing to stop Manette's family from escaping France, despite Madame Defarge's urging. Darnay is not executed however; he is saved by Carton. Carton prophesies that Ernest Defarge and the Vengeance will be consumed by the Revolution's guillotine. Portrayals in film and theater In the 1935 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film adaptation, Ernest Defarge is portrayed by Mitchell Lewis. In the 2008 Broadway adaptation of 'A Tale of Two Cities,' Ernest Defarge is played by Kevin Earley.

Catherine Howard, Countess of Nottingham (n√©e Catherine Carey; c. 1547 ‚Äì 25 February 1603), was a cousin, lady-in-waiting, and close confidante of Elizabeth I of England. She was in attendance on the queen for 44 years. Life Catherine Carey was the eldest daughter of Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon and his wife Anne Morgan, daughter of Sir Thomas Morgan and Anne Whitney. Hunsdon was Queen Elizabeth's cousin, being the son of Mary Boleyn, and court gossip hinted at a closer connection, since Mary had been the mistress of Henry VIII. Catherine may have joined Elizabeth's household at Hatfield House as a child during the reign of Elizabeth's elder sister Mary. On Elizabeth's accession, Catherine and her younger sister Philadelphia came to court as maids of honour under the auspices of their aunt, Catherine Carey, the queen's first cousin and a Lady of the Bedchamber.Somerset (1984), p. 61Weiss (2012), p. 32 In July 1563, Catherine married Charles Howard (1536‚Äì1624), later 2nd Baron Howard of Effingham, Lord High Admiral of England, and first Earl of Nottingham (1597).Weiss (2012), p. 34 Catherine was appointed First Lady of the Bedchamber by 1572.Weiss (2012), p. 35 Her daughter Elizabeth, the queen's goddaughter, was a maid of honour from 1576 until 1583, the year of her marriage.

There are varying degrees of akinetopsia: from seeing motion as frames of a cinema reelhttps://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140624-the-man-who-saw-time- freeze to an inability to discriminate any motion. There is currently no effective treatment or cure for akinetopsia. Signs and symptoms Akinetopsia can be separated into two categories, \\"inconspicuous akinetopsia\\" or \\"gross akinetopsia\\", based on symptom severity and the amount the akinetopsia affects the patient's quality of life. Inconspicuous akinetopsia Inconspicuous akinetopsia is often described by seeing motion as a cinema reel or a multiple exposure photograph. This is the most common kind of akinetopsia and many patients consider the stroboscopic vision as a nuisance. The akinetopsia often occurs with visual trailing (palinopsia), with afterimages being left at each frame of the motion. It is caused by prescription drugs, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD), and persistent aura without infarction. The pathophysiology of akinetopsia palinopsia is not known, but it has been hypothesized to be due to inappropriate activation of physiological motion suppression mechanisms which are normally used to maintain visual stability during eye movements (e.g. saccadic suppression). Gross akinetopsia Gross akinetopsia is an extremely rare condition. Patients have profound motion blindness and struggle in performing the activities of daily living. Instead of seeing vision as a cinema reel, these patients have trouble perceiving gross motion. Most of what is known about this extremely rare condition was learned through the case study of one patient, LM. LM described pouring a cup of tea or coffee difficult \\"because the fluid appeared to be frozen, like a glacier\\". She did not know when to stop pouring, because she could not perceive the movement of the fluid rising. LM and other patients have also complained of having trouble following conversations, because lip movements and changing facial expressions were missed. LM stated she felt insecure when more than two people were walking around in a room: \\"people were suddenly here or there but I have not seen them moving\\". Movement is inferred by comparing the change in position of an object or person. LM and others have described crossing the street and driving cars to also be of great difficulty. LM started to train her hearing to estimate distance. A change in brain structure (typically lesions) disturbs the psychological process of understanding sensory information, in this case visual information. Disturbance of only visual motion is possible due to the anatomical separation of visual motion processing from other functions. Like akinetopsia, perception of color can also be selectively disturbed as in achromatopsia. There is an inability to see motion despite normal spatial acuity, flicker detection, stereo and color vision. Other intact functions include visual space perception and visual identification of shapes, objects, and faces. Besides simple perception, akinetopsia also disturbs visuomotor tasks, such as reaching for objects and catching objects. When doing tasks, feedback of one's own motion appears to be important. Causes=Brain lesions Akinetopsia may be an acquired deficit from lesions in the posterior side of the visual cortex. Lesions more often cause gross akinetopsia. The neurons of the middle temporal cortex respond to moving stimuli and hence the middle temporal cortex is the motion-processing area of the cerebral cortex. In the case of LM, the brain lesion was bilateral and symmetrical, and at the same time small enough not to affect other visual functions.Zihl, J., ULM Munich (Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry), interviewed by R. Hamrick, Oct. 28, 2009. Some unilateral lesions have been reported to impair motion perception as well. Akinetopsia through lesions is rare, because damage to the occipital lobe usually disturbs more than one visual function. Akinetopsia has also been reported as a result of traumatic brain injury. Transcranial magnetic stimulation Inconspicuous akinetopsia can be selectively and temporarily induced using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of area V5 of the visual cortex in healthy subjects. It is performed on a 1 cm¬≤ surface of the head, corresponding in position to area V5. With an 800-microsecond TMS pulse and a 28 ms stimulus at 11 degrees per second, V5 is incapacitated for about 20‚Äì30 ms. It is effective between ‚àí20 ms and +10 ms before and after onset of a moving visual stimulus. Inactivating V1 with TMS could induce some degree of akinetopsia 60‚Äì70 ms after the onset of the visual stimulus. TMS of V1 is not nearly as effective in inducing akinetopsia as TMS of V5. Alzheimer's disease Besides memory problems, Alzheimer's patients may have varying degrees of akinetopsia. This could contribute to their marked disorientation. While Pelak and Hoyt have recorded an Alzheimer's case study, there has not been much research done on the subject yet. Antidepressants Inconspicuous akinetopsia can be triggered by high doses of certain antidepressants with vision returning to normal once the dosage is reduced. Areas of visual perception Two relevant visual areas for motion processing are V5 and V1. These areas are separated by their function in vision. A functional area is a set of neurons with common selectivity and stimulation of this area, specifically behavioral influences. There have been over 30 specialized processing areas found in the visual cortex. V5 V5, also known as visual area MT (middle temporal), is located laterally and ventrally in the temporal lobe, near the intersection of the ascending limb of the inferior temporal sulcus and the lateral occipital sulcus. All of the neurons in V5 are motion selective, and most are directionally selective. Evidence of functional specialization of V5 was first found in primates. Patients with akinetopsia tend to have unilateral or bi- lateral damage to the V5. V1 V1, also known as the primary visual cortex, is located in Brodmann area 17. V1 is known for its pre-processing capabilities of visual information; however, it is no longer considered the only perceptually effective gateway to the cortex. Motion information can reach V5 without passing through V1 and a return input from V5 to V1 is not required for seeing simple visual motion. Motion-related signals arrive at V1 (60‚Äì70 ms) and V5 (< 30 ms) at different times, with V5 acting independently of V1. Patients with blindsight have damage to V1, but because V5 is intact, they can still sense motion. Inactivating V1 limits motion vision, but does not stop it completely. Ventral and dorsal streams Another thought on visual brain organization is the theory of streams for spatial vision, the ventral stream for perception and the dorsal stream for action. Since LM has impairment in both perception and action (such as grasping and catching actions), it has been suggested that V5 provides input to both perception and action processing streams. Case studies=Potzl and Redlich's patient In 1911, Potzl and Redlich reported a 58-year-old female patient with bilateral damage to her posterior brain. She described motion as if the object remained stationary but appeared at different successive positions. Additionally, she also lost a significant amount of her visual field and had anomic aphasia. Goldstein and Gelb's patient In 1918, Goldstein and Gelb reported a 24-year-old male who suffered a gunshot wound in the posterior brain. The patient reported no impression of movement. He could state the new position of the object (left, right, up, down), but saw \\"nothing in between\\". While Goldestein and Gelb believed the patient had damaged the lateral and medial parts of the left occipital lobe, it was later indicated that both occipital lobes were probably affected, due to the bilateral, concentric loss of his visual field. He lost his visual field beyond a 30-degree eccentricity and could not identify visual objects by their proper names. \\"LM\\" Most of what is known about akinetopsia was learned from LM, a 43-year-old female admitted into the hospital October 1978 complaining of headache and vertigo. LM was diagnosed with thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus which resulted in bilateral, symmetrical lesions posterior of the visual cortex. These lesions were verified by PET and MRI in 1994. LM had minimal motion perception that was preserved as perhaps a function of V1, as a function of a \\"higher\\" order visual cortical area, or some functional sparing of V5. LM found no effective treatment, so she learned to avoid conditions with multiple visual motion stimuli, i.e. by not looking at or fixating them. She developed very efficient coping strategies to do this and nevertheless lived her life. In addition, she estimated the distance of moving vehicles by means of sound detection in order to continue to cross the street. LM was tested in three areas against a 24-year-old female subject with normal vision: ;Visual functions other than movement vision LM had no evidence of a color discrimination deficit in either center or periphery of visual fields. Her recognition time for visual objects and words was slightly higher than the control, but not statistically significant. There was no restriction in her visual field and no scotoma. ;Disturbance of movement vision LM's impression of movement depended on the direction of the movement (horizontal vs vertical), the velocity, and whether she fixated in the center of the motion path or tracked the object with her eyes. Circular light targets were used as stimuli. In studies, LM reported some impression of horizontal movement at a speed of 14 degrees of her predetermined visual field per second (deg/s) while fixating in the middle of the motion path, with difficulty seeing motion both below and above this velocity. When allowed to track the moving spot, she had some horizontal movement vision up to 18 deg/s. For vertical movement, the patient could only see motion below 10 deg/s fixated or 13 deg/s when tracking the target. The patient described her perceptual experience for stimulus velocities higher than 18 and 13 deg/s, respectively as \\"one light spot left or right\\" or \\"one light spot up or down\\" and \\"sometimes at successive positions in between\\", but never as motion. ;Motion in depth To determine perception of motion in depth, studies were done in which the experimenter moved a black painted wooden cube on a tabletop either towards the patient or away in line of sight. After 20 trials at 3 or 6 deg/s, the patient had no clear impression of movement. However she knew the object had changed in position, she knew the size of the cube, and she could correctly judge the distance of the cube in relation to other nearby objects. ;Inner and outer visual fields Detection of movement in the inner and outer visual fields was tested. Within her inner visual field, LM could detect some motion, with horizontal motion more easily distinguished than vertical motion. In her peripheral visual field, the patient was never able to detect any direction of movement. LM's ability to judge velocities was also tested. LM underestimated velocities over 12 deg/s. ;Motion aftereffect and Phi phenomenon Motion aftereffect of vertical stripes moving in a horizontal direction and a rotating spiral were tested. She was able to detect motion in both patterns, but reported motion aftereffect in only 3 of the 10 trials for the stripes, and no effect for the rotating spiral. She also never reported any impression of motion in depth of the spiral. In Phi phenomenon two circular spots of light appear alternating. It appears that the spot moves from one location to the other. Under no combination of conditions did the patient report any apparent movement. She always reported two independent light spots. ;Visually guided pursuit eye and finger movements LM was to follow the path of a wire mounted onto a board with her right index finger. The test was performed under purely tactile (blindfolded), purely visual (glass over the board), or tactile-visual condition. The patient performed best in the purely tactile condition and very poorly in the visual condition. She did not benefit from the visual information in the tactile-visual condition either. The patient reported that the difficulty was between her finger and her eyes. She could not follow her finger with her eyes if she moved her finger too fast. ;Additional experiments In 1994, several other observations of LM's capabilities were made using a stimulus with a random distribution of light squares on a dark background that moved coherently. With this stimulus, LM could always determine the axis of motion (vertical, horizontal), but not always the direction. If a few static squares were added to the moving display, identification of direction fell to chance, but identification of the axis of motion was still accurate. If a few squares were moving opposite and orthogonal to the predominant direction, her performance on both direction and axis fell to chance. She was also unable to identify motion in oblique directions, such as 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees, and always gave answers in cardinal directions, 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees.  \\"TD\\"  In 2019, Heutink and colleagues described a 37-year old female patient (TD) with akinetopsia, who was admitted to Royal Dutch Visio, Centre of Expertise for blind and partially sighted people. TD suffered an ischaemic infarction of the occipitotemporal region in the right hemisphere and a smaller infarction in the left occipital hemisphere. MRI confirmed that the damaged brain areas contained area V5 in both hemispheres. TD experienced problems with perceiving visual motion and also reported that bright colours and sharp contrasts made her feel sick. TD also had problems perceiving objects that were more than ¬± 5 meters away from her. Although TD had some impairments of lower visual functions, these could not explain the problems she experienced with regard to motion perception. Neuropsychological assessment revealed no evidence of Balint's Syndrome, hemispatial neglect or visual extinction, prosopagnosia or object agnosia. There was some evidence for impaired spatial processing. On several behavioural tests, TD showed a specific and selective impairment of motion perception that was comparable to LM's performance. Effect of target speed on motion perception in TD TD's ability to determine the direction of movement was tested using a task in which small grey blocks all moved in the same direction with the same speed against a black background. The blocks could move in four directions: right to left, left to right, upward and downward. Speed of movement was varied from 2, 4.5, 9, 15 and 24 degrees per second. Speed and direction were varied randomly across trials. TD had perfect perception of motion direction at speed up to 9 degrees per second. When speed of targets was above 9 degrees per second, TD's performance dropped dramatically to 50% correct at a speed of 15 degrees per second and 0% correct at 24 degrees per second. When the blocks moved at 24 degrees per second, TD consistently reported the exact opposite direction of the actual movement. Pelak and Hoyt's Alzheimer's patient In 2000, a 70-year-old man presented with akinetopsia. He had stopped driving two years prior because he could no longer \\"see movement while driving\\". His wife noted that he could not judge the speed of another car or how far away it was. He had difficulty watching television with significant action or movement, such as sporting events or action-filled TV shows. He frequently commented to his wife that he could not \\"see anything going on\\". When objects began to move they would disappear. He could, however, watch the news, because no significant action occurred. In addition he had signs of Balint's syndrome (mild simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, and optic apraxia). Pelak and Hoyt's TBI patient In 2003, a 60-year-old man complained of the inability to perceive visual motion following a traumatic brain injury, two years prior, in which a large cedar light pole fell and struck his head. He gave examples of his difficulty as a hunter. He was unable to notice game, to track other hunters, or to see his dog coming towards him. Instead, these objects would appear in one location and then another, without any movement being seen between the two locations. He had difficulties driving and following a group conversation. He lost his place when vertically or horizontally scanning a written document and was unable to visualize three-dimensional images from two-dimensional blueprints.

A youth international for Chile, Escalona played for Colo-Colo, Torino, Benfica, River Plate and Gr√™mio, but was mostly linked to Everton de Vi√±a del Mar, representing them on three spells. Career Born in Santiago, Escalona joined Colo-Colo in 1995, where he finish his youth development. He made his professional debut in 1997, in a single appearance, winning his first honour, the 1997 Torneo Clausura. The following season, he played 16 matches with one goal, adding another league title. He started 1999 at Colo-Colo, but after a receiving praise in the 1999 South American U-20 Championship, he moved to Torino. In Italy, he was unable to replicate his performances, and played only three games and saw the team being relegated. In early July 2000, Escalona was set to join Napoli, but no agreement was reached with Torino. On the 12th, Benfica successfully signed with Escalona, with Cristi√°n Uribe playing an important role in convincing the 21 year-old. He made his debut for Benfica in a friendly against Linfield on 3 August, during the Carlsberg Belfast Challenge. After the match, in an interview for the Portuguese media, he downplayed the fact that he was unknown in Portugal, saying: \\"I will show on the field what I am worth\\". However, in a season that saw three managers pass through Benfica, Escalona could never gain his place, battling with the youngster Diogo Lu√≠s and the Paraguayan Rojas for the position and playing just nine league matches. In January 2001, his agent, Pablo Tallarico was involved in a fake Italian passports scandal, that included Uribe and Pablo Contreras. Initially, he denied knowledge of any wrongdoing, but in May, he had his passport seized by the Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria, and his contract with Benfica terminated. On 30 July 2001, Escalona signed a one-year deal with River Plate, but played just one league game under Manuel Pellegrini. Released by River Plate, he returned to Chile in January 2003, joining Everton de Vi√±a del Mar in the second tier. His good performances, which included a promotion to the top tier, helped secure a loan deal to Gr√™mio in March 2005. He helped Gr√™mio win the 2005 S√©rie B and earn promotion back to the S√©rie A, despite being sent-off in the crucial match, dubbed the Batalha dos Aflitos. After his loan deal expired, Escalona joined Na√∫tico in December 2006, but failed to impress, and was released just four months later. In July 2007, he re-signed with Everton for six months, playing 13 games in the 2007 season. After not competing in 2008, he moved to San Luis Quillota in 2009, where he helped them win promotion from the second tier in the first year and played 24 matches in the 2010 Primera Divisi√≥n campaign that ended with relegation. In his last two seasons, he had a third spell at Everton, returned to San Luis Quillota and finished at Curic√≥ Unido in 2012.
