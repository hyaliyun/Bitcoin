The prison of Saint-Laurent-du- Maroni was the main penal colony in French Guiana for more than a century. Some of the buildings were restored in the early 1980s. History \\"Quartier Sp√©cial\\" - Condemned men's block, St. Laurent-du-Maroni, 1954 (the guillotine stood at the spot where the photographer took the photo). On 22 November 1850, Napoleon III declared: \\"Six thousand condemned men in our prisons weigh heavily on our budget, becoming increasingly depraved and constantly menacing our society. I think it is possible to make the sentence of forced labour more effective, more moralising, less expensive and more humane by using it to further the progress of French colonisation.\\" The first batch of prisoners left the Breton port of Brest for the √éles du Salut on 31 March 1852. The prison at St-Laurent-du-Maroni was established on the banks of the Maroni River on 21 February 1858. All the prisoners sent from France were taken there before being transferred to other prisons or camps. The town of Saint-Laurent- du-Maroni proper was founded on 16 March 1880; it was a penal town whose inhabitants were nearly all guards or liberated prisoners. The hospital was built in 1912, and the prison itself closed in 1946, the same year the whole colonial penal system was abolished. Life in the prison \\"Quartier - Disciplinaire\\", Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, 1954 The prison at Saint-Laurent was but a temporary stop for most prisoners. Only a small number of men ever stayed in Saint-Laurent for long, and they were nearly all employed in the penitentiary administration or were considered harmless and unlikely to try to escape. When a ship (such as La Loire or La Martini√®re) arrived from Saint- Martin-de-R√©, the first order of the day was to separate the \\"chevaux de retour\\" (literally \\"returned horses\\", but meaning the escaped prisoners) and the recidivists from the rest, to send them to the √éles du Salut, from whose shores escape was considered impossible. (A few, however, succeeded; most famously, Henri Charri√®re, who later wrote Papillon.) The new prisoners then stayed for a while in Saint-Laurent, where they were sorted into different camps or prisons. The ones considered to be shifty and eager to escape were sent to the islands along with the recidivists and ex-escapees. The least dangerous men, condemned to prison for petty offences, were offered jobs in the penitentiary administration. The prisoners were also separated by nationality, as there were special camps reserved for those from Indochina, and the Arabs often became guards. Since there was a hospital in Saint- Laurent, many prisoners faked illnesses to get sent there, where they had plenty of time to plot escapes (as experienced and written by, among others, Charri√®re). Since many prisoners worked in the hospital, this was not terribly hard to do. Those who were lucky enough to stay in Saint-Laurent were generally better treated than prisoners in other camps. Their work was simple, they were free to go wherever they wanted inside the prison, and were given better rations.

Former names are Gay Enterprise and Solent Enterprise. History The vessel was built in 1971 for the Gosport Ferry service by James and Stone of Brightlingsea, primarily for cruising Portsmouth Harbour and the Solent. Originally called Gay Enterprise, the name was changed in the winter of 1979, during her standby ferry duties, to Solent Enterprise. It had a similar design to the company's two 1966 Queens (Portsmouth Queen and Gosport Queen) but the interior was more comfortable because of its different duty. It was painted in later years in a blue livery with a large Solent Enterprise banner on its side barriers. In its later years of service, it was regularly used on ferry duties between Gosport and Portsmouth when either of the Queens were out of service. In 2001, Gosport Ferry Company purchased a new ferry, the Spirit of Gosport, but the company also wanted to replace the Solent Enterprise in its cruising role. Both Queens therefore stayed on, and the Spirit of Gosport only had a few ferry duties in its first few months. In 2005, another new vessel was purchased, Spirit of Portsmouth. This was fitted out with a covered top deck and a bar and to suit its cruise duties. This meant that Solent Enterprise was no longer required by the Gosport Ferry service and she was sold to Capital Pleasure Boats in 2005. Her new owners renamed her Sundance and she operated on the River Thames in London as a charter vessel catering for parties, corporate entertainment, weddings and other functions. Later, she was sold again and moved to Copenhagen to be used as a floating cafe. However, in the early hours of the morning of 11 February 2016, a fire broke out on board completely engulfing the top deck and left her badly damaged. Sundance was repaired and turned back into a houseboat but remains in Copenhagen today under new ownership.

The journal is currently published by John Wiley & Sons, and is edited by Helen Castle since 2001. History In its early days, the journal was more concerned with the British scene, but it gradually became more international. In 1946 Monica Pidgeon became editor and developed the magazine under the ownership of Standard Catalogue Company. Contributors during the 1960s included Theo Crosby and Kenneth Frampton. It moved away from presenting mostly news towards theme-based issues. During the late 1970s and 1980s it was the bastion of Postmodernism, with frequent articles and special editions guest-edited by Charles Jencks, the theoretical father of postmodern architecture. At that time the journal was the mouthpiece of the publishers Academy Editions (marketed in the USA under St. Martins Press), based in Leinster Gardens, London (they also had their own bookstore), and they published very many well-known titles concerned with postmodernism. The long-standing Editor-in-Chief, until the mid-1980s, was Andreas Papadakis. The content of the journal is seen during the latter half of its history as running parallel with the cutting edge of avant-gardism, promoting innovation as well as celebrity status ‚Äì 'stararchitects'. Thus, at the height of Postmodernism in the late 1970s ‚Äì when it often featured the works of Michael Graves, Robert Stern, Leon Krier, James Stirling, Robert Krier and Aldo Rossi ‚Äì it also published Rem Koolhaas's later influential book Delirious New York (1979). An undercurrent to Postmodernism featured in the journal was that of \\"architecture without a style\\", a vernacular classical architecture, epitomised by the work of Quinlan Terry, Demetri Porphyrios and John Simpson. The journal went partly into decline with the demise of postmodernism, though it then shifted its coverage towards Deconstructivism, folding in architecture, 'blob' architecture, biomorphism, and digital architecture. The shift in emphasis can be pinpointed to a single edition of the journal, devoted to the two polar positions at that time: \\"Peter Eisenman versus Leon Krier: 'My ideology is better than yours.'\\" ('Architectural Design', 9-10/1989). The current avant-gardist interest of the journal in biomorphism is a return to issues the journal was covering in the 1960s and 1970s, before posism, with the architecture of Archigram, Cedric Price and the thinking of Reyner Banham. The publication became part of John Wiley & Sons in 1997 when it acquired AD's German publisher VCH who had acquired the title from Andreas Papadakis' Academy Editions in 1991.

Women in the Russian and Soviet military have played many roles in their country's military history. Women of Russia and the Soviet Union played an important role in World Wars, especially during World War II. World War I Women served in the Russian armed forces in small numbers in the early stages of the war, but their numbers increased after heavy Russian losses such as at the Battle of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes and a need for increased manpower. One such recruit was Maria Bochkareva who served with the 25th Reserve Battalion of the Russian Army. After the abdication of Nicholas II of Russia in March 1917, she convinced interim prime minister Alexander Kerensky to let her form a women's battalion. The Women's Battalion recruited women between the ages of 13 and 25 and appealed for support in a series of public meetings, enlisting approximately 2,000 soldiers. The Battalion fought during the June Offensive against German forces in 1917. Three months of fighting reduced their numbers to around two-hundred and fifty. The Women's Battalion was disbanded after a failed military coup known as the Kornilov Affair. Its leader, General Lavr Kornilov, had been strongly supported by Bachkarova, and the Women's Battalion were identified as potential sympathizers. The majority of the battalion's members were reformed as the First Petrograd Women's Battalion. This group was at the Winter Palace on the night of the Bolshevik Revolution, along with an untrained cadet detachment and a bicycle regiment. They mounted a resistance but ultimately fell, although there were only 5 deaths in the storming of the Winter Palace. The triumphant Bolsheviks officially disbanded the group. Several women pilots are known from the First World War, one example being Sofya Alekseevna Dolgorukova. Princess Eugenie Shakovskaya was assigned duty as an artillery and reconnaissance pilot, having volunteered for the Imperial Russian Air Service in 1914 (one of the world‚Äôs first female military aviators) and flew missions with the 26th Corps Air Squadron in 1917 for nine months. Because of her connections to the Imperial family she was demobilized after the October Revolution. Lyubov A. Golanchikova was a test pilot who contributed her airplane to the Czarist armies; Helen P. Samsonova was assigned to the 5th Corps Air Squadron as a reconnaissance pilot. And in 1915, Nedeshda Degtereva had the distinction of being the first woman pilot to be wounded in combat while on a reconnaissance mission over the Austrian front in Galicia. World War II Women played a part in most of the armed forces of the Second World War. In most countries though, women tended to serve mostly in administrative, medical and in auxiliary roles. But in the Soviet Union women fought also in front line roles. Over 800,000 women served in the Soviet armed forces in World War II, mostly as medics and nurses, which is over 3 percent of total personnel; nearly 200,000 of them were decorated. 89 of them eventually received the Soviet Union‚Äôs highest award, the Hero of the Soviet Union, they served as pilots, snipers, machine gunners, tank crew members and partisans, as well as in auxiliary roles.Women and the Soviet Military Few of these women, however, were promoted to officers. =Aviators= For Soviet women aviators, instrumental to this change was Marina Raskova, a famous Russian aviator. Raskova became a famous aviator as both a pilot and a navigator in the 1930s. She was the first woman to become a navigator in the Soviet Air Force in 1933. Raskova is credited with using her personal connections with Joseph Stalin to convince the military to form three combat regiments for women. The Soviet Union was the first nation to allow women pilots to fly combat missions. These regiments with strength of almost hundred airwomen, flew a combined total of more than 30,000 combat sorties, produced over twenty Heroes of the Soviet Union, and included two fighter aces. This military unit was initially called Aviation Group 122 while the three regiments received training. After their training, the three regiments received their formal designations as the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment, the 587th Bomber Aviation Regiment, and the 588th Night Bomber Regiment. Two of the units were honored with the Guards designation and renamed. =Land forces= The Soviet Union also used women for sniping duties, and to good effect, including Nina Alexeyevna Lobkovskaya and Ukrainian Lyudmila Pavlichenko (who killed over 300 enemy soldiers). The Soviets found that sniper duties fit women well, since good snipers are patient, careful, deliberate, and should avoid tactical hand- to-hand combat. Women served also in non-combat roles as medics, nurses, communication personnel, political officers, as well - in small numbers - as machine gunners, tank drivers. Manshuk Mametova was a machine gunner from Kazakhstan and was the first Asian woman to receive the title Hero of the Soviet Union after she refused to retreat with the rest of her regiment. =Partisans= Women constituted significant numbers of the Soviet partisans. One of the most famous was Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, who was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 16 February 1942. The youngest woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union was also a resistance fighter, Zinaida Portnova. Post 1945 After the war, most women left the armed forces. Those that stayed to make a career in the post-war armed forces saw old attitudes return and promotion and opportunities more difficult. Also, some military academies closed their doors to women despite the supposed official policy of equality. In 1967, the Soviet Universal Military Duty Laws concluded that women offered the greater source of available soldiers during periods of large scale mobilization. Thus, several programs during the height of the Cold War were set up to encourage women to enlist. Participation in military orientated youth programs and forced participation in the reserves for ex-servicewomen up to the age of 40 are some examples. Universities contained reservist officer training which accompanied a place in the reserves themselves, especially for doctors. But some roles open to women during the war were later barred. Women have had the legal right to serve in the Russian Armed Forces throughout the post Cold War period. In 2002, 10% of the Russian armed forces (100,000 of a total active strength of 988,100) were women.The Military Balance 2002-2003, International Institute for Strategic Studies  See also  *Russian Armed Forces *Soviet Armed Forces *Soviet women in World War II *Women in the Russian Revolution *Women in Russia References * 'Wings, Women, and War: Soviet Airwomen in World War II Combat' by Reina Pennington and John Erickson (Foreword) * 'Heroines of the Soviet Union 1941-45' by Henry Sakaida and Christa Hook (Author) Further reading *Mathers, Jennifer G.

It consists of Ryan Maguire, better known by his stage name Kingston, and Ian Taggart, better known by his stage name Young God, or, later, Televangel. They are known principally for their hip hop and instrumental music, made with a mixture of live instrumentation and sampling. Their name is \\"a skydiving phrase alluding to beauty and death.\\" History Kingston and Young God met and began collaborating on music in 2003. Young God, working under the name Rev. Left, began creating beats to rap over, but abandoned rapping and started producing exclusively around 2000. Kingston, working under the name Orphan, began his solo producing career collaborating with rapper Noah23 and the Plague Language collective (to which Young God also contributed production). Kingston contributed production to Noah23's debut album Cytoplasm Pixel in 1999, and the two collaborated closely until Jupiter Sajitarius in 2004, after which they parted ways. In the same year, Kingston worked on projects for Virtuoso's Omnipotent Records. He contributed a number of tracks to Jus Allah's scheduled Omnipotent debut All Fates Have Changed, but the album was shelved. The tracks \\"Vengeance\\" and \\"Drill Sergeant\\" were later released on BSBD's Dirtnap mixtape, and a number of other beats recorded for the album were bootlegged on The Devil'z Rejects album Necronomicon. One Kingston beat, \\"Supreme (Black God's Remix)\\" was included on the Babygrande Records release of All Fates Have Changed in 2005. The duo, collaborating initially under the name Torso, signed their first record deal with Mush Records in 2005 to release the label's first double-disc album. During the album's production, the duo settled on their current name. The album, A Heap of Broken Images, was released on June 23, 2006. The first disc featured twelve instrumental tracks with heavy live-instrumentation, while the second disc featured nine rap collaborations made with traditional hip hop sampling, and a closing instrumental. The guests included Rob Sonic, Mike Ladd, Jus Allah, Sabac Red, Wise Intelligent, A-Plus, Pep Love, Chief Kamachi, Myka 9, Virtuoso, Awol One and Holocaust. The album received acclaim from various sources, including Vapors, Word, Mean Street, UK Hip Hop and Allmusic, and landed the duo on URB's \\"Next 100.\\" Around the same time, the duo completed a collaborative project with Ceschi Ramos entitled Deadpan Darling, which was never released due to the loss of most of the final mixes on a crashed hard drive. Career The acclaim received for their debut album led to the duo landing a record deal with popular independent rap label Babygrande Records later in 2006. Their first release on the label was a full-length collaboration with Holocaust, titled Blue Sky Black Death Presents: The Holocaust, released on September 5. Holocaust provided all the album's vocals with no guest appearances, and BSBD provided production for every track. The album included the duo's first 12-inch single The Ocean / No Image. The duo's next album was a collaboration with another Wu-Tang affiliate, Sunz of Man and Black Market Militia member Hell Razah. Their album Razah's Ladder was released on October 23, 2007. Unlike The Holocaust, the album included outside guest appearances, featuring Crooked I, Shabazz the Disciple, Ill Bill, Sabac Red and Prodigal Sunn. The duo strayed from the dark soundscapes featured on The Holocaust, instead providing a soulful backdrop for Razah. Shortly before the release of Razah's Ladder, the duo released their first mixtape, titled Dirtnap, featuring various unreleased collaborations and two instrumentals from their forthcoming album. The duo's next release was their first all- instrumental project, Late Night Cinema, released on April 29, 2008. The dense instrumentals featured contributions from violinists, organists, trumpeters, synth players and vocalists, as well as guitar, keyboard and drum kit work from the producers themselves. The album received high acclaim from XLR8R, Music-Reviewer, PopMatters, SputnikMusic and RapReviews.com. RapReviews writer Pedro Hernandez stated \\"With this album, Blue Sky Black Death pushes the limits of what hip-hop music can be\\" and called it \\"essential listening\\". BSBD stayed active online throughout 2008, releasing two instrumental podcast blends titled Gifts in Jail Vol. 1 and Gifts in Jail Vol. 2, as well as a screwed version of Late Night Cinema titled Lean Night Cinema. In June 2008, after an online petition from fans, Babygrande released the acclaimed instrumentals from The Holocaust on vinyl and CD. BSBD then contributed twelve of thirteen tracks for Phoenix MC Gutta's debut album Heads Will Roll, released on Babygrande on September 2. On September 30, Babygrande released the album The Evil Jeanius, by pairing Jean Grae vocals with Blue Sky Black Death beats. November saw the duo's fifth release of the year, Slow Burning Lights, an indie pop project with singer Yes Alexander), which was recorded and completed two years before its release. Third Party, a collaboration with Alexander Chen of Boy in Static, was released on Fake Four Inc in 2010. In 2011, Blue Sky Black Death released a new album, Noir, on Fake Four Inc. The duo also released For the Glory, a collaborative album with rapper Nacho Picasso, in the same year. Two more collaborative albums with Nacho Picasso, Lord of the Fly and Exalted, were released in 2012. A follow up album with Yes Alexander entitled World Wide Romance was scheduled to be released sometime in 2013. The first single from the album Heart Attack was released in 2010. In May 2013, BSBD released a single titled \\"Valley of Kings\\" which features Cam'ron, SAS and N.O.R.E. This was followed by the release of their new instrumental album Glaciers on October 1, 2013. On February 14, 2014, Blue Sky Black Death released an unofficial remix of Frank Ocean's 2012 single \\"Pyramids\\", which included a chopped and screwed sample of Pimp C's verse from UGK's 1999 single \\"Wood Wheel\\". In January 2014, the duo returned to their roots and looked to truly realize ideas which were previously seen in their earlier works. BSBD also had cameos from other Fake Four Inc. signers, Child Actor and JMSN, in their album Glaciers.Glaciers (album) In December 2017 Blue Sky Black Death made a post on their official Twitter saying simply they were \\"resting eternally\\". In comment, Young God of Blue Sky Black Death replied the group hadn't been working on a project for some time but they were still in contact.https://twitter.com/BSBDmusic/status/943936355037364224 Discography Blue Sky Black Death * A Heap of Broken Images (Mush, 2006) * Late Night Cinema (Babygrande, 2008) * Noir (Fake Four, 2011) * Glaciers (Fake Four, 2013) Nacho Picasso & Blue Sky Black Death * For the Glory (2011) * Lord of the Fly (2012) * Exalted (2012) * Stoned & Dethroned (2015) Other collaborations * The Holocaust (Babygrande, 2006) (with Warcloud) * Razah's Ladder (Babygrande, 2007) (with Hell Razah) * The Evil Jeanius (Babygrande, 2008) (with Jean Grae) * Slow Burning Lights (Babygrande, 2008) (with Yes Alexander) * Third Party (Fake Four, 2010) (with Alexander Chen) * Skull & Bones (2012) (with Bolo Nef & Caz Greez) * Celestial (Man Bites Dog, 2016) (with S.A.S.)

Features The village features a Catholic church (St. Anne's, built in 1824), a public house, a now closed shop-garage and about seven dwelling houses. It also has St. Anne's Holy Well, where people are said to have gone to pray for cures in the past (enclosed by a wall in 1974). The village was larger in the 19th century and gave its name to a parish of its own, which was administered from Mothel, about 10 miles to the north. Today Ballylaneen is part of Stradbally parish, whose parish priest resides in Stradbally, about 4 miles away. The ruins of a large mill can be seen on the river Mahon, east of the village. This was one of five mills, which were sited on the river Mahon. The other four were at Mahonbridge (one) and Kilmacthomas (three). The present day village, with its church and graveyard, is actually situated in the townland of Carrigcastle, while the old school and old graveyard are located in the townland of Ballylaneen. As mentioned above, there are two graveyards associated with the village. The newer of the two, adjacent to St Anne's church (built in 1824) has one grave of interest: a flat horizontal tombstone commemorating Mark Anthony of Carrigcastle (1786 ‚Äì 1 June 1867) who was an officer in the British Royal Navy and served in the battle of Trafalgar. The Anthonys, though catholic, were well-to-do and had a big house (still standing at Seafield about 1.5 miles from Ballylaneen) and lands in Carrigcastle and Seafield. The old graveyard (rarely used nowadays) is outside the present village on the Kilmacthomas road. It is the burial place of the famous poet Tadhg Gaelach √ì S√∫illeabh√°in (see below). Half a mile to the west of the village is an ancient stone-walled circular enclosure called Cathair Breac on a hill overlooking the village. On another hill in Carrigcastle (called Mandeville's Rock) south-west of the village, there is a subterranean neolithic corbel-roofed chamber, which was accidentally unearthed by a bulldozer during land reclamation in the early 1970s. It was filled in with stones for safety reasons. The village had its own primary school, originally established under the British National School system. It was finally closed down in the 1950s, after which most of the pupils from the area attended Seafield near Bunmahon. The old school building is still standing adjacent to the old graveyard, and was refurbished as a holiday home in the 1990s. The best-known teacher at the National School was the Gaelic scholar Tom Walsh (Tomas Breathnach) around 1910. While he taught there, promising children from other school catchment areas attended, including John Kiely of Stradbally (later FRCSI) and David Hill of Kilmacthomas (later MPSI). Tom Walsh translated the Latin epitaph on the tombstone of Tadhg Gaelach √ì S√∫illeabh√°in (composed by Donncha Rua mac Conmara, a poet fried of Tadhg) to Gaelic. Walsh was succeeded by Tom Cashin NT of Stradbally who taught in Ballylaneen until the school's closure and who features in accounts of the disappearance of Larry Griffin, the missing postman from Kilmacthomas in 1929. The name Ballylaneen appears in a book title ‚ÄúThe Road From Ballylaneen to Skellig Michael‚Äù by English writer Michael White, being randomly chosen for its good phonetic sound and its location near the south coast. People Inscription on the gravestone for Tadhg Gaelach √ì S√∫illeabh√°in originally composed by Donnacha Rua in Latin (carved on the gravestone) and translated to Irish shown on the black plaque (above) by teacher Tom Walsh around 1910. The old graveyard in Ballylaneen is the burial place of the famous Munster poet and religious writer Tadhg Gaelach √ì S√∫illeabh√°in. His tombstone is a flat upright monument with a curved top and a Latin inscription on the front. It's located a few metres from the gable end of the old National School building. The Latin epitaph was composed by the poet Donncha Rua mac Conmara (buried in Newtown, 4 miles away), who was a friend of his. The Irish translation on the black plastic plaque (shown right) was done by Tom Walsh (Tomas Breatnac), the teacher in the old National School in the early 1900s. Tadhg Gaelach √ì S√∫illeabh√°in (Timothy O'Sullivan) was born in Tuar na Fola (Tournafulla), Co. Limerick around 1715. He moved first to Cork, where he lived for about 30 years, and later to Co. Waterford and died in Waterford city in 1795. His writings include Timothy O'Sullivan's Pious Miscellany published in English in 1802 in Clonmel (his work was originally written and published in Irish while he was alive). His works were published again in Gaelic in 1868 by John O'Daly Publishers, 9 Anglesea St., Dublin (see reprint at https://archive.org/stream/piousmiscellanyo00suoft#page/n3/mode/2up), and there is considerable information in the preface written O'Daly, although O'Daly's account of Tadhg Gaelach's dates and birthplace are now agreed to be incorrect. Up to the time of his death, Tadhg Gaelach was admired and possibly sometimes looked after by a relatively prosperous local catholic farming family, the O'Callaghans. He was also a frequent guest of Ballylaneen Parish Priest, Rev Richard Morrissey, who is most likely to be responsible for Tadhg's being buried here. Other patrons of his included an O'Phelan (Faol√°in) family of the Decies, and one of his songs is written in their honour (‚ÄúDo Seoirse agus Domhnall √ì Faoil√°in‚Äù to be sung to the air of ‚ÄúBonny Jane‚Äù, see https://archive.org/stream/piousmiscellanyo00suoft#page/82/mode/2up). Tadhg Gaelach's hymns were published by an tAthair P√°draig Ua Duinn√≠nin in Dublin in 1903.

Her former names are Southsea Queen, Hythe Hotspur and Poole Scene. History Southsea Queen was built in 1974 by James & Stone of Brightlingsea for the Gosport Ferry Company for cruising and standby ferry duties. She was similar to Solent Enterprise, from the same shipyard but with a flared pointed bow. However, at 119 GRT she proved too small for her job and just four years later was sold to White Horse Ferries for use on its Hythe Ferry service. She was renamed Hythe Hotspur and repainted from her green with red band livery to a red and white livery. She was withdrawn from this service in 1995 and chartered to Brownsea Island Ferries Ltd for service in Poole Harbour. She initially kept the name Hythe Hotspur but was later sold to Blue Funnel Cruises in 1997 and renamed Poole Scene. She sailed from Poole Quay until early 1998, when she returned to Southampton. In 1999, she was sold to Clyde Marine Services and renamed Cruiser. As such, she operated as a charter cruise vessel out of Greenock, cruising the Clyde. This included the weekday Rosneath ferry service from Gourock to Kilcreggan on behalf of SPT. From 1 June 2020, Calmac took over the service and chartered to operate it.

According to the CIA World Factbook, it comprises 18% of the total GDP and occupies 48% of the total labor force. Only 6.8% of the total land area is used for crop cultivation, but 44% of the land is used as pastures for livestock. Because of the many mountains of Kyrgyzstan, animal husbandry remains a significant part of the agricultural economy. Cultivation is centered in the Ferghana Valley, Talas Province, and Chuy Province. Among Kyrgyzstan's agricultural products are tobacco, cotton, potatoes, vegetables, grapes, fruits, and berries. As far as total production, the largest crop is assorted types of animal fodder to feed the livestock of the country. The second largest crop is winter wheat, followed by barley, corn, and rice. Significant animal derived products include sheep, goats, cattle, and wool. Chickens, horses, and pigs are also present. In some regions, yaks are herded and bred. Of these, the top products for export are cotton and tobacco. Meat is also exported, but in less significant quantities. However, the country has over 9 million hectares of pasture and a favourable environment for the development of animal husbandry. Recently Kyrgyzstan concluded accords to export meat to Saudi Arabia from September, 2012. Corruption in the Tobacco Industry In 2010, AOI-Kyrgyzstan, a Kyrgyz subsidiary of Alliance One International Inc., a global tobacco leaf merchant headquartered in North Carolina, United States, pleaded guilty to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), relating to bribes paid to Kyrgyzstan government officials in connection with its purchase of Kyrgyz tobacco. Alliance One was formed from a merger between Dimon Incorporated and Standard Commercial Corporation in 2005. AOI-Kyrgyzstan admitted that employees of Dimon‚Äôs Kyrgyz subsidiary paid a total of approximately US$3 million in bribes from 1996 to 2004 to various officials in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, including officials of the Kyrgyz Tamekisi, a government entity that controlled and regulated the tobacco industry in Kyrgyzstan. Bribes totalling US$254,262 were made to five local provincial government officials, known as \\"Akims\\", to obtain permission to purchase tobacco from local growers during the same period. There was also significant incidence of child labor in the tobacco industry. In fact, the 2013 U.S. Department of Labor report on the worst forms of child labor indicated that 4.5% of children aged 5 to 14 were engaged in such working conditions in tobacco cultivation, and that despite the availability of education, evidence suggested that \\"a limited number of schools required children to harvest tobacco on school grounds\\".The Kyrgyz Republic, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor Despite adopting an action plan for the National Program against Human Trafficking for 2013-2016, \\"interagency coordination on child labor continued to be poor\\", according to the report. More recently in December 2014, the Department's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor reported tobacco as a good still produced by Kyrgyz children, among others. To tobacco, the list added cotton, the cultivation of which was determined by national law as hazardous. Organic farming The organic movement began in Kyrgyzstan in 2004. At that time, 34 pioneer farmers were engaged in it. Today, Bio Farmer unites more than a thousand certified farmers and offers organic products such as cotton, sunflower seeds, beans, medical and aromatic plants, and dried apricots. According to experts, organic farming is most suitable to countries with generally small farms, cheap labor and a shortage of capital.

At the beginning of the 4th century BC the first pre-urban phase evolved into a second urban phase that lasted until the 1st century AD. It was located in the region of the Illyrian Dassaretii. The Illyrian Royal Tombs were built on this site during the 4th and 2nd centuries BC. The third and last phase of the site was less developed than the two previous phases. Archaeological remains of the first three centuries of the Common Era are the least representative of the site. The settlement continued being inhabited during the Roman Imperial period under Anastasius I and Justinian. The third phase lasted until the settlement was abandoned in late antiquity between the 4th and 6th centuries CE.

Found in woodland, it is a trailing or twining vine with leaves with several small 'teeth' on the margins and bright yellow flowers in early spring. It adapts readily to cultivation and can be grown as a pot plant. The species was first described in 1817. Taxonomy Hibbertia dentata was first formally described in 1817 in Regni Vegetabilis Systema Naturale of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle by the prolific botanist Robert Brown. The species name is the Latin adjective dentata \\"toothed\\", referring to the toothed leaf margins. George Bentham classified it in the series Hemihibbertiae based on flower anatomy, defining members of the group having glabrous carpels and numerous stamens. Description Hibbertia dentata grows as a twining vine, the stems of which can be up to in length, and trail over rocks and other shrubs. The dark green leaves are ovate, measuring long by wide., and sit on 1 cm long petioles. The apex of the leaf blade can be pointed or blunt, while the leaf margins are toothed. They can be purple-tinged and covered in fur when young and smooth upon reaching maturity. The flowers appear mainly from July to November. They arise from axillary buds or on the ends of short stems. They have five petals that are long each, and over 30 stamens. The flowers generally wither within a day or two. The fruit is mature over November to January, splitting to release the seeds. Distribution and habitat the vine trailing over rock in a shaded location Hibbertia dentata occurs in open forest or on the edge of rainforest along the east coast and hinterlands of New South Wales, extending into southeastern Queensland and eastern Victoria. Associated forest species in the Sydney region include mountain grey gum (Eucalyptus cypellocarpa), Sydney peppermint (E. piperita), messmate (E. obliqua), Sydney red gum (Angophora costata), turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera) and scrub species such as coastal tea tree (Leptospermum laevigatum). Within this habitat it is found on sheltered slopes in areas with good drainage, on clay-, shale- or sandstone-based soils that are high in nutrients. Ecology Hibbertia dentata can resprout after bushfire from its roots and flower within ten months. Seedlings have also been recorded in this time frame. The flowers are visited by European honeybees, native short-tongue bees of the families Halictidae and Colletidae, and large hoverflies of the genus Melangyna. Cultivation Although not often seen in cultivation, Hibbertia dentata is an easy plant to grow in the garden and more shade-tolerant than the widely cultivated H. scandens. Though fair drainage is required, the plant suffers if allowed to dry out and hence needs to be kept moist. It grows well as a pot plant. It was brought into cultivation in England in 1814. In 1817, it was described in the Loddiges periodical The Botanical Cabinet as being \\"a fine subject for planting out in a conservatory,\\". Propagation is relatively easy by cuttings of mature material, and seedlings may spontaneously arise in gardens where it is established.

Completed in 1744, it is the third oldest building at Harvard and one of the oldest college buildings in America. Early history In December 1741, Mrs. Samuel Holden, the widow of a former Governor of the Bank of England, offered Harvard a 400 pound sterling donation towards the construction of a chapel on campus, prompted by a suggestion from Thomas Hutchinson. After additional funds were raised, the chapel opened in March 1745. From 1744 to 1772 (except for 1767-68) the chapel housed morning and evening prayers for the Harvard student body, as well as providing space for some secular uses such as lectures. After the 1783 establishment of the Harvard Medical School, the building was used by its founder, John Warren, on a regular basis for 19 years, and intermittently by him and others thereafter until 1825. Holden Chapel detail. 20th/21st century In the 1930s, Holden Chapel (and Hollis Hall) were chosen by the Historical American Buildings Survey Commission as two of the finest examples of early Colonial architecture in Massachusetts For much of the 20th century, Holden Chapel housed the student offices of the Harvard Glee Club and later the Radcliffe Choral Society and the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, which collectively came to be known as the Holden Choirs. The chapel was remodeled in 1999 to serve as both a classroom and a musical rehearsal and performance space. Though no longer housing the Holden Choirs' offices, Holden Chapel now serves as their primary rehearsal space.

His work Histoire d'Ha√Øti (English: History of Haiti) is the first complete history of Haiti from 1492 to 1846 (Madiou's present). It is considered one of the most valuable documents of Haitian history and literature. Born in Port-au-Prince to \\"fairly affluent parents\\", Madiou left Haiti at the age ten to study in France at the Royal College of Angers (Coll√®ge Royal d'Angers). He later studied in Rennes, France and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Letters there. He then attended the Law School of Paris for two years before returning to Haiti. During his time in France, Madiou met Isaac Louverture, the son of Haiti's revolutionary hero Toussaint Louverture. This encounter supposedly sparked Madiou's interest in his country's past, and he returned to Haiti with the intention to write its history. Over a decade later, Madiou published three volumes covering Haiti's history from 1492 to 1807 with the Port-au-Prince publisher J. Courtois. A fourth volume (1843‚Äì46) appeared as part of Haiti's centennial in 1904. 150 years after the text's initial printing, the Haitian publishing house, Henri Deschamps, published the complete history, eight volumes spanning 1492 to 1846. In Histoire d'Ha√Øti, Madiou continued the work of earlier Haitian authors to combat racialized portrayals of Haiti's past, in particular the country's founding. He saw himself filling a crucial void by writing the first complete national history by a Haitian author. The history was valuable not only for Haitians but all members of the African Diaspora. To construct, his multi-volume history, Madiou relied heavily upon French written sources; however, he also recognized the importance of oral histories as a supplement to the written archive. He interviewed aging revolutionary veterans during his travels across the country with General Joseph Balthazar Inginac, the secretary-general for Haiti's longest serving nineteenth-century president, Jean-Pierre Boyer. His history tried to repair the reputation of the black leaders of the Haitian Revolution, especially Toussaint Louverture, portraying the struggle as a justified rebellion against the terrible oppression of slavery. This placed his work in contrast to the history written by Beaubrun Ardouin, appearing a few years after Madiou's, which tried to place the Haitian Revolution in the context of the other independence struggles in Latin America and deny it a class or racial character. Ardouin was trying to make Haiti fit into the community of nations in the Americas in the 1830s while Madiou was stressing what made Haiti unique. In addition to his writing, Madiou served in various government positions, including director of the national high school and minister plenipotentiary to Spain. He also worked as Director of Le Moniteur, the official government publication, and was a contributor to Haiti's small but vibrant press. References * Lescouflair, Arthur (1950).

California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to refuse counsel and represent themselves in state criminal proceedings.. Facts of the case The defendant Anthony Faretta was accused of grand theft in Los Angeles County, California. Well before the trial began, the defendant requested permission to represent himself. Questioning by the judge revealed that he had once represented himself in a criminal case and that he believed that the public defender's office was under a heavy case load. The judge warned him that he was making a mistake and emphasized that he would receive no special treatment. The judge entered a preliminary ruling allowing Faretta to represent himself, however stating that he might reverse his decision if it seemed that he was unable to adequately represent himself. Several weeks later, but still before the trial, the judge initiated a hearing to inquire into Faretta's ability to defend himself. After questioning him on numerous topics, including hearsay and juries, the judge ruled that his answers were inadequate and he had not made an intelligent decision to waive counsel. In addition he ruled that Faretta had no constitutional right to his own defense. Therefore, he rescinded his previous decision. During the trial the judge denied Faretta's motions to be co-counsel and other motions he attempted to make on his behalf. Subsequently, he was convicted by a jury and sentenced to life in prison. The California Court of Appeal, which relied on a recent California Supreme Court decision that had expressly decided the issue, ruled that Faretta had no federal or state right to represent himself. Appeal to the Supreme Court of California was denied. Opinion of the court In the opinion of the court by Justice Stewart, the Court held that a defendant in a state criminal trial has the constitutional right to refuse appointed counsel and conduct the trial when he or she voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so. However, such a defendant may not later complain that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court brought analogies to the Star Chamber, saying \\"the Star Chamber has, for centuries, symbolized disregard of basic individual rights. The Star Chamber not merely allowed, but required, defendants to have counsel. The defendant's answer to an indictment was not accepted unless it was signed by counsel. When counsel refused to sign the answer, for whatever reason, the defendant was considered to have confessed.\\"422 U.S. at 821-22. Dissents Justice Blackmun wrote a dissent where he questioned the additional procedural problems that would inevitably arise by the decision, arguing that such procedural problems would far outweigh whatever tactical advantage the defendant may feel he has gained by electing to represent himself. Blackmun concludes with the following: \\"If there is any truth to the old proverb 'one who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client,' the Court by its opinion today now bestows a constitutional right on one to make a fool of himself.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 422 * List of criminal competencies * Frendak v.

He was born in the early 1850s, and was the elder son of Joy Sankar Choudhuri of Teota. Teota zamindars were one of the well- known zamindars of Bengal. Their ancestral surname was Dasgupta (Dash-sharma). Parbati Sankar was an active member of the British Indian Association, the Indian Association, the Indian National Congress, and the Dacca district board. He was also one of the founders of the Indian Industrial Association, which was set up to promote the material and economic development of the region. As part of the economic reconstruction programme, Parbati Sankar attempted to make use of the material raw resources available within the Teota zamindari (in Goalondo, Faridpur and elsewhere). His name is also associated with the formulation of a concrete and detailed plan (1890s) of extension of the railways to Manikganj, linking it up with the town of Dacca on the east and the river port of Goalando on the west. Parbati Sankar is best remembered, however, for pioneering the 'dharmagola' system of co-operative grain banking, intended to alleviate scarcity and resulting famine. 'Dharmagolas' or grain banks were established at various places within the Teota Estate and elsewhere in Dinajpur and the system was a success. These grain banks were registered as formal co-operative societies in the second decade of the 20th century. Parbati Sankar wrote a number of articles in which he not only outlined the basic features of the 'dharmagola' system, but also clearly brought out its many virtues and advantages. He spoke on the \\"Indebtedness of the Bengal peasantry\\" at an annual session of the Congress (INC) in the early 1900s. Parbati Sankar Rai was honoured with the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in 1912.

This verse discusses the husband's role as \\"protector and maintainer\\" of his wife and how he should deal with disloyalty on her part. Scholars vastly differ on the implications of this verse, with many Muslims arguing that it serves as a deterrent from anger- based domestic violence.  English translations  Marmaduke Pickthall: Muhammad Taqi Usmani Abdullah Yusuf Ali: Sahih International, at Quran.com: Ahmad Shafaat: Muhsin Khan, at Quran.com: Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri: Laleh Bakhtiar, PhD: Maulvi Sher Ali on behalf of the Ahmadiyya religion: = Verse = = Transliteration =  Verses in context   Background of the verse  There are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent. Some Muslims, such as Islamic feminist groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence. In the Prophet's farewell sermon as recorded in al-Tabari's History,al-Tabari, History of Al-Tabari, Vol. IX: The Last Years of the Prophet tr. Poonawala, I.K. (Albany, NY, 1990) pp. 112-113 and in a Sahih Hadith collected by Abu Dawud,sunnah.com Sunan Abu Dawud 10:1900 he gave permission husbands to hit their wives under certain circumstances without severity (ŸÅŸéÿßÿ∂Ÿíÿ±Ÿêÿ®ŸèŸàŸáŸèŸÜŸéŸë ÿ∂Ÿéÿ±Ÿíÿ®Ÿãÿß ÿ∫ŸéŸäŸíÿ±Ÿé ŸÖŸèÿ®Ÿéÿ±ŸêŸëÿ≠Ÿç fadribuhunna darban ghayra mubarrih; literal translation: \\"... then beat them, a beating without severity\\") When Ibn Abbas the cousin and companion of the prophet Ibn Abbas replied back: ‚ÄúI asked Ibn Abbas: ‚ÄòWhat is the hitting that is 'without severity'?‚Äô He replied [with] the siwak (tooth-stick) and the like‚Äô. Muhammad himself never hit a woman and forbade beating one's wife or striking her face.Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2137 cited in Philips, A.A.B. & Jones, J. Polygamy in Islam 2nd edition. International Islamic Publish House (Riyad, 2005) p.25 Another hadith narration of the Farewell Sermon appears in Sunan Ibn Majah. The Arabic phrase mentioned above is here translated, \\"hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark.\\" There have been several fatwas against domestic violence. Feminist writers have argued that society during Quranic times differed from modern times, especially in how children were reared and raised, creating a need for gender roles. However, these scholars highlight that the Qur'an can be interpreted differently as society changes. Jonathan A.C. Brown gives the wider scholarly tendency when it comes to the verse: The first part of the verse about men having authority over women is meant for obedience towards God, not the husband. =Background on the roles of men and women in Islam= The Qur'an states that men are the guardians of women, and thus responsible for earning livelihood for the family and female relatives. Women, however, are given a degree of autonomy over their own income and property, provided this autonomy is exercised in a way that is agreeable to the wishes of the husband, provided his wishes not be in violation of Islamic principles.Iman Hashim, Reconciling Islam and feminism, Gender & Development, 1999, vol. 7, issue 1, p 7, Nevertheless, they are responsible for educating the children, as God has given the one preference over the other. Man is also considered to be the head of the family.Amin Ahsan Islahi, Tadabbur-i-Qur'an, 2nd ed., vol. 2, (Lahore: Faran Foundation, 1986), p. 278 The Qur'an recommends that wives be obedient and adaptable to their husbands. Wives should also keep the secrets of their husbands and protect their honor and integrity. Islamic scholars consider this important in running a smooth family system.Javed Ahmed Ghamidi, Mizan, Chapter:The Social Law of Islam For both men and women, zulm- known in English as actions of 'cruelty' against someone- is explicitly prohibited. Equality of genders throughout the Qur'an The equality of men and women is discussed in many places throughout the text. The Quran blamed Adam and Eve for the original sin as Satan talks to both of them. The Qur'an is also very specific that both men and women should receive equal punishment for wrongdoings (24:2), and that both men and women are seen as equals under God, and will be rewarded for their faith by entering Heaven (4:124). Male and female relationships in the times of the Prophet In her book Qur'an and Women, scholar Amina Wadud writes about the importance of women in the time of the Prophet. During this time, women did not have access to the technology that women today have; giving birth and raising children was much more difficult due to diseases and lack of healthcare knowledge. For this reason, Wadud writes, \\"The Qur'an establishes his [the husband's] responsibility as qiwamah: seeing to it that the women is not burdened with additional responsibilities which jeopardize that primary demanding responsibility only she can fulfill.\\" The need to reproduce and raise children contributed to the importance of gender roles in the time of the Prophet. Scholar Ayesha Chaudhry writes that many Muslims have this fundamentally flawed way of examining the text, writing that \\"Despite the potential for such verses [4:34] to have multiple plain-sense meanings, living Muslim communities place these interpretations in conversation with the pre-colonial Islamic tradition\\". Examples from the Prophet The late Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Hussein Tabataba'i (1903-1981 AD) provides the following exegesis on 4:34 from both Sunni and Shi'ite sources in his Mizan: > Ibn Abi Hatim has narrated through Ash‚Äôath ibn ‚ÄòAbdil-Malik from al-Hasan > that he said: ‚ÄúA woman came to the Prophet complaining against her husband > that he had slapped her. The Messenger of Allah said: ‚ÄúRetribution‚Äù. Then > Allah revealed the verse, ‚ÄúMen are maintainers of women‚Ä¶ (4:34); so the > woman returned without retribution [ad-Durr 'l-munthur, as-Suyuti]. [as- > Suyuti] has narrated it from the Prophet through other chains too. Some of > them say that the Messenger of Allah said: ‚ÄúI wanted one thing > (retribution), but Allah decided otherwise\\"...there were some instances > where Allah had amended some prophetic orders by adding to or deleting from > it, but it was only in his administrative order, not in matters of the law > ordained by him for his people, otherwise it would have been an invalid > nullification...the Messenger of Allah used to wonder aloud: \\"How can you > embrace the woman with a hand you had hit her with?\\". It is narrated also in > al-Kafi through his chain from Abu Maryam from Abu Ja‚Äôfar (Imam Muhammad al- > Baqir) that he said: ‚ÄúThe Messenger of Allah said: ‚ÄúWhat! Does one of you > hit his wife, and then attempt to embrace her?\\". Countless such statements > are found in the traditions; and one may understand from them the Islamic > views on this subject.Tafsir al-Mizan, by al-Allamah as-Sayyid Muhammad > Husayn at-Tabataba-i, translated by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi. V. 8, > p.217,220 Al-Tabari (839-923 AD) wrote that, \\"The Prophet never raised his hand against one of his wives, or against a slave, nor against any person at all.\\" In fact, when the Prophet faced rebellion of his wives, rather than beat them, Al- Tabari accounts that he instead, \\"stayed away from his wives for 29 nights.\\" Debates and discussion about the text In response to nush√ªz, admonishment, leaving wives in their beds and idribihunna are permitted. Islamic scholars agree such actions can not be undertaken for any reason other than those mentioned in the Qur'an (see nush√ªz).Saleem Shahzad, Can a Husband force his Wife to wear the Hijab? , Renaissance - Monthly Islamic Journal, 11(11), November 2001. =Authority of men and its reasons= This allots men authority over women due to following reasons: 1: Because God has given some more strength than others. 2: Because men spent from their property to support women i.e., clothing, residence, and sustenance. The word qawwamun is also used at Al-Quran 4:134. Here it is said that believers should be Qawwamun with fairness. Men are responsible of maintenance of women The reason men being qawwamun over women is that because men are responsible of earning for women. =Characters of pious women= The verse declares that pious women are: 1: Obedient 2: Guarding the unseen as God prescribes. Obedient or Qanitat The verse commands women to be qanitat. The term has been used in to refer to men and women alike, who are obedient to God. Some commentators use the term to mean obedience to the husband, while others assert that it means obedience to God. Some scholars agree that the husband does not have absolute control over his wife, and her first loyalty is to God. Guarding the unseen Hafizat is derived from hafaz meaning to guard. The subjective form is hafiz meaning a person who guards and hafizah meaning she who guards (feminine). Hafizat is plural of hafizah (both being feminine). It means that good women guard themselves in the absence of Husband as God prescribes. =Rebellious women and advice= And those whose rebellion (nush√ªz) is feared. It is advised 1: to admonish them 2: to leave them alone in beds 3: to beat them * the term \\"nush√ªz\\" (ŸÜŸèÿ¥ŸèŸàÿ≤) is translated as \\"disloyalty and ill- conduct\\" by Yusuf Ali, \\"rebellion\\" by Pickthall and \\"desertion\\" by Shakir. Other scholars have drawn on hadiths to interpret the meaning of the word. to admonish them  The first response to nushuz is wƒÅ'z (‚ÄòŸàŸéÿπŸéÿ∏‚Äô), meaning to first admonish or scold the wife of her behaviour. There is strong agreement amongst Muslim scholars that this admonishment must be conducted in a spirit of reconciliation. to leave them alone in beds  According to tafsir ibn kathir, a well known commentary of Quran. He describes in his exegesis. Should the nushuz continue, the next step is to refuse to share the bed with the wife. Again Muslim scholars emphasize on the spirit of healing while conducting this action. to beat them (i·∏çrib≈´hunna) There are a number of translations of the original Arabic 4:34. Some translations include the adverb (lightly) or (mildly) though this word does not appear in the Arabic text. The term i·∏çrib≈´hunna (usually translated, 'beat them') in 4:34 is the imperative form of the phrase ·∏çaraba (Arabic: ÿ∂ÿ±ÿ® 'to beat, beat, smote, or strike').ÿ∂ÿ±ÿ® defined in Lane, E.W. (1863-93) An Arabic English Lexicon Reprinted in Beirut: Librarie du Liban, 1968, p.1777 View on studyquran.org Scholars interpret i·∏çrib≈´hunna in different ways. Whereas many interpret it to mean \\"to strike\\", others hold that the term means \\"to separate\\". Such an action is to be administered only if neither the husband nor the wife are willing to divorce. The term daraba is translated by Yusuf Ali as \\"beat,\\" but the Arabic word is used elsewhere in the Qur'an to convey different meanings. The phrase, \\"Daraba Allah mathalan\\" translates to, \\"Allah gives or sets an example.\\" The use of this word might be compared to the way \\"to strike\\" is used in English, which can mean, \\"to strike a pose,\\" or \\"to strike a bargain,\\" not just referring to the physical act of hitting something. The use of daraba is also intentional, because a different Arabic word exists, \\"daraba\\" which is translated to, \\"to strike repeatedly or intensely.\\" Muslim scholars who permit hitting, emphasize that it must not be harsh,Ahmad Shafaat, Tafseer of Surah an-Nisa, Ayah 34 , Islamic Perspectives. August 10, 2005Ibn Kathir Ad- Damishqee records in his Tafsir Al-Qur'an Al-Azim that \\"Ibn \`Abbas and several others said that the Ayah refers to a beating that is not violent. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that it means, a beating that is not severe.\\" but rather light.Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Ibn Kathir\\"The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary\\", Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Amana Corporation, Brentwood, MD, 1989. , passage was quoted from commentary on 4:34Kathir, Ibn, ‚ÄúTafsir of Ibn Kathir‚Äù, Al-Firdous Ltd., London, 2000, 50-53M.A.S Abdel Haleem Understanding the Qur'an 46-54 Muslim men are never to hit their spouse's face, nor to hit them in such a way as would leave marks on their body. Scholars suggest that the response administered should be in proportion to the fault committed.\\"Towards Understanding the Qur'an\\" Translation by Zafar I. Ansari from \\"Tafheem Al- Qur'an\\" by Syed Abul-A'ala Mawdudi, Islamic Foundation, Leicester, England. Passage was quoted from commentary on 4:34. Traditionally the idea of beating was \\"with a toothbrush\\"Muhammad Asad, The Message of the Qur'an (his translation of the Qur'an), citing Tabari who \\"quot[es] the views of scholars of the earliest times.\\"The concept of a beating with a toothbrush comes from Muhammad's statement to a disobedient maid-servant that \\"If it were not for the fear of retaliation on the Day of Resurrection, I would have beaten you with this miswak (tooth-cleaning twig)\\" [as reported by Ibn Majah, by Ibn Hibban in his Sahih, and by Ibn Sa\`d in his Tabaqat]. Cited by Yusuf al- Qaradawi, head of the European Council for Fatwa and Research at or \\"with a folded handkerchief.\\"Muhammad Asad, The Message of the Qur'an (his translation of the Qur'an), commentary to 4:34, citing Razi. Jonathan A.C. Brown resumes the situation: > If a wife exhibited egregious disobedience (nushuz) such as > uncharacteristically insulting behavior, leaving the house against the > husband's will and without a valid excuse or denying her husband sex > (without medical grounds), the husband should first admonish her to be > conscious of God and proper etiquette. If she did not desist from her > behavior, he should cease sleeping with her in their bed. If she still > continued in her nushuz, he should then strike her to teach her the error of > her ways. Shaffii law only allowed the husband to use his hand or a wound-up > handkerchief (mina malfuf), not a whip or stick. All schools of law > prohibited striking the wife in the face or in any sensitive area likely to > cause injury. All except some Maliki jurists held that the wife could claim > compensation payment (diya) from the husband for any injury she sustained, > and Hanbalis, the later Shaffii school as well as the Maliki school, allowed > a judge to dissolve the marriage at no cost to the wife if harm had been > done. In effect, any physical harm was grounds for compensation and divorce > since the Prophet had limited striking one's wife to 'a light blow that > leaves no mark.' Causing any injury thus meant that a husband had exceeded > his rights. All schools of law agreed that if the wife died due to a > beating, her family could claim her wergild or possibly even have the > husband executed.Jonathan A.C. Brown, Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and > Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy, Oneworld Publications (2014), > pp. 276-277 Many jurists interpret i·∏çrib≈´hunna as \\"more or less symbolic.\\"Muhammad Asad, The Message of the Qur'an (his translation of the Qur'an).One such authority is the earliest hafiz, Ibn Abbas. Others, however, argue that a mere symbolic administration would be pointless and rather should be an \\"energetic demonstration\\" of the love of the husband. But it is agreed that the demonstration should not seriously hurt the wife. The 2007 translation The Sublime Quran by Laleh Bakhtiar translates i·∏çrib≈´hunna not as 'beat them' but as 'go away from them'. The introduction to her translation discusses the linguistic and shari‚Äòah reasons in Arabic for understanding this verb in context. The Prophet never beat his wives, and his example from the Sunnah informs the interpretation of this verse. This interpretation is supported by the fact that some other verses, such as 4:101 which contains word darabtum (derivation from daraba), demonstrate also the interpretation of Arabic word daraba to have meaning 'going' or 'moving'. The Islamic scholar Tahir-ul-Qadri has given the same translation in his translation of the Quran \\"Irfan-ul- Quran\\": \\"(...)and (if they still do not improve) turn away from them, striking a temporary parting.(...)\\". This translation is further supported by the fact that the word \\"darabtum\\" is used in the same chapter (specifically, in ), which means to \\"go abroad\\" in the sake of Allah and which is derived from the same root word (\\"daraba\\") as \\"idribuhunna\\" in 4:34.Osama Abdallah. Systematic comparison with 4:94 Islamawareness.net The book Woman in the Shade of Islam by Saudi scholar Abdul Rahman al-Sheha stated that a man may \\"beat\\" his wife only if it occurs without \\"hurting, breaking a bone, leaving blue or black marks on the body and avoiding hitting the face, at any cost.\\" A widely used 1930 English translation of the Quran by British Muslim scholar Marmaduke Pickthall determined the verse to mean that, as a last resort, men can \\"scourge\\" their wives. Some jurists argue that even when hitting is acceptable under the Qur'an, it is still discountenanced.Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi comments that \\"Whenever the Prophet (peace be on him) permitted a man to administer corporal punishment to his wife, he did so with reluctance, and continued to express his distaste for it. And even in cases where it is necessary, the Prophet (peace be on him) directed men not to hit across the face, nor to beat severely nor to use anything that might leave marks on the body.\\" \\"Towards Understanding the Qur'an\\" Translation by Zafar I. Ansari from \\"Tafheem Al- Qur'an\\" (specifically, commentary on 4:34) by Syed Abul-A'ala Mawdudi, Islamic Foundation, Leicester, England.The medieval jurist ash-Shafi'i, founder of one of the main schools of fiqh, commented on this verse that \\"hitting is permitted, but not hitting is preferable.\\"\\"[S]ome of the greatest Muslim scholars (e.g., Ash-Shafi'i) are of the opinion that it is just barely permissible, and should preferably be avoided: and they justify this opinion by the Prophet's personal feelings with regard to this problem.\\" Muhammad Asad, The Message of the Qur'an (his translation of the Qur'an). In his book No god but God, University of Southern California scholar Reza Aslan, stated that false interpretations of the text have occurred because Quranic commentary \\"has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men.\\" The Islamic prophet Mohammed himself, according to Islamic tradition, never once struck a woman in argument. This fact is sometimes cited in debates about the text. Muslim feminist writer Asra Q. Nomani has argued, Feminist writer Amina Wadud writes in her book, Inside the Gender Jihad: Women's Reform in Islam: Ibn Ishaq has said that Muhammad in his The Farewell Sermon said that: Nada Ibrahim of the University of South Australia states that three words‚Äîqawwamuna, nushuzahunna, and wadribuhunna‚Äîare mistranslated due to the lack of equivalent English alternatives. She explains that in particular, English language Qur'an commentators have not agreed to merely one translation of the word wadribuhunna and that \\"A clear disagreement exists among English-language Qur‚Äôan commentators on how best to translate this word. All translations give an explicit negative connotation, and ‚Äì when read out of context ‚Äì further exacerbates any misunderstanding.\\" One explanation of this verse is given in the 'interpretation' (Tafsir) of Ibn Kathir, a scholar of the Mamluk era: = When they obey = In the Quran‚Äôs Commentary exegesis of this part of verse is as following:  1: Not to seek ways against them  In this part of verse God says that if women obey then man are not allowed to make excuses against them. = Glorification of God = Ibn Kathir in the commentary of this part of verse says  1: Exalted  It means that God is exalted.  2: Great  It means that God is great.

It was the first attempt to codify the laws of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The code prescribed punishment for property crimes and limited court procedures. Much of the legal system was left uncodified and was governed by customs. Context The date or the circumstances when the code was adopted are unknown. The historians conjured that the most probable date is February 1468 when the Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania met in Vilnius. The code differed from privileges previously issued by the Grand Duke because the code granted no new rights to the nobility. Judging from the content, the code was intended for the nobility and landowners, who received Casimir's privilege in 1447 to try veldamai, a class of dependent people that eventually became serfs. The code attempted to impose some consistency in the treatment of veldamai. The document also did not specify the effective date or territory. Historians believe that the code was in effect in entire Lithuania up to the first Statute of Lithuania of 1529 even though no court cases are known that referenced the code. Written in the Ruthenian language, the original document did not survive, but several copies are known from the end of 15th and beginning of the 16th centuries. The document was first published in 1826 by Ignacy Dani≈Çowicz, law professor at Vilnius University. The document did not have a proper name and was named Casimir's Code or Casimir's Statute by modern historians. The original code was not divided into articles; modern historians have identified 25 articles. Content The code prescribed various punishments for crimes and some court procedures. It dealt only with crimes against property (theft and robbery). The code primarily dealt with common thieves, but also addressed crimes by the Lithuanian nobility (such as cutting forest trees without permission or luring away veldamai from another noble). The nobility was to be tried and sentenced by the Grand Duke and the Council of Lords. Civil disputes between nobles were to be decided by the third-party judges. Peasants dependent on the Grand Duke were to be tried by tij≈´nai (high-ranking supervisors of royal estates), while those dependent on other dukes and nobles ‚Äì by the nobles themselves or their appointed officials. A criminal first had to compensate the victim for the material losses (the stolen object was usually not returned to the victim, but transferred to the court). The code devoted special attention to this issue. Then criminal was subject to the actual punishment. There were four types of punishments: the stolen object was confiscated for the benefit of the court; if the object was not available, it was replaced by other compensation of equal value; flogging and putting into stocks; hanging. The death sentence was limited to repeated offenders, thefts of cows and horses, and other crimes that exceeded a certain monetary limit. The responsibility for the crimes did not extend to family members unless they knew or participated in the theft.

His instruments are masterfully constructed. His violins are inspired by Nicol√≤ Amati's \\"Grand Amati\\" pattern. Francesco was the first to develop a smaller cello design, which has become the standard for modern cello dimensions. Today, Rugeri's instruments are nearly as renowned as Nicol√≤ Amati's instruments.  Apprenticeship  He was perhaps the earliest apprentice of Nicol√≤ Amati, another important luthier in Cremona Italy, although other sources call this association into question as there is no census record showing his presence in the Amati household. The lack of census records showing the Rugeri name may be explained by the possibility of Francesco not being an indoor apprentice, but one who lived and boarded at his own home while apprenticing. Antonio Stradivari's name never appears in the census records of the Amati household even though he was also a possible pupil of Nicol√≤ Amati and may have lived and boarded with his own family. W.E. Hill & Sons note that the \\"unmistakable\\" handiwork of Francesco Rugeri can be found, in certain of Nicolo Amati's works, and just like Antonio Stradivari and Andrea Guarneri, Francesco from time to time included the words \\"Alumnus Nicolai Amati\\" on his labels, further adding to the evidence of his apprenticeship. For example, there exists a violin labelled \\"Francescus Rugerius Alumnus Nicolai Amati fecit Cremon√¶ 1663\\". Nicol√≤ Amati was the godfather to one of Francesco's sons, Giacinto (born in 1658 and lived only a few months), indicating that the two families at least shared a close relationship and close collaboration would seem likely. Francesco later had another son whom he also named Giacinto, who was born in 1661. Interestingly, there was a court case brought in 1685 by a violinist who sought relief from the Duke of Modena as a victim of fraud. In this case, the violinist and composer Tomaso Antonio Vitali, bought a violin purporting to be a creation of Nicol√≤ Amati. Yet under the Amati label was the label of Francesco Rugeri. There was a price difference in those days of 3 to 1 on Amati vs. Rugeri violins, so this was a serious matter. However, this case may also indicate that Rugeri, who was working in the shadow of the great Cremona makers--Amati, Guarneri, and Stradivari--resorted to a desperate act to make a sale. Some researchers believe there is a closer educational association between Antonio Stradivari and Francesco Rugeri than has previously been recognized. Despite the long-held belief that Antonio Stradivari was the pupil of Nicol√≤ Amati, there are important discrepancies between their work. Some researchers believe early instruments by Stradivari bear a stronger resemblance to Francesco Rugeri's work than Amati's. Additionally, the utilization of a small dorsal pin or small hole, invariably used not just by Nicol√≤ Amati but all of his recognized pupils‚Äîwith the exception of Antonio Stradivari, adds further evidence that Stradivari may have learnt his craft apart from Amati. This pin or hole was fundamental in the graduation of the thickness of the plates and was obviously a technique passed on through generations of pupils of the Amati. This dorsal pin is also not found in any of the instruments of the Rugeri family, suggesting Antonio Stradivari may have actually learnt his craft from Francesco Rugeri, although both being influenced by Amati.Carlo Bergonzi: Alla scoperta di un grande Maestro by By Christopher Reuning W.E. Hill & Sons concede that they fail to find the hand of Stradivari in any of Nicolo Amati's work, although the unmistakable hands of Andrea Guarneri and Francesco Rugeri are evident. Count Ignazio Alessandro Cozio di Salabue and other early violin connoisseurs such as the Mantegazza brothers seemed to confuse the families of the Rugeri working in Cremona with the family of Giovanni Battista Rogeri working in Brecia. These two separate families of violin makers both followed the Amati tradition of violin making however their work is distinctive from each other are not thought to be related. The Rugeri family included the words \\"il Per\\" or \\"detto il Per\\" in their labels. This nickname appears also in almost all of the religious and legal documents pertaining to the Rugeri family from 1669 onward and was probably meant to distinguish them from the many other Rugeri families in the region. Career Francesco lived and worked just outside of the walls of Cremona, Italy in the Parishes of San Bernardo at No. 7 Contrada Coltellai and later by 1687 in the Parish of San Sebastiano https://tarisio.com/cozio-archive/browse-the- archive/makers/maker/?Maker_ID=636 In San Sebastiano he lived next to the convent of San Sigismondo, one of the finest buildings in Cremona. His most productive period was during the 1670s‚Äì1680s during which time he was assisted by his 3 sons and closely followed the instruments of Nicol√≤ Amati, sometimes even placing Amati labels in his instruments. His success peaked after Nicol√≤ Amati's decline and before the rise of the workshop of Antonio Stradivari. Francesco's violins were characterized by a high level of craftsmanship and a very slightly higher arch. After 1670, Francesco was ably assisted by 3 of his sons in his workshop. The Rugeri tradition was carried on and developed by Francesco's son, Vincenzo Rugeri, who was the only of his sons to later have an independent successful career as a luthier. Some instruments purported to be by Francesco are actually the work of Vincenzo. Instruments created by Rugeri are highly desirable owing to their high level of craftsmanship and tone. Francesco was buried in the Church of San Trinita. = Cello size pioneer = Francesco Rugeri was the first to make an important contribution to cello making in the development of a smaller version of the cello that is now the standard. His cello is smaller from the cellos made by other Cremonese luthiers of the same period, namely, Amati and Stradivari. Cellos made by other luthiers of the period are often quite massive and fairly unmanageable for modern players' usage unless severely cut down in size. = Casa Rugeri = Francesco is the founder of the Rugeri family of violin makers. Francesco married Ippolito Ravasi in 1652 in the Church of San Bernardo. They had a total of 10 children (six sons and 4 daughters) although some died young. Three of his six sons followed his footsteps in string instruments making. Interestingly, Francesco had two sons he named Giacinto‚Äîthe first was born in 1658 and baptized Nov 19th 1658 with Nicol√≤ Amati being the Godfather. Unfortunately, Giacinto only lived a few months following his baptism. The fact that Amati was his Godfather demonstrates that Rugeri and Amati at least shared a close relationship. Francesco's son, Vincenzo, became the most important luthier of Francesco's sons and carried on the Rugeri tradition after Francesco's death. Other luthiers in the family are: *Giovanni Battista Rugeri ( 2 July 1653; 14 Dec 1711) was the eldest son of Francesco Rugeri. He married in 1677 and moved briefly to another Parish, however returned to San Bernardo to presumably continue work in Francesco's shop. Although a capable luthier, his independent work is extremely rare. Hieronymus Amati II, son of Nicol√≤ Amati, was a Godfather to one of Giovanni Battista's son's. *Giacinto Rugeri ( 15 May 1661; 2 June 1697) was the second son of Francesco Rugeri and was also a capable worker in his father's shop. Like Giovanni Battista, his independent work is extremely rare. Giacinto had a son, Antonio, who is recorded as a luthier, however his work is unknown. *Vincenzo Rugeri ( 30 September 1663; 4 May 1719) was the third, and most well known son of Francesco Rugeri. Vincenzo enjoyed considerable fortune as an independent violin maker and was possibly the finest craftsman of the family. His violins advanced upon the models of his father, retaining the Grand Amati form but adapting a flatter arch inspired by Stradivari. The overall quality of his instruments is exceptional and deserve to be ranked at least as high as those of his more famous father. Vincenzo's instruments, together with Francesco's, are the most sought after of the family. Vincenzo was the first teacher of Carlo Bergonzi (luthier). *Carlo Rugeri ( 1666; 1713) He was Francesco's youngest son. Although he inherited all of Francesco's tools relating to the making of \\"violins, guitars, violoni and calascioni'\\" as indicated in Francesco's codicil, Carlo does not appear to have been involved significantly with the family's violin shop and may have pursued another vocation based upon the almost non-existent examples of his work.

It was founded in 1931. The \\"Verbond\\" claims a membership of some 3,700, spread in ten different congregations throughout the country. The biggest one is the congregation in Amsterdam, with some 1,700 members. Other congregations exist in The Hague, Rotterdam, Utrecht, Arnhem (LJG Gelderland), Tilburg (LJG Brabant), Enschede (LJG Twente), Heerenveen, Zuidlaren (LJG Noord-Nederland) and Almere (LJG Flevoland). The NVPJ's rabbis are: Menno ten Brink, David Lilienthal, Awraham Soetendorp, Edward van Voolen, Marianne van Praag, Tamara Benima and Albert Ringer. It publishes its own magazine six times a year, Levend Joods Geloof (lit. Living Jewish Faith). The Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom has separate organisations for women (FLJVN) and youngsters (Netzer Holland); there is also a separate Zionist organisation based on Progressive Jewish grounds, ARZA.

History Progressive Judaism was brought to the Netherlands in the 1930s by German immigrants, many of them fleeing Nazi persecution. The first Progressive rabbi in the Netherlands was Meir L. Lasker, followed by German-born Rabbi Norden. The first congregation was founded in 1931 in The Hague, in the same year followed by one in Amsterdam. The congregations grew rapidly throughout the years, mostly because of the arrival of thousands of German Jews (of whom most were part of the Reform tradition). On 18 October 1931,Dan Mikhman, Het liberale Jodendom in Nederland 1929-1943, Van Gennep, 1988. p. 164. the Verbond van Liberaal-Godsdienstige Joden (lit. Union for Liberal-Religious Jews) was founded. Services were held regularly, and the Union published its own paper, Nieuw Joods Leven (lit. New Jewish Life). At the eve of World War II, the Amsterdam community alone had some 900 members; ten years earlier, Progressive Judaism had virtually been non-existent in the Netherlands ‚Äì the religious landscape was limited to Ashkenazi Orthodox Judaism and a smaller community of Sephardi Jews. The Holocaust World War II saw the destruction of most of Jewish life in the Netherlands during the Holocaust; more than 75% of Dutch Jews were killed by the Nazis. But the community was vibrant, and small initiatives were started in the years after the Second World War to revitalize Jewish life again, although this was hard in a country where the Jewish community had diminished from more than 140,000 in 1940 to a mere 25,000 in the 1950s. A new Liberal community was started in Amsterdam in 1946; the community had some 50 members, only a fraction of the 900 six years earlier. 1945‚Äì2006 It was not until the 1960s that Progressive Judaism started to grow once again in the Netherlands. Much of its success was related to the hard work of Rabbi Jacob Soetendorp, rabbi for the Liberal community in Amsterdam since 1954. Because of his hard work, new communities started to spring up again within the Jewish Netherlands ‚Äì sometimes much to the disagreement of the Orthodox Jewish community in the Netherlands, combined in the Nederlands Isra√´litisch Kerkgenootschap, which, until this day, does not fully recognize the Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom. The 1990s and the first years of the 21st century saw a new impulse to Progressive Judaism in the Netherlands with the establishment of three new communities: one in Utrecht in 1993; one in Heerenveen (Beth Hatsafon) in 2000; and one in Almere (Beth B'nei Jonah) in 2003. Levisson Instituut The Levisson Instituut was founded in 2002 with the aim to provide rabbinical training for Dutch Jewish students affiliated with the NVPJ. The institute is based on the premises of the University of Amsterdam and receives educational assistance from the Leo Baeck College in London, amongst others. Currently, seven students are training at the Institute and are providing liturgical and pastoral support within the Liberal communities. Dean of Studies is Swedish-born Rabbi David Lilienthal.

Although a community was established already in 1931 (the first Progressive Jewish congregation in the country), the Second World War meant a devastating blow to the community and it was not until 1962 before the community was re-established again with the finding of a new shelter in the Stadhouderslaan (the community was already informally re- established in the 1950s, but had no place for worship). In the years following however, plans were made to use the old Sephardic synagogue in The Hague (the Snoge) as a new shelter for the community. During the Second World War the Sephardic community in The Hague was completely destroyed, leaving the synagogue empty after the War. Eventually, on September 3, 1973, plans became reality when the synagogue was inaugurated as the new place of worship for the Liberal community in the presence of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. Rabbi for the community is Marianne van Praag. * LJG Gelderland, Kehillath Adath Jesjoeroen: more than 70 families are members of this congregation; rabbi for the community is Marianne van Praag.

Work Art as a means of expression and a living symbol of life inspires Dhruva Mistry as he explores drawing, painting, etching, dry point, digital works, photography, clay, plaster, cast stone, talc, chalk, wood, stone, lead, brass, bronze, aluminum, fiberglass, mild and stainless steel for three-dimensional forms in space. His art presents dialogue of an artist as a maker pursuing enigma of an omnipresent consciousness. Mistry‚Äôs work reflects individual curiosity and personal interest. His works in the round offer perambulatory experience of life of forms. He is among a handful of artists working with scale and quality of forms, concepts and materials. Like ever-evolving scope of a language, his ponderings reflect plurality of not just visual ideas but cultural concepts. Mistry finds inspiration from civilizations and cultures be it Indian, Chinese, Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek, European Mayan, Oceanic, African, tribal, folk, old, new and modern.

Richard Garrett & Sons was a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, steam engines and trolleybuses. Their factory was Leiston Works, in Leiston, Suffolk, England. The company was founded by Richard Garrett in 1778. The company was active under its original ownership between 1778 and 1932. In the late 1840s, after cultivating a successful agricultural machine and implement business, the company began producing portable steam engines. The company grew to a major business employing around 2,500 people. Richard Garrett III, grandson of the company's founder, visited The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, where he saw some new American manufacturing ideas. Richard Garrett III introduced flow line production ‚Äì a very early assembly line - and constructed a new workshop for the purpose in 1852. This was known as 'The Long Shop' on account of its length. A machine would start at one end of the Long Shop and as it progressed through the building it would stop at various stages where new parts would be added. There was also an upper level where other parts were made; they would be lowered over a balcony and then fixed onto the machine on the ground level. When the machine reached the end of the shop, it would be complete. In 1914, following a major fire at the works, it was decided to build a new factory on land that had been owned as a demonstration farm next to the station. From then on the sites were always known as the \\"Old Works\\" and the \\"New Works\\". The company joined the Agricultural & General Engineers (AGE) combine in 1919, and the combine entered receivership in 1932. The company was purchased by Beyer Peacock in 1932 after the collapse of AGE. The business continued as Richard Garrett Engineering Works until the works finally closed in 1981. Today, part of the old works is preserved as the Long Shop Museum. Some of the offices are used as flats but the rest of that site has been demolished and the land used for housing. Some of the New Works is still used as industrial units while the offices have been converted to flats and more built on the site, known as Colonial House. Products =Portable engines= The majority of the steam engines produced by Garrett were portable engines ‚Äì combined with their fixed steam engines and semi-portables, they represented 89% of the works' output. =Traction engines= showman's tractor 31193, built 1913 Garrett produced a wide range of traction engines and ploughing engines, 49% of which were exported. =Steam rollers= The construction of steam rollers was generally apportioned to Aveling & Porter by the AGE combine, limiting the production of these engines by Garrett. 90% of the rollers produced by Garrett were exported. Garrett rollers were produced under licence under the name \\"Ansaldo- Garrett\\" by Gio. Ansaldo & C. of Italy. =Steam tractors= Richard Garrett and Sons are perhaps best known for their steam tractors, the most popular design of which was the Number 4 compound tractor, commonly referred to as the \\"4CD\\". =Steam wagons= Garrett Six Wheeled tipping wagon 35464 of 1931 The company produced steam wagons of both the undertype and overtype configurations. Their first steam wagons were three relatively unsuccessful undertypes constructed between 1904 and 1908. The failed undertype wagons were followed by a relatively successful line of overtypes, the first being constructed in 1909. These wagons were developed using the experience Garrett's designers had gained producing the tractors. The majority of these wagons were fitted with superheaters, a feature used as a marketing point against the un-superheated Foden wagons. The overtype wagons were initially produced in a 5-ton capacity, with a 3-ton design following in 1911. By the early 1920s, the overtype wagon market was declining in the face of competition from undertype steam wagons and petrol wagons. In 1926 a last- ditch attempt was made to produce an updated design of 6-ton capacity using components from the new undertype designs, but only 8 were produced. Overall, 693 overtypes were produced to the firm's designs. The final Aveling & Porter overtype wagons were assembled by Garrett, under the arrangements made at the formation of AGE. By 1920 the success of the Sentinel undertypes was evident, and Garretts decided to re-enter the undertype wagon market. Their first prototype was produced in 1921, driven by a two-cylinder engine with piston valves actuated by Joy valve gear. Unusually for the time, the wagon was fitted with Timken roller bearings on the crankshaft, countershaft and axles. This design was built under licence as the \\"Adamov-Garrett\\" by Adamov of Czechoslovakia from 1925. In 1926 a prototype rigid six-wheeled wagon was produced. In 1927 a poppet valve engine replaced the earlier design, this being used until the end of production in 1932. 310 wagons were produced in this second phase of undertype construction. =Electric vehicles= Garrett began to look at whether there was a market for electric vehicles in 1912, and having decided that they were ideally suited for certain types of work, produced their first vehicle in 1913. This was a 3.5-ton battery-powered vehicle, intended for local deliveries. Garrett obtained a patent, No.103,617 in 1916 for an interlocking device, that ensured that the current to the motor of an electric vehicle was disconnected authomatically when the brakes were applied, and that ensured the vehicle could not be driven away with the handbrake still applied. One of their first electric vehicles was bought by the Great Eastern Railway, and worked at . It had an motor, which was fully enclosed and mounted in front of the rear axle. This was connected to a differential cross shaft by chains running in an oil bath, which was in turn connected to the rear axle by two roller chains. The batteries were mounted below the chassis, to the rear of the driver's seat, while the control system included the patented interlock, providing six forward speeds and four in reverse. The range of the vehicle was between on a single charge, at speeds of . In 1917 Garrett also made a smaller 2.5-ton model, of a similar design. With the end of the First World War, many manufacturing companies found themselves freed from their contracts for war supplies for the Ministry of Munitions, including Garrett, who announced in December 1918 that they could take orders again for their 3-ton and 5-ton steam wagons, as well as three types of electric vehicles, the 1.5-ton, 2.5-ton and 3.5-ton models. In January 1919, Lieut-Col F Garrett was appointed to be a representative of the manufacturers of electric vehicles on the Electric Vehicle Committee. At the Roads and Transport Congress held in 1919, Garrett displayed a 2.5-ton electric vehicle with an electrically-operated end-tipping body. In a review of electric vehicle manufacturing in East Anglia, Commercial Motor noted that Garrett had experienced a period where it had been difficult to obtain sufficient motors and electrical equipment for their requirements, but that this had been alleviated by taking over a company making these components. An assessment of the use of electric vehicles by municipalities in 1922 revealed that Garrett had supplied 33 of the 501 in use at the time. In an effort to combat the perception that electric vehicles were particularly slow, Garrett introduced a new chassis in 1922, which was designed for fast delivery work in towns. It was much lighter than previous models, though still able to carry loads of 1.5 to 2 tons, and had a range of around on a single charge. Commercial Motor noted that the speed was a great improvement on the previous heavy vehicles, but did not give any figures. A Garrett patent controller gave the vehicle eight forward speeds and seven in reverse, controlled by a foot pedal, while the motor was connected to a worm drive on the Timken-Detroit back axle by a carden shaft, rather than using chains. They must also have introduced some larger models, as they won a contract to supply ten 5-ton electric dustcarts to the Sheffield Corporation Cleansing Department in 1923, nine with chain drives, and one with a worm drive. By the end of the year, they were advertising models carrying from 1.5 tons to 6 tons. The 2.5-ton, 3.5-ton and 5-ton models were each available with two lengths of chassis, with the shorter models able to be fitted with tipping bodies. In 1924 they obtained a patent, No.214,093, jointly with A E Collins of the City Engineers' Office, Norwich, for a system of extra controls, enabling the vehicle to be moved by the driver while he was walking beside it, which would be particularly useful for doorstep deliveries. In 1926, Garrett won a contract to supply dustcarts to Glasgow Corporation, who were looking for a special design for collecting refuse from the tenements of Govan. Electric vehicles were needed, because much of the refuse was collected during the night. Garrett put a lot of effort into producing a suitable vehicle, which became known as the model GTZ. To make them more manoeuvrable, the front wheels were located behind the cab, and the chassis was redesigned to produce a very low loading line, only above the road surface. The batteries were fitted over the front axle, between the cab and the body. Because they were only ever likely to work out of the recycling plant at Govan, tipping gear was not fitted to each vehicle, but was instead built into the Govan plant. The first vehicle of a batch of 36 was completed on 25 February 1927, and proved successful, at Garret eventually supplied 54 GTZ units with solid tyres, and later a smaller batch fitted with pneumatic tyres. They continued to work in Glasgow until the GTZ system was phased out in 1964. =Trolleybuses= When Ipswich Corporation opened their first trolleybus route in 1923, Garrett and another local manufacturer, Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies both saw an opportunity, and decided to enter the trolleybus market. Garrett produced an experimental vehicle in February 1925, with a high straight chassis, solid tyres, and brakes on the rear wheels only. Another member of the Agricultural and General Engineers group, Bull Motors, supplied the motor, while Garrett designed and built their own controller for it, operated by a foot pedal. The chassis was then despatched to Charles H. Roe of Leeds, who fitted a 32-seat body with a central entrance, and proving trials were carried out on the systems at Leeds, Keighley and Bradford before the vehicle arrived back in Ipswich for extended trials on 16 July 1925. Ipswich kept it until March 1926, when deliveries of their order for 15 trolleybuses began. The bodywork was by Strachan & Brown, complete with 31 seats and dual entrances. The front entrance was designed to facilitate one-man operation, and the front wheels were set back behind it. Garrett's second prototype was completed in time for the Commercial Motor Show at Olympia in November 1925. The chassis and floor level were lower, and Strachan & Brown fitted a 36-seat body with a central entrance. It was demonstrated on the Mexborough and Swinton system in December, and then ran trials on the Leeds system until November 1926, when it was bought by Bradford. Ipswich's vehicles had a wheelbase of and solid wheels, but the Type O trolleybus was also offered with a wheelbase of and there was an option of having pneumatic types on the shorter chassis. All had a controller manufactured by British Thomson-Houston. A fourth variation was offered, with a 57-seat double deck body, but no orders were received for this model. For the Commercial Motor Show in November 1927, they built a 3-axle Model OS, with double-deck bodywork which they had built themselves. After the show, the vehicle was hired by Southend-on-Sea Corporation, and subsequently bought by them. Doncaster ordered four similar vehicles, but with 60-seat bodywork by Charles H. Roe, the first of which was tested on the Mexborough and Swinton system, while Southend ordered five more vehicles, with 60-seat bodyword built by Garrett. They produced a 52-page catalogue in May 1929, but the only order received was for three single-deck type O vehicles for Mexborough and Swinton. Building trolleybuses did not prove to be particularly profitable for Garrett, and they decided to withdraw from the market in late 1930. Their final sale was of a demonstrator which had been built to promote sales in Europe, which they converted to right hand drive and sold to Ipswich on 24 November 1931. During the five years in which they had been active in this field, they sold 101 trolleybuses. =Diesel wagons= Garrett were a pioneer in the construction of diesel-engined road vehicles, and their two 1928-built experimental Crude Oil Wagons, known as COWS in the works, are believed to be the first British-built wagons fitted with diesel engines from new. These vehicles were constructed using the chassis and running gear from the undertype wagon designs, one a four-wheeler and the other a six-wheeler, both fitted with a McLaren Benz engine. The COWS proved the concept of a diesel wagon, and in 1930 the company embarked on designing a production vehicle. Due to the company being part of the AGE combine, the engine chosen for the design was a Blackstone's design, the BHV6. The first vehicle, designated the GB6, was completed in 1931 and a test programme was initiated. The venture was not successful, primarily due to the unreliability of the Blackstone engine, and the perilous economic state of the works at that time. After the company was bought by Beyer Peacock, a half- hearted attempt was made to market the design with a Gardner engine fitted, but no wagon was ever produced.

It premiered in Norway on October 13, 2006, received positive reviews, and was hailed as one of the best modern Norwegian horror movies. On February 7, 2017, it was reported that WWE Studios has acquired the exclusive English-language remake rights to the franchise and has sealed a deal for an option to purchase the screenplay Casey La Scala is writing. The American remake will also be named Cold Prey. Plot As the film begins, a boy with a large birthmark covering one eye runs frantically through a blizzard in Jotunheimen, being pursued by an unknown entity. Eventually, he stumbles, and his unseen pursuer catches up to him. Despite his pleas, the person proceeds to bury him alive in the snow. Years later, a young group of friends consisting of Jannicke, her boyfriend Eirik, and their friends, Mikal, Ingunn, and Morten Tobias are going on a snowboarding vacation in Jotunheimen. They drive to a secluded area in the mountains to avoid the crowds. When they arrive at the peak, they immediately begin snowboarding down the mountain slopes. Morten Tobias suddenly takes a bad fall and breaks his leg. Jannicke takes charge and sets his leg but realizes they can't care for it properly out in the elements. They also have no cell reception and the car is too far away to get there before dark. Wandering over a hill, they spot a lodge and decide to seek help there. When they get to the lodge, Eirik discovers that the place is deserted. He breaks in through a window and unlocks a door. As Jannicke looks for medical supplies she comes across a box that contains superglue and a single shotgun shell. Jannicke treats Morten's broken leg with alcohol and the superglue. Eirik, Mikal and Ingunn go explore the abandoned resort, while Jannicke stays to keep Morten company. The three discover the generator, which Eirik fixes, and power is restored to the resort. Afterwards, Mikal and Ingunn run off by themselves. While exploring the various lodge suites, they discover a room in disarray with a bed burnt to cinders. Eirik, on his way back to the parlor, hears a clanking noise from down in the cellar, and assumes it's Mikal and Ingunn. He calls for them to be more careful, but he receives no reply. With the lights back on, music playing and plentiful amounts of food and alcohol, the group relaxes in the parlor. Jannicke finds the hotel's guestbook and discovers that the last guest checked in some time in 1975 and there is a message reading \\"We hope you find your son\\". Inside the book, there is a picture of a family that includes the boy with a birthmark over his eye. The group settles in for the night with Mikal and Ingunn running off to a suite, Jannicke and Eirik cuddling under blankets in the parlor, and Morten Tobias alone on the couch. Making out in bed, Mikal begins to get aggressive and Ingunn shoves him off. He then leaves in a huff. Ingunn hears a strange noise and, thinking it's Mikal returning, enters the hall. She's suddenly attacked by an unknown shape and runs through the halls screaming for help but is drowned out by the music playing in the parlor. Before she can reach Mikal, who's sitting at the bar, she's stabbed by a pickaxe and dragged away. The next morning, Eirik leaves to go for help and Mikal heads to the suite to apologize to Ingunn. Eirik stumbles across Ingunn's body in the snow. He's then smashed in the head by the blunt end of a pickaxe. Mikal gets no answer from Ingunn so he and Jannicke explore the basement. They find items that were invented long after the lodge closed in the 1970s and become nervous. Jannicke goes to talk to Ingunn and enters the suite to discover it's covered in blood. She brings Mikal and Morten Tobias to the suite just as a blast of wind flows through the hallway from an open door. They realize someone else is in the lodge and barricade themselves in an empty suite. Footsteps are heard in the hall and someone begins to slam against the door, trying to get in. When they eventually leave, Mikal tells Jannicke they should run. She points out that Morten Tobias can't and Mikal says they should just leave him. Jannicke refuses and Mikal escapes through a window. Jannicke and Morten Tobias watch through the window as Mikal hides in a shed. Suddenly, a massive Mountain Man appears outside wearing animals skins and goggles. He enters the shed and Mikal tries to run, but becomes stuck in a bear trap. The Mountain Man breaks Mikal's neck. Jannicke drags Morten Tobias to a pantry and tells him to memorize the label on a can until she gets back. She narrowly misses being spotted by the Mountain Man as he drags Mikal's body inside. Jannicke runs to the shed where she finds some skis, a sled, and a shotgun. She runs into the parlor where she picks up the discarded shotgun shell and loads the gun. She goes back to the pantry and tells Morten Tobias that she has a plan. They go down to the basement where Jannicke kills the generator, alerting the Mountain Man to their whereabouts. Morten Tobias finds a box cutter and puts it in his pocket. Jannicke waits for the Mountain Man to appear so she can shoot him but discovers the keys she gave to Eirik on the floor. When she enters the back room she finds Eirik tied up but alive. Unable to free him, she goes back to wait for the Mountain Man. When he appears, he goes straight into the back room. Jannicke points the gun at him, but he shuts off his flashlight and disappears into darkness. Thinking quickly, Jannicke shuts the door and locks him in the back room but refuses to leave him in there with Eirik. Opening the door, she shoots but is knocked askew by Morton Tobias who realizes the Mountain Man is using Eirik as a human shield. The Mountain Man impales Eirik with his pickaxe, killing him. Morten Tobias tells Jannicke to run. He tries to stop the Mountain Man with a saw but to no avail, and The Mountain Man kills him. Jannicke grabs her skis and runs outside into the darkness only to be knocked out by the Mountain Man. When she awakes, she's on the sled, buried under her dead friends. The Mountain Man brings them to a deep ravine and begins tossing the bodies over one by one. Jannicke grabs the box cutter out of Morten Tobias's pocket and lies still. Jannicke is the last to be dragged off the sled and, as the Mountain Man grabs her, she stabs him in the neck with the box cutter. They struggle over the pickaxe and end up on the ground by the edge of the ravine. As the Mountain Man is about to stab Jannicke, she rips off his goggles revealing a birthmark over his eye. Taken by surprise, the Mountain Man lets his guard down. Jannicke grabs his pickaxe and stabs him in the stomach, sending him over the ravine. In a flashback, we see the Mountain Man as a boy, running from his pursuer. As he's covered in the snow, he looks up to see the faces of his parents, burying him alive. The Mountain Man hits the bottom of the ravine, surrounded by the bodies of Jannicke's friends. Jannicke, exhausted collapses into the snow.

Depending on the purpose, models can be made from a variety of materials, including blocks, paper, and wood, and at a variety of scales. History Architectural models have been in use since pre-history. The oldest models were found in Malta, such as at Tarxien Temples, and are now at the archaeology museum in Valletta. Purpose Project managers discuss the plant development using an architectural model Architectural models are used by architects for a range of purposes: * Ad hoc models, or sketch models, are sometimes made to study the interaction of volumes, different viewpoints, or concepts during the design process. They may also be useful in explaining a complicated or unusual design to builders, or as a focus for discussion between designers and consultants such as architects, engineers and town planners. * Presentation models can be used to exhibit, visualise or sell a final design. A model are also used as show pieces, for instance as a feature in the reception of a building, or as part of a museum exhibition such as scale replicas of historical buildings. Types of models include: * Exterior models are models of buildings which usually include some landscaping or civic spaces around the building. * Interior models are models showing interior space planning, finishes, colors, furniture and beautification. * Landscaping design models are models of landscape design and development representing features such as walkways, small bridges, pergolas, vegetation patterns and beautification. Landscaping design models usually represent public spaces and may, in some cases, include buildings as well. * Urban models are models typically built at a much smaller scale (starting from 1:500 and less, 1:700, 1:1000, 1:1200, 1:2000, 1:20 000), representing several city blocks, even a whole town or village, large resort, campus, industrial facility, military base and so on. Urban models are a vital tool for town/city planning and development. Urban models of large urban areas are displayed at museums such as the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Center, Queens Museum in New York, the Beijing Planning Exhibition Hall, and the Singapore City Gallery. * Engineering and construction models show isolated building/structure elements and components and their interaction.

Early virtual modelling involved the fixing of arbitrary lines and points in virtual space, mainly to produce technical drawings. Modern packages include advanced features such as databases of components, automated engineering calculations, visual fly-throughs, dynamic reflections, and accurate textures and colours. As an extension to CAD (computer-aided design) and BIM (building information modelling), virtual reality architectural sessions are also being adopted at increasingly faster rates. As this technology enables participants to be immersed in a 1:1 scale model, essentially experiencing the building before it is even being built. Materials Rough study models can be made quickly using cardboard, wooden blocks, polystyrene, foam, foam boards and other materials. Such models are an efficient design tool for three- dimensional understanding of a structure, space or form, used by architects, interior designers and exhibit designers. Common materials used for centuries in architectural model building were card stock, balsa wood, basswood and other woods. Modern professional architectural model builders are taking advantage of twenty-first century materials, such as Taskboard (a flexible and lightweight wood/fiber board), plastics, wooden and wooden-plastic composites, foams, foam board and urethane compounds. A number of companies produce ready- made pieces for structural components (e.g. girders, beams), siding, furniture, figures (people), vehicles, trees, bushes and other features which are found in the models. Features such as vehicles, people figurines, trees, street lights and other are called \\"scenery elements\\" and serve not only to beautify the model, but also to help the observer to obtain a correct feel of scale and proportions represented by the model. Increasingly, rapid prototyping techniques such as 3D printing and CNC routing are used to automatically construct models straight from CAD plans.

The art of cork modelling is also called phelloplasty (Greek œÜŒµŒªŒªœåœÇ phellos, cork). Cork was already used in the 16th century in Naples to make Christmas cribs. Crib making became extremely popular there in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The invention of architectural models made of cork was (self-)attributed to Augusto Rosa (1738-1784) but Giovanni Altieri (documented 1766/67-1790) and above all Antonio Chichi (1743-1816, https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tempel_des_Portunus_Gotha.JPG) were already active in Rome as manufacturers of cork models. Chichi's models were copied with great success by Carl May (1747-1822, https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_May) and his son Georg Heinrich May (1790‚Äì1853). Other artists can be mentioned like Luigi Carotti (Rome), Carlo Lucangeli (1747-1812, Rome, Naples), Domenico Padiglione and his sons Agostino and Felice (Naples) and Auguste Pelet (1785-1865, N√Æmes). In Marseille, several scale models were made representing archaeological digs by Hippolyte Augier (1830-1889) (Marseille History Museum / Mus√©e d‚ÄôHistoire de Marseille) or Stanislas Clastrier (1857-1925, https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislas_Clastrier). Dieter C√∂llen is a contemporary phelloplastic. Collections Many cork models of classical monuments in Italy were made and sold to tourists during their Grand Tour. Cork, especially when carefully painted, was ideal to reproduce the weathered look of wall surfaces. As a rule, they were produced on a large scale (the Colosseum in Aschaffenburg is three metres long and one metre high) and with great, almost scientific precision. Cork models were highly esteemed in the princely courts of the 18th century. They were also acquired for their scientific value by schools of architecture in the late 18th/early 19th century, or institutions like the Society of Antiquaries of London and the British Museum thus introducing the general public to ancient architecture. Despite their fragility, cork models have often survived better than wooden models threatened by wood-destroying insects. Apart from kings and princes, cork models were collected by people such as Filippo Farsetti (1703-1774) in Venice, Pierre Gaspard Marie Grimod d'Orsay (1748-1809) or the architect Louis-Fran√ßois Cassas in France, Charles Townley or Sir J. Soane in London, who turned his home into a museum, Sir John Soane's Museum, housing a collection of 14 models in cork of Roman and Greek buildings. Chichi's cork models can be found at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg (34 models made around 1774); Schloss Wilhelmsh√∂he, Kassel (33 models made 1777-1782); Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt (26 models acquired 1790/91); and the Herzogliches Museum Gotha (12 models, acquired after 1777/78. See Wikipedia in German). The largest collection of cork models by Carl May with 54 pieces (after war losses) is in Aschaffenburg (Schloss Johannisburg), another large collection of his models is in the Staatliches Museum Schwerin. In France, the Mus√©e des Antiquit√©s Nationales √† Saint-Germain-en-Laye, has works by Rosa,http://www.ensba.fr/ow2/catzarts/rechcroisee.xsp?f=Ensemble&v;=&f;=Auteur_field&v;=Rosa%2C+Agostino&e;= Lucandelihttp://www.ensba.fr/ow2/catzarts/rechcroisee.xsp?f=Ensemble&v;=&f;=Auteur_field&v;=Lucangeli%2C+Carlo&e; or Pelet.http://www.ensba.fr/ow2/catzarts/rechcroisee.xsp?f=Ensemble&v;=&f;=Auteur_field&v;=Pelet%2C+Auguste&e; The Mus√©e arch√©ologique de N√Æmes (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_arch%C3%A9ologique_de_N%C3%AEmes), and the Marseille History Museum also have cork models. Modern cork models of antique buildings by Dieter C√∂llen are exhibited in the Praetorium in Cologne. http://www.museenkoeln.de/archaeologische-zone/default.asp Scales Architectural models are being constructed at much smaller scale than their 1:1 counterpart. The scales and their architectural use is broadly as follows: *1:1 Full (or real) size for details *1:2 Details *1:5 Details *1:10 Interior spaces/furniture *1:20 Interior spaces/furniture *1:50 Interior spaces/detailed floor plans/different floor levels *1:100 Building plans/layouts *1:200 Building plans/layouts *1:500 Building layouts/site plans *1:1000 Urban scale for site or location plans *1:1250 Site plans *1:2500 Site plans/city maps *1:5000 City maps/Island Sometimes model railroad scales such as 1:160 and 1:87 are used due to ready availability of commercial figures, vehicles and trees in those scales, and models of large buildings are most often built in approximately that range of scales due to size considerations.

It was to be directed by celebrated Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray and co-produced by Columbia Pictures. The script was written by Ray in 1967, loosely based on Bankubabur Bandhu (Banku Babu's Friend or Mr. Banku's Friend), a Bengali science fiction story he had written in 1962 for Sandesh, the Ray family magazine, which gained popularity among Bengalis in the early 1960s. Bankubabur Bandhu was eventually adapted into a television film by Satyajit Ray's son Sandip Ray, and a play by the theatre group Swapnasandhani Kaushik Sen, in 2006. Plot The plot revolves around a spaceship that lands in a pond in rural Bengal. The villagers begin worshiping it as a temple risen from the depths of the earth. The alien, known as \\"Mr Ang\\", establishes contact with a young village boy named Haba (meaning \\"Dumb\\" in Bengali) through dreams and also plays a number of pranks on the village community in the course of its short stay on planet Earth. The plot contains the ebullient presence of an Indian businessman, a journalist from Calcutta and an American engineer. Ray's biographer W. Andrew Robinson describes one particular scene from the screenplay as follows: \\"In a series of fantastically quick, short steps over the lotus leaves, the Alien reaches the shore of the pond. He looks down at the grass, examines the blade and is off hopping into the bamboo grove. There the Alien sees a small plant. His eyes light up with a yellow light. He passes his hand over the plant, and flowers come out. A thin, soft high-pitched laugh shows the Alien is pleased.\\" Production The Alien had Columbia Pictures as producer for this planned US‚ÄìIndia co-production, and Peter Sellers and Marlon Brando acting in lead roles. However, Ray was surprised to find that the script he had written had already been copyrighted and the fee appropriated by Michael Wilson (Ray's representative in Hollywood). Wilson had copyrighted the script as co-writer, despite not being involved in any way in its creation. Marlon Brando later dropped out of the project and though an attempt was made to bring James Coburn in his place, Ray became disillusioned and returned to Calcutta. Columbia expressed interest in reviving the project several times in the 1970s and 1980s but nothing came of it. Legacy When the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was produced in 1982, Ray noted similarities in the movie to his own earlier script. Ray discussed the collapse of the project in a 1980 Sight & Sound feature, with further details revealed by his biographer Andrew Robinson (in The Inner Eye, 1989). Ray claimed that Steven Spielberg's film \\"would not have been possible without my script of The Alien being available throughout America in mimeographed copies.\\" When the issue was raised by the press, Spielberg denied this claim and said \\"I was a kid in high school when his script was circulating in Hollywood.\\" Star Weekend Magazine disputes Spielberg's claim, pointing out that he had graduated from high school in 1965 and began his career as a director in Hollywood in 1969. The Times of India noted that E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) had \\"remarkable parallels\\" with The Alien. These parallels include the physical nature of the alien. In his screenplay, which Ray wrote entirely in English, he described the alien as \\"a cross between a gnome and a famished refugee child: large head, spindly limbs, a lean torso. Is it male or female or neuter? We don't know. What its form basically conveys is a kind of ethereal innocence, and it is difficult to associate either great evil or great power with it; yet a feeling of eeriness is there because of the resemblance to a sickly human child.\\"Ray, Satyajit. The Chess Players and Other Screenplays. London: Faber and Faber, 1989, p. 145. The 2003 Bollywood film Koi... Mil Gaya, directed by Rakesh Roshan, appears to be based on Satyajit Ray's The Alien. In particular, the film appears to parallel The Alien more closely than E.T. in that it revolves around an intellectually challenged person coming in contact with a friendly alien. In 2003, Satyajit Ray's son Sandip Ray began working on adapting Ray's original 1962 story Bankubabur Bandhu into a Bengali television movie of the same name. The adapted film, directed by Kaushik Sen, was eventually shown on television in India in 2006. This version is based on Ray's original story Bankubabur Bandhu where the protagonist was a school teacher named Banku Babu, in contrast to his script for The Alien where the protagonist was a boy named Haba.

KBER (101.1 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a mainstream rock format. Licensed to Ogden, Utah, United States, the station serves the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. The station is currently owned by Cumulus Media. The station's studios are located in South Salt Lake (behind the I-15/I-80 interchange). History Prior to March 1986, KBER was known as KDAB, and was licensed to Ogden (as KBER is to this day). It was known then as \\"B101\\". KBER began on 106.5, but moved to its current dial position in March 1990. It was purchased by Citadel Broadcasting during that time.Broadcast History, Salt Lake City Radio It also morphed into \\"101 The Bear\\". The station employed a number of on-air talent including \\"Uncle Nasty\\". Uncle Nasty's irreverent style translated into an instant following especially with Men 18-34. Uncle Nasty was on air 7pm to 12am, then moved to morning drive a year later. In 1998 the station reverted to the more familiar \\"KBER 101\\" slogan of its earlier years and is currently a top rated mainstream rock station in Salt Lake City Utah. By 2008, the station's sister station KHTB became a modern rock station, carrying mostly newer rock. KBER gradually began to change its playlist to include more classic rock songs, although it has since returned to a mainstream rock format. Later on, Mediabase & Nielsen BDS began reporting KBER on the mainstream rock panel. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. Early programming The station arrived as one of the leading FM radio stations in the market with on air personalities Street and Katherine, Tom Collins, Kevin Lewis, John Edwards, Mark Christiansen and Jay \\"J-bear\\" Stevens to name a few. The early to mid 1990s were the wild days with Cory \\"Porn Master\\" Draper, Casey \\"The Night Rocker\\" Baird, Kevin \\"Easy\\" Eason, Alan \\"Dr. Rock\\" Bain, Mark \\"Erection\\" Erickson, \\"Young Hung\\" Brandon Young, Ron Harrison, Allen \\"My Wife has me by the Balls\\" Handy, Helmut \\"No longer a part timer\\" Von Schmidt, Chris Howey \\"Opie Asswipe\\", Jamie \\"Hymie Escalante\\" Valle'e, the screaming weather man, Patrick \\"Skye Bleu\\" Burton, Michael Hayes, Nate \\"The Hitman\\" and others. Those were the days of Mike Marble's wildly successful KBER-RAFTERS Showcase Concert Series. The Ron & Allen Morning Show was wildly popular and they even had their own television show called \\"Rock Utah\\" which aired on local channel 30. Some of the more memorable events the morning show perpetrated were the \\"Heterosexual Pride Parade\\", a wrestling match between Ron and the \\"Punisher\\" against Allen and Hymie, which raised money for the MDA, Hymie taking the morn show and some listeners skydiving, Allen and Hymie driving a top fuel dragster at Bonneville Raceway, and a hoax which had listeners believing that Allen Handy had been arrested by the Secret Service. The show was every bit as wild as anything being done at the time in the largest markets, including Howard Stern in New York City. After Ron Harrison was summarily dismissed for an on- air stunt, Allen Handy and Michael Hayes took over as \\"Handy & Hayes\\" for several months carrying on the tradition of placing within the top 1-2 stations in the 18-34 demographic within Salt Lake City's market.Arbitron Analysis Heads West - All Access Darby hosted the midday show prior to Kelly Hammer taking over in 2008.All Access - KBER's Darby Rocks Twice as Much Prior to Darby, the midday shift was hosted by Helen Powers, who went on to work for a number of other radio stations.All Access - Helen Powers Joins The Bear at WYYD Current programming Mornings during the week on KBER previously featured the syndicated \\"Bob and Tom Show\\" (1998‚Äìpresent). The morning show is Mick and Allen's \\"Freak Show\\". Mick and Allen returned to KBER in 2005. Along with regular shows, the station also does live broadcasts during business or station promotions at various events. Every year, KBER hosts an event known as \\"The North Pole Express\\" which is a take on the story The Polar Express and is an event co-hosted by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It is held at Soldier Hollow, outside of Heber, Utah. Signal KBER broadcasts an HD signal along with analog on 101.1 MHz. Its transmitter is located southwest of Salt Lake City on Farnsworth Peak. As with its sister FM stations, the station has an ERP of 25,000 watts.

She was the wife of Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh's guard in the time of Jacob and his twelve sons. According to the Book of Genesis, she falsely accused Joseph of attempted rape after he rejected her sexual advances, resulting in his imprisonment. In Genesis she is given no name, but in later medieval Jewish sources and Islamic tradition, she is identified as Zuleikha ( zoo-LAY-kah; ; ). In Genesis The Bible (Genesis 39:5-20) narrates her treatment of Joseph, slave to her husband Potiphar: In Qur‚Äôan The Qur‚Äôan narrates the wife of Aziz‚Äôs treatment of Yusuf as follows: In Jewish sources Jewish commentators also see some good motives in her actions. A story about Zuleikha is told in medieval Hebrew midrash, Sefer haYashar, also known as the Toledot Adam and Divrei haYamim heArukh, where she was mocked by other aristocratic Egyptian ladies, her circle of friends, for being infatuated with a Hebrew slave boy. Inviting her friends to her home, Zuleikha gave them all oranges and knives to slice them with. While they engaged in this task, Zuleikha had Joseph walk through the room. Distracted by his handsomeness, all the ladies accidentally cut themselves with the knives, drawing blood. Zuleikha then reminded her friends that she had to see Joseph every day. Following this incident, her contemporaries no longer mocked her. Rashi comments that the wife of Potiphar saw through astrology that she would have children through Joseph. The astrological calculations however were slightly off. Asenath, her daughter (by adoption, in some accounts) became the wife of Joseph and therefore the wife of Potiphar begot grandchildren (not children) through Joseph. In Islamic sources Muslim scriptural commentators (Mufassirun) have regarded Zuleikha as a sinner and villainess with the exceptions of the great Muslim mystic poets Rumi, Hafiz and Jami. For Rumi, Zuleikha's obsession with Joseph is a symptom and manifestation of the soul's great deep longing for God. For this, he insists, it is true of any person's deep love for another.

Many of its subsidiaries were revived as independent businesses. Perceived benefits Thomas Lake Aveling and Frank Garrett wanted to bring together a number of agricultural machinery businesses into one strong combine where they would be rationalised and their efficiency improved. They planned to end competition between members in their home market and create a business large enough to compete with the North American firms in export markets. However the centralisation of purchasing, which was soon dispensed with, sales and finance in expensive London headquarters created a heavy financial burden not justified by its benefits. As it turned out lack of competition in the home market seemed to inhibit innovation and responses to market conditions. Subsidiaries moved rather late from steam to internal combustion engines.

Camp history In September 1939 an Internment Camp for enemy civilians was created within the buildings of the Sturmabteilung camp at the rally grounds. Within a couple of months, the civilians were moved out and prisoners from the invasion of Poland arrived. From May 1940, after the invasion of Norway and the Battle of France, prisoners arrived in large numbers, until they totalled 150,000 from all occupied countries, except Britain. British prisoners were held in separate camps all over Germany. Part of the facilities were used as Oflag XIII-A for officers. In August 1940 most enlisted men were shipped to other camps; Stalag XIII-A, Stalag XIII-B and Stalag XIII-C. Only those remained who were already employed in local industry and were housed in individual Arbeitskommandos. In June 1941 the massive influx of Soviet prisoners from Operation Barbarossa began. In August 1943 the camp was severely damaged during an Allied air-raid. 23 wooden huts were burnt down. Miraculously only two Soviet prisoners were killed in the camp. However, in this and subsequent bombing attacks, many prisoners were killed in individual Arbeitskommandos. In late 1944/early 1945 the camp population grew enormously with the arrival of prisoners evacuated from camps in the east in front of the advance of the Red Army. These included many Americans and British airmen from Stalag Luft III. On 12 April 1945 large numbers were marched to Stalag VII-A, and on 16 April the camp was liberated by advance elements of the United States Army. Post-War After the war, former SS military personnel were held in Stalag XIII-D. It imprisoned 15,000 SS members. In 1946 there was an attempt to kill the SS prisoners, apparently by Abba Kovner's Jewish Revenge organisation Nakam. A member of the group got a job as a baker and poisoned the bread to be fed to the prisoners. Large numbers were taken ill, but the actual death toll is not known.Jonathan Freedland, \\"Revenge\\", The Guardian, Saturday 26 July 2008 Stalag XIII C at Lager Hammelburg, 2.5 miles from Stadt Hammelburg, gained fame as the main setting of the CBS sitcom Hogan's Heroes, which ran from 1965 to 1971.

He is being honored on the Fiftieth Anniversary of him ascended to the leadership position as the 16th Head of the shogunal branch of the Tokugawas. Prince was the first head of the Tokugawa clan after the overthrow of the Tokugawa bakufu, and a significant figure in Japanese politics and diplomacy during the Meiji, Taish≈ç and early Sh≈çwa period Japan. When Prince Tokugawa travelled to other nations representing Japan during his diplomatic journeys, he usually presented his name being Prince Iyesato Tokugawa. Early life Tokugawa Iesato was born to the Tayasu branch of the Tokugawa clan, under the name Kamenosuke, he became its 16th head, following the resignation of the last sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu. His brothers were Tokugawa Satotaka and Tokugawa Takachiyo, who also held the Tayasu headship at different times. Iesato was also briefly the daimy≈ç of the short-lived Shizuoka Domain, before the abolition of the han system in the early 1870s. His guardian at the time was Matsudaira Naritami, the former lord of the Tsuyama Domain. He was an adopted son of the fourteenth shogun, Tokugawa Iemochi and his wife, Kazu-no-Miya Chikako or Seikan'in no Miya (although Iesato was Iemochi's adopted son they only met once. Later Iemochi's foster mother, Tensh≈ç-in, raised Iesato). In 1866 he was sent to Edo Castle as Iemochi's son and was raised by Tensh≈ç-in and Kazu-no-Miya Chikako. In 1868 he was sent to Kyoto by his mother, Kazu-no-Miya Chikako and met with Emperor Meiji. He married the daughter of Konoe Tadafusa, Konoe Hiroko, who bore him Iemasa Tokugawa, the seventeenth Tokugawa family head, Yasuko Tokugawa, who married Nobusuke Takatsukasa and bore him Toshimichi Takatsukasa, Ry≈çko Tokugawa, and Toshiko Tokugawa.

He returned to Japan in 1882, and was given the title of k≈çshaku (ÂÖ¨Áàµ, prince) under the kazoku peerage system. He became a member of the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan from its creation in 1890, and served as President of the House of Peers from 1903-1933. When the administration of Prime Minister Yamamoto Gonnohy≈çe was brought down by the Siemens scandal, there was a strong movement to have Tokugawa Iesato nominated to be his successor as the new Prime Minister.. Japan not only militarily supported her western allies‚Äô in their war efforts, she also aided the Allies‚Äô sick and wounded during and after the war. In 1917, out of empathy for the suffering resulting from the enormous death and destruction in Europe during World War One, Prince Iyesato Tokugawa and his close friend and ally Baron Shibusawa Eiichi (aka Baron Eiichi Shibusawa) along with their other Japanese associates published a condolence booklet honoring their western allies. This 1917 condolence booklet describes the Japanese creating an association that collected a monetary fund that was being gifted to Allied nations to help with their war related health costs. This association was headed by Prince Iyesato Tokugawa its president, and Baron Eiichi Shibusawa and S. Shimada as its vice- presidents. Many of Japan‚Äôs top leaders contributed articles to this booklet expressing their support of the Allies. This condolence booklet was published in a French and English edition. The condolence booklet was titled: Japan to her Allies: A Message of Practical Sympathy from the Japan Association for Aiding the Sick and Wounded Soldiers and Others Suffering from the War in the Allied Countries. Published in Tokyo, Japan, 1917. The illustrated biography The Art of Peace by Stan S. Katz highlights the alliance between Prince Iyesato Tokugawa and Baron Eiichi Shibusawa as they promoted democracy and international goodwill. The August 21, 1918 press photo illustration to the right presents Prince Iyesato Tokugawa with his wife and children. The rare over one hundred year old photo was taken on the occasion of Prince Tokugawa being honored on the Fiftieth Anniversary of his being the 16th hereditary head of the shogunal branch of the Tokugawas. In 1868, a half-century prior to this photo he ascended to that prestigious leadership position. Iyesato‚Äôs son, Iyemasa, sits adjacent to his father. Iyesato and his wife (far left) are also accompanied by their three daughters. Notice in the upper margin of the photo, several individuals respectfully look on as the photograph is taken. Following World War I, Iesato headed the Japanese delegation to the Washington Naval Conference. His support of the United States position on the 10:10:6 division of naval strength between the United States, Great Britain and Japan drew considerable wrath from the ultra-rightist movements and conservative factions within the Imperial Japanese Navy. Iesato is remembered for having recovered the political fortunes and reputation of the Tokugawa family, holding many senior government positions before his retirement, including In 1928, being appointed as the 7th President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, head of the Japan-America Society, and President of the national organizing committee for the 1940 Olympics. Iesato is quoted as once having said about his adoptive father: \\"Yoshinobu destroyed the Tokugawa house; I rebuilt it.\\" His grave is at the Tokugawa family cemetery at the temple of Kan'ei-ji in Ueno, Tokyo. He was succeeded by his son Tokugawa Iemasa (also known as Tokugawa Iyemasa). In 1930, Rotary International wished to recognize and honor Prince Iyesato Tokugawa‚Äôs lifelong devotion to maintaining international goodwill by selecting him to be the Keynote speaker at their Silver (25th) Anniversary Convention celebration. There are 1930 photos available that present the founder of Rotary International, Paul Harris, along with the current President of Rotary (1929-1930) M. Eugene Newsom, introducing their Keynote speaker Prince Tokugawa to the 15,000 Rotarians attending the event from around the world. One of Prince Tokugawa's close allies during the 1930s in the promotion of goodwill between Japan and the United States was Ambassador Joseph Grew. In 1932, Prince Tokugawa honored Grew with a reception when he first became U.S. Ambassador to Japan. From late 1933 and into 1934, Prince Iyesato Tokugawa went on a World Tour. He first arrived in the U.S. in San Francisco, California. He had only recently retired from his distinguished thirty year career as President of the Japan‚Äôs upper house of congress, the House of Peers. He arrived aboard the Chichibu Maru Ocean Liner enroute to England. During his travels, he stated he wished to renew old friendships. Prince Tokugawa first visited America in 1882, after completing his studies in England. The Prince mentioned he looked forward to visiting the World‚Äôs Fair being held in Chicago. Besides being a pleasant vacation, Prince Tokugawa's world travels were very much directed at attempting to further strengthen Japan‚Äôs relationship with its allies in the U.S. and Europe so as to better resist a rising global militarism and fascism. While in the U.S., Prince Tokugawa delivered a radio address to the American public describing the long enduring and friendly relations between United States and Japan; he also met with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, as well as other U.S. congressional leaders, encouraging a united front to prevent a potential upcoming war. During his visit, Prince Iyesato Tokugawa in 1934 received an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from the University of Southern California. The president of the university, Dr. Rufus B. von Kleinsmid, hands the degree to Prince Tokugawa. Left to right in photo: Prince Iyesato Tokugawa; Iyemasa Tokugawa (Iyesato‚Äôs son); George I.

Cochran, the president of the school's Board of Trustees. The Los Angeles Times stated that this honorary degree was given to Prince Tokugawa ‚Äúin recognition of distinguished service in international statesmanship,‚Äù and for his ‚Äúsupport of many philanthropic and educational movements.‚Äù In accepting the honor, Prince Tokugawa respectfully said, ‚ÄúHe wished to receive it in the name of the Japanese people as a whole rather than as a personal distinction.‚Äù Prince Iyesato Tokugawa was accompanied by his son Iyemasa, who was the newly appointed Minister to Canada, and by his grand-daughter Miss Toyo Tokugawa. The Los Angeles Times also stated that a banquet dinner was to be hosted that evening by the Japan-America Society of Los Angeles to honor the Prince Tokugawa's visit. The Japan-America Society of Los Angeles is part of the National Association of Japan-America Societies.

Paul, nicknamed \\"Shorty\\", played with many teams over his 12-season career and was a starting outfielder with the Providence Grays club that won the 1884 World Series. His best performance was with the New York Metropolitans, when he set the major league record with 106 walks and produced an Offensive WAR rating of 3.4 that ranked sixth in the American Association. Radford died in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 83. Early life Paul Radford was born on October 14, 1861, in Roxbury, Massachusetts, to parents Benjamin and Anna (Hale) Radford. Six of Paul's siblings died in childhood and he was the youngest of four boys to survive until adulthood. In 1865 the Radford family relocated to the town of Hyde Park, where his father was employed as superintendent of construction at the American Tool and Machine Company. Paul grew up in suburban Hyde Park, a streetcar suburb 10 miles southwest of Boston, amid middle-class prosperity in a house on Fairmount Avenue, as his father advanced to general manager at American Tool. Coming from a religious family, Radford believed in the Sabbath and due to faith, did not do anything on Sundays, save for keeping the day holy. This included not playing baseball. In 1882, Radford signed on to play with Hyde Park's semi-pro baseball team. It was during that season that Hydpe Park played two exhibition games against the Boston Beaneaters. While not impressed with his bat, Beaneaters management was impressed with the fact that Radford pitched as well, and could be used as a relief pitcher during a time in baseball where the regulars rarely came out of the game, barring injury.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/b02ffe45 Pro career Paul Radford made his MLB debut with the Boston Beaneaters on May 1, 1883. Radford had not spent a day in the minor leagues prior to his debut. Radford was a starting outfielder for the Beaneaters that season, sharing the outfield with Charlie Buffinton and Joe Hornung. Just 21 years old, with a handful of semi-pro games on his resume, Radford struggled at the plate, only batting.205. Despite the terrible batting average, manager John Morrill kept Radford in the line-up. Despite also being signed for his ability to come in and pitch if needed, Radford did not make a single appearance as a pitcher that season. Radford was released at the end of the season and was claimed off league waivers by the Providence Grays. Just had he'd been the previous season, Radford was a light hitting outfielder who played for a team that won the championship. The Grays defeated the New York Metropolitans of the rival American Association, thus claiming a World Series victory in an early version of the World Series. Radford was viewed by Grays fans as a good luck charm, as Radford always had with him his \\"lucky horseshoe\\". Radford had kept the horseshoe with him the previous season in Boston had he'd done in Providence. However, luck ran out and Providence did not win a championship in 1885, and Radford was given his release.https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/r/radfopa01.shtml#all_transactions_other Since the National League did not play on Sundays, Radford's strict observation of the Sabbath did not hamper his baseball career. However, after one season with the Kansas City Cowboys, Radford was signed by the New York Metropolitans of the American Association. The American Association did play games on Sundays, causing Radford to come up with clever excuses to miss Sunday games.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/b02ffe45 The rest of Radford's career was spent as a journeyman, never spending more than one season with the same team. He spent the 1890 season with the Cleveland Infants of the ill-fated Players league. The usually light-hitting Radford had one of his best seasons of his career with Cleveland, batting .292 and stealing 25 bases. However, the Players league folded after just one season, and Radford was on the move again. He had a home coming of sorts, playing one season for the Boston Reds of the American Association before joining the Washington Senators of the National league in 1892. The Reds had been a member of the Players League, but they were granted the right to transfer to the American Association, despite objections raised by the National League's Beaneaters. Radford finished his stint in the majors with the early incantation of the Senators. Though he remained a base stealing threat (Radford swiped 65 bases for the Reds in 1891), Radford still struggled at the plate, and never again achieved a high average as he did in the players league. After he was released in 1894, Radford finished his career in the minor leagues before calling it quits in 1897 at the age of 35 as a member of the Hartford Bluebirds. In 1895, Radford was a member of the Scranton Coal Heavers of the Eastern League. Radford was released by the ball club not because of his on field performance, it was because the eastern League played ball on Sundays and management demanded that Radford play as well, despite his objections.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/b02ffe45 Despite an official end to his career in 1897, Radford remained in baseball, making the occasional one time appearance. He played semi-pro baseball and in 1903, he even played for the Hyde Park team, where his journey had had begun some 20 years prior. In 1904, he was suited up and in place to make an emergency appearance for the Chicago Cubs. Even though Radford was 43 years old, Cubs manager Frank Selee needed an extra man one the bench because starting shortstop Joe Tinker was injured. Selee had wanted to use Radford over the utility infielder Shad Barry. However, Barry played in the first game of what was supposed to be a double header. Radford and the Cubs were getting ready to take the field when the second contest was called due to rain. After Tinker was able to return, Radford left the Cubs and returned to playing semi-pro baseball, finishing where it started, as Radford played for Hyde Park in 1907 at the age of 44. Radford would enjoy one more moment on the baseball diamond. In 1922, at the age of 60, Radford played in a charity National League Old-Timers game that was used to raise money for a Children's hospital in Boston. Paul Radford Tobacco Card Post career In October 1885, Paul Radford married Mary Blair. The couple remained together. After his baseball career was over, and even as he played semi-pro, Radford worked as a machinist and through his baseball career, had made enough money so that he was financially stable enough to buy a home for his family. Radford remained in Hyde park for the majority of the rest of his life. In 1912, Hyde Park was absorbed into the city of Boston. In January 1930 the Newspaper Enterprise Association produced a syndicated article about Radford and his lucky horseshoe, since the Boston Red Sox were interested in its whereabouts. The horseshoe hadn‚Äôt been seen since 1894 when the South End Grounds burned down. On February 21, 1945, Paul Radford died at his home. Radford was buried in the rookdale Cemetery, which is located in Dedham.

The university is regionally accredited by the Southern Accreditation of Colleges and Universities. South University identifies itself as non-profit but the U.S. Department of Education classifies the institution as for-profit. Founded in 1899, South University consists of its School of Pharmacy, College of Nursing and Public Health, College of Health Professions, College of Business, College of Theology, and College of Arts and Sciences. History South University was founded in Savannah, Georgia, in 1899 as Draughan's Practical Business College. Draughan's taught many of the skills needed by business professionals at the turn of the 20th century including accounting, banking, typewriting, bookkeeping and shorthand. The South family acquired the institution in 1974, and changed its name to Draughan's Junior College. In 1986, the name was changed to South College. In 2001, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accredited South College at the master's level and the school became South University. The institution's name change to South College resulted in a 2002 legal dispute with Sewanee: The University of the South, which had registered the name \\"The University of the South\\" with the U.S. Patent Office. The issue was resolved in 2003 with both schools retaining their names. In 2003, Education Management Corporation acquired South University. The following year, the university expanded from its main campus in Savannah, Georgia, to include eleven other campus locations across the United States and began offering online courses in 2004. Fifty-two percent of South University students are enrolled entirely online. South University's Savannah campus celebrated its largest graduating class in the institution's history in June 2017, when more than 3,500 students received degrees. In 2015, EDMC, South University's former parent company, agreed to forgive more than $100.8 million in student loan debt held by more than 80,000 former students. U.S. Attorney David J. Hickton of the Western District of Pennsylvania stated that 'Companies cannot enrich their corporate coffers at the expense of students seeking a quality education, or on the backs of taxpayers who are funding our critical financial aid programs ... 'Today's global settlement sends an unmistakable message to all forprofit education companies: the United States will aggressively ferret out fraud and protect innocent students and taxpayer dollars from this kind of egregious abuse.' In December 2016, South University was placed on probation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) due to financial concerns regarding its parent company at the time, EDMC. South University was removed from probation in December 2017 after the sale to Dream Center Education Holdings and SACS approved the university's conversion to not-for-profit status (although the U.S. Department of Education classifies the institution as for-profit.). On January 22, 2019 South University fired a large majority of their workforce including the online support staff located in Chandler, Arizona, closing the site. The following year, on October 17, 2017, the university's former parent company, Education Management Corporation, reported that it had sold its schools to the Los Angeles-based Dream Center Foundation, a non-profit organization. In 2019, South University was expected to be transferred to Education Principle Foundation. In the meantime, all South campuses are being operated independently. The court appointed receiver, Studio Enterprise, and the university had until April 11, 2019 to negotiate to separate South & remaining Art Institute schools from the Dream Center Education IT Platform by September 11, 2019. Writing for the Republic Report, David Halperin opined that \\"[s]hould they fail to agree, the plan of reorganization will likely fail, thereby dooming South University and the Art Institutes.\\" The court-appointed receiver has also reported that \\"there is a 'scattered matching of revenues and expenses' among all the former EDMC schools, making it difficult to determine the true financial picture at the schools in receivership and those controlled by Education Principle Foundation.\\" Campuses *Savannah, online *Montgomery, Alabama *Orlando, Florida *Tampa, Florida *Royal Palm Beach, Florida *Atlanta, Georgia *Savannah, Georgia *Columbia, South Carolina *Round Rock, Texas *Glen Allen, Virginia *Virginia Beach, Virginia Teachout campuses *Novi, Michigan *High Point, North Carolina *Warrensville Heights, Ohio https://www.southuniversity.edu/locations Academics =Accreditation= South University is regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award doctoral, master's, bachelor's, and associate degrees. The institution is classified by SACSCOC as a Level VI institution, meaning it offers four or more doctoral degree programs. The University also offers post-graduate certificate programs through its College of Nursing and Public Health. =School of Pharmacy= South University became the first university in the Savannah area to offer a health professions doctorate when it launched its Doctor of Pharmacy program in 2002. South University's accelerated Doctor of Pharmacy degree (Pharm.D.) program is one of only a limited number nationwide that provides four academic years of study within three calendar years. The degree program is offered at both the Savannah, Georgia and Columbia, South Carolina campuses. The Doctor of Pharmacy program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPTE). =College of Health Professions= South University and Emory University are the only two institutions in the state of Georgia that offer a Master of Medical Science in Anesthesia Science program. South University's program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs upon the recommendation of the Accreditation Review Committee for the Anesthesiologist Assistants (ARC-AA). An Anesthesiologist assistant is qualified by virtue of their education and training at the master's degree level to deliver anesthesia as a member of an anesthesia care team led by a physician anesthesiologist. The University launched its Master of Science in Physician Assistant program in 2002, and it is one of only five programs in the state of Georgia. A Physician Assistant is prepared to work in a medical setting with the ability to evaluate, monitor, diagnose, counsel, refer patients and prescribe medication. The Master of Science in Physician Assistant program is offered at South University's Savannah, Tampa and Richmond campuses and is accredited by The Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). =College of Nursing and Public Health= South University's College of Nursing and Public Health prepares students to practice at all levels of the nursing profession by providing programs at the bachelor's, master's, doctorate and post-graduate certificate level.

The programs provide a broad-based foundation for work in the law enforcement or legal field. South University Novi Campus Student Life =Honor Societies= South University students are eligible for membership in a number of national and international honor societies. These include the Delta Mu Delta International Honor Society in Business, Sigma Theta Tau, which recognizes outstanding academic achievement by nursing students, and Pi Gamma Mu, which is the International Honor Society in Social Sciences. South University Doctor of Pharmacy students are eligible for membership in Rho Chi, the academic honor society in Pharmacy. South University's College of Theology was granted a chapter of Theta Alpha Kappa, the National Honor Society for Religious Studies and Theology in 2017. =Volunteer opportunities= South University students at campuses around the United States volunteer to help provide back-to-school health screenings. and frequently form teams in support of charity runs or walks. In 2016, South University School of Pharmacy students won Kappa Psi's National Outstanding Community Service Award for spearheading a local T.E.A.L. walk that raised money for ovarian cancer awareness. Student outcomes According to the College Scorecard, the Savannah main campus (which includes online students) has a graduation rate of 3 percent, a student loan repayment rate of 25 percent, and a median salary after attending of $33,400. Community impact =Charitable Work= South University students, faculty, and staff participate in numerous Savannah-area charitable fundraising projects annually including the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure., AMBUCS, the T.E.A.L. Walk and more. While the city of Savannah was recovering from Hurricane Matthew in 2016, South University faculty and staff volunteered with clean up efforts around the area.

The Gaelic name is Port Neasaig. Port Nessock Bay is now all that remains of the western end of a strait that in post-glacial times separated the main part of what is now the Rinns of Galloway from three smaller islands to its south. There was a ruined pier in the bay in 1790, at which time kelp and samphire were gathered on the coast to the south.Statistical Account of Scotland , vol 5, page 429; republished 1983 The village was planned; it was created by Colonel Andrew MacDowall (Douall), the laird of Logan, in 1818. MacDowall erected a quay and bell tower designed by Thomas Telford, and a causewayed road leading to them. This causeway blocked the view to seaward of the existing houses on the Lower Road (Laigh Row), whose inhabitants MacDowall expected to move to a new Upper Road; in the event, they welcomed the shelter it provided from the brisk onshore winds, and preferred to stay put, though subsequently most of them added a second storey so recovering some of the sea view. Character and facilities Facilities include a village hall which used to be the local Lifeboat Station. It is run by a local committee and completely self-funding. In recent years it has been used for a range of social events such as weddings and to celebrate Hogmanay and St Andrew's Night. It is sometimes used for meetings of the Kirkmaiden Community Council.http://www.dgcommunity.net/communitycouncil/default.aspx?id=44 There is a tiny part-time post office, as well as a small market garden supplying local businesses and the public. For a couple of years until 2006 they also included a newly built cafe with excellent views called the Butterchurn; however, this was then closed, and converted into a private house. Tourist attractions The Logan Fish Pond, Logan Botanic Garden & Logan House Garden are nearby. Logan Fish Pond was also built by Colonel Andrew McDouall, originally as a fish larder for Logan House, circa 1788 and completed around 1800, with a Keeper's Cottage and Bathing Hut which still stand as part of the modern Logan Fishpond Marine Life Centre. 2016, the Fishpond - the oldest natural marine aquarium in the UK, if not the world - is still a tourist attraction, opened again under new management. The story of Logan Fishpond can be found at the website of Historic Scotland.

Disgusted is the pseudonym of the supposed letter writer, who is a resident of the stereotypically middle-class town of Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in the south-east of England. The term may have originated with either the 1944 BBC radio programme Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh, a regular writer to The Times or an editor of the letters page of a local newspaper, the Tunbridge Wells Advertiser. In later times, the term has continued to be used to describe conservative letter writers who complain to newspapers about a subject that they morally or personally disagree with. It is often used in relation to news stories regarding Royal Tunbridge Wells. Some residents of the town have criticised the term as obsolete, but several continue to embrace it. Origins Royal Tunbridge Wells A \\"stuffy, reactionary image\\" was associated with the town of Tunbridge Wells by the novelist E. M. Forster in his 1908 book A Room with a View, in which the character Charlotte Bartlett says, \\"I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind the times\\". Tunbridge Wells was later granted a royal charter by King Edward VII in 1909 and renamed \\"Royal Tunbridge Wells\\". The BBC radio show Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh, first broadcast in 1944, is sometimes stated in newspaper reports to have popularised the term Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells for correspondence to newspapers. There were also suggestions that the use of Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells came from one regular contributor of letters to The Times in the early 20th century, who would use a particular style of writing to oppose people and organisations who came to his attention. Despite being described as the \\"quintessential Englishman\\" because of his writing style and having his letters regularly published, his identity was never known because he would only identify himself as \\"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\\". However, some reports have popularly rumoured that this person was a retired colonel who served in the British Indian Army during the British Raj. In 2014, the Kent and Sussex Courier claimed that the originator of Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells was the retired British Army colonel George Thomas Howe, who had developed a skill in writing letters about apartheid during five years in the Union of South Africa. Reportedly, his letters were popular reading and helped to sell newspapers that published them. According to the Royal Tunbridge Wells historian and former newspaper editor Frank Chapman, the phrase has a different origin, starting in the 1950s with the staff of the former Tunbridge Wells Advertiser. During the paper's final months of publication, the editor Nigel Chapman, alarmed at a lack of letters from readers, insisted his staff write a few to fill space. One signed his simply \\"Disgusted, Tunbridge Wells\\", and this was then adopted in all future staff letters until the newspaper ceased publication in 1954. The term Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells was later used to stereotype Royal Tunbridge Wells as a town of retired British Army colonels who would write such letters to newspapers. Examples of letters of this type sent to the Advertiser may be found which pre-date these origins, such as: Letters written with a tone of incensed moral outrage have become commonly described as \\"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\\" letters, even though the writer may not be from Royal Tunbridge Wells. For example, the actor Michael Caine once said: \\"I don't want to sound like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, but I do think there should be some sort of national service for young men\\". People writing them have been claimed by commentators to be readers of the Daily Mail, despite the original letters not originating in that publication. Later use The magazine Private Eye made regular use of the Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells pseudonym to satirise the stereotypical conservative Middle Englander, and it became a running joke for several years. In 1978, BBC Radio 4 called its new listener feedback programme Disgusted, Tunbridge Wells, though it was renamed Feedback in 1979. This was following Radio 4 broadcasting the Take It From Here radio series in 1954 where \\"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\\" was prominently featured. In politics, the people behind \\"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\\" letters have strong conservative views and are commonly viewed to support the Conservative Party. However, most UK Independence Party (UKIP) members in the party's early days were viewed by commentators as being \\"'Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells' pensioners\\", of whom the UKIP leader Nigel Farage stated in 2013 \\"... the people in it [UKIP] and who voted for it were in the main 'Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells'. I mean, you look down the membership list in 1994, anyone below a half colonel was a nobody...\\" In 1980, the BBC Radio 2 broadcaster Terry Wogan chaired an \\"It's Your BBC\\" meeting at Royal Tunbridge Wells' Assembly Hall Theatre. A report in The Times suggested the BBC had staged the meeting in the town in the hope that \\"Disgusted\\" would reveal himself. In 2006, the author and magistrate Connie St Louis singled out the \\"disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\\" stereotype as a powerful British middle-class movement, saying \\"they are part of the group with the same concerns, so they have a sense of belonging\\". In 2013, Nigel Cawthorne published Outraged of Tunbridge Wells, a compilation of letters to the Tunbridge Wells Advertiser that were viewed as being in the style of \\"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\\" from the British Library archives. Critical review of the book has stated that the \\"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\\" style displayed an art of letter writing that has continued despite other things in the world changing. Residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells have also expressed displeasure in a manner similar to the \\"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\\" stereotype in relation to the Waitrose supermarket chain refusing to open a store in the town while neighbouring \\"downmarket\\" towns of Tonbridge and Crowborough both did have one. In 2016, during the United Kingdom referendum on the British membership in the European Union, The New York Times used Royal Tunbridge Wells as its base for reporting on the referendum. The town was chosen because it was seen as the \\"quintessentially English town\\" due to the Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells phrase. Although most Americans would not fully understand the reference, the town was nonetheless considered a symbol of middle England. The town is a Conservative stronghold and was the only council area in Kent to vote by a majority for Remain during Brexit. Criticism In 2009, some residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells called the tag \\"inappropriate\\" and \\"stereotypical\\", and asked the town to drop association with it in favour of Delighted of Tunbridge Wells. However, there was opposition to this campaign by other residents, some of whom wrote to newspapers in the \\"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\\" style arguing they preferred Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells. Local merchants at the town's information centre pointed out that tourists were buying twice as many goods bearing Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells than with Delighted of Tunbridge Wells.

The academy was taken over by Delta Academies Trust in October 2018 after being placed into special measures in October 2017.  History  Darton Hall Senior School was opened in the village of Darton in 1935, providing senior education for 560 pupils of both sexes. In 1957, buildings were opened at the current Kexborough site, which then became the boys' campus, with girls remaining at Darton. In the 1970s, preparations for the changes to comprehensive education in the area, combined with the raising of the school leaving age led to considerable developments at the Kexborough campus. By this time, the school catered for 1100 pupils, with the first two years being spent at Darton, before moving to Kexborough.  Campus  The school is located to the north west of Barnsley in the village of Kexbrough on the edge of the open countryside approximately one mile from junction 38 of the M1 motorway. An innovative, state-of-the-art new building opened in February 2011, as part of the government's Building Schools for the Future programme, and the school was renamed Darton College.  Curriculum  Since 2005, the school has been a specialist humanities school. It continues to provide a full curriculum in accordance with the National Curriculum for all pupils.

The mission audio tape establishes several photographs were taken, on Borman's orders, with the enthusiastic concurrence of Jim Lovell and Anders. Anders took the first color shot, then Lovell who notes the setting (1/250th of a second at ), followed by Anders with another very similar shot (AS08-14-2384). A nearly full-page black and white reproduction of Borman's image may be viewed on page 164 of his 1988 autobiography, captioned, \\"One of the most famous pictures in photographic history ‚Äì taken after I grabbed the camera away from Bill Anders\\". Borman was the mission commander and notes that this is the image \\"the Postal Service used on a stamp, and few photographs have been more frequently reproduced\\". The photograph reproduced in the Frank Borman autobiography is not the same image as the Anders photograph; aside from the orientation, the cloud patterns differ. Borman later recanted this story and agreed that the black and white shot was also taken by Anders, based on evidence presented by transcript and a video produced by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio employee, Ernie Wright. The stamp issue reproduces the cloud, color, and crater patterns of the Anders picture. Anders is described by Borman as holding \\"a masters degree in nuclear engineering\\"; Anders was thus tasked as \\"the scientific crew member ... also performing the photography duties that would be so important to the Apollo crew who actually landed on the Moon\\". On the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 8 mission in 2018, Anders described in an interview how the image undermined his religious belief: \\"It really undercut my religious beliefs. The idea that things rotate around the pope and up there is a big supercomputer wondering whether Billy was a good boy yesterday? It doesn't make any sense. I became a big buddy of [atheist scientist] Richard Dawkins.\\"Earthrise: how the iconic image changed the world The Guardian, 2018-12-24.

The craters had previously been designated only with letters.

This computer-generated visualization used data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, which had provided detailed images of the lunar surface that could be matched with those taken every 20 seconds by an automatic camera on Apollo 8. The resulting video, re-creating what the astronauts would have seen (rotated 90 degrees clockwise to match the perspective presented in the photograph), was synchronized with the recording of the crew's conversation as they became the first humans to witness an Earthrise. The video included explanatory narration written and read by Andrew Chaikin. Chaikin writes that all the photographs of the rising Earth on Apollo 8's fourth orbit were taken by Anders.  Potential earthrises as seen from the Moon's surface  Compton crater. Taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2015. The Earth \\"rose\\" because the spacecraft was traveling over the Moon's surface. An earthrise that might be witnessed from the surface of the Moon would be quite unlike moonrises on Earth. Because the Moon is tidally locked with the Earth, one side of the Moon always faces toward Earth. Interpretation of this fact would lead one to believe that the Earth's position is fixed on the lunar sky and no earthrises can occur; however, the Moon librates slightly, which causes the Earth to draw a Lissajous figure on the sky. This figure fits inside a rectangle 15¬∞48' wide and 13¬∞20' high (in angular dimensions), while the angular diameter of the Earth as seen from Moon is only about 2¬∞. This means that earthrises are visible near the edge of the Earth-observable surface of the Moon (about 20% of the surface). Since a full libration cycle takes about 27 days, earthrises are very slow, and it takes about 48 hours for Earth to clear its diameter. During the course of the month-long lunar orbit, an observer would additionally witness a succession of \\"Earth phases\\", much like the lunar phases seen from Earth. That is what accounts for the half- illuminated globe, the ashen glow, seen in the photograph.

It is demersal in nature and inhabits the upper continental slope at a depth of . A small, slender species growing no longer than , the northern sawtail catshark is characterized by a series of dark, narrow saddles along its back and tail, and rows of prominently enlarged dermal denticles along the upper edge of its caudal fin and the underside of its caudal peduncle. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough information to assess its conservation status. Taxonomy The first known specimens of the northern sawtail catshark were collected during exploratory surveys conducted off northeastern Australia in the 1980s, and provisionally termed Galeus sp. B. It was formally described by Daniel Gledhill, Peter Last, and William White in a 2008 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) publication, in which they also resurrected the genus Figaro, until then considered a junior synonym of Galeus. The specific epithet striatus means \\"striped\\" in Latin. The type specimen is a long adult male caught south of the Saumarez Reefs, Queensland, on November 17, 1985. Distribution and habitat The range of the northern sawtail catshark is limited to the upper continental slope off Queensland, between Rockhampton and Townsville. It is found on or near the bottom at a depth of . Description Reaching in length, the northern sawtail catshark has a firm, thin body with a mostly cylindrical cross-section. The head is short, narrow, and flattened, with a bluntly pointed snout. The eyes are horizontally oval and equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids); beneath each is a narrow ridge, and behind is a tiny spiracle. The anterior rims of the nostrils are enlarged into triangular, outward-pointing flaps. The mouth is large and arched, with short but prominent furrows around each corner. There are around 65 upper and 61‚Äì65 lower tooth rows; each tooth has a narrow central cusp flanked by 3‚Äì5 smaller cusplets. There are five pairs of gill slits; the fourth and fifth are located over the pectoral fin bases and closer together than the others. The small dorsal fins have blunt apexes and straight to gently convex trailing margins; the first is slightly taller but shorter- based than the second. The origin of the first and second dorsal fins lie over the rear of the pelvic fins and anal fin respectively. The pectoral fins are small and broad, with rounded corners. The pelvic fins are long and low; adult males have slender claspers and a slight \\"apron\\" formed from the fusion of the pelvic fin inner margins. The anal fin is elongated, its base measuring roughly a tenth of the total length, and rather angular. The length of the anal fin base exceeds the distance between the anal and pelvic fins, and is comparable to the distance between the dorsal fins. The caudal fin is short and low, with a small lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The body and fins are entirely covered by minute, overlapping dermal denticles; each has an ovoid crown with a horizontal ridge leading to a marginal cusp. There are distinctive crests of enlarged, spiny denticles along the anterior half of the caudal fin upper margin, and beneath the caudal peduncle. This species is light grayish brown on the back of the body and tail, with a series of dark brown saddles numbering 10‚Äì16 before the dorsal fins, of which a few are wider than the others. The flanks, underside, and fins are whitish. Biology and ecology Little is known of the natural history of the northern sawtail catshark. Males attain sexual maturity at approximately long. Human interactions The International Union for Conservation of Nature has noted that there is minimal fishing activity within the northern sawtail catshark's range, but presently lacks sufficient information to assess it beyond Data Deficient.

The migration occurs when organisms move up to the uppermost layer of the sea at night and return to the bottom of the daylight zone of the oceans or to the dense, bottom layer of lakes during the day. The word diel comes from the Latin dies day, and means a 24-hour period. In terms of biomass, it is the greatest migration in the world. It is not restricted to any one taxon as examples are known from crustaceans (copepods), molluscs (squid), and ray-finned fishes (trout). Various stimuli are responsible for this phenomenon, the most prominent being response to changes in light intensity, though evidence suggests that biological clocks are an underlying stimulus as well. The phenomenon may arise for a number of reasons, though it is most typically to access food and avoid predators. While this mass migration is generally nocturnal, with the animals ascending from the depths at nightfall and descending at sunrise, the timing can be altered in response to the different cues and stimuli that trigger it. Some unusual events impact vertical migration: DVM is absent during the midnight sun in Arctic regions and vertical migration can occur suddenly during a solar eclipse. Discovery During World War II the U.S. Navy was taking sonar readings of the ocean when they discovered the deep scattering layer (DSL). While performing sound propagation experiments, the University of California's Division of War Research (UCDWR) consistently had results of the echo-sounder that showed a distinct reverberation that they attributed to mid-water layer scattering agents. At the time, there was speculation that these readings may be attributed to enemy submarines. By collaborating with biologists from Scripps Institution and the UCDWR, they were able to confirm that the observed reverberations from the echo-sounder were in fact related to the diel vertical migration of marine animals. The DSL was caused by large, dense groupings of organisms, like zooplankton, that scattered the sonar to create a false or second bottom. Once scientists started to do more research on what was causing the DSL, it was discovered that a large range of organisms were vertically migrating. Most types of plankton and some types of nekton have exhibited some type of vertical migration, although it is not always diel. These migrations may have substantial effects on mesopredators and apex predators by modulating the concentration and accessibility of their prey (e.g., impacts on the foraging behavior of pinnipeds). Types of vertical migration ;Diel:This is the most common form of vertical migration. Organisms migrate on a daily basis through different depths in the water column. Migration usually occurs between shallow surface waters of the epipelagic zone and deeper mesopelagic zone of the ocean or hypolimnion zone of lakes.: Furthermore, there are three recognized types of diel vertical migration. This includes nocturnal vertical migration, the most common form, where organisms ascend to the surface around dusk, remaining at the surface for the night, then migrating to depth again around dawn. The second form is reverse migration, which occurs with organisms ascending to the surface at sunrise and remaining high in the water column throughout the day until descending with the setting sun. The third form is twilight diel vertical migration, involving two separate migrations in a single 24-hour period, with the first ascent at dusk followed by a descent at midnight, often known as the \\"midnight sink\\". The second ascent to the surface and descent to the depths occurs at sunrise. ;Seasonal:Organisms are found at different depths depending on what season it is. Seasonal changes to the environment may influence changes to migration patterns. Normal diel vertical migration occurs in species of foraminifera throughout the year in the polar regions; however, during the midnight sun, no differential light cues exist so they remain at the surface to feed upon the abundant phytoplankton, or to facilitate photosynthesis by their symbionts. ;Ontogenetic:Organisms spend different stages of their life cycle at different depths. There are often pronounced differences in migration patterns of adult female copepods, like Eurytemora affinis, which stay at depth with only a small upward movement at night, compared to the rest of its life stages which migrate over 10 meters. In addition, there is a trend seen in other copepods, like Acartia spp. that have an increasing amplitude of their DVM seen with their progressive life stages. This is possibly due to increasing body size of the copepods and the associated risk of visual predators, like fish, as being larger makes them more noticeable. Vertical migration stimuli There are two different factors that are known to play a role in vertical migration, endogenous and exogenous. Endogenous factors originate from the organism itself; sex, age, biological rhythms, etc. Exogenous factors are environmental factors acting on the organism such as light, gravity, oxygen, temperature, predator-prey interactions, etc. = Endogenous factors = Endogenous rhythm Biological clocks are an ancient and adaptive sense of time innate to an organism that allows them to anticipate environmental changes and cycles so they are able to physiologically and behaviorally respond to the expected change. Evidence of circadian rhythms controlling DVM, metabolism, and even gene expression have been found in copepod species, Calanus finmarchicus. These copepods were shown to continue to exhibit these daily rhythms of vertical migration in the laboratory setting even in constant darkness, after being captured from an actively migrating wild population. An experiment was done at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography which kept organisms in column tanks with light/dark cycles. A few days later the light was changed to a constant low light and the organisms still displayed diel vertical migration. This suggests that some type of internal response was causing the migration. Clock gene expression Many organisms including the copepod C. finmarchicus, has genetic material devoted to maintaining its biological clock. The expression of these genes varies temporally with the expression significantly increasing following dawn and dusk at times of greatest vertical migration seen in this species. These findings may indicate they work as a molecular stimulus for vertical migration. Body size The relative body size of an organism has been found to effect DVM. Bull trout express daily and seasonal vertical migrations with smaller individuals always staying at a deeper layer than the larger individuals. This is most likely due to a predation risk, but is dependent on the individuals own size such that smaller animals may be more inclined to remain at depth. =Exogenous factors= Light Light is the most common and critical cue for vertical migration. Organisms want to find an optimum light intensity (isolume). Whether it is no light or a large amount of light, an organism will travel to where it is most comfortable. Studies have shown that during a full moon organisms will not migrate up as far, and that during an eclipse they will start to migrate. Temperature Organisms will migrate to a water depth with temperatures that best suit the organisms needs, for example some fish species migrate to warmer surface waters in order to aid digestion. Temperature changes can influence swimming behavior of some copepods. In the presence of a strong thermocline some zooplankton may be inclined to pass through it, and migrate to the surface waters, though this can be very variable even in a single species. The marine copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, will migrate through gradients with temperature differences of 6 ¬∞C over George's Bank; whereas, in the North Sea they are observed to remain below the gradient. Salinity Changes in salinity may promote organism to seek out more suitable waters if they happen to be stenohaline or unequipped to handle regulating their osmotic pressure. Areas that are impacted by tidal cycles accompanied by salinity changes, estuaries for example, may see vertical migration in some species of zooplankton. In areas such as the Arctic, melting ice causes a layer of freshwater which organisms cannot cross. Pressure Pressure changes have been found to produce differential responses that result in vertical migration. many zooplankton will react to increased pressure with positive phototaxis, a negative geotaxis, and/or a kinetic response that results in ascending in the water column. Likewise, when there is a decrease in pressure, the zoo plankton respond by passively sinking or active downward swimming to descend in the water column. Predator kairomones A predator might release a chemical cue which could cause its prey to vertically migrate away. This may stimulate the prey to vertically migrate to avoid said predator. The introduction of a potential predator species, like a fish, to the habitat of diel vertical migrating zooplankton has been shown to influence the distribution patterns seen in their migration. For example, a study used Daphnia and a fish that was too small to prey of them (Lebistus reticulatus), found that with the introduction of the fish to the system the Daphnia remained below the thermocline, where the fish was not present. This demonstrates the effects of kairomones on Daphnia DVM. Tidal patterns Some organisms have been found to move with the tidal cycle. A study looked at the abundance of a species of small shrimp, Acetes sibogae, and found that they tended to move further higher in the water column and in higher numbers during flood tides than during ebb tides experiences at the mouth of an estuary. It is possible that varying factors with the tides may be the true trigger for the migration rather than the movement of the water itself, like the salinity or minute pressure changes. Reasons for vertical migration There are many hypotheses as to why organisms would vertically migrate, and several may be valid at any given time. ;Predator avoidance: Light-dependent predation by fish is a common pressure that causes DVM behavior in zooplankton. A given body of water may be viewed as a risk gradient whereby the surface layers are riskier to reside in during the day than deep water, and as such promotes varied longevity among zooplankton that settle at different daytime depths. Indeed, in many instances it is advantageous for zooplankton to migrate to deep waters during the day to avoid predation and come up to the surface at night to feed. ;Metabolic advantages: By feeding in the warm surface waters at night and residing in the cooler deep waters during the day they can conserve energy. Alternatively, organisms feeding on the bottom in cold water during the day may migrate to surface waters at night in order to digest their meal at warmer temperatures. ;Dispersal and transport: Organisms can use deep and shallow currents to find food patches or to maintain a geographical location. ;Avoid UV damage: The sunlight can penetrate into the water column. If an organism, especially something small like a microbe, is too close to the surface the UV can damage them. So they would want to avoid getting too close to the surface, especially during daylight. Water transparency A recent theory of DVM, termed the Transparency Regulator Hypothesis, argues that water transparency is the ultimate variable that determines the exogenous factor (or combination of factors) that causes DVM behavior in a given environment. In less transparent waters, where fish are present and more food is available, fish tend to be the main driver of DVM. In more transparent bodies of water, where fish are less numerous and food quality improves in deeper waters, UV light can travel farther, thus functioning as the main driver of DVM in such cases.  Unusual events  Due to the particular types of stimuli and cues used to initiate vertical migration, anomalies can change the pattern drastically. For example, the occurrence of midnight sun in the Arctic induces changes to planktonic life that would normally perform DVM with a 24-hour night and day cycle. In the summers of the Arctic the Earth's north pole is directed toward the sun creating longer days and at the high latitude continuous day light for more than 24-hours. Species of foraminifera found in the ocean cease their DVM pattern, and rather remain at the surface in favor of feeding on the phytoplankton, for example Neogloboquadrina pachyderma, and for those species that contain symbionts, like Turborotalita quinqueloba, remain in sunlight to aid photosynthesis. There is also evidence of changes to vertical migration patterns during solar eclipse events. In the moments that the sun is obscured during normal day light hours, there is a sudden dramatic decrease in light intensity. The decreased light intensity, replicates the typical lighting experienced at night time that stimulate the planktonic organisms to migrate. During an eclipse, some copepod species distribution is concentrated near the surface, for example Calanus finmarchicus displays a classic diurnal migration pattern but on a much shorter time scale during an eclipse. Importance for the biological pump The biological pump is the conversion of CO2 and inorganic nutrients by plant photosynthesis into particulate organic matter in the euphotic zone and transference to the deeper ocean. This is a major process in the ocean and without vertical migration it wouldn't be nearly as efficient. The deep ocean gets most of its nutrients from the higher water column when they sink down in the form of marine snow. This is made up of dead or dying animals and microbes, fecal matter, sand and other inorganic material. Organisms migrate up to feed at night so when they migrate back to depth during the day they defecate large sinking fecal pellets. Whilst some larger fecal pellets can sink quite fast, the speed that organisms move back to depth is still faster. At night organisms are in the top 100 metres of the water column, but during the day they move down to between 800‚Äì1000 meters. If organisms were to defecate at the surface it would take the fecal pellets days to reach the depth that they reach in a matter of hours. Therefore, by releasing fecal pellets at depth they have almost 1000 metres less to travel to get to the deep ocean. This is something known as active transport. The organisms are playing a more active role in moving organic matter down to depths. Because a large majority of the deep sea, especially marine microbes, depends on nutrients falling down, the quicker they can reach the ocean floor the better. Zooplankton and salps play a large role in the active transport of fecal pellets. 15‚Äì50% of zooplankton biomass is estimated to migrate, accounting for the transport of 5‚Äì45% of particulate organic nitrogen to depth. Salps are large gelatinous plankton that can vertically migrate 800 meters and eat large amounts of food at the surface. They have a very long gut retention time, so fecal pellets usually are released at maximum depth. Salps are also known for having some of the largest fecal pellets. Because of this they have a very fast sinking rate, small detritus particles are known to aggregate on them. This makes them sink that much faster. So while currently there is still much research being done on why organisms vertically migrate, it is clear that vertical migration plays a large role in the active transport of dissolved organic matter to depth.

Subsequent investigation revealed that she had been placed under suicide watch after refusing further participation in interrogation sessions which she said constituted torture of Iraqi prisoners. \\"On opposite poles: two Mormons on torture\\" According to a report into the investigation into her death: Just before her death, Peterson spoke to another intelligence specialist, Kayla Williams, about her concerns. According to the Huffington Post, Williams also was forced to take part in torture interrogations during which detainees were assaulted, stripped, blindfolded, and then confronted with a female interrogator. It is also reported that interrogation included cramped confinement, stress position, sleep deprivation, insects placed in a confinement box and waterboarding. She refused to participate in this, according to journalist Ann Wright, \\"for saying no to torture, is dead, perhaps by her own hand\\". Peterson's body was returned to Flagstaff, Arizona in late September 2003, where she was buried with full military honors at Citizens Cemetery.

In the 20th century, however, a policy shift became apparent. Brothels became illegal in 1946, and France signed the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others in 1960. France thus became a major supporter of the international abolitionist movement for the eradication of prostitution (see Abolitionism in France).

Prostitutes were not marginalized, but integrated into society where they had a role to play. In stories (which were often ribald), prostitutes would be complicit with other women in avenging men.

Fabula; Feb 7 2008 and opening hours of the maisons (10‚Äì6, or 10‚Äì8 in Paris). Charlemagne (768‚Äì814 AD) was amongst those rulers who attempted to suppress prostitution, declaring flogging (300 lashes) as a punishment in his capitularies. This was primarily aimed at the common man, since harems and concubines were common amongst the ruling classes. Some idea of the seriousness with which the state regarded the offense is provided by the fact that 300 lashes was the severest sentence prescribed by the Code Alaric. Offenders also had their hair cut off, and in the case of recidivism, could be sold as slaves. There is no evidence that any of this was effective. Under Philip II (1180‚Äì1223) an irregular militia, the Ribaud were created in 1189 to police prostitution and gambling, headed by a Roi des Ribauds, but abolished by Philip IV (1285‚Äì1314) due to their licentiousness.  Saint Louis IX (1226‚Äì1270)  In the interim, Louis IX (1226‚Äì1270) attempted to ban prostitution in December 1254, with disastrous social consequences and widespread protests. The decree ordered the expulsion of all \\"women of evil life\\" from the kingdom and confiscation of their belongings, but simply drove the trade underground. Eventually he was forced to revoke this by 1256. Although still railing against women who were \\"free with their bodies and other common harlots\\", he acknowledged the pragmatic desirability of housing them away from respectable streets and religious establishments, and so obliged them to reside outside of the borders of the city walls. His resolve to do away with prostitution was affirmed in a letter of 1269 to the regents, as he set out on the Eighth Crusade, in which he refers to the need to extirpate the evil, root and branch. The punishment for infraction was an 8 sous fine and risking imprisonment in the Ch√¢telet (see below). He designated nine streets in which prostitution would be allowed in Paris, three of them being in the sarcastically named Beaubourg quartier (Beautiful Neighbourhood) (Rue de la Huchette, Rue Froimon, Rue du Renard-Saint-Merri, Rue Taille pain, Rue Brisemiches, Rue Champ-Fleury, Rue Trace-putain, Rue Gratte-cul, and the Rue Tire-Putain) (see below)Jacques Rossiaud. Medieval Prostitution; trans. Lydia G. Cochrane, New York, 1988 Today, this area corresponds to the 1st-4th arrondissements clustered on the Rive Droite (right bank) of the Seine (see map).

Retrieved 3 August 2007. The appearance of syphilis at the end of the 15th century had stigmatized these houses by the end of the 16th century, but their continued existence was confirmed by King Henry IV (1589‚Äì1610).Die Schliessung der \\"Maisons closes\\" lag im Zug der Zeit, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 15 October 1996. = R√©glementation (Regulation) = Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Salon de la rue des Moulins, 1894, now housed in the Mus√©e Toulouse-Lautrec at the In 1804 Napoleon ordered the registration and bi-weekly health inspection of all prostitutes. State controlled legal brothels (then known as \\"maisons de tol√©rance\\" or \\"maisons closes\\") started to appear in Paris and in other cities and became highly popular throughout the century. By 1810, Paris alone had 180 officially approved brothels. By law, they had to be run by a woman (typically a former prostitute) and their external appearance had to be discreet. Prostitutes working in the maisons, or any woman arrested twice for soliciting had to be registered as such.Kiedrowski, J.S., & Van Dijk, J.M. (1984). Working papers on Pornography and Prostitution Report 1. Pornography and prostitution in Denmark, France, West Germany, The Netherlands and Sweden, Ottawa: Department of Justice Canada. pp. 14-15 Registration involved having their name on a national register, and agreeing to abide by the regulations and twice weekly medical examinations.Scibelli, Pasqua (1987). Empowering prostitutes: A proposal for international legal reform. Harvard Women's Law Journal, 10, 117‚Äì157 This pattern of regulation rapidly spread throughout Europe, partly aided by the Napoleonic occupations. Among the most expensive and best known maisons de tol√©rance in Paris were: * le Chabanais (opened 1878 and favored by Prince Edward, who had himself made a special \\"love seat\\" there),Dirty Bertie's seat of pleasure, The Times, 17 January 2004 * le Sphinx, * la Rue des Moulins, * le One-Two-Two(opened in the mid-1920s and soon became the top address) * Hotel Marigny was the best known brothel for male homosexual clients; it opened in 1917 near Opera in the second arrondissement More sordid brothels, the maisons d'abattage, offering quick and dirty \\"services\\", were popular amongst the lower-class. The 19th century was also the time of several fabulously rich courtesans in Paris, with La Pa√Øva being the most famous one.  World War I  A group of filles de joie in Marseille, 1919 During World War I, in Paris alone, US Army officials estimated that there were 40 major brothels, 5,000 professionally licensed streetwalkers, and another 70,000 unlicensed prostitutes. By 1917, there were at least 137 such establishments across 35 towns on or close to the Western front. The British Army adopted local codes of ethics when fighting in another country, and so allowed troops on rest periods and days off to visit what became termed maisons tol√©r√©es. Such activity was not just tolerated but encouraged for both the young, as well as the married men who were missing their wives. As the war advanced, so did the need and rank of the prostitutes entertained. While British troops paid just six pence per day were often found in the lowest priced institutes, dominion soldiers from Australia, New Zealand, and Canada received six shillings and could afford higher-class \\"services\\". British officers preferred to \\"always indulge with armour (condoms)\\" and took to patronizing German Army officers' former prostitutes when the lines of conflict were advancing towards the end of the war, with the advantage that they sometimes gained tactical and strategic information as well. It is unknown how many or what percentage of men visited the institutions, but the French army recorded over a million cases of gonorrhea and syphilis during the war. In 1915, in Le Havre, a survey undertaken by the Royal Army Medical Corps counted 171,000 uniformed British Army visitors to the brothels in just one street. As a result, rates of venereal disease began to climb, with 23,000 British Army men at any time on average during the second half of the campaign hospitalized for treatment, with over 150,000 British soldiers having been infected by the end of the war. The disease at the time had a high social stigma, but a particularly bad infection could get a soldier medically discharged from frontline duty, even on a temporary basis. Syphilis was treated with injections of mercury, administered at a hospital over a 30-day period, thereby guaranteeing escape from the frontline. The result was that some prostitutes with particularly bad VD infections could charge more. Every British army unit had a sexually transmitted disease clinic, where soldiers could gain an ointment consisting of mercury and chlorine to prevent VD infection, or receive a urethral irrigation with potassium permanganate after STI exposure. The US Army attitude was different, driven by a reformist attitude at home. In October 1917, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker said: Aided by the American Social Hygiene Organization, he closed so called segregated zones close to Army training camps, which included closing the notorious Storyville district in New Orleans. When the two million soldiers of the American Expeditionary Force had been deployed to France, they were guided by a bulletin from AEF commander Gen. John Pershing to just say no: This was backed up by additional posters and pamphlets that read \\"You wouldn't use another fellow's tooth-brush, so why use his whore?\\" and \\"A Soldier Who Gets a Dose Is a Traitor!\\" The US Army had clear instructions on those who did not follow the no indulgence rule. US Army regulations required soldiers who admitted to having sex while on leave to submit to chemical prophylaxis, that included irrigating the penis. Soldiers who did not report for prophylaxis and later contracted VD were subject to court-martial and possibly a hard-labor sentence, while those who contracted disease after treatment only lost pay during treatment. Implemented from the first day of training, the initiative was so successful that US Army doctors reported that 96% of the cases they treated had been contracted while the soldier was still a civilian. However, on debarkation at the designated port of St. Nazaire, a dispute with French authorities broke out, after the AEF placed the Maisons Tol√©r√©e off limits. With the dispute escalating, President Georges Clemenceau sent a memo to Gen. Pershing offering a compromise: American medical authorities would control designated brothels operated solely for American soldiers. Pershing passed the proposal to Raymond Fosdick, who gave it to Secretary Baker. Upon receiving it, Baker responded: \\"For God's sake, Raymond, don't show this to the president or he'll stop the war.\\" The French later proposed a deal that targeted the Black American troops, most of whom were assigned to unloading freight in segregated stevedore battalions, again flatly turned down by US authorities. But this merely highlighted US differential racial policy, as all black troops were required by US Army regulations to undertake prophylaxis when returning from leave, whether or not they acknowledged sexual contact. The policy adopted by the US Army worked, with far lower rates of VD across their troops compared to French or British and Dominion combatants. However, after the signing of the Armistice, when the US Army could no longer plead military necessity as grounds for curtailing leave, VD rates among US Army troops shot up.  World War II  During World War II, Dr Edith Sumerskill raised the issue of Maisons Tol√©r√©es in Parliament to Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden after the intervention of the British Expeditionary Force. Further questions were raised in Parliament after the D-Day invasion, to ensure such local practises and medical precautions were continued. During the German occupation of France, twenty top Paris maisons, including le Chabanais, le Sphinx and le One-Two-Two, were reserved by the Wehrmacht for German officers and collaborating Frenchmen. The brothels flourished during this time, and Hermann G√∂ring visited Le Chabanais, as is related in the 2009 two-volume book 1940-1945 Ann√©es Erotiques by Patrick Buisson. = Abolitionism in France =  Loi de Marthe Richard (1946)  After the war, Marthe Richard, a town councillor in Paris and former street prostitute, successfully campaigned for the closure of all \\"maisons\\". On 13 April 1946, the \\"loi de Marthe Richard\\" was passed with votes of the Christian-Democratic Party (MRP) and the Communist Party (PCF).. The latter considered brothels to be \\"bourgeois\\". As a result, the legal brothels were closed. (This serves as a plot point in the first James Bond novel, Casino Royale.) However, prostitution remained a legal activity, with only its organization and \\"exploitation\\" (pimping) forbidden. This ended a system in existence since 1804, which effectively made prostitutes less visible without suppressing the trade, and thus preservied \\"public morality\\". Prostitute registries were supposed to be destroyed, but police kept files till 1960. Roughly 20,000 women were affected by this law, and approximately 1,400 houses were closed. Many former brothel owners soon opened \\"h√¥tels de passe\\" instead, where prostitutes could keep on working, but the visibility of their activities was reduced. Critics of French prostitution policy, such as Mouvement du Nid, question how effective this was, its implementation, and whether it really closed the \\"maisons\\". For instance, they point to the presence of military brothels in Algeria till 1960. In 1958, the Office central pour la r√©pression de la traite des √™tres humains (OCRTEH) was created as a branch of the police, to combat pimping and cooperate with Interpol. It is under the direction of the Minister of the Interior.  1960: Ratification of 1949 UN Convention  France became officially \\"abolitionist\\" in 1960 when it ratified the 1949 UN Convention on the Suppression of Trafficking and the Exploitation of Prostitution.  State policy from 1960  In the debates over prostitution in France, \\"abolition\\" was used to refer to both the abolition of laws and regulations that make any distinction between someone involved in prostitution and the general population, and the abolition of prostitution itself. At that time, police files on prostitutes were finally destroyed. However, implementation varied considerably locally, although prostitution was rarely on the political agenda over the next 30 years. Exceptions were the demonstrations of prostitutes rights movements against police harassment in 1975, and periodic calls by individual politicians for re-opening the \\"maisons\\" (see Maisons closes below). These included that of (RPR), a former Minister of health (1986‚Äì1988) in 1990, as a public health measure, given the concerns about HIV/AIDS. State policy has been built on two principles - criminalization, and support. Criminalization of the exploitation (brothels, procuring, pimping) of prostitution, and support and re-integration for those exiting. However, the latter attracted few funds, and was largely left to charitable NGOs. Only a single position within the Department of Social Services had responsibility for this part of policy and funding. The original intention was that the Departments would set up their own Prevention and Rehabilitation Services, but of 100, only 12 were created following the 1960 ordinance, and by 1999, there were only 5, run by NGOs. Other state responsibilities have fallen to the women's rights administration, and also to health, finance, interior, foreign, and education ministries from time to time.  Penal Code 1994  In the new Penal Code, pimping became a serious offence if associated with organized crime or barbarity, and overall was defined at three levels of severity with increasing fines, and prison sentences from five years up to life imprisonment. Clients were only criminalized if purchasing from minors under 15 years of age. In 1998, sex tourism was added if offences against minors were committed by French residents outside France.  International policy  In the 1990s, France became increasingly assertive internationally as a champion of abolitionism, opposing moves towards liberalization and regulation by the Netherlands and the International Labour Organization.The Sex Sector: The economic and social bases of prostitution in Southeast Asia edited by Lin Lean Lim, International Labour Office, Geneva, 1998. France also opposed the distinction between 'free' and 'forced' prostitution in international discussions. Hubert V√©drine the foreign minister asserted France's position at various international venues, such as the protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale and prostitution of children and child pornography (2000) and the Convention on organized crime with the protocol on trafficking (Palermo 2000). French policy emphasised, along with the International Convention, that the real evil was prostitution, not trafficking, defined as an \\"accompanying evil\\". At the same time, Nicole P√©ry, minister for women's rights (Secr√©taire d'√âtat aux droits des femmes; 1998‚Äì2002), included prostitution in her department's campaign on violence against women, calling it a form of violence at Beijing+5, (New York 2000).P√©ry N.

Loi Sarkozy (Loi pour la s√©curit√© int√©rieure) 2003  Active solicitation was also outlawed in the late 1940s. Passive solicitation (being present with revealing clothes at locations known for prostitution) was outlawed in 2003 as part of a package of law-and-order measures by then-interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, in his \\"Domestic Security Bill\\" (loi pour la s√©curit√© int√©rieure 2003, or LSI also known as Loi Sarkozy II), and had the effect of reducing the visibility of prostitution on the streets.Loi pour la s√©curit√© int√©rieure de 2003 Wikipedia Prostitutes' organizations decried the measure, which came into force in March 2003, calling it punitive and fated to increase the power of pimps.French police turn attention to 'the pimp on the corner' , The Independent, 21 March 2005 Many prostitutes started to work out of vans, a strategy authorities attempted to combat by using parking regulation enforcement. The law has been abrogated in 2016 (see below).  Law 444 (2016)  Law number 2016-444 \\"visant √† renforcer la lutte contre le syst√®me prostitutionnel et √† accompagner les personnes prostitu√©es\\" (Eng.: \\"to strengthen the fight against the prostitution system and to support prostituted persons\\") was enacted on 6 April 2016, with effect from 13 April 2016. The most publicised provision of this law is that the buying of sexual acts was made illegal and punishable with a fine of up to ‚Ç¨3,750 if the prostitute is an adult. Buying a sexual act to an underage prostitute ups it to 3 years of jail and fine of 45 000 ‚Ç¨. However, the bulk of this law is concerned with supporting prostitutes exiting the industry and supporting victims of sex trafficking. The law also abrogated the previous law about passive solicitation. In the first six months after the law was enacted, 249 men were prosecuted for purchasing sexual acts. Legal status It is legal for a man or woman to be a prostitute and sell sexual acts.\\"SOS Femmes Accueil - Prostitution - Le cadre juridique en France\\" English Version The buying of sexual acts was outlawed in April 2016. Prostitutes pay taxes as other independent activitiesLe Regime Juridique De La Prostitution Feminine Owning or operating a brothel is illegal. All forms of prox√©n√©tisme (procuring) are illegal.\\"Article 225-5 of the Code P√©nal (partie l√©gislative)\\" on Legifrance. Prox√©n√©tisme is defined as: * \\"helping\\" someone to prostitute themselves * profiting from the prostitution of another person, or receiving funds from someone who prostitutes themselves habitually (living off the avails) * hiring or training someone to prostitute themselves, or pressuring someone to prostitute themselves.La loi francaise. Mouvement du Nid Politics France is an \\"abolitionist\\" country - its public policy is the prohibition and eradication of prostitution; however, at the same time, it considers that making it illegal to offer sexual acts in return for goods or services in the context of one's private life is a violation of individual liberty. The issue has been prominent on the French political agenda since the late 1990s, responding to international pressures on child prostitution and pornography and trafficking, international distinctions between forced and voluntary entry into prostitution (rejected by the dominant \\"abolitionist\\" discourse) and increasing migration. This has been accompanied by increasing discourse on la s√©curit√© internally, which has gradually become dominant, affecting the framework in which prostitution is debated. This was heightened in 2002 when Jean-Pierre Raffarin's right-wing government (2002‚Äì2005) succeeded the Gauche Plurielle (plural left) coalition of Lionel Jospin (1997‚Äì2002). The Jospin construction was that prostitutes were victims and needed to be saved and re- integrated. This was a view shared by state feminists, ministers, delegates, and the powerful abolitionist lobby, and is reflected in the Derycke report as well as the National Commission on Violence Against Women, as well as the debates on modern slavery (esclavage moderne). These consultations in turn enabled agents of the civil society access to the policy process. Very few of these constructed prostitution as a legitimate form of work. At the municipal level, there was evidence of prostitutes being constructed as public nuisances that needed to be confined, and many mayors of both political groups responded to citizen groups to introduce by-laws restricting prostitutes' activities in early 2002. This was fuelled by an apparent increased visibility. For instance, Fran√ßoise de Panafieu (UMP delegate 17th arondissement) campaigned against street prostitution in the summer of 2002. The commitment to abolitionism prevented specific laws aimed at prostitution (which would have been seen as regulation) initially, so they often used traffic and parking by- laws to drive out workers, which ultimately mean that they were moved from well-lit busy areas to much more unsafe areas. As the discourse shifted from abolitionism to security, so did more explicit laws and regulations. This disquiet enabled Nicolas Sarkozy to later mobilize public anxiety about security evident in the elections that year in his Domestic Security bill. The cultural context is the concept of gender equality as stated in the preamble to the 1946 and 1958 constitution and which had seen an increasing momentum of political gains for women, including the establishment of a women's policy agency in 1974 and a ministry of women's rights in 1981. However, a significant gap still exists in terms of economic and employment opportunities. Meanwhile, immigration policies have become increasingly restrictive, and soliciting can result in the removal of a migrant's work permit. The 2007 Socialist Party Manifesto calls for holding clients \\"responsible\\". The vague language is due to the fact that such measures remain controversial in the Socialist Party.\\"Prostitution : le PS veut p√©naliser les clients\\" Coignard, Jacqueline. Lib√©ration. 6 July 2006. The Manifesto also calls for repealing the ban on \\"passive solicitation\\". In 2010, Chantal Brunel, an MP in Sarkozy's ruling right-wing UMP party, and newly appointed head of the equality office, called for legalizing and regulating maisons closes (brothels), (see Maisons closes, below) akin to the situation in several surrounding countries, claiming that this would make the sex trade safer and transparent. She outlined the strategy in her 2010 book \\"Pour en finir avec les violences faites aux femmes\\" (An end to violence against women). This caused considerable discussion. French prostitutes are opposed to this plan to legalize and regulate maisons, arguing that it would limit their options to make their own decisions‚Äîdozens of French prostitutes have marched to protest the proposal to legalize brothels. Instead, they demand the repeal of the 2003 law outlawing solication, a demand that Chantal Brunel also supports. In June 2012, the socialist women's minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem announced that she wanted to abolish prostitution in France and in Europe. = State feminism = State feminists dominated the discourse in the left-wing Jospin years, pursuing an anti-male-violence campaign. As Women's Minister, Nicole P√©ry, confirmed in her New York speech (see above), prostitution, as a form of male violence, was very much part of that State strategy. This influence has waned under the security agenda of the succeeding right-wing governments, but is still evident in the new political thinking, as stated in Marie-Jo Zimmermann's (UMP) 2002 report to the Delegation on Women's Rights on prostitution in which she echoes the left wing sentiment that the purchase of sex constitutes violence. The pervasiveness of this thinking is even found in the budget.Projet de loi des finances pour 2004 √âtat des cr√©dits qui concourent aux actions en faveur des droits des femmes  Political and social debates  As in many other countries, debates on the nature and regulation of transactional sex are highly polarized. These positions are the familiar ones that define sex work as violence against women on the one hand, and those who see the problem as stigmatisation and poor working conditions on the other. These result in proposals for either the eradication of prostitution, or social reforms. The dominant abolitionist faction consists of Catholics, family values advocates and sections within feminism and the left. As elsewhere, the term abolitionism has seen a shift from the abolition of R√©glementation to include abolition of sexual slavery. From the abolition of R√©glementation and the maisons closes (1946) to the late 1990s, there was a broad abolitionist consensus. This resulted from a close fit between the government position and the dominant socio-political discourse, making it acceptable to a broad coalition that included abolitionists, secular and religious NGOs, politicians from both ends of the political spectrum, and most French feminists. This was so dominant under the Jospin years as to appear normative and non-ideological and above any philosophical debate. This provides abolitionists access to both the policy process and to resources, such as the 2000 UNESCO conference (see below), which had high-profile support, including important left-wing figures such as Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement and Sylviane Agacinski, who was also married to Lionel Jospin. In the 1990s, a number of changes shifted the focus of debates. These included an increasing globalization of movements on both parts of the debate, Sweden and the Netherlands were moving to change their legislation in two distinct and different directions, there was political instability in Eastern Europe and there was also increasing concern about AIDS, while state feminists were also playing an increasing part in policy debates. There were however occasional dissenting voices such as the debate in Le Nouvel Observateur in 1999, sparked by the Dutch legislation. = The 2000 manifestations = A manifestation of abolitionism was the declaration of 18 May 2000, published in the centre-left Le Nouvel Observateur, called \\"Le corps n'est pas une marchandise\\" (\\"The body is not a commodity\\"). This was signed by 35 prominent citizens, and demanded that France and Europe affirm their commitment to the abolition of prostitution, resulting in a debate covering many aspects of the subject, such as choice, autonomy, voice, and agency. Signatories included Francois Hollande, Robert Hue, Dominique Voynet, Isabelle Alonso, Boris Cyrulnik, Fran√ßoise H√©ritier, and Antoinette Fouque.Antoinette Fouque et al.,\\"La prostitution : Les nouvelles mafias du sexe\\" (Le corps n'est pas une marchandise) Le Nouvel Observateur may 18 au 4 2000 n¬∞ 1854Bruckner P, Fleury C, Roudinesco E, Laguiller A. Prostitution: le debat indispensable. Le Nouvel Observateur 8 June 2000, no 1857La prostitution n'est pas un m√©tier, c'est un malheur Le Figaro May 26, 2000 That same week, the Minister of Labour, Martine Aubry, proclaimed in the Assembl√©e nationale that France would continue to defend its abolitionist position against prostitution, because the commodification of human bodies was not acceptable and a violation of human rights.Prostitution - Mme Aubry r√©affirme la position abolitionniste de la France. Le Monde 19 May 2000 UNESCO held a conference in Paris on 16 May of that year (Peuple de l'Ab√Æme. La Prostitution aujourd'hui) organized by (Fondation Scelles), an abolitionist NGO, which also published Le livre noir de la prostitution, a strongly worded attack on the subject of prostitution. In 1999, 189 cases of pimping were tried, and 137 sentenced to prison. Generally the judiciary were satisfied with the existing legislation, although 2000 also saw the creation of a new unit of the Judicial Police using information technology to combat pimping and trafficking. Transnational operators proved a problem to the police. = The Senate inquiry (1999‚Äì2001) = State feminism culminated in the Senate's new D√©l√©gation Aux Droits Des Femmes (Delegation for Women's Rights) initiating an inquiry in 1999. The 2001 report of the Delegation (named after its author, Senator Dinah Derycke (1997‚Äì2001)) was critical of what it saw as the lack of commitment in the fight against prostitution, mainly the difference between France's official abolitionist position and what was occurring in practice. Although the report received a favourable reception in parliament initially, its political impact was limited. Senator Derycke retired due to ill health and died soon after, while other pressures diverted the debate into other related measures, such as organized crime and trafficking and 'modern slavery'. Outside parliament, there was a new activism and demand for action, led by Bus des femmes.Les amis du Bus des femmes But the focus of the outcry was trafficking, with an emphasis on Eastern Europe. However, the new right-wing government elected in 2002 (Jean-Pierre Raffarin) was to completely change the way prostitution was perceived (see below). = Opposition = Criticism of the dominant discourse came from prostitute' rights advocates, health associations, such as Cabiria (Lyons), AIDS groups, and some activists who complained that sex workers were being treated paternalistically and denied voice and moral agency. They demanded eradication of stigma and restoration of rights, access to health and social services, and better \\"working conditions\\". Organizations such as Cabiria, ACT-UP Paris, PASTT, and AIDES-Paris Isle-de-France condemned the UNESCO conference (above) as stigmatizing. All parties claimed they spoke on behalf of and for sex workers, and shared a concern for their welfare, while denying their opponents did. Therefore, both sides held a position that workers should not be penalized, positioned as either victims or legitimate workers. = Security debates 2002 = New issues arising in 2002 were local residents' complaints and the ascendacy of a law and order discourse on both left and right, leading to a heated debate,Claude Boucher D√©fendre les travailleuses du sexe; Elizabeth Badinter Si c'est leur choix; Wassila Tamzali Le devoir d'interdire; Fran√ßoise de Panafieu Pourquoire j'ai tap√© le poing sur la table. Le Nouvel Observateur 22 August 2002 notably the suggestion by Fran√ßoise de Panafieu (UMP) that the maisons closes (see Maisons closes below) be re-opened. Pourquoi la prostitution ne s'exercerait-elle pas dans des lieux pr√©cis, maisons closes ou autres structures ? Le Journal du Dimanche July 2002. Later, she added \\"Je dirais que la bonne vieille maison close ne peut en aucun cas servir et ne correspond pas au droit europ√©en\\" The issue of \\"security\\" became a major issue in the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2002. The catch-cry of \\"to save the Republic\\" worked in the favour of the right and President Jacques Chirac and Jean-Pierre Raffarin who came to power as Prime Minister that year. Nicolas Sarkozy became minister of the interior in the incoming right-wing Rafferin government (2002-2005), almost immediately announcing a Domestic Security Bill (Loi No 2003-239 pour la s√©curit√© int√©rieure), and the focus of the debates around prostitution shifted to legislation. (see Public opinion 2002, below)  Legislation (Domestic Security Law) 2003  In justifying these measures, Sarkozy claimed large segments of the population were exposed to \\"anxiety and legitimate exasperation\\". Article 42 addressed the protection of women in prostitution, considered victims of exploitation, and these were amplified by the Minister for Equality in the Workplace, Nicole Ameline (2002‚Äì2004).Ministre d√©l√©gu√©e aupr√®s du ministre des affaires sociales, du travail et de la solidarit√© √† la parit√© et √† l'√©galit√© professionnelle Sarkozy stated that by criminalizing passive soliciting, he was protecting prostitutes and helping them escape organized crime.M. Sarkozy d√©fend son projet de loi sur la s√©curit√© int√©rieure Le Monde 23 Oct 2002 The Government position was that action against certain activities would improve the quality of life and sense of security of the poor, who are likely to be victims of crime. Sarkozy stated that the poor supported a tough crime agenda and that the general population wanted a stronger stand on law and order. In particular, he cited an Ipsos poll suggesting that 80% of people on minimum wage approved of his proposals and that the lower the socio-economic class the more support. In February 2002, a poll suggested security was the most important issue on people's minds in an election year, and in October, 70% of the population considered the proposed measures necessary. The Sarkozy bill both redefined prostitution and transformed policy, making solicitation, previously a minor offence, a serious offence (un d√©lit) (up to six months imprisonment initially, but amended to two), with stiffer fines, and brought back \\"passive\\" solicitation as a crime (Article 50). Passive solicitation had been previously decriminalized by another right-wing government, that of Balladur in 1994. Proposed Article 225-10-1 removed the necessity of the police having evidence of soliciting, allowing 'dress or posture' to be sufficient. He explained that it was inconvenient for the police to have to obtain evidence of active soliciting. In the Senate, a Government amendment subsequently deleted reference to dress after a popular outcry.Projet de Loi as presented to the Senate on October 23 2002 by M. Sarkozy. \\"par sa tenue vestimentaire ou son attitude\\" was amended to \\"par une attitude m√™me passive\\" Article 50 also criminalized purchase of sex from those considered 'particularly vulnerable', such as 'illness, disability, physical or mental deficiency or pregnancy'. Furthermore, the new legislation allowed for foreigners to have their permits revoked for disturbing public order, allowing deportation to become a penalty for solicitation (active or passive), even if they were legal immigrants. It addressed trafficking, by defining it and attached penalties. In the case of alleged victims of trafficking, collaboration allowed them to stay and work till their case was heard. If an exploiters were convicted (Article 76), they could then receive permanent residence. Finally, article 52 allowed for annual reports to be published on prostitution in France, from 2004 onwards.  Reactions  Reactions included demonstrations and petitions. Criticism came from the left, trade unions, women's and human rights and poverty groups who saw this bill, which simultaneously addressed begging, squatting and assembling in public areas of buildings, as an attack on the poor, stating that no one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute.Tubiana, M., B. Marcus et al. Ligue des droits de l'Homme, Syndicat des Avocats de France, Syndicat de la Magistrature. \\"Lettre ouverte √† Monsieur Sarkozy\\" Le Nouvel Observateur (2002) Sarkozy was accused of exploiting people's insecurities. In the Senate, the measures were seen to be street cleaning, rather than addressing the causes of social problems and social exclusion, and that reconstructing prostitution as a law and order issue would merely drive it underground, depriving sex workers from access to services, and damaging AIDS campaigns. it was stated that no-one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute, to live in neighbourhoods with no facilities and no public services\\". It was noted that there was no action to deal with organized crime or those who might be exploiting sex workers.Senat SEANCE DU 14 NOVEMBRE 2002 Comments of Mme H√©l√®ne Luc and M. Jacques Mah√©as The issue of passive solicitation caused particular concern since it could mean that any woman could be arrested for the way she dressed, and it was particularly hard to define. The judiciary were equally unhappy with evidence that solely consisted of police testimony and were reluctant to convict.Colas H. √† Bordeaux, la justice distanci√©e par la police. L'Humanit√© 20 Dec 2003 It was suggested that concern for victims for trafficking was hardly consistent with punishing them, and that prostitution had become conflated with trafficking. The trafficking policy seemed more aimed at the porousness of borders than at actual criminals, while migrant sex workers appeared to be particularly discriminated against, since they were simultaneously 'rescued' and deported without in any way addressing their vulnerability. Calls for aiming trafficking policy at traffickers rather than sex workers came from the Senate Law Commission, the Delegations for Women's Rights in the Senate and National Assembly, as well as from the opposition. In the Senate hearings into prostitution that year, Claude Boucher of Bus des Femmes, a sex worker support group, described how sex workers sell sex to survive, unable to make ends meet on social security or the minimum wage. To treat them as criminals, she argued, would just make them more vulnerable. \\"Cette loi n'est m√™me pas une loi d'ordre moral, c'est une loi contre les exclus, contre les plus vuln√©rables\\" (This law is not even a public morals law, it is a law against those who are excluded, against the most vulnerable)  Evaluation  Sarkozy did not attempt to produce a comprehensive policy on prostitution, but rather a quick fix, addressing immediate concerns of voters in terms of visibility. In this, he succeeded, at least in the short term. The police reported a 40% decrease in prevalence, but also that it had moved to more discreet areas and hours. However, the more profound effect was that Sarkozy had changed the framing of sex workers from victims to criminals, and tied it to immigration debates, focusing narrowly on street transactions. This avoided inconveniencing the middle-class clients, who might have created more opposition. The governmental policy tended to portray all immigrant women in prostitution, the most vulnerable, as victims of trafficking and exploitation, and their pimps as \\"foreigners\\". Following the law coming into effect, 5,619 charges of passive solicitation were laid between March 2003 and July 2004, 90% of these were women, and most from Bulgaria and Albania (40%), Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Cameroon (35%). 15% were French nationals, another 10% from other areas in Africa and 2% from Asia.Des associations constatent un timide reflux de la prostitution. Le Monde 4 Sept 2004 There was a notable increase in foreign workers detained and deported. In 2004, the police dismantled many trafficking networks, mainly involving Eastern Europe and Africa. Agence France Presse 2004 While the law referred to protection, shelter, and re-integration, there was no provision made for this, according to Cimade, an NGO.Cimade Les prostitu√©es en d√©tention. 2004 The results of the law were considered disastrous for the women who were supposed to be protected. The effects were largely those of displacement, pushing their activities into isolated areas, and the 3‚Äì7am timeslot, isolated them from service agencies, exposed them to violence and destroyed the historical working relationship with the police.Chartier C. le coup de la loi Chartier C. le coup de la loi. L'Express 15 March 2004 A study by Anne Hidalgo and Christophe Caresche, Deputy mayors in the office of the Mayor of Paris (Bertrand Delano√´), was especially critical: > \\"En amalgamant prostitution libre et prostitution forc√©e, qui rel√®vent de > processus totalement diff√©rents, en victimisant les personnes qui se > prostituent, sans distinction, cette loi l√©gitime et renforce les violences > symboliques, physiques, polici√®res, institutionnelles.

Blandine Grosjean. Des filles de joie bien √† la peine. Lib√©ration 13 June 2003 Sarkozy had made a sharp distinction between the \\"classic prostitution\\" of the traditional French Fille de Joie, who he depicted as unproblematic, even a cultural icon (see Culture), and the presence of \\"ces malheureuses filles √©trang√®res\\" (these poor foreign girls) on the streets of France, who he depicted as the security threat. By \\"rescuing\\" these victims of trafficking and returning them home, he proposed to solve the situation. He argued that the only way to achieve this was to arrest them and then send them back to their families (Si le racolage est reconnu comme un d√©lit, les forces de l'ordre pourront, parce qu'elles auront commis un d√©lit, ramener ces filles chez elles), which he stated to be a humanitarian duty \\"c'est un devoir, dirai-je, humanitaire que de raccompagner cette personne chez elle\\" (I will say it is a humanitarian duty to return such a person to their home).Senat SEANCE DU 14 NOVEMBRE 2002 Comments of M. N Sarkozy. > \\"Far be it for me to suggest punishing these poor girls: The offense that we > are creating must come to their aid ... I hope that these women will have a > better future than facing degrading encounters night after night\\" In drawing this distinction, Sarkozy made frequent reference to the inability to speak French, constructing the issue as a defense of French. He suggested that this made them vulnerable to exploitation, and that the Police would take them home. This last point became a target of those who believed they were being sent back to the conditions that made them leave in the first place. = Further legislative attempts = Changes to trafficking policy in 2003 were more influenced by European and international influence than domestic concerns, but trafficking was finally defined as well as giving victims residence permits in exchange for testimony. Critics doubted the practicality or whether the benefits were equally distributed between the women and the authorities, an expression of the tension between human rights and public security. In April 2006, Senator Nicole Borvo (PCF) attempted to introduce a private bill to repeal the Sarkozy law, arguing that it had been ineffective, and turned victims into criminals. The framework was very similar to the 2001 Deryck report, depicting prostitution as violence rather than law and order, and seeking punishment of exploiters, but also measures for prevention and support.  2011 Parliamentary Commission  In April 2011, a parliamentary commission report (\\"En finir avec le mythe du plus vieux m√©tier du monde\\") recommended the adoption of the Swedish approach of criminalizing the purchase of sex. The social affairs minister, Roselyne Bachelot, supported the proposal, stating, \\"There is no such thing as freely chosen and consenting prostitution. The sale of sexual acts means women's bodies are made available for men, independently of the wishes of those women.\\" Other support came from Mouvement du Nid. The French sex worker movement STRASS has condemned the proposals. Proposals to punish customers of prostitution (2011‚Äì2016) In October and November 2013, French lawmakers began debating a proposal to punish customers of prostitution.\\"Vers une proposition de loi sanctionnant les clients de prostitu√©es par une contravention\\", in Le Figaro, 2 octobre 2013, p. 12. (in French) On 4 December, the National Assembly passed a bill fining customers of prostitutes by 268 votes to 138, with 79 abstaining, which would impose fines of at least ‚Ç¨1,500 on clients caught paying for sexual relations. Within the National Assembly, most of those who supported the bill were MPs from the Socialist Party, which dominates the house. The law was passed in the National Assembly on 4 December 2013. The bill caused considerable controversy in France among politicians and intellectuals, some for legalizing prostitution, and others wanting it banned. The bill was opposed by many sex workers, and was rejected by the French Senate in July 2014. Finally, on 6 April 2016, the French National Assembly voted to fine customers of prostitutes ‚Ç¨1,500.Prostitution : la p√©nalisation des clients d√©finitivement vot√©e au Parlement 'Le Figaro', accessed 7 April 2016 = Construction of prostitution = Critics say most of the frames (nuisance, victim, deviant, security threat) in which sex work is discussed in France are constructed without the input of sex workers who are depicted as voiceless and agencyless. There are exceptions such as the French lesbian feminist Claudie Lesselier.  Public opinion  CSA, a polling organization, has carried out several surveys on prostitution in France. A 2002 telephone survey analyzed French attitudes about prostitution. 64% of respondents said that prostitution was \\"a degrading practice for the image and the dignity of the woman (or the man)\\". 66% of those questioned favored the re-opening of the maisons closes (brothels - see Maisons closes, below), 37% wanted the clients to be criminalized, 22% wanted the prostitutes to be criminalized and 33% wanted all forms of prostitution to be illegal. When analyzed and broken down by age and gender, the survey showed that some people gave contradictory answers: For example, some people appeared to favor both the re-opening of the maisons (brothels) and the interdiction of all forms of prostitution (probably believing that both solutions would work, as the survey showed that most people were dissatisfied with the existing legal situation). Older people and men were more accepting of the idea of having legalized brothels.2002 Survey results , CSACSA: Les Fran√ßais et la r√©ouverture des maisons closes 2002 In the 2006 poll, only 14% thought prostitution should be illegal.L'opinion des Fran√ßais √† l'√©gard de la prostitution CSA avril 2006 Poll results reported in 2010 gave 59% in favor of re-opening of the brothels, and 10% opposed. Liberalization is opposed by abolitionist groups such as Mouvement du Nid. = Expert opinion = In May 2011, the seventh anniversary of the introduction of the LSI, M√©decins du Monde released a very critical report on the effect of the law, and called for its repeal.  Forms and extent of prostitution  Prostitute activist in Paris, 2005 Prostitutes working in vans in Lyon, France Studies from 2003 estimated that about 15,000 ‚Äì 20,000 women work as prostitutes in France.De plus en plus de prostitu√©es africaines en France, Afrik.com, 7 May 2004. In 2010, the number of full-time male and female prostitutes was estimated at 20,000 ‚Äì 30,000, with 80% being foreigners. In 2018 it was estimated there were 30,000 prostitutes in the country and 90% were foreign. Sex work in France, like other countries takes many forms. These include street prostitution, escort services, bars, and apartment prostitution. Street prostitution is partly controlled by pimps, while other workers are autonomous prostitutes. In some areas, such as Lyon or the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, sex workers use vans (see illustration). The most famous prostitution street in Paris, the la Rue Saint-Denis, has been somewhat gentrified in recent years and the prostitutes have been moved further north. Escort services where one hires a woman or man for \\"entertainment\\" or companionship, but usually including sex, are less common in France, compared to North America. In bars, women try to induce men to buy expensive drinks along with sexual acts. Prices are set by the bar owner, and the money is shared between the owner and the prostitute. Pigalle peepshows are well known for practicing such scams. Prostitution in apartments is advertised in adult newspapers and magazines. Swingers' clubs are places where partner-swapping occurs and sometimes paid prostitutes are in attendance, as well as \\"amateur\\" women and couples who get in without paying the flat-rate charge of about 80 to 120 euros that men pay, including food, drink and unlimited sex sessions, with the added twist that these are performed in the open in full view of all the guests. = Maisons closes = Brothels (Maisons closes) remain illegal, but operate discreetly and clandestinely. Since their official closure in 1946, there have been periodic calls for their re-opening. In 1990, (RPR), a former Minister of Health (1986-1988), suggested re-opening them in 1990 as a public health measure. A row erupted in 2002 with the proposal by Fran√ßoise de Panafieu (UMP), which divided French feminists, with Gis√®le Halimi denouncing it, but √âlisabeth Badinter seeing it as an issue of \\"the right to dispose freely of one's body\\". A 2010 proposal by Chantal Brunel for a return to regulated brothels was opposed by French sex workers (see Politics, above). Meanwhile, Spain has exploited the difference between the two countries by opening brothels along the French-Spanish border. = Earnings = In 2004, the average earnings of a French prostitute were estimated at ‚Ç¨500 a day. For Sub- Saharian prostitutes living in France, it was less, around ‚Ç¨200‚Äì300. Some barely made ‚Ç¨50‚Äì150 a week.  Prostitution and culture  ', by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, 1894 Nicolas Sarkozy recognized that the traditional sex worker was part of France's national cultural heritage. Paintings and drawings of maisons closes (brothels), and prostitution appear frequently in art over the centuries, some of which are shown here. Some of the best known are scenes in brothels produced by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Edgar Degas and Pablo Picasso, among others. Brassa√Ø published photographs of brothels in his 1935 book Volupt√©s de Paris.Storyville - Paris Brothel, BBC Four documentary, 2003 A voluminous illustrated work on the phenomenon is Maisons closes. L'histoire, l'art, la litt√©rature, les moeurs by Romi (Robert Miquet), first published in 1952. Amongst writers depicting the life of women in prostitution in France are Honor√© de Balzac and Victor Hugo (see bibliography). The Mus√©e de l'Erotisme in Paris devotes one floor to the maisons closes. It exhibits Polissons et galipettes, a collection of short erotic silent movies that were used to entertain brothel visitors, and copies of Le Guide Rose, a contemporary brothel guide that also carried advertising.A Nice Mix of Art, History and Sex , Metropole Paris, 16 January 2004 The 2003 BBC Four documentary Storyville - Paris Brothel describes the maisons closes. An exhibition about historical Paris brothels took place from November 2009 to January 2010 in an art gallery across the street from the former Le Chabanais. Sex trafficking France is a destination, transit, and a limited source country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Foreign victims from Eastern Europe, West and North Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean are subjected to sex trafficking. Sex trafficking networks controlled by Nigerians, Bulgarians, Romanians, Chinese, and French citizens force women into prostitution through debt bondage, physical force, and psychological coercion, including the invocation of voodoo and drug addiction. The number of children exploited in commercial sex has increased in recent years. Children, primarily from Romania, West and North Africa, and the Middle East, are victims of sex trafficking in France. The government estimates the majority of the 30,000 people in prostitution in France, about 90 percent of whom are foreign, are likely trafficking victims. Trafficking of male victims for sex trafficking has increased. Nigerian trafficking networks use migrant and drug trafficking routes through Libya and Italy to transport girls to France. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks France as a 'Tier 1' country.

Unlike the other Christmas specials, this episode is not a one-off story, but sets up story arcs that run throughout the following series. It was filmed in the recording block for series 7. Synopsis At the Broadwalk Shopping Centre, Albert and Del Boy sell children's dolls that sing Chinese lullabies. Meanwhile, at Parry Print Ltd, a hungry Rodney discovers that Cassandra made him a very meagre sandwich for lunch, and his new secretary refuses to go out and buy him a hamburger during the lunch break because an important client is due to see him. However, when he spots Raquel with shopping bags full of delicious food, Rodney invites her into his office, and they chat about the tour that Raquel has been on since the events of \\"The Jolly Boys' Outing\\", and how Rodney's marriage with Cassandra is faring. Despite claiming they are happy together, Rodney implies that he and Cassandra are experiencing difficulties. That evening, Rodney returns home to his flat, only to find that Cassandra has not prepared dinner for him and is instead going out to play badminton. They argue, and Cassandra accuses Rodney of being childish if he expects her to cook for him like a servant from the 1930s. Rodney subsequently storms out. Meanwhile, at Nelson Mandela House, Del and Raquel are enjoying a romantic dinner and, just as Del is about to proposition Raquel, Rodney bursts in and tells everyone that his marriage is over. Rodney decides to sleep in his old bedroom, but Del tells him that Raquel is sleeping there, so Rodney will be sleeping on the sofa. A week later, at a nightclub, as Del and Raquel dance, Rodney is getting drunk with his friends Mickey Pearce and Chris, which leaves Del concerned. Del tries to make Rodney see sense and return to his wife, but Rodney refuses to listen. The next evening, back at the flat, Del tells Albert that when Rodney took the Trotter van down to the Peckham Exhaust Centre earlier that morning to get it fixed, he foolishly arranged a date with an attractive receptionist, Tanya, following Mickey Pearce's advice to make Cassandra jealous. When Rodney tells Del, Raquel, and Albert that he is going to see Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with Tanya, they try to talk him out of his date, but Rodney ignores them and heads off. Del then realises that Rodney is deliberately taking Tanya to the cinema opposite Cassandra's evening school, where he hopes Cassandra will see them together. Aware that this will lose Rodney both his marriage and his job, Del goes over to Cassandra's flat to persuade her not to go to her class, and ends up breaking the bad news to her. Cassandra is reduced to tears, but agrees not to tell her parents. Later, back at the flat at midnight, as Del tries to remove the voiceboxes from the Chinese dolls, he gets a telephone call from Rodney, who took Del's advice, cancelled his date, and has decided to wait at his flat for Cassandra, so they can be reconciled. Before Del can warn him about what he just did, Rodney hangs up and removes the receiver from the machine, preventing Del from calling him back. Del admits to Raquel and Albert that he told Cassandra, and then quickly drives over to Rodney and Cassandra's flat. Cassandra arrives moments before Del and furiously throws Rodney out. Rodney confronts Del over telling on him and sends him home, but realises that he himself has been locked out of his home, leaving him no choice but to go back to Nelson Mandela House with Del.

She saw action in the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812 and continued a busy career at sea into the middle of the 19th century. In 1846 she was reduced to harbour service, in 1860 she became a receiving ship, and she was finally disposed of in 1906. Service Belvidera was commissioned in January 1800 under Captain Charles Dashwood. In March, Captain Richard Byron replaced Dashwood. On 22 July 1810, Belvidera and , Captain William Ferris, were sailing close to the shore of Studtland, Norway. That evening a boat from Belvedera sighted three Danish gun-vessels in a large bay. Next day, seven boats from the two frigates attacked the Danes. Two of the Danish vessels, Balder and Thor, commanded by Lieutenants Dahlreup and Rasmusen, were schooner-rigged. Each mounted two long 24-pounders and six 6-pounder howitzers and had a crew of 45 men. The third gun-vessel carried one long 24-pounder and a crew of 25 men. The British captured both Balder and Thor without suffering any casualties, though the Danes lost four men killed. The remaining vessel, Gunboat No. 5, ran up a fiord where her crew abandoned her; the British then burnt her. In 1811, Belvidera became the flagship of Admiral Herbert Sawyer on the Halifax station in Nova Scotia. =Belvidera and USS Constitution= Belvidera took part in one of the earliest actions of the War of 1812 when she encountered the American frigates , and on 23 June 1812, five days after the war had started. Belvidera had been shadowing Marengo captained by French privateer John Ordronaux. The British were not aware that war had been declared and after returning fire they managed to evade their pursuers during the night. Belvideras course during the fight had led the Americans away from a British convoy from Jamaica, allowing the convoy to escape attack. Belvidera arrived in Halifax on 27 June with three prizes that she captured on the way. On 16 July 1812, Belvidera was part of a British squadron that gave chase to , another of the United States' heavy frigates, which was on her way from Chesapeake Bay to New York. In the very light winds, both sides put out boats to tow the ships. Constitution gained an advantage by using her anchors to pull herself about four miles ahead of Belvidera. Captain Byron then copied the manoeuvre of Constitution and managed to bring the two ships within gunshot. They exchanged fire as a light breeze came up, and by daylight on 19 July Constitution, being newly out of port, was able to escape. =Prize- taking= For the remainder of the war, Belvidera was active in the blockade of the American coast, capturing many American merchant ships and privateers. Between 1 June 1812 and 14 December 1812, Belvidera captured a number of merchant vessels: *brig Malcolm, of 197 tons, sailing from Madeira to Portland, carrying dollars and wine (24 June); *ship Fortune, of 317 tons, sailing from Cape de Verde to Newbury Port, carrying salt (25 June). *brig Minerva, of 256 tons, sailing from Liverpool to Boston with coals and salt (6 July; with , and ); *ship Oronoko, of 427 tons, sailing from Lisbon to New York, in ballast (11 July; with Africa, Shannon, Aeolus and ); *brig Hare, of 246 tons, sailing from Naples to Boston, with brandy, silks, oil, &c.; (1 August); and, *schooner Friendship, of 98 tons, sailing from Charleston to New York, carrying cotton (11 September). Also, they captured the *ship Eleanor (23 July). Belvidera, Aeolus, Africa, Shannon and Guerriere were among the vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of on 16 July. At the time of her capture she mounted 16 guns, had crew of 106 men and was under the command of Lieutenant William M. Crane. On 21 August Belvidera captured the U.S. privateer 7-gun schooner Bunker's Hill, with 72 men. On 10 September Belvidera detained Citizen. Two days later Belvidera captured the American schooner Hiram. Belvidera recaptured the Post Office Packet Service packet on 5 January 1813. The had captured Nocton 11 December 1812. Belvidera sent Nocton into Bermuda. After undergoing some refitting Nocton arrived back at Falmouth on 17 March. On 8 February 1813, nine boats and 200 men of , Belvidera, and , which were at anchor in Lynhaven Bay, chased and captured the letter of marque schooner Lottery, of 225 tons, and pierced for 16 guns though only carrying six 12-pounder carronades. She had a crew 28 men and was sailing from Baltimore to Bordeaux with a cargo of coffee, sugar, and logwood. In the engagement the British had six men wounded, one of whom later died, but Belvidera herself suffered no casualties. The Americans suffered 19 men wounded, including their captain, John Southcomb, before they struck. Southcomb died of his wounds and his body was taken ashore. A week later Lottery convoyed several prizes to Bermuda. The British took Lottery into service as the 16-gun schooner . Belvidera was among the numerous British warships that shared in the capture of the American ship St. Michael on 10 February. On 25 September 1813, Belvidera, Statira and were in company when they captured Ambition. On 19 December and captured Rising States. Belvidera and shared in the proceeds of the capture by agreement with Jaseur. Then on Christmas Day, Belvidera captured the schooner , which was attempting to get from Wilmington, North Carolina, to Newcastle, Delaware. The US had purchased Vixen at Savannah, Georgia, in 1813 but when Belvidera captured her she had not yet received her armament of 14 guns nor naval stores. On 7 March 1814, Belvidera, and captured the American privateer Mars. Mars was armed with 15 guns and had a crew of 70 men. A later report has them destroying her on 10 March. Belvidera was also among the vessels sharing in the proceeds of the capture of the brigs Christina and Massasoit on 3 and 14 March. On 21 April 1814, Belvidera captured the US ship , of 256 tons, armed with six guns and with a crew of 17 men. She was sailing from the Marquesas to Philadelphia carrying a cargo of spermaceti oil. New Zealander, a prize to , had departed Valparaiso for the United States and was only one day out of New York when Belvidera captured her. In addition Belvidera captured the following American vessels: *schooner Nancy and Polly, carrying shingles (19 June); *sloop Alonzo (22 June); *sloop Hunter, of 60 tons and nine men, sailing from New Burn to New York, carrying tar and turpentine (24 June). Post-war At the end of 1814, Belvidera was decommissioned at Portsmouth. She was relaunched on 26 September 1817, having been refitted. She made numerous cruises to the Mediterranean, Portugal, Madeira, and the West Indies. In 1834 she took troops to St Kitts and then on a second trip, to Trinidad.

The album was fully self produced, with the mixing and recording done by Jacobs and Rietdijk and the artwork done by Hennephof. Textures was named by Stef Broks after a song from the Cynic album Focus as an indicator of the use of many layers of sounds in their songs, the blending of different musical backgrounds and tastes, as well as the varying personalities of the band members. = Drawing Circles and Silhouettes (2004‚Äì2008) = Guitarist Jochem Jacobs live in London, 2007 Vocalist Verpaalen was replaced by Eric Kalsbeek for their second album Drawing Circles, released on 17 October 2006.

In March 2010, Dani√´l de Jongh (formerly of Cilice) joined the band as a replacement. Due to the singer change, the follow-up to their 2008 release Silhouettes was postponed to early 2011. Soon after Daniel de Jongh was announced as the replacement, keyboard player Richard Rietdijk left the band. He was replaced by Uri Dijk, originally as a live stand-in and finally as a permanent member in September 2010. On 27 January 2011, the band announced on their official website they entered the studio to begin the recording of their fourth studio album, with the following statement: Guitarist and producer Jacobs described the progress in the album recording as: In March 2011 the band released their first podcast covering the band's return to the studio for recording their fourth album.

History The network launched on November 25, 1999 as Freeview, a service on DirecTV channel 103 carrying a continuous loop of concerts and other events. Freeview was part of all of the satellite provider's subscription packages, starting with the Total Choice tier. In 2005, it was moved to channel 101 and was rebranded as The 101 Network (as a suffix, \\"101\\" is college jargon for basic classes or, in more general terms, a way to describe any basic concept). Following the rebrand, the channel's schedule began to expand to include original programs. The channel was rebranded as Audience Network on June 1, 2011. In 2015, the channel was offered on AT&T; U-verse after DirecTV was acquired by AT&T.; In June 2018, AT&T; announced its discount streaming service, WatchTV, which would carry Audience.

Downey He married Julia Mary Lethbridge, daughter of Albert Arthur Erin Lethbridge and Jane Hill on 27 June 1888 at St. George's, Hanover Square, London. Julia was born in Hamilton, Ontario on 9 October 1863. She spent several years as a child in Persia, where her great-uncle Charles Alison (1810-1872) was British minister. She was educated in England. A miniature of Julia, by C. Turrell, was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, 1900. A portrait and sketch of her appeared in \\"Men and Women of the Day\\" (London : 1889). The Carew Spinel of the Mughal emperors bought in Persia by her relative was bequeathed to the V&A; in 1922 by Lady Carew. The couple had no children. On his death the baronies passed to his younger brother George Patrick John Carew, 4th Baron Carew.  Notes   References  *Kidd, Charles & Williamson, David (eds.)

The Zaisan Memorial () is a memorial in the southern area of the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar that honors allied Mongolian and Soviet soldiers killed in World War II. Located on a hill in the southern part of the city, the memorial features a circular memorial painting that depicts scenes of friendship between the people of the USSR and Mongolia. The mural depicts scenes such as Soviet support for Mongolia's independence declaration in 1921, the defeat of the Japanese Kwantung Army by the Soviets at Khalhkin Gol on the Mongolian border in 1939, victory over Nazi Germany and peacetime achievements such as Soviet space flights including the flight of Soyuz 39 which carried the first Mongolian into space, Jugderdemidiin Gurragchaa. After driving to the uppermost parking lot on the hill, visitors must make a climb of three hundred steps before reaching the monument and mural. (612 steps, if they start at the base of the hill.) Those who make the climb are rewarded with a panoramic view of the entire city of Ulaanbaatar in the valley below, as well as the Tuul River flowing past the city. In 2003, a tank memorial, which previously had been located on a crossroads between Zaisan and the city center, was moved to the foot of the hill. It features a Soviet tank from a brigade paid for by the Mongolian people. The tank memorial includes a map showing the route the brigade took from Moscow in 1943 to its participation in the fall of Berlin in 1945.

Pixies' Parasol (Mycena interrupta) growing on a log in East Gippsland (Australia). Mycena is a large genus of small saprotrophic mushrooms that are rarely more than a few centimeters in width. They are characterized by a white spore print, a small conical or bell-shaped cap, and a thin fragile stem. Most are gray or brown, but a few species have brighter colors. Most have a translucent and striate cap, which rarely has an incurved margin. The gills are attached and usually have cystidia. Some species, like Mycena haematopus, exude a latex when the stem is broken, and many species have a chlorine-like odor. Overview Mycenas are hard to identify to species and some are distinguishable only by microscopic features such as the shape of the cystidia. Some species are edible, while others contain toxins, but the edibility of most is not known, as they are too small to be useful in cooking. Mycena cyanorrhiza stains blue and contains the hallucinogen psilocybinGaston Guzman, John W. Allen & Jochen Gartz, \\"A Worldwide Geographical Distribution of the Neurotropic Fungi, An Analysis And Discussion\\",Vol14(1998), 189‚Äì280, 2000. and Mycena pura contains the mycotoxin muscarine. Over 33 species are known to be bioluminescent, creating a glow known as foxfire. These species are divided among 16 lineages, leading to evolutionary uncertainty in whether the luminescence developed once and was lost among many species, or evolved in parallel by several species. One advantage of bioluminescence may lie in its potential to attract insects that can disperse the mushroom's spores.Oliveira et al. 2015. Circadian Control Sheds Light on Fungal Bioluminescence. Current Biology, 25(7). Alexander Smith's 1947 Mycena monograph identified 232 species; the genus is now known to include about 500 species worldwide. Maas Geesteranus divided the genus into 38 sections in 1992, providing keys to each for all the species of the Northern Hemisphere. Many new species have been discovered since then, and four new sections have been proposed. Taxonomy is complex, as most sections are not truly homogeneous, and the keys fail for some species, especially those that satisfy some criteria for only part of their life cycle. Some sections contain only one species. The name Mycena comes from the Ancient Greek ŒºœçŒ∫Œ∑œÇ ', meaning \\"mushroom.\\" Species in the genus Mycena (and in Hemimycena) are commonly known as bonnets.

As from the 2020‚Äì21 season they play in the Championnat National, the third tier in the French football league system. They play at the Stade Fred Aubert in Saint-Brieuc, which can hold 11,000 fans. They have played for the majority of their existence at the amateur levels of the French football league system, but did spend three seasons in the second tier of the professional league during the period 1993‚Äì1997, before suffering liquidation and an enforced relegation to fifth tier. History Until 1959, Stade Briochin competed in the Ligue de Bretagne, the regional amateur league of Brittany. For five of the next ten years they contested the Championnat de France Amateur, which at the time was the top tier of Amateur football. They competed around this level, as the French football league system restructured itself, until 1988 when they were relegated from the Ligue de Bretagne Division Honneur (the fifth tier, in effect, at this stage) to the Ligue de Bretagne Division Sup√©rieure R√©gionale. From the 1988‚Äì89 season, the club won promotions in three out of four seasons, and in 1993‚Äì94 they finished 6th in Division 2, which is still their highest finish to date. In the 1996‚Äì97 season, the club started to suffer from debt issues, and on 24 March 1997 they were liquidated by order of court and administratively relegated from the professional football league. The club restarted in Championnat de France Amateur 2 for the 1997‚Äì98 season, falling to the Ligue de Bretagne Division Honneur (now the sixth tier) in 2008 and further to the Ligue de Bretagne Division Sup√©rieure √âlite (seventh tier) in 2011. Successive promotions in 2012 and 2013 brought the club back to CFA 2.

In 1842, he married Orsina Little. Orsina was the granddaughter of Jonathan Clark and Moses Little.Storey's pp. 501-502 Barker engaged in agricultural pursuits and also in the shook business. He moved to Carrolltown, Pennsylvania, in 1854 and later to Ebensburg, Pennsylvania, where he continued the shook business. Barker also worked with Neal Dow in favor of the Maine law. Barker was an ardent prohibitionist.Union Publishing's pp. 434-435 He also engaged in the mercantile business in 1858 and later in the lumber business. He became the president of the Ebensburg and Cresson Branch Railroad, until it was taken over by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Political Career and later life Barker was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention. He cast his vote for the nomination of Abraham Lincoln at the convention. During the American Civil War, he served in Company E, Fourth Regiment, Pennsylvania Emergency Troops. Barker was elected as a Republican to the Thirty-ninth Congress. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1866 and for election as a Republican in 1872. After leaving congress, Barker left the Republican Party to join to the Prohibition Party in 1876. From 1878 to 1882, Barker served as the president of the Pennsylvania Prohibition Party. He reengaged in the lumber and shook business until 1880. Barker was also highly involved in Freemasonry. In 1896 Barker was nominated to run for congress by the Prohibition Party. This was his final political race, and he lost. He died in Altoona, Pennsylvania, while on a visit for medical treatment in 1898.

It is currently the fourth largest hotel in the city.  History  = Early years = The Hotel Pennsylvania was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad and operated by Ellsworth Statler. It opened on January 25, 1919 and was designed by William Symmes Richardson of the firm of McKim, Mead & White, which also designed the original Pennsylvania Station located across the street. Statler Hotels, which had managed the Pennsylvania since its construction, acquired the property outright from the Pennsylvania Railroad on June 30, 1948 and renamed it the Hotel Statler on January 1, 1949. Following the sale of all 17 Statler hotels to Conrad Hilton in 1954, the hotel became the Statler Hilton. It operated under this name until 1979, when Hilton sold the hotel to developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., for $24 million. The hotel was renamed the New York Statler and was operated by Dunfey hotels, a division of Aer Lingus. The hotel was sold again for $46 million in August 1983. A 50% interest was bought by Abelco, an investment group consisting of developers Elie Hirschfeld, Abraham Hirschfeld, and Arthur G. Cohen, with the other 50% bought by the Penta Hotels chain, a joint-venture of British Airways, Lufthansa, and Swissair. The new owners renamed the hotel the New York Penta and undertook a massive renovation. In 1991, Penta's partners bought out the chain's stake in the hotel and returned it to its original name, Hotel Pennsylvania. = Recent history and attempted demolition = The threat of the Hotel Pennsylvania's demolition was first introduced in 1997 when Vornado Realty Trust bought the hotel in a joint venture with Ong Beng Seng, a Singaporean hotel developer and financier. Vornado and Seng's company then announced on September 25, 1997 the formation of a joint venture for converting the hotel into the first Official All Star Hotel. The plans were halted by mid-1999 as Planet Hollywood sold its stake to a New Jersey-based real estate investment trust. Vornado announced in 2007 that the hotel was to be demolished to make way for a new office building with Merrill Lynch as its anchor tenant. Owner Vornado Realty Trust intended to build a building by 2011. In 2006, the Save Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation (now the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society) was created. Shortly after the announcement of Vornado's plans, the staff of 2600: The Hacker Quarterly, a magazine that sponsors biennial HOPE hacker conventions at the hotel, began investigating possible ways to save the hotel from demolition. They were joined by the new Save the Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation, whose members included a number of city organizations and politicians to aid in the landmarking of the hotel, including the Historic Districts Council, Manhattan Community Board 5, and Assemblyman Richard Gottfried. In November 2007, Manhattan Community Board 5 voted 21-8 to have New York City Council landmark the historic hotel. In February 2008, however, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission denied the request for landmarking. Preservation efforts have proven difficult. Emmanuel Goldstein of 2600 noted that while people overseas expressed concern over the fate of the hotel: > New Yorkers might not care enough to get involved. The hotel was old; the > rooms weren't as big and luxurious as other more modern facilities; and New > Yorkers simply weren't in a position to grasp the importance of such a place > since they normally don't need cheap and easily accessible hotels if they > already live here. In May 2010, the hotel was again in danger of demolition. Manhattan Borough president Scott Stringer gave a conditional approval overruling Manhattan Community Board 5. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission reviewed the hotel's Cafe Rouge for landmark status based on a request by the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society, but on October 22, 2010, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission declined to designate the cafe as a landmark. On July 14, 2010, the New York City Department of City Planning voted unanimously in favor of the construction of the tower. On August 23, 2010, the NYC Council voted to approve the proposed Uniform Land Use Review Procedure submitted by the building owners. On December 14, 2011, Vornado proposed to delay the demolition of the hotel due to market conditions. On March 4, 2013, Vornado revealed they were abandoning plans to demolish the hotel and replace it with the office tower. The decision was followed by a statement by chairman Steven Roth: > We're not going to tear down the hotel. In fact, we're going to invest in it > aggressively and try to make it into a really profitable, really good hotel > for our purposes. Vornado has confirmed they will be renovating and improving the hotel, but beyond that not much else is known. Preservationists as well as those in the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society (formerly the Save Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation) would like to see the renovations develop into restorations, bringing the hotel back to its 1919 splendor.https://savehotelpenn.org/ In March 2018, Vornado Realty Trust renewed special permits with the City Planning Commission to develop the proposed 15 Penn Plaza skyscraper on the Hotel Pennsylvania's site. In an April 2018 letter to investors, Vornado chairman Steven Roth mentioned the demolition/15 Penn skyscraper plan as a continued option, but also described Vornado as being at \\"a tipping point\\" with regard to redeveloping the Pennsylvania into a \\"giant convention/entertainment hotel\\". In June 2019, Vornado released new plans to lure their existing tenant, Facebook to the site of the Hotel, with a new design done by Rafael Vi√±oly. According to The Real Deal, however, Facebook has stated they are not moving.  Cafe Rouge  The Cafe Rouge was originally the main restaurant in the Hotel Pennsylvania. It served as a nightclub for many years, but now operates as a separate venue from the hotel entirely, as a multi-purpose space. It is the only space in the hotel that escaped significant alterations during the buildings massive 1980s renovation. = Design = The Cafe Rouge measured , with a ceiling height of , with a main central level and two terraces on either side. The terraces were raised . The Caf√© was designed with a distinctly Italian character. Both the wall base and door trim were made of terracotta, the walls were artificial limestone, and the ceiling was treated to give the effect of old wooden beamed ceilings. The ceiling was carefully studied in color to increase the apparent height of the room, and the beams of the ceiling had carvings of various designs. The east end of the Caf√© had a large floor to ceiling fountain. The Caf√© had large arched windows running along the exterior wall of the room. The arched window design was mimicked on the opposite wall. A bandstand was located on the central floor of the room on the exterior wall. = Big band era = In the late 1930s and early 1940s, The Caf√© Rouge had a big band remote connection to the NBC Red Network (after 1942, the NBC Radio Network) and became known for the performances held inside. Multiple artists played inside the Caf√© ‚Äì such as The Dorsey Brothers, Woody Herman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and The Andrews Sisters. One evening in November 1939, while in the midst of a steady long-term engagement at the Cafe Rouge, bandleader Artie Shaw left the bandstand between sets and decided he had enough of the band business and all the hype of having become, in a year and a half, the leader of the most popular big band in the country. Shaw essentially quit his own band on the spot; the act obliging The New York Times to comment in an editorial. During 1940‚Äì42, the Glenn Miller Orchestra also had repeated long-term bookings in the room during the three years of Miller's highest profile as a bandleader. Miller's orchestra broadcast from the Caf√©; some were recorded by RCA Victor.[ allmusic: Glenn Miller > Biography] Shaw's principal orchestrator from 1937‚Äì39, Jerry Gray, was immediately hired by Miller as a staff arranger when Shaw deserted his band; it was during Miller's 1940 engagement at the hotel that Gray wrote the tune \\"Pennsylvania 6-5000\\" (with lyrics later added by Carl Sigman) that made use of the Hotel's telephone number, 212-736-5000, which is the New York phone number in longest continuous use. Les Brown's band, with its vocalist Doris Day, introduced their song \\"Sentimental Journey\\" at the Caf√© in November 1944. = Later use = The Caf√© Rouge is no longer considered a part of the Hotel Pennsylvania business and has a separate address and entrance from the street at 145 West 32nd Street. The hotel structure is currently owned by Vornado Realty Trust. In 2007, for the Garden in Transit project, adhesive weatherproof paintings of flowers attached to NYC taxicabs were painted inside the Caf√©.Portraits of Hope ‚Äì Garden in Transit ‚Äì NYC Taxi Project 2007 ‚Äì The Official Website The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission reviewed the Caf√© Rouge for landmarking status on the basis of evaluation papers created by the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society (formerly the Save Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation). On October 22, 2010 the Caf√© was rejected as a candidate for landmarking, most likely because the 15 Penn Plaza project was approved and the moderate, but not destructive alterations of the interior since its construction. The 15 Penn Plaza project, would have included the demolition of the Caf√©. Most of the original interior decor remains intact. The fountain and beamed ceiling and other architectural details remain, though the entire room, as well as the ceiling, have been painted over in white. Numerous events from the 2013 New York Fashion Week were held in the Cafe Rouge. In 2014, the Caf√© Rouge was converted to an indoor basketball court known as Terminal 23,http://www.denton- cardewdesign.com/jordan-terminal-23/ to commemorate the launch of the Melo M10 by the Jordan Brand division of Nike. It provides a facility for youth and high school players.

They are known for their high amount of torque at low engine speeds, massive cast-iron blocks and heads and also their high reliability. The F engine had one of the longest production runs of any Toyota engine. The F engines all incorporate overhead valves actuated by pushrods from a gear driven camshaft in the lower portion of the engine. History The engine was developed beginning in December 1948 and was largely a bored out version of the earlier Type B engine. However, Toyota incorporated lessons learned during the war, and the F engine benefitted from lightweight alloy pistons and better lubrication than earlier models. The engine's first installation was in a 1949 version of the Toyota BM truck (called FM with this engine fitted), originally only in units bound for the Brazilian market. The FM became available in the Japanese market as well beginning in 1950. The F engine gained fame as the Land Cruiser engine, it was used in a variety of other large truck applications as well, such as in fire trucks and the Toyota FQ15 trucks. It was also used in the FH26 police patrol car (based on the RH Super), FS20-FS50 police patrol cars (based on the RS20-MS50 Crown), the FHJ and FH24 fire trucks (both based on the RH Super) and the FS35 (based on the RS30 Crown) and FS45V ambulance (based on the MS40 Crown). Engine Revisions =F= The F engine is a 3.9-liter, 75/93 kW (105/125 hp), carburated gasoline engine that is capable of 261/289 N¬∑m (189/209 lb¬∑ft) of torque at 2000 rpm; the difference in power and torque is different depending on the export destination. The original design was started in 1948 when Toyota begun to explore exporting their vehicles internationally. The F engine block, crankshaft and lower end assembly is loosely based on the 1939-63 G.M.C. L6 OHV 235 engine but with a taller deck (rather than the similar but smaller Chevrolet 1937-63 Gen-2 L6 OHV engine), and built under license. The cylinder head and combustion chamber is derived from the Chevrolet L6 OHV \\"stovebolt\\" engine, slightly scaled up. The general idea was consumers would feel comfortable with the engine since it was a familiar design and had a proven track record. None of the bottom end of the engine is interchangeable with these engines. The F engine replaced the early 3.4-liter B gasoline engine introduced in 1938 (not to be confused with the 2.9-liter B diesel engine introduced much later). The early B engine was based on the original 1929-36 Chevrolet Gen-1 207 inline-6, not the later 1937-1963 Gen-2 216, 235 etc. engine. First introduced in export models of the 4-ton BM (FM) truck in November 1949 with 6.4:1 compression and , it then found its way into the Toyota FX/FZ in September 1951. Beginning in 1954 it became installed in the long running FA/FC series of trucks; this was also when the combustion chambers were reworked and the compression ratio was increased, upping output to . The FB type bus also used this engine, as did the Toyota Massy Dyna FC10. From 1964 until 1975 the FA100 truck (and derivatives) used a F engine, although by this time, diesel-engined trucks found more favor in the market. A variety of fire trucks and special bodied patrol cars also used the F engine. In September 1973 the F engine was updated, to a model sometimes referred to as \\"F and a half\\" or F.5. This remains a 3.9-liter, 75/93 kW (105/125 hp), carburated gasoline engine capable of 261/289 N¬∑m (189/209 lb¬∑ft) of torque at 2000 rpm; the major difference between the F and the F.5 is the oiling system. The F.5 uses the same oiling set-up and configuration as its 2F successor. =2F= The second version of the engine, called the 2F, was introduced in 1975. There are a few differences between the F and 2F, i.e., a larger bore in the 2F, removing one oil ring and forcing the oil to travel through the oil filter before the engine. =3F/3F-E= The 3F was introduced in 1985, but did not become available in the United States until 1988. Differences from the 2F engine include a modified cylinder head to reduce warping and separation from inlet and exhaust manifolds, the introduction of electronic fuel injection (EFI) in some markets, a vastly improved emissions system, and a smaller displacement resulting from a shorter piston stroke. The displacement decreased from 4.2 liters to 4 liters, but the engine power increased by and torque increased by . As a result of these changes to the engine design the redline was increased, allowing a wider powerband which made this engine far more suitable for on-road travel. In 1992, the F series engines, after almost 45 years, finally ceased production. In 1993, the F series was replaced by the dual overhead cam (DOHC) 1FZ series. Due to the low rpm design and cast iron construction of these engines, it is not uncommon to see them reach over before needing a major overhaul.

The Tibetan name translates to the \\"Great Place of Complete Joy\\". It currently has over 150 monks in residence. It features a 26.5-meter-high statue of Avalokite≈õvara. It came under state protection in 1994. History Colorized photo of Gandan Monastery in 1913 The monastery was constructed by order of the 5th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu in 1809. The first temple was the Gungaachoilin Datsan. Only one wooden pillar remains from this temple. In 1838, the Gandantegchenlin Temple was built along with the private residence of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. The 13th Dalai Lama stayed in the residence in 1904. In 1840, the Vajradhara Temple was built. In 1869, the Zuu Temple was built. In 1913, the tall Avalokite≈õvara temple was built. In 1925, the temple for keeping the remains of the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu was built. It is now the monastery library. In the 1930s, the Communist government of Mongolia, under the leadership of Khorloogiin Choibalsan and under the influence of Joseph Stalin, destroyed all but a few monasteries and killed more than 15,000 lamas. Gandantegchinlen Khiid monastery, having escaped this mass destruction, was closed in 1938, but then reopened in 1944 and was allowed to continue as the only functioning Buddhist monastery, under a skeleton staff, as a token homage to traditional Mongolian culture and religion. With the end of Marxism in Mongolia in 1990, restrictions on worship were lifted. Statue The original statue, made of copper, was built after appeals to the Mongolian public; its intent was to restore the sight of the 8th Jebtsundamba, also known as Bogd Khan), who had claimed the title of Emperor of Mongolia. The statue was built by Bogd Javzandamba's principal minister, Chin Wan Khanddorj. Russian troops dismantled the original statue in 1938. After the end of the Soviet era, the statue of Avalokite≈õvara was rebuilt in 1996, funded by donations by the Mongolian people. It features 2,286 precious stones and is gilded with gold leaf. Since 1992, the Supreme Leader of the Centre of All Mongolian Buddhists and Abbot of Gandantegchinlen Monastery has been Lama Gabju Choijamts Demberel.

Quote: \\"Born in Walk, Bohemia in 1858, Anton Gag (originally Gaag) emigrated to the United States in 1873 and settled in New Ulm around 1879. Already an island of German and German- Bohemian culture, the city proved an ideal haven for the ...\\" Together with other local painters, Gag decorated altars and walls of several churches in the area. He and a partner also produced a large panorama with eleven panels on the Dakota War of 1862. One of his paintings of the Battle of New Ulm hangs in the Minnesota Capitol building. Biography 1904 painting Attack on New Ulm Anton G√°g (also spelled \\"Gaag\\") was born in 1859 as the last of five children in his family in Walk (now Valcha), a hamlet of 15 homes in the district of Tachau, province of Bohemia, Austrian-Empire. The family were Sudeten-German Catholics. His father George Gaag was a wood craftsman and his mother Theresia Hamperl-Heller (b. 1821) was the legitimized daughter of a sheepherder. The village is now within the Czech Republic. His family immigrated to the United States in 1873, when Gaag was 14; his older sister had earlier emigrated there. They first settled in St. Paul, Minnesota, a city on the Mississippi River. (He changed the spelling of his surname to \\"Gag\\" after some time in the US.) By the time he was growing up there, the city had grown to 30,000 people. For a time he lived with his older brother Joseph, a tailor. In the 1875-76 city directory, Gag identified as an \\"artist\\". By 1878-79 he was working as a \\"cigar maker\\". In 1880 Gag moved to New Ulm, an immigrant community along the Cottonwood River. It had many residents who were ethnic German and Bohemian, and most of his family had settled here. He was befriended by August Schell, founder of Schell's Brewery. The older man acted as a mentor and patron, commissioning Gag to paint murals in a guest house. That year Schell also arranged for Gag to attend art school in Chicago, likely the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, and to study for a time in Milwaukee. After his return to New Ulm, Gag earned most of his income through his photography studio, especially portraits and the popular cartes-de-visite. He pursued working as an artist, although it did not earn him much money. In 1886, Gag married Ida Berndt. She died the next year of complications from child birth.Gwenyth Swain, Wanda G√°g: Storybook Artist, 2005, p. 85. Quote: \\"Chronology 1858 Anton Gag, Wanda Gag's father, is born in Walk, Bohemia. 1869 Elizabeth (Lissi) Biebl, Wanda Gag's mother, is born to a German-Bohemian family living in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. 1886 Anton marries Ida Berndt on May 4 ...\\" Their infant daughter died a month later. In 1892 the young widower Gag married Elizabeth (known as Lissi) Biebl of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, whose family had migrated to Minnesota. They were well-educated immigrants from Kscheutz (Ksire), Bohemia. Lissi had worked as his assistant in his photography studio. They raised a family of seven children in the German tradition. He was known to allow his children much freedom and was non- conforming in his personal behavior. His life and art were formed by the liberal humanist values of the German-Bohemian culture. In 1894, Gag built a Queen-Anne style family home that he decorated with murals. He reserved a room in it for his photographic studio. He also painted works on canvas and board. With other local artists Alexander Schwendihger and Christian Heller, he decorated New Ulm's Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, built in 1883 in the German Baroque style. They created an altar and painted ceiling murals that were similar to traditional church ornament in Bohemia. The trio also worked in 1898 for St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Zumbro Falls, Minnesota. Heller and Gag renovated the Congregational Church in New Ulm that year. Together with Heller, Gag collaborated on a large panorama of the Dakota War of 1862, telling about the second battle of New Ulm. These works, often devoted to historical events, were highly popular. This panorama had 11 panels, each 7 x 10 feet, and painted on a long roll of fabric. It was favorably received. The firm of Heller and Gag also performed interior decoration of homes and clubs, painted drop curtains for theatres, and at times employed up to 30 workmen for their many projects. Gag painted an estimated 60 works: his 1904 painting Battle of New Ulm (1904) depicted part of the Dakota War. It is displayed in the Minnesota State Capitol. Gag died at age 48 in New Ulm, Minnesota in 1908 from tuberculosis. He is buried in the New Ulm City Cemetery. His daughter, Wanda G√°g (who added the accent to her name), became a celebrated author and artist in her own right. She continued to live in the family house after her parents died. Legacy Gag Family Home The house where the Gag family lived, at 226 N. Washington, New Ulm, is now known as the Wanda G√°g House. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is open for public tours. The house has been preserved and is operated as a museum to tell the story of this family, showing examples of their art and way of life during their residence.Wanda Gag House The exterior of the house has been restored to the original colors of the period when the Gag family lived there, including Wanda after her parents died. The interior is also being restored to that time period. The process has uncovered detailed, decorative hand-painting done by Gag and Wanda on walls throughout the house.

Need for cognition has been variously defined as \\"a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways\\" and \\"a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world\\". Higher NFC is associated with increased appreciation of debate, idea evaluation, and problem solving. Those with a high need for cognition may be inclined towards high elaboration. Those with a lower need for cognition may display opposite tendencies, and may process information more heuristically, often through low elaboration. Need for cognition is closely related to the five factor model domain openness to experience, typical intellectual engagement, and epistemic curiosity (see below). History Cohen, Stotland and Wolfe (1955), in their work on individual differences in cognitive motivation, identified a \\"need for cognition\\" which they defined as \\"the individual's need to organize his experience meaningfully\\", the \\"need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways\\", and \\"need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world\\" (p. 291). They argued that, if this \\"need\\" were frustrated, it would generate \\"feelings of tension and deprivation\\" that would instigate \\"active efforts to structure the situation and increase understanding\\" (p. 291), though the particular situations arousing and satisfying the need may vary (p. 291). Cohen argued that even in structured situations, people high in NFC see ambiguity and strive for higher standards of cognitive clarity. Cohen and colleaguesCohen, A.R. (1957). \\"Need for Cognition and Order of Communication as Determinants of Opinion Change,\\" 79‚Äì97. In Hovland, C.I. (ed.), The Order of Presentation in Persuasion, Yale University Press, (New Haven). themselves identified multiple prior identifications of need for cognition, citing works by Murphy, Maslow, Katz, Harlow and Asch.Murphy, G. Personality. New York: Harper, 1947Asch, S.E. Social Psychology. New York, Prentice-Hall, 1952\\". They distinguished their concept from the apparently similar \\"intolerance of ambiguity\\" proposed by Frenkel-Brunswik, arguing that NFC does not reflect the need to experience an integrated and meaningful world. Contemporary research suggests that Cohen's conception of need is, however, closer to tolerance of ambiguity, need for structure, or need for cognitive closure than to current ideas of need for cognition. For instance, studies using Cohen's measures indicated avoidance of ambiguity and a need to get \\"meaning\\" even if this meant relying on heuristics or expert advice rather than careful scrutiny of incoming information. Building on this work, Cacioppo therefore moved away from drive-reduction toward measuring individual differences in the self-reward potential of cognitive activity, stressing (p. 118) that they were using the word need in the statistical sense of a \\"likelihood or tendency\\", rather than in the rudimentary biological sense of \\"tissue deprivation\\", they defined the need for cognition as an individual's tendency to \\"engage in and enjoy thinking\\" (p. 116) and the tendency to \\"organize, abstract, and evaluate information\\" (p. 124)‚Äîor, variously, as a stable, but individually different \\"tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors\\", or an \\"intrinsic motivation to engage in effortful cognitive endeavors... and exercise their mental faculties\\", or an \\"intrinsic motivation for effortful thought\\". Cacioppo and Petty (1982) created their own 34-item scale to measure the need for cognition. Two years later, an 18-item version was published and in most of the cases reported in the subsequent literature it is this amended scale that is administered. Recently, a 6-item version of the need for cognition scale was proposed. Features People high in the need for cognition are more likely to form their attitudes by paying close attention to relevant arguments (i.e., via the central route to persuasion), whereas people low in the need for cognition are more likely to rely on peripheral cues, such as how attractive or credible a speaker is. People low in need for cognition are also more likely to rely on stereotypes alone in judging other people than those high in need for cognition. Psychological research on the need for cognition has been conducted using self-report tests, where research participants answered a series of statements such as \\"I prefer my life to be filled with puzzles that I must solve\\" and were scored on how much they felt the statements represented them. The results have suggested that people who are high in the need for cognition scale score slightly higher in verbal intelligence tests but no higher in abstract reasoning tests. Research has concluded that individuals high in NFC are less likely to attribute higher social desirability to more attractive individuals or to mates. College students high in NFC report higher life satisfaction.The need for cognition and life satisfaction among college students A study on lucid dreaming found that frequent and occasional lucid dreamers scored higher on NFC than non- lucid dreamers. This suggests there is continuity between waking and dreaming cognitive styles. Researchers have argued that this is because self- reflectiveness or self-focused attention is heightened in lucid dreams and also is associated with greater need for cognition. =Relationship to intelligence= A number of studies have found moderate correlations between NFC and measures of verbal intelligence. One study found that need for cognition had a moderate positive correlation with fluid intelligence (reasoning ability, particularly verbal, and to a lesser extent numeric and figural reasoning), and a weaker correlation with crystallised intelligence (knowledge), which had much smaller positive correlations. =Dual-system theory= NFC has been incorporated into Epstein's dual-system theory of personality called cognitive-experiential self-theory. The theory proposes that people have two information processing systems, a rational system and an experiential system. The rational system is thought to be logical, verbal and relatively unemotional. The experiential system is thought to be intuitive, based on images and highly reliant on emotion. A modified version of the Need for Cognition scale has been used to assess individual differences in the rational system, whereas the experiential system has been assessed using a scale called Faith in Intuition. Research shows that the two systems are uncorrelated and hence independent of each other. That is individuals either high or low in need for cognition may also make use of their intuitions in forming judgments. In fact, individuals high and low in need for cognition respectively may make use of their intuitions in differing ways. When individuals give little thought to their judgments these judgments may be influenced directly by emotions, intuitions, and images in an automatic way. On the other hand, those who are high in need for cognition tend to give more thought to their judgments, and the thoughts generated may be indirectly biased by their emotions, intuitions, and images. Hence individuals high in need for cognition are not necessarily more \\"rational\\" than those low in this trait, if their faith in intuition is also high. Rather, their \\"irrational\\" intuitions tend to be given more thoughtful elaboration than those who are low in need for cognition and yet also high in faith in intuition. =Biases and decision making= NFC is associated with the amount of thought that goes into making a decision. Both high and low levels of the trait may be associated with particular biases in judgment. People low in need for cognition tend to show more bias when this bias is due to relying on mental shortcuts, that is, heuristic biases. People high in this trait tend to be more affected by biases that are generated by effortful thought. False memories High need for cognition is associated with a greater susceptibility to the creation of false memories associated with certain learning tasks. In a commonly used research paradigm, participants are asked to memorise a list of related words. Recognition is tested by having them pick out learned words from a set of studied and non-studied items. Certain non-studied items are conceptually related to studied items (e.g., chair if the original list contained table and legs). People high in NFC are more likely to show false memory for these lures, due to their greater elaboration of learned items in memory as they are more likely to think of semantically related (but non-studied) items. Halo effects A bias associated with low need for cognition is the halo effect, a phenomenon in which attractive or likeable people tend to be rated as superior on a variety of other characteristics (e.g., intelligence). People low on NFC are more likely to rely on stereotypes rather than individual features of a person when rating a novel target. People high in NFC still show a halo effect however, albeit a smaller one, perhaps because their thoughts about the target are still biased by the target's attractiveness. Relationship with personality traits =Related constructs= NFC has been found to be strongly associated with a number of independently developed constructs, specifically epistemic curiosity, typical intellectual engagement, and openness to ideas. * Epistemic curiosity can be defined as ‚Äúdesire for knowledge that motivates individuals to learn new ideas, eliminate information-gaps, and solve intellectual problems‚Äù. Typical intellectual engagement was proposed by Goff and Ackerman (1992) and was defined as a \\"personality construct that represents an individual‚Äôs aversion or attraction to tasks that are intellectually taxing\\". * Openness to ideas is a facet of openness to experience associated with \\"aspects of being open minded, engaging in unconventional thoughts, and solving problems and thinking as an end in itself\\". ::Based on the very large positive correlation between NFC and typical intellectual engagement (r = .78) it has been argued that they may be essentially the same construct. * Further studies have found that NFC, typical intellectual engagement, epistemic curiosity, and openness to ideas were all strongly intercorrelated. Factor analysis showed that measures of all four constructs loaded strongly onto a single factor suggesting they all share a common conceptual basis. ::The author of this study argued that although the four constructs lack discriminant validity they are not necessarily all conceptually equivalent as each one may emphasise particular aspects of functioning more than others. * A study comparing need for cognition and openness to ideas using confirmatory factor analysis found that although the two constructs were very strongly related they were not redundant. NFC and openness to ideas had somewhat contrasting correlation patterns with other personality traits. ::For example, NFC was more strongly correlated with emotional stability and activity than openness to ideas, whereas openness to ideas was more strongly correlated with novelty and experience seeking than NFC. =Other personality characteristics= * Within the Big Five model of personality, NFC has been found to relate positively to openness to experience most strongly and to a more moderate extent to conscientiousness, particularly the competence and achievement striving facets, and to relate inversely to an extent to neuroticism. * Regarding Cloninger's temperament traits, NFC has been related negatively to harm avoidance and positively to persistence and was unrelated to reward dependence or novelty seeking. * NFC has only a weak positive relationship with sensation seeking, specifically a weak correlation with the boredom susceptibility subscale but no relationship to the other subscales. * NFC has a modest inverse correlation with negative affect. NFC had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect, although it was positively correlated with feelings of activity, interest, and alertness. * NFC has been positively related to other, theoretically unrelated, personality characteristics such as self-esteem, masculine sex-role attitudes, and absorption. * NFC is negatively related to social anxiety (more strongly in females than males). * It has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery, and hence greater self-esteem, although it is also possible that higher self-esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking. * NFC may be related to masculine sex-role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality. * Regarding absorption, people high in NFC may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks. * Regarding social anxiety, it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation. *NFC is positively related to stimulation, self-direction, and universalism values, and negatively to security and conformity values. Consumers Research has shown that high- need-for-cognition consumers prefer open-ended comparative advertising that allows consumers to decide which brand is best.

Missionary career Following his conversion to Christianity at age 17, Baller was one of the first students of the Missionary Institute established in the East End of London by Henry Grattan Guinness. Baller applied to the China Inland Mission and left England on 3 September 1873 with Charles Henry Judd, M. Henry Taylor, and Mary Bowyer. They arrived at Shanghai on 5 November 1873. The following year, he and Mary Bowyer were married at Shanghai, on 17 September. Mary was a veteran missionary to China who had ventured out with Hudson Taylor on the Lammermuir (clipper) in 1866, at the beginning of the China Inland Mission. She had been baptised by Taylor, along with some others, en route at the Sunda Strait. Baller studied the Chinese language in Nanking (Nanjing), then just recently liberated from the ravages of the Taiping rebels. Baller was then appointed superintendent of missions in Anhui and Jiangsu with the China Inland Mission. He went to Shanxi in 1876, with George King, to distribute famine relief. Due to the continued famine in 1878, he returned to Shanxi with Taylor's wife Jane Elizabeth Faulding and single women missionaries Horne and Crickmay. Baller took a China Inland Mission party through Hunan, facing antiforeign opposition, to Guiyang in 1880, visiting the capital of Guizhou. He was appointed secretary to the first China Inland Mission China Council in 1885. Mary (Bowyer) Baller.  Writing and teaching career In 1896, he was appointed principal of the new training home for CIM male missionaries at Anqing, Sichuan. There he not only helped train missionaries in the Chinese language but also published his lectures in Letters, from an Old Missionary to His Nephew (1907). In 1897, he began his extensive literary work. From 1900 to 1918 he served on the committee to revise the Mandarin Bible as a member of the Union Mandarin Bible Revision Committee at Beijing, for the New Testament in 1907, and the Old Testament 1907‚Äì1918. Among his many books, the best known are An Anglo-Chinese Dictionary, The Mandarin Primer (at least 14 editions), An Idiom a Lesson, An Analytical Vocabulary of the New Testament, Lessons in Wenli, An English Translation of the Sacred Edict, and The Life of Hudson Taylor.

He specialized in bareback bronc riding and saddle bronc riding and competed on the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) circuit. He was the World All-Around Cowboy Champion from 1985 to 1987 at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR). He was also the World Bareback Riding Champion from 1985 to 1986. The ProRodeo Hall of Fame inducted him in 1992 in the all- around category.  Early life  He was born on October 28, 1956 to Keith and True Feild in Peoa, Utah. He was of British and Scandinavian descent. Feild was raised near Peoa in the Kamas Valley, where Feild saw his first rodeo. \\"It was the most exciting thing I had ever seen, to watch those cowboys stay on those broncs. It was love at first sight,\\" said Feild. Feild started riding calves after that, which he did at his parent's ranch in Peoa. It was in Ogden at the Golden Spike Rodeo where he rode his first bucking horse. \\"It was a junior rodeo and it was not a full-sized horse, but it bucked and I stayed on. They gave me a buckle for an award ... first thing I ever won.\\" When he grew older, he attended college. With the assistance of an intercollegiate rodeo scholarship, he attended Utah Valley Community College, now known as Utah Valley University, and Weber State University. At Utah Valley University, he qualified for the National High School Finals Rodeo three times. He also earned three National Finals appearances. Then, in 1980, with some assistance from friends, he turned professional.  Career  Feild competed on the PRCA rodeo circuit throughout his professional rodeo career. He was the World All- Around Cowboy Champion from 1985 to 1987, and the World Bareback Riding Champion from 1985 to 1986 at the NFR.ProRodeo Records and Stats, p. 297-298. He won the NFR All-Around Average from 1986. to 1988.Wrangler NFR, p. 373. He won the NFR Average in Bareback Riding in 1984 and 1986.Wrangler NFR, p. 373. Feild became the first rough-stock cowboy since Larry Mahan to earn World All- Around titles since 1973. In 1980, he was the PRCA Resistol Rookie of the Year.PRCA Awards, p. 625. In the years 1981, 1988, and 1991, Feild won the Linderman Award.PRCA Awards, p. 623. This award is given to the cowboy who works both ends of the arena (this means timed events on one side and rough- stock on the other side) and has the highest earnings. Feild was also an established team roper. In 1987, Feild took the record for single-season earnings in the bareback bronc event to $114,657. In that same year, he also set a new single rodeo earnings record of $75,219. He held the record for single-season arena earnings until 1986 until Ty Murray set a new record of $213,771. In 1990, Feild was the first rough-stock contestant to win more than $1 million in his career in the PRCA. He was the third cowboy to do it at any level. Tom Ferguson did it first and Roy Cooper did it second. According to many personnel, Feild was a staple at the Ogden Pioneer Days rodeo in Ogden, Utah, for as long as they can remember. The committee made him the focus of an opening act which lasted around 10 years up until his death. He was such an icon to the rodeo that it inducted him into its Utah Cowboy Hall of Fame. It also recognized him as the Utah County honoree for the National Day of the American Cowboy. Each of these two honors were awarded to Feild inaugurally in Ogden. \\"Someday, when rodeo people look back at what I've done, I'd like them to say these things: that I rode tough; I could ride with pain and courage; that I was a fierce competitor in the arena, but a quiet, respectable man outside the gate. I just want to be remembered as a cowboy,\\" said the soft- spoken champion. \\"That probably says it all.\\"  Personal life  He coached the UVSC rodeo team and lived in Elk Ridge, Utah with his wife Veronica. He has three children and seven grandchildren.  Death and legacy  Feild died on February 15, 2016, in Elk Ridge, Utah at the age of 59 after battling stage 4 pancreatic cancer. His son Kaycee Feild won four World Bareback Bronc Champion titles at the NFR from 2011 to 2014.

It aired on February 10, 1999, featuring characters from Disney's Aladdin franchise including, Aladdin, Princess Jasmine, Jafar and Abu. Summary  As Hades goes through his usual job of bringing fresh souls in, Pain and Panic tell him that one of the souls is not cooperating. The soul in question, Jafar, approaches Hades and demands to be sent back. Hades is at first unconcerned, but they find a common ground: Jafar tried to overtake Agrabah, Hades is trying to overtake Mount Olympus, and they both have been defeated by \\"upstart boys\\". They make a bet that they can defeat each other's respective nemesis, and Hades gives Jafar a new snake staff, which turns him into a mortal as long as it remains in his possession. Then he orders Jafar to attack Hercules while he's training on Philoctetes's island. At said island, Phil is trying to teach Hercules not to use just his strength, but also his brains from time to time. Jafar appears and summons several monsters to go after Hercules. Jafar initially gains the upper hand until Hercules picks up Phil's \\"statue head\\" house, bashes the beasts and proceeds to smash it on Jafar, who gets knocked back to the Underworld. Hades then decides to send Pain and Panic to Agrabah to take Aladdin out. When the minions arrive in the Arabian city, they first mistake Abu for Aladdin, but the real Aladdin, along with his wife Jasmine, arrives on Carpet. After a scuffle, Pain and Panic are about to finish Aladdin off, but Aladdin convinces them to look into his lamp (by telling them not to look into it), and Genie's hand punches them all the way back into the Underworld. With this humiliating double defeat, Jafar offers the idea of getting Hercules and Aladdin into fighting and killing each other. Hades likes the idea and puts the plan into motion by kidnapping Abu from Agrabah and Icarus from Prometheus Academy. When Hercules can't find Icarus, an old man (Jafar in disguise) fools him by telling him that a \\"young rogue named Aladdin\\" kidnapped him. Later, in Agrabah, Aladdin and Jasmine are led to believe by Pain and Panic (disguised as Hercules) that Hercules kidnapped Abu. When Hercules, Phil and Pegasus arrive in Agrabah, Aladdin, Jasmine and Carpet engage them. Aladdin gets Hercules to chase him through the alleyways of Agrabah to an old abandoned building and to punch enough holes in the walls to bring most of the house down on top of Hercules. While Hercules holds it up, Aladdin demands to know where he hid Abu; Hercules responds by wanting to know where Aladdin took Icarus. This leads Aladdin to realize they have been tricked, but before they can work it out, the building collapses on both of them. While Jafar and Hades believe that the heroes have been destroyed, Hercules gets himself and Aladdin out of the rubble. They piece together that they were set up and that Hades and Jafar are holding Icarus and Abu in the Underworld. Aladdin wants to charge in to rescue them, but Hercules thinks of another way. As Hades tells Jafar of his plans for Olympian domination (and offers Jafar the 'Lord of the Dead' title in his stead), Pain and Panic yell alert them to Hercules and Aladdin's impending arrival. Jafar is sent to stop them; but acting on an idea by Hercules, he and Aladdin have swapped their identities, fooling Jafar into engaging them with the wrong countermeasures. Jafar is unable to stop Aladdin from nabbing the snake staff and tossing it to Hercules, who snaps it in half. This effect turns Jafar back into a soul and pulls him down into the River Styx for good. Icarus and Abu have in the meantime escaped and begin punching Hades, until he threatens to make them \\"permanent residents\\". Hercules and Aladdin congratulate each other before Aladdin takes Jasmine, Abu and Carpet back to Agrabah, telling Hercules that he'll make a great hero someday. Icarus, having bonded with Abu, asks Hercules if they can get a monkey. Cast * Tate Donovan as Hercules, a hero-in-training who is learning to not just barrel through, but use his head. He first encounters Jafar when Hades gambles that he can't beat him; Jafar is proven wrong, despite Hercules' clumsiness, and so they capture Hercules' friend Icarus. Jafar, in disguise, frames Aladdin, who Hercules pursues to Agrabah, being defeated due to unfamiliar surroundings and Aladdin's agility, and his overuse of strength. Once the two realize that both their friends have been captured, they deduce that Hades and Jafar have teamed up. Hercules then teams up with Aladdin to rescue Icarus and Abu by disguising himself as Aladdin, while he does likewise, as opposed to head-on assault. At the end of the episode, Aladdin tells Hercules he'll make a great hero. * Scott Weinger as Aladdin, a street rat turned hero and heir to the throne of Agrabah, who is first encountered by Pain and Panic after they mistake Abu for him. He defeats them by having them look into his lamp. After realizing Aladdin is tricky, Hades has Jafar capture Abu and Pain and Panic frame Hercules for it. Confronting a newly arrived Hercules, Aladdin leads him around the city, dodging his blows but quickly discovering that he is too strong to face head on. After collapsing a building on Hercules, the pair realize that Jafar and Hades have teamed up and set them both up, and they go to the Underworld disguised as each other to defeat the villains and rescue their friends. Aladdin tells Hercules that he'll make a great hero at the end of the episode. * James Woods as Hades, Lord of the Dead and Hercules's archenemy, who is constantly irked by Hercules getting in the way. After encountering a reluctantly dead Jafar, he makes him alive again so long as he holds his serpent staff, and bets correctly that he cannot defeat Hercules. However, when Hades sends Pain and Panic after Aladdin, he proves too tricky as well. Jafar then proposes that the pair have a \\"misunderstanding\\" involving their friends being captured, which Hades puts into effect. He offers Jafar title of \\"Lord of the Dead\\" after they are assumed dead. However, the two heroes realize they've been played, and come to the Underworld for their friends, who Hades reluctantly releases after Jafar is defeated. * Jonathan Freeman as Jafar, the deceased archenemy of Aladdin, who wants revenge on him, and to rule Agrabah. He convinces Hades to make him flesh and bones again; however, this is conditional: Jafar only remains alive so long as he holds his staff. He then attacks Hercules, who proves too strong despite his clumsiness; Hades likewise finds Aladdin too tricky to handle. Jafar then proposes that the heroes have a \\"misunderstanding\\" involving their friends being captured, which Hades puts into effect. Unfortunately for them, the two heroes realize the deception and come to the Underworld for their friends; Jafar doesn't realize that they are disguised as each other, and his staff is broken, with his soul going to the River Styx permanently. * Linda Larkin as Princess Jasmine, Aladdin's wife, who helps Aladdin deal with Pain and Panic. Jasmine and Aladdin give Hercules a not-so-warm welcome after thinking he has captured Abu. She realizes that Hercules and Aladdin have been deceived, and helps deduce that Jafar and Hades are behind it. Jasmine is at first eyed by Phil, until she tells him sternly,\\"I'm married\\". * Robert Costanzo as Philoctetes, Hercules' mentor, who constantly tries to convince him to not just barrel through things, but to use his head once in a while. He is trussed up by Jafar during their initial confrontation after advising Hercules this, but Hercules later uses this advice when invading the Undeworld. He seems attracted to Jasmine, until she replies sternly, \\"I'm married\\". * French Stewart as Icarus, Hercules' best friend, who is captured by Hades and Jafar (using a banana trail). He and Abu bond while they are being held captive, and after Abu frees them, he asks Hercules if they can get a monkey. * Frank Welker as Abu, Aladdin's pet monkey, who is kidnapped by Jafar using a banana trail. He is held with Icarus in the Underworld, where the two bond. Abu angrily confronts Hades until threatened with death, and leaves with Aladdin and Jasmine for Agrabah. * Bobcat Goldthwait as Pain and Matt Frewer as Panic, Hades' minions, who are sent first to deal with Aladdin, who tricks them into looking into Genie's lamp; his fist knocks them all the way back to Greece. Pain then disguises himself as Hercules, saying he has kidnapped Abu. Chronology An unusual aspect of this episode is that it indicates that Aladdin and Hercules existed around the same time, though one would logically conclude that they lived at least a millennium apart (Hercules being from ancient Greece, while Aladdin is from the era of the Islamic empires, probably of Abbasid Caliphate). On the other hand, some of Aladdin's enemies, such as Mechanicles, Queen Hippsodeth and Dominus Tusk, could easily be the same vintage as Hercules. Also during the \\"A Whole New World\\" part in the original 1992 film, Aladdin and Jasmine can be seen riding through what could be Greece. Another thing to note is that in The Return of Jafar, Genie states that he raced with Hercules. Princess Jasmine mentions that she and Aladdin are married, indicating this episode takes place after the events of Aladdin and the King of Thieves, which would explain Iago's absence in this episode and also explain why Aladdin has the same outfit on which he wore in Aladdin and the King of Thieves, this is additionally backed up by the fact that Aladdin appears physically older than his last appearance. This is a bit strange, though, since the episode seems to indicate that Jafar died recently, though there was an entire movie, and indeed a TV series, between his death in The Return of Jafar and this episode. It is possible that time passed differently in the underworld and that Jafar had to go through a waiting line before meeting up with Hades, as it is mentioned in many ancient texts (such as Virgil's Aeneid) that souls have to wait a long time to cross the river.

He was King Alfred Professor of English at Liverpool University. He also helped set up the Department of English at the University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. Early life Born at Holt, Norfolk, on 3 June 1861, Elton was the only child of Sarah and the Reverend Charles Allen Elton (1820‚Äì1887), the headmaster of Gresham's School, where Oliver was taught by his father until he proceeded to Marlborough College and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was a scholar from 1880 to 1885. He graduated with a BA with first class honours in Literae Humaniores in 1884.Foster, Joseph, Alumni Oxonienses 1880-1892 His friends at Oxford included Leonard Huxley, Michael Sadler and Dugald Sutherland MacColl, whose sister he later married. Career Elton's first work was as a tutor and lecturer in London, while preparing school editions of Shakespeare and Milton. He translated Einar Hafli√∞ason's Laurentius Saga as The Life of Laurence Bishop of H√≥lar in Iceland (L√°rent√≠us K√°lfsson) into English.Oliver Elton (trans.), The Life of Laurence Bishop of H√≥lar in Iceland (London: Rivington, 1890), available at https://archive.org/details/lifeoflaurencebi00einauoft. In this he was encouraged by Frederick York Powell, whose biography Elton would later publish in 1906.Smith, D. N., revised by Rebecca Mills, Elton, Oliver (1861‚Äì1945), literary scholar and translator, in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) In 1890 he went as a lecturer to Owens College, Manchester, remaining for ten years. During his time there he published a translation of nine of the books of the Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus, a study of Michael Drayton, and The Augustan Ages (1899) which brought him recognition from the academic literary world. Meanwhile, he got to know Charles Edward Montague and wrote for the Manchester Guardian. He went to Liverpool in 1901 as Professor of English Literature and stayed till his retirement in 1925. While there, he completed two thirds (four volumes) of his Survey of English Literature and lectured and wrote on Milton, Tennyson, Henry James, Chekhov and others. After retirement he went to Harvard as a visiting professor and later settled in Oxford. He completed the Survey of English Literature, and published a book on English poetry: The English Muse: a Sketch (1933). He also continued an interest in Russian and other Slavic literature (mainly Serbian) which had begun during the first world war, and published further translations, notably of Pushkin's Eugene Onegin (1937). Elton's encyclopedic range is impressive and George Sampson, in the Cambridge History of English Literature, brackets him with two of his contemporaries who were also \\"scholars on the heroic scale of learning \\": William Paton Ker and George Saintsbury. Family In 1888 Elton married Letitia Maynard MacColl, the sister of his Oxford friend Dugald Sutherland MacColl. Letitia became a children's writer. They had three sons, one of whom was the biologist Charles Sutherland Elton.

His writing often touches upon political and social issues, nationalism and democracy. Early life Edwards was born in Cardiff. He was educated at Whitchurch High (Grammar), Cardiff, Lampeter University, Hughes Hall, Cambridge and the University of Wales at Aberystwyth. Career Edwards' early work was produced at the Sherman Theatre, Cardiff. These included At The End of The Bay, Canned Goods and Looking For The World. At the beginning of his career, he was introduced to Edward Bond who became, and still is, a supporter of his work. Before taking up a residency at Theatr Clwyd in 1989 and producing the play the fourth world, Edwards worked with The Haymarket Theatre in Leicester where his productions were Long To Rain Over Us and Low People. At this time Edwards began to be published by Oberon Books Ltd., London. Its publishing editor, James Hogan, encouraged The Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow to produce his play Casanova Undone which was followed a year later by Wittgenstein's Daughter. Both were subsequently produced at The White Bear Theatre in London. In the early 1990s Edwards worked with Mark Dornford May at Broomhill which resulted in the opera The Juniper Tree, written with composer Andew Toovey and The Beggar's New Clothes, a reworking of The Beggar's Opera, with music by Warren Belshaw. The latter transferred to The Cockpit Theatre, London. Edwards returned to working in Wales with Sgript Cymru and in 2002 his comedy Franco's Bastard was produced at Chapter Arts Centre. The play revisits Edwards' time as a young student at Lampeter University when he met the Welsh Nationalist activist and leader of the right wing Free Wales Army, Juian Cayo Evans. During a political falling out, the socialist Edwards was attacked by Evans and a fellow member of the FWA, which resulted in a month's stay at Chepstow Hospital where Edwards' head injuries were treated. The play centres on a sometimes scathing and sometimes affectionate account of the charismatic Evans. During the play's premier a group of Welsh Nationalists protested the play by leading walkouts and throwing stink bombs, an event that prompted questions in parliament. In 2003, Edwards wrote the libretto for Keith Burstein's opera, Manifest Destiny. The opera was performed at The Tricycle Theatre, London as a benefit for the Redgraves' Guantanamo Human Rights Commission and subsequently played at The Edinburgh Festival in 2005. At the same time, in the same season, Cambridge University's ADC produced Edwards' play Astrakhan (Winter). In 2013, after writing The Opportunist for The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Edwards turned away from writing for the theatre, arguing that \\"British Theatre has become a director's theatre. Directors want an easy life and, in the main, hire only TV writers now.\\" His play Over Milk Wood, a response to the radio play by Dylan Thomas, has been translated into Catalan as Sobre El Bosc Lacti and published by Arola Editors, Tarragona. There have been productions of his work at NIDA in Sydney, Australia and That Theatre, Copenhagen, Denmark and a public reading of The Pimp in New York. For many years, Edwards has worked with Theatre in Education companies most notably Spectacle Theatre and collaborated very successfully with director Steve Davis. Edwards has recently finished The Vote, a play about the collapse of British democracy. He is working on Nude a play about the Welsh painter Augustus John. He is also working on a collection of short stories with the working title From the Backland. Edwards founded the Creative Writing program at University of Wales Trinity Saint David, Lampeter, where he was a lecturer until 2019. He is the editor and founder of the literary magazine The Lampeter Review. Personal life Edwards is married to Gwenda and has three children and eight grandchildren. He lives in Aberaeron in West Wales.

It is organised by the Lega Serie A and the participating teams that take part in Serie A and Serie B: the first edition was held in the 1962-63 season, in place of the \\"Campionato Cadetti\\". Due to ceremonial reasons, the league is officially called Campionato Primavera Tim - Trofeo Giacinto Facchetti. Torino have the highest number of titles, having won the Campionato Primavera nine times. From the 2017‚Äì18 season, the league was replaced with Campionato Primavera 1 and Campionato Primavera 2. Competition format From the 2012‚Äì13 season players who are at least 15 years old and who are under 19 in the calendar year of the season ends (i.e. born 1994 for 2012‚Äì13 season). At the discretion of the league, teams are allowed a maximum of four \\"non-quota\\" () players, of which one has no age limit and the rest must be under 20; in 2011‚Äì12 season the age limit was 20 and for the \\"non-quota\\" player was 21. The initial phase of the Primavera Championship consists of 3 rounds, each consisting of 14 teams, organised by geographical criteria: teams play in a true robin-round format, for a total of 26 games in the regular season. The top two in each group have direct access to the final phase: the remaining two positions are assigned via the play- offs, with the participation of eight teams (the third and fourth ranked, plus the fifth best). The matching pattern is as following: *First round: **Best 3rd vs. second-best 5th (match n. 1); **Best 4th vs. second-best 4th (match n. 2); **Best 5th vs. second-best 3rd (match n. 3); **Worst 3rd vs. worst 4th (match n. 4); *Second round: **Winner of match 1 vs. winner of match 2; **Winner of match 3 vs. winner of match 4; The latest slots (two) are awarded after a play-off series, in which eight teams are involved: the final stage (also ¬´Final Eight¬ª), held on a neutral venue, is based on knockout format. The final phase of the Primavera Championship is hosted every year by a different region: the winning team is awarded a trophy, like the Serie A trophy (received, as a reward, by the Italian Champions).

They played at the Stade Saint-Lazare, which can hold 3,000 fans. The club changed names twice during its existence, being Limoges Football Club at formation, Limoges Foot 87 from 1987 to 2003, and then returning to Limoges Football Club from 2003 until dissolution in 2020. As of 27 January 2020, a proposal exists to reform the club as Limoges Football from the 2020‚Äì21 season. The club played in Division 1 from 1958 to 1961. History Limoges Football Club was formed in 1947 through a merger of two rival clubs, Red Star Athl√©tique de Limoges (founded 1917) and Star Limousin Universit√© Club (founded 1906). In 1957, after playing the majority of their first ten years at the top level of amateur football, they gained professional status, and became part of an expanded French Division 2. They finished third in the table, which gained them promotion to the top division. The club stayed in French Division 1 for three seasons, with their highest finish being 10th in 1959‚Äì60. From relegation in 1961 until 1987, the club competed in Division 2 or Division 3. They came close to promotion back to Division 1 in both 1964 and 1965, qualifying for the playoffs on both occasions. Twice during this period they reached the quarter-final of the Coupe de France, losing after extra time to Stade de Reims in 1962‚Äì63 and to Stade Rennais over two legs in 1969‚Äì70. At the end of the 1972‚Äì73 season they were relegated to Division 3, returning back to Division 2 in 1977. In June 1987, despite a 7th place finish in Division 2, the leaders of the club declared bankruptcy with a debt of more than five million francs. The club, reborn under the title Limoges Foot 87, were administratively relegated to French Division 4. From 1987‚Äì2003, the club played at the fourth and fifth levels of French football. At the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, the club was again forced into bankruptcy, and were administratively relegated to level 6 of the French football league system; Limoges Foot 87 was dissolved, and the reborn club took back the old title of Limoges Football Club. The club won promotion back to Championnat de France amateur 2 immediately, as champions of the 2003‚Äì04 Division d'Honneur Centre- Ouest (Centre-West) group. They spent time at level five and six until 2014 when they successfully won promotion to level 4 from Championnat de France Amateur 2, but were relegated again in 2014‚Äì15. In 2017 the club won promotion to the new fourth level Championnat National 2, but despite finishing 12th in their group in 2017‚Äì18 they were relegated administratively back to the fifth level after being placed into administration during the season. At the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season they were relegated administratively again to the Regional league due to not being in compliance with the financial rules of the competition. In January 2020 the club was placed into compulsory liquidation, with the senior men's teams declaring forfeit. The sporting rights of the club were assigned to a new entity, Limoges Football, by the FFF on 24 January 2020, ensuring continuation of junior and women's football at the club. The future of the senior men's teams will be defined at the end of the 2019‚Äì20 season.

Biography =Early life= Born in Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, Bonventre was a member of the Sicilian Mafia. During the 1960s, the New York crime families imported young Sicilian men from Sicily to the United States to work as drug traffickers and hitmen. American mobsters soon derisively dubbed the Sicilians \\"Zips\\" due to their fast speech. Bonanno boss Carmine Galante brought Bonventre to New York to be his bodyguard. Bonventre soon became the unofficial underboss of the Bonanno family Sicilians. Bonventre's uncle was John Bonventre, a former Bonanno underboss. Bonventre was also a cousin of the first family boss Joseph Bonanno and Bonanno mobster Baldassare \\"Baldo\\" Amato. In 1979, Cesare and Baldassare were arrested for carrying illegal firearms in their car after being stopped by police at the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream, New York, shortly before the execution of Carmine Galante. In April 1981, they were convicted and served two months. Ralph Blumenthal wrote in Last Days of the Sicilians: The FBI's War Against the Mafia that Cesare identified himself to law enforcement as \\"a pizza man from Brooklyn\\". He was a regular habituate of his cousin Baldassare Amato's deli run by his family located at Second Avenue and Eighty-fourth Street in Yorkville, New York. The deli had burned down not long before January 1984 but in its place the Amato family built an apartment building with a sleek Italian cafe and restaurant called Biffi. Bonventre's moniker was \\"The Tall Guy\\" because he stood close to tall. Lean and handsome, Bonventre frequented clubs such as The Toyland Social Club and the Knickerbocker Avenue area with other Sicilian mobsters. In the book King of the Godfathers, Anthony M. Destefano writes that there was something about Bonventre that made him stand out from the other ethnic Italians. His stylish clothing, aviator sunglasses and European man purses embodied Italian couture. Bonventre normally wore his shirt unbuttoned with a gold crucifix hanging from his neck. =Galante assassination= Galante was allegedly murdered for not sharing his drug trafficking profits with the family. The hit on Galante required Philip \\"Rusty\\" Rastelli to get approval from the Zips, Gambino crime family boss Paul Castellano and the other Commission bosses. It was later rumored that the Mafia Commission, which oversees all the crime families, had sanctioned Galante's murder and arranged for Bonventre and Baldo, Galante's bodyguards, to betray him. On July 12, 1979, Bonventre allegedly participated in the murders of Galante and two of his friends. He had been dropped off for lunch at Joe & Mary's, an Italian restaurant in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. After a short while, bodyguards Bonventre and Baldo Amato joined Galante. Although it was a hot summer day and they were dining on the patio, both Bonventre and Amato wore leather jackets; presumably to protect themselves from stray bullets and debris. Suddenly, three men in ski masks appeared on the patio and opened fire on Galante. Bonventre and Amato allegedly joined in the attack, then disappeared from the scene after the three hitmen. Galante and his two lunch companions died. A week after the Galante murders, Bonventre was arrested by federal agents, but he was soon released and was never charged with the crime. =Capo= Philip \\"Rusty\\" Rastelli succeeded Galante as boss of the family, even though he was incarcerated at the time and Joseph Massino became underboss. Although some believed Massino was the real power in the family. After Galante's death, Bonventre was promoted from soldier to capo and joined Salvatore Catalano's Brooklyn crew. At 28, Bonventre became the youngest capo in Bonanno family history. Bonventre became involved in the importation and drug trafficking of heroin from Sicily into New York pizza parlors, known as the \\"Pizza Connection\\". Bonventre had been on the side of the three capos' Alphonse \\"Sonny Red\\" Indelicato, Philip Giaccone and Dominick Trinchera; a family faction who were planning a coup to take over the family. However, Bonventre switched sides, joining Rastelli's faction. If Bonventre and the Zips had stayed loyal to Indelicato, he would have probably taken over the Bonanno family. The ascension of Rastelli as boss triggered a period of discontent and rivalry in the Bonanno family. As a result, Rastelli and Massino started purging their opponents in the family. In 1984, Massino decided to eliminate Bonventre. Bonventre's pedigree, increasing wealth and fearsome reputation had made him into a threat to Massino's leadership. Bonventre controlled the Sicilians, the meanest killers in the family. Bonventre himself was prone to outbursts of sadistic violence and was suspected of over 20 murders. Massino warned, \\"He's a very sharp guy. You have to be careful.\\" =Death= In April 1984, Bonanno mobsters Salvatore Vitale and Louis Attanasio picked up Bonventre to bring him to a meeting with Rastelli at a glue factory in Wallington, New Jersey. As Vitale drove the car into the factory, Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head. Surprisingly, Bonventre still struggled; grabbing the steering wheel and trying to crash the car, forcing the two hitmen to fight him off. As Vitale steered into the garage, Bonventre crawled out of the car. Louis Attanasio then killed him on the garage floor with two more shots. Bonventre's body was hacked to pieces and dumped into three 55-gallon glue drums. The killers then moved the drums to the fourth floor offices of a trading company in Garfield, New Jersey. On April 9, 1984, unaware that Bonventre was dead, a federal grand jury indicted him and 12 other men on charges of distributing narcotics through the pizza restaurants‚Äîthe so-called \\"Pizza Connection\\" case. On April 16, 1984, the remains were discovered, in a warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey, stuffed into two 55-gallon glue drums. Bonventre is buried at Saint Charles Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York. Bonventre's widow gave birth to their only son after the murder. =Aftermath= Soon after the murder, a government informant later claimed that one of Bonventre's killers was Bonanno mobster Cosimo Aiello. However, in October 1984, Aiello was shot to death in the parking lot of a Clifton, New Jersey restaurant. In January 2004, nearly 20 years after the Bonventre murder, federal authorities arrested Louis Attanasio, Peter Calabrese and Louis's brother, Robert Attanasio. Now a government witness, Vitale testified against them. On September 20, 2006, after being convicted of murder, Louis Attanasio and Calabrese were sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. Robert Attanasio, who had cleaned up the murder car, received 10 years' imprisonment. References Further reading *Pistone, Joseph D.; & Brandt, Charles (2007).

The Jewish community of Liechtenstein today is a population of 26 people.U.S. Department of State ‚Äì International Religious Freedom Report 2012 ‚Äì Liechtenstein World War II  From 2001 to 2005 an international team of six historians (including Dan Michman and Peter Geiger) investigated the matter for the World Jewish Congress. Their conclusions are following. In its report, the commission concludes that the tiny state did not employ slave workers and no assets belonging to Jewish families were confiscated but the country's refugee policy was ambivalent. About 400 Jewish refugees fled during the Nazi era to find safety in the neutral Alpine principality during World War II, 235 were accepted but 165 were turned back. In addition, the principality allowed 144 Jews to become citizens ‚Äúin return for high fees‚Äù during the Nazi era. Most of those new citizens () never lived in Liechtenstein but chose another country. The fact of being a Liechtensteiner made it easier for them to establish themselves in a Western country. Even though it was sandwiched between neutral Switzerland and Nazi-controlled Austria, Liechtenstein still had some room to maneuver. Liechtenstein accepted mainly rich Jews, who were expected to spend their money in the country or who created jobs by establishing companies in the principality. Like most other Western and overseas countries, Liechtenstein tightened its immigration laws in 1938. Liechtenstein's policy can therefore be compared to that of other countries. The family of Liechtenstein's Prince Franz Josef II bought 3 estates taken from Jews in Austria and Czechoslovakia where rented Jewish inmates from a Nazi SS concentration camp near Vienna worked. No works of art plundered by the Nazis were traced to Liechtenstein collections.

For his service during the Napoleonic Wars, he was made a baron of the French Empire by Napoleon Bonaparte. During the November Uprising he commanded all Polish forces on the left bank of the Vistula River. Born to a lesser szlachta family, Klicki started his military career in 1791, joining the ranks of the National Cavalry. He fought with distinction in the War of the Constitution. A skilled cavalryman, during the Ko≈õciuszko's Uprising of 1794 he became the governor of National Cavalry under Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko. For his valour shown in the battles of Ostro≈Çƒôka and ≈Åasia, he was promoted to the rank of Captain of Cavalry. Soon afterwards he was attached to Gen. Zieli≈Ñski. After the fall of the uprising he was forced to leave the country and settled in Italy. There in 1797 he joined the Polish Legions in Italy and fought under command of Gen. Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski. Klicki took part in the battles of Legnano, Castel Nuovo, Castel Franco and the battle of Naples. During the siege of Mantua in 1799 he was taken prisoner by the Austrians, but was released soon afterwards and returned to his unit. Promoted to the rank of Major, he became a commanding officer of the 5th Battalion. Soon afterwards, in 1800, he left the infantry and was among the first officers to be accepted in the newly formed 1st Uhlans' Regiment of the Legion. During the Napoleonic Wars he fought with distinction in several campaigns. During the war against Prussia he took part in the battles of ≈öwidnica, Glogau and Neisse. On July 1, 1807 he was again promoted, this time to the rank of podpu≈Çkownik (lieutenant colonel). In that rank he joined the Vistulan Legion and became the commander of the cavalry of that unit. With his men he took part in the Peninsular War and fought in the battles of Mallen, Alagon, Epila and Tudela. In the summer of 1808 he fought in the First Siege of Saragossa. Following the Siege of Valencia he was awarded by Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet with a private audience with Napoleon Bonaparte. The Emperor granted him a yearly reward of 2000 francs and a promotion to colonel. Considered a hero, in 1812 Klicki was made a Baron of the Empire. During the French invasion of Russia Klicki returned to front-line service and fought at battles of Smolensk, Vitebsk, Mozhaysk and Maloyaroslavets. During the retreat he was among the most successful commanders of the fleeing armies and managed to save almost all of his 4000 men, including viceroy of Italy Eugene Beauharnais. He found his way to Vilna, which he attempted to defend against the pursuing Russians. However, his attempt failed and Klicki retreated with his units further westwards. He then fought in the Saxon Campaign (at K√∂ppen, Motzern, Dresden, Magdeburg and M√∂chern). On July 22, 1813 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and became the commanding officer of the 32nd Light Cavalry Brigade of the V Cavalry Corps under General √âdouard Jean-Baptiste Milhaud. He led his brigade in the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813. He moved to France and fought in the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube in 1814. However, the abdication of Napoleon stopped his military career in the French forces. He resigned his post and returned to Congress Poland, where he joined the army and became the commanding officer of the 2nd Brigade of Mounted Rifles. In 1817 he was nominated the commanding officer of the entire division, but for unknown reasons the document was handed to him only in 1826. He set up his staff in ≈Åowicz. There he greeted the outbreak of the November Uprising. Together with his division he arrived to Warsaw and subordinated himself to the Provisional Government and General J√≥zef Ch≈Çopicki. Following the latter's resignation, Klicki briefly served as a deputy Commander-in-Chief and since December 18, 1830, was a member of the War Council. As his support for the uprising was weak and his health was failing, in 1831 he resigned his post and was allowed to leave Poland for Bavaria, where he intended to settle. However, on crossing the Austrian border he was arrested and handed over to the Russians, who imprisoned him and resettled to Kostroma. Released in 1836, he spent the rest of his life in sanatoria.

Its western terminus is at Middle Country Road (New York State Route 25 or NY 25) in Village of the Branch, and its eastern terminus is at Montauk Highway (CR 80) in Brookhaven. The route carries five different names along its length: Terry Road, Smithtown Boulevard, Lake Shore Road, Portion Road, and Horseblock Road. Route description CR 16 begins as Terry Road at an intersection with NY 25 in Village of the Branch. From NY 25, the road runs to the south near a former concrete factory. It then crosses NY 347\\\\. Several blocks south of NY 347, CR 16 joins Smithtown Boulevard, while Terry Road continues to run south as a road maintained by the Town of Smithtown, and crosses the Islip town line into Ronkonkoma. A former section of Terry Road exists near NY 25A. It is unknown how this section connected to the present terminus of Terry Road at NY 25 while traversing the surrounding terrain. Of the five roads shared by CR 16, Smithtown Boulevard is the only road completely controlled by Suffolk County. Not only are there no former sections, but there are no sections of the road that branch off as local streets. Smithtown Boulevard goes from Smithtown, through Nesconset where it serves as the hamlet's main street, and eventually terminates in Lake Ronkonkoma east of CR 93 (Rosevale Avenue). At one time, CR 76 (Town Line Road) was proposed to curve north of the Smithtown-Islip town line, and terminate between Old Nichol's Road (not to be confused with CR 97, named Nicolls Road) and Rosevale Avenue. Along the north and east side of Lake Ronkonkoma is a road known as Lake Shore Drive, the northern portion of which consists mostly of CR 16, except between Spectacle Lake Road and Schoolhouse Road, which is maintained by the Town of Smithtown. The east end of this section near Schoolhouse Road has suffered such excessive flooding that it was closed by Suffolk County and turned over to the Parks Department, while the rest of it was sold to a local night club on the lake and transformed into part of the parking lot. East of Schoolhouse Road however, the road crosses the Smithtown-Brookhaven town line and runs high along the bluffs of Lake Ronkonkoma until it reaches Portion Road. CR 16 moves east onto Portion Road while Lake Shore Drive continues south along the lake as a road maintained by the Town of Brookhaven. Portion Road begins at the intersection of Lake Shore Drive. Old Portion Road is a former section of Portion Road located just south of that intersection. Through Lake Ronkonkoma and western Farmingville, CR 16 crawls eastward in a hilly region of Long Island, as it intersects with Ronkonkoma Avenue, Hawkins Avenue, CR 19 (Patchogue-Holbrook Road), and Holbrook Road before reaching an interchange with CR 97 (Nicolls Road), where the road opens up to four lanes. Suffolk County is currently planning to widen the rest of the road to four lanes. This section of CR 16 once carried the additional name of Farm-to-Market Road. For all intents and purposes, Horseblock Road is the main section of CR 16\\\\. Like Portion Road, it once shared the additional name of Farm-to-Market Road. Unlike the rest of CR 16, Horseblock Road's western terminus is at Middle Country Road (NY 25) in Centereach. Originally, Horseblock Road was connected to another street a few blocks west of the current terminus named Mark Tree Road. The two sections formed a single road that ran from South Setauket to South Haven. The connection between the two streets are cut off by a shopping center on the north side of NY 25 between Mark Tree and Eastwood Road. It then traverses to the south-southeast, and is cut off by CR 97 (Nicolls Road), Suffolk County Community College, and other county facilities in Farmingville, and joins up with Portion Road from a frontage road west of Nicolls Road named Leeds Boulevard at the interchange with Nicolls Road. The section east of Nicolls Road resumes at Horseblock Place and then joins Portion Road west of Waverly Avenue. Horseblock Road then travels east-southeast through Farmingville (home of the historic Bald Hill Schoolhouse and Cotten Coverage Insurance Agency), intersecting Blue Point Road, Granny Road, and CR 83 (North Ocean Avenue) and then narrows down to two lanes eventually entering Medford, intersecting NY 112, the Long Island Expressway at exit 65, and CR 101 (Patchogue-Yaphank Road). It then enters southern Yaphank and Brookhaven, where it intersects CR 99 (Woodside Avenue, a road whose construction in the early 1970s lead to Horseblock Road's realignment) and then CR 21 (Yaphank Avenue), where it shares an interchange with Sunrise Highway (NY 27) before terminating at CR 80 (Montauk Highway) in Brookhaven. History The segment between Ronkonkoma and South Haven was built by the Works Progress Administration and gave the Portion Road and Horse Block Road southeast of Portion the dual name of \\"Farm to Market Road,\\" in the hopes of giving farmers of southeastern Long Island an accessible road to western segments of Long Island. Though CR 16 has run consistently from Smithtown to Brookhaven since the mid-1960s, this wasn't always the case. Many segments have been part of other county roads. 70px East Lake Shore Terrace Drive and Portion Road used to be part of CR 19 from the Smithtown-Brookhaven Town Line to Waverly Avenue in Farmingville. In 1960, this terminus was moved to Patchogue-Holbrook Road. 70px The construction of Sunrise Highway in 1957 lead to the realignment of Horseblock Road west of its original eastern terminus with South Country Road (former Montauk Highway) in South Haven. Because the interchange is shared with CR 21, the new alignment was originally designated as CR 21A. 70px Horseblock Road used to be a western extension of CR 56 between Victory Avenue, a frontage road along Sunrise Highway that begins at CR 46, in Brookhaven and Waverly Avenue in Farmingville. In 1964, it was moved only to Victory Avenue. The frontage road was mainly unmarked until the 2010s.

In early June 1809 Cherub and sailed into the anchorage at Basse-Terre to cut out two French frigates lying there under the protection of a fort and some batteries. As they sailed in they were subject to fire from shore batteries, which had no effect. The wind suddenly failed the British vessels, which were nevertheless able to extricate themselves from the situation with no losses or damage, but no success either.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, pp. 397-398. On 18 June and Cherub captured one of the French frigates, . At the time of her capture, F√©licit√© was armed with only 14 guns, but had 174 men on board. She had left Guadeloupe in company with another frigate and was sailing to France with colonial produce. The second frigate escaped through superior sailing despite Cherub having conducted a long chase. captured the second frigate, , on 5 July 1809. Latona and Cherub shared the prize money with the other vessels that had formed the blockade of the Saintes, Amaranthe, Blonde, , , Julia, and . Next, Cherub took part in the invasion of Guadeloupe in early 1810. This time 50 vessels shared in the prize money. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with clasp \\"Guadaloupe\\" to all surviving claimants from the campaign. On 1 August 1811 Tucker received promotion to post captain.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, pp. 419-429. Cherub was reclassed as a sixth rate to permit him to continue in command. Cherub remained on the Leeward Islands station until 3 July 1812, when she returned to England for a refit. On this voyage she convoyed some 70 to 80 vessels,Lloyd's Marine List, - accessed 26 November 2013. or 96. Cherub arrived in September and the crew received one month's leave; apparently all returned to duty, even though they had been away from Britain for some years and expected to sail again for more years abroad. A newspaper report dated 9 October from Halifax reported that Prince of Asturias, from St Mary's, Straker, master, which Cherub had recaptured, had arrived there. The account did not specify either the date of recapture nor arrival.Lloyd's Marine List, - accessed 26 November 2013. On 19 December 1812 Cherub left Cork with a convoy of 12 vessels, eight for Brazil, two for Buenos Aires, and one for the South Seas. Several separated and on 12 January captured Volunteer and the next day another vessel from the convoy.McCranie (2011), p. 107. Still, on 24 January 1813 Cherub still had seven vessels with her.Lloyd's Marine List, - accessed 25 November 2013. Cherub sailed from Rio de Janeiro on 8 July in company with and , sailing around Cape Horn.Lloyd's Marine List, - accessed 25 November 2013. The Royal Navy had been under pressure from the Montreal‚Äìbased North West Company, who were agitating for them to capture the base of their rival, the Pacific Fur Company. At the Galapagos Islands, Racoon continued on to attack American fur traders at Fort Astoria on the Columbia River, while Phoebe and Cherub remained to search for the frigate , which had been attacking the British whaling fleet in the Pacific. =Capture of Essex= On 8 February 1814, Phoebe and Cherub found Essex at Valparaiso. They waited off the port for Essex to come out. On the afternoon of 28 March, Essex sailed but she lost her main topmast and anchored near the shore. Phoebe and Cherub also anchored and opened fire. The British were armed with long guns, which were more effective at a longer range than the American armament of carronades. As the British anchored out of effective range of the American carronades, the battle was very one-sided and lasted for an hour until Captain David Porter of Essex struck his colours with 23 dead and 42 wounded on board. On the British ships only five were killed. Phoebe and Cherub also captured Essexs tender, , which they then used as a cartel to transport their prisoners to New York. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasps \\"Cherub 28 March 1814\\" and \\"Phoebe 28 March 1814\\" to all surviving claimants from the battle. On 31 May Phoebe and Essex set sail for England, finally anchoring in Plymouth sound on 13 November. The Admiralty repaired Essex, taking her into service as HMS Essex. In mid-April Cherub was at Valparaiso taking on supplies. She was planning to sail to the Marquesas Islands in search of the whalers that Essex had captured.Lloyd's Marine List, 22 July 1814 On 12 June, near the Sandwich Islands, Cherub recaptured (or Sir Andrew Hamond); five days later she captured Charon. Sir Andrew Hamond was a whaler that Porter had captured and left at Nuka Hiva, together with other captured whalers, including Greenwich and the former British letter-of-marque whaler, USS Seringapatam, the whole being under the command of Lieutenant John M. Gamble USMC. When Gamble made preparations to leave the island, many of his party mutinied. Gamble and seven men (four unfit for duty) escaped and sailed Sir Andrew Hammond 2500 miles before they had the misfortune to meet up with Cherub.Mooney (1976), Vol. 6, p. 517. On 15 January 1815 Cherub and Racoon left Rio de Janeiro, escorting a convoy that included the storeships and , and seven merchantmen, including Sir Andrew Hammond.Lloyd's Marine List - accessed 26 November 2013. They left Pernambuco on 6 March,[ https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735027?urlappend=%3Bseq=81 Lloyd's Marine List ‚Ññ5968.] and Cherub arrived at Portsmouth on 5 May.Lloyd's Marine List, - accessed 26 November 2013. Post-war Cherub was fitted for sea at Portsmouth between August and October 1816. Captain William Fisher commissioned her in August for the West Africa Squadron. On 17 January 1817, Cherub captured the Spanish slave ship Esperanza. On 5 March, captured the slave ship Temerario; Cherub shared the prize money for Temerario with Bann. In May 1817 Cherub was at Cape Coast Castle, having come from London via Jamaica.Lloyd's Marine List, #5177 - accessed 2 December 2013. In July she was back at Jamaica from Africa.Lloyd's Marine List, #5177 - accessed 2 December 2013. She arrived back at Plymouth on 11 October.Lloyd's Marine List, - accessed 2 December 2013. In October 1817 she was recommissioned under Captain George Wicken Willes, who was appointed to her 3 October 1817 while she was fitting for Africa.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, pp. 349-353. On 15 May 1818, Cherub captured the Spanish slaver Josefa (or Joseffa, or Josepha), Buenaventura Llarena, master, off Cape Appollonia. She had purchased 45 slaves, of whom some 35 were aboard, ten having been taken off shortly before Cherub captured her. Cherub sent her to Jamaica, then Havana, and finally back to Freetown, Sierra Leone, arriving 26 November. There Josefa, which was in a leaky state, sank on 24 May 1819. She sank long after the 28 surviving slaves had been brought ashore.British and Foreign State Papers. (1830), p. 54. (H.M. Stationery Office). Although the vessel was clearly engaged in the illegal slave trade, she sank before the court condemned her. Willes had acted without having received instructions under the Treaty with Spain for the Suppression of Slave Trade and the seizure was not made under the Slave Trade Convention.British and Foreign State Papers (1846), p. 87. (H.M. Stationery Office). The owner(s) sued Willes for the loss of their vessel and her cargo, winning a judgement of ¬£21,180, which ruined Willes.Rees (2011), p. 63. An accounting of the costs and revenues of the colony at Sierra Leone shows ¬£6740 14s 6d in income from \\"Captain Willis of H.M.S. Cherub\\" for an illegal capture.Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, Vol. 23, 1828, p. 87. Cherub was back in Portsmouth on 5 October 1818, having sailed from Jamaica on 5 August and Havana on 15 September.Lloyd's Marine List, - accessed 2 December 2013.

Banks, telephone service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business metrics (along with cash flow, EBITDA, etc.) because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.Zero Defections: Quality comes to service., Reichheld & Sasser. Harvard Business review. 1990. Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients. Companies usually make a distinction between voluntary churn and involuntary churn. Voluntary churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided. When companies are measuring their customer turnover, they typically make the distinction between gross attrition and net attrition. Gross attrition is the loss of existing customers and their associated recurring revenue for contracted goods or services during a particular period. Net attrition is gross attrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original location. Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a weighted calculation, called Monthly Recurring Revenue (or MRR). In the 2000s, there are also a number of business intelligence software programs which can mine databases of customer information and analyze the factors that are associated with customer attrition, such as dissatisfaction with service or technical support, billing disputes, or a disagreement over company policies. More sophisticated predictive analytics software use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn. Retail services applications Financial services such as banking and insurance use applications of predictive analytics for churn modeling, because customer retention is an essential part of most financial services' business models. Other sectors have also discovered the power of predictive analytics, including retailing, telecommunications and pay-TV operators. One of the main objectives of modeling customer churn is to determine the causal factors, so that the company can try to prevent the attrition from happening in the future. Some companies want to prevent their good customers from deteriorating (e.g., by falling behind in their payments) and becoming less profitable customers, so they introduced the notion of partial customer churn. Customer attrition merits special attention by mobile telecom service providers worldwide. This is due to the low barriers to switching to a competing service provider especially with the advent of Mobile Number Portability (MNP) in several countries. This allows customers to switch to another provider while preserving their phone numbers. While mature markets with high teledensity (phone market penetration) have churn rates ranging from 1% to 2% per month, high growth developing markets such as India and China are experiencing churn rates between 3% to 4% per month. By deploying new technologies such churn prediction models coupled with effective retention programs, customer attrition could be better managed to stem the significant revenue loss from defecting customers. Customer attrition is a major concern for US and Canadian banks, because they have much higher churn rates than banks in Western Europe. US and Canadian banks with the lowest churn rates have achieved customer turnover rates as low as 12% per year, by using tactics such as free checking accounts, online banking and bill payment, and improved customer service. However, once banks can improve their churn rates by improving customer service, they can reach a point beyond which further customer service will not improve retention; other tactics or approaches need to be explored. Churn or Customer attrition is often used as an indicator of customer satisfaction. However the churn rate can be kept artificially low by making it difficult for the customers to resiliate their services. This can include ignoring resiliations requests, implementing lengthy and complicated resiliation procedures to follow through by an average consumer and various other barriers to resiliation. Thus, churn can improve while customer satisfaction deteriorates. This practice is short sighted and will backfire. However, it was shown to be common in telephone companies and among internet providers. Research Scholars have studied customer attrition at European financial services companies, and investigated the predictors of churn and how the use of customer relationship management (CRM) approaches can impact churn rates. Several studies combine several different types of predictors to develop a churn model. This model can take demographic characteristics, environmental changes, and other factors into account. Research on customer attrition data modeling may provide businesses with several tools for enhancing customer retention. Using data mining and software, one may apply statistical methods to develop nonlinear attrition causation models. One researcher notes that \\"...retaining existing customers is more profitable than acquiring new customers due primarily to savings on acquisition costs, the higher volume of service consumption, and customer referrals.\\" The argument is that to build an \\"...effective customer retention program,\\" managers have to come to an understanding of \\"...why customers leave\\" and \\"...identify the customers with high risk of leaving\\" by accurately predicting customer attrition.Applying and evaluating models to predict customer attrition using data mining techniques, Tom Au, et al. Journal of Comparative International Management. 1 June 2003 Prediction In the business context, \\"churn\\" refers both to customers' migration and to their loss of value. So, \\"churn rate\\" refers, on the one hand, to the percentage of customers who end their relation with the organization, or, on the other hand, to the customers who still receive their services, but not as much or not as often as they used to. Current organizations face therefore a huge challenge: to be able to anticipate to customers‚Äô abandon in order to retain them on time, reducing this way costs and risks and gaining efficiency and competitivity. There are in the market advanced analytics tools and applications, especially designed to analyze in depth the enormous amount of data inside the organizations, and to make predictions based on the information obtained from analyzing and exploring those data. They aim to put at the service of marketing departments and agencies ‚Äìand of all business users- the necessary weapons to: * Detect soon which customers are about to abandon and to know them in depth, answering to questions such as: Who are they? or How do they behave? * Know the real value of the potential loss of those customers, with the aim of establishing priorities and distributing business efforts and resources efficiently, optimizing resources and maximizing the value of the current customers‚Äô portfolio. * Put into practice personalized retention plans in order to reduce or avoid their migration, increasing the capability to react and anticipating to possible non-predicted fugues. Reduction There are organizations that have developed international standards regarding recognition and sharing of global best practice in customer service in order to reduce customer attrition. The International Customer Service Institute has developed The International Customer Service Standard to strategically align organizations so they focus on delivering excellence in customer service, whilst at the same time providing recognition of success through a 3rd Party registration scheme. Management Not all customer attrition is bad. For many firms, it is useful and desirable that unprofitable customers should churn away. This is known as customer divestment of unprofitable customers.Ka‚Äêshing Woo, Henry K.Y. Fock, (2004) Retaining and divesting customers: an exploratory study of right customers, ‚Äúat‚Äêrisk‚Äù right customers, and wrong customers. Journal of Services Marketing, 18, 187-197. However, simply because a customer is unprofitable does not mean that the customer should be divested, because there are strategic reasons for retaining unprofitable customers.

Although many sources claim the existence of other band members, these may be fictional characters (probably created by Warjomaa himself) and include a French count born in the 17th century (Count of Saint-Germain), a cartoon character with a T-shirt with Aarni's logo (Doomintroll) and an old woman (Mistress Palm). Aarni's music bears similarities to funeral doom metal (in Reaching Azathoth, for example) and has sometimes similarities to folk metal (The Weird of Vipunen). Their style has been described as almost orthodox doom metallish Lovecraftian-Jungian Kalevala avantgarde music. The band themselves sometimes use the term Chthonic Musick. The lyrics of Aarni include varied themes such as Finnish folklore, transhumanism, Lovecraft, paganism, parapsychology, psychoanalytical theories and mythology. The lyrics have been sung in English, Finnish, Latin, and occasionally in Enochian, Ancient Egyptian, Ouranian Barbaric, Swedish, and Glossolalic.  History  Aarni was founded in 1998, in Finland, by Master Warjomaa (occasionally known as Mahatma M. Warjomaa). Master Warjomaa is also an active member of a doom metal band called Umbra Nihil, playing lead guitar. Aarni released a demo in 2001, and a split album with Umbra Nihil the following year. After a second demo in 2002, Aarni finally released its first full-length album, Bathos, in 2004. Aarni was signed to Firebox Records's subsidiary label Firedoom Music, but is now signed to Epidemie Records. Aarni released their second album, called Tohcoth, in February 2008. In late 2008 Aarni also released a CDR EP titled Omnimantia. In April 2012 Aarni released a split album with Persistence in Mourning.News section of the Official Online Dwelling  Controversy  = Band members = On Aarni's official website, the band section contains four members (also referred to as \\"Responsible Cultists\\"), as well as information concerning each of them. The four members of the band are Master Warjomaa, Comte de Saint-Germain, Doomintroll and Mistress Palm. Warjomaa commented on this in a 2004 interview: > The number of Aarni is five and five is the number of Aarni. Think a while > about this and you will see... because Aarni consists of four personalities > plus me. Why four? Because I've chosen to adhere to the (Jungian) concept of > quaternity - four personality types, four seasons, four equinoxes, four > elements, four stations of the sun, four stages of the human life, four > cardinal directions, four Qabbalistic worlds, four limbs of the human body, > four main themes in Aarni's songs, four basic human brain circuits of > Timothy Leary's theory etc. Visualize the pentagram representing human > existence: there's four points combined in/ruled by the fifth. It's all of > course symbolic. Or is it?  Master Warjomaa  Master Warjomaa is the alias of the band's most stable member. According to the band's official website, Warjomaa was born in 1974.Master Warjomaa's profile on the Official Online Dwelling It is stated that he is influenced by Joe Satriani, Taoism, Camel, and H. P. Lovecraft, that he belongs to the Homo Superior species, and that his favorite place is Cydonia. Along with many other artists, Warjomaa has named Black Sabbath, Candlemass, Hawkwind, King Crimson and Van der Graaf Generator as his musical influences. In a fan interview in June 2006, Warjomaa stated: > \\"While I prefer a female unicorn deity to a gaseous alpha male vertebrate of > cosmic heft anytime, I'd rather choose no deity or deities at all. I think > it's high time we stopped worshiping gods and started to aim at becoming > gods.\\"  Comte de Saint Germain  Le Comte de Saint Germain (translated from French: \\"The Count of Saint Germain\\") is one of the members of Aarni. His role in the band has been stated as \\"Sensation, alchemical processes and keys to secrets\\". It is written that he was born in 1665 and is an \\"ex-human\\". It is not stated whether le Comte de Saint Germain was an actual individual that lived centuries ago or if he is an entirely fictional character. It may be possible that le Comte de Saint Germain has something to do with the Count of St Germain, an actual count living in the 18th century.  Doomintroll & Mistress Palm  Doomintroll has been represented by a cartoon-style drawing of a person with a very prominent nose, a pipe in the mouth, the Aarni logo on the T-shirt, and a hand sticking up the middle finger. According to Aarni he \\"originated\\" in 1998,Doomintroll's profile on the Official Online Dwelling (also the date of the formation of Aarni) which would make him 6 years old at the time of the release of the band's first full-length album. It is written that Doomintroll belongs to the \\"Duumipeikko\\" species. \\"Duumipeikko\\", roughly translated from Finnish, gives \\"Doomintroll\\". This is a reference to the popular Finnish cartoon series, Moomin, in which Muumipeikko is one of the main characters. According to Doomintroll, the band wants to support the anarcho-shamanistic attitude of moomintrolls. Mistress Palm (also referred to as Mrs. Palm) is the fourth claimed band member. She is depicted as a rather elderly woman in an apron holding a dish brush and opening her mouth in dismay. She has been thought to be a computer program or artificial, phlogiston-driven rectoplasm. = Website = At the top of the band page is written \\"4=1\\".Band section on the Official Online Dwelling The motive of this equation is maybe to consider the situation of the 4 declared members and one actual member and/or can be a reference to the Jungian concept of quaternity. On the news page (also referred to as the \\"Unspeakable Tidings\\"), the news are listed chronologically. However the dates are said to be written in the form corresponding to these in the Discordian calendar. These dates follow the \\"DD/SS/YYYY\\" form, as stated on the official website.News section of the Official Online Dwelling Therefore, e.g. the year 2007 CE is noted as 3173 AM. = Lyrics = The lyrics have been sung in English, Finnish, Latin, and occasionally in French, Ancient Egyptian, Glossolalic, Swedish, Ouranian Barbaric and Enochian.Information on Aarni on the Official Online Dwelling In several songs, the lyrics refer to the Cthulhu Mythos. In \\"Squaring The Circle\\", the lyrics say \\"zero equals two\\". This may be a reference to the ideas of Aleister Crowley and similar to the \\"4=1\\" statement on top of the band page of the official website. In \\"The Thunder, Perfect Mindfuck\\", it is said \\"I am the shameless and I am ashamed\\" as well as \\"I am falsehood and I am truth\\".

It is the first regional natural gas transmission system in sub-Saharan Africa. History The project began in 1982, when the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) proposed the development of a natural gas pipeline throughout West Africa. In 1991 a feasibility report conducted by the World Bank on supplying Nigerian gas on West African markets deemed that a project was commercially viable. In September 1995, the governments of four African countries signed a Heads of State Agreement. The feasibility study was carried out in 1999. On 11 August 1999, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by participating countries in Cotonou, Benin. In February 2000, an Inter-Governmental Agreement was signed. The WAGP implementation agreement was signed in 2003. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the project were held at Sekondi-Takoradi, Ghana, on 3 December 2004. Construction began in 2005. The offshore pipeline was completed in December 2006 and was scheduled to start operating on 23 December 2007 but was delayed after leaks were detected in supply pipelines in Nigeria. The second delivery deadline was scheduled on 13 February 2008, but regular deliveries were delayed again, when one of the contractors of Willbros was shot and killed in Nigeria by armed robbers. Gas deliveries were expected by the end of 2009 after commissioning regulating and metering stations in Takoradi and Tema, Ghana, Lagos Beach, Nigeria, Cotonou, Benin, and Lom√©, Togo in May 2008. However, deliveries were postponed again due to an irregular amount of moisture found inside the onshore gas pipeline. Route The pipeline consists of three sections with a total length of . The long offshore section starts at the Itoki terminal in southeastern Nigeria and runs through the waters of Benin, Togo and Ghana parallel to the coastline, approximately to offshore in water depths of between and . The Nigerian onshore section of the pipeline connects the offshore section compressor station at Lagos Beach with the Chevron-owned Escravos‚ÄìLagos Pipeline System, operational since 1989. It is possible that later the WAGP will be extended to C√¥te d'Ivoire and in longer term even to Senegal. Technical description The diameter of the onshore section is . The diameter of the offshore pipeline is and the capacity is 5 billion cubic meter (bcm) of natural gas per year. The pipeline was constructed by Willbros, with Bredero Shaw Ltd applying a concrete coating to the pipeline at its facility in Tema, Ghana. The pre- commissioning services were provided by BJ Process and Pipeline Services. The total pipeline costs around US$974 million, for which the World Bank provided a guarantee of $50 million for Ghana, while the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency provided a $75 million political risk guarantee for WAGPo as a whole. Project company The pipeline is owned by West African Gas Pipeline Company Limited (WAGPCo), a consortium of Chevron (36.7%), Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (25%), Royal Dutch Shell (18%), Volta River Authority of Ghana (16.3%), Soci√©t√© Togolaise de Gaz (SoToGaz - 2%) and Soci√©t√© Beninoise de Gaz S.A. (SoBeGaz - 2%). The managing director of the company is Walter Perez. It is operated by Chevron Corporation. Consumers In Ghana, provided gas was intended for the Takoradi Power Station at Aboadze near Takoradi, operated by Volta River Authority and the Takoradi International Company's (TICO). As of 2014, however, most of the gas was being consumed in Lagos. Controversy Environmental group Friends of the Earth has criticized the project, after local communities in Nigeria complained it would damage land, destroy livelihoods and pollute fishing areas. Damage by Pirates On August 27, 2012, the West African Gas Pipeline was damaged when pirates who had tried to board an oil tanker in an attempt to get away from the pursuing Togolese Navy, severely damaged the pipeline with their anchor. For nearly a year, the supply of gas to Ghana, Togo and Benin ceased, causing major power supply problems to the affected countries.https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234529/http://www.gasol.co.uk/media/16771/gasol_has_a_powerful_ally.pdf References External links * WAGPCo website * West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) Project, Energy Information Administration, March 2003 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2006 Category:Natural gas pipelines in Nigeria Category:Natural gas pipelines in Benin Category:Natural gas pipelines in Togo Category:Natural gas pipelines in Ghana Category:Benin‚ÄìNigeria relations Category:Benin‚ÄìTogo relations Category:Ghana‚ÄìNigeria relations Category:Ghana‚ÄìTogo relations ","title":"West African Gas Pipeline"},{"id":"7744446","text":"The Londoner was a newsletter in the style of a newspaper published by the Mayor of London, and delivered free to most households in Greater London, United Kingdom.

Information The Cole Cold line was launched in 1981 to replace the company's traditional Red Spot brand. In 18 months following the launch, S. M. Jaleel's market share grew from 1% to 30%. In some areas of the Caribbean, the company S.M. Jaleel is actually called Cole Cold rather than the brand name. This proves the close association that this brand has with the consumers. It is mainly known for its 2L and 20oz packages. It is the leading flavored carbonated soft drink beverage in Trinidad. The brand has been successful in the market since the early 1980s. Pear D is one of the Cole cold flavors that is known to be the premium beverage and today it still continues to be one of the most popular flavors. Pear D is also now available in cans. The name Jaliter had been given to the brand because it is a combination of the company name and the name of a one- litre package. Since that name had been given to it, the 2L package had also inherited this name as well as the other competitor 2L package. References External links * Cole Cold on the S. M.

The label was introduced to the public in March 1948. The label was owned by the Synthetic Plastics Company of Newark, New Jersey until the 1970s. The label became one of the largest and most successful children's specialty record labels in America, manufacturing releases that often contrasted with those of their competitors (Wonderland Records, Kid Stuff Records, and Mr. Pickwick). Peter Pan enjoyed their greatest success as a children's label during the 1950s. Many of their most famous releases were issued on 78-RPM 7 and 10-inch records and on 45-RPM 7-inch records. Both songs (such as a cover version of \\"Frosty the Snowman\\") and stories (such as a heavily abridged version of Peter and the Wolf, with Victor Jory narrating) were released. Releases credited a variety of performers, including Dick Edwards with the Peter Pan Chorus and Orchestra,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT9AcAT6_Aw the Caroleer Singers,http://www.peterpanmusic.net/ the Peter Pan Players and variations on these titles. The label was notable for its series of book-and-record sets, combining an illustrated storybook with a vinyl record that contained music and narration by \\"your Peter Pan Storyteller\\" (who would prompt the listener to \\"turn the page\\" at the sound of a bell). Bugs Bunny, Popeye the Sailor Man, The Flintstones, Bozo the Clown, Scooby-Doo and Casper the Friendly Ghost were among the characters featured in these sets. One of its most successful releases was Santa Claus is Coming to Town, an original production by Peter Pan's studio collective (known as the Peppermint Kandy Kids), that featured remakes of classic Christmas holiday songs, original songs for the album, and portrayals of Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus. Also notable was the company's run of Irwin the Disco Duck albums, which featured popular songs of their time (1976 to 1980) and were aimed at children, with the title character acting as a DJ. Peter Pan Records was spun off into its own entity, Peter Pan Industries, from the 1970s to 2000. In the early 1990s, while keeping its primary asset alive (even though the children's label market had declined), Peter Pan Industries branched into music releases not aimed at the children's market. The company changed its name to PPI Entertainment of Newark, New Jersey, and established new label divisions and imprints, including Rohit International Records, a budget label from the 1990s that specialized in reggae. In 2006, PPI Entertainment Group changed its name yet again to Inspired Studios from West Palm Beach, Florida. Power Records Power Records was a related label, featuring characters licensed from DC Comics and Marvel Comics, and contemporary movies and television series (such as Kojak, Planet of the Apes, The Six Million Dollar Man, Space: 1999, and Star Trek), in stories geared toward older children. The book-and-record sets frequently featured original 20-page comic books along with an extended-play 7\\" record of the story. Playing the record while reading along in the book brought the story to life through music and sound effects. There were also other 7\\" single releases. Besides book-and-record sets, LPs were produced, featuring the recorded stories without illustrations.

It was built in two sections over a span of twenty years, beginning in 1818. The lower section spanned the distance between Easton, Pennsylvania and the town of Mauch Chunk, present-day Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania.https://www.nps.gov/Nr/travel/delaware/leh.htm In Easton the canal met the Delaware and Morris Canals, with which goods could be brought further up the east coast. At its height, the Lehigh Canal was long. Although the canal was used to transport a variety of products, its most significant cargoes were anthracite coal and pig iron. Cornerstones of the American Industrial Revolution, they defined the character of the towns surrounding the canal. The route consisted of the canals and dammed-off sections of the Lehigh River. Boatmen had to navigate their barges periodically from the canal through a lock onto the river or vice versa. This design saved time and money while the canal was being built, although it made for a slower, more difficult trip for canal-boat captains. History =Early history= The Lehigh Coal Mine Company (LCMC) was founded in 1792, a few months after anthracite was discovered at Sharpe Mountain (a peak of the Pisgah Ridge near present-day Summit Hill, Pennsylvania); Its principals secured rights to over before the Lehigh Canal was built. The company found it fairly easy to find and mine coal from a pit on the mountainside, the coal had to be loaded into sacks and then onto pack animals which carried the coal at least to the Lehigh shore. Disposable skiffs known as arks were built from local timber, which were manned along the lower Lehigh River rapids. Despite many politically connected stockholders and officers, the operation was unsupervised by upper management.Brenckman, Fredrick, History of Carbon County. Also, History of Northampton County overlaps. With no officer willing to manage from the field, the LCMC hired contractors or sent out teams; this was only sporadically successful in getting coal to Philadelphia. Firewood and charcoal were expensive and hard to find in the eastern U.S. by the War of 1812. Before the war, the LCMC's record of getting coal to market was so dismal that coal imported from England was cheaper and more readily available. The war gave the company an incentive to send another expedition by independent contractors in 1813. After a year they had built five boats, but brought only two to market; this resulted in another loss for the company. The loss was the last straw for many of the company's backers, who were unwilling to fund more expeditions despite the two boats bought back by White and Hazard. The Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, its founder Josiah White and White's protege and partner Erskine Hazard (operations managers into the mid-1860s) established a reputation for innovation. White and Hazard researched (or invented) emerging technologies as needed, pioneering industrial innovations including the first wire suspension bridge over the Schuylkill River. =Background= February 1873 Harper's Weekly engraving of coal loading at the Mauch Chunk loading chutes. The Hauto Tunnel was in operation, and the LC&N; Co. allowed its subsidiary Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad to be sold as a tourist railroad. As the Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway, it was the world's first roller coaster. The lower canal began as a collection of removed stone obstructions and low rock dams with a system of wooden \\"bear-trap locks\\" invented by Lehigh Navigation Company managing partner Josiah White, who debugged scale models of the lock design on Mauch Chunk Creek. Experiments with the bear-trap locks gave Bear Lane, an alley in Mauch Chunk off Broadway in today's Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, its name. White and partner Erskine Hazard, who operated a wire mill, foundry and nail factory at the Falls of the Schuylkill, needed energy. After learning the value of anthracite during the British blockades in 1814, White and Hazard joined a number of Philadelphians in a joint-stock venture to build the Schuylkill Canal but quarreled with those on the board of managers who did not favor rapid development. They learned that the managers of the Lehigh Coal Mine Company were willing to option their rights because of their long-term inability to make a profit by transporting anthracite nearly from Pisgah Ridge. The Lehigh Navigation Company held a charter to improve the navigability of the Lehigh River, but had accomplished little and the charter would expire in 1817. White and Hazard made a proposal specifying improvements for downriver navigation only, and received a charter giving the company ownership of the river in March 1818. The charter had a fall-back provision allowing the legislature to require improvements enabling two-way navigation. =Lower canal= Sometimes called \\"The Stone Coal Turnpike\\", the lower canal () was built by the Lehigh Navigation Company as a \\"toll road\\" to supply coal to Eastern seaboard cities between 1818 and 1820 (downriver traffic only). It was rebuilt (with locks supporting two-way traffic) between 1827 and 1829 by the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, and remained in operation until 1931. The lower canal connected the eastern part of the southern Coal Region to the Delaware River basin (primarily the Panther Creek Valley, Nesquehoning Creek Valley and mines in Beaver Meadows and along Black Creek), connecting via Penn Haven Junction to the canal head at Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania). The lower canal began below Packers Dam. A wing wall projected into the upper pool to create slack water next to the loading docks, at the same level as the top of the first guard dam. That dam (known as Dam 1) was downstream of Broadway, opposite Flagstaff Hill and the cross-canal Bear Mountain for which Mauch Chunk was named. The 44 lift locks begin with Lock 1 at the dam. This was a weighing lock, using a platform which lifted a barge and weighed the boat and its load. Each non-LC&NC; barge on the canal was recorded. Empty weights were subtracted, and tolls were assessed by the ton per mile traveled. Most of the 44 locks on the descent to Easton, PA were spillway variants of White's bear- trap lock. When tipped or triggered, they released several acre-feet (creating a wave to raise the water level as the canal boat sank downriver). The canal carried central Lehigh Valley anthracite to northeastern urban markets, particularly Philadelphia, Trenton and Wilmington, and supporting new industry in Bristol, Allentown and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania with the Morris and Delaware and Raritan Canals and a number of railroads. The privately funded canal became part of the Pennsylvania Canal system, a complex of canals, towpaths and (eventually) railroads. It was last used for cargo in 1942, and the LC&N; Company was sold to Pennsylvania for preservation and recreational use in 1964. Portions of the canal and the later rail lines flanking it are part of the Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor, a multi-use rail trail. Initial construction The lower canal improvements were initially designed and engineered by LC&N; founder Josiah White after the company become disenchanted with the Schuylkill Canal's board of directors. By the winter of 1814, the company was interested in transporting Lehigh Valley coal to Philadelphia. By late 1822, skepticism about anthracite was waning. The cost of building an ark for every load of coal delivered to the Philadelphia docks in 1822 (as LC&N; operations were hitting their stride) worried the company's board of directors. By mid-1822, managing director Josiah White was consulting with veteran Erie-Canal lock engineer Canvass White. By late in the year, White had shifted construction efforts from improving the one-way system (begun in 1818) to a test project on the four upper dams of the canal. The project involved two-way dams and locks with a wider lift channel and lengths of over , capable of taking a steam tug and a coastal cargo ship from from the Delaware to the slack-water pool at Mauch Chunk. In 1823, White and Hazard proposed a plan to the Pennsylvania legislature. Further construction In 1823, after building and testing four locks, Josiah White made a proposal to the Pennsylvania legislature to continue the improvements down the Lehigh River. His plan included locks suitable for a coastal schooner and towing steam tug, the types of boats which dominated ports along the of the Delaware River controlled by the LC&N.; The following year, the legislature rejected his proposal; lumber and timber interests feared that damming would prevent them from rafting logs on the rivers to local sawmills. White and Hazard scrambled to increase mine production while producing enough lumber for arks to send their coal along the Delaware to Philadelphia. In 1827, a revision to the Main Line of Public Works funded the promised Delaware Canal. The LC&N; began converting the canal to support two-way operation, work which continued into 1829. In 1831, the LC&N; stopped making one-way arks and began building large, durable barges, expecting their return via a connection with the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal in Easton. The expanded Lehigh Canal extended , between Mauch Chunk and Easton. Its 52 locks, eight guard locks, eight dams and six aqueducts allowed the waterway to rise over in elevation. A weigh lock south of Mauch Chunk determined canal-boat fees. A cable-ferry connection across the Delaware River to the Morris Canal and through New Jersey created a more-direct route from the Lehigh Canal to New York City. To the south, the Delaware and Raritan Canal had a complementary canal built along the east bank of the Delaware. =Upper canal= Inspired by the successful transport of freight over the Allegheny Front escarpment via the Allegheny Portage Railroad system, during the mid-1830s the business community and the legislature sought a extension. The Upper Lehigh Canal, designed by Canvass White, was built from 1837 to 1843 as authorized by the 1837 revision of the Main Line of Public Works. The upper Lehigh was a turbulent river with steep sides; a large portion was in a ravine, the Lehigh Gorge. The upper canal rose over in elevation to the Mauch Chunk slack-water pool. Unlike the lower canal (where most locks lifted less than in easy stages, the upper-canal design relied on deep-lift locks. The maximum lift on the lower canal was less than , but the upper-canal locks lifted a maximum of ; this is comparable to the lift of the lower canal in a bit over half the distance, using less than as many locks per mile. The upper canal design's 20 dams, 29 locks and a number of reservoirs provided working flow even in dry summers. The project included four major construction hurdles and three new railroad projects, for which LC&N; created a new subsidiary: the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (LH&S;). From north to south, the rail projects were: # The rail connection from the Pennsylvania Canal landing docks at Pittston to an assembly rail yard in Ashley # The Ashley Planes incline plane railway to Solomon Gap (below Penobscot Knob) and through a cutting, a man-made ravine over deep connecting to an assembly rail yard in Mountain Top # A marshaling yard in Mountain Top with a railroad running down a ridge to White Haven and the new upper-canal docks, with a turnaround staging yard at the docks. In 1855, as competition increased, the canal reached its peak of more than one million tons of cargo. After that, coal mined in the Schuylkill Valley supplanted coal supplied by the Lehigh Canal. =Collapse= The canal's collapse began when a wet spring in 1862 repeatedly overfilled embankment dam reservoirs until the dam above White Haven failed, triggering a cascade of failing dams in a flood on June 4. Between 100 or 200 lives were lost in the villages and canal works below, the number varying by source. The Pennsylvania legislature forbade the rebuilding of the upper canal. The canal was used for transportation until the 1940s (about a decade after similar canals ceased operations), and it was North America's last fully functioning towpath canal. In 1962, most of it was sold to private and public organizations for recreational use. =Modern history= Several segments of the canal were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, including \\"Lehigh Canal\\", \\"Carbon County Section of the Lehigh Canal\\" (#79002179), \\"Lehigh Canal: Eastern Section Glendon and Abbott Street Industrial Sites\\" (#78002437) and \\"Lehigh Canal; Allentown to Hopeville Section\\" (#79002307). For the Carbon County section, also known as \\"Upper Canal Lock #1 to Lower Canal Dam #3\\", the listing included 30 contributing structures. The eastern section (now preserved as a recreational-boating area) runs along the Lehigh River from Hopeville to the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers in Easton and includes the Chain Bridge, which was NRHP-listed in 1974. The eastern-section listing is for a area with three contributing buildings, seven contributing sites and 11 contributing structures. The Allentown-to-Hopeville section is a area which includes Greek Revival and Federal architecture in its contributing building and 13 contributing structures. Present activities An 8-mile (13-km) segment of the canal towpath has been converted into a multi-use trail from Freemansburg through Bethlehem to Allentown. The trail runs along the river and active railroad tracks. A section near Jim Thorpe is also accessible to recreational users. The final section in Easton is maintained and operated by the National Canal Museum. Other short sections are accessible, but portions of the canal towpath are worn and unsafe to access.

In 1897, the Government set aside land for subdivision here, and in 1903 lots were surveyed and the town of Buchanan gazetted. The land agent at Katanning reported considerable interest, and a hall, school and other facilities had been completed by 1904. However, the name clashed with a town in New South Wales (now little more than a historic gallery outside Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Region), so the town was renamed Barton in 1905 to honour Australia's first prime minister (1901‚Äì1903), Sir Edmund Barton.

Commercial success One year later, she received her first songwriting credit for Terri Gibbs, who had recently received the CMA's Horizon Award. From that sprang a continuing career of over 200 songwriting credits including genres of country, bluegrass, Americana, AAA, pop, and blues. In 1999, McLean received a Dove Award for Country Gospel song of the year for \\"Count Your Blessing\\" which was recorded by The Martins. Other artists who've recorded Kim McLean songs include Tim McGraw, The Happy Goodmans, Trisha Yearwood, Jennifer Hanson, Lee Ann Womack, Billy Gilman, Sierra, and more. Since her first publishing deal with Little Big Town, she has also written for EMI, Centergy, King Lizard, New Haven, Worley World, Skyline, and Sony-Tree. Her own publishing company, Kim McLean Music houses most of her Gospel copyrights. Her songs have been used on several major network TV shows including JAG, Early Edition, As the World Turns, The West Wing, and Hope & Faith, which also included a cameo appearance by McLean. Rick Schroder used \\"All We Ever Find\\", a McLean composition recorded by Tim McGraw, for the feature film Black Cloud, about a Native American boxer who made the Olympic boxing team. In 2001, McLean returned to her maiden name, and launched a solo artist career of her own with the creation of Hippie Chick Twang Records. Her album, Happy Face contains the song \\"Angels and Eagles\\" with Dolly Parton starring as background singer. The title cut of the album, Kim McLean composed with Kenny Alphin, Big Kenny of Big and Rich. College and record label founding At the same time she began her artist career, she used her songwriting royalties to reclaim a lost dream of a college education, cut short in her teen-age years due to an almost fatal struggle with an eating disorder. Treatment, recovery, and years of hoping led her to Trevecca Nazarene University (TNU) in Nashville, just a stone's throw from Music Row. In 2005, McLean graduated with honors and a degree in music business from TNU, and re-enrolled in the fall for the Master's Program in Bible. At this time, McLean is teaching songwriting at TNU as Adjunct Professor of Songwriting.

The station is licensed to serve the community of Kaysville, Utah, and is owned by the Educational Media Foundation. It was previously owned and operated by Wasatch Radio, LLC as trustee which Citadel Broadcasting divested, four months after picking up KHTB in the Salt Lake City cluster. While previously transmitting from Lake Mountain, the station now transmits from Farnsworth Peak, west of Salt Lake City. History The station's former radio tower, located atop Lake Mountain. Former \\"Country Legends\\" logo. KKLV signed on in 1978 as KABE on 107.1 in Orem, Utah. It ran what would be known as an adult hits format until 1983 when the station was moved to 107.5 and ran a stylized pop format as KUUT from 1983 until 1984. From 1984 to 1992, the station was known as KMGR, when in 1992, the call letters changed to KMXB before becoming KENZ in 1996. =107.5 The End= From January 1996 to 2005, the station was known as KENZ. It used its dial position to become known as \\"107.5 The End\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-01-05.pdf; The End carried an Adult Album Alternative format, similar to the later incarnation of KENZ lower on the dial on 101.9. KENZ moved down the dial to provide a better signal to the area. Since the station was broadcasting from Lake Mountain, it had difficulties covering the northern end of the Wasatch Front. The station did have a booster in Bountiful to increase signal coverage due to a terrain shadow. =Country Legends= When KENZ moved to 101.9, the station became known as KKAT. KKAT was perhaps best known as \\"Country Legends 107.5\\" with the morning show hosted by Country Joe. It played mostly classic country hits. The station was in operation from 2005‚Äì2010, before being sold to EMF. The station's former sister stations included KUBL, KENZ, KHTB, KBER, KBEE, KJQS, KFNZ and KKAT. =K-LOVE= In late March 2010, KKAT flipped to the contemporary Christian rebroadcast of K-LOVE. The KKAT website advised listeners to tune to the station's sister signal KUBL. The website also thanked listeners and stated the station was under new ownership. In March 2011, the station changed call letters to KKLV, reflecting the new format the station has held since 2010. KKLV and its sister station KNKL effectively cover the entire Wasatch Front with the same programming.

He was an early adopter of the National Romantic Style, but turned later to the neo- classical style of the 1920s. Biography  Carl Westman was born in Uppsala in 1866. He studied at the Royal Institute of Technology in 1885-1889, and then at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1889-1892, in Stockholm. In 1893 he married artist Elin Andersson and moved to the United States where he practiced with architect R. L. Daus in New York City in 1893-1895. In 1895, he returned to Stockholm to work for architect Aron Johansson (who at that time was the architect working with the new Parliament building (1895-1904) in Stockholm). In 1897, Westman opened his own architect bureau. He became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1912 and in 1916 he became the chief architect of the Swedish Royal Medical Board. Carl Westman was one of the foremost advocators in Sweden for a return to the national characteristics in architecture. He was one of the first Swedish architects who developed the new Nordic National Romantic Style, a style which took the cultural and building precedents and merged them with ideas from the English Arts and Crafts movement to create a very distinct Swedish architecture often in brick and wood. Carl Westman's Swedish General Medical Association building in Stockholm (1904-1906) was the first building built in the National Romantic Style, with the R√∂hss Museum in Gothenburg (1910-1914) and Stockholm Court House (1911-1915), providing another two prominent examples. The Stockholm Courthouse has striking similarities with the medieval Vadstena Castle, and provides a dazzling sight in downtown Stockholm, though the building proves quite inflexible for its purposes. Later on, Westman worked particularly as a hospital architect, gradually adopting the classical style of the 1920s, with noted examples being the Beckomberga Hospital (1927-1935), and the Karolinska Hospital (1935-1940) which was completed after his death. Whereas the psychiatric hospital at Beckomberga was strictly symmetrically planned, with massive buildings grouped in a fairly functional pattern, the Karolinska hospital strives towards a more functional architecture where the symmetrical design was toned down. Carl Westman was also a part-time interior designer of furniture and utility supplies such as tiled stoves. He died in Stockholm in 1936.

Tenenbom was called the \\"founder of a new form of Jewish theatre\\" by the French Le Monde and a \\"New Jew\\" by the Israeli Maariv. Tenenbom is also an academic, having university degrees in mathematics, computer science, dramatic writing and literature. Dramatic works Tenenbom has written over sixteen plays for The Jewish Theater of New York. German newspaper Die Zeit described Tenenbom's play The Last Virgin as \\"more desperately needed in Germany than suspected\\"; The New York Times, reviewing Father of the Angels, called it \\"irresistibly fascinating\\"; and Corriere della Sera, reviewing Last Jew In Europe, named Tenenbom \\"One of the most iconoclastic and innovative of contemporary dramatists.\\" Political essays and other writing Tenenbom writes for many newspapers and websites, and his political articles, cultural criticism and essays have appeared in media outlets including Die Zeit of Germany, Corriere della Sera of Italy, Yedioth Ahronot of Israel and Fox News. Tuvia Tenenbom was also a political columnist for Zeit Online; his column appeared every second week. He is a frequent contributor for Die Zeit. I Sleep in Hitler's Room Tenenbom's book I Sleep in Hitler's Room, published by an imprint of The Jewish Theater of New York, is a psychological travelogue through present-day Germany. Described by the Israeli paper Haaretz as an \\"alarming account of anti-Semitism,\\" the book details the wide spread of modern anti-Semitism in Europe. \\"Tuvia Tenenbom comes off as a Jewish Hunter S. Thompson,\\" said David P. Goldman (under the pseudonym Spengler) of the Asia Times in his review of the book, adding, \\"To understand Germans, one has to learn their language and live with them ‚Äì or read Tenenbom's book.\\" Bruce Bawer, reviewing it for PJ Media, writes: \\"It's a book in a category all its own ‚Äî deeply sobering, depressing even, in its observations of the darker side of Germany, yet at the same time so chatty and engaging and laugh-out-loud funny that it's hard to put down.\\" The book also received strong endorsement from the National Review, which called it \\"a tremendous book.\\" In December 2012, a German translation of Tenenbom's book titled Allein unter Deutschen (Alone Among Germans), published by Suhrkamp Verlag of Berlin, became an instant bestseller on the Spiegel bestseller list. Upon publication in Germany, book critics differed widely in their opinions of the work. Spiegel's Wolfgang H√∂bel and Jakob Augstein were highly critical of the book. Die Tageszeitung (taz) was extremely critical, writing that Tenenbom's book offered \\"zero insight\\", while Jungle World called the book \\"a gem.\\" The German-Jewish journalist Henryk M. Broder praised Tenenbom's \\"one- sidedness,\\" comparing him to both Michael Moore and to Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat. German TV station WDR, which Tenenbom accused in his book of assisting an anti-Semitic group in Cologne, dismissed the book as \\"embarrassing or dumb\\". Deutschlandfunk advised its listeners not to buy the book and encouraged those who had already bought it to bring it back to the bookstore. Evelyn Finger of Die Zeit Die Zeit, issue #50, 2012 (exact title? not listed on http://www.zeit.de/2012/50/index) praised the book, calling it \\"courageous\\" and describing its content as a \\"Kamikaze ride of discovery into Germany's national character.\\" In Germany's Jewish weekly J√ºdische Allgemeine, which is published by the Jewish community of Germany, Hannes Stein endorsed Tenenbom's book and findings: \\"This book contains the bitter nectar of the pure, unfiltered truth.\\" Catch the Jew! Tenenbom's book Catch the Jew!, published by Gefen Publishing recounts the adventures of Tuvia Tenenbom, who wanders around Israel of our time calling himself \\"Tobi the German.\\" In the course of numerous interviews Tuvia extracts information, sentiments, hidden theories and delusional visions motivating the miscellany of peoples forming the present-day Holy Land. The Wall Street Journal hailed the book, writing: \\"Catch the Jew! offers one of the more interesting portraits of Palestinian politics to have appeared in English,\\" and concluding that \\"no reader of Catch the Jew! can come away having failed to learn many new things about Israelis and Palestinians, two peoples we talk about so much but understand so little.\\" A reviewer for Publishers Weekly writes that Tenenbom's \\"riveting tale, chock full of unbelievable and hilarious encounters, is highly engaging and emotional, eminently readable, brutally honest, and likely the most uncensored and eye-opening report readers will see.\\" Catch the Jew! was published in Israel in September 2014 by Sela Meir publishers and became an instant best seller in Israel, reaching the 1 spot on Haaretz, Steimatzky and Yedioth Ahronot best-seller lists, winning major praise by Israeli critics. Mida called Tenenbom \\"the ultimate leftist and humanist who loves all people, is everything the left pretends to be but is not,\\"Mida while Channel 2 TV named it \\"the most important book in the last five years,\\" and Haaretz advised its readers to \\"read Tenenbom's book; we don't have the luxury not to know what he's telling us.\\"Haaretz In Germany, the book came out in November 2014 by the publishing house of Suhrkamp under the title \\"Allein unter Juden\\" (Alone Among Jews) and immediately became a Spiegel Best Seller. The book earned major endorsements by German critics. Spiegel Online said: \\"You need to have curiosity in you and a fearlessness of thought to view the Middle East story differently, a curiosity and a fearlessness that Tuvia Tenenbom has,\\" and Die Welt called it, \\"The finest book on the Middle East saga.\\"  The Lies They Tell  In October 2016 Tenenbom's third book, Allein unter Amerikanern was published by Suhrkamp Verlag in Berlin, Germany, where it became a Der Spiegel bestseller. In March 2017 it was published in English by Gefen Publishing. Tuvia Tenenbom travels through America to find out who are the Americans, the people who make up America. A contributor to Publishers Weekly wrote: \\"Brutal, irreverent, and cutting, Tenenbom‚Äôs riveting book aims to disrupt American complacency.\\" Hello, Refugees!

In Hello, Refugees! Tenenbom chronicles his visits to many refugee camps in Germany, reporting of horrific conditions in most of those camps. Additionally, Hello, Refugees! contains interviews with politicians and activists from the far-right to the far-left, whom he asked to explain to him why has Germany taken in more refugees than other European countries.

All 1,500 copies sold out, and in his biography Yoshiki says an additional pressing of 2,500 copies was scheduled, but was cancelled as guitarist Jun and bassist Hikaru had left the band. The song is notoriously known for the obvious sexual themes presented within the lyrics. Of particular notice is the fact that the track begins with heavy panting and ends with explosions, seemingly to emulate sexual climax. The title track as well as the self-titled \\"X\\" would later be re-recorded for the band's 1989 second album Blue Blood. While Yoshiki is credited with the lyrics and music for both these songs on the single, the Blue Blood recordings credit his alias \\"Hitomi Shiratori\\" for their lyrics instead. Legacy \\"X\\" has become a signature song of X Japan, being performed at nearly all of their concerts.

Built in 1931, it was the city's first unified high school, a role it served until 1958. It then served as a junior high school before being adapted to its present residential use. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Middletown Woodrow Wilson High School is located in what is now a predominantly residential area south of downtown Middletown, on the west side of Hunting Hill Avenue south of its junction with Russell Street. It is a three-story structure, built of brick with concrete trim, and covered by a hip roof topped by a small tower and cupola. Its main entrance is in a prominent Classical Revival portico, with paired pilasters flanking the second and third-floor windows, garlanded panels between those floors, and a fully pedimented gable with modillion blocks and a round panel at the center. The school was built in 1931, on what was then a more rural agricultural area. It was designed by Linus Baldwin, of Towner & Sellew Associates, to meet the growing demand for education in the city's more rural outlying areas. At first considered for use as a junior high school, and had what were then state-of- the-art facilities, including specialized classrooms, laboratory and vocational shop areas, and art and music rooms. It served as the city's high school until 1958, and then as a junior high school, before it was rehabilitated for residential use.

The name is still common in the English county of Devon. Her feast day is 8 July and her shrine is located in the North Devon village of Chittlehampton. History St. Hieritha's, Chittlehampton Urith is a fairly obscure figure. John Leland makes no mention of her, nor does Capgrave's Nova Legenda Angliae, and Nicholas Roscarock knew little of her apart from the fact of her existence. A book of her life, containing a record of her miracles, was at one time present in her shrine, and appears to be the basis of a rhyming poem in Latin now held by Trinity College, Cambridge. According to both this and William Camden, her legend was as follows: =Legend= Legend says Saint Urith was born at East StowfordHoskins, W. G. \\"Devon\\", 1954 in Swimbridge parish, in the English county of Devon. She was converted to Christianity by St Kea, lived as a hermit in nearby Chittlehampton, where she founded a church.\\"Early Saints of the Ancient Kingdom of Dumnonia\\", Orthodox Outlet for Dogmatic Enquiries At the urging of an allegedly jealous, and perhaps pagan, stepmother, some female haymakers beheaded the girl with a scythe, during a period of severe drought. When she fell to the ground, a spring of water burst from the spot and flowers, thought to be scarlet pimpernels,\\"About our School\\", Church of England Primary School, Chittlehampton sprang forth wherever a drop of her blood was sprinkled. Chanter, J. F. \\"St Urith of Chittlehampon: A Study in an Obscure Devon Saint\\", Report and Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature and Art, Tavistock, July 1914, p. 290 These last elements of her legend are the same as those found in the Lives of Sidwell and Juthwara. Urith was buried near the site of her martyrdom and a church was later built above her grave. A more likely version of her death suggests she was killed by invading Saxons, although if the traditional 8th century date is correct, this may, in reality, have been an early Viking raid. Veneration drawing of window in St Mary's Church, South Walsham, Norfolk England depicting Saint Urith.Saint Urith's holy well still stands at the east end of Chittlehampton, now called by the corrupt name of Taddy Well or Saint Teara's Well. Many of the pilgrims were sufferers of eye disease who came to anoint themselves with the holy water. There are still two stone crosses in the parish which may have been guideposts to the shrine. The exact burial place of Saint Urith was probably in the small chapel on the north side of the sanctuary of the parish church, which originally contained an image of the saint. This chapel now doubles as a passage leading to a vestry. There is reason to believe that a medieval slab there may still cover Saint Urith's body. There was a regular pilgrimage to her shrine on her feast day, 8 July, until 1539. Offerings left there were sufficient to rebuild the church tower, reputedly the finest in Devon. Even in the last year of pilgrimages, the vicar received ¬£50 from his share of the offerings. This was three times his income from tithes and glebe. By 1540 the saint's statue had been removed from the church. The pulpit of the church, carved around 1500, survives and this depicts Urith holding a martyr's palm and the foundation stone of the church. A modern statue now stands in a niche high up on the exterior of the tower and she is also shown in a stained-glass window of the 16th century found at Nettlecombe in Somerset. Continuing the tradition, the pilgrimage has now been revived and villagers still celebrate the legend on her feast day, with a procession to the well. The Trinity College hymn is sung by the congregation, the well is opened and water drawn from it and blessed. =Trinity College hymn= \\"Sing, Chittlehampton, sing!

A church on the estate dates to 867 AD and is dedicated to Pope Fabian, one of the first Christian martyrs killed in the Coliseum. It is adjacent to two rivers, the Arbia River and the Biena River, and surrounded by of vineyards, oak forests, durum wheat fields and corn fields. The estate's vineyard produces Bianco d‚ÄôArbia wine, a D.O.C. wine made with Trebbiano grapes, and a red wine made from Sangiovese grapes. In total some 1,000 bottles per year were currently produced. When Count Giuseppe and Countess Giovanna Fiorentini bought the San Fabiano farm estate, there were some 300 people farming the land, producing 180,000 liters of wine yearly, breeding Chianina cows, producing meat for the local specialty, the Fiorentina steak, pigs, pheasants and chickens. In 1956, Fiorentini acquired better equipment and reduced the agricultural activities to a core business of crops. In 1963, the Italian government introduced drastic reforms of the agricultural regulations, requiring estate owners and landlords to hire the farmers working the land, and pay them a salary. The national reform ended the centennial rules of mezzadria, a system where landowners could have farmers (contadini) living in the farmhouses and working the land, splitting the output of their work 50/50 with the landlord instead of paying rent and receiving salaries. As a result of the reforms, the farmers were forced to leave the land and twenty-five farmhouses around the castle were abandoned. The farmhouses remained unoccupied for some 30 years. Some of them have been restored by the Fiorentini brothers and some have been sold. In the 1970s, a socialist Italian government eased restrictions on import of Cuban cigars, which forced the closure of the Kentucky Tuscan Cigars manufacturing plant on the castle grounds.

The DYC clubhouse is a restored 1920s Mediterranean-style villa that is the largest yacht club clubhouse in the United States. DYC is a member of the Detroit Regional Yacht-racing Association (DRYA). History Detroit Yacht Club House, c. 1894 The club was founded by Detroit sailing enthusiasts in 1868. The first Yacht Club buildings, a small clubhouse and boatshed, were constructed in the late 1870s at the foot of McDougall Street, just south of Jefferson Avenue. In the early 1880s, the members were divided over the club's growing social activities, and in 1882, one group broke away to form the Michigan Yacht Club. The remainder elected James Skiffington Commodore (the club's title equivalent to the \\"President\\" of other recreational and social organizations) in 1884. The original Belle Isle clubhouse was built at a cost of $10,000 (with a further $2,000 for furnishings) in 1891, but burned down in 1904. A new facility was quickly built at the same site. In 1923, the present-day clubhouse was dedicated; its construction had cost more than one million dollars, the work of architect George D. Mason, who also designed the Detroit Masonic Temple (the world's largest) and the opulent Gem Theatre. By the end of the following year, membership had reached 3000. Prominent member and Commodore Gar Wood set world speed records in hydroplanes, and with his Gold Cup victories brought the club to national and even worldwide prominence. Beginning in 1921, the DYC started sponsoring the hydroplane races. Membership declined dramatically during the Great Depression, and some services were suspended. In 1946, all bonds had been paid, and the club was debt-free. The club's women formed the first women's sailing organization in the country and raced the club's catboats. During the next decade, dining facilities would be expanded, and theater-quality projection equipment installed in the ballroom, where Sunday evening screenings became a regular feature of club life. There has recently been an effort to bring back Sunday night movies. During the 1960s, an outdoor, Olympic-size swimming pool was added, and the West End docks were built, increasing the number of boat wells to over 350. The DYC has long been a symbol of privilege and exclusivity. Up until the 1970s, Black applicants were routinely rejected, until psychiatrist Dr. Leonard Ellison filed a lawsuit, and became the first Black member. More recently, the club added additional facilities like a fitness center and opened the Bitter End lounge area to allow for women to enter. Before the restoration, the Bitter End could only be accessed through the men's locker room. The newly restored Bitter End is also used for hosting small parties. In 2018, the Detroit Yacht Club celebrated its sesquicentennial (150th) anniversary. Raymond W. Batt Jr. was elected to serve as the Commodore of the Detroit Yacht Club during the sesquicentennial year. dyc.com Clubhouse The Detroit Yacht Club clubhouse was designed by architect George D. Mason in a Mediterranean Revival style. The building sits on a man-made island constructed from fill dirt excavated from other construction projects. The cornerstone of the building was laid in 1922 by Gar Wood and the building was completed in 1923. The clubhouse is a rambling, informal structure.

Its previous title up until 2018 was No. 22 (Training) Group. It is responsible for RAF training policy and controlling the Royal Air Force College and the RAF's training stations. As such, it is the direct successor to Training Group. History Although No. 22 Group was due to be formed on 1 April 1918, the same day as the RAF was established, it was not activated until 1 July 1918 in the RAF's North-Western Area. It was activated at East Fortune but moved its headquarters to the Station Hotel, Stirling.Air of Authority - A History of RAF Organisation: Groups 20-29 The next month, on 8 August 1918, it received the designation 'Operations', or possibly 'Marine Operational', making its full title No. 22 (Operations) Group or possibly No. 22 (Marine Operational) Group. It controlled No. 78 Wing RAF, and stations at Auldbar, Chathill (airship station), Dundee, East Fortune, Kirkwall/Orkney, Longside (airship station), Luce Bay, RAF Machrihanish, Peterhead & Strathberg. With the post First World War RAF force reductions, No. 22 Group was disbanded on 30 May 1919. The next creation of No 22 Group came on 12 April 1926 when the group was re-formed from No 7 Group within Inland Area. The group's designation was No. 22 (Army Co-operation) Group and its headquarters was at South Farnborough. On 17 February 1936, No 22 Group was transferred from the control of Inland Area to that of the Air Defence of Great Britain. Later that same year, on 1 May, the group was raised to command status. However, only just over two months later, on 14 July, the newly created command was reduced back to group status, becoming part of Fighter Command on the day of Fighter Command's creation. In 1938 the group comprised 26 Squadron at Catterick; RAF Hawkinge with 2 Squadron; RAF Odiham & No. 50 (Army Cooperation) Wing, with 4, 13, and 53 Squadrons; RAF Old Sarum with the School of Army Co-operation and 16 and No. 59 Squadron RAFs; and group headquarters and No. 1 Anti-Aircraft Cooperation Unit at South Farnborough.Royal Air Force List 1938, page 151. On 24 June 1940 No 22 Group was once again raised to command status and later that year, on 1 December, the new command was expanded to become RAF Army Cooperation Command. On 1 August 1943, the group was re-established as No. 22 (Training) Group in Technical Training Command, responsible for all training in ground trades, from electronics to cooking. The group continued in its training function for nearly 30 years until it was disbanded 31 January 1972. The current creation of No. 22 Group was established on 30 October 2006, once again as No. 22 (Training) Group.

The Royal Parks charity was created as a company limited by guarantee in March 2017 and officially launched in July 2017. Its chief executive is Andrew Scattergood. The charity took over the main responsibilities of management from the Royal Parks Agency ‚Äì a former executive agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport ‚Äì and from the Royal Parks Foundation, which is a separate charity. Role The charity's primary focus is to support and manage 5,000 acres of parkland across London.Written answer to the House of Commons from the Head of the Royal Parks Service, 7 February 2002. Retrieved 4 May 2020 The charity runs programmes of activities and events to encourage outdoor recreation and public access to these areas. It also allows third parties to run such activities within the grounds to further these objectives, but commercial activity is tightly controlled. The Royal Parks charity also regulates filming, audio recording and the taking of photographs in these areas for anything other than personal use through the issuing of licences. It also issues news permits to the media for the specific purpose of covering breaking news items relating to the parks. Holders of the licences and permits are required to comply with the following pieces of legislation: * The Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997 * Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces (Amendment) Regulations 2004 As well as the eight royal parks in its care, the charity also manages Brompton Cemetery, Victoria Tower Gardens, Poet's Corner and Canning Green. It also tends to the gardens of 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street. The parks are owned by the Crown with their responsibility resting with the Secretary of State for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The Royal Parks charity manages the parks on behalf of the government. Charitable objectives The Royal Parks' charitable objects set out the main purpose of the charity and what it aims to achieve. They are: *To protect, conserve, maintain and care for the royal parks, including their natural and designed landscapes and built environment, to a high standard consistent with their historic, horticultural, environmental and architectural importance; *To promote the use and enjoyment of the royal parks for public recreation, health and well-being including through the provision of sporting and cultural activities and events which effectively advance the objects; *To maintain and develop the biodiversity of the royal parks, including the protection of their wildlife and natural environment, together with promoting sustainability in the management and use of the royal parks; *To support the advancement of education by promoting public understanding of the history, culture, heritage and natural environment of the royal parks and (by way of comparison) elsewhere; and *To promote national heritage including by hosting and facilitating ceremonies of state or of national importance within and in the vicinity of the royal parks. The Royal Parks board The Royal Parks charity is led by a board of trustees, which decides how the charity is run, how it spends its money and ensures what it does is for the benefit of the parks and their visitors. The trustees are led by a chairman, and are appointed for their skills and experience. Alongside some ex-officio roles, others are appointed by the Secretary of State for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Greater London Authority (GLA). They are non-executive and unpaid. The members of The Royal Parks charity's board are: Loyd Grossman CBE (Chairman), Councillor Nickie Aiken, Ruth Anderson, Heather Blackman, Lt Col Michael Vernon, Bronwyn Hill CBE, Wesley Kerr OBE, Jeff Jacobs, Councillor Georgia Gould, Richard Hamilton and Councillor Danny Thorpe. The Royal Parks senior management team The senior management team oversees the day-to-day running of the Royal Parks charity. Led by a chief executive, the team recommend the charity's policy and strategy to the board of trustees, as well as managing an expert and committed workforce of staff and volunteers dedicated to offering free open space in London.

Vinci had originally tendered separate bids costed for minimum wage staff and Living Wage staff ‚Äì and its minimum wage bid was accepted, meaning that the approximately 50 cleaners/attendants were earning ¬£8.21 an hour by 2019. Then, with several joining UVW union in pursuit of the London Living Wage (¬£10.75) and going on strike in October 2019 with further strikes planned, the Royal Parks board agreed to fulfil their wage demands in December 2019, backdated to November 1st. However, during the tendering process, Vinci and Royal Parks had also determined purely statutory entitlements in respect of overtime, on-call allowance, sick pay, annual leave, pensions, redundancy pay and maternity pay ‚Äì and these inequalities with Royal Parks employees persisted. The two employers had allegedly repeatedly reviewed the general terms of Vinci's staff between 2014 and 2019, and Royal Parks had never opted to improve any part of their contracts. It was announced in April 2020 that the barrister Changez Khan and 15 claimants would bring a racial discrimination \\"landmark test case\\" against the Royal Parks charity. Khan claims that \\"the difference in pay until December last year and ongoing difference in other conditions have a 'disparate impact' on black and ethnic minority workers, as they are more likely to be outsourced agency workers.\\" References External links Category:2017 establishments in England Category:Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Category:Executive agencies of the United Kingdom government Category:Gardening in England Category:Royal Parks of London ","title":"The Royal Parks"},{"id":"7745079","text":"Abattoir Blues may refer to: * Abattoir Blues (novel), a 2014 novel by Peter Robinson * Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus, a 2004 album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds ","title":"Abattoir Blues"},{"id":"7745096","text":"Campanella (plural campanelle) is Italian for 'little bell', and may refer to: *Campanella (surname) *Campanella (fungus), a genus in family Marasmiaceae *La Campanella, a piano √©tude by Franz Liszt See also * Campanelle, a type of pasta shaped like a small bell or flower * Campanile (disambiguation) *Campanula, a genus of plant in family Campanulaceae *‚Äô‚ÄôCampanella is one of two main characters in Kenji Miyazawa's novel, Night on the Galactic Railroad *Shukufuku no Campanella, a visual novel by Windmill *Wednesday Campanella, a Japanese music group ","title":"Campanella"},{"id":"7745101","text":"Desmosine is an amino acid found uniquely in elastin, a protein found in connective tissue such as skin, lungs, and elastic arteries. Desmosine is a component of elastin and cross links with its isomer, isodesmosine, giving elasticity to the tissue. Detection of desmosine in urine, plasma or sputum samples can be a marker for elastin breakdown due to high elastase activity related to certain diseases.Millipore product catalogue, purified desmosine  Structure  Desmosine and its isomer isodesmosine are both composed of four lysine residues, allowing for bonding to multiple peptide chains. The four lysine groups combine to form a pyridinium nucleus, which can be reduced to neutralize positive charge associated, and increase the hydrophobicity. The four lysines form side chains around the pyridinium nucleus with exposed carboxyl groups. The difference between desmosomes and isodesmosines are an exchange of a lysine side chain on carbon 1 with a proton on carbon 5. Desmosine is associated with alanine, bonding with it on the N terminal side. It is this alanine association that allows it to bond well with pairs of tropoelastin, to form elastin and elastin networks. Desmosine and isodesmosine are unable to be differentiated thus far because of the lack of technology. The differentiation would be helpful in order to understand desmosine and its properties better. Currently, mass spectrometry is used and aids in the release of characteristic fragments which would help with differentiation, especially in larger peptides.  Synthesis  Desmosine has pathways for form multiple conformations of itself, both through biosynthesis and through man- made systems. = Biosynthesis = The formation of desmosines occurs within the formation of precursor tropoelastin. The tropoelastin initially lacks any of these complex binding molecules, and has a similar make up to that of the final stage elastin, however it contains a greater amount of lysine side chains, which directly corresponds with desmosines later found. These precursor molecules are processed through Dehydrogenation, along with dihydroD, and ultimately form elastin bound with desmosine. Through the Lysyl oxidase enzyme, lysyl c- amino groups is oxidized, forming allysine. This spontaneously condenses with other allysine molecules to form a bifunctional cross-link, allysine aldol, or with a c-amino group of lysine, forming dehydrolysinonorleucine. These compounds are then further condensed to form a tetrafunctional pyridinium cross-links of desmosines and isodesmosines. These reactions occur with lysines in areas of high alanine, due to alanine having a small side chain that won't block the enzyme binding to the lysine groups. = Lab Synthesis = Desmosines can be synthesized in a lab through a few methods, like palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. The various treatments can create slightly different confirmations. Process of Desmosine Synthesis through biological pathways, allowing creation of pyridinium ring from lysyl side chains  Bonding  Desmosine bonding in alanine rich areas, which allow for enzymes to bond and create the unique double crosslink that sets desmosine apart. Some models of bonding for desmosines, created through the study of bovine ligament elastin, suggest a combination of desmosine and secondary cross-linking to bind together peptide chains. This model has desmosine bonding near an alanine on the peptide chain, then to 3 other amino acids on the 2 peptide chains, despite being able to bond to up to 4 chains. It has been suggested that the secondary cross-linking occurs with either desmosine or lysinonorleucine, which maintains an alpha helix conformation in alanine rich sections on peptides. Both isodesmosine and desmosine can have similar bonding sites in elastin, though it rarely shown this way in nature. They more often will appear in close proximity to each other on the peptide chain. = Bonding in elastin/collagen = Desmosine is found to have a hydrogen bond donor count of eight and a hydrogen bond acceptor count of twelve.National Center for Biotechnology Information. PubChem Compound Database; CID=25435, https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/25435 (accessed Apr. 13, 2018)  Function  Elastin, a protein in the extracellular matrix, provides elasticity and is a soluble precursor to tropoelastin. When elastin cross links it produces desmosine and isodesmosine.Schr√§der, C. U., Heinz, A., Majovsky, P., & Schmelzer, C. (2015). Fingerprinting Desmosine-Containing Elastin Peptides. American Society for Mass Spectrometry,26(5), 762-773. doi:10.1007/s13361-014-1075-9 Link to article: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13361-014-1075-9.pdf When desmosine is mentioned, it is usually grouped with isodesmosine, the other tetrafunctional amino acid that is specific to elastin. Demosine can not only be found in elastin, but also in urine, plasma, sputum, and there are different ways to identify and measure these quantities. This means that it is used as a biomarker for elastin degradation which can be a detection for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Desmosine is a potential biomarker for matrix degradation. Mass spectrometry of desmosine. DOI:10.1007/s13361-014-1075-9Desmosine and Isodesmosine are unable to be differentiated thus far because of the lack of technology. The differentiation would be helpful in order to understand desmosine and its properties better. Currently, mass spectrometry is used and aids in the release of characteristic fragments which would help with differentiation, especially in larger peptides. = Material properties = The molecular weight of this rare amino acid that is found in elastin is 526.611 g/mol. The desmosine pyridinium ring has three allysyl side chains and one unaltered lysyl side chain. It has been tested to show that the pyridinium core of Desmosine remains intact even at very high collision energies.  Current usage in medicine  Desmosine is currently used as a biomarker in the medical field. It is measured in order to monitor elastin breakdown. Since it is connected to the degradation of elastin, it can be used to identify COPD. Desmosine is one of the oldest biomarkers and was developed in the 1960s, but the first time it was correlated to lung elastin content was in the 80s through urinary excretion. Biomarkers are judged in 6 ways: # Biomarkers should be central to the pathophysiological process # They should be a ‚Äò‚Äòtrue‚Äô‚Äô surrogate end-point # Biomarkers should be stable and vary with disease progression only # The severity of the condition should relate to the concentration of the Biomarker # Progression should be predicted # Effective treatment should show change Even though desmosine can check-off the first three it cannot check off the rest. And this is why research is being done to further the validation of using desmosine as a biomarker for certain diseases like COPD.  Application of desmosine  Organization of elastin (red) and cell nuclei (blue) in both young and old SDFT and CDET, two equine tendons. With increasing age, there is a distinct decrease in elastin content in the SDFT. Because desmosine is most prevalent in mature elastin, it can be consistently located and measured in urine samples after elastin breakdown in the human body. Desmosine does not exist elsewhere within the body, nor can it be sourced from elsewhere outside the body, which isolates it as a key marker for elastin breakdown. Indeed, desmosine \\"has been studied as a marker of elastin breakdown in several chronic pulmonary conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and chronic tobacco use.\\" In one study, hyperoxic mice that formed alveoli as a result of lung maturation also showed drastic changes in collagen and elastin within the lungs, as well as a change in cross-linking. In another study, deceased patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were reported to have higher concentrations of desmosine in their urine than those patients who survived ARDS, and higher concentrations of desmosine revealed that \\"more severe damage to the extracellular matrix occurred in the most critically ill [acute lung injury] patients.\\" However, it has been argued in the same study that desmosine does \\"not correlate well with markers of disease severity,\\" correlating only weakly with age. Instead, it is suggested \\"that desmosine may be more useful in understanding the pathogenesis of ALI and less useful as a marker of disease severity.‚Äù The current standard for measuring lung disease progression, for example, is measured through the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) compared to the maximum lung capacity; in other words, the volume of air a person can exhale from full lungs in one second compared to their maximum lung capacity. This method, while simple and physiologically thorough, has biological limitations, and so a superior biological marker is being sought after. Desmosine has been studied as one such biological marker, with studies in the 1980s to link urinary desmosine concentration with elastin breakdown in the lungs. Though large amounts of data have been collected with regards to desmosine's potential as a replacement biological marker in determining disease progression, some believe there is still insufficient evidence for desmosine to meet and fill this need. In orthopedics, one study examined equine tendons and how their increasing stiffness and fatigue with age was due to fragmentation of the elastin in the tendons. The superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) and the common digital extensor tendon (CDET) were analyzed for elastin composition, comparing older tendons to younger ones. While both the CDET and the SDFT are positional tendons, enabling muscles to move the skeleton, the SDFT also stores energy and is far more elastic than the CDET due to \\"specialization of the [interfascicular matrix] to enable repeated interfascicular sliding and recoil.\\" Desmosine concentrations were reported to be far greater in new tendons than in tendons that had partially degraded, suggesting that not only is there fragmentation of tendon elastin with age, but also a smaller total composition of elastin within the SDFT, though this was not true in the case of the CDET examined. Research has also been performed to determine the cross-linking structure of elastin, in an effort to better understand the relationship between elastin and pertinent diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and aortic aneurysms. A study was conducted to find this structure through synthesis of a cyclic peptide containing desmosine, to partially mimic elastin in the hopes of running mass spectrometry on the peptide to reveal the cross- linking structure. The elastin mimic was eventually synthesized successfully, and though work has not yet been done to clarify the cross-linking structure of elastin, preliminary mass spectrometry demonstrated the presence of the expected ion formed from the chemical reactions used.

The company is based in Edison, New Jersey, and distributes throughout the United States and Canada as well as in Europe, Japan, Australia, and South America. Gund is currently run by third generation family owner Bruce Raiffe whose grandfather Jacob Swedlin purchased the company from the original founder (Adolph Gund) in 1925. The company is best known for its line of Teddy bears, and holds or has held licensing agreements with companies such as The Walt Disney Company, Sesame Workshop, Uglydolls, Boo, the World's Cutest Dog, Grumpy Cat, Cartoon Network and Pusheen. It has won multiple awards during its 125+ years and was also the face of a United States Postal Service stamp. Gund is headquartered in Edison, New Jersey and currently a division of Spin Master, which acquired the company from Enesco in March 2018.http://kidscreen.com/2018/03/05/spin- master-acquires-plush-manufacturer-Gund In the 1980s, China became one of Gund's primary sources for stuffed toys. History = 1898‚Äì1925: Formation through retirement of Adolf Gund = Progression of Gund logos from inception through 2016. Gund was founded in 1898 by Adolf Gund. He was born in Germany and resided in Norwalk, Connecticut before settling in New York City. He started Gund as a small toy and novelty company which was incorporated under the name Gund Manufacturing Company in 1910. In the early years, Gund used GEE as the company slogan in advertising on product labels. Gund produced its first products in loft factories around New York City. It moved from location to location as it expanded, starting off on Third Avenue and eventually moving to Ninth Street by 1922. The moves were all prompted by the need for larger manufacturing quarters. In the early 1900s, Gund received numerous patents that introduced various mechanisms into plush toys. Once such patent was for what was described as a \\"springing dog.\\" The design called for a mechanism to be placed inside the stuffed animal which would cause it to jump, \\"bringing it to life.\\" Another patent was for a walking mechanism which allowed the plush to walk. One of the company's most notable patents was for a \\"ride-on duck\\" which was a duck for children to ride on. It had wheels that operated a working duck bill which moved up and down as the wheels turned. The ride-on duck was produced by Gund for approximately 10 years commencing in 1912. Gund also secured many other patents for toys such as the wind-up walking plush, dancing toys, and walking toys. Gund created many of the industry standards in its early years, including safety standards and the manufacturing processes for toys. It continued to market its products under the moniker GEE up until the late 1920s, as evidenced in various advertisements in Playthings and other toy magazines. The company was eventually sold when Adolf Gund retired in 1925. = 1925‚Äì1968: New ownership and expansion = During the early years of the company, Adolf Gund was the mentor to Jacob Swedlin, a Russian immigrant who came to the United States in 1907. Gund taught Swedlin to become a cutter and pattern maker, teaching him the ins and outs of the company. When Gund retired in 1925, he sold the company to Swedlin for $1,500. Swedlin brought his brothers Abe and John on board with the company, which began rapid expansion. Jacob oversaw design and production, Abe acted as the chief financial officer, and John ran sales and promotions. Some of the most notable Gund products in the 1930s included its line of Easter Bunnies which continue to be one of its most popular products. It also introduced \\"puppy purses,\\" a stuffed animal dog that doubled as a purse. Gund also became the first licensor of cartoon characters, producing plush toy versions of Popeye, Mickey Mouse, Felix the Cat, and Tigger. Its relationship with The Walt Disney Company began in 1947 and contributed to expansion of Gund. The deal with Disney allowed Gund to supply every major toy retailer in the United States with licensed Disney merchandise. In the 1940s, Gund received trade mark registrations for two versions of its logos, both of which can be seen on its products during that time. One of the logos was a lower-case \\"g\\" with bunny ears which became synonymous with the company and its products. The popularity of the logo sparked the creation of a new plush character known as \\"Gundy.\\" Gundy became the company mascot and grew into merchandising that included the \\"Gund Club.\\" During World War II in the early 1940s, Gund did not manufacture its products according to prior demand. To support the war effort, Gund only offered its products on a quota allotment. It also produced a doll in an army uniform as its way to encourage the purchase of war bonds. After the war, Gund began rapid expansion, releasing new products, including many new Disney characters in conjunction with the opening of Disneyland in California in 1955. It moved into a new manufacturing center in Brooklyn in 1957, a location that would produce its toys until 1974. = 1969‚Äì1990: Further expansion and the Raiffe family = By 1969, Gund had become dependent on its licensing agreement with Disney for the majority of its business. Herbert Raiffe, the son-in-law of John Swedlin, became the company president in 1969 after Swedlin's passing. Raiffe began moving Gund away from its licensing agreements and shifted the focus to internal design. The company launched new products that included the \\"Bag Full of Laughs,\\" a sound mechanism placed in a fabric sack and sewn into a plush. During the 1970s, Gund expanded its product line by releasing toys and plush popular in other countries. This included beanies and Gonk toys. In 1972, Gund was able to expand again thanks to Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, two panda bears gifted to the United States from China as part of that country's panda diplomacy efforts. The plush industry had a huge demand for panda stuffed animals, with Gund leading the way with manufacturing and distribution. Raiffe was credited by publications such as Forbes for Gund marketing efforts of the bears. The 1980s brought about one of Gund's most prominent branding campaigns, known as \\"Gotta Getta Gund.\\" The campaign is credited as making Gund one of the most recognized toy companies in the United States. During this decade, Gund also expanded its offering of stuffed bears, releasing its collectible series of bears called the Signature Collection. Each bear was signed by the Rita Raiffe, Gund's Director of Design and sold in limited quantities. In 1986 it released 60 new items, the most ever since the company was formed. =1990‚Äì2014: 100th anniversary and postage stamp = In 1990, Gund appeared before a US Senate committee to lobby for extending most favoured nation (MFN) status to China, stating \\"the MFN duty status that China has enjoyed enabled China to become one of Gund's primary sources for stuffed toys\\". In 1993, Bruce Raiffe became President of Gund. Prior to that time he served as the company's Marketing Director and later Vice President. Gund celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1998. As part of the celebration, Gund auctioned off a 100th anniversary bear which raised $100,000 for four children's charities. The bear was one-of-a-kind and purchased by Yoshihiro Sekiguchi who placed it in one of three Teddy bear museums he owned in Japan. It was the 100th anniversary of the Theodore Roosevelt \\"teddy bear\\" that brought about Gund's next milestone. In 2002, the United States Postal Service used a 1948 teddy bear of Gund to grace a 37 cent stamp in honor of the event. Gund entered into a licensing agreement with Sesame Street in 2003. = 2008‚Äìpresent: Purchase by Enesco and beyond = Gund was purchased by Enesco, the giftware manufacturer best known for its line of Precious Moments figurines. Gund joined Enesco's other recently purchased brands which included Boyds Bears, Our Name is Mud, philoSphie's and Jubilee Art. Bruce Raiffe remained with the company on a consultant type basis, but returned in 2011 when he was again appointed president of Gund. Gund continued to take on new licensing agreements after being purchased by Enesco. One of the most notable was that for the Uglydolls line of plush toys, which it signed in 2012. The same year it signed an agreement for Boo, the World's Cutest Dog. It also added Grumpy Cat in 2013 and Pusheen in 2014. Gund went through rebranding in late 2015. It included a redesigned logo that reflects its signature plush toys. This new identity system was designed by a NYC-based digital branding agency Cynda Media Lab, and it received several national and international design awards, including 2016 Communication Arts Design Annual Award, 2017 HOW Logo Design Award, 2017 iF Design Award, and 2017 A'Design Award. It also released more than 200 new items as part of its 2016 campaign. It was in late 2015 that Enesco was purchased by private equity fund Balmoral Funds. Gund's most recent campaign is for a charitable cause that involves \\"giving huggable joy to children in need,\\" and incorporating social media with the hashtag #howdoyouhug.http://Gund.com/pages/history Products Gund is the manufacturer of plush stuffed animals. It sells over 1500 products including Gund, Baby Gund, Gund Bears, Gund Snuffles teddy bears, and Gund Holiday. Gund is known for under-stuffing their products to make them softer than competing teddy bears. One of Gund's most popular bears is Snuffles, a plush the company launched in 1981. Snuffles was one of the first plushes to contain soft stuffing, which began a trend in the industry. \\"Snuffles has been a beloved Gund teddy bear for over 30 years, with its popular crescent moon design.\\" Some of Gund's popular products include Philbin, Peek-a-boo bear, Spunky, My First Teddy, and Sesame Street Elmo.

P. A. Healy in 1881 Mary R. Seney Sheldon (July 3, 1863 ‚Äì June 16, 1913) was the first female president of the New York Philharmonic. She is credited with reorganizing the orchestra into a modern institution in 1909. One of her major contributions was the hiring of Gustav Mahler. Childhood Sheldon was one of nine children, and was born on July 3, 1863. She was the descendant of men who had been actively involved in the early American republic: Joshua Seney represented Maryland in the Continental Congress and James W. Nicholson was one of the first commodores in the United States Navy. Her grandfather, Robert Seney, was a graduate of Columbia College and a Methodist minister who preached in Astoria (in present-day Queens). His son was the well-known banker, philanthropist, and art collector George Ingraham Seney (1826‚Äì92), who was educated at Wesleyan University and New York University. George Seney married Phoebe Augusta Moser, of a prominent Brooklyn family, in 1849. By the time she was a teenager, the Seney family was living at 4 Montague Terrace in \\"one of the finest houses in Brooklyn,\\" and her father was the president of the Metropolitan Bank in Manhattan, which was a national institution. Sheldon grew up in a philanthropic family. In 1881, George Seney gave half a million dollars to establish the Methodist Hospital in what is now Park Slope, Brooklyn. That same year, he also gave away eighteen-year-old Mary as the bride of George Rumsey Sheldon, a Harvard graduate who had his own banking firm in New York City.Leonard, John W., ed. (1909). Who's Who in New York City and State, Vol. 4, p. 1175. L. R. Hamersly & Co. Within three years, as a result of the Panic of 1884, the Seney family was forced to sell its home as well as auction off nearly 300 of George Seney's fine collection of paintings to pay depositors. Despite this setback, Mary's father still made major charitable contributions to local institutions such as the Industrial Home for Homeless Children, the Eye and Ear Infirmary, the Long Island Historical Society, and the Brooklyn Library. After her father's death in 1892, Mary continued this philanthropic tradition by personally supervising many of these benefactions. The New York Philharmonic In 1908, Mary Sheldon was a forty- five-year-old worldly woman with financial and political experience, when she maneuvered to put Mahler on the Philharmonic's podium and determined to build \\"the greatest orchestra America has ever heard.\\" She had two daughters, kept a yacht at Glen Cove on Long Island, and opened her home in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan's East Side for frequent musicales. Sheldon had watched her husband, a high-level Republican Party official, help put Charles Evans Hughes in the governor's mansion in Albany in 1906 and Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft in the White House in 1904 and 1908.Feder, Stuart (2004). Gustav Mahler: A Life in Crisis, p. 159. Yale University Press. Her colleagues in the endeavor to reorganize the New York Philharmonic were sixty-year-old Ruth Draper, the daughter of the publisher of the New York Sun and the widow of a prominent professor of clinical medicine at Columbia, Dr. William Draper, who had also been a gifted musician; and Nelson S. Spencer, a fifty-two-year- old pioneer in the artificial silk industry and a public-interest lawyer who had been counsel for Governor Hughes in 1907. Two younger men rounded out the core of Sheldon's group: Henry Lane Eno, at thirty-seven years of age president of the Fifth Avenue Building Co. but far better known in cultural and intellectual circles as a psychologist, poet, and author (his verse play Baglioni was published in 1905); and the European-trained pianist and composer Ernest H. Schelling, age thirty-two, \\"a connoisseur of books, prints and objects of art\\", whose wife, Lucy How Draper, had been one of the signatories of the original 1903 plan. Supporting Sheldon's reorganization efforts were sustaining members of the Guarantors' Committee who made three-year financial pledges. These included wealthy men like John D. Rockefeller, J. Pierpont Morgan, Joseph Pulitzer, August Belmont, Jr., and Thomas Fortune Ryan, but also some formidable women. Harriet (Mrs. Charles Beatty) Alexander and Mary (Mrs. Edward H.) Harriman, both prominent hostesses and philanthropists in their own right, served as Philharmonic Guarantors and, in spite of Walter Damrosch's comments about rich ladies, also as directors of the Symphony Society (so did Henry Lane Eno). Not least among the women of the Guarantors was Minnie Carl (Mrs. Samuel) Untermyer, the daughter of a German political refugee and the wife of the prominent attorney. Their townhouse at 2 East 54th Street was open to a wide variety of artists, musicians, and statesmen. Untermyer was a delegate to the National Democratic Party conventions in 1904 and 1908 yet when it came to musical matters, political affiliations were set aside. He had served as legal counsel for Damrosch, Sheldon, and others who proposed the takeover of the Philharmonic in 1903. With Mahler in the city, Sheldon now worked with Minnie Untermyer, Ruth Draper, and others to resurrect the 1903 plan. Their Committee for the two Festival Concerts, which evolved into the Philharmonic Guarantors' Committee, drew up a circular letter in April 1908 that declared: > We feel that a man of Mr. Mahler's eminence who has entered so wholly into > the spirit of training a really fine orchestra for this City, will have > trained the men to such a degree of perfection, that, if in the future, > another conductor should have to be considered, this orchestra already > formed, shall be of such a standard of excellence as to appeal to other > eminent conductors should the moment arise to engage them. Mr. Mahler sees > the promise of the very best in orchestral development in this country and > it only rests with us to determine whether we will support the best. Two and a half years later, in November 1910, the Musical Courier confirmed Mary Sheldon's vision. \\"A woman, forceful as well as tender, with a consuming love of art and a deep love for humanity, has, by the aid of a few friends and her own determination, provided New York with a great orchestra, a thing that never existed until this new combination took matters in hand. Like almost every one who does something extraordinary for the world, this woman, outside of her immediate circle of friends and acquaintances, has not received the appreciation due her. Mrs. George R. Sheldon ... is the lady who has wrought this marvel, and it is high time the American musical public was convinced of the fact.\\" On May 28, 1912, Mary R. Seney Sheldon became the first woman elected president of the New York Philharmonic, a position not to be held by a woman again for nearly seven decades. She died after a long illness on June 16, 1913, a month shy of her fiftieth birthday, Mahler's age when he died just two years before. As late as May 22, she hosted in her home what was to be the last meeting of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors before her death. The minutes of their first gathering after her death, in an unusually long tribute, express \\"the great affection and regard in which she was held by all its members\\" recording \\"her untiring services to the Society and the cause of music and ... the immeasurable loss which the Society and the individual members of the Board will suffer in their deprivation of her presence and of her activities.\\" Sheldon worked both behind the scenes and in the public eye nearly 100 years ago to strengthen the New York Philharmonic financially and artistically. Through her efforts, the sum of $300,000 (equal to $3.4 million today) was raised to support the orchestra at the very moment that Mahler assumed its musical leadership. The confluence of these two achievements was pivotal in the history of the orchestra, setting a new standard of excellence for the future. Mahler's music as interpreted by the New York Philharmonic on their historic CD collection carries Sheldon's legacy into the 21st century. Critics \\"This agitation seems to have been started by two or three restless women with no occupation and more money than they seem to know what to do with,\\" charged an angry Walter Damrosch in the pages of The New York Times in August 1908. He then dismissed Sheldon and the nascent Philharmonic Guarantors' Committee with the opinion, \\"There are people to whom music is only food for nervous excitement and each successive European celebrity visiting this country a toy to play with.\\" Damrosch was responding to an interview Sheldon gave to the Times correspondent in Paris, in which she announced that Mahler would conduct a symphony orchestra in New York for the 1909/10 season. Sheldon had spent the spring of 1908 engaging Mahler for two festival concerts at Carnegie Hall that coming winter. In April she told The New York Times, \\"Mr. Mahler's influence has been deeply felt at the Metropolitan Opera House this winter and we have to thank Mr. [Heinrich] Conried for bringing him over. While he is here it would be a pity if he should not have a chance to conduct purely orchestral music with an orchestra of his own. Since the idea first came to me I have talked it over with many of my friends, and all of them have been extremely enthusiastic.\\" By the time Sheldon spoke to the press again that summer, she had already been to Munich to solicit advice from Richard Strauss and Felix Mottl about improving the orchestra and, according to the Times, had \\"already raised a large subscription fund.\\" What peeved Damrosch, however, was not Sheldon's interest in Mahler. It was her claim that \\"New York orchestras at present are not worthy\\" and her determination \\"to go ahead and form another\\" that would be \\"the greatest orchestra America has ever heard.\\" Damrosch was no doubt aggravated to read Sheldon's account of a meeting in May with Richard Arnold, revealing that the thought of a third symphony orchestra in New York had made the Philharmonic Society nervous. According to Sheldon, Arnold reportedly said: \\"There is not room for another orchestra in New York; let's put the two organizations together and let Mahler conduct our orchestra.\\" If the story is true, Sheldon must have been delighted at Arnold's capitulation to a plan she and several other wealthy New Yorkers (along with Walter Damrosch) had put forward as early as 1903 and which the orchestra‚Äîtaking exception to the idea of giving up control of the organization's finances‚Äîrejected. On the other hand, it is possible that Sheldon had just executed a clever political maneuver to pressure the Philharmonic to come around to her point of view. Offering the Philharmonic to Mahler in 1909‚Äì10 came as a surprise to Times, which was under the impression that the Orchestra had committed to Wassily Safonoff. Sheldon took the opportunity of this Times interview to clearly restate the Guarantors' prerequisites: It would be necessary to make many changes in the organization. The strings, I think, could scarcely be improved, but some of the other parts would have to be reinforced. Then a certain number of our board would have to be placed on the Philharmonic board ... [As Strauss and Mottl suggested,] it would be best to plan the season of our orchestra to last thirty weeks, and that is another arrangement which must be made with the Philharmonic, as their present season lasts only sixteen ... I shall see Mr. Arnold immediately upon my return. It would be a great help to start with the Philharmonic as a nucleus. That winter the rumor mill abounded with reports of the potential rehabilitation of the Philharmonic. Sheldon was coy with the press; on December 9, 1908, the New York Sun wrote that she was \\"not quite ready to give out\\" details. Two days later, in a letter to the editor of the Times, Sheldon revealed what, on the surface, seemed to be a fundamental shift in her thinking since April: \\"So far as we can see there is nothing 'hysterical' about this plan, but a plain and commonsense attempt to save something that is very well worth saving, and benefiting thereby the musical life of New York. Nor is it, I may say, an attempt to form an orchestra for the benefit of any one conductor.\\" The phoenix of the 1903 plan was rising from the ashes! By February of the following year, Sheldon's proposed restructuring had indeed been accepted, paving the way for Mahler's engagement with the Philharmonic beginning in the autumn of 1909. The historic reorganization plan was signed by Mary and George Sheldon, Ruth Dana Draper, Henry Lane Eno, Ernest H. Schelling, and Nelson S. Spencer. Walter Damrosch's characterization of the Guarantors as \\"two or three restless women with no occupation and more money than they seem to know what to do with,\\" as well as Loudon Charlton's remark that Mahler's subsequent troubles with the Guarantors were the result of \\"too many women,\\" obscure the intelligence, business acumen, political savvy, and cultural sophistication of these women and men.

Sullivan later sold WBAZ to Mel Kahn in the late 1990s, along with then-sister station WLIE-FM. When Kahn sold WBAZ and sister WBSQ to AAA Entertainment in 2000, the group would soon undergo a realignment given that AAA's WBEA and Kahn's WBSQ were competitors with different varieties of the Hot Adult Contemporary format. With WBEA, then at 104.7 MHz, outperforming WBSQ with a poorer signal, the decision was made to move WBAZ to WBSQ's 102.5 MHz location while moving WBEA to WBAZ's 101.7 MHz frequency. WBAZ and WBSQ would simulcast for most of May 2001 with the 101.7 frequency gaining the temporary WCSO calls in the process. After this period, the WBEA format was simulcast on 101.7 and 104.7 with 101.7 gaining the WBEA calls and Beach Radio format that June. At that time, 104.7 would enter a deal with the Mohegan Sun casino and become a cross-Sound rimshot into New London, Connecticut. After the frequency switch, WBEA would soon shift in more of a CHR direction, putting it in competition with the high-rated WBLI and Connecticut rimshot WKCI. The station initially did well with its new approach, however a change in market dynamic after Arbitron made the East End of Long Island a rated market doomed the surprisingly low-rated Beach Radio format. At the end of 2004, WBEA would flip to a Hip hop format as Blaze 101.7, the first such station on Long Island. After AAA Entertainment sold their stations to Long Island Radio Broadcasting (a division of Cherry Creek Radio) took control of the stations later that year, the station would evolve to Rhythmic contemporary and would take on the new name The Beat, then reverting to \\"The Beach\\" during the summer of 2007. On May 22, 2008, and after spending four years as a Rhythmic, WBEA returned to a Top 40/CHR direction, thus once again putting the station back in competition with WBLI and WKCI and as a result left WDRE (now WPTY) as the market's lone Rhythmic outlet.

It survives as a cantata for the third day of Easter but might be a fragment of a work originally written for Purification. Given this background, and the fact that it was copied by Christian Friedrich Penzel, one of Bach's last students, there is a confusing variety of proposed composition dates. It may date back to Bach's Weimar period,Lutheran Church Year / Dates of \\"Osterdienstag\\" (Easter Tuesday, 3rd Day of Easter) although a date as late as 1735 has been suggested.David Schulenberg, \\"Der Friede sei mit dir\\" in Oxford Composer Companion: J. S. Bach ed. Malcolm Boyd  History and text  The surviving source is a copy by Penzel, identified on the title page as being for the Purification (the Lutheran feast Mariae Reinigung), which was celebrated on 2 February, but with an alternate designation for Easter Tuesday in the parts. Bach composed several cantatas for the Purification and the texts are related to Simeon's canticle Nunc dimittis, part of the prescribed readings.Erfreute Zeit im neuen Bunde, BWV 83, 1724; Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin, BWV 125, 1725 (on Luther's hymn after Nunc dimittis); Ich habe genug, BWV 82, 1727 Because of the references to the \\"Nunc dimittis\\" in Der Friede sei mit dir and because of the alternate title page designation, it is widely assumed that at least the two central movements were originally part of a longer cantata for the Purification, with a different introductory recitative not evoking Christ's Easter reappearance to the disciples. The obbligato writing in the aria, which appears better suited to flute than the \\"violino\\" specified in Penzel's copy, is cited in support of the hypothesis that it was originally written for a different occasion.David Schulenberg, op. cit. Joshua Rifkin has proposed the dates 15 April 1727 or 30 March 1728 for the premiere of the surviving Easter version.Linernotes to L'oiseau-lyre 425 822-2, cited in David Schulenberg, \\"Der Friede sei mit dir\\" in Oxford Composer Companion: J. S. Bach ed. Malcolm Boyd (p. 134) The prescribed readings for this day were from the Acts of the Apostles, the sermon of Paul in Antiochia (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the appearance of Jesus to the Apostles in Jerusalem (). The librettist is unknown but may have been Salomon Franck, quoting hymn stanzas by Johann Georg Albinus and Martin Luther.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is scored for soprano and bass vocal soloists, four-part choir, oboe, violin, and basso continuo. Because no complete copy of the work survives, it is possible that there were originally more than the four movements now known. In particular, another aria is thought to have preceded the final movement. # Recitative (bass): # Aria (bass) and chorale (soprano): (the chorale tune is by Johann Rosenm√ºller) # Recitative and arioso (bass): # Chorale:  Music  Both recitatives are \\"supple\\" and secco. The second movement is \\"a fusion of a dulcet aria in the form of a trio sonata\\" for bass, violin, and continuo, with interspersed lines from the chorale performed by soprano and oboe. It is formally a da capo aria introduced by an eighteen-measure ritornello. The work ends with a four-part harmonization of the chorale.

The movie primarily features live concert footage of the Alice Cooper band on their record-breaking Billion Dollar Babies tour, filmed in Texas (mostly at the Sam Houston Coliseum) in April 1973, with some footage from other tour stops, including the Memorial Coliseum, Portland, Oregon, intercut with 'comedy' scenes of a German film director chasing the \\"Cooper gang\\" for revenge after they abandoned his would-be masterpiece movie. Two versions of the film exist. The alternate version was issued for its original theatrical release across the US in 1974. Poorly edited and virtually unscripted, the 'storyline' segments of the original version were replaced with black & white excerpts of scenes from old Hollywood movies. Despite this the film still failed at the box office. This version of the film remains commercially unreleased, although bootleg copies have been circulating amongst fans and at Record Fairs readily since the early-1980s. The original version of the film was eventually restored and released in 2005 on DVD, which includes Cooper providing insightful audio commentary. On September 14, 2010 Shout! Factory released the film (original version) on Blu-ray for the first time. The film was shown only in Broome County, New York on its opening day, the one place in the USA that banned Alice Cooper from playing at their arena the year before. The film provides a glimpse of a far less family-friendly Alice Cooper than that portrayed in the Welcome to My Nightmare concert film (shot two years later on the lead singer's first solo tour). The concert segments were performed by the original five-piece band (plus two live session musicians) at their artistic and commercial peak, and there is ample evidence of the behavior and implications which made the early Alice Cooper character such a controversial figure. The heavy sarcasm, pointed social satire (mannequin stage-props equipped with pubic hair, skewered baby dolls, a bloody 'execution' sequence, and in the show's finale, when an American flag is unfurled and a Richard M. Nixon impersonator is 'beaten up' by the entire band), confrontational improvisation (frontman Cooper taunting audience members), and the infamous boa constrictor were all present.

The Blue Bombers defeated the favoured Lions 22‚Äì21. This was the first Grey Cup game between two teams from west of Ontario, and the first to be won by a team which had only a .500 season. Game summary Winnipeg Blue Bombers (22) - TDs, James Murphy; FGs, Trevor Kennerd (4); cons., Kennerd; singles, Trevor Kennerd, Bob Cameron (2). BC Lions (21) - TDs, Anthony Cherry, David Williams; FGs, Lui Passaglia; cons., Passaglia (2); singles, Passaglia (2); safety touch. The Lions jumped to a 7-1 lead in the opening quarter as running back Anthony Cherry scored on a 14-yard run. Kennerd kicked a 22-yard field goal to pull the Bombers within three. With the wind at his back in the second quarter, Kennerd tied the score with a 43-yard field goal. But Lions quarterback Matt Dunigan connected with David Williams on a 26-yard scoring play, giving BC a 14-7 advantage. The Bombers got that one back on their next possession. Quarterback Sean Salisbury threw a 35-yard touchdown strike to James Murphy to pull Winnipeg even. BC's Lui Passaglia failed on a 41-yard field goal attempt near the end of the half, but it did give the Lions a 15-14 lead at intermission. Passaglia and Kennerd exchanged field goals in the third quarter. The game was deadlocked at 19 heading into the final 15 minutes. With 2:55 remaining, Trevor Kennerd kicked a 30-yard field goal to put the Bombers in front for the first time in the game. With the score 22-19 in favour of the Bombers, the Lions marched 75 yards downfield to the Winnipeg seven-yard line. Dunigan's pass was batted down and intercepted in the end zone by Winnipeg's Mike Gray to snuff out the drive. The BC defence held and Winnipeg head coach Mike Riley elected to give up a safety in favour of better field position, cutting the margin to just one. The ensuing kickoff was returned by BC's Anthony Drawhorn 38 yards to the BC 45-yard line, but the ball was brought back to the 30 when Cherry was flagged for an unnecessary roughness penalty. The Lions then went three and out and turned the ball over on downs and the Bombers ran out the clock for the win.

He was a founding member of the National Action Party, and one of its theoreticians. Prior to this he was considered a leading figure in Mexican monetary policy, one of the so-called Siete Sabios de M√©xico (Seven Sages of Mexico). Early life G√≥mez Mor√≠n was born in the old mining town of Batopilas in the state of Chihuahua on 27 February 1897. His father Manuel G√≥mez Castillo (of Spanish origin) died at age 24, shortly after his son was born. His mother, Concepci√≥n Mor√≠n de Avellano, was a native of Parral, Chihuahua. His widowed mother sold their small home and moved to Parral around 1911, from there they moved to the city of Chihuahua. Later, looking for a better place for her son, she moved to Le√≥n, Guanajuato, there, in a Sacred Heart school, Manuel finished his primary school studies. His first years of preparatory school in the Mar√≠a Inmaculada school, founded by the bishop of Le√≥n, Don Emeterio Valverde y T√©llez. By 1913, mother and child left Le√≥n and moved to Mexico City where Manuel entered the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria and finished high school. From 1915 to 1919 he worked from correcting tests to writing editorials in revolutionary papers to help his family. He worked in the Secretar√≠a de Hacienda from 1919 to 1921. He married Lidia Torres Fuentes in 1924, with whom he had 4 children: Juan Manuel, Gabriela, Mauricio and Margarita. He died on 19 April 1972, in Mexico City. He rests in Mexico City's Rotonda de los Personajes Ilustres. Professional studies G√≥mez Mor√≠n studied Law during the days of the Mexican Revolution in the National University of Mexico (UNAM), and there, as a student, he struggled to gain autonomy for the university of which he served as Rector in 1933. He received the degree of Lawyer in 1918, aged 21, he taught Political Law and Constitutional Law in the University. In 1934 he received a Honoris Causa doctorate from the UNAM. Professional career He began practicing his career as a lawyer two years before graduating, and after he graduated he started his own office which he carried out in the same building until his death. With the exception of a few years he laboured in the Secretary of Finance and as rector of the UNAM, he always lived as a lawyer and in 1927 he was legal representative to the Soviet Embassy. Civil Service Career As a public servant, he occupied the post of Under-secretary of Finance, President of the Board of the Banco de M√©xico, member of the organizing commission of Banobras and collaborated in the first Commission on Studies about Social Security. He worked in the Board of the Banco de M√©xico from 1925 to 1929. He created the First Law on Agricultural Credit. He had an important role in the creation of the Constitutive Law of the Bank of Mexico, Insurance institutions and organic laws of articles 27 and 28 of the Mexican Constitution. Politics =Founding of the National Action Party= On September 15, 1939, G√≥mez Mor√≠n founded the National Action Party of Mexico along with Roberto Coss√≠o y Cos√≠o, Juan Landerreche Obreg√≥n, Daniel Kuri Bre√±a, Juan Jos√© P√°ramo Castro, Bernardo Ponce, Francisco Fern√°ndez Cueto, Carlos Ram√≠rez Zetina and Enrique Manuel Loaeza Garay. Served as the first party president from 1939 to 1949. The National Action Party won the presidential elections for the first time in the year 2000, 61 years after its founding. =\\"National Action\\" politics= The National Action Party was built on a theory of National Action politics, rejecting a fundamental adherence to right or left, which was developed by Gomez Morin and his associates as having political Pragmatism requiring the adoption policies that correspond to the problems faced by the nation at any given moment. The party ideology, at least in principle, is that of \\"National Action\\" which rejects a fundamental adherence to left- or right-wing politics or policies, instead requiring the adoption of such policies as correspond to the current problems faced by the nation in the present. According to Manuel G√≥mez Mor√≠n both right and left wing policies may be considered equally carefully in formulation of national policy. (This is a similar theoretical basis as Gaullism). Since its inception, the party has always welcomed ideologues with a strongly Catholic background, as they have been unable to find expression in other parties. This has moved the PAN's overall position on most social issues into Christian Democracy. =Belisario Dom√≠nguez Medal of Honor= The Senate of TWhe Republic awarded G√≥mez Mor√≠n the Belisario Dom√≠nguez Medal of Honor, the nation's highest honor, in a post mortem ceremony on November 6, 2013.

Underneath clusters of repeated notes, the melody is folklike. Each movement has a classical structure overall, in character with Bart√≥k's frequent use of classical forms as vehicles for his most advanced thinking. Musicologist Halsey Stevens finds in the work early forms of many stylistic traits that became more fully developed in Bart√≥k's \\"golden age\\", 1934‚Äì1940. Bart√≥k wrote Ditt√°nak, Budapesten, 1926, jun. at the end of the score, dedicating it to Ditta P√°sztory-Bart√≥k, his second wife. A performance generally lasts around 15 minutes.

Individuals who score high on neuroticism are more likely than average to be moody and to experience such feelings as anxiety, worry, fear, anger, frustration, envy, jealousy, guilt, depressed mood, and loneliness. People who are neurotic respond worse to stressors and are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. They are often self-conscious and shy, and they may have trouble controlling urges and delaying gratification. Persons with a high neuroticism index are at risk for the development and onset of common mental disorders, such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorder, symptoms which had traditionally been called neuroses. History Galen of Pergamon popularized the idea that mixes of four bodily fluids or humours resulted in four personality types or temperaments. The melancholic personality type, which can be seen as the conceptual predecessor of neuroticism, was characterized by being mentally unbalanced, fearful, anxious, or sad. According to Hippocrates, it resulted from too much black bile. Modern scientific investigations have concluded that bile (or any dark fraction of blood) is not connected to temperament. Definition Neuroticism is a trait in many models within personality theory, but there is a lot of disagreement on its definition. Some define it as a tendency for quick arousal when stimulated and slow relaxation from arousal, especially in concern to negative emotional arousal; others define it as emotional instability and negativity or maladjustment, in contrast to emotional stability and positivity, or good adjustment. Others yet define it as lack of self-control, poor ability to manage psychological stress, and a tendency to complain. Various personality tests produce numerical scores, and these scores are mapped onto the concept of \\"neuroticism\\" in various ways, which has created some confusion in the scientific literature, especially with regard to sub-traits or \\"facets\\". Individuals who score low in neuroticism tend to be more emotionally stable and less reactive to stress. They tend to be calm, even-tempered, and less likely to feel tense or rattled. Although they are low in negative emotion, they are not necessarily high on positive emotion. Being high in scores of positive emotion is generally an element of the independent trait of extraversion. Neurotic extraverts, for example, would experience high levels of both positive and negative emotional states, a kind of \\"emotional roller coaster\\". Measurement Like other personality traits, neuroticism is typically viewed as a continuous dimension rather than a discrete state. The extent of neuroticism is generally assessed using self-report measures, although peer-reports and third-party observation can also be used. Self- report measures are either lexical or based on statements. Deciding which measure of either type to use in research is determined by an assessment of psychometric properties and the time and space constraints of the study being undertaken. Lexical measures use individual adjectives that reflect neurotic traits, such as anxiety, envy, jealousy, and moodiness, and are very space and time efficient for research purposes. Lewis Goldberg (1992) developed a 20-word measure as part of his 100-word Big Five markers. Saucier (1994) developed a briefer 8-word measure as part of his 40-word mini-markers. Thompson (2008) systematically revised these measures to develop the International English Mini-Markers which has superior validity and reliability in populations both within and outside North America. Internal consistency reliability of the International English Mini-Markers for the Neuroticism (emotional stability) measure for native English-speakers is reported as 0.84, and that for non-native English-speakers is 0.77. Statement measures tend to comprise more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked the extent to which they, for example, \\"Remain calm under pressure\\", or \\"Have frequent mood swings\\". While some statement-based measures of neuroticism have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For instance, statements in colloquial North American English like \\"Seldom feel blue\\" and \\"Am often down in the dumps\\" are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand. Neuroticism has also been studied from the perspective of Gray's biopsychological theory of personality, using a scale that measures personality along two dimensions: the behavioural inhibition system (BIS) and the behavioural activation system (BAS).Gray, J.A. (1981). A critique of Eysenck's theory of personality, In H.J. Eysenck (Ed.) A model for personality (pp 246‚Äì276)Gray, J.A. (1982). The neuropsychology of anxiety: An enquiry into the functions of the septo-hippocampal system. The BIS is thought to be related to sensitivity to punishment as well as avoidance motivation, while the BAS is thought to be related to sensitivity to reward as well as approach motivation. Neuroticism has been found to be positively correlated with the BIS scale, and negatively correlated with the BAS scale. Neuroticism has been included as one of the four dimensions that comprise core self- evaluations, one's fundamental appraisal of oneself, along with locus of control, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. The concept of core self-evaluations was first examined by Judge, Locke, and Durham (1997), and since then evidence has been found to suggest these have the ability to predict several work outcomes, specifically, job satisfaction and job performance. There is a risk of selection bias in surveys of neuroticism; a 2012 review of N-scores said that \\"many studies used samples drawn from privileged and educated populations\\". Neuroticism is highly correlated with the startle reflex in response to fearful conditions and inversely correlated with it in response to disgusting or repulsive stimuli. This suggests that Neuroticism may increase vigilance where evasive action is possible but promote emotional blunting when escape is not an option. A measure of the startle reflex can be used to predict the trait neuroticism with good accuracy; a fact that is thought by some to underlie the neurological basis of the trait. The startle reflex is a reflex in response to a loud noise which one typically has no control over, though anticipation can reduce the effect. The strength of the reflex as well as the time until the reflex ceases predict neuroticism. Mental disorder correlations Questions used in many neuroticism scales overlap with instruments used to assess mental disorders like anxiety disorders (especially social anxiety disorder) and mood disorders (especially major depressive disorder), which can sometimes confound efforts to interpret N scores, and makes it difficult to determine whether each of neuroticism and the overlapping mental disorders might cause the other, or if both might stem from other cause. Correlations can be identified. A 2013 meta-analysis found that a wide range of clinical mental disorders are associated with elevated levels of neuroticism compared to levels in the general population. It found that high neuroticism is predictive for the development of anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, psychosis, and schizophrenia, and is predictive but less so for substance abuse and non-specific mental distress. These associations are smaller after adjustment for elevated baseline symptoms of the mental illnesses and psychiatric history. Neuroticism has also been found to be associated with death. In 2007, Mroczek & Spiro found that among older men, upward trends in neuroticism over life as well as increased neuroticism overall both contributed to higher mortality rates. =Mood disorders= Disorders associated with elevated neuroticism include mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, dissociative identity disorder, and hypochondriasis. Mood disorders tend to have a much larger association with neuroticism than most other disorders. The five big studies have described children and adolescents with high neuroticism as \\"anxious, vulnerable, tense, easily frightened, 'falling apart' under stress, guilt- prone, moody, low in frustration tolerance, and insecure in relationships with others,\\" which includes both traits concerning the prevalence of negative emotions as well as the response to these negative emotions. Neuroticism in adults similarly was found to be associated with the frequency of self- reported problems. These associations can vary with culture: for example, Adams found that among upper-middle-class American teenaged girls, neuroticism was associated with eating disorders and self-harm, but among Ghanaian teenaged girls, higher neuroticism was associated with magical thinking and extreme fear of enemies. =Personality disorders= A 2004 meta-analysis attempted to analyze personality disorders in light of the five-factor personality theory and failed to find meaningful discriminations; it did find that elevated neuroticism is correlated with many personality disorders. Theories of causation =Mental-noise hypothesis= Studies have found that the mean reaction times will not differ between individuals high in neuroticism and those low in neuroticism, but that, with individuals high in neuroticism, there is considerably more trial-to-trial variability in performance reflected in reaction time standard deviations. In other words, on some trials neurotic individuals are faster than average, and on others they are slower than average. It has been suggested that this variability reflects noise in the individual's information processing systems or instability of basic cognitive operations (such as regulation processes), and further that this noise originates from two sources: mental preoccupations and reactivity processes. Flehmig et al. (2007) studied mental noise in terms of everyday behaviours using the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, which is a self-report measure of the frequency of slips and lapses of attention. A \\"slip\\" is an error by commission, and a \\"lapse\\" is an error by omission. This scale was correlated with two well-known measures of neuroticism, the BIS/BAS scale and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Results indicated that the CFQ-UA (Cognitive Failures Questionnaire- Unintended Activation) subscale was most strongly correlated with neuroticism (r = .40) and explained the most variance (16%) compared to overall CFQ scores, which only explained 7%. The authors interpret these findings as suggesting that mental noise is \\"highly specific in nature\\" as it is related most strongly to attention slips triggered endogenously by associative memory. In other words, this may suggest that mental noise is mostly task-irrelevant cognitions such as worries and preoccupations. = Evolutionary psychology = The theory of evolution may also explain differences in personality. For example, one of the evolutionary approaches to depression focuses on neuroticism and finds that heightened reactivity to negative outcomes may have had a survival benefit, and that furthermore a positive relationship has been found between neuroticism level and success in university with the precondition that the negative effects of neuroticism are also successfully coped with. Likewise, a heightened reactivity to positive events may have had reproductive advantages, selecting for heightened reactivity generally. Nettle contends that evolution selected for higher levels of neuroticism until the negative effects of neuroticism outweighed its benefits, resulting in selection for a certain optimal level of neuroticism. This type of selection will result in a normal distribution of neuroticism, so the extremities of the distribution will be individuals with excessive neuroticism or too low neuroticism for what is optimal, and the ones with excessive neuroticism would therefore be more vulnerable to the negative effects of depression, and Nettle gives this as the explanation for the existence of depression rather than hypothesizing, as others have, that depression itself has any evolutionary benefit. Some research has found that neuroticism, in modern societies, is positively correlated with reproductive success in females but not in males. A possible explanation may be that neuroticism in females comes at the expense of formal education (which is correlated with lower fertility) and correlates with unplanned and adolescent pregnancies.Vall, Gemma, Fernando Guti√©rrez, Josep M. Peri, Miguel G√°rriz, Eva Baill√©s, Juan Miguel Garrido, and Jordi E. Obiols. \\"Seven dimensions of personality pathology are under sexual selection in modern Spain.\\" Evolution and Human Behavior 37, no. 3 (2016): 169-178. = Terror management theory = According to terror management theory (TMT) neuroticism is primarily caused by insufficient anxiety buffers against unconscious death anxiety. These buffers consist of: # Cultural worldviews that impart life with a sense of enduring meaning, such as social continuity beyond one's death, future legacy and afterlife beliefs, and # A sense of personal value, or the self-esteem in the cultural worldview context, an enduring sense of meaning. While TMT agrees with standard evolutionary psychology accounts that the roots of neuroticism in Homo sapiens or its ancestors are likely in adaptive sensitivities to negative outcomes, it posits that once Homo sapiens achieved a higher level of self-awareness, neuroticism increased enormously, becoming largely a spandrel, a non-adaptive byproduct of our adaptive intelligence, which resulted in a crippling awareness of death that threatened to undermine other adaptive functions. This overblown anxiety thus needed to be buffered via intelligently creative, but largely fictitious and arbitrary notions of cultural meaning and personal value. Since highly religious or supernatural conceptions of the world provide \\"cosmic\\" personal significance and literal immortality, they are deemed to offer the most efficient buffers against death anxiety and neuroticism. Thus, historically, the shift to more materialistic and secular cultures - starting in the neolithic, and culminating in the industrial revolution, is deemed to have increased neuroticism.Thirty Years of Terror Management Theory Tom Pyszczynski, Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289309102_Thirty_Years_of_Terror_Management_Theory =Genetic and environmental factors= A 2013 review found that \\"Neuroticism is the product of the interplay between genetic and environmental influences. Heritability estimates typically range from 40% to 60%.\\" The effect size of these genetic differences remain largely the same throughout development, but the hunt for any specific genes that control neuroticism levels has \\"turned out to be difficult and hardly successful so far.\\" On the other hand, with regards to environmental influences, adversities during development such as \\"emotional neglect and sexual abuse\\" were found to be positively associated with neuroticism. However, \\"sustained change in neuroticism and mental health are rather rare or have only small effects.\\" In the July 1951 article: \\"The Inheritance of Neuroticism\\" by Hans J. Eysenck and Donald Prell it was reported that some 80 per cent of individual differences in neuroticism are due to heredity and only 20 percent are due to environment....the factor of neuroticism is not a statistical artifact, but constitutes a biological unit which is inherited as a whole....neurotic predisposition is to a large extent hereditarily determined.The Journal of Mental Science  issue = 408  month & year = July, 1951  volume = XCVII  pages = 441-465 In children and adolescents, psychologists speak of temperamental negative affectivity that, during adolescence, develops into the neuroticism personality domain. Mean neuroticism levels change throughout the lifespan as a function of personality maturation and social roles, but also the expression of new genes. Neuroticism in particular was found to decrease as a result of maturity by decreasing through age 40 and then leveling off. Generally speaking, the influence of environments on neuroticism increases over the lifespan, although people probably select and evoke experiences based on their neuroticism levels. The emergent field of \\"imaging genetics,\\" which investigates the role of genetic variation in the structure and function of the brain, has studied certain genes suggested to be related to neuroticism, and the one studied so far concerning this topic has been the serotonin transporter-linked promoter region gene known as 5-HTTLPR, which is transcribed into a serotonin transporter that removes serotonin. It has been found that compared to the long (l) variant of 5-HTTLPR, the short (s) variant has reduced promoter activity, and the first study on this subject has shown that the presence of the s-variant 5-HTTLPR has been found to result in higher amygdala activity from seeing angry or fearful faces while doing a non-emotional task, with further studies confirming that the s-variant 5-HTTLPR result greater amygdala activity in response to negative stimuli, but there have also been null findings. A meta-analysis of 14 studies have shown that this gene has a moderate effect size and accounts for 10% of the phenotypic difference. However, the relationship between brain activity and genetics may not be completely straightforward due to other factors, with suggestions made that cognitive control and stress may moderate the effect of the gene. There are two models that have been proposed to explain the type of association between the 5-HTTLPR gene and amygdala activity: the \\"phasic activation\\" model proposes that the gene controls amygdala activity levels in response to stress, whereas the \\"tonic activation\\" model on the other hand proposes that the gene controls baseline amygdala activity. Another gene that has been suggested for further study to be related to neuroticism is the catechol-O- methyltransferase (COMT) gene. The anxiety and maladaptive stress responses that are aspects of neuroticism have been the subject of intensive study. Dysregulation of hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis and glucocorticoid system, and influence of different versions of the serotonin transporter and 5-HT1A receptor genes may influence the development of neuroticism in combination with environmental effects like the quality of upbringing. Neuroimaging studies with fMRI have had mixed results, with some finding that increased activity in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, brain regions associated with arousal, is correlated with high neuroticism scores, as is activation of the associations have also been found with the medial prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and hippocampus, while other studies have found no correlations. Further studies have been conducted trying to tighten experimental design by using genetics to add additional differentiation among participants, as well as twin study models. A related trait, behavioral inhibition, or \\"inhibition to the unfamiliar,\\" has received attention as the trait concerning withdrawal or fear from unfamiliar situations, which is generally measured through observation of child behavior in response to, for example, encountering unfamiliar individuals. This trait in particular has been hypothesized to be related to amygdala function, but evidence so far has been mixed. Age, sex and geographic patterns A 2013 review found that groups associated with higher levels of neuroticism are young adults who are at high risk for mood disorders. Research in large samples has shown that levels of neuroticism are higher in women than men. Neuroticism is found to decrease slightly with age. The same study noted that no functional MRI studies have yet been performed to investigate these differences, calling for more research. A 2010 review found personality differences between genders to be between \\"small and moderate,\\" the largest of those differences being in the traits of agreeableness and neuroticism. Many personality traits were found to have had larger personality differences between men and women in developed countries compared to less developed countries, and differences in three traits‚Äîextraversion, neuroticism, and people-versus-thing orientation‚Äîshowed differences that remained consistent across different levels of economic development, which is also consistent with the \\"possible influence of biologic factors.\\" Three cross-cultural studies have revealed higher levels of female neuroticism across almost all nations. Geographically, a 2016 review said that in the US, neuroticism is highest in the mid-Atlantic states and southwards and declines westward, while openness to experience is highest in ethnically diverse regions of the mid-Atlantic, New England, the West Coast, and cities. Likewise, in the UK neuroticism is lowest in urban areas. Generally, geographical studies find correlations between low neuroticism and entrepreneurship and economic vitality and correlations between high neuroticism and poor health outcomes. The review found that the causal relationship between regional cultural and economic conditions and psychological health is entirely unclear.

He was a forerunner of the modernization of Japanese Buddhism and the first (in Japan) to attempt to incorporate concepts from the natural sciences into Zen Buddhism. Hara was born in Iwakitaira Domain. At the age of 15, Hara enrolled at the Shoheizaka Academy (ÊòåÂπ≥ÂùÇÂ≠¶ÂïèÊâÄ) where he studied both Confucianism and medicine, the latter under Taki Genken. At the age of 20 or 26, he entered Buddhist priesthood, though he would go on to study Western medicine later in life. Hara became the first lecturer of Indian Philosophy and Buddhist Studies at Tokyo University in 1879. He was later superintendent of the Soto-shu Daigaku-rin (currently Komazawa University). Hara is featured in several koans. He was well known for his disregard of many of the precepts of everyday Buddhism, such as dietary laws. Appearances in Koans =The Muddy Road= This is one of the most famous stories of Tanzan. :Tanzan and Ekido were once traveling together down a muddy road. Heavy rain was falling. As they came around a bend, they met a lovely girl in a silk kimono and sash, unable to cross at an intersection. :\\"Come on, girl,\\" said Tanzan at once. Lifting her in his arms, he carried her over the mud. :Ekido did not speak until that night when they reached a lodging temple. Then he could no longer restrain himself. \\"We monks don't go near females,\\" he told Tanzan, \\"especially not young and lovely ones. It is dangerous. Why did you do that?\\" :\\"I left the girl there,\\" said Tanzan. \\"Are you still carrying her?\\" =A Buddha= In Tokyo in the Meiji era there lived two prominent teachers of opposite characteristics. One, Unsho, an instructor in Shingon, kept Buddha's precepts scrupulously. He never drank intoxicants, nor did he eat after eleven o'clock in the morning. The other teacher, Tanzan, a professor of philosophy at the Imperial University, never observed the precepts. When he felt like eating he ate, and when he felt like sleeping in the daytime he slept. One day Unsho visited Tanzan, who was drinking wine at the time, not even a drop of which is supposed to touch the tongue of a Buddhist. 'Hello, brother,' Tanzan greeted him. 'Won't you have a drink?' 'I never drink!' exclaimed Unsho solemnly. 'One who does not drink is not even human,‚Äô said Tanzan. 'Do you mean to call me inhuman just because I do not indulge in intoxicating liquids!' exclaimed Unsho in anger. Then if I am not human, what am I?' 'A Buddha.' answered Tanzan. Death Tanzan wrote sixty postal cards on the last day of his life, and asked an attendant to mail them. Then he died.

Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.Schacter, Daniel L, Daniel Wegner and Daniel Gilbert. 2007.

Donald Brown's list in Human Universals  In his book Human Universals (1991), Donald Brown defines human universals as comprising \\"those features of culture, society, language, behavior, and psyche for which there are no known exception\\", providing a list of hundreds of items he suggests as universal. Among the cultural universals listed by Donald Brown are: =Language and cognition= =Society= =Beliefs= =Technology= Non-nativist explanations The observation of the same or similar behavior in different cultures does not prove that they are the results of a common underlying psychological mechanism. One possibility is that they may have been invented independently due to a common practical problem.Language: The cultural tool DL Everett - 2012 - Vintage Since any cultures that have been studied by anthropologists have had contact with at least the anthropologists that studied it, and anthropological research ethics slows the studies down so that other groups unbound by such ethics, often at least locally represented by people of the same skin color as the supposedly isolated tribe but significantly culturally globalized, reach the tribe before the anthropologists do, no truly uncontacted culture has ever been scientifically studied.Fam Med. 2008 Jan;40(1) Continuing professional development in sensitive cultures.

This allows outside influence to be an explanation for cultural universals as well.Equal Recognition: The Moral Foundations of Minority Rights, Alan Patten 2014 This does not preclude multiple independent inventions of civilization and is therefore not the same thing as hyperdiffusionism; it merely means that cultural universals are not proof of innateness.Cultures and Globalization: Cultural Expression, Creativity and Innovation, Helmut K Anheier, Yudhishthir Raj Isar 2010 See also * Archetype * Biocultural anthropology References Bibliography  Joseph H.

He is a Strongman Super Series world Champion, a four-time World Muscle Power champion and a six-time Canada's Strongest Man. Strength career Prior to his career as a strongman competitor, Girard worked as a bouncer in a popular Quebec City nightclub on weekends while attending community college. In the early 1990s, he went to Los Angeles in order to either pursue a career as a professional bodybuilder or as an actor. After a few months, Girard came back to the province of Quebec where he was later hired as a police officer for the city of Gatineau. Girard focused on Strongman competition, and became a 6-time consecutive finalist in the World's Strongest Man competition from 1998-2004. Girard's highest placing was 4th place at the 1999 World's Strongest Man contest. In 2002 Girard reached the high point of his career to date, winning the 2002 Strongman Super Series overall title. Girard has also won the World Muscle Power Championships 4 times, in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2004. Girard dominated strongman competition in Canada for several years. He was the Canada's Strongest Man champion from 1999 to 2004. He was also the North America's Strongest Man champion in 2001 and 2002. Beginning in 2004, injuries began to plague his career including back to back injuries to his achilles tendon in 2005, the first of which took place at the 2005 Arnold Strongman Classic forcing him to retire from the contest. These injuries required a long period of rehabilitation, and nearly a year and a half to fully recover. At one point Girard was in a cast up to his waist. Girard's comeback took place at the 2006 Mohegan Sun Super Series event. After winning the first event, he tore his patellar tendon in the second event, the Conan's Wheel and was forced to retire from the contest. He attempted to compete in the North America's Strongest Man Competition in 2007, but withdrew due to injury. Girard was able to bounce back in 2008, winning Quebec's Strongest Man. This win qualified Girard for the 2008 Canada's Strongest Man contest. Girard was leading the contest after the first day, but suffered yet another injury on the second day of competition and tearfully announced his retirement from strongman competition. Girard broke several records during his career, some of which are still standing today. He has held records in events such as the log press, apollon's axle press, crucifix hold, farmer's walk Atlas stones, bench press, truck pull and squat. He has also pulled an 80-ton Boeing 737 for a short distance. Due to his strength, Girard is often compared to fellow Quebec native Louis Cyr, a dominant nineteenth-century strongman who was considered the strongest man in history at the turn of the century. Girard has trained several other strongmen in the Ottawa and Gatineau regions, including Travis Lyndon and Jessen Paulin, who has participated in the World's Strongest Man competition and succeeded Girard as Canada's Strongest Man in 2005 and 2006. Girard is currently a member of the organization of the Gatineau Hot Air Balloon Festival that takes place every Labour Day weekend. He is also the current president of the Canadian Federation of Strength Athletes. In addition to his career as a strongman, Girard served as a police officer for 12 years. Girard was the subject of a documentary film called \\"Strongman: Hugo Girard\\" in 2002. The film shows Girard's training for the 2002 North America's Strongest Man competition, which he eventually won. The film also features his training partners Jessen Paulin and Travis Lyndon. The film was directed by Alan Black and released by Top of the World Films.

It is situated on the A52, and north from the resort of Skegness. Most housing is found in the west of the village in large council complexes. Close by to the west is the village of Addlethorpe. The village primary school is on Simpson Court.Ingoldmells Primary School There are fish and chip shops and bars near the beach. Ingoldmells is known as a holiday destination, with sites containing large numbers of caravans. The first Butlins holiday camp was in the village. History Church of SS Peter and Paul, Ingoldmells The parish church is a Grade I listed building dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul and dating from 1200. The chancel was demolished in 1706, and the church was restored in 1858 and 1892. The west tower dates from the 14th century, and the benches and font are 15th century. A war memorial in the churchyard is a Grade II listed former churchyard cross and sundial dating from 1600 and restored in 1919. The popularity of the seaside resort of Skegness attracted tourists from around the country, and a holiday camp, Butlin's, was built in 1936 in Ingoldmells, just on the border between Ingoldmells and Skegness. During the Second World War, RAF Ingoldmells was a Chain Home Low radar station, providing low- altitude short-range warning, with a rotating antenna. RAF Stenigot on the Lincolnshire Wolds provided longer-range warning for the area. RAF Skendleby was the other Chain Home Low station in Lincolnshire near Skendleby, Spilsby. On 11 April 2004, a double-decker bus operated by Lincolnshire RoadCar collided with a number of pedestrians outside the main entrance to Fantasy Island amusement park on Sea Lane in Ingoldmells. Five pedestrians were killed and six more injured, two critically, in the accident. Demographics In the 2011 census the population of Ingoldmells was 2,392 and is made up of approximately 50% females and 50% males. The average age of people in Ingoldmells is 46, while the median age is higher at 50. Notable Holiday Parks Billy Butlin opened the UK's first holiday camp at Ingoldmells in 1936, which today is a major employer in the area and attracts numerous tourists. During the Second World War the Butlin's camp was used as the site of HMS Royal Arthur, a Royal Navy shore establishment.\\"Butlins Memories\\", Butlinsmemories.com Fantasy Island is a large family Amusement Park in Ingoldmells that opened in 1995 and has since built up a variety of rides, attractions and entertainment.

The company was founded by Mercury Records engineer C. Robert (Bob) Fine, husband of producer Wilma Cozart Fine. As opposed to magnetic stereophonic soundtracks available at the time, Perspecta's benefits were that it did not require a new sound head for the projector and thus was a cheaper alternative. Introduced as a \\"directional sound system\\" rather than a true stereophonic sound system, Perspecta did not use discretely recorded sound signals. Instead, three sub-audible tones at 30 Hz, 35 Hz, and 40 Hz are mixed appropriately and embedded in a monaural optical soundtrack, in addition to the audible sound. When run through a Perspecta integrator, depending on whenever each tone is present, the audio is fed into a left (30 Hz), center (35 Hz) and right (40 Hz) speaker. Unlike true stereophonic sound, which would be described as discrete tracks running in synchronization in time and phase, Perspecta merely panned a mono mix across various channels. Because of this, only isolated dialogue or sound effects could be mixed to be directional. Mixed sound effects, dialogue and music could not be suitably mixed. Aside from panning, Perspecta controlled gain levels for each channel through the amplitude of each control signal. MGM Studios and Paramount Pictures were major supporters and developers of Perspecta. MGM used it on nearly everything that they released between mid-1954 to approximately 1958, including shorts, cartoons and trailers. Paramount used it, uncredited, on all their VistaVision pictures until it fell out of favor around 1958. In theory, the \\"High Fidelity\\" in VistaVision's trademark strongly implied high-fidelity sound, but, in reality, the system provided only higher-fidelity visual image, not higher-fidelity sound. Universal-International, Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures, United Artists, and Toho were among some of the other major studios to utilize Perspecta regularly.

In North America, it is sometimes referred to by the common name red-capped scaber stalk. Some uncertainties exist regarding the taxonomic classification of this species in Europe and North America. It is considered edible. Description The cap is orange-red and measures across. Its flesh is white, bruising at first burgundy, then grayish or purple-black. The underside of the cap has very small, whitish pores that bruise olive- brown. The stem measures tall and thick and can bruise blue-green. It is whitish, with short, rigid projections or scabers that turn to brown to black with age. Distribution and habitat L. aurantiacum can be found fruiting during summer and autumn in forests throughout Europe and North America. The association between fungus and host tree is mycorrhizal. In Europe, it has traditionally been associated with poplar trees. Some debate exists about the classification of L. aurantiacum and L. quercinum as separate species. According to authors who do not recognise the distinction, L. aurantiacum is also found among oak trees. Additionally, L. aurantiacum has been recorded with various other deciduous trees, including beech, birch, chestnut, willow, and trees of the genus Tilia. L. aurantiacum is not known to associate with conifers in Europe. North American populations have been recorded in coniferous and deciduous forests, though whether collections from coniferous forests are not L. vulpinum, instead, remains uncertain. In addition, L. aurantiacum may be absent altogether from North America, with collections from deciduous forests being attributed to other North American species L. insigne, and L. brunneum. Edibility This is a favorite species for eating and can be prepared as other edible boletes. Its flesh turns very dark on cooking. Like most members of the Boletaceae, these mushrooms are targeted by maggots. Due to a number of poisonings and the difficulty identifying species, Leccinum species are considered by some as possibly not safe to eat. This species also needs to be cooked well (not parboiled) or else it may cause vomiting or other negative effects. This species can cause problems with digestion if not cooked properly. Similar species In Europe, several orange-red capped species exist, which differ mainly in habitat. L. albostipitatum grows with aspen and has white scales on the stipe. In coniferous forests, L. vulpinum occurs around pine and spruce trees. Not all authors recognise these as distinct species. In North America, L. insigne grows in aspen or birch stands, while L. atrostipitatum grows in birch stands. Both are edible.

It is his best- known work, and was for some years the only piece by which the composer was known to many concert-goers. The work was inspired by a visit Bax made to Tintagel Castle in Cornwall in 1917, and, although not explicitly programmatic, draws on the history and mythology associated with the castle. History During the late summer of 1917 Bax, together with the pianist Harriet Cohen, with whom he was having a passionate love affair, spent six weeks in Cornwall. They visited Tintagel Castle which inspired the composer to write a symphonic poem. The piece was fully sketched during October 1917 and orchestrated between then and January 1919. It is dedicated to Cohen.Foreman, p. 150 In a programme note written in 1922 Bax stated that the piece is \\"only in the broadest sense programme music\\". He aimed, he said, to offer an impression of the cliffs and castle of Tintagel and the sea \\"on a sunny but not windless summer day\\", and to reflect some of the literary and traditional associations of the scene. Tintagel was premiered in Bournemouth on 20 October 1921 by the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra conducted by Dan Godfrey. The Musical Times reported: Structure In Bax's published analysis: At this point, Bax writes, he sought to convey a sense of stress and to conjure up the dramatic legends of King Arthur and King Mark. \\"A wailing chromatic figure is heard and gradually dominates the music\\", at which point Bax quotes a theme from Wagner's Tristan and Isolde (a work set in and off the coast of Cornwall). There follows what Bax called \\"a great climax suddenly subsiding\\", which is followed by a passage intended to convey the impression of \\"immense waves slowly gathering force until they smash themselves upon the impregnable rocks\\". The theme of the sea is repeated, and the work ends with the return of the opening image of \\"the castle still proudly fronting the sun and wind of centuries\\". Recordings When Bax's music underwent a decade and more of neglect after his death in 1953, Tintagel was alone among his works in retaining a firm place in the repertoire.Foreman, Lewis. \\"Bax, Sir Arnold\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, retrieved 7 October 2015 By 2014 the work had received fifteen recordings.Parlett, Graham. \\"Discography\\", The Sir Arnold Bax Website, retrieved 8 October 2015 The earliest was made for HMV in 1928, with New Symphony Orchestra conducted by Eugene Goossens; it was the only recording made during the composer's lifetime, and, at 2015, is by some way the fastest performance on record, playing for 12 minutes 10 seconds.Notes to reissue on Dutton CD CDBP 9779, OCLC 172986239 In the view of The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music the benchmark recording is that by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir John Barbirolli, first issued in 1967.March et al, p. 80 That recording plays for 15 minutes.Notes to EMI CD 0094637998359, OCLC 858233401 Notes References * Webber, Christopher: TINTAGEL on Record, A Survey (2007) Category:1919 compositions Category:Arthurian music Category:Compositions by Arnold Bax Category:Symphonic poems Category:Tintagel ","title":"Tintagel (Bax)"},{"id":"7745574","text":"Bliss, in comics, may refer to: * Bliss (Marvel Comics), a member of the Marvel Comics mutant group The Morlocks * Bliss (DC Comics), an incubus who appeared in the DC Comics series Starman * Bliss (Wildstorm), a Wildstorm comic book character * Bliss, a syndicated newspaper comic by Harry Bliss See also *Bliss (disambiguation) ","title":"Bliss (comics)"},{"id":"7745579","text":"Ambia may refer to : ;Places and jurisdictions in Africa * Ambia (Mauretania), an Ancient former bishopric and present Latin Catholic titular see * Ambia, Ihosy, Madagascar, a town * Ambia, Mahabo, Madagascar, a town ;Places and jurisdictions elsewhere * Ambia, Indiana, United States, a town * Ambia, Texas, an unincorporated community * Amb√≠a River, a tributary of the Arnoia River, Galicia (Spain) ;Other * Ambia (moth), a genus of moths ","title":"Ambia"},{"id":"7745587","text":"The Treaty of Lieben was signed on June 25, 1608 between Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II and his brother, Matthias.

History \\"One Mint Julep\\" was recorded on the Atlantic Records label in New York City on December 19, 1951, and released in March 1952. It was one of the first \\"drinking songs\\" to become a hit and one of the first to feature a tenor saxophone solo. It was an important step in the history of Ahmet Ertegun and Atlantic Records in its quest to become a hot rhythm and blues label. Stylistically, the Clovers were moving away from the sentimental lyrics of the romantic doo-wop group songs and adapting a cooler group style, emphasizing rhythm more, nearing the style of a jump blues combo. Toombs had been hired by the Atlantic Records label to write and compose humorous up-tempo rhythm and blues novelty songs. Atlantic wanted material that was true to life, but also funny. The humor in this song comes in part from the idea of a young black man getting drunk on mint juleps, traditionally thought of as an aristocratic southern white woman's drink. The Atlantic B-side was \\"Middle of the Night\\" by \\"Nugetre\\", Ertegun spelled backwards. Lyrics content The story line is a classic one of a man who falls for the charms of a young woman only to realize a few years later that he has a ring on his finger. He remembers that it all started with \\"One Mint Julep.\\" ::\\"One early morning as I was walking,\\" ::\\"I met a woman, we started talking,\\" The last verse outlines the trap. ::\\"I don't want to bore you, with my trouble,\\" ::\\"But from now on I'll be thinking double.\\" Drinking songs This is one of many popular R&B; drinking songs to come out of the 1940s and 1950s. It was the first of several successful up-tempo drinking songs by Toombs, who went on to write and compose \\"One Scotch, One Bourbon, One Beer\\" for Amos Milburn, \\"Fat Back and Corn Likker\\" for Louis Jordan, and \\"Nip Sip\\" for the Clovers. Key recordings In 1961 \\"One Mint Julep\\" finally reached a mass audience when Ray Charles's organ-and-big-band instrumental version reached No. 1 on the R&B; charts, and also reached No. 8 on the pop chart.

Stone (31.2%), the Chairman/CEO of Kapstone Paper & Packaging Company in Northbrook, Illinois, as licensee LRS Radio, LLC. The station's studios are located in Water Mill, New York and shared by WBEA and WEHM/WEHN. WBAZ's transmitter is located in Southampton, New York. History Amagansett studios The 102.5 frequency first signed on in April 1996 as WLIE, with a satellite-fed country music format. Put on the air by WBAZ-owner Mel Kahn and his MAK Communications, less than a year later, the country format was replaced with classic rock. In early 1998, the 102.5 frequency changed again as it took on new calls, WBSQ, and a new Hot Adult Contemporary format (again satellite-fed) as Q-(Bright)102.5. Launched as a complement to WBAZ at 101.7 FM, and not much else, the station remained an afterthought in the scheme of East End radio. When Kahn sold WBAZ and WBSQ to AAA Entertainment, owner of locally-run rival WBEA at 104.7 FM in 2000, the future of WBSQ's Hot AC format was limited. Studies by AAA showed that the majority of WBAZ's listeners were concentrated in the Southampton/Bridgehampton area and that the slightly worse 102.5 FM signal would be ideal for the station. In April 2001, WBSQ took the WCSO calls used by AAA as placeholders and would simulcast and assume WBAZ's format and calls that May. The 101.7 frequency soon became home to WBEA whereas WBEA's former home at 104.7 FM became home to a classic hits station targeted to New London, Connecticut. In 2005, WBAZ, WBEA, and sister stations WEHM and WHBE would be purchased by Long Island Radio Broadcasting, a unit of Cherry Creek Radio.

In 1957 it was moved to its present site. It is remembered in Durham as the Harriet Cooper Lane House after a long-term former occupant. This house displays the center-chimney, two-room deep plan typical of mid-18th-century hose construction. In its well-preserved condition it complements the Nehemiah Hubbard House across the street.

It is approximately 15 kilometers south of Kincardine and 40 kilometers north of Goderich. Main streets include Huron Road and Lake Range Road. Point Clark is served by Highway 21 (Ontario). It is a cottage town, and has a rare Imperial Tower style lighthouse. There is a sandy beach and a small harbour with a boat ramp. There are two streams or rivers that run into Lake Huron around Point Clark: Clark Creek and Pine River. There is a separate harbour in the mouth of the Pine River. Amberley is just outside and to the south of Point Clark and Lucknow is to the south-east of Point Clark. This lighthouse of one of six Imperial Towers built in the 1850s on Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. They were built at a time when commercial shipping traffic was increasing on the Great Lakes between Canada and the U.S. because of new trade agreements and the opening of the Sault Ste. Marie Canal locks in 1855. The Bruce Peninsula was also open to settlement by 1850, making the lighthouses timely. All were made of cut limestone and granite, not of brick, metal, wood or concrete as most others were on the Great Lakes. The Point Clark Lighthouse was formally registered as one of the National Historic Sites of Canada on 25 May 1966. It is the only lighthouse on the Great Lakes and Georgian Bay to receive that highest level of merit. The light keeper's house is a Recognized Federal Heritage Building, a place of historic interest (14 July 1994). Both can be toured by the public. History In 1850, Point Clark was originally called The Point and the Post Office was called Pine River. Later, the area was known as Pine Point as a lantern was hung from a pine tree to warn sailors of the shoal off the point, prior to the building of the lighthouse.] After settlers moved in from Clark Township, Huron County, the area was known as \\"Clark's Point\\". Later, the town received the name it bears today‚ÄîPoint Clark.' At the end of 1853, six municipalities were formed in the new township of Huron. Capt. Henry C. Gamble, an Irish man arrived in 1856 to visit to his brother, J. W. Gamble. He decided to remain and to develop the area into a business centre. He bought land near the mouth of the river and built a saw and grist mill. At the time, the neighborhood was called \\"The Point.\\" Capt. Gamble did not succeed with his plan to develop the area and returned to Ireland. The government arranged for the building of the Point Clark Lighthouse between 1855 and 1859, during the building of the Imperial Towers; many referred to it as the Pine Point light. The tower and keeper's home were extensively restored between 2011 and 2014 and reopened to the public in 2015. The museum in the keeper's home and an outbuilding provides a glimpse into the life of light keepers of the past. Since the lighthouse is on the mainland (not on an island) it can easily reached by vehicle. The entire facility including the tower, operated by the Township of Huron-Kinloss, can be toured from mid June to Labour Day for a fee.

As an officer in the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers he specialized in mapping the United States border, including the Texas‚ÄìMexico border, and the Gadsden Purchase border, 1844‚Äì1855, and published lasting scientific reports on the border region. Early life and early career Emory's 1844 Map of Texas and the Countries Adjacent Emory was born in Queen Anne's County, Maryland, on his family's \\"Poplar Grove\\" estate. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and graduated in 1831. Assigned as a second lieutenant, he served in the Fourth Artillery until he resigned from the service in 1836 to pursue civil engineering, but he returned to the service in 1838 as lieutenant in the newly formed Corps of Topographical Engineers. William H. Emory was most importantly a topographical engineer and explorer. From 1839 to 1842, he surveyed harbors and the Delaware River. In 1844, Emory served in an expedition that produced a new map of Texan claims westward to the Rio Grande, which brought him national attention as the war with Mexico seemed imminent. He next conducted a boundary survey of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border (1844‚Äì1846). His mapmaking skills were so superb and detailed with such great accuracy that he often made other maps obsolete, thus making him the authority of the trans-Mississippi west. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and Gadsden Purchase At the start of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Emory was selected to join General Stephen Watts Kearny and the Army of the West to take New Mexico and California. Along the way he kept a detailed journal of the march down the Rio Grande and across to the Gila River, and down it to its mouth on the Colorado River, then to the Pacific coast. Published by the Thirtieth United States Congress in 1848 as Notes of a Military Reconnaissance from Fort Leavenworth to San Diego, it became an important guide book for the road to Southern California. This report described terrain and rivers, cities and forts and made observations about Native Americans and Mexicans, primarily in the future New Mexico Territory, Arizona Territory and Southern California. It was and is considered one of the important chronicles and descriptions of the historic Southwest, particularly noted for its maps. Emory was a reliable and conscientious cartographer. After the War, Emory was sent with a crew to survey the new United States-Mexico boundary, first from the mouth of the Gila across California to the coast and then second, with the Bartlett survey from El Paso west, 1849‚Äì1853. A dispute arose among the Mexicans and Americans over the location of the starting line near El Paso caused by an error in the original map referred to in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848). A compromise by John Bartlett brought an international incident when neither side agreed to the boundary and threatened renewed hostilities in the Mesilla Valley above El Paso. A compromise was reached with the Gadsden Purchase of 1854, and Emory was selected to lead the American boundary commission to survey, 1855‚Äì1856, the new boundary line (earlier he had influenced the debate over approving the treaty by advising Senator Thomas Jefferson Rusk of Texas on the best route for a southern transcontinental railroad, one of the key points of the Gadsden Treaty). There is a story of testament as to Emory's dedication to accuracy that says John Bartlett, his supervisor in the boundary survey, made him sign off on a misplaced boundary marker, creating a sweet revenge for Emory who replaced him as Head of the International Boundary Commission in 1855. But William H. Emory did more than just map the terrain; he also made notes about the plant life as well as the people who inhabited the sparsely populated Southwest. Notating the social relations of some of the Native American people, he wrote: \\"Women, when captured, are taken as wives by those who capture them, but they are treated by the Indian wives of the capturers as slaves, and made to carry wood and water; if they chance to be pretty, or receive too much attention from their lords and masters, they are, in the absence of the latter, unmercifully beaten and otherwise maltreated. The most unfortunate thing which can befall a captive woman is to be claimed by two persons. In this case, she is either shot or delivered up for indiscriminate violence.\\"[2] His multi-volume boundary survey published as the Report of the United States and Mexican Boundary Commission, Made Under the Direction of the Secretary of the Interior, 2 vols (Washington, GPO, 1857‚Äì1859, reprint Austin:Texas Historical Association, 1987) was not only a contribution to understanding the geography of the region but was a long- standing scientific contribution to the natural history of the region. American Civil War In 1861, when the American Civil War broke out, Emory was stationed in the Indian Territory.Anticipating the possible capture of his troops by Confederates, he secured the services of Black Beaver, a famous Lenape warrior, to guide Emory's troops to safety. He promised that the government would compensate Black Beaver for the loss of his ranch. Emory withdrew Union troops from Fort Washita to Fort Leavenworth. During the withdrawal, Black Beaver scouted pursuing enemy troops, and Emory attacked and captured lead elements of his pursuers, the first prisoners captured during the Civil War.A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans, written and compiled by William E. Connelley, transcribed by Carolyn Ward, 1998. skyways.lib.ks.us accessed 12 March 2011. At the onset of the Civil War, Emory was concerned for his family and wrote a letter of resignation on May 9, 1861. He immediately regretted his decision and tried to prevent the delivery of the letter but was unable to do so. In spite of his resignation letter, he was informally commissioned as major general of the 3rd, later 6th, Calvary. However, an official review was required that included testimony on his behalf from General Winfield Scott and Lieutenant A. V. Colburn, as well as Emory's own testimony to Secretary of War and the Senate before his resignation was formally rescinded and his rank was officially confirmed. Emory served as a brigade commander in the Army of the Potomac in 1862, and was transferred to the Western Theater. He was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on March 17, 1862. He later commanded a division in the Port Hudson campaign. He subsequently returned to the East as the commander of the Nineteenth Corps, serving in all the major battles in the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1864, especially at the Battle of Cedar Creek, where Emory's actions helped save the Union army from a devastating defeat until Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's arrival. At the end of the war, Emory held the rank of colonel in the regular army and a brevet (honorary promotion) as major general. He was promoted to major general in the volunteers on September 25, 1865 and was mustered out of the volunteers on January 15, 1866. =Postbellum= After the war, Emory held a number of posts, most importantly commander of the Department of the Gulf (which included the Federal troops in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi)‚Äìa demanding and dangerous Reconstruction assignment. In September 1874, President Ulysses S. Grant ordered Emory to New Orleans, where he successfully negotiated a peace with the conservative White League who had taken over the city by military force. As a result, Republican Governor Kellogg was restored to power and the White League disbanded. For political reasons, General Sheridan removed Emory from command and saw to it that he was retired in 1876. The Department of the Gulf was soon shifted to Sheridan's large Division of the Missouri, which included Texas. He was a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. In 1879 he became a Veteran Member of the Aztec Club of 1847. Marriage and family Emory married Matilda Wilkins Bache on May 29, 1838, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bache was the daughter of Richard Bache Jr. and Sophia Burrell Dallas. She was a granddaughter of Sarah Franklin Bache and Richard Bache, and a great- granddaughter of Benjamin Franklin, as well as a niece of George Mifflin Dallas, the 11th Vice President of the United States, serving under James K. Polk. Emory and his wife had a total of 10 children. His eldest son, Brevet Lieut. Colonel Campbell Dallas Emory, 9th United States Infantry, was Aide de Camp to Major General George G. Meade during the Civil War, and a younger son, William H. Emory Jr., was a rear admiral in the United States Navy. Death Emory died December 1, 1887, in Washington, D.C. He is buried in the Congressional Cemetery there.House Divided Legacy While attending the United States Military Academy at West Point, he earned the nickname \\"Bold Emory\\". Emory Pass, 8,228 feet, in the Black Range of southwest New Mexico was named for him. Emory Peak (7,825 ft) in Big Bend National Park is named for him. Fort Emory was named for him in 1942. It is now used as a training area for Special Forces. In 1853, Baird and Girard named the Great Plains rat snake, Pantherophis emoryi, for Emory.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Emory\\", pp. 83‚Äì84). The first specimens of this snake species were collected by John H. Clark and Arthur Schott at Howard Springs, Texas, under Emory's leadership during the United States and Mexican Boundary Survey. Emory is also commemorated in the scientific name of the Texas spiny softshell turtle, Apalone spinifera emoryi, Emory's crucifixation thorn (Castela emoryi) of the Simaroubaceae family, the cacti Grusonia emoryi and Bergerocactus emoryi, as well as the genus Emorya in the Buddleja tribe of the plant family Scrophulariaceae. Emory Elementary School in San Diego bears his namesake, and is located north of the border which he determined between the United States and Mexico from the Colorado River to San Diego/Tijuana, near the border's western end. The astronauts of Apollo 17 named a small crater after him. Publications * Buttery, L. M., Robert Lenon, and William H. Emory. \\"The Emory Maps of 1847 & 1857\\".

It occurs wild mainly in northern North America and adjacent northeastern Siberia. However, as it escaped often from gardens it can be found worldwide in areas with temperate to warm climates, and is considered a weed in many countries. The species is a polyploid and originated via hybridization of an East Asian Hordeum species with a close but extinct relative of Californian H. brachyantherum. It is grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive inflorescences and when done flowering for its infructescence. Properties Foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum) propagates by seed. It is known for its ability to tolerate saline soils but is capable of productive growth on soil types ranging from loamy to clayey soils with pH's of 6.4 to 9.5. The upper limit of soil NaCl for productive growth and development is 1.0%. Foxtail barley is also adapted to a wide range of moisture regimes from dry to wet. Although this species is generally found on moist sites, it can withstand drought-like conditions. It is commonly found in lowland areas with restricted soil drainage, disturbed sites, waste areas and fields. Foxtail barley is a pioneer species or invader in disturbed areas and in areas with high salinity. It is among the first grasses to establish after disturbance and rapidly invades areas exposed by a receding water table. Seedling Foxtail barley is a prolific seed producer, with each plant capable of producing upwards of 200 seeds. Seeds are elliptical, yellowish- brown and about a long with four to eight awns. The seeds have sharp, backwards pointing barbs. Seed is dispersed by wind, machinery and animals and germinates in the cooler temperatures of the spring or fall. Seed germinating in the fall can overwinter and resume growth in early spring, giving Foxtail barley a competitive advantage over many crops. Germination is inhibited by warm temperatures and seeds require a period of darkness for germination to occur. Foxtail barley is a shallow-rooted plant with germination occurring at soil depths not greater than . The seedling of foxtail barley first appears as thin, vertical leaves covered in short, dense hairs. The leaves have prominent venation and rough margins, while auricles are absent or elemental and the membranous ligule is very short with fine hairs. Juvenile/mature Foxtail barley is a fibrous-rooted, densely tufted grass that grows from tall and is erect or reclining at the base. The stems are erect and smooth and the leaf sheaths are split and hairy. The inflorescence of the mature plant is a dense, long-awned nodding spike with greenish or purplish colouring. The jointed rachis breaks into sharply pointed segments with three spikelets composing each segment. Only the central spikelet has one creamy coloured seed while each segment has seven awns with upward pointing barbs. These awns are up to long and become easily attached to animals, clothing, machinery, etc. Leaf blades are slender and a greyish-green colour. Ecological impact Foxtail barley is distinguished from cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and Meadow barley (Hordeum brachyantherum) by lemma awn length. H. brachyantherum has awn lengths of ; Foxtail barley has lengths of ; and cultivated barley of in length. Once foxtail barley is established, it becomes extremely difficult to eradicate. Its extensive root systems and aggressive habit, as well as its ability to tolerate saline soils make it a resilient competitor. It is considered a weed because of this competitive ability and the dangers it poses to wildlife and livestock. While foxtail barley may be palatable for animals in early spring before it flowers, its seed heads, when dry, are very harmful to grazing animals. The awns can harm animals, as their upward-pointing barbs become easily attached and embedded in the animal's mouth and face, causing severe irritation, abscesses, and even blindness. In horses in can cause painful ulcers and excessive salivation resulting in eating difficulties. Foxtail barley is also host to a number of viruses, and because it harbours wheat rust and blackstem rust, can indirectly affect the development of field crops. Since foxtail barley accumulates high amounts of salt in its leaves and roots, it has the potential of reducing soil salinity. Given foxtail barley's ability to withstand saline soils, it has been identified as having potential for the revegetation of saline mine spoils to reduce erosion. It has also been recommended as a species suitable for wildlife habitat rehabilitation on disturbed lands, but given its other less desirable traits, other natural grass species would be more beneficial. Ethnobotanical uses Foxtail barley has been recorded as having varied uses among Native North American societies. The Chippewa and Potawatomi used the root as medicine; the Kawaiisu pounded and ate the seeds dry, or used the plant as a tool to rub the skin off yucca stalks. noted Iroquois children placing the dried seed heads in the sleeves of others as a prank. The Ramah Navajo considered the plant poisonous and avoided it.

He appeared in Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the Boston Red Sox (1941‚Äì1945) and Philadelphia Phillies (1945‚Äì1948). Judd was primarily used as a starting pitcher during his eight-season career. He made his major league debut in relief on April 16, 1941 against the Washington Senators at Fenway Park. He pitched in just six more games for Boston that year but did earn his first big league save. His first major league win came in his second season and second major league start, a 13‚Äì4 victory over the Senators at Griffith Stadium on April 22, 1942. The losing pitcher was Hall of Famer Early Wynn. Judd finished the season 8‚Äì10 with a 3.89 earned run average. Judd's best season was 1943. The 36-year-old was 11‚Äì6 with a 2.90 ERA and was an American League All-Star. Two years later, on May 31, 1945 he was selected off waivers by the Philadelphia Phillies from the Red Sox. His overall record for Boston in five seasons was 20‚Äì18 with an ERA of 3.68 in 72 games. His best season with Philadelphia was 1946, when he won 11 games, lost 12, and hit .316 for a mediocre Phillies team that finished in fifth place with a 69‚Äì85 record. He finished in a tie for 36th place in the National League MVP voting. Judd was 40 years old when he made his final major league appearance on May 11, 1948. He was the sixth-oldest player to appear in a National League game that season. Career totals for 206 games (161 as a pitcher) include a 40‚Äì51 record, 99 games started, 43 complete games, 4 shutouts, 32 games finished, and 7 saves. He allowed 334 earned runs in 771.1 innings pitched for an ERA of 3.90. As a hitter he was well above average for a pitcher, and was used 42 times as a pinch hitter. His lifetime batting average was .262 (83-for-317) with 3 home runs, 19 runs batted in, a .322 on- base percentage, and a slugging average of .356. He only grounded into two double plays during his entire career. Judd finished in his league's top ten five times for wild pitches, leading the National League with 8 in 1947. Judd died at the age of 87 in Ingersoll, Ontario. Judd was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, in St. Marys, Ontario, in 1986.

Background In 1946, the Juilliard School of Music requested from Moore a chamber piece to be performed at a school concert the following year. He worked at and finished the piece during the summer of 1946 at his home in Cutchogue. The premiere was given the following year. Structure and Analysis The work is in traditional sonata form and consists of four movements #Allegro risoluto #Andante comodo #Adagio recitativo #Allegro ritmico The first movement is the most dynamic and is chiefly dominated by a tensely rhythmic figure achieved by a triplet laid over a duplet. This duality of rhythm becomes most obvious when the two components are handled by different instruments, but the combination and tension that is achieved gives this movement its impetus The second movement is considerably relaxed in mood and is introduced by a melodic figure on violin which becomes the contrapuntal background to the main theme, first given by clarinet. The theme subsequently continues throughout the piece. The third movement is the shortest movement of the quintet, it commences with a brooding soliloquy on clarinet accompanied by the viola which is the picked up by the remaining strings and is allowed to fade out. The finale consists of a robust, dancing and peasant-like refrain of shifting rhythm which alternates in the fashion of a rondo with contrasting material. It is the quintet's most joyful movement. Reception The clarinet quintet was quite favourably received upon its first performance and the New York Herald Tribune praised its: \\"Spontaneous lyricism, expert craftmanship and utter freedom from stylistic mannerisms\\". It is Moore's most famous and popular chamber piece and has received (as of 2006) at least two commercial recordings.

It was adapted into a children's television series of the same title, produced for the ITV network by TVS, aired between 1988 and 1990, and starring Stanley Baxter as Mr Majeika. The stories have also been broadcast on radio. The first volume, Mr Majeika, first published in 1984, was followed by Mr Majeika and the Music Teacher, Mr Majeika and the Haunted Hotel and The TV Adventures of Mr Majeika.  Plot  The focus of these stories is Mr Majeika, a teacher at St Barty's Primary School, a typical English primary school. However he is no ordinary man, as is apparent when he flies into Class Three's boring lesson on a magic carpet, which he then turns into a bicycle, confounding the headmaster; Mr Majeika is a wizard! He thereafter astounds them with magical trickery which bring lessons to life, whether it is providing chips during dinner for all the children, or turning the nasty Hamish Bigmore into a frog for his insolence. Whatever the consequences, Class Three are sure that with Mr Majeika around, they will not be bored again. A recurring character is Wilhelmina Worlock, a witch who first appeared as a music teacher and has turned up regularly since in various disguises. In the television series, Mr Majeika is an irrepressible wizard, sent to \\"Britland\\" from the planet Walpurgis because he had failed his O-level sorcery exam for the seventeenth time. He drops into the sleepy village of Much Barty, finding a post at St Barty's School as Class Three's new form-teacher, where he quickly befriends two of the children, Melanie Brace-Girdle and Thomas Grey. Both of these characters are also in the books, but Melanie is a much less important and very different type of character in the books, and is replaced by another character as female lead, Jody. Also in the books, Thomas has a twin brother called Pete. Majeika enters into his magic with reluctance, however, because he is trying hard to behave himself on Earth, and because the Worshipful Wizard of Walpurgis is keeping an eye on him from above. All the same, trickery becomes more and more necessary, leading Majeika, Melanie and Thomas into some remarkable adventures. Their fun is despised, but usually prompted, by the horribly spoilt Hamish, a pupil so ghastly that his mere presence caused the resignation of the previous class teacher and frightened off the 79 applicants for the post. But one waggle of Mr Majeika's oddly tufted grey hair is all that it takes for Bigmore to be put firmly in his place.  Books in the series  TV show The series was written by Jenny McDade. Carpenter wrote the fourth book based on McDade's scripts, The Television Adventures of Mr Majeika. Three series of the programme were made, comprising twenty episodes in total. The location for St. Barty's Primary School was Matfield House in Tonbridge, Kent. =Cast= *Stanley Baxter as Mr. Majeika *Roland MacLeod as Dudley Potter *Fidelis Morgan as Bunty Brace-Girdle *Eve Ferret as Pam Bigmore *Claire Sawyer as Melanie Brace-Girdle *Miriam Margolyes as Wilhermina Warlock *Simeon Pearl as Hamish Bigmore *Richard Murdoch as Worshipful Wizard *Andrew Read as Thomas Grey *Adele Silva as Fenella Fudd *Christopher Mitchell as Ron Bigmore *Sanjiv Madan as Prince *Pat Coombs as Miss Flavia Jelley *Vernon Dobtcheff as Wizard Marks *Robin Driscoll as Sgt. Sevenoaks =Availability= There has been no commercial release of Mr Majeika on DVD in the UK. This is possibly due to ongoing rights issues after the production company, TVS, dropped out of the ITV network in 1992 and subsequently went through a number of take-overs. This problem affects the majority of the TVS programme archive as much of the original production paperwork and sales documentation has been lost during the intervening years. According to Kaleidoscope's TV Brain website, nine episodes of the series no longer exist in broadcast quality, although all but one of these is available on YouTube.TV Brain website References External links * Category:1984 children's books Category:British children's novels Category:British fantasy novel series Category:Novels adapted into television shows Category:Novels set in England Category:Novels set in schools Category:Series of children's books Category:Witchcraft in written fiction ","title":"Mr Majeika"},{"id":"7745921","title":"My Funny Friend and Me"},{"id":"7745937","text":"Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, circa 1875; portrait by Charles Reutlinger The Capriccio Italien, Op. 45, is a fantasy for orchestra composed between January and May 1880 by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. A typical performance of the piece lasts about 15 minutes. Background The Capriccio was inspired by a trip Tchaikovsky took to Rome with his brother Modest as respite from the composer's disastrous marriage with Antonina Miliukova. It was in Rome, however, that the observant Tchaikovsky called Raphael a \\"Mozart of painting.\\" While in Rome, he wrote to his friend Nadezhda von Meck: > I have already completed the sketches for an Italian fantasia on folk tunes > for which I believe a good fortune may be predicted. It will be effective, > thanks to the delightful tunes which I have succeeded in assembling partly > from anthologies, partly from my own ears in the streets. Conductor JoAnn Falletta says: > We are hearing foreigners' views of Italy. . . . [however,] Capriccio > Italien has great power, even though it's practically a pops piece, > Tchaikovsky knows what the instruments can do in a virtuoso way. He brings > them to their limit in the most thrilling fashion. He has a gift for mixing > families of instruments just right ‚Äì like cantabile strings along with > mighty brass. I hear the ballet element in everything Tchaikovsky writes, in > his sense of rhythm. You can practically dance to both these scores! The piece, initially called Italian Fantasia after Mikhail Glinka's Spanish pieces, was originally dedicated to the virtuosic cellist Karl Davydov and premiered in Moscow on 18 December 1880, with Nikolai Rubinstein conducting the Imperial Russian Musical Society. Structure The Capriccio is scored for: 3 flutes (3rd doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 2 cornets in A, 2 trumpets in E, 3 trombones (2 tenor, 1 bass), tuba, 3 timpani, triangle, tambourine, cymbals, bass drum, glockenspiel, harp and strings. After a brief bugle call, inspired by a bugle call Tchaikovsky heard daily in his rooms at the Hotel Constanzi, next door to the barracks of the Royal Italian Cuirasseurs, a stoic, heroic, unsmiling melody is played by the strings. Eventually, this gives way to music sounding as if it could be played by an Italian street band, beginning in the winds and ending with the whole orchestra. Next, a lively march ensues, followed by a lively tarantella, a Cicuzza. The brothers were there during Carnival, and, despite calling it \\"a folly,\\" the composer was able to soak up Italian street music and folk songs which he then incorporated into his Capriccio. This enables some \\"bright primary colors and uncomplicated tunefulness.\\" References Sources *Brown, David. Tchaikovsky: The Years of Wandering, 1878‚Äì85.

The writer prints out the piece, rereads and makes edits, then retypes the entire text (except for block quotes, which can be pasted from a previous draft). The technique eliminates the incoherence resulting from cutting and pasting, and it compels the writer to reread, revise, and even eliminate prose that no longer works.

Adducci (August 14, 1937 ‚Äì September 19, 2006) was a pioneer of the medical device industry in Minnesota. He is best known for co-founding Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc., the company that manufactured the world's first lithium battery powered artificial pacemaker. The lithium-iodide cell is now the standard cell for pacemakers, having the energy density, low self-discharge, small size and reliability needed. Early life and education Adducci was born in Chicago, Illinois on August 14, 1937. In 1951, he graduated from St. Catherine of Genoa Grammar School, in the Roseland neighborhood of Chicago. He attended Saint Mary's University of Minnesota receiving the BS Physics in 1959. He pursued additional study in electrical engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology and in business administration at the University of Minnesota. Career In 1960, Adducci was employed as an acoustical engineer for the Jensen Manufacturing Company in Chicago, Illinois where he engaged in the design and development of loudspeakers and horns. In 1961, he joined International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation in Chicago Illinois where, as a development engineer, he instructed numerous training courses on digital data communication systems and as a senior test engineer directed ITT personnel in electro-interference testing of the Boeing Minuteman (missile) for the Strategic Air Command. He also taught hi-level courses to the United States Air Force in Biloxi, Mississippi. While in Chicago in 1963, Adducci worked with a local physician and developed an electronic ear thermometer used to detect the time of ovulation in the human female. He developed a little earplug and a recording device that would measure the tympanic temperature and got his wife, who was a nurse, to measure her temperatures, and they were able to predict ovulations. They published a paper in an IEEE journal (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) biomedical area. In August 1964, he accepted a position with the Sperry Rand Corporation's UNIVAC Division in St. Paul, Minnesota as a system design engineer engaged in the logic design of computer peripheral equipment. In April 1966, he joined Medtronic as a Sales Engineer. Adducci was the ninetieth employee at the time. While at Medtronic he served in various technical and marketing responsibilities including, sales administration manager, and pacemaker consulting specialist. He taught surgeons around the United States in the basics of how pacemakers work, the physiology of the cardiovascular system and the instructions to insert the pacemaker into the body. Adducci was involved in over fifty surgeries while at Medtronic. In February 1972, he co-founded Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc.(CPI) of St. Paul, Minnesota. CPI was a highly successful start up venture, going from zero sales in 1972 to over $47 million and highly profitable when it was acquired by Eli Lilly and Company in 1978 for $127 million. CPI Founding Partners; Manny Villafa√±a, Art Schwalm, Anthony Adducci, James Baustert In August 1998 he became the Commander of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office Community Service Posse in Arizona.

Based for five decades at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Paulu was the author of five books and dozens of articles on radio and television in Great Britain and on the continent of Europe. His work introduced American scholars and the interested public to broadcasting systems in Eastern and Western European countries where the role of the government and of advertising contrasted sharply with US practices. He taught and lectured widely in the US and Europe and held three appointments in the journalism department of Moscow State University, the first at a time when academic contacts between the US and the then - Soviet Union were rare and the last, when he was 81 years old, as the Soviet Union was collapsing. Paulu became manager of University of Minnesota radio station KUOM in 1928, in the early years of broadcasting, and participated in the development of public radio and television in the US, presiding as the University of Minnesota expanded its broadcasting activities to include short-lived innovations such as the use of closed circuit television to teach college courses and permanent changes to the American broadcasting landscape such as the introduction of educational television to the general public. He taught classes on American and international broadcasting until he retired with the title of professor and director of the University's Media Resources Department in 1978. Born in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, and raised in small towns in South Dakota, Paulu developed an early interest in classical music as a result of hearing the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra perform when he was a boy. His broadcasting career began in 1929, when he was working toward a degree in music at the University of Minnesota and took a part-time job as a student announcer at the university's young radio station WLB (later KUOM). He earned a BA (1931) and BS (1932) in music along with an MA degree in history from the University of Minnesota. While stationed in London and Luxembourg with the United States Office of War Information during World War II he developed an interest in European broadcasting, and in 1949 was awarded a PhD in communications from New York University. He was a frequent substitute trombonist for the Minnesota (formerly Minneapolis) Orchestra from the 1940s to the 1960s and contributed significantly to the Orchestra's oral history project through a series of taped interviews with performing artists. Among Paulu's numerous awards were five Fulbright Scholarships, three Ford Foundation grants, and a Sigma Delta Chi Award for journalism research. He served as president of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters and was a member of US delegations to UNESCO. Paulu was married for 60 years to the former Frances Tuttle Brown and was the father of three; he died at age 92 of Parkinson's.

Like all the Flowers, the Aubrietia class were originally designed as single-screw fleet sweeping vessels, with triple hulls at the bows and an above-water magazine located aft, to give extra protection against loss from mine damage when working. However, the utility of the design was found to be as a convoy escort, and as such other classes took over the minesweeping role. The Aubrietias were re-classified as convoy sloops. Unlike the preceding Flowers of the Acacia, Azalea and Arabis classes, with their unmistakable warship appearance, the Aubrietias were designed to look like small merchantmen, in the hope of deceiving U-boat commanders, a tactic known as the Q-ship.

Adults of this species are mesopelaegic.  Physical characteristics  The average size of adult H. pfefferi is in mantle length (ML). The body consists of a large funnel with small paddle-like fins. They have small tentacles above their eyes. The funnel does not have valves, but contains a dorsal pad with three papillae as organs. Paddle-shaped fins are attached to a part of the gladius. H. pfefferi has a single ocular photophore and does not have photophores at its arm tips.  Habitat  As paralarvae (<30 mm ML), they live near the surface of the oceans, between 100 m and 200 m deep. They descend to the mesopelagic zone as they mature, but exhibit a diel vertical migration pattern.
