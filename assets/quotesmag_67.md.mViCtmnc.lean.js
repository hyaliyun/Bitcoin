It is based upon the novel Break My Heart 1000 Times, by Daniel Waters. It stars Bella Thorne, Richard Harmon and Dermot Mulroney. The film was released on October 12, 2018, by Lionsgate. Plot An explosion at Dr. Martin Steiner's Ashburn Laboratories in Chicago kills countless people. Indistinguishable from humans, ghostly specters of the event's victims begin haunting the world as non- sentient \\"remnants\\" that briefly repeat certain actions at daily intervals. Ten years later, high school student Veronica 'Ronnie' Calder confronts her mother about how they don't acknowledge her dead father Robert's daily presence at their breakfast table. She becomes frightened by a remnant of a young man whose name she intuitively knows is Brian. Brian writes the word \\"run\\" on a mirror before vanishing. During a class on remnants taught by Mr. Bittner, Ronnie starts bleeding from her ear. Fearful that Brian wants to harm her, she visits Mr. Bittner at his home but he dismisses her worries. Knowing of his fascination with remnants, Ronnie convinces new classmate Kirk to help her figure out who Brian is. Kirk's research reveals that Brian was suspected of having abducted and murdered Pastor Greer's daughter Mary. They visit Pastor Greer who tells them she doesn't know who Brian was but adds that Brian killed himself the day after Mary disappeared. Ronnie discovers that she and Mary share the same birthday. After receiving a phone call from Pastor Greer, school principal Pescatelli summons Kirk to his office to ask about his investigation into Mary Greer's death. At a school basketball game, Ronnie sees visions of Brian, and Principal Pescatelli's body suddenly crashes through the ceiling. Kirk tells Ronnie that he believes Pescatelli died because he told him about their investigation. The pair connect Brian to the deaths of two more young women: Emma Shaw and Claire White. Claire White's sister Kerry tells them that Brian was her sister's boyfriend. She adds that they can watch Claire's death firsthand at Chicago's 'No-Go Zone'. Ronnie and Kirk brave intense remnants to make their way to where Claire died, which turns out to be Ashburn Laboratories in Darkness Falls. The pair sees Dr. Martin Steiner, now a disheveled man, among the spectators at Claire's death scene. Steiner explains that he was working on a project that would use living beings as vessels to resurrect the deceased, but the transference required both people to share a birthday. Brian was Steiner's research assistant, and Steiner believed Brian was trying to bring back his victims to make amends for their murders. Relieved of his burden of knowledge, Steiner kills himself. School administrators take Kirk into custody after finding a gun in his locker. Ronnie goes again to Mr. Bittner for help, and he confides that Kirk was expelled from his previous school for possessing a firearm. Kirk tries explaining to Ronnie that the new gun was planted, but she doesn't believe him. Mr. Bittner vows to keep Ronnie safe for the 48 hours until her birthday, which is when they believe Brian will try to kill her to resurrect one of the dead women. Bittner helps her fortify her house's panic room with lead lining, which is supposed to prevent remnants from passing through. Kirk discovers that Bittner was actually Dr. Steiner's research partner and goes to Bittner's house. He learns that Bittner has been trying to resurrect his dead daughter Eva. Bittner knocks him unconscious and buries him alive. Ronnie realizes that Bittner was murdering young women who shared his daughter's birthday in hopes of finding a vessel for Eva. He made Brian and Principal Pescatelli's deaths look like suicides when they discovered the truth. She escapes and runs to a frozen lake. When Bittner captures her, she breaks the thin ice, submerging them in freezing water. Mary Greer's ghost drowns Bittner while Brian's ghost saves Ronnie. As Ronnie struggles to remain conscious, she has memories of her father teaching her to ice skate at that same lake. Kirk arrives in time to pull her from the water. He explains that his father's ghost dug him out of the ground. Ronnie visits her father's grave with Kirk. They resolve to do something now that they are the only two people who know the truth behind the Chicago event. As they leave, Bittner's remnant observes the duo before vanishing.

The band is noted as the first Black Canadian band to sign with a major record label. History Crack of Dawn was formed in Toronto in the mid '70s by Grant Gabriel, his sister Jackie Gabriel (both originally from Springhill, Nova Scotia), Trevor Daley, Rupert Harvey, Mark Smith, Alvin Jones, and Carl Otway. When the Gabriel siblings left shortly after, the band added four new members: Harvey's brother Carl Harvey, lead singer Glen Ricketts, Jacek Sobotta, and Dwight Gabriel. Later on, Smith was briefly replaced by Andre King. Crack of Dawn gained a reputation for its live shows in the city's club scene, and while rehearsing in the Little Jamaica district one day, they were discovered by Toronto-based American producer Bob Gallo. After meeting with Gallo, the group signed a recording contract with Columbia Records in 1975. In 1976, the group released its self-titled debut album, Crack of Dawn. The album spawned the hit single \\"It's Alright (This Feeling)\\", which peaked at #45 on Canada's RPM Singles Chart. Crack of Dawn supported the album with a countrywide tour and released three additional singles: \\"The Key\\", \\"Keep the Faith\\", and \\"Boobie Ruby\\". The following year, the band broke up after Columbia record executives convinced Ricketts to pursue a solo career, and attempted to convert the band from a horn section to a rhythm section. In 1980, Dwight Gabriel relaunched Crack of Dawn as a four-man group, adding three new members: James (Jay) McGee, George Flint, and Gary Steed. A new album, Horizons, was released the following year by TTR Records, however, it was only distributed in the Netherlands. The band released the single \\"If You Want to Groove\\" before disbanding in 1982. Crack of Dawn reunited for a concert at Toronto's Harbourfront Centre in 2012. The group began working on a new album shortly after, with a lineup consisting of previous members Otway, the Harvey brothers, Daley, and Jones, as well as newcomers Alexis Baro, Bela Hajmann, Charles Sinclair, and lead singer Michael Dunston. In 2017, the group released the Spotlight album through Ford Street Records. Legacy Crack of Dawn has the distinction of being the first Black Canadian band to sign with a major label, having joined Columbia in 1975. After the band's first break up, many members began solo careers or joined other groups. Rupert Harvey had a solo career under the stage name \\"Ojiji\\" and co-founded the reggae band Messenjah and Carl Harvey became lead guitarist for the ska and reggae band Toots and the Maytals. Ricketts began a solo career in R&B;, though he later relocated to Jamaica and switched to reggae, recording under the stage name \\"Glen Ricks\\". Ricketts's son Glenn Lewis saw mainstream success as a neo soul singer in the early 2000s.

He was first appointed to the position in 2006 and has since been re-elected four times. Knezovich is a member of the Republican Party. Career Following the resignation of Mark Sterk in 2006, Knezovich was appointed to complete his term as sheriff of Spokane County, Washington. Knezovich had worked with the Spokane County Sheriff's Office for ten years, but was considered an outsider candidate. The local Republican Party and the outgoing sheriff both endorsed Cal Walker, the Spokane Valley Chief of Police. Walker unsuccessfully ran against Knezovich in the Republican primary later that year, and Knezovich has remained in office ever since. During the 2016 presidential election, Knezovich supported Donald Trump, while questioning his quality as a candidate. Knezovich stated of the 2016 presidential candidates, \\"I look at it, and I say, 'Is this the best we can field?' It kind of speaks to the level of people that are willing to run for office anymore.\\" At a March 2017 political rally, Knezovich praised President Trump and blamed former president Barack Obama for violence committed against law enforcement officers. Knezovich told the crowd, \\"never in my history have we been hunted and assassinated, and I blame Barack Obama.\\" Knezovich also accused Governor of Washington Jay Inslee of violating his oath of office by signing an executive order prohibiting state agencies from assisting in enforcement federal immigration laws. The Spokesman-Review later reported that murder of law enforcement officers reached historic lows during the Obama administration, and that Inslee's executive order did not apply to sheriff's departments. Knezovich stood by his remarks. Following a school shooting at Freeman High School in Rockford, Washington in 2017, Knezovich held a press conference in which he blamed the media and elected officials for \\"a counterculture of violence, a culture that is enamored with school shooting.\\" He also criticized violent video games and gang culture, while asserting that guns were not to blame. Knezovich had previously blamed the media and activists for violence following the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers. Electoral history =2006= =2010= =2014= =2018= In 2018, Knezovich was challenged for re-election by Scott Maclay, a respiratory therapist who had legally changed his name to DumpOzzie Dot Com in protest of the sheriff. Maclay had been a frequent critic of Knezovich and a regular attendee of Spokane Valley City Council meetings. Knezovich described Maclay as a \\"psychopath,\\" and was quoted as saying, \\"I truly expect him to try to kill me.\\" After advancing to the general election, Maclay died in a motorcycle crash in Idaho. According to the Spokane County Auditor, his death occurred too close to the election to have his name removed from the ballot.

Pasha Hawaii's shipping container in Kailua Kona, Hawaii Pasha Hawaii is an American shipping company specializing in the trade between Hawaii and the continental United States. Overview The firm dates back to 1949, and it is now part of Pasha Group, based in Seattle, Washington. In 2004 the firm commissioned the Jean Anne, a roll-on roll-off vessel. In 2015 the firm commissioned the Marjorie C a vessel with features of both a container vessel and ro-ro. In 2015 the firm purchased competing shipping firm Horizon Lines's Hawaii operations. In 2017 the International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots (MM&P;) filed a complaint against Pasha Hawaii, before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). They asserted Pasha Hawaii was designing two new vessels without sharing blueprints with their organization. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported, on September 19, 2017, that Pasha Hawaii announced it had ordered two new vessels, to be completed in 2020. It noted that a third shipping company, TOTE Incorporated, had announced it too would be offering a service between Hawaii and the continental USA, competing with Pasha Hawaii and Matson. As of today, the company specializes in the maritime transport and distribution of shipping containers, automobiles, trucks, trailers, Mafi roll trailers, heavy construction machineries and further types of static and rolling freight.  History  The company's roots to Hawaii started during WWII when the troops needed storage and truckaway services. To accommodate these needs, a station was set up in San Francisco to help the deployed troops. George W. Pasha, the founder, had a large amount of acquired knowledge about the automotive industry and started the company after seeing the demand for storage and transportation. His son George W. Pasha, III, realized the potential of the company and helped formed the company into what it is today. The company realized that there was a need for shipping goods from Hawaii to and from the Pacific Coast and began Pasha Hawaii in 1999. After creating the company they produced their first ship, M/V Jean Anne. The M/V Marjorie was added to the fleet in 2015 due to the high demand of more shipping between their routes. In 2015 the company also purchased competing shipping company Horizon Lines. Then later in 2018 the company announced the conversion to LNG with the building of two new ships. Pasha ship Jean Anne  Ships  The 579-foot Jean Anne was the first ship added to the fleet and it was commissioned in 2004. The Jean Anne is a ro-ro, which means that they carry specifically vehicles. These ships look and operate like giant garages. The $90 million ship was designed to carry 3,000 vehicles on each trip. Its ports of call are Honolulu, Kahului and Hilo. The 692-foot Marjorie C was the second ship to be added to the fleet, commissioned in 2015. The Marjorie C is a con-ro, which means the ship carries both vehicles and containers. The ship can carry 1,200 vehicles and 1,400 TEUs of containers. The ship's ports of call are Honolulu and Los Angeles, usually carrying 30 percent cars, 10 percent oversized items, and 60 percent containers. Pasha Hawaii now has 6 container ships operating on its routes and will be introducing two new all container ships that will join the fleet in 2020. The ship will be LNG-powered and will be able to carry 2,525 TEUs of containers. The new ship will operate on the same west coast to Hawaii trade lane. The manufacturer of the propulsion systems will be MAN Energy Solutions. These will be the first LNG-powered vessels to operate between Hawaii and the west coast. LNG is a system that burns fuel and natural gas to create propulsion. Most ships are now switching over to LNG-powered systems due to environmental regulations. The LNG system will make it easier for ship to ship transfers of fuel.

Political career  Alexandre Taillefer served as the campaign chair for the Quebec Liberal Party in the 2018 Quebec general election. He did not run for a seat in the National Assembly. His position as campaign chair for the party in power and as a major shareholder of Quebec media companies generated concerns regarding his potential use of the media to promote the Liberal Party. Similar concerns resulted from the election of Pierre Karl Péladeau as Parti Québecois leader. In an effort to respond to these concerns, Taillefer transitioned out of his managerial responsibilities.

This kuntao-silat hybrid style was originally developed in Kampung Dadap, a village in Kosambi district of Tangerang Regency, Banten Province, Indonesia. The founder of this style combined elements of his ancestral Chinese martial arts with the silat knowledge he received from his Betawi teachers. The style spread through his disciples to the coastal Betawinese and the Benteng Chinese around Kampung Dadap. Eventually, the silat style also reached Petukangan Selatan in South Jakarta and Batujaya in Tangerang. Etymology Opinions on the origin of the term Beksi vary. According to silat researcher G.J. Nawi, the term evolved from the phrase Bhe Si, which means 'horse stance' in Hokkien. History Beksi Silat was originally created by Lie Tjeng Hok, a peranakan Chinese farmer who created a unique mixed martial art that combined elements from his family's martial arts and Betawinese martial arts. His Betawinese martial arts masters are recorded as Ki Jidan and Ki Miah (also spelled Ki Maimah). Lie Tjeng Hok taught the martial arts to his students, the Peranakan Chinese, and the coastal Betawinese around his home in Kampung Dadap, Kosambi, Tangerang. One of his most talented Betawinese students was Ki Muharli (or Marhali). Ki Muharli then had a Peranakan-Betawinese disciple named H. Gozali (or Godjalih) bin H. Gatong, who then taught his knowledge to his students in Petukangan, South Jakarta and in Batujaya, Batuceper, Tangerang. The main disciples of H. Gozali included Kong H. Hasbullah bin Misin, Kong M. Nur, Kong Simin, and Kong Mandor Minggu \\\\- who also studied with Ki Muharli. Among others, Lie Djie Tong and his successors were those who continue to teach this style in the vicinity of Kampung Dadap. From these places, the Beksi Silat styles spread throughout southeast Asia. It is estimated that there are at least 120 Beksi Silat clubs in the Jabodetabek area that participated in the Girli and Beksi Village Festival 2016 in the village of Batusari, in Batuceper, Tangerang. Forms =Basic forms= Generally, Beksi Silat schools teach 12 basic forms or moves (Betawi: ), each of which has its own advanced forms (Betawi: kembangan). According to four grandmasters of Beksi schools in Petukangan, although there are differences in names and sequences, most schools teach at least 3 basic forms with the same names and sequences, namely: 1. Beksi, 2. Gedig, 3. Tancep. =Form names= Below are the form names of the Beksi Silat, according to Eddy Wijaya (H.

The screenplay was adapted by Jorge Guerricaechevarría and Chris Sparling. It was produced by Morena Films. The Warning was shown at the 2018 Miami International Film Festival and premiered on Netflix in July 2018. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Plot In April 2018, 9-year-old Nico is tormented by bullies who force him to steal an X-rated magazine from a 24-hour convenience store and tell him about a man who was shot and killed there 10 years earlier. Nico is caught shoplifting by the owner, Héctor, who realizes the magazine is not for such a young boy. Héctor does not tell Nico's mother and Nico instead buys a video game magazine. Later, Nico discovers a note inside the magazine saying he must not go to the store on his birthday, April 12, or else he will be killed. His mother reports her suspicions about the bullies having written the note to Nico's school principal which then results in further retaliation. On April 2, 2008, Jon picks up his best friend, David, who reveals he plans to propose that weekend to his girlfriend, Andrea. At Andrea's behest, the pair stop to purchase ice at the same store before heading home. Jon waits in his car while David steps inside and is subsequently shot in a failed murder attempt. As David falls into a coma, Jon, a mathematician suffering from schizophrenia, stops taking his risperidone. He discovers three previous violent incidents at the store's location with an unusual pattern. Except for David's shooting, each incident occurred on April 12 with five people present: a 10-year-old boy and four others aged 21, 32, 42, and 53 years old. The first incident was a botched bank robbery by Ezequiel González when the location housed the Crédito Agrícola in 1913. Jon finds the elderly daughter of Ezequiel, who reveals her father was desperate for money to pay for medical treatment as she contracted an illness from Ezequiel upon his return from the war in Africa. After being denied a loan, an armed Ezequiel returned and killed the manager when he pulled out a gun. Ezequiel, who suffered from PTSD from the war, was triggered by people screaming and shot three more people before killing himself. In 1955, exactly 42 years later, the 42-year-old owner of an inn at the location was murdered by her ex-lover in front of her 10-year-old son. Then, 21 years later in 1976, members of the Basque separatist group ETA attempted to assassinate an Army general at the same location. The general survived, but his 21-year-old guard died protecting a 10-year-old boy. Jon tells Andrea and David's brother about the pattern, but they blame his schizophrenia as he admits to stopping his medication. Andrea accuses him of being paranoid because his birthday is on April 12, when he will turn 32. When David is declared brain dead with only a one-in-a-million chance of regaining consciousness, his family decides to pull the plug on April 12 much to Andrea's anguish. Jon later tells Andrea his theory that Ezequiel is being reincarnated and killed on the same spot, and that based on the sequence, a 10-year-old boy will be the final one killed. Andrea becomes enraged, revealing she blames herself for asking Jon to pick up the ice and Jon for allowing David to go inside. At the hospital, Andrea and David's family share their final farewells before the life support is terminated. After David's life support is disconnected, Jon runs to the maternity ward, shouting to the parents of a newborn their son must not go to the convenience store on his 10th birthday or else he will die. Jon is subdued by hospital staff but escapes and returns to the convenience store, where he gets a call from Andrea that David has miraculously regained consciousness. Jon immediately realizes that he is the one who must die. He writes down the warning Nico received earlier in the film and gives it to Héctor, the owner while wearing a video game T-shirt. Jon begs Héctor to pass the warning onto any boy who reminds him of Jon ten years later. Jon then insists another customer is going to attempt a robbery which causes Héctor to call the police and ultimately pull out his gun. In a moment of distraction, Jon wrests the gun away from Héctor and forces Héctor, the man and a boy to go outside. In the distance, a police siren can be heard heading to the store's location. In 2018, Nico learns another boy got the same warning not to go to the store, but it happened at the hospital the day he was born. When Lucía asks the boy's father, he denies it. Lucía is convinced her son is being pranked and insists he go to the store to conquer his fears once and for all. She gives him money and waits outside. As Nico waits inside, a man pulls out a gun and demands money from the register. Héctor is absent, but the younger man working pulls out a gun in response. Nico looks up in the convex mirror to see Jon from 2008, waving the gun outside the store, while Jon sees in the mirror the image of Nico in 2018. In the mirror, Jon screams at Nico over and over to run, and Nico runs to safety just as bullets fly. Outside, he tells his mother he wasn't afraid. Finally flashing back to 2008, the police officer shoots and wounds Jon. Jon witnesses Nico surviving and dies shortly after Andrea and David's brother arrive. After his death, Nico is born.

Jonathan Holland of The Hollywood Reporter gave a negative review, writing, \\"As a director, Calparsoro has repeatedly promised to deliver something special, but has never quite delivered: The Warning, whose final third makes logical sense, but relies too heavily on unlikely coincidence, continues that trend.\\" In Forbes, Travis DeShong summarized the film as disappointing, writing, \\"The only thing worse than a bad film is a disappointing one. Nothing stings quite like a film failing to deliver on its premise, especially if that premise shows promise. Spanish director Daniel Calparsoro's thriller, The Warning (El Aviso), an adaptation of the novel by Paul Pen, is capably assembled but doesn't fulfill its own potential, betraying glimpses of a richer story than the one we actually get.\\" Jordi Costa of Spanish newspaper El País (Spain) compared the film to episodes of Lost criticized the storyline, writing, \\"Calparsoro puts his professionalism at the service of a story that does not create enough belief in the improbable so that the viewer is imbued with the mystery. It leaves the impression that even a good part of the cast has serious difficulties in believing in this story.\\" Joe Reid of Decider.com gave the film a more positive review, writing, \\"A well-acted and surprisingly affecting thriller, all things considered, and a satisfying mystery, if not a shocking one.\\" References External links * Category:2018 films Category:2018 thriller films Category:Spanish thriller films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Spanish-language Netflix original films Category:Spanish films Category:Films directed by Daniel Calparsoro ","title":"The Warning (2018 film)"},{"id":"58043522","text":"Vijay Singh Solanki is an Indian politician and a member of the Indian National Congress party.

The route starts at U.S. Route 61 (US 61) near Port Gibson, and it travels eastward. The road then turns northeastward, and the route ends at Willows Road and Old Port Gibson Road near Willows. MS 462 was designated around 1958, as a gravel road extending eastward from US 61 near Port Gibson. The road was extended to MS 461 from 1960 to 1963, then to the Natchez Trace Parkway from 1967 to 1998. Route description All of MS 462 is located in Claiborne County. In 2017, the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated 470 vehicles traveling on MS 462 southwest of Vellie Morand Road on average each day. The route is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65-3-3, and it is maintained by MDOT as part of the Mississippi State Highway System. MS 462 starts at the intersection with US 61 and Grand Gulf Road north of Port Gibson, and it travels eastward. The road first travels along Pierre Bayou, and it soon turns northeastward into a forested area. The route crosses Lick Branch, and it intersects Vellie Morand Road. MS 462 then turns eastward near the unincorporated area of Willows, and state maintenance ends near Willows Road and Old Port Gibson Road. The road continues as Old Port Gibson Road, which continues to Raymond. History Around 1958, a gravel road was constructed from US 61 near Port Gibson to a point away from the western terminus, and it was designated as MS 462. By 1960, the route was connected to MS 461 via a gravel county road that crossed Big Black River. The state- maintained section of MS 462 was also paved around this time. Three years later, MS 461 was decommissioned, and the eastern terminus of MS 462 was rerouted to a state-maintained gravel road near the then-proposed Natchez Trace Parkway. The route was completely paved by 1967, and it was connected to the parkway. In 1975, a project to add overlay to of MS 462 started.

It has been pillaged, burned, destroyed, and renovated several times over its history. Montenegro's 1979 earthquake caused a great deal of damage that was partly rehabilitated in 1984.

Etymology  The popular name of the monastery is derived from its location downhill or \\"below\\" (pod) the local village of Lastva.  The Church  The church was constructed of stone masonry under a tiled roof. Its front exterior includes a bell tower attached to an independent narthex.

He served as first United Nations Resident Representative in Indonesia (1952–53), and New Zealand Ambassador to Tokyo (1956-61) and High Commissioner to Canada (1961–64). Early life John Reid was born in the then largely working-class Lower Hutt suburb of Petone, the eldest of five children of Scottish-born John Reid (1874-1950), a worker in the nearby Railway Workshops, and Alice, née Bernard (1876-1953), New Zealand- born grand-daughter of an Anglo-Irish Church of Ireland clergyman. He was among the first from Petone to achieve a university degree, studying law part- time at Victoria University College while working in the Crown Law Office. He graduated and began practising law in 1923, initially in Christchurch, and then in Marton, Taihape and Putaruru, before opening his own practice in Lower Hutt in 1927. On 6 October 1926 he married Wellington schoolteacher Doris Aileen Priestley (1900-1987), born in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, from a long line of Methodist clergy. Drafting Social Welfare Legislation During the Great Depression of 1929-35, John Reid assisted the Labour member of Parliament for the Hutt, Walter Nash, in his regular Sunday clinics to assist the unemployed and destitute. When the Labour Party swept to power in the 1935 election, Walter Nash became Finance Minister, with overall responsibility for implementing the ambitious Labour platform of social welfare. He soon began calling on John Reid to assist in the drafting of the enabling legislation, and encouraged him to join the Public Service as Assistant Law Draftsman in 1938. As a key member of the committee tasked with devising for Nash an affordable universal pension scheme, he wrote a much-cited summary to Nash on 23 March 1938 outlining a universal pension of 10 shillings a week at 65,and a means-tested pension of 30 shillings at 60 for those unable to provide for themselves. Keith Sinclair argues that it was \\"this suggestion made initially by John S. Reid\\", that \\"laid the basis for the first universal pension scheme in the world\\".Keith Sinclair, Walter Nash (Auckland 1976), p.165. The scheme was built into the Social Security Act of 1938.Elizabeth Hansen, The Politics of Social Security: The 1938 Act and some later developments (Auckland, 1980), p.55 Opening the Washington Legation World War II convinced New Zealand (like Australia) that it could no longer depend exclusively on Britain for its protection and foreign policy, but urgently needed representation in the U.S.. Lacking experienced personnel, the Government appointed workaholic Walter Nash himself as its first Minister to Washington in late 1941, while keeping his other roles in Cabinet. He asked John Reid to accompany him during his first period in Washington (January 1942 to April 1943) but Reid declined to leave his large family in the middle of a threatening war. On the second, in December 1943, he agreed to go as First Secretary with special responsibility for the economic relations with the U.S. through Lend-Lease. The appointment was seen as irregular by the Opposition, which questioned it in the New Zealand Parliament, but also by Alister McIntosh, the new Secretary of the Department of External Affairs, constituted in June 1943. Only after Nash was replaced in July 1944 as Minister (later Ambassador) by Sir Carl Berendsen, McIntosh's former mentor in Wellington, who also found Reid essential, was he accepted as a permanent part of the diplomatic service. His four children were then able to join him and Aileen in Washington. Reid was frequently in charge of the tiny mission in Washington, since both Nash and Berendsen were in demand for the constant round of post-war conferences, while Berendsen came to love the US lecture circuit. His most significant impact was in representing New Zealand on the UN Trusteeship Council in 1948, leading New Zealand to part company with the more defensive administering powers, on one occasion voting (with USSR) against Britain over its self-satisfied report on Tanganyika.New York Times 4 August 1948; McIntosh, 1948 in Undiplomatic Dialogue: Letters between Carl Berendsen and Alister McIntosh, 1943-52, ed. Ian McGibbon (Auckland University Press, 1993), p.165. Nudging New Zealand towards Asia Back in Wellington, Reid was left to handle the ambitious Australia-initiated project that became the Colombo Plan, about which McIntosh and the government of the day were decidedly negative. At the Sydney planning meeting in May 1950, Reid was surprisingly elected to chair the preparatory committee of officials drafting a plan for Technical Assistance, despite New Zealand's reluctance to commit money to anything. Again surprisingly, he mediated the desire of the Asian delegations to see this fast-tracked effectively enough to have Technical Assistance emerge as the unexpected main event for immediate action, rather than the controversial Australian scheme for capital assistance on the model of the Marshall Plan in Europe. At the subsequent 'Consultative Committee' meeting in Colombo (Feb 1951), he chaired the drafting committee for the final report. He represented New Zealand at the other Colombo Plan and ECAFE meetings in 1950-52, presenting as positive a face as possible on New Zealand's then reluctance to incur responsibilities of any kind in Asia. United Nations Tasks These roles drew the attention of the UN's infant Technical Assistance Board, when in 1951-2 it was looking for a senior figure to represent it in Jakarta, who might be able to overcome the sensitivity of the nationalist government about taking advice from patronising neo-colonials. Reid took up the position in July 1952, as the UN's first Resident Representative in Indonesia. His final report, at the end of 1953, revealed the frustrations of trying to coordinate a range of independent-minded UN specialist organisations with the priorities of the Indonesian government. In 1954 the UN Trusteeship Council entrusted Reid to chair its regular 3-yearly Visiting Mission to the Trust Territories in East Africa: - Tanganyika (assigned to Britain), Ruanda and Urundi (Belgium) and Somaliland (Italy). In this case he found himself in a conservative minority of one over the issue of demanding a rapid timetable for independence. In relation to Ruanda-Urundi Reid \\"feared there would be violent outbreaks\\" between Tutsi and Hutu unless the Belgians adopted a very different strategy before independence. Ramon Sears, representing the US, created a majority on several of these issues by joining the more anti-colonial members from India and El Salvador. Sears was, however, overruled by the State Department, and the Trusteeship Council at its meeting in December 1954 incorporated the Reid minority report into the official report of the mission.T1142 in the Official Records of the 15th Session of the Trusteeship Council, supplement 3; B.T. G. Chidzero, Tanganyika and International Trusteeship (Oxford University Press, 1961), pp.164-6; John S. Reid, Autobiographical Notes, 1978. Diplomatic Posts In 1956 Reid was posted to Tokyo as New Zealand's first Minister to Japan, with the post upgraded to Ambassador in 1958. A highlight was the first (Junior) All Black tour of Japan in 1958, a big moment in Japan rugby which saw Reid become Patron of the Rugby Union of Japan. He was also able to host his old friend Walter Nash, making the first New Zealand Prime Ministerial visit to Japan. In 1961 he was posted as High Commissioner to Canada. Health concerns of himself and his wife dictated an early retirement and return to Wellington in 1964. Among various retirement tasks was as President of the Walter Nash Vietnam Memorial Appeal, which succeeded in building a children's hospital at Qui Nhon, South Vietnam, in the late 1960s.

She has given birth to three known offspring, a male in 2010, a female in 2018, and another male in 2020. Her second calf died shortly after birth and J35 carried her body for 17 days in an apparent show of grief that attracted international attention. Name J35 was given the name Tahlequah by The Whale Museum in Friday Harbor, Washington, as part of their Adopt-a-Whale outreach program. One of her adopters was Malia Obama, daughter of Barack Obama. Life J35 was born in 1998 to J17 (Princess Angeline), a member of the J pod of the Southern Resident community, and has two living siblings. J35's first calf, a male named J47 (Notch), was born in 2010, and researchers speculated that she miscarried another calf in the mid-2010s. After the death of her sister J28 (Polaris) in 2016, J35 cared for her two offspring, until one, that was still milk-dependent, starved to death. Her second calf, a female, was born on July 24, 2018, near Victoria, British Columbia; she was alive, but died within a half-hour of her birth. The infant population and health of the Southern Residents community had declined in the early 21st century, due in part to a smaller supply of Chinook salmon and the presence of polluting substances in the Salish Sea. J35 carried the calf's body on her rostrum while following the pod around the San Juan Islands and interior waters of British Columbia over the following two weeks. Whale researchers noted that J35 looked emaciated and other pod members were showing concern for her health. After the seventh day, other members began taking turns floating the calf while allowing J35 to rest. By the ninth day, the calf had shown signs of visible decomposition and was becoming harder to carry. The pod disappeared for several days in early August, but were spotted on August 8, with J35 still carrying her calf after 16 days. By the following day, after of swimming, J35 released the calf and rejoined the J pod with no apparent signs of malnutrition or ill health. Her unusually long period of grieving attracted international attention and an outpouring of sympathy, comparing her actions to that of a human mother. The ongoing crisis within the Southern Residents community prompted calls for intervention, including dam removals and the increased killing of sea lions who interfere with salmon growth in the Columbia River. Washington Governor Jay Inslee stated that he supported new measures to address orca-related issues and would work with state and federal officials to find short-term solutions. In July 2020, a drone survey of the J, K, and L pods revealed that J35 showed signs of an active pregnancy. She gave birth to a male calf, named J57 by the Center for Whale Research, on September 5 near the San Juan Islands.

History  The railway stop of Galoppfältet was established in 1913 and was then called Åkerby. Since the establishment of Täby Galoppe Field next to the station, the name was changed in 1960. In 1993, the Roslagsbanan line was improved with double tracks from Roslags Näsby railway station and after the Galoppfältet the line is converted to a single track. In August 2010, the double track was extended until Viggbyholm station.  Area  Within 500m radius of the stop area, a high school and a business park and a large bus garage and a hotel were built. There are several clubs in the area such as Täby Transmitters radio club and two large tenants associations with a total of 1700 apartments and approximately 3,500 inhabitants.  Projects  Täby Galoppe Field is planned to be replaced with a big project for houses and other buildings. This project is expected to increase the significance of the stop. The new district planned in the area has been named Täby park.

She began her career in marine biology and conservation and has since become an expert in the use of narrative storytelling for effective science communication.  Education and early career  Neeley received her Bachelor of Arts in Marine Biology in 2002. She then completed her Master's degree at Boston University in Ecology and Evolution in 2005. Her graduate research centered on the evolution of color patterns and visual communication systems in tropical reef fishes—wrasses and parrotfish—in the laboratory of Gil Rosenthal. Following graduate school, she began a career in marine conservation, applying her general subject matter knowledge to science advocacy. She began working at SeaWeb, a communications-based nonprofit organization committed to promoting understanding around ocean and conservation science to a host of stakeholders—from decision makers to community leaders to the media. By strategically communicating to these groups, SeaWeb worked to foster the development of measures to protect the ocean. From 2005 to 2006, Neeley worked with SeaWeb's Asia Pacific Program, partnering with local communities and researchers in Fiji and Papua New Guinea to build communications capacity for them to share their knowledge of local coral reefs ecosystems with the local media. In 2006, she transitioned to the role of Program Manager at SeaWeb, where she helped launch the \\"Too Precious to Wear\\" campaign, partnering with the fashion industry to raise awareness around the toll of dredging deep sea coral. The campaign sought to impose limits on coral use in fashion, design, and home decor through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.  Science communication career  Following her tenure at SeaWeb, Neeley focused her career more on efforts around science communication, training scientists on how best to share their knowledge of science with a range of stakeholders. She has served as a contributing author on a range of books on science communication. She wrote a section on utilizing social media to promote a scientist's work for Science Blogging: The Essential Guide and contributed a chapter on communicating controversial topics in science on social media in Effective Risk Communication. She also co-authored Escape from the Ivory Tower: a guide to making your science matter during her time at the nonprofit COMPASS. Neeley has lent her expertise to a number of groups centered on communicating science to the public, previously serving on the advisory board of the CommLab at MIT from 2015 to 2017 and on the Advisory Council of Ensia magazine. She also holds a Lecturer appointment at Yale School of Medicine in conjunction with the National Neuroscience Curriculum Initiative. = COMPASS = In 2008, Neeley joined COMPASS, a nonprofit organization co-founded by marine ecologist and former NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco to train scientists to more effectively share their expertise with journalists, decision makers, and the public at large. There, Neeley served as the Assistant Director of Science Outreach, working to develop their training programs in science communication and connecting scientists to public conversations around their expertise. She also launched COMPASS's training programs around how scientists can more effectively utilize social media to share their work and engage with a broader audience. During her tenure at COMPASS, she was affiliate staff at the University of Washington in the School of Aquatic & Fisheries Sciences. = The Story Collider = In 2015, Neeley became the executive director of The Story Collider, a nonprofit organization that brings personal stories inspired by science to the public through live shows and a weekly podcast. The organization also trains scientists on how to employ the tools of storytelling to become better communicators. In this role, she's also spearheaded efforts in applying storytelling to more traditionally academic forms of communication, curating a collection of \\"Conservation stories from the front lines\\" for PLOS Biology. She has spoken about the importance of storytelling for science at a number of universities and organizations, including the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, the University of Washington College of the Environment's Bevan Series, Yale University, and at Northwestern University. In the policy arena, she has contributed a position paper on the use of narrative persuasion to help scientists ethically navigate the world of decision making at the Institute on Science for Global Policy in partnership with Sigma Xi. Neeley has also told stories of her own for The Story Collider, including a story about a field expedition gone awry during her time as an undergraduate and another about her colleagues forgetting her while working on coral conservation in Fiji.

It was the final large scale offensive of the war that saw significant territorial changes. By 19 May the second phase of the Spring Offensive, the Battle of the Soyang River, on the eastern section of the front, was losing momentum due to reinforcement of the UN forces, supply difficulties and mounting losses from UN air and artillery strikes. On 20 May the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) and Korean People's Army (KPA) began to withdraw after suffering heavy losses, simultaneously the UN launched their counteroffensive in the west and central portions of the front. On 24 May, once the PVA/KPA advance had been halted, the UN began a counteroffensive there also. In the west UN forces were unable to maintain contact with the PVA/KPA as they withdrew faster than the UN advance. In the central area the UN forces made contact with the PVA/KPA at chokepoints north of Chuncheon inflicting heavy losses. In the east UN forces had remained in contact with the PVA/KPA and progressively pushed them back north of the Soyang River. By mid-June UN forces had reached Line Kansas approximately north of the 38th Parallel from which they had withdrawn at the start of the Spring Offensive and in some areas advanced to Line Wyoming further north. With the discussions for the start of ceasefire negotiations underway, the UN advance stopped on the Kansas-Wyoming Line which was fortified as the Main line of resistance and despite some limited attacks this would essentially remain the frontline throughout the next 2 years of stalemate. Background On 18 May, in response to Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) and Korean People's Army (KPA) attacks on the east of the front in the Battle of the Soyang River, UN Commander General Matthew Ridgway suggested to US Eighth Army commander General James Van Fleet that he should attempt to relieve the pressure on his forces in the east by attacking in the west to threaten PVA/KPA lines of communication in the Iron Triangle. Ridgway recommended a two-division attack moving on the Route 33 axis towards Ch'orwon. He thought such an attack would have a good chance of succeeding since intelligence indicated that only four PVA armies occupied the sector of the front west of Chuncheon and since PVA commander Peng Dehuai would need at least a week or ten days to shift any material part of his mass from the east to oppose the advance. Nor had PVA/KPA forces on the western front shown much aggressiveness. PVA attacks had forced back some patrol base and outpost units and had tested the main line in both the US I Corps and US IX Corps sectors, but these attacks had been isolated affairs, not coordinated actions in a concerted holding operation. Judging PVA/KPA forces in the east-central area to be clearly overextended after he reconnoitered the front on 19 May, Ridgway enlarged his concept to take advantage of their vulnerability and ordered Van Fleet to attack across the entire front. Agreeing that the PVA/KPA forces could be trapped, Van Fleet laid out an operation that he believed could produce decisive results if the attack moved fast enough. Though stabilizing the line in the east remained a problem, he now viewed that task with no great alarm even though PVA/KPA forces were deepening and strengthening their penetration. If for no other reason, he expected their logistical difficulties in the mountains to slow if not stop their advance within a matter of days; they would have created only a \\"long bag\\" that could closed behind them by rapid drives to block their main routes of resupply and withdrawal. Van Fleet's plan called for I Corps, IX Corps and part of the US 1st Marine Division at the left of US X Corps to advance on 20 May toward the Munsan- Chuncheon segment of Line Topeka. Once the Topeka segment was occupied, strikes to start closing the bag were to be made toward the Iron Triangle, one up Route 3 to secure a road center in the Yongp'yong River valley some above Uijongbu, another up Route 17 beyond Chuncheon to seize the complex of road junctions at the west end of the Hwacheon Reservoir. Attack =West- Central sector= On 20 May, with the objective of reaching the main bodies of PVA/KPA forces, including reserves, before they could organize for defensive action, I Corps commander Lieutenant general Frank W. Milburn set his three divisions on courses for Line Topeka some above his Seoul defenses, aiming the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) 1st Division toward Munsan, the US 1st Cavalry Division north through Uijongbu and up Route 33, and the US 25th Infantry Division north along Route 3 toward the road hub in the Yongp'yong River valley. To the east IX Corps commander Lieutenant general William M. Hoge had established an intermediate line, Georgia, whose central trace lay just above the lateral stretch of the Bukhan River dammed on the west to form the Chongpyong Reservoir and along the upper bank of the Hongch'on River emptying into the reservoir from the east. A rapid advance to Line Georgia, Hoge had believed, would allow his four divisions (the US 24th Infantry Division and the ROK 2nd and 6th Divisions and the US 7th Infantry Division, arrayed west to east) to reach the PVA/KPA reserves. I Corps' forces had gained ground rapidly, especially the ROK 1st Division, which entered Munsan-ni at midmorning on 21 May, and all three divisions were on or near Line Topeka by evening of 23 May. But the attack had amounted to a futile chase as the KPA I Corps and PVA 63rd Army retreated faster than the I Corps advanced. Tank and tank-infantry forces probing well to the front of the main body of the 25th Infantry Division consistently failed to make solid contact and raised doubt that the Yongp'yong River valley road hub more than ahead of the division could be taken in time to block PVA/KPA movement through it. Despite light resistance, the IX Corps' attack from the outset had been more cautious than aggressive. After a short advance on 20 May, General Hoge sharply reprimanded his division commanders for failing to push their attacks, but gains on 21 May were even shorter. Attempting again to accelerate the advance, Hoge directed his forces to employ pursuit tactics and move no less than on 22 May, a distance that would carry them to beyond Line Georgia, far enough, if done speedily enough, Hoge believed, to break through covering forces and make contact with the main bodies of withdrawing PVA. The attack on the 22nd, however, took his four divisions no farther than Line Georgia. In new attack orders for 23 May, Hoge made zone adjustments, obliged to do so on his right by General Van Fleet's orders moving the corps boundary east as X Corps joined the counterattack. The ROK 7th Division, after advancing in its present zone for most of the day, was to relieve 1st Marine Division forces straddling Route 29 and prepare to attack on the Chuncheon-Hwacheon axis toward the road complex at the west end of the Hwacheon Reservoir. On his left, Hoge switched the zones of the 24th Infantry Division and ROK 2nd Division and ordered 24th Division commander General Blackshear M. Bryan to send a task force northeast up Route 17 to seize Kap'yong while the remainder of his division followed astride the road. The ROK 2nd Division, shifting to the Corps' left flank after Bryan's forces passed through it en route to Kap'yong, was to attack northwest along secondary Route 15 toward Taebo-ri. Still trying to animate his forces, Hoge again directed pursuit tactics and authorized them to bypass enemy groups up to company in size. His divisions advanced easily on 23 May against an accelerating withdrawal by the PVA 63rd and 64th Armies, but few units gained more than . In the deepest move, General Bryan's task force of tanks and the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment captured Kap'yong after meeting only a smattering of opposition along Route 17. Hoge nevertheless now had two American divisions positioned for advances over roads converging near the lower edge of his road center objective, the 7th Infantry Division below Chuncheon and the 24th at Kap'yong, whence a secondary valley road left Route 17 and ran northeast to rejoin it near the village of Chiam-ni (). =Eastern sector= General Edward Almond's plan for the X Corps' counterattack commencing on 23 May amounted to an enlargement of limited attacks launched the day before. In the Soksa-ri () area, the 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, had driven cross-country against hard resistance to a position commanding the lower end of a pass on the Soksa-ri-Habaejae () road about midway between the towns. Almond ordered the 3rd Infantry Division to point its general attack at the remainder of the pass and, farther north, at a road junction some due east of Habaejae where the Soksa-ri-Habaejae road connected with another road winding northeast through the higher Taebaek Mountains to Yangyang on the coast. The seizure of these objectives, ordered before the withdrawal of PVA/KPA forces from the Soksa-ri-Hajinbu-ri area became apparent, was aimed at blocking the two best roads behind the PVA. Almond reinforced the 3rd Division by attaching the ROK 8th Division, now fully assembled in Chech'on, and also gave the ROK 9th Division (received as a result of ROK III Corps' inactivation on 22 May) to General Robert H. Soule along with the responsibility for the additional ground assigned to X Corps in the Hajinbu-ri area. About to attack with the approximation of a corps, Soule planned to send his 7th and 65th Regiments toward the pass and road junction, bring the damaged ROK 9th Division back into action in the Hajinbu-ri area, and keep the untried ROK 8th Division in reserve. Task Force Yoke, the mix of: the 2nd Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment; the bulk of the ROK 3rd Regiment; all but two companies of the 72nd Tank Battalion; a platoon of the 15th Infantry Regiment's tank company; a battery of the 300th Field Artillery Battalion; and a tactical air control party organized by General Almond under the deputy corps commander, Colonel Ladue, had attacked through the lines of the ROK 7th Division in the P'ungam-ni () area to seize the Habaejae road junction. A combination of difficult terrain, heavy, if spotty, resistance, and a foot-dragging performance by the South Korean troops had stopped Ladue short of his objective. For the general attack, Almond elected to replace the Yoke forces with Task Force Able, built around the 15th Regimental Combat Team, which was to be detached from the 3rd Division and operate under Corps' control. Once the Able force had taken Habaejae and the 3rd Division coming up from the south had captured the road junction to the east, the task force was to be dissolved and the 15th Infantry was to join the operations of its own division. In what amounted to the beginning of one of two major spearheads of the corps counterattack, Almond on the afternoon of 22 May had sent the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (187th RCT) up Route 24 to take the high ground around Han'gye (). Passing through the 23rd Infantry, General Frank S. Bowen's forces, with a battalion of the 5th Marine Regiment and two battalions of the 9th Infantry Regiment moving forward on their flanks, had driven to their objective easily against light opposition. In the counterattack, the main effort was to be made on the Route 24 axis. The 2nd Infantry Division, with the 187th RCT attached, was to drive on Inje, the 1st Marine Division to advance on Yanggu. Almond's concept was that the two spearheads would trap the enemy forces east of Route 24 and lay them open to destruction by Corps forces advancing on the right. In the drive on Yanggu, the opening attack of the 1st Marine Division along the west side of Route 24 carried the 1st and 5th Marine Regiments into the extremely rough ground rising toward Hill 1051 (). In a gain of about , exhausting climbs and descents felled more Marines than did encounters with rearguard forces of the retreating PVA 15th Army. A highlight of the attack was the recovery of eleven wounded men of the 2nd Infantry Division by 5th Marine forces advancing within of Hill 1051. For the 2nd Infantry Division's move on Inje, General Clark L. Ruffner assigned the main effort to the 187th RCT. With Company B of the 72nd Tank Battalion attached, General Bowen's combat team was to take over the zone of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, which General Almond had ordered into corps reserve, and attack up Route 24, initially (as Almond also had directed) to seize a bridge site on the Soyang River at Umyang-ni (), southwest of the Inje road center. On a parallel course at the division's right, the 38th Infantry was to advance along the mountain road running northeast from P'ungam-ni to Hyon-ni () and then turning northwest to Inje. The 9th Infantry was to sweep the division's central area. With the entire PVA 12th Army attempting to withdraw north between Route 24 and the P'ungam-ni-Hyon-ni road, 2nd Division forces advancing in that area on 23 May encountered only feeble delaying actions. Somewhat stouter, but not immovable blocking positions confronted the 38th Infantry on the right, where the PVA 80th Division of the 27th Army apparently was trying to hold open the Habaejae-Sangam-ni () segment of the road coming up from Soksa-ri. Yet Ruffner's opening attack was no great surge forward. Average gains of matched those of the 1st Marine Division and took the 2nd Division only as far as its nearest intermediate terrain objectives in the high ground confining the Naech'on River on the north and northeast. As originally constituted for the attack to seize the Habaejae road junction, Task Force Able included the 15th Regimental Combat Team, the bulk of the ROK 3rd Regiment, and a battery of the 300th Field Artillery Battalion, the last two units coming from the disbanded Task Force Yoke. With characteristic attention to custom-making assault forces, General Almond reshaped the force late on 22 May, passing the South Koreans back to the ROK 7th Division, which was to go into Corps' reserve, pulling the 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment and returning it to 3rd Division control, and adding the headquarters and a company of the 2nd Division's 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion. It was mid- afternoon before Lt. Col. Thomas R. Yancey, the 15th Regimental Combat Team and task force commander, could organize the Able force and open the attack. The late start and rugged terrain, more than enemy opposition, held Yancey's gains on 23 May to little more than , well short of Habaejae. In the 3rd Division zone, the 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry, occupied the remainder of the pass north of Soksa-ri on 23 May while General Soule maneuvered other units of his \\"corps\\" forward for the advance toward the road junction east of Habaejae. The 65th Infantry Regiment took position west of the 7th Infantry while the ROK 9th Division brought up the rear in reserve. All contacts during the day were with KPA rearguards covering the PVA 81st Division and 93rd Regiment, 31st Division, as they withdrew to Habaejae. It was obvious, especially in the I and IX Corps' zones, that a head start and fast marches so far had allowed the main enemy bodies to withdraw well out of the reach of the counterattack. General Van Fleet was nevertheless confident that his forces, because of the light opposition to their advance, still had a better than even chance of blocking the enemy's main withdrawal routes and on 24 May pressed Milburn, Hoge and Almond to quicken the pace of their attacks to seize their road center objectives. Van Fleet saw a particularly good opportunity to trap and destroy forces of the KPA II, III and V Corps and PVA 12th, 20th and 27th Armies in the area east of Route 24 with a squeeze by X Corps and ROK I Corps. Once General Almond had captured the Yanggu-Inje area, he was to mount an attack northeast along Route 24 to the coast in concert with a northwestward drive by General Paik Sun-yup's ROK I Corps forces. Success would depend on the speed of the two-pronged advance, especially on a rapid attack by X Corps to block enemy avenues of escape. General Milburn attempted to hurry I Corps with orders for a top-speed move to Line Kansas. Driving up Route 3 ahead of the general advance, the 89th Heavy Tank Battalion and a battalion of the 27th Infantry Regiment blocked the road hub on 25 May, and all three of Milburn's divisions reached Line Kansas on 27 May. But the attack, as from the outset, was a fruitless pursuit. Easily outstripping Milburn's forces, all major enemy formations on the I Corps front had withdrawn above the 38th Parallel in the east and across the Imjin River in the west. =Chuncheon= The IX Corps' objective on 24 May was Line Topeka, which in the 7th Division's new zone on the east wing lay just above Chuncheon. Aiming to ease the division's attack and thus accelerate its coming move on the Hwacheon road center, General Hoge ordered General Claude Ferenbaugh to lead with a armored drive up Route 29 into Chuncheon. Following Ferenbaugh's instructions that the 32nd Infantry Regiment operating in the area straddling the road send a strong tank-infantry patrol to develop enemy defenses in Chuncheon and check the Soyang River above town for crossing sites, the commander of the 32nd shaped a small task force from the attached 7th Reconnaissance Company, a platoon of the regimental tank company, and a squad of engineers to be led by the reconnaissance company commander, Capt. Charles E. Hazel. Task Force Hazel set out under orders simply to reconnoiter the Chuncheon area and return to regimental lines. below Chuncheon Task Force Hazel came under heavy small arms and machine gun fire from hills around the village of Sinjom-ni (), where Route 29 began climbing to Wonch'ang pass cutting through the southern rim of the Chuncheon basin. The PVA 60th Army had set a regiment in blocking positions along with winding stretch of road from Sinjom-ni through the pass, but had not employed antitank weapons. His battalion not yet displaced far enough forward to be within range, the artillery observer with Captain Hazel was unable to adjust fire onto the hills. After return fire on the hillsides by Hazel's gunners found few marks, Hazel ordered back the members of his force riding in thin-skinned jeeps and halftracks and continued up the road with eleven tanks. Once through the twisting pass under a hard but harmless pelting by rifle and machine gun fire, the armored column barreled into the Chuncheon basin and drove into the center of town late in the afternoon. Fanning out in twos and threes, Hazel's tankers searched the city and both sides of the Soyang, killing, capturing, or routing about a hundred PVA and punishing a large force discovered running off the back side of Hill 302 hugging Chuncheon on the northeast. In a scramble to get away from the probing tanks, the PVA made no attempt to return fire. As his tank crews cleared Chuncheon, Captain Hazel received orders from his regimental commander to remain in town for the night. Two platoons of the regimental tank company were to reinforce him and bring along a resupply of rations, gasoline, and ammunition. Hazel took his force to the airstrip at the western edge of town where the flat ground allowed good fields of fire. While circling his tanks into a tight perimeter, he was asked by regiment if General Ferenbaugh was with him. The division commander, his aide, and escorts had started up Route 29 in two jeeps some time earlier to contact Hazel's force, but there had been no word from the general since late afternoon. Hazel knew nothing of Ferenbaugh's whereabouts but could have correctly guessed that he had run into trouble at Sinjom-ni. Ferenbaugh and his group had come under the guns of the PVA blocking force about 16:30. PVA fire swept the jeep carrying the escorts, leaving two dead and a third wounded sprawled in the road, and chased the general, his aide, and driver to cover and concealment among rocks and foliage on a hillside to the east. A division psychological warfare team en route to Chuncheon to broadcast a surrender appeal came on the scene three hours later and turned back to the lines of the 32nd Infantry, where they reported the ambush to 1st Lt. Ivan G. Stanaway, a platoon leader of the regimental tank company then lining up his platoon on the road to join Task Force Hazel. Taking his tanks forward immediately, Lieutenant Stanaway picked up the wounded escort and determined where the general was. Stanaway's crews found space to turn around and parked as close to the hillside as possible. There, under a peppering of small arms and machine gun fire, they buttoned up and waited until full dark, when Ferenbaugh and the men with him worked their way one at a time to Stanaway's tank and got in through the escape hatch. The three reached safety behind the 32nd Infantry's lines around 21:00. Amid, and perhaps because of, the anxiety caused by the disappearance of General Ferenbaugh, Task Force Hazel shortly before dark received withdrawal orders relayed from division headquarters. With the Sinjom-ni-Wonch'ang pass stretch of the road bordered by PVA, the prudent move was to pull the force below the PVA blocking position for resupply. Hazel again worked his column through PVA fire in the pass without harm except to prisoners riding atop the tanks, all but one of whom were hit. Hazel lost two tanks farther down the road, one that its crew put out of commission when it ran out of fuel, another that tumbled off the road into a deep gully in the darkness. At 32nd Infantry headquarters Hazel learned that his force, enlarged as arranged earlier, was to return to Chuncheon the next morning with a battalion of the 17th Infantry Regiment, coming out of division reserve, following to clear the PVA out of the pass and join the task force in town. Though not the operation General Hoge had in mind, Hazel's foray on 24 May had accomplished more than simply run some PVA out of town: Hazel's reinforced column returned to Chuncheon early on 25 May without encountering PVA along the road or in town. Air observers scanning the ground above Chuncheon after daylight found over ten thousand PVA jamming Route 17 and the secondary roads and trails leading to it. To the west and northwest of town they sighted another large mass of PVA, which they estimated in the thousands, moving through the ground between Route 17 and the Kap'yong- Chiam-ni road. Assuming that the tanks of Task Force Hazel entering Chuncheon on the 24th were the point of a large attack force following, the main PVA bodies had begun to swarm north during the night, to escape through Hwacheon town. =Chiam-ni and Hwacheon= Artillery fire and air strikes hit the retreating PVA from midmorning on added to the disorder of their withdrawal. By 09:30 General Ferenbaugh had the full 17th Infantry motorized and en route to Chuncheon, whence about midday the regiment attacked north as the pursuit force following the PVA cramming Route 17 and as the right arm of an encircling move to bottle the PVA sighted to the west and northwest of town. Reaching around these forces on the west was the 21st Infantry Regiment moving up the Kap'yong-Chiam-ni road in the 24th Division zone. The juncture of the two regiments in the Chiam-ni area would block the PVA retreat, and by dark the two forces were within of doing so. Earlier, at midday, air observers located forces of the 12th and 15th Armies coming out of the X Corps' zone. The observers reported some 10–12,000 troops and numerous vehicles and artillery pieces moving in long columns through the ground below the Hwacheon Reservoir and heading northwest toward Hwacheon town. Artillery and an entire fighter group attacked these columns while General Hoge moved to strengthen his attack to seize the Hwacheon town-Hwacheon Reservoir road center and block their escape. Hoge's orders, issued early on 26 May, called for the bulk of the ROK 6th Division, which was being pinched out of its central zone by the converging attacks of the 17th and 21st Regiments, to move to the Corps' east flank and advance with the 7th Division to seize the road center. Leaving the 19th Regiment in the central zone to attack directly toward Chiam-ni until pinched out, General Chang Do-yong assembled the remainder of his division in the Chuncheon area in preparation for a move up on the side of the 7th Division on 27 May. The spearhead 17th and 21st Regiments joined forces near Chiam-ni early on 26 May while in the general IX Corps' advance the ROK 19th Regiment, 6th Division pushed north through scattered resistance and reached positions within of Chiam-ni. Three regiments thus penned the PVA between Route 17 and the Kap'yong-Chiam-ni road in a rough triangle formed by the two roads and the South Korean line. Heavy, low-hanging clouds held aircraft on the ground all day, but artillery fire pummeled the PVA continuously. While concentrating on trapping the PVA group, the 17th Infantry sent a tank- infantry patrol up Route 17 toward Hwacheon. below the town the patrol discovered the rear of the PVA force observed passing through that area the day before. The score for the day was thus one PVA force cornered and another, somewhat larger, lost. As the 21st Infantry completed its advance to Chiam-ni, the regimental headquarters company and the medical company set up a joint perimeter away from any of the rifle companies southwest of Chiam-ni. Some three hundred PVA attacking northwest after midnight against the arc of the perimeter manned by the medical company were thrown back with heavy casualties. Survivors withdrew to nearby high ground and sprayed the perimeter with machine gun fire, lifting it from time to time through the night as more PVA moved forward to attack. Each assault was turned back in close fighting. The 5th Infantry Regiment, arriving from the south around dawn, broke up the last force of PVA to approach the perimeter. The defending forces lost two killed and twenty wounded during the repeated attacks. PVA losses were 300 killed, an estimated 250 wounded and 450 captured. Other PVA groups in battalion strength attempted to punch their way north out of the trap during the early morning of 27 May, but were knocked back by the forces blocking the way in the Chiam-ni area. After these failures there were no more organized efforts to escape, only confused clumps of PVA moving around in search of a way out. While the 17th and 21st Regiments turned north to join the general Corps' advance, mop-up operations by the 5th Infantry and ROK 19th Regiment, 6th Division raised the prisoner toll to around two thousand. During a final sweep of the area by the 5th Infantry on 28 May, PVA taken captive, many of whom surrendered in large groups, brought the total to nearly 38,000. Action in the general Corps' advance was concentrated along Route 17 where PVA fought hard to hold open the Hwacheon town-Hwacheon Reservoir escape route for the columns moving northwest out of the ground below the reservoir. Rain and heavy clouds that had kept aircraft on the ground finally lightened in the afternoon of 27 May, allowing air strikes along with artillery fire to take a heavy count of the PVA scurrying to get above Hwacheon. The 17th Infantry meanwhile fought up Route 17 through stubborn resistance and entered Hwacheon at 14:00, but a division of the PVA 20th Army blocked the regiment's attempts to advance north of town and east toward the reservoir. The ROK 6th Division moving up on the right out of the Chuncheon area met no opposition, but advanced only a few miles through the rough ground below the western reaches of the reservoir. Much of the PVA/KPA's gateway to safety thus remained open. On 28 May air observers reported the ground below the reservoir all but empty of PVA/KPA forces, and the ROK 6th Division's move to the lake's western edge confirmed the PVA escape. The division of the 20th Army deployed north and east of Hwacheon town and another division encountered on the fronts of the 24th and ROK 2nd Divisions to the west meanwhile showed well-organized defenses and a determination to resist any further IX Corps' advance toward the Iron Triangle. Although IX Corps had gained its road center objective too late to trap the PVA coming from the X Corps' zone, the overall estimate of enemy casualties during the Corps' counterattack, including the last three days of May, exceeded 62,000. Smaller losses during the Chinese offensive raised the Corps' estimate to more than 73,000, of which 44,705 were reported killed, 19,753 wounded, and 8,749 captured. During all of May, IX Corps' units themselves suffered 341 killed, 2,011 wounded and 195 missing. =X Corps advance to the Soyang= On 24 May General Almond ordered for an armored attack up Route 24 by the 2nd Division to seize the Umyang-ni bridge site on the Soyang. Almond directed General Ruffner to assemble a task force of two tank companies, an infantry battalion, and engineers at Han'gye and start up the road at noon. He instructed Ruffner to place the task force under the commander of the division's 72nd Tank Battalion, Colonel Brubaker, then in the P'ungam-ni area where his headquarters and one company had been with Task Force Yoke and Task Force Able. Ruffner was pressed for time to open the operation within the few hours Almond allowed. While having Colonel Brubaker flown to Han'gye, Ruffner assigned the mission to the 187th RCT, already operating along Route 24, and the two nearest tank companies; B of the 72nd, already attached to the regiment, and B of the 64th, a 3rd Division unit given to the 2nd Division earlier in one of the many unit shifts made under Corps' orders. General Bowen selected his 2nd Battalion for the operation and placed his executive officer, Col. William Gerhardt, in command of the task force. Despite all the haste, it was almost 11:00 by the time Colonel Brubaker reached General Bowen's command post, 12:30 before Colonel Gerhardt issued final instructions, and 13:00 when Brubaker started the armored point of the task force up Route 24. The point commander, Maj. Charles A. Newman of Brubaker's staff, led his tank platoon, engineer platoon, and reconnaissance squad up the road slowly, as directed by Colonel Gerhardt, with engineers in the lead probing for mines. Around 14:00 Major Newman halted his tanks about above Han'gye while engineers checked the road ahead and while he took time to correct faulty radio communications with the reconnaissance squad. Arriving over the scene by helicopter, General Almond, already unhappy over the tardy start of the operation, landed to learn the reason for the halt. He ordered Newman to forget communications, to move his tanks at an hour, and to \\"keep going until you hit a mine.\\" As Newman took his tanks forward in fifth gear, Almond flew south to check on the main body of the task force, which he found still forming. Exploding with impatience, he ordered Colonel Gerhardt to get the tanks moving whether or not they had infantry support. When getting trucks out of the way and getting the last tanks out of the streambed onto the road took even more time, Almond relieved Brubaker of his battalion command. Despite pressure from the general, it was midafternoon before the tanks started forward with the rest of the task force following. Major Newman's point force drove rapidly through clumps of Chinese visibly rattled by the appearance of tanks and came upon the rear of some four thousand PVA scrambling north under punishing air attacks about below Umyang-ni. Finding room to deploy in a skirmish line, Newman's tank crews opened fire with all weapons as PVA broke for the hills on both sides of the road or fled north across the Soyang, leaving behind a litter of dead, supplies, pack animals, and vehicles. By 16:30 Newman's tankers entered Umyang-ni and took up positions to continue firing on enemy groups scurrying for safety both below and above the river. By the time the main body of Task Force Gerhardt arrived two hours later, Newman's unit was in full possession of the bridge site. With the Task Force Gerhardt occupying the lower bank of the Soyang, General Almond late on 24 May issued instructions for attacks to carry out General Van Fleet's earlier order for the two-pronged trap by X Corps and ROK I Corps. Coming out of Corps' reserve, the 23rd Infantry moving up Route 24 on the morning of 25 May was to pass through the Gerhardt force and establish a bridgehead over the Soyang, throwing a treadway bridge over the river, then was to seize Inje to block large enemy groups that air observers had sighted withdrawing up the P'ungam-ni-Hyon-ni-Inje road. Behind these groups, the 38th Infantry was to continue its pursuit. In getting within of Hyon-ni on the 24th, that regiment had had as much trouble with the roadbed giving way under its tanks and with the sharp pitch of the bordering ridges as with knots of KPA delaying forces. After the 23rd Infantry established the Soyang bridgehead, Task Force Gerhardt and the remainder of the 187th RCT were to assemble under Corps' control just south of Umyang-ni to form Task Force Baker for a rapid drive over Route 24, beginning on the morning of 26 May, to seize Kansong () on the coast. The 2nd Division, less the 9th Infantry, which General Almond ordered into Corps' reserve and replaced in the area between Route 24 and the P'ungam-ni-Hyon-ni-Inje road with the ROK 5th Division, was to continue clearing its zone. At the same time, the 23rd Infantry, following Task Force Baker, was to give particular attention to preventing enemy forces from moving above the Inje-Kansong segment of Route 24. In a further remodeling, Almond dissolved Task Force Able, as previously planned, and reassigned its zone to the 3rd Division, which, with the ROK 9th and 8th Divisions still attached, was to continue clearing its wide east flank zone. On the Corps' opposite flank, the 1st Marine Division was to continue its drive along the west side of Route 24, a drive which again on 24 May had amounted to a plodding short advance, to capture the Yanggu area. As part of the operation to seize the Umyang-ni bridge site and subsequently the Yanggu- Inje area, General Almond had directed the 1st Marine Division to have a regiment follow Task Force Gerhardt up Route 24 as far as below Umyang-ni where a lateral trail intersected from the east and continued northwest toward the Soyang. Veering off at the intersection, the Marine regiment was to occupy prominent high ground west of Umyang-ni to strengthen the hold on the bridge site and to control the trail, which Almond believed enemy forces would attempt to use as a withdrawal route. General Thomas pulled the 7th Marine Regiment out of reserve for the mission, but because of a late start, a shortage of trucks and enemy resistance to the leading battalion on a hill bordering the road northwest of Chaun-ni, the regiment by nightfall was still some short of its objective. Along the east side of the road, the 187th RCT, less its battalion with Task Force Gerhardt, also had made only short advances against scattered enemy groups during the day. Thus the lateral trail, now located about halfway between the front of the Marine and airborne troops and the Gerhardt force at Umyang-ni, remained open. Shortly before dark, air observers reported about two thousand enemy troops moving west on the trail onto Route 24 and beyond. They were from PVA 12th Army units, which continued to cross the road during the night, their movement not again picked up by observers until midday on 25 May as they entered the ground below the Hwacheon Reservoir in the IX Corps' zone. To protect their passage across Route 24, the PVA 106th Regiment, 34th Division organized a deep position extending over below the road's intersection with the trail to hold off attacks from the south. With no position established to the north, the intersection was open to seizure by Task Force Gerhardt. But Colonel Gerhardt sent no forces down the road, even after all but one of twenty trucks sent back for supplies were destroyed and all but two of the drivers were killed at the PVA position. Alerted by the ambush of the truck convoy, General Ruffner ordered the 23rd Infantry to move forward at daylight to clear the roadblock. At each position of the deep block, forces of the PVA 106th Regiment fought a dogged defense until virtually annihilated. Regimental tanks broke through on the road and reached Task Force Gerhardt in the afternoon, but darkness fell before the 23rd Infantry eliminated the 106th regiment and reached the intersection to stop for the night. Attacking cross-country on the west flank of the 23rd Infantry, the 7th Marines met little resistance but moved no farther than to come abreast. Behind the roadblock, PVA 12th Army forces meanwhile had continued to stream across Route 24 and up the trail to the northwest until the 106th Regiment was all but wiped out. Then they avoided Task Force Gerhardt by veering northeast, forded the Soyang, and headed toward Yanggu. The 38th Infantry's pursuit of enemy groups escaping up the road through Hyon- ni to Inje on 25 May was halted by stubborn resistance from two KPA battalions deployed at the junction with the road coming up from Habaejae below Sangam- ni. Supporting artillery battalions reached out for the PVA/KPA withdrawing behind the block, but many of the groups were already well up the road and out of range. To supply further evidence that the withdrawal was outdistancing the pursuit, the 9th Infantry, moving through its central zone until relieved by the ROK 35th Regiment, 5th Division, made almost no contact, and the reinforced 3rd Division encountered only light, scattered resistance as the 7th Infantry came up to the division's road junction objectives east of Habaejae and as attached ROK forces on the extreme east flank moved into the ground above Route 20. Still hopeful of trapping and eliminating sizable enemy groups below Route 24, General Almond urged General Thomas to accelerate the 1st Marine Division's advance on Yanggu and pressed General Ruffner to bridge the Soyang and seize Inje so that Task Force Baker could form and open its drive on Kansong. Almond also added a shallower swing to his attempt to cut off enemy forces ahead of ROK I Corps, ordering the 3rd Division to organize a reinforced regimental combat team as Task Force Charlie and send it over the road leading northeastward from the Habaejae area on the morning of 26 May to take Yangyang on the coast. There was still one opportunity to intercept a sizable enemy force. After the rain lightened enough to allow aircraft aloft in the afternoon of the 26th, observers scanned the corps zone. The Hyon-ni- Inje stretch of road and connecting roads running north and west beyond Inje remained swarming with PVA/KPA troops and vehicles. Artillery supporting the 38th Infantry was far enough forward to fire on the road up to beyond Hyon-ni, and during the remaining hours of daylight fighter-bombers attacked enemy groups in and around Inje while B-26s laced the forces between Inje and Hyon- ni with thirteen tons of bombs, all producing a high score of casualties. The pursuit of the 38th Infantry, however, came to an abrupt halt short of Hyon-ni in the face of strong rearguard action by the KPA 19th Regiment, 13th Division. Below the 38th, the 3rd Division's Task Force Charlie built around the 7th Infantry Regiment moved only toward Yangyang before minefields and a destroyed bridge blocked any further advance. To the north along Route 24, the attack of the 23rd Infantry also was stopped short. Sweeping one enemy group off high ground bordering Route 24 below Umyang-ni, the regiment reached and crossed the Soyang before midday. Leaving a battalion to protect engineers while they bridged the river during the afternoon, Colonel Chiles sent the remainder of his regiment toward Inje. But the advance ended some from the town when stubborn KPA 12th Division forces held blocking positions until well past dark. A swifter advance was clearly required if enemy passage through the Inje road center was to be blocked and any substantial part of the PVA/KPA throng on the Hyon-ni-Inje road rolled up from the south. The PVA 27th Army was already above Route 24 en route through the area above the Hwacheon Reservoir to take position behind the 20th Army along Route 17, and KPA V Corps was beginning to organize defenses between the reservoir and the outskirts of Inje. The latter's 6th Division entering the Yanggu area would oppose the 1st Marine Division, which on 26 May was still moving forces up to the Soyang for its attack on the town. As the 23rd Infantry had discovered, the 12th Division was coming in alongside the 6th to defend the ground reaching east to Inje. Still on the road below Inje, the 32nd Division was to move into a Corps' reserve position. Farthest south on the road, the KPA II Corps planned to deploy the 27th Division around Inje, the 2nd Division next to the east, and the 13th Division, currently covering the Corps' rear, on the east flank. Other than this jam of KPA troops between Hyon-ni and Inje, the only PVA/KPA forces still below Route 24 were stragglers and isolated groups that had become separated from their units in the confusion of the withdrawal. Urging speedy attacks to bag the PVA/KPA forces remaining below Route 24, General Almond directed Task Force Baker to lead the attack on Inje on 27 May, leaving bypassed enemy troops to the left and right of the road to the following 23rd Infantry, and to be prepared to proceed to Kansong in coordination with the advance of ROK I Corps toward the same objective. Since General Paik's forces had entered Yangyang on 26 May, Almond meanwhile canceled the Task Force Charlie attack toward the town. Rain during the morning of 27 May and heavy low clouds throughout the day limited flights by air observers, but they were able to confirm a continuous PVA/KPA exodus to the north. They reported one group of some seven thousand moving along the Hyon-ni-Inje road ahead of the 38th Infantry. The regiment pursued with tanks on the road and an infantry battalion moving overland on each side. The remaining battalion was to move up after Hyon-ni was taken and, with the tanks, push on to Inje. But KPA blocking positions and minefields covered by fire so slowed the advance that Hyon-ni was not occupied until dusk, and the drive on Inje was postponed. On Route 24, Task Force Baker fought through stubborn resistance and entered Inje at 14:30, but it was evening before the task force and two battalions of the following 23rd Infantry cleared the town. No time remained for the task force to drive on toward Kansong. To the west, the 7th Marines crossed the Soyang River to open the 1st Marine Division's northward attack to seize Yanggu, but though the regiment encountered only scattered enemy groups, it was still from the town at nightfall. =Operation Piledriver= Since it was obvious by 27 May that the slowness of the Eighth Army in seizing its road center objectives had allowed most major PVA units, mangled as they were, to escape entrapment, General Van Fleet laid out Operation Piledriver to extend the reach of the counterattack. In the west, I and IX Corps were to seize Line Wyoming to cut PVA/KPA lines of communication at the base of the Iron Triangle and to block the main roads running southeast out of the triangle toward the Hwacheon Reservoir and Chuncheon. The weight of the western attack was to be in the I Corps' zone. Reinforced by the 3rd Division and its attached ROK 9th Division, to be transferred from X Corps, and backed up by the 187th RCT, also to be taken from X Corps and placed in army reserve in Seoul, General Milburn was to seize the Ch'orwon-Kumhwa area. In a narrowed IX Corps' zone, General Hoge's forces were to occupy commanding ground beyond Hwacheon town to block the roads reaching southeast out of Kumhwa. East of the reservoir, after completing operations to capture the Yanggu-Inje area and reach Kansong on the east coast, X Corps and ROK I Corps were to seize and establish defensive positions along a newly drawn segment of Line Kansas running northeast from the reservoir across the southern rim of a hollow circle of mountains aptly called the Punchbowl to the coastal town of Kojin-ni (), above Kansong. Following generally the same prominent ridge traced by earlier phase lines in the sector, the new Kansas segment lay well above Route 24. Once on the adjusted line, both Corps could use the road as their main supply route and, in addition, could receive supplies through the port at Kansong. Van Fleet had in mind another use for Kansong as part of an operation he planned to open on 6 June to isolate and destroy PVA/KPA forces who had succeeded in withdrawing above Route 24 into the area northeast of the Hwacheon Reservoir. Under X Corps' control, part of the 1st Marine Division was to stage through Kansong for a quick shore-to-shore movement to establish a beachhead at the junction of Route 17 and the coastal road in the T'ongch'on area some to the north. The remainder of the division was to join the beachhead by moving up the coastal road. Once reassembled, the Marine division was to attack down Route 17 while IX Corps drove up the same road out of the Kumhwa area to seal off the area to the southeast. PVA/KPA forces caught in the trap were then to be systematically destroyed. Van Fleet needed General Ridgway's approval for an operation of these proportions beyond Lines Kansas and Wyoming, and on 28 May he made that request, urging in his message that the \\"potentiality of enemy defeat should override any objections. Unconvinced that such was the case, Ridgway flew to Seoul late on the 28th. There he presented to Van Fleet all of the reasons why the T'ongch'on operation should not be undertaken. The sum of his reasons was that the possible benefits of the operation did not justify the risks entailed. The Eighth Army's mission, he reminded Van Fleet, was to exact maximum enemy losses at minimum cost while maintaining UN forces intact, and this mission could best be carried out in a gradual advance to Lines Kansas and Wyoming. In that connection, Ridgway did approve Van Fleet's adjustment of Line Kansas east of the Hwacheon Reservoir. Looking ahead to the time when the Eighth Army reached Lines Kansas and Wyoming, Ridgway before leaving Korea on 29 May instructed Van Fleet to prepare an estimate of the situation covering the next sixty days along with recommendations on operations. As he undertook this contingency planning, Van Fleet on 1 June directed his Corps commanders to fortify Lines Kansas and Wyoming upon reaching them and thereafter to conduct limited objective attacks, reconnaissance in force, and patrolling. On 28 May to advance I Corps' right to Line Wyoming, General Milburn planned an attack by three divisions, the 1st Cavalry Division moving along the west side of Route 33 to occupy the segment of the line slanting southwest of Ch'orwon to the Imjin River, the 3rd Division advancing on the Route 33 axis to take the Ch'orwon base of the Iron Triangle and the 25th Division attacking astride Route 3 to seize the triangle's eastern base at Kumhwa. In the IX Corps' zone, General Hoge also organized a three-division attack to occupy the Wyoming trace reaching southeastward from Kumhwa to the Hwacheon Reservoir. Nearest Kumhwa, the ROK 2nd Division and the 7th Division were to seize Wyoming objectives along and above the stretch of Route 17 leading northwest into the Iron Triangle from Hwacheon town. On the right, the ROK 6th Division was to advance above the western half of the Hwacheon Reservoir between Route 17 and the Bukhan River. While Milburn and Hoge planned attacks to start on 3 June in the I Corps' zone and 5 June in the IX Corps' zone, forces edging above Line Kansas in preliminary advances in both Corps zones encountered stiff opposition. As General Ridgway had predicted, the PVA were determined to hold the Iron Triangle and adjacent ground as long as possible. Then drenching rains during the last two days of May began to turn roads into boggy tracks and, along with low clouds and fog, limited close air support and both air and ground observation. Two clear days followed, but as the full attacks got under way on 3 June rainstorms returned to hamper operations through the 5th. Aided by the bad weather, PVA delaying forces fighting doggedly from dug-in regimental positions arranged in depth held the advance to a crawl through 8 June, then finally gave way under the pressure and began a phased withdrawal, moving north in what air observers estimated as battalion-size groups. Against declining resistance and in drier weather, the assault divisions occupied their Line Wyoming objectives between 9 and 11 June. In the I Corps' zone, General Milburn sent tank-infantry patrols up each side of the Iron Triangle on 13 June to investigate P'yonggang at its apex. The patrols met no resistance en route and found P'yonggang deserted. The PVA defenders of the triangle had taken up positions in commanding ground northeast and northwest of the town. IX Corps' forces reconnoitering northeast of Kumhwa located PVA defenses below the town of Kumsong. Rimmed on the north by PVA and on the south by the I and IX Corps, the coveted road complex in the Iron Triangle area now lay largely unusable in no-man's land. East of the Hwacheon Reservoir, KPA forces opposing the X Corps' advance gave ground even more grudgingly than the PVA in the Iron Triangle. It was the end of May before the 1st Marine Division captured Yanggu and longer before other Corps' forces completed mop-up operations in the ground east of Inje and Hyon-ni. Two regiments of Marines moved north of Yanggu on 1 June, but only on the 4th could General Almond open a coordinated attack by the 1st Marine Division and ROK 5th Division toward Line Kansas and the Punchbowl some above the Corps front. By that date ROK I Corps, advancing three divisions abreast along the east coast, had driven through spotty resistance and occupied its Line Kansas segment slanting across the first high ridge above Route 24. Having far outdistanced X Corps, General Paik was obliged to defend his inland flank in strength against the possibility of PVA/KPA attacks from the direction of the Punchbowl. The attack to the Punchbowl involved General Almond's forces in some of the most difficult conditions of combat. In some areas, sharply pitched axial ridges limited advances to extremely narrow fronts; in others, repetitions of steep transverse ridges forced assault troops to make arduous climbs and descents over and over again. The two main arterial roads, through the Sochon River valley in the west and the Soyang River valley in the east, were heavily mined. Other access roads, the few that existed, winding through the mountains were narrow and required substantial engineering work before supply trucks could use them. Spates of rain frequently caused landslides that blocked the roads or so slickened them that trucks skidded off at hairpin turns. From time to time the rain and fog limited air support and observation. Most difficult of all were the KPA defenders. They were in well organized fortified positions on every ridge; they gave no ground voluntarily; and, after losing a position, they counterattacked quickly in an attempt to regain it. On 8 June General Almond widened his attack, inserting a regiment of the ROK 7th Division on the left to clear the ground above the eastern half of the Hwacheon Reservoir while the 1st Marine Division concentrated on taking the lower lip of the Punchbowl and the segment of Line Kansas astride the Sochon River valley to the southwest. Accordingly, General Gerald C. Thomas, the Marine division commander, committed his reserves on the 9th so that he had four regiments in the attack. First to slug through the bitter KPA resistance was the regiment of the ROK 7th Division, which reached Line Kansas on 10 June. The Marines and ROK 5th Division took a week longer to gain full possession of their objectives. With the seizure of Line Wyoming and the adjusted segment of Line Kansas in the east, the Eighth Army had reached its allowed limit of general advance in support of efforts to open cease-fire negotiations. As yet there had been no clear sign that Chinese and North Korean authorities favored that kind of resolution, but there had been a search for a way to open armistice talks. Aftermath On 9 June Van Fleet offered Ridgway several plans for limited offensive action to keep PVA/KPA forces off balance, three of which he proposed to execute immediately after the Eighth Army reached Lines Kansas and Wyoming. Each of the three called for a raid on enemy troops and supplies within a specific area. In the west, a division was to hit Kaesong, the ancient capital of Korea on Route 1 some above the Imjin. In the central region, an armored task force was to attack P'yonggang at the apex of the Iron Triangle and the 1st Marine Division was to make an amphibious landing at T'ongch'on and attack southwest over Route 17 to join Eighth Army lines at Kumhwa. Ridgway agreed with Van Fleet's concept of holding the Eighth Army along the Kansas-Wyoming front and punishing enemy forces with limited attacks, but refused the 1st Marine Division operation, presumably for the same reasons he had refused Van Fleet's earlier T'ongch'on landing proposal. He approved the other attack plans, but they were to be executed only if intelligence confirmed that worthwhile targets existed in the Kaesong and P'yonggang areas. Ridgway then requested recommendations on the best location for the Eighth Army during a cease-fire, Van Fleet recommended Line Kansas because of its suitability for a strong defense, however, he pointed out that since a cease-fire agreement might require opposing forces to withdraw several miles from the line of contact to create a buffer zone, the Eighth Army must be well forward of Line Kansas at the time an agreement was reached. Ridgway agreed that Line Kansas would be the best location for the Eighth Army if armistice negotiations started soon and assured Van Fleet that if possible he would advise him of forthcoming negotiations in time to allow him to move at least part of his forces to a line of contact above Kansas. At the same time, since remaining behind a self-imposed line could prove exceedingly costly if the PVA/KPA leadership refused to negotiate or if they protracted negotiations while they prepared a major offensive, Ridgway directed his own planning staff to explore, as a long range matter, the feasibility and possible profits of penetrating more deeply into North Korea. The staff considered various schemes of maneuver, selecting objective lines on the basis of whether they could be held as cease-fire lines and weighing in particular the logistical problems that would attend advancing to them. Of several concepts developed, Ridgway favored one posing a three-phase offensive to occupy the Pyongyang-Wonsan line. The first phase called for an advance on Wonsan in two columns, one moving up the east coast road, the other over the Seoul-Wonsan axis. In the second step, an amphibious force was to land at Wonsan to assist the overland advance. In the finale, Eighth Army forces would drive northwestward and seize Pyongyang. Ridgway passed the outline to Van Fleet and instructed him to submit detailed plans for the operation by 10 July. Ridgway had had his planning staff plot an outpost line above Line Kansas and a \\"cease-fire\\" line another ten miles forward. By occupying the deeper line the Eighth Army would be able to make a ten-mile withdrawal from the line of contact, a withdrawal that an armistice agreement might require and still retain its Kansas positions and a suitable outpost line of resistance. On 25 June Ridgway sent a staff officer to Korea to get Van Fleet's views on seizing the proposed cease-fire line. Two weeks earlier Van Fleet had considered such an Eighth Army advance essential, but now, in view of the recent hard fighting to reach the Iron Triangle and the Punchbowl, he advised against the deeper move as potentially too costly. On 26 June Ridgway went to Korea, where after further discussing the matter with Van Fleet he agreed that while a deep advance was tactically and logistically feasible, the price would not be worth the results. On 30 June as instructed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Ridgway broadcast a message to the Chinese and North Korean leadership to open ceasefire negotiations. The following day the Chinese and North Korean leadership broadcast their acceptance of ceasefire negotiations to take place at Kaesong starting on 10 July. As the first armistice conference convened, combat operations continued at the diminished pace that had set in after the Eighth Army ended its general advance at Lines Kansas and Wyoming. Since that time, Eighth Army forces had conducted only extensive patrolling and a few limited attacks, the two largest an unsuccessful attempt in the X Corps' sector to establish an outpost on the western rim of the Punchbowl and a successful attempt in the I Corps' sector to clear the Iron Triangle of PVA who after mid-June had crept back into the Sobang Hills, an island of mountains within the triangle. Otherwise, Eighth Army was preoccupied with developing defenses along the Kansas-Wyoming Line. As directed by General Van Fleet, Line Kansas was being organized as the main line of resistance with defensive positions arranged in depth and elaborately fortified. Forces deployed on the looping Line Wyoming were developing hasty field fortifications from which to delay and blunt the force of enemy attacks before withdrawing to assigned main line positions. To deepen the defense further, patrol bases were being established ahead of the Kansas-Wyoming front on terrain features dominating logical enemy approach routes. To prevent PVA/KPA scouts reconnoitering Eighth Army defenses, the battle area was being cleared of Korean civilians from behind Line Kansas northward to the line of patrol bases. Lending haste to the preparation of defenses was an expectation that the PVA/KPA would use the respite from Eighth Army pressure to rehabilitate their units and reconstitute an attack force quickly. Familiar signs of enemy attack preparations had appeared: main forces were off the line for refitting; screening forces on the periphery of the Kansas-Wyoming Line vigorously opposed the Eighth Army's ground reconnaissance; supplies were moved into forward dumps; and some prisoners mentioned a forthcoming \\"Sixth Phase Offensive.\\" By early July the Eighth Army intelligence officer was predicting an enemy offensive anytime after midmonth. He revised his estimate after armistice negotiations started, predicting then that there would be no enemy attack unless the negotiations failed, but he expected a continuation of PVA/KPA offensive preparations.

Established in 1927, it was incorporated in the Gazi University as the Gazi Faculty of Education in 1982. Secondary education in Turkey Enacted in the Ottoman Empire in 1913, the \\"Temporary Law on Elementary Education\\" (, ) added secondary schools (, ) to the six-year lasting primary education. In 1924, right after the proclamation of the Republic, the primary education was shortened to five years, and apart from this a three-year secondary education was established. With other words, the secondary schools, closed in 1913, were re-established. In this way, the general education system was regulated as five-year primary school, three-year secondary school and three-yesr high school. Teacher's schools The \\"Law on the Organization of Education\\" (), enacted on 22 March 1926, provided for the establishment of teacher's schools as primary teacher's schools, village teacher's schools, middle teacher's schools and high teacher's schools. From 1927 on, kindergarten teacher's schools and vocational teacher's schools were added. In the 1974–75 term, primary teacher's schools were closed. Teachers of primary schools were educated two years instead as class teachers in institutes for education. The number of those tootled to 49 in the 1977–78 term. The graduates of the middle teacher's schools could serve as teacher in the primary schools, village schools and secondary schools, as primary education inspector as well as head teacher in primary schools. Gazi Institute for Education The Gazi Institute for Education was established under the name \\"Orta Muallim Mektebii ve Terbiye Enstitüsü\\" (literally: Middle Teacher's School and Education Institute) starting its education only in the Turkish language and Literature field with 16 boarding students in Ankara on 1 March 1927. In 1929, its name was changed to \\"Gazi Orta Muallim Mektebi ve Terbiye Enstitüsü\\" in honor to President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk 's (in office 1923–1938) honorific title \\"Gazi\\". The institution was renamed to \\"“Gazi Eğitim Enstitüsü\\" in 1976. It was incorporated into Gazi University in 1982. In the following years of foundation, other branches were added. So, to the Pedagogy in the 1927–28 term, History-Geography, Mathematics, Physics- Chemistry-Biology in the 19331 term, Drawing-Handcraft, Physical Education in the 1932–33 term, Music in the 1937–38 term, French language in the 1941–43 term, English language in the 1944–45 term, Combined Lessons in the 1946–47 term and German language in the 1947–48 term were added. The Special education branch was closed in 1955, and its function was incorporated into the Pedagogy branch. In the 1967–68 term, the duration of branches with two year were increased to three years. Beginning with 1944, institutes for education were opened also in other cities of the country. Those institutes were Ankara-Gazi, Istanbul-Atatürk, Balıkesir-Neacti, Izmir-Buca, Bursa, Konya-Selçuk, Samsun, Trabzon-Fatih, Erzırım-Kazım Karabekir, Eskişehir, Adana, Uşak, Edirne, Isparta, Gaziantep, Hatay, Diyarbakır and Nazilli. However, their number of branches were generally less than of Gazi Institute for Education. In the 1977–78 term, the total number of branches were 18. Campus At its foundation, the institution was temporarily housed in the building of closed religious orders in Konya because there was no suitable building in Ankara. The following year, it moved into the recently completed building of the Ministry of National Education in Ankara. One year later in 1928, the Ministry of National Education was moved to the evacuated building of Ankara Male Teacher's School of Primary Education. Its original new building was assigned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to host the King of Afghanistan Amanullah Khan (reigned 1926–1929) with his spouse during his state visit to Turkey as the guest of Mustafa Kemal ATatürk. The Middle Teacher's School (), as the institution was called at that time, was moved to the insufficient building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The building of \\"Child Protection Corporation\\" () was then used as a dormitory for the boarding students. Detail from the Gazi Eğitim Enstitüsü building, today the Rectorate of Gazi University. With the initiative of Minister of National Education Mustafa Necati (in office 1925–1929), a building was built on a land covering purchased from the Atatürk Forest Farm to a symbolic price. The building was designed by the architect, Mimar Kemaleddin (1870–1927), as his latest work. It was designed in the style of First national architectural movement, which combines classical elements of Ottoman and Seljuk architecture in the construction of modern buildings. At the groundbreaking ceremony, it was decided that the name of the institution to be prefixed with \\"Gazi\\" after the inauguration of the building. Completed in two and half years, the construction cost 1.746 million Turkish lira. As a comparison, the budget of the Ministry of National Education was about 8–10 million Turkish lira at that time. The building was designed to house 500 boarding students. The campus was located around far from the city center Ulus in an arid landscape. The highly- needed landscaping was carried out by planting of vegetation after drilling of artesian aquifers. In later years, buildings for physical education (1932–36) and music (1937–38) were added. So the gym, designed by Austrian-Swiss architect Ernst Arnold Egli (1893–1974) and opened in 1930. After 1960, buildings, which spoiled the characteristics of the main building's architecture, were added with American aid. In 1982, the buildings at the campus were passed over to the newly-established Gazi University. The main building became the Rectorate of the university. Staff Gazi Eğitim Enstitüsü was the second higher education institution in Ankara founded in the newly proclaimed Republic after the Law School. It was a favorite educational institutor with its selected executives, faculty and students as it bore in its name the prefix \\"Gazi\\", the honorific title of Atatürk. In the 1929–30 term, the faculty consisted of three professors, six lecturers with doctor's degree from abroad, one of them a foreigner, and some ıther lecturers, who were educated abroad or rose to prominence in their career. Recruiting students Gazi Eğitim Enstitüsü was a mixed-sex education and boarding-only institution from the beginning. In later years, few day students were allowed for some branches. Applicants for the physical education branch had to be younger than 25 years of age, for all other branches not older than 30 years of age. No married women students were allowed until the boarding was abolished in 1973. Boarding students were enjoined to compulsory service for the period of one and half times of the duration of their education. Until the mid 1970s, the vast majority of the students of the institute were graduates of primary teacher's schools or village institutes. Additionally, graduates of general high schools were also admitted in limited numbers. Selection of the candidates took place through a multi-stage hard exam. Those students were coming from families in need or low-income of socioeconomic status. Almost all of the students in the branches Drawing-Handcraft, Music and Physical Education were graduates of primary teacher's schools or village institutes, which had wide opportunities for sports. High school graduates were in general not trained at the level to fulfill the requirements, they rather preferred the branches Mathematics, Science, Literature or Social Sciences. Most of the students in the Turkish language-Literature branch were also graduates of primary teacher's schools or village institutes. Admittance to the branches Pedagogy or Special Education were only for primary school teachers with at least three years of service. Graduates During its activity, Gazi Eğitim Enstitüsü educated more than 30,000 middle school teachers qualified in their branch, primary school inspectors and school heads. In the early 1960s, almost all of the province directors of national education were graduates of the institute, particularly from the Pedagogy branch. All of the primary school inspectors with diploma and 24 of the 31 village institute directors appointed until 1946 were graduates of the institute. Personnel, who served between 1950 and 2000 in the central organization of the Ministry of National Education were graduates of the Gazi Institute or other similar teacher's colleges. Graduates of the institute contributed quite much to the universities during the higher educational restructuring in 1922, 1946 and 1982. More than half of the 94 notable Turkish writers born after 1900, which are listed in the Edebiyatımızda Yazarlar Sözlüğü (\\"Dictionary of Writers in Our Literature\\") by Behçet Necatigil (1916–1979), were graduates of Gazi Institute.

He is the foster father (later father-in-law) of protagonist Barry Allen / Flash, father of Iris West, Wally West, and Jenna West. Joe works at the Central City Police Department initially as a detective, heading its metahuman task force, and later as the captain, aiding Barry in keeping Central City safe from superpowered and dangerous criminals. Martin has received positive reviews for his performance as Joe.  Fictional character biography  In season one, Central City Police Department (CCPD) detective Joe West becomes the legal guardian to his neighbor Barry Allen after the boy's mother Nora was murdered and his father Henry convicted. Joe remains convinced Henry killed Nora, despite Barry's insistence of witnessing mysterious speedsters fighting that night and pursuit of other claims of metahuman activities to establish Henry's innocence. Several year later, Joe realizes that Barry may have been right after the S.T.A.R. Labs' particle accelerator explodes and transforms Barry and other Central City individuals into metahumans. He aids in Barry's crime- fighting efforts as the costumed speedster known as the Flash and agrees to help exonerate Henry. Joe becomes one of the few who knows Barry's secret early on, alongside Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon, and he tells Barry to not reveal this secret for his daughter Iris's safety. Joe is aware that Iris and his partner Eddie Thawne have been dating, and although initially a bit upset, ultimately gives them his blessing. Joe secretly investigates S.T.A.R. Labs' director Harrison Wells. He, Barry, Caitlin and Cisco ultimately discover \\"Wells\\" is actually Eobard Thawne, Nora's killer. Joe is powerless when Eddie sacrifices himself to erase Thawne (his descendant) seemingly from existence. In season two, Joe becomes head of the CCPD's metahuman task-force, working with Cisco and Patty Spivot. He relies on Cisco's inventions to deal with superhuman criminals and becomes a mentor to the two. Joe later struggles with his disintegrated marriage when his estranged wife Francine resurfaces. He later tells Iris, who believed her mother was dead based on Joe's lies, that Francine is actually alive and a former addict. Francine reveals to Joe that she is dying of a terminal illness; Iris learns that Francine had given birth to Joe's son eight months after leaving him, and initially hides this fact from her father. Supported by Barry, Iris ultimately tells Joe about his son, Wally who eventually shows up at their home. Once they are introduced, their connection is uneasy; Joe is unsure of how to be a father to Wally, and Wally is somewhat resentful that his detective father was not there for him. But after Hunter Zolomon kidnaps Wally, father and son become close. After Wally is exposed to Harry Wells's dark matter experiment, Joe suspects he has become a metahuman. Joe gets captured during an attempt to neutralize Zolomon, however, Barry defeats Zolomon and saves the multiverse. In season three, Joe experiences radical differences after Barry creates the alternate Flashpoint timeline. Changes to Joe's life are made even after the timeline is reset, primarily that he and Iris are not speaking because Joe never said that Francine was alive. However, they settle matters after Barry reveals the timeline changes. Joe fears for Wally's life after discovering Wally's dreams as a speedster and was badly injured in the erased timeline. After Wally becomes a speedster, however, Joe eventually accepts his son's destiny thanks to H. R. Wells. He also begins to move on from his widowhood by dating Cecile Horton. After the demise of Savitar, Barry decides to atone for creating Flashpoint by entering the Speed Force, entrusting Central City to Joe and Team Flash. In season four, Joe learns that Cecile is pregnant with his child. Having a child young enough to be their grandchild causes him and Cecile to initially experience a midlife crisis. Joe and Cecile attend Barry and Iris' wedding ceremony, but it is suddenly interrupted by invaders from the Nazi- dominated Earth-X led by Dark Arrow and his Kryptonian wife Overgirl. Barry and his allies fight the invaders, while Wally takes Joe and Cecile to safety. After the deaths of Dark Arrow and Overgirl, John Diggle officiates Barry and Iris' wedding in an impromptu ceremony despite Joe's absence. When Barry is on trial after being framed for Clifford DeVoe's \\"murder\\", Joe considers framing DeVoe's wife Marlize to prove Barry's innocence, but is talked out of doing it by Ralph Dibny. After Barry is exonerated, Joe is among those who celebrate with him. When Cecile goes into labor during Barry's final battle with DeVoe, Joe stays by Cecile as Caitlin helps to deliver their child; following DeVoe's demise, he and Cecile later name their newborn daughter Jenna Marie West. His friends and family also meet Nora West-Allen, Barry and Iris' future daughter and therefore Joe's yet-to-be born granddaughter. In season five, Barry tells Joe that Nora is beginning to annoy him by spending so much time with him. Joe pacifies Barry by revealing that Nora's situation is identical to Barry's when he was a child. Joe is later held hostage by the masked serial killer Cicada, but saved due to Cisco's intervention. He later tells Iris he thinks Cicada is a father because of how he held Jenna's blanket and talked about family while holding his hostage. After Nora's relationship with Iris worsens, she decides to stay with Joe for a while. Eventually, using all the information gathered by Joe and Team Flash, detective Sherloque Wells announces Cicada's true identity: Orlin Dwyer. After the defeat of Dwyer, and his niece's alternate future self Cicada II, and the erasure of Nora from the timeline, Joe commiserates with Barry and Iris over their loss. CCPD captain David Singh, having been promoted to Chief of Police, names Joe as his replacement. In season six, Wally voices his suspicions about Iris' recent behavior to Joe; both are unaware that \\"Iris\\" is an impostor and the real one is trapped in a dimension called the Mirrorverse. Joe starts to investigate businessman Joseph Carver, who sends Ragdoll to kill him. After Joe's car is sabotaged, Singh urges him to go into witness protection; but he refuses. Following the different attacks by Ragdoll where one had Sunshine sprung from police custody and another had Cecile's life threatened, Joe accepts Singh's offer, unaware that \\"Singh\\" is actually an impostor from the Mirrorverse, and the real Singh's whereabouts unknown. Barry, having realized what happened to Iris, visits Joe and tells him about this. Following Carver's murder, Joe is released from witness protection and joins forces with Team Flash to rescue Iris from the Mirrorverse.  Other versions  * In season two, Barry meets Joe's Earth-2 doppelgänger Joseph West, a lounge singer. He does not share a close bond with his son-in-law Barry, who he blames for his daughter Iris being in the police, claiming she joined to help pay his tuition to further his forensics career, though Earth-2 Iris herself denies this. Joseph is killed when struck by Deathstorm's energy blast. * In the Flashpoint timeline of season three, Joe is an alcoholic, uncommitted to his job and preferring to stay home and drink. He is estranged from both of his children and unaware that Wally is secretly the Flash. * In a dreamworld created by the Music Meister, a gangster named Digsy Foss resembles Joe and is a rival of \\"Cutter\\" Moran, who has the likeness of Malcolm Merlyn. In addition, he has an unnamed husband who has the likeness of Martin Stein. Digsy confronts Moran outside his club and a firefight ensues, leaving no survivors. * In an alternate 2024, Joe is shown to still be grieving Iris' death and Wally's paralysis and catatonia, both caused by Savitar. He is even estranged from Barry who severed ties with him in pursuit of vengeance against Savitar.  Development  Executive producers Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg, and DC Comics CCO Geoff Johns, created the character of Joe West for the CW series The Flash. In January 2014, Jesse L. Martin was cast in the role, described as \\"an honest, blue-collar cop who is a surrogate father to Barry\\", and the biological father of Iris West. Although Barry's foster father in the comics is Darryl Frye, and Iris' father during the Bronze Age of Comic Books was Ira West, and William West since the launch of the New 52, Joe West is an original creation for the TV series. However, like Iris' family in the comics since the launch of the New 52, he and Iris were written as African-American for the TV series. Regarding Joe's relationship with Barry, Martin said, \\"When something is bothering [Barry], he will come to [Joe]. He won't go to Harrison Wells to talk about his real life. He comes to [Joe].\\" Martin also reprised his role in the TV series Supergirl (also part of the Arrowverse franchise along with The Flash) in that series' episode of the four-part crossover event \\"Crisis on Earth-X\\". In season five of The Flash, Joe made less appearances due to Martin taking a medical leave of absence after suffering a back injury, and thus Joe became an unseen character before Martin's return.  Critical reception  Reviewing the pilot episode of The Flash, IGN's Jesse Schedeen praised the dynamic between Joe and Barry, calling it \\"solid\\". In 2015, Leah Thomas of Bustle ranked Joe fifth in her list of \\"original characters who help complete DC Comics' TV Universe\\". Irina Curovic of Comic Book Resources felt that Joe lacked a clear purpose in season 3 since, unlike the first two seasons where he was an important ally for Barry in catching criminals, \\"the third season mostly used Joe for the purposes of exposition\\". She felt that for this reason, the series no longer needed him. Screen Rants Jason Berman ranked Martin eighth on his 2016 list \\"20 Best Actors in the Arrowverse\\". The following year, Katerina Daley of the same website included Joe in her list \\"7 Best (And 8 Worst) Arrowverse Characters\\", saying, \\"One of the most loving and committed fathers on television right now, Joe West portrayed with beautiful conviction by the esteemed Jesse L. Martin, is everything that a father should be.\\"  References  Category:Central City Police Department officers Category:Characters created by Geoff Johns Category:Crossover characters in television Category:DC Comics television characters Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Fictional American police detectives Category:Fictional characters from parallel universes Category:Fictional police captains Category:The Flash (2014 TV series) characters Category:Male characters in television Category:Supergirl (TV series) characters Category:Superhero television characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2014 Category:Unseen characters ","title":"Joe West (Arrowverse)"},{"id":"58044575","text":"Taffy Howard is an American politician who sits in the South Dakota House of Representatives.

Part of Atari Corp.'s 2000 series, it is a remake of the 1976 arcade game Breakout, which spawned an entire genre of Breakout clones with its concept, such as Taito's 1986 arcade game Arkanoid. It is also one of the last licensed releases for the Jaguar, after it was discontinued in 1996 by Atari Corporation, who merged with JT Storage in a reverse takeover prior to the game's launch. Featuring the same gameplay premise as with the original Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen while a ball spawned by the player's paddle travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed but the player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, players have to move the paddle left and right to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play. Breakout 2000 received mildly positive reception from the few video game magazines and dedicated outlets that reviewed the game when it launched, with critics praising the graphics, control, gameplay and two-player mode but others were divided in the audio department.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot showcasing the first phase of the game. As with other arcade remakes and updates on the Jaguar such as Tempest 2000, Missile Command 3D and Defender 2000, Breakout 2000 modifies and builds upon the gameplay of its 1976 counterpart by introducing power-ups, bonus levels, enemies, varying level designs and more. It features ten phases to play through, each one divided into five rounds and a bonus round, of which there are also two types depending on the phase, for a total of 60 levels and completing the main mode results in restarting from the first phase over again. In addition, a recreation of the original arcade game titled Breakout Classic is also included as an optional mode for play. The player can also enable a second paddle for either two-players or CPU assistance, choose between three levels of difficulty and set paddle's speed at the options screen. High-scores and other settings made by the player are kept via the cartridge's internal EEPROM. The main objective in Breakout 2000 is to break as many bricks as possible from the playfield with a single ball by using the walls and/or the paddle to ricochet the ball back at the bricks to eliminate them. Failing in making the ball rebound from the paddle results in losing the turn and once all the balls are lost, the game is over. Players now have five turns to try clearing the screen of bricks and each one have a fixed point value depending on their color, while the ball can increase its speed at specific hit intervals and the paddle shrinks to half of its size if the ball touches the upper wall in single player. The playfield now uses a behind-the- paddle perspective, with the player's paddle being positioned at the bottom and at the top for the second player respectively, with the upper wall being replaced for a warped wall on two-player mode, allowing balls to travel between the top and/or bottom of the playfield. Power-ups are dropped by drones who randomly appear on the playfield and they are divided into three categories. Stingers are enemies who shoot the player's paddle and by taking a number of hits, the paddle breaks and the ball passes through it. In later levels, some bricks are stacked on top of another one and breaking them will cause a chain reaction of the top bricks falling down to the playfield.  Development and release  Breakout 2000 was the first project developed by Mario Perdue of MP Games/L4 Software for the Atari Jaguar. Mario originally developed a game for Windows 3.1x called WalZ, which took inspiration from both Breakout and Arkanoid but it was never released due to its similarity with the former and fear of lawsuit from Atari Corporation. He worked for Atari Corp. in various projects for both Atari ST and Atari TT030 microcomputers but after dealing with health issues, he approached to Atari employee J. Patton after recovering. Patton recommended Mario to work with the Jaguar hardware and gave him a development kit for the system. Mario ported the unreleased WalZ to the Jaguar for showcase, with Atari liking it and greenlighted the project. During its development, Mario received full freedom and received possible ideas to be implemented into the game that were contributed into the final version from other Atari employees such as developer supporter Mike Fulton and third-party vice-president Bill Rehbock. Mario focused on making Breakout 2000 easily playable with a controller but he found it difficult due to the lack of paddle controllers for the Jaguar. There were plans to include support for rotary controls but it was scrapped due to the lack of them on the system. Breakout 2000 was in development as early as August 1995 and was announced on magazines the next month, in addition of being playable for outlets at Atari Corp.'s UK division and was originally scheduled for a September 1995 release, with early previews showcasing different visuals compared to the final release. The game was still in development and was later scheduled for a November 1995 release. The game was also showcased during the Fun 'n' Games Day events hosted by Atari between 1995 and 1996. In 1996, the Jaguar and games that were in development for it were discontinued by Atari Corp., who merged with JTS and filed a 10-K405 SEC Filing on April 1996. This resulted in the game not being published by Atari, despited being already completed and scheduled for a July 1996 release. Telegames later became involved with the game and licensed it from Atari for release, alongside other titles for the Jaguar. The game was released on December 9, 1996, months after the system was discontinued. By this time Telegames was the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar. Like other games published by Telegames following the Jaguar's discontinuation, Breakout 2000 was only available through direct order and a few select retailers. The cover art was created by graphic artist Gary T. Degler.  Reception  Breakout 2000 received mildly positive reception after its release.  Legacy  After finishing development on Breakout 2000, Mario Perdue started work on three other games that were intended to be used on kiddie rides manufactured by Carousel International Corporation, using Atari Jaguar consoles that were purchased from Atari as their control units across establishments such as K-Mart and Chuck E. Cheese: A helicopter shoot 'em up titled Skycopter II, a racing game titled Speedster II and a spaceship game named SpaceGuy. Speedster II was completed on December 5, 1995, a few days before Breakout 2000 was published, while Skycopter II was completed shortly after, but SpaceGuy was never released. There are conflicting reports online in regards to the status of the two completed games, with one source stating that the two kiddie rides were released to the public, while another source state that they were never released due to issues with the system's reliability on certain environments. In 2011, an independent published named Beta Phase Games, alongside The GOAT Store acquired the rights to both Skycopter II and Speedster II from Carousel Entertainment, in addition of purchasing all of their remaining Jaguar-related inventory.

The website was launched on 7 March 2018 at Constitution Club of India, New Delhi. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Ram Punyani, Teesta Setalvad, Zafar ul Islam Khan, John Dayal, Ravi Nair. Saba Naqvi and other social activists. Documentation of the Oppressed is an independent, non-profit documentation center based in New Delhi. It is run by a network of civil society organizations, both at the national and at the grass-root level like Quill Foundation, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, CHRI, People's Union for Civil Liberties and others. DOTO Database functions both as a tracker of violence, and a site for in-depth narratives. The database mixes a crowd-sourcing model with its own investigative and editorial teams.  Principles and objectives Over the years, there has been a marked increase in the violence conducted against certain sections of society. This violence manifests itself in different forms; it can be through organized and institutional violence by the State or through the actions of allied groups in furtherance of their internalized biases. The primary objective of the DOTO Database is to create a common documentation platform for the civil society to report hate crime incidents happening across India. This database documents all verifiable incidents of targeted violence against specific communities as reported in English and Urdu media as well as fact-finding and civil society reports. It also provides a platform for in-depth narratives. DOTO aims to increases media reportage through an amalgamation of a crowd-sourcing model along with its own investigative and editorial teams. It is an easy-to-use model and ultimately seeks to make essential information accessible to all. It addresses a number of issues such as the systemic violation of fundamental rights, the erosion of constitutional values and the deployment of hate towards religious minorities in India.

Her notable works include Until the Lions: Echoes from the Mahabharata, published by HarperCollins India and Arc Publications in 2015. She is India's only poet to have won a literary award for fiction for a work of poetry.  Early life and education  Karthika Naïr was born in 1972 in Kottayam, Kerala. [1] Her father was an officer in the Indian Army, so she moved around much during her childhood. She spoke in English with her father and in Malayalam with her mother, the sing-song form of which influenced her poetry. She was born with the rare and chronic genetic condition epidermolysis bullosa and was often sick and hospitalised for surgeries growing up. She stayed at home much because of her illness and engaged in reading books that her parents often bought. When she was around 16 years old, she had a feeding tube inserted into her and was subsequently unable to attend college. Instead, she began to pursue a sociology degree through the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU). Her parents worried that she would become depressed doing a long course, so they enrolled her at a course at the Alliance Française in Trivandrum, where her family lived at the time. That was also when she started writing articles for newspapers. In 1997, she began working with Alliance Française as a press attaché, and her writing was temporarily put on pause. Naïr says learning French changed the trajectory of her life. She was sent on a Ministry of Culture scholarship to France for a short course in cultural policy, where she discovered her interest in arts management, and in 2000 she returned to France to pursue a post-master's degree in Arts management. She stayed in Paris.  Works  Naïr has published both poetry and prose and written scripts for dance productions. Her poetry has been widely anthologised across the world including in Granta, Prairie Schooner, Poetry Review (UK), The Literary Review (USA), Poetry International, Indian Literature, The Bloodaxe Book of Contemporary Indian Poets and the Forward Book of Poetry 2017. = Books = * The Honey Hunter/Le Tigre de Miel (Young Zubaan, India/Editions Hélium, France, 2013) * La Zon-Mai: parcours nomades, Actes-Sud (France, 2007) (co-author) = Poetry = * Bearings (HarperCollins India, 2009) * Until the Lions: Echoes from the Mahabharata (HarperCollins India/Arc Publications UK, 2015) = Scripts = *DESH (2011) *Chotto Desh (2015) = Translations = * On the Other Side of the Shadow by Roselyne Sibille * The Shadow Rises before Me by Roselyne Sibille * The Shadow Steps Forward by Roselyne Sibille * The Shadow Moans by Roselyne Sibille * The Shadow is a Ridgeline by Roselyne Sibille * He Gazes Uncomprehendingly by Roselyne Sibille * Hope, une exposition d'art contemporain sur l'espoir. (Flammarion, 2010) (co-translator)  Process  Naïr took five years to complete Until the Lions. In an interview with The Hindu, she said, \\"The first two were devoted entirely to reading/watching/hearing material on the Mahabharata, whether regional versions, retellings, stage and film adaptations or academic papers.\\" Where she could not find source material in France, like P.K. Balakrishnan’s Ini Njan Urangatte (I Can Sleep Now), her parents read it to her over Skype. She has said in interviews that her work as a dance producer and curator influences her poetry. Poetry International says about her work: \\"The proximity to performing arts, and to dance in particular, is evident in much of Naïr's poetry, which presents a striking blend of density and mercurial fluidity.\\" Many poems in her first collection, Bearings, were ekphrastic and drew from existing performances. Naïr has been influenced by choreographers Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, Rachid Ouramdane and Gregory Maqoma, and the French opera director Patrice Chéreau.  Awards  * Tata Literature Live!

It was designed by Thomas Rowe and possibly a Mr Morrow also and built by Bryson, Leet, Johnson & Montgomery. It is also known as Chatswood South Uniting Church and Cemetery and Chatswood South Methodist Church. The property is owned by Chatswood South Uniting Church. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Rear view Bryson grave The remaining Crown land in this area was auctioned in the 1850s, marketed as an area for fruit growing and farming. The land on which the church sits was originally owned by James Mitchell, after whom the Mitchell Library in Sydney is named. Upon his death the land passed to his son, David Scott Mitchell, a medical doctor. In 1871, of this land was then purchased from David Mitchell by the trustees of the Wesleyan church, William Henry McKeown and others. Methodist services in the Artarmon area were originally conducted in the home of Mr. and Mrs. John Bryson, who lived opposite the present site of the church, at the corner of the Pacific Highway and Mowbray Road. In 1843, Wesleyan Methodist local preachers visited Lane Cove (then all North Shore) and formed a class of 12 people. In 1871 the local Methodists settled purchase of the church's land (opposite), although the sandstone church had been recently built at this time. The church was the third Methodist church to be built on the north shore. It is the earliest remaining. The architect is likely to have been Thomas Rowe, although it is much simpler than many other of his designs for this period. It had a timber shingle roof and cedar lining. Mr Morrow drew the plans for the building which was to be a stone structure. Stone was cut and carted to the site and timbers were hauled from the upper North Shore. The builders were Bryson, Leet, Johnson and Montgomery, who were all members of the congregation. James Montgomery was the stonemason for the church. On 1 July 1871, John Dawson, a prominent business man attached to the York Street Methodist Church, laid the Foundation Stone and the church was opened on 31 December 1871. The church was built in 1871 after being designed by Thomas Rowe. The church was designed in Gothic Revival style, as was usually the case with ecclesiastical buildings of that period. One of its distinctive features was a small belfry on the east side of the building. Changes and additions were carried out in 1883 and 1930. The church has a national heritage listing. The Christian Advocate of 1 August 1871 noted that: Another ceremony was held on 7 October 1883 when the transept and porch were added which meant that the space had more than doubled to a cruciform plan. In 1891 the name of the church changed from Willoughby to Chatswood. The Sunday School was built and opened in 1906. A tennis club was formed after courts were built in the south- western corner of the grounds in 1912. A second tennis court was paved in bitumen for use as a car park - year unknown. A kindergarten hall was built in 1912, but burnt down in the 1960s and was rebuilt in 1967. The primary hall was built in 1913. In 1930 the sanctuary, two vestries and a porch were added. In 1935 a new organ was installed and in 1937 the parsonage was built, designed by the architect Hedley Carr. In 1966 a bronze bell was installed in the tower. The fellowship centre was constructed in 1968 in honey-coloured brick. In 1977, the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia agreed to join the newly created Uniting Church of Australia and after 106 years as a Methodist church, this church became the Chatswood South Uniting Church. On 4 July 1971 Sir Roden Cutler, Governor of NSW and his wife unveiled a plaque here on the Centenary celebrations of Chatswood South Uniting Church. On the east side of the church is a small cemetery that was established in the early 1870s. The first person buried there was the infant Mary Elizabeth Holland. It is one of only two surviving churchyard cemeteries on Sydney's north shore. It was closed in 1924 and afterwards suffered considerably from vandalism. The cemetery was owned and maintained by the parish from its consecration in 1871 until it was handed over to Lane Cove Council in the early 1980s. It was classified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) in 1976 along with the gardens. In 1984 the cemetery was rededicated a Pioneers' Memorial Reserve. One feature of the cemetery is the camellia tree growing in the north-west corner. The story behind this tree is that in 1878 a young man by the name of Hugh Bryson was riding to Willoughby to visit his fiancée. Unfortunately, his horse shied and he was thrown to the ground and killed. In his button-hole was a camellia, which was taken by his fiancée. At his funeral, she planted the camellia in the soil over his grave and it took root, resulting in the tree that can still be seen growing alongside the Bryson graves.  Description  ;Site: The site is on a corner of a busy intersection with the Pacific Highway. The site slopes down gently from east to west and contains a scattering of large turpentine trees, possibly remnant specimens. The property boundary has been intact since purchase in 1871. A small sandstone church in simple Victorian Gothic style occupies the north-east corner of the site. A 1960s fellowship centre lies further west, adjacent to the Sunday school. A cemetery lies to the north-west. The south-west is used as a car park shaded by trees; the south-east contains the parsonage. A small graveyard lies to the west of the church, with burials dating from eighteen seventy one to nineteen twenty four, with the majority being before nineteen ten. Most monuments are of sandstone or marble and simple in design. The cemetery is not enclosed. In the south west corner of the site are tennis courts. A well kept garden surrounds the buildings, with mature trees including eucalypts, privet (Ligustrum sp.), sweet pittosporum (P.undulatum), jacaranda (J.mimosaefolia), turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera), funeral cypress (Cupressus funebris), four large camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora) (three east of church, one west of fellowship centre), and in the east facing the Pacific Highway are two Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria excelsa) and a Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis). Four brush box trees (Lophostemon confertus) line the northern side of Mowbray Road. Shrubs include oleanders (Nerium oleander), camellias (Camellia sp.) and the church walls are covered with dwarf creeping fig (Ficus pumila var. pumila). ;Church: Gothic style sandstone church with tiled roof, built in the eighteen seventies. East front flanked by a tiny belfry with a bell from the NSW Fire Brigade. The interior walls are rendered and most windows contain stained glass. The roof is lined between the timber trusses. Pews are probably original. The original architect was Thomas Rowe, although there is reference to Morrow drawing the plans. The stonework contractor was Jago. The builders were Bryson, Leet, Johnson & Montgomery, all members of the early congregation. ;Other buildings: Other buildings on site are a parsonage to the south, fellowship centre (twentieth century) to the south and west of the church, hall (twentieth century) west of that. = Condition = As at 19 January 2004, vandalism of the cemetery has been extreme. Of about 65 grave sites evident in nineteen eighty only about four have undamaged monuments. Most are repairable. The site has limited potential to yield in situ archaeological material as a result of development process that are likely to have disturbed or removed archaeological remains. There is greater potential to recover remains in the south-eastern portion of the site. The heritage significance of these remains was found by Anna London to be of moderate to high local significance. = Modifications and dates = *1883a transept and porch were added *1930sanctuary and two vestries were added, A.

Heritage listing  As at 19 January 2004, this church group is of historic, aesthetic and social significance as a fine, intact rural church, graveyard and landscaped grounds indicative of the early rural settlement of Lane Cove in the eighteen seventies. It is the oldest remaining (the third built) Methodist church on Sydney's North Shore, and the first church to be built in Lane Cove. The graveyard contains the remains of early pioneer families such as the Forsythe, Bryson and French families. It is also of aesthetic significance as a landmark on the Pacific Highway.Heritage Study, 87 Chatswood South Uniting Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

CE) was a Buddhist monk, librarian, and author during the Liang dynasty in China. Biography Baochang came from a poor family in Wu. He had to work hard in the fields to provide for himself and his parents. Because the plot of land they owned was too small to provide ample means of living, he looked around for other jobs on the side. Thus he found work as a copyist and was able to make some extra money.De Rauw, T. (2008: 199) In 483, Sengyou was ordered to go to Wu and Baochang immediately left the family life to become his disciple. After fleeing east from the chaos that accompanied the fall of the Southern Qi, he was summoned by Emperor Wu of the Liang to take up the position as abbot of the Xin'an (新安) monastery in 505 AD.De Rauw, T. (2008: 202) Baochang participated in a number of translation and cataloguing projects under imperial patronage. In 510, Baochang became very ill. Fearing the worst, he started praying, and uttered the two vows that, should he recover, he would search around for Buddhist scriptures everywhere to make sure nothing would get lost, and along the way search for records of monks of past generations to honour and perpetuate their memories.De Rauw, T. (2008: 204) In attempting to fulfill this vow he abandoned his duties as abbot and was banished to Guangzhou 廣州 for about four years, during which time he worked on his biographies. Baochang was allowed back to the capital in 514. In 515, Baochang was Commissioned by Emperor Wu to compile an official catalogue of Buddhist scriptures in the Liang Imperial library. 梁世眾經目錄 (Pinyin: Liángshì zhòngjīng mùlù) \\"A Catalog of Scriptures of the Liang Dynasty\\". This was recognised as the official catalog of the Liang Dynasty ahead of the (still extant) catalog by his teacher Sengyou from the same period (T2145). The date of his death is not known with certainty but was likely to have been around 518.De Rauw, T.

Peters (born 22 August 1957) is a professor of nanobiology and a distinguished university professor at Maastricht University. Peters is best known for his work in electron microscopy (EM) and cellular immunology.  Early life and education  Peters was born in Hunsel, the Netherlands in 1957. The eldest of six children, he often accompanied his father—a farmer—on errands. On one such visit to a local artificial insemination station, Peters discovered a keen interest in science. Peters obtained his PhD in 1991 from Utrecht University. His PhD thesis, \\"Cellular immunology at the subcellular level\\", was completed under the guidance of Hans Geuze, Jannie Borst, and Hidde Ploegh. During this time, he studied the ultrastructure and trafficking of MHC class II molecules, as well as how the role of secretory granules in T-cell function. Following his PhD, Peters completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health in the laboratory of Richard Klausner, where he studied the regulation of endocytosis.  Career  From 1994 to 1998, Peters worked at Utrecht University. He then moved on to the Netherlands Cancer Institute, where he worked from 1998 to 2013. There his group focused on sorting within the eukaryotic cell endomembrane system, primarily using cryo immunogold-electron microscopy. In 2014, Peters was appointed professor of nanobiology and co-director of the Maastricht Multimodal Molecular Imaging Institute at Maastricht University. Since 1988, Peters has collaborated with Hans Clevers, working to establish human tissue organoids from stem cells in order to study the origin and mechanism of cancer and infection. Peters’s current research goal is to devise a way of doing cryo-electron tomography in order to give a 3D view of a cell’s internal structure. His research group under M4I’s Division of Nanoscopy studies the 3D structure of an important component of the nanomachinery in bacteria causing tuberculosis.  Other professional activities  Peters hold patents for three inventions, with a fourth filed and pending.

It was completed in 1921 but is built in the style of a typical Danish white-washed village church. History Lundtofte Church was built at local initiative. The site for the church was a donation from Ørholm Grundejerforening and the land for the surrounding cemetery was donated by managing director of Brede Textile Factory Edmund Daverkosen. A driving force behind the project was pastor N. N. Sværborg and almost half of the construction cost was raised through local contributions. The new church was designed by Harald Lønborg-Jensen. The foundation stone was set in 1919 and the new church was inaugurated in 1921. Sværborg was engaged as the first pastor of the new parish in 1930. Architecture The church has white-washed walls and a red tile roof. It consists of nave. porch, tower and a chapel in its eastern end. It has seating for approximately 200 people. Furnishings The altar table and pulpit are designed in the Neo-Baroque style by Lønborg- Jensen, the church's architect. The altar piece was painted during World War II by local painter Jørn Glob. He was a member of the Danish resistance movement and wanted by the German occupying forces when it was painted. The organ was made by Frobenius' organ manufactury and has been located in the church since 1970. Its old organ is now located in Lyngby Church. Cemetery The cemetery was designed by Gudmund Nyeland Brandt. A lapidarium with historic headstones is located at the western end of the cemetery. Notable burials include painter Mads Henriksen (1853-1940) and film director and producer Finn Henriksen (1933-2008).

History =Establishment= The company was established in 1997 as Congo Minerals Inc. and set out to be a low-cost producer of magnesium from the Republic of Congo. In May 1997 it concluded an exploration research agreement with the Congolese Ministry of Mines in the Kouilou Department. The Holle Mine, a former potash producing mine, had once operated in the Kouilou area. On the corporate side, the newly established private company converted itself into a publicly traded company by conducting a reverse takeover. In October 1997 the company emerged as the Magnesium Alloy Corporation through amalgamation with Clavos Enterprises, a largely inactive publicly traded company. The executive team at this stage included Chairman and President George Creber, Executive Vice- President William Burton and Vice-President Kim Barkan. The board of directors included the three executives and Stephen Dattels and Patrick Mitchell. =Diversification= The company became engaged in business lines outside of magnesium mining and changed its name in February 2005 to MagIndustries from Magnesium Alloy Corporation to reflect its interests in \\"multiple businesses and products\\". The main asset of the company was the potash/magnesium mine in Kouilou under the MagMining division. Besides the main asset there were varied business interests under separate divisions including MagEnergy (refurbishment of the Inga II dam in the DRC); MagForestry (a 68,000 hectare eucalyptus plantation located on the surface of the area where the company held mineral rights); MagMinerals (a potash processing plant near Pointe-Noire); and MagMetals (magnesium smelter next to the potash processing plant). =Concentrating on potash= Starting in 2008, potash enjoyed the limelight as the price of the mineral and key ingredient in chemical fertilizer soared to a record high of around $1,000/tonne and remained high for most of 2009. The primary business of MagIndustries became potash rather than magnesium with namesake mineral of the company relegated to a secondary consideration. The company had announced in 2008 it was shelving the magnesium metal plant to concentrate on advancing the Mengo potash project (formerly called the Kouilou potash project). The Mengo potash project moved along rapidly in 2007-2009 with favorable developments in financing, fuel supply, marketing, tax, permitting, design and pre-construction. The feasibility study was completed in February 2008. The company entered into a mining investment agreement for the project with the Congolese government in March 2008 under which a tax holiday of 10 years was negotiated. In April 2008 it closed second tranche of a private placement that raised $100 million for the development of the Mengo potash project. These positive developments were reflected in its share price with the company becoming in 2008 the third largest mining company by capitalization on the Toronto Stock Exchange Venture Exchange. In June 2008, it received US$70 million from Ameropa Holding, the receiver of the potash and a major shareholder in the company. The project had large scale energy requirements and need a huge volume of natural gas. To that end the company signed a natural gas supply agreement with Eni to meet its requirements. =Hunt for a strategic buyer= Although it had a fair wind with high potash prices especially in 2008 and most of 2009 and pre-construction work and drilling had commenced, the company still had much difficulty in finding debt financing or the strategic partner necessary to raise the US$1.4 billion necessary to complete development of the Mengo potash project. It raised $26 million in June 2009 through issuance of new shares to tide over the continuation of Phase 1 development as finding debt financing became prolonged. Separate discussions were held with Chinese state owned enterprises in 2009-10; first with Sinohydro and then with Complant. The Chinese SOEs were attractive as strategic partners because of deep pockets through links to Chinese banks but the talks fell through in succession. Another reason for looking for a Chinese tie up according to a company executive was the lack of Western investor interest due to lack of familiarity with Republic of Congo and perception of heightened country risk. During this period, potash prices dropped precipitously starting in late 2009 with prices reaching around $500/tonne in January 2010. The company announced an investment in late 2010 with investment company TSC Capital but the proposed deal was terminated. =Acquisition by Evergreen= In 2011, Evergreen Holding Group, a private Chinese shipbuilder, purchased 76% of the shares of the company for $115 million, and became the controlling shareholder. After the acquisition, the company was kept listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. There was cause again for optimism in 2013 when the company announced in November that China Development Bank had provided a 12-month commitment to act as lead arranger in financing of US$740 million for development of the Mengou potash project. There was still a shortfall in the total funding needed to develop the project and a proposed idea was to carve out the cost of development of the port facility into a separate build-own-transfer agreement. The stock doubled towards the end of 2013 compared with the beginning of the year. =Bribery investigation and collapse= The company was investigated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for making corrupt payments to Congolese officials. Ultimately, no charges were laid by the RCMP against the company or individuals in connection to the Congolese bribery allegations. The RCMP raided the Toronto office of the company in January 2015. The company began an independent investigation after the raid and in June 2015 the internal investigation disclosed the allegations that were made against the company in the Information to Obtain Search Warrant authorizing the search of the company offices. It was alleged in the warrant, but charges were never laid, that the company had made payments and given gifts to Congolese officials including cash payments, a house, furniture, 4x4 vehicles, and ornamental stone lions. The company was unable to fund a continuation of the internal investigation and the controlling shareholder Evergreen Holding Group refused to provide the funds. Evergreen's own financial position deteriorated rapidly and defaulted on a 400 million RMB bond in May 2016. The corruption investigation and lack of funding sent the company into disarray. The company stopped filing financial reports and the stock ceased trading on the TSX. By June 2015, the board of directors involved in the corruption investigation resigned and the chief financial officer was removed. The company was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange in August 2015. Operations and plans Over the course of the company's history it became engaged in or would shelve pursuit of several areas of business organized as separate divisions in the Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of Congo. =Potash mining and plant= The prized asset of the company by the late 2000s became the Mengo potash project (formerly called Kouilou potash project). The project was developed within a 136 square km mining license area around the village of Mengo. Pursuant to the project, the company entered into an investment agreement with the Congolese government in late 2008 to construct and operate a mine within the license area for at least 25 years. In 2009, development of the Mengo potash project was in full swing under the MagMining division with the project team having commenced the pre-construction and drilling activities. A total of US$100 million had been spent on project development by 2009. The company also conducted exploration activities around the Mengo potash project. In 2009, it had acquired Potasse du Congo, a Congolese company that held three exploration licenses for potash in the areas of Makola, Loango, and Tchizalamou, all surrounding the Mengo potash project. The processing plant for the Mengo potash project was developed under the MagMinerals division. The potash processing plant was planned near Pointe-Noire with a planned capacity of 600,000 tpy. The eventual plan was for the potash and magnesium output of the mine to be recovered in the form of brine solution and then processed at both the potash plant and the next door magnesium smelter. The total development costs of the potash mine and potash processing plant were estimated at US$1.4 billion with a cost of US$723 million in the first phase. During the salad days of the project, construction was set to begin in 2009 with production commencing in 2011 and a second phase modular expansion in 2013. =Magnesium smelter= Under the MagMetals division, a magnesium smelter had been planned with a capacity of 72,000 tpy. Located next to the potash processing plant it would have processed the waste stream from the potash plant to produce magnesium and magnesium alloys. =Hydroelectric dams= The MagEnergy division engaged in the rehabilitation of four of the eight turbines of the Inga II power station, one of two Inga power stations along the Congo River in the DRC. The Inga II dam had not been refurbished since commissioning in 1982. The rehabilitation work started in 2006 with emergency repairs worth about US$24 million but the next phase a US$110 million planned overhaul never got off the ground. It was to receive 50% of the 164 MW restored capacity. Also, the division had the rights to the 250 MW Busanga hydroelectric site in the DRC's Katanga province. =Eucalyptus plantation= The company's MagForestry division oversaw the operations of a 68,000 hectare eucalyptus plantation that produced woodchips for biomass plants. The plantation was located over the surface of the area where the company held mining rights. The plantation had been acquired through transactions made in 2005-6 resulting in the complete purchase of the plantation and by 2007 the company had invested $8 million the plantation and commissioned a woodchip plant in 2008. The plantation was in good operational shape in 2009, employing 400 full-time workers and 1,500 contractors. However, by around September 2014, activity at the plantation declined to a low level. In May 2016, the Chinese Ambassador Xia Huang and Congolese Minister of Forestry Henri Djombo jointly toured the plantation to diagnose the problems. Djombo bombastically proclaimed Congolese were the inventors of eucalyptus cultivation and openly considered transferring the forestry rights held by MagIndustries to Moroccan investors.

It is located in Armyansk, Crimea. Location and geography The plant is located in Crimea, in the northern part on the Perekop Isthmus near the coast of the Sivash. It covers an area of and is connected by railroad to Vadim station on the Odessa railway. History The decision to build the Crimean State Production Association \\"TITAN\\" (KPO \\"TITAN\\") [Russian:] was made 28 Dec 1969. In 1971 a factory producing Ammonium Phosphate was commissioned; in 1973 aluminium sulfate, and water glass; in 1974 red iron oxide pigment; and by 1978 two titanium dioxide pigment plants were commissioned. In Mar 1999 the KPO \\"TITAN\\" became part of the 'Syvash economic zone' [Russian:] - this free economic zone was an initiative of the Government of Ukraine as an experiment. On 10 Feb 2000 the KPO \\"TITAN\\" was converted into the state joint stock company SJSC \\"TITAN\\" [Russian: ]. On 31 Aug 2004 the closed joint stock company \\"Crimean TITAN\\" [Russian: ] was formed comprising 50% less one share held by Ostchem Germany GmbH (controlled by Dmitry Firtash), the remaining majority held by SJSC \\"TITAN\\". After the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 a company was registered in Moscow as the private limited company \\"Titanium Investments\\" [Russian: ]; whilst the name of the plant itself was changed to \\"Ukrainian Chemical Products\\" [Russian: ], with the location of registration of the company changed from Armyansk to Kiev; and with the Moscow-based company leasing the \\"Ukrainian Chemical Products\\" plant, as well as supplying and exporting products. The plant was reliant on the production of two Ukrainian mining and enriching plants at Volnogoprsk and Irshanksy - previously these were leased by the plant but in 2014 they were transferred by the Ukrainian government to the Ministry of the Economy, and transferred to the state owned \\"United Mining and Chemical Company\\" [Russian: ]. The company remained registered as a Ukrainian enterprise, paying tax on profits in Ukraine, though local taxes were also paid in Crimea - as such the company attempted to continue to receive supplies from Ukraine, avoiding sanctions. Post-2014 the plant suffered with revenue falling by nearly three quarters (from ~$300 million in 2013 to ~$86 million in 2015). Import substitution of Ilmentite from Sri Lanka was confirmed to have begun in 2016. Other issues relating to the Ukraine-Russia-Crimea situation included a lack of water for industrial production due to restrictions on water from Ukraine to supply the North Crimean Canal. Additional wages were reported as being paid at much reduced levels. In late 2017 it was reported that the business was still suffering shortages of Ilmenite, and operating at ~40-50% capacity, and had been received ore from Norway, Sri Lanka, and Brazil. In 2017 Russian state bank VTB began bankruptcy proceedings against Titanium Investments, claiming $40 million in unpaid debts. In reaction Dmitry Firtash sought to transfer the business to a new company \\"TitanActive\\" [Russian: ], to avoid effects on the business due to the litigation. Places close to the titanium plant, namely Armyansk and Perekop, were (first reportedly) on 23 August 2018 hit by a noxious sulphur dioxide gas allegedly coming from the water reservoir of the plant. 4,000 children were evacuated from Armyansk and Ukrainian authorities claimed that by 10 September (2018) dozens of people had sought medical assistance in mainland Ukraine.Russia evacuates children as Crimea town 'coated in rust', BBC News (6 September 2018)Almost 60 people flee to Ukraine after acid leaks in Crimea, UNIAN (10 September 2018) Crimean ecologist Margarita Litvinenko claimed that gas was caused because the water reservoir of the plant did not contain enough water due to the water shortage in Crimea caused by Ukraine's decision to stop the flow from the North Crimean Canal after the Russian annexation of Crimea. Production New Sulfuric acid plant (2014) The plant has two main units («Титан-1» and «Титан-2»), each with a (design) production capacity of 40,000 tons pa. The production of Titanium dioxide at the plant uses Ilmenite as a feedstock, using concentrated Sulfuric acid to dissolve the ground ore. Iron based impurities are reduced to Iron (II) in solution; the liquid mixture is then filtered, and Iron (II) is removed by selective crystallization and centrifugal separation on cooling of the solution. Next the Titanyl sulfate solution is evaporatively concentrated. The Titanyl sulfate solution is hydrolyzed producing amorphous flakes of Titanium dioxide, which are then filtered and washed. Filtered Titanium dioxide is then calcined to drive off water. Further surface treatment and grinding may be applied to the Titanium dioxide for specific uses or properties of the Titanium dioxide pigment. In addition to its primary product (~90% of exports) the plant also generates red iron oxide pigment, mineral fertilizers, sulfuric acid, aluminum sulfate, water glass, iron sulfate, and copper sulfate, and alkaline sodium and lithium chemicals.

Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was an Antonov An-24 designed to carry 50 passengers. It was built in 1963, and made its first flight on 8 June 1963. At the time of the accident the aircraft had accumulated 27,244 flying hours and 24,754 pressurization cycles.  Accident  On 17 December 1976 at 20:32 Moscow time the An-24 took off from Chernivtsi on domestic flight Н-36 from Chernivtsi to Kiev airport with 50 passengers and five crew members on board. The crew had a weather forecast of clouds at from 100 to 1000–1500 meters, strong south-east wind, mist, drizzle, snowfall, predicting a moderately bumpy flight with visibility of 1000–2000 meters, strong icing in clouds. By the time the aircraft 46722 left Chernivtsi, visibility in Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany) had dropped to 800 meters and low clouds at 70 meters; wind there was weak but icing in the clouds was strong. The Aero-meteorological station had been making frequent weather observations but had not detected the moment when horizontal visibility in Zhuliany Airport became less than 700 meters (minimum visibility for An-24) and did not warn air traffic controllers. In violation of instructions, from 20:55 to 22:10 there was no continuous monitoring of visibility at landing direction: 81° magnetic bearing. Crews of incoming flights despite of weather did not require factual values of horizontal and vertical visibility. The flight made its final approach to Kyiv airport at 81° bearing using a non-directional beacon and radiolocation system of landing (TESLA) by commands of landing controller. The airport's instrument landing system was out of service for maintenance and testing. Traffic controller did not guide flight by landing radar and didn't give information to crew at time of entering to the glide path. Because of this aircraft 46722 started lowering too late and vertical velocity was greater than designed. atc At that moment air traffic control was in contact with 3 aircraft on the same radio frequency. As result, ATC commands were ambiguous. The An-24 twice requested distance to runway but both times the broadcast was stepped on by other aircraft. 2500 meters from runway end the An-24 descended below the published glide path but was not advised by ATC.At the critical height (100 m) pilots saw no runway lights but didn't abandon its approach. At 30–35 meters above Earth surface “danger height” alarm was activated. Pilots pulled controls and aircraft had g-force of 1.9 g. But it was too late. Vertical velocity was too high and height reserve was too small. Two seconds later right part of aircraft had collided with a concrete fence of non-directional radio beacon station at 1265 meters from runway end and at 40 meters right from runway axis. Then aircraft had touched ground in station's yard by front and left landing gears, took off for a short time, then collide with a concrete fence at the opposite side of this yard. Seconds later An-24 collided by left wing with a group of trees, then the aircraft nose ran into a 4.5-meter railroad mound and the rest of the aircraft went on the rails and had stopped at 1150 m from the runway end 40 m right from the runway axis. Fire broke out and completely destroyed aircraft. 4 crew members and 44 passengers died in this accident. Flight attendant and 6 passengers survived; one of these passengers had no injuries.  Investigation  Because aircraft had been destroyed by fire commission could not determine why danger height alarm probe did not trigger at 60 m height as it had to do. There were serious errors in work of aero-meteorological station which reports to air traffic controller horizontal visibility 700 m and vertical visibility of 50 m. But weather observed 30 seconds after the accident was below weather minimum for An-24. And aircraft 46440 which tied to landing 2 minutes and 6 seconds before aircraft 46722, went to dispersal field at Boryspil Airport because pilots did not see airfield lights. So real horizontal visibility at Zhuliany airport was below 700 meters and An-24 aircraft must not land in these conditions.

She then turned her attention to opera and moved to Italy to start her vocal training at the age of ten. One year later she was admitted into the Children Chorus of the Teatro alla Scala; at fourteen she was accepted into the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory of Milan, from which she graduated with honors at the age of 18. At the same time she attended the “Scuola musicale di Milano” where she studied with Maestro Carlo Gaifa. In the summer of 2014 she was accepted into the “Young Singers Project” at the Salzburg Festival. Competitions and first engagements After winning several voice competitions (including the Concorso per giovani cantanti d'Europa As.li.co and \\"The Opera Ball\\" in Kazakhstan), Mudryak made her operatic debut as Susanna in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro at the Teatro Carlo Felice of Genoa in March 2014. Subsequently she sang Musetta in Puccini's La bohème at the Teatro Rosetum in Milan, Clorinda in Rossini's La Cenerentola in a reduced version at the Salzburg Festival, Adina in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore at the Teatro Municipale of Piacenza and Giulietta in Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann in Pavia, Jesi and Como. In 2017 she was one of the winners of Plácido Domingo's Operalia competition. Career from 2015 to present In the years 2015 to 2017 Mudryak's engagements included Adina in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore and Musetta in La bohème at the Teatro Alighieri in Ravenna, Musetta at the NCPA Mumbai, Mimì in La bohème at the Teatro Carlo Coccia in Novara, at the Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence and at the Astana Opera, Norina in Don Pasquale in Bergamo, Como, Jesi and Pavia, Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro at the Teatro Petruzzelli in Bari, Giulia in Rossini's La scala di seta in Liège, Violetta in La traviata at the Astana Opera, at the Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence and in open air performances at the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, the Teatro Carlo Felice Genoa, Teatro San Carlo Naples, Liù in Puccini's Turandot for the inauguration of the Shaanxi Grand Theatre in China, Oscar in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera at the NCPA Opera Festival Beijing. She also sang excerpts as Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto and Luisa in Luisa Miller at gala concerts in Modena and Piacenza celebrating baritone Leo Nucci's career. She made her role debut as Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto in December 2017 with Leo Nucci in the title role, in February 2018 she returned to the Teatro San Carlo in Naples in the title role of a new production of La traviata and in July 2018 she made her house debut at the Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow as Mimì in La bohème Collaboration with conductors and stage directors Mudryak has worked with several prestigious conductor and stage directors, among them conductors Daniel Oren, Carlo Rizzi, , Fabrizio Maria Carminati and Gabriele Ferro and stage directors Leo Nucci, Hugo De Ana, Ferzan Ozpetek and Chiara Muti.

She created the Librairie Droz, a publisher and seller of academic books, at Paris in 1924, moving the business to Geneva at the end of the war.  Biography  her business around 1955. Laure Eugénie Zahn was born at La Chaux-de-Fonds in the francophone northwest of Switzerland. Her father, Frédéric Zahn, was a well known member of the business community in the town, where he worked as an editor. In 1900 the family relocated to nearby Neuchâtel. Here she completed her secondary education and obtained a teaching diploma. Between 1910 and 1913 she taught French at the Moravian Institute of Gnadenberg in Silesia, taking the opportunity at the same time to perfect her German. Returning to Neuchâtel in 1913, she was admitted to the Université de Neuchâtel where during the next three years she studied successfully for her degree. She was a pupil of Arthur Piaget, who also became a good friend. He encouraged her to study the history of ancient poetry and renaissance literature. It is apparent that the second volume of Piaget's work \\"Jardin de Plaisance et Fleur de rhétorique, d'Antoine Vérard (vers 1501)\\", which was published only in 1925, subtitled \\"Introduction and notes\\" and signed off by E.Droz and Arthur Piaget, was largely the work of Piaget's erudite pupil. The compilation of 672 verses, ballads, sounds, rondeaux etc., many of them anonymous, was described in an obituary of Eugénie Droz as an \\"inestimable contribution to mid-century French literature\\" (\\"contribution inestimable aux lettres françaises du milieu du siècle\\"). In 1916 her parents divorced. Three years later she sought and received permission to use her mother's pre- marriage name in place of her father's name. Eugénie Zahn became Eugénie Droz. Sources covering this period may identify her under either name. She moved to Paris in 1916 and enrolled, at this stage as Eugénie Zahn, at the École pratique des hautes études (Section IV – Sciences historiques et philologiques (loosely, History and Philology). Her teachers included Alfred Jeanroy, Abel Lefranc and Georges Doutrepont. She received exceptionally positive reports from the outset and completed her degree in 1923. In 1924 she opened the Librairie Droz, initially at 34 rue Serpente, moving within a year to 25 Rue de Tournon, both addresses located appropriately in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. Her business was in essence a specialist bookshop and publisher. The core product would be her own academic output as an editor-publisher with a particular interest in sixteenth century texts and the history and social impact of books through history more generally. The business continues to focus on medieval and humanist titles and on literary criticism and art history. She described the Paris premises proudly in her first catalogue: \\"Accommodated in the House of the Bronze Horse, given by Francis I to [the renaissance poet] Clément Marot in 1539, the 'Librairie Droz' [book business] has been established by Eugénie Droz, graduate of the École pratique des hautes études and docteur ès lettres. Her doctorate came from the Université de Neuchâtel. Her work for it consisted of 35 ancient texts accompanied by translations into contemporary French, a piece of work currently conserved in the rare books collection of the National Library of France. Despite the Librairie Droz having been established in Paris, the printed device appearing as a form of trade mark on publications acknowledged the Swiss provenance of the proprietress. She copied the design used by Jean de Stalle who operated a printing house in Geneva between 1487 and 1493. The only change involved removing the initials \\"IdeS\\", incorporated in the centre of the device, and replacing them with her own initials, \\"ED\\". Shortly after opening the Librairie Droz, still aged only 32, she found time to take on a position as assistant treasurer of the Société des anciens textes français, a learned society founded in Paris in 1875 with the purpose of publishing all kinds of medieval documents written either in langue d'oïl or langue d'oc. (The society's treasurer was Baron Edmond de Rothschild.) In 1934 she founded \\"Humanisme et Renaissance\\", an academic journal which in effect replaced \\"Revue du seizième siècle\\". Most prominent among the many erudite collaborators on it were her old tutor, Abel Lefranc and Robert Marichal. She also created the non-profit association \\"Humanisme et Renaissance\\". During the occupation she changed the name of the (much diminished) review, which became the \\"Bibliothèque d'humanisme et Renaissance\\". In 1945, while still based in Paris, she created the series \\"Textes littéraires français\\". This was an early series of paperback books, with the focus as before on her own areas of academic expertise. In 1950, by which time she had moved to Geneva, she launched the series \\"les Travaux d'Humanisme et Renaissance\\" which became and remains an important body of reference for renaissance scholarship. In November 1944 she found herself mandated by the Provisional Government to study the files of political deportees at Geneva. The later 1940s were a period of acute austerity and political uncertainty in France. It was probably around this time that she decided to relocate permanently from Paris to Geneva. She sold the premises at 25 Rue de Tournon in 1947 and moved the business permanently to 8 rue Verdaine in Geneva. In 1963, the year of her seventieth birthday, she sold the business, which passed to the control of Alain Dufour and Giovanni Busino, two young historians with complementary skills whom she had personally selected.

Situated on the grounds of Prospect Nature Reserve, it was designed and built by The Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage. The property is owned by Sydney Water and Water NSW, agencies of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= The area of Prospect Reservoir is an area of known Aboriginal occupation, with favourable camping locations along the Eastern Creek and Prospect Creek catchments, and in elevated landscapes to the south. There is also evidence to suggest that the occupation of these lands continued after European contact, through discovery of intermingled glass and stone flakes in archaeological surveys of the place. =Colonial history= The area was settled by Europeans by 1789. Prospect Hill, Sydney's largest body of igneous rock, lies centrally in the Cumberland Plain and dominates the landscape of the area.Ashton, 2000. Very early after first settlement, on 26 April 1788, an exploration party heading west led by Governor Phillip, climbed Prospect Hill. An account by Phillip states that the exploration party saw from Prospect Hill, \\"for the first time since we landed Carmathen Hills (Blue Mountains) as likewise the hills to the southward\\". Phillip's \\"Bellevue\\" (Prospect Hill) acquired considerable significance for the new settlers. Prospect Hill provided a point from which distances could be meaningfully calculated, and became a major reference point for other early explorers.Karskens, 1991. When Watkin Tench made another official journey to the west in 1789, he began his journey with reference to Prospect Hill, which commanded a view of the great chain of mountains to the west. A runaway convict, George Bruce, used Prospect Hill as a hideaway from soldiers in the mid-1790s. During the initial struggling years of European settlement in NSW, Governor Phillip began to settle time-expired convicts on the land as farmers, after the success of James Ruse at Rose Hill.Higginbotham, 2000. On 18 July 1791 Phillip placed a number of men on the eastern and southern slopes of Prospect Hill, as the soils weathered from the basalt cap were richer than the sandstone derived soils of the Cumberland Plain. The grants, mostly 30 acres, encircled Prospect Hill. The settlers included William Butler, James Castle, Samuel Griffiths, John Herbert, George Lisk, Joseph Morley, John Nicols, William Parish and Edward Pugh. The arrival of the first settlers prompted the first organised Aboriginal resistance to the spread of settlement, with the commencement of a violent frontier conflict in which Pemulwuy and his Bidjigal clan played a central role.Flynn, 1999 On 1 May 1801 Governor King took drastic action, issuing a public order requiring that Aboriginal people around Parramatta, Prospect Hill and Georges River should be \\"driven back from the settlers\\" habitations by firing at them'. King's edicts appear to have encouraged a shoot-on-sight attitude whenever any Aboriginal men, women or children appeared. With the death of Pemulwuy, the main resistance leader, in 1802, Aboriginal resistance gradually diminished near Parramatta, although outer areas were still subject to armed hostilities. Prompted by suggestions to the Reverend Marsden by local Prospect Aboriginal groups that a conference should take place \\"with a view of opening the way to reconciliation\\", Marsden promptly organised a meeting near Prospect Hill. At the meeting, held on 3 May 1805, local Aboriginal representatives discussed with Marsden ways of ending the restrictions and indiscriminate reprisals inflicted on them by soldiers and settlers in response to atrocities committed by other Aboriginal clans. The meeting was significant because a group of Aboriginal women and a young free settler at Prospect named John Kennedy acted as intermediaries. The conference led to the end of the conflict for the Aboriginal clans around Parramatta and Prospect. This conference at Prospect on 3 May 1805 is a landmark in Aboriginal/European relations. Macquarie's \\"Native Feasts\\" held at Parramatta from 1814 followed the precedent set in 1805. The Sydney Gazette report of the meeting is notable for the absence of the sneering tone that characterised its earlier coverage of Aboriginal matters. From its commencement in 1791 with the early settlement of the area, agricultural use of the land continued at Prospect Hill. Much of the land appears to have been cleared by the 1820s and pastoral use of the land was well established by then. When Governor Macquarie paid a visit to the area in 1810, he was favourably impressed by the comfortable conditions that had been created. Nelson Lawson, third son of explorer William Lawson (1774-1850), married Honoria Mary Dickinson and before 1837 built \\"Greystanes House\\" as their future family home on the western side of Prospect Hill. Lawson had received the land from his father, who had been granted here by the illegal government that followed the overthrow of Governor Bligh in 1808. Governor Macquarie confirmed the grant, where William Lawson had built a house, which he called \\"Veteran Hall\\", because he had a commission in the NSW Veterans Company. The house was demolished in 1928 and the site is now partly covered by the waters of Prospect Reservoir. Greystanes was approached by a long drive lined with an avenue of English trees - elms (Ulmus procera), hawthorns (Crataegus sp.), holly (Ilex aquifolium), and woodbine (Clematis sp.) mingling with jacarandas (J.mimosifolia). It had a wide, semi-circular front verandah supported by 4 pillars. The foundations were of stone, the roof of slate, and the doors and architraves of heavy red cedar. It was richly furnished with articles of the best quality available and was the scene of many glittering soirees attended by the elite of the colony. Honoria Lawson died in 1845, Nelson remarried a year later, but died in 1849, and the property reverted to his father. Greystanes house was demolished in the 1940s.amended Read, S., 2006 - the house can't have been \\"on the crest\\" of Prospect Hill as Pollon states, if its site was covered by the Reservoir By the 1870s, with the collapse of the production of cereal grains across the Cumberland Plain, the Prospect Hill area appears to have largely been devoted to livestock. The dwellings of the earliest settlers largely appear to have been removed by this stage. By the time that any mapping was undertaken in this vicinity, most of these structures had disappeared, making their locations difficult to pinpoint. The land was farmed from 1806-1888 when the Prospect Reservoir was built. =Prospect Reservoir= In 1867, the Governor of NSW appointed a Commission to recommend a scheme for Sydney's water supply, and by 1869 it was recommended that construction commence on the Upper Nepean Scheme. This consisted of two diversion weirs, located at Pheasant's Nest and Broughton's Pass, in the Upper Nepean River catchment, with water feeding into a series of tunnels, canals and aqueducts known as the Upper Canal System. It was intended that water be fed by gravity from the catchment into a reservoir at Prospect. This scheme was to be Sydney's fourth water supply system, following the Tank Stream, Busby's Bore and the Botany (Lachlan) Swamps. Designed and constructed by the NSW Public Works Department, Prospect Reservoir was built during the 1880s and completed in 1888. Credit for the Upper Nepean Scheme is largely given to Edward Orpen Moriarty, the Engineer in Chief of the Harbours and Rivers Branch of the Public Works Department from 1858-88. The Upper Nepean Scheme, completed 1888, was Sydney's fourth water supply. The scheme tapped the headwaters of the Nepean River and its tributaries, the Cataract, Cordeaux, and Avon Rivers. The system consisted of a number of diversion weirs which traversed streams and fed into a collection of tunnels, canals and aqueducts known as the Upper Canal. The canal transported the water to Prospect reservoir. From here, the Lower Canal, which moved the water to a basin at Guildford, now known as Pipehead. At this point, the water was piped to a service reservoir at Pott's Hill, thence to Crown Street and a group of minor service reservoirs located around the City. The Valve House was a key element in the Upper Nepean Water Supply Scheme, and provided Sydney with a reliable source of water from 1888.  Description  The valve house consists of an octagonal shaped building approximately wide. Its design is based on a loose interpretation of the Victorian Free Classical style. The primary construction material is sandstone brick, with sandstone foundations and features. Although purely functional in purpose (housing the electrical valve gear), it was designed with an awareness of architectural laws and principles. The informality of the style allowed for a fair amount of flexibility in design, and the final appearance attests to a successful blending of industrial function with architectural aesthetics. It borrows elements from classical architecture, evidenced by the formal decoration of the parapet and other features, however exhibits a level of restraint in its unadornment of wall surfaces and plain window details. It is a representative example of the trend to enhance the appearance of functional civil engineering structures with restrained decoration, common to many Board-designed buildings. The Pumping station illustrates the level of enhancement which could be achieved by architects, without resorting to ostentation or gaudiness., The Valve chambers are lined with crafted brickwork, and much of the valve gear is original, although some components have been renewed. Where this has occurred, the original style and appearance have been preserved. In addition, the valve house contains what is thought to be the original weight operated \\"Kent \\" flow metres, renowned for their accuracy and reliability (this would need to be substantiated by formal investigation)., The Pumping station is a central controlling structure in the Upper Nepean Scheme, regulating the release of water from Prospect Reservoir (maximum rate 450 megalitres/day) to the Lower Canal for conveyance to Pipe Head, thence to Sydney. Since 1960, Prospect has been supplied by Warragamba, rather than the Upper Nepean Dams. An official plaque emblazens the valve house, and reads, \\"The Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage, Nepean Water Supply - Completed AD 1889- E.O.Moriarty, M.Inst.C.E. Engnieer In Chief, P.W.D.\\" = Modifications and dates = Substantially intact and in good condition. Currently regulates the supply of water from the Reservoir to Pipehead.  Heritage listing  The Prospect Reservoir Valve House was a key element in the Upper Nepean Water Supply Scheme. The valve house has a high level of historic significance, as it has had a direct role in the supply and regulation of water to Sydney after the Scheme's inception in 1888. The building is representative of Board owned buildings designed in Free Classical style and is executed in such a way that allows aesthetic appreciation whilst being free of adornment or fussy decoration. The architectural expressions which imbue the building with significance at the local level include the classical parapet and lintel detail, symmetrical facade and unadorned wall surfaces. The valve house continues to be a central element of the Sydney water supply system. Prospect Reservoir Valve House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare statewide. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. This item is assessed as aesthetically representative locally.

It was built from 1805 to 1832. It is also known as Horsley complex (homestead, outbuildings, garden, farm), Horsley Park, King's Gift and Horsley House. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1805 Governor King granted Lieutenant Colonel George Johnston of Annandale farm 2000 acres of land at Prospect, for his part in putting down a convict uprising at Castle Hill in the previous year. Johnston called the farm \\"King's Gift\\". Johnston died in 1823. A related place is Horsley near Dapto (Wollongong), which was a grant /19 to George Weston's elder brother, William Francis Weston, known as \\"Mr Johnston's Meadow\\". William Francis Weston died in 1826 leaving a widow and five small children, and it is possible that George Weston came to Australia to advise and help his sister in law, Elizabeth around this time. The Horsley (Fairfield) land was given by Col. Johnston to his daughter Blanche, who, on May 21, 1829, at St. James' Church, Sydney, married George Edward Nicholas Weston, a Lieutenant in the East India Company Service. Weston had a Swiss mother and his family had descendants on West Horsley Manor in Surrey in England dating back to 1066, farming large estates. It is thought Horsley (Fairfield) is named after West Horsley Manor in Surrey. Captain & Mrs George Weston spent the following two years in India, returning to Sydney with their two children in July 1831. In that year they took up their property, living in a large Indian tent attended by Indian servants until the house was completed. In 1832 the homestead was built by then, together with major outbuildings (kitchen, stables, blacksmith's shop and barn). The well-wooded land produced timber carted to sawmills for many years. The Westons' predominant interests were agriculture and raising stock, including fine bloodstock race horses. Captain Weston (from reports in the Australian between 1831 and 1841) was involved with the Cumberland Turf Club, the Australian Race Committee, fox hunting, and with contemporary political issues. In 1839 he was one of the promoters of a public meeting to petition the continuation of transportation of convicts to maintain the supply of low cost farm labour. An 1843 Sydney Morning Herald report noted his indignation at the loss of a convict's labour by the Governor's order, his support for neighbour William Lawson (of Greystanes) in elections to the Legislative Council in 1843 and his animosity to Hannibal Macarthur in the same election. Other 1844 Sydney Morning Herald reports show his involvement in establishing the Penrith Agricultural Society and his award for the best coaching stallion. The Westons had eight children, 4 girls and 4 boys, 1 of whom died in infancy. In 1837 Captain Weston had a pack of foxhounds at Horsley, and by 1838 his pastoral activities had extended beyond the limits of location, and he held a grazing lease in South-West Yass. An 1841 sale notice in the Australian cited land near the \\"mansion and improving property\\" of Captain Weston, but the area was not closely settled then. The Westons exported horses to India, a Sydney Morning Herald report of 29 August 1844 describing 80 horses loaded onto the Blondell bound for Calcutta, of which 31 belonged to Blanche's brothers Robert and David Johnston, and Captain Weston. Although East India Company agents left Calcutta in 1847, horse trading between the Australian colonies continued at a diminishing rate for several more years. George Weston died at Horsley in 1856 at the age of 56 and was buried at St. Bartholemew's cemetery at Prospect. His widow Blanche continued to conduct the farm business, supported by her extended family, and employees and their families, who had been in her service for many years. An 1871 storey in the Town & Country journal describes a garden, vineyard of about 15 acres which produced 2000 gallons of wine in 1870 and none due to blight in 1871, and Mr Frank (Francis, the youngest son, then managing the property)'s pride, his horse stock, many of which were successful race horses. The main driveway from front gates was lined with Bunya pines (from photographs these were possibly planted by 1860s/70s) terminating in two Moreton Bay figs, where it reached the crest of the hill on which the house stood. Circular carriage loop and shrubbery laid out in front (east) of house. Later a small carriage drive was laid out (along what is now the north and west site boundaries), and a planted maze. Blanche Weston died in 1904 at the age of 98. At that time some of her employees were the third generation of those families in service and residence at Horsley. In 1904 the main activity was again grazing, with all the wine used in the house produced on the estate, fine vineyards and orchards. A report in the Cumberland Argus 3 September 1904 notes this, and that wheat had been formerly grown but abandoned due to rust attacks years ago. During Blanche's lifetime, there had been a number of changes to the package of land comprising Horsley and smaller adjoining grants, which had become the property of other Johnston family members or been used to negotiate exchanges with Weston land elsewhere. In 1906 Blanches' widowed daughter Alice Smart successfully applied to have them all brought together under the one certificate of title, making her the owner of 2045 acres, by then traversed to the east by a section of the Sydney Water Supply Canal to Prospect Reservoir. In 1924 (or 1930Lucas, 1982) the estate was subdivided into 20 & 40 acre holdings, with approximately 65 acres including the homestead remaining in the possession of Miss Julia Perry, a Weston descendant (granddaughter) of Mrs. Weston).Lucas, 1982 Julia Perry (née Antill), a granddaughter of Mrs Weston, lived there until the late 1930s, when the estate passed out of the hands of the Johnston-Weston family. In January 1939 the property passed out of the Weston/Johnston family, being purchased by Frederic Moffitt, the father of the present (2002) owners, Mrs Helen Kerfoot and her sister Mrs June Vines. Moffitt occupied Horsley in May 1939. The barn (which was to the west of the house and at the end of the street of outbuildings) was demolished. Before Frederic Moffit's death in 1951 he transferred the property to his wife. In 1957 Two 5 acre blocks surveyed for possible sale. 5 acres was sold in 1959. In 1960 5 acres was sold, reducing site to 60 acres. In 1966 Mrs Moffitt died and the property was inherited by the three remaining daughters. Helen Kerfoot, who had been living at Horsley with her mother for some years, continued to occupy the homestead portion, now with 12 acres. In 1969 the property was surveyed and a new subdivision was laid out. In 1972 the new subdivisions were sold. The site was reduced to 12 acres (4.45 hectares) but still included homestead, major outbuildings, driveway and most important tree plantings. New rear access to site provided via Jamison Close, also servicing new subdivisions. Losses included: * the pond, a small dam surrounded by trees immediately to the south of the front gates, and a favourite haunt of birds; * the orchard on the southern slopes below the homestead and a small vineyard, originally with its own winepress, to the north; * the cottage originally used by Mrs George Weston as a school for children on the property; * the site of the original barn built over by a new residence. By 1982 the site was ringed by new housing development built on the 1972 subdivisions. A poultry shed was built adjacent to the eastern boundary. The new developments were insensitive in their form and siting, and impinge on the major views of the homestead from the east and south-east approached along The Horsley Drive. In 1971 general external repair and restoration works were carried out to the homestead, including new corrugated iron roofing, gutters and downpipes aded, the iron on the south skillion replacing the extant Morewood & Roger's patent iron (roof) tiles. General repairs and painting were done to the homestead. The office and laundry's original joinery had severely deteriorated and was repaired/renewed to its original detail. In 1976 external restoration work was carried out to the Stables block, with financial assistance from a Federal government National Estate grant, including repairs to the roof and guttering, walls and joinery.  Description  = Grounds = To the north of the outbuildings and down a slope was a vineyard, with its own wine press, and on the southern slopes to the house was an orchard. The western property boundary is marked by a row of Bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii). On the northern slope there are extensive remains of orchard terracing and a second drive. The vineyard of Horsley extended over the surrounding hillside and was tended initially by convicts and later by a German wine dresser especially brought out for the purpose as was the custom. = Garden = The garden provides an appropriate period setting for the house and is significant in its own right as well as being the setting for Horsley Homestead. The approach is by a gently curving carriage drive through a formal avenue of Bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii) and Chir pines (Pinus roxburghii). On the crest of a hill at the western end of the avenue, the drive goes through an outer set of garden gates flanked by two huge Moreton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla) which frame the entrance driveway to the house, groupings of plumbago (Plumbago capensis) and sweet bay (Laurus nobilis). Other trees such as jacarandas (Jacaranda mimosifolia) and Illawarra flame trees (Brachychiton acerifolius) were planted by Helen Kerfoot since the 1950s.HK/Stuart Read, pers.comm. Closer to the house, the drive forks to form a petal shaped carriage loop which further divides to create a smaller, circular loop. The circular loop before the house's eastern front was formerly planted in a clearly visible ( photographs) quatrefoil design which today is rather overgrown shrubbery, screening the view. Contained in this loop is a number of choice plants, including a rare South African plant, the Kei apple (Carissa grandiflora), bird-of-paradise flower (Strelitzia nicolae), sweet box (Murraya paniculata), crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica), Nile lilies (Agapanthus orientalis) etc. The drive winds north of the house and around to its rear (west where it turns west into a \\"street\\" of outbuildings and further on a rear drive to the south-west out to Horsley Road. Behind the house is a later tennis court and remnant flower beds. Tree plantings in this area include a Kaffir plum (Harpephyllum caffrum) north-west of the house, five rare native corkwood trees (Duboisea myoporoides), a weeping Boree or myall (Acacia pendula) to the west. Further west is another large Moreton Bay fig. HOUSE Horsley was a pastoral holding set up to be an entirely self- sufficient community. The substantial homestead was built on the highest of a series of wooded hills in gently undulating country, with fine views in all directions. The single storey house is a direct copy of an Indian Bungalow, built of rendered brick made by convicts, with a high, hipped, shingled (later corrugated iron) roof. The walls are of stuccoed convict brick made on the property, strengthened by simple pilasters and between them are projecting panels with an arched recess in which the windows are set. The roof is over an almost square arrangement of bedrooms opening from central drawing room, sitting room and dining room, a classic Indian bungalow design, of the type built in Bengal. Pillared verandas at front and back were included under the main roof and enclosed at either end by corner rooms. On the garden (east) front it has a recessed central front veranda, supported by three pairs of Tuscan or Roman Doric columns. Wide shallow steps with bevel treads lead up to the veranda from the garden. French doors open onto the veranda from the drawing and dining rooms. This is now the main access to the house. Rainwater from the roof drained directly into brick gutters surrounding the house and from there into an underground tank. The house was built over a series of cellars - for wine on the north-western aspect, meat to the east end of the south aspect and dairy produce to the west end. It has an extensive wine cellar underneath almost its whole size, with sloping timbers to roll wine casks down into it, and rough timber shelves. A wooden door with stout wooden bars provides ventilation. The cellar ceiling is lath and plastered and whitewashed, as are the walls. There are storage shelves in the blind arch in the wall and a pump removed the dregs from a floor drain. The shelves are carried on brick arches, and extra ventilation comes through the brick work of the arched opening which holds small shelves. (In 1931 whilst a corner of the cellar was being cleared, seven bottles of Horsley wine were found, nearly a hundred years old, and still in \\"excellent condition\\". A dairy is also located under the house on the other side, with a separate entrance. The use of folding casement doors, of sixteen panes and, having adjustable louver shutters, indicate its British India design origins. The windows throughout are similar, but while those opening onto the veranda have shutters that open in two leaves, those of the windows in the external walls have four sections so that the higher ones can remain open when the lower ones are closed. The wooden louvers are adjustable, a wooden bar connected to a simple wooden device can be moved to either side, to open and close the shutters. The rear veranda (to the west) is more recessed, and irregularly shaped, by which one room is provided with windows at both front and rear. Both this and another room at the rear, having access from the rear veranda, were convenient to the kitchen and suitable for use as a dining room. External joinery is Indian teak (termite proof), explaining the thick, sturdy glazing bars of the French doors (as teak does not lend itself to fine detail). The internal joinery is cedar and painted. It is of a high standard, featuring many pairs of four paned, double doors (i.e.: 8 panelled doors) with matching jambs, timber fireplace surrounds of simple Georgian design, and deep skirting boards. In one room is a fine marble fireplace of similar design. From the drawing room an east–west passage leads to the bedrooms on the northern side of the house, lined with cupboards, all of which have the same elegant doors. OUTBUILDINGS A street of service buildings including kitchen, office cum library, laundry and privy, stables, coach house, servants' quarters and blacksmith shop, extended westward from the back of the house in a straight line. These are grouped along the continuation of the carriage drive, forming a street, which was terminated at a larger distance in the large barn (now demolished). All the outbuildings are single storey, stuccoed brick structures with hipped rooves. Pilasters or projecting panels with arched, recessed windows as in the homestead are repeated in these buildings in a simpler way. Nearest the house is the kitchen wing, joined to the house by a covered way. Part of the kitchen wing, with a door opening into the garden, was a library cum office, ideally placed, where the master of the house could see one and all - servants, clients or his sporting friends, without disturbing his wife's domestic arrangements. Next to the west is the stables has pilasters on both sides of its central doors, to strengthen the walls. It has a hipped roof. A small cottage just beyond the range of stables is similar in style, and these buildings form the main nucleus of the establishment. Some of the humbler outbuildings, brick walls are only lime-washed also requiring re-application at regular intervals. The coach house and stables were used for horses until quite recently (1998) and remnants of additional horse stalls are still evident at the back (south-eastern) side, with a row of tumbledown brick walls to the east indicating early stable outbuildings for tackle etc. The Blacksmith's shop collapsed in a storm in 1940, but is able to be reconstructed (opinion, Lucas, 1982). Last (western) outbuilding, the bush timber framed machinery shed, is little changed from its original use, and its wooden shingles are clearly visible under the corrugated iron roof. Some other buildings remain, now in disrepair, and many more must have once stood to house servants of all kinds, stock men, blacksmiths, gardeners, house servants etc. = Condition = As at 6 August 2002, 1983 fire briefly engulfed some of the exposed timbers of the Blue Room the eastern counterpart of the collapsed blacksmith's shop. (1991) The garden is maintained in fair condition, although the entrance drive is now seldom used and deteriorating and the carriage loop is grassed over. The garden is in urgent need of protection by a large curtilage from unsympathetic development of the surrounding subdivided land. A conservation order has been applied only to the land under the same ownership as the house and is completely unrealistic if the garden and siting is to be protected. An inappropriate chicken shed has been sited beneath the house destroying the view from the entrance gates over the paddocks up to the houseNational Trust, 1981 (1998) Original wooden shingles on roof are well preserved below later corrugated iron roofs on the homestead and outbuildings. Brick drains are clearly visible as first built around the homestead. Convict made bricks (from clay on the estate) are in evidence in all buildings, particularly where rising damp means stucco is flaking off external walls, revealing the bricks below. Some of the humbler outbuildings, brick walls are only lime-washed also requiring re-application at regular intervals. The coach house and stables were used for horses until quite recently (1998) and remnants of additional horse stalls are still evident at the back (south- eastern) side, with a row of tumbledown brick walls to the east indicating early stable outbuildings for tackle etc. Blacksmith's shop collapsed in a storm in 1940, but is able to be reconstructed (opinion, Lucas, 1982). Last (western) outbuilding, the bush timber framed machinery shed, is little changed from its original use, and its wooden shingles are clearly visible under the corrugated iron roof. Garden (1998) is somewhat overgrown, but retains evidence of much of the original design, including a carriage loop in front (east) of the house, and a small carriage drive. The Bunya pine avenue up the driveway from the east to the house/carriage loop remains, with African olives seeding underneath the Bunya pines. The huge Moreton Bay figs at the house area entry gates at the western end of the driveway avenue remain, and have grown so large they preclude vehicular entry into the carriage loop/ garden. More recent development on adjoining lots, unsympathetic to Horsley, has caused the planting of trees and shrubs to obscure them, but these plantings are exotics, in character with much of the rest of the garden. Mrs Kerfoot maintains a central bed of flowers and shrubs (e.g.: Yucca gloriosa) along the eastern and southern aspects of the house, which are in keeping with the historic atmosphere.

William Francis Weston died in 1826 leaving a widow and five small children, and it is possible George Weston came to Australia to advise and help his sister in law, Elizabeth around this time.  Heritage listing  As at 7 August 2002, A substantially intact core of a colonial farm estate with its original 1830s bungalow, outbuildings, plantings, layout and entry within a remnant rural landscape setting which is now rare in the Fairfield LGA and on the Cumberland Plain. Horsley is integral to the history of Fairfield and the history of New South Wales, from its initial granting to Colonel Johnston as reward for his role in suppressing the Castle Hill rebellion. It has been associated with major elements in the colony's development, particularly the pastoral and racing industries, and trade with India. Horsley makes a major contribution to the local townscape through its visual prominence, size and character, for instance its prominent Bunya pine avenue climbing the hill to the house is similar in effect to those of Bella Vista Farm, Seven Hills, and Winbourne, Mulgoa. It retains some important traditional views to features beyond the estate. The place has individual components of heritage significance, e.g.: * the homestead as a rare (perhaps unique) surviving early Australian version of an Indian Bungalow style residence; * its outbuildings both individually and as a \\"street\\" which is rare; * its early plantings such as the prominent Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) entry avenue; * the garden as a substantially intact 19th century landscape, with carriage loop, garden beds and early plantings; and * for its unusual individual plants such as the Kei apple (Carissa grandiflora). The place has important associations with various notable people - Colonel George Johnston, Governor King, the Weston family), and as a celebrated influence on the major colonial revival movement in architecture in the 1920s and 1930s, through architect William Hardy Wilson (Macquarie Cottage, Pymble; Eryldene, Gordon; Purulia, Wahroonga; Tiana (old name, no longer used, Cronulla) and others . The place has considerable capacity to demonstrate development of the estate from its initial phase to the present, and is of considerable scientific interest on account of its archaeological research potential.National Trust, 2000. A colonial garden of major historic and aesthetic importance. An intact mid-19th century gardenesque style garden whose layout and planting splendidly complement the siting of the house. It is one of the finest landscapes in NSW despite the loss of some minor planting and detail. It is a garden whose importance relies on its layout (driveway up a hill to the house, carriage loop etc.) and the impact of its large scale planting (African olives, Bunya pine avenue up driveway etc.). A large curtilage is essential. These (Cowpasture gardens including Horsley) were NSW's major contribution to gardening, and were the first gardens in NSW to attract the 20th century artist's and the historican's attention (National Trust (NSW), 1981) The Horsley complex is historically significant as an unusually intact example of a self-contained country estate of the early nineteenth century and for its associations with the prominent early Johnston family. It has architectural significance for demonstrating many of the characteristic features of Old Colonial Regency style and the links with the architecture of British India of the same period. The garden is historically significant in its own right.RNE, 1978 Horsley is the only Australian colonial house that can be directly related to Ango-Indian architecture. Not only the design, but also details and even certain fittings like the folding casement doors, and louvred jhilmils (of teak) came from India. Also significant is the siting of the house and its outbuildings. Horsley can claim to be the only colonial homestead in NSW to have what amounts to a village street of outbuildings in close proximity to the house. It is also significant for the influence it had on the colonial revival school of architects in the 20th century, following the publication in 1924 of Hardy Wilson's \\"Old Colonial Architecture of NSW & Tasmania\\". Wilson named it his favourite house and its influence can be seen in his work and that of his contemporaries. Even the architect, C. Bruce Dellit, though not of the colonial revival school, can be said to have been inspired by Horsley in his country house, Karoo at Meadow Flat, built in c.1935Lucas, C., 1982 Horsley is unique in that the house and outbuildings have been designed as an entity...the strong sense of style points to an architect... On this point there is no documentary evidence, but the tomb of the original owner, Colonel Johnston, who died in 1823, was designed by Francis GreenwayRoxburgh, 1978 Horsley complex was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It was designed by possibly Francis Greenway and built from 1825 to 1826 by A. Kinghorne and Thomas Moore. It is also known as Male Orphan School, The Homestead and Schoolmaster's residence. The property is owned by Office of Environment and Heritage (General). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  1804 Governor King granted 12,300 acres in Cabramatta to the Female Orphan School (which had outgrown its city site on George and Bridge Streets, after lobbying from Reverend Samuel Marsden. This land was rented out in portions to provide an income for the school. Marsden convinced King to build a permanent Female Orphan House at Parramatta (now Rydalmere), and this was built under Governor Macquarie from 1813-1818. When this opened the George Street residence was repaired and reopened as a Male Orphan House. Commissioner Bigge was not satisfied with the city site and recommended establishment of a new male orphanage on the Orphan School estate close to Liverpool. The estate (grant) had been declared invalid due to failure of the School's Committee to pay quit rent of 12 pounds 6 shillings after 5 years. Governor Brisbane rededicated the land to its original purpose in 1823. Meanwhile, the grant had been used as a small stock farm on which a small house and several farm buildings had been built. Bigge proposed that the Male Orphan School be established on the land and that the new institution would serve as a farm school in an attempt to increase the level of farming knowledge and practice in New South Wales. It would also lower costs because the occupants could grow and harvest some of their own food. In early 1824 the move was complete and the original George Street residence ceased operating as an orphanage. James Busby, appointed farm manager, taught the boys viticulture, having planted a vinyard here in 1825. The \\"New Farm\\" near Liverpool as the male orphanage became known, briefly ceased operation in 1826. In April 1826 the administration of orphans changed from the Orphan Committee to the Church and Schools Corporation and a new site was selected. The orphanage was again relocated, this time to a nearby site only one and 1/4 miles from Liverpool and construction of the school began at Bull's Hill, also located within the existing Orphan School estate. The Schoolmaster's residence, otherwise known as the Homestead, was built at Bull's Hill within the Orphan School estate sometime in c.1826. The site was selected by Government engineer Alexander Kinghorne. Work began on Bull's Farm in June 1826. The land had already been partially cleared and by July 1826 tenders were called to begin works on the Master's Residence (now Bonnyrigg House) and dormitories. Construction works on various buildings continued at the Orphanage until 1848, just two years prior to its closure in March 1850. The large complex included the Master's House, dormitories, a dining room, school rooms, a probationary school, an infant school room and nursery, staff bedroom and kitchen, watch house, a hospital, stable and yard, coach house, offices, tailor's shop, bakehouse, storekeeper's house, clothing store and privies. Most of these were sited close to Bonnyrigg House on the top of the hill. No detailed plants were found of the institution showing their exact location. Bonnyrigg House stood on top of a rise with views across the district. It was designed by Colonial Architect Francis Greenway in 1821-5. Thomas Moore was eventually engaged as its builder. A succession of Masters occupied the residence, the first being William Walker. Reverend Robert Cartwright was second master of the school for four years. Then Lieutenant Richard Sadlier (R.N.) who held the position until the school's closure. The upper floor of the residence was used as a Court House for the meeting of Magistrates. The area covering the Orphan School estate was less densely covered by trees and was ideal for agriculture, containing excellent land for farming. Boys were employed both on the New Farm, linked to the Orphan School by a track, and in the vineyard and paddocks containing cotton crops. As identified on an 1863 survey, the paddocks and vineyard surrounded the school. The same survey shows a large garden at the front of the Master's House, though the school had closed in 1850. The agricultural potential of the land around the homestead was recognised by James Busby, appointed Farm Manager for the orphanage in 1825. Busby was one of the first in the colony to attempt commercial grape growing for wine production, and dug a number of fresh water bores to the north east of the Master's House. Wine produced from the grapes grown on the estate was first exported from the colony in 1831. His pioneering viticulture laid the foundations of the Australian wine industry. Busby published a book on growing grapes for wine making in 1825 and also donated various (over 400) European grape varieties to the Botanic Gardens in Sydney in 1833 (which supplied a number of colonists and early viticulturists with plants for some years). In 1850 the boys were relocated to Parramatta. For many years the buildings remained vacant, eventually falling into disrepair. At the same time the land around the complex was leased to various local families. In the late 1870s and early 1880s the Church decided to subdivide the estate for sale. A large section of land was purchased along Orphan School Creek by William Simpson (Stimson) for two pounds an acre. With this acquisition William Simpson became the largest landowner and one of the most successful farmers in the Fairfield district. The pioneering Simpson family occupied Bonnyrigg House for many years. Simpson also lead the area's growing timber industry, installing steam-powered saw mills at present day King's Park and in the Fairfield township. He leased or sold large tracts of his land to his five sons who cultivated grapes and market gardens in the fertile soil along the edges of the waterway. One of these, Joseph, gew grapes in the Bonnyrigg area. Simpson's land was again subdivided after 1912 and much of it was taken up by poultry farmers, becoming one of the state's most intensive poultry farming areas. Part of the remaining Orphan School estate was again subdivided into smaller holdings suitable for family farm allotments, particularly the case around Bonnyrigg. A single storey front addition was added c.1914 and a timber verandah and two-storey extension were added to the rear of the building in 1914. Photographs from c.1950 show a large bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) - far taller than the house, and probably dating from at least the 1870s (discovered and popularised from the 1840s onwards).S Read, pers. Comm., 2003 Also shown in these photographs was a picket fence northwest of the house, and a star picket fence separating the vacant Orphan School site. Oleanders (Nerium oleander) had been planted by the 1950s, and remain on site today. In the 1950s the house was surrounded by vacant paddocks, market gardens and distant produce sheds.Stedinger, 2003 Bonnyrigg House is the last standing structure of the colony's first orphanage for boys, which existed from 1826-1840. The Heritage Council of NSW funded an archaeological survey of the site (in 1977), which may be dedicated for an open space reserve within a residential release area, to identify historic remains of the orphanage. The survey report traced the site's history as a sizable administrative and domestic establishment which functioned in conjunction with its agricultural estate, known as New Farm, located nearby. The orphanage, important in the development of social welfare in the country, represents one of the earliest attempts at a combined welfare and training programme. This was due to the social and educational policies of the institution's administrators. The institution was closely associated with prominent colonial figures, in particular Rev. Samuel Marsden, Archdeacon Scott, Rev. Cartwright, Governor Lachlan Macquarie and James Busby. Bonnyrigg House was built in 1826 as the master's residence, and the only complete example of ALexander Kinghorne's building design. Kinghorne was a civil engineer whose name has been briefly connected with colonial institutional building programmes at this time. Examination of the site has identified structural remains and other evidence of occupation attributed to the orphanage period.HCNSW, 1977 Since then many housing estates have emerged in Fairfield, particularly in the 1980s. Bonnyrigg House is now privately owned and still used as a residence.  Description  = Site = Site Allotment 21 is an off-square subdivision of land approximately 55 x 50 meters. Its slightly curving frontage along Cartwright Street measures 55.185m. The maximum length at right angles to the house is 53.4m and a depth of 50.7m. The house is sited on higher ground to the west. The site slopes gently down to the east across an open lawn area. To the southwest in front of the house is also lawn. The house is 8.05m from the northwest fence, which is a lap and cap style timber fence 1.8m high. The same style of fence extends along the northeast side of the property and a colourbond fence to the southeast. An iron fence now marks the front of the property to the southwest. Within the boundary a colourbond dividing fence 6.47m long has been erected for privacy in the rear yard. Nearby in the northwest corner a cliplock shed (3.1m square) has been built. A large Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) is near the house. Jasmine (Jasminium sp.) and bougainvillea (B. glabra cv.) drape over the rear timber fence. Together with the oleanders (Nerium oleander) along the east side of the driveway, these plants appear in a c.1950s photograph of the site. A sparse spread of younger eucalypt trees accurs along the south and eastern boundaries of the site. No remnant garden appears to have survived from the 19th century. = House = Bonnyrigg House The house is a Colonial Georgian residence, of sandstock brick, two storeys with cellars. Hipped iron roof overlies timber shingles and windows are double hung sash with sandstone lintels. A number of blind windows are centrally located on the upper floors, possibly linked to the use of the building by visiting magistrates. Inside it contains painted cedar joinery and a cedar staircase. To the rear, the c.1914-16 rear addition is a two-storey weatherboard extension 6.47m deep and incorporating a verandah 2.1m deep. To the front an addition is a single storey structure of rendered brick and fibro, with an iron skillion roof, 12.66 x 3.1m. Constructed 1826 as the master's house for the orphanage, the original building now incorporated within present structure, is the two storey brick section and the original main entrance was probably on the western side. In 1827-1880 a single storey wing was attached and this was replaced at the end of the 19th century by the existing two storied weatherboard section. The building was apparently designed by Alexander Kinghorne, civil engineer. = Dormitory Block = The position of this structure has been located on land presently (1981) owned by Mr & Mrs Oliver, and is partly covered by a large shed. Scatters of brick identify the position of the brick building with stone quoins which was partly standing as recently as 1976. = Other remains = Examination of the site has identified structural remains and other evidence of occupation which is attributed to the orphanage period. This includes: * a bore, located NE of Bonnyrigg house, probably sunk by James Busby in his search for water for the institution; * a flat raised rectangular mound located N of Bonnyrigg House. This is clearly visible in aerial photographs and may be the site of the \\"school\\" building; * evidence of a brick path; * an area of stone and brick paving which may relate to a dairy; * brick clamps, visible in aerial photographs; * considerable scatters of surface artefacts in the ploughed field immediately S of Bonnyrigg House.Temple & Davies, 1981 = Condition = As at 4 November 2003, the overall setting of the house and curtilage has been severely compromised by suburban subdivision and housing developments. The house has been compromised by unsympathetic additions to its front and rear. The overall setting of house and curtilage has been severely compromised by suburban development. The house itself has been compromised by unsympathetic additions to its front and rear. = Modifications and dates = 2003 large mature bunya pine removed near house. Setting much changed from once overlooking bushland, paddocks, terraced vineyards, and later market gardens to the east. Now surrounded by suburban development, including two storey townhouses to the east. Most of the neighbouring houses on Cartwright Street are two storey. The whole area has been built up except for adjoining allotments to the northwest and northeast.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 9 February 2012, Bonnyrigg House is thought to be the oldest standing building in the City of Fairfield (1826). It has architectural and aesthetic significance as a rare surviving example of Colonial Georgian architecture and is thought to have been designed by Colonial Architect Francis Greenway as the master's residence of the Male Orphan School complex. It has strong social and historical associations with the early 19th century Male Orphanage and School and the emergence of social welfare in Australia. It is also important for its association with James Busby, a pioneer of the Australian wine industry.Stedinger Associates, 2003, Temple & Davies, 1981 The house is the only remaining standing structure of the first male orphan school complex in Australia, apparently designed by Alexander Kinghorne, and the only complete example of his building design. Kinghorne was a civil engineer whose name has been briefly connected with colonial institutional building programmes at this time (1826). The site has associations with James Busby and the development of the Australian wine industry. Busby was appointed to teach viticulture to boys at the Orphan School in 1825 and planted a vinyard here in 1825. While not the first to import or grow vines, Busby was the prophet of the Australian wine industry, publishing the first book (1825, Sydney) in Australia on wine growing and making, donating a huge private collection of European grape varieties to the Botanic Gardens, Sydney in 1833 (which was thence distributed across the state, to SA and Victoria), and responsible for the first plantings in the Hunter Valley in 1825. Wine from the Orphan School estate was exported receiving favourable mention in England in 1831.Stuart Read, from Norrie, P., Vineyards of Sydney, 1990 and Ramsden, E. James Busby, Prophet of Australian Viticulture, 1941). The area has historic and archaeological significance as the primary site of the first male orphan school in Australia from 1826-1840, during which time it was a sizable administrative and domestic establishment which functioned in conjunction with its agricultural estate, known as New Farm, located nearby. The orphanage, important in the development of social welfare in Australia, represents one of the earliest attempts at a combined welfare and training programme, due to the social and educational policies of the institution's administrators. The institution was closely associated with prominent colonial figures, including Samuel Marsden, Archdeacon Scott, Reverend Cartwright, Governor Macquarie and James Busby. The site has identified structural remains and other evidence of occupation which is attributed to the orphanage period. It has potential archaeological significance, with potential to provide information on the functions, layout and activities of the orphanage and its growth and decline. Bonnyrigg House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Bonnyrigg house has historical significance arising from the evidence it provides of 19th century settlement of Fairfield and experimental agricultural work undertaken by the boys of the Male Orphan School. It holds important links with the early social and agricultural history of Australia. Its vineyards and cotton crops were amongst the earliest of their kind. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The residence is associated with the Male Orphan School, its Victorian attitudes to welfare and education. In particular it has strong associations with the Masters of the Orphan School - William Walker, Rev. Robert Cartwright and Richard Sadlier (R.N.). It has associations with James Busby and the development of the Australian wine industry. Busby was appointed farm manager in 1825 and taught viticulture to the boys at the Orphan School. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. It is a rare surviving example of Colonial Georgian residential architecture and is thought to be the work of Francis Greenway, Colonial Architect. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Bonnyrigg House has a strong association with the Fairfield community and the descendants of male orphans from the mid 19th century. It is of high social significance as one of the few social welfare institutions established during the early 19th century. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Bonnyrigg House and possible associated subsurface archaeological remains have the potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural history of the area. Potential subsurface remains may provide significant information on the Masters of the Orphan School - their lives, families and health. While no structures other than Bonnyrigg House are known to have been erected on allotment 21, it is likely that artefacts, features and deposits survive beneath the soil surface. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The residence is considered to be architecturally rare as an example of Francis Greenway's work. It is possible only one of three houses designed by Greenway that are known to be in existence still. The building is also rare as an example of an early Colonial Georgian style residence that was itself associated with a social welfare institution. It is a rare surviving element of the original settlement of Fairfield and the only surviving building from the former Male Orphan School (c.1826-50).

It was built during 1803 by James Busby. It is also known as Land Next to Male Orphan School, The Homestead, Male Schoolmaster's Residence and Bonnyrigg House. The property is owned by Department of Planning and Infrastructure, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Orphan School Estate (12,300 acres/4,980 hectares) was granted in 1803 by Governor King for the support of female orphans. In 1806 tenders were called for the construction of a timber building which was used as a farmhouse until 1819 when the Male Orphan School Farm was opened by Governor Macquarie. The building was ordered by Governor Macquarie under the School and Clergy Lands Corporation Act. A brick dormitory (attrib. to Francis Greenway, approx. 80 feet (24.5 m) by 30 feet (9.2 m)) was built at this time (later demolished leaving only the foundation). Some of the original bricks, made on the site, were later recovered and are housed at the Fairfield Council Chambers. After 1822 the Male Orphan School was moved to the southern portion of the Orphans School grant at Cabramatta. The existing homestead has been attributed to Francis Greenway, as well as Alexander Kinghorne with construction beginning in 1826 (although the Greenway connection has not been substantiated and the building has also been attributed to John Verge). The upper storey of the residence was used as a court house for the local meeting of magistrates possibly explaining the large number of blind windows on this floor. The first master was William Walker, followed by the Rev. Robert Cartwright, who was made Master of the School for four years. He was followed by Lieutenant Richard Sadlier, R.N., who held the position until 1851, his wife being the Rev. Cartwright's daughter. James Busby was made farm manager in 1825 and undertook pioneering work on viticulture in the grounds of the institution. The original holding was gradually broken up with the church eventually selling this portion as a farm. In 1804 Governor King granted 12,300 acres in Cabramatta to the Female Orphan School (which had outgrown its city site on George and Bridge Streets, after lobbying from Reverend Samuel Marsden. This land was rented out in portions to provide an income for the school. Marsden convinced King to build a permanent Female Orphan House at Parramatta (now Rydalmere), and this was built under Governor Macquarie from 1813-1818. When this opened the George Street residence was repaired and reopened as a Male Orphan House. Commissioner Bigge was not satisfied with the city site and recommended establishment of a new male orphanage on the Orphan School estate close to Liverpool. The estate (grant) had been declared invalid due to failure of the School's Committee to pay quit rent of 12 pounds 6 shillings after 5 years. Governor Brisbane rededicated the land to its original purpose in 1823. Meanwhile the grant had been used as a small stock farm on which a small house and several farm buildings had been built. Bigge proposed that the Male Orphan School be established on the land and that the new institution would serve as a farm school in an attempt to increase the level of farming knowledge and practice in New South Wales. It would also lower costs because the occupants could grow and harvest some of their own food. In early 1824 the move was complete and the original George Street residence ceased operating as an orphanage. James Busby, appointed farm manager, taught viticulture to the boys and planted a vineyard here in 1825. Busby had studied viticulture in France and arrived in Sydney in 1824 (Liston, 1981). The \\"New Farm\\" near Liverpool as the male orphanage became known, briefly ceased operation in 1826. In April 1826 the administration of orphans changed from the Orphan Committee to the Church and Schools Corporation and a new site was selected. The orphanage was again relocated, this time to a nearby site only one and 1/4 miles from Liverpool and construction of the school began at Bull's Hill, also located within the existing Orphan School estate. The Schoolmaster's residence, otherwise known as the Homestead, was built at Bull's Hill within the Orphan School estate sometime in c.1826. The site was selected by Government engineer Alexander Kinghorne. Work began on Bull's Farm in June 1826. The land had already been partially cleared and by July 1826 tenders were called to begin works on the Master's Residence (now Bonnyrigg House) and dormitories. Construction works on various buildings continued at the Orphanage until 1848, just two years prior to its closure in March 1850. The large complex included the Master's House, dormitories, a dining room, school rooms, a probationary school, an infant school room and nursery, staff bedroom and kitchen, watch house, a hospital, stable and yard, coach house, offices, tailor's shop, bakehouse, storekeeper's house, clothing store and privies. Most of these were sited close to Bonnyrigg House on the top of the hill. No detailed plants were found of the institution showing their exact location. Bonnyrigg House stood on top of a rise (\\"Bull's Hill\\") with views across the district. It was designed by Colonial Architect Francis Greenway in 1821-5. Thomas Moore was eventually engaged as its builder. A succession of Masters occupied the residence, the first being William Walker. Reverend Robert Cartwright was second master of the school for four years. Then Lieutenant Richard Sadlier (R.N.) who held the position until the school's closure. The upper floor of the residence was used as a Court House for the meeting of Magistrates. The area covering the Orphan School estate was less densely covered by trees and was ideal for agriculture, containing excellent land for farming. Boys were employed both on the New Farm, linked to the Orphan School by a track, and in the vineyard and paddocks containing cotton crops. As identified on an 1863 survey, the paddocks and vineyard surrounded the school. The same survey shows a large garden at the front of the Master's House, though the school had closed in 1850. The agricultural potential of the land around the homestead was recognised by James Busby, appointed Farm Manager for the orphanage in 1825. Busby was one of the first in the colony to attempt commercial grape growing for wine production, and dug a number of fresh water bores to the north east of the Master's House. Wine produced from the grapes grown on the estate was first exported from the colony in 1831. His pioneering viticulture laid the foundations of the Australian wine industry. Busby published a book on growing grapes for wine making in 1825 and also donated various (over 400) European grape varieties to the Botanic Gardens in Sydney in 1833 (which supplied a number of colonists and early viticulturists with plants for some years). In 1850 the boys were relocated to Parramatta. For many years the buildings remained vacant, eventually falling into disrepair. At the same time the land around the complex was leased to various local families. In the late 1870s and early 1880s the Church decided to subdivide the estate for sale. A large section of land was purchased along Orphan School Creek by William Stimson for two pounds an acre. With this acquisition William Stimson became the largest landowner and one of the most successful farmers in the Fairfield district. The pioneering Stimson family occupied Bonnyrigg House for many years. Stimson also led the area's growing timber industry, installing steam-powered saw mills at present day King's Park and in the Fairfield township. He leased or sold large tracts of his land to his five sons who cultivated grapes and market gardens in the fertile soil along the edges of the waterway. One of these, Joseph, grew grapes in the Bonnyrigg area. Stimson's land was again subdivided after 1912 and much of it was taken up by poultry farmers, becoming one of the state's most intensive poultry farming areas. Part of the remaining Orphan School estate was again subdivided into smaller holdings suitable for family farm allotments, particularly the case around Bonnyrigg. A single storey front addition was added c.1914 and a timber verandah and two-storey extension were added to the rear of the building in 1914. Photographs from c.1950 show a large bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) - far taller than the house, and probably dating from at least the 1870s (discovered and popularised from the 1840s onwards).S Read, pers. Comm., 2003 Also shown in these photographs was a picket fence northwest of the house, and a star picket fence separating the vacant Orphan School site. Oleanders (Nerium oleander) had been planted by the 1950s, and remain on site today. In the 1950s the house was surrounded by vacant paddocks, market gardens and distant produce sheds.Stedinger, 2003 Bonnyrigg House is the last standing structure of the colony's first orphanage for boys, which existed from 1826-1840. The Heritage Council of NSW funded an archaeological survey of the site (in 1977), which may be dedicated for an open space reserve within a residential release area, to identify historic remains of the orphanage. The survey report traced the site's history as a sizable administrative and domestic establishment which functioned in conjunction with its agricultural estate, known as New Farm, located nearby. The orphanage, important in the development of social welfare in the country, represents one of the earliest attempts at a combined welfare and training programme. This was due to the social and educational policies of the institution's administrators. The institution was closely associated with prominent colonial figures, in particular Rev. Samuel Marsden, Archdeacon Scott, Rev. Cartwright, Governor Lachlan Macquarie and James Busby. Bonnyrigg House was built in 1826 as the master's residence, and the only complete example of ALexander Kinghorne's building design. Kinghorne was a civil engineer whose name has been briefly connected with colonial institutional building programmes at this time. Examination of the site has identified structural remains and other evidence of occupation attributed to the orphanage period.HCNSW, 1977 Since then many housing estates have emerged in Fairfield, particularly in the 1980s. Bonnyrigg House is now privately owned and still used as a residence.  Description  The land adjoining the former Orphanage site forms part of the original curtilage of the property. It has now lost its visual association with the former superintendent's house. The site contains a very large eucalyptus, a large Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) as well as remnant agricultural plantings, including several fruit/citrus trees and a grape vine. There are a few remaining posts from fencing that would have once divided up the property. There is also a large oleander (Nerium oleander) hedge along the boundary separating the house from the former garden. Dormitory Block The position of this structure has been located on land presently (1981) owned by Mr & Mrs Oliver, and is partly covered by a large shed. Scatters of brick identify the position of the brick building with stone quoins which was partly standing as recently as 1976. Examination of the site has identified structural remains and other evidence of occupation which is attributed to the orphanage period. This includes: \\\\- a bore, located NE of Bonnyrigg house, probably sunk by James Busby in his search for water for the institution; * a flat raised rectangular mound located N of Bonnyrigg House. This is clearly visible in aerial photographs and may be the site of the \\"school\\" building; * evidence of a brick path; * an area of stone and brick paving which may relate to a dairy; * brick clamps, visible in aerial photographs; * considerable scatters of surface artefacts in the ploughed field immediately S of Bonnyrigg House.Temple & Davies, 1981 = Condition = As at 28 October 2003, The northern strip of the site has high archaeological potential as the original school and hospital were located there and it is likely that sub-surface remnants of these structures and associated artefacts would be located there. Site subject to theft of early bricks, and rubbish dumping. ARCHAEOLOGICAL POTENTIAL In regard to the subject site (which forms part of land designated by Thorp 1982 as Site A, or the \\"primary\\" site) she concluded that: \\\\- The site represents the primary area of occupation of the first male orphan school in Australia; * It was unique in terms of its organisation and objectives until much later in the (Nineteenth) Century; * It has close associations with some of the most prominent early figures in the ecclesiastical establishment, viz Samuel Marsden, Archdeacon Scott, Charles Cowper and the Reverend Cartwright. Lachlan Macquarie, James Busby and Alexander Kinghorne are also associated with the School; and * It has close association(s) with our early technological, social, political, ecclesiastic, and economic history and development. Initial work undertaken by Douglas (2004) entailed a review of available information set out in previous archaeological assessments, and in particular an examination of evidence indicating the locations of historic buildings associated with the Male Orphan School.Thorp 1982 and 1986, Godden Mackay Logan 2001 Douglas (2004) noted that the previous studies had been unable to locate detailed plans of the site during the period when the Male Orphan School was in operation. Douglas identified the 1863 map,NSW AO Map 10276 prepared approximately fifteen years after closure of the Orphan School including information regarding the School buildings, features and property divisions. The 1863 plan was obtained from the State Records Office, showing scaled details of the footprint of buildings associated with the former Male Orphan School as well as a number of possible structures established at the site after . This information was digitised and overlaid upon a current cadastral map of the locality incorporating the site in order to determine precise locations for buildings and features associated with the Male Orphan School in relation to the current property boundary. The overlay of the 1863 and current survey plans indicates that the main buildings associated with the Male Orphan School (Bull's Hill) complex are contained wholly within a zone formed by the current study area and the grounds of Bonnyrigg House. Physical inspection of the site did not contribute any information verifying the archaeological map for the site predicted by the review of historical sources Extensive fill has been dumped across the surface of the area in recent years, and a lush vegetation cover has developed, obscuring the ground surfaces. Site inspection, research and mapping of the site indicate that it formerly contained five discrete localities with potential to contain historic relics that would be disturbed by development. Two of these localities are located at the south west end of the site; the other three are situated near Homestead Rd. These are described below Proposed Stage 1 Development Area (Extension of Cartwright St and subdivision and sale of four residential allotments at the South of the SHR listed precinct) Feature 1 was once occupied by a long timber structure (approx. 35m by 3.5m), constructed by 1863, possibly after the transfer of the property into private hands, and which is of unidentified function. The structure is located along the eastern boundary of the proposed Lot 12. Feature 2 consists of the site once occupied by the Orphan School Dormitory Block. This was a brick structure, 4m x 17m on plan, currently located within the area of the proposed Cartwright St extension. It may extend slightly to the south into Lots 12 and 13. Proposed Stage 2 Development Area (Extension of Homestead Drive and subdivision and sale of six residential allotments to the north of the SHR listed precinct including the NE corner of Lot 210 included in the SHR listed precinct for Bonnyrigg House) Feature 3 consists of the former Male Orphan School Hospital site. This building was a timber structure, 4m x 17m on plan, with a centrally-located brick fireplace. It was enclosed by a timber fence. The indicative location of this site is within proposed allotments 15 and 16. Feature 4 is the site of the former Male Orphan School Storekeeper's Quarters. It was a brick structure, 4m x 17m on plan. Its indicative location is within the area of the proposed Barkly Close-Homestead Rd extension, but it may lie partly north of this area, within proposed allotments 14 and 15. Feature 5 is the indicative site of the Male Orphan School Dam. Its dimensions look to have been 5m x 20m on plan. It may have been partially filled in the east before the 1940s. This feature is said to have stone-lined drains that connected it with the surrounding building complex. Aerial photographs and early historic plans of the site suggest that the dam is located partly within the proposed Public ReserveLot 22 and partly within Lot 17. The overall setting of the house and curtilage has been severely compromised due to suburban housing development, poorly sited and designed. The house in itself has been compromised with unsympathetic alterations and additions. = Modifications and dates = Not known. 10/03 mature Monterey pine removed (Pinus radiata) - Council approval of DA, no s.60 = Further information = The house and the wider site area associated with the house should be integrated and interpreted to allow those who live in the area and those who might visit the site to be able to understand the house and its setting prior to its enclosure by mass market housing. The remnant plantings should be conserved, and any remaining structures or features protected.  Heritage listing  As at 5 May 1999, The site has high social and historical significance as the site of an early nineteenth century Male Orphanage and School and was one of few such institutions to be established at this time. It was the second such orphanage to be established in the colony, the associated Female orphanage being the first. The land adjoining the former orphanage is also of high significance for its use for pioneering work in viticulture by James Busby and early orcharding uses. The land (along with adjoining Bonnyrigg House - the former School Master's residence (a separate SHR item)) is all that remains of the once extensive grounds which were worked by the boys of the orphanage as a form of rehabilitation. The site has associations with James Busby and the development of the Australian wine industry. Busby was appointed to teach viticulture to boys at the Orphan School in 1825 and planted a vinyard here in 1825. While not the first to import or grow vines, Busby was the prophet of the Australian wine industry, publishing the first book (1825, Sydney) in Australia on wine growing and making, donating a huge private collection of European grape varieties to the Botanic Gardens, Sydney in 1833 (which was thence distributed across the state, to SA and Victoria), and responsible for the first plantings in the Hunter Valley in 1825. Wine from the Orphan School estate was exported receiving favourable mention in England in 1831.Stuart Read, from Norrie, P., Vineyards of Sydney, 1990 and Ramsden, E. James Busby, Prophet of Australian Viticulture, 1941) The area has historic and archaeological significance as the primary site of the first Male Orphan School in Australia from 1826-1840, during which time it was a sizable administrative and domestic establishment which functioned in conjunction with its agricultural estate, known as New Farm, located nearby. The orphanage, important in the development of social welfare in Australia, represents one of the earliest attempts at a combined welfare and training programme, due to the social and educational policies of the institution's administrators. The institution was closely associated with prominent colonial figures, including Samuel Marsden, Archdeacon Scott, Reverend Cartwright, Governor Macquarie and James Busby. The site has identified structural remains and other evidence of occupation which is attributed to the orphanage period. It has potential archaeological significance, with potential to provide information on the functions, layout and activities of the orphanage and its growth and decline. ARCHAEOLOGICAL REMAINS The Male Orphan School site has the potential to provide physical evidence relating to the welfare, training and education of destitute and under-privileged male children in this period. The archaeological remains of the site represent the most complete record available of the style and distribution of buildings and amenities made available to the boys housed at the school. This evidence has a potential to provide a voice to the otherwise silent orphans and to reveal their experiences within the institution. The material culture of the site can help to reveal the processes of the institution, revealing a complex combination of purpose, intention, belief and action that is not necessarily discernible in the historical record. The archaeological resource also has the potential to address broader research questions relating to such issues as social welfare policy, institutional practices, health and education. In addition, this physical evidence has high comparative value in relation to the Rydalmere Female Orphan site, in terms of investigating differences in gender roles, perceptions and expectations in the early colonial period.Godden Mackay Logan, 2001 summarised by Peter Douglas 2004 Land Next to Male Orphan School was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site has historical significance for the experimental agricultural work which was undertaken by the boys of the Orphan School with the help of assigned labour. The establishment of vineyards and cotton crops on the farm were amongst the earliest of their kind and the diversity of crops and flocks were unusual for the period. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The site has aesthetic significance as an important remnant of early agricultural attempts in the district. It provides an important visual context for the former Orphan School and allows interpretation of its former setting and function. The site has further significance as an essential visual break in the monotony of the surrounding urban development which no longer allows interpretation of the cultural and historic landscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Homestead along with the adjoining land is of high social significance as one of very few sites of its type established in the early part of the nineteenth century. It is of particular value for its demonstration of early and mid- Victorian attitudes to social welfare. The site has further significance as one of the earliest examples of the \\"self help\\" doctrine through the provision of training courses in trades for the boys housed there as evidenced by their work on the orchards, vineyards and cotton crops established on the site. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has technical/research significance through its association with early viticulture and cotton cropping techniques and other associated pastoral activities, undertaken at a time when such diversity of cropping was extremely unusual. The site allows investigation into Colonial farming practices and attitudes to social welfare at the time. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. A rare example of the grounds associated with a Colonial homestead that was itself associated with a social welfare institution. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The site is representative of the early attempts to develop a social welfare system utilising the \\"self-help\\" doctrine and demonstrates the implementation of this approach.

They have long been used in Asian countries, particularly China for entertainment, tracking and to deter attack by birds of prey. The practice was once common but is now much less widespread owing to increasing urbanisation and regulation of pigeon keeping. A modern version of the device, based on specimens held at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, has been developed by musician Nathaniel Mann. Mann has performed with the devices attached to racing pigeons at festivals across the United Kingdom.  Description and history  Pigeon whistles are small devices fitted to pigeons that emit a noise as the bird flies through the air. They have been used in China, where they are known as geling or geshao, since at least the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) and also in Japan and Indonesia. Traditionally they were made from lightweight bamboo or from gourds and attached to the pigeon by a toggle fixed between its tail feathers - causing no harm to the bird. They are used to deter birds of prey, for entertainment and as a means of an owner recognising their pigeons. They have been used in Taiwan on racing pigeons and may also have been used by the American Army. The carrier pigeons used by banking houses in Peking to carry reports were fitted with particularly intricate whistles carved with animal head designs and capable of emitting a number of different tones at once. During the 1986 visit of Queen Elizabeth II to China a flock of pigeons fitted with whistles was released in Tiananmen Square. Owing to the progress of urban development and increasing regulation of pigeon keeping the sound of the pigeon whistle, commonly heard in cities before the 1990s, has become rare in modern China. Whilst in the 1970s there might have been 5–6 people in each street of Beijing keeping pigeons with whistles it is said to be rare to find even one person doing so in a whole district of the modern city. The modern practice has been documented by Colin Chinnery, a British consultant who has made sound recordings for exhibitions at a museum about traditional Beijing cultures in Dongcheng District. The Oxford-based Pitt Rivers Museum contains examples of traditional Chinese and Indonesian whistles (including one mounted on a taxidermy pigeon) as well as more modern types.  Mann revival  Nathaniel Mann, composer in Residence at Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford became interested in the museum's collection of pigeon whistles in the early 2010s. He had first come across them in a display cabinet in the early 2000s and his interest was piqued as he had no idea what sound they would make. He placed an advert in British Homing World, a pigeon racing magazine, looking for birds that he could attach whistles to, but received no response. The National Pigeon Association put him in touch with Pete Petravicius (known as \\"Pigeon Pete\\"), a pigeon racer. Upon first making contact Petravicius thought that Mann was a prank caller; however, the pair soon began a collaboration. Mann first tried mounting some wooden whistles he had sourced from Java to the birds but these proved too heavy. He experimented with his own whistles made from ping pong balls, dog whistles and plastic egg shells before settling for a design made from a film canister, lolly sticks and old vinyl records. He has also experimented with 3D printed whistles. Mann's whistles are mounted to the birds by securing together two of their tail feathers and securing the whistle between them with a toggle. Petravicius is the only person in the United Kingdom to have trained pigeons to return to a mobile loft (his is mounted on a moped). This is essential to the performance as otherwise the birds would quickly return to their home loft, leaving the intended audience behind. Petravicius' Birmingham Rollers are well suited to the task as they are able to make quick, acrobatic turns. The sound of the whistle varies depending on the movement of the wings, acceleration of the pigeon, wind speed, wind direction and the positions of pigeons within the flock. The effect of Mann and Petravicius' displays has been described as \\"unlike any other phenomenon\\", with Petravicius describing it as \\"rubbish on record but brilliant live\\". They have toured the performance to festivals across the country, initially for 15 minute performances but later for longer periods, with Mann accompanying the pigeons with folk songs. The audience is asked to lie down on the grass to experience the performance. Mann proposed a collaboration with American performance artist Baby Dee. The performance was premiered at the Brighton Festival in May 2013 and in 2014 won the Butterworth Prize for Composition.

She was a daughter of Dr. Daniel Arter. From her parents she inherited her tastes and talent for literature. Her education was received in the schools of the sparsely-settled county, but she supplemented her deficient schooling by earnest self-culture and wide reading. Career In Pulaski County, December 31, 1863, she married Wood Rittenhouse (born 1835–1896), a prominent business man of Cairo, Illinois. Their family included one daughter and four sons: Isabella Maud, Wood Arter, Harry H., Fred M. and Robin C. Rittenhouse. After her marriage, for many years, Rittenhouse was able to spare little time for literary work, but during the early 1890s, she was a frequent contributor to magazines and newspapers. Her best work was done in her short stories. She was a skillful writer of plots, and all her stories were carefully worked out to their logical ending. For years, her interests were given to the work of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and for that body, she toiled and wrote unceasingly. She was the first president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Cairo, serving in that office for many years. She was elected district president of that organization for four consecutive years, and for five years, she also served as district treasurer.

She was commissioned in 1996 and is currently in active service with the Littoral Combat Force, Philippine Fleet. It was initially designated as Fast Patrol Craft, and was numbered \\"DF-387\\", but later on was re-designated as a Patrol Gunboat, and was finally re- numbered as \\"PG-387\\". Another round of reclassification was made in April 2016, which re-designated the patrol gunboat as the coastal patrol craft \\"PC-387\\".  History  In 1989, the Philippines placed an order of 4 fast patrol craft with Trinity-Equitable (formerly Halter-Marine Equitable) for USD 9.4 million. The first of the four vessels, arrived on August 20, 1990, was named . The lead ship of the class was named after Jose Andrada, who was one of the original officers of the Offshore Patrol of the Philippine Commonwealth government. In April 1990, the Philippines ordered an additional ship and 3 more ships in August 1990. In March 1993, eleven more vessels were ordered. A total of 22 ships were acquired by the Philippine Navy by 1999.  Ship design  Her class was built to U.S. Coast Guard standards, with an aluminium hull and superstructure. In addition, a 4-meter rigid inflatable boat powered by a 40-hp outboard motor is stowed amidships. She has a complement of 12. The ship is equipped with a Raytheon AN/SPS-64(V)11 Navigation/Surface Search Radar, but with a smaller antenna as those used in bigger Philippine Navy ships. Like all other Philippine Navy ships, the entire class was installed with the Philippine Navy Vessel Tracking System (VTS) by the Naval Sea Systems Command. = Armament = The ships of her class are armed with one 25mm Bushmaster chain gun on Mk 38 Mod 0 mount on second and later batches (PG-379 to PG-395), four M2HB Browning 12.7 mm/50 caliber machine guns on Mk 26 mounts, with two positioned forward and two aft; and two M60 7.62 mm/30 caliber machine guns, both mounted amidships. The ship can carry 4,000 rounds of 12.7 mm and 2,000 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition. A large \\"Big Eyes\\" binocular is also carried on tripod mounts, one on the forecastle and one just abaft the mast. = Propulsion = She is powered by two Detroit Diesel 16V-92TA Diesel Engines with a combined power of around 2,800 hp, driving two propellers for a maximum speed of .

Its approximate duration is 11 minutes. Background The initial inspiration for the piece came from a poem by Leconte de Lisle about the Aeolids, daughters of the keeper of the winds Aeolus. The work, begun early in 1875, didn't go well until Franck came for summer vacation in Languedoc. He finished the piece in September 1875 and revised it in 1876. The instrumentation was completed on June 7, but a performance was a difficult task, as at that time the Société Nationale de Musique rarely organised orchestral concerts. The piece was premiered on May 13, 1877 on the 70th concert of the Société in the Salle Érard (Paris). Although he had mauled Franck's oratorio Rédemption some years earlier, Édouard Colonne was appointed to conduct. Les Éolides were well-received by the public. A revival of the piece in February 1882 under Charles Lamoureux's baton might have impelled Franck to compose his next symphonic poem, Le Chasseur maudit, and the orchestral colours of Les Éolides made their way into his last instalment in that genre, Psyché (1888). Instrumentation ;Woodwinds *2 Flutes *2 Oboes *2 Clarinets (in A) *2 Bassoons ;Brass *2 Horns (in E) *2 Cornets (in E) *2 Trumpets (in E) ;Percussion *Timpani *Suspended cymbal ;Harp ;Strings *Violins *Violas *Cellos *Basses Structure The first (motto) theme The second (main) theme (a) The second (main) theme (b) The second (main) theme (c) The woodwinds motive The third theme (clarinet stave, transposed) Les Éolides is a symphonic poem with a complex structure slightly resembling the sonata form. There are three main themes, two of which are in A major (that is the first subject), while the last is stated in F minor (second subject). A long development section begins with a new statement of the second theme, but it soon gives place for proper thematic development, ending with a slower tempo section based mainly on the third theme (E major). In the recapitulation the A major themes return, and a slower tempo section is heard again, this time in the home key (thus it can be said to be a proper sonata form). After this comes a short coda. The first theme (Allegretto vivo) gives thematic material for the whole piece. It is a lilting ascending melody played by the strings and then accompanied by the woodwinds. However, one soon realises that it is a motto and serves as just an introduction to the main (second) theme, which is much more joyful and vigorous. This theme consists of three sections: the most important is the first one (ascending; bars 79—90), while the second (descending; 103—110) is just an answer for it and a transition to the third, that is build around the tonic (111—118). Their statement is followed by a characteristic 'windy' motive in the woodwinds, which is used much in later portions of the work, mostly to accompany other melodies, but sometimes independently. The music reaches its summit, and now comes the motto theme again, triumphant, with elegant harp arpeggios supporting its breathings. The woodwinds motive emerges to the foreground, and at last the key changes to Franck's favourite F minor. Upon this the clarinet introduces the sorrowful third theme (171—180). The same motive accompanies the development section. It begins with the main theme in A major, whose second section is omitted, and the first one is reworked again and again. After a climax the motto theme enters in C major, played by horns and violins. It is rounded by the cornets with the third section of the main theme. The tempo becomes slower (Un poco più lento) to let the violins sing the third theme, now in E major. However, it is constantly disturbed by the scattered elements of the main theme in other voices. The music modulates to A major, and the main theme rallies its forces (Tempo I) to begin the recapitulation. All the three sections of this theme are heard. The remnants of the woodwinds motive lead to the motto theme, played at first in E and then in A major. It goes directly into another slow tempo section (Un poco più lento), where the third theme is given in the home key. In the coda (Tempo del inizio) the motto and the main theme are heard simultaneously. The woodwinds motive marks a transition to the third theme concluding the piece.

Unable to contact the planet, Captain Kirk leads Spock, Sulu and M'Ress to the surface, finding the colony under attack by 20th century Earth vehicles without pilots. They attempt to defend against the assault, when a large truck appears, shielding them from the blasts. Mistakenly believing the truck is an attacker, Kirk fires his phaser, damaging it. The truck transforms into Optimus Prime, asking Kirk to protect the humans before collapsing. The other vehicles reveal themselves as Decepticons and prepare to eliminate the away team. Soundwave's sonic weaponry inadvertently disrupts the static interference blocking communication with the Enterprise, allowing Kirk to order a photon torpedo strike on the Decepticons and forcing them to retreat. The Decepticons follow a homing signal to a nearby moon, where they find Trypticon's fortress mode being controlled by Klingons led by Commander Kuri. Discovering their shared hatred of humans, Megatron proposes an alliance with the Klingons. Interested on learning more from the unconscious Prime, Kirk calls Scotty and McCoy to the surface to revive him. Spock detects similar energy to Prime's within the nearby mine, and Kirk leads a team to investigate, finding a large metal wall bearing the Autobot insignia. The wall bursts open, revealing more Autobots, and Jazz demands to know what has happened to Optimus Prime. =Issue 2: \\"Prime's Directive, Part Two\\"= Spock decides to try and read Optimus Prime's mind, and thus utilizes a Vulcan mind meld. He learns about the planet Cybertron, Orion Pax, and Megatron. But then Spock is overwhelmed, and McCoy has to break the psychic link to save his friend. Prime however regains consciousness. He thanks the Enterprise trio for their efforts, intrigued by Spock's non-human ability to probe minds. Spock in turn introduces himself, McCoy and Scotty, and proceeds to update Optimus Prime on recent developments. He concludes by declaring that Prime is now the only robot left on Cygnus Seven, to which the Autobot leader surprisingly contradicts him. Commander Kuri admits that it was a confrontation with Kirk and the Enterprise that forced the Klingons to crash land near Trypticon. Megatron is scornful as to why the Decepticons should require their assistance, so Kuri offers his new allies the use of a Klingon cloaking device. The first contact between Kirk's away team and the unusually aggressive Autobots deteriorates into an all-out brawl. Kirk tries to negotiate a truce to the hostilities, insisting that Optimus Prime is being tended to by Starfleet personnel. Bumblebee explains that when the humans commenced World War III, the abandoned Autobots left 20th Century Earth in Fortress Maximus to search for Energon deposits. The Decepticons ambushed them in deep space in Trypticon, and the resulting battle caused both robot factions to crash on Cygnus Seven. The mining colony there unknowingly restarted the autonomous repair protocols within Fortress Maximus, only for the Decepticons to be revived first. Spock is in the process of notifying Lt. Arex of the situation below, when the Klingons suddenly de-cloak and launch a blistering attack on the Enterprise. Optimus Prime (en route to the mine with Spock, McCoy and Scotty) is simultaneously forced to take refuge from the Decepticons, who seal the mine entrance once again. Ratchet proposes a daring plan to revive Fortress Maximus, to which Kirk pledges support. =Issue 3: \\"Prime's Directive, Part Three\\"= The Decepticons rampage against the Cygnus Seven miners. Optimus Prime (despite being damaged) physically protects the colonists, while Spock and Scotty do their best to drive off the attackers. McCoy reprimands Prime for his recklessness, comparing his action to something which Kirk then attempt. Scotty then notices that they haven't heard back from the mine away team. Kirk meanwhile is being subjected to a two-way neural scan by Ratchet, deep within the Autobot base. The device not only imparts Cybertronian robotic date to Kirk, but also studies his memories for technical specifications regarding a very familiar Federation starship. The Decepticons eventually corner Optimus Prime, the miners, Spock, Scotty and McCoy. Starscream issues Prime an ultimatum to surrender, but Spock volunteers to take his place. Kuri then beams down from a hovering Bird-of-Prey to personally gloat over the Klingon Empire's apparent victory over the Federation. Spock (with Prime's support) requests that the miners be released. The Decepticons however refuse to show leniency, and prepare to destroy Optimus Prime. The Decepticons are thwarted by the timely intervention of the USS Enterprise (inexplicably arriving out of the mine, and adorned with an Autobot symbol). The other Autobots (accompanied by Sulu and M'ress) also emerge to engage the Decepticons in combat. Closer interior inspection of the \\"starship\\" reveals it to really be a gigantic Cybertonian construct. Kirk is mentally powering the vessel, while Ratchet once again monitors his human vital signs. The Bird-of-Prey suddenly reveals itself to be a camouflaged Trypticon, who promptly repels the counterattack. Optimus Prime tries to warn Spock and his colleagues to take cover, only to be blindsided by Megatron. Kuri orders his Klingon soldiers to commence massacring the overall enemy, but the Enterprise construct manages to transport the miners, several crew members, and the odd Autobot safely on board. The single-handed effort of piloting the construct is exhausting Kirk. But when Trypticon threatens the Enterprise and everyone aboard and near it, he follows Ratchet's guidance and mentally instructs the vessel—to transform. The massive humanoid figure of Fortress Tiberius instantaneously appears, an incredible amalgamation of Autobot and Starfleet technology! =Issue 4: \\"Prime's Directive, Part Four\\"= The newly configured Fortress Tiberius utters a stentorian battle cry as he executes a masterful counter-offensive against Trypticon, scoring several successive strikes. But complications soon arise, within. Despite Ratchet's best advice, the fragmented resonant emotions of Fortress Maximus (whose former body now houses the duplicate Enterprise) seriously begin to corrupt Kirk's concentration and coordination. McCoy reports that the miners (plus himself, Spock, Scotty and Arcee) are becoming traumatized by the extremity of the outer conflict. And Spock is quick to illustrate the fact that Kirk would seriously violate Starfleet protocol, should he actually destroy Trypticon. Megatron is astonished at the existence of a human- controlled Cybertronian Titan, but is nonetheless confident that Trypticon will emerge victorious. Kuri is equally amazed, especially since Starscream has apparently been conducting secret negotiations with the Klingon crew, assuring them of automatic victory. But during the erupting pandemonium, Starscream secretly infiltrates the dilithium containment facility beneath Cygnus Seven, revealing an even more grandiose objective in mind. The mentally conflicted Kirk momentarily hesitates during combat, thus allowing Trypticon to retaliate with a fireball attack. But with Ratchet's assistance, Kirk eventually regains control of his faculties, thus allowing Fortress Tiberius to deliver a near knockout punch to Trypticon. Optimus Prime meanwhile fights back against Megatron, bolstered by the eventual arrival of Jazz, Bumblebee, Wingblade, Sulu and M’ress. Loaded with pilfered dilithium, Starscream then attempts to escape unseen. Megatron (after finally turning on and betraying his supposed Klingon collaborators) spots his departure and becomes obsessed with hunting down and punishing the traitor. The Decepticons retreat to pursue the fugitive Starscream, and Spock beams down from Fortress Tiberius to reunite with a triumphant Sulu and M’ress. With the aid of the remaining Autobots, they have successfully apprehended the abandoned Kuri and his soldiers. The real Enterprise is still drifting helplessly in space, following the earlier ambush. Uhura is shocked to receive a message to her mayday transmission – from Captain Kirk (still mentally piloting Fortress Tiberius, travelling in identical starship mode). While the Klingons are transported to the brig, Spock and most of the other Starfleet personnel are beamed back on deck, and the Autobots are safely deposited in the hangar bay. A second (and more concrete) alliance has been formulated, in order to pursue the Decepticons into Klingon occupied territory (although Kirk realises that to do so would be a considered an act of war by the Empire). The inhabitants of Kronos however have a more immediate threat to contend with – Starscream has finally landed. And he has conquest on his mind! =Issue 5: \\"Prime's Directive, Part Five (Conclusion)\\"= The Enterprise and its Cybertronian replica maintain a synchronized orbit over Cygnus Seven, where all respective parties confer on the current situation. Kirk (aided by Ratchet and McCoy aboard Fortress Tiberius) consults with Spock (the acting captain aboard the real Enterprise) as to the logistics of invading the Klingon Empire. Spock agrees with Kirk's sentiment to take action, but stresses the star-ship's current weakened state. Scotty agrees with the structural diagnosis. Optimus Prime then volunteers that he and his fellow Autobots will continue alone into Klingon Space to stop the Decepticons. Kirk insists that the Autobots will require back-up support, but does agree with Prime's noble resolve, citing the Federation's most important law (the Prime Directive), an oath of non- interference with developing cultures. Optimus Prime then delivers an oath of his own, the thus termed Prime's Directive: \\"By action or inaction, I shall allow Cybertronians to cause no harm to any civilization, no matter their relationship with my allies!\\" The Klingon High Council meanwhile hold an emergency meeting on Kronos, to discuss their own forces vanishing from Cygnus Seven, and multiple unidentified vessels trespassing through the Neutral Zone. Convinced that total war on the Federation is the only available solution, the Klingons are suddenly attacked by a monstrous metallic intruder who arrogantly declares himself the newly appointed Emperor Starscream the First! Kirk openly wrestles with the moral dilemma of not abandoning the Autobots, yet also not endangering his own crew. Optimus Prime empathizes with the Starfleet captain, admitting that he wished that he had more than one life to lay down for his comrades. This sympathetic comment suddenly gives Kirk an idea, then asking Scotty how much inorganic matter the shipboard replicators could generate within the six-hour timeframe to reach the Klingon home-world. Emperor Starscream threatens the Klingons with instantaneous death (should they refuse to accept his rule). But since the average Klingon believes death is a worthy honour, the High Council openly laugh in his face. An enraged Starscream fires a warning shot to enforce his threat, but the capitol building is then bombarded, and Starscream is soon dethroned by Megatron and the other Decepticons. Megatron orders Soundwave to marshal the new Klingon workforce for immediate dilithium mining, but is soon interrupted by the arrival of the transformed Fortress Tiberius, the Autobots - and several perfectly replicated battle suits of Cybertronian armour (specifically piloted by Spock, Scotty, Sulu, and M'ress). Kirk also reveals that he has pardoned Commander Kuri and his crew for past crimes, the Decepticon's former allies now having changed sides and encouraging their fellow Klingons to help repel the evil robots. Megatron orders the Decepticons to launch an all-out offensive against the combined resistance, and quickly gains the upper hand via Soundwave orchestrating a second sonic barrage. A confident Megatron savours his victory over Optimus Prime, duly informing Kirk that he intends to next conquer Earth. Kuri however informs Megatron that Klingons are thankfully immune to sonic attacks, and that Kirk (while having the Cybertronian armour replicated) discovered certain imperfections to exploit, passing the information on to the grateful Klingons. Newly modified Birds-of-Prey then materialise above the Kronos landscape, promptly dispatching the now vulnerable Decepticons. An avenged Kuri announces that the Decepticons clearly underestimated his race, the Klingons were more than meets the eye! The Federation manages to negotiate a somewhat tenuous truce with the Klingon Empire, who stipulate that they alone must assume responsibility of the Decepticons. The triumphant Autobots assume independent control of their newly renovated Titan, with Optimus Prime pledging continual allegiance to both Kirk and the Federation. Fortress Tiberius then embarks on an unspecified mission to the final frontier, and Kirk (on behalf of the entire Enterprise crew) wishes their newfound friends a safe journey with the following adapted cultural farewell: \\"Live Long, Autobots - and ROLL OUT!\\"  Reception  The series has met with a positive response, and Philip Murphy's artistic direction was praised. WhatCulture did not expect a good result from combining animated Star Trek and Transformers, yet they credited the IDW as making it work.

History  St Ninian's Church was built on land which was owned by the renowned philanthropist Henry Noble; the construction cost was also met from Noble's estate. Built in the Gothic Revival style, the architect was W.D. Caroe. It is thought that the dedication to St Ninian reflects Noble's Cumbrian heritage (he was born at Clifton, Cumbria) and the county's association with St Ninian. On 6 July 1913 the Bishop of Sodor and Man conducted the ordination of the Reverend Gleave of St John's College, Cambridge, who was admitted a deacon and became the first curate of the church.Ramsey Courier, Friday, July 11, 1913; Page: 2 The first wedding in the newly-opened church was on 17 September 1913, when Peter Kissack married Vera Handley.Ramsey Courier, Friday, September 19, 1913; Page: 5 The imposing bell tower of St Ninian's Church.

Biography Eldridge was born in Wimbledon in London where her father was pawnbroker who later became a jeweller. She attended Wimbledon School of Art before studying at the Royal College of Art where she was taught by William Rothenstein and Eric Ravilious. In her final year at the RCA, Eldridge won the Prix de Rome prize and a scholarship to study at the British School in Rome. Returning to England in 1936 she worked, along with Evelyn Dunbar, Charles Mahoney and others, on a large scale set of murals based on Aesop's fables at Brockley County Secondary School, now the upper site of Prendergast School in Brockley. In 1937 Eldridge held a very successful solo show at the Beaux Arts Gallery in London. Later that year she moved to Oswestry where she taught at Oswestry Grammar School and Moreton Hall School in Shropshire. Following a 1939 commission, executed with Muriel Minter, for a stained-glass window at Llanpumsaint parish church, Eldridge moved to Wales. There she married the poet and Anglican priest RS Thomas, whom she had met while teaching in Oswestry. She designed the dust- jacket for his first volume of published poems, Stones of the Field in 1947 and in due course, works by Eldridge would decorate a number of the churches that Thomas served and preached in. She also worked with the Recording Britain and the Recording Wales projects throughout the 1940s to create depictions of war damaged, or otherwise at risk, buildings. Eldridge taught as a lecturer in the extra-mural department of the University of Wales from 1953 and also returned to mural painting in the mid-1950s. She created a 120 foot long, multi-panel, work The Dance of Life for the dining room of the nurses home at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital near Oswestry. The mural, which depicts wildlife among Welsh and Italian landscapes and illustrates the negative impact of human activities upon nature, took Eldridge three years to complete, and has been described by the art historian Peter Lord as \\"one of the most remarkable large-scale works ever painted in Wales\\". The mural was put into storage in 1999 but from 2011 has been on public display at Glyndwr University. Eldridge had a number of solo exhibitions during her career, notably at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth during 1959 and at the Powys Fine Art Room in Welshpool in 1961. She exhibited in group shows with the Royal Watercolour Society, with the Royal Cambrian Academy, the Royal Scottish Academy and at the Royal Academy while Abbott and Holder hosted a memorial exhibition in 1993.

The summer theatre is called an \\"amphitheatre\\" by locals, mainly because it is in the open, and also because of its almost semi-circular form, which recalls the typical shapes of the Roman theatres (although not amphitheatres).  History  In 1973, architect-engineer Temo Vito projected the theatre within the Grand Park of Tirana. He did so taking into consideration the green park around the area. The main problem were some century-old olive trees, which, according to local beliefs could not be cut. This was circumvented by transferring those olive trees in a nearby area, work that was conducted under the supervision of agronomist Abedin Çiço. Construction of the theatre was performed by the government-owned company \\"21 dhjetori\\", and the theatre was inaugurated in spring 1974. It has a stage, the podium, dressing rooms for the artists and a technical room for projectors, and can be used as a concert stage, as well as a movie theatre. After the 1990s the summer theatre was abandoned and the seats were almost fully ruined by the elements. The town hall of Tirana started the rehabilitation in the fall of 2017 and on 30 May 2018 the theatre re-opened, with a night concert given by the Albanian Armed Forces band, the orchestra of the Radio Televizioni Shqiptar, led by Noorman Widjaja, violinist Olen Cesari, and the school of ballet students, for a total number of 400 artists participating in the event.

Early career As a youngster, Luk participated in annual summer soccer camps in Hong Kong, sponsored by McDonald's. He initially played as a forward but because his technical ability was poor, he later switched to goalkeeper. While growing up in Tuen Mun, Luk joined a youth football program run by the father of Tsun Dai. During this time, he was coached by former South China star Shum Kwok Pui. Following Eastern's promotion to the 2007–08 Hong Kong First Division, the club absorbed the program under their academy system and Luk trained as an Eastern youth player for the season. At the conclusion of the season, Luk left to join Hong Kong Rangers' academy for a season. Club career In 2010–11, Tuen Mun were promoted to the Hong Kong First Division and offered Luk a professional contract. Because Luk was 16 at the time, he needed his parents to co-sign the contract and as well, he was restricted to only one training session a week with the club. Despite beginning the season as Tuen Mun's third choice keeper, Luk earned his first start on 23 April 2011 in a 2–1 loss to Sun Hei. During the 2013–14 season, Tuen Mun were expelled from the league halfway through the season, leading the cancellation for Luk's contract. The following summer, Luk signed with Yuen Long after being lured by the opportunity to work with head coach Fung Hoi Man. Upon Fung's departure to Hong Kong Rangers ahead of the 2016–17 season, Luk followed him. He won the starting job midway through the season when first choice keeper Chiu Yu Ming suddenly quit the club in order to become a C&ED; officer. Ahead of the 2017–18 season, Lee & Man decided to withdraw their sponsorship of Rangers in order to form their own club in the Hong Kong Premier League. Both Luk and Fung decided to join Lee Man. For the first time in his career, Luk became the first choice keeper for his club and started all 18 league matches for Lee Man. On 24 July 2018, following a preseason friendly, Hoi King confirmed that they had signed Luk. This marked the third time Luk had followed Fung to a new club, the fourth time he has played for him and the first time Luk had done so for a club which was owned by Fung. On 29 July 2019, Tai Po revealed that Luk would join the club. On 20 October 2020, Luk was named as one of 17 new players for Pegasus.

History  The NTWF was founded in 1988 in order to advance \\"Traveller women's rights [as] human rights, equality, cultural recognition, solidarity, liberation, collective action, anti-sexism, anti- racism [and] self-determination\\". The Forum developed out of the Dublin Travellers Education and Development Group (DTEDG), with the Group initially funding and supporting the Forum.  Core activities  The NTWF's vision is \\"Traveller Women have achieved full equality and their identity is celebrated.\\" It has worked in the fields including unemployment, accommodation, and discrimination and plans to work on supporting traveller women in prison. They also have highlighted the issues Traveller women face regarding mental and physical health, in particular the discrepancy between the life expectancy of Traveller community in comparison to the settled community.

Alongside other Traveller advocacy groups including Minceirs Whiden, Irish Traveller Movement, and Pavee Point, the Forum conducts periodic surveys of the Travelling community and perceptions of the settled community. In 2019, with Tallaght Traveller Community Development Project and Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group, the Forum called on the Irish government to pay members of the Travelling community reparations for the racism they have identified within the policies of the Irish State. The Forum also campaign on the accessibility of education to Traveller children, and the effects of government policy educational outcomes for these children in comparison to their settled peers. With over 20 groups including Amnesty International Ireland, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, and the Irish Refugee Council, in January 2020 the Forum co-signed an open letter to the Irish government calling on politicians to not use \\"hate speech\\". In reaction to the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests, the Forum joined with other Travellers' groups to draw attention to the racism and prejudice experienced by their communities. The NTWF's co-ordinator is Maria Joyce. One of the group's active members, Eileen Flynn, is planning on running for the Seanad, having received a nomination from the Labour Party. The Forum has called for the establishment of a permanent senator for Travellers in the Seanad. After a case involving sexual abuse in a Traveller family over many years, the Forum and other Traveller women's advocacy groups highlighted the systemic failure of a number of state agencies that prolonged the abuse.

Early life Michael Lacey was born in Binghamton, New York; he went to Catholic schools in Newark, New Jersey, before moving to Arizona at attend Arizona State University. In response to the 1970 Kent State massacre, Lacey wanted flags at the University to be flown at halt-mast. Angered by being told that would not be done, Lacey and several friends started an alternative newspaper \\"to get the nuances of that point across. And to have a little fun.\\" \\"Mike Lacey was a Vietnam protester, an Irish kid from Jersey who’d dropped out of Arizona State.\\" As an alternative to the ultra-conservative Arizona Republic, he started a paper that \\"would cover politics, culture and music for the sex-drugs-rock’n’roll generation.\\" Newspaper career Further information: Village Voice Media The first weekly alternative newspaper was called the Arizona Times. Two years after the founding Jim Larkin joined as business manager. They were called Lacey’n’Larkin, the editor-publisher duo who, over the decades, bought and started alternative weeklies across the country. In the 1970s the newspaper went public, and Larkin and Lacey drifted away; they regained control and took it private in 1977, and renamed it the Phoenix New Times, with Lacey as editor and Larkin as publisher. From a circulation low of 16,000 in 1977, it grew to 140,000 by the 1990s, with annual revenue of $8.6 million Beginning in 1983 he and Larkin bought and started multiple other alternative newspapers, and by 2000 they owned eleven. In 2005 they bought the Village Voice and five others. The company had a market value of $400 million and a combined circulation of 1.8 million. A self-described \\"prick\\" who comes complete with \\"spiky gray hair, watery pale-blue eyes,\\" he was known for his bombastic style; he described his editorial philosophy as: “Our papers have butt-violated every goddamn politician who ever came down the pike! The ones who deserved it. As a journalist, if you don’t get up in the morning and say ‘fuck you’ to someone, why even do it?” There was a sense among his competitors that his papers were vicious corporate sharks, out to annihilate, not compete. To his employees-he was demanding with a volatile temper, he made enemies, but, was fiercely loyal to the people he liked, and, he drank. His papers were often known for unforgettable stories \\"with characters that burst off the page and plot twists no one could have predicted. These stories changed lives, cities, and occasionally landed the people at the center of them in front of a judge.\\" The good times did not last for print journalism, with the Internet devouring advertising profits. Lacey reacted to increased Internet advertising with Backpage.com, beginning in 2004, trying to maintain the company's hold on ads that traditional newspapers had largely shunned, adult services. It evolved out of the literal back page of the Phoenix New Times newspaper and morphed into a behemoth Internet marketplace. By 2010, after Craigslist shuttered its adult content section, Backpage.com had become the main financial driver of the company, then called Village Voice Media. In 2012 Lacey left journalism, selling his interests in 13 newspapers, but keeping ownership of Backpage. Lacey had a longstanding feud with Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, leading to a 2007 subpoena requesting the I.P. addresses of all who had visited the Phoenix New Times website over the past three years. When, as an act of civil disobedience, the Phoenix New Times published the subpoena, Lacey and Larkin were arrested for this act. Freed the next day, charges were dropped. Maricopa County settled with them for 3.75 million. The showdown with Arpaio added to Lacey's \\"already swashbuckling Media Bad Boy mythology.\\" $2 million of the settlement was used to help create an endowed chair of borderlands Professorship for the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University . Some of the funds were used to start a human rights and immigration initiative, the Lacey and Larkin Frontera Fund, largely to benefit the Hispanic community that \\"has borne the brunt of racial animus and civil rights abuses in Arizona.\\"Phoenix Business Journal recognizes Lacey Backpage Further information: Backpage The business was lucrative. The adult ads were among the few Backpage charged users to post. Backpage earned $135 million in 2014, according to a U.S. Senate report. A February 2015 appraisal said the company was worth more than $600 million At the time, Backpage was the largest online publisher of sex ads in the world with city-specific sites spanning 97 countries. In the 11 years since it had been launched, it had earned some $500 million for its owners. They were largely impervious to legal challenges because of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protected online publishers from civil or criminal penalties for hosting content posted by third parties. Legal momentum started to change in 2015 after a senate investigation. They were forced to hand over millions of pages of incriminating material. The Justice Dept. used this information to come up with a massive 93 count indictment in March 2018, that centered on Lacey and Larkin, and accused them, and other company officers, with money laundering, participating in a criminal conspiracy and facilitating prostitution. In April it was announced that Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer had pleaded guilty and will testify against other Backpage officials. Lacey spent a week in federal custody, released on April 13, 2018, with a $1 million bond. Lacey's attorneys claim he is protected by the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment. Company officials insists they hosted trafficking sites unwittingly. Backpage was shut down by federal authorities in April 2018.Backpage shut With the closure of Backpage, \\"devastated\\" sex workers turned to social media. To them, Backpage's demise meant the end of safeguards and a reliable revenue stream in a profession that's not going anywhere.

Originally coined by Abby Lippman in a series of three papers published in the 1990s (specifically in 1991, 1992, and 1994), geneticization refers to the increasing tendency to define differences between individuals as largely or entirely due to genetics. This includes the growing framing and understanding of human diseases and behaviors in genetic terms. Henk A. M. J. ten Have has defined geneticization as \\"...a heuristic tool that can help to re-focus the moral debate on the implications of new genetic knowledge towards interpersonal relations, the power of medicine, the cultural context and social constraints, rather than emphasizing issues as personal autonomy and individual rights.\\" It is common for social scientists and bioethicists to argue that geneticization leads to a growing belief in genetic determinism and essentialism in the general public, and that this, in turn, increases discrimination, stigma, and inequality. When Lippman originally coined the term \\"geneticization\\", for example, she was concerned about the potential for geneticization to increase public belief in biological essentialism, thereby reinforcing racism and discrimination against people with disabilities. Some proponents of the heuristic of geneticization also argue that the media's coverage of genetics contributes to geneticization. However, the empirical evidence on the link between geneticization and genetic determinism, and between genetic determinism, discrimination and inequality, is ambiguous, suggesting that the phenomenon of geneticization may not always follow the simple pattern that proponents of the concept ascribe to it.

She was a specialist sprinter, all but one of whose victories came over the minimum distance of five furlongs (1000 metres). After winning two minor races as a juvenile in 2015, she made progress throughout the following year, taking the Land O'Burns Fillies' Stakes and the City Walls Stakes before ending her season with a win in the Prix de l'Abbaye. In 2017 she added wins in the Palace House Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes and was sold at the end of the year for a record price of 6,000,000 guineas. Background Marsha is a bay mare with a small white star bred and owned by the Elite Racing Club. She was trained in Newmarket, Suffolk by Sir Mark Prescott and ridden in most of her races by Luke Morris. She was sired by Acclamation, a high-class sprinter who won the Diadem Stakes in 2003 and whose other progeny have included Dark Angel and Equiano. Marsha's dam Marlinka raced only as a two-year-old in 2010, showing considerable ability as she won three races including the Listed Prix des Reves d'Or over 1000 metres at Vichy. Marlinka's dam Baralinka was a half sister to Soviet Song and a distant relative of L'Attrayante. Racing career =2015: two-year-old season= Marsha began her racing career on 4 September in maiden race over six furlongs on the polytrack surface at Kempton Park Racecourse when she started at odds of 9/1 and finished second, beaten a length by Zhui Feng. Two weeks later, she recorded her first success in a maiden at Catterick Racecourse, taking the lead two furlong out and beating The Full Bloom by half length. For her last two races of the year the filly was sent to race on the polytrack at Dundalk Racecourse. On 9 October she started 8/15 favourite for a race over five furlongs and won \\"comfortably\\" by three and a quarter lengths from Go Kart. Two weeks later she was matched against older horses in the Listed Mercury Stakes and finished third behind the eight-year-old gelding Take Cover. =2016: three-year-old season= Marsha began her second season in a handicap race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 14 May in which she carried 126 pounds and finished second, beaten half a length by Show Stealer. When stepped up in class for the Group 3 Ballyogan Stakes at the Curragh she came home fifth of the nine runners, six and a half lengths behind the winner Divine. Two weeks after her defeat in Ireland the filly started 7/4 favourite for the Land O'Burns Fillies' Stakes over five furlongs at Ayr Racecourse. Ridden by Paul Mulrennan she pulled hard in the early stages before taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning \\"very readily\\" by two and a half length from Fine Blend. On 9 July at York Racecourse Marsha started 5/1 second choice in the betting behind the six-year-old Muthmir (winner of the 2015 King George Stakes) in the City Walls Stakes. She recovered from a poor start to gain the advantage in the final strides and win by a neck from Easton Angel. In the King George Stakes at Goodwood at the end of July she came home fifth in a blanket finish, beaten less than a length by the winner Take Cover. In September she was sent to France and finished second to the gelding Just Glamorous in the Prix du Petit Couvert over 1000 metres at Chantilly Racecourse. With Longchamp Racecourse closed for redevelopment the 2016 edition of the Prix de l'Abbaye was run over 1000 metres at Chantilly on 2 October. Marsha was made a 16/1 outsider while Mecca's Angel started 6/4 favourite in a seventeen-runner field. The other runners included Maarek (winner of the race in 2013), Profitable (King's Stand Stakes), Just Glamorous, Take Cover, Goldream, Ardad (Flying Childers Stakes), Cotai Glory (Molecomb Stakes) and the Aidan O'Brien-trained Washington DC. Just Glamorous set the pace before giving way to Mecca's Angel 300 metres from the finish at which point Marsha, who had been settled in mid-division, began to make rapid progress. Marsha caught Mecca's Angel well inside the last 100 metres and held off the fast-finishing Washington DC to win by three quarters of a length. =2017: four-year-old season= On her first run of 2017, Marsha, as a Group 1 winner, was required to carry a seven-pound weight penalty in the Palace House Stakes at Newmarket on 6 May and started the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Washington, D.C., Priceless and Muthmir. After being restrained by Morris towards the rear, she accelerated into the lead and kept on \\"gamely\\" to win by a neck and a length from Washington, D.C. and Goldream. In the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot in June Marsha started favourite but proved no match for the American filly Lady Aurelia, who won easily, and lost second place by a head to Profitable. Marsha was expected to return to winning form in the Sapphire Stakes at the Curragh in July and started the 1/2 favourite, but after taking the lead a furlong out she was caught on the line and beaten a short head by the eight-year-old gelding Caspian Prince. On 4 August she ran for the second time in the King George Stakes, but after experiencing some difficulty obtaining a clear run she came home third behind Battaash and Profitable. The Nunthorpe Stakes at York on 25 August attracted a field of eleven, and saw Marsha start at odds of 8/1. Lady Aurelia (ridden by Frankie Dettori) was made the odds-on favourite ahead of Battaash, while the other runners included Profitable, Washington DC, Priceless, Take Cover, Cotai Glory and Goldream. Lady Aurelia set off in front with Marsha being settled behind the leaders before making a forward move in the last quarter mile. Approaching the final furlong the race looked to be devolving into a three-way struggle between Lady Aurelia racing down the centre of the track, Battaash on the leader's right and Marsha racing up the stands-side rail. Battaash dropped from contention and the two fillies crossed the line together resulting in a photo finish. Dettori celebrated his presumed victory by punching the air and waving his whip to the crowd but the judge's decision was that Marsha had prevailed by a nose. At Chantilly in October, Marsha attempted to repeat her 2016 success in the Prix de l'Abbaye. After racing at the rear of the field she made rapid progress in the closing stages but was never able to pose a threat to Battaash and was beaten four lengths into second place. On her final racecourse appearance, the filly was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint at Del Mar Racetrack on 4 November and finished sixth of the twelve runners behind the 40/1 outsider Stormy Liberal. At the Tattersalls December mares sale on 5 December 2017 Marsha was put up for auction and was sold for a European record price of 6,000,000 guineas to Michael Magnier of the Coolmore Stud after a lengthy bidding duel with John Gosden.

Origins  Since it was part of the Magna Graecia, Apulia has ever been characterised by an important production of wine and table grape. Regarding the varieties included in Uva di Puglia PGI (Grapes of Apulia), the first evidence dates back to the end of the 19th century when Sergio Musci from Bisceglie started to successfully export it to the biggest cities of Northern Italy like Bologna, Milan and Turin. This type of grapes showed a great preservation of the organoleptic characteristics getting possible to export it to international markets without any problem. Therefore, at the beginning of the 20th century, Cav. Francesco De Villagomez from Bisceglie did the first exportation in Germany. In 1975, the export of Uva di Puglia amounted to 62,4% of the entire Italian table grape production destined for the foreign market. In 1985 it reached 74,1%.  Fruit characteristics  The varieties included in Uva di Puglia PGI are several. Among the white grapes, there are the varieties: Italia, Regina and Victoria, straw yellow- coloured. They have seeds, the pulp is crunchy and, above all the variety Italia has a Moscato flavour. The red variety is the Michele Palieri characterised by a dark colour and a less sweet taste while the pink one, the Red Globe is very sweet and it is perfect for making desserts and jam. The harvesting period starts during the second decade of July for the Victoria and the Michele Palieri and between the third decade of July and August for the other varieties. This product is rich in sugar as glucose and mannose and in mineral salts like potassium, iron and phosphorus. It is also rich in B vitamins and in C and K vitamin.  Geography  The area of production includes almost all the municipalities of Apulia under 330 m. below sea level (1082 ft.). Therefore, the villages of the area of the Subappennino Dauno are excluded. These lands are rich in calcium and potassium and are characterised by the mild climate also in winter.

The project was created to present a perspective of what this policy looked like at the ground level, to those actually serving in the military and was commissioned by the New York Times, and produced by both Dawson and SideXSide Studios. The film highlights Servicemembers, Partners, and Allies for Respect and Tolerance for All (SPARTA) (founded 2013, 2013, an association of LGBT people who have served in the U.S. armed forces) members Logan Ireland (Air Force) and Laila Villanueva (Army). This film was nominated for “Outstanding Short Documentary” at the 37th Annual News & Documentary Emmy Awards.  TransMilitary  Expanding on the 12 minute op-doc project, Transgender, at War and in Love, Dawson and Gabriel Silverman created the full-length documentary which follows the same military couple (who have completed 16 years of service, four deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq, and received numerous awards and accommodations). In 2018, the full-length documentary received the 2018 SXSW Audience Award. The original ban was lifted in 2016, however, Trump has been attempting to reinstate it.

Nagle was also a coordinator of the event \\"PINK Loves CONSENT.\\" Career In 2012, Rebecca Nagle and Hannah Brancato created a website called \\"Pink Loves Consent\\" which coincided with the Victoria Secret fashion show. The website appeared to look like the Victoria Secret website and features underwear with anti-rape slogans like \\"Consent is Sexy\\", \\"No Means No\\", and \\"Ask First\\". Nothing on the website was for sale, instead the website provided information about rape education. On December 4, 2012, lawyers from Victoria Secret forced the website to be taken down. They claimed that the website caused confusion among their customers. As a part of Nagle's project to create a national monument for sexual assault survivors, FORCE: Upsetting Rape Culture released a giant floating poem in the Reflecting Pool in front of the Washington National Monument. The floating poem read: \\"I Can't Forget What Happened But No One Else Remembers.\\" With Force co-founder Hannah Brancato, Nagle created The Monument Quilt to establish “a public healing space by and for survivors of rape and abuse”.

It aimed at uniting pro-independence political parties and organisations throughout Catalonia towards the common goal of establishing a Catalan Republic, regardless of political ideology. Its members included both independent figures from the civil society and aligned to the Together for Catalonia (JxCat) alliance—such as Quim Torra or Jordi Sànchez—as well as prominent members of the Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT), among others: former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, former regional ministers Josep Rull, Jordi Turull and Laura Borràs or party vice- president Míriam Nogueras. The party was merged into Puigdemont's new Together for Catalonia (Junts) on 19 July, after negotiations with the PDeCAT to form a joint list ahead of the next Catalan regional election foundered as a result of the latter's refusal to dissolve itself within JxCat. Overall, the Crida has been pointed out as unsuccessful in its main goal of uniting all pro- independence parties under its umbrella, with the party not having been fielded on its own to contest any single election, but its establishment and permanent stress on the PDeCAT has been said to help hasten the latter's internal crisis. History The Crida was established as a political platform on 16 July 2018, with Carles Puigdemont, Quim Torra and Jordi Sànchez being the driving force behind its establishment. On 8 January 2019 it was registered as a political party in the interior ministry, and on 26 January it held its constituent congress. Ahead of the April 2019 Spanish general election, party members voted against running on their own and in favour of joining an \\"unitary candidacy\\" of pro-independence parties together with the Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT). Failure in negotiations between both the PDeCAT and Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) for such a list ultimately ended in the Crida declaring that they would not contest the general election nor would formally supporting any candidacy, though it supported the participation of several of its members in the Together for Catalonia (JxCat) alliance. After the November 2019 Spanish general election, the party intended to stage a refoundation of the post-Democratic Convergence of Catalonia political space, bringing together the three political entities resulting from CDC's demise—the PDeCAT, JxCat and itself—either as a joint entity or in the form of a coalition, The CNxR did not rule out running on its own in an eventual election if an agreement with the PDeCAT was not possible, as it ruled out dissolving itself into a mere continuation of CDC's legacy. Negotiations stalled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resumed on June 2020. On 8 July 2020, it was proposed that the party be merged and subsequently dissolved into Carles Puigdemont's upcoming party—a new Together for Catalonia—on 25 July. As the Crida before it, the new Together for Catalonia party—whose establishment was unveiled on 2 July 2020—aimed at reorganizing the post-CDC space and bring together supporters of unilateral independence ahead of the next Catalan regional election, but unlike the CNxR it was to break all ties with the PDeCAT, after negotiations failed between the former and the latter to merge themselves into a new political force under the umbrella of JxCat (whose naming rights belonged to the PDeCAT). The Crida held a vote among its members from 16 to 18 July to decide on its ultimate fate, including a proposal providing for its transformation into a foundation and think tank within Puigdemont's new party, with over 95% of party members approving of the merger. Ideology With an ambition to unite social conservatives and left-wing supporters of Catalan independence, the party is a big tent and mass movement organisation with the main ideology of supporting Catalan independence and the establishment of a new Catalan Republic. It aims at serving as the umbrella for a single Catalan independence list, establishing a structure that mirrors the Scottish National Party, while some analysts have described it as \\"convergent peronism\\" and as a mixture of Chantal Mouffe's \\"populist moment and a reminiscence of the CDC's political project in the 1980s and 1990s which endep up identifying Jordi Pujol as the bulwark of Catalan nationalism. Former Catalan minister Ferran Mascarell argued that it intended to \\"trascend\\" political parties, whereas Together for Catalonia's spokesperson Gemma Geis claimed that it was \\"a tool\\" comprising \\"individual adhesions\\" and \\"not a political structure with party representative quotas\\". Internally, the party is said to possess three main ideological currents: left-wing, social democracy and liberalism. Other pro- independence political parties, such as Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), have repeteadly ruled out joining the CNxR, perceiving it as an hostile movement ultimately seeking to dilute them into Puigdemont's personal political project. Puigdemont's original party, the Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT)—direct successor to the late CDC—was also resistant to dilute itself into the CNxR, despite the joint participation of PDeCAT and Crida members in the JxCat alliance contesting the 2019 two Spanish general elections, local elections and that year's European Parliament election.

B. Lippincott Co., 1914) Phebe Westcott Humphreys (January 28, 1864 – June 17, 1939) was a journalist, horticulturist, photographer and children’s book author, known for documenting and influencing landscape design with publications including The Practical Book of Garden Architecture (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Co., 1914). Her work was favored by experts including the botanist Charles Howard Shinn, who lauded Humphreys' \\"amazing wealth of knowledge,\\" and the tastemaker Ruby Ross Wood.Wood, Ruby Ross (1914). The Honest House. New York: The Century Co. p. 205. Humphreys contributed about 400 feature articles and regular columns to periodicals including House and Garden and Harper's Bazar. Among her topics are farms and factories run by immigrants; architectural preservation work; environmental sustainability; philanthropies donating plants to the poor; and newly patented household appliances. Her pioneering guidebook for car travelers, The Automobile Tourist (Philadelphia: Ferris & Leach, 1905), was praised by the Philadelphia Inquirer for \\"most thorough information\\" provided by \\"an enthusiastic automobilist.\\" In 2020, the Cultural Landscape Foundation designated her a pioneer. Biography Humphreys was the youngest of three children of Enos Westcott (c. 1835-1865), a farmer, metalsmith and shopkeeper in Bridgeton, New Jersey, and Lydia Martha Mason (1837-1931). Enos was considered “a liberal-hearted clever fellow.” In 1869, Lydia remarried to Ephraim Bacon (1821-1909), a farmer. Humphreys attended the South Jersey Institute and the Philadelphia School of Design for Women. (Humphreys’ niece Mary Bacon became the Bridgeton hospital's first woman physician.) Around 1887, she married Samuel Walter Humphreys (1864-1932), who ran food companies including Puritan Preserving Co., Franklin Conserve Co., Humphreys Candy Corp. and Colonial Conserve Co. The couple lived at 424 East Woodlawn Street in Germantown and had one child, Walter Westcott Humphreys (1888-1952), who became known for his car driving skills by age 12. Around 1891, Humphreys started writing magazine columns, often describing how she shaped plantings at her suburban property. She also based articles on her son’s interests including photography and camping. She took photographs accompanying her stories (her husband contributed as well). Her children’s books about nature were inspired by memories of her childhood farm life and the lack of youth- tailored literature on the subject. In 1899, the Humphreys family started traveling widely by car--she called herself \\"the chauffeur naturalist.\\" On their trips overseas, she wrote about landscapes and architecture in Cherbourg, Nova Scotia and Bermuda. By 1920, she had largely stopped publishing her writings, although she continued to produce manuscripts and belonged to the National League of American Pen Women. She and her husband owned substantial real estate. In 1934, she donated a seaside property in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, to a boys' harmonica club run by the philanthropist Albert N. Hoxie Jr., the founder of the Philadelphia Harmonica Band. She died after being struck by a trolley on East Girard Avenue. She is buried alongside her husband in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Works Magazines that published Humphreys’ articles include American Homes and Gardens (1906-1912), American Kitchen (1899), American Motherhood (1900-1907), Arthur's Home Magazine (1892-1895), Birds and Nature (1900-1907), Booklovers (1904), Country Gentleman (1900-1919), Country Life in America (1912-1913), The Delineator (1899-1901), Demorest's Family Magazine (1899-1900), The Designer and the Woman's Magazine (1900-1904), Farm and Fireside (1899-1919), Farm and Home (1907-1908), Floral Life (1903-1908), Garden Magazine (1905), Good Housekeeping (1897-1905), Harper's Bazar (1899), House Beautiful (1906-1914), House and Garden (1903-1910), Household (1900), Housekeeper (1905), Ladies' Home Journal (1893-1908), Mayflower (1893-1900), Park's Floral Magazine (1893-1900), Pictorial Review (1904), Puritan (1899), Rambler Magazine (1905), St. Nicholas (1904), Strand Magazine (1903), Suburban Life (1907-1911), Success With Flowers (1891-1901), Table Talk (1899-1914), What to Eat (1899) and Woman's Home Companion (1899-1900). Newspapers ran syndicated versions of her magazine stories, and The Times in Philadelphia (1892-1894) published her gardening articles. Floral Life editors reported that the publication \\"has no more popular contributor\\" than Humphreys, and The Delineator's Charles Hanson Towne lauded \\"her sane view of things.\\" Creating harmonious landscapes, experimenting with newly imported houseplants and protecting indigenous species were recurring themes, for instance in her regular columns for Success With Flowers and Arthur's Home Magazine. Among her other frequent topics were nurturing children's curiosity; life on houseboats; and connecting the urban poor with nature. In a five-year monthly series for the culinary magazine Table Talk, titled “Famous Banqueting Houses,” she explored the history, architecture and preservation of landmark buildings mostly around Philadelphia, such as the Germantown White House, Grumblethorpe and Andalusia, and as far afield as Maine, Trenton and Salem. Her children’s books about nature, Our Animal Friends in Their Native Homes (Philadelphia, 1900) and Our Feathered Friends (Chicago: Thompson & Thomas, 1905), \\"describe accurately\\" the fauna and their habitats, Publishers' Weekly reported. Her other children's books include What Boys and Girls Like (Philadelphia, 1899 and 1903) and ABC's and Stories for Mamma's Little Sweetheart (Philadelphia, 1899).

The practice is controversial, because some customers believed they were taking out loans to buy a pet when, in fact, they were only leasing an animal that could be repossessed by the lender in the event that payments were not kept up. The process of leasing a pet typically starts in a retail pet store, but the loan is made by a third-party contractor. The revenue model for pet leasing is the same as car leasing.https://animalrightschannel.com/2018/08/01/pet-leasing-the-latest-in- predatory-lending/ The borrower enters a contract, typically for two years, and agrees to monthly payments.

She was born in Jamaica and moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 10. Burford attended Dalston County Grammar School and studied medicine at the University of London. Biography = Early years = Burford was born in Jamaica on 9 December 1944 and was raised there by her grandmother until the age of seven. In 1955 Burford moved to London with her family, where she attended Dalston County Grammar School, which later became Kingsland Secondary School. The school is now known as Petchey Academy and specialises in health, care and medical science. Burford described herself as a \\"descendent of three different diasporas: African, Jewish and Scots\\", as well as claiming her lesbian identity. = Medical career = Burford joined the National Health Service in 1964 as a specialist in electron microscopy at postgraduate teaching hospitals. She later began working at the Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital in a team with Sheila Haworth. Haworth is a professor of developmental cardiology at the Institute of Child Health and was in 2006 appointed Commander of The Most Excellent Order of the British Emipre for services to the National Health Service. = Writing = Burford was an active writer, having written plays, short stories, poems, and science fiction stories. The 1980 anthology A Dangerous Knowing: Four Black Women Poets, to which Burford was a contributor, was the first anthology to be published in the field of black British women's writing. The anthology was described in the academic journal Hecate as \\"a gift\\" and a \\"testimony to the depth of Black feeling and the complex power inherent in Black love.\\" Burford's 1984 play Patterns was commissioned by Changing Women's Theatre. The play focused on women's labour and was performed at the Oval Theatre in London. The Threshing Floor (1986), an eponymous novella and collection of short stories, features in many school and college reading lists across the United Kingdom, and individual works from the collection have been republished in other anthologies. Burford's writing was included in the anthology Daughters of Africa (ed. Margaret Busby, 1992). Burford's works were selected multiple times by the journal The Women's Review of Books as works that readers of the journal might find interesting. = Equality and diversity = In 1999 Burford was appointed Director of Equality for the Department of Health, a post she held until 2002.North of England Commissioning Support (June 2014). \\"Diversity E-Newsletter, No 4\\". Retrieved 2018-08-01.  University of Bradford  Burford assisted with the creation of Bradford's healthcare apprenticeship scheme, led by Bradford University, which is credited with helping transform the diversity of the city's healthcare workforce. Burford was awarded an honorary doctorate in 2001 from the University of Bradford to recognise her contributions to equality and diversity. After her retirement in 2005 Burford became the first deputy director of the university's Centre for Inclusion and Diversity. = Death and legacy = Burford died of respiratory failure on 20 February 2010. The University of Bradford set up an annual lecture in memory of Burford known as the Barbara Burford Annual Memorial Lecture, given as part of the international annual Making Diversity Interventions Count conference. The lecture is given each year by one of her colleagues from the field of equality and diversity who had direct links to Burford and her work. The Barbara Burford Honour (Excellence in STEM) was founded in 2017 by British magazine Gay Times as part of the Gay Times Honours, a series of honours to recognise LGBT individuals who have made a difference in their field.

The crust is part of the East European Craton and formed beginning in the Paleoproterozoic nearly two billion years ago. Shallow marine environments predominated in Estonia, producing extensive natural resources from organic matter such as oil shale and phosphorite. The Mesozoic and much of the Cenozoic are not well-preserved in the rock record, although the glaciations during the Pleistocene buried deep valleys in sediment, rechanneled streams and left a landscape of extensive lakes and peat bogs. Stratigraphy, tectonics and geologic history Cambrian blue clay outcrop at beach of Gulf of Finland in Voka Estonia is part of the East European Craton, with an average continental crust thickness between 40 and 64 kilometers. The crust consolidated during the Svecofennian Orogeny in the late Paleoproterozoic, nearly two billion years ago. The contact between the crystalline basement and overlying rock dips gently to the south. Late Proterozoic and early and middle Paleozoic sedimentary rocks on the north coast of Estonia are 100 to 200 meters thick, reaching up to 500 to 800 meters thick in the Gulf of Riga and the southeast. The Baltic Syncline and Moscow Syncline are deeply buried structures within the Russian Platform, with three to five kilometers of sediments. They are linked by the Latvian Saddle, which is shallower with two kilometers of sediment. Precambrian rocks do not outcrop anywhere in Estonia, but are present in the subsurface. =Paleozoic (541–251 million years ago)= Except for artificial outcrops in oil shale and phosphorite strip mines, the only outcrops of Paleozoic rocks are found in a few river valleys, coastal cliffs on the Baltic and the shores of lake Vortsjarv and Peipsi. During the Ordovician and Silurian, a shallow marine environment predominated in Estonia, depositing organic-rich black carbonate shale which later generated oil shale. Reef limestones and backreef dolomite contributed material to the carbonaceous shale. Silurian sedimentation took place during a retreat in sea levels, bringing a break in sediment deposition. In the Early Devonian, sedimentation continued. The Old Red sandstones deposited in the Middle Devonian in a nearshore marine environment from sand and silt, shed during the Caledonian orogeny onto the Fennoscandian continental plain. A few carbonate rocks capped the Devonian in the southeast. The sedimentary rocks preserve extensive fossils and tens of thousands of specimens have been gathered at the University of Tartu and Institute of Geology. Brachiopod, mollusk, trilobite, ostracod, bryozoan, graptolite and stromatoporoid fossils are especially common. Most natural resources in Estonia formed from fossil remains, including kukersite and phosphorite deposits formed from shells. Through the Devonian, the continent Baltica, which included Estonia, drifted from the South Pole to north of the Equator and was influenced by glacier-related changes in sea level. Deformation of rocks from weak, regional tectonic stresses leads to some anticline folds and fluid migration in the rocks, which generate metasomatic dolomite limestone, zinc mineralization and lead-sulfide deposits. The Kärdla astrobleme on Hiiumaa Island formed from an asteroid impact 455 million years ago, and Estonia has three other small meteorite craters, less than 110 meters in diameters in the bedrock. =Mesozoic-Cenozoic (251 million years ago to present)= The Mesozoic and much of the Cenozoic are poorly attested in Estonia. However, extensive sediments and landforms remain from the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary. A thin blanket of Quaternary sediments covers the plains of western Estonia. The Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland are relatively deep erosional features in the bedrock, as are the lake basins of Vortsjarv and Peipsi, which were deepened by glaciers during the Pleistocene. Before and in-between glaciations, a network of deep valleys formed, up to 145 meters below sea levels, connecting the Baltic and the Gulf of Finland. However, more recent sedimentation has disguised old valleys which do not appear as a major part of present-day topography. Glacial debris is less than five meters thick in northern Estonia and parts of the country underlain by limestone and dolomite have karst processes and hardly any remnants of glaciation. The Haanja Heights and Otepaa Heights have up to 100 meters of glacial sediment, or up to 207 meters in the Abja Valley in the south. Quaternary geologists define five major till layers, separated by interglacial pollen assemblages. Moraines are often up to tens of kilometers long and more than 50 meters in height, such as the Laane-Saaremaa terminal moraine. Kame fields and eskers are also common, particularly on the Pandivere Upland and the West Estonian Lowland. Glacial retreat began around 13,000 years ago and ended by around 11,000 years ago. However, ice-dammed lakes and isostatic rebound in the region played an important role in geomorphology for several more millennia. The Baltic Ice Lake gave way to the Yoldia Sea, Ancylus Lake and Littorina Sea, followed by the Limnea Sea. The land of Estonia rose 65 meters in a span of only 2450 years and has risen an additional 50 meters in the past 10,000 years. Deglaciation led to the formation of river valleys and 20 to 40 percent of downcutting in rivers in the south happened during a short span after glaciation. Estonia has 1500 lakes and 20,000 peat bogs, although the number of lakes was three times as many at the start of the Holocene. Natural resource geology VKG Ojamaa mine for oil shale extraction, using an Atlas Copco Scooptram ST7 underground loader Oil shale in Estonia remains a major part of the economy and throughout the 1950s, '60s, '70s, '80s and early '90s, geologists extensively prospected oil shale resources, with peak production in 1980. Phosphorite mining was also an important activity in Estonia through the 1980s, prompting the so-called Phosphorite War in 1987 when the Estonian public opposed the expansion of mining efforts, and the implicit threat of additional Russian miners being sent to the region. The major phosphorite mine at Maardu closed in 1991 due to its environmental impact. Peat extraction in Hiiumaa, September, 2013 Estonia has 165,000 mires (including 20,000 peat bogs), each with an area of one hectare or greater. About 1500 are commercially important and most have thicknesses of three to seven meters, with a maximum of 16.7 meters in the Haanja Heights. Lake chalk is sometimes used to neutralize high acidity and for art material. Estonia also has iron ore in the crystalline basement, pyrite and glauconite and, as well as lead and zinc sulfide ore. Granite rock near Tallinn is often extracted for road work. Estonia also has extensive clays dating to the Cambrian, Devonian and Quaternary, which are widely used in ceramics and cement. Limestone is also used as a raw material for the chemical, pulp, paper, building stone and glass industries, while dolomite is sometimes used for facing stones. Gyttja lake mud occurs in 121 lakes, with up to three billion cubic meters of reserves and a large deposit of 45 million tons at Varska. Lake mud can be used for medical purposes, or in fertilizers. History of geologic research Estonian geologists have developed The Book of Primeval Nature, chronicling landforms in the country. The Kaali meteorite crater on Saaremaa Island was the first geologic site slated for protection after its recognition in 1937. The Institute of Geology of the Academy of Sciences was organized in 1947, followed by the founding of the Geological Survey of Estonia and the Institute of Geology in 1957. Since the 1950s, Estonian organizations drilled tens of thousands of boreholes through the sedimentary cover, in some cases reaching more than 500 meters deep into the crystalline basement rock. The Geological Survey of Estonia completed mapping of Paleozoic bedrock and Quaternary sediments by 1975. Additional maps of hydrogeology, geomorphology, engineering geology and even geoecology have been completed since then. Up until 1990, all geologic publications were written in Russian.

The river system is one of the largest non-glacial perennial rivers in the state, second only to Ramganga (West) and flows entirely in the district of Pauri Garhwal. The two main branches of the river, Nayar East and Nayar West along with Ramganga river, rise in the dense forests and high meadows of Dudhatoli and merge to form Nayar roughly one kilometre ahead of Satpuli. Satpuli is a town on the left bank of Nayar East river. Etymology As per historical records and ancient Hindu religious texts the river was called Narad Ganga. The present name of the river \\"Nayar\\" is presumably derived from its ancient name \\"Narad Ganga\\". In its native range, both the branches of Nayar, i.e., Nayar East and West are referred to as Nayar only. Eastern Nayaar near Syunsi-Bangaar, Pauri Garhwal.jpgEastern Nayar near Syunsi Bangar, Pauri Garhwal Western Nayar in its nascent stage.jpgWestern Nayar in its nascent stage, close to its source near the base of Dudhatoli hills Alpine mountain stream, Nayaar valley.jpgAn alpine mountain stream that merges with Eastern Nayar, near Sundargaon, Thalisain Watercourse Both the rivers have a combined length of approximately 200 kilometers and are hardly two-feet wide near their respective sources. Although both the rivers are nearly equal in length, the Eastern branch has a higher volume of water as the first half of its course lies in dense forested regions. Nayar East rises in the meadows of Dudhatoli in a high altitude valley sheltered by towering mountains of over 10,000 feet. Several shepherd’s huts are built along its course from its source to the first major human settlement, Maroda village. Some of the great sages are believed to have did penance near its origin. Rishi Chyavana is said to have invented Chyavanprash from medicinal herbs found in Dudhatoli mountains. The river forms an intricate network of riparian systems supporting wild animals and plants in its valley. These shadowed valleys remain snow-bound for weeks. Nayar West rises at a relatively lower altitude and has a lesser catchment area which explains its lesser volume. Since these rivers are non-glacial, they totally depend on precipitation. In days of less precipitation such as winter, the volume of these rivers goes down by up to 50 percent. The water-level gets visibly low during winter season and one can see the river-bed through the transparent water which becomes as clear as air. In popular culture Although very few people know of the river out of its range, yet the locals dote on it. Nayar, like a typical non-glacial perennial river of lower Himalayas, is the lifeline to inhabitants of its valley. Lives of many villagers living in its valley revolve around the river throughout the river. It provides not only fresh fish but also clean water for irrigation purposes. At the widest point of Nayar East, i.e the stretch from Syunsi to Gudinda, it has formed a broad and fertile valley. Such stretches have a higher density as upper reaches of the rivercourse has steep cliffs and unyielding soil. The higher it gets, the least populated it becomes. A tributary of Eastern Nayaar near Sindudi village, Pauri Garhwal.jpgA tributary of Eastern Nayar near Sindudi, Pauri Garhwal A tributary of Western Nayaar near Paithani.jpgA tributary of Western Nayar near Paithani Nayaar East river before merging with its western branch.jpgNayar East river before merging with its western branch Folklore As the Nayar and its tributaries merge with the holy Ganga, it is revered by locals. Many villages use some selected stretches of the river-bed as public cremation grounds. Remote high-altitude villages use alpine streams (tributaries of the Nayar) for cremation and religious purposes. Though not used frequently, population being less dense. Such sites are marked by giant old Peepal trees and people generally don't roam around there. One may not be surprised to find shards of animal or even human bones or copper/bronze ceremonial vessels in the river. Cremation grounds may explain the water- phobia or rather valley-phobia of people in these parts. It is believed that crying or weeping near water bodies such as mountain streams, pools & rivers and the echoing of the sound will attract spirits. Many claim that they have been troubled by such spirits for months on end until they conducted a grand Puja and worshiped them for a riddance. Just like how some people are shown to be possessed by evil Djinns in Islamic world. Many elders in these valleys are considered to be \\"experts\\" in these matters, a very mild and subtle version of the African Witch-doctors. At times a cockerel is demanded to be used as a scapegoat, the evil spirit is \\"captured\\" in it and then it is released free. Historically, these valleys used to be heavily populated in post-independence years, drownings in the river were not uncommon. Those incidents have somehow affected the psychology of local folks, and it might be said that these old- wives tales were formed to keep mischievous kids away from the river. Hydroelectricity The below mentioned hydroelectricity projects have been developed in the valleys of Nayar East and Nayar West. Their installed capacities (which are understandably low, given the discharge of these rivers) have also been given. Also, the demand for electricity is quite low in these sparsely populated valleys and hence the amount generated is just enough to meet the local demand.http://ahec.org.in/wfw/pdf/Hydropower_stations_in_operation_and_under_construction_in_uttarakhand.pdfhttps://sandrp.in/2013/07/10/uttarakhand- existing-under-construction-and-proposed-hydropower-projects-how-do-they-add- to-the-disaster-potential-in-uttarakhand/ *Gauni Chhira (Waterfall) on Nayar East with an installed capacity of 0.5 Megawatt. *Santudhar I on Nayar West with an installed capacity of 2 Megawatts. *Santudhar II on Nayar West with an installed capacity of 2 Megawatts. *Byaligaon on Nayar East with an installed capacity of 2.25 Megawatts. *Nayar Project on Nayar with an installed capacity of 17 Megawatts.

It might be written with the conscious aim of expressing feminist principles, although sometimes it is identified as feminist by critics in a later era. Some writers are thought to express feminist ideas even if the writer was not an active member of the political movement during their era. Many feminist movements, however, have embraced poetry as a vehicle for communicating with public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings. Formally, feminist poetry often seeks to challenge assumptions about language and meaning. It usually foregrounds women's experiences as valid and worthy of attention, and it also highlights the lived experiences of minorities and other less privileged subjects. Sometimes feminist poems seek to embody specific women's experiences, and they are often intersectional registering specific forms of oppression depending on identities related to race, sexuality, gender presentation, disability, or immigration status. This has led to feminist writing journals like So To Speak providing a statement of intention to publish the work of women and nonbinary people in particular. Kim Whitehead states that feminist poetry has \\"no identifiable birth date,\\" but there are a few key figures identified as early proponents of feminist ideas, and who convey their politics through poetry. The title of first feminist poet is often given to Sappho, at least in part because she seems to write about female homosexuality in Ancient Greece, a culture and time when lesbian sexuality was usually ignored or erased. Feminist Poetry in Asia Toru Dutt = Feminist Aspects of Sanskrit Writing = The beginning of works categorised as literature in India began with the Sanskrit term kāvya, a discourse separate from science or from the purely oral, and specific literary style that included works thought to contain a kind of soulfulness. In this early period, men were often posed as poets, and women as a kind of muse, as in the tenth century explanation for the origins of Indian literary culture: Poem Man's wife (\\"Poetics\\") chases him across South Asia creating varying kinds of literature across the region. Poetry was certainly an important part of political cultural life in the Sanskrit cosmopolis, and some women contributed; for example the poet Rajasekhara tells of women in different regions who entertain with songs. The early civilisation of Khmer country in modern-day Cambodia cultivated a literature in Sanskrit, and diverged from its neighbours in creating a strain of poetry from the fifth century to the thirteenth century in which women were a source of praise and admiration. Take for example the Mebon Inscription of Rājendravarman, which features eulogies for specific women of note, and which is, according to Sheldon I. Pollock, \\"without obvious parallel in South Asia,\\" and may be related to \\"specific kinship structures in the region.\\" = Nineteenth Century Feminist Poets in India = Early anglophone women poets in India blended native traditions and literary models from Europe. Amongst these early feminists, the Dutt Sisters - Toru Dutt (1856-1877) and Aru Dutt (1854-1874) stand out, and are sometimes compared to the Brontë Sisters in England. The Dutt sisters came from a family of poets, including their father Govind Chandra Dutt, and their access to education was unprecedented. The mother of the family Kshetramoni Mitter Dutt along with all three children - Toru, Aru, and their brother Abju Dutt, had received an education in English, and to some extent, in the Bengali language. The family had a reformist bent, and some members had converted to Christianity. Both sisters visited England in the 1870s, and attended the higher lectures for women at Cambridge University. Toru Dutt's poetry in particular has been labelled extraordinary, because her writing \\"created a new idiom in Indian English verse.\\" Spanning the turn from the nineteenth to twentieth century, Sarojini Naidu (1879–1949) represents a figure for whom politics and poetry are intertwined. Like the Dutt Sisters, Naidu was allowed access to all the educational resources she desired, and she passed the Madras University matriculation examination at age 12. She came from a large and free-thinking family. Her father, Aghorenath Chattopadhyay, was a well-regarded doctor, known for his educational reforms, and her mother, Barada Sundari Devi, was educated at a Brahmo school. Naidu had seven siblings all of whom made contribution to Indian life, for example her brother Virendranath Chattopadhyay was an Indian revolutionary. Naidu studied at Girton College, Cambridge, which brought her into contact with writers of the day, including Arthur Symons, and W.B. Yeats. Ultimately, Naidu's unconventional upbringing and education were catalysts for her intellectual powers, since as she writes in her roman à clef 'Sulani,' \\"\\"Unlike the girls of her own nation, she had been brought up in an atmosphere of large un- convention and culture and absolute freedom of thought and action.\\" After her marriage to Govindarajulu Naidu - controversial because of his age and class - Naidu began publishing poetry to international acclaim, and in parallel with this literary art, she maintained her nationalist efforts, eventually becoming the first Indian woman to serve as president of the Indian National Congress. = Post 1960s Feminist Poetry = Anthologies were an important part of foregrounding women's writing in volumes like Eunice De Souza's Nine Indian Women Poets (1997).  Feminist Poetry in Central America and the Caribbean  Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz The Feminist Legacy of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz During the Latin American colonial period, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (est 1651-1695) was a poet, dramatist, and nun. Exceptionally talented and intelligent, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz chose to spend most of her life in the Convent of the Order of St. Jérôme, and her response to a critical Bishop, Respuesta a Sor Filotea, is hailed as one of the first feminist manifestos. Not only did Sor Juana have to deal with the criticisms of men of her era, but she also faced the Spanish perception of literature from the colonies as second-rate. Sor Juana's poems challenge the assumptions of men about women, for example in 'You Foolish Men.' > What kind of mind is odder than his who mists a mirror and then complains > that it's not clear. The fact that she chooses to avoid a heteronormative life with marriage and children is often held up as a feminist choice, and she represents the possibility to be a woman who 'pursues knowledge and procreates only through art and not through a genetic legacy.' = Post 1960s Feminist Poetry in Central America and the Caribbean = Anthologies of women's writing in the 1980s foregrounded the importance of women poets in the Caribbean, for example in M.J. Fenwick's Sisters of Caliban (1996) described as \\"a gendered and racialized position of resistance\\".  Feminist Poetry in North America  Poet Joy Harjo's argument for the centrality and importance of native poetry in North America is significant for feminist literary histories. = Early Feminist Poets in North America = Though they lived in an era before an organised feminist movement, certain American poets have been lauded by feminist literary criticism as early examples of feminist writers. Feminist poetry in the United States is often thought of as beginning with Anne Bradstreet (1612-1672), the first poet of the New World. There were also, however, native poetic traditions before colonialism, which continue to the present day, and represent an important strand of American poetry. Native traditional verse has included \\"lyrics, chants, anecdotes, incantations, riddles, proverbs, and legends.\\" While it is difficult to ascertain from these oral traditions whether the authors of early texts were male or female, precolonial native poetry certainly addresses issues relevant to women in a sensitive and positive way, for example the Seminole poem, 'Song for Bringing a Child Into the World.' In fact, native poetry is a separate but relevant tradition in the United States; as poet Joy Harjo comments, \\"The literature of the aboriginal people of North America defines America. It is not exotic.\\" In the context of Canada, Anne Marie Dalton argues that at least some indigenous communities in North America (though not all) have lived by practicing ecofeminism with regard to women's roles, and the sustainability of the land. When colonialism did arrive, Anne Bradstreet was one of the first poets to win acclaim, and many of her poems are thought to have feminist themes. The mother of eight children, Bradstreet sometimes found herself in conflict with her domestic circumstances and her role as a Puritan woman. Feminist literary criticism defined Bradstreet in retrospect as a \\"protofeminist,\\" because of her \\"gender awareness,\\" and her treatment of domestic concerns of importance in women's lives. Poet Alicia Ostriker describes Bradstreet's style as \\"a combination of rebellion and submission,\\" a pattern that Ostriker also sees in poets to come like Phyllis Wheatley and Emily Dickinson. Phyllis Wheatley (1753-1784) was brought to the United States from Africa as a slave, and sold to the Wheatley family of Boston in 1771. A prodigy as a child, Wheatley was the first black person to publish a book of poems in the American colony, and though her poems are sometimes thought of as expressing \\"meek submission,\\" she is also what Camille Dungy describes as \\"a foremother,\\" and a role model for black women poets as \\"part of the fabric\\" of American poetry. Involved in the abolitionist movement, Wheatley became \\"a spokeswoman for the cause of American independence and the abolition of slavery.\\" Nineteenth century poet Emily Dickinson (1830-1886) is often thought of as feminist, though she never wrote for public audiences. Not necessarily recognized in her own lifetime, Dickinson offers powerful female speakers. Engaging with male writers like Ralph Waldo Emerson or William Wordsworth, her work is praised for developing \\"others ways of representing the position of a female speaking subject\\" in particular romantic and psychological dynamics. See for example the declaration of desire and longing in 'Wild nights - Wild nights!.' In the 1970s, feminist literary criticism articulated Dickinson's feminism through groundbreaking studies by Margaret Homans, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, and Suzanne Juhasz. Critics point in particular to Dickinson's expression of anger at women's confinement, to her re-gendering of external and internal realities, to her use of feminist motifs, and to her articulation of her particular position in Puritan, patriarchal culture. Dickinson also proves that confinement to domestic life does not dictate an inability to create great poetry. As the poet Adrienne Rich writes, \\"Probably no poet ever lived so much and so purposefully in one house; even, in one room.\\" =Post 1900s North American Feminist Poets= Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson Feminist poets of the early twentieth century harnessed the new opportunities and rights which came as a result of coeducational resources now afforded to women. Cristianne Miller goes so far as to say that 'In no period before and rarely since have women poets had greater success and influence than in the first half of the twentieth century in the United States.' Living through the turn of the century was Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson(1875-1935), a poet often thought of in relation to her marriage to Paul Dunbar. Dunbar-Nelson, however, is an accomplished writer in her own right, praised by poet Camille Dungy for breaking out of writing only about \\"black women's things,\\" instead addressing \\"the theater and war of life.\\" Born in New Orleans, Dubar-Nelson's family had a heritage of African American, Anglo, Native American, and Creole roots. Camille Dungy suggests that bringing black women writers like Dunbar-Nelson into the feminist canon alongside Bradstreet and Dickinson is of great importance in rediscovering literary foremothers for black women writers. The early twentieth century was also a significant moment for feminism, because it saw the rise of the suffragist movement, and poets responded to the political moment by writing poems regarding the debate as to whether or not women should have the right to vote. In her collection Suffrage Songs and Verses, Charlotte Perkins Gilman criticises wealthy women, who because they live a life of ease, deny other women their rights. Alice Duer Miller (1874-1942) wrote poems mocking anti-suffragist advocates, which were published in the New York Tribune, a popular news outlet of the era. While some poets have been embraced by the feminist canon, others are seen as awkward additions in spite of their success, for example Gertrude Stein (1874-1946) is often defined more as a poet involved in modernist experimentation than feminist discourse. Some of modernism's tenets seem incompatible with some kinds of feminism, like the repression of emotion, and avoidance of domesticity. Nevertheless, second wave feminists found modernist women poets like H.D. (1886-1961) to be a powerful example, unfairly overlooked by male critics. By the time of the 1940s, magazines were being set up which, though perhaps not obviously feminist, certainly in their practices were very different to male-run publications: take for example Contemporary Verse (1941–52) published in Canada by a group of women writers, including Dorothy Livesay, P.K. Page, and Anne Marriott. =Post 1960 North American Feminist Poets= Audre Lorde Historian Ruth Rosen describes the mainstream poetry world before 1960 as \\"an all boy's club,\\" adding that poetry was not \\"women's place,\\" and explains that in order to get a poetry book published, writers would have to overcome their gender and race. The interest of American feminist poets in the rights of minorities have often put them in conflict with American institutions like the American Academy of Poets. One of the strategies of feminist poets is to demonstrate \\"their opposition to a dominant poetry culture that does not recognize the primacy of gender and other oppressions\\". 1960s feminist poetry provided a useful space for second wave American feminist politics. The poets, however, were not necessarily unified in their themes or formal techniques, but had links to specific movements and trends, such as the New York Poets, the Black Mountain poets, the San Francisco Renaissance, or the Beat Poets. Denise Levertov (1923-1997), for example, refined and built upon poetics from the Black Mountain School. Women like Sylvia Plath (1932-1963) and Anne Sexton (1928-1974) provided a feminist version of the Confessional Poets' poetics, which worked alongside feminist texts of the day, like Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique, to \\"address taboo subjects and social limitations that plagued American women\\" (although Plath died before The Feminine Mystique was published) Lucille Clifton (1936-2010) also borrowed from Confessional poetics, a strategy that was key according to Adrienne Rich for avoiding being trapped between \\"misogynist black male critics and white feminists still struggling to unearth a white woman's tradition.\\" Confessionalism lent to feminist poetry the possibility of agency for the female speaker, and the refusal to present well-behaved women, though it was troubling that the Confessional women poets who committed suicide tended to be foregrounded and promoted in poetry circles. Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980) was a generation older than Plath and Sexton, and rejected the suicidal poetics of the Confessional writers. Rukeyser also wrote frankly about the body and sexuality, inspiring later poets like Sharon Olds. In addition, Rukeyser's leftist politics and militant writing style proved to be a model for poet Adrienne Rich. Both poets also contributed to the anti-Vietnam War movement: for example Rukeyser and Rich took part in readings as part of the event series, the Week of the Angry Arts Against the War in Vietnam. Adrienne Rich (1929-2012) also became a key feminist poet, praised by Alicia Ostriker for bringing \\"intellect\\" to poetry, \\"something that women were not supposed to have,\\" as well as \\"a leftward leaning sensibility in which coming out as lesbian was just one part.\\" Rich's 'Diving into the Wreck' is an important feminist poem, as it describes moving down as an act of triumph, where the wreck might be history, literature, or human life, and the poem itself is a kind of \\"battlecry.\\" Famously, when Rich received the National Book Award for her collection, Diving into the Wreck, she accepted it on behalf of all the female nominees, including Audre Lorde and Alice Walker: > We, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, and Alice Walker, together accept this award > in the name of all the women whose voices have gone and still go unheard in > a patriarchal world, and in the name of those who, like us, have been > tolerated as token women in this culture, often at great cost and in great > pain. We believe that we can enrich ourselves more in supporting and giving > to each other than by competing against each other; and that poetry— if it > is poetry— exists in a realm beyond ranking and comparison. We symbolically > join together here in refusing the terms of patriarchal competition and > declaring that we will share this prize among us, to be used as best we can > for women. Audre Lorde (1934-1992) was a feminist poet whose poetry and prose writings have had a great impact on feminist thinking to the present day. Sometimes thought of as a writer who developed a \\"black lesbian eroticism,\\" Lorde's poetry also shows a deep ethical and moral commitment, which seeks to challenge racism, sexism, and homophobia. Many of Lorde's poems have a great deal in common with the modern-day campaign #blacklivesmatter, as they pose questions about institutionalised racism in American public services like the price force, for example in her poem 'Power': > A policeman who shot down a ten year old in Queens stood over the boy with > his cop shoes in childish blood and a voice said \\"Die you little > motherfucker\\" and there are tapes to prove it. At his trial this policeman > said in his own defense \\"I didn't notice the size nor nothing else only the > color\\". And there are tapes to prove that, too. Lorde's work has also proved to be an inspiration to feminists working on the subject of feminist killjoys, and the trope of the angry black woman, often used as an excuse to belittle or reduce the impact of just concerns about racism. Lorde's poems often draw attention to the universalising tendencies of some white feminisms, so in a poem about a mythical woman, 'A Woman Speaks,' only at the end does Lorde draw attention to the problematic universal, white woman, adding > I am woman and not white. Lorde went on to be an effective and challenging teacher of other women poets, such as Donna Masini. = Feminist Anthologies in North America in the 1970s and 80s = In the 1970s and 80s, feminist poetry evolved alongside the feminist movement, becoming a useful tool for activist groups organised around radical feminism, socialist feminism, and lesbian feminism. Poetry readings became spaces for feminists to come together in cities and in rural communities, and talk about sexuality, women's roles, and the possibilities beyond heteronormative life. Figures like Judy Grahn were figureheads for the women's movement, providing electrifying readings that enlivened and inspired audiences. Often the poems were political, and sometimes the writers tried to use language that \\"ordinary women\\" could read and understand. Countering tokenism was also an important aspect of the feminist poetry project. Carolyn Forché describes the \\"blue velvet chair\\" effect, inspired by group portraits of canonical poets, in which one - but only one - woman writer was allowed to join the men, often sat in a Victorian blue velvet chair. As poetry took on a new significance for the feminist movement, so a number of new poetry anthologies were published which emphasised women's voices and experiences. Anthologies played an important role generally in opening up the political consciousness of poetry, an important example being Raymond Souster's volume, New Wave Canada: The Explosion in Canadian Poetry (1966).Louis Dudek and Michael Gnarowski describe the anthology's embracing of counterculture, including new ideas about sexuality and the role of women. Other anthologies began to focus specifically on women's writing, such as: *Sisterhood is Powerful (1970) edited by Robin Morgan; *No More Masks! (1971) edited by Florence Howe and Ellen Bass; *The World Split Open (1972) edited by Louise Bernikow; *Psyche (1973) edited by Barbara Segnitz and Carol Rainey; *New Poets, Women (1976) edited by Terry Wetherby; *Contemporary Women Poets (1977) edited by Jennifer McDowell and Milton Leventhal; *Open to Sun (1979) edited by Nora Jacquez Wieser; *Lesbian Poetry (1982) edited by Elly Bulkin and Joan Larkin; *Daughters of the Sun, Women of the Moon: Poetry by Black Canadian Women (1990) edited by Ann Wallace. *These Girls Are Not Sweet: Poetry by Latin American Women (1991) edited by Marjorie Agosín. Other anthologies created new canons of women's writing from the past, such as Black sister: poetry by black American women, 1746-1980 (1981) edited by Erlene Stetson; or Writing Red: An Anthology of American Women Writers, 1930-1940 (1987) edited by Paula Rabinowitz and Charlotte Nekola. Such anthologies \\"established solid ground for the communication and circulation of feminist ideas\\" in the American and Canadian Academies. Conferences also provided important spaces for feminists to share and discuss ideas about the possibilities of poetry: for example a key moment for Canadian feminist poetry was the \\"Women and words / Les femmes et les motes\\" conference in 1983. The Vancouver convention brought together women writers, publishers, and booksellers to discuss the issues of the Canadian literary world, including gender inequity. = Modern Feminist Poetry in North America = One change in the writing of women poets after the 1960s and 1970s was the possibility of writing about women's lives and experiences. To give authority to women's voices, writers like Honor Moore and Judy Graun held workshops specifically for women in order to overcome women's inner critics exacerbated by sexism. These networks of mentorship sprang up in feminist communities, and in universities. The work at this time was focussing on \\"images of women,\\" and this often meant broadening representations. This methodology eventually began to be criticised, however, because it failed to recognise the complications of violence embedded in the very structure of language. Writers influenced by the avant-garde and by L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry sought to challenge the idea of language's neutrality. US feminist language poets like Lynn Hejinian or Susan Howe, or Canadian writers like Daphne Marlatt looked back to the legacy of experimentalist modernists like Gertrude Stein, or Mina Loy, and also to diverse sources of inspiration like Denise Levertov, Marguerite Duras, Virginia Woolf, Nicole Brossard, Phyllis Webb, Louky Bersianik, and Julia Kristeva. They also reframed the language poetics from male mentors like Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, Gary Snyder, or Allen Ginsberg. Poets also sought to intervene in spheres traditionally dominated by men. Take for example Eileen Myles' intervention into politics in her 1992 \\"Write-in Campaign for President.\\" By the time of the 1990s, and the rise of intersectionality as a key feminist term, many feminist poets resisted the term \\"woman poet,\\" because it suggested \\"too confining a collective identity.\\" They also sought to undermine \\"the assumption that has sometimes structured feminist political organizing and even feminist literary publishing and criticism—that gender can be separated from race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality, and that white middleclass women first and foremost have the tools and the knowhow for the enterprise of analyzing gendered experience and literary production.\\" Present day feminist poetry in North America holds space for a great variety of poets tackling identity, sexuality, and gender issues. Key writings in the recent past include Claudia Rankine's careful skewering of race related microaggressions in Citizen, Dorothea Laskey's \\"ferocious confession\\" in Rome for example, and Bhanu Kapil's challenge the violent inherent in structures of language and institutions.  Feminist Poetry in Western Europe  Elizabeth Barrett Browning = Feminist Writing after Mary Wollstonecraft = Eighteenth century advocate for women's rights Mary Wollstonecraft (1797-1851), put great emphasis on the power of the poetic imagination as a liberator tool, and many nineteenth century British women writers were inspired by Wollstonecraft to use poetry to enter public debates about gender roles, poverty, and slavery. The verse-novel Aurora Leigh (1856) by Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861) is one such feminist work, which challenged a prevailing attitude that women's lives were incompatible with writing poetry. Aurora Leigh had a very public impact, for example influencing the views of American social reformer Susan B. Anthony regarding the traditional roles of women, especially in relation to the tension between marriage and women's individuality. = Late Nineteenth Century Feminist Poets in Britain = Often cited as an early feminist poet, Amy Levy (1861-1889) is described by writer Elaine Feinstein as the first modern Jewish woman poet. At the age of 13, Levy published her first poem in the feminist journal, the Pelican, and she grew to maturity surrounded by writers and social reformers on the London scene of the era, such as Eleanor Marx and Olive Schreiber. Though nothing is known for sure about Levy's sexual relationships, she is often thought of as a lesbian poet, though some critics have challenged affixing a sexual category to Levy. Levy's poems, however, are an early example of poetry that challenges heteronormative roles. = Twentieth Century Feminist Poets in Britain = Levy is often thought of as prefiguring or representing an early version of the New Woman, a stereotypical image of an independent woman who often worked rather than relying on her menfolk, and was associated with gender bending and deviance. Historically, the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century was an era of surplus women, who had to work to survive: by 1911, 77 per cent of women workers in the UK were single. Alongside the struggle of suffragettes campaigning for votes for women, many British feminist poets sought to emulate the example of Victorian women writers, often expressing their radical political beliefs through poetry. Often the writers were not professional poets, but wrote out of necessity, including satirical portraits of politicians, or writings from prison, as in Holloway Jingles, a collection of writing from imprisoned women collated by the Glasgow Branch of the Women's Social and Political Union. = British Feminist Poets and Modernism = In the inter-war years, British women poets associated with modernism began to find themselves public figures, though their feminist ideas sometimes came into conflict with the literary establishment which remained a kind of \\"exclusive male club.\\" Often these writers are difficult to categorize in relation to literary groups traditionally used, like the avant-garde or modernists. This was also a period when American women poets living in Britain made an important contribution to the writing of the day: writers like H.D., Mina Loy, and Amy Lowell all combined radical poetic content with experimentation of form, allowing them to explore feminist polemic and non- heteronormative sexualities in innovative new modes. Other British feminist poets of the time like Anna Wickham, Charlotte Mew, and Sylvia Townsend Warner, receive less critical attention, but also sought to challenge and reevaluate tropes of femininity. = Post 1960s Feminist Poetry in Britain = During the 1960s, the Women's Liberation Movement in the UK had a great influence on the literary world. Feminist publishers, Virago (founded in 1973), Onlywomen (1974), The Women's Press (1978), and Sheba (1980), were established, alongside magazines like Spare Rib. Like their counterparts in the US, British feminist editors in the 1970s and 80s created landmark anthologies of women's poetry, which foregrounded the variety and strength of women's writing. These included Lilian Mohin's One Foot on the Mountain (1979), Jeni Couzyn's The Bloodaxe Book of Contemporary Women Poets (1985), Moira Ferguson's First Feminists: British Women Writers 1578-1799 (1985), Kate Armstrong's Fresh Oceans (1989), Jude Brigley's Exchanges (1990), and Catherine Kerrigan's An Anthology of Scottish Women Poets (1991).

It guaranteed sovereign prerogatives to the Roman Pontiff, who had been deprived of the territory of the papal states. The popes refused to accept the law, as it was enacted by a foreign government and could therefore be revoked at will, leaving the popes without a full claim to sovereign status. In response, the popes declared themselves prisoners of the Vatican. The ensuing Roman Question was not resolved until the Lateran Pacts of 1929. Origins of the law For a time, the most serious question that confronted Italy after 1870 was the hostility between Church and State.Schapiro, European History, pg. 446. The Italian government, which had declared that it entered Rome to safeguard the person of the Holy FatherVisconti-Venosta, circular of 7 September, 1870; the autograph letter of Victor Emanuel to Pius IX, dated 29 Aug., received 10 Sept.; again the king's answer to the Roman deputation which brought him the result of the plebiscite, and which, in the very act of invading pontifical territory, had assured the people that the independence of the Holy See would remain inviolateGeneral Cadorna's proclamation at Terni, 11 Sept., felt obliged to secure in a legal and solemn way the executions of its aforesaid intention. It owed no less to its own Catholic subjects, and to Catholics the world over. Two ways were open to it for keeping its promise. It might call an international congress of all nations having a very large Catholic population, or it might pass a domestic Italian law. In the aforesaid circular of the minister Visconti-Venosta, addressed to all the powers, the former way was hinted at. But the unconcern of Catholic governments over the events that ended in the occupation of Rome put an end to all thought of consulting them; and so a domestic law was passed. Before its adoption, however, Pope Pius IX, by a letter of his cardinal vicar, dated 2 March, 1871, protested against the law \\"in which\\", he said, \\"it was no easy task to decide whether absurdity, cunning, or contempt played the largest part\\". Provisions Victor Emmanuel II, the first King of the united Italy Parliament passed in 1871 the famous Law of Papal Guarantees, which proposed to solve the question on Cavour's principle of a free church in a free state.Schapiro, European History, pp. 446–447. The pope was declared an independent sovereign and, as such, was entitled to receive and to send ambassadors and to conduct diplomatic affairs without any interference from the Italian government. His territory, however, was limited to the district in Rome known as the \\"Leonine City\\", over which floated the Papal flag, and into which no Italian officer could enter without permission from the Papal authorities. The palaces, churches, museums, offices, villas, and gardens in the Leonince City were to be exempt from taxation, and the Papal government was to have free use of the Italian railway, postal, and telegraph systems. The church was guaranteed full freedom of self-government, and the old interference by the state in church affairs was declared terminated.Schapiro, Modern History, pg. 447. The principal stipulations of the law may be summed up as follows: * the pope's person to be sacred and inviolable;Cismas, Religious Actors and International Law, pg. 162, footnote #45. * insult or injury to the pope to be treated on a par with insult or injury to the king's person; discussion of religious matters to be absolutely free; * royal honours to be paid to the pope; that he have the right to the customary guards; * as an indemnity for the loss of his domains, as an annual sum in perpetuity, the pope was voted 3,225,000 lireIn 1913, roughly US$622,425 or UK£127,933 (cf. Catholic Encyclopedia). In 1921, roughly US$645,000 (cf. Schapiro, Modern History, pg. 447). to cover all the needs of the Holy See (College of Cardinals, Roman congregations, embassies, etc.) and the maintenance of church buildings; * the Lateran and Vatican palaces, as well as the Villa of Castel Gandolfo, to remain the property of the pope; these articles assure the pope and all engaged in the spiritual government of the Church, as well as the college of cardinals assembled in conclave, complete liberty of communication with the Catholic world, exempt them from all interference with their letters, papers, etc.; * the clergy to have freedom of assembly; * the government to renounce the \\"Apostolic Legation\\" in Sicily, and the right of nomination to major benefices, with reservation, however, of the royal patronage; the bishops are not obliged to take the oath (of allegiance) on appointment; * the Exequatur to be maintained only for the major benefices (except in Rome, and in the suburbicarian sees) and for acts affecting the disposition of ecclesiastical property; * in spiritual matters no appeal to be allowed against ecclesiastical authority; the civil courts, however, to be competent to pass judgment on the juridical effects of ecclesiastical sentences. Provision to be made, by a future law, for the reorganization, conservation, and administration of all the church property in the kingdom. * the right to active and passive legation, and immunity of envoys accredited to the Holy See within Italian territory. Papal response Pope Pius IX The popes refused to recognized the fait accompli which was supported by the Law of Guarantees,Metz, What is Canon Law?, pg. 130. and refused in principle to recognize in the Italian government any right to grant them prerogatives, or to make laws for them, a position that lasted until the resolution of the Roman Question in 1929.Eric O. Hanson, The Catholic Church in World Politics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1987) 43. Pius IX indignantly refused to accept the terms of the \\"sub-Alpine\\" Government, as he termed the House of Savoy, whom he regarded as the despoiler of \\"God's vicar.\\" Parliament regularly voted the annuity from 1871 onward, but the popes never accepted it, because to accept it would be to recognize the Kingdom of Italy as a legitimate government which no pope from 1871 to 1929 was willing to do. Pius IX shut himself up in his tiny domain and refused to leave it under any circmstances, regarding himself as the \\"Prisoner of the Vatican\\"; his successors to 1929 followed the policy and never set foot outside the Vatican once they were elected pope. Indeed, each of the \\"concessions carried with it a special servitude, while later events proved that they were not intended to be seriously observed. In the Encyclical of 15 May following, the pope declared that no guarantees could secure him the liberty and independence necessary in the exercise of his power and authority. He renewed this protest at the consistory of 27 October. And it stands to reason that a law voted by two houses of Parliament could with equal ease be abrogated by them at will. Indeed, it has ever been part of the programme of the \\"Left\\" party in the Italian Parliament to suppress the Law of Guarantees. Pius IX, moreover, was unwilling to accept formally the arrangements made concerning the relations of Church and State, especially the Exequatur and the administration of ecclesiastical property. Moreover, if, as he hoped, the occupation of Rome was to be only temporary, the acceptance of this law seemed useless. Doubtless, too, such acceptance on his part would have been interpreted as at least a tacit recognition of accomplished facts, as a renunciation of the temporal power, and the property which had been taken from the Holy See (e. g. the Quirinal Palace). The abandonment of the \\"Apostolic Legation\\" in Sicily, for eight centuries an apple of discord between the Holy See and the Kingdom of SicilySentis, \\"La Monarchia Sicula\\", Freiburg im Br., 1864, and the endowment granted the pope, were truly but slight compensation for all that had been taken from him. Consequently neither Pius IX nor his successors ever touched the aforesaid annual endowment, preferring to depend on the offerings of the faithful throughout the Catholic world. It may be added that the endowment was not sufficient to meet the needs of the Church, nor with their multiplication could it be increased. =Non expedit= Non expedit (Latin: \\"It is not expedient\\") were the words with which the Holy See enjoined upon Italian Catholics the policy of abstention from the polls in parliamentary elections. The encyclical also forbade Italian Catholics from holding office under the Crown of Italy. This policy was adopted after a period of uncertainty and of controversy which followed the promulgation of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Italy (1861), and which was intensified by laws hostile to the Church and, especially, to the religious orders (1865–66). To this uncertainty the Holy Penitentiary put an end by its decree of 29 February, 1868, in which, in the above words, it sanctioned the motto; \\"Neither elector nor elected\\". Until then there had been in the Italian Parliament a few eminent representatives of Catholic interests-Vito d'Ondes Reggio, Augusto Conti, Cesare Cantù, and others. The principal motive of this decree was that the oath taken by deputies might be interpreted as an approval of the spoliation of the Holy See, as Pius IX declared in an audience of 11 October, 1874. A practical reason for it, also, was that, in view of the electoral law of that day, by which the electorate was reduced to 650,000, and as the Government manipulated the elections to suit its own purposes, it would have been hopeless to attempt to prevent the passage of anti-Catholic laws. On the other hand, the masses seemed unprepared for parliamentary government, and as, in the greater portion of Italy (Parma, Modena, Tuscany, the Pontifical States, and the Kingdom of Naples), nearly all sincere Catholics were partizans of the dispossessed princes, they were liable to be denounced as enemies of Italy; they would also have been at variance with the Catholics of Piedmont and of the provinces wrested from Austria, and this division would have further weakened the Catholic Parliamentary group. As might be expected, this measure did not meet with universal approval; the so-called Moderates accused the Catholics of failing in their duty to society and to their country. In 1882, the suffrage having been extended, Leo XIII took into serious consideration the partial abolition of the restrictions established by the Non Expedit, but nothing was actually done (cf. \\"Archiv für kathol. Kirchenrecht\\", 1904, p. 396). On the contrary, as many people came to the conclusion that the decree Non Expedit was not intended to be absolute, but was only an admonition made to apply upon one particular occasion, the Holy Office declared (30 Dec., 1886) that the rule in question implied a grave precept, and emphasis was given to this fact on several subsequent occasions (Letter of Leo XIII to the Cardinal Secretary of State, 14 May, 1895; Congregation of Extraordinary Affairs, 27 January, 1902; Pius X, Motu proprio, 18 Dec., 1903). Later Pius X, by his encyclical \\"Il fermo proposito\\" (11 June, 1905) modified the Non Expedit, declaring that, when there was question of preventing the election of a \\"subversive\\" candidate, the bishops could ask for a suspension of the rule, and invite the Catholics to hold themselves in readiness to go to the polls. Legal status of the Holy See under the Law of Guarantees There was occasional controversy between writers on international law and on Italian ecclesiastical legislation over various matters connected with this law: whether in the eyes of the Italian government the pope is a sovereign, whether he enjoys the privilege of extraterritoriality (not expressly recognized to him, though granted to foreign embassies to the Holy See), etc. As far as the Holy See was concerned, these controversies had no meaning; it had never ceased to assert its sovereign status and corresponding rights. Some writers saw the Law of Guarantees as constitutive of the legal personality of the Holy See after 1870, conferring a legal personality subject to unilateral abrogation by the Kingdom of Italy. Other writers viewed the Law of Guarantees as a declarative instrument of the extant sovereignty of the Holy See.Cismas, Religious Actors and International Law, pg. 162. =Civil effects in Italian law= The question arose as to whether this untouched endowment would be confiscated by the Italian treasury at the end of every five years, as is usual with other public debts of the Kingdom of Italy. The Civiltà Cattolica maintained that it could not be confiscated, but the Italian courts long ago decided differently, when they rejected the claims of the heirs of Pius IX on the ground that as he had not accepted the endowment he had never come into possession of it. What need then of confiscating it? Pius IX expressly rejected this income, 13 November, 1872. Resolution of the Roman Question Territory of Vatican City State, established by the Lateran Accords After the papal rejection of the Law of Guarantees, the popes existed in a self-imposed state as \\"Prisoner of the Vatican\\" in diplomatic protestation of the Kingdom of Italy's claims to the Papal States. The popes refused to leave the Vatican.Metz, What is Canon Law?, pg. 130. At first the situation as embarrassing and even dangerous to the Italians, who feared that France or Austria might champion the cause of the Pope and compel them to evacuate Rome. But the defeat of these two Catholic nations by Prussia and, especially, the establishment of an anticlerical Republic in France, made such an event only a remote possibility, and the \\"Prisoner of the Vatican\\" became a polite fiction. As time went on there began a raprochement between the Vatican and the Quirinal,The Vatican is the palace of the pope, and the Quirinal was the palace of the king, but they are used figuratively to mean the Papacy and Italian government respectively (cf. Schapiro, Modern History, p. 447 footnote 1 & p. 448 footnote 1). though, in theory, the successors of Pius IX continued to advocate the restoration of their temporal power.Schapiro, Modern History, pp. 447-448. The situation was finally resolved in 1929 by the Lateran Pacts which created the State of Vatican City as an independent sovereign state to guarantee the political and legal independence of the pope from the Italian government. There is a treaty as well as a concordat, which together form a juridical whole.Metz, What is Canon Law?, pg. 131. Legacy Although in principle the popes refused to accept the Law of Guarantees, in practice they tacitly accepted some of its provisions.Duffy, Saints & Sinners, pg. 233. They allowed clergy to accept revenues from the Italian state deriving from their benefices. The popes began appointing all Italian bishops. Previously, various Italian civil authorities had had the right of presentation, but the Law of Guarantees had given the right of free conferral back to the pope. Since the Italian territories had more bishoprics than in any other part of Christendom, by 1870 Victor Emmanuel had the right to present 237 bishops for appointment, more than any other king in Christian history. Such immense powers of appointment would now be exercised by the popes directly, which changed the relationship between the papacy and the Italian episcopate and shifted views on who should appoint bishops in general. A new and growing assumption was that it was for the pope to directly appoint bishops. The loss of temporal power greatly enhanced papal control over the church in Italy.

It was released on June 7, 2005, by Callaway Arts & Entertainment. The book was written for readers aged six and up. The book's titular character is an Italian greyhound who learns the moral \\"money can't buy happiness\\". Madonna drew from her life when writing the story, from denouncing materialism to her motherhood. Portuguese artist Rui Paes illustrated the book, and modeled his illustrations on Renaissance and Baroque painting, and the works of painter Caravaggio. Callaway hosted a party for the book release at New York's Bergdorf Goodman store, where Madonna read the story aloud. She also made promotional appearances on television talk shows and gave magazine interviews. Lotsa de Casha debuted at number three on The New York Times Best Seller list. It received mixed reviews from book critics, who found some humor in the story, but felt it did not gel with Paes' illustrations, which received positive feedback. Synopsis In a distant land lived a wealthy merchant called Lotsa de Casha. He had everything money could buy, however Lotsa was still unhappy. So he sought out the opinion of all the well-known doctors of the land regarding his misery, but failed to find an answer. One day, his driver told him about a wise old man who lived faraway in an ancient city. Lotsa travels to the wise man who explained that the secret to his happiness was in sharing his wealth with others and putting them before himself. Lotsa was stunned since he had always put forth his own needs first, and became skeptical about the man's words. While exploring the ancient city, Lotsa saw a man slogging to change the wheel of his car by himself. But Lotsa did not stop to help and continued walking. He soon got lost and was robbed by two thieves who left him penniless. A distraught Lotsa cried for help to a passing driver and realized it was the same man he had seen earlier. The man, who called himself Mister Forfilla, agreed to give him a ride back to his house, but in exchange Lotsa had to work for him. Throughout their journey Forfilla ordered Lotsa de Casha to transport an assortment of things—including chairs, tables, clothing—to people's homes, who all appreciated the gifts. Forfilla explained Lotsa the same thing as the wise man, that sharing his wealth was the key to happiness. One night as he was driving the carriage, Lotsa was able to put someone else's need before his own by giving his blanket to a beggar who needed it. They finally reached Lotsa's palace and Forfilla confessed that it was his old home before Lotsa had bought it. Lotsa invited Forfilla inside for lunch, being a changed man now. Background and writing Madonna dedicated Lotsa de Casha to her then-husband alt=Guy Ritchie in a black shirt speaking while holding a microphone. In 2003, Madonna signed a contract with Callaway Arts & Entertainment for a series of five children's books. She explained that each book dealt \\"with issues that all children confront... Hopefully there is a lesson that will help kids turn painful or scary situations into learning experiences\\". During the promotion of the fourth book in the series, The Adventures of Abdi, Callaway announced the plans of publishing the fifth and final book titled Lotsa de Casha. The press release stated that the characters will be portrayed as animals with the central character, Lotsa de Casha, shown as an Italian greyhound in the style of Aesop's Fables. It was written for readers aged six and up with the moral that \\"money can't buy happiness\\". Madonna herself described Lotsa de Casha \\"as a story that claims that we can all resist selfishness and do something good for ourselves and for others\\". She confirmed that all profits gained from the sales of the book would be donated to charity. With Grazia magazine, Madonna explained that writing Lotsa de Casha was ironic since she felt it was a \\"parable of her life\\". The story reflected her own journey from being labeled a \\"material girl\\" to being a mother. Like the titular character—described by the Associated Press as \\"a wealthy Scroogelike greyhound\\"—the singer felt that she had changed from being materialistic. \\"I spent 15 years of my life thinking about myself, thinking about everything from the point of view of: 'What is in it for me?',\\" Madonna pondered. Accepting herself as someone \\"privileged\\", she realized that \\"ultimately material things won't bring you happiness. Most very wealthy people are not happy. Why? They have too much of something they don't need, and they don't share it with other people.\\" Lotsa de Casha was dedicated to her then-husband Guy Ritchie since he inspired her. Design and illustrations J. J. Grandville's cartoons inspired illustrator Rui Paes' sketches.alt=A group of cartoon animals wearing formal clothing and pointing fingers. According to Communication Arts, the calligraphy of the book was done by Julian Waters with Japanese novelist Toshiya Masuda as the art director and Krupa Jhaveri as the book designer. The images were illustrated by Portuguese painter Rui Paes, who was contacted by Callaway after seeing his painting in The New York Times Magazine of a Singerie in Norway. Having established that he would maintain the secrecy of the project, Callaway sent him the story-draft, based on which Paes developed a small batch of sketches. Among them were cartoon-like paintings based on anthropomorphic animals by French caricaturist J. J. Grandville. The publishers liked them and the idea of the main characters depicted as animals were carried on for the book. Paes sketched various aspect of the characters which helped him in understanding the different nuances the story presented. It took him almost two years to finish the illustrations with the majority of the work being accomplished in the final twelve months. Paes worked 12–14 hours per day uninterruptedly everyday which resulted him getting back pain and Callaway sending him an Aeron chair to aid him. Madonna worked closely with Paes, supplying him the material to be included in the book. She suggested he should travel to Siena and Rome for inspiration, and sent him drawings by her children for inclusion. The artist researched on Renaissance and Baroque painting for further inspiration, including the works of painter Caravaggio. Paes recalled the singer became the inspiration for the image of the wise old man's wife in the story. The animal characters were given as much human qualities and emotions as possible, with hand and body expressions to convey. Paes removed two images from the final illustrations, feeling they were inadequate. Publication and reception alt=Bergdorf Goodman building shot from the exterior opposite street. The book was released on June 7, 2005, at a party hosted by retailer Bergdorf Goodman at New York's Fifth Avenue. It was attended by socialites and artists with signed copies of Lotsa de Casha available to purchase for $75, proceedings going to UNICEF. Attendees were dressed up in 18th century garments, depicting characters from the book. According to Reuters, the book reading at Bergdorf Goodman \\"drew puzzled responses from the group of about 25 kids, who appeared to have difficulty grasping the book's morals\\". Other promotions included book signing at Borders Time Warner Center and reading sessions at New York libraries. The singer read out to the students of Saint Ann's School from Brooklyn Heights, and handed out autographed copies. Tatiana Delgiannakis from New York Post noted that Madonna employed an Italian accent while reading aloud Lotsa's parts. Madonna appeared on NBC's Today show and ABC's The View to talk about the book, and gave interview in Ladies' Home Journal magazine for its July 2005 issue. Lotsa de Casha debuted at number three on The New York Times Best Seller list. Elaine Stuart from Parenting found humor in the names Madonna gave in the book, like naming Lotsa's castle as \\"Flasha de Casa\\" and the mountain on which it is situated as the \\"Muchadougha Mountains\\", details she believed would make the readers laugh. Roy Blatchford from Books for Keeps liked the story and rated it four-out-of- five stars. He said that the story avoided any cliche plots, \\"creates a number of original cameos and bounces along with humour and lively dialogue, clearly influenced by [Madonna]'s Italian New York background.\\" Blatchford complimented Paes' images describing them as \\"striking\\" and the design as \\"eye-catching\\" thus making Lotsa de Casha \\"a first-class picture book to grace any library\\". A review in Publishers Weekly called the story as \\"artless fable\\" but believed that Paes' illustrations improved it with the \\"tongue-in- cheek homage to classic Baroque painting\\". The reviewer found that in contrast to the grand images, the story appeared simple and the accented edge on Lotsa's words were \\"uncharacteristic of a rich gentleman\\". Delgiannakis complimented the \\"beautifully illustrated\\" images in the book but found it to be littered with \\"preachy factoids\\" like \\"Just because something is expensive, doesn’t mean it's worth it\\". Boyd Tonkin from The Independent panned the release, calling it \\"howlingly egotistical\\" and a vehicle of \\"personal gratification\\" for Madonna, \\"rather than a virtue in itself\\". Ilene Cooper of Booklist said that like many other celebrities-turned-authors, Madonna mistakenly thought that she could write books for children.

This intellectual synthesis of \\"radical nationalism and dissident socialist\\" formed in France and Italy at the beginning of the 20th century.Guntram H. Herb, David H. Kaplan, edit., Nations and Nationalism: A Global Historical Overview, Santa Barbara, CA, ABC-CLIO, 2008, chap: “Perversions of Nationalism,” Aristotle A. Kallis, p. 515 Revolutionary nationalism is sometimes identified with proletarian nationalism.  Early nationalism  By the middle of the 19th century, nationalism was transforming from a citizens’ movement that had opposed the excesses of state power held under the autocratic authority of the monarchies to one where nationalism became a method of political legitimacy for the ruling elite.Guntram H. Herb, David H. Kaplan, edit., Nations and Nationalism: A Global Historical Overview, Santa Barbara, CA, ABC-CLIO, 2008, chap: “Perversions of Nationalism,” Aristotle A. Kallis, p. 512 The early nationalist movements originally struggled to attain self-determination and freedom, but in the last decades of the 19th century, with the introduction of socialism, a movement arose to foster collective identity and revolutionary nationalism.Guntram H. Herb, David H. Kaplan, edit., Nations and Nationalism: A Global Historical Overview, Santa Barbara, CA, ABC-CLIO, 2008, chap: “Perversions of Nationalism,” Aristotle A. Kallis, p. 513 A few decades before World War I, various socialist factions clashed over the meaning of nationalism and socialism, causing one bloc to drift towards nationalistic-based socialism and the other towards internationally based socialism. This movement for national identity threatened monarchical empires that were populated by wide variety of ethnic, religious, linguistic and cultural groups.  World War I  During the onset of World War I, socialist political parties in Austria, Britain, France, Germany and Russia went along with the nationalist current and decided to support their nations' interventionist policies during the war.Spencer Tucker and Priscilla Roberts, editors, Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social, and Military History, 5 Vol. set, Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, Tucker, 2005, p. 884 At this point, most of the socialist parties and members that held positions in the Second International \\"abandoned their commitment to internationalism and supported their national government\\", Cheng Chen, The Prospects for Liberal Nationalism in Post-Leninist States, Pennsylvania State University Press, 2007, p. 37 a dispute that lead to the dissolution of the Second International in 1916. The crisis could not be resolved since so many members held the position that the \\"nation triumphed over class\\" and \\"nationalism overrode internationalism\\". Yannis Sygkelos, Nationalism from the Left: The Bulgarian Communist Party During the Second World War and the Early Post-War Years, Brill Academic Pub, 2011, p. 13 According to Italian historian Emilio Gentile, this conflict lead to a condition where socialists and revolutionaries sought an ideology where a revolutionary nationalism would fuse the \\"myth of the nation with the myth of the revolution through interventionism\\". Emilio Gentile, The Struggle for Modernity: Nationalism, Futurism, and Fascism, Westport, CT, Praeger, 2003, p. 6 In Italy, a number of revolutionary syndicalists found it relevant to identify the \\"communality\\" of man not with class, but with the nation, causing the first intimations of revolutionary nationalism to make their debut \\"among the most radical Marxists\\". A. James Gregor, Giovanni Gentile: Philosopher of Fascism, New Brunswick: NJ, Transaction Publishers, 2004, p. 55 Even Vladimir Lenin noticed this nationalist trend among socialist intellectuals and at first thought it had some potential for Marxist strategy and that the \\"force of nationalism\\" should be taken into consideration. Cheng Chen, The Prospects for Liberal Nationalism in Post-Leninist States, Westport, CT, Praeger, 2003, p. 37  Benito Mussolini's revolutionary nationalism  According to A. James Gregor, Mussolini had a fuzzy and imprecise approach to the concept of revolutionary nationalism by 1909, although he acknowledged its historical role which later provided the groundwork of his subsequent views, including revolutionary syndicalism.A. James Gregor, Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism, University of California Press, 1979, p. 75Cf. I. De Begnac, Vita di Mussolini, II, ch. 7, mostly p. 157 Mussolini maintained that if the masses were to be energized by the sentiments of nationality, \\"only the revolutionary socialists could effectively and legitimately commit that energy to national purpose\\". A. James Gregor, Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism, University of California Press, 1979, p. 98 Despite Mussolini's inclination towards nationalism, he was still opposed to traditional patriotism and conventional nationalist appeal which included his emphatic rejection of the type of nationalism that was championed by the privileged classes and traditional bourgeoisie, who simply used the slogans of nationalism \\"whenever a profit might be turned\\". A. James Gregor, Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism, University of California Press, 1979, p. 97 One of most cogent descriptions of Mussolini's approach to his version of nationalism follows: > Mussolini's revolutionary nationalism, while it distinguished itself from > the traditional patriotism and nationalism of the bourgeoisie, displayed > many of those features we today identify with the nationalism of > underdeveloped peoples. It was an anticonservative nationalism that > anticipated vast social changes; it was directed against both foreign and > domestic oppressors; it conjured up an image of a renewed and regenerated > nation that would perform a historical mission; it invoked a moral ideal of > selfless sacrifice and commitment in the service of collective goals; and it > recalled ancient glories and anticipated a shared and greater glory.A. James > Gregor, Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism, University > of California Press, 1979, p. 99 Mussolini would commonly use nationalist language in his writings while at the same time conveying the importance of an internationalist class analysis.Mark Neocleous, Fascism, University of Minnesota Press, 1997 p. 20 Mussolini's concept of revolutionary nationalism often alluded to its compatibility with an \\"ideal socialist internationalism\\" while articulating that the \\"nation\\" constituted \\"the most advanced collective organism attained by civilized ethnic groups\\" in our time. A. James Gregor, Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism, University of California Press, 1979, p. 98 Nonetheless, Mussolini and Fascist syndicalists were confident that a time would come when mankind would negate national antagonisms in a universal brotherhood of peoples. However, Mussolini's sudden shift in 1914 to publicly clamor for Italy's entry into World War I was based on more than a simple expression of nationalistic pride. Mussolini based his foreign interventionist policies on Karl Marx’s premise that social revolutions can supersede war.Christopher Hibbert, Mussolini: The Rise and Fall of Il Duce, New York: NY, St. Martin’s Press, 2008, p. 21. At this point, Mussolini attributed \\"great importance to war as a catalyst for revolution\\".Richard Pipes, Three “Whys” of the Russian Revolution, New York, NY, Vintage Books, 1997, p. 38Benito Mussolini, “The War as a Revolution,” 1914, in Roger Griffin, editor, Fascism, 1995, pp. 26–28 Other Italian Fascists considered their radical nationalism to be based on the struggle for equality by the plebeians, who were seen as being exploited by plutocratic governments. Robert Michels, an early revolutionary syndicalist who affiliated with the National Fascist Party by 1924, declared that Fascism was \\"the revolutionary nationalism of the poor\\". A. James Gregor, The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century, Yale University Press, 2000, p. 133  Modern revolutionary nationalism  Modern revolutionary nationalism is a mixture of far-right nationalism and left-wing nationalism with a socialist vision of society.Nicolas Lebourg, « Qu’est ce que le nationalisme-révolutionnaire » ? (1/2), Fragments sur les Temps Présents, March 9 2009.

The film was originally made as an amateur short 12 minute collage of short clips from Russian media outlets and amateur clips by Russians for Field of Vision. It was subsequently expanded into a full-length documentary, showing how the Russian media (especially Russia 1, Russia Today and NTV) overhyped the election of Trump in a Russo-centric manner, falsified information leading common Russian people to behave irrationally.

Our New President editors Maxim Pozdorovkin and Matvey Kulakov won the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Award for Editing.

Biography  Gross was born as Shulamit Lifszyc in Grodno, Poland (today, Hrodna, Belarus). She was the daughter of Fryda and Mejer Lifszyc. She studied in the local Tarbut school, and later on at the Belarusian State Polytechnic Institute in Minsk. When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union during the summer of 1941, she fled to Tashkent in Uzbekistan. Here she continued her studies in the faculty of geology, which she graduated cum laude in 1945. Her parents died in the Treblinka extermination camp in 1943. She began a PhD in the Radioactive Micas of Central Asia, but was not permitted KGB security clearance, and her studies were terminated. After graduating, she moved to Lomonosov University in Moscow to conduct research in crystallography. Her second project considered \\"The ionic radius affect on lattice structure and mineral properties”. In 1950 she immigrated to Israel (Aliyah) with her husband, the film director Natan Gross, and their baby, Yaakov, who later became a film director in his adult life as well.  Research  Shulamit Gross at work Gross was known for her research on the mineralogy of the Hatrurim Formation. In 1958 she began working at the Israel Atomic Energy Commission. During the 1960s, a group of scientists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, including Yaakov Ben-Tor, and Lisa Heller-Kallai, discovered the unique mineral assemblage found in the Hatrurim Formation. She moved to the Israeli Geological Society in 1961. She became a PhD candidate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1964, working on \\"The Mineralogy of the Hatrurim Formation, Israel\\". A mineralogical analysis revealed that the rocks contain common minerals such as diopside, wollastonite, garnet, anorthite, as well as rare minerals such as spurrite, brownmillerite, gehlenite, and larnite. These rare minerals only form at high temperatures, for example in places where siliceous limestones are contact-metamorphosed by volcanic rocks (commonly basalt). These minerals are also common in man-made Portland cement, used in the construction industry. The manufacturing of Portland cement involves a similar process: heating of limestone or chalk with siliceous clay at high temperatures (1300 °C). She continued to study the minerals and in 1977 published a monograph describing 123 mineral species discovered in the Hatrurim Formation. Five were previously known only from a single locality, and eight others were known only as synthetic products of the cement industry. Gross also discovered several minerals completely new to science: bentorite, ye’elimite, and hatrurite. A fourth mineral discovered by Gross was only described later by Dietmar Weber and Adolf Bischoff, which they named grossite after Shulamit. She demonstrated that the unique mineral assemblage of the Hatrurim Formation formed by pyrometamorphism, and she managed to recreate most of the minerals by heating the precursor sedimentary rocks of the Ghareb and Taqiye formations. Her discoveries earned her the inaugural Rafael Freund Award of the Israeli Geological Society in 1979. She became an honorary member of the Israel Geological Society in 1986. An additional mineral discovered in the Hatrurim Formation was named shulamitite in 2011. She died on September 18, 2012.

Irick, then aged 26, had been living with Dyer's family for over a year, and was babysitting five of the family's children (including Paula Kay) on the night of the girl's murder. Irick was the first inmate executed in Tennessee for almost a decade.  Irick's background  Irick was born on August 26, 1958, in Knoxville, Tennessee. He allegedly suffered extensive abuse from his family from a young age, including one incident where a neighbor witnessed Irick's father clubbing him with a piece of lumber. His mental health was reportedly first questioned in March 1965, when he was 6. A psychological evaluation was subsequently performed at the request of his school's principal, owing to his \\"extreme behavioral problems\\". Nina Braswell Lunn, a clinical social worker performed the subsequent evaluation of Irick, when he was in the first grade. Lunn noted that he had shared stories with her about being tied up and beaten at home because his parents could not control him. Lunn later testified that Irick may have been suffering from mild organic brain damage since birth. Irick was briefly institutionalized before being sent to an orphanage for emotionally disturbed children. During an arranged visit to his parents' home in 1972, Irick (then aged 13) reportedly hit the household's TV set with an axe of some description, destroyed flower beds, and cut up his sister's pajamas as she was wearing them while sleeping with a razor blade.  Relationship with the Jeffers family  In 1983, while working as a dishwasher at a truck stop in Knoxville, Irick met and befriended Kenny Jeffers, an auto mechanic who lived in nearby Clinton. Jeffers later introduced Irick to Kathy, his wife whom he had married the previous year, and ultimately in 1984 Irick moved in with the couple and five of the eight children between them. (Seven of the children, including Paula Dyer, were the offspring of previous relationships, while the Jeffers' first child together was born in 1983.) Irick frequently babysat the children while the Jeffers parents worked long hours. At the start of April 1985, the family home in Clinton burned down, an ordeal during which Irick saved two of the boys from the burning building. Nobody was severely injured or killed during the fire; however, the family had to live in separate abodes as a result of difficulty in finding a house big enough for all eight of them. Thus, Irick moved to the Western Heights neighborhood with Kenny Jeffers, where they lived with Kenny's parents, while Kathy and the children moved to a small rental home on Exeter Avenue in Knoxville.  Paula Dyer  Paula Kay Dyer (March 5, 1978 April 16, 1985) was described as a positive young girl who saw the best in others and was extremely trusting of people. Her mother claimed that, when told she could not randomly try to hold hands with strangers, Paula replied with: \\"Why, mommy? Jesus loves everybody. Why can't I?\\" Paula's kind personality quickly made a positive impression on the neighbors of their new home. Her mother recalled one instance of Paula befriending a next-door neighbor shortly after their arrival at the address, after presenting the neighbor with flowers she had picked from the flower beds at the very front of the house. = Dyer's murder = On the morning of Monday, April 15, 1985, following an argument, Kathy Jeffers kicked Irick out of the Exeter Avenue home. That night, because the family's regular babysitter was unavailable, Kenny Jeffers dropped Irick off at the same house to babysit the children. When Kathy left for work at 10 pm, the children were asleep, and she felt uncomfortable leaving the children in Irick's care, on account of the argument earlier that day, Irick's behavior, and her suspicions that he had been drinking. At around midnight, Kenny Jeffers received a call from Irick, telling him to come because Irick was unable \\"to wake [Paula] up\\". Upon arriving at the Exeter Avenue address, Kenny found Irick standing in the doorway looking vacant, before finding Paula unconscious on the living room floor in a pool of her own blood. After finding a pulse, Kenny wrapped Paula in a blanket and took her to the nearest children's hospital, where a doctor attempted unsuccessfully for 45 minutes to revive her. The same doctor, Jim Kimball, pronounced Paula dead of asphyxiation in the early hours of April 16, 1985. She was 7 years old. Following Paula's autopsy, her cause of death was confirmed to be asphyxiation. In addition, the severe tears in her vagina and rectum were confirmed to be consistent with rape, as well as a head injury sustained during her ordeal being attributed to blunt force trauma that may have knocked her unconscious. As a result of Paula's murder, the Knoxville police department told the public on the morning of April 16 to be on the lookout for a man matching Irick's physical description. By 5 pm, Irick had been found and arrested beneath a bridge on I-275. Paula Dyer was buried on April 19 following a fundraising campaign by the community she had been part of for less than two weeks.  Legal proceedings and incarceration  Police testified that Irick readily confessed to murdering Paula Dyer, both verbally and in writing, and described his behavior as cooperative and remorseful. On April 17, 1985, Irick was arraigned in Dyer's murder, and was appointed two attorneys by a judge after he claimed that he planned to confess and thus did not want a lawyer. On October 26, 1986, Irick went on trial for killing Dyer. Six days later, on November 1, he was found guilty by a Knox County jury. The defense had launched a failed mental illness claim in an attempt to spare Irick from the death penalty. Irick's mother refused to testify for the defense in an attempt to save Irick's life. On December 3, 1986, that same jury sentenced Irick to death by electrocution, with a tentative execution date of May 4, 1987 (which was stayed). Upon delivery of this verdict, Irick merely smiled and shrugged his shoulders.  Execution  On March 28, 2017, the Tennessee Supreme Court (TNSC) upheld the lethal injection protocols adopted by the Tennessee Department of Correction (TDoC). Thus, on January 18, 2018, the TNSC scheduled Irick's execution for August 9, 2018 — his sixth execution date since arrival on death row. In July 2018, a bench trial was held in Nashville regarding a lawsuit against the TDoC and its execution protocol, filed by over half of the population of Tennessee's death row. On July 26, the chair of the bench, Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle, ruled in favor of the TDoC. On August 6, the TNSC refused to grant a stay of Irick's execution to allow an appeal of the ruling. That same day, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam refused to intervene in Irick's case. Finally, on August 9, 2018, the day of his scheduled execution, the United States Supreme Court refused to grant a stay of execution to Irick on the grounds of his mental health.. Subsequently, Irick was executed at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution that day. He was pronounced dead at 7:48 pm. Irick's execution was the first in Tennessee since Cecil Johnson was executed on December 2, 2009.

Early life and education Mary Catherine or May Guinness was born in Rathfarnham, County Dublin on 11 March 1863. She was the third of the seven children of solicitor, Thomas Hosea Guinness and Mary Davis, the only daughter and heiress of Charles Davis of Coolmanna, County Carlow. Through her father, she was a descendant of Arthur Guinness. She was educated at home, by both French and German governesses, and attending Mrs Power's school, leaving to teach her younger siblings. This responsibility resulted in her not pursuing art until she was in her 30s. She travelled with Mildred Anne Butler in 1894 to Newlyn in Cornwall to study under Norman Garstin. Career Guinness was a member of the Water Colour Society of Ireland from 1892. She exhibited with the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1897, continuing to show with them until 1911. She spent a period of time painting in Florence from 1902 to 1903, and then in Paris in 1905. While there she saw the early work of Henri Matisse and the Fauves, which left a lasting impression on Guinness. Techniques such as free brushwork start to appear in her paintings, including Procession at Josselin and Cathedral at Diest. She studied with Kees van Dongen and Hermenegildo Anglada Camarasa between 1905 and 1922. Guinness left Dublin in 1915 to enlist as a nurse in the French army. She worked from near the village of Vadelaincourt at Hospital No 12. While there, she recorded her experiences in a diary. In 1917 she was awarded the Croix de Guerre for her bravery during the Battle of Verdun. After the end of World War I she also received the Medal of French Gratitude. She spent winters in Paris from 1922 to 1925, working with the cubist artist André Lhote. Through Lhote, Guinness became close friends with Mainie Jellett and Evie Hone. Amongst her most well known works from this time is Still life, held in the Hugh Lane Gallery. She held a solo exhibition at the Galerie Visconti, Paris in January 1925. By the 1930s, she had returned to a more fauvist style. A chronology of her work is difficult to establish as she never dated her works. Therefore her work is grouped into three periods: pre-1922, 1922 to 1925, and post-1925. This is further complicated by the fact she often assumed the style of other artists, but this openness seemed to make her work unique in Ireland. She continued to travel into her 70s, exposing herself to broad and new artistic influences and collecting modernist paintings including Matisse and Pablo Picasso. She painted local landscapes in Ireland, but also places such as Toledo, Greece and Palestine. This broad experience was influential on younger Irish artists such as Grace Henry and Mary Swanzy. Later life and legacy Guinness was a private person, and became more reclusive in her later years. Her artistic output appears to have overcome this however. She lived in the family home in Tibradden after World War I. Following the death of her mother in 1925, she moved into an annexe at the home of Evie Hone at Marlay House, Rathfarnham. She moved back to Tibradden in 1933, living there until her death. Guinness died on 16 July 1955 in Dublin. The following year a memorial exhibition was held at Dawson Hall, Dawson Street. Her art collection was auctioned off after her death, with the funds raised being donated for the repair of the roof of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.

It is situated within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness which is part of the Cascade Range. Huckleberry Mountain is set on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Huckleberry Mountain is northeast of Snoqualmie Pass, and 0.77 mile west of Chikamin Peak, which is also its nearest higher peak. The Pacific Crest Trail traverses the south and east slope of Huckleberry Mountain, and from the trail a scramble leads to the summit. Precipitation runoff on the east side of the mountain drains into tributaries of the Yakima River, whereas the west side of the peak drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River. Climate Huckleberry Mountain Huckleberry Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The elevation range of this area is between about in the lower elevations to over on Mount Stuart. Huckleberry from southwest The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada–US border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Both universities are founding members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). History In 1904, Dan McGugin was hired at Vanderbilt and John Heisman was hired at Georgia Tech. In 2016, a trophy for the contest, the Gold Cowbell,https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/georgia-tech-and- vanderbilt-are-playing-for-a-cowbell-trophy-091616 was unearthed after almost 70 years of dormancy. Notable games =1906: Manier scores five touchdowns= The 1906 Vanderbilt team was one of the strongest in its history. Owsley Manier rushed for five touchdowns on Tech. Lob Brown scored for Tech. Sportswriter Alex Lynn wrote after the game that Manier was: \\"the greatest fullback and all round man ever seen in Atlanta.\\" =1907: Heisman's worst loss at Tech= Vanderbilt beat Georgia Tech 54–0. \\"The rooters stridently called: \\"We want sixty! We want sixty!\\" The highlight of the first half came on a triple pass. Sam Costen passed the ball to Honus Craig, Craig passed it to Morton and Morton passed it to Bob Blake, who ran to the side and passed it 25 yards back to Costen. Costen ran the remaining 20 yards for a touchdown. =1917: Vanderbilt's worst loss= The 1917 Georgia Tech team was the South's first national champion. Despite Vanderbilt having a respectable team, Tech beat Vanderbilt 83–0, the worst loss they have ever suffered. \\"It was not until 1917 that a Southern team really avenged long-time torment at McGugin's hands. And it took one of history's top backfields–Joe Guyon, Ev Strupper, Al Hill, and Judy Harlan of Georgia Tech–to do it,\\" wrote Edwin Pope. Guyon was the game's star; according to Morgan Blake, \\"Guyon has been great in all games this year. But Saturday he was the superman\\". Vanderbilt captain Alf Adams praised the Tech team: \\"Tech's magnificent machine won easily over Vanderbilt. It was simply the matter of a splendid eleven winning over an unseasoned, inexperienced team. Tech played hard, clean football, and we were somewhat surprised to meet such a fair, aggressive team, after the reports we had heard. I think that Vanderbilt could have broken that Tech shift if we had had last year's eleven. Being outweighed, Vanderbilt could not check the heavy forwards, or open up the line. Thereby hangs the tale.\\" =1919: Vanderbilt loses in the mud= Tech-Vanderbilt in 1919. In Heisman's final year at Tech, Vanderbilt suffered its only loss on the year in the mud, 20–0 against Georgia Tech. Halfback Buck Flowers and fullback Bill Gaiver starred. Flowers had a 78-yard touchdown run. Vanderbilt's captain was Josh Cody. =1920: Flowers and Barron run up a large score= With Flowers and Red Barron in the backfield, SIAA champion Tech defeated Vanderbilt 44–0. During the scoring barrage, Flowers converted a 44-yard drop kick field goal. In the fourth quarter, a fight broke out between Vanderbilt's Gink Hendrick, and some Tech players and fans. No ejections could be made since too many players were involved. =1924: Wakefield's field goal beats Tech= All-American Hek Wakefield scored on a 37-yard drop kick field goal for Vanderbilt's first win in Atlanta since 1906.Vanderbilt Football 2014 Fact Book , Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, pp. 125, 137, 142, 151 (2014).

Doug Wycoff was hurt, and his substitute Dick Wright was sent in with only minutes to go in the game. On a muddy field, Wright ran off tackle and dodged Vanderbilt's safety Gil Reese, \\"usually a sure tackler,\\" to get the touchdown that gave Tech a 7–0 victory. The yearbook remarked, Wright \\"should have run for governor of Georgia right after he ran 56 yards against Vandy.\\" =1927: Spears and Armistead held scoreless= On a wet field, Tech's strong defense held the high scoring Vanderbilt team, including Hall of Famer Bill Spears and high scorer Jimmy Armistead, to a scoreless tie. =1928: national champions end Commodores title hopes= Georgia Tech ended the Jimmy Armistead-led Vanderbilt Commodores' hopes of a southern title with a 19–7 victory. Tech went on to win the Rose Bowl and a national title. Georgia Tech's first touchdown came on a pass from Tom Jones to Warner Mizell on a triple pass play. Georgia Tech's next score came on an end run from Mizell. Vanderbilt's lone score came on an run by lineman Bull Brown after picking up a Stumpy Thomason fumble. =1931: McGugin's trick= Pete Gracey said \\"In my first varsity year, the night before we played Georgia Tech, Coach McGugin casually walked up to me in the lobby of our hotel, put his arm around my shoulder and sorta whispered, \\"I was with some Atlanta newspapermen this afternoon and I told them you were the finest sophomore center I had ever coached.

The bacteria are acidophilic, thermophilic, and produce endospores. The first identified strains of A. acidocaldarius were from geysers in Yellowstone National Park and fumerole soil in Hawaii Volcano National Park. The species was originally classified as Bacillus acidocaldarius in 1971, but further 16S rRNA studies found that the species belonged in the newly created genus Alicyclobacillus. The species name is derived from the Latin acidum (acid) and caldarius (pertaining to warm or hot), referring to the acidic and high temperature environments from which it was first isolated. Thomas D.

It is located in the Okanogan National Forest in Skagit County. It is situated northwest of Rainy Pass, southwest of Porcupine Peak, and southeast of Graybeard Peak. Its nearest higher neighbor is Repulse Peak, to the west. Blackbeard Peak can be seen from the North Cascades Highway. Precipitation runoff from Blackbeard Peak drains into Granite Creek, a tributary of the Skagit River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area.Blackbeard seen from the east along North Cascades Highway The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Scott was known for his vehement opposition to the income tax, and in 1991, led a protest against the tax that numbered 40,000 people. Scott campaigned for a seat on the United States House of Representatives from Connecticut's 3rd congressional district in 1990, losing to Democrat Rosa DeLauro. He then founded the Connecticut Taxpayers Committee. Scott faced DeLauro for a second time in 1992, and lost again. After leaving the state legislature, Scott worked as a real estate broker and, starting in 1993, a radio talk show host for WPOP. He contested the 1994 Connecticut gubernatorial election as an independent and lost. In January 1995, Scott returned to radio, hosting a show on WTIC (AM). Scott subsequently moved to WELI. He hosted the radio show Off Center with Roger Vann until Vann left the station in 1999. In July 2008, Scott rejoined WELI. That October, he interviewed Chris Dodd. WELI chose not to air the interview, due to disagreements between cohost and producer Ryan Gorman and Scott, which led to Scott leaving the station.

It lacked vertical flying surfaces, had an unusual control system and made only one short flight. Rebuilt with conventional tail and controls, it won the distance flown prize at the second contest, held in 1925. Design and development Reports of the first German glider contest, held at the Wasserkuppe in the late summer of 1920, generated considerable interest in Poland, leading to the First Polish Glider Contest at Czarna Góra between 30 August and 13 September 1923. The contest was not a great success, limited by novice designers and pilots and a poor site, but the Karpiński SL.1 Akar was by far the most successful entrant. The Żabuś was designed for the contest by Captain Franciszek Jach and built in the Pilots' Lower School's workshops at Bydgoszcz. The wooden glider had a two-part, rectangular plan,fabric covered parasol wing built around two spars. Its outer parts carried washout and had unusual short but broad chord ailerons which widened to full chord close to the tip. Each aileron was operated independently with its own lever. The wing was held low over the fuselage by a steel tube cabane and braced centrally with outward-leaning splayed N-struts from the fuselage lower longerons to the wing spars on each side. Its rectangular section, plywood-covered fuselage included an open cockpit under the wing and had an unusual profile, like a cambered airfoil with a strongly arched underside. At the rear there were no vertical surfaces, only a broad chord, triangular tailplane carrying a one-piece, fabric-covered, foot- operated elevator. Jach piloted the Żabuś on its only flight and crashed after only 19 seconds, probably because of the unconventional control system. It was rebuilt for the 1925 Second Polish Polish Glider Contest, held at Oksywie on the Baltic coast, as the Żabuś 2. After the rebuild the glider had a large, fabric-covered fin and rudder of overall trapezoidal profile, with an appropriately altered control system. As well as making several short flights the Żabuś 2, piloted by Władysław Sulczewski, won the straight line distance prize with a flight covering . Variants ;Żabuś: Original, 1923 Contest competitor without vertical tail surfaces and with unusual control system. ;Żabuś 2: Rebuilt Żabuś, with conventional fin and rudder and correspondingly modified control system.

It was developed and is owned by APA Group. At the time of its completion in 2018, it was the largest solar farm in Western Australia. When APA group bought Emu Downs Wind Farm in June 2011, it realised that there is usually a drop in output in the middle of the day as the wind changes from easterly in the morning to the westerly Fremantle Doctor in the afternoon. To balance that and achieve better utilisation of transmission infrastructure, APA installed a 20MW solar farm on an adjacent site. The solar farm's peak output is during the time when the wind farm is not at full capacity, so no additional capacity was needed in the substation or grid connection point. The solar farm has 75,000 photovoltaic solar panels on a 70-hectare site east of the wind farm. It cost (including a federal government grant of ) and began operation in December 2017. The output of both the solar and wind farms is contracted to Synergy until 2030.

Early life Robert Browne was born in 1803 to Robert and Winfield Browne. Career He was the architect and surveyor to the General Steam Navigation Company of London. He was responsible for a number of the firm's works at Coldharbour in London after they bought land and leases there from 1842. These included two piers in front of the pre-existing Brown's Wharf and Stewart's Wharf, and a new wharf at London Bridge in the 1860s.Southern Blackwall: Coldharbour. British History Online. Retrieved 14 August 2018. In 1860 he was practising from 15 Royal Place, Royal Hill, Greenwich. Death Browne died at Royal Place, Greenwich, on 18 December 1872. His executor was his brother George Henry Browne, gentleman.

This gene encodes a protein with a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain containing several TPRs of about 34 amino acids each. These repeats are found in a variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi and plants, and are involved in a variety of functions including protein-protein interactions. This protein is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is involved in the formation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain III. It has also been suggested that this protein plays a role in cytokinesis. Mutations in this gene cause mitochondrial complex III deficiency. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.  Structure  The TTC19 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 17 at position 12 and it spans 46,048 base pairs. The TTC19 gene produces a 16 kDa protein composed of 149 amino acids. TTC19 is a subunit of the enzyme Ubiquinol Cytochrome c Reductase (UQCR, Complex III or Cytochrome bc1 complex) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which consists of the products of one mitochondrially encoded gene, MTCYTB (mitochondrial cytochrome b) and ten nuclear genes: UQCRC1, UQCRC2, Cytochrome c1, UQCRFS1 (Rieske protein), UQCRB, \\"14kDa protein\\", UQCRH (cyt c1 Hinge protein), Rieske Protein presequence, \\"cyt. c1 associated protein\\", and \\"Rieske-associated protein\\". The structure of the complex is a symmetric homodimer composed of one mitochondrial genome encoded cytochrome b subunit and ten other nucleus encoded subunits. Function The TTC19 gene encodes for one of the ten nuclear proteins essential for the assembly and function of the Ubiquinol Cytochrome c Reductase or Complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The Ubiquinol Cytochrome c Reductase is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of electrons from coenzyme Q to cytochrome c as well as pumping protons from the matrix into the inner membrane which results in the generation of an ATP-coupled electrochemical potential. The TTC19 subunit is necessary for the preservation of the structural and functional integrity of Ubiquinol Cytochrome c Reductase, which is achieved by allowance of the physiological turnover of the Rieske protein (UQCRFS1). It also participates in the clearance of UQCRFS1 N-terminal fragments which are produced by the addition of UQCRFS1 into the Ubiquinol Cytochrome c Reductase and whose presence may lead to the failure of the complex's catalytic activity. Clinical significance Variants of TTC19 have been associated with mitochondrial complex III deficiency, nuclear 2 (MC3DN2). TTC19 is known to cause this deficiency through the failed assembly of the Ubiquinol Cytochrome c Reductase. Mitochondrial complex III deficiency, nuclear (type 2) is a diverse group of neuromuscular and multi-systemic disorders caused by a dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain which may result in highly variable phenotype depending on which tissues are affected. Clinical features include mitochondrial encephalopathy, psychomotor retardation, ataxia, severe failure to thrive, liver dysfunction, renal tubulopathy, muscle weakness and exercise intolerance. In addition, mutations in TTC19 is also known to be associated with various neurological disorders in both childhood and adulthood. All Pathogenic mutations of this gene have been reported to be nonsense mutations. Such mutations have included (c.937C>T; p. Q313X), (c.157_158dup), and (c.829C > T; p.Q277*).  Interactions  TTC19 binds to the mature mitochondrial complex III dimer after the incorporation of the Rieske protein UQCRFS1. Additional interactions include interactions with proteins UQCRC1, UQCRFS1 (by similarity), ZFYVE26, and CHMP4B.
