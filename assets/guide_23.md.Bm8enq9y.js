The disease primarily affects putting greens and causes yellow or brown rings up to in diameter. Brown ring patch was first observed in Japan and has since spread to the United States (approximately 2005) and China (2011). Hosts and symptoms The fungus causing brown ring patch, Waitea circinata var. circinata, was first identified in Japan in 2005 damaging creeping bentgrass. The disease was thought to be restricted to Japan until its first report in the United States in 2007 infecting annual bluegrass. There is typically a period of six weeks or more between first infection of the roots and the presentation of symptoms. The disease causes circular or scalloped rings in the turf up to in diameter, with the width of the ring itself being up to . The rings turn from yellow to light or reddish brown as the disease progresses. The disease is most noticeable on putting greens and commonly occurs in the spring with rising temperatures. Brown Ring Patch is similar to other Rhizoctonia species, but appears to infect upper roots, crowns, and stems as well as foliage of individual plants. It also degrades thatch, gives rise to sunken rings, and acts somewhat like superficial fairy ring. Environment Brown Ring Patch is most destructive when the weather is humid and temperatures are stressful to the grass. Thus, in cool-season grasses such as tall fescue and perennial ryegrass, the disease is most severe under high temperatures (highs above 85 F, lows above 60 F). Conversely, in warm-season grasses such as zoysia, Brown Patch is most severe in humid weather with moderate temperatures (45 - 70 F). This disease is limited to putting greens on golf courses and thrives in temperatures between 77 and 86 °F. Brown Ring Patch can be found on annual bluegrass, creeping bentgrass, and rough bluegrass; it is diagnosed predominately during periods of high humidity or periods of extended leaf wetness. Soil temperatures between 55-60 °F are associated with initial disease development. The disease is more severe on greens which have low nitrogen fertility and often develops first on areas that are dry or have other environmental stresses. Management Most fungicides labeled for control of Rhizoctonia spp. are active against Brown Ring Patch. Research in 2008 demonstrated that 1 pound of nitrogen per 1,000 sq ft (nitrate, ammonium or urea) could reduce disease by 50 percent or more. It is important to note that greens need to be maintained with adequate nitrogen. Cultural skills include reducing thatch aggressively by verticutting and/or aerifying in the spring and fall when the turf is actively growing, and raise the mowing height prior to and during summer stress periods. Verticutting uses a machine to cut straight lines into a lawn. The depth of these lines is variable and a by-product of the slicing action is known as de- thatching. A verticut machine, like the aerator, has several blades attached to a drum. These blades slice the ground producing a proper seed bed, or corn- row, while removing thatch along the way. Following these cultural practices that promote healthy turf will promote turf recovery. Preventive fungicide applications are recommended when soil temperatures are between 55-60 °F. Brown ring patch is not controlled by thiophante-methyl or other benzimidazole fungicides. Fungicides can be applied in a water volume of 2 gal./1,000 sq. ft. and lightly watered in following application. Generally, curative applications are less effective, and repeated applications are often needed for complete control. Curative applications are best made as soon as symptoms are visible. The best treatment is to apply Medallion, polyoxin-D (e.g., Affirm and Endorse), ProStar, one of the QoI fungicides (e.g., Heritage or Insignia), Trinity, Triton Flo, and Torque now and repeat in two to three weeks to limit disease development later in the spring. Unlike yellow patch, brown ring patch can degrade the thatch in infested areas so fungicide applications are typically required to prevent significant damage.

Initially the war started between Catholics and Protestants, although they were all Christians. As the time and the war drew on the conflict became more general involving most of the great powers in Europe.Osnabrück official webpage, Dreißigjähriger Krieg, November 11, 2013 Between May and October 1648 were the peace treaties signed in Osnabrück and Münster. The Peace of Westphalia ended with that the Thirty Years' War and Osnabrück became the city of Peace with many historical artifacts from this time.Osnabrück official webpage, Der Westfälische Friede, November 11, 2013 Tourism and sights Osnabrück's old town offers a lot of tourist attractions, many cafés and restaurants with a romantic atmosphere and most of Osnabrück's historical sights. Following a selected list of Osnabrück's landmarks. Cathedral As the cathedral church of the bishopric Osnabrück the Sankt Peter cathedral has a huge historical impact on the city. The cathedral was first ordained 785 by Bishop Agilfred from Lüttich. But the church had to be rebuilt twice. The second one was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1100. During renovation work from 1218 to 1277 the cathedral got his shape it has until today. The cathedral has two towers. The slimmer one, the northwest tower counts to the most beautiful towers of the Romance time because of his round window line. The other tower was replaced in the 15th century by a bigger late Gothic tower.Altstadt Osnabrück, Sehenswürdigkeiten, November 11,2013 Until today the cathedral is opened every day and the mass is held every morning.Bishopric Osnabrück, Gottesdienste, November 11,2013 Town hall It took over 25 years to finish the town hall which is located in the central of the old town just next to the Marienkirche. The hall is built in typical Late Gothic style with little towers on the corners and eight statues on the front side of the building. The peace treats for the Thirty Years' War were signed here in 1648 that's why 42 portraits are hung up in the peace hall. These portraits show European envoys and monarchs of those times, even paintings that show the French Sun King Louis XIV and Christina, Queen of Sweden. Additionally the town house provides many historical objects, for example paintings of the former prince-bishops, a copy of the peace treats and model that shows how Osnabrück looked in 1633.Osnabrück official webpage, Ort des Westfälischen Friedens, November 11.2013 Marienkriche The church is located just next to the town hall on the market place. In 1543 the church was changed to a Protestant church. From 800 to 850 the church was most likely just used for funerals. In the 13th century to the 15th century the church was extended with to more side aisles and a vault for the choir. But the most impressive is the exterior view. Northern- and southern side are symmetrical designed with four high Gothic windows on each side and four gables. On these gables are statues that are made of sandstone positioned. Between these statues are also gargoyles in the shape of fantasied animals. Moreover, many statues are positioned besides the four big portals.Osnabrück official webpage, Den Blick gen Himmel gelenkt, November 11, 2013 Heger Tor The Heger Tor, also called Waterloo Tor is a part of the town walls and could be described as the entrance to the old town. The gate was rebuilt in 1817, two years after the battle of Waterloo in honor of Osnabrück's soldiers that died in that battle. The money for this gate was donated by Gerhard Friedrich von Güllich and designed by Johann Christian Sieckmann. With its shape the gate looks more like a triumphal arch. For tourists it is possible to get on the top of the gate either by using wall ramps or stairs. Standing on top of the gate allows a lovely view on Osnabrück's medieval old town.Altstadt Osnabrück, Sehenswürdigkeiten, November 11,2013 Events=Maiwoche Maiwoche 2009 May week (German: Maiwoche) is one of the biggest outdoor town center festivals in Germany. Visitors do not need to pay any entrance fee and the festival includes almost the whole old town and parts of the newer city center. The festival took place the first time in 1972 and is held annually and lasts usually for 9 to 11 days. Through the whole town are stages are stands with food and drinks, decoration or jewelry positioned. In 2007 the 600,000 people visitor border was crossed the first time and the number is increasing every year. The stages are mostly used for music acts. Well known bands like Madsen or Casper have performed their songs during the last years. But the festival also provides the opportunity for unknown bands or artists to be discovered.Maiwoche, Maiwoche 2013, November 11, 2013 Christmas market The historical Christmas market has a long tradition in Osnabrück. The market is placed in front of the cathedral and on the market place and lasts approximately four week, starting in the end of November and ending just before Christmas.

It was completed in 1935 as part of a multi-functional development by architect Pavel Janák in the constructivist style. The tall, six-storey minimalist tower and belfry carries a 700 kg copper chalice as a symbol of the Hussite Church. The tower was briefly used to create an alternative radio station during the Prague uprising in 1945. History The Hus Congregational House was built between 1930 and 1935 to architect Pavel Janák's constructivist design in Dykova Street in Prague 10 for a Hussite congregation. The land near the old water works had been purchased in 1925, and the Church commissioned Janák to create a novel design for the church. Janek's first design in 1929 was accepted by the Church elders but rejected by the town planners. The following year's design included an apartment building, a theatre and a six-storey tower. By this time the symbolic foundation stone had been laid but work on the first real building did not start until 1 July 1932. Janek had previous experience of pre-stressed concrete as he had worked on the church in Vršovice, which was built in 1930.MANA Theatre presents, husiti.cz, retrieved 14 November 2013 Fourteen months after this building was started the reinforced-concrete framed church held its first service and the building was delivered under budget.Church of Jan Hus Congregation at Vinohrady, stovezata.praha.eu, retrieved 12 November 2013 The six-storey tower is just under 35 metres high and the top three floors incorporate bells. The design includes spiral staircases for the first three floors, while upper floors have ladders for access. The symbol of the Hussite Church, a copper chalice that weighs 700 kg and stands over two metres tall, was consecrated and installed on top of the tower in June 1933 in the \\"Celebration of the Goblet\\". In 1938 the design was reworked by Jiri Jakub. He converted the space under the church that had been designed as a theatre into a columbarium where funeral urns could be stored.Kohout, M., Slapeta, V., & Templ, S., Prague 20th Century Architecture (Vienna and New York: Springer Verlag, 1999), p. 103. The tower was used between 7 and 9 May 1945 as an impromptu radio tower during the Prague uprising, when it sheltered Czech resistance fighters who were trying to evict the occupying German forces from the city.The Prague Vitruvius, Pragitecture.eu, originally retrieved 12 November 2013 Today This plaque records the role of the church as a radio station during the Prague Uprising. Inside the church is a 2.6-metre tall statue of Christ by Jan Znoj, which is surrounded by earthenware reliefs of the apostles and Czech heroes of the Reformation. The reliefs continue into the foyer, where there is also a statue of Bishop Jan Blahoslav by the sculptor František Bílek. The sculptural decorations are by Jaroslav Horejc. The church building is used for Hussite Church services, but it is also used for language courses, lectures and public exhibitions. The space below the chapel is still used as a columbarium.Anděl, J., The new vision for the new architecture: Czechoslovakia, 1918-1938 (Prague: Slovart Publishing, 2005). The rest of the building still includes clubrooms, a residential building and offices. The minimalist building has been described as \\"Protestant anti-baroque architecture in the extreme, dramatic ... but soulless\\".Prague: A Cultural and Literary History, Richard D. E.

A sophomore at Stanford University, he and four friends traveled to Canada to train as pilots. Choosing to remain in the Royal Air Force, after training, Rogers was assigned to the RAF 32 Squadron in May, 1918. He was credited with six victories while flying the S.E.5a. He earned the following medals: Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC, British), World War I Inter-allied Victory Medal, British War Medal, and Order of Michael the Brave (Romania). He left the Royal Air Force in May 1919 and returned to the United States.A Yankee Ace in the RAF (Modern War Studies), The World War I Letters of Captain Bogart Rogers; Bogart Rogers, Earl Rogers (Editor) / Hardcover / Univ Pr of Kansas 1996 After the war, Rogers began a career in the motion picture industry in his native Los Angeles. He was a screenwriter, technical advisor and also was a producer. By 1933 he had written and produced his first motion picture for Paramount Studios, The Eagle and the Hawk, about two American fliers in France, starring Fredric March, Cary Grant, and Carole Lombard. In 1936 he produced Pigskin Parade, a movie with Judy Garland and Jack Haley about a country farmer who becomes a college football hero. Near the end of the 1930s he invested in a horse-race photo-finish camera, an invention that, to his astonishment, turned out to be so successful that he formed a corporation, Photochart Inc., and became its president. After the United States entered World War II, Bogart's friend Eddie Rickenbacker, president of Eastern Airlines, offered to help him obtain a commission in the Army Air Corps. Years had passed since he held the controls of an airplane...so he chose instead to write about the war in numerous magazine articles and a book about the Flying Tigers. In December 1960 he attended a reunion of World War I pilots in New York. The Air Force Museum captured the event on film. A larger reunion was scheduled for June 1961, but he was unable to attend having suffered a stroke with partial paralysis of his right side. Eventually he recovered. Managing the photo- finish activities for thirty-five horse racing associations as President of Photochart took most of his time. It was during the 1966 horse racing season that he collapsed with a blood clot in his leg at the Hollywood Park racetrack. He was taken to St. Joseph's hospital in Burbank where he died the next day, July 24, one month after his sixty-ninth birthday and forty-eight years since he had fought in the Great War.

Opened in 1929, it is located on Marquam Hill adjacent to Oregon Health & Sciences University, and is connected to Oregon Health & Science University Hospital via a skybridge. The original hospital was replaced in the 1980s and has a capacity of up-to 478 beds. History The University of Oregon Medical School's regents (now Oregon Health & Science University) donated land on Marquam Hill in 1926 to what is now the Department of Veterans Affairs. The property was to be used to construct a veterans hospital, with construction starting in February 1928. Offices opened at the new facility in November 1928, and patients were transferred to the new hospital in December 1928. In 1932, an administration building opened, followed by 13 quonset huts from 1946 to 1948 following World War II. The last addition to the old campus came in 1949 when a 155-bed tuberculosis hospital opened. The Portland VA started working with the adjacent medical school in 1946 on joint programs. The Veterans Administration announced in May 1976 that a new hospital would be built in Portland. A local group formed in 1980 to fight construction, and went to court in 1981 to try to stop the project. A new building was finished in 1981 in order to move some operations away from the planned location of the new hospital building. The suit was eventually dismissed in October 1981 by judge Robert C. Belloni, and in January 1982 the design of the new building was unveiled as construction started. The new building was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership (now ZGF Architects LLP), with W.B. Bateson Co. serving as the general contractor. Construction ended in September 1987 on the main building, and it was dedicated in November 1987. In February 1988, the new $136 million facility opened to patients on Marquam Hill after a 364-day delay in construction, and demolition of the old buildings started in May 1988. When the new facility opened, it had a capacity of 478 beds, but never had staffing to operate at full capacity, and as of 1990 only used 399 beds. The final phase of construction was a $11.7 million, 413-space parking garage built starting in 1990. In 1992, a long pedestrian bridge linking OHSU Hospital and the VA Hospital opened. The $7.4 million bridge is the longest of its type in North America. Due to staffing problems the VA closed its emergency room at night in April 1994. Due to budget cuts, the facility announced 150 layoffs in June 1996. At that time, the hospital's budget was $140 million, which grew to $192 million in 2000. In July 2006, the hospital opened a new $3.7 million, center for hearing disabilities. The Portland VA served 33,000 patients in 2000, 51,000 patients in 2004, which grew to 80,000 in 2012. Details Front of the facility Services at the 277-bed medical center's campus include primary care, radiology, speech and language pathology, social work, prosthetics, rehabilitation, emergency care, a pharmacy, and laboratory services, among others. The acute care medical center is accredited by The Joint Commission, and has approximately 80,000 visitors annually. The main building has nine stories above ground plus a penthouse, and two underground floors. The steel and concrete high-rise building has a total of of space. Overall, the campus has of space.

Although short lived, having pressed and released just one single, the band are recognized as the first rock band to sing in Welsh. Formed in 1967 by five students from the University of Aberystwyth: Maldwyn Pate (vocals), Richard Lloyd (lead guitar), Dafydd Evans (bass guitar), Dave Williams (keyboards) and Geraint Evans (drums). The band took their name (\\"The Hairs\\" in English) from the long- haired fashion that was popular at the time. The band raised £2,000 to support their recording and touring, and played their first gig in the Memorial Hall at Talybont at Easter 1967. The band took their music on the road that year with three tours, including playing at the National Eisteddfod in Bala. In summer 1967 they released their one and only single, Maes B. The band ensured their gigs were well publicised, and as well as distinctive posters and flyers they used billboards to advertise themselves. Despite disbanding in the autumn of that year, their place in Welsh music history was secured and artefacts by the band are now in the possession of the National Library of Wales and the Museum of Wales. Formation In the 1960s music in the Welsh language was still largely influenced by male voice choirs, chapel and traditional Noson Lawen singing. The pop music that did exist in Welsh was generally light acoustic folk music having little in common with the current fashions in Anglo-American pop and rock releases. As social attitudes changed during the 1950s and 1960s the outlook of many younger Welsh speakers also started to change. Following the outcry over the destruction of Welsh speaking villages to build projects such as dam supplying water for cities in England there was an upsurge of support for Welsh issues and the language. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (Welsh Language Society) a protest movement campaigning for legal recognition of Welsh was established. It was also widely realised that the Welsh language culture needed to renew itself in order to make it relevant to younger generations. > Mae eisiau i bobol sgrechian mewn Cymraeg sâl > We need to get people to scream in bad Welsh - Y Blew “Y Blew's aim was to reach the Welsh speakers and non Welsh speakers who wheren't into politics and start a Welsh language scene according to Dafydd Evans one of the founders in an interview in 1986. Maldwyn Pate had tried to start a Welsh language band 'Y Pedwar Cainc' in 1966 with fellow Aberystwyth students but their only performance in Aberafan had not gone down well with an audience surprised to hear amplified instruments. The following year, 1967, Y Blew were formed. Following a successful performance to Aberystwyth students they were invited to play in Talybont by Robat Gruffudd, founder of Y Lolfa publishing house. This too was a success and the band decided to spend the summer on tour. Tours Poster for Y Blew, at Talybont Memorial Hall, Friday, 7 July 1967. Five shillings entry price The band self-promoted three highly successful tours of south Wales, attempting to ensure the most professional organization they could. The first in June, the second in July and the third August–September. At the time it was not possible to hire PA systems or vans - the group having to obtain substantial loans to buy equipment and their own van. The band also paid 'bouncers' rather than the usual practice in Welsh language events of relying on friends or volunteers. Large advertising hoardings were booked and thousands of flyers with the slogan “Mae'r Blew yn dod” (Y Blew are coming) were distributed. The gigs where well attended, often all the young people of a small town or village coming to see the new phenomenon of a band singing in Welsh. Following one gig the band found that messages in lipstick had been written all over their van by enthusiastic female fans. Not having time to compose 25 or so new songs for the tours, the band translated current popular hits: > ”We did covers from Sergeant Pepper translated into Welsh, we even did 'San > Francisco' by Scott McKenzie in Welsh, and some by Cream, that sort of thing > and some of our own, particularly stuff that gave the guitarist Richard > Lloyd a chance. He was a quite a good player, the style at the time was to > stand right up to the amp to get feedback Dafydd Evans. Bala Eisteddfod, 1967 The band's only performance north of Corris was at the 1967 Eisteddfod festival in Bala. The festival site was divided into Maes A (A field), Maes B (B field), Maes C etc. with the young people camping on 'Maes B' where the band set up a performance, bringing the spirit of psychedelia to an otherwise traditional festival. Band split The band performed up until Christmas 1967 before splitting up at the end of the year, the various members going their own ways. Singer Maldwyn Pate going to New York to be a choreographer, guitarist Rick Lloyd eventually became a member of the a cappella group The Flying Pickets who had a Christmas number one hit in 1983 in the UK Singles Chart with their cover of Yazoo's track 'Only You'. Following the end of the Y Blew, it took almost five years for the next Welsh language rock groups to be formed - with Brân and Edward H Dafis in 1972-3. > ’'I think it took time for the penny to drop. The ethos of Welsh speakers > was based on 'Peralau Tâf', 'Y Peldyrau' (acoustic folk bands).. that's the > sort of thing that went at that time Dafydd Evans interviewed in 1986. \\"Maes B\\" single left Y Blew were invited to record a single with Cambrian Records whose usual output was male voice choirs, acoustic folk and traditional music. However, the band were of the opinion that the Cambrian's one-track recording studio would not be suitable. Instead they accepted an offer from Pontardawe based Qualiton as they were able to offer the use of the BBC studio in Swansea. The song on A side of the single \\"Maes B\\" takes its name from the field at the Eisteddfod where the band had played. The lyrics, however, make no direct mention of the event. The lyrics reflect the psychedelic influence of pop songs of the era with lines such as: pam 'na nei di ddod 'da fi i weld y tylwyth teg a chael clywed cloc y dref yn taro tair ar ddeg (why not come with me to see the fairies and hear the town clock strike thirteen) The song \\"Maes B\\" was written the evening prior to the recording by Dave Williams (keyboards) with suggestions from Maldwyn Pate (vocals). Dave Williams’s main interest at the time being Tamla Motown is clearly heard in the drum intro. \\"Maes B\\" and the song on the other side of the record were both recorded in a matter of hours - the band desperate to get to Aberystwyth for two concerts that same evening. The drummer had not heard the song before going into the studio. On the record Maldwyn Pate can be heard to sing 'Snos' rather than 'Nos' (night) but there was no time to re-record a corrected version. The group where hoping for a heavier, more contemporary sound, similar to Cream or \\"Hey Joe\\" by Jimi Hendrix a huge hit at the time. Unfortunately for the band limited technology and number of tracks at the BBC Swansea studio. It is believed that approximately 2,000 singles were pressed. The song received little radio air play, the Welsh language seldom heard on the radio at that time with broadcasting services being almost completely based in London. The single was however played on a panel programme reviewing latest releases on newly launched BBC Radio 1 (Radio 1 started on air in October 1967 a month before 'Maes B' was released). Not surprisingly given the then low status of the Welsh language, the panel were of the opinion that the record was just a strange gimmick. According to Dafydd Evans They sold quite well in south Wales, but we didn't perform in the north so the sales there were less. Side 2 – \\"Beth Sy'n Dod Rhyngom Ni\\" The flip side of the record is \\"Beth Sy'n Dod Rhyngom Ni (what comes between us)\\", the Blew's version of Curtis Mayfield's \\"You Must Believe Me\\". Y Blew had heard the song on The Spencer Davis Group's The Second Album. Mayfield had originally recorded the song with his trio The Impressions, reaching No. 15 in the U.S. Billboard charts in 1964. The song also appeared on the Impression L.P. People Get Ready. The Trwynau Coch (Red Noses) recorded a cover version of \\"Beth Sy'n Dod Rhyngom Ni\\" on their 1980 L.P. Rhedeg Rhag y Torpidos (Run from the Torpedoes) (1980, SAIN-1186M). Tributes and references to \\"Maes B\\" Y Blew received little attention in the years following 1967, the Welsh language music scene largely growing form bands such as Brân and Edward H Davis formed some five years later. In 1986, Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg published a fanzine 'Hanes y Blew' (history of Y Blew) including a transcription of an in- depth interview recorded with Dafydd Evans. The fanzine also included archive press cuttings and photos. It was not until 1987 that a TV documentary about the band appeared on S4C. The programme included clips of Y Blew’s original TV performances and interviews with the members and fans. At the end of the programme the original line up re-record \\"Maes B\\" in a modern studio. Also in 1987 the annual National Eisteddfod festival returned to Bala with a number of radio and magazine articles referring to \\"Maes B\\" and Y Blew. It was decided to name the Eisteddfod's rock music stage and campsite 'Maes-B' in honour of the band.

It is the first map to be drawn by Speed. Today the only copy of the map is found within the Eran Laor maps collection in the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem. Description The map is printed on four sheets as divided to quadrants, with the dimension of each being 957 by 745 millimeters. The map is based on the map of Benito Arias Montano, which in turn is based on the map of Santo Vesconta, while the map of Speed is larger than those other two and includes areas that don't appear on those: Mesopotamia at the Fertile Crescent area, the Arabian Peninsula, the shores of Turkey and of Cyprus island, and the Nile Delta in Egypt. The map also includes historical-biblical details: The story of The Exodus - the Israelites' route out of Egypt with illustrations of miniature figures and events along the route, the formation of the land of Israel with the borders of the Israeli tribes in marking with striated lines, and the story of Jonah and the whale illustrated off shore from the city Ascalon with the whale opening his mouth in order to swallow the prophet Jonah. On the sides of the bottom right and left quadrants appear two tables of references, according to longitude and latitude lines of sites on the map. The map has decorative enframes-cartouches on its sides, with two big cartouches at the top quadrants and two small ones at the bottom quadrants. The big cartouche at the top left shows the biblical Israeli leaders Moses and Aaron placing their hands on Israel's Tablets of the Law with the Ten Commandments inscribed in Hebrew. Above them at the top of the cartouche frame within another frame, appears a caption of the Hebrew word \\"יְהֹוָה\\" - YHWH, the tetragrammaton as the most sacred name of God. The big cartouche at the top right quadrant shows the biblical story of Adam and Eve in Paradise, which is based on Albrecht Dürer's engraving from 1504 under the title Adam and Eve - with small differences between the two. Above them at the top of the cartouche frame within another frame, appears a caption of the Hebrew word \\"אֱלֹהִים\\" - Elohim as the second name of God. The small cartouche at the bottom left quadrant shows a heraldic eagle and an inscription to sir Robert Cotton who encouraged Speed to start drawing maps.

Many extinct species of amphibians and amniotes have extended neural spines growing from their back vertebrae. These are thought to have supported a sail. Paleontologists have proposed a number of ways in which the sail could have functioned in life. Function Crested chameleon, an extant reptile with a sail on its back Varying suggestions have been made for the function of the sail. Thermoregulation The structure may have been used for thermoregulation. The base of the spines have a channel which may have contained a blood vessel supplying abundant blood to the sail. The animal could have used the sail's large surface area to absorb heat from the sun in the morning. As ectotherms they required heat from an external source before their muscles would start to function properly. A predator would thus have an advantage over its slower moving prey. The sail could be used in reverse if the animal was overheating. By standing in the shade, the sail would radiate heat outwards.D.R. Khanna, Biology of Reptiles, pp. 59-60, Discovery Publishing House, 2004 . However, recent studies have put in doubt the efficiency of this purported means of thermoregulation, and indeed no extinct sailed animal is currently assumed to have used its sails for thermoregulation. Sexual selection Elaborate body structures of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract members of the opposite sex during mating. This has been proposed as one potential function of the sail. Food storage The tall neural spines of a bison form a hump rather than a sail. The structure may also have been more hump-like than sail-like, as noted by Stromer in 1915 (\\"one might rather think of the existence of a large hump of fat [German: Fettbuckel], to which the [neural spines] gave internal support\\") and by Jack Bowman Bailey in 1997. In support of his \\"buffalo-back\\" hypothesis, Bailey argued that in Spinosaurus, Ouranosaurus, and other dinosaurs with long neural spines, the spines were relatively shorter and thicker than the spines of pelycosaurs (which were known to have sails); instead, the dinosaurs' neural spines were similar to the neural spines of extinct hump-backed mammals such as Megacerops and Bison latifrons. Camouflage Dimetrodon may have used the sail on its back to help camouflage itself when hiding among reeds and waiting to ambush its prey. Sound display Gregory Paul argued that parallel neck sails of Amargasaurus would have reduced neck flexion. Instead, he proposed that, with their circular rather than flat cross-sections, these spines were more likely covered with a horny sheath. He also suggests that they could have been clattered together for a sound display.Paul, Gregory S. (2000) The Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs, p 94. St. Martin's Press. .

He is known for the hand-crafted aesthetic and high-level design of his single-family homes and large community developments. Callister's most notable projects include the Mill Valley Christian Science Church (1955), the Duncan House (1959) in San Francisco, Rossmoor Leisure World (1963) in Walnut Creek, CA, and the Mills College Chapel (1968).Charles Warren Callister Collection, Environmental Design Archives, University of California, Berkeley.  Early life  Callister was born in Rochester, NY and grew up in New York, Florida, Ohio, and Texas. As a teenager, he studied art at the Witte Museum in San Antonio. He earned a scholarship for college that limited him to schools in Texas, none of which had a fine arts program, so he decided to study architecture, art, and sociology at the University of Texas at Austin.Weinstein, Dave. ″SIGNATURE STYLE / Warren Callister / Listening for architecture / Boldly modern, yet arising from the spirit of the place.″ SF Gate. 6 Mar 2004. He attended the University from 1935-1941 when he was drafted into World War II. He served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers (1941-1955) helping to build the ALCAN Highway in Alaska, and later served as a pilot for the Air Force.Richard Ehrenberger and Charles Sholten, ″Charles Warren Callister, 1917-2008.″ The Architect’s Newspaper. 30 April 2008  Career  Upon returning from the war, Callister, his wife Mary Frances, and their two sons moved to Northern California where he and his former Texas classmate Jack Hillmer (1918-2007) established the architectural practice Hillmer-Callister in San Francisco. Their first project was the Hall House in Kentfield (1947) considered to be the first residential application of post-tensioned concrete slab technology in the United States. Callister and Hillmer were both active in Telesis, an organization of architects, landscape architect's, urban planners and designers who played a significant role in the beginnings of the environmental planning and design movement in the San Francisco Bay Area.Violich Francis. “The Planning Pioneers” California Living, February 26, 1978, pp29-36 Callister went on to establish the firm of Callister, Payne & Rosse in Tiburon, CA in 1950, which would later expand to include an east coast office in Amherst, Massachusetts during the 1960s. John Payne and Martin Rosse worked with Callister designing residences, churches, and communities for which they received many awards including the National Lumberman’s 1965 Wood Structure Design Award. Callister had many design partners over the years, including Jim Bischoff, David Gately, and Michael Heckmann. Callister is well known for incorporating high-level design into large developments and new communities. Rossmoor (1964), a retirement community in Walnut Creek, CA, gained the firm national attention. His numerous sub-division developments for client Otto Paparazzo show a unique understanding of community planning and residential needs. His recognized designs include the Christian Science churches in Belvedere (1953) and Mill Valley (1955), California; the Mills College Chapel (1968) in Oakland; and the UC Santa Cruz Field House (1955). Though he did not receive his architect’s license until 1988, Callister’s design process focused on “creating together appropriate designs that belong to the natural environment and that are rooted in the nature of the clients.”  Style  Callister was considered a leader in the Second Bay Area Tradition, a style of architecture that responded to regional climate, geography, materials, and life-style while also incorporating elements of modern design. Callister described his work as ″trying to reflect the region I'm in.″ His design process began by walking the site and listening, a technique he learned from photographer Minor White. ″You leave yourself open and it all starts flooding in. You’re listening for more than superficial things. The most powerful things come in when you listen. You have to find the architecture, you don’t come to it preconceived.″ Callister's work was heavily influenced by Japanese architecture. During a trip to Asia in 1966, he was impressed by the ″art of doing,″ emphasizing the process of creation rather than the product itself. This is evident in his use of natural materials and expressive wood joinery, reminiscent of Arts & Crafts architects Greene and Greene. The Flowers Residence in Berkeley is such an example.  Legacy  Callister was an active researcher and educator throughout his career. During the 1960s he lectured at Stanford University, Syracuse University, Columbia University, University of Colorado, and University of British Columbia. He was the recipient of the Award of Excellence, Urban Land Institute, 1982 and the prestigious Award of Honor, San Francisco Art Commission, 1983.Vigor, Emily.

At completion in 2019, the structure building became the third-tallest building in Calgary behind Brookfield Place East and The Bow. As of July 2020, Telus Sky is the 18th tallest building in Canada, though several buildings in Toronto exceeding its height are under construction including The One. Telus Sky incorporates of mixed-use area available. There is a total of of office space within the structure, of which is leased by the named-tenant Telus Communications, Canadian telecommunications company that is a subsidiary of Telus Corporation. History On July 4, 2013, the Telus Corporation announced the development of the $400-million ($-million in ) Telus Sky, designed by the architectural firms Bjarke Ingels Group and Dialog, which promised to provide a new architectural landmark to Calgary's Downtown to be completed in 2017. The announcement included plans for a mixed-use tower to incorporate office, retail and residential space. Of which there was to be 26 floors totaling of office space with Telus reserving . Telus Sky would also host 341 residential units on the upper 32 floors and of retail space, mostly on the second floor connected to the City's Plus 15 pedway system. The design included LEED Platinum status and a number of sustainable design features including a storm water management system, and a public gallery. The building was designed with a clean rectangular base and bottom floors for efficient open-office layouts, and as the building rises, the floor plates slowly reduce in size and pixilate creating small balconies and terraces. Prior the construction of Telus Sky, the corner of 7 Avenue & Centre St SW was home to a three-storey building constructed in 1928 and hosted Art Central, a place where local artists could create and showcase their talent in small galleries and studios. The building was demolished in November 2014. Construction on Telus Sky started in February 2015. Due to the small footprint of the site, there was not enough room for traditional excavators or ramps to facilitate digging the base, instead a hydraulic crane using a clam-shell bucket was used to excavate the of dirt to a depth of up to to create the base of the building. Construction of the Telus Sky continued past the original completion date of 2017, with delays causing construction to continue into 2019. The first commercial tenants were scheduled to move in July 2019 and the residential rental suites received bookings for September 2019. Public Art Telus Sky's northern and southern facades are cladded in a dynamic LED display dubbed \\"Northern Lights\\", designed by Canadian artist Douglas Coupland, which is one of the largest public art fixtures in Canada. The LED light strips that make up the art piece are equipped with an infinite number of colour shades and combinations. The Northern Lights display will go through five 12-minute sequences per hour. With the starting sequence always being a mimic of the world famous aurora borealis, and the remaining four sequences to be interchangeable. The public art features an interactive smartphone app that will give users information about what inspired the current pattern at any given sequence, and will be online from sunrise to sunset, 365 days a year. The Northern Lights display first went live on April 19, 2019. Building details The developers of Telus Sky are striving to achieve LEED Platinum certification for the office, retail, and art spaces of the building, with the residential levels being targeted for LEED Gold. This will make Telus Sky the most environmentally sustainable building in Canada over 200 meters in height. *Square footage of: **The entire building: **The office space: on 29 floors **The residential space: on floors 30-58 **The retail space: located mainly on the ground level **Total leased space: **Art space: **Number of storeys: 60 **Listing Agency: Colliers International Tenants Following the collapse in oil prices in 2015, the Calgary real-estate market began to suffer from growing vacant downtown office space, which Telus Sky has not been immune.

A pledge event took place at the Houses of Parliament in October 2013, giving MPs an opportunity to sign up. In 2011, TTC launched a four-week television advertising campaign to promote its new slogan: \\"It's time to talk. It's Time to Change.\\" The campaign has been fronted by a number of celebrities, including political strategist Alastair Campbell, presenter Davina McCall, singer Frankie Sandford, and boxer Ricky Hatton. In 2014, the campaign supported the \\"Laughing for a Change\\" project run by actress Janice Connolly, which aimed to promote awareness of mental health through a stand-up comedy tour. Outcomes An academic study was carried out to measure whether TTC had met their 5 per cent target in the first 12 months. Though the participation in the telephone surveys was very low, they measured \\"progress toward meeting TTC's target of a 5 per cent reduction in discrimination\\". An independent evaluation of the campaign's first four years took place in 2013. Though it found a reduction in discrimination from friends and families, change in attitudes from health professionals was negligible. Wales In Wales the campaign was launched in 2012 under the name Time to Change Wales, led by Welsh mental health charities MIND Cymru, Gofal and Hafal.

It lists, in no particular order, a series of rules and regulations on how to manage the lands, animals, justice, and overall administration of the king's property and assets. The document was meant to lay out the instructions and criteria for managing Charlemagne's estates and was thus, an important part of his reform of Carolingian government and administration.  Historical context  Capitulare de villis vel curtis imperii LXX The Capitulare de villis is one of several capitularies issued by Carolingian royalty to address the organization and administration of their estates. This document is significant with regards to understanding Carolingian culture, administrative, and social-reform programs. Capitulare de villis along with 254 other manuscripts at the Herzog August Library in Germany are the only surviving administrative documents from Charlemagne's reign discussing detailed estate management and revenue collection. The capitulary is of disputed origin and was \\"variously claimed for Fulda or the Rhineland ... containing a group of texts associated with the royal court\\". There were also disputes regarding its publication date and under what circumstances the document was created. The general consensus is that the Capitulare de villis dates back to sometime between the years 771 and 800. This document was developed in a time of change and transition. As the Carolingian court became a stationary body at a palace, the document was likely created in an effort to manage the logistical difficulties of supplying and maintaining the food and equipment for an administration at some distance from its estates, thereby ensuring that politicians and soldiers would be well provisioned. The amount of detail included in the Capitulare de villis speaks to the king's attention to government and the simplified form of administration at the time. Thus, although the Capitulare de villis is no longer used as a tool to understand the entire economic and social structure of the Carolingian world, it remains an important document for understanding Carolingian material culture and political administration.  Content  The Capitulare de villis is not arranged in any logical order but instead jumps between different topics throughout the course of the document's seventy chapters. Topics were not treated equally by the author as some are longer and go into more detail than others. The text is much more specific in regard to crops and animals and tends to become more vague in regard to everyday care of livestock such as chickens and other less prevalent material.  Duties and administration  The majority of the Capitulare de villis is given over to describing the duties of the iudex, \\"an official tasked with the care of royal properties or the duties of their subordinates\\". It is mandated that \\"each steward shall perform his service in full, according to his instructions\\". The document includes many duties including warning officials against corruption, protection of the properties from being stolen, fairly prosecuting criminals, and presenting the king with certain items once annually. The most important duty described in this document, however, was creating an accurate inventory and facilitating the transportation of an estate's food, money, and goods to the Carolingian court. As a whole, the document \\"lays administrative groundwork for the court to effectively manage royal properties and secure income for the palace from a distance\\". In terms of administering royal properties, the description of which takes up a sizable amount of space in the Capitulare de villis, the text outlines supplying various estate buildings and properties and caring for livestock but is noticeably less specific when it came to details in agricultural production, simply stating quotas for some crops rather than methods of growing them.  Justice  The capitulary makes several mentions of how justice is to be handled on the king's estates in his absence and gives responsibility to the iudices to uphold the law. The text states that \\"[a]s far as concerns other men, let the stewards be careful to give them the justice to which they have a right, as the law directs\\". This demonstrates that the iudex was not only a servant to the king in terms of administering his properties but also was the king's representative of sorts when it came to dispensing justice if need be.  Animals  Care of farm animals such as chickens and cows is stipulated in the Capitulare de villis but the text does not go into much more detail. Much attention is given to the care of puppies and horses to perhaps highlight the importance of these animals to the king in hunting and warfare.  Land and food  Land use is outlined for the stewards, stating that fish ponds, byres, pigsties, sheepfolds, goat-pens, mills, and barns should all be included in the property. The amount of land that should be protected as forest space and the amount that should be cleared is also stipulated. The capitulary also gives some indication of a system of villae on royal estates kept ready and fully equipped to receive the king. and is designed to guarantee that certain basic necessities were to be found in each of the residences. Thus, the document is necessary to ensure that the estate was prepared at any given time for the king's use and that the land use suited his needs. In terms of food, less instruction is given in terms of how and where to grow them but the iudex is tasked with ensuring both quantity and quality. Special attention is paid to wine, especially how it should be made and stored. In case of excess production, the \\"[p]rovision is made for the sale of fish and other goods that are not used because the king did not visit\\".  Craftsmen and tools  The capitulary played a role in craftsmanship on the estates, mandating that a certain number of workers of different trades, from blacksmiths to weavers, work on the estate at all times. The Capitulare de villis also refers to providing certain materials for trade, particularly mentioning certain lands that were part of the estate where iron ore could be found and thereby supply blacksmiths with the raw materials for their trade. Workplaces were also mentioned in the document. Facilities where women worked with textiles was mentioned demonstrating a link between the document and the administration of trade.  Historical significance = Military  The Capitulare de villis played a role in preparing the king's estates to aid him in the event of military conflict by supplying provisions and materials. Particular reference is made to carts and produce for the army. Ultimately \\"[t]hese military provisions of the CV were geared towards logistical preparations for campaigns\\". Horses and horse breeding were also an important part of these efforts. In order to properly prepare an army for combat, Charlemagne needed war horses as colts on his estates. Special attention was devoted in the capitulary to how horses should be cared for including how they should be bred. Horses were specifically mentioned as items of value that should be included in the annual inventories of the estates. While the capitulary does not explicitly link horse care and breeding with military action, the fact that provisions for the army are mentioned elsewhere coupled with the care and attention that the text pays to horses, and colts in particular, suggests that there was a certain military focus being considered. Overall, the Capitulare de villis can shed some light on the type of preparations made for military conflict in this period and the pre-emptive consideration that the king put into such endeavours.  Women  A certain amount of historical evidence regarding the role of women can also be discerned from the Capitulare de villis. Where the text delves into the management of the king's estates, it reveals that his queen would also be expected to take part in these duties. While the document illustrates that the king already had male stewards taking responsibility for much of the managerial upkeep of the estates, it also mentions that the queen has overlapping duties and overarching authority over the operation as a whole including the stewards themselves and could direct their work as she saw fit. Overall, it may be possible to employ what is known about the queen's role from this capitulary in order to gain a better understanding of elite women at this time and the responsibilities they had with regard to family estates. Considering the position of women and their responsibilities when it came to hospitality in particular may give insight into the ways in which aristocratic women likely controlled or helped to manage the estates. When the capitulary mentions the number of beds and linens among other essentials to be kept on hand, these would have been items that women were especially concerned with due to their role in ensuring the comfort of guests in their home. Furthermore, the Capitulare de villis makes note of the fact that, when the queen sent orders to a steward or any other official on the estate through the butler or seneschal, those orders were meant to be obeyed and the \\"authority of the queen to give such orders, especially through these two officers, probably derived from her responsibility for the provision of hospitality; her interests extended both to entertaining guests while appropriately displaying the wealth of the family and to providing meat for gathering aristocrats\\". Beyond the role of hospitality, the queen also needed to replace the role of the iudex when he was away on business for the king. This extended to ruling on punishment of criminal activity or insubordination on the estate. The text specifies that, in the case of an order by the iudex or those above him not being carried out by his subordinates, the queen had the power to determine a penalty.  Controversy  The reasons for the creation of the Capitulare de villis are still being debated centuries after its authorship. Some studies of the document have attempted to use particular words and phrases to tie the text to a particular region or person. One study from 1912 attempted to argue that the document was written by Louis the Pious \\"during his programme of estate reform in Aquitaine in 794, based in particular on its mention of certain plants that grew only in the milder climate of southern France\\". Another proposed that, due to Charlemagne's tradition of taking action in the form of pen on paper in response to concrete situations, the text might have been created in response to the famine of 792-3. Other reasons that have been put forward for the creation of the Capitulare de villis include an attempt to \\"improve administration in the kingdom and to end the abuses of the royal treasury and of the king's residences throughout his vast realm\\" or, conversely, to provide a supply of provisions for the Carolingian army. No single answer has gained the full support of the academic world.  References =Additional source * Verhulst, Adriaan E. The Carolingian Economy. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002.

The radiative properties of the ocean surface are exploited in order to estimate the salinity of the water's surface layer. The depth of the water column that a satellite surface salinity measurement is sensitive to depends on the frequency (or wavelength) of the radiance that is being measured. For instance, the optical depth for seawater at the 1.413 GHz microwave frequency, used for the Aquarius mission, is about 1–2 cm.  Background  As with many passive remote sensing satellite products, satellites measure surface salinity by initially taking radiance measurements emitted by the earth’s atmosphere and ocean. If the object emitting the measured radiance is considered to be a black body, then the relationship between the object’s temperature and the measured radiance can be related, at a given frequency, through the Planck function (or Planck's law). ::I_ u = \\\\frac{2 h u^{3}}{c^2}\\\\frac{1}{e^{\\\\frac{h u}{kT}}-1} where I_ u (the Intensity or Brightness) is the amount of energy emitted per unit surface per unit time per unit solid angle and in the frequency range between u and u + d u; T is the temperature of the black body; h is Planck's constant; u is frequency; c is the speed of light; and k is Boltzmann's constant. This equation can be rewritten to express the temperature, T, in terms of the measured radiance at a particular frequency. The temperature derived from the Planck function is referred to as the brightness temperature (which see, for derivation). For ideal black bodies, the brightness temperature is also the directly measurable temperature. For objects in nature, often called Gray Bodies, the actual temperature is only a fraction of the brightness temperature. The fraction of brightness temperature to actual temperature is defined as the emissivity. The relationship between brightness temperature and temperature can be written as: T_b = e T where Tb is the brightness temperature, e is the emissivity, and T is the temperature of the surface sea water. The emissivity describes the ability of an object to emit energy by radiation. Several factors can affect the emissivity of water, including temperature, emission angle, wavelength, and chemical composition. The emissivity of sea water has been modeled as a function of its temperature, salinity, and radiant energy frequency.  Measurement technique  Studies have shown that measurements of seawater brightness temperature at the 1.413 GHz (L-band) are sufficient to make reasonably accurate measurements of seawater surface salinity. The emissivity of seawater can be described in terms of its polarized components of emissivity as: e_H = 1 - \\\\left [ \\\\frac{\\\\cos \\\\theta - ( \\\\epsilon - \\\\sin ^2 \\\\theta )^{ \\\\frac{1}{2}}}{ \\\\cos \\\\theta + ( \\\\epsilon - \\\\sin ^2 \\\\theta )^{ \\\\frac{1}{2}}} \\\\right]^2 e_V = 1 - \\\\left [ \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon \\\\cos \\\\theta - ( \\\\epsilon - \\\\sin ^2 \\\\theta )^{ \\\\frac{1}{2}}}{ \\\\epsilon \\\\cos \\\\theta + ( \\\\epsilon - \\\\sin ^2 \\\\theta )^{ \\\\frac{1}{2}}} \\\\right]^2 The above equations are governed by the Fresnel equations, the instrument viewing angle from nadir θ, and the dielectric coefficient ε. Microwave radiometers can be further equipped to measure the vertical and horizontal components of the surface seawater's brightness temperature, which relates to the horizontal and vertical components of the emissivity as: T_{bH} = e_H T T_{bV} = e_V T, where T_b refers to the brightness temperature and T is simply the temperature of the surface seawater. Since the viewing angle from nadir is typically set by the remote sensing instrument, measurements of the polarized components of the brightness temperature can be related to the surface seawater's temperature and dielectric coefficient. Several models have been proposed to estimate the dielectric constant of sea water given its salinity and temperature. The “Klein and Swift” dielectric model function is a common and well-tested model used to compute the dielectric coefficient of seawater at a given salinity, temperature, and frequency. The Klein and Swift model is based on the Debye equation and fitted with laboratory measurements of the dielectric coefficient. Using this model, if the temperature of the seawater is known from external sources, then measurements of the brightness temperature can be used to compute the salinity of surface seawater directly. Figure 1 shows an example of the brightness temperature curves associated with sea surface salinity, as a function of sea surface temperature. When looking at the polarized components of the brightness temperature, the spread of the brightness temperature curves will be different depending on the component. The vertical component of the brightness temperature shows a greater spread in constant salinity curves than the horizontal component. This implies a greater sensitivity to salinity in the vertical component of brightness temperature than in the horizontal.  Sources of measurement error  There are many sources of error associated with measurements of sea surface salinity: * Radiometer * Antenna * System pointing * Roughness (of sea surface) * Solar * Galactic * Rain (total liquid water) * Ionosphere * Atmosphere(other) * Sea surface temperature * Antenna gain near land and ice * Model function Most of the error sources on the previous list stem from either standard instrument errors (Antenna, System Pointing, etc.) or noise from external sources measurement signal (Solar, Galactic, etc.). However, the largest error source comes from the effect of ocean surface roughness. A rough ocean surface tends to cause an increase in the measured brightness temperature as a result of multiple scattering and shadowing effects. Quantifying the influence of ocean roughness to the measured temperature brightness is crucial to make an accurate measurement. Some instruments use radar scatterometers to measure the surface roughness to account for this source of error.

He was one of the leading educators of his time, and an influential scholar among monks and laity throughout not only the Carolingian empire but also the Western European monastic community. His best known surviving work is his biography of Saint Gallus, the founder of Reichenau's sister monastery, St Gall. Wetti is best known for the visions of heaven and hell he had shortly before his death in about November 4, 824, which were recorded in Latin (Visio Wettini) by Heito, former abbot of Reichenau, in 824 and by Wetti's disciple Walahfrid Strabo in 827. Walahfrid's version, in verse, reveals far more about Wetti's visions than Heito's does, leveling more detailed accusations of greed and sexual misconduct against monks, government and church officials – cautiously edited or omitted by Heito – even acrostically naming Charlemagne when he appears in purgatory. An example of dream literature, the Vision of Wetti reflects Carolingian afterlife conceptions of punishment and salvation; it was widely read throughout contemporary monastic communities and is generally considered one of the influences on Dante's Divine Comedy. Early life and monastic career Island of Reichenau Wetti was born in the 780s to a noble family. He was educated in both the classical tradition of the seven liberal arts Pollard, R. (trans). Walahfrid Strabo. Visio Wettini. l. 176-7 and Irish monasticism at the Benedictine abbey of Reichenau, founded in 724 by the Irish monk Pirmin. He was apparently an \\"innocent boy\\" and a rebellious teenager before he settled down to teach at Reichenau's convent school.Pollard, R. (trans). Walahfrid Strabo. Visio Wettinil. 690-2 Wetti officiated as master of the Reichenau monastery school for at least twenty years, training generations of monastic students; by all accounts, his students saw him as the ideal of monastic piety.Borst (1996), p. 220 Wetti's peers, furthermore, recognized him as Reichenau's \\"outstanding intellectual\\", which is \\"all the more impressive because [the eighth and ninth centuries were] Reichenau's golden age as a center of learning\\", a time in which Wetti, his reputation, authority, and opinions would have \\"had the power to lead (or mislead) not only his students but all of the monks.\\"Kay (2011), p. 298 Wetti also produced several written works, the best known of those that survive being his biography of Saint Gall, the founder of Reichenau's sister monastery, St Gall. Life of Saint Gall is divided into two books. The first book, dated to the early ninth century, briefly describes him as a studious, pious child, who in all likelihood \\"had been 'commended' to Columbanus at his parent's instigation\\" – commended in this sense denotes that Gall would have been entrusted to Columbanus, and does not suggest that he underwent the oblation rituals which became more common in the early ninth century.De Jong (1996), pp. 193–5 The second book is dated to the early 820s and was later redrafted by Walahfrid Strabo. It provides a more detailed account of the saint's work in establishing the monastery of St Gall, his later life, death, and the miracles around his grave until the end of the eighth century.Borst (1996), p. 21 While these biographies are the best known of Wetti's surviving work, he might have produced a larger body of work, although evidence to substantiate this is lacking. The Vision of Wetti In late October 824 Wetti drank a potion – supposedly medicinal – and became violently ill, suffering \\"terrible pains, vomiting up undigested food, and balking at being fed ...\\"Pollard, R. (trans). Walahfrid Strabo. Visio Wettini. l. 191–4 On the third day, still unwell, Wetti had his bed moved to a private chamber. Under vigil of some of his brothers, he soon drifted off and his first vision began. He dreamed that a demon dressed as a cleric entered the chamber, bringing torture instruments to punish him for his sins.Pollard, R. (trans). Walahfrid Strabo. Visio Wettini. l. 208–26 Before it began to torment him a swarm of demons pushed their way into the room, but they were turned away by the monks and an angel peculiarly dressed in purple robes. On awaking Wetti told his dream to the other monks and asked them to read aloud passages from Gregory's Dialogues regarding the afterlife, something which may have influenced the next vision.Zaleski (1987), p. 86 Shortly afterwards Wetti was again asleep. The same angel, this time in white, entered the room and led him through to purgatory, where Wetti was made to witness sinners suffering contrapasso punishments. He was first shown the fate of those guilty of sexual misconduct. He saw priests and their concubines bound to stakes, standing hip-deep in a river of fire, their genitals being flogged every third day.Heito. Visio Wettini. c. 6 Next he was made to observe the punishments for lay and ecclesiastical officials who lusted for wealth and prestige, officials who did not heed others' prayers, who neglected those in need, those who were indulgent, guilty of concealing wealth, adultery, concubinage and sodomy.Heito. Visio Wettini. c. 7–14 Wetti was most terrified to see emperor Charlemagne, bound and completely unharmed, except for an animal tearing at his genitals. His shock came from the idea that Charlemagne was a pious, good- natured Christian king, but the angel revealed that all Charlemagne's good deeds had been negated by the lust and debauchery which dominated his later life. Yet he would eventually be forgiven because of his actions on behalf of Christianity.Pollard, R. (trans). Walahfrid Strabo. Visio Wettini. l. 460–74 Wetti is then led to heaven, where the angel asks a group of priests to petition Christ for Wetti's salvation. It is revealed that Wetti will die the following day and that he will ultimately be doomed to punishment because he had apparently become \\"smothered with laziness ... [and] shunned his duty\\" as a responsible educator, and had also perhaps corrupted his students in lurid ways.Pollard, R. (trans). Walahfrid Strabo. Visio Wettini. l. 179–81 Christ tells Wetti that by doing so he had not only implicated himself but also misled and corrupted others – thus being responsible for their punishment. Through a group of priests and virgins God informs Wetti that he could still be forgiven providing he corrects those he had led astray.Heito. Visio Wettini. c. 17 Wetti is also enjoined to expose those guilty of adultery, sodomy, greed or neglect, to reform his own actions and to deliver a message of reform and austerity, such as drinking only water, wearing only functional clothing, pursuing humble study, holy poverty, and saintly self- sacrifice.Heito. Visio Wettini. c. 19–24 Although Wetti initially refuses this task, pleading his humility and unworthiness, on waking he immediately relays his dream to the monks. He also demands that his superiors Heito, Tatto, Theganmar and Erlebald be summoned, so that his vision could be recorded and remembered as a warning. After dictating his visions, which were recorded on wax tablets and later rewritten by Heito, Wetti spent his last day in prayer and study with Walahfrid Strabo. On November 4, 824 Wetti died, in much the same way as he described St Gall's death only a few years earlier – in prayer, surrounded by monks, friends and students. Themes Wetti's visions are inscribed in the genre of dream literature, which was largely practised during the 9th century.Dutton (1994), 45 These accounts of alleged visions or dreams follow a typical structure in which visionaries, after falling asleep, are led by angelic guides through other worlds, where they are made to witness sinners' punishments. The similarity among these visions probably arises from common cultural experiences, such as Gregory the Great's teaching that afterlife visions were for the benefit of the living, who should work to redeem their sins and eradicate the social structures in which sin was able to proliferate.Dutton (1994), 65Kay (2011), 304Roper (1999), 19) The Visio Wettini gained wide acclaim and served as a foundation of Dante's Divine Comedy. Wetti's visions provide detailed descriptions of Frankish perceptions of the afterlife, its appearance, and the punishments reserved for sinners. Furthermore, what explicitly appears in Wetti's visions not only reveals a great deal about his perspectives on wealth, lust, gender relations and monastic responsibility, but also the degree to which these issues (excluding monasticism) pervaded all levels of lay and religious officialdom in 9th- century Carolingian France.Pollard, R. \\"Nonatola and Reichenau: A New Manuscript of Heito's Visio Wettini and the Foundations for a New Critical Addition\\". Revue Bénédictine, Volume 1, No. 2, 2010. p. 46Dutton (1994), p. 65Kay (2011), p. 304 Clearly, he saw these as something debasing and degrading Frankish society, however, it is also clear that because of his monastic training in humility, he felt all but unable to speak out against them. There are differences between Heito's Visio Wettini and Walahfrid Strabo's 827 revision and transcription into verse. Whereas Heito deliberately dropped the names of the counts, priests and monks that the angel named as sinners, Walahfrid includes them, most importantly identifying Charlemagne as he suffers purgation. In so doing, Walahfrid obviously intended to answer Wetti's call which may otherwise have fallen on deaf ears, of identifying and condemning materialistic and sexual excesses in the Frankish political and religious hierarchies, something Heito, through omission and editing, was apparently unprepared to do.Dutton (1994), p. 66 Beyond popularity, Walahfrid's poem helped to greatly advance his career,Dutton (1994), p. 45 helping secure his place as tutor to Charles the Bald. Carol Zaleski explains that Walahfrid insisted that, \\"far from seeking advancement, he was 'forced to break [the silence] and impelled, as if by a goad, to keep on writing.'\\"Zaleski (1987), p. 81 Manuscripts Sixty copies of Heito's Visio Wettini survive today; the number suggests that the work was well received and comparatively more popular than Walahfrid's version, of which only seven copies survive. In the commentary to his 1974 English translation of Walahfrid's poem David Traill writes that the seven extant manuscripts are well preserved, with very few places in which reading becomes unclear. The relationship between these manuscripts, however, is uncertain, and has not yet been conclusively determined. In any case, none of them appear to be derived from any others, and generally fall into two main families: GD and ROM.Traill (1974), pp. 19–20 Ernst Dümmler's 1884 editions of Heito and Walahfrid's Visio Wettini have been digitally recorded, and are publicly accessible on the Monumenta Germaniae Historica website.

Otten (June 21, 1889 – March 26, 1978) was a landscape architect who worked primarily in the U.S. state of Oregon. Born and raised in Oregon, he served in World War I before later working for the Oregon State Highway Department where he worked on projects such as the design of the Oregon State Capitol's mall. Early life He was born in Portland, Oregon, where his father was a landscape gardener and florist. In 1911, Otten graduated from the University of Oregon and moved to New York to work for Ferruccio Vitale. Vitale's composition was often characterized by unifying lines, colors, and textures in an intimate, secluded landscape. In 1915, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. approached Vitale with a plan to encourage landscape architects in the United States to study in Europe. At about the same time, Vitale formed a partnership, Vitale and Fowler, with a former apprentice. But Otten did not remain with Vitale's new firm. Graduating with a master's degree from Columbia University in 1915, Otten served in the United States Army during World War I and studied at the University of Montpellier in 1919. He then returned to Portland and continued his work in landscape architecture. Career Otten served as the landscape engineer for the Oregon State Highway Department from 1935 to 1942, and during that time he completed the landscape plan for the Oregon State Capitol mall. Other projects included Portland's Swan Island Airport, White Shield Home, the site location for Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood, Temple Beth Israel in Portland, Canyon Road's entrance into Portland, and the Columbia River Highway's (now Interstate 84) new alignment through the Columbia River Gorge. He also designed the landscaping on a variety of private homes including Aaron Frank, Harry Grelin, A. E. Otis, and Carl G. Washburne. Otten also was involved with designs at several golf courses such as Alderwood Country Club, Ralph Lloyd's Golf Course (replaced by the Banfield Freeway), and the Rose City Golf Course in Portland. Otten died on March 26, 1978, at the age of 88 in Beaverton, Oregon, at a retirement home.

Construction  The preassembled fireplace unit is made up of two main components: the outer housing, and the flue system.  Outer housing  The outer housing is the part of the fireplace unit that is installed in the framing of the building. Two of the main operational components are housed inside of it. The first key component within the outer housing is the firebox, which is surrounded on three sides by the outer housing, and on one side by the glass panel that faces in towards the room. This is the space in which the fire burns during operation. Because of this, the gas burners (either natural gas or propane) are located inside of the firebox. To provide a more realistic look, imitation logs and ember material are placed on top of the burners. The ember material, which will not burn, is designed so that it will glow like real embers when heated. The firebox is designed to be smaller than the outer housing so that there is an empty space between the outermost walls of outer housing and the outer walls of the firebox. The empty space in between the firebox and the outer housing is the second important operational component of the outer housing. This space is filled with air from the interior of the room being heated and is used to add hot air to the room without the addition of exhaust gasses from combustion.  Flue system  The flue system is composed of two flues, the inner flue and the outer flue. The outer flue draws air into the bottom of the sealed firebox to allow for combustion. The inner flue draws hot exhaust gasses from the top of the sealed firebox and vents them directly to the outside of the structure through either an adjacent wall or the roof.  Operation  To begin the operation of the fireplace unit, the user must turn on the gas supply and ignite the burners. Once this is done, the unit will operate completely autonomously until the gas supply to the burners is shut off. While in operation, convection will cause the hot air in the firebox to rise to the top of the firebox. As the amount of hot exhaust gasses increases from the combustion process, the hot gas at the top of the firebox is eventually pushed out through the inner flue. At the same time, the removal of the exhaust gasses through the inner flue allows for relatively cold air to be drawn into the firebox through the outer flue. As the firebox heats up due to the operation of the burners, it radiates heat into the room through the porous glass face that separates the firebox from the inside of the room. At the same time, it transfers heat through the surrounding metal walls into the empty space in between itself and the outer housing. This heat transfer creates a convection process inside of the empty space that is very similar to the one that takes place inside of the firebox. Built into the design of the room facing side of the unit are two vents, one at the top and one at the bottom. Once the air in the empty space begins to heat up, convection pushes this heated air further up in the chamber until it is eventually pushed out through the top vent. This phenomenon works in the same way to draw air in through the bottom vent. As the hot air is pushed out, space is emptied in the chamber behind the firebox, which then draws cold air in through the bottom vent. Both of these convection processes immediately begin to slow down, and eventually stop, as soon as the burners turn off.  Efficiency  Direct vent fireplaces are extremely efficient compared to a traditional fireplace and can operate at about 85% efficiency. Even a very efficient traditional fireplace only operates at about 15% efficiency. This is because most of the hot air generated by the fire travels up the chimney due to convection. A traditional fireplace can also draw hot air in from the room and expel it through the chimney, further lowering the efficiency. The design of the direct vent fireplace allows for such a high level of efficiency because of the sealed firebox. The sealed firebox only allows combustion gasses to leave the system and exit the building. Since it is sealed, no warm air from the room is able to be drawn into the firebox and expelled out of the building.  Indoor air quality  Direct vent fireplaces operate off of propane or natural gas, and are completely sealed from the interior of the building in which they are installed. Thus, no harmful byproducts are released into the room. They also release much less pollution into the atmosphere than a wood-burning fireplace.

It is based on the popular 1979 tabletop game of the same name, which was created by Jim and Tom Trunzo. Old Time Prize Fighter History \\"There really wasn't a decent representation of our favourite sport, pro boxing,\\" Jim Trunzo recalls of the decision he and his brother made in the late 1970s to create a game in which players flipped cards to simulate a fight, rather than use the dice or spinners that were prevalent in sports simulations of that era.http://tbcb.pisd.co.uk/cgi-bin/page?game_history The Trunzos self-published the game, with help from Jim Barnes, who had founded the Statis-Pro line of sports simulation games. Barnes had developed what he called a \\"Fast Action Deck\\" to simulate the action and had given the Trunzo brothers his blessing to use the same concept in their game. After the self- published version of Title Bout Championship Boxing barely made its money back, the Trunzos secured a deal with Avalon Hil, which had purchased Statis- Pro and wanted to compete with APBA and Strat-o-matic in the sports simulation space. Avalon Hill had also arranged a marketing partnership with Sports Illustrated to boost its credibility. Title Bout: The Game of Professional Boxing sold well but was eventually discontinued as gamers moved away from tabletop sports games to computer ones. The Trunzo brothers did not retain the name of their game, but they had the rights to the rest of it and released TKO Boxing for DOS through Lance Haffner Games in 1990. They later published another tabletop game, APBA Boxing, that used dice, and in 2001 Comp-U-Sport brought the game back to the digital realm with Title Fight 2001. The Trunzos eventually sold the game to OOTP Developments, publishers of Out of the Park Baseball and Franchise Hockey Manager. OOTP released Title Bout Championship Boxing 2 in 2005 and version 2.5 in 2008. In 2013, OOTP sold the game to P.I.S.D. Ltd, which released Title Bout Championship Boxing 2013 in June of that year.http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ID=21990  Gameplay  Title Bout Championship Boxing displays a boxing ring with fighters who trade blows, an immersive blow-by-blow text, a crowd that cheers, and ring card girls who flash up between rounds. The game features over 6,660 boxers past and present and in every weight class, allowing players to not only recreate historical fights but also stage bouts that could never have happened, such as Muhammad Ali taking on Mike Tyson in the prime of their careers, Floyd Mayweather battling the legendary Joe Gans, or Sam Langford trading punches with Marvin Hagler. The game's database is updated on a regular basis, allowing players to also forecast upcoming fights. Acting as promoter you stage fights between all the leading contenders, no exceptions. Bouts can be simulated once or multiple times, allowing the player to discard outlier events and see how a fight will likely unfold. Players can also set up tournaments and peruse statistics that are tracked fight-by-fight as well as round-by-round, allowing them to see, for example, how many knock-outs have happened in a specific round. Win-loss records can be imported or they can start from 0–0 so all boxers in the game build unique histories. Title Bout Championship Boxing also has many customisation options, including the ability to import boxer images and add new fighters to the game.

OWCs have shown promise as a renewable energy source with low environmental impact. Because of this, multiple companies have been working to design increasingly efficient OWC models. OWC are devices with a semi-submerged chamber or hollow open to the sea below, keeping a trapped air pocket above a water column. Waves force the column to act like a piston, moving up and down, forcing the air out of the chamber and back into it. This continuous movement force a bidirectional stream of high- velocity air, which is channelled through a Power-Take-Off (PTO). The PTO system converts the airflow into energy. In models that convert airflow to electricity, the PTO system consists of a bidirectional turbine. This means that the turbine always spins the same direction regardless of the direction of airflow, allowing for energy to be continuously generated. Both the collecting chamber and PTO systems will be explained further under \\"Basic OWC Components.\\"  Design = Basic OWC Components Power-Take-Off= The PTO system is the second main component of an OWC device. It converts the pneumatic power into a desired energy source (i.e. sound or electricity). The PTO system design is very important to the efficiency of the Oscillating Water Column. It must be able to convert airflow going both out of and into the collecting chamber into energy. Turbines that accomplish this are called bidirectional turbines. Wells Turbine Figure 1 The Wells turbine, designed in the late 1970s by professor Alan Arthur Wells at Queen's University Belfast, is a bidirectional turbine that uses symmetrical airfoils (see Fig. 1). The airfoils will spin the same direction regardless of the direction of airflow. The Wells turbine has both benefits and drawbacks. It has no moving parts other than the main turbine rotor, making it easier to maintain and more cost effective. However, it sacrifices some efficiency at high airflow rates because the airfoil's high angle of attack creates more drag. The angle of attack is the number of degrees the airfoil is from being parallel with the airflow. Wells turbines are most efficient at low speed airflows. Hanna Turbine The Hanna Turbine U.S. patent 8,358,026, was invented by environmental activist John Clark Hanna in 2009. The Hanna Turbine was developed to improve upon the pioneering Wells Turbine. As with the Wells, the Hanna device has no moving parts that come in direct contact with the ocean. The turbine has two rotors with back-to-back asymmetrical airfoils. Both rotors are mirror images with low angles of attack. The airfoils have higher lift coefficients and less drag than the Wells Turbine. This makes the Hanna design less prone to stalling and offers more torque with a larger operating window. The Hanna design also drives two generators that operate outside of the enclosed air duct in a relatively dry environment. This allows for easy maintenance of the generators.  History  The earliest use of Oscillating Water Columns was in whistling buoys. These buoys used the air pressure generated in the collecting chamber to power a PTO system that consisted of a whistle or foghorn. Rather than generating electricity, the PTO would generate sound, allowing the buoy to warn boats of dangerous water. J. M. Courtney patented one of these whistling buoy designs. In 1885 Scientific American reported that 34 of the whistling buoys were operating of the coast of the USA. The next major innovation occurred in 1947 when Yoshio Masuda, a Japanese naval commander designed an OWC navigation buoy that used a turbine PTO system. The PTO system generated electricity that recharged the buoy's batteries, allowing it to run with little maintenance. This was the first instance of OWCs being used to generate electricity. The buoy had a small output of 70-500 W and was stationed in Osaka Bay. Major OWC Power Plant Projects=LIMPET, Isle of Islay, Scotland Opened in 2001, this OWC power plant generates 500 kW with a single 2.6-meter diameter Wells turbine. The turbine is connected to a collecting chamber made up of 3 connected tubes measuring 6x6 meters. The LIMPET was built into a solid rock coastline of the Isle of Islay. This plant was constructed by Queen's University Belfast in partnership with Wavegen Ireland Ltd. Islay LIMPET Wave Power Plant – Publishable Report, 1 November 1998 to 30 April 2002, The Queen's University of Belfast Mutriku, Basque Country Opened in 2011, this OWC power plant can generate approximately 300 kW at proper conditions (enough to power 250 houses) with its 16 Wells turbines. The turbines were provided by Voith, a company which specializes in hydropower technology and manufacturing. The collecting chambers and turbines are housed in a breakwater. Breakwaters are man made walls (built offshore) which block the coastline from wave activity (often used around harbors). Each turbine has its own collecting chamber and the chambers measure 4.5m wide, 3.1m deep and 10m high. This was the first instance of multiple turbines being used in one plant. Ocean Energy (OE) Buoy The OE Buoy, currently under development by OceanEnergy, has been successfully tested in 2006 using a 28-ton 1:4 scale model anchored off the cost of Ireland. The OE Buoy is designed to be anchored far off shore in deep water where storms generate wave activity. It is powered by a Wells turbine and based on a 3-month test, full scale OE Buoys are expected to output approximately 500MW. OE Buoys are assembled on land and then transported by boat to optimal energy locations.  Environmental Impact  Oscillating Water Columns have no moving parts in the water, and therefore pose little danger to sea life. Offshore OWCs may even support sea life by creating an artificial reef. The biggest concern is that OWCs cause too much noise pollution, and could damage the natural beauty of a seascape. Both these problems could be fixed by moving OWCs farther off shore.  References  12\\\\.

Origins William John von Peterswald was born 28 November 1829 in Jamaica, West Indies, where his father, also named William, managed a large plantation, and received his early education at the Edinburgh Academy. His parents returned to Scotland when slavery was made illegal, and Peterswald's education continued at the Military Academy, Edinburgh, and Elizabeth College at Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, where he commanded the 1st Rifle Company attached to the Channel Islands Militia. The family moved to Liverpool, where his father died, and Peterswald lived for a time on the Continent then went over to Jersey, where some time later he married the Greffier's daughter. Peterswald and his wife emigrated to South Australia on the Charlotte Jane, arriving in Adelaide in May 1853. He ran a dairy farm at Munno Para for seven years without success, but the voluntary militia company which he raised and commanded was noted for its smartness. Police career Having lost his money on the farming venture, he settled in Adelaide, where he gained employment as assistant clerk of the House of Assembly. In 1862, following the murder of Pettinger at Government House, he applied for the now- vacant post of Inspector of Metropolitan Police under Major Warburton, which he won despite his having no experience or knowledge of policing. Four years later he was forced to resign due to insolvency, resulting from his failed dairying venture. Once again the vacancy was filled from outside the police force, this time by T. W. Bee, previously Relieving Officer with the Adelaide Destitute Asylum. In 1868 he was made Warden of the Barossa goldfields, which had suddenly become active and needed a firm hand to deal with the expected disputes. In August 1873 an exchange of positions saw Bee moving in two steps to Inspector of Licensed Premises and Peterswald returned to Inspector of Metropolitan Police and in 1875 the position was upgraded to Superintendent. He was appointed Acting Commissioner of Police in 1881 and then Commissioner of Police in 1882, succeeding George Hamilton, in which position he served until his death in August 1896. Legacy For 15 years Peterswald steadily guided the police through ever-increasing responsibilities despite often having a constrained budget. As a particular challenge, the police under his leadership established law and order between both European settlers/pastoralists and indigenous communities as the frontier of modernity expanded throughout the vast distances of Central Australia and the Northern Territory. In the latter case, the change was so rapid that in 1884 Peterswald established a branch of native police there. The difficult conditions necessitated more modern equipment. In the early 1880s Peterswald was responsible for initiating the re-arming of the Police Force. In early 1881 the Police were issued with 200 of the new Martini-Henry rifles in .455/.577 calibre and long-pattern bayonets, as used by the Volunteer Militia Forces. Peterswald also recommended that the Mounted Police be issued with the large New Model No. 3 Smith & Wesson revolver in .44 calibre. Public economic distress and unemployment during the 1880s and early 1890s presented the police with their first experiences of serious industrial unrest, all of which Peterswald handled with firm impartiality. To improve police esprit de corps he introduced revised uniform patterns and in 1884 encouraged the formation of a police band.Clyne, Robert  Colonial Blue : A History of the South Australian Police Force, 1836–1916. (Wakefield Press, 1987), p. 206. He also introduced uniformity in the colour of police horses, exclusively selecting the impressive greys for metropolitan duty. This strain or breed, despite being somewhat unsuitable for the outback, was later extended to many rural police horses. The \\"police greys\\" remain a proud tradition of the South Australian Police Force. For years Peterswald suffered from diabetes, which was the principal cause of his death. He was accorded with a state funeral, the procession being watched by large crowds of onlookers. In later years Peterswald lived at \\"St. Heliers\\", on the corner of Ward and Jeffcott streets, North Adelaide. His wife, Emily Mary Peterswald, who was a daughter of Charles de Ste. Croix, Greffier of the Island of Jersey, died 19 April 1916 at her residence on Buxton Street, North Adelaide, also named \\"St Heliers\\".

Incumbent Governor Evan Bayh, a Democrat, was ineligible to run for a third consecutive term due to term limits established by the Indiana Constitution.https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/07/us/political-briefs-indiana- as-governor-retires-3-republicans-joust.html He was succeeded by Lt. Governor Frank O'Bannon, who won election over Republican Stephen Goldsmith with 52% of the vote. Primaries=Democratic Party Candidates *Lt. Governor Frank O'Bannon O'Bannon was unchallenged in his party's primary, winning the Democratic nomination unanimously. He chose South Bend Mayor Joe Kernan to be his running mate. Republican Party Candidates *Mayor of Indianapolis Stephen Goldsmith *Former Marine Sergeant Rex Early *George Witwer Declined *Former Vice President of the United States Dan Quayle With Governor Evan Bayh unable to seek another term in office, Indiana Republicans felt confident in their ability to take the Governor's Mansion in the general election. Of the three candidates for the nomination, the front-runner by far was Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith. Goldsmith was by far the favorite for the nomination throughout the race, in some polls leading by as much as 20 points. The race was particularly heated: Indiana Republican Party Chairman Michael McDaniel, hoping to avoid alienating any voters, declined to endorse a candidate, instead hanging a Swiss flag in his office to symbolize his neutrality. Goldsmith easily won the primary and soon after chose Witwer as his running mate. Libertarian Party Candidates *Steve Dillon The Libertarian Party nominated Steve Dillon as their second candidate to contest the Indiana governorship. General Election The only Great Lakes state to have a Democratic Governor going into the 1996 elections, Indiana became the center of the Republican Party's attention in that year's gubernatorial elections. A traditionally Republican state, Goldsmith and his party were considered to have the edge in the election. That changed, however, when questions about Goldsmith's performance as Mayor of Indianapolis surfaced, specifically regarding an August 27 brawl in the city involving several drunken policemen. Goldsmith's campaign was further hurt when it was revealed that several comments made about O'Bannon's record as part of the Indiana state government had been statistically incorrect. The effect of these gaffes was to erase the double digit lead Goldsmith had enjoyed throughout the summer, leaving him narrowly trailing O'Bannon. O'Bannon, meanwhile, was able to take credit for a thriving economy and a recent tax surplus that had occurred during Bayh's administration. The Democrat centered his campaign on his record in the Indiana State Senate, simultaneously attacking Goldsmith for controversial decisions made during his tenure as Mayor of Indianapolis. By running what was later described as a \\"steady\\" campaign, O'Bannon was able to refute many of the charges Goldsmith brought against him while keeping the pressure on. Even so, the race remained tight down to election night, and Goldsmith reportedly settled in on November 5 expecting to be elected. Results O'Bannon won the election narrowly, carrying 52% of the vote to Goldsmith's 47%.

He held the roles of consiliarius or archdeacon. He is known for his work as a translator, although only part of the Miracula Cyri et Johannis survives today. Career While there is no record of a birth date for Bonifatius, it is believed that he died in 705 AD.W. Berschin, “Bonifatius Consiliarius. Ein Römischer Übersetzer in der Byzantinischen Epoche,” in A. Lehner, Lateinische Kultur in VIII Jahrkundert (Ottilien, 1989), pp. 25-40 Since he worked under the papacy for a long period, it is likely that he was born in Rome. Bonifatius served as consiliarius from the papacy of Martin I until that of John VII. Bonifatius was sent by Pope Benedict II to see Macarius of Antioch in 684 or 685 after the sixth ecumenical council had anathematized (or excommunicated) Macarius for his belief in monothelitism.Anastasius Bibliotecarius, Sancta Synodus septima generalis Nicaena Secunda, in PL 129 col. 227 Most likely, Bonifatius was sent to see Macarius to try and convert him and he would have been the ideal candidate to do so because of his vast knowledge of both theology and Greek. He was later sent by Pope Sergius as a representative to the Quinisext Council in 692.Liber pontificalis, trans. R. Davis (Liverpool, 1989), p. 82. He was also well noted in historical documents as the teacher and friend of the English bishop, Wilfrid of Ripon. These mentioned that in c. 653 a young Wilfrid learned in Rome of \\"Paschal calculation, with which the schismatics of which Britain and Ireland were not acquainted with\\" as well as other ecclesiastical disciplines including how to understand the Gospels.Stephan, Life of Wilfrid, c. 5, trans. B. Colgrave (Cambridge, 1985), p. 13; Bede, Ecclesastical History, V. 19 https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/bede- book5.asp. Bede adds that Wilfrid could not have learned these things in his own country. There are also records of Wilfrid returning to Rome in 679-80 and in 704, when he may have sought assistance from Bonifatius.Pollard, Richard, \\"A Cooperative Correspondence: The Letters of Gregory the Great,\\" in Neil and Dal Santo, A Companion to Gregory the Great (Leiden, 2013), pg. 307-309 Miracula translation Bonifatius B. Valtorta, \\"Clavis Scriptorum Latinorum Medii Aevi,\\" pg. 70-71 was also known as a translator, in addition to serving in the role of consiliarius. He translated the first twelve chapters of the Miracula Cyri et Johannis (known in English as the Seventy Miracles of SS. Cyrus and John) from Greek into Latin. The original was written by Sophronius of Jerusalem. This document detailed the miracles of Saints Cyrus and John. Anastasius Bibliotecarius noted this when he went to write his famous translations of the same work (\\"Bonifatius consiliarius… duodecim cum praefatione capitula olim interpretatus est\\" Franklin, Carmela. \\"The Latin Dossier of Anastasius the Persian: Hagiographic Translations and Transformations\\" pp. 113) referencing that a Bonifatius Consiliarius had already translated the first twelve chapters of this piece into Latin. Based on when these translations were completed, it appears that this is the same Bonifatius that was associated with Wilfrid and the sixth ecumenical council. It is believed that Anastasius would have used Bonifatius’ translations to assist him in completion of his translations of the Miracula in the ninth century. Bonifatius’ translations would most likely have been completed during the papacy of Leo II or Benedict II, Leo known for being bilingual and wanting to have such documents like the Miracula translated from Greek to Latin. Richard Pollard has argued that \\"by examining Bonifatius’s Latin prose style and vocabulary in minute detail, and comparing these to existing papal documents… papal officials with similarly high levels of rhetorical, theological and legal training may have been more numerous than previously supposed.\\"Pollard, Richard \\"An edition and study of seventh-century papal letters, and a study of Carolingian Nonantola’s manuscripts\\" Excerpt from \\"Papers of the British School at Rome\\" Issue 79, pgs 365-366 See also *Hagiography *List of translators References Category:Year of birth missing Category:705 deaths Category:Archdeacons Category:7th-century translators Category:People from Rome Category:7th-century Italian writers Category:7th-century Latin writers ","title":"Boniface Consiliarius"},{"id":"41066041","text":"Gasht or Gosht or Gesht () may refer to: * Gasht, Gilan * Gasht-e Gurab, Gilan Province * Gasht-e Rudkhan, Gilan Province * Gosht, Iran * Gesht, South Khorasan * Gasht Rural District (disambiguation) ","title":"Gasht"},{"id":"41066050","text":"GeoOp Pty Ltd is a public company incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act with company number 2244624.

The title refers to the city nickname of Niagara Falls and is derived from the Latin word for waterfalls. Summary The novel is about two childhood friends, Duncan Diggs and Owen Stuckey, who grow up together in Niagara Falls. The novel alternates between their two perspectives. In the present day Duncan Diggs, released after eight years from a twenty year sentence at the Kingston Penitentiary, calls his childhood friend Owen Stuckey to drive him back home to Niagara Falls. After dropping him off at his parents place, Owen goes to the woods and reminisces on their childhood friendship together which was based on their mutual hero-worship of a small-time wrestler named Bruiser Mahoney. After seeing Mahoney perform live one night, and meeting him briefly, the boys' fathers get into an altercation in the parking lot with some of their co-workers, the fathers of boys around their age who think that Duncan and his father cheated at a game of go-kart racing. While the police arrest the men Mahoney, who happened to be exiting the arena at the same time, takes the boys into his van with the intention of returning them home. Instead he becomes inebriated and takes them into the forest after learning they have never been camping before. His behaviour becomes increasingly erratic and he reveals his real name is Dade Rathburn and he is from Orillia before telling the boys that wrestling is fake. The next morning Owen and Duncan awake to find him dead and decide to try to follow the tracks of Bruiser's van through the forest in order to find their way home. The boys are lost in the woods for several days with nothing to eat, eventually meeting a vagrant who tries to sexually assault them. After frightening him away with a gun they took off of Mahoney's body they languish in the woods for one more day before discovering an isolated home. From there they are rescued and gradually drift apart from one another for a few years. They later reunite as teenagers when Duncan discovers two abandoned greyhound puppies and decides to gift one to Owen. Their former baby sitter, Edwina Murphy, helps them bring the greyhounds to a racing track where they discover that Owen's pet, Fragrant Meat, can never be a racer while Duncan's pet, Dolly, is a gifted prodigy. As the boys spend more time at the race track they grow closer to Ed and she and Owen begin a relationship. Meanwhile Owen becomes a star basketball player and begins to distance himself from Duncan again. Owen's basketball career is cut short when he is the victim of a hit and run perpetuated by Clyde Hillicker and Adam Lowery, the sons of the men who fought Owen and Duncan's fathers all those years ago. With his basketball career in ruins Owen goes to college to train as a police office. Meanwhile Ed leaves him for Duncan and the two begin racing Dolly. Dolly moves her way up the race track but becomes grievously injured during a secret after hours race that Duncan participates in. He loses twenty thousand dollars to Lemmy Drinkwater and Dolly loses her leg. As Duncan matures into adulthood he begins to bare knuckle box in an illegal ring run by Lemmy Drinkwater to supplement the meagre income he earns at the local cookie factory. When he is laid off he agrees to illegally smuggle cigarettes over the Canada–United States border for Lemmy. Shortly after the deal between Duncan and Lemmy is struck he receives a phone call from Owen who makes vague hints that he is being watched by the police. Duncan decides to go through with the deal anyway, however Igor Bearfoot, one of Lemmy's associates, believes he is a snitch and tries to choke him to death. Duncan saves himself by stabbing Igor with a box cutter. He is captured by Owen and forced to stand trial. In prison Duncan meets a man called Silas Garrow, a professional boxer from the Akwesasne reservation. The two become friends and Garrow teaches Duncan how to improve his boxing skills. In the present day, now that he has been released from prison, Duncan goes to Lemmy and asks him to arrange a fight between him and three men of his choosing. Lemmy arranges the fight and Duncan manages to beat the first two men with some difficulty. The third man is Silas Garrow, with whom Duncan had previously arranged a plan to throw the fight. After winning the fight Duncan manages to nearly bankrupt Lemmy with his winnings. Dissatisfied with his winnings Duncan, Owen and Silas come together to secretly record Lemmy discussing his cigarette smuggling business. However before he can mention it he spots a police issued rifle that Silas is carrying and attempts to shoot him. Silas survives and Duncan and Owen follow Lemmy into the woods only to become grievously injured and lost. They pursue Lemmy for days eventually finding the old van Bruiser Mahoney kidnapped them in. Knowing that they are close to salvation they nevertheless make the wrong turn they made as boys and end up in the cave they found as children. There Lemmy reunites with them and after a scuffle in which Lemmy attempts to murder Duncan and Duncan shoots at Lemmy with Bruiser's old gun, Owen discovers that Lemmy is carrying a cellphone and calls for help. In the final epilogue we learn that all three men survived and that Duncan, suffering from brain- damage, has left Niagara Falls to pursue Ed and that Lemmy is in Attica. Reception Cataract City was published to positive reviews. The National Post wrote of it as a \\"superb, thoughtful and thoroughly entertaining novel that is, page by page, mostly riveting, its prose flawless and its observations acute and, often touchingly sympathetic.\\" Meanwhile The Globe and Mail praised Davidson as \\"one of [Canada]'s great kinetic writers.\\" Awards and nominations Cataract City was shortlisted for the 2013 Scotiabank Giller Prize.

It was sold in November 2013 for 142.4 million, which at the time was the highest price attained at auction for a work of art when not factoring in inflation. That record was surpassed in May 2015 by Version O of Picasso's Les Femmes d'Alger series. Background Bacon and Freud were friends but artistic rivals. Introduced in 1945 by artist Graham Sutherland, they swiftly became close friends who met frequently. The two artists painted each other several times, starting in 1951, when Freud first sat for Bacon. Two full-length triptychs of Freud by Bacon resulted. Three Studies of Lucian Freud is the later of the two; the first one, created in 1966, has not been seen since 1992. They form part of a series of large triptych portraits of Bacon's friends painted in the 1960s; other subjects include Isabel Rawsthorne, Muriel Belcher and his partner George Dyer.Hyman, J. \\"Bacon, Francis (1909–1992)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 (accessed 14 November 2013) (subscription required) Bacon and Freud's friendship ended after an argument in the mid-1970s. Description All three panels, in Bacon's typical abstract, distorted, isolated style, show Freud sitting on a cane- bottomed wooden chair within a cage, on a curved mottled-brown surface with a solid orange background. Behind each figure is a headboard of a bed, originating in a set of photographs of Freud by John Deakin which Bacon used as a reference. Michael Peppiatt writes \\"Trapped here in a series of Baconian cages, a contorted Freud hovers from panel to panel like a coiled spring about to shoot out of the flat, airless picture plane.\\"Peppiatt M. \\"Francis Bacon: Three Studies of Lucian Freud\\", Caravaggio/Bacon, 2010 (quoted in ) The central panel portrays the figure face on, in a pose similar to that Bacon used for George Dyer, his lover. Brett Gorvy of Christie's considers the work to represent \\"a marriage of the incredibly important people in Bacon's life.\\" The three canvases of the triptych are the same size and are each individually framed. The colouring is brighter than is typical of Bacon's works. Francis Outred of Christie's describes the 1969 triptych as \\"a true masterpiece\\" and \\"an undeniable icon of 20th Century art\\" which \\"marks Bacon and Freud's relationship, paying tribute to the creative and emotional kinship between the two artists.\\" Art historian Ben Street describes the work as \\"not an A-grade Bacon.\\" It was among Bacon's favourites of his works. History The triptych was painted in 1969 at the Royal College of Art in London, where Bacon had a large enough studio to work on three adjacent canvases simultaneously. It was first exhibited in 1970 at the Galleria d'Arte Galatea in Turin, and then was included in a retrospective at the Grand Palais in Paris and the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf in 1971–72. The three panels of the triptych were sold separately in the mid-1970s. Bacon was unhappy that the panels had been split up, writing on a photograph of the left-hand panel that it was \\"meaningless unless it is united with the other two panels.\\" The panels were held by different collectors until the late 1980s, when one of the original purchasers, a collector from Rome named in some sources as Francesco De Simone Niquesa, reassembled the work. The reassembled triptych was exhibited in the US, at the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut in 1999, but the entire work was not exhibited in the UK until October 2013. On 12 November 2013, the triptych sold for 142.4 million (including the buyer's premium) to Elaine Wynn at Christie's New York auction house, nominally becoming the most expensive work of art ever to be sold at auction. When inflation is taken into account, a higher price was reached at the same auction house for Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet, which in 1990 sold for $ million current dollars. Bacon's triptych did surpass the constant dollar record of $119.9 million set by the fourth version of Edvard Munch's The Scream in May 2012. The 2013 sale also represents the highest price paid for a work by a British or Irish artist, beating Bacon's Triptych 1976, which fetched $86.3 million in May 2008.

It is bounded by Nørregade to the west, Vestergade to the south, Vester Voldgade to the east and Nørre Voldgade to the north. The name refers to the Latin language, which was once widely spoken in and around the University, whose historic home is situated on the other side of Nørregade. Most of the student life has now been relocated to four new campuses but the area is still known for its lively atmosphere with an abundance of boutiques, cafés and night clubs. History Gedde's district map of the North Quarterm 1757 The area around Our Lady's Square has been a centre for learning and thus use of the Latin language since the Middle Ages. The term Latinerkvarteret was formerly used for a larger area on both sides of the square, including Store Kannikestræde, Krystalgade and Fiolstræde. In 1208, Bishop Peder Sunesøn founded a Latin school and a body of noble canons in association with the Church of Our Lady. When the University of Copenhagen was founded in 1479, it took over the old town hall and after the Reformation it took over the bishops palace on the north side of Our Lady's Square. The university took over the responsibility for the education of priests while the Our Lady's School survived as Copenhagen's only Latin school. In 1817 it was renamed the Metropolitan School. With the Reformation, Danish replaced Latin as the church's language but Latin remained the dominant language at the University until about 1800.

While some glass window panes were made there after 1608, most of the windows had been shipped from England.Kelso, William M. Jamestown, the buried truth. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, they started glass making in Jamestown 2006. The glassmaking business in the United States started when eight Germans (known as \\"Dutchmen\\") and Poles arrived as part of the Second supply on board the Mary and Margaret. They used local material: sand in the James River, potash was in the forest and a bed of endless oyster shells which could be burned and ground to make lime. They set up making the first batches of goods exported to England from the New World. The first shipment sent to England was called the trial glass. Most of it was window glass, bottles, vials and plain drinking glasses. The glass factory at Jamestown was believed to be the first manufactory in the United States.  The Glass House Point  The location was near the Jamestown peninsula over a mile from the fort, in a location that was convenient for glassblowing. The Jamestown Glasshouse was situated where the Native Americans used to camp and where the main roads converged, known to the settlers as the Greate Road. The area came to be called Glass House Point. Though this location made the recovery of mineral resources easily accessible, it also made the glassmakers vulnerable to sneak attacks by local tribes. The glass manufactory was controlled exclusively by the Polish glassmakers. The Dutchmen went to Werowocomoco (a Native American village on the York River fifteen miles from Jamestown) in order to build a house for the chief of the Powhatans, and plotted to kill Captain John Smith and steal powders and arms from the settlers. They didn’t succeed, and were kicked out of the village when the chief became suspicious of their dealings.Grizzard, Smith. Jamestown Colony: A Political, Social, And Cultural History. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2007.  Production  The glassmaking operation required three furnaces with different sizes. The first furnace was for melting the glass, the smaller one for annealing or cooling the finished glass. And an even smaller fritting furnace for preheating the ingredients needed for making the glass. A fourth furnace was erected to fire up the clay pots used in the glassmaking process. The construction of the furnaces was made up of huge boulders rolled out of the river and glued together with mud. A rectangular wood-frame building was constructed to protect the furnaces and the workers from the weather. Overall the glass house was about thirty seven feet wide by fifty feet long, and probably had a high thatched roof and partially open sides with the office situated next to the furnaces.  Archaeological evidence  In 1948, while excavating the foundation of the furnaces, archaeologist Jean Carl Harrington theorized that the workmen probably produced a lot of green glass. The glass was comparable to that produced in England: exhibit showcases, window panes, bottles, and drinking vessels. Glassmaking in the colonies was discontinued in 1609 during the Starving Time. The Virginia Company expected returns; since the glassmaking business was in decline, they ventured to other manufactories.  American production  Glassmaking in America symbolized wealth. Ivor Noël Hume excavated in Virginia and found one fragment of a piece of glass. Most glass was utilitarian with a case of glasses in the parlor quite common. Over 70 percent of Hume’s finds were fragments of quatre foil-stemmed glasses. Round bottles assumed a more squat shape. Glass was not universal in most households. Many wealthy colonists had little to no glass in their households. According to his records, a Ralph Fisbourn died in Chester, Pennsylvania in 1708 with an estate of £1,762; his only glass possessions were a few bottles.Edgar. A Documentary History of American Interiors from the Colonial Era. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1980. American glass factories were founded first in New York in 1732 and then in South Jersey by Caspar Wistar in 1739. The 1730s saw an increasing variety of products. Boston merchants advertised wine glasses, jelly glasses, syllabubs, decanters, sugar pots, barrel cans, punch bowls, bird fountains, and candlesticks. Merchants also offered japanned glassware. \\"For those who did buy taste in the newest styles, drinking glasses were the inverted baluster type (popular in England from 1720 to about 1735) or the later drawn stem glass (1730–1745).\\" Both types have been found in Virginia. Wealth and fashion did not dictate an elaborate collection of glass, for the Reverend Ebenezer Thayer who died in nearby Roxbury less than a year later had £137 worth of silver. But his only glass was some salts in the parlor.  Style  The style of glassmaking changed by 1746 when the government passed the Glass Excise Bill, which taxed glass by weight; beginning in 1751 advertisements in a Boston newspaper made a reference to “new fashion” glass. Usually the phrase referred to the air twist stemmed glass or “wormed wine glasses” that had first been advertised in the Boston market in 1746. By 1761, glasses and decanters were also engraved or “flowered”. Glassmakers worked diligently to provide special glasses for specific purposes, and inevitably only the well-to-do could afford a full array of forms. The inventory of Governor Francis Fauquier’s glass is revealing, when the former Governor of Virginia died in 1768, he left: 5 beer glasses, 5 champagne glasses, 14 water glasses, 55 wine glasses, 59 syllabub glasses, 69 jelly glasses, 23 glass salvers, 15 decanters and 8 cruets. He also had three sets of salvers that made up into large pyramids; the largest pyramid was valued at £15. Such pyramids were advertised in the Boston press in 1772.Cotter John L., J. Paul Hudson. New Discoveries at Jamestown . Washington D.C.: U.S Government Printing Office, 1957 During the Federal Period, after the American Revolutionary War, Americans adopted new European styles. During the Revolutionary period, decoration was minimal. Although the American glass industry was making a strong beginning, considerable quantities were still imported. Cut glass was advertised in Baltimore as early as 1786, gaining popularity toward the end of the period. American production of blown three-mold glass began during the War of 1812. Glassmakers Henry William Stiegel and John Frederick Amelung had both tried to produce elaborate, fine table glass rivaling the European imports and both failed because there was not yet a market for the work they produced.  European influences  Many of the glassmakers who worked in American factories were from England and their designs bore a resemblance to that of European designs. European cut glass influenced the patterns of American cut glass until 1880. Phillip McDonald designed the “Russian” pattern for T.G. Hawkes & Company of Corning, New York; from this point on American cut glass wares became richer in design and quality of both workmanship and glass. John S. O’Connor’s “Parisian” patterns - the first cut glass designs to utilize a curved line in cutting - greatly influenced American designs thereafter, because most of the cutting had been straight lines.C., Revi Albert. American Cut and Engraved Glass. New York: Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1965  Manufactures across the mid colonies  Since the Anglo-American War of 1812 had stopped the importation of fine cut glass from abroad, American factories progressed in the making of flint glass. Glassworks such as the South Boston Crown Glass Company manufactured flint glass in South Boston. Another flint glass manufacturer, the New England Glass Company, was established in 1818. Glassmakers often worked for a number of companies; many split off to form their own glassworks. The glassmaking business could be risky; many glassworks closed after only a few years in business due to labor or financial troubles. The Bay State Glass Company was established in East Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1857, and advertised products such as cut flint glassware and engraved glass. However, the firm dissolved only a few years later in 1863. The Boston and Sandwich Glass Company in Sandwich, Massachusetts produced a considerable quantity of fine cut glassware after 1826, but closed in 1888 due to troubles with a newly formed glassmakers' union. In Meriden, Connecticut, Parker and Casper opened a glass cutting shop in 1867. They manufactured decanters, caster bottles, and sugar, salt and mustard glass liners until the shop closed in 1869.

White silica deposits grow up to the overflow level, and the lake's colour is a result of finely divided silica suspended in the water. At low water levels the lake can be a dull grey colour, changing to an intensely sky blue colour at higher lake levels, in particular after the overflow stage.Information panel \\"Inferno Crater\\" at Inferno Crater lookout Inferno Crater was blasted out of the side of the locally prominent Mt Haszard as part of the 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption, which opened several craters along a rift stretching southwest from Mount Tarawera to the nearby Southern Crater. Inferno Crater's trumpet-shaped lake bed is up to deep when the lake is full, which is also when it reaches its highest temperature.Waimangu Wanderer Guide, April 2014 Since 1901 the lake occupying Inferno Crater has exhibited water- level variations closely associated with the Waimangu Geyser cycle. Inferno Crater Lake and its neighbouring Frying Pan Lake form a unique relationship and follow an interconnected rhythmic cycle of hydrology variations repeating itself over the course of roughly 38 days. When the water level and temperature of Inferno Crater Lake increase, the water level and outflow of Frying Pan Lake decrease. Comparable cyclic activity is unknown in other hydrothermal systems in the world. The system has been the subject of studies since monitoring equipment was installed in the area in 1970.Information panel \\"Waimangu Monitoring Station\\" at the outflow from Frying Pan Lake, GNS Science and Waikato Regional Council Four distinct phases can be recognised in its cycle: First, the lake level rises steadily from its lowest level by a total of almost over the course of eight days, and then it commences oscillating. The average lake level keeps rising over the course of the oscillations of the second phase until it reaches overflow level. At that point, the lake's volume has increased by . Next, the lake overflows for about 51 hours at a rate of almost , discharging on average of over hot water down a temporary overflow stream into Waimangu Stream in the valley below.

It was created by TASER International, Inc. in 2011 after their popular X26 model and the similar but bulkier and heavier X3. The X2 Defender, unlike previous CEWs, can shoot two cartridges and is semi-automatic.  Function  The X2 Defender is a projectile weapon that works by firing two electrically charged probes that pierce through the clothes of a target, creating neuromuscular incapacitation (NMI) of the body. The X2 can hold up to two replaceable cartridges, each holding two probes. Each \\"Smart Cartridge\\" has a circuit board that activates the cartridge to shoot out the two probes with gas pressure when it receives a signal. Unlike early CEWs, the main function of the X2 Defender does not operate under the principle of pain compliance so even people with high pain tolerance cannot resist the effects of the CEW, but if that does not work there is a backup function that enables a Drive-Stun mode in which the electric current does follow the principle of pain compliance and physically forces the target to submit. The X2 is used somewhat like a handheld pistol. They both have a similar design, and have similar features like a trigger, a safety lock, and aiming sights.  Safety  With a 600 ohm test load, the X2 Defender applies a variable voltage peaking at approximately 2000V, corresponding to a peak current of 3.3A. The widely quoted 50kV specification is an open circuit voltage and is not applied to a target in use. To ensure safe handling, the electric current only lasts a maximum of 5 seconds for every activation and the weapon can be equipped with a video camera and a data recorder. The electrical circuit is powerful enough to disrupt the sensory and motor nerves of a target, but was deemed safe by engineers associated with Taser International. General safety concerns and incidents have drawn criticism to all CEWs in use since they were made. CEWs can cause people to die in accidents where targets fall. * Taser safety issues * Braidwood Inquiry  Specifications  The X2 Defender has an effective range of 4.6 m (15 ft). The operating temperature range and storage temperature range is -4 °F (-20 °C) to 122 °F (50 °C). The X2 Defender’s dimensions with the battery pack (length x width x height) are 7.8″ (19.8 cm) x 1.7″ (4.3 cm) x 4.2″ (10.7 cm) and it weighs 454 grams with two full battery cartridges.  Law enforcement use  The X26 and M26 models were the first advanced TASER models commonly used by law enforcement, and the X2 and X3 models came after and are increasingly being used because of their advanced semi-automatic feature. In a large metropolitan police department over a three-year study (2002-2004), the estimated success of an effective TASER incapacitation and arrest was 85 percent out of all TASER uses. Police agencies use CEWs so much because they seem to be overall safer to use while bringing a suspect into custody. The Police Executive Research Forum has found that the use of CEWs has significantly reduced suspect and officer injuries for situations where the use of force was necessary. Not all police agencies are run the same, but most of them use CEWs. There have been many incidents that have brought major concern and criticism about police officers misusing CEWs. They were either caused by accidents that occurred while the use of force was necessary, or by police officers using CEWs at an event where it was unnecessary. * Robert Dziekański Taser incident * University of Florida Taser incident * UCLA Taser incident  References  Category:Non-lethal weapons ","title":"TASER X2 Defender"},{"id":"41066691","text":"Britannica is a far-right political party in the United Kingdom, led by Charles Baillie, the former organiser of the British National Party's Glasgow branch.

Florida Amendment 2, Use of Marijuana for Certain Medical Conditions, is an initiative that appeared on the November 4, 2014, ballot in the state of Florida as a citizen initiated state constitutional amendment. It was officially certified by the state's secretary of state to appear on the 2014 November ballot and numbered Amendment 2, not to be confused with the 2008 ban on same-sex marriage of the same name. If it had been enacted, the measure would have allowed for the cultivation, purchase, possession and use of medical cannabis to treat certain medical conditions when recommended by a licensed physician. The amendment was introduced by People United for Medical Marijuana on March 26, 2009. As of 2014, twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have already passed legislation allowing doctors to recommend the medicinal use of marijuana thereby legalizing a patients possession and use. After the amendment failed, in 2016 a similar amendment passed. 2014 gubernatorial politics The ballot measure was expected to have a significant impact on the 2014 governor's race, as the state's governor will be elected the same day the measure is voted on and both leading candidates have directly opposing views on the issue. Gubernatorial candidate, former governor, and Morgan & Morgan employee Charlie Crist(D) supported by donating a large sum of his own money to the effort, while the incumbent governor Rick Scott(R) is opposed to it. Attorney General Pam Bondi lead an effort to keep the measure off the ballot, ultimately failing when the state's Supreme Court ruled in favor of the proposed ballot measure. Bondi, backed by Rick Scott, filed suit to prevent the proposed constitutional amendment from appearing on the ballot. This is the third citizen backed initiative to amend the Florida Constitution to allow for the medical use of cannabis however, several \\"hail-mary passes\\" which consisted of filing legal challenges with seconds remaining on the clock have successfully kept this matter off the ballot for years. Court documents alleged each year that the proposed amendment failed to meet the rules of statutory construction regarding vagueness and violated the single subject matter rule. A citizens for compassion petition for a proposed amendment to the Florida Constitution on the matter of decriminalizing the medicinal use of cannabis was drafted with a simplified statement using elementary language and petitioners began gathering the requisite minimum number of voter signatures well in advance of the deadline in order to preemptively place the proposed ballot language before the Court anticipating the inevitable legal challenge. Under Florida's Constitution Florida's Supreme Court has ultimate authority and jurisdiction over proposed state constitutional amendment approval. Florida's top court ruled, in a split decision, that the language of the proposed amendment was not unconstitutionally vague nor confusing and the proposed amendment specifically addressed only one subject matter as required under the Florida Constitution and will be placed before the voters.http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2014/sc13-2006.pdf The Court used not so subtle cues by citing the rules of review from an advisory opinion titled \\"Advisory Op. to Att'y Gen. re Right to Treatment & Rehab. for Non-Violent Drug Offenses\\", finding, \\"This Court has traditionally applied a deferential standard of review to the validity of a citizen initiative petition and \\"has been reluctant to interfere\\" with \\"the right of self- determination for all Florida's citizens\\" to formulate \\"their own organic law.\\" Advisory Op. to Att'y Gen. re Right to Treatment & Rehab. for Non- Violent Drug Offenses, 818 So. 2d 491, 494 (Fla. 2002). Supporters Kim Russell, founder of People United for Medical Marijuana, said that she began legalization efforts shortly after her father was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Some research claims that the drug can help alleviate the symptoms. In response to claims that politics is the motivating factor, Russell says, \\"It's freedom and it's also compassion.\\" Supporters are widespread and include some notable public figures, the Florida Cannabis Action Network and John Morgan, head of the Morgan & Morgan law firm.News-Press.com, \\"Florida medical marijuana advocates claim impending victory,\\" June 3, 2013 Respected members of society have acknowledged the viable need for this legislation even admitting publicly to assisting loved ones to obtain medical marijuana including last sessions Florida State Senate President, Don Gaetz. Opposition Opponents include Sheldon Adelson, a Nevada Billionaire who donated $2.5 million to the Drug Free America Foundation, which is a political committee that helped defeat the measure. Path to the ballot In order to qualify for the 2014 ballot supporters are required to collect a minimum of 683,149 valid signatures by the petition drive deadline on February 1, 2014. Supporters reported in August 2013 that they had collected at least 110,000 signatures, enough to trigger a ruling by the Supreme Court of Florida on the measure's constitutionality. Because of the cost of circulating petitions, supporters said they were pausing all petitioning activity until the measure gained the court's approval. The language in the measure was later approved for the ballot by the Florida Supreme Court on January 27, 2014. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi had been litigating against the measure in court. An opinion against it was also filed by the Florida Legislature. A multi- institutional study by Penn Medicine published in JAMA Internal Medicine, supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01DA032110, R25DA023021) and the Center for AIDS Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center (NIH AI-51519), found that on average, states allowing the medical use of marijuana have lower rates of overdose caused deaths from opioid analgesics, such as OxyContin, Percocet and Vicodin than states without compassionate use medical marijuana laws. Researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania reviewed rates of death caused by opioid overdoses between 1999 and 2010. Results of the research reflect that on average, the (then 13) states with laws permitting medical use of cannabis reported an opioid overdose mortality rate at 24.8 percent lower after the compassionate use laws were enacted than those states without compassionate use laws. Implications of the findings may be the best evidence of the claims long made by proponents of medical marijuana use whose previous arguments were largely supported by anecdotal evidence due to the FDA ban inhibiting research. Long term benefits may be even greater where the study revealed that over time the relationship was even more apparent, as deaths attributed to opioid overdose were nearly 20 percent lower in the first year after a state's medical use law was implemented, and opioid overdose deaths continued to decrease to 33.7 percent lower five years after implementation of medicinal use laws. The study provides irrefutable evidence using a discrete data set (state), with a clear variable (with or without medicinal cannabis use), and a measurable mortality rate may provide the proof that cannabis is a safer medication for those patients suffering from chronic pain such as that endured by cancer patients. A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University and released on July 28, 2014, indicated that 88 percent of Florida's voters favor legalization of medical marijuana. Result Amendment 2 failed, receiving 57.6% of the vote. This was short of the 60% supermajority required for constitutional amendments in Florida.

Dual relationships are also referred to as multiple relationships, and these two terms are used interchangeably in the research literature. The American Psychological Association (APA) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (also referred to as the APA ethics code) is a resource that outlines ethical standards and principles to which practitioners are expected to adhere. Standard 3.05 of the APA ethics code outlines the definition of multiple relationships. Dual or multiple relationships occur when: *a professional and personal relationship take place simultaneously between the psychologist and the client * the psychologist has a relationship with a person closely related to or connected to their client * the psychologist has intentions to enter into a future relationship with the client or someone closely related to the client In addition, the standard provides a description of when to avoid multiple relationships (e.g., when the relationship causes harm to the client or impairs the psychologist's competence) and when these relationships are not considered unethical (e.g., when the relationship does not exploit the client or impair competence). In Other Fields Several \\"helping\\" fields which are not strictly psychological in nature, but which still involve a therapeutic counseling environment, also have stringent policies involving dual relationships and the avoidance of such relationships. For example, the National Association of Social Workers [NASW], which regulates 132,000 social workers across the world, names multiple types of dual relationships. This includes sexual, financial, personal or religious relationships which could become exploitative due to the differences in power between the worker and the client. Social workers are advised by the NASW to communicate with their clients when such a relationship arises or could arise, and are advised to take steps to avoid dual relationships wherever possible. The NASW recognizes, however, that dual relationships can be unavoidable in some types of communities, such as in rural communities or military installations.

He is credited with delineating Piaget's stages of cognitive development: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operations, and formal operations. According to Piaget, horizontal and vertical décalage generally occur during the concrete operations stage of development. Horizontal décalage refers to fact that once a child learns a certain function, he or she does not have the capability to immediately apply the learned function to all problems. In other words, \\"a horizontal décalage arises when a cognitive structure that can be successfully applied to task X cannot, though it is composed of the same organization of logical operations, be extended to task Y.\\" Horizontal décalage is frequently used in reference to a child's ability to solve different conservation tasks. This concept recognizes that an individual child will not necessarily be on the same level of functioning in all possible areas of performance. Rather, \\"concepts and schemas develop through operation on and manipulation of objects in a specific manner.\\" Vertical décalage refers to a child using the same cognitive function in different stages across development. In this sense, a child is improving upon a certain cognitive function, such as seriation tasks, as he or she ages. History The term 'décalage' was first used in psychology by Édouard Claparède, a Swiss neurologist and child psychologist, in 1917 in reference to consciousness. Long before Piaget coined the term, his studies in 1921 brought to light the idea that some tasks are more demanding for children than others based on their complexity. This information supports the information processing theory, an opposing theory of cognitive development. Piaget then used the term himself in 1941, as he was developing his theory of the cognitive development. In his research, Piaget discovered that while physical qualities (once developed) were invariant, children's problem solving abilities are not. His studies revealed certain \\"décalages,\\" or shifts and inconsistencies, in a child's cognitive development. Common examples An example of horizontal décalage is the invariance of quantity, which is typically mastered around the age of 6 or 7 when matter is concerned, at the age of 9 or 10 when weight is concerned, and around 11 or 12 years old when the invariant is volume. A 7-year-old child understands that when one of two equivalent balls of clay is transformed into a sausage-shape, the two lumps still consist of equal amounts of clay. The child, however, fails to correctly comprehend that the differently shaped clumps of clay weigh the same. Both tasks are similar, but the child is clearly unable to apply his understanding about the first situation to the second situation. A comparable phenomenon can be seen in a child's increasing ability to perform seriation tasks, which consists of ordering objects according to increasing or decreasing size. The ability to arrange rods in order of decreasing/increasing size is always acquired prior to the capacity to seriate according to weight. A commonly cited example of vertical décalage \\"can be observed between the constitution of practical or sensorimotor space and that of representative space \\" For example, at the age of 2, a child can navigate around a familiar environment, such as their home. It is not until years later that they can represent this knowledge symbolically by drawing a map. There is vertical décalage between a problem that a child can physically master and their ability to solve it in an abstract manner. Neurobiological perspective Some psychologists take a neural network model approach to the idea of horizontal and vertical décalage. According to these psychologists, horizontal and vertical décalage are the product of the development of the prefrontal cortex in children, which \\"contributes to age-related advances in flexible behavior\\". Certain tests and studies have been conducted to show how horizontal and vertical décalage are related to neural functioning. For example, scientists presented children with two identical balls of clay and then rolled one into a cylinder, changing its shape. When scientists then asked children which clump of clay contained more clay (conservation of mass), children were able to answer correctly that both clumps had equal amounts of clay. Children of the same age, however, were unable to answer which clump of clay weighed more (conservation of weight). This is an example of horizontal décalage because children were able to solve certain conservation tasks but not others despite their similarities. According to the neural network approach, as a child's prefrontal cortex develops, he or she is better able to maintain their knowledge \\"rules\\" and apply problem solving techniques across different situations. The development of the prefrontal cortex comes from the strengthening of neural synapses, a process which is remarkably heightened in childhood. Studies A series of studies by Piaget and Szeminska in 1941 and Piaget and Inhelder in 1967 revealed a horizontal décalage of approximately three years on tasks of length and weight seriation. The scientists tested 37 five- to ten-year-old boys and girls. In the length seriation task of this experiment, the subjects were made to order seven sticks from shortest to longest. In a variation of this task, called the \\"hidden length experiment,\\" the children were made to order the sticks, but were only able to look at two sticks at a time, forcing them to employ the transitive property. Finally, the children were forced to place seven identical cubes of different densities in order from lightest to heaviest. The results revealed that the \\"hidden length\\" seriation task and the weight seriation task were much more difficult for the children than were the normal seriation tasks, thereby supporting the notion of horizontal décalage. While the children were able to successfully complete certain seriation tasks, they were unable to complete others. Studies have also been conducted regarding vertical decalage. In a study by Redpath and Rogers, fifteen males and fifteen females from both preschool and second grade were interviewed. From these interviews, it was evident that the children showed a developmental progression in their understanding of different medical concepts, such as \\"hospitals, doctors, nurses, operations, and illness.\\" The researchers concluded that the children's grasp and understanding of these medical concepts were related to the level of their cognitive development. The second graders demonstrated a heightened ability to understand said concepts as compared to the preschool aged children, thus supporting the notion of vertical decalage. The researchers discovered that if the second graders had been previously hospitalized, the experience improved their grasp of hospital concepts. This was not the case with preschoolers because they were not able to translate their experience into understanding. Criticisms There have been many criticisms of Piaget's theories, including his ideas of horizontal and vertical décalage. A further criticism is that restructuring the presentation of a problem has a significant bearing on the child's ability to solve the problem, which demonstrates that problem solving ability might depend on the presentation of the problem more so than on the child's cognitive development. According to Wordsworth and other Piagetian supporters, however, Piaget's main idea that all children have the same general course of development is so significant that it outweighs the criticisms of his methodology in which so many others find fault.

Presently, the majority of steel production is through the blast furnace which has to rely on ever decreasing amounts of coking coal. That is coal which has been cooked in order to remove impurities so that it is superior to coal. In addition, the Blast furnace requires a sinter plant too in order to prepare the iron ore for reduction. Unlike the Blast Furnace, smelting reduction processes are typical smaller and use coal and oxygen directly to reduce iron ore into a usable product. Smelting reduction processes come in two basic varieties, two-stage or single-stage. In a single-stage system the iron ore is both reduced and melted in the same container. Meanwhile, in a two-stage process, like Corex, the ore is reduced in one shaft and melted and purified in another. Plants using the Corex process have been put use in areas such as South Africa, India, and China.  Process  The Corex process consists of two main parts a Reduction Shaft and a Melter- Gasifier . The main reagents for the Corex process are iron ore, noncoking coal, and oxygen. Unlike the Blast furnace the Corex process does not use a hot blast of nitrogen, thereby greatly reducing NOx gas emissions, but instead uses oxygen. In addition, the Corex process can use iron oxides containing up to 80% lump ore and uses non coking coal directly as a reducing agent. In the Reduction shaft the iron ore, along with limestone and dolomite additives, is added and then reduced by reduction gas into 95% direct reduced iron, DRI. The DRI is then redirected via six discharge screws into the melter-gasifier. The melter-gasifier has three main sections, the gaseous free board zone, the Char bed, and the hearth zone, and it has an effect on several stages in the process. First it serves to create the reduction gas by gasifying the coal with oxygen and then cooling it. After being reduced, the DRI is redirected to the char bed where the iron and slag are melted and then directed to the hearth zone. The heat inside the metal gasifier keeps the amount of phenols small, keeping them out of the atmosphere. Meanwhile, carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas from the original gasification of the coal exit the gasifier while other byproducts are captured in the metallic slag. The rest of the hot gas is then cooled and sent into the reduction shaft resulting in the Corex export gas which is used to control pressure in the plant. Many of the gases resulting from this process can then be recycled or used to produce electricity. Dust particles also appear in these gases and the Melter gasifier recycles them with four dust burners.  Advantages  There are many advantages to the Corex Process, for example carbon dioxide emissions are up to 20% lower than with the conventional blast furnace, and the Corex process produces far less SO2 and dust than the blast furnace. In addition Corex plants do not release as many phenols or sulfides limiting water contamination.  Disadvantages There are drawbacks. For example, at the JSW Steel plant in India it was found that to be viable the Corex process still needed about 15% coke. Furthermore, it has also been found that Corex plants require large amounts of oxygen which can be expensive. Also the export gas can make the process highly inefficient. However, this particular problem can be mitigated by using the export gas in electricity production.

For example, extroverts may deliberately engage with others like themselves. Niche picking is a component of gene-environment correlation.Jaffee, S. R., Jaffee, S. R., & Price, T. S. (2008). Genotype- environment correlations: Implications for determining the relationship between environmental exposures and psychiatric illness. Psychiatry (Abingdon, England), 7(12), 496-499.  Scarr and McCartney's model  In 1983, psychology professors Sandra Scarr and Kathleen McCartney proposed that genes affect the environments individuals choose to interact with, and that phenotypes influence individuals’ exchanges with people, places, and situations. The model states that genotypes can determine an individual's response to a certain environment, and that these genotype-environment pairs can affect human development. Scarr and McCartney, influenced by Robert Plomin's findings, recognized three types of gene-environment correlations. As humans develop, they enter each of these stages in succession, and each is more influential than the last. ;Passive: During infancy, individuals' environments are provided by their parents. The rearing environment reflects the parents' genes, so it is genetically suitable for the child. ;Evocative: Environments respond to individuals based on the genes they express (phenotype). Infants and adolescents evoke social and physical responses from their environments through this interaction. Experiences, and therefore development, are more influenced by evocation than by the passive environment. However, the influence of evocation declines over time. ;Active: Individuals selectively attend to aspects of their environment that correlate to their specific genotypes and autonomously choose environments to interact with. Their selections are based on motivational, personality, and intellectual aspects of their genotype. Therefore, environmental interactions are person specific and can vary greatly. Since these environments are chosen rather than encountered, they have a greater effect on experience and development.  Role  Scarr and McCartney defined niche picking as a mechanism used to select environments suitable for one's genotype. Therefore, an individual’s temperament often affects the type of niche selected, since environment reflects one’s general disposition.Lemery, K. (2005). Temperament. In N. Salkind (Ed.), Encyclopedia of human development. (pp. 1256–1258). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. An individual's niche can change over time, as explained in Emilie Snell-Rood's theory of behavioral plasticity and evolution. Snell-Rood argues that one element of developmental behavioral plasticity is the change in a gene’s expressed phenotype as a result of a change in environment. Expressed behaviors reflect the environment one welcomes, and these behaviors change as a result of that environment. If an individual has encountered an environment before, their behavioral change can be attributed to learning, allowing the production of different responses. With respect to niche picking, this suggests that individuals' process of selecting environments evolves, as does their method of response and level of responsiveness.  Examples  The genotype-environment model states that as siblings and fraternal twins age, their phenotypes grow apart. This is due to their respective mastery of the passive, evocative, and active interactions. When the siblings are infants, the environments their parents provide are similar. But as they age and begin to evoke responses from their environments, the social and physical elements they encounter start to vary. The personal characteristics that encourage environmental responses, such as appearance, personality, and intellect, are not the same between siblings and fraternal twins because of gene variations. Once siblings can actively interact with their environment and select environments they like, differences between their niches become clear. This process is evident in families where one child is outgoing and lively while the other is timid and cautious. According to Frank Sulloway, a social researcher, most characteristic differences between siblings result from personality variation and non-shared environments, both of which are influenced by: * parental investment * the tendency for siblings to differentiate themselves from each other, often by assuming opposite dispositions * birth order, personality, and gender roles.Sulloway, F. (2010). Why Siblings Are Like Darwin's Finches: Birth Order, Sibling Competition, and Adaptive Divergence within the Family. The evolution of personality and individual differences. New York: Oxford University Press. Together, these elements give siblings different evocative and active environmental experiences that reflect their individual niches. In identical twins, this process is different. When siblings are the same age and have the same appearance, some people respond to them identically, despite their different personalities. Twins encounter the same social and physical influences from their environments, whether they have been reared separately or together. Often, this causes them to develop similar niches, though it does not guarantee that they will.  Contemporary applications  Scarr and McCartney's model provides a framework for examining the role that children's genotypes play in determining environmental interactions. Two major topics associated with this research are public policies to promote children's education and the heritability of political beliefs.  Implications for policy makers  In a 1996 study, Scarr examined the implications of genotype-environment interaction for public policy, specifically in education. She advised policy makers to be cautious when using programs such as Head Start to encourage intellectual development in children, arguing that genotype-environment interactions gave all children (except those raised in particularly abusive or neglectful homes) \\"good-enough opportunities\\" to develop without the aid of such programs. Policy makers might expect to see a jump in children's intellectual abilities from programs such as Head Start, which are designed to introduce children to a school setting, create a stable environment, and further their cognitive talents. Scarr, however, suggests that they cannot fully recreate what intelligent parents and a nurturing environment provide. She instead advocates a varied and stimulating environment that lets children use various types of niche expression. Scarr conducted an experiment in 1997 on the impact of out-of-home day care on children. From this and previous studies, she concluded that the quality of day care had only small, temporary effects on intellectual development. She noted that for children from good homes, genotype-environment interaction usually provides most of the intellectual development they need. Parental and environmental support allows these children to explore the niches most suited to their intellectual desires and abilities. These findings suggest that children from low-income families can benefit from programs that offer the same kind of support. Rather than a narrow environment that focuses on assimilating children into educational institutions, a stimulating environment would provide the most benefit to children who do not get adequate levels of genotype-environment interaction at home.

He received numerous degrees from Oxford University and Harvard University. He taught at Magdalen College School of Medicine at Oxford and later became the youngest Sterling Professor of Physiology at Yale University. His main contributions were in primate neurophysiology and history of science. Early life and education John Farquhar Fulton was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota as the youngest of 6 children Gariepy, Thomas P. \\"John Farquhar Fulton and the History of Science Society\\", Isis Vol. 90, 1999. to Edith Stanley Wheaton and John Farquhar Fulton, an ophthalmologist who helped found the University of Minnesota. He studied at the University of Minnesota from 1917–18 and then transferred to Harvard University, receiving a B.S. in 1921. Starting in 1921, he studied neurophysiology at Magdalen College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, earning a B.A. with first class honors in 1923. Then, as a Christopher Welch Scholar at Magdalen College, he received an M.A. and a D.Phil. in 1925. He then received an M.D. from Harvard in 1927. After his time at Harvard, he focused his studies on neurosurgery at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston under Harvey Cushing. He later returned to Oxford to receive a D.Sc. in 1941 and D.Litt. in 1957. He was hospitalized for diabetes mellitus in 1950 and for cardiac difficulties in 1957. He died at the age of 60 due to heart failure. Leadership Fulton taught as a demonstrator in physiology for two years at Oxford University starting in 1923. He taught briefly at the Magdalen College School of Medicine from 1928–29, then transferred to Yale University, becoming the youngest Sterling Professor of Physiology. His leadership extended outside the classroom. His positions included editor for the Journal of Neurophysiology; creator of the Yale Aeromedical Research Unit in 1940; chairman of the Subcommittee on Historical Records of the National Research Council, member of the Committee on Aviation Medicine; trustee for the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University in 1942; president of the History of Science Society from 1947 to 1950; first chairman of the Yale Department of History and Medicine in 1951,Yale University Medical Historical Library \\"John Farquhar Fulton\\", accessed 2 October 2013. along with Harvey Williams Cushing and Arnold Klebs, and head of the Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences from 1951-60. Contributions=History of science Fulton strongly encouraged the addition of humanities into the scientific fields by placing the history of sciences into general education. His passion for this topic landed him the role of president of the History of Science Society from 1947-50. He aided in the founding of institutions such as the Medical Historical Library at Yale (1941), the Logan Clendening Lectures in the History of Medicine at the University of Kansas in 1950,Fulton, John F. \\"Logan Clendening Lectures on the History of Science and Philosophy of Medicine, First Series\\", University of Kansas Press, 1950. the Yale Department of History of Medicine (with Harvey Williams Cushing and Arnold Klebs in 1951), and the Yale Department of the History of Science and Medicine in 1959. Madeline Stanton, who was Librarian of the Historical Collections at the Medical Historical Library at Yale, was also a frequent co-author with Fulton on works regarding history of science and organization of sources on the same topic.Wilson, L G (1981). \\"Madeline Earle Stanton 1898-1980\\". Bulletin of the Medical Library Association. 69 (3): 357–358. ISSN 0025-7338. PMID 7018632. During his time as president of the History of Science Society, he was a member of the editorial board of its historical journal Isis and helped stabilize it so it could grow in popularity. He also organized meetings in 1947 for the Committee on the History of Science in General Education, which created a project to collect materials to use in the teaching of history of science. He argued for the English translation of historical texts that traced the history of the sciences. He had a hobby as an avid book collector, and he donated much of his collection to the Yale Medical Historical Library. He also added his own work to these collections. He wrote biographies for Harvey Cushing, Benjamin Silliman, Robert Boyle, Girolamo Fracastoro, Richard Lower, John Mayow, Kenelm Digby, and Joseph Priestley. Fulton also discovered early publications of Ambroise Paré, a surgeon who lived in the 16th century. Primate physiology Fulton created the first primate research laboratory in the United States. Through the 1930s, he and other scientists did comparative studies on functional localization in the cerebral cortex. They found that lesioning the prefrontal cortex created calming effects in the monkeys. Fulton proposed, but did not implement, the idea of using this technique on humans to relieve mental diseases.Fulton, John Farquhar \\"Frontal Lobotomy and Affective Behavior: A Neurophysiological Analysis\\", W. W. Norton & Company, Inc, 1951. Fulton's team's findings influenced Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz, who developed the medical practice of the frontal lobotomy in humans and who won the Nobel Prize for his work in 1949. Fulton's work in the field of neurophysiology brought about the creation of the Journal of Neurophysiology in 1938. World War II The impact of Fulton's studies in neurophysiology extended to the military during World War II. Fulton created the Yale Aero-Medical Research Unit, which lasted from 1940-1951. It made great progress in the fields of aviation medicine as well as high- altitude flying, which caused Fulton to be awarded various honors (below).

In addition to scores of research papers, booklets and pamphlets, he published over two dozen full-length volumes of historical value.Sikh Achievers,page-43 Early life Dr. Ganda Singh was born on 15 November 1900, at Hariana, a town in Hoshiarpur district of British Punjab. He was schooled in the local Government Middle School and then the D.A.V. Middle School. He matriculated from Government High School, Hoshiarpur. Then he went to the Forman Christian College, Lahore. Researcher and Historian In October 1931 began Dr Ganda Singh's long and fruitful career as a researcher and historian. The Khalsa College, Amritsar placed him in charge of its newly created Sikh History Research Department, a position he kept till 1949. During this period he travelled extensively, rummaging various public libraries, archives and private collections throughout India in quest of materials on Sikh history, enriching the library of his department. He also brought out several books and articles based on these. In 1938, he had been appointed a corresponding member of Indian Historical Records Commission of Government of India, and was a full member of the Commission from 1950 to 1956. In 1949, he was appointed Director of Archives and Curator of Museum under the Government of Patiala and East Punjab States Union. In 1950 he received the additional charge of Director of the Punjabi Department. His thesis on Afghan warlord Ahmad Shah Durrani earned him the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from the Punjab University, Chandigarh, in 1954, as well as much applause from scholars and historians, including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. Dr Ganda Singh was principal of the Khalsa College, Patiala, when he was invited by the Punjabi University, Patiala, to organize its Department of Punjab Historical Studies. in 1965, he set up Punjab History Conference. In 1967, he launched the University's journal, the biannual The Panjab Past and Present, of which he was the editor. He was nominated member of Punjab Regional Committee for the Survey of Historical Records, Government of Punjab, Lahore, and of Indian Historical Records Commission, Government of India. He was secretary of the Committee for the History of Freedom Movement in PEPSU, Patiala, and chairman of the Regional Records Survey Committee for History of Freedom Movement, Shimla/Patiala, from November 1957 to December 1962. He held membership of The Asiatic Society, Calcutta, Indian Institute of Historical Studies, Calcutta, Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland and Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, Pune. He presided over the medieval section of Punjab History Conference session of the Institute of Historical Studies, Calcutta, held at Shillong in 1974 as well as over its 13th session held at Panaji (Goa) in 1975. In 1974, he presided the 35th session of Indian History Congress at Jadavpur. Awards The Government of India honoured him with Padma Bhushan award in 1984. He had two honorary degrees of Doctor of Letters awarded to him, by Aligarh Muslim University on 19 December 1964 and by Punjabi University on 25 February 1978. The Punjab Government invested him with the Award for Literature on 31 March 1963. On 28 March 1964, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee officially commended him. \\"Sikh Educational Conference\\" honoured him during its 52nd annual session held at Kanpur on 25–27 October 1974, and Punjabi University, Patiala, at the annual session of the Punjab History Conference held during November 1976.

The first family was identified in Ogden, Utah, with five affected boys in two generations of family members. A mutation was identified as a c.109T>C (p.Ser37Pro) variant in NAA10, a gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the major human N-terminal acetyltransferase enzyme system (NatA). This same mutation was identified in a second unrelated family, with three affected boys in two generations. This severe genetic disorder has provisionally been named Ogden Syndrome, as this is the city where the first affected family resides.  Signs and symptoms This is an X-linked condition affecting males and characterized by postnatal growth failure with developmental delays and dysmorphic features characterized by wrinkled forehead, anterior and posterior fontanels, prominent eyes, large down- slanting palpebral fissures, thickened or hooded eyelids, large ears, flared nares, hypoplastic alae nasi, short columella, protruding upper lip, and microretrognathia. There is also delayed closing of fontanelle, and the boys also have broad great toes. Skin is characterized by redundancy or laxity with minimal subcutaneous fat, cutaneous capillary malformations, and very fine hair and eyebrows. Death resulted from cardiogenic shock following arrhythmia, which was noted in all affected individuals. The boys had heart rhythm abnormalities and craniofacial abnormalities, which accounted for their similar appearance. The boys were never able to sit up on their own, and none learned how to talk. They all had a characteristically aged appearance, earning them the family nickname of “little old men.” Several of the boys had structural anomalies of their hearts including ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, and pulmonary artery stenosis. Events recorded on electrocardiogram before death included torsades de pointes, premature ventricular contraction (PVC), premature atrial contraction (PAC), supraventricular tachycardia (SVtach), and ventricular tachycardia (Vtach). Most of the children had inguinal hernias, and the majority had, at least, unilateral cryptorchidism. All had neonatal hypotonia progressing to hypertonia, and cerebral atrophy on MRI; several, but not all, had neurogenic scoliosis. Death occurred prior to 2 years in all cases and prior to 1 year in the majority. There are extensive clinical details for each child reported in the original publication  Biochemistry  Ogden Syndrome is a lethal X-linked recessive condition. Because the affected gene is on the X-chromosome, it affects only males. It was the first reported human genetic disorder linked with a mutation in an N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) gene. Males have the Ser37Pro (S37P) mutation in the gene encoding NAA10, the catalytic subunit of NatA, the major human enzyme heterodimer involved in the post-translational acetylation of proteins. The S37P mutation swaps one amino acid for another, a serine for a proline, in just one part at the end of the resulting NatA protein subunit. This mutation changes the structure of the protein, which makes it less effective at N-terminal acetylation than the normal protein, causing a multitude of effects for the baby, as N-terminal acetylation is one of the most common protein modifications in humans, occurring on approximately 80% of all human proteins. Diagnosis Whole exome sequencing is the definitive diagnostic method used to confirm OS. Treatment Palliative care is the only option as the disease has no cure and appears to be universally fatal with death occurring before three years of age.  History  Halena Black had her first son, Kenny Rae, in 1979. Being that he was her first born child, Black did not notice that something was wrong. Kenny Rae Black passed in 1980, right before his first birthday and was the first known infant to die from Ogden Syndrome. However, it did not end there. Halena Black continued to have children and in 1987 she had her next boy, Hyrum. From the start, Black noticed that Hyrum had the same characteristics as Kenny Rae but thought it was due to the fact that they were brothers. It did not cross her mind that they could share the same underlying disease. Like Kenny Rae, Hyrum passed before his first birthday. It was only until Black's daughters began having children of their own that she realized something was not right. The sons born to Black's daughters looked identical to her own sons and that was when Halena sought medical help. Answers came thirty years after Kenny Rae's death. Ogden Syndrome was discovered in 2011 by a team of researchers led by Gholson J. Lyon, consisting of: Alan F. Rope, Kai Wang, Rune Evjenth, Jinchuan Xing, Jennifer J. Johnston, Jeffrey J. Swensen, W. Evan Johnson, Barry Moore, Chad D. Huff, Lynne M. Bird, John C. Carey, John M. Opitz, Cathy A. Stevens, Tao Jiang, Christa Schank, Heidi Deborah Fain, Reid J. Robison, and 10 others. Just before Lyon was about to publish his findings, another team researching a family living mainly in California contacted him. The newly found family had also lost three infant boys all with similar characteristics. Lyon tested the new family and found they shared the same rare mutation as the Black family. The existence of another family made this mutation a syndrome, and not something isolated.

Developed within a social-cognitive framework, achievement goal theory proposes that students’ motivation and achievement-related behaviors can be understood by considering the reasons or purposes they adopt while engaged in academic work. The focus is on how students think about themselves, their tasks, and their performance. In general, an individual can be said to be “mastery” or “performance” oriented, based on whether one's goal is to develop one's ability or to demonstrate one's ability, respectively. Achievement orientations have been shown to be associated with individuals’ academic achievement, adjustment, and well-being. Brief history Research on achievement motivation can be traced back to the 1940s following the seminal work of David McClelland and colleagues who established the link between achievement and motivations (see need for achievement). Students’ achievement orientations were shown to be predictive of academic performance, specifically, students with high achievement orientation tended to value competence, expect success and seek challenges, while students with low achievement motivation tended to expect failure and avoid challenges. In an effort to better understand the mechanisms underlying achievement, personality and social psychology researchers expanded McClelland's work by examining how cognitive representations shape social experiences. Personality researchers have explored aspects of achievement motivation as an aspect of identity, whereas social psychologists have focused on the thought patterns that arise across various contexts. Two-factor model Significant research and a consistent pattern of results have demonstrated that an individual's achievement orientation in a particular domain can be characterized by one of two distinct achievement profiles: mastery orientation or performance orientation. Mastery orientation A mastery orientation is characterized by the belief that success is the result of effort and use of the appropriate strategies. Mastery oriented individuals strive to develop their understanding and competence at a task by exerting a high level of effort. Across numerous studies, mastery orientation has been shown to promote adaptive patterns of learning, which ultimately lead to high academic achievement and adjustment. For example, students with a mastery orientation are more intrinsically motivated to learn, use deeper cognitive strategies, and persist through challenge and failure. Performance orientation A performance orientation is characterized by the belief that success is the result of superior ability and of surpassing one's peers. Performance oriented individuals desire to outperform others and demonstrate (validate) their ability. Performance orientation is predictive of negative affect, avoidance of challenge and poor achievement outcomes. Four-factor model More recent conceptualizations of achievement orientation have added an additional element. The traditional mastery and performance orientations are broken down to include approach and avoidance components, resulting in four distinct achievement profiles: mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, and performance- avoidance. A mastery-approach orientation describes individuals who are focused on learning as much as possible, overcoming challenges through hard work, or increasing their competence at a task. A mastery-avoidance orientation describes individuals who want to avoid doing worse than they have done before or failing to learn as much as possible. A performance-approach orientation describes individuals who want to demonstrate and prove to others their high ability. A performance-avoidance orientation describes individuals who strive to avoid looking incompetent, or less able than their peers by cultivating an appearance of effortless achievement. Implicit theories of intelligence Epistemological beliefs of intelligence refer to an individual's belief about the nature of intellectual ability, specifically, is intelligence a fixed characteristic, or is it a malleable quality? Individuals conceptions of intelligence have been shown to influence cognitive and motivational factors associated with achievement orientation and ultimately academic performance. Entity If an individual has an entity (also referred to as “fixed”) view of intelligence, they believe that intelligence is an unchanging characteristic and are more likely to think effort plays little to no role in outcome. In other words, you are either smart, or you are not. This is particularly maladaptive in academia. Students believe that effort is unnecessary because if you are smart, everything should come easy, and if you are not smart, hard work cannot compensate for this deficiency. Students with an entity view of intelligence are more likely to develop a fear of failure, resulting in the avoidance of “intellectual tasks,” and giving up in the face of difficulty. The rationale is that if you are smart, effort is unnecessary, and if you are not, there is nothing you can do to change this. Incremental In opposition to entity theory, individuals with an incremental (also referred to as “flexible,” and “malleable”) view of intelligence believe that intelligence is adjustable. The belief is that intelligence is the result of hard work and the use of the appropriate strategies. This is particularly adaptive because rather than giving up in the face of failure or challenge, those who endorse an incremental view of intelligence interpret these setbacks as inevitable for learning to take place. Because they are not worried that exertion of effort is a reflection of lack of intelligence, they are not afraid to work hard, resulting in an outperformance of their entity theory peers. Even after several years, the effect is consistent, such that students with an incremental view of intelligence academically outperform students who had an entity view of intelligence. Mindsets Mindset refers to an individual's belief about oneself and one's most basic qualities, such as talent, intelligence, and personality. Although the majority of research on mindsets has focused primarily on how they affect educational achievement, mindsets have also been shown to be influential in athletics, health and well-being, business and relationships. Fixed Fixed mindsets are characterized by the belief that one's basic qualities are fixed – as if genetically predetermined. Individuals with fixed mindsets believe that practice has no relationship to performance success, which has been shown to be maladaptive across domains. Growth Growth mindsets are characterized by the belief that talents and abilities are things that are developed through effort, practice and instruction. Individuals with growth mindsets feel that they control their success, rather than external forces, so they are better able to problem solve and persist through setbacks. Research has shown that growth mindsets foster a more positive attitude toward practice and learning, a desire for feedback, a greater ability to deal with setbacks, and significantly better performance over time. Why foster a growth mindset in students? Dweck (2010) explains, when students view intelligence as something that develops over time they view challenging work as an opportunity to learn and grow. These students value effort and realize that “even geniuses have to work hard to develop their abilities and make their contributions” (p. 16). Students with this type of attitude are able to respond to obstacles, try new strategies and continue to learn and grow in many situations, which leads to higher achievement. How to foster to a growth mindset in students In order to foster a growth mindset, teachers need to encourage students to welcome challenges and view it as an opportunity to learn and grow . The following are a list of ways a teacher can create a culture of risk taking: * Provide encouragement: praise students for their perseverance, strategies and the choices they made, rather than being told they are ‘smart’ as it tells students that what they did has led them to success and can be used again to be successful in the future * Emphasize that the deepest and best learning takes time: \\"…portray challenges as fun and exciting and easy tasks as boring and less useful for the brain\\" (p. 17). Students who work hard and value effort in the learning process will be able to develop their abilities on a deeper level. * Illustrate growth: provide students with opportunities to write about, and share with one another, something that they used to struggle with and are now good at doing. This allows students to notice their own successes, which motivates their learning. Long term success of growth mindset Designing and presenting learning tasks that foster a growth mindset in students, leads to long-term success. Growth mindsets promote a love of learning and highlight progress and effort. Teachers that illustrate meaningful work help students gain the tools they need to find confidence in their learning and be successful in future challenges.  Influencing factors  Achievement orientations have been shown to be influenced by a combination of cognitive-motivational and contextual factors. Praise One factor that has been shown to be influential in the development of achievement orientations is the type of praise given to individuals. Type of praise not only affects behaviors, beliefs, emotions and outcomes immediately after it is imparted, but has also been shown to have long term consequences. Specifically, it affects how individuals deal with future difficulties and their willingness to apply effort to challenges that may come their way. Verbal praise is often administered as a way to reinforce the performance or behavior of individuals and although there may be positive intentions, some types of praise can have debilitating implications for the recipient. The specific distinction lies in what the praise is directed towards. Process praise is focused on the actions taken by the individual, especially their effort and problem solving strategies, such as “Great job! You’re working really hard.” Process praise reinforces the association between success and effort (or behavior) rather than a fixed ability, which cultivates the more adaptive mastery orientation and incremental view of intelligence. Person praise is focused on the individual themselves, similar to an affirmation of self-worth, such as, “Wow, you’re so smart.” Because it applauds the individual by applying a label or an unchangeable characteristic, person praise promotes a performance orientation and a fixed view of intelligence. Students are being rewarded, through praise, for their performance based on their ability. Children who are given person praise tend to have worse task performance, more low-ability attributions, report less task enjoyment and exhibit less task persistence, than children who are given process praise. Additionally, person praise is more likely to promote helpless responses to subsequent failures than process praise. Although praise for intelligence is usually well-intentioned, and can be motivating when students are doing well, it backfires when students eventually face work that is difficult for them. When this happens, the failure is a threat to the person's sense of his or her own intelligence—a situation to avoid. Thus, praise for intelligence is a short-term strategy that makes successful students feel good at the moment, but one that is detrimental to students in the longer run.  Age  Age is a significant factor in predicting an individual's achievement orientation, with younger individuals more likely to adopt a mastery orientation. Beginning at the transition to middle school, students tend to exhibit a performance orientation, along with an overall decline in academic motivation across adolescence. This follows the developmental propensity to view intelligence as a fixed characteristic in adulthood.  Gender  Supporting the gender disparities in STEM fields, previous research has suggested that females develop a motivational orientation that is maladaptive to high academic achievement, particularly in math and science. However, overall, the research examining gender differences in achievement orientation has been conflicting. For example, research by Carol Dweck has shown gender differences with females being more extrinsic or performance oriented. On the other hand, other studies have found that females are more likely to be mastery oriented, while males are more likely to hold performance orientations. Despite the lack of uniformity among research findings, there is a general consensus that gender influences the development of different rationales and motivations for behavior, as a result of unique socialization expectations and experiences. These differences then affect the way students approach learning situations, leading to gender-related differences in achievement orientations. Although several studies have hypothesized this effect, there is a lack of conclusive evidence, which warrants further exploration into gender differences among individuals’ achievement orientations. Parents and peers Social influences, particularly parents and peers, affect the achievement orientation of students. During early and middle childhood, the achievement beliefs, attitudes and expectations of a child's parents carries significant weight in determining his or her achievement orientation. As children transition to middle school, fitting in with one's peers becomes high priority. Peers influence achievement orientation because children adopt academic goals and beliefs consistent with the dominant social norms. Adolescents with friends having high academic aspirations tend to have fewer problems academically. Implications Achievement orientations play a critical role in explaining academic performance. An individual's achievement orientation has a significant impact on his or her cultivation of new skills, and thus has important implications for educators. Classroom environments that foster comparison between students lead those students to develop performance-oriented attitudes toward education. Specifically, learning in a competitive environment leads students to become more performance oriented and more likely to sacrifice learning opportunities to be positively evaluated. Conversely, a non-competitive, collaborative environment allows students to value learning rather than immediate performance success.

Background: The Three Chapters Dispute  Maxentius success in being elected to the office of the Patriarch of Aquileia occurred after the period known as the Three Chapters dispute. The Three Chapters dispute had roots early in 551. However, the dispute did not pose a threat until it became a significant issue in the eyes Lombard Church at beginning of the 554s. Some argue that the Three Chapters dispute was essential a schism, a division caused by strong opposition towards beliefs or theological orthodoxy between two parties. Around 551 there was initial proclamation by Justinian I that condemned certain parts of theocratic works and beliefs of the Chalcedonian orthodox in the capital of Constantinople. In response, the Chalcedonian orthodox doctrine issued their own interpretation of the relationship between the divinity and human nature of Jesus Christ. The Chalcedonian orthodox argued that Jesus has two natures, one human and one divine and that these two natures subsisted together.The Chalcedonian Creed in English- http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/chalcedonian_definition.htm Justinian I's condemnation on specific issues of the council of the Chalcedonian orthodoxy was received badly in the West. In Rome, the Papacy eventually fell to Justinian I's decision on the condemnation of the Chalcedonian orthodoxy. This in turn led to the Northern Italian churches of Aquileia and Milan excommunicating the papacy for its decision to support Justinian I.Literacy in Lombard Italy, c. 568-774. The Early Lombards and their settlement in Italy, 80 The conflict between the Northern Italian church and Justinian I's position, and the papacy manifested itself in a debate that would unexpectedly threaten the unity of Christianity.J. Herrin, The Formation of Christendom (Princeton,1987) 119-27,199 In particular, the conflict of The Three Chapter's dispute resulted in the Church of the Aquileia splitting in two. There was the ‘new’ Aquileia in Grado, which was pro-Roman, and there was the ‘old’ Aquileia church which retained its loyalty to the Chalcedonian orthodox and wished to be under the protection of the Lombard King.MGH SRL Ep.III, 393 G. Cuscito, Cristianensomo antico ad Aquileia e in Istria The re shuffling of allegiance led to a “degree of cultural separation from Rome.”Literacy in Lombard Italy, c. 568-774. The Early Lombards and their settlement in Italy, 83.  Aftermath and Appointment of Patriarch  The conflict caused by the schism of the Three Chapters lasted long enough that by the eighth century the dispute had become buried underneath diluted political and theological debate that even Paul the Deacon himself, had little knowledge of what or why or even where the debate was headed.Cf. HL III.20, Helias, ‘refused to accept the Three Chapters of the Chalcedonian synod’ The conflict led to old Aquileia to be viewed less favorably by the Church of Rome and by some extent the Imperial capital of Byzantium. It was not until 698, pressure from Pope Sergius I, and no doubt the papacy's geopolitical location of Grado led to the shift of Aquileia to readopt the Roman papacy's orthodox. However, this further led to another conflict to arise whereas Aquileia and Grado, while now technically in communion belonged to two separate kingdoms, with Aquileia still being the center of Lombard rule in the North, and Grado, the vision of the Byzantium's Imperial rule. In 811, after the death of Ursus, the patriarch of Aquileia, Maxentius was appointed the title of Patriarch of Aquileia. With this title, he was able to lead the church of Aquileia to great prominence. Maxentius's dedication to the church was followed by political, social development with minor urban growth. Maxentius dedication to his new title thus allowed Aquileia to move from the ‘rebel’ status that it once had into more favorable view and started to gain support from the Imperial capital and rising momentum of benefits from the Emperor himself.G. Lorenzoni, The Art of the Patriarchate of Aquileia from the ninth century to the thirteenth century , Padua 1968, 23  Aquileia under Maxentius  Maxentius's development of Aquileia gained the attention of the Byzantine Empire, especially in the 9th century. So much to say it was the vastly gaining the preference as the papacy's preferred city in the West.L. Salierno, The Church of the Pagans of Aquileia: the story through the sources in historical memories forogiuliesi , LXXXI (2001), 95-100 Maxentius implemented ecclesiastical doctrine and legislature that allowed for a surge in economic recovery leading to further theological growth and instilling heavier political establishment of the Imperial will. Aquileia had not seen such a growth in its economy or favor from the Byzantium empire since Maxentius had been appointed the title of Patriarch. Maxentius soon became a favorite of Charlemagne, and they frequently exchanged letters. In these letters, Charlemagne expressed his wishes for the continuing growth of theological prominence in Aquileia. The letters covered areas such as baptismal rites and the ceremony of communion and how they should be conducted. Charlemagne's hoped that Maxentius would closely follow these rituals which were also followed by the Imperial capital and set down by the Papacy.J. D. C. Fisher, Baptism in the Medieval West: A Study in the Disintegration of the Primitive Rite of Initiation, 70-71 By agreeing and enforcing the will of Charlemagne and his advisors, Maxentius helped Aquileia to gain territories and gifts from the diocese. Aquileia's prominence was continually favored by Charlemagne's successors and soon led to Aquileia being one of the largest dioceses in Northern Italy having the full support of the Carolingians. In 826, Maxentius was unable to stand the city of Grado. This was due to Maxentius only seeing Grado as a retreat for the patriarchs of Aquileia and he felt that Grado had no claims to Istria or its existence as a legitimate metropolitan city.Everett, Nicholas ‘Paulinus, The Carolgingians and Famosissima Aquileia’ 146. Maxentius, aware that he would have the backing from the Emperors in the West, went on the mission for Grado to concede to the city of Aquileia. Maxentius, with the added pressure from the Carolingian Emperor, demanded the patriarchal title of the bishop of Grado to be removed and Grado be subjugated to the diocese of Aquileia. The success of these demands demonstrated the power and favor which Maxentius was able to single- handedly build with the Carolingians. With Grado now under the control of the diocese of Aquileia, Maxentius had built an influential and powerful diocese that had vast territories and the full backing of the Carolingian Emperor, Louis the Pious. After Grado was subjected to the diocese of Aquileia, Maxentius began the reconstruction of the patriarchal basilica. Some suggest that the construction of the basilica would have only been possible under Maxentius reign as patriarch of Aquileia. Aquileia was now able to fund the construction of monuments with the financial backing of the Caroligians. The Basilica was an extravagant piece of work in the East and had significant influence from the Byzantine backing in the West. The floors were beautifully decorated with a “mixed system of mosaic and marble slabs and the decorations of the steps of the episcopal are attributable to Maxentius.” The eastern side of the Basilica was built in a semicircular apse to which Maxentius added two side chapels. On the west side, Maxentius built an atrium to the basilica and baptistery. Maxentius further ordered for the excavation so that a crypt could be built underneath which may hold the relics of Saint Hermagoras and his deacon Fortunatus.  Death and legacy  While sources are unclear of how Maxentius died, the sources suggest that Maxentius died around the 830s-40s. Maxentius ability to raise Aquileia from the ashes of its destruction by Attila into becoming one of the Carolingians Empire's most treasured cities in the West illustrates his ability to combine politics and theology to achieve greatness. However, due to his dealings with Grado, many of Maxentius opponents criticized his actions as “poisonous.”Everett, Nicholas ‘Paulinus, The Carolgingians and Famosissima Aquileia’ 149 References Category:Year of birth unknown Category:837 deaths Category:Patriarchs of Aquileia ","title":"Maxentius of Aquileia"},{"id":"41067335","text":"Nanotopography refers to specific surface features which form or are generated at the nanoscopic scale. While the term can be used to describe a broad range of applications ranging from integrated circuits to microfluidics, in practice it typically applied to sub-micron textured surfaces as used in biomaterials research.  In nature  Several functional nanotopographies have been identified in nature. Certain surfaces like that of the lotus leaf have been understood to apply nanoscale textures for abiotic processes such as self- cleaning. Bio-mimetic applications of this discovery have since arrived in consumer products. In 2012, it was recognized that nanotopographies in nature are also used for antibiotic purposes. The wing of the cicada, the surface of which is covered in nanoscale pillars, induces lysis of bacteria. While the nano-pillars were not observed to prevent cell adhesion, they acted mechanistically to stretch microbial membranes to breakage. In vitro testing of the cicada wing demonstrated its efficacy against a variety of bacterial strains.  Manufacturing  Numerous technologies are available for the production of nanotopography. High-throughput techniques include plasma functionalization, abrasive blasting, and etching. Though low cost, these processes are limited in the control and replicability of feature size and geometry. Techniques enabling greater feature precision exist, among them electron beam lithography and particle deposition, but are slower and more resource intensive by comparison. Alternatively, processes such as molecular self-assembly can be utilized which provide an enhanced level of production speed and feature control.  Applications to medicine  Though the effects of nanotopography on cell behavior have only been recognized since 1964, some of the first practical applications of the technology are being realized in the field of medicine. Among the few clinical applications is the functionalization of titanium implant surfaces with nanotopography, generated with submersion etching and sand blasting. This technology has been the focal point of a diverse body of research aimed at improving post-operative integration of certain implant components. The determinant of integration varies, but as most titanium implants are orthopedics-oriented, osseointegration is the dominant aim of the field.  Applications to cell engineering  Nanotopography is readily applied to cell culture and has been shown to have a significant impact on cell behavior across different lineages. Substrate features in the nanoscale regime down to the order of 9 nm are able to retain some effect. Subjected solely to topographical cues, a wide variety of cells demonstrate responses including changes in cell growth and gene expression. Certain patterns are able to induce stem cells to differentiate down specific pathways. Notable results include osteogenic induction in the absence of media components as well as near-total cell alignment as seen in smooth muscle. The potential of topographical cues to fulfill roles otherwise requiring xeno-based media components offers high translatability to clinical applications, as regulation and cost related to animal-derived products constitutes a major roadblock in a number of cell-related technologies.

It is also referred to as Coral Lake () due to its zigzagging shoreline. The reservoir was designed by engineer Yoichi Hatta and was the largest in Asia at the time of its completion in 1930. Overview Construction of the Wusanto Reservoir began in 1920 and was completed in 1930. The goal of the project was to provide irrigation for over 100-thousand hectares of farmland in the Chianan area. After construction of the reservoir, the irrigation plain became an important producer of rice for consumption in Taiwan and Japan, with three rice harvests possible each year. Engineering The reservoir was built in conjunction with the Chianan Canal, also designed by Hatta. At the time of its completion, Wusanto Reservoir was the largest reservoir in Asia and the third largest in the world. Construction of the reservoir and of the Wusanto Dam used an uncommon semi-hydraulic fill technique, where fine-grained material is placed at the end of an embankment and then washed into its desired position using jets of water; this is a variant of the hydraulic fill technique. Wusanto Reservoir is the only project constructed with the semi-hydraulic fill technique that is still in use anywhere in the world. This process was expensive and time-consuming, but produced a dam which has proven resistant to Taiwan's severe seismic activity. Scenic area Today, the Wusanto Reservoir Scenic Area is a popular tourist destination in Tainan. The area includes a memorial and museum for Yoichi Hatta. Cherry blossom viewing is a popular event in spring. The area is also known for its abundant native flora and fauna.

It has a square head and 12-segmented antennae with club-like tips. Each mandible has three large teeth and a much smaller fourth tooth. The body is mostly smooth and shiny with erect setae. The queen ant is between long and tawny in color with a brown abdomen. The head is more rectangular. The setae on the front part of the body are more curved and those on the abdomen are more flat than erect. This species is similar to Trichomyrmex robustior and Trichomyrmex mayri, which are darker in color, and M. latinode, which has five teeth per mandible instead of four.Monomorium destructor: similar species. Global Invasive Species Database. ISSG. Biology The colonies of this species are polygyne, having multiple queens. Colonies can be established in trees, in the soil, or inside buildings. They have been found in potted plants, lawns, and irrigated fields. In cooler climates, especially outside the tropics, colonies are often found in heated buildings. The ant has been known to nest inside power sockets and computers. Workers forage slowly, traveling in narrow trails. It is a generalist species in terms of diet, gathering living and dead insects, insect eggs, nectar, seeds, and almost any food item available in households. In trials of baits, the ant was most attracted to soybean oil and white bread, and clearly preferred peanut butter over honey. This ant tends sap-sucking insects to retrieve their honeydew, but it does not have the strong mutualistic relationship with these insects that many other ants do. As a pest Queen and worker In some regions this is a major pest species. Foraging workers chew through non-nutritive materials, such as fabric, rubber, and plastic. They have been observed chewing up tires and polystyrene cups. They can damage cables and electrical insulation, causing malfunctions in electrical equipment and telecommunications systems. The ant has been known to short out the ignition systems in cars and has been responsible for car and house fires. The ant sometimes attacks living animals and people, inflicting painful bites. People have complained of being attacked by swarms while sleeping in bed, and the ant may bite sleeping babies and children. A researcher describing a laboratory infestation in 1922 reported that the ants killed a number of caged lab rats and attacked the resident scientists, \\"biting out small pieces of skin\\" and delivering enough bites to one man to knock him unconscious for a short time. Residents of Cape Verde call it the \\"ninja ant\\" because of the species' silent aggression toward humans. Early introductions of the ant came by sea. It was infesting ships and harassing steamer passengers by 1922. Today it is sometimes also transported by airplane. Shipments of many kinds of freight can contain nests, including containers, produce, lumber, live plants, and electrical equipment. In 2005, a man unknowingly brought the ant home to New Zealand from Fiji, where he had purchased an iPod. The packaging was thought to contain an active nest.Arthur, C. iPod infestation almost dooms New Zealand. The Register September 2, 2005. While it is considered to be invasive, it rarely has negative effects on native fauna or habitat. It most often invades urban areas and it is not generally a dominant or competitive species in ant communities.

The Sri Lankan army massacred the Tamils during the final phase of the war between Tamil Eelam freedom fighters (LTTE) and Sri Lankan armed forces at Mullivaikkal in 2009. The Mullivaikal memorial is in the Thanjavur District of the Tamil Nadu State of the Indian sub-continent. On 6th November 2013, the inauguration of The Mullivaikal memorial took place.[2] The Tamil nationalist leader Pazha Nedumaran and the World Tamil Confederation Trust he heads is the founder.[3] History Pazha Nedumaran inaugurating the memorial Construction The construction of the memorial had initially began on 15 November 2010, and the foundation stone was laid by Mr.Vaiko and Mr.Nallakannu. The Mullivaikal memorial was originally intended as merely a memorial pillar, but owing to increasing desecration of the Tamil memorials in Sri Lanka, a larger construction was chosen to memorialize the bloody civil strife that had killed so many Tamils in Sri Lanka throughout history. The construction of the memorial was commissioned by the Ulaga Tamil Peravai (World Tamil Confederation) and was supervised by Pazha Nedumaran, the founder and the chief of the Confederation, as well as the Tamil National Movement. According to Nedumaran, Funds to build the memorial were raised from various sources, says Nedumaran. The land for the memorial and a major portion of the capital cost was donated by noted Tamil activist M. Natarajan, once a student protester against the anti-hindi movement Tamil Nadu and later Chief editor of Tamilarasi magazine. Inauguration The inauguration of the memorial took place on 6 November 2013, two days ahead of the originally scheduled date. The inauguration saw the participation of several leading politicians and activists of the state, such as Nallakannu(CPI), Vaiko Mdmk Chief, Seeman(Chief co-ordinator of the Naam Tamilar Katchi), SP Udayakumar (Kudankulam activist) and Pon Radhakrishnan(BJP). Memorial=Sculptural features The Mullivaikkal Muttram has come into shape through contributions of sculptors and artists from far and wide. The sculptures have been fashioned based on the line drawings rendered by artist Veera Santhanam and have been carved out by Mamallapuram Sthapathi Murugan and his team. Hundreds of sculptors from across the state carved stone to raise the memorial without taking a fee, according to Nedumaran. A beautiful stone sculpture dedicated to Tamil Pavai (Tamil Mother) holding a lamp commemorating the people who lost their lives at Mullivaikal, constitutes the central part of the memorial. The statue carved out of a single stone weighs more than 60 tonnes and is mounted on a 15-feet pedestal. The Pavai is representative of the best of Tamil womanhood, culture, and ethos. Beneath the Tamil Mother Goddess statue, soil which is blood soaked from Mullivaikal kept in two glass vessels. Pupils pay respect to the glass vessel to honour the sacrifice made by Eelam people and Eelam freedom fighters (LTTE). Two friezes, each 55 feet long and 10 feet tall, stand on either side of the Pavai. One of them showcases the 20 young men in Tamil Nadu such as Abdul Rahoof, Muthukumaran, Murugadasan, Pallapatti. Ravi who had self-immolated in support of Tamil Eelam. The other frieze represents the people who had died during the fourth Eelam war. Depiction of Tamil civilians being held behind barbed wires in Sri Lankan IDP Camps Sculptures spread throughout the memorial depict the stories of the Eezham Tamils, from the Burning of Jaffna library in 1983 to the mass massacres they had endured. The sculptures show images of sencholai - a school children massacre, sufferings of internally displaced people in IDP camps in a menik farm and in the IDP camp of kilinoichi, cluster bombing & phosphorus bombing by the Sri Lankan army in a no fire zone, wailing mothers, broken limbs, guns, and dead bodies. Some sculptures also portray the peaceful lives Eezham Tamils led in the island nation and depict their various cultural identities including the national bird and the national tree of Tamil Eelam. There is a sculpture for Charles Antony (approx 24 years old) and Balachandran (12 years old) who died during the 2009 civil war. Art Museum Behind the Pavai is a building that houses portrait and photo galleries. Portraits of the people who lost their lives in the Eelam wars are on display here, among them the Tamil Tigers chief Velupillai Prabhakaran’s parents, Parvathiammal and Thiruvenkatam Velupillai and his two sons Charles Anthony and Balachandran, LTTE ideologue Anton Balasingham, Tamilchelvan, Thileepan, Annai Bhoopathi, Kittu, Balraj, Sivakumaran, Malathi, Miller, Angayarkanni among others. A photo gallery at the memorial's Conference hall houses hundreds of photos of those who dedicated their lives for the cause of Tamil language. The Galleries also exhibit photos of Tamil kings like pandara vanniyan - Vanni Tamil eelam, sangiliyan - Jaffna Tamil Eelam, Kattabomman, Puli Thevan, Velu Nachiyar, Sethupathy, Maruthu Brothers, Theeran Chinamalai who resisted colonial rule. Other photos on display are those of the Tamil scholars and artistes including non-Tamils who have contributed to the development of the language.

Substitution of gives the explicit discretization of the unsteady conductive heat transfer equation. :\\\\frac{T_i ^f - T_i ^{f-1}}{\\\\Delta t} = a \\\\frac{T_{i-1} ^{f-1} - 2T_i ^{f-1} + T_{i+1} ^{f-1}}{h^2} - \\\\epsilon u \\\\frac{T_{i+1} ^{f-1} - T_{i-1} ^{f-1}}{2h} + \\\\frac{Q_i ^{f-1}}{c \\\\rho} where * * is the uniform grid spacing (mesh step) : T_i^f = \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2a\\\\Delta t}{h^2}\\\\right) T_i ^{f-1} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{a \\\\Delta t}{h^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon u \\\\Delta t}{2h}\\\\right) T_{i-1} ^{f-1} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{a \\\\Delta t}{h^2} - \\\\frac{\\\\epsilon u \\\\Delta t}{2h}\\\\right) T_{i+1} ^{f-1} + \\\\frac{Q_i ^{f-1}}{c \\\\rho} \\\\Delta t  Stability criteria  :\\\\begin{align} h &< \\\\frac{2a}{\\\\epsilon u} \\\\ \\\\Delta t &< \\\\frac{h^2}{2a} \\\\end{align} These inequalities set a stringent maximum limit to the time step size and represents a serious limitation for the explicit scheme. This method is not recommended for general transient problems because the maximum possible time step has to be reduced as the square of . = Implicit scheme = In implicit scheme, the temperature is dependent at the new time level . After using implicit scheme, it was found that all coefficients are positive. It makes the implicit scheme unconditionally stable for any size of time step. This scheme is preferred for general purpose transient calculations because of its robustness and unconditional stability.H.Versteeg & W. Malalasekra, \\"an Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics\\" 2009, pages 262–263. The disadvantage of this method is that more procedures are involved and due to larger , truncation error is also larger. = Crank–Nicolson scheme = In the Crank–Nicolson method, the temperature is equally dependent on and . It is a second-order method in time and this method is generally used in diffusion problems.  Stability criteria  :\\\\Delta t < \\\\frac{h^2}{a} This time step limitation is less restricted than the explicit method. The Crank–Nicolson method is based on the central differencing and hence it is second-order accurate in time.H.Versteeg & W. Malalasekra, \\"an Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics\\" 2009, page no. 262.  Finite element solution to convection–diffusion problem  Unlike the conduction equation (a finite element solution is used), a numerical solution for the convection–diffusion equation has to deal with the convection part of the governing equation in addition to diffusion. When the Péclet number (Pe) exceeds a critical value, the spurious oscillations result in space and this problem is not unique to finite elements as all other discretization techniques have the same difficulties. In a finite difference formulation, the spatial oscillations are reduced by a family of discretization schemes like upwind scheme.Ronald W. Lewis, Perumal Nithiarasu & Kankanhally N. Seetharamu, \\"Fundamentals for the finite element method for heat and fluid flow\\". In this method, the basic shape function is modified to obtain the upwinding effect. This method is an extension of Runge–Kutta discontinuous for a convection diffusion equation. For time-dependent equations, a different kind of approach is followed. The finite difference scheme has an equivalent in the finite element method (Galerkin method). Another similar method is the characteristic Galerkin method (which uses an implicit algorithm). For scalar variables, above two methods are identical.

Background Pat McGee was an area legislator of Cattaraugus County who lived in Franklinville, New York, Western New York outdoors: Pat McGee Trail , Classicbuffalo.com, Buffalo, NY: Classicbuffalo.com, Retrieved 13 November 2013 and the trail was named in her memory. McGee served as a member of the New York State Assembly and as a New York State Senator for many years. The trail path lies entirely on a railbed that was used by the New York and Lake Erie Railroad from 1978 to 1990 and, before that, by the Erie Railroad and the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. The existence of the railroad was the primary impetus for the relocation of the county seat of Cattaraugus County to Little Valley. The closure of the Cattaraugus Cutlery Company in 1963 and a factory most recently used by King Windows in the 1980s rendered the railroad of little use to Little Valley, and in 1990 the New York and Lake Erie truncated the rail service to its current end at Setterstix in Cattaraugus. The Cattaraugus Local Development Corporation acquired the railbed several years after the railroad's closure and removed the rails and ties. Under the preliminary name \\"Southern Tier Area Rails to Trails\\" (START), the trail opened for public use in the early 2000s. Description The trail, which was formally dedicated in June 2005 (shortly after McGee's death), includes five trailheads with its main trailhead being located in Little Valley, New York.Enchanted Mountains: Cattaraugus County: Pat McGee Trail, Enchantedmountains.com, Little Valley, NY: Cattaraugus County Tourism, Retrieved 13 November 2013TrailLink by Rails-to-Trails Conservancy: Pat McGee Trail, Traillink.com, Washington, DC: Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, Retrieved 13 November 2013 The trail parallels New York State Route 353 and, in its southern half, the Little Valley Creek. As of 2013, the trail stretches for more than 12 miles, and connects seven municipalities in the area, running between County Route 6 in the town of New Albion (less than a mile south of the Cattaraugus village line) and the boundary of the city of Salamanca. The Finger Lakes Trail (a section of the North Country Trail) intersects the Pat McGee Trail at Woodworth Hollow Road in the hamlet of Elkdale; since a 2017 reroute of the Finger Lakes Trail, it now shares as wrong-way concurrency with the McGee trail from Woodworth Hollow north to the Elkdale State Forest for a distance of . The trail is open to pedestrian, horseback and bicycle traffic during the spring, summer and autumn months and snowmobile traffic in the winter months when conditions permit. Other than snowmobiles, the use of motorized off-road vehicles (except for trail maintenance staff) is prohibited.

Built in the late nineteenth century as the fifth courthouse in Wabash County, it has experienced a series of extensive remodelling projects that have left it with virtually nothing of the original building. County seat history When Edwards County was formed in 1814, Palmyra was named its first county seat; at the time, the county's boundaries embraced nearly half of the present-day state of Illinois, substantial parts of modern Wisconsin, and some parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as far north as the Canadian border.Keen, D.E. \\"The Departed Glories of Old Palmyra: When the Courthouse for Cook County Cost but 6¼ Cents per Year\\". Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society 16.1/2 (1923): 78-84. Palmyra's tenure in this position was short-lived, as the growing population in the county's western portion sparked a county seat war in 1824: violence nearly erupted when the county seat was moved to Albion, but peace was restored when the two sides agreed to work together to convince the Illinois General Assembly to divide Edwards County into two separate counties. This goal was accomplished in December 1824, with Palmyra and other eastern parts of the county being placed within the boundaries of the new Wabash County. However, the law moved the county seat several miles away to Centerville, although within a few years the seat had again been moved, this time to Mount Carmel. Previous courthouses=First courthouse No purpose-built courthouse was ever built in Palmyra; throughout the years that it was the county seat, county officials rented the house of Gervase Hazleton, beginning with a rent of $8 but lowering their annual rent to just 6¼¢ for the entirety of the second year. Second courthouse The second courthouse in the county, and the first after the county's creation, was built in Centerville in 1826. County commissioners contracted with miller Moses Bedell in September 1825 for the construction of a frame courthouse, two stories tall and measuring . After the courthouse was finished nine months later, Bedell was paid $715 for the project.Combined History of Edwards, Lawrence, and Wabash Counties, Illinois: With Illustrations Descriptive of Their Scenery and Biographical Sketches of Some of Their Prominent Men and Pioneers. Philadelphia: McDonough, 1883. As Centerville soon began to fall into oblivion, county officials decided in 1829 to move to the flourishing settlement of Mount Carmel, and the old courthouse was abandoned.Weiser, Dennis. Illinois Courthouses: An Illustrated History. Virginia Beach: Donning, 2009, 146-147. Third courthouse No substantial opposition arose to the idea of moving the county seat to Mount Carmel, except for that of expense, but local resident Scoby Stewart obviated the opposition by offering in March 1829 to donate $4,000 for the construction of a courthouse in the city by March 1831. County officials readily accepted his offer and began soliciting bids for the location. Constructed with a square plan, the two-story building featured a cupola at the center of its hip roof. Entrances were on different sides of the exterior, which was divided into three bays on some sides and two on others. This building lasted until 1857, in which year it was destroyed by fire, along with virtually all of the official records stored therein. Fourth courthouse Contractor Hiram Bell completed a replacement courthouse by the end of 1857 on the site of the previous building. This building, which cost the county $6,770, was a Greek Revival building with an appearance resembling a church with a substantial wing. This building remained until June 1877, when a tornado struck Mount Carmel and destroyed most of the business district; the storm was so fierce that state legislators appropriated $15,000 in relief funds, and it arose so fast that county officials were unaware of its presence until it began knocking down the building, interrupting a routine meeting that they were conducting. Current courthouse Front of the war memorial Plans were created for the construction of the current courthouse as early as June 1879, but the final contract waited nearly two years to be signed. It was built primarily as a brick building, although stone was used for the water table and windowsills, and extensive woodworking was placed in the interior. Towers were constructed, topped with iron fence and accessible via trapdoors from within the building. The resulting Second Empire structure featured three stories of interior space under all but the lowest sections of its mansard roof. During 1959, county officials spent large sums of money on an extensive remodelling project, followed by another project in 1963; the resulting two-story building features a main entrance inside an ell, a few tall rectangular windows on all sides, and a flat roof. Although the current courthouse is technically the same building as the one constructed in 1881, absolutely nothing remains of the original construction, and the courthouse's record in the Illinois Historic Sites Survey Inventory refers to it strictly as \\"2 story ugly brick (recent)\\" without any additional comment.Urbane, Christine. \\"Illinois Historic Sites Survey Inventory: Wabash County Court House Site\\".

It is housed in a former state women's prison and is directly east of the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility (Old Max). History The Museum of Colorado Prisons started operation on June 18, 1988. The idea for a museum was conceived by a group of Fremont County residents. The project began in the early 1980s, with volunteers who sought obtain permission to use the former Women's Prison building, which dated back to 1935. The building is adjacent to the east wall of the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility, an active prison since 1871. The Colorado State Legislature approved the request on April 24, 1986. Canon City in turn granted a 99-year lease to the Foundation to operate a museum in the cell house. A Board of Directors was formed on October 15, 1986. The board set about to raise funds for the museum. The costs included stabilizing the building, upgrading the heating and lighting systems, and adding features that would be accessible for disabled visitors. The museum was able to raise money through grants, lottery proceeds, donations and loans. The cell house was renovated in June 1988. Its opening coincided with the summer tourist season. The cells were restored with a view to preserving the original feel of the cell house from its days as of housing inmates. Artifacts of the Colorado Prison System from 1871 to the present day were collected and catalogued by volunteers. Mission The Museum was established with a view to collect, preserve, conserve, exhibit, and interpret the historical heritage of the Colorado Prison System. The Museum was also opened to serve as an incentive for historical research, education, and scholarly writings on the subject. It was equally meant to be a means to deter criminal activity.

It was released by Southern Lord on 17 September 2013. The album has been noted for its shift from the post-rock of its predecessor towards a sound that more prominently highlights the band's industrial and doom influences. Style Nations to Flames has been described as amongst the most aggressive and fast-paced albums in A Storm of Light's discography. Guitarist and vocalist Josh Graham acknowledged that this has been part of a larger shift for the band: Graham's approach to vocals on Nations to Flames drew comparisons to Killing Joke's Jaz Coleman and departed from the clean singing characteristic of his past approach. Graham confirmed that his approach was developed when the band played songs off of Nations to Flames durings its tour with Converge prior to entering the recording studio. During that tour, Graham said that he \\"realized that what we needed was more aggression and somewhat more atonal vocals,\\" which he described as \\"more akin to Motörhead than Killing Joke\\". Concept The concept underlying the album is, according to Graham, a tale of \\"one possible future of human failure [involving] the collapse of society due to overpopulation and pollution\\". He further detailed the concept as a story humanity \\"realiz[ing] too late that the importance of their government, their nationalism, and their religions meant nothing in relation to the damage we are inflicting on our planet.\\" The concept extends to the album cover art, which portrays what Graham describes as \\"a small surviving group of revolutionaries [who] are biding time until their own demise. The body and the flag represent humanity, and are being ironically sacrificed to the earth...more fire, more smoke, more pollution. They know now that their revolution/realization happened too late, and that the earth will soon be on its own.\\" Further to the concept, the CD insert references Margaret Atwood's 2009 short fiction, \\"Time Capsule Found On the Dead Planet\\", as suggested reading. This piece was written by Atwood as part of the 10:10 global warming mitigation campaign. Reception Nations to Flames generally received favourable reviews, with most critics commenting upon the stylistic departure from the band's previous album. Ray Van Horn, Jr. wrote for Blabbermouth that the album was \\"reflective more of industrial and splatterpunk\\", yet the album \\"is still joined at the hip by those core values of punched-up doom and explorative embellishments\\". Natalie Zina Walschots praised the album in Exclaim! as the band's \\"best release to date\\", and also suggested that \\"the melancholic and atmospheric\\" post-rock elements had been \\"burned away by the mechanical heat of industrial and crushed by the relentless weight of doom\\". Describing the album as \\"the soundtrack to our damnation\\", Matt Hinch described the album for About.com as a \\"lush, fulfilling and diverse affair\\". However, David Maine was more critical of the album in Popmatters, suggesting that \\"listener fatigue\\" diminishes the album concept, with \\"any kind of considered commentary on the society in which we live is lost amid the layers of distortion and double-kick drumming\\".

It is an obligatory social parasite, unable to feed itself or look after the colony and reliant on ants of another species to undertake these tasks. To replenish these servant ants, it raids nearby ant colonies and carries home pupae and larvae, and these are reared to provide future workers for the colony. A newly mated female P. rufescens needs to make its way into one of these \\"host\\" nests, kill the host queen, and be accepted by the host workers in her place. Description P. rufescens workers in western and southwestern Europe are dark red, while eastern specimens are more orange-red. Darker ants often have a purplish or brownish tinge to their gasters and appendages. Morphologically, ants of this species are similar to the Mexican Polyergus topoffi, but have narrower heads and petioles and the first tergites of their gasters are more hairy. The total length of this ant is . Distribution P. rufescens is native to parts of Europe including Spain, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Bulgaria, Italy, Croatia, Serbia, and Slovenia. Its range also extends into Asia as far east as the mountains of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and western China. Its habitat is typically open, sparse grassland, wherever its host species are to be found. The host species vary in different parts of the range and include F. cunicularia, F. fusca, F. rufibarbis, F. clara, F. gagates, and F. cinerea. The main host species in the eastern part of the range is F. clara and in general, the species chosen is the one most abundant in the locality or that can be raided with the least mortality. Behaviour This species is known as the slave-making ant because, like Formica sanguinea, it raids the nests of other species of ant in the subgenus Serviformica and carries their brood back to the dulotic nest (from Greek δοῦλος doulos, \\"slave\\"). A mature Polyergus colony always originated as a colony of the slave species (the hosts), and the worker population is maintained by the raiding sorties of the Amazon ants. In the dulotic nest, the Formica workers usually outnumber the Amazon ant population by at least five to one and in general, the behaviour of the mixed colony resembles that of a large colony of the host species. Molecular analysis has shown that although the two slave-making ant genera Polyergus and Rossomyrmex are closely related, they are even more closely related to their respective host species and the enslaving behaviour has evolved independently. Pierre Huber, the son of the Swiss entomologist François Huber, studied the behaviour of these ants. The P. rufescens workers perform no work apart from nest raiding. So reliant are they on their slaves that without their help, they are incapable of feeding themselves or rearing the young. Huber experimentally put 30 of the slave-making ants in a box with some of their larvae, some pupae, a little soil, and a generous supply of honey. Within two days, half of these ants were dead, presumably of starvation. He then introduced one slave ant into the box. It very soon \\"established order, formed a chamber in the earth, gathered together the larvae, extricated several young ants that were ready to quit the condition of pupae, and preserved the life of the remaining Amazons.\\" Column of marching ants Winged males and females known as alates emerge from the colonies in summer. Some colonies produce alates of both sexes, and in these the males emerge and fly off some days before the females do. Nuptial flights involving both males and females often occur, but males usually depart from any particular nest first and this prevents inbreeding. Observations on the ground show that the female makes certain movements of her mandibles just before mating, and this is thought to release a sexually attractive pheromone. Some females copulate immediately after the nuptial flight, others mate on the ground near the dulotic nest without taking to the air, and a few mate during the course of a slave raid. The female alates lose their wings within a few minutes of mating, and unless involved in a raid, then hide in the undergrowth near their nests. Others set out alone, probably following the trail of a previous slave raid, and are greeted with hostility at any potential target nest they encounter. The majority join a slave raid within a few days of mating, but only some of these attempt to infiltrate the target colony, others returning home with the raiders. Some winged females also accompany the raiders, and a few of these have been observed returning home carrying a cocoon. A newly mated female is unable to found a new colony unaided because she is not able to feed herself or care for her first brood. Instead, she enters the nest of another species of ants. She may join a column of raiding ants and use the panic and confusion surrounding their attack on the target colony to infiltrate the nest. She emits a secretion from the Dufour's gland on her abdomen, named after its discoverer, Léon Jean Marie Dufour, which includes a pheromone which subdues the attacked ants and makes them less aggressive. She seeks out the colony's queen and kills her by biting her with her piercing mandibles. With their queen gone, the behaviour of the resident ants changes and their attacks lessen in ferocity and alternate with periods of grooming the new arrival.

The episode was written by Ryan Murphy and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. In this episode, Fiona (Jessica Lange) must take her life in order to undertake a ritual to find the next Supreme. This episode is rated TV-MA (LV). Angela Bassett, Gabourey Sidibe, Danny Huston, and Patti LuPone guest star as Marie Laveau, Queenie, the Axeman, and Joan Ramsey, respectively. Plot After an encounter with Queenie under an overpass, Zoe and Madison are summoned by Cordelia to plot against Fiona. During the plan, however, a scared Misty appears at the front door, revealing she seeks protection from a witch hunter. She reveals Myrtle - who is now almost fully healed - is with her, who determines that Misty's resurrection abilities mean she is in fact the next Supreme. Luke's mother - Joan - chastises him for visiting the girls at the Academy, making him an enema, and forcing him to strip. At the Academy, Nan hears his screams and wants to help him, but Cordelia wants her assistance in the plot against Fiona. The Coven prepares for the Sacred Taking: a ritual that is invoked to protect the Coven in which the current Supreme takes her own life to ensure the safety of the Coven. Misty is resistant to becoming the next Supreme, though Cordelia assures her no one gets to choose. Fiona - whose health is deteriorating quickly as a result of one of the younger witches obtaining her Supreme powers - discovers Madison in her room, who lies that she is the next Supreme before giving Fiona pills to take her own life. Myrtle appears thereafter, convincing Fiona to do so by casting an illusion over Fiona. Fiona takes the pills and lies in her bed, asking that Myrtle take care of Cordelia. However, she later sees Spalding, who scolds her for taking the \\"coward's way out\\" before telling her the Coven lied to her. Fiona vomits the pills and vows revenge on Spalding's life and her own. Meanwhile, Queenie discretely brings food to an imprisoned Delphine, who begs for release. Marie Laveau arrives and taunts Delphine, who remains proud until Marie Laveau chops off her hand. Nan falls out with Zoe and Madison over their belief that she is not the next Supreme, storming off to pay a visit to Luke. Joan discovers the two of them but is soon shot by a rifle, followed by Luke (who was attempting to protect Nan). Misty appears and Fiona - having surprised the Coven that she is still alive - follows after her, under the belief that Misty is the next Supreme. Fiona challenges Misty to bring Joan back to life, which she does before collapsing. Zoe warns Kyle that the Coven is under attack. Kyle professes his love for Zoe while a distraught Madison listens on. The next morning, Fiona reveals to Cordelia she in fact admires her daughter's attempt to kill her. A package arrives at the Coven, which Fiona opens to discover Delphine's decapitated head, gasping for help. Reception Rotten Tomatoes reports an 81% approval rating, based on 16 reviews.

This article will explore the way attachment patterns are formed, how parents pass on their attachment styles, long-term consequences of attachment patterns, and cross cultural attachment patterns. Origins of attachment The origins of infant attachment can be understood along several different axes: the level of sensitivity in the mother's interactions with her child, the degree to which the mother is rejecting in her interactions with her child, and the level of activity in the mother's interactions with her child. The current body of research on attachment theory suggests that these specific aspects of maternal behavior play a significant role in determining the attachment formed between mother and child both early in development and generally across time. Measures of these characteristics have predicted the type and degree of the infant-mother attachment formed. Higher levels of sensitivity in maternal behavior, as defined by the speed at which the mother detects and responds to slight signals or changes in her infant's behavior or environment, are more likely to result in the formation of a secure attachment. Analyses of interactions observed and measured at several stages during an extended period of infant development (one month, four months, and nine months) show that at all stages mothers of secure infants are more sensitively responsive than mothers of insecure infants, the lowest levels of sensitivity being observed in mother-infant pairs developing an insecure-resistant attachment specifically. High levels of rejecting behavior, as defined by the degree to which a mother affectionately interacts with her child, are more likely to result in the formation of insecure mother- infant attachments. At all three ages of measurement, highly rejecting mothers are more likely to have insecure-resistant one-year-olds, and the infants of mothers who were highly rejecting at nine months are more likely to display avoidance in Ainsworth's Strange Situation experiment.Fraley RC, Spieker SJ. A Taxometric Analysis of Strange Situation Behavior.” Developmental Psychology Vol. 39 (May 2003), pp. 387–404 High levels of activity in maternal interactions with the infant throughout the first year of development are more likely to result in the formation of a secure attachment. Of these factors, maternal sensitivity has been shown to be the most significant in determining the quality of the mother-infant attachment. Mothers who displayed the highest levels of overall sensitivity throughout the first year of development were more likely to have securely attached one-year olds exhibiting low levels of resistance and avoidance in the Strange Situation.Isabella, Russell A. Child Development Vol. 64, No. 2 (Apr., 1993), pp. 605-621 Intergenerational attachment theory One's attachment style shows its impacts on different aspects of their life including the attachment style of their children. Intergenerational attachment theory suggests that a mother's representations of earlier attachment may influence the development of her infant's attachment to her.Shah, P. E., Fonagy, P., & Strathearn, L. (2010). Is Attachment Transmitted Across Generations? The Plot Thickens. Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 15(3), 329-345. Hypothetically, it is expected that a parent who had a secure attachment will most probably end up having a child with secure attachment.The Developmental and Evolutionary Psychology of Intergenerational Transmission of Attachment. Belsky, J. Carter, C. S. (Ed); Ahnert, L. (Ed); Grossmann, K. E. (Ed); Hrdy, S. B. (Ed); Lamb, M. E. (Ed); Porges, S. W. (Ed); Sachser, N. (Ed), (2005). Attachment and Bonding: A New Synthesis. pp. 169-198. Cambridge, MA, US: MIT Press, xiv, 493 Bowlby was especially interested in intergenerational attachment styles. In the separation he states that individuals that have supportive parents grow up to be stable and self-reliant.Bowlby, J., & Ainsworth, M. (2013). The Origins of Attachment Theory. Attachment Theory: Social, Developmental, and Clinical Perspectives, 45. However, research has also shown that the perception of the parent's earlier attachment style is more important than the attachment itself. The ways in which a mother considers her own historical relationship with her primary caregiver is central to the development of her own child's attachment (Ainsworth & Bowlby, 1991; Main, 1990). Research conducted on this subject by Peter Fonagy, Howard Steele and Miriam Steele included a method where parents answered questions about their attachment histories in their early childhood by answering the Adult Attachment Interview. They also stated how those attachment styles influenced their relationship with their own children. Results have shown that autonomous-secure parents gave coherent account of early attachments whereas preoccupied parents emphasized mostly childhood memories that were about conflicts and dismissing parents were generally unable to identify their memories related to their early childhood attachment.Bowlby, J., & Ainsworth, M. (2013). The Origins of Attachment Theory. Attachment Theory: Social, Developmental, and Clinical Perspectives, 45. Consequences of childhood attachment patterns As children grow up, their attachment to their parents continues to evolve and play different roles in their everyday lives. One example of a persistent attachment that changes over the course of an individual's life is the parental bond. Consequences of attachment in familial role reversals The most obvious way a parental attachment changes with age is that parents gradually move from being the care provider to their children to the recipient of care from their children. Because of this “role reversal,” parents experience a “gradual, unhappy relinquishment of autonomy.”Magai, Carol. \\"Attachment in Middle and Later Life.\\" Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research, and Clinical Applications. Ed. Jude Cassidy and Phillip R. Shaver. 2nd ed. New York [etc.]: Guilford, 2008. 532-51. Print. 541 However, the way adult children carry out their new caregiver role is also affected by the original attachment the parents formed with their children. This original attachment pattern can lead to many different results. For example, adult children who formed secure attachment patterns as children are more likely to provide high quality and loving care to their elderly parents than individuals with insecure attachments.Magai, 541 Furthermore, individuals with insecure attachments are far more likely to abuse their role as caregiver and withhold care in order to manipulate their parents.Magai, 541 Also, elderly parents with an insecure-avoidant pattern are less likely to seek care from their children when they are no longer self- sufficient.Magai, 543 Insecure-ambivalent elderly parents are more likely to act in an overly clingy way when they require help.Magai, 543 The consequence of this behavior is that their children tend to isolate themselves from their parents and do not react to their parents’ needs.Magai, 543 These tendencies reveal that patterns of attachment can influence relationships from a very young age all the way to late adulthood. Attachment patterns in peer relationships Another far-reaching consequence of attachment patterns is the method in which adults form and maintain romantic relationships. According to Hazan and Shaver, adults respond to distress based on their experience with the way their environment meets their needs.Hazan, Cindy, and Phillip R. Shaver. \\"Attachment as an Organizational Framework for Research on Close Relationships.\\" Psychological Inquiry 5.1 (1994): 1-22. Print. 15 Hazan and Shaver propose that there are three types of attachment: “consistently responsive, inconsistently responsive, or consistently unresponsive.”Hazan and Shaver, 15 Anxious or ambivalent attachment patterns are brought about by extremely inconsistent relationships early in childhood.Hazan and Shaver, 15 Adults who do not know if their environments will meet their needs often feel the need to compulsively test the levels of commitment from their partners.Hazan and Shaver, 16 This can actually be counter-productive, as the relationships of insecure-ambivalent individual frequently fail.Hazan and Shaver, 16 Insecure avoidant attachment patterns are brought about by consistent unresponsiveness from an individual's environment.Hazan and Shaver, 16 Individuals with this pattern of attachment frequently struggle with developing secure and authentic relationships in adulthood due to their expectation that their needs will not be met in times of distress.Hazan and Shaver, 16 This pattern also leads to tendencies of avoiding intimate relationships through shunning commitments, intense work schedules, and overly pessimistic views of relationships.Hazan and Shaver, 16 Intergenerational transmission of attachment: within and between cultures While numerous studies conducted in recent decades validate John Bowlby's theory of attachment, many of these studies reflect trends in only one culture. Mary Ainsworth further specified the mechanics of Bowlby's theory, when she developed the concepts of secure and insecure attachments. After seeing the results of how American children react to the Strange Situation experiment, where babies are separated and then reunited with their parents, Ainsworth proposed that secure attachment is the dominant response and that insecure attachments, both avoidant and resistant, are clear minorities. A fourth type of attachment, namely disorganized, has since also been accepted as a possible style, though it is rare. However, subsequent studies have shown that there are differences in the distribution of attachment types across cultures. For instance, German children are more likely to be classified as avoidant than children in the United States.Grossmann, K., Grossmann, K. E., Spangler, G., Suess, G., & Unzner, L. (1985). Maternal sensitivity and newborns’ orientation responses as related to the quality of attachment in Northern Germany. In I. Bretherton and E. Waters (Eds.), Growing points of attachment theory and research. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 50(1-2, Serial No. 209), 233-256. Similarly Japanese and Israeli children are more likely to fall into the resistant category of insecure attachments than their American counterparts are.Miyake, K., Chen, S.-J., & Campos, J. J. (1985). Infant temperament, mother’s mode of interaction, and attachment in Japan: An interim report. In I. Bretherton and E. Waters (Eds.), Growing points of attachment theory and research. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 50(1-2, Serial No. 209), 276-297.Sagi, A., Lamb, M. E., Lewkowicz, K. S., Shoham, R., Dvir, R., & Estes, D. (1985).

Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 50(1-2, Serial No. 209), 257-275. However, researchers have more recently argued that these intercultural differences are no more diverse than the intracultural differences found in diverse societies, such as the United States. One argument suggests that “in general, cross-cultural discussions of attachment theory and findings have proposed that there are large cross- cultural differences compared with intracultural differences; however, no empirical studies have addressed this issue.”van Ijzendoorn, M., H. & Kroonenberg, P., M. (1988). Cross-cultural patterns of attachment: A meta- analysis of the strange situation. Child Development, 59 (No. 1), 147. In one study, researchers Marinus van IJzendoorn and Pieter Kroonenberg combined all the rates of the different types of attachment, which have been found in studies conducted throughout the world, to form the average global distribution of the different types of attachment. They found that the distribution in the United States, which Ainsworth first explored, is representative of the global distribution. However, an individual sample from a particular U.S. community is just as likely to reflect the distribution of a foreign country as it is to represent a typical U.S. sample.van Ijzendoorn, M., H. & Kroonenberg, P., M. (1988). Cross-cultural patterns of attachment: A meta-analysis of the strange situation. Child Development, 59 (No. 1), 147-156. This study demonstrates that cross-cultural differences in attachment reflect local customs and not broader differences between countries. In all cultures, secure attachment seems to be preferred, insecure attachments are still present. While the levels of secure attachment may vary in particular cultures, there has not been any data which suggests the universality of attachment theory is invalid.van IJzendoorn, M.H. & Sagi-Schwartz A. (2008). \\"Cross-Cultural Patterns of Attachment; Universal and Contextual Dimensions\\". In Cassidy J, Shaver PR. Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications. New York and London: Guilford Press. pp. 880–905. Since the cross-cultural variance in the transmission of attachment occurs at a local level, the family plays the crucial role in determining what attachment style a child will develop. In general, the more supportive an attachment figure is, the greater the likelihood that the child develops a secure attachment. In addition, “principal attachment figures can function more supportively when they themselves receive the support of others.”Bretherton, I. (1985). Attachment theory: retrospect and prospect. Growing points of attachment theory and research. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 50(1-2, Serial No. 209), 26. In general, the family is the most stable of all social relationships. For children, the family not only provides the primary attachment figure, but also a consistent (for better or worse) depiction of how relationships should develop. When children have grown up, they will utilize the relationship constructs which their family has demonstrated over the years. ReferencesSources * Fraley RC, Spieker SJ.

The episode was written by Tim Minear and directed by Howard Deutch. In this episode, Fiona (Jessica Lange) looks to form an alliance with Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett) while Cordelia (Sarah Paulson)'s attacker is revealed. Angela Bassett, Gabourey Sidibe, and Patti LuPone guest star as Marie Laveau, Queenie, and Joan Ramsey, respectively. This episode is rated TV-MA (LSV). Plot=1991 A young boy is taught to hunt by his father in the Chattahoochee National Forest. With rifle in hand, Hank waits for his father to flush out their prey. Hank aims his rifle as a scared woman arrives in front of him. He hesitates shooting her and she flings a fireball toward him. His father pushes him out of the way, causing the man's arm to get scorched, and shoots the witch in the head. Hank apologizes, and his father tells him to show no mercy and to \\"never forget what they are\\". 2013 Fiona carries Delphine's head in a box into Cornrow City and asks Marie about an alliance. When Marie shows no concern about the witch hunters, Fiona suggests they will eradicate the voodoo tribe after the witches are dead. Marie says she'll worry about that when the time comes and orders Queenie, who now works in the beauty parlor, to burn Delphine's head. In the Academy's kitchen, Myrtle watches as Cordelia drops some eggs in an attempt to make breakfast. She asks Cordelia if she believes Myrtle blinded her. Myrtle recounts the day when young Cordelia first arrived at the Academy when Cordelia asked if Myrtle was now her mother. Cordelia knows Myrtle did not harm her. Hank arrives at Delphi Trust in Atlanta, Georgia. With his father and David, he discusses the orders given to him to act as an information gatherer, not as a witch hunter. Hank is frustrated with his role and claims a successful hunt on his own. His father calls Hank sloppy, explaining how that \\"success\\" actually required his father to \\"clean up\\" the murder of Kaylee. Hank is shocked to learn that Delphi was behind the attack on Cordelia. His father reminds Hank that one day Cordelia will have to be \\"put down.\\" At the Academy, Myrtle prepares for a meeting with the Council of Witchcraft. Quentin and Cecily express regret over the \\"misunderstanding\\" that led to Myrtle's death, but marvel at her healed scars and ask about Misty's mud. Myrtle corrects them, saying Misty is an extraordinary witch, who had also been killed by those around her. Cecily raises her glass to toast Myrtle and becomes paralyzed, as does Quentin. Myrtle tells her guests that she gave them melon balls laced with monkshood, which made them into \\"human statues\\", revealing that she didn't invite them to chastise them, but to help out the Coven. She subsequently uses the melon baller to scoop out Cecily's left eye, then Quentin's right eye. Later, Cordelia wakes in her bed with her vision restored – now using Quentin and Cecily's eyes. Later, Cordelia realizes that she has lost the power of Second Sight. Zoe and Madison arrive at the hospital to find Nan sitting outside Luke's room. His mother, Joan, will not let her in to see him. The three enter and Joan chastises them. Nan tells her that Luke says to calm down. She also mentions \\"Just a Closer Walk with Thee\\" that Joan used to sing to him when he broke his arm as an 8-year-old. At first, Joan dismisses the clairvoyance but soon sings the song at Luke's bedside while holding both his and Nan's hand. Hank eats takeout food in his home. Wounds appear on his body and he convulses in odd angles on the floor. Marie has begun a voodoo doll ritual on him. A man kicks in his door and tells him he is feeling the wrath of broken promises. Hank's cell phone rings and the man answers it, holding it to Hank's ear. Marie tells him the witches die that night or the next needle will put a hole in his heart. Later, Hank arrives to see Cordelia has regained her sight and begs her forgiveness. She tells him that she has spoke to her lawyer and is filing for divorce and that his belongings are in an Academy closet. In Luke's hospital room, Nan tells Joan that Luke says that God is judging his mother for killing his father. Joan maintains that the man died from anaphylaxis, but we see in flashback that Joan caused the anaphylaxis herself, putting bees into her husband's car and locking him in it. Luke continues to speak through Nan, revealing the knowledge that his father was leaving Joan for his lover Mrs. Marteaux, a woman from Joan's book club, an affair that predicated the murder. Joan accuses Nan of being deceitful and treacherous, forcing the young witch to leave. Fiona gets a dog in order to give the Coven more protection and discovers Kyle in Zoe's bedroom. Fiona tells Kyle to leave and calls for the dog, but in a sideways allusion to Of Mice and Men, as she leaves the room, she hears Kyle clumsily snap the dog's neck. As Zoe, Nan, and Madison return to the Academy, they find Kyle and Fiona playing gin rummy, with Kyle winning. The girls discover Fiona has \\"spruced up\\" Kyle, not simply to have a better card partner, but also to provide the Coven with a \\"guard dog\\" that will attack on command. After failing to make Delphine understand her black heritage, Queenie plays videos of civil rights era news footage, accompanied by spirituals. LaLaurie appears to be affected by the music and is driven to tears by the images of civil rights abuse. Downstairs, Queenie takes her place at the salon's front desk, as Hank enters, armed with multiple high-powered guns. He storms in and begins shooting the voodoo tribe. He finds Marie as she attempts to teleport, but he manages to shoot her in the arm. Just as Hank is about to kill Marie, a wounded Queenie finds a handgun and shoots herself in the mouth, killing Hank and leaving her in an unknown state. Hank's father is shown weeping over the images of his dead son. At the hospital, Luke wakes and accuses his mother of his father's murder. She tells him to go back to sleep, then smothers him with a pillow to keep the authorities from learning her dark secret. Meanwhile, Marie arrives at the Academy with her arm bandaged. She enters the Academy, and a knowing Fiona closes the door behind her. Reception Rotten Tomatoes reports a 77% approval rating, based on 13 reviews.

It can cause a variety of health problems, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, breathing problems, sleeping problems, and joint problems later in life.Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2012, April 27). Basics about childhood obesity. Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/basics.html. Children who are obese are at a greater risk for social and psychological problems as well, such as peer victimization, increased levels of aggression, and low self- esteem. Many environmental and social factors have been shown to correlate with childhood obesity, and researchers are attempting to use this knowledge to help prevent and treat the condition. When implemented early, certain forms of behavioral and psychological treatment can help children regain and/or maintain a healthy weight.  Environmental factors = Television and advertisements  Childhood obesity has increased drastically in the US in the past 60 years, and studies show that in that time, there has been an increase in the amount of time spent watching television. In the 1950s two percent of households owned television sets, and 40 years later, 98% of households owned at least 1 television set. Current data reveals that, between the ages of 2 and 17 years, on average children spend more than 3 years of their lives watching television. Unhealthy food advertisements correlate with childhood obesity rates. This supports the theory that watching too much television is “one of the most easily modifiable causes of obesity among children.” Consequentially, there has been an increase in children and adolescents’ exposure to food advertisements. The majority of advertisements targeted at children promote food with minimal nutritional value, such as candy (32% of all children's ads), cereal (31%), and fast-food restaurants (9%). In 1997 US food manufacturers spent $7 billion on product advertising. Money spent on fast-food restaurant advertising made up about 28 percent of advertising, up from only five percent in 1980. In one of the first studies on television's role in childhood obesity, William Dietz and Steven found evidence that each additional hour of television per day increased the prevalence of obesity by two percent. They also specified the ways in which television viewing may affect weight in children and adolescents: severe decreases in physical activity and an increase in the desire for and consumption of unhealthy foods. These findings have been mirrored in more recent studies as well: middle-school children who watched more television tended to drink more soft drinks; this may be due to heavy exposure to food advertising. There are also studies that focus specifically on how advertisements are able to influence very young children and their eating habits. Even brief exposure to televised food commercials can influence preschool children's food preferences; young children may not be able to distinguish advertisements from their regular programming, and they may not understand that advertisements are meant to persuade while shows are meant to entertain. Using children's favorite characters and presenting products alongside concepts like fun, happiness, and well-being leads children to associate happiness with these foods without understanding the effects of eating only candy for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. While there are many studies that seek to prove that television plays a large role in causing childhood obesity, no concrete evidence can be found to support this claim. There is a correlational relationship between the two but no one can prove a causal relationship. There are numerous factors that contribute to a child's weight and eating habits; while media can have a significant impact on children and their food choices, their parents and friends may play an even more important role in determining childhood obesity.  Social factors = External motivation  Children who are externally motivated to eat are at a higher risk for obesity. In one study, two groups of children were told to focus on different prompts to eat: either external cues, such as the amount of food on their plate, or internal cues like hunger and satiety. The children who relied on internal cues were more likely to eat when they were hungry and stop when they were full. In contrast, the children who responded to external cues were more likely to ignore or overlook internal cues that indicated that they were full. Children who grow accustomed to relying on external hunger cues and thus eating more than their bodies need because are more likely to gain excess weight.  Maternal employment  There is an association between the amount of time a mother works and her child's body mass index (BMI). There is evidence that nonstandard maternal work schedules, meaning those that fall at least partially outside the “traditional” range of 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on Monday through Friday, are correlated with higher child BMIs.  Maternal depression  Maternal depressive symptoms may be related to children's nutrition and physical activity, which in turn help determine weight status. Mothers with such symptoms are more likely to put their infants to bed with a bottle and less likely to have rules about what their children eat. They are also less likely to eat dinner with their children, and the children usually watch more TV per day than children with non-depressed mothers. All of these behaviors have been correlated with higher child BMI. However, identifying maternal depression early can reduce the effects on children's eating habits and weight.  Family stress  Psychological stress in a family may contribute to childhood obesity. Sources of such stress include serious life events, parenting stress, lack of social support, and parental worries (e.g., the possibility of the child falling ill, being harmed, being handicapped, not developing normally, being exposed to abuse, or not surviving). In one study, children whose families reported stress in at least two of these four domains had significantly higher rates of obesity.  Mental and emotional well-being  Obese children show more depressive symptoms, poorer self-esteem, and poorer body-esteem than their normal-weight peers; however, among obese children, increased BMI does not correlate to severity of mental health problems. Weight does not predict depression or depressive symptoms in adolescents; however depressed youths (particularly males) are at an increased risk for obesity. Obesity can cause psychosocial problems that can lead to depression. Obese children show domain-specific decreases in self-esteem, judging themselves to have lower athletic competence and worse physical appearance; this decreased confidence discourages participation in sports, thus exacerbating both obesity and social problems. However, obese children do not vary significantly in ratings of scholastic competence, and objective measures show no effect on academic performance (controlling for other factors). Mental health among obese children reflects differences in cultural pressure: European-Americans, Asian-Americans, females, and adolescents are most likely to be emotionally affected by obesity. European-American and Asian-American culture emphasize thinness as a desirable quality more than do African-American or Hispanic communities, and in general boys and younger children are under less pressure to be thin.  Peer relationships  A child's body esteem may be more predictive of mental health problems than a child's actual weight status; weight-focused bullying correlates to increased depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem, and poor body esteem even in normal-weight children. That said, obese children are more likely to be mistreated and teased by their peers and are thus more susceptible to mental health issues. Children are very impressionable. If they are surrounding themselves with peers who exercise daily and choose water over a sugary beverage are much more likely to want to do the same. On the other hand, if they are surrounded by an environment filled with bullying and shaming, their motivation to be healthy will deteriorate.  Victimization  Bullying is more common toward obese children regardless of gender. Children hold many stereotypes about obese people, including that they are lazy, selfish, and mean. Verbal bullying may lead obese children to internalize such stereotypes, and victimization of all types may elicit social withdrawal or retaliatory behaviors that confirm stereotypes. Bullying increases with age for girls, but decreases for boys. It also appears that obese African-American and Hispanic girls experience less bullying than European-Americans, which reflects the patterns of mental health as well as the differences in cultural attitudes about thinness. It appears that the cultural differences insulate these children from the stereotypes that lead to victimization.  Social isolation  Isolation and rejection can impact self-esteem directly and also stunt social development, thus contributing to social ineptitude that can affect future relationships. Obese children list fewer friends than normal-weight peers and they have fewer reciprocated friendships. There is also evidence that their friendships are weaker than those among normal-weight children. Time spent engaged with screen media positively correlates with depression, and physical activity correlates with number of friendships; this suggests that certain obesity-promoting behaviors interfere with peer interaction: sedentary activities remove obese children from their peer group and limit opportunities to grow social networks. Still, obese children typically have at least one reciprocated friendship. Friendship buffers against both loneliness and the effects of bullying: self-disclosure to a close friend may help the victim cope with his/her experiences without rumination or internalization of problems. This improves self-esteem of physical appearance and decreases depressive symptoms.  Aggression  Obese adolescents display more aggression than normal-weight peers, particularly in terms of physical and verbal bullying. Such behavior reinforces negative stereotypes of obese people and further damages peer relationships. One possible explanation for this aggression is that obese children's lack of social support and friendly interaction stunts social development. Alternatively, obese children may seek to dominate their peers since they feel that they cannot gain approval through positive interaction. It is also possible that there is a “hierarchy of aggression,” such that obese children are merely reciprocating negative behaviors directed at them.  Treatment and prevention  Given the detrimental effects and rising prevalence of childhood obesity, much research has been conducted on how to prevent and treat the condition. It appears that addressing the psychology of obesity and modifying the family environment are important factors in regaining and maintaining a healthy weight.  Psychological and behavioral methods  There is evidence that certain behavioral change techniques may help prevent or treat childhood obesity. A recent survey of the literature revealed six techniques that proved effective: providing information on behavior specific to the individual (e.g., “You should not eat so much sugar, like when you have candy after school.”), environmental restructuring, prompt practice, identification of a role model, stress management and emotional control training, and general communication skills training.16 While these techniques are useful, further research is needed to understand how they can best be incorporated into programs for at-risk or obese children. The survey also cites four management techniques that did not promote prevention or intervention: providing information on the consequences of behavior in general (e.g., “Eating too much sugar is bad for one’s health.”) did not promote effective intervention. In a similar vein, providing reward contingent on successful behavior and facilitating social comparison were not effective in preventing childhood obesity. Many interventions center around promoting exercise and physical activity. Research has found that while interventions that utilize supervised exercise reduce BMI most effectively, interventions with a component promoting physical activity were more likely to generate lasting change in physical activity regardless of whether or not there was a supervised exercise component.  Parental and environmental influences  Further studies have demonstrated immense influence of the home environment as a result of parental (often maternal) education and guidance, with less success in school settings. A recently published study found that “parental policies supporting child physical activity are warranted,” and that “aspects of a child’s home environment can promote physical activity and dietary intake” in a variety of ways.Fisher, J. O., Birch, L. L., Zhang, J., Grusak, M. A., & Hughes, S. O. (2013). The Effect of the Home Environment on Physical Activity and Dietary Intake in Preschool Children. International Journal of Obesity 37 (11), 954-60. Active parental promotion of physical activity and an environment conducive to frequent, safe physical activity increase a preschool child's physical activity and improve dietary intake; such early changes even make the child more likely to display these healthy behaviors at age ten. Policies directed at parental behavior and the home environment are critical in order to prevent and treat obesity. However, different socioeconomic groups and mothers with different levels of education experience different rates of success in? prevention and reduction in obesity, warranting further assessment of different strategies’ effectiveness for different groups.  Self regulation  Research also emphasizes the importance of self-regulation skills in toddlers (and the promotion of self-regulation skills at all ages); the researchers concluded, “Self regulation skills in toddlers were associated with body mass index development and pediatric obesity eight years later. Early self regulation difficulties also contributed to body image and eating concerns that typically accompanied overweight children.” Similarly, the study found that toddlers’ inability to delay gratification and regulate their emotions was predictive of later overweight status, and that difficulties in these areas at age 4 correlated to being overweight at age 11. Research suggests that early and continuous intervention in the behavioral patterns of children makes a large impact.

Since then, 100 iguanas have been set free in the Pook's Hill Reserve. Facilities The area now known as Pook's Hill was purchased in 1991 by Ray and Vicki Snaddon, who built Pook's Hill Lodge. Snaddon named it after the popular children's book “Puck of Pook's Hill”, authored by Rudyard Kipling. ‘Pook’ in the Mayan language means “hill”. The lodge has ten white- plastered cabanas with thatched roofs which are decorated with Mayan weavings. The facility's library provides information on the area's bird life.

It is currently the oldest known Panthera species. The first fossils were excavated in 2010 in the Zanda Basin located in the Ngari Prefecture on the Tibetan Plateau.  Characteristics  Currently, only a fossil of a Panthera blytheae cranium has been found. However, current evidence shows that the species has a number of features common in other Panthera species, including a \\"frontoparietal suture located at the postorbital constriction\\", and an \\"absence of an anterior bulge overhanging the infraorbital canal\\". Its size is thought to be on par with that of the clouded leopard. It is about 10% smaller than the snow leopard. However, this is purely based on the relative sizes of the cranium, so this may be slightly inaccurate.  Relation to other Panthera species  The closest extant relative of Panthera blytheae is the snow leopard. The evidence for this is that it is more similar in cranial structure to the snow leopard than to other pantherines, as well as two species having similar ranges spanning the Tibetan Plateau. Based on the age of the fossil, P. blytheae is believed to have been very similar in diet to the snow leopard, as many species that constitute a large part of the snow leopard's diet existed before the extinction of P. blytheae. P. blytheae is not believed to be as closely related to the other extant species of the genus Panthera, and is therefore not believed to be the common ancestor of all pantherines. This implies that the divergence of Panthera from the rest of Felidae was much earlier, with current estimates being approximately 16.4 million years ago. Analysis of the location of P. blytheae in relation to other Panthera species indicates that Panthera arose in Central/Northern Asia or the Holarctic region of Asia, with other pantherines migrating to Europe, Africa and the Americas.

History The institution was established as a Poor Law Industrial School for Orphaned Children in 1862. The school moved to an adjacent site in 1903, and its original building was then used as a workhouse under the Board of Guardians for accommodating mentally ill, mentally defective and chronic aged and infirm patients. In 1930 control of the institution passed to the Public Assistance Committee of Cardiff City Council. From the establishment of the National Health Service in 1948 it was designated a Mental Deficiency Institution and Mental Hospital and administered by the Whitchurch and Ely Hospital Management Committee. The hospital was the subject of an inquiry set up by Brian Abel-Smith into abuse of patients in 1969 after allegations about pilfering and ill-treatment were published in the News of the World on 20 August 1967. This was the second of many Official Inquiry Reports into National Health Service Mental Hospitals. The report, written by Geoffrey Howe is still referred to within the NHS as containing important lessons. It went beyond the events at Ely itself, to look at the whole system and the way in which people with \\"mental handicap\\" – as it was known at the time – were treated within the NHS. Studies of such enquiries find a similar pattern of events and responses to them. Typically the institutions are isolated and inward looking. Staff are afraid to complain about poor practices and if they do complain they are often not believed. The patients involved are generally people who are not easily able to complain. The reports rarely give voice to the patients. The Ely Hospital report is regarded as significant in the development of services for these patients. It led to the 1971 white paper Better Services for the Mentally Handicapped and the first inspections of such services. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s the hospital went into a period of decline and it finally closed in 1996.

The following projects have been implemented and are developing in the Republic of Tatarstan under the leadership of Roman Shaykhutdinov. In providing e-services and interagency electronic interaction: The number of services converted into electronic form grows by the year in Tatarstan. It went up from 86 in 2012 to 246 in 2017. The number of e-service delivery episodes went up from 7.000.000 in 2012 to over 100.000.000 in 2017. Nowadays, over 80% of Tatarstan residents have access to services in electronic form thereby saving more than 380.000 hours through electronic appointments and 38.000 hours through filing applications online. In 2017, the Republic of Tatarstan won first place in the prestigious international contest of the UN International Telecommunication Union by presenting a project on delivery of state and municipal services in electronic form to the jury. Starting from 2012, Tatarstan has had a regional system of interdepartmental electronic interaction which has successfully operated in which all the bodies of state power and local government share the required information more than 1 million times per quarter. In 2012, a system called People's Control (Narodny kontrol) for considering acute issues was deployed and has functioned successfully so far. Ever since the system has operated, it has positively reviewed over 135.000 notices filed by citizens. Ever since the Public Inspector (Narodny Inspektor) system was launched in 2014, over 124.000 messages have been reviewed regarding violations of traffic rules. In geoinformatics and space technologies: In 2013, Tatarstan was the first in Russia to pass the state acceptance tests of the Single-Number 112-call Interagency System. The system operates by combining the efforts of medical, fire, police and rescue teams in emergency situations. In the same year, the Regional Navigation and Information System of the Republic of Tatarstan was created. Over 11.000 vehicles are now connected to this system. In 2014, the System-112 was integrated with the federal state system of emergency response in case of accidents ERA-GLONASS. In case of traffic accidents, data from vehicles equipped with ERA-GLONASS sensors is automatically transmitted to the System-112 deployed in the Republic of Tatarstan. In 2017, the system was equipped with an automatic system locating a person calling the 112 number. This greatly helps locating a victim outside a populated place, and allows rescuers to come to his aid in less time. In E-health: Starting from 2013, the Unified State Information System “Electronic Healthcare of the Republic of Tatarstan” has successfully operated. Within the system, every clinic in the Republic of Tatarstan had an electronic queue management terminal installed (a total of 325 terminals). One can also arrange a visit to a doctor through the Portal of Public and Municipal Services of the Republic of Tatarstan and through infomats “Electronic Tatarstan” and the mobile application “RT Services”. Within 2017, more than 14 million visits to doctors have been registered in electronic form. More than 500 large medical institution are connected to the Internet by fiber-optic communication lines and ADSL. It is planned to connect 214 institutions more in 2018. Together with the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan, the \\"Central Archive of Medical Images\\" module has been improved as of today. The archive stores more than 2 million digital researches. In 2017, a project engaged in giving out sick- lists in electronic form was launched in Tatarstan. In 2018, the project was put into commercial operation in all the medical institutions of the Republic. In E-education and culture: The “E-education” system in the Republic of Tatarstan currently has more than one million users registered in it. The most popular services of the system are the Electronic Class-Book that all teachers in Tatarstan now use in their work, the Electronic School Diary that is viewed by parents and pupils for their marks over 100.000 thousand times per day, and the “School Card” needed to enter the school and to pay for meals in the school canteen. Moreover, teachers can be evaluated, have their skills improved and participate in professional competitions via this system. In informatization of culture, efforts have been made to unify all public libraries within the Single Information Space GIS “National Electronic Library of the Republic of Tatarstan”; a single library card has been introduced which allows people to get services in any public library in the Republic of Tatarstan. Today, over 300.000 readers have registered in the system with more than 770 library records contained in the Central Electronic Catalogue of Tatarstans’ libraries. Museums work to create a Single Catalogue of Museum Exhibits in the Republic of Tatarstan which will serve to arrange virtual exhibitions. A ticket system has been put in place in 10 theatres and 5 museums which allows selling tickets in electronic form, including via the Portal of State and Municiphal Services of the Republic of Tatarstan. In communications and television: For three years, Tatarstan has been the leader in terms of the number of fixed access high-speed internet’s subscribers in the Volga Federal district amounting to more than one million users in the Republic of Tatarstan. The penetration rate of broadband Internet access in the Republic of Tatarstan has reached 76%. In 2017, a Federal project aimed at eliminating the digital inequality in the Russian regions was completed in Tatarstan. Residents of 676 settlements (with a population of 250 to 500 people) – that is about 250.000 people - can now use the broadband Internet access services via Wi-Fi. In addition, more than 11.000 households are connected to broadband Internet access via fiber-optic communication lines laid in 222 settlements. There are 6.500.000 mobile subscribers in Tatarstan. More than 14.000 base stations are operated in the Republic, providing 3G and 4G coverage. In 2017, the regional infrastructure company Interregional Infrastructure Group, LLC was founded in order to ensure a quality radio coverage of cellular communication in bottleneck areas with low cost effectiveness for the mobile network operators. In 2018, a pilot area of the fifth generation 5G network was launched in the city of high technologies Innopolis. In Tatarstan, 56% of households have cable TV, 26% of them have satellite TV and 13% of families are connected to IP TV. Taking into account the development of modern technologies, the over-the-air broadcasting network is also making progress. It was in Kazan that over-the-air DVB T2-standard digital broadcasting was launched for the first time in Russia on March 1, 2012, and on June 25, 2013, Kazan went on to become the first city in the Russian Federation to launch the second multiplex. Today, the Republic is working to equip multi-apartment buildings with networks of communal over-the- air television network allowing to receive TV channels in digital format free of charge. In Tatarstan, the work on transferring overhead communication lines underground is in progress. The work is aimed at improving the reliability of communication, ensuring the physical integrity of wires, protecting information, improving the outer look of streets and, as a result, improving the quality of life of residents in the Republic of Tatarstan. More than 2.000 km of overhead lines have been dismantled as of now; the remaining 1.600 km are to be laid under the ground within the next five years. 9 cities with a population of more than 50.000 people are involved in this project, to name: Kazan, Naberezhnye Chelny, Nizhnekamsk, Zelenodolsk, Bugulma, Almetyevsk, Yelabuga, Leninogorsk, Chistopol. In innovation development: The technopark in the field of high technologies \\"IT-Park\\" - located on two sites –Kazan and Naberezhnye Chelny, was among the best technoparks in the country according to the national rating of Russian technoparks in 2017. More than 200 (software) developments of IT Park residents are included in the Russian register of import substitution, which sums up to be 85% of all the solutions deriving from Tatarstan. The start-up ecosystem in IT has been expanding with more than 700 million rubles raised for start-ups of the Russian largest business incubator. A new city for IT-professionals called Innopolis has been built in the Verkhneuslonsky District of the Republic of Tatarstan. Now there are over 3.500 people in Innopolis on a daily basis. 150 companies have been registered there of which 75 are residents and partners of the SEZ Innopolis. All the basic infrastructure is present: 16 residential buildings, a kindergarten, a school, an IT-lyceum, medical and sports centers. A post office, banks, a supermarket, a beauty salon, a car wash, a cafe, a bar and other household organizations also operate in the city. Russia's first Innopolis University for the IT-industry has been established to specialize in education and in scientific research in the field of modern information technologies. Its main purpose is to train highly qualified IT-specialists as well as to develop and commercialize disruptive technologies to take the domestic IT-industry to a qualitatively new level. In training qualified human resources: In order to develop the IT industry, the industry-specific education has to evolve. Today, Tatarstan is implementing the IT cluster educational projects of the Republic in the field of secondary, additional, professional and higher education. The Inter-regional Center of Competence in the field of Information and Communication Technologies has been founded as part of the Kazan Technical School of Information Technologies and Communications under the authority of the Ministry of Informatization and Communication of the Republic of Tatarstan. There is a training site for the preparation of the WorldSkills national team in IT competencies, as well as a training center, which takes part in developing Federal State Educational Standards (FSES) for vocational secondary education. The Ministry of Informatization and Communication of the Republic of Tatarstan actively supports the professional excellence international movement WorldSkills which secures the team of the Republic of Tatarstan top places in IT competences in championships of both Russian and international level. In 2017, Innopolis hosted the first ever DigitalSkills IT championship-among young professionals under the age of 28 years. It was attended by 120 participants and 118 experts - employees of small, medium and large businesses in the field, students of secondary and higher education. Much work is under way in the Olympiad movement; the Ministry of Informatization and Communication is the direct organizer of the annual Russian Robot Olympiad.

The principal point of conflict was an issue of trade restrictions, but it unfolded against the background of the DR's attempt to return thousands of DR residents of Haitian descent to Haiti. More than 3,000 Haitians had been expelled from the DR in the first half of the year. On June 6, 2013, Haiti imposed a ban on the importation of chickens and eggs from the DR, citing indications that there was an outbreak of bird flu there. DR officials said other types of flu but not bird flu had been identified. On June 10, the Pan American Health Organization stated that no cases of bird flu had been found in the DR. On June 12, the President of the Dominican Republic, Danilo Medina, sent a committee led by the Secretary of Industry and Commerce, José Del Castillo Saviñón, to Port-au-Prince to resolve the dispute. A meeting between Haitian Foreign Minister and Dominican Foreign Minister Carlos Morales on June 17 produced no resolution. The DR ships 30 million eggs and 1.5 million chickens to Haiti monthly. By June 19, activity at the four border crossings between the two countries had come to a standstill. Medina announced that the DR would work to identify new markets and grow those already established in Puerto Rico and Venezuela. The head of the Dominican Association of Egg Producers said that thousands of poultry farm workers, who he identified as Haitians, would have to be fired. Casimir said Haiti wanted to find a way to reopen trade, while Medina said he could not wait and would have to take \\"drastic measures\\". Presidents Michel Martelly of Haiti and Medina of the DR discussed their differences on 30 June during a meeting of the Petrocaribe oil alliance nations in Nicaragua. Medina said that Martelly admitted there were no problems with the quality of eggs and chickens from the Dominican Republic and that the ban had been imposed as a matter of economic policy based on Haiti's difficulty in collecting tax revenues associated with the imports. The import ban remained in place. On July 19, the Haitian government prohibited the importation of plastics from the Dominican Republic, arguing that they were not of good quality and that Haiti needed to reduce pollution caused by plastic. On September 23, 2013, the Dominican Republic Constitutional Court ruled that children born to non-citizens in the Dominican Republic after 1929 are not and have never been citizens of the Dominican Republic. Since 2010 the DR constitution has denied citizenship to any non-citizen born \\"in transit\\", but the court extended that language to cover any undocumented person resident in the DR and their descendants. The ruling affects 458,233 Haitian workers living in the Dominican Republic and it can leave more than 200,000 people stateless. One analysis reported that the court decision created the fifth largest groups of stateless people in the world. A group of writers who protested the ruling compared its impact to apartheid and said it represented \\"the reinstating of the old racism that many have fought against\\". They described its impact: The government of the DR said the decision would allow for the proper documentation of non-citizens and allow the government to establish clearly their means of becoming legal residents of the DR. Advocates for the stateless criticized the DR's procedures as inadequate and ill-suited to an impoverished rural population that lacked the required birth registration records. On October 1, Haiti recalled its ambassador from the Dominican Republic. The Dominican government's acceptance of implementation of the court ruling was harshly criticized by NGO human rights offices, by 15 countries in the Caribbean Community (Caricom) and by the United Nations. Amnesty International said the DR had \\"effectively wiped four generations of Dominicans off the map\\".

They can also occur solitarily, without other people being present. People often imagine themselves in social situations when alone, resulting in solitary facial expressions. Toddlers and children in early childhood use social cues and contexts to discriminate and recognize facial expressions. They develop at this early stage facial expressions in order to provoke reactions from their caregivers and receive nurturance and support. Children reflect their peers' emotions in their own expressions for social interaction. Facial expression discrimination and expression develop at varying rates in children. During middle childhood and adolescence, the abilities to discriminate and produce facial expressions are still on their way toward achieving full potential. Considering that the ability to discriminate and produce facial expressions develop independently, there is a gap between a child's capacity to discriminate an emotion on another's face and their capacity to produce certain emotions, such as anger or fear. Fear and anger are more difficult expressions to produce than happiness, a possible explanation being that children are socialized not to produce these, considered socially undesirable. Further research is required to fully explore this idea.  Discrimination and expression  Facial expressions are produced to express a reaction to a situation or event or to evoke a response from another individual or individuals. They are signals of emotion and social intent. People make faces in response to \\"direct audience effects\\" when they are watching sports, discussing politics, eating or smelling, in pain, and see or hear something humorous. While one may have the same emotional reaction to a particular situation, he or she is more likely to express this emotion via a facial expression if they are in a social situation. Smiles, in particular, are \\"evolved signaling displays [that] are the result of selective pressures for conspicuous, stereotyped, and redundant communication\\". Smiling is a visual signal that requires eye contact from the recipient to the one smilingRussell, J. A., & Fernández-Dols, J. M. (1997). The Psychology of Facial Expression. (pp. 159-161). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. and is intended to communicate a feeling of happiness and joy. In an experiment by Alan Fridlund, smiling occurred least when one was watching a video alone, then more often when a person was alone watching the video but believed a friend was performing another task, even more often when that person believed a friend was simultaneously watching the video somewhere else, and most often when one was watching a movie with a friend physically present. This evidence shows that even if someone has the same internal reaction to a stimulus (like a movie), they are more likely to externalize these feelings when surrounded by peers or under the assumption that peers are engaged in the same activity. The production of facial expressions, however, is not solely limited to interpersonal situations. Since humans are largely social beings, they often imagine themselves in social situations even when they are alone. This phenomenon occurs in a variety of different contexts: treating oneself as a social interactant (talking to oneself), imagining others are present (either who are currently existent or have died), envisioning future social interactions, and personifying animals or inanimate objects (talking to pets). Solitary facial expressions are generated for an imagined other. According to role and impression- management theories, a perceived audience, whether real or imaginary, causes one to assume a role that is consistent with their audience. For example, a young girl may smile to herself in the mirror while imagining herself talking to a boy from class, but may grimace while imagining herself responding to her mother's scolding. Thus, \\"solitary faces occur for the same reasons as public ones, if only because when we are alone we create social interactions in our imaginations. They suggest the possibility that sociality may play a major role in the mediation of solitary faces\\". There are developmental differences in solitary facial expression, beginning with instinctive expressions in infancy and developing into more complex ones as a child's concept of sociality and emotion matures. Discrimination and production of facial expressions in infants A concept of sociality is acquired over time and through various social interactions. It has long been theorized that children expand the ability to regulate their facial expressions during the course of their development and that their expressions become \\"socialized\\" as they grow up. But how soon does socialization start and how big of a role does it play during infancy? Because infants cannot use words to tell us about their emotional states, their facial expressions are of particular importance. During infancy it is difficult to elicit discrete negative expressions like anger, distress and sadness, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the most common infant facial expression is the \\"cry-face\\". Cry-face is thought to integrate aspects of both anger and distress expressions and may indicate a shared basis in negative emotionality. Smiling, on the other hand, is easily recognized as an expression of happiness, but even here there is a distinction between cheek-raising or Duchenne smiles and non-emotional smiles, which are thought to be used mainly as social signals. Even in 10-month-old infants, Duchenne smiles have been found to occur most often in reaction to infants' mothers. According to Ekman and Friesen (1975),Ekman, P., & Friesen, W. V. Unmasking the face. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1975. there are \\"display rules\\", influenced by one's culture, gender and family background which govern the way we modulate our emotional expression. Studies investigating mother-infant interaction suggest that infants are exposed to these \\"display rules\\" first during face-to-face play with mom. In a study performed by Malatesta and Haviland (1982) researchers found evidence that changes in emotional expression during infancy are greatly influenced by this type of interaction and that there were differences among infants under 6 months of age based on both gender and family background. This suggests that during infancy these \\"display rules\\" are already taking effect. Facial expression development in toddlers through early childhood Following infancy, the discrimination and production of facial expressions improves as toddlers grow into early childhood. At young ages, children know what the most common facial expressions look like (expressions of happiness or sadness), what they mean, and what kinds of situations typically elicit them. Children develop these skills at very early stages in life and continue to improve facial recognition, discrimination, and imitation between the ages of 3 and 10. One study showed that toddler's spontaneous facial expressions reflect the emotions shown by other toddlers, this is called \\"decoding\\". This indicates that facial expressions are affected by the social environment, and are an important aspect in creating relationships with others in our social groups. In one study, researchers found that facial expressions of sadness may be more beneficial for toddlers than other expressions when eliciting support from the social environment. The ability to regulate expressions of sadness in order to provoke comforting behavior from caregivers can develop as young as the age of 24 months in toddlers. This suggests that there is more emphasis on the presence of others that elicit certain facial expressions in the stages of early childhood and toddlers. The \\"differential emotions theory suggests that different distress emotions have distinct adaptive social functions\\" or reactions from the social environment. For example, the distress call of anger from a toddler most likely will elicit a reaction of discipline from the caregiver, while an expression of fear would elicit the reaction of comfort from the caregiver. Social situations induce facial expressions in toddlers and children in early childhood, although there is not enough evidence to indicate that they understand these expressions as emotions. For example, a young child could express sadness when his or her mother is in the room in order to elicit a nurturing reaction from her. Though, at this stage (and adolescence), the child's discrimination of facial expressions develops at a different rate than the production of facial expressions. Therefore, young children are more readily able to discriminate expressions of sadness or anger, but the production of these negative expressions is much more difficult. Many of these studies show toddlers and children in early childhood showing facial expression in a social context, however there is not enough research on their solitary facial expressions. Development of solitary facial expressions in middle childhood through adolescence While there remains a general gap in the literature regarding the production of facial expressions and the processes which underlie this production at middle childhood and adolescence ages, research has been done to assess the overall production capabilities of children ranging in ages 5–13. Results generally indicate that the ability to produce facial emotion increases with age and is slightly correlated with the ability to discriminate the facial expressions of another. Odom and Lemond (1972) created a study to test the potential for \\"a developmental lag between the perception and production of facial expressions,\\" meaning they were looking to uncover a relationship between previously created schemas and mental representations of different expressions and the ability to transform these representations into facial expression. They operated using the logical assumption that coding perceptions of expressions comes before the discrimination of expressions which then precedes production. Upon assessing two differing age groups, one in kindergarten and the other in fifth grade, they discovered that there is a lag between perception and production of facial expressions, however this lag does not decrease with age. Production and discrimination do not develop at the same rate. Odom and Lemond (1972) have arrived at the far conclusion that production of facial expressions will never be at the same level of discrimination of facial expressions, which supports the findings of another study by Izard (1971)Izard, C.E. (1971). The face of emotion. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. who found that even adults have difficulty producing requested expressions. Despite this, the increased accurate productions of the older kids was found to be due to their discrimination abilities yet the older children still made many errors leading researchers to believe that full discrimination abilities are not at full potential at the middle childhood and adolescence stage of development. Children in Nepal playing happily. Further, Ekman, Roper and Hager (1980) researched the different means of producing facial expressions which could be influenced by age. They found studies completed by Charlesworth and Kreutzer (1973)Charlesworth, W.R., and Kreutzer, M.A. (1973). Facial expression of infants and children. In P. Ekman (Ed.), Darwin and facial expressions. New York: Academic Press. and Ekman and Oster (1979) who classified two methods of facial expression. They categorized deliberate action as an imitation of an observed expression or making a face which relates to a memory. Generating emotion is a more complex process with an individual focuses on an experience and attempts to relive that experience in order to create an emotional expression. They suggested age as an impact on the ability to utilize these processes considering the developmental requirements might not be met in order to use one or the other of the aforementioned skills. The study completed by Ekman, Roper and Hager (1980) consisted of three groups of children, the first group having a mean age of 5 years, the second 9 years and the third 13 years. Their results include a significantly larger increase in ability to produce facial movements between the ages of 5 and 9 rather than between the ages 9 and 13. Additionally, both Ekman, Roper and Hager (1980) and Odom and Lemond (1972) found the expressions for fear, sadness and anger to be the most difficult to produce. Odom and Lemond (1972) give a potential explanation for this using a suggestion made by Izard (1971) that \\"expression production may be inhibited by socialization training\\". The significance of this is that some expressions, such as anger or sadness, are socially undesirable. Therefore, socializing agents may discourage such expressions leading to a smaller chance that older children will produce such expressions spontaneously.

Later, she is in the care of some nuns at what appears to be a girls' school, where we find out her name is Valeria. She receives a medical examination, during which her vision blurs. She likes the young doctor, and they kiss. While they are kissing, the other schoolgirls burst into the room. They subdue the doctor, much to her amusement, and tear his clothes off. They do something apparently very painful to him using a pair of forceps. The same well-groomed, trenchcoated gentleman reappears. It may have all been a daydream. Later, the girls give a young nun a hard time by being unruly in the woods. The young nun chases Valeria, who takes pity on her when she collapses under a tree to catch her breath. They sit together and talk, but are reprimanded by an older nun, who seems to have rounded up the other girls. The young nun is dismissed and the older nun scolds the young woman, who proceeds to lean against a tree and daydream about a bishop and some nuns who tie her to a St. Andrew's cross and lash her with a whip. She is rescued by the young nun, who seizes the whip and chases away the others, and then she is joined by the schoolgirls, all wearing corsets. The daydream is apparently interrupted when the trenchcoated man inevitably reappears. After a graduation ceremony, she travels to the villa of her well-to-do father. Fitting back into family life, she meets a beachcomber artist, a pair of wacky priests, and a cast of other local characters, and is caught up in their various intrigues, many of which manage to result in various states of undress.

It offers three different degree programs: a three-year Bachelor's program, Applied Theatre Studies, and two two-year Master's programs, Applied Theatre Studies and Choreography and Performance (CuP). Each course places equal importance on academic and artistic practice. In seminars, reading courses and tutorials, students asked to engage with theoretical issues, while in performance projects, practical courses and workshops they experiment with different artistic approaches. Courses in the humanities and cultural studies offered by the university are also incorporated into each program. In choreography and performance, certain practical classes are organized in cooperation with the Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts (Hochschule für Musik und darstellende Kunst, Frankfurt am Main), where these classes will also be held.  History =The Formative Years Established in 1982, the Institute for Applied Theatre Studies became the first University program that integrated a study of artistic practice into the study of theatre. Under the leadership of Andrzej Wirth and his collaborator Hans-Thies Lehmann, the institute quickly developed into an alternative to those established theatre schools that understood theatre exclusively as acting based on dramas and prepared their students for a market dominated by the well-established municipal theatres. In addition, the institute stood in opposition to other academic departments for theatre studies, where there was little interest in practice. There, the discipline was understood primarily as theatre historiography. Wirth and a variety of guest professors including Heiner Müller, George Tabori, Emma Lewis Thomas and Robert Wilson sought out new forms of theatre, that challenged the orthodoxies of the German-speaking theatre scene in terms of its understanding of theatre. Influenced by Wirth and his choice of guest professors, some of the early works by students dealt with the tradition of Brecht's „Lehrstücken“ and minimalist tendencies springing from the fine arts. Simultaneously, Lehmann worked on the theory of these new approaches to theatre, that could not be conceived within the theory of performance and acting that was dominant at the time. Due to Lehmann's influential work, these forms of theatre are today known as postdramatic theatre. The 1990s and 2000s In the 1990s, the theatre studies scholar Helga Finter and the composer and director Heiner Goebbels took over the scientific and artistic leadership of the institute. Goebbels extended the scope of the artistic teachings to include more contemporary media-related forms of presentation and productions that would come to include music, sound and light. Further, with the completion of sound and video studios, a platform for independent work with these new media forms was established. Academically, Finter developed new areas of study by delving into the theatricality of the literary and theatrical experiments of the historical avant-garde, in particular those of Antonin Artaud. The works of Wilson and other contemporary directors and artists such as Klaus Michael Grüber were among Finter's objects of study, and led Finter to a theory of theatre that described it as a place of negotiation for subjectivity that contrasted a continuously solidifying society of spectacle. The tradition of guest professors continues to this day and continues to exert an important influence on the institute. Participating artists and scholars invited have included John Jesurun, Eugenio Barba, Herbert Blau, Richard Foreman, Marina Abramović, Richard Schechner, Patrice Pavis, Josette Feral, Samuel Weber, Georg Seeßlen, Mathilde Monnier, Jérôme Bel, Xavier Le Roy, Rabih Mroué, Tino Sehgal and Claudia Bosse. In 2008 the MA Choreography and Performance and a professorship for dance studies with a focal point on choreography and performance were established. Already in the 1990s, during Gabrielle Brandstetter’s stay at the institute, a strong focus on contemporary forms of dance had been instigated. Setting up this new MA program then represented a further opening of the institute towards contemporary dance and choreography. This program is organized in cooperation with the department for contemporary dance at the Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts. In the early years of the program, it was supervised by Gerald Siegmund. Similar to the already existing Bachelor and Master program Applied Theatre Studies, the MA Choreography and Performance offers both an academic and artistic approach, though with a particular focus on the body, its movement, its politics and economics. The Institute today Today there are four chairs at the Institute for Applied Theatre Studies, three of which are held permanently. Currently, Heiner Goebbels holds the chair in artistic practice, Gerald Siegmund holds the chair in theatre studies and has been managing director of the Institute since 2011. Bojana Kunst has held the chair in dance studies since 2012. The fourth chair is designed for the guest professorhips and is thus held by different artists over the course of a year. Whereas in the 1980s and 1990s, the conventional definitions and practices of theatre necessitated more innovative forms of teaching and understanding of theatre. Today the decline of the artistic importance of the municipal theatres and the enormous changes in the theatre landscape have brought other discussions to the fore: the ambivalences in the independent theatre scenes, its internationalisation and its working conditions due to the intensification of economic pressures produce new challenges and problems for the production but also for the aesthetics of contemporary theatre. The Institute for Applied Theatre Studies thrives on a proactive student body. For many years, students have independently organized a number of festivals: the Theatermaschine, a platform for the presentation of students‘ own works; the Diskurs festival, first founded in 1982, a noted international festival for the performing arts. For this festival, artists are invited with their works to participate in discourse and discussion; and finally the relatively young Instant-festival, which seeks to further the exchange with a program called The Scenic Arts at the University Hildesheim. This festival is hosted alternately in Gießen and Hildesheim. All festivals, but also the presentation of performance projects and practical courses, include critical discussions. These allow for an exchange between the students over their own practice and that characterizes the institute's culture of discussion. Alumni Alumni of the Institute for Applied Theatre Studies work in diverse fields of dance, theatre and performance, fine arts, media and academia. For more than 30 years, graduates continue to leave a lasting impression, both in the municipal theatre scene, the independent theatre scene and even in the academic world. Réne Pollesch, Gob Squad, She She Pop, Rimini Protokoll, Showcase Beat Le Mot, Otmar Wagner, Thomas Martius, Jürgen Fritz, Monster Truck, Auftrag : Lorey and many more have had a lasting impact on the theatre scene with their non-hierarchical and collective methods and unique aesthetics. Miriam Dreysse, Jens Roselt, Annemarie Matzke, André Eiermann and Jörn Etzold work in theatre departments across the German-speaking world, Frank Hentschker and Markus Wessendorf at American universities, all formulating new analytical approaches and theories of contemporary theatre.

Parameter value A bogey is a published value for a parameter of an electronic component, such as a vacuum tube, that is average or typical of devices that will be sold, and which the device's manufacturer is attempting to achieve. With manufacturing tolerances and variables in production, most devices produced do not exactly meet the bogey value for each parameter. Apart from a bogey device being a theoretical device that has the given characteristics, the term can refer to a specially- selected example of a device (e.g. from a production run where care is taken to ensure each characteristic has its nominal value); for example a bogey tube could be used to calibrate tube testers and be expected to give readings in the middle of the meter's \\"good\\" region. Hence a tube can be specified by its bogey values and suitable tolerances, and tests are based on the bogey values.
