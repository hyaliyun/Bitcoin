Scoggin implemented several programs throughout her career at the New York Public Library that placed intense importance on young adult readers, which ultimately inspired the ever-improving teen librarianship seen today. She said of young adults, ‚ÄúThey are a vital force which the library can both develop and use. They are the voters of tomorrow, the potential adult users and supporters of the public library, the emergent community to whom, theoretically, the public library belongs.‚ÄùScoggin, M. C. (1947). The Library as a Center for Young People in the Community. In A. B. Frances Henne, Ruth Ersted (Ed.), Youth, Communication and Libraries (pp. 151). Chicago: American Library Association. In 1999, American Libraries named her one of the \\"100 Most Important Leaders We Had in the 20th Century\\".Leonard Kniffel, Peggy Sullivan, Edith McCormick, \\"100 of the Most Important Leaders We Had in the 20th Century,\\" American Libraries 30, no. 11 (December 1999): 43. Education and early career Scoggin was born in Caruthersville, Missouri to Alfred Polk and Margaret Ellen Bright Scoggin. In 1926, Margaret Scoggin graduated from Radcliffe College and shortly after took a summer job at the New York Public Library.Lowry, B. (2003). Scoggin, Margaret Clara. In M. L. Miller (Ed.), Pioneers and leaders in library services to youth: a biographical dictionary (219). Westport, CT: Libraries Unlimited, Inc. Her hard work and growing devotion to librarianship, as well as her emergent friendship with superintendent of Work with Schools Mabel Williams, gave her the opportunity to quickly move up and garner more responsibility. By 1928, Scoggin was already presenting a paper at an American Library Association conference, and by 1929 had begun attending class at the School of Librarianship at the University of London. Upon graduation, she took a job as school and reference librarian at the George Bruce Branch of the New York Public Library and simultaneously taught at the Library's training school until it transferred to Columbia University in 1932. From 1938-1941, Scoggin began working toward her master's degree at Columbia University's School of Library Science, but never completed her final work for the degree. Instead, encouraged by mentor Mabel Williams, she became the director of the New York Public Library's Nathan Straus Branch for Children and Young People in 1940, and continued to work as superintendent of Work with Young People from 1952 until retirement. Nathan Straus Branch For Children and Young People Created in 1940 with the assistance of Nathan Straus, the New York Public Library, and, of course, Margaret Scoggin, the Nathan Straus Branch for Children and Young People was a colorful and welcoming building that encouraged young adults to feel comfortable at their library.Hannigan, J. A. (1996). A feminist analysis of the voices for advocacy in young adult services. Library Trends, 44(4), 24. Scoggin's 1941 article, ‚ÄúThe Library as a Center for Young People in the Community‚Äù reveals much about the philosophy that was the driving force behind the building's appearance and the branch's purpose. The article is rife with insistence that the teen-agers, whom Scoggin defines at people 13‚Äì21 years of age, should absolutely always have a say in how their library is run. She says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶let there be wide realization that the public library‚Äôs key to young people‚Äôs service, and therefore to reading guidance, is the opportunity to prove that books are fun, reading a pleasure, and that the places where books and people meet are centers of activity and sociability.‚ÄùScoggin, M. C. (1947). The Library as a Center for Young People in the Community. In A. B. Frances Henne, Ruth Ersted (Ed.), Youth, Communication and Libraries (154). Chicago: American Library Association. Sociability was a factor that Scoggin wrote about with fervor and acted upon throughout her entire career. Circulatin‚Äô the News was a bulletin of book reviews written by the Nathan Straus Reviewers, a group of teen-agers headed by Scoggin. She says of this program, ‚ÄúCirculatin the News has shown that young people under twenty-one have pertinent comments to make about books; often they are surprisingly shrewd in their detection of falsity and weakness. Such an outlet gives the young people an opportunity to express their opinions, under no compulsion, and starts them on the road to critical judgment.‚ÄùScoggin, M. C. (1947). The Library as a Center for Young People in the Community. In A. B. Frances Henne, Ruth Ersted (Ed.), Youth, Communication and Libraries (155). Chicago: American Library Association. The article is peppered with pleas such as this, to give young adults a voice in how their library is run, and to head up social groups so their voice can be heard. She hoped to use this information (the opinions of the teens themselves) to influence the kinds of books provided in the library and how they were organized within the building itself. Circulatin the News was such a success that it moved to radio format after Scoggin appeared on a New York City program entitled This is Our Town. The show, composed of book reviews by teen panelists, ran for 22 years until it changed its name to ‚ÄúTeen-Age Book Talk,‚Äù and eventually moved to television in 1960. Due to the successes of Scoggin's branch, it went on to become an example for teen libraries around the world. Her influence is evidenced in the teen sections of libraries today, with their colorful atmospheres and adherence to the tastes of young people. ALA and other publications Margaret Scoggin maintained a close relationship with the American Library Association (ALA) throughout her entire career. In 1942 she was named an ALA councilor, and in 1949 she was sent by ALA and the Rockefeller Foundation to assist in the International Youth Library in Munich. In 1957 she served as the first President for ALA's Young Adult Services Division, now known as the Young Adult Library Services Association. Her work there was lauded by the Children's Book Council, who eventually set up the Margaret Scoggin Memorial Collection which exists there today.Lowry, B. (2003). Scoggin, Margaret Clara. In M. L. Miller (Ed.), Pioneers and leaders in library services to youth: a biographical dictionary (pp. 219-220). Westport, CT: Libraries Unlimited, Inc Outside of her direct work with libraries, Scoggin was a prolific editor of young adult collections and writer of critical articles. In collections such as Chucklebait, one of her most famous works, she collects fun, humorous stories that reveal her attentiveness to the desires of young people.

He is one of only an estimated 30 people worldwide who are qualified to teach the traditional art of Tibetan sandpainting. He has written two books and helped to create the first Tibetan sand mandala ever shown publicly in the West in 1988. In 2002, he was made a National Heritage Fellow by the National Endowment of the Arts. In 2004, he was granted a Pew Fellowship in Folk and Traditional Arts. Early life Born into a Buddhist family in Chung Ribuce (√ú-Tsang, Tibet) in 1953, Samten spent two months crossing the Himalayas with his family to Nepal in 1959. After arriving in Dharamsala, India in 1964 or 1965, Samten entered Namgyal Monastery in Dharamsala, taking the vows of a novice monk there in 1967. He probably took full ordination at Namgyal in 1969. While enrolled at Namgyal, Samten also studied the arts of ritual dance and sand mandala construction at the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts. (Both institutions are closely associated with the 14th Dalai Lama.) In 1985 he earned a Master's Degree in Buddhist Philosophy, Sutra, and Tantra from Namgyal Monastery. Career After fleeing central Tibet as a child refugee in 1959, Samten studied, debated, and practiced for more than two decades in exile at Namgyal Monastery: since its establishment (in either 1564 or 1565) by the 3rd Dalai Lama, the personal monastery of all the Dalai Lamas. In 1975, Samten began the intensive three- year program which would ultimately enable him to construct traditional mandalas out of sand. He earned the formal title Geshe in 1985, having won a Master's Degree in Buddhist Philosophy, Sutra, and Tantra: roughly equivalent to a Western academic institution's Ph.D. Samten then served the 14th Dalai Lama as his personal attendant from 1985‚Äì1988, after which, he moved to the US. In 1988, Samten was charged by the 14th Dalai Lama to come to the United States to demonstrate the sand mandala art form; marking the first time that a Tibetan mandala was constructed in the West, at New York City's American Museum of Natural History. Moving to Philadelphia in 1989, he joined Kelsang Monlam (from Drepung Gomang Monastic College, d. 2012, age 87), and eventually became the spiritual director of the Tibetan Buddhist Center of Philadelphia. Samten left monastic life in 1995. He has established seven separate dharma centers in the U.S. and Canada, and currently resides in Philadelphia. In 1997, Samten worked on the Martin Scorsese film Kundun ‚Äì about the young 14th Dalai Lama ‚Äì as religious technical advisor, sand mandala supervisor, and actor. Samten has also written two books, including Ancient Teachings in Modern Times: Buddhism in the 21st Century. His history of Namgyal Monastery is written in Tibetan. Mandala art Since moving to the US in 1988, Samten has been commissioned to create works for numerous museums and institutions, including the Chicago Field Museum, Columbia University, Harvard University, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian Institution to name just a few. Samten has demonstrated the traditional practice of creating powdered mandalas at both the following museums: * the Albuquerque Museum of Art, * the American Museum of Natural History in New York City in 1988, * the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, * the Chicago Field Museum, * the Helena Art Museum in Helena, Montana, * the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, * the University of Pennsylvania's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, * the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico, * the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno, * the Philadelphia Museum of Art, * the Phillips Museum at Franklin, Pennsylvania, * the Santa Barbara Art Museum, and * the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. and the following Colleges, Universities, and institutions of higher learning: * Butte College at Chico, CA * California State University, Chico * Colby College, Waterville, Maine, in 2005, * Columbia University, * Georgetown University, * Harvard University, * Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2009, * New York University, * Rhode Island School of Design, * Smith College, Massachusetts, * State University of Louisiana at Shreveport, * Temple University, * Trinity College of Hartford, Connecticut, * University of California, Santa Barbara, * University of Columbus, Ohio, * University of Delaware, Pennsylvania, * University of Texas at El Paso in 1997 and 2012, * University of Nevada, Reno, * University of Pennsylvania, * University of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and * University of Arizona, Tucson.

This article refers to the terms ‚Äúresident‚Äù and ‚Äúpermanent resident‚Äù only in the scope of immigration purposes and describes the current situation based on the Immigration Act 2009. There are other definitions for residents in tax or electoral affairs. Similarities between a resident and a permanent resident visa The holder of any resident class visa is entitled: *to stay in New Zealand indefinitely *to work in New Zealand or in the exclusive economic zone of New Zealand *to study in New Zealand *to receive free or subsidised health care at publicly funded health services. *to free education at state-run primary and secondary schools, and subsidised fees for domestic students at private schools and tertiary institutions. *to enrol and vote in elections (after one year of residence). *to receive a social security benefit (after two years' residence for Jobseeker Support, Sole Parent Support and Supported Living Payment; after ten years' residence for New Zealand Superannuation; varies for other benefits). *to sponsor a partner, parents or dependent children during their visa application  Differences between a resident and a permanent resident visa  A permanent resident visa holder is entitled to be granted entry permission at the border at any time, while the resident visa holder is only entitled to apply for entry permission (whether before or after travelling to New Zealand). All other rights become only effective, if entry is granted to the resident visa holder. Generally, a resident visa is issued with travel conditions, which allow the holder to re- enter the country multiple times until these conditions expire. After that the holder may remain in the country legally but must not leave it or lose its resident status.  Requirements to obtain a permanent residence visa  An applicant for a permanent resident visa must *hold or have held a resident visa in the last three months ** *hold, or have held that resident visa for at least two years continuously *be of good character *have met any conditions that the resident visa was subject to Commitment to New Zealand can be met by spending enough time in the country, by becoming a tax resident, by owning a business, by investing in New Zealand or by establishing a base.

Its closure was announced in January 2012 and the school formally closed at the end of August 2014. History The Greenwich Blue Coat Girls' School in Greenwich was founded in 1700 by \\"several charitable ladies of this town\\".'An Account of Several Work-Houses for Employing and Maintaining the Poor. Pub 1725 & 1732' It is also mentioned by Dorothy George in her book about London life in the 18th Century.M. Dorothy George (1925) London Life in the Eighteenth Century One of these ladies was Mrs Margaret Flamsteed, wife of the first Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed, who was appointed by King Charles II in 1675. The school began with 30 poor girls who were taken in for four years to be trained in household matters as well as reading, writing and the church catechism. The girls were found positions in service in local houses.Blue Coat History:Greenwich Blue Coat School 1700 The school rented a building in London Street (later Greenwich High Road) and was closely associated with the Parish Church of St Alfege. It moved to Lime Kiln Lane (later South Street) in 1756 and then in 1825 to a site at the top of Royal Hill, later Point Hill, Greenwich. The school remained there until 1959. On the other side of Blackheath, the St John's Church of England National School was founded in 1854 as the first Church of England school in Blackheath for boys, girls and infants. The girls and infants were on a site in Russell Place (now Reynolds Place) and the boys in a local Mission Hall. In 1907 the London County Council withdrew its support from the Boys' School and an appeal was launched to build a new school. The result was the Blackheath and Kidbrooke National Church of England School, built on a site adjoining the old school in Old Dover Road. The school became a secondary mixed school. In 1945 the London County Council felt that the Greenwich Girls' Blue Coat School, which by then was a technical school providing tuition in housecraft, catering and needlework to 60 girls aged 14‚Äì16, was too small. In 1959 the school amalgamated with the Blackheath and Kidbrooke School to form the Blackheath & Bluecoat School. The old buildings in Point Hill were used as an annexe until 1963 when extensions were completed on the Old Dover Road site. In 1965 the school became known as Blackheath Bluecoat School. A scheme to expand the school came to fruition in 1972 when building began on land adjoining the school. The new school was fully comprehensive with a target role of 1050 pupils including Sixth Form. The school was awarded specialist status in September 2008 and specialised in the learning and teaching of mathematics and computing. Closure In 2009 the school became part of a federation with Saint Cecilia's Church of England School in south-west London. However, in September 2011, it was announced that London Borough of Greenwich was considering closing the school and a public consultation process began to decide the school's fate.The future of Blackheath Bluecoat Church of England School, letter to parents and carers, 13 September 2011, http://www.bbcs.greenwich.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/130911greenwich.pdf Closure was confirmed at a council meeting on 17 January 2012.Chandler, Mark (2012) Greenwich Council approves Blackheath Bluecoat school closure This is Local London, 17 January 2012Declining pupil numbers prompt decision to close Blackheath Bluecoat school - Greenwich Council press release, 18 January 2012Little, Mandy (2012) Final curtain for Blackheath Bluecoats?

Jessica FletcherSeth Hazlitt Dr. Seth Hazlitt was played by William Windom. He first appeared in the second series. He is Cabot Cove‚Äôs leading physician and Jessica Fletcher‚Äôs best friend. Under the crusty Maine exterior is a dedicated doctor with real compassion for his patients, a nurturing side that sometimes manifests itself in Seth‚Äôs protective tendencies toward Jessica. Seth is a widower, his wife Ruth having died before the series began. In the series four episode \\"Curse of the Daanau,\\" Seth receives an invitation from his estranged brother's wife. The two reconcile after 30 years only for the brother to be murdered shortly after. NOTE: He first appeared playing the role as one of the friends/ murder's in Funeral at Fifty Mile. 1985 Amos Tupper Amos Tupper is the original Sheriff of Cabot Cove and was played by Tom Bosley. Very little is known of Amos's career; he was the Sheriff for the first four seasons and was a deputy prior to that. All that is known about him before his career with the sheriff's department is that he was a bus driver one summer. He retired as Cabot Cove's sheriff in 1988, moved to Kentucky to live with his sister, and was replaced by Sheriff Mort Metzger. Charlie Garett Charles \\"Charlie\\" Garett is a P.I that Jessica encounters very often. He is portrayed by Wayne Rogers. Mort Metzger Mort Metzger was a former NYPD officer who replaced Amos Tupper as Cabot Cove's sheriff, in the mistaken anticipation of living in a more peaceful place with his wife Adele. The character was played by Ron Masak. Grady Fletcher Grady Ambrose Fletcher is the nephew of the show's lead character Jessica Fletcher and was played by Michael Horton. Specifically, Grady was the son of Frank Fletcher's late brother. Frank was the husband of Jessica. It was Grady who, after secretly reading Jessica's first novel The Corpse Danced at Midnight, had it published. Although Jessica seems to have a neverending collection of nieces and nephews, it is Grady that could be easily considered the closest thing she has to a son. In the series viewers learn that Grady was raised in part by Jessica and her husband Frank, after Grady's parents were killed in a car accident. Bumbling, but good-natured, Grady seemed to always be moving from accounting job to accounting job. When he did have a job, murder would quickly follow. Usually a too-trusting Grady was accused of the murder and needed his Aunt Jessica to find the real killer. His job troubles where about as bad as his difficulties with women. Grady, the shy innocent type, frequently had trouble finding a regular girl. He did eventually marry equally shy Donna Mayberry. His job troubles and women troubles converge when he finds out he worked for, and was fired by, Donna's father. Grady and Donna had a son in the series, whom they name Frank, after Grady's Uncle. Harry McGraw Harry McGraw is an old-school private investigator who becomes friends with Jessica. The character was portrayed by Jerry Orbach and was popular enough to garner his own, short-lived spinoff series in 1987, The Law & Harry McGraw. Michael Hagarty Michael Hagarty is a British MI6 agent of Irish origin, who would appear when Jessica least expected him to drag her into a dangerous case. He was played by Len Cariou. Dennis Stanton Dennis Stanton played by Keith Michell is a former jewel thief turned insurance claims investigator, who always solves his cases using unusual methods, and sends a copy of the story to his friend Jessica afterwards. Donna Mayberry Donna Mayberry Fletcher was played by Debbie Zipp. Donna married Grady Fletcher in an episode of the fifth season called \\"Something Borrowed, Someone Blue\\". Donna had appeared previously in two episodes, the first of which was \\"Just Another Fish Story\\", in which she was arrested for the murder that had occurred that episode, however it was considered to be self-defense, and married Grady only a year later. She is a very shy girl and was also an accountant like her father, although it was later discovered that she only pursued that career to make her father happy. She ended up giving up accounting after the first time we saw her to be a normal housewife, much to the horror of her father. Donna's father was Franklin Mayberry, a very successful and ruthless accountant, whom Grady had at one point worked for and was fired by, although by the time we meet Franklin it seems that he has already forgotten this, as Donna said he probably would have. Donna's mother was Maisie Mayberry, an extremely neurotic woman who spent most of the wedding worrying about one thing or another. Also at the wedding were Donna's paternal Uncle Ben, and her maternal Uncle Ziggy with his new wife Valerie. Debbie Zipp also appeared in season 3, episode 21, \\"The Days Dwindle Down\\" as character Terry. Gayle Yamada A Japanese American employee who is friends with Jessica Fletcher.

The observance consists of fasting and supplication, but is much less rigorous than that of Yom Kippur proper. Origin The custom is of comparatively recent origin and is not mentioned in the Shulchan Aruch. It appears to have been inaugurated in the sixteenth century at Safed by the kabbalist Moses Cordovero,Da Silva, \\"Peri ·∏§adash,\\" Rosh ·∏§odesh, ¬ß 417 who called the fast Yom Kippur Katan; and it was included by Isaac Luria in his Seder ha-Tefillah. R. Isaiah Horowitz refers to it by that name, and says it should be observed by fasting and repentance: \\"Following the custom of the very pious, one must repent of his ways and make restitutions both in money and in personal acts, in order that he may enter the new month as pure as a new-born infant\\".Shelah, ed. Amsterdam, 1698, pp. 120b, 140a, 179a When Rosh Chodesh occurs on Shabbat or Sunday, Yom Kippur Katan is observed on the preceding Thursday. The custom has roots in scripture () where a sin offering is sacrificed on Rosh Hodesh, indicating judgement and atonement is provided by God on that day. Therefore the idea of fasting would seem obvious. However, fasting is prohibited on Rosh Hodesh, so the fast is observed on the day prior to Rosh Hodesh. Practices Fasting is not obligatory, and is only performed by the very pious. The liturgy of the day, which consists of selichot, is recited at the Mincha prayer in the afternoon. Tallit and tefillin are adjusted, and if there are among the congregation ten persons who have fasted, they read the Torah reading Vayechal (, ) as on other fast days. The selichot are taken partly from the collection used on the general fast days and Yom Kippur, with the Viddui ha-Gadol (the great confession of sin by Rabbenu Nissim) and Ashamnu, and also a beautiful poem written for the occasion by Leon of Modena and beginning with Yom zeh. Some congregations add Avinu Malkenu. The fast ends with the Mincha prayer. For the text see Baer, Avodat Yisrael, pp. 317‚Äì319; Emden's Siddur Beit Ya'a·∏≥ov, ed. Warsaw, pp. 212a-216b. Yom Kippur Katan is not observed on the day before Rosh Hashanah. It is not observed prior to Rosh Chodesh Cheshvan, because Yom Kippur has just passed. It is not observed before Rosh Chodesh Tevet, because that day is Hanukkah. It is not observed prior to Rosh Chodesh Iyar, because one may not fast during Nisan. If the 29th of the month falls on a Friday or a Sabbath, Yom Kippur Katan is observed on the Thursday prior.

It covers from Kodaikanal to Munnar. The road was improved by the British in 1942 as an evacuation route in preparation for a possible Japanese invasion of South India. With a maximum elevation of just south of Vandaravu Peak, it was among the highest roads in India, south of the Himalayas, prior to its closure in 1990.Doddabetta, the highest mountain in the Nilgiri Hills, at , has road access to the summit. Kodaikanal - Munar road, 1981 before encroachment of plantation forest History Douglas Hamilton, 1870, age 52 Original milestone on wall beside road.

In 1900 the Kundale Road and Tramway between Munnar and Top Station was completed by the Kanan Devan Hills Produce Company. The road runs down the valley of the Kundale River. The road was built wide of which was metaled. The sharpest curve was and the steepest gradient was 1 in 30. There were 22 timber bridges between and span. By 1905 the timber bridges were being replaced by steel and concrete structures. In 1915, Law's Ghat road, opened Kodaikanal to cars, trucks, and buses coming from Batlagundu. In 1925, a second ghat road was started from Berijam Lake to Top Station, connecting with Munner, Kerala and eventually Cochin, a total distance of . This was an extraordinarily slow dirt road, taking about eleven hours to reach Cochin. The road was impassable during and after heavy rains. In 1942, during World War II, Madras City was bombed by the Japanese but the physical damage was negligible, though the public response was major and the city was evacuated because of fears of subsequent Japanese bombing and invasion. Many rich families from Madras moved permanently to the hill stations in fear, while poor people were evacuated to both nearby and far-flung villages that lay along the railways.Memories of Madras--the Summer of 1942 In 1942 in preparation for a possible Japanese invasion of India, the British began improvements to the road to facilitate its use as an evacuation route from Berijam Lake (Fort Hamilton) near Kodaikanal along the southern crest of the Palani Hills to Top Station. It was then called \\"The Escape Road\\". Existing roads then continued to Munnar and down to Cochin where ships would be available for evacuation out of India. G.Venkataraman,Radio Sai, Volume 4 - Issue 07, Kodai, Some History And Geography (July 2006) A far more probable reason for building this road was to secure the \\"top station\\" of a Munnar tea exporting rope-way (at Top Station, then in Madras Presidency) by providing a motorable route from Madras Presidency. The road was operative till 1990 but was ignored by both the Tamil Nadu Forest Department and the Kerala Highways Department in a dispute over its inter-state ownership. The old road is now in disrepair and overgrown with vegetation in some places. It is used as a logging trail and as a walking trail by local villagers and trekkers. Encounters with wild animals including bison, elephants, Leeches and leopards sometimes occur on the trail. Old route thumb900pxleftKodaikanal-Munnar road, 1959, (legend: green= forest, tan= grassland) Central location: (view coordinates in this article on Wikimapia / Satellite / Street for more details) The road begins as Club Road at elevation on the bund at Kodaikanal Lake, climbing west as Upper Shola road and forking left as Pillar Rocks road. It has very good dream Nelly the Green Valley View, (formerly called Suicide Point) at km 5.5, Kodaikanal Golf Club at km 6, Pillar Rocks Viewpoint at km 6.5 Pillar Rocks, Kodaikanal and Moir Point at km 9.3. At this point of elevation the road forks, with the left fork going towards Berijam, and Munnar. The right fork is the \\"Goschen Road\\" to the villages of Poombarai and Kukkal northwest of this place. Extensions to Mannavanur (junction), and Kavunji, together with a connecting road to Berijam Lake from near Kavunji, create a loop of about length, the \\"Forty Mile Round\\". In 1929, Sir Thomas Moir \\"turned the first sod\\", beginning construction of the \\"Goschen Road\\" which was completed in 1932. Berijam Lake Just past this junction is a Forest Department checkpost, which controls entry into the Allinagaram Reserve forest through which the road passes west to Berijam Lake and beyond. This area is part of the proposed Palani Hills Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park. Beyond km marker 13 on the Berijam road there is a firewatching tower from where one may have a fine view of the secluded Berijam Lake and the surrounding forest. At km 21 at elevation, Berijam has a Forest Department Camp including an Eco- Education Center for visitors. Nature areas to be visited here include: swamp ecosystem, fresh water ecosystem, nature trail, bridge, medicinal demonstration garden, museum, nature walk, grassland and shola. This camp also is the site of an old two-story brick building, partly damaged and blackened over the years, with a bright yellow painted name reading \\"Britisher's Transit Camp\\". This is one of several transit camps built during World War II for British soldiers to rest along the British \\"Escape Route\\" from Kodaikanal via Top Station and Munnar to Cochin. While most of the transit camps are now either dilapidated or demolished, the one at Berijam is still used as a Forest Rest house. At this point an old road, now just a trail, forks off to the north for down to Kavunji village at elevation. Tracks of logging trucks on Munnar Road near Palavachar Stream West of Berijam Lake, the road is closed for public vehicles and not maintained. Though the road is heavily damaged and overgrown till the Kerala border, it is well maintained within Kerala past Top Station. The road meanders southwest and passes south of Konalar Dam and reservoir at km 25. It then continues southwest and around the south side of a hill at km 31, then northwest around Ibex peak and through a shallow pass at km 34. 1.5 km over a hill past a rest house, it passes down across a bridge over Kathirikkai Odei (the Second Trout Stream). There is a path from there up along the stream to a waterfall on the stream. The road then proceeds northwest, bridges the Pulavachiar river at km 39, makes a loop north and then passes south along the east side of Vandaravu Peak. The road crosses its highest point of just south of Vandaravu Peak at km 50 where it crosses the Kerala state boundary and enters Pampadum Shola National Park. The road then proceeds sharply down to the southwest through 17 hairpin turns to Top Station (Again Tamil Nadu) at elevation at km 60. Here the road becomes Kerala SH-18 and is well maintained, passing by extensive tea plantations to Munnar. There is public bus service between kodaikanal to kilavarai, vattavada to munnar, the distance between kilavarai and vattavada is 17 km no bus service Access Unauthorized Trekking Prohibited Berijam is located at the end of Pillar Rocks Road (old SH-18), southwest of Kodaikanal Lake. There were two roads from Berijam, one to Munnar town, about west and another to Kavunji village, north. The old roads are now overgrown with vegetation and are used only as walking trails by local villagers and trekkers. Encounters with wild animals including bison, leopards, elephants, tigers sometimes occur on these trails. The Tamil Nadu Forest Department has restricted entry into the Berijam Lake area to between 9.30 a.m. and 3 p.m. for the general public. An entry permit (free) is required and can be obtained in person at the Forestry Department Office in Kodaikanal. Only ten permits are given each day, so early application the previous day is advised for timely access to the road west of Muir Point. :Tourists contact: (before 11:30 a.m.) Government of Tamil Nadu, Tourist Office, Annasalai, Kodaikanal 624 101, Tamil Nadu, India.

A pamphlet, \\"Sholas For Survival\\", available from the District Forest Office, Kodaikanal describes 17 local treks ranging from leisurely walks to challenging day-long treks. This booklet provides a trekking map of the Palani Hills and details the degree of difficulty for each trek.District Collectorate, Dindigul, National Informatics Centre, Description of Trekking Routes Rivers The Kodaikanal‚ÄìMunnar Road crosses several rivers between Berijam and Top Station. There are no river crossings between Moir point and Berijam. Rivers that are crossed, traveling east to west include: Waterfall on Kathirikkai Odei, 1981 Kathirikkai falls, 1981 #Berijam River is crossed at , immediately before Berijam Camp. #Konalur River is crossed at , just south of Konalur Reservoir. #Konalur River II (for lack of correct name) is crossed at , just west of Konalur River. # Road recrosses Pulakachar at , SW of 1st crossing. #Sebastian Odai is crossed at . This stream originates south, near Marian Shola Bungalow. #First Trout Stream (proper name =?) is crossed at , just before the Forest Department Hut and other Forest Department buildings. Pool above falls on Kathirikkai Odei #Kathirikkai Odei (the Second Trout Stream) is crossed at , after the Forest Dept Hut. It has small pool above a waterfall just south of the road crossing. This stream flows northeast where it is joined by the First Trout Stream, then north to join the Sebastian Odai which in joins the Poondi Stream. #Unnamed tributary is crossed at , just before Pulavachiar Forest Quarters. This stream originates SW, just above a waterfall, in the farthest SW corner of the Palani Hills. # Pulavachiar River crosses the road at , past the Pulavachiar Forest Quarters, near milestone: \\"Top Station 12\\". This is below the final climb up to Vunderavu hut. The river flows north, is joined by several tributaries, including the Poondi/Kavunji? stream and flows down the valley between Polur and Kilavarai. Just west of Kumbur, it becomes the major tributary of the Kumbur River which drops into Manjampatti Valley, passing Mungulpalum village and joining the Ten Ar river at Manjampatti Village. #The road crosses small unnamed tributaries 4 times, north of Pulavachiar crossing. #The road crosses only one small unnamed stream at , during its descent from Vandaravu to Top Station. Most of these stream crossings still have stone and/or concrete bridges. Shelters There are several structures on or near the road which may be available for overnight use by trekkers. Proceeding east to west, they are: *The Forest Dept. checkpost at near Muir Point after Km 9 is not for overnight use but may offer temporary daytime shelter during a rain shower. *Green Hut is an old Forest Dept. bungalow at near km 14, which has been used for overnight camping since at least 1943. It will be renovated soon. *The Fire lookout tower at just past km 13, before Berijam lake, has a roofed hexagon structure not meant for overnight use but can offer short term safety from Gaur and elephants. *There is a Forest Rest House at Berijam Lake, first developed as a British Transit Camp, at , at km 23, with limited accommodations, which serves as an overnight base camp for Forestry Department staff, researchers and trekkers. Trekkers must get advance permission to stay overnight there. Visitors must bring their own provisions, but cooking facilities are available. Munnar Road, showing Forest Dept.

Tamil Nadu Forest Dept. built the buildings to house Dept. staff who lived there while supervising wood cutting enterprises and road work crews. The laborers, mostly Sri Lankan Tamils, built temporary shacks of poles and matting. The shacks were abandoned when the cutters moved on to another area. The supervisors' \\"pucca\\" huts remain and now provide basic overnight shelter for trekkers. Limited overnight accommodations may be used with advance permission. *Pulavachiar Forest Quarters is an old British Transit Camp at , near mile stone: \\"Top Station 12\\". This camp shows below a red star on the Army map. There is overnight shelter here for trekkers. *Vandaravu camp is two structures at on the north slope of Vandaravu Peak, as shown on the 1959 Army Map. Current condition and suitability for shelter is unknown. *There is a small corrugated steel shelter on the lower square platform of the observation tower at Pampadum Shola National Park on the west slope of Vandaravu Peak at This is a poor alternative shelter to the nice Forest Quarters less than away. *There is a well maintained Kerala Forest quarters at near the Bandar Wireless Station on the south slope of Vandaravu Peak. *There are limited commercial cabins and hotels at Top Station and many commercial accommodations of all classes at Munnar.http://www.munnar.com. Intersections Map of intersecting roads and other trails There are several well established side roads and other intersecting minor trails which branch off from the Kodaikanal‚ÄìMunnar Road. Most of these show as \\"other trails\\" on the 1959 Army map. These intersections either go north to Upper Palani Hills villages or go south, dropping sharply down the south facing escarpment to hill villages en route and towns on the plains up to below. The Ciff Trail provides an alternate east-west route between Berijam Lake and the Kerala Forest Bungalow. There are over 40 recognized hiking routes from Kodaikanal using the Munnar road and these other trails. Excluding Kodaikanal Municipal roads, going from east to west, the intersections are: Vellagavi Village Pambar valley below Dolphins Nose Palani Hills from Bodinayakanur # Kodai-Vellagavi footpath begins at at Pambar bridge near head of the Pambar river. Pambar Falls are nearby. Path descends steeply to Dolphins Nose, a dramatic perch over the Pambar valley below. A bridle path leads through Cardamom plantations, sholas and meadows leading to Vellagavi, an isolated old village with paved streets and a Muruga Temple. Footpath proceeds down west side of Vellagaviar River valley. The path becomes a dirt road along the river Vannathi odai. Kumbakarai Falls are at the bottom. Trekking distance is . Trekking time is 5 hours. # Goschen Road forks north, at at Moir point at km 9.3, toward the villages of Poombarai and Kukkal to the northwest. Extensions to Mannavanur (junction), and Kavunji, together with a connecting road to Berijam Lake from near Kavunji, create a loop of about length, the \\"Forty Mile Round\\".

In 1900, 75% of the area of the Upper Palni Hills,was grassland. p.4 This shola/grasslands ecosystem was effective in conserving monsoon rainfall and letting it soak in to replenish the watertable for year- round release into the streams. From 1948 through the 1960s the Tamil Nadu Forest Department planted large areas of indigenous grasslands along the road with black wattle for producing tanning agents for use in the leather industry.Ref/Donnelly, p.10 blue gum (eucalyptus) and Mexican weeping pine were planted in order to provide a reliable alternative firewood supply to protect the native shola forests from cutting for firewood. The 1973 vegetation map shows these imported tree species already taking over the grasslands around the road. A detailed dynamic map of 2002 vegetation shows distribution of various plantation species that have replaced most of the grasslands and native evergreen forests. Another 2002 map of Palni Hills, showing distribution of wattle plantations, also shows wattle dominating the route of the Kodaikanal Munnar Road. Exotic forests now cover over 80% of the area which was previously covered by Grasslands.Donnelly, p.41 These non- native species now dominate thousands of acres once dominated by native grasses. These extensive wattle plantations are sometimes blamed as the major cause of reduced soil moisture and stream flows across upper Palni catchments, though it is likely that reduced rainfall during the Southwest monsoon period, combined with a pattern of heavy downpours and longer dry spells between rain events in the non-monsoon months is also responsible. Wattle plantations in the upper Palanis seem to help regrowth of indigenous shola species and associated wildlife, and also reduce cutting of shola forests by providing superior fuel wood. It is probable that these old, non-productive plantations, that are slow-growing or partially invaded with native woody species, are similar to native forest in terms of water use. New route Level crossing of unnamed river in flood near Kilavarai Though the old evacuation route is now impassable for vehicles, there remains a desire and need among farmers and tourists for a direct road link between Kodaikanal and Munnar. The Kadaveri‚Äì Kilvari road is a horse trail used by farmers of Kadavari to take their products to Kodaikanal, via Kilavarai. It is possible but not practical to pass here by off-road vehicle.

These communities of men and women have voluntarily removed themselves from the status quo in order to seek justice and mercy with the poorest of the world's poor. Goals The specific aim of each of these groups of people is to plant new communities in the desperate corners of the global fringe. They are artistic, international, ecumenical, contemplative people with a vision to see a flourishing of God's shalom. These outwardly oriented communities have been established in some of the highest poverty neighborhoods of the world, in places like Kolkata, India; Freetown, Sierra Leone; Caracas, Venezuela; and Los Angeles, California. Inspiration This emerging missional renewal movement has been inspired by the old orders. They exist on the outer edge of the mainstream church like the old orders, and they enjoy many of the disciplines and liturgies developed within the old orders. What's more, they have benefited from some of the organizational, entrepreneurial, and strategic thinking of modern, evangelical missions agencies. While these groups often parallel western communities who identify with the New Monasticism, the new monastic communities may be characterized by a centripetal force, renewing the church and the neighborhoods in which they exist by drawing people in, while the new friars by a centrifugal one, whose energy moves outward to the global margins, seeking to raise up and mobilize members to move into the cities of the majority world. Neomonastic communities in the west are like domestic cousins to the new friars, who inhabit the slums primarily in the developing world. Origins The publishing of The New Friars in 2006 became a catalyst for several groups to begin conversation around the term. Viv Grigg, who helped to found Servants to Asia's Urban Poor in the 1980s, was among the first to use the language of Catholic orders in describing this mission-driven revival of incarnational ministry among the poor. But Grigg warns people from too closely tying this renewal movement to the old orders. ‚ÄúGod is doing something new. Some of it may look very much like the old preaching orders of friars. But we must give God the freedom to do a new thing.‚Äù Others whose writings and work have influenced the movement include Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Michael Duncan, Athol Gill, and Ralph Winter. The use of ‚Äúfriar‚Äù language is not universally accepted within the movement and must be held loosely. The new friars have roots in five historic, radically missional movements dating from the 5th to the 17th century ‚Äì Celtic, Nestorian, Franciscan, Moravian, and Jesuit ‚Äì only one of which, the Franciscans, could technically be identified as an order of ‚Äúfriars.‚Äù The apostolic qualities which unify these divergent groups are more critical than the ‚Äúfriar‚Äù terminology. These include five distinctives. These groups were/are incarnational, devotional, communal, missional and marginal, the very qualities showing up in new missional communities. Distinction of New Friars #Incarnational: The new friars seek to be the gospel by becoming part of the communities of the dispossessed among whom they seek to serve, moving into their informal shantytowns and becoming, to a large degree, one of them.Bessenecker, Scott. \\"The New Friars\\". InterVarsity Press, 2006, p. 74-84 #Devotional: The new friars are organized around a set of spiritual commitments to govern their walk with Jesus, with one another, and with the communities of lost, poor, or broken souls into which they have moved.Bessenecker, Scott. \\"The New Friars\\". InterVarsity Press, 2006, p.85-105 #Communal: The new friars live together and hold in common many of those things that they held privately before joining the community.Bessenecker, Scott. \\"The New Friars\\". InterVarsity Press, 2006, p.106-118 #Missional: The new friars have something of the spirit of mission- driven monks and nuns in them, leaving their mother countries and moving to those parts of the world where little is known about Jesus.Bessenecker, Scott. \\"The New Friars\\". InterVarsity Press, 2006, p.119-134 #Marginal: The new friars are on the fringe of the mainstream church and they seek to plant themselves amount people who exist on the edge of society (sex workers, street kids, orphans and families who are simply trapped in poverty).Bessenecker, Scott. \\"The New Friars\\". InterVarsity Press, 2006, p.135-154 Differences from \\"Traditional\\" Christian Friars While these modern communities share much in common with the historic order of friars, there are a number of significant differences. # The modern movement is not predominantly a Catholic movement. It is, however, theologically broad enough for Catholics and Protestants to serve together. # The modern movement is not just for males. ‚ÄúFriar‚Äù is an exclusively male term, while the emerging movement is majority female and includes families. # The modern movement is vocationally diverse. The sort of transformation new friars seek in the world's poorest communities requires them to become, or at least to integrally enfold into their communities, organizational executives, business entrepreneurs, policy advocates, lawyers and any number of professional roles not afforded the strictly dedicated life of a clergyman. # The new friar communities have not taken vows of celibacy. An ecumenical community of families and singles serving among the poor will produce an entirely different environment than a community of gender exclusive individuals committed to living their entire lives in a state of celibacy.

Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC); also known as constitutional dynamic chemistry (CDC) is a method to the generation of new molecules formed by reversible reaction of simple building blocks under thermodynamic control.Schaufelberger, F.; Timmer, B. J. J.; Ramstr√∂m, O. Principles of Dynamic Covalent Chemistry. In Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: Principles, Reactions, and Applications; Zhang, W.; Jin, Y., Eds.; John Wiley & Sons: Chichester, 2018; Chapter 1, pp 1‚Äì30. The library of these reversibly interconverting building blocks is called a dynamic combinatorial library (DCL).Kom√°romy, D.; Nowak, P.; Otto, S. Dynamic Combinatorial Libraries. In Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: Principles, Reactions, and Applications; Zhang, W.; Jin, Y., Eds.; John Wiley & Sons: Chichester, 2018; Chapter 2, pp 31‚Äì119.Lehn, J.-M.; Ramstr√∂m, O. Generation and screening of a dynamic combinatorial library. PCT. Int. Appl. WO 20010164605, 2001. All constituents in a DCL are in equilibrium, and their distribution is determined by their thermodynamic stability within the DCL. The interconversion of these building blocks may involve covalent or non-covalent interactions. When a DCL is exposed to an external influence (such as proteins or nucleic acids), the equilibrium shifts and those components that interact with the external influence are stabilised and amplified, allowing more of the active compound to be formed.  History  left By modern definition, dynamic combinatorial chemistry is generally considered to be a method of facilitating the generation of new chemical species by the reversible linkage of simple building blocks, under thermodynamic control. This principle is known to select the most thermodynamically stable product from an equilibrating mixture of a number of components, a concept commonly utilised in synthetic chemistry to direct the control of reaction selectivity. Although this approach was arguably utilised in the work of Fischer and Werner as early as the 19th century, their respective studies of carbohydrate and coordination chemistry were restricted to rudimentary speculation, requiring the rationale of modern thermodynamics. It was not until supramolecular chemistry revealed early concepts of molecular recognition, complementarity and self-organisation that chemists could begin to employ strategies for the rational design and synthesis of macromolecular targets. The concept of template synthesis was further developed and rationalised through the pioneering work of Busch in the 1960s, which clearly defined the role of a metal ion template in stabilising the desired ‚Äòthermodynamic‚Äô product, allowing for its isolation from the complex equilibrating mixture. Although the work of Busch helped to establish the template method as a powerful synthetic route to stable macrocyclic structures, this approach remained exclusively within the domain of inorganic chemistry until the early 1990s, when Sanders et al. first proposed the concept of dynamic combinatorial chemistry. Their work combined thermodynamic templation in tandem with combinatorial chemistry, to generate an ensemble complex porphyrin and imine macrocycles using a modest selection of simple building blocks. Sanders then developed this early manifestation of dynamic combinatorial chemistry as a strategy for organic synthesis; the first example being the thermodynamically-controlled macrolactonisation of oligocholates to assemble cyclic steroid-derived macrocycles capable of interconversion via component exchange. Early work by Sanders et al. employed transesterification to generate dynamic combinatorial libraries. In retrospect, it was unfortunate that esters were selected for mediating component exchange, as transesterification processes are inherently slow and require vigorous anhydrous conditions. However, their subsequent investigations identified that both the disulfide and hydrazone covalent bonds exhibit effective component exchange processes and so present a reliable means of generating dynamic combinatorial libraries capable of thermodynamic templation. This chemistry now forms the basis of much research in the developing field of dynamic covalent chemistry, and has in recent years emerged as a powerful tool for the discovery of molecular receptors. Protein-directed One of the key developments within the field of DCC is the use of proteins (or other biological macromolecules, such as nucleic acids) to influence the evolution and generation of components within a DCL.Greaney, M. F.; Bhat, V. T. Protein- directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry. In Dynamic combinatorial chemistry: in drug discovery, bioinorganic chemistry, and materials sciences; Miller, B. L., Ed.; John Wiley & Sons: New Jersey, 2010; Chapter 2, pp 43‚Äì82. Protein- directed DCC provides a way to generate, identify and rank novel protein ligands, and therefore have huge potential in the areas of enzyme inhibition and drug discovery.Hochg√ºrtel, M.; Lehn, J.-M. Dynamic combinatorial diversity in drug discovery. In Fragment-based approaches in drug discovery; Jahnke, W., Erlanson, D. A., Ed.; Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, 2006; Chapter 16, pp 341‚Äì364. Scheme illustrating the theory of protein-directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC).  Reversible covalent reactions  Types of reversible covalent reactions that have been applied in protein-directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC). The development of protein-directed DCC has not been straightforward because the reversible reactions employed must occur in aqueous solution at biological pH and temperature, and the components of the DCL must be compatible with proteins. Several reversible reactions have been proposed and/or applied in protein-directed DCC. These included boronate ester formation, diselenides-disulfides exchange, disulphide formation, hemithiolacetal formation, hydrazone formation, imine formation and thiol- enone exchange.  Pre-equilibrated DCL  For reversible reactions that do not occur in aqueous buffers, the pre-equilibrated DCC approach can be used. The DCL was initially generated (or pre-equilibrated) in organic solvent, and then diluted into aqueous buffer containing the protein target for selection. Organic based reversible reactions, including Diels-Alder and alkene cross metathesis reactions, have been proposed or applied to protein-directed DCC using this method.  Reversible non-covalent reactions  Reversible non- covalent reactions, such as metal-ligand coordination, has also been applied in protein-directed DCC. This strategy is useful for the investigation of the optimal ligand stereochemistry to the binding site of the target protein.  Enzyme-catalysed reversible reactions  Enzyme-catalysed reversible reactions, such as protease-catalysed amide bond formation/hydrolysis reactions and the aldolase-catalysed aldol reactions, have also been applied to protein-directed DCC.  Analytical methods  Protein-directed DCC system must be amenable to efficient screening. Several analytical techniques have been applied to the analysis of protein-directed DCL. These include HPLC, mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography.  Multi- protein approach  Although most applications of protein-directed DCC to date involved the use of single protein in the DCL, it is possible to identify protein ligands by using multiple proteins simultaneously, as long as a suitable analytical technique is available to detect the protein species that interact with the DCL components. This approach may be used to identify specific inhibitors or broad-spectrum enzyme inhibitors.  Other applications  DCC is useful in identifying molecules with unusual binding properties, and provides synthetic routes to complex molecules that aren't easily accessible by other means. These include smart materials, foldamers, self-assembling molecules with interlocking architectures and new soft materials. The application of DCC to detect volatile bioactive compounds, i.e. the amplification and sensing of scent, was proposed in a concept paper. Recently, DCC was also used to study the abiotic origins of life.

In the 1920s, he was one of the foremost leaders of the Slovene and Croat minority in the Italian-administered Julian March. In the 1930s, he was one of the leaders of Slovene anti-Fascist √©migr√©s from the Slovenian Littoral, together with Josip Vilfan, Ivan Marija ƒåok and Lavo ƒåermelj. He is considered one of the best Slovene public speakers of the 20th century.  Biography = In Austria-Hungary  He was born to a Slovene-speaking lower-middle-class family in Gorizia, in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Italy). After finishing the German-language State Gymnasium in Gorizia, he enrolled at the University of Vienna, where he studied law, graduating in 1920. In the years before World War I, he joined the young generation of Christian Socialist activists around the Carniolan priest Janez Evangelist Krek, who challenged the conservative leadership of the Slovene People's Party. Together with the priest Virgil ≈†ƒçek, Besednjak became one of the leaders of the Slovene Christian Socialist youth in the Austrian Littoral. Between 1913 and 1914, he was the president of the Christian Social Association (Kr≈°ƒçansko-socialna zveza) in Gorizia and Gradisca, and between 1917 and 1919 he was a personal secretary of the chairman of the Slovene People's Party, Anton Koro≈°ec.  In the Kingdom of Italy  After World War One, he returned to Gorizia, and soon became one of the main figures of Slovene and Croat political Catholicism in the Julian March, an administrative region formed out of the former Austro-Hungarian Adriatic provinces annexed to Italy. In 1919, he became chief editor of the Slovene daily newspaper Edinost (Unity) of Trieste, and in 1921 he was elected to the Provincial Assembly of the Province of Gorizia. From 1922 to 1924, he was director of the newspaper Gori≈°ka stra≈æa (The Guard of Gorizia). In the mid-1920s, he was a member of the executive board of the League of the Slovene Agrarian Workers in Italy, and of the National Council of Croats and Slovenes in the Julian March. He also served as editor of the journal Socialna misel (Social Thought). In 1924, he was elected to the Italian Parliament on the unified list of Slovene, Croat and South Tyrolean parties. Besednjak thus became, together with the national liberal politician Josip Wilfan who was also elected on the same list, the highest representative of the around half a million South Slavs living in Italy. He quickly rose to prominence for his eloquent defence of minority rights against Fascist Italianization. Despite his consistent criticism of the regime, he insisted on the political loyalty to the Italian state. He did not join the Aventine Secession, but continued with regular parliamentary work until mid 1926. His parliamentary speeches, in which he defended minority rights, and human rights in general, from the early abuses of the Fascist regime, became famous among the Slovenes and Croats. Besednjak's speeches also attracted the attention of the Italian political scene and included parliamentary debates with the highest officials of the regime, including the Minister of Education Giovanni Gentile and Benito Mussolini himself. These speeches were printed in an integral version by Besednjak's journal Gori≈°ka stra≈æa, thus becoming widely known in the Slovene public. Several of his statements and punchlines entered the daily speech or acquired legendary status. His most famous speeches were directed against the school reform which sanctioned Italian as the sole language of education in Italy. In his last speech, delivered in the Italian Chamber of Deputies, he stated that, after the abolition of Slovene and Croatian language schools, every South Slavic family in Italy would transform itself into a school. In his concluding remark, he stated that \\"the laws of States are mutable, but Nations live forever\\", thus famously asserting the natural right of peoples before the established legal conventions.  In exile  In 1929, Besednjak emigrated to Argentina, but already the following year he returned to Europe in order to work at the Congress of European National Minorities in Vienna, serving as its vice- president.http://www2.arnes.si/~ljinz15/documents/prispevki/prispevki_00-1.htm Afterwards, he moved to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, settling in Belgrade. Throughout the interwar period, he remained a member of the Slovene People‚Äôs Party, supporting its centrist faction led by the Christian Democratic politician Andrej Gosar. After 1935, when the party leadership decided to support with the conservative Yugoslav government of Milan Stojadinoviƒá, Besednjak became increasingly critical of its policies. Although he remained a member of the Slovene People's Party, he became disenchanted with its authoritarian and corporatist shift. He spent the World War II years in Belgrade. Although he did not join any of the political factions fighting against the German occupation of Yugoslavia. Initially, he rejected both the partisan movement and Dra≈æa Mihajloviƒá's Chetniks, as well as the various collaborationist militias (such as the Slovene Home Guard). After 1943, he collaborated with the so-called \\"Catholic Centre\\", led by Jakob ≈†olar and Andrej Gosar in the Province of Ljubljana, and Virgil ≈†ƒçek in the Julian March, trying to keep a balance between the pro-Communist Liberation Front of the Slovenian People and various anti-Communist forces.Mira Cenƒçiƒç, 'Primorski kr≈°ƒçanski socialci: edina prava sredina med NOB in revolucijo na Slovenskem' In Kronika 5, 2 (2007) After 1944, however, he became increasingly supportive of Josip Broz Tito‚Äôs partisan movement, believing that the Communists would be the only force able to achieve the annexation of the Slovenian Littoral and Istria to Yugoslavia, as well as the only ones capable to keep the country together.Boris Mlakar, 'Gori≈°ka sredina' In Prispevki za novej≈°o zgodovino 57, 2 (1997)  Return to the Julian March  With the Paris Treaty of 1947, the Istrian peninsula and most of the Slovenian Littoral were annexed to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Gorizia and the Slovene-inhabited Venetian Slovenia remained part of Italy, while Trieste and the neighbouring villages were included in the Allied-administered Free Territory of Trieste. In 1950, Besednjak settled in Trieste. There, he was among the co-founders of the Slovene Christian Social Union, which later merged with other Slovene democratic and anti-Communist parties in Italy into the Slovene Union. After the annexation of the Province of Trieste to Italy in 1954, he retired from public life. In the late 1950s, he published a memoir dedicated to his friend and collaborator Virgil ≈†ƒçek. The text remains, to this days, one of the most comprehensive sources on the Slovene and Croat political movement in the Julian March under the Kingdom of Italy. He died in Trieste in 1968.

SIT was formed in 1976 as a private, not-for-profit, professional school under the provisions of Title 10 of the Code of Alabama. Its purpose was to provide professional-level continuing education and graduate degree programs in engineering, management, and applied science for career advancement, updating, and redirection. SIT received 501(c)(3) status from the Internal Revenue Service, allowing gifts to the Institute to be tax deductible. SIT was Approved and Licensed by the Alabama Department of Education under Title 16-46-1 through 10, Code of Alabama, authorizing the Institute to conduct educational programs and to award degrees. The school is now inactive, but can be reached electronically at SIT-Email@comcast.net or mail to P.O. Box 1485, Huntsville, AL. Professional school As a professional school, SIT differed from standard academic institutions in a number of important ways: *SIT was under the control of a Board of Directors representing the professional community. *SIT's faculty was composed exclusively of professional practitioners, teaching and advising on a part-time basis. *Application, rather than theory, was emphasized in all courses and programs. *SIT granted professional degrees, as contrasted with academic degrees. Origin and History The Huntsville metropolitan area has one of the highest concentrations of engineers and scientists in the United States, and is the home of hundreds of high- technology industrial and governmental organizations. In the early 1970s, an ad hoc committee examined the special educational needs of this community. They concluded that although the two existing local universities ‚Äì The University of Alabama in Huntsville and Alabama A&M; University ‚Äì had excellent academic programs, there was an urgent need for instruction at the advanced level and emphasizing applications. Southeastern Institute of Technology was then planned as a stand-alone professional school, with the purpose of meeting the special needs of this high-technology community. The planners included individuals who had previously been involved in the graduate programs and continuing education then available in Huntsville, and understood the potential students as well as the shortcomings of the existing offerings. SIT opened in September 1976, and awarded its first master's degrees in August 1977. Over the following two decades, the school was well received, serving several thousand students and awarding hundreds of degrees. In this same period, however, offerings of a similar nature slowly became available from the local state-supported schools. By 2004, the SIT Board decided that the original purpose of the school was no longer valid and duplication of effort was not in the community's best interest. SIT was placed in an inactive status, not accepting new students or offering classroom courses. The school continues, however, as an entity, allowing the completion of degree requirements by the many students who were near the end of their master's and doctoral studies. The following information concerns SIT when it was in full operation. Characteristics Southeastern Institute of Technology operated as a non-traditional institution in many aspects, but was highly traditional in others. The primary characteristics were as follows: *All courses were at an advanced level, emphasized the applied aspects of subjects, and expected appropriate backgrounds in mathematics and computer use. *Instruction was delivered in classroom environments or via Distance Learning. *The faculty was composed of highly qualified professional practitioners working in the subject areas. *Operations were designed to best accommodate non-traditional students (adults, part-time, and working). *Holding U.S. citizenship or a permanent residence status was required for students to be admitted to degree programs. *Regular admission to degree programs required practical experience (two years for a master's and five years for a doctorate). *Only professional degrees were awarded, and the degree requirements were comparable to those of the best of traditional schools. Terms, Credits, and Grading Instruction was given in eight-week periods, designated \\"Terms\\" (i.e., Early Fall Term, Winter Term, etc.). With six terms in a school year, only four weeks of off-time was available. Classes usually met twice weekly in the late afternoon or early evening, or on Saturdays. This schedule was designed to be optimum for part- time students, allowing good progress toward a degree while pursuing one course at a time. Credit for course completion was expressed in \\"Units,\\" the equivalent of Semester Hours. Most courses were available for 3 Units, and met for 40 class hours of 50 minutes each. Courses taken on a non-credit basis were awarded the standard Continuing Education Units (CEUs). Grading was High Pass, Pass, Low Pass, and Unsatisfactory, earning 4, 3, 2, and 0 Quality Points respectively. Degrees and Programs Programs of study were available leading to the following professional degrees: *Master of Science (M.Sc.) *Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc. Eng.) *Master of Science in Management (M.Sc. Mgt.) *Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) *Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) *Doctor of Management (D.Mgt.) In some years, certain other degrees were available, mainly the Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) and Doctor of Business Administration (D.B.A.). Persons with considerable senior- level experience but who had not completed a college degree might be admitted to pursue a combined Bachelor's-Master's Program. In this, they were required to complete the equivalent of at least 120 semester hours credit plus the necessary credit for the master's degree. Upon program completion, a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree was awarded simultaneously with the master's degree. Program specializations included the following areas: *Radar and Signal Processing *Optics and Electro-Optics *Missile and Space Systems *Advanced Computers and Software *Intelligence Technologies and Management *Cost Estimating and Analysis *Contracts and Procurement Management *Science and Engineering Management. Requirements for a master's degree included 30-36 Units credit with a 3.0 QPA; a master's project ‚Äì an in-depth professional report ‚Äì was included. For the doctoral degree, 48 Units of post-master's credit were required, including 27 Units at a 3.3 QPA in advanced coursework and 21 Units in research. As previously noted, experience was required for regular admission to the graduate-degree programs; two years for master's degrees and five years for doctoral degrees. A candidate for the D.Eng. degree was also required to be a Registered Professional Engineer. Facilities The main facilities for SIT were in a commercial office building in the Cummings Research Park. These included the administrative offices, classrooms, a computer laboratory, and a library with some 10,000 volumes and hundreds of journal and magazine series. The Redstone Science Information Center, one of the largest technical libraries in the United States, was also available at nearby Redstone Arsenal. The Center for Applied Research was a subsidiary of SIT. Adjacent to the main facility, this was used for contracted research. SIT had a facility clearance and was eligible to conduct classified instruction and research. Classified courses, however, were conducted in government facilities. During the 1980s, SIT had an instructional activity in South Africa. Also, support was given under a government subcontract to activities in Egypt. Accreditation and Recognition There are two general types of educational accreditation: institutional and programmatic. In the United States, there is no governmental body responsible for either type of accreditation. Instead, there are membership associations for granting accreditation. As a consequence of limitations described below, Southeastern Institute of Technology was neither accredited nor ever sought accreditation. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) is the regional body for institutional accreditation of traditional academic schools. As an independent professional school with many non-traditional characteristics, Southeastern Institute of Technology was not eligible for SACS accreditation. While there are national bodies providing institutional accreditation for non- traditional schools, their members are mainly for-profit schools and the accreditation has limited recognition. The recognized body for programmatic accreditation in engineering and applied science (including computing) was the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, now called ABET, Inc. This accreditation is essentially for undergraduate degree programs; also, ABET does not accredit programs from independent professional schools. For programmatic accreditation in management, the primary cognizant body is the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP). This accreditation is limited to schools that have full institutional accreditation. The absence of accreditation was always clearly made known by SIT to potential students, as well as employing organizations. For employment purposes, accreditation is of less importance since a degree from an accredited school was required for regular admission to SIT. In the absence of accreditation eligibility, the Alabama State Department of Education periodically made comprehensive assessments of SIT and its degree programs as part of the licensing procedures. While not constituting accreditation, their assessment of \\"approved\\" was close to the equivalent. The acceptance of SIT as a provider of higher education is shown by all local government agencies and most regional industries in providing tuition assistance to attending students. Some government agencies occasionally sent students to SIT for full- time study. Graduates of SIT are found in senior technical and managerial positions throughout the United States. Some are also found in instruction and research positions at educational institutions.

Both graded manifolds and supermanifolds are phrased in terms of sheaves of graded commutative algebras. However, graded manifolds are characterized by sheaves on smooth manifolds, while supermanifolds are constructed by gluing of sheaves of supervector spaces. Graded manifolds A graded manifold of dimension (n,m) is defined as a locally ringed space (Z,A) where Z is an n-dimensional smooth manifold and A is a C^\\\\infty_Z-sheaf of Grassmann algebras of rank m where C^\\\\infty_Z is the sheaf of smooth real functions on Z. The sheaf A is called the structure sheaf of the graded manifold (Z,A), and the manifold Z is said to be the body of (Z,A). Sections of the sheaf A are called graded functions on a graded manifold (Z,A). They make up a graded commutative C^\\\\infty(Z)-ring A(Z) called the structure ring of (Z,A). The well-known Batchelor theorem and Serre-Swan theorem characterize graded manifolds as follows. Serre-Swan theorem for graded manifolds Let (Z,A) be a graded manifold. There exists a vector bundle E\\\\to Z with an m-dimensional typical fiber V such that the structure sheaf A of (Z,A) is isomorphic to the structure sheaf of sections of the exterior product \\\\Lambda(E) of E, whose typical fibre is the Grassmann algebra \\\\Lambda(V). Let Z be a smooth manifold. A graded commutative C^\\\\infty(Z)-algebra is isomorphic to the structure ring of a graded manifold with a body Z if and only if it is the exterior algebra of some projective C^\\\\infty(Z)-module of finite rank. Graded functions Note that above mentioned Batchelor's isomorphism fails to be canonical, but it often is fixed from the beginning. In this case, every trivialization chart (U; z^A,y^a) of the vector bundle E\\\\to Z yields a splitting domain (U; z^A,c^a) of a graded manifold (Z,A), where {c^a} is the fiber basis for E. Graded functions on such a chart are \\\\Lambda(V)-valued functions f=\\\\sum_{k=0}^m \\\\frac1{k!}f_{a_1\\\\ldots a_k}(z)c^{a_1}\\\\cdots c^{a_k}, where f_{a_1\\\\cdots a_k}(z) are smooth real functions on U and c^a are odd generating elements of the Grassmann algebra \\\\Lambda(V). Graded vector fields Given a graded manifold (Z,A), graded derivations of the structure ring of graded functions A(Z) are called graded vector fields on (Z,A). They constitute a real Lie superalgebra \\\\partial A(Z) with respect to the superbracket [u,u']=u\\\\cdot u'-(-1)^{[u][u']}u'\\\\cdot u, where [u] denotes the Grassmann parity of u\\\\in \\\\partial A(Z). Graded vector fields locally read u= u^A\\\\partial_A + u^a\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial c^a}. They act on graded functions f by the rule u(f_{a_1\\\\ldots a_k}c^{a_1}\\\\cdots c^{a_k})=u^A\\\\partial_A(f_{a_1\\\\ldots a_k})c^{a_1}\\\\cdots c^{a_k}+ \\\\sum_i u^{a_i}(-1)^{i-1} f_{a_1\\\\ldots a_k}c^{a_1}\\\\cdots c^{a_{i-1}}c^{a_{i+1}}\\\\cdots c^{a_k}. Graded exterior forms The A(Z)-dual of the module graded vector fields \\\\partial A(Z) is called the module of graded exterior one-forms O^1(Z). Graded exterior one-forms locally read \\\\phi=\\\\phi_A dz^A + \\\\phi_adc^a so that the duality (interior) product between \\\\partial A(Z) and O^1(Z) takes the form u\\\\rfloor \\\\phi=u^A\\\\phi_A + (-1)^{[\\\\phi_a]}u^a\\\\phi_a. Provided with the graded exterior product dz^A\\\\wedge dc^i=-dc^i\\\\wedge dz^A, \\\\qquad dc^i\\\\wedge dc^j= dc^j\\\\wedge dc^i, graded one-forms generate the graded exterior algebra O^*(Z) of graded exterior forms on a graded manifold. They obey the relation \\\\phi\\\\wedge\\\\phi'=(-1)^{\\\\phi\\\\phi' +[\\\\phi][\\\\phi']}\\\\phi'\\\\wedge\\\\phi, where \\\\phi denotes the form degree of \\\\phi. The graded exterior algebra O^*(Z) is a graded differential algebra with respect to the graded exterior differential d\\\\phi= dz^A \\\\wedge \\\\partial_A\\\\phi +dc^a\\\\wedge \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial c^a}\\\\phi, where the graded derivations \\\\partial_A, \\\\partial/\\\\partial c^a are graded commutative with the graded forms dz^A and dc^a. There are the familiar relations d(\\\\phi\\\\wedge\\\\phi')=d(\\\\phi)\\\\wedge\\\\phi' +(-1)^{\\\\phi}\\\\phi\\\\wedge d\\\\phi'. Graded differential geometry In the category of graded manifolds, one considers graded Lie groups, graded bundles and graded principal bundles. One also introduces the notion of jets of graded manifolds, but they differ from jets of graded bundles. Graded differential calculus The differential calculus on graded manifolds is formulated as the differential calculus over graded commutative algebras similarly to the differential calculus over commutative algebras. Physical outcome Due to the above-mentioned Serre- Swan theorem, odd classical fields on a smooth manifold are described in terms of graded manifolds. Extended to graded manifolds, the variational bicomplex provides the strict mathematical formulation of Lagrangian classical field theory and Lagrangian BRST theory.

The market stood from 1830 until February 7, 1878, when it was destroyed by a tornado. A year later, the column was moved to the opposite corner of what is now 5th Street and used to display advertisements by Theodore Eye's Broad Street Grocery. In 1930, the town of Augusta hired a press agency to help stimulate its economy. The New York City-based firm AuLockhart International, Inc. was hired and given a budget of $37,500 to $50,000 to create and publish an advertising campaign aimed at attracting tourists. The firm published a ghost story about the pillar in newspapers across the country. The story refers to the pillar as ‚ÄúThe Haunted Pillar.‚Äù According to local folk-lore, a preacher who was denied the right to preach there, \\"... threatened that a great wind would destroy the place except for one pillar and that whoever tried to remove this remaining pillar would be struck dead,\\" according to a person interviewed by The Augusta Chronicle. The market was located directly in the middle of Broad Street, and once it was removed Augustans were reluctant to build there again. \\"Now that the Market House is in ruins, we think it may be opportune to suggest that it never be rebuilt upon the same spot. It was, at best, an unsightly edifice and marred the grand boulevard upon which it was mistakenly located,\\" said an article in The Augusta Chronicle a week after the market was destroyed. On December 17, 2016, the pillar was destroyed in a car collision.

These may be disguised as a tax, some other common fee or a bogus service, and may be several dollars or even just a few cents. The crammer's intent is that the subscriber will overlook and ultimately pay these small charges without them knowing what it's all about. According to the U.S. National Association of Attorneys General, cramming was the 4th most common consumer complaint of 2007 in the United States. Types There are various forms of cramming. Phone cramming Phone cramming is the practice of placing unauthorized charges on a telecommunication subscriber's home or mobile telephone bill. Cramming is most common in the US, where the breakup of the Bell System left subscribers with different vendors for local and long- distance service. LEC billing consolidated charges from multiple vendors on one bill, but opened an opportunity (which does not exist elsewhere) for fraudulent vendors to add their own charges to the consolidated bills. This is not the same as telephone slamming, where an existing vendor is replaced with a rival without the client's informed consent. In the UK all the UK mobile operators have a third party direct to bill scheme (chargetomobile 'payforit') controlled by the Payforit Scheme Rules which prevent unauthorised charging. In the USA an effort to prevent instances of cramming, some members of the third party billing industry have implemented screening and monitoring measures to identify and eliminate crammers. Some companies offer consumer protection websites to help consumers better understand their phone bill and detect cramming as soon as it occurs. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) estimates that cramming has impacted tens of millions of American households. Web cramming Web cramming involves billing consumers for a web page they did not even know they had. > This is most often accomplished when criminals develop new web pages for > small businesses and non-profit groups for little or no expense. While > advertising their service as free, these criminals actually engage in > unauthorized phone charges on their victim's accounts. The most common scam > involves \\"rebate checks.\\" These checks, when cashed, transfer the customer's > Internet service provider, placing monthly service charges on their > telephone bill. This is made possible because telecommunications companies > provide the service of being able to collect bills for companies that > perform a service over the telephone. Preacquired accounts Another is \\"preacquired account telemarketing fraud\\", cramming of unauthorized charges by telemarketers who have bought or obtained consumer account information prior to the telemarketing call, sometimes from the consumer's own bank. Fighting cramming Phone companies like Verizon respond by removing cramming charges from a consumer's bill upon request, and will cease business with the company that crams. Verizon, at the customer's request, will put a Cramming Block on the customer's account, that prevents third parties from adding charges. All the UK mobile operators have a third-party direct-to-bill scheme (chargetomobile 'payforit') controlled by the Payforit Scheme Rules which prevent unauthorised charges. Notable cases In 2005, the Gambino Family admitted to running a cramming operation. Following a Federal Communications Commission investigation, in October 2010, Verizon announced that it would refund up to $50 million to its customers to offset cramming charges. In October 2014, AT&T; Mobility agreed to pay $105 million in refunds and penalties for cramming for premium-rated short messages; the agreement was the largest such settlement in history; AT&T; was \\"accused of keeping at least 35% of the fees, as well as obscuring the charges on bills and preventing customers from securing full refunds.\\" See also *Mail and wire fraud References Category:Consumer fraud Category:Internet fraud Category:Personal finance Category:Text messaging ","title":"Cramming (fraud)"},{"id":"24519542","text":"A Man Called Magnum (in original Italian Napoli si ribella) is a 1977 poliziotteschi film.

Biography Arbuzov was born in Moscow, but his family moved to Petrograd in 1914. Orphaned at the age of eleven, he found salvation in the theatre, and at fourteen he began to work in the Mariinsky Theatre. In 1928 he joined a group of young actors in the Guild of Experimental Drama; after its dissolution he joined a traveling agitprop theater for which he began to write plays. He moved to Moscow in 1930; in 1935 he wrote the play Dal'nyaya doroga (A long road) and in 1939 Tanya, his two most successful plays. Avril Pyman writes of him, \\"The charm of his work lies in his shrewd but affectionate attitude to his fellow-man; he sees through human foibles to the basic desire to lead a good and useful life, and creates plausible, even likeable, 'positive' characters.\\"Avril Pyman in A.K. Thorlby (ed.), The Penguin Companion to Literature: European (Penguin, 1969), p. 61. Several of Arbuzov's plays deal with personal transformation and redemption within a Soviet context. In Tanya (1939), a woman whose life is shattered by the death of her husband finally finds meaning and purpose serving the sick in a Siberian village. An Irkutsk Story (1960) describes how the shallow and hedonistic life of 25-year-old Valya is transformed by the love of Sergei, foreman of an excavator crew building a dam in Siberia. Following the death of Sergei in a drowning accident, she finds new meaning in joining the construction crew and raising her children. This affectionate immersion into the emotional lives of his characters brought rebukes from some Soviet literary critics. For example, Dmitry Shcheglov wrote, \\"Upon turning to a play by Arbuzov, we are engulfed in a pleasant atmosphere of universal love, nobility, and friendship; however, these fine feelings fail to guide us, to mobilize us, or to direct our minds and thoughts toward a great goal.\\"Shcheglov, D. \\"Novatorstvo i inertsiya formy,\\" Teatr, VIII (1954), p. 73. Arbuzov's characters embrace the communist ideal of working to build a classless society, but it is the celebration of their personal struggles that endeared Arbuzov to Soviet audiences.Roberts, S.

History=Founding At the time Titan was founded there was a shortage of new Harley-Davidsons, and those who were lucky enough to get a new one would quite often disassemble them and add lots of chrome custom parts. There was a market for fast available mildly customized bikes. These motorcycles had a registered name and a valid VIN and were easy to finance but at first not easy to insure due to bank uncertainty with the manufacturing processes. This carried over to the Blue-Book listing where it caused incorrect prices on these motorcycles and made it difficult for sellers to get the correct price. The few specialty motorcycles like the Titan Phoenix TRM Custom where only 25 were built, one at a time each bike built or put together by one person. Titan owners went public on the NASDAQ in 1997. First bankruptcy By 2001, the management had failed, then dealer and customer support failed and Titan filed for bankruptcy. Andrew Donald Proudfoot owned the largest Titan dealership in Florida and was stuck with a large inventory of Titan motorcycles. He also went to Titan's headquarters and bought the company in July 2001. Titan number 2 was born but went under due to the Company owing more to vendors than it had the capital to pay for their services. The new competition from companies like Big Dog, American IronHorse and many other Harley clones companies, and also because of a declining American motorcycle market since the beginning of 2007. Second bankruptcy In January 2007, Titan Motorcycles Cie (TMC) had filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In August 2007 an asset purchase agreement was signed between TMC (Titan Motorcycle Cie) debtor in-possession and Arizona Motorcycle Works as buyer where all assets of Titan were sold to Arizona Motorcycle Works. An Arizona bank called FNBA filed an objection to the proposed sale of now-bankrupt Titan's assets to Arizona Motorcycle Works claiming it has a first rights lien on Titan's assets and that the sale price undervalued the fair market value of the property. The bank also claims that Titan's owner Don Proudfoot and Hope Smith, a principal in Arizona Motorcycle Works, have a personal relationship and that the latter company is subtenant of Titan's and that this relationship has not been disclosed. These two allegations called into question that the proposed sale represents a \\"good-faith, arms-length negotiation\\" between the two entities, the complaint claimed. FNBA stated that Proudfoots‚Äô company, TMC Acquisitions, owes the bank about $813,000 on a $1.5 million business loan that the company took out in February 2006.

The afore mentioned section is the central section which runs from 17 Avenue SE to McCall Way; and the northern section which runs from Airport Road (the main entrance into the Calgary International Airport) to 128 Avenue NE. The central and northern sections of Barlow Trail is run roughly where the fifth meridian lies in the Dominion Land Survey. The road is named for Noel Barlow, a resident of Carseland, Alberta, Canada, who served as the ground crewman to Douglas Bader, a Royal Air Force flying ace in World War II.  History  Barlow Trail used to be the main northern entrance into the city of Calgary and was a continuous roadway. It served as a portion of Alberta Highway 2 from the northern city limits to Blackfoot Trail, near the present location of the Max Bell Centre. At that point, Highway 2 followed Blackfoot Trail to 66 Avenue SE (present-day Glenmore Trail) before turning south on Macleod Trail, while Barlow Trail continued south along 26 Street SE. In the early 1970s, Highway 2 was diverted to the new freeway as part of the Blackfoot Trail Freeway (present-day Deerfoot Trail) construction, resulting in Barlow Trail becoming a rural road north of 112 Avenue NE (present-day Country Hills Boulevard) and being re-designated as Highway 2A. In the late 1970s, Deerfoot Trail was extended further south, resulting in the direct connection to Blackfoot Trail being removed in favour of using 17 Avenue SE, and Barlow Trail being realigned as part of the construction of the Peigan Trail interchange. As part of the construction, direct movement to 26 Avenue SE was removed in favour of the southern section of Barlow Trail accessing Deerfoot Trail, and subsequent traffic calming removed direct access south of 17 Avenue SE. In the 1980s, the city of Calgary annexed land north of the airport, resulting in the Highway 2A designation being removed. Barlow Trail was the primary route to the Calgary International Airport until the 2001 completion of Airport Trail, where the primary north-south entrance to the airport was diverted to the Airport Trail via the Deerfoot Trail. Barlow Trail functioned as an alternate route to the airport until April 3, 2011, where the section of Barlow Trail between 48 Avenue NE and Airport Road was permanently closed in order to provide space for a new runway. In the late 2000s, as part of the construction of the northeast portion of Stoney Trail, access to Rocky View County was closed.  Future  The section of Barlow Trail north of Country Hills Boulevard is being reconstructed and realigned as part of the Stonegate Landing business park development. Barlow Trail will be upgraded to an arterial road to 128 Avenue NE, and continue north as Barlow Crescent, where it will circle back to 128 Avenue NE and continue south as 36 Street NE.

The district contains structures associated with the copper mines worked by the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company, located along a line above the copper lode, where railroad tracks connected separate mine heads.Calumet and Hecla Industrial District from the state of Michigan The Historic District is completely contained in the Calumet Historic District (a National Historic Landmark District) and the Keweenaw National Historical Park. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1973 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.  History  The copper lode underneath the Calumet and Hecla Industrial District was discovered in 1858 by Edwin J. Hulbert, who immediately garnered investors, bought the property, and established the Hulbert Mining Company. The Hulbert Mining Company had two subsidiaries: the Calumet Mining Company and the Hecla Mining Company. Hulbert began mining operations in the area, but his inexperience resulted in low yields. In 1867, his investors replaced him with Alexander Agassiz. Under Agassiz's management, the Calumet and Hecla mines rapidly increased production, and by 1870 were producing over half of the United States' copper. In 1871, the Calumet and Hecla Mining Companies were consolidated, along with the Scott and Portland Mining Companies, to form the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company.Charles K. Hyde, Diane B. Abbott, Historic American Engineering Record, The Upper peninsula of Michigan: an inventory of historic engineering and industrial sites, Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation, US Department of Interior, 1978, pp. 8-16. Agassiz was the president of the newly incorporated company, a position he held until his death in 1910. The company prospered under his leadership; in particular it underwent substantial growth between 1880 and 1910, when most of these buildings currently standing in the district were built. However, after a 1913 mining strike, the company gradually declined, and was weakened further by the onset of the Great Depression. Finally, in 1968, the company was purchased by Universal Oil Products, who closed the Keweenaw mines for good.  Buildings  Locations of structures in this historic district. Structures included are in dark blue; other Calumet and Hecla Industrial structures are in light blue. There are ten buildings in the district:Calumet and Hecla Industrial District NRHP nomination form the Machine Shop, the \\"Blacksmith Shop,\\" (misidentified as such; actually the Pipe Shop), the Roundhouse, Warehouse #2, the Superior Boilerhouse, the Gearhouse, the General Office Building, the Library, the Bathhouse, and the Miscowaubik Club. These structures, constructed primarily during the 1880s, represent the second generation of mine buildings constructed at the site; the earliest structures were destroyed by fire or razed. These buildings are part of a larger industrial complex of mine-related buildings, originally built by the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company, that still stand in the area along Calumet Avenue and Mine Street.  Machine Shop (c. 1882)  Machine Shop The machine shop is a two-story structure, long and wide, made of coursed mine rock with a hipped gable roof covered in corrugated sheet metal.Machine Shop, Mine Street, Calumet, Houghton County, MI, HABS MI-432, Kevin Harrington and Wendy Nicholas, Historic American Buildings Survey, 1975. A clerestory window admits light to the interior, which is floored in concrete. The original machine shop was designed around 1882 by Erasmus D. Leavitt Jr., a consulting engineer with Calumet & Hecla; it was used to repair large equipment, including mining skips and trams. A major reconstruction was performed in 1907, and additions were made in 1911; it is likely that the building in its current form dates entirely from these two years.  Blacksmith Shop (Pipe Shop) (1883)  The blacksmith shop, built in 1883, is a hipped-roof structure built of rock, measuring by 54 feet and roofed with corrugated metal. It was originally used as a locomotive house for the narrow gauge Calumet & Hecla railroad.Blacksmith Shop, Off of Mine Street, behind Machine Shop, Calumet, Houghton County, MI, HABS MI-437, Kevin Harrington and Wendy Nicholas, Historic American Buildings Survey, 1974 It was later used as a smith shop; an addition was constructed in 1904.  Roundhouse (1888)  The roundhouse is built of coursed mine rock masonry in the shape of a semicircle with a turntable in the center. The original structure, built in 1888 to service locomotives for the Hecla and Torch Lake Railroad, ran approximately 170 degrees around the turntable,Calumet & Hecla Roundhouse, Northeast corner of Mine & Depot Streets, Calumet, Houghton County, MI, HABS MI-428, Kevin Harrington, Historic American Buildings Survey, 1975. and had twelve train stalls ranging from deep on the south end and deep on the north. The structure is built of random mine rock with brick arches over the windows with a shed roof. Train bay doors are spanned with cast iron lintels. A later addition from 1902 increased the circumferential span of the building by 55 degrees, adding five train bays. In 1907, three additions were made: a small shed and drying house, and a by machine shop. The machine shop was roofed by a low gable, and the eaves and construction matched that of the original structure. Finally, in 1928 an by storage area.  Warehouse #2  Warehouse number 2 was constructed with rail tracks running through it so that large items could be loaded inside.  Superior Boilerhouse (1880)  The original Superior Boilerhouse, built in 1880, is a by structure, constructed of coursed rubble, with a steeply hipped roof and an attached brick smokestack measuring tall. An addition built in 1895, known as the \\"New Boilerhouse,\\"Calumet & Hecla Mining Company, Superior Boilerhouse, Mine Street, Calumet, Houghton County, MI, HABS MI-429, Kevin Harrington and Wendy Nicholas, Historic American Buildings Survey, 1975 measures by 69 feet. Both the original boilerhouse and the addition were designed by Erasmus D. Leavit, Jr., and were intended to supply steam to the nearby enginehouse.  Gearhouse (c. 1890)  The gearhouse is constructed from rough sandstone and mine rock with a steeply pitched roof. It measures by . The structure was first built sometime in the 1880s, but was rebuilt in the 1890s after a disastrous fire. The original use of this building was housing the main pumping engine equipment;Gearhouse, Mine Street across from Calumet High School, Calumet, Houghton County, MI, HABS MI-435, Kevin Harrington and Wendy Nicholas, Historic American Buildings Survey, 1975 however, in 1892 it was converted to use as an electrical power house, and used as such until a new power plant was built in Lake Linden in 1906.  General Office Building (c. 1890)  General Office Building, now the Park Headquarters The General Office Building is a -story office building built of reddish-brown stone trimmed with brick.General Office, Red Jacket Road at Calumet Avenue, Calumet, Houghton County, MI, HABS MI-434, Kevin Harrington and Wendy Nicholas, Historic American Buildings Survey, 1974 It was used as a general mine operation center, and also housed engineering and accounting departments.Industrial Calumet: A guide to the Calumet & Hecla Copper Mining Company industrial site, National Park Service The original building was designed in the early 1890s by the Boston firm of Shaw and Hunnewell; two later additions, architecturally faithful to the original, were designed by the Marquette firm of Charlton and Kuenzli. Of these three sections, the eastern section measures by , the western section by , and the northern section by 35 feet. The building currently serves as the headquarters for the Keweenaw National Historical Park.  Library (1898)  Library, now the Park History Center Like the office building, the library was designed by Shaw and Hunnewell. The building is two-and-a-half stories high, built of rough masonry trimmed with brick around the windows, and with brick quoins. It is built in a \\"T\\" shape, with the main wing measuring by and the south wing by 32 feet. The roof is formed from two intersecting gables covered with dark grey slate. The building was originally designed to house adult and children's reading rooms on the second floor, library stacks, office space, and cloakrooms on the first floor, and baths for men, women, and children in the basement.Calumet & Hecla Public Library, 101 Red Jacket Road, Calumet, Houghton County, MI, HABS MI-426, Wendy Nicholas, Historic American Buildings Survey, 1975 Small alterations were made over the next few years, including adding a west entrance porch, reconfiguring the baths, and adding more shelves. In 1911, a new bathhouse was constructed, and the bath section of the library was remodeled to provide additional stack space. However, as the fortunes of the Calumet & Hecla Mining Company declined, support for the library became difficult. In 1944, the library collection was transferred to the Calumet High School, and the building was converted to office space. The library currently serves as the Keweenaw History Center, housing historical artifacts and archives. The library is significant as a notable example of the paternalism of corporations at the time, as well as being a striking example of sophisticated design and stonework.  Bathhouse (1910)  Bathhouse The bathhouse was constructed in 1910.Bathhouse, Calumet Avenue at Depot Street intersection, Calumet, Houghton County, MI, HABS MI-433, Kevin Harrington and Wendy Nicholas, Historic American Buildings Survey, 1974 The building also served as the home of Calumet-based television station WBKP from its sign-on in 1996 until it moved from the area in 2001.  Miscowaubik Club (c. 1875)  Miscowaubik Club The Miscowaubik Club was originally built as a private home, reportedly in about 1875 for chief mining engineer Thomas Hoatson. Miscowaubik Club, Calumet Avenue, Calumet, Houghton County, MI, HABS MI-276, Kevin Harrington and Wendy Nicholas, Historic American Buildings Survey, 1974. The structure is a -story wood-framed house with a gable roof, measuring by 83 feet. In 1903, the house was converted into a private club by the firm of Parker, Thomas, and Rice. The house has undergone extensive interior and exterior remodeling.

Anny Street in the UNESCO-protected historic centre of Krak√≥w, Poland. It is one of the leading examples of Polish Baroque architecture designed by Tylman van Gameren, however, the church's history dates back to 14th century.  History  The church was first mentioned in 1381 in the deed of donation of Sulis≈Çaw I Nawoja of Grodziec.The sources simply say \\"of Grodziec\\". There are several inhabited places and a castle of that name. It is unclear, and may never be known, which Grodziec this was. In 1407 the church was completely destroyed during a fire, but it was rebuilt the same year in the Gothic style by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. The king also attached the Church formally to the Jagiellonian University by giving it the right to nominate the parish priest. In 1428 the choir was reconstructed and enlarged. By a charter dated October 27, 1535 St. Anne's was raised to the rank of a collegiate church. In 1689 the Gothic edifice was demolished as it proved too small for the growing cult of Saint John Cantius, the patron saint of the Jagiellonian University who's laid to rest there.

The architect was a Polonized Dutchman Tylman van Gameren, a chief architect at the court of John III Sobieski. The interior stucco decoration is the work of Baldassarre Fontana, and the polychromy assisted by painters and brothers Carlo and Innocente Monti and Karl Dankwart of Nysa. The painting of St. Anne in the high altar is the work of Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter, court painter of King John III Sobieski. The 18th-century paintings in the stalls showing the life of Saint Anne are by Szymon Czechowicz. In the transept there is an altar of the adoration of the cross to the left, and the tomb of John Cantius to the right.

The sequence began with The Big Sky,Big Sky (1947) followed by The Way West (which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1950),Way West (1949) These Thousand Hills,Thousand Hills (1956) Arfive (1971), The Last Valley (1975), and Fair Land, Fair Land.Land, Fair Land (1982) The first three books in chronological story sequence (but not in the sequence of publishing) ‚Äî The Big Sky, The Way West, and Fair Land, Fair Land ‚Äî are in themselves a complete trilogy, starting in 1830 with Boone Caudill leaving Kentucky to become a mountain man and ending with the death of Caudill and later the death of Dick Summers in the 1870s. In his \\"Author's note\\" at the beginning of the novel, Guthrie wrote that he had \\"sworn more than once to write no more about the early-day West and just as often have broken the vow.\\" He wrote that with Fair Land, Fair Land he was breaking the vow again to fill the time gap, \\"roughly from 1845 to 1870,\\" between The Way West and These Thousand Hills. In its view of the white settlement of the American west, Fair Land, Fair Land is the bleakest book in the series. The most positively portrayed whites are mountain men and those who choose to live with the Native Americans and adopt their ways, such as Dick Summers and Hezekiah Higgins. Other whites range from settlers who don't realize they are despoiling an Eden, to destructively careless wealth seekers, and to deliberately evil murderers. Plot Fair Land, Fair Land begins where The Way West ends, with Dick Summers riding away from the group of \\"wagon-train people\\" he has guided from Independence to Oregon, but Summers leaves without saying goodbye and while the settlers are still sleeping. As a mountain man traveling light, all Summers carries is his Hawken rifle, \\"his old Green River knife, some ammunition and a small sack of possibles.\\"Fair Land, Fair Land, Chapter 1. As he rides Summers remembers the events of The Big Sky of about fifteen years before when he was the hunter for a French trading expedition traveling up the Missouri in a keelboat to Blackfeet country, a trip that ended with the Blackfeet killing all the Frenchmen and only the three friends, Summers, Boone Caudill, and Jim Deakins, escaping.Chapter 1. Summers meets and shares a jug with a man who mentions having encountered Boone Caudill, \\"The broodiest bastard I ever see. Turn on you for nothin'.\\" Caudill admitted to the man that he killed his best friend, Jim Deakins, for fathering a child with Teal Eye, Caudill's Blackfoot \\"squaw.\\"Chapter 2. Dick Summers re-encounters a band of his settlers that had separated from the main group in order to drive their stock by land while the main group had finished by river.Chapter 3 In the band is Hezekiah \\"Hig\\" Higgins. Hig idolizes Summers and Summers has seen throughout The Way West what a valuable man Hig is. Higgins and Summers join together and spend most of the rest of Fair Land, Fair Land together, first as nomadic mountain men in an idyllic type of life that is rapidly disappearing and then as relatively settled men living with Indian wives. Summers meets Teal Eye again, becomes her mate, and adopts her blind son, who in Indian fashion has been given a descriptive name, \\"Nocansee.\\" Summers and Teal Eye have another son, Lije, and are ultimately able to have a white marriage ceremony, conducted by their friend Brother Potter.Chapters 13 to 18 Nocansee was a red-headed baby, but was the natural son of Boone Caudill, who years before had killed his red-headed best friend, Jim Deakins, because Caudill wrongly thought Teal Eye had cheated on him with Deakins.See The Big Sky. Dick Summers and Teal Eye arrange for Hig to marry a Shoshone chief's granddaughter, Little Wing, and the ceremony is performed by Summers.Chapters 22 to 24 The years pass. Hig and Little Wing never have children. Summers forces Lije to leave him and Teal Eye with Brother Potter because Summers sees the end coming for their Native American way of life and that Lije must become educated in how to live in a white world.Chapters 32 to 33 Higgins learns that Boone Caudill will be passing through the area on his way to hunt gold in California and tells Summers. When Summers meets Caudill on the trail and confronts him with the facts that Caudill unjustly killed his best friend, Caudill leaps on Summers and attempts to strangle him. Although he has his knife in his hand and will die if Caudill continues the throttling, Summers cannot bring himself to stab. He is losing consciousness when he hears a shot‚ÄîHig has killed Caudill and afterward says, \\"He didn't mean nothin' to me.\\"Chapters 25 to 26 A.B. Guthrie writes of the white destruction of the Eden of Montana. For example, greedy white men discover gold in Alder Gulch, resulting in despoiling of the area, corruption, and violence.Chapters 28 to 31 Or, one afternoon Dick Summers hears a shot and discovers that a boy has gut-shot Summers's best horse, thinking he was shooting an elk or a deer. The horse is suffering, but having caused so much damage the foolish but sorry boy cannot bring himself to complete the job‚Äî\\"I couldn't ... not a horse.\\" Summers is forced to shoot the horse.Chapter 35 Higgins and Little Wing leave Summers and Teal Eye to return to Little Wing's Shoshone people.Chapter 34 Dick Summers, Teal Eye, and Nocansee are living in the village of the Blackfoot chief Heavy Runner when the Indian agency orders all the Blackfeet chiefs to a meeting because of Indian horse stealing and a recent Indian killing of a white man. Heavy Runner asks Dick Summers to go with him to speak for the Indians.Chapter 36 Running the meeting are two men: General Sully, the superintendent of Indian Affairs, and U.S. Marshal Wheeler. The only Blackfeet to have shown up are peaceful ones, and the band that committed the worst crimes, including the recent murder, doesn't appear. Summers is surprised to find his son Lije standing behind Sully and Wheeler, ill-at-ease as part of the Army and as their interpreter. The fruitless meeting concludes with General Sully telling the chiefs that they must surrender the killers of the white man and return the stolen stock.Chapter 37 After the Army's time limit has passed with no surrender of murderers and no return of stock, officers plan \\"A secret mission, a stealing out to kill Blackfeet, a surprise attack.\\" The meeting, at which Lije is deliberately degraded to be a servant pouring whiskey, is conducted by Major Baker, perhaps the most overtly evil person in the novel: \\"This time we show them that we mean business. No prisoners ... I swear this is the last time, so bear with me, gentlemen.\\" As Major Baker plans the slaughter of the Blackfeet he acknowledges that in the dawn attack on the villages the January weather will be cold, but \\"Think of that other enemy, the Blackfeet, all huddled in camp against the cold. ... Sitting ducks.\\" Lije calls him a fool for attacking such chiefs as Heavy Runner, who is friendly and \\"has a friendship paper\\" from the government. Major Baker has Lije put in the guardhouse, where, after having thought over his life, Lije reaches between the bars and breaks a window, the implication being that he is getting the glass in order to commit suicide.Chapter 38 In the morning several days later, Dick Summers wakes up to someone shouting \\"Wrong camp\\" and from the flap of his tepee sees Heavy Runner trot out of his lodge \\"waving his friendship paper\\" and be immediately shot down. Summers makes Teal Eye escape through a hole in the rear of their tepee and then sits to await his fate. A soldier looks in and remarks that Summers is a white man. The soldier also sees the nonwhite Nocansee sitting quietly. When Summers tells him that Nocansee is blind, the soldier responds that then he need not waste a bullet and clubs Nocansee to death with the butt of his carbine. Summers shoots the soldier in the forehead with his Hawken, the rifle he has carried and relied upon throughout the trilogy. Two more soldiers come in and shoot Summers as \\"a turncoat son of a bitch\\" who \\"Killed his own kind.\\" The novel ends with Summers drifting into unconsciousness and death, hearing the sounds of the soldiers destroying the village and \\"the wailing of squaws and the crying of children and the voices of soldiers proud of themselves.\\"Chapter 39.

CORE was formed by NDP Premier Michael Harcourt. These collaborative processes focused on four British Columbia regions: Vancouver Island, the Cariboo-Chilcotin, and the East and West Kootenays. The accomplishments of each region was varied, but none were able to reach full agreement on land use designation.Cashore, Benjamin, George Hoberg, Michael Howlett, Jeremy Rayner, and Jeremy Wilson (eds.). (2001) In Search of Sustainability: Forest Policy in British Columbia in the 1990s. UBC Press, Vancouver, B.C. 329 pp.  Results  In 1994, CORE published the Provincial Land Use Strategy and called for the objectives described in these plans to be legally binding. Lack of political will resulted in inaction, and land use objectives outside of protected areas were not made legal. The draft integrated land use plans for the four areas created too much controversy and the Provincial government was concerned about CORE as an independent body creating so much political backlash, so the Cabinet reclaimed direct control of the land use planning process and placed it under leadership of a new interministry Land Use Co-ordination Office (LUCO). LUCO not only continued the initial participatory planning process but over the next decade expanded it to cover most of the province. Plans for some areas such as Vancouver Island fell short of public expectations. In contrast a most notable accomplishment was the plan for the vast northern Muskwa-Ketchika area. By 2006 over 85% of the Province was covered by 26 approved regional plans (LRMPs). The program continued even after the election of a new Liberal government. Most notable was extension of plans to the mid coast area; more popularly known as the Great Bear Rainforest. Although these regional plans do not resolve all land use conflicts between First Nations, conservation, energy, forestry and mining interests they do provide a framework for decision making and resource allocation. And most notable an outcome of the Land Use Strategy was the associated success of the Protected Area Strategy(PAS) which identified hundreds of areas for inclusion in the provincial parks system which by 2001 had expanded from 6% to meet the IUCN target of 12%. As of January 2015 that parks and protected areas system now includes 1029 designated areas which totals 14,042,696 ha. BC will likely be one of a very few government jurisdictions to meet the new international target of 17% and steps are underway for designation of numerous new Marine Protected Areas.(MPA's) Although CORE was not there to see the fulfillment of their lofty objectives they initiated a participatory regional integrated land use planning process over next two decades with some remarkable outcomes.

It lies in the parish of Church Aston. Roman coins and medieval artifacts have been discovered in the village and it is listed in the Domesday Book 1066 with a population of 23 households, 13.5 plough lands and a mill. The historic manor covers 1,306 acres and includes the townships of Brockton and Stockton. Sites of historic importance include: Longford Hall, a late 16th-century dovecote, Church of St Mary, 13th century Talbot Chapel, remains of a mill race and several farm buildings. During the English Civil War, the Battle of Longford was fought here. On 25 March 1644, Colonel Thomas Mytton, commanding 500 Parliamentarians, was headed for the Royalist (\\"Cavaliers\\") strongholds of Lilleshall Abbey and Lea Castle, paused at Longford that was garrisoned by Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") to rest his men. There, however, Sir William Vaughan and Colonel Robert Ellice leading local Royalist forces found Mytton and routed him. Having driven off Mytton, the Royalists then besieged the small garrison which took shelter in Longford Hall. The Hall held out for a week before surrendering to the Royalists 2 April 1644. In the late fall of 1645, Oliver Cromwell appeared before Longford. The village was quickly taken and the General immediately placed Longford Hall under siege. Upon Cromwell's call for the garrison to surrender, Sir Bartholomew Pell, the Royalist commander, entered into negotiations with Cromwell, winning favourable terms, Pell surrendered to Colonel Hawson and Major Kelsy. Under the terms of surrender, the garrison was to surrender their arms ‚Äúwithout imbezeling‚Äù. Pell and his 14 officers were allowed to retain their horses, swords and pistols. The garrison was to be escorted toward Oxford. On these terms were met, Pell and the remaining 14 officers would leave Longford Hall. Longford Hall was built in 1275 by Adam de Brompton and owned by the Earl of Shrewsbury. In April 1644 it was captured by Royalists and subsequently demolished. The present house was built on the site 1794-97 by Colonel Ralph Leeke and designed by Joseph Bonomi. Longford Hall is now the junior boarding house and sports fields of Adams' Grammar School. The area is situated on the Brockton Fault. Sandstone (Kidderminster Conglomerate) and slate are prevalent in the area and were once mined at Brockton, Stockton and Church Aston.

In 1630, at the age of 22, Van Salee arrived with his wife in New Netherlands, as a colonist of the Dutch West India Company. Van Salee's pirate father may have provided him a considerable fortune. By 1639 Anthony had become one of the largest landholders on the island, as well as a prosperous farmer.

Van Salee transferred the deed the following year. Following numerous legal disputes, including with representatives of the Dutch Reformed Church, whose council reprimanded Van Salee and his wife for not behaving as \\"pious Christians\\", he was ordered to leave New Netherlands. But, after he appealed to the Dutch West India Company, Van Salee was allowed to settle on in what would become New Utrecht and Gravesend, Brooklyn, at the southwestern end of Long Island. He became one of the largest and most prominent landholders on the island.

Description  The oil painting depicts a richly dressed woman playing a virginal in a home with a tiled floor, paintings on the wall and some of the locally manufactured Delftware blue and white tiles of a type that appear in other Vermeer works. The identities of the paintings on the wall are not certain, according to the National Gallery, but the landscape on the left may be by either Jan Wijnants or Allart van Everdingen. The second painting, showing Cupid holding a card, is attributed to Caesar van Everdingen, Allart's brother. This motif originated in a contemporary emblem and may either represent the idea of faithfulness to a single lover or perhaps, reflecting the presence of the virginal, the traditional association of music and love. The painting has been dated on stylistic grounds and on the evidence of the costume. This work can be related to another Vermeer in the collection, Lady Seated at a Virginal, on a canvas of almost exactly the same size, with which it may form a pair. A recent study has shown that the canvas for the two paintings came from the same bolt. In addition, the ground applied to the canvas of each painting appears to be identical and also to be shared with the New York Young Woman Seated at the Virginals. The painting is depicted in David Hockney's 1977 oil painting Looking at Pictures on a Screen.

Oben founded Pentacle (The Virtual Business School) and serves as its executive director. Obeng has been described variously as \\"a leading revolutionary\\" and \\"an agent provocateur\\"Financial Times, Friday 12 July 1996 by the Financial Times, and by Abbey National as their \\"secret weapon\\".Development and Learning in Organizations: An International Journal, Volume 16, Number 1, 2002 , pp. 4‚Äì6(3)  Early life and education  Obeng was born in Ghana to the scientist Letitia Obeng. When his mother moved to Kenya, Obeng was sent to England, to complete his education, at Cranleigh School.https://www.reconnectafrica.com/5-minute-interview/library-of- article/library-article-home/careers/5-minute-interview/professor-eddie-obeng- entrepreneur-business-guru He progressed to University College London and the Cass Business School.  Career  Obeng's business career started as an engineer at Royal Dutch Shell before he became the youngest Executive Director of a European Business School when he moved to Ashridge Business School in 1987. In 1994, he established Pentacle (The Virtual Business School) to teach this philosophy and ensure that there was a \\"continuous link between learning and implementation\\".Finance and Management, July 2000  Educational research  Obeng's research interest began in the field of Project Management, where he developed the concept of 'New World Management', also referred to as 'World After Midnight', as a response to the rapidly accelerating pace of change. He is inspired by Eliyahu M. Goldratt. For example, Obeng's \\"bubble diagrams\\" are based on Goldratt's current reality tree, Obeng's \\"sticky steps planning\\" is an application of Goldratt's critical chain project management. =New World Management concept= Obeng's concept of the New World proposes that we have moved (as a world) from an age when we could learn faster than our local environment (the 'Old World'), to a new age where the local environment of individuals, organisations, and governments changes faster than we can learn (the 'New World'). He argues that, as a result of this shift, most of the concepts, best practices, and assumptions that we commonly used to plan, manage, lead, organise, and govern are obsolete and damaging to the lives of individuals, society, and organisations. Obeng describes this as smart failure for a fast changing worldhttp://www.ted.com/talks/eddie_obeng_smart_failure_for_a_fast_changing_world.html and is perhaps best summarised by Eric Hoffer's reflection that \\"In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists\\".Eric Hoffer, Reflections on the Human Condition [32], 1973 =Virtual education= Obeng pioneered the use of bespoke business simulation games to help stimulate and embed learning. In 1995, together with Keith Still, pioneer in crowd dynamics, he created the now obsolete virtual reality game 'Columbus'. Programming required high powered SGI Indigo computers, although the simulation ran at 25 fps on a standard PC running Windows 95. In 2010, he launched 'The Cube' (later rebranded to QUBE). Obeng's innovation with QUBE was to focus on learning and application by integrating all the business models, frameworks, and tools into the virtual reality enabled environment. = Teaching approach = Obeng is notable for demystifying traditional business school teaching by removing unnecessary theory and focusing on practical tools that can be applied in the real world in \\"a continuous link between learning and implementation\\".Finance and Management, July 2000 It uses teaching techniques that ensure that skills are learned and can be applied immediately.Roger Trapp, Financial Director 2 June 2004 The approach has been published in the Gower Handbook of Management. Obeng's teaching approach is divided into five stages that are based around David A. Kolb's experiential learning styles. * Engage, to build trust with the client and understand their needs * Diagnose, to establish the key ‚Äòlevers‚Äô the management team need to seize to make an opportunity work and/or to find the root cause/ barriers to turn-around. * Design, to work out how to re-align the management team's active or perhaps frenetic daily-life to ‚Äòinsert‚Äô the learning required to transform it. * Implement, to deliver the learning and support its application around both hard (process) and soft (people) issues. * Embed, to remove the barriers to the new learning taking hold. = Learning content = Obeng's learning material is divided into five subject areas that are intended to reflect the broad challenges experienced by managers and executives in the New World: How do I invent the future? How do I deliver the future? How do I deliver today? How do I lead organised talent? How do I ensure results? * Inventing the Future; uses proprietary tools such as the SPARQS model and the RABBIT process help to develop new ideas and ensure that they are turned into successful innovation. * Delivering the Future; makes use of the four project typesProject Supply Chain Management: From Agile to Lean Bj√∏rn Egil Asbj√∏rnslett 4 July 2003 Page 3 of 9 developed by Pentacle to better manage complex projects. These are \\"Painting by Numbers, a \\"Quest\\", a \\"Film\\" and a \\"Foggy Project\\" each requiring a different management approach in order to ensure success. * Delivering Today; uses a number of tools such as the \\"Money Making Machine\\" to help to prioritise activity. * Leading Organised Talent; uses the principles of behavioural leadership to support managers to create and manage effective teams. * Ensuring Results makes use of assessed learning styles to make sure that implemented actions are sustained.  Awards and recognitions  In 2011, Obeng won the Sir Monty Finniston Award for lifetime achievement by The Association for Project Management for his contributions to the study and practice of Project Management.http://www.apm.org.uk/ Publications Obeng is author of the following books: * All Change!

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 22 Mar. 2015 Van Dalem introduced into landscape painting new themes, which he derived from his humanistic education, and searched for new ways of representing his themes.Tanja Michalsky, Projektion und Imagination: Die niederl√§ndische Landschaft der Fr√ºhen Neuzeit im Diskurs von Geographie und Malerei, Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 20 July 2011, p. 249‚Äì250 Life Details about his life are scarce. He was likely born in Antwerp. His father was a nobleman originally from Tholen who had moved to Antwerp where he was operating as a cloth merchant. His father was active in the local Chamber of rhetoric 'De Olyftack' in Antwerp and was the chamber's dean in 1552‚Äì3. The van Dalem family was a cultured family. Cornelis and his older brother Lodewijk likely enjoyed a humanistic education and were both trained as painters with the obscure artist Jan Adriaensens. Cornelis commenced his training in 1543 and became a master in the Guild of Saint Luke in 1556. The same year married Beatrix van Liedekercke, a member of a wealthy family. Landscape with nomads with Jan van Wechelen Despite being a member of the Guild of Saint Luke, Cornelis van Dalem only practiced painting as an amateur and he remained a merchant his entire career. He was independently wealthy and did not need to rely on his art to make a living. However, he regarded art as an important part of his life as is demonstrated by the way he decorated the facade of his Antwerp residence. Cornelis had the fa√ßade of his house decorated with a splendour not seen in Northern Europe. The fa√ßade had a relief of the goddess Pictura in front of an easel, of Minerva and Mercury as well the stone busts of Durer and Jan van Eyck with laudatory inscriptions. Bartholom√§us Spranger was a registered pupil of van Dalem from 1560 to 1564. Van Dalem appears not to have been concerned much about teaching Spranger the art of painting but more about ensuring that his apprentice kept his studio clean and tidy. At the end of his four years of apprenticeship, Spranger is said to have been frustrated about his lack of progress. Around this time there were also increasing rumours about the possible heretical leanings of the van Dalem household: it was said they never went to the Catholic Church but rather attended Protestant gatherings.Sally Metzler, 'Bartholomeus Spranger: Splendor and Eroticism in Imperial Prague', Metropolitan Museum of Art, 3 November 2014, p. 19‚Äì20 These rumours appear to have forced the van Dalems to leave Antwerp and settle on a castle near Breda. Accusations of heresy were said to have been reiterated against Cornelis in 1571 and he may have given refuge to a radical sect of Anabaptists.Beeldenstorm 2: Close-ups van kunst uit Nederlandse musea, Volume 2 Henk van Os Amsterdam University Press, 1998, p. 145‚Äì148 He died in Breda in 1573.Cornelis van Dalem at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Work=General Only a few works by Cornelis van Dalem are known. The majority of these are landscapes. His oeuvre also includes a few genres scenes and possibly an architectural painting of a church interior.interior with Christ preaching to a crowd, at the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam He is considered one of the possible candidates for the authorship of the series of landscape drawings attributed to the Master of the Small Landscapes.Larry Silver, Peasant Scenes and Landscapes: The Rise of Pictorial Genres in the Antwerp Art Market, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012, p. 47 The importance of van Dalem lies in the fact that he introduced into landscape painting new themes (such as the origin of civilization), which he derived from his humanistic education, and his innovative way of representing his themes. Van Dalem is known to have collaborated regularly with his fellow artists who painted the staffage in his landscapes or architectural paintings. His most regular collaborator was Jan van Wechelen with whom at least three collaborations are suspected. He further worked with Gillis Mostaert (who may have painted the staffage in the Landscape with Farmhouse, Alte Pinakothek).Landscape with Farmhouse at the Netherlands Institute for Art History as well as with Joachim Beuckelaer. 'Rock paintings' The dawn of civilization The early 17th century artist biographer Karel van Mander called van Dalem an excellent painter of rocks ('fraye schilder van rotsen').Hans van Wechlen, Peasants merrymaking at a village kermesse at Sotheby's And indeed several of his landscape paintings feature extensive rock parties with grottos. Examples are the Landscape with Adam and Eve of 1564 (Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts) and the Landscape with herders of c. 1560 (Prado Museum). Van Dalem's rock landscapes often include a grotto where some human activity is going on. These works had an influence on Joos de Momper who was an important adept of the genre and created about 70 paintings of this motif.Jan Brueghel de Elder, Mountain landscape with pilgrims in a grotto chapel at the Liechtenstein Collection One of the most ambitious grotto scenes painted by van Dalem was the composition referred to as The dawn of civilization (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen). In this complex composition van Dalem attempts to depict the origin of human civilization, a very challenging topic for a painting. Only one artist is known to have attempted this subject matter before: the Italian Piero di Cosimo who painted a number of paintings of the state of mankind just before the onset of civilization one of which is in the Ashmolean Museum. Di Cosimo's works deal with the history of early man and derive their visual inspiration from passages in Book 5 of De rerum natura by Lucretius (98-c.55BC), in which the role of fire is emphasized in the origins of life on earth and the birth of community life. Di Cosimo stresses the devastating effects of uncontrolled fire in his composition.Piero di Cosimo (1461‚Äì1522), The Forest Fire at the Ashmolean Museum Rocky landscape with nomads Van Dalem's composition, which was probably made in 1565, is dominated by a high, steep cliff which only leaves a small strip of heaven at the top of the painting. A large round hole in the rock allows a view onto a wide landscape in the distance. The top of the rock is covered with trees and shrubs that are painted very precisely and a flute-playing shepherd descends the cliff amidst his herd of goats. Below the cliff is a cave covered with reeds and people clad in rough clothes. It has been surmised that van Dalem intended to depict primitive man in his natural environment, as described in the De rerum natura. He shows in his composition several elements that were deemed at the time to play a role in the civilization process such as communication, fixed housing, domestication of animals and culture (music). The old man in the middle of the painting steps out of a sort of primitive gate, which symbolizes the border between nature and civilization. The painting of van Dalem which is represented in the famous gallery painting of The Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest by Willem van Haecht also treats a similar subject. Van Dalem's picture is the one just below the chandelier and is referred to as Rocky landscape with nomads. This composition appears to depict a further stage of development in the evolution of man when people have founded communities and wear woven clothes. A painting with a similar subject matter depicting the Flight into Eypt was formerly in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin but was lost during World War II. Nature v culture Landscape with Farmhouse The paintings dealing with the subject of the development of civilization find their counterpart in the composition Landscape with Farmhouse (1564, Alte Pinakothek). Here van Dalem seems to address the topic of the decay of culture, which is represented in the form of a ruined church, dilapidated hut and barren trees and earth. The composition's theme of the eternal conflict of man and nature further refers to the idea of the lost paradise and the futility of the efforts of mankind to return to that lost age in which man and nature where one. An alternative reading of the meaning of picture is that it refers to the decay of the Catholic Church particularly because van Dalem put his signature in the ruins of the church.Koenraad Jonckheere, Antwerp Art after Iconoclasm: Experiments in Decorum, 1566‚Äì1585, Mercatorfonds, 19 February 2013, p. 229 The baker of Eeklo An interesting foray into genre painting is the composition The Legend of the Baker of Eeklo which he painted in collaboration with Jan van Wechelen. The original of the painting is lost but a presumed copy of the original is part of the collection of the Rijksmuseum and is on loan to the Muiderslot. There also exist many versions said to have been made by the circle of Cornelis van Dalem and Jan van Wechelen or after Cornelis van Dalem and Jan van Wechelen. The composition was also engraved by Frederik Bouttats the Younger. The Legend of the Baker of Eeklo The painting depicts a legend told about the citizens of Eeklo in Flanders. When they were unhappy with the look of their heads, they would go to the village bakery. There the baker and his assistants would lop off their heads and place cabbages on their necks to stem the bleeding. The improved heads would then be kneaded and rolled, rubbed with a new finish, baked in the oven and ultimately replaced. The composition recounts the whole process. However, there was always the risk that a new head would fail to bake, or over-bake, thus resulting in a deformed or deficient head. At the back of the bakery we can see a woman holding a severed head who is having a discussion with the baker dressed in red. She is probably trying to return the head of her husband with which she is not happy. This story had a moral and cautionary message for those who were dissatisfied with their appearance and wanted to do something drastic about it.Circle of Cornelis van Dalem (Antwerp c. 1530‚Äì1573 Breda) and Jan van Wechelen (active Antwerp c. 1530‚Äì1550), The Legend of the Baker of Eeklo at Christie'sAfter Cornelis van Dalem (Antwerp c. 1530‚Äì1573 Breda) and Jan van Wechelen (active Antwerp c. 1530‚Äì1550), The Legend of the Baker of Eeklo at Bonhams Publishing Cornelis van Damen was also involved in publishing activities. In 1561 he was responsible for the publication of Frans Huys' two-sheet engraving of the entire Strait of Messina seen in bird's-eye view after a design by Pieter Brueghel the Elder. There is still uncertainty as to the actual level of involvement of van Dalen in the publication of this engraving. It has been suggested that possibly van Dalem was only the backer and initiator in whose name the publishing privilege was issued and that the actual publishing was undertaken by an established publisher such as for instance Hieronymus Cock.Nadine Orenstein, Pieter Bruegel the Elder: Drawings and Prints, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1 Jan 2001, p. 206 Reception Cornelis van Dalem's paintings were highly esteemed by the next generation of artists: Peter Paul Rubens's estate included one of his works, and a representation of one of his paintings is featured in the famous gallery painting of The Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest by Willem van Haecht. The prominent 17th century Antwerp art collector Pieter Stevens is said to have owned one of his paintings. Van Dalem's name was forgotten in later ages and it was only in the early 20th century that art historians such as Ludwig Burchard rediscovered the artist and his work.

Stewart founded the ensemble in San Francisco in 1989 with Baroque harpsichordist Susan Harvey. Harvey resigned in 2000, and the group has remained under the sole musical direction of Stewart since then. The group derives its name from the first word of the Latin translation of the Canticle of Mary in the Gospel of Luke (), Magnificat anima mea, \\"My soul magnifies the Lord\\", which is sung during the Roman Catholic evening prayer or vespers service. The ensemble's repertoire covers the sweep of religious, stage, and chamber music of the 17th Century by such giants as Claudio Monteverdi, Giacomo Carissimi, Alessandro Stradella, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Heinrich Sch√ºtz, Dieterich Buxtehude, Henry Purcell, and lesser-known and infrequently performed composers of the era. Magnificat has particularly championed and performed music by women composers Francesca Caccini, Isabella Leonarda, Barbara Strozzi and Chiara Margarita Cozzolani and has hosted a conference on Women and Music in Seventeenth Century Italy. Magnificat's annual concerts, recordings, and participation in music festivals have won audience and critical acclaim, and engaged the collaboration of respected scholars and musicologists. In addition to their own concerts in the San Francisco Bay Area, Magnificat has been presented by The Berkeley Early Music Festival, The Seattle Early Music Guild, The Carmel Bach Festival, Music Before 1800, The Tropical Baroque Festival, and The Society for Seventeenth Century Music. They have recorded for the Koch International and Music Omnia labels. Since 1989 Magnificat has provided period instrument ensembles to San Francisco Bay Area choral groups desiring to bring historically-informed performance practice to their concerts through its affiliate, the Jubilate Orchestra, which has now collaborated in over 300 performances with a variety of groups. Repertoire Magnificat's repertoire includes the genres of sacred music motets, masses, vespers, cantatas and oratorios, as well as vocal chamber music, opera, pastorales and other works for the stage. It is particularly noted for its musical reconstruction of religious works in the liturgical context in which they were first performed. Religious works are performed with all the music a 17th-century audience would have heard in church including liturgical chants and prayers. Audiences are invited to join in singing congregational hymns and chorales that form part of the reconstruction. Outstanding among its reconstructions is the performance of all the music performed at the rededication of the chapel of St. Gertrude in Hamburg in 1607. A premier musical establishment severely damaged by fire, its rededication drew the collaboration of major composers of North Germany. Following the composer's suggestion Magnificat performed Heinrich Sch√ºtz‚Äô Musikalische Exequien as a paraphrase for the Kyrie and Gloria in a Lutheran mass for the Feast of the Purification at the Berkeley Early Music Festival in 1996 and again in their own series in 2009. Magnificat's signature work is Monteverdi's great Vespro della Beata Vergine 1610 (Vespers of the Blessed Virgin of 1610) written to win the prestigious musical directorship of St. Mark's in Venice and which Magnificat performed in 1994 and 1999. It was again performed in 2010 to mark the work's 400th anniversary. Magnificat has performed the first opera buffa featuring a basso buffo in the title role, Stradella's Il Trespolo tutore, and will perform the first opera written by a woman, Francesca Caccini's La Liberazione di Ruggiero in October 2009. It has also staged performances of Charpentier's rarely performed music for Jean- Baptiste Moli√®re's comedy Le Malade Imaginaire. Notable among its opera productions have been its performances with the Carter Family Marionettes of the puppet opera La Grandm√®re amoureuse by Fuzelier and Dorneval from the ParisianTh√©√¢tre de la foire \\"theaters of the fair\\" tradition and Jacopo Melani‚Äôs Il Girello. The October 2009 presentations of Caccini's La Liberazione di Ruggiero will be performed with the Carters according to the Sicilian puppet tradition. Esthetic Emerging from the early music revival Magnificat was originally conceived as a collective of equal parts - a \\"chamber music\\" esthetic grounded in the talent and individual inspiration of Magnificat's musicians that is reflected in its interpretations and recognized by its audiences. Over the years, Magnificat has been guided by the spirit of the period in its emphasis on dramatic narrative and sensitive emotional expression. The ensemble has given numerous contemporary premieres of music not heard for the last 200 ‚Äì 300 years. Because much music of the 17th century still remains unavailable, performing editions have been prepared from original manuscript sources by Stewart and musicologists on Magnificat's Artistic Advisory Board. Organization Magnificat is a California 501(c)(3) non-profit organization governed by a Board of Directors whose current president is Nicholas Elsishans. Stewart serves as its Musical Director and Dominque Pelletey as its Managing Director. Nina Korniyenko serves as Creative Director and Boby Borisov as Audio Engineer. The group's agent is Robert Friedman Presents. An Advisory Board of scholars and musicologists contribute advice, performing editions, and scholarly essays for programs, websites, and CD notes which are posted on Magnificat's website. Advisory Board members are Alan Curtis of the ensemble Il Complesso Barocco; Robert Kendrick, University of Chicago; Jeffrey Kurtzman, Washington University (St. Louis); John Powell, University of Tulsa; Elanor Selfridge-Field, Stanford University, and Kate van Orden, University of California, Berkeley.

George was born into the family of Bagrat I, the duke (and ex-king) of Imereti, and his wife, of the Jaqeli family of Samtskhe. He succeeded as king of Imereti on the death of his elder brother, Alexander I, who had proclaimed himself king in opposition to King Bagrat V of Georgia during Timur's invasion of the country. Unlike his predecessor, George initially enjoyed more success in consolidating his power over Imereti; more fortresses were seized from Bagrat's loyalists and his prot√©g√©, Arsen, was installed as catholicos of the church in 1390. In 1392, he led his army to subdue Vameq I Dadiani, Duke of Mingrelia, but he suffered a crushing defeat and was killed on the battlefield. At Vameq's invitation, Bagrat V's son, George VII, occupied Imereti, reuniting it with the Kingdom of Georgia. George's brother, Constantine, and nephew, Demetrius, son of Alexander, fled to the North Caucasus, in the Balkar lands (Basiani of the Georgian sources).

It was painted in oil on canvas, typical of most Dutch artists of the time, and is 50.5 by 46 cm. It is now one of three pictures by Vermeer in The Frick Collection in New York Officer and Laughing Girl includes many of the characteristics of Vermeer's style. The main subject is a woman in a yellow dress, light is coming from the left-hand side of the painting from an open window, and there is a large map on the wall. Each of these elements occur in some of his other paintings, although this painting differs slightly with the man also sitting at the table. Art historians, who have suggested conflicting interpretations of the work, believe that a painting by Gerard van Honthorst inspired the composition and that Vermeer used a camera obscura to create the perspective in this painting. Subject and interpretation The main subject is the woman, and soft, direct light falls on her face. She resembles Vermeer's wife, Catharina Bolnes, who is believed to have posed for many of his paintings. With x-ray photographs, art historians can see that Vermeer had planned to paint the woman with a large white collar which would have hidden much of her yellow dress. Also, her cap was later extended to cover all of her hair, in order to draw attention to her face and expression. This yellow bodice with braiding has appeared in many of Vermeer's other portraits. It is called a schort and was usually worn as an everyday, common dress. The woman is also wearing a blue apron over her dress, but it is hidden in the shadows caused by the table. Blue aprons were common attire at that time because they hid stains well. Art historians have interpreted this to mean that the soldier surprised the girl with an impromptu visit during her morning chores. The woman is holding a wine glass, usually used for white wine. Because at that time, wine cost more than beer, it illustrates her wealth. The man in the painting is a cavalier wearing a red coat and an expensive hat, showing his wealth and rank. His hat is wide- brimmed and made of beaver pelt, which was weather resistant and good for snowy and rainy conditions. The pelts for these hats were imported from the New World. This hat was probably from New Netherlands, which was then under the Dutch West India Company's control. The red in his uniform is associated with power and passion, bringing a passionate and emotional mood to the painting. His rank as an officer is identified by the black sash he wears. However, his presence in the immediate foreground is what the viewers notice first. His striking presence adds drama and mystery to the mood of the composition. This artistic device‚Äîin which an object is placed in the foreground to increase the depth of field of the overall painting‚Äîis called repoussoir. Caravaggio often used this technique and Vermeer probably learned it from a Caravaggist's painting. The meaning of the interaction between the woman and the soldier is unknown. Many art historians believe that it only portrays a woman being innocently and honorably courted by this soldier. However, some have argued that her open hand and smile could be asking for payment before coitus.Gaskell, Ivan, and Michiel Jonker. 1998. Vermeer Studies. Washington: National Gallery of Art. pp. 315‚Äì319. . \\"The Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer of Delft (1632-1675) holds a position of great honor among map historians. Several of his painting illustrate maps hanging on walls or globes standing on tables or cabinets. Vermeer painted these cartographical documents with such detail that it is often possible to identify the actual maps. Evidently, Vermeer was particularly attached to a Willem Blaeu - Balthasar Florisz van Berckenrode map of Holland and West Friesland, as he represented it as a wall decoration in three of his paintings... Though no longer extant, the map's existence is known from archival sources and second edition published by Willem Blaeu in 1621, titled \\"Nova et Accurata Totius Hollandiae Westfriesiaeq. Topographia, Descriptore Balthazaro Florentio a Berke[n]rode Batavo\\". Vermeer must have had a copy at his disposal (or the earlier one published by Van Berckenrode). Around 1658 he showed it as a wall decoration in his painting \\"Officer and Laughing Girl\\", which depicts a soldier in a large hat sitting with his back to viewer, talking with a smiling girl who holds a glass in her hand. Bright sunlight bathes the girl and the large map on the wall. Vermeer's gift for realism is evidenced by the fact that the wall map, mounted on linen and wooden rods, is identifiable as Blaeu's 1621 map of Holland and West Friesland. He captures all of its characteristic design, decoration, and geographic content.\\"van der Krogt, Peter. 1998. \\"Vermeer's Blaeu Period.\\" Mercator's World. Volume 3 (5) September/October 1998. Page 82. Window The window and lighting is characteristic of Vermeer's interior paintings, most likely because it is modeled after the room he painted in. This window is extremely similar to the window in the Girl Reading a Letter and Open Window and the Milkmaid. The glass in the window has many variations of color, showing Vermeer's precision in the details of this painting. Only bright light comes in from the window and no outside scene can be observed, as Vermeer never allows the viewer to see the outside world. Camera obscura Some art historians believe that Vermeer used a device called a camera obscura to help him create the perspective in his painting. Instead of using a mathematical formula or a vanishing point, Vermeer probably used this mechanical device to show him what the relative size of the people should be. A camera obscura is similar to a camera as it projects an image seen through the aperture into a dark chamber. There is no historical evidence that Vermeer used such a device but the way he portrays perspective in many of his paintings, including Officer and Laughing Girl, suggests that he did.

On July 28, 2015 Gary Sorenson, 71, and Milowe Brost, 61, were sentenced in a Calgary courtroom to 12 years in prison for their elaborate, multimillion-dollar fraud.  Biography  Gary Sorenson was born in Calgary, Alberta in 1943. Prior to his arrest, he was believed to be residing in a mansion in Honduras just outside the capital of Tegucigalpa. The Alberta Securities Commission, the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province's securities laws, alerted the RCMP about the Ponzi scheme in 2007.  Allegations  Sorenson, and fellow Canadian Milowe Brost, are both accused of deceiving 3,000 people in Canada, the United States, and overseas out of $100 million, and possibly up to $400 million, between 1999 and 2008. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Sorenson and Brost created a business named Syndicated Gold Depository S.A. and then formed an agreement to lend money to Merendon Mining, promising a high rate of return. Investors were then enticed into offshore shell companies marketed by Brost's firms, Capital Alternatives Inc. and Institute for Financial Learning Group of Companies Inc. In the 1980s Sorenson was allegedly involved with persons carrying out illegal distribution of securities in Calgary, Alberta Canada and in importing illegal drugs from west Africa according to information contained in RCMP and Alberta Securities Commission files.  Arrest  Sorenson was arrested on September 29, 2009, at the Calgary International Airport in Calgary, Alberta. He was charged with fraud and theft over $5,000. Sorenson was brought before a justice of the peace and was released on bail of $150,000 cash or $300,000 surety, though he had to surrender his Canadian passport to authorities and was required to remain in Alberta to report weekly to the RCMP. If convicted, he could face a sentence of up to 14 years.  Conviction  In July 2015 Sorenson received a sentence of 12 years for his role in the scheme.

It is developed by BL-Logic, a development studio made up by fans of the Hearts of Iron series and active members of the modding community.Arsenal of Democracy: A Hearts of Iron Game, IGN. It was announced on September 8, 2009Arsenal of Democracy Announcement, Paradox Plaza. and released on February 23, 2010. As in other games in the grand strategy Hearts of Iron series, Arsenal of Democracy allows for the player take control of and manage nearly any World War II and early Cold War era nation-state including its political, diplomatic, espionage, economic, military, and technological aspects.  Gameplay  The player can build land divisions, aircraft wings, and naval ships/fleets, and combine these into corps and armies. The player also has the ability to control the appointment of commanders of forces under their nation's flag or that of controlled nations as well as to control the appointment of individual government ministers and military commanders in key General Staff positions. The player also has a broader ability to control the heads of state and government; however, this option is only available to democracies and only then through elections, in which the player chooses the winner. The player can stage coups, declare war, annex territories and make alliances. The player can also alter the social and economic policies of their nation using sliders, such as democratic versus authoritarian, free market versus central planning and so on. Moving the sliders will result in different bonuses and penalties, allowing for a range of choices and strategies. Technological research is controlled by the player. All this is on a global scale, with the player simultaneously dealing and interacting with nations across the world. The game can be paused at any point.  Changes from Hearts of Iron II - Armageddon  Arsenal of Democracy maintains the general look and feel of the original game, but features a number of changes and improvements over its Armageddon 1.2 starting point. The purpose and end result of these changes was to make the game less management intensive, more user friendly, and, through improving the AI, more challenging. The changes were focused around the game's economy, production, combat and historical accuracy. There was an overhaul of the graphics and user interfaces. This impacted many systems including espionage, trade, and notifications. There are increased screen resolutions and a freely selectable window mode. Numerous mechanics were adjusted. The production and economic now give user significantly more control and had the result of making the AI more competitive when compared to the original Hearts of Iron II: Armageddon. The combat mechanics, including attrition algorithms, were completely reworked to better reflect realistic unit behavior and losses.Arsenal of Democracy: Development Diary 2, IGN. The AI was modified to present more of a challenge to players and to adapt it to the new features in Arsenal of Democracy. These new features include a completely new supply system, logistics, national ideas (similar to the ones in the Europa Universalis series), an expanded technology system and four new battle scenarios. There were numerous smaller changes as well, and as with other Paradox Interactive games it is very modification friendly.  Development  Arsenal of Democracy was announced on September 8, 2009 on the Paradox forums. The game became possible due to Paradox Interactive licensing the Europa Engine to independent developers.Licensing Europa Engine, Paradox Plaza.

The technology is based on magnetic nanoparticles that are actuated by magnetic fields [1]. The aim is to expand the rapid diagnosis sector of the in vitro diagnostics market. A cartridge is inserted into a hand-held analyzer. The cartridge is constructed entirely from plastic components, has no moving parts or embedded electronics, and is disposable. It automatically fills itself from a single drop of blood or saliva. Once filled, no other fluid movement is required. The entire assay process within the cartridge is executed by controlled movement of the magnetic nanoparticles, using magnetic fields generated by the hand- held analyzer. The analyzer unit contains the electromagnets, an optical detection system, control electronics, software and the read-out display. Tests have shown that the cardiac marker Troponin I can be measured in blood plasma in around five minutes. Magnotech was used in the Minicare product of Philips Handheld Diagnostics, which was commercially launched in 2016. In 2018 the technology was spun out into Minicare BV (www.minicare.com).

From 1603 to 1613 he was a teacher at the University of Leiden. Life Baudius was born in a calvinistic family in the Southern Netherlands in Lille. His original name was probably Dominique Baudier, though sources only show his latinised name Dominicus Baudius. As a result of the arrival of the new regent of the low countries, the Duke of Alba in 1568, Baudius moved to Aachen along with his parents and sister. After finishing at the local school he proceeded to study theology first in Leiden from 1578 to 1579 and then in Geneva in 1581. In 1583 he returned to Leiden to study Law. In 1585 he graduated. During his time in Leiden he formed connections with Justus Lipsius and Janus Dousa. After his study, Baudius became part of an envoy to England, where he stayed from 1583 to 1585 and where he formed a friendship with the poet Philip Sidney, introduced by Daniel Rogers. Back in the Netherlands he lived in Middelburg, and for some time served as advocate for the court of Holland in The Hague. In 1591 he left for France, where he remained for ten years. He stayed amongst others in Caen and Tours, and maintained himself with various jobs and support from friends such as Jacques-Auguste de Thou. However, he frequently had financial difficulties, and in 1598 he spent some time in prison in Paris because of debt incurred from a love-affair. In 1602 Baudius was in London, after which he travelled to Leiden via Hamburg and The Hague, and he was appointed extraordinary professor of Rhetoric for the University of Leiden. He also taught law, and in 1611 he was appointed ordinary professor of history. In the same year he was appointed historian for the French States-General together with Johannes Meursius, with the assignment to write down the events of 1609-1611. This resulted in the Libri tres de Induciis belli Begici (Three books about the Truce in the dutch war). In Leiden he befriended amongst others Daniel Heinsius and Hugo Grotius. He must have had an attractive and cheerful personality as his classes were very popular. His private life was in bad order. He was troubled by his drinking habits and love-affairs, and he always had financial difficulties. His first wife, whom he probably had not married lawfully, died in 1609. After he had an illegitimate child with a prostitute, he was suspended from the senate of the university of leiden in March 1612. He died in 1613, at the age of 52, after several days of heavy drinking. Dominicus Baudius was buried in the Peters-church in Leiden. Works Baudius attained his greatest fame as a latin writer. He was erudite and had great control of Latin. He was one of the best letter-writers of his time and he is considered one of the best poets of the Iambic style in humanism. His letters were first published two years after his death. He published his first poetry collection in 1587. In 1591 a Jamborum liber followed after encouragement from Joseph Justus Scaliger and De Thou. In 1607 Baudius published a new version of his poems in Leiden (Poematum nova editio). Twenty-five years after Baudius' death, Petrus Scriverius published a small collection of Baudius' work under the title of Amores. Literature *P.L.M. Grootens, Dominicus Baudius.

Formerly transmitting on the frequency of 107.3 MHz from near Grand Rapids, Michigan as \\"WKLQ\\", it was a web-cast only station from May 28, 2009 through November 1, 2009. Due to low listenership in this presentation, Citadel Broadcasting decided to terminate the webcast and redirect all traffic to sister station WLAV's website. History In 1984, WJBL-FM 94.5 made a dramatic format change from religious programming to CHR as WKLQ. \\"Hit Rock KLQ\\" battled WGRD for Grand Rapids' teen audience during the late 1980s and occasionally beat WGRD in the ratings, but by the summer of 1989 the station had shifted into a more AOR direction. By the mid 1990s, the format became alternative rock and gradually became more active rock oriented towards the year 2000. The station played an active rock format, including classic rock- oriented songs as well as more contemporary releases. WKLQ created the very successful \\"Q Morning Zoo\\" in 1984, which at the time featured Robert J. Wright, Sarah Wilson, and Jim Owen. Owen left the Q Zoo in 1987 to concentrate on his duties off air at KLQ and was replaced by Grand Rapids radio legend Rick Beckett. When Wright left the station, he was replaced by Jay Allen. In 1989, Wilson left the station and was replaced by Darla Jaye. In 1993, Allen left the station to work at WOOD (AM) and he was replaced by Scott Winters. For three consecutive years beginning in 1992, the Q Zoo was the number one rated morning show in Grand Rapids according to Arbitron. On September 12, 1995, the entire Q Zoo resigned and less than two weeks later went on the air at rival station WGRD. In 1996, WKLQ started airing The Howard Stern Show. In 2002 Matt Hanlon, took over as station General Manager. Around Christmas 2002, the station quietly moved Stern to its lower-powered AM sister, WBBL. As a result, WKLQ did not have a morning show for months, until they hired Ron & Don Show from Seattle who stayed with the station until 2005. Move to 107.3 FM On October 11, 2004, WKLQ was moved from 94.5 FM to 107.3 FM in the Grand Rapids market, displacing sister station WODJ, which played oldies music. WTNR replaced WKLQ on 94.5 FM as a country music station. Shortly before KLQ's move to 107.3 FM, They hired Justice and Jim for mornings. In Summer 2005, the duo created a vast amount of controversy when they announced on the air that they were going to drown a dog. The announcement persuaded several listeners to call 911. A day later, they announced that it was only a stunt. On July 19, 2006, Justice and Jim were fired and replaced by The Opie and Anthony Show. In fall of 2007, WKLQ returned to its roots of playing the most new Rock in Grand Rapids. On July 17, 2008, WKLQ launched Grey & Kluck mornings featuring Grand Rapids market veteran, Michael Grey, and Warren Kluck. Grey serves as the Program Director of WKLQ. Kluck spent three years previously doing morning drive at WRKR-FM in Kalamazoo, MI. Repeater station WKOQ (92.5 FM) signed on the air on August 15, 2005. It transmitted from the same tower as television station WZZM in Newaygo County, near Grant. The simulcast was terminated on May 1, 2006. 92.5 FM subsequently became WLAW-FM, \\"The Outlaw,\\" airing a blend of country music and Southern Rock. Move to internet only broadcast On May 28, 2009, WKLQ was replaced on 107.3 FM by sister station WBBL-FM, which was previously on the AM dial, and WKLQ was made an exclusive web-station. The Grey and Kluck Morning show was pulled off the air. Warren Kluck went to do the Kevin Matthews Morning Show. Michael Grey went on to The Starting Line Up with Bret Bakita. This move left a current void in the West Michigan area for new active rock enthusiasts and left its competitor (97.9 WGRD) the main source for new rock in this area. However, competitor WBFX 101.3 FM, owned by Clear Channel Communications, reacted to the loss of WKLQ by adding more music from the 1990s and later to its rotation, tweaking from a pure classic rocker to a gold-based mainstream rock outlet. Shutdown As of October 31, 2009 wklq.com has been shut down leaving the former active rock radio station completely gone. Users trying to access the website are redirected to its sister station, WLAV at wlav.com. 96.9 FM WLAV is a classic rock station owned by Citadel Broadcasting, the owners of former WKLQ.

His first appearance was in David Morrell's novel First Blood. His character was expanded on in the film series where he was played by Richard Crenna. The character has been variously described as a father figure to the main character,Brian James Baer, \\"Fathers, Sons, and Brothers: Redeeming Patriarchal Authority in The Brigade\\", in Helena Goscilo and Yana Hashamova, eds., Cinepaternity: Fathers and Sons in Soviet and Post-Soviet Film (2010), p. 238. and as a symbol for the military or the American government and its relationship with soldiers. In the original novel of First Blood, Trautman serves as an allegory for \\"Uncle Sam\\", i.e., the United States Government which created Rambo to serve their military needs.Rebecca A. Umland, Outlaw Heroes as Liminal Figures of Film and Television (2016). In both First Blood and Rambo Trautman primarily exists as a background figure engaging in arguments with other figures who are pursuing or using Rambo for their own purposes, while in Rambo III, Trautman becomes a more central figure in the physical action of the film. Casting Kirk Douglas was initially cast in the part, had been outfitted and shown up on the first day of shooting. Douglas had previously expressed displeasure with the scripted ending, and as filming commenced he decided more rewrites were required. Director Ted Kotcheff and producers Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna strongly disagreed and Douglas left the production. Richard Crenna was then contacted and arrived on set the next day. Marketing stills of Kirk Douglas in the uniform of Col. Trautman exist and are now part of the extras on the DVD of First Blood.Deborah Cartmell, A Companion to Literature, Film, and Adaptation (2012), p. 333-34.Laurent Bouzereau, Ultraviolent Movies: From Sam Peckinpah to Quentin Tarantino (2000), p. 157. Biography=First Blood (1982) Trautman is flown in from Fort Bragg to warn the Hope, Washington, sheriff's department of the extent of Rambo's fighting and survival capabilities once Rambo starts a one-man war against the brutal deputies.Frank McAdams, The American War Film: History and Hollywood (2005), p. 406.Harvey R. Greenberg, \\"Dangerous Recuperations: Red Dawn, Rambo, and the New Decaturism\\", Journal of Popular Film and Television Volume 15, Issue 2 (1987), p. 60-70. The officers do not take Trautman's warnings seriously, though Trautman is the only one who can effectively communicate with Rambo. One source notes that Trautman, when describing the situation to the local officials as \\"a war you can't win\\", was echoing warnings previously made against continuing involvement in the Vietnam War. The relationship between the characters differs between the novel and the film. In the novel, it is explained that Rambo had never met Trautman in person, and had only heard Trautman's voice as a constant presence over the loudspeakers of the camp where Rambo was trained. In the film, it is suggested that Trautman trained Rambo personally, and commanded him directly in Vietnam. At the end of the novel, with both Rambo and Teasle gravely wounded, Trautman shoots Rambo in the head, mercifully killing him. In the film, however, Trautman stops Rambo from killing Sheriff Teasle, listens to his traumatic war memories and persuades Rambo to surrender. An alternate ending shot for the film had Trautman preparing to shoot Rambo at the end but unable to go through with it. Rambo then grabs Trautman's hand to force him to shoot, effectively committing suicide. This ending was scrapped after it did poorly with test audiences. Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) After Rambo's rampage in First Blood, he was arrested and sentenced to hard labor in a prison quarry. Trautman is now a member of Delta Force and was part of the operation to rescue POWs in Vietnam. Trautman visits Rambo in prison and offers him an opportunity to get out by undertaking a mission. Trautman then uses his influence to have Rambo released from prison to join the mission in the Far East, so that Rambo can get a pardon. Trautman is initially more trusting in Marshall Murdock, the CIA bureaucrat overseeing the mission, than Rambo is, as Rambo catches Murdock in a lie about his service. When Rambo rescues a POW, Murdock realizes that his war profits may be in jeopardy and forces his people to abort the mission, allowing Rambo to be captured by the Vietnamese and their Soviet Russian allies. Trautman responds angrily, unable to help Rambo, but knowing that Rambo will survive and return for revenge. He argues with Murdock about the situation, warning him of Rambo's anger. After Rambo comes back to the base and gives Murdock an ultimatum to rescue the remaining POWs, Rambo shares a few words with Trautman before leaving, refusing Trautman's efforts to convince Rambo to return to the United States. Rambo III (1988) Trautman tracks John Rambo down to a Buddhist Monastery in the jungles of Thailand and tries to convince Rambo to join him on a mission in Afghanistan to supply Stinger missiles to the Afghan Mujahideen rebels, fighting the invading Soviet armies. Rambo refuses to join, because he wants to put his violent past behind him and start a new life, and Trautman understands. Trautman undertakes to deliver the shipment himself, but is captured by the Soviets in Afghanistan and Rambo decides to launch a one- man rescue mission into the Russian prison camp so he can get his only friend back home. Once again, Trautman's warnings about Rambo's brutality fall on deaf ears, and Trautman is saved by John. Trautman's role in Rambo III has been described as \\"a well-meaning, but naive extension of the broken and mismanaged American military system\\". Later films The character's fate after Rambo III was never explained in Rambo, but because Richard Crenna died before the film was made, it can be assumed that Trautman died between Rambo III and Rambo. Sylvester Stallone himself explained that the character died the same day Richard Crenna died. Even though Trautman was originally supposed to be replaced by James Brolin, Stallone felt it would be disrespectful to replace Crenna. In the fourth film, Trautman only appeared in flashbacks using archive footage from the previous films. The fourth film is dedicated to Crenna's memory. In the 2019 installment Rambo: Last Blood, the character appears in archival footage during the credits. Other media=Novelizations Trautman's relationship to Rambo in the book First Blood sharply contrasts that portrayed in the movie of the same name. In the book, Rambo barely remembers Trautman, and in fact, after hearing his voice, he strains to recall him. Trautman then identifies himself as \\"Director of the school that trained you\\" over the car radio. In the book, Rambo doesn't reply to him, and, in fact, says to himself, \\"The Bastard. Turning on your own kind [referencing Trautman's assistance to Teasle].\\" Their one significant interaction comes at the end of the book, when Trautman tells Teasle that he \\"took the top of his [Rambo's] head off with this shotgun.\\" The movie novelizations of Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rambo III were both also written by David Morrell, who insisted on ownership of the characters as part of the negotiations for the sale of the film rights to the first book, and was given more leeway than is typically provided to writers creating novelizations. He provided additional insight into Trautman and Rambo's complex friendship, revealing that Rambo confided his painful childhood memories from his abusive father to Trautman, and states that Trautman has become his real father. Television Sam Trautman was featured in the animated series, Rambo: The Force of Freedom, voiced by Alan Oppenheimer. Here, he is not only the commanding officer of Rambo, but also of his allies. He would call in Rambo and his allies to fight the criminal organization S.A.V.A.G.E. led by General Warhawk.David Perlmutter, The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows (2018), p. 489. Parody Crenna played Colonel Denton Walters, a parody of Trautman in the 1993 film Hot Shots! Part Deux, a parody of action movies, particularly the Rambo films. As in Rambo III, Crenna plays a mentor to the main character, and Crenna's character is captured and tortured by the enemy, requiring his rescue.Marshall Julius, Action!: The Action Movie A-Z (1996), p. 101. In the Russian TV series, Brigada, the character Sasha asks people who claim to have served in the military (as he had in Afghanistan), \\"who was your colonel?\\", in reference to Colonel Trautman.

It is unique among grimoires in that it was specifically designed to be used by a priest, and some of the instructions include saying a Mass. While its name is derived from the 13th century Grimoire of Honorius, its content is closer to later grimories like the Key of Solomon and Grimorium Verum. http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/grimhono.htm The first edition of the Grimoire is said to have appeared in 1629, and was likely forged near the end of the sixteenth century, roughly four hundred years after the death of its supposed author.

Early flights used a German-made Sachs engine, but the high exchange rate and long lead times for this engine convinced him to try other options. McCornack settled on a snowmobile engine produced by the Cuyuna Development Company as having the best potential. In 1979 he modified the engine with a crankcase extension, an additional main bearing, lowered the compression ratio using an additional head gasket and substituted a smaller Mikuni carburetor, amongst other modifications. The original snowmobile engine produced . Lowering the compression ratio not only de-rated the engine, but also made pull-starting easier and allowed it to run on lower-octane regular auto fuel. The resulting engine worked well, was de- rated to produce at 5,500 rpm and proved reliable in service. Citing liability concerns over producing a two-stroke engine for human-carrying aircraft applications, Cuyuna declined to produce the modified engine. Instead, Cuyuna decided that the resulting engine was different enough from the base snowmobile engine that they would supply assembled and test-run shortblocks as parts to McCornack's company, Pterodactyl Limited, who would then complete the engines and be the manufacturer, allowing Cuyuna to continue producing snowmobile engines. After two years of poor sales of snowmobiles, due to a dearth of snow and no lawsuits against Pterodactyl Limited regarding the engine, Cuyuna agreed to build the engines themselves. The 430 was also produced in a reduced bore version called the 340. The modification reduced its displacement to 339 cc and output to at 5500 rpm. The standard 430 has a bore of .

She was one of the first Burlesque performers in M√©xico. She was nicknamed \\"Mu√±equita China\\" (\\"Chinese Doll\\"). Biography She was sister of Margo Su, actress, businesswoman and owner of the famous Teatro Blanquita in Mexico City. She acted in some Mexican films like the La bandida (1948), Carta brava (1950), Mujeres de teatro (1951) and Especialista en se√±oras(1951). As a vedette and burlesque performer, she worked in numerous theaters and cabarets of the time. Her famous night show consisted of painting her body with silver paint and remaining immobile as a statue, and then dancing oriental dances.PorEsto Yucat√°n: Article about Su Muy Key and other Ex√≥ticas In 1949 it was rumored that she would be the star of a film titled Poor butterfly, which never was concretized. Possibly in this year Armando Herrera, the \\"photographer of the stars\\" and who had become famous for portraying Agust√≠n Lara and the young Tongolele, gave her an anthology portrait where she reveals her exquisite Chinese eroticism. At the beginning of 1951 she was portrayed naked by photographer Niuglo, a persistent contributor to Veja magazine. The caricaturist Segura added to a piquant photomontage that bordered on pornography.Bit√°cora Blog: Su Muy Key Her sister, Margo Su, followed her footsteps in the movies, participating in numerous films and telenovelas. Death Her name occupied in 1951 great titleholders, because she was involved in a tragedy that cost her life and that of her lover, the businessman Roberto Serna. This fact has been one of the great unresolved enigmas in the world of entertainment in Mexico. The journalist Carlos G√≥mez M., related in this way the tragedy: \\"Su Muy Key, Roberto Serna and Mrs. Mar√≠a L√≥pez de Su, her mother, arrived at the Hotel Pal, Roberto's home. Roberto invited Su Muy Key to his apartment. She accepted and asked her mother to wait for her down saying: I'm going up with Roberto, we have an issue to solve, wait for me here, I will not be late. The couple disappeared into the dark of the stairs. They were closely united in loving embrace. After a few minutes, three detonations disturbed the silence of the night and Su Muy Key's mother, hurried up the stairs. When she opened the apartment door, she found her daughter stretched out on the bed in agony in the middle of a puddle of blood. At her side, with the revolver still smoking in his right hand, Roberto Serna, lying on the bed and with a head wound. On a table in the room were some objects, including a letter in which Roberto ceded the entire ownership of the rights to the magazine Oiga to several people, including Su Muy Key.\\"'' Some people say that when they arrived at the Hotel, the couple found themselves in front of the businessman Felix Cervantes, who from a neighboring apartment had set out to observe the activities of the vedette. It is also said that between Serna, Su Muy Key and Cervantes a violent scene arose because the businessman seemed to go to fulfill his threats, that the tragedy happened after Cervantes and Serna, in the presence of Su Muy Key had put this one in the dilemma of deciding for either. Cervantes's absence in all investigations is based on the fact that, according to the same reports, the businessman returned to the neighboring apartment from where he had seen the arrival of the lovers and, realizing the magnitude of the tragedy, decided to remain hidden, to avoid complications. The photographer Karol was the penultimate that captured her mysterious Muy Key's face. He noticed her worried and she told him that she no longer wanted to be exploited by her lover Roberto Serna, publisher of the magazine Oiga.Bit√°cora Blog: Su Muy Key Cervantes married later with Margo, sister of Su Muy Key. Comments Her sister, actress and businesswoman Margo Su, made a dislike of her sister in her book Alta Frivolidad (1990): \\"Rosa's skin is white and soft; With the lights of the theater she looks pearly. She's tall and with long arms, when she dances them moves sweetly and with elegance, gives the sensation of being in the sea. Her hair is black, crow-winged color with bluish flashes. She is beautiful. Even her name is cute: Su Muy Key. Muy Key means \\"Rose\\", in Chinese. The worst happened to her: she was labeled as a \\"Ex√≥tica\\" despite the fact that she is the opposite: Her dance is refined, ethereal, nothing ties her to the cry of African jungle or the sensuality of the Pacific islands. Su Muy Key is the mystical, elegant, mysterious and deep dance. She replaced Tongolele in the cabaret Club Verde with everything and the spectacular advertisements in the press and the huge posters stuck in all the streets of the city and, of course, her name was preceded by the fashionable adjective: The Ex√≥tica Su Muy Key. As sometimes happens, Rosa is totally different in her daily life to the figure of the scenes. She is simple and sweet in her dealings, an untiring accountant of jokes, she hates fame because she can no longer go to the market to choose her ingredients (she is a splendid cook) or stop talking to the butcher or the vegetable vendor. She goes out into the street without a drop of makeup on her face and dressed in simplicity, which seems wrapped in furs and silks. Either way, people are stunned in her wake, like an apparition. She has a lot of \\"angel\\" and a great personality\\". In popular culture Along with other contemporary vedettes (known in M√©xico as \\"Ex√≥ticas\\") like Kalant√°n, and Tongolele, Su Muy Key was mentioned in the Mexican novel The Battles of the Desert by Jos√© Emilio Pacheco.Telesecundaria.gob: Las batallas del desierto by Jos√© Emilio Pacheco Filmography *La bandida (1948) *Carta brava (1949) *Especialista en se√±oras (1951) *Mujeres de teatro (1951) ReferencesBibliography * External links * * Bit√°cora Blog: Su Muy Key (in Spanish) Category:1951 deaths Category:20th-century Mexican actresses Category:Burlesque performers Category:Mexican film actresses Category:Mexican people of Chinese descent Category:Mexican female dancers Category:Mexican vedettes Category:1929 births Category:Golden Age of Mexican cinema Category:Murdered actresses Category:Actresses from Mexico City Category:Musicians from Mexico City Category:People murdered in Mexico Category:Mexican murder victims Category:Actresses of Chinese descent ","title":"Su Muy Key"},{"id":"24521409","text":"Kyiv National Linguistic University () is a public university located in Kyiv, Ukraine.

Kitashima was born Tsuyako May Kataoka in 1918 in Hayward, California, to Masajiro Kataoka and Yumi Ishimaru, who had emigrated from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan and owned a strawberry farm in Eden Township, Alameda County, California. She had five siblings. At school, her classmates were unable to pronounce her name, calling her \\"Socko\\" instead; this in time was further shortened to \\"Sox\\". Kitashima's family moved from Eden to Centerville, Fresno County, California, where she graduated from Washington Union High School in 1936. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Kitashima and her family were among those 120,000 Japanese Americans interned into relocation camps. They were kept in horse stalls at Tanforan, California, and later moved to a single room at Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah. The Kataokas were also moved to Tule Lake while interned. In August 1945, Tsuyako married Tamotsu Kitashima in Salt Lake City, Utah. She later became a spokesperson for the National Coalition for Redress and Reparations, and fought for the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, by which the American government formally apologized and granted reparations to the wartime internees. In 1998, The Freedom Forum awarded her a Free Spirit Award, which came with US$10,000. She has also been recognized by the National Women's History Project as a National Women's History Month/Week honoree.

The factors that lead to a seizure are often complex and it may not be possible to determine what causes a particular seizure, what causes it to happen at a particular time, or how often seizures occur. Diet Malnutrition and overnutrition may increase the risk of seizures. Examples include the following: *Vitamin B1 deficiency (thiamine deficiency) was reported to cause seizures, especially in alcoholics.100 Questions & Answers About Epilepsy, Anuradha Singh, page 79 *Vitamin B6 depletion (pyridoxine deficiency) was reported to be associated with pyridoxine-dependent seizures. *Vitamin B12 deficiency was reported to be the cause of seizures for adults and for infants. Folic acid in large amounts was considered to potentially counteract the antiseizure effects of antiepileptic drugs and increase the seizure frequency in some children, although that concern is no longer held by epileptologists. Medical conditions Brain tumors are among many medical conditions in which seizures can be a symptom Those with various medical conditions may suffer seizures as one of their symptoms. These include: Other conditions have been associated with lower seizure thresholds and/or increased likelihood of seizure comorbidity (but not necessarily with seizure induction). Examples include depression, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism, among many others. Drugs=Adverse effect Seizures may occur as an adverse effect of certain drugs. These include: Use of certain recreational drugs may lead to seizures in some, especially when used in high doses or for extended periods. These include amphetamines (such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA (\\"ecstasy\\"), and mephedrone), cocaine, methylphenidate, psilocybin, psilocin, and GHB. If treated with the wrong kind of antiepileptic drugs (AED), seizures may increase, as most AEDs are developed to treat a particular type of seizure. Convulsant drugs (the functional opposites of anticonvulsants) will always induce seizures at sufficient doses. Examples of such agents ‚Äî some of which are used or have been used clinically and others of which are naturally occurring toxins ‚Äî include strychnine, bemegride, flumazenil, cyclothiazide, flurothyl, pentylenetetrazol, bicuculline, cicutoxin, and picrotoxin. Alcohol There are varying opinions on the likelihood of alcoholic beverages triggering a seizure. Consuming alcohol may temporarily reduce the likelihood of a seizure immediately following consumption. But, after the blood alcohol content has dropped, chances may increase. This may occur, even in non-epileptics. Heavy drinking in particular has been shown to possibly have some effect on seizures in epileptics. But studies have not found light drinking to increase the likelihood of having a seizure at all. EEGs taken of patients immediately following light alcohol consumption have not revealed any increase in seizure activity. Consuming alcohol with food is less likely to trigger a seizure than consuming it without. Consuming alcohol while using many anticonvulsants may reduce the likelihood of the medication working properly. In some cases, it may trigger a seizure. Depending on the medication, the effects vary. Drug withdrawal Some medicinal and recreational drugs can dose-dependently precipitate seizures in withdrawal, especially when withdrawing from high doses and/or chronic use. Examples include drugs that affect GABAergic and/or glutamatergic systems, such as alcohol (see alcohol withdrawal), benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and anesthetics, among others. Sudden withdrawal from anticonvulsants may lead to seizures. It is for this reason that if a patient's medication is changed, the patient will be weaned from the medication being discontinued following the start of a new medication. Missed anticonvulsants A missed dose or incorrectly timed dose of an anticonvulsant may be responsible for a breakthrough seizure, even if the person often missed doses in the past, and has not had a seizure as a result. Missed doses are one of the most common reasons for a breakthrough seizure. A single missed dose is capable of triggering a seizure in some patients. * Incorrect dosage amount: A patient may be receiving a sub-therapeutic level of the anticonvulsant. *Switching medicines: This may include withdrawal of anticonvulsant medication without replacement, replaced with a less effective medication, or changed too rapidly to another anticonvulsant. In some cases, switching from brand to a generic version of the same medicine may induce a breakthrough seizure. Fever In children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, a fever of or higher may lead to a febrile seizure. About 2-5% of all children will experience such a seizure during their childhood. In most cases, a febrile seizure will not indicate epilepsy. Approximately 40% of children who experience a febrile seizure will have another one. In those with epilepsy, fever can trigger a seizure. Additionally, in some, gastroenteritis, which causes vomiting and diarrhea, can lead to diminished absorption of anticonvulsants, thereby reducing protection against seizures. Vision Flashing light, such as that from a disco ball, can cause seizures in some people In some epileptics, flickering or flashing lights, such as strobe lights, can be responsible for the onset of a tonic clonic, absence, or myoclonic seizure. This condition is known as photosensitive epilepsy and, in some cases, the seizures can be triggered by activities that are harmless to others, such as watching television or playing video games, or by driving or riding during daylight along a road with spaced trees, thereby simulating the \\"flashing light\\" effect. Some people can suffer a seizure as a result of blinking one's own eyes. Contrary to popular belief, this form of epilepsy is relatively uncommon, accounting for just 3% of all cases. A routine part of the EEG test involves exposing the patient to flickering lights to attempt to induce a seizure, to determine if such lights may be triggering a seizure in the patient, and to be able to read the wavelengths when such a seizure occurs. In rare cases seizures may be triggered by not focusing. Head injury A severe head injury, such as one suffered in a motor vehicle accident, fall, assault, or sports injury, can result in one or more seizures that can occur immediately after the fact or up to a significant amount of time later.Overview of Head Injuries: Head Injuries Merck Manual Home Edition This could be hours, days, or even years following the injury. A brain injury can cause seizure(s) because of the unusual amount of energy that is discharged across of the brain when the injury occurs and thereafter. When there is damage to the temporal lobe of the brain, there is a disruption of the supply of oxygen. The risk of seizure(s) from a closed head injury is about 15%. In some cases, a patient who has suffered a head injury is given anticonvulsants, even if no seizures have occurred, as a precaution to prevent them in the future. Epilepsy Foundation Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can result in seizures. The cause is an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain, resulting in neuroglycopenia. When brain glucose levels are sufficiently low, seizures may result. Hypoglycemic seizures are usually a complication of treatment of diabetes mellitus with insulin or oral medications. Less commonly, it can be the result of excessive insulin produced by the body (hyperinsulinemia) or other causes. Menstrual cycle In catamenial epilepsy, seizures become more common during a specific period of the menstrual cycle. Sleep deprivation Sleep deprivation is the second most common trigger of seizures. In some cases, it has been responsible for the only seizure a person ever suffers. However, the reason for which sleep deprivation can trigger a seizure is unknown. One possible thought is that the amount of sleep one gets affects the amount of electrical activity in one's brain. Patients who are scheduled for an EEG test are asked to deprive themselves of some sleep the night before to be able to determine if sleep deprivation may be responsible for seizures. In some cases, patients with epilepsy are advised to sleep 6-7 consecutive hours as opposed to broken-up sleep (e.g., 6 hours at night and a 2-hour nap) and to avoid caffeine and sleeping pills in order to prevent seizures. Parasites and stings In some cases, certain parasites can cause seizures. The Schistosoma sp. flukes cause Schistosomiasis. Pork tapeworm and beef tapeworm cause seizures when the parasite creates cysts at the brain. Echinococcosis, malaria, toxoplasmosis, African trypanosomiasis, and many other parasitic diseases can cause seizures. Seizures have been associated with insect stings. Reports suggest that patients stung by red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) and Polistes wasps suffered seizures because of the venom. Stress Stress can induce seizures in people with epilepsy, and is a risk factor for developing epilepsy. Severity, duration, and time at which stress occurs during development all contribute to frequency and susceptibility to developing epilepsy. It is one of the most frequently self-reported triggers in patients with epilepsy. Stress exposure results in hormone release that mediates its effects in the brain. These hormones act on both excitatory and inhibitory neural synapses, resulting in hyper-excitability of neurons in the brain. The hippocampus is known to be a region that is highly sensitive to stress and prone to seizures. This is where mediators of stress interact with their target receptors to produce effects. 'Epileptic fits' as a result of stress are common in literature and frequently appear in Elizabethan texts, where they are referred to as the 'falling sickness'. Breakthrough seizure A breakthrough seizure is an epileptic seizure that occurs despite the use of anticonvulsants that have otherwise successfully prevented seizures in the patient. Breakthrough seizures may be more dangerous than non-breakthrough seizures because they are unexpected by the patient, who may have considered themselves free from seizures and, therefore, not take any precautions. Breakthrough seizures are more likely with a number of triggers. Often when a breakthrough seizure occurs in a person whose seizures have always been well controlled, there is a new underlying cause to the seizure. Breakthrough seizures vary. Studies have shown the rates of breakthrough seizures ranging from 11‚Äì37%. Treatment involves measuring the level of the anticonvulsant in the patient's system and may include increasing the dosage of the existing medication, adding another medication to the existing one, or altogether switching medications. A person with a breakthrough seizure may require hospitalization for observation. Other * Acute illness: Some illnesses caused by viruses or bacteria may lead to a seizure, especially when vomiting or diarrhea occur, as this may reduce the absorption of the anticonvulsant. * Malnutrition: May be the result of poor dietary habits, lack of access to proper nourishment, or fasting. In seizures that are controlled by diet in children, a child may break from the diet on their own. * Music (as in musicogenic epilepsy) References Seizures ","title":"Causes of seizures"},{"id":"24521602","text":"Mohammad Tamim Nuristani () is a businessman and politician from Nuristan Province of Afghanistan.http://www.nps.edu/programs/CCS/Docs/Executive%20Summaries/Nuristan%20Executive%20Summary.pdf Mohammad Tamim was the previous governor of Nuristan Province and replaced by Hafiz Abdul Qayyum.http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/KKEE-6DSPE7?OpenDocument Nuristani studied in Germany and later worked in the restaurant business in Brooklyn and California.

During the closing months of the Second World War, two small-town German women discover some money in an attic and decide to spend it on a trip to Vienna.BFI.org Plot Toni and Marga are two friends who live in a small German town in 1943, during World War II. Both women's husbands, like most men of the town, are away fighting in the war and Toni and Marga are bored, dreaming of an affair with a bearer of a Knight's Cross. Toni has a joyless affair with Fred Scheuermann, a Nazi Party official and one of the few men in town. Marga lives with her aunt and both women help Marga's aunt perform an illegal slaughter of a pig, an act which is punishable by the death penalty. When a young soldier comes home for a celebration of his recently achieved Knight's Cross, both women unsuccessfully flirt with him during the party. But then Toni discovers more than 15.000 Reichsmark which had been hidden by her husband and which was probably extorted from one of the Jewish residents of the town. Toni and Marga fear that the money will be worthless soon and both plan to go to Vienna, to buy some valuables with the money on the one hand and to see the city and meet attractive soldiers on the other hand. During the train ride, they meet Mariu Moltenau, a suave gentleman who claims to be a Romanian officer on a secret mission in Vienna and who offers both women to help them obtain the needed valuables. In Vienna, Toni meets Mariu in his apartment, gives him most of the money and is asked to return some days later to collect the valuables. Both women spend some days in Vienna sightseeing and unsuccessfully trying to meet decorated attractive soldiers. When Toni and Marga return to Mariu's apartment, no one opens the door. They return to his apartment several times, never getting in. One night both women finally meet soldiers, Hauptmann Sperlinger who is on home leave and must return to the battle lines the next day, and Major Kopp, who has a limp and is stationed in Vienna. Toni sleeps with Sperlinger and Marga has sex with Kopp. A short time later, Kopp helps Marga and Toni get revenge on Mariu: He, along with another soldier, accompanies both women to Mariu's apartment and forces entry. Once inside the apartment, the soldiers and the women carry away valuables approximately worth the money they had given to Mariu. This includes porcelain, rugs and clocks. Mariu watches resignedly, not offering much protest. Outside the house, Kopp tells the women that he has arranged passage for them to their home town with the valuables but that they will have to pay some intermediates to proceed along the way. During their journey, they have to exchange most of their valuables for the passage and for a small car that they travel with. When they arrive home, they hide the car immediately but are then informed that the illegal slaughter has been exposed, their aunt has been jailed and Marga will probably soon also be indicted. Toni asks her lover Fred to help them but he refuses and then tells her that Marga's aunt has been killed during an aerial bombing of her prison. Both women now hatch a plan to deflect the blame and implicate Fred: they secretly hide meat products in Fred's office and his garden. Then Toni arranges a tryst with Fred, Marga arrives, and both make it look as if Fred had raped Toni and Marga caught him in the act. When a party official is sent to investigate the accusations against Fred, he is skeptical of the much too neat evidence against Fred and wants to keep the scandal under wraps. So he makes Fred an offer: if Fred does not officially contest the charges, they will be silently dropped and he will be sent to the Eastern Front instead. After a short protest, Fred accepts and is sent to the front, where he is killed a short time later in battle. The time skips ahead one year, to 1944, where it is shown that Marga and Toni had a falling out and have a violent argument when Toni wants to take the hidden car for a ride. In her rage, Marga destroys the windshield and more of the car. The time skips ahead another year, to V-E Day.

Gurwin arrived in the U.S. with little in his pocket, built his fortune manufacturing specialized textiles for the United States armed forces, gave much of his money to charity and then lost significant sums that had been invested with Bernard Madoff. Early life Born Joseph Gurwich in Kovno, Lithuania on June 13, 1920, he immigrated to the United States in 1934 to avoid the prospect of being forced to repeat a grade after failing both Latin and Lithuanian language, having focused more on soccer than on his schoolwork. His family remained in Lithuania and both of his parents were killed in the Holocaust. His younger brother, Chaim, was the family's lone survivor, but he was caught behind the Iron Curtain after the end of World War II, and the two did not meet for 52 years until they were reunited in Tel Aviv in 1988.Martin, Douglas. \\"Joseph Gurwin, Textile Manufacturer and Philanthropist, Dies at 89\\", The New York Times, September 26, 2009. Accessed September 29, 2009. He served in the United States Army during World War II. Business and Philanthropy He spent four years in a room he rented for $14 a month at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan. By the time he moved out, he owned a car and was paying more than that to garage it. He dropped out of City College of New York after his uncle's military supply firm made him a partner in 1941. He created Kings Point Industries in 1959, and became wealthy through his firm, which manufactured ballistic vests, Gas mask hoods and parachute equipment. In the succeeding decades, Gurwin devoted much of his time to charitable efforts, giving personally and through charitable trusts, focusing on the causes related to the elderly, education, medical and scientific research. Substantial amounts were contributed to fund the Rosalind and Joseph Gurwin Jewish Geriatric Center of Long Island. He contributed to the Weizmann Institute of Science and Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology to fund research in Israel. A pair of satellites launched by the Israel Space Agency for Technion, Gurwin-1b in 1998 and Gurwin-2-TechSAT, were named for him after he provided the funds to pay for launching the devices into space. He was among the founders of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, located adjacent to the National Mall in Washington, D.C. He led the UJA-Federation of New York from 1988 to 1991 as its chairman. Gurwin had invested much of the funds of his charitable trusts with Bernie Madoff and lost an estimated $36 million in assets in these funds after the collapse of Madoff's investment fund. He continued making contributions from his own funds and stated that he was willing \\"to sell apples on the street\\" in order to continue his giving. At a meeting in Palm Beach in early 2009 of prominent community members who had lost much to Madoff, Gurwin made an impassioned appeal that \\"no matter what happened to us, we still have to support those who are less fortunate than ourselves\\".

By December 1108 he held the title of comes (count), the highest in the kingdom. He was a son of count Pelayo G√≥mez, grandson son of G√≥mez D√≠az de Carri√≥n and Teresa Pel√°ez. His mother was Elvira Mu√±oz, half-sister of count Rodrigo Mu√±oz, and daughter of Munio Rodr√≠guez and Ilduara Vel√°zquez.Barton, 268. Elvira's ancestors had founded the monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Ferreira. On 17 September 1111, Munio participated in the coronation of a young Alfonso VII in opposition to his mother, Urraca, at Santiago de Compostela. At the banquet following the coronation Munio acted as regalis offertorius, the official in charge of the food.Fletcher, 133‚Äì34. Between May 1112 and November 1116 Munio governed the Galician tenencia of Monterroso, a region south of Lugo, west of the river Mi√±o, and along the Way of Saint James.Reilly, 289‚Äì90. By the summer of 1114 he made peace with Queen Urraca, which keeps with the description of him provided by the Historia compostellana that he tried to steer a moderate course. He was still on Urraca's side in 1116. In the spring of 1120 Queen Urraca imprisoned Mu√±o, probably for defecting to her son, and deprived him of all his lands, but by the next year he was restored and was supporting the queen against the Galician archbishop Diego Gelm√≠rez. Munio was among those nobles forced in 1114 to swear an oath to \\"honour\\" Diego as part of the archbishop's reconciliation with the queen.Reilly, 99. Sometime in 1121 Munio built an \\"adulterine\\" (i.e., illegal) castle on the River Iso near Compostela. The Historia compostellana calls it a \\"den of robbers and bandits\\", and Diego managed to raze it to the ground soon after it was built.Barton, 213. Munio was soon interceding on Diego's behalf with his brother-in-law Vermudo P√©rez de Traba, whose castle at Faro Diego claimed.Barton, 214. Alfonso VII succeeded his mother in 1126. Throughout his reign, Munio stayed an essentially Galician figure. He did not once attend court between 1127 and 1134, though he did attend in 1135 and was probably present at the imperial coronation of Alfonso in May. He joined the court on its tours of Galicia in 1137 and 1141, and once more, probably shortly before his death, in 1142, when the court was in Burgos.Barton, 129 n45. It has been speculated that physical infirmity may have played a role in keeping Munio in Galicia. Munio was also a patron of the Galician church, making donations to Lugo Cathedral (1123), Santiago Cathedral and the regular clergy at Sar (1141). Though he is not mentioned in the Historia compostellana among those who paid homage to Alfonso VII upon his succession in 1126, it is known from documentary sources that he was in Zamora on 13 April when Alfonso was there to receive the homage of the Galician aristocracy.Barton, 128. Munio married Lupa P√©rez, daughter of Pedro Fr√≥ilaz de Traba and Urraca Fr√≥ilaz. They were married by 30 October 1130. In December 1147, possibly after Mu√±o's death, Lupa, calling herself Deo devota (devoted to God), made a donation to the Cistercian monks of Monfero Abbey on the condition that they would say a mass for her soul and her husband's annually on 30 September, the day after Michaelmas. She had previously patronised Monfero in July 1137 and would again in August 1150. In April that year she had purchased a piece of land at San Crist√≥bal de Dorme√°, where, on 1 October 1152, she founded a monastery. When the new monastery received a royal privilege from Ferdinand II on 8 November 1157, Lupa was still living. Her children by Munio were Aldonza, Elvira, Fernando, Pedro and Teresa.

He began his career at the court of the Emperor Alfonso VII, during whose reign he took part in the repoblaci√≥n of the Extremadura and the defence of the Almohad frontier. Between 1164 and 1169 he governed Castile as regent for the underage Alfonso VIII, and he continued to exercise semi-regal power in the kingdom until 1176. He founded two monasteries and fostered the cult of Thomas Becket in Spain. He died taking part in the Reconquista of Cuenca. Family Nu√±o was the third of four sons of Pedro Gonz√°lez de Lara and his wife Ava, probably from northern France.Barton, 269‚Äì70. This article relies heavily on these pages, which provide a comprehensive list of Nu√±o's issue, offices, tenencias, and religious endowments, as well as known private transactions. His elder brothers were √Ålvaro and Manrique and he had a younger brother named Rodrigo. Sometime before March 1154 Nu√±o married Teresa Fern√°ndez, an illegitimate daughter of Fernando P√©rez de Traba and Theresa, Countess of Portugal. Together they were the parents of √Ålvaro, Fernando, Gonzalo, Sancha (wife of Sancho, Count of Provence) and countess Elvira, perhaps wife of Ermengol VIII, Count of Urgell.S√°nchez de Mora, pp. 215-308. Barton, pp. 269‚Äì70 gives two additional daughters, Leonor and Teresa. Early public career In February 1141 Nu√±o entered public life, subscribing a charter of the monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza. In March 1145 he was appointed imperial alf√©rez, a post he held until February 1155, an unusually long term for an office that was typically held by younger noblemen early in their careers. In 1146 he held the tenencia of Aguilar de Campoo, his first recorded fief. He held an interest in some houses in the important city of Toledo, which he granted to Gonzalo de Mara√±√≥n in November 1148. There exists a charter dated 1 July 1152 which claims to be a fuero conceded by Nu√±o with the consent of the king to the city of Castro Benavente, now Castronu√±o, but it is probably a forgery. The attached list of witnesses indicates that it cannot pre-date 1156, although the re-settlement of the town had occurred as early as 1154. It had been directed by Nu√±o with the assistance of bishop Navarro of Salamanca and his archdeacon Cipriano.Barton, 189. The ecclesiastics took the lead in the construction of new churches and the provision of liturgical books and vestments, while Nu√±o oversaw the repopulation of the village.Fletcher, 171. Between February and December 1154 Nu√±o received the frontier tenencia of Montoro. As alf√©rez Nu√±o was used to spending his time at court and governing his fief in absentia, but when Montoro came under Almohad attack in the spring of 1156 he was called to defend it. He was unsuccessful. The fortress fell and he was probably captured.Reilly, 186. He was not ransomed and returned to court until January 1157. With the loss of Montoro he was transferred to the tenencia of Avia (perhaps Abia de las Torres), which he continued to govern until his death. In March 1156 Alfonso VII granted Nu√±o the vill of Alcab√≥n and in 1158 Nu√±o exchanged his lands at Castronu√±o with the Hospitallers for theirs at Torre de Herr√≠n. In 1158 Alfonso granted Nu√±o the tenencia of Villagarc√≠a, and in 1160 those of Cabez√≥n (until 1173), Covillas (briefly), and Herrera (until his death). In 1160 Nu√±o and his brothers fought a battle at Lobregal with the rival Castros, whom they had earlier that year exiled from the kingdom. They were defeated and Nu√±o was captured by Fernando Rodr√≠guez de Castro.Barton, 154. By March 1162 Nu√±o had been granted the title comes (count), probably by his brother Manrique, who was regent at the time for the young king, Alfonso VIII. That same year Nu√±o was made guardian (or tutor) of the king, a responsibility he received against in 1172 and 1173, and was rewarded with the tenencias of Due√±as (until 1175) and Moratinos. Ruins of the castle of Cuenca, where Nu√±o was killed Regency of Castile and later years When Manrique died in 1164, Nu√±o succeeded him as regent of Castile. In 1165 he began governing the tenencias of Carri√≥n (until 1176, or his death) and Villaf√°fila. In March 1168 Alfonso VIII put the town of Chill√≥n and its mercury mine under the joint control of Nu√±o and the Order of Calatrava. On 11 November 1169 Alfonso came of age, yet Nu√±o continued \\"dwelling on the affairs of the kingdom\\" (manente super negotia regni) as late as 31 October 1176. In 1170 the king gave Nu√±o charge of Villavaquer√≠n, transferring him to that of San Rom√°n (1171) and then Cuenca de Campos (1172‚Äì76) and Tamariz (1172). In 1173 Nu√±o was governing the tenencias of Amaya, Castrojeriz, Salda√±a, and Tariego. In May 1174 Nu√±o exchanged an estate belonging to a certain Don Sarrac√≠n with the monastery of Arlanza for the vill of Hu√©rmeces. That same year a certain Bernard secured his simoniacal election as Bishop of Osma by paying Nu√±o and Pedro de Arazuri 5,000 maraved√≠es.Barton, 193. In 1176 Nu√±o received some houses in Toledo that had once belonged to Sancha Raim√∫ndez from the archbishop, Cerebruno, for an annual rent of five maraved√≠es.The charter recording this transaction, found in a thirteenth-century cartulary copy, is published in Barton, 327. They also gave some houses they owned near the imperial palace to the archbishop.Barton, 81. In 1176 Nu√±o P√©rez de Lara was appointed governor of the tenencias of N√°jera, Ubierna, and Valeria. One year later, in July 1177, he was present at the siege of Cuenca. He was killed in action a few weeks later on the 3rd of August.Barton, 182. His widow fled to the Leonese court and there married King Ferdinand II. Religious patronage On 29 January 1160 Nu√±o and his wife founded the Cistercian convent of Santa Mar√≠a at Perales, with lands also in Zorita.The charter of foundation is published in Y√°√±ez Neira, 394‚Äì95. In 1169 Nu√±o, his brother √Ålvaro, and Gonzalo and Sancha Osorio renounced their rights over the monastery of Aguilar de Campoo, a daughter house of that of Retuerta, and established some Augustinians there. They provoked controversy by expelling the monks of Retuerta's other nearby daughter house at Herrera de Pisuerga and transferring its properties to Aguilar, engendering a dispute that was only resolved in 1173. Aguilar adopted the Praemonstratensian rule and rapidly became the most important Praemonstratensian monastery in the peninsula and patronised by the king.Barton, 198. Nu√±o was especially generous to the cathedrals of the realm, endowing those of Santa Mar√≠a de Le√≥n (1170), Santa Mar√≠a de Burgos (1174), and Santa Mar√≠a de Toledo. At the last they founded a chapel dedicated to Thomas Becket in 1174 and endowed it further in 1177 with the village of Alcab√≥n, some houses in Toledo, twenty cows, and one hundred sheep.Barton, 200. The charter of this endowment, an original, is published in Barton, 328. Nu√±o have specifically intended to promote the cult of Thomas in Spain. In 1172 he made a grant of half the village of Aceca to the Order of Calatrava. Sometime before 1174 Nu√±o and his wife founded a hospital beside the Cistercian monastery of Saint Nicholas in Itero del Castillo for travellers on the Way of Saint James crossing the Pisuerga by the bridge (puente de Itero) there.Barton, 199.

The first documentary record of Mart√≠n dates to 28 May 1065, when he participated in a donation to Le√≥n Cathedral. His brother Fernando, the royal alf√©rez, fell out with the king in 1077 and was banned from court. It fell to Mart√≠n to restore the family's fortunes. Mart√≠n married Sancha Fern√°ndez sometime before 13 November 1084, when the couple first appear beside each other in a document. Sancha was a daughter of Tegridia Guti√©rrez, daughter of Gutier Alfonso.

It is only then that his political career begins. At that time he was tenant of Aguilar, which he continued to govern on behalf of the crown until his death, although he is last cited there on 16 January 1108. Between 1 February 1091 and 7 February 1092 he received the tenancy of the castle of Simancas, which had previously been held by Pedro Alfonso. At the same time (February 1092) he appears as tenant in Cabez√≥n. Between April 1101 to June 1107 he was tenant in San Juli√°n, and there are brief notices of his tenancies elsewhere: Ce√≥n in June 1104, Pe√±ami√°n in May 1105 and Le√≥n in December 1106. Mart√≠n's known pious endowments are limited. He made a grant to the Benedictine monasteries of Sahag√∫n in March 1091, and also to the regular clergy of Valladolid in February 1092. He was not always on good terms with Sahag√∫n: in 1091 he had to defend the settlers of Villavicencio in their dispute with Sahag√∫n. At an unknown date when his son Rodrigo was young, he made a donation of a meadow, some money and candles to the Benedictine house of Santa Eugenia de Cordovilla, whose monks, he claimed, had exorcised a demon from his son. On 22 September 1102 Mart√≠n granted some land at Torredillos to the townsmen that they might build a church. According to Lucas de Tuy, writing his Chronicon mundi over a hundred years later, Mart√≠n was a victim of the Battle of Ucl√©s in May 1108. A charter of the monastery of Sahag√∫n dated 17 November 1108 cites Mart√≠n as still living, although it may contain an error in the dating clause. There is no other reference to Mart√≠n later than 31 March 1108. There is no reference to his eldest son, G√≥mez, after May 1107, and it is probable that he died in the same engagement as his father.Reilly, 354. G√≥mez is called Gomez martinci filius comitis (\\"G√≥mez Mart√≠nez, the count's son\\") and given the title potestas in contemporary charters. He was buried in Sahag√∫n.

Ahoy () () is a signal word used to call to a ship or boat, stemming from the Middle English cry, 'Hoy!'. The word had fallen into obsolescence before rising from obscurity as the sport of sailing rose in popularity. 'Ahoy' can also be used as a greeting, a warning, or a farewell. The word can be found with similar pronunciation and writing in several other languages. In Czech and Slovak also, ahoj is a common, colloquial greeting, while 'Hoi' is used in Modern Dutch and Swiss German, and ‚Äòoi‚Äô in Brazilian Portuguese, as an informal greeting equivalent to the English 'hi' or 'hey'. 'Oh√∏j' is used in Danish almost identically to the aforementioned usages. It stems from the sea-faring world, used as an interjection to catch the attention of other crew members, and as a general greeting. It can sometimes also be found on land spoken as a general greeting, again, especially in a maritime context. Alexander Graham Bell originally suggested 'ahoy' be adopted as the standard greeting when answering a telephone, before 'hello' (suggested by Thomas Edison) became common.  Early forms and development = \\"a, hoy, hoay\\"  Piers the Plowman, driving oxen, in a Psalter from the 14th century Ahoy is a combination of the call 'hoy' plus the sound 'a', presumably added to draw more attention to the cry. 'Hoy!' was a common call in England to drive cattle. The earliest known example is from William Langland, in whose 1393 epic poem, Piers the Ploughman, the word first appears in Middle English: 'And holpen to erie √æis half acre with 'hoy! troly! lolly!',OED s.v. hoy int. The epos has three known variants - A, B, and C. The form hoy is taken from variant C; in A it is written as hey, in B as how. The dating is taken from OED which roughly translates to \\"And helped to plow this half acre with 'hoy! troly! lolly!'\\".The connection with similar passages (\\"hey\\" instead of \\"hoy\\") in two songs from the early 16th century is unclear. See Ray Siemens: Revisiting the Text of the Henry VIII Manuscript (BL Add Ms 31,922): An Extended Note. In: Early Modern Literary Studies 14.3 (2009) 3.1‚Äì36. Seamen used the word \\"hoy\\" in the form of \\"hoay\\". The Scottish poet William Falconer, author of a nautical dictionary, wrote 1769: \\"If the master intends to give any order to the people in the main-top, he calls, Main-top, hoay! To which they answer, Holloa!\\",William Falconer: An universal dictionary of the Marine. London 1769, s. v. Holloa, cited according to OED s. v. hoy int. Two other dictionaries from 1805 list Falconers call as \\"hoay\\" and answer \\"holloa\\".J. J. Moore: The Midshipman‚Äôs Or British Mariner‚Äôs Vocabulary. London 1801 und Washington 1805, s.v. hoay. Charles James: A new and enlarged military dictionary. 2. Aufl. London 1805, s.v. hoay \\"Ahoy\\" does not appear. Functionally related with \\"hoy\\" is a group of similar sounding calls and greetings in the Germanic languages: Middle and Modern English \\"hey\\" and \\"hi\\", German, Dutch, Danish and Norwegian hei, in Sweden hej,OED s.v. hey, hi and the Dutch greeting hoi.Het Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal op Internet, s.v. hoi, verified on 19 November 2008 In Old Russian \\"goy\\" was a standard greeting which is still present in Russian folk fairy tales. In Czech and Slovak, 'Ahoj' () is a commonly used as an informal greeting, comparable to \\"Hello\\". It was borrowed from English and became popular among people engaged in water sports. It gained wide currency by the 1930s.  ahiu, √¢ hui  Two discoveries in Middle High German literature reveal interjections similar to ahoi. Their forms show no links to the middle English form hoy and their meanings offer little connection to the call used to establish contact. In around 1290 Heinrich von Freiberg used the form ahiu twice in his adaptation of Tristan as a greeting: \\"ahiu, Parmenois Tristan!\\", alongside \\"ahiu, wie sch√¥ne sie het sich √ªz gef√™getieret\\", English: \\"ahiu, how prettily she has dressed!\\". Ahiu has the same meaning as the interjections ahiv, ahiw and hiu, which occur in this text as well. As part of a group of words consisting of ah√Æ, ay and ahei, which express pain, desire and admiration, ahiu can be found before exclamative or optative sentences and in emphatic greetings. Between 1331 and 1341, in his work Kronike von Pruzinlant, Nikolaus von Jeroschin inserted the expression \\"√¢ hui! s√¥ w√™r ich h√¥chgem√ªt / s√¥ ich ir stirne s√™he bl√¥z\\". Ahui, together with aheia, ahi and ahu, belongs to a group of words that express incommensurable joy, esteem and similar positive attitudes.  Distribution and use =General information Seamen had been using ahoy long before the first recorded use in print in well-known seafaring songs or Shanties. There is a lack of research into handwritten letters and records from seamen. Therefore, printed works concerning the use of the \\"Ahoy\\"-word family have only restricted significance regarding the temporal and geographical distribution. \\"Ahoy\\" represents the original English form and its first maritime use was recorded in 1751 as a new word in nautical language. The first evidence for the German word \\"ahoi\\" is found in 1828. Ahoy is widely used in the Northern and Baltic Maritime World. It expresses semantically a change in distance or presupposes it. In most languages it can be used as an interjection, whilst in others it takes the form of a verb (e. g. English - \\"to ahoy\\", German - \\"ahoi sagen\\") or a Noun (e. g. Swedish - \\"ohoj\\", German - \\"das Ahoi\\") It is not known how the word spread in harbour towns or on ships with an international crew, especially as similar sounding interjections in a neighbouring language may have either interfered with or promoted the adoption. In spoken German, either the command or the addressee can come first, e.g. \\"'Pfeil, ahoi!\\" or\\"Ahoi, Pfeil\\"!\\" although in written German there is no comma between the two words. In other languages this is variable.  English First examples= The exclamation \\"Ho! the house a hoy!\\", pronounced by a seaman in Tobias Smollets The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751), is the first example of the expression ahoy in the English language. One early example of the expression can be found in William Falconer's Dictionary of the Marine (1780): \\"The usual expression is, Hoa, the ship ahoay!\\". In the first edition of this dictionary (1769) the expression was still in its previous form hoay. In the 1780s ahoy was already used on the stage in London to create a sea-faring atmosphere. In this way it reached a very wide audience. In the comedy The Walloons, brought to the stage in 1782 by the playwright Richard Cumberland, the expression was used to catch someone's attention: \\"Ahoy! you Bumboat, bring yourself this way\\". The work was published posthumously in 1813. In another early documented source, as well, ahoy was similarly used to catch someone's attention. The expression ahoy was probably first heard in public in 1789 in the lyrics of a Sea Shanty, a worksong sung by able seamen, when the English composer Charles Dibdin (1745-1814) performed his musical The Oddities in London. This work also contains the song Ben Backstay, about a boatswain. The song goes: \\"And none as he so merrily / Could pipe all hands ahoy\\". The lyrics were not published until 1826. Tobias Smollett c 1770.jpgTobias Smollett used the expression a hoy for the first time in 1751, not yet in a maritime context Richard Cumberland playwright.jpg Richard Cumberland used the present form ahoy in 1782 Charles Dibdin by Thomas Phillips.jpgCharles Dibdin inserted ahoy in a song of one of his musicals IMA-johnson2.jpgSamuel Johnson used the word ahoy in his writings in 1824 = Consolidation = In the 1799 edition of Samuel Johnson¬¥s dictionary the word \\"ahoy\\" (pronounced …ô¬¥h…îi) is still missing, but in the 1824 edition it was said \\"to be almost as important as holla\\", supported by a quotation from Cumberland in 1813. The first entry in this popular reference book can be seen as an acceptance of \\"ahoy\\" into the English language. In the first half of the 19th century the word already began to find its way into many neighbouring languages. A speculation from 1835 about the origin of the French word oyez, which means \\"h√∂rt!\\" in German, implies an early philological engagement with the word. It had already appeared in a metaphorical context before, when in the American trade town of Philadelphia a preacher started to build a church for sailors in 1819. According to his memoirs, sailors used to greet him with \\"Ship ahoi\\" and to ask where he was going. The preacher used to answer back: \\"To the New Jerusalem harbour\\". We sail under the admiral Jesus, a good captain. We need men: \\"As the sailors said right before they were taken on: \\"Now we come in and listen to your conditions\\" = The variant \\"ohoy\\" = The variant ohoy was used early on as a synonym for ahoy. In one anecdote, printed in 1791, it appears as the ironic greeting of a captain to his boatman who is dressed up like a Romney Marsh Sheep when he entered the stage: \\"Ohoa, the boatswain, the Romney, Ohoy!\\" The \\"boatswain answered \\"Holloa\\" and disappeared. The Scottish poet Thomas Campbell published a satirical poem in 1821, in which a rider shouted: \\"Murderer, stop, ohoy, oh\\". In 1836 the Scottish novelist Allan Cunningham wrote: \\"Ohoy, Johnnie Martin! Ohoy, Tom Dempster! be busy my \\"merry lads, and take me on board\\". The form \\"ohoy\\" has been adopted by several Nordic languages. Their dictionaries give the English ohoy as a single source word, usually before ahoy sometimes afterwards.  German, diffusion  Research = The term remained widely unknown to German readers until 1840s, since the translators of popular maritime literature of the time avoided it. 1843 saw the first German translation of the word √•-hoj to \\"hiaho\\" from a Swedish novel.Johann Gottfried Fl√ºgel: Vollst√§ndiges Englisch-Deutsches und Deutsch-Englisches W√∂rterbuch. Teil 1, 3. Aufl. Leipzig 1847, s. v. ahoy, s. v. hoay. Deutsch holla f√ºr ahoy hat noch Madame Bernard: German equivalents for english thoughts. London 1858, S. 4. The earliest documentation of the term in German language appears not in non-fictional maritime texts but the nautical prose. In the beginning, the circumstances point to uncertainties regarding the usage of the word. Since the late 1820s, the words ahoy and ahoi marked with the coda -i, a feature demonstrating Germanization of ahoy, can be found in the German translation of English novels and fictions. Around the same time, the term was used by authors in original German texts on rare occasions. Ahoi became an established term around 1950 as it was used in the works of widely-read authors from the 1940s onward.Dietmar Bartz: Ahoi! Ein Wort geht um die Welt. In: ders.: Tampen, P√ºtz und Wanten. Seemannssprache, Wiesbaden 2014, , S. 306 The term rarely appeared in dictionaries in the 19th century. It is not included in the \\"Urduden\\" dictionary published in 1880. The Grimm brothers‚Äô Dictionary of German (Deutsches W√∂rterbuch) did not recognize the word at the time; it did not appear in the first volume, published in 1852, with entries up to the keyword \\"allverein\\". The DWB's second edition published in 1998, documents the earliest uses of the term as occurring in 1846 and 1848.Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm: Deutsches W√∂rterbuch. 2. Aufl. Leipzig, Stuttgart 1983ff s. v. ahoi In addition, the original index cards for the dictionary, which are kept in the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences, do not contain any earlier entries. The standard work \\"Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch der deutschen Sprache\\" by Friedrich Kluge lists ahoi as a separate entry since the 1999 edition.Friedrich Kluge: Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch der deutschen Sprache. 23. Aufl. Berlin, New York 1999, , s. v. The automatic search for appropriate keywords in digitalized books on the internet and in offline- databanks does only lead to a few useful results. German light fiction was printed so badly in the first half of the 19th century that even today good recognition software still produces a great number of errors, so that records are not found. Research in original catalogues is still necessary for a systematic search.Dietmar Bartz: Ahoi! Ein Wort geht um die Welt. In: ders.: Tampen, P√ºtz und Wanten. Seemannssprache, Wiesbaden 2014, , S. 306 f. = Early evidence in translation = The word ahoy appeared for the first time in 1828 in German translations of James Fenimore Cooper's novels The earliest creditable use of the word ahoi dates back to 1828.Dietmar Bartz: Ahoi! Ein Wort geht um die Welt. In: ders.: Tampen, P√ºtz und Wanten. Seemannssprache, Wiesbaden 2014, , S. 307 In 1827 the American story-teller James Fenimore Cooper published his pirate story The Red Rover. The following year der rothe Freibeuter was released in Frankfurt am Main. The translator Karl Meurer did not translate all of the words. The command \\"All hands make sail, ahoy!\\" was translated as \\"Alle zu Hauf! Die Segel hi√üt!\\", but later on in the novel ahoy was translated as aho, which could have been a moment of inattention. However, Meurer translated the phrase \\"All hands to mischief, ahoy!\\", as a signalled approval of amusement on board and so became \\"Alle zu Hauf! zu Possen, ahoi!\\". Meurer also translated the phrase \\"Good humour, ahoy!\\" with \\"Bei den Possen gehalten, ahoi!\\" In 1830 Cooper used the word ahoy five times in a story whose title was the same as the name of the ship Water Witch (German \\"Wassernixe\\"). A translation by Gottfried Friedenberg was released in the same year and he chose ahoi four times. Friedenberg missed out the first occurrence of the word ahoy. It is possible that in 1830 the German word was relatively new. In later editions this mistake was corrected. Friedrich Knickerbocker, who published the second translation in 1831, overlooked or rewrote ahoy also incorrectly as \\"Hol√ºber!\\" The \\"Wer da\\", or \\"Who's there?\\", the phrase he introduced once was not new. In 1824 and 1827 the German editions of Cooper's story The Pilot were released, in which ahoi was translated with similar expressions, such as \\"Wer da!\\", \\"Wer da?\\", \\"heda\\" or \\"He! He!\\". Not until 1842 in der Lotse (English, the pilot) ahoy became the standard interjection due to Eduard Mauch's translation, however this contained four ahoys and one ahoi. In 1835 and 1836 the anonymous translator of the two-volume story Trelawney's Abentheuer in Ostindien, which was published by sailor and later author Edward John Trelawny in 1832, who kept ahoy as a loanword. In 1837 the novel Lykkens Yndling/Das Gl√ºckskind was released in Danish by the author Carl Bernhard, who had also translated it into German. Bernhard was the pseudonym of the Danish novelist Andreas Nikolai de Saint-Aubain. This is probably the earliest import from a Scandinavian language and gave us the phrase \\"Ahoi, en Sejler\\"\\" meaning \\"Ahoi, ein Segler!\\" (English - ahoy, sailor!).Carl Bernhard: Das Gl√ºckskind. Kopenhagen 1837, S. 459. = Early evidence in German source texts = The expression ahoy is documented in a German source text from 1829. In her short story Die Armenierin, the Saxon writer Charlotte Eleonore Wilhelmine von Gersdorff inserted this word several times in a specialist context, both as an invocation and to express encouragement. The author also worked as a translator from English. The Austrian writer Charles Sealsfield first used the word ahoy in its original form. Sealsfield, who was also known by his real name Carl Anton Postl, lived temporarily in New Orleans, where he had many contacts with sailors. In his novel Morton oder die gro√üe Tour, which was published for the first time in Z√ºrich in 1835, a big crowd of excited people in Piccadilly Circus in London is summoned with the exclamation \\"Gare! Gare! take care! Hallo ho! A hoy!\\". The same exclamation is still to be found in the following editions of 1844 and 1846. In the footnotes to a reprint, the word Gare was appropriately corrected to Care, but wrongly used in the text in all three editions. The English form is correctly given, in two words, which was very common at that time. In Sealsfield's novel Pflanzerleben (Z√ºrich, 1836), the word is used before uttering an order: \\"Ahoi! Ahoi! (...) H√∂rt ihr nicht? die Pferde dem Herrn Grafen abnehmen.\\", that is \\"Ahoi! Ahoi! (...) Don't you hear? Take the Count's horses.\\" An English translation of the book appeared in the United States in 1844, in which the word ahoi is kept in its German form. Also in his last novel, S√ºden und Norden (1843), Sealsfield again used the English spelling, in two words: \\"Sail a hoy ‚Äì an ennemys sail!\\" The translation in a footnote to that page reads: \\"Kapit√§n, ein fremdes (feindliches) Segel.\\" In one of Ernst Willkomm stories from 1838, Jan, one of the characters in the story shouts \\"Ship Ahoy\\" as loud as a thunder from the cliffs of Heligoland. This was misprinted as \\"ship ahni\\" by the German newspaper Zeitung f√ºr die elegante Welt (English: A Newspaper For the Elegant World), in which Willkomm's Lootsenerz√§hlungen (English: Pilot Stories) first appeared. The misspelling was corrected when the story was published in a book in 1842.With its meaning apparently unknown to the publisher, the word reappeared in the same German newspaper in a narrative called Johann Pol.An Image of life in the west indies by an anonymous author in 1838. The said narrative depicts sailors from all around the world chanting \\"Ahoi, oi\\" while loading the ship. The 1844 Politik an einer Wirthstafel by Friedrich Giehne uses the words 'Waitress, Ahoy' in an expression addressed towards a waitress by a character. The story was published in a book which included mostly reissues of materials printed between 1836 and 1843. However, there was no mention of when the said story was first published or whether or not it was actually a reprint. What is interesting is that the word \\"ahoy\\" was used on and off the ship. One such example of an off sea usage can be found in Smollet's novel The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle in 1751 in which commodore Trunnion utters \\" Ho, the house, Ahoy!\\". It is likely however, that Giehne might have borrowed the term from Smollet as he could have read an 1840 translation of Smollet's work by Georg Nikolaus B√§rmann from English to German.Dietmar Bartz: Ahoi! Ein Wort geht um die Welt. In: ders.: Tampen, P√ºtz und Wanten. Seemannssprache, Wiesbaden 2014, , S. 308 f. In 1844, The German author Heinrich Smidt used the term \\"Ahoy\\" in parts of a pre-print version of his novel titled Michael de Ruiter.Pictures of Holland's Marine which was published in 1846 in the Magazine for the Literature from Abroad of which he was the editor.Berlin 1846, zitiert nach Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm: Deutsches W√∂rterbuch. 2. Aufl. Leipzig, Stuttgart 1983ff s. v. ahoi, Zitat in der Schreibweise des W√∂rterbuchs The term was also used in another one of his narratives in 1844 titled Hexen-Bootsmann. There is no trace of \\"ahoy\\" in the recently digitized versions of Smidt's works originally published between 1837 and 1842, however, the term has a continuous presence in all of his works since 1844 until his last novel which was published in 1866. Therefore, it is likely that Smidt added the word to his vocabulary sometime in 1843.Dietmar Bartz: Ahoi! Ein Wort geht um die Welt. In: ders.: Tampen, P√ºtz und Wanten. Seemannssprache, Wiesbaden 2014, , S. 309 Heinrich Smidt by Adolf von Menzel.jpeg Since 1844, Ahoi often appears in writings by the German sailor and writer Heinrich Smidt Friedrich Gerst√§cker was one of the most successful and popular German authors of adventure novels in the 19th century. As was the case with Smidt who started using Ahoy in 1844, Gerst√§cker, who translated a lot from the English, also suddenly used the term in 1847. \\"Ahoi ‚Äì ho ‚Äì ahoi! meine braven Burschen\\" (English: \\"Ahoi ‚Äì ho ‚Äì ahoi! My well behaved fellows\\"), is what he writes in the Mississippi pictures. In 1848 the sentence: \\"Boot ahoi! schrie da pl√∂tzlich der gebundene Steuermann\\" (English: Ship ahoi! shouted the helmsman suddenly\\"), appeared in Gerst√§cker's novel Flusspiraten des Mississippi (English: The Mississippi River Pirates). Friedrich Gerst√§cker.jpgIn 1848, Friedrich Gerst√§cker popularized ahoi in his bestseller Die Flusspiraten des Mississippi (English:The Mississippi River Pirates)  The use of ahoi in German  Maritime context = For Wilhelm Heine, a world traveller, the cry was \\"common\\" in 1859.Wilhelm Heine: Die Expedition in die Seen von China, Japan und Ochotsk. 2. Band, Leipzig 1859, S. 76 But Heine was on a voyage with sailors from the United States, who were already using the common English form. For Germans in Livland on the Baltic Sea the use of ahoi was explained in a dictionary from 1864: \\" ahoi [...]. disyllabic, and with stress on the second syllable.\\"Wilhelm von Gutzeit: W√∂rterschatz der Deutschen Sprache Livlands, Band 1; Riga 1864, s. v. ahoi In the 19th century it was \\"all in all rather seldom\\" used in Germany.Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm: Deutsches W√∂rterbuch. 2.

In 1934 the song Wir lagen vor Madagaskar was composed with the first line of the chorus \\"Ahoi Kameraden\\". This can be seen as a sailors' song. The Pop song Sch√∂n ist die Liebe im Hafen with the final line of the chorus \\"Auch nicht mit F√ºrsten und Grafen / Tauschen wir Jungens, ahoi!\\" is based on a waltz, which was also composed in 1934.

The use is considered by professionals unseamenlike and you should completely avoid the cry (\\"ahoi!\\"). Its use is severely marked down on board and can destroy the whole level of newly formed, hard-earned trust.

After sailors, stevedores and inland fishermen adopted the expression from the coast, it was made popular by the Carnival societies. During the parades, the crews of the Ships of fools greet the people on the roadside with Ahoi!, and they return the same greeting. It was also traditionally used in the former territory of the Palatinate, in Mannheim as \\"Monnem ahoi\\" or \\"Mannem ahoi!\\" and in Ludwigshafen, but also in bordering areas like northern Baden Altlu√üheim, as well as in southern Thuringian Wasungen, as \\"Woesinge ahoi!\\". The Carnival society Milka, foundend in 1908 in Upper Swabian Ravensburg, shouts the greeting \\"Milka - ahoi!\\". During the Backfischfest of the fishermen's guild in Worms, the greeting \\"ahoi\\" is employed as well. Also newer Carnival groups, for example one northern German association, and a new group in Cologne, refer to this call. = Military = In the German and Austrian Marines, before World War I, the boats which approached a warship lain at anchor were called using the expression \\"Boot ahoi!\\", in order to find out who was on board. The answers from the warships depended on the most senior person on board: \\"Standarte!\\" was the reply if the boat was approaching with a royal on board; \\"Flagge!\\" with an Admiral; \\"Ja, ja!\\" with an Officer and \\"Nein, nein!\\" without any official. It worked in a similar way with \\"boat ahoy\\" in the U.S. Navy, where the procedure was established for the first time in 1893, and in the Royal Navy. In the German Navy the greeting \\"Ahoi\\" is no longer used. In its place the Northern German term \\"Moin\\" is used. Amongst the German warships between 1815 and 1945 only one motorboat of the Kriegsmarine was called Ahoi. It was adopted in 1940, so it probably already had that name, and it drove on the Kaiser-Wilhelm Canal. In June 1945 the former owner, J. Pieper & Co., took possession of it again. The catapult ship Bussard, on duty in 1942, was sold in 1947 as USA spoils of war to the Belgian shipping company Heygen in Ghent, and renamed Ahoy. From 1940 to 1943 the Ph√§nomen-Werke Gustav Hiller company manufactured 125cc motor scooters for the German Wehrmacht in Zittau, under the name Ph√§nomen Ahoi. \\"Nebel - ahoi!\\" is used by the ABC-Abwehrtruppe, a defence division of the Bundeswehr, and it belongs officially to the military tradition of the army. The expression originated among the Nebeltruppe, a Wehrmacht brigade group from 1935, whose job it was to create a chemical fog over a battlefield before destroying the target areas with mass fire. The expression originated in a moment of euphoria, after the fog successfully covered its target. = Candy = Ahoj is the name of a Sherbet brand developed in Stuttgart in 1925. Named after the term ahoi it has been advertised with the picture of a sailor and a flag since 1930. At this point there was a fashion for Sailor Suits for children.Timo Heimerdinger: Der Seemann. Ein Berufsstand und seine kulturelle Inszenierung (1844‚Äì2003). Diss. Kiel (2004), K√∂ln 2005, p. 270 ff. The begin of this fashion is given here as \\"since the beginning of the 1930s\\" (p. 270), the website mentions 1930 specifically manufacturer's website, accessed 18. November 2008 In the USA term is used for the popular cookie brand Chips Ahoy! produced by Nabisco, a pun on the term \\"ships ahoy!\\". = Cattle drive = In one particular case √Öhoi is used as an instruction to the cattle to slow down. It was found before World War I in the Ore Mountains and it was used in the same way as eha and oha, ooha(a). It is possible that this is a combination of two interjections, as in Middle English, though eha might come from the typical Ore Mountain form eh \\"ein, inne\\", as ee halten \\"an-, ein-, innehalten\\". The new standard dictionary for this language area lacks an entry for √•hoi, ahoi or oho. In a valley in the Slovenian Triglav area shepherds use the call Ohoi! to communicate over long distances, according to a report from 1838.  Dutch  Theories of Origin = If the origin of ahoi is rooted in Dutch, then hoy originates from hoie, which is the name of a sailorboat that today is known as a Hoie or Heude.Eelco Verwijs, Jacob Verdam: Middelnederlandsch woordenboek, Bd. 3 (1894); s. v. hoede 2, sowie WNT Band 6, 1912, s. v. heude This common type of boat was used to transport passengers and cargo along the coast of the North Sea and across the English Channel. In a letter from 1495 \\"an Hoye of Dorderyght\\" from the Dutch trading town Dordrecht is mentioned. Then, two years later the term \\"an hoye of Andwarpe\\" appears in documents belonging the English King Henry VII. In his travel accounts from 1624 John Smith, who tended to exaggerate, counts an enormous number of sails in the region between Vlissingen and the Sea of IJsselin: \\"Holland and Zeeland hath twenty thousand saile of Ships and Hoies.\\"OED s. v. hoy sb.1 However, there is a lack of direct evidence that links the origin of ahoi to the particle a and the noun hoie. In Dutch linguistics the call is thought to be an adaption from English. This is indicated by the amount of evidence found in English and the lack thereof in Dutch, as well as criticism of the idea that in the Early Modern Period a word could be formed from a simple expression for a ship. The relation of ahoi and hoi, which is a common form of address in Dutch, is unclear. Hoi, which had been proven to be an exclamation of joy as early as 1552, could also be a short form of ahoi or ahoi could be an extension of hoi. Most likely hoi belongs to a group of calls such as h√≥ and h√© and is not closely related to ahoi at all. = Sources = Aho(o)i, ahoy and ehoi are rather uncommon in Dutch and are not included in numerous specialist dictionaries. This could be due to the prevalence of the similar and shorter exclamation hoi. The sources for earlier uses of the term are lacking, because ahoi did not get its own lemma in the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal (WNT), even though this comprehensive dictionary includes interjections. In addition later editions of the WNT from recent decades lack this entry. The earliest entries of forms of ahoi in the WNT can be found around 1900. The author Tine van Berken wrote \\"A-hoi! A-hoi! riep Beer onvermoeid, de hand trechters gewijze aan de mond\\", which roughly translates as \\"A-hoi! A-hoi! called Beer relentlessly...\\", in a book for girls that was published in 1897. In 1908 author George Frans Haspels wrote \\"met donderend ahoei\\", \\"with thundering ahoy\\", referring to the forces of a storm that hit the coast. Here the meaning was extended to refer to noise. If Haspel was alluding to the sound of the wind, the spelling ahoei, which is pronounced [a ÀàhuÀêi], contains an onomatopoeic element. In the 1950s ahoi was considered outdated. However, the expression was still generally known. Evidence for the use of ahoy in Friesian are lacking in comprehensive dictionaries of that language. = Ahoy in Rotterdam = Ahoy also refers to the short form of the Rotterdam Ahoy, a big conference center in the Netherlands. It originally consisted of only one hall that was used for the exhibition Rotterdam Ahoy! in the 1950s. The exhibition was held as part of the reconstruction of the city after the war and was originally called Ahoy‚Äô, the additional accent is intended to remind the reader of the exclamation mark in the name of the exhibition. In 1968 it was moved to the district of Charlois and developed into an extensive complex of buildings over the years. Charlois is the place of origin of the Tamboer- en Trompetterkorps Ahoy, the Tambour- and Trumpetcorps Ahoy, founded in 1955. We do not know whether it was called this because the term ahoy expressed the sense of reconstruction in Rotterdam at the time and was already outdated in a maritime context. The marching band first performed on the Koninginnedag (Queens' Day) in 1956 and became more popularly known because of their innovative formations, their previously uncommon antiphonal singing and faster marching music. In 1962 they won first prize at the Wereld Muziek Concours in Kerkrade and later played at the Sanremo Music Festival. The group split up in 2003 because of a lack of successors. The Show-Musikkorps Ahoy-Hamburg was founded in Hamburg in 1975.

Kopenhagen 1837, zitiert nach: ders.: Udvalgte Skrifter. Bd. 6, Kopenhagen 1896, S. 288. In the same year Saint-Aubin's German translation \\"‚ÄöAhoi, ein Segler!‚Äò, rief der Matrose vom Mers\\", is an example of early evidence in the German-speaking world. The Swedish author Emilie Flygare- Carl√©n wrote in 1842: \\"√ñrnungen reddes till en ny f√§rd p√• den klarnade b√∂ljan; manskabet skrek sitt muntra ‚Äö√•-hoj!‚Äò\\"Emilie Flygare-Carl√©n: Rosen p√• Tistel√∂n. Stockholm 1842, S. 495 The German translator of 1843 avoided the use of √•-hoj and formulated it as such: \\"The young eagle was prepared for a new journey through the clear waves; the crew let out its cheerful shout of Hiaho.\\"Emilie Flygare-Carl√©n: Die Rose von Tistel√∂n, √ºbersetzt von Gottlob Fink. 7 B√§ndchen in 2 B√§nden, Band 2; Stuttgart 1843; S. 123.

The international call which is sometimes accredited to a Bohemian sailor in the 17th century has since been proven to be wrong.Website des Museums der unerh√∂rten Dinge , Berlin, aufgerufen am 21.

Ismaning 2008, S. 41 However the Institute for the Czech Language http://www.ujc.cas.cz/jazykova-poradna/dotazy/0123.html rejects all of the above, stating that it was first referred to in an 1888 (spelt Ahoi as in German) as a greeting used by sailors, and that by the time of a 1935 dictionary the use had spread from sailors to boaters and scouts (see also the German section for the boaters' magazine titled \\"Ahoi\\"). = nazdar, ahoj, ƒçau = The spread of ahoj mainly dates back to the 1920s, when Czech adolescents and students populised canoeing on the South Moravian and Bohemian rivers. The canoers formed a type of movement called Wandervogel, some called themselves trampov√©, Tramps, or skauti, Scouts. As early as the 1930s Czech linguists believed the skauti as the carriers and distributors of the word ahoj.P≈ôiruƒçn√≠ slovn√≠k jazyka ƒçesk√©ho (Handw√∂rterbuch der tschechischen Sprache).

The Sokol movement with its preference for traditional gymnastics did not fit the adolenscent's spirit of optimism and progress, which cultivated an internationally and trendily* perceived sport with its own greeting. They positioned their form of ahoj from sailors, which possibly coming from the lower parts of Germany, against Sokol's nazdar, Czech for hail. Nazdar was used in general across the Czech and Czechoslovak society, but within a few decades, the modern-day ahoj replaced this old- fashioned expression. Graffiti on a wall of a house in Bratislava, 1997 The Czech and Slovak ironic love of language contributed to the distribution of ahoj. In Slovakia ahoj-derivates are used in variety of different scenarios, such as the diminutive \\"ahojƒçek\\", as a toast \\"ahojka\\", to a greater extent the plural-form \\"ahojte\\", as well as the grammatically correct we-form \\"ahojme sa\\".Bra≈ào Hochel: Slovn√≠k slovensk√©ho slangu (W√∂rterbuch des slowakischen Slangs).

Mills, circa 1915. Enos Abijah Mills (April 22, 1870 ‚Äì September 21, 1922) was an American naturalist, author and homesteader. He was the main figure behind the creation of Rocky Mountain National Park. Enos Mills was inducted into the Colorado Business Hall of Fame by Junior Achievement-Rocky Mountain and the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce in 2016.  Early and personal life  Mills was born in Pleasanton, Kansas, near the later site of the Mine Creek Battlefield of the Civil War. His parents were Enos Mills, Sr., and Ann Lamb Mills. He had ten brothers and sisters, who are listed in order of birth: Augustus, Elkhanah, Mary, Naomi Victoria, Ruth, Sarah, Ellen, Sabina Isabelle (Belle), Horace, Enoch Joe. He married Esther Burnell on August 12, 1918. Their only child, Enda Mills, was born on April 27, 1919.  Colorado and Montana  He moved to Colorado in 1884 at the age of 14. He suffered from an unidentifiable illness which he later discovered to be an allergy to wheat. At age 15, he made his first ascent of Longs Peak. Over the course of his life, he made the trip 40 times by himself and nearly 300 additional times as a guide. He built his homestead near Longs Peak and the town of Estes Park, Colorado at the age of 15, completing it at 16. Enos filed his homestead application on 3 February 1893 and received his patent on 16 November 1898 for 160 acres. His tract is located in Larimer County, Colorado on the west half of the southwest quarter of section 26 (80 acres) and the west half of the northwest quarter of section 35 (80 acres) of township 4 north and range 73 west of the 6th PM. In the winter of 1887 he moved to Butte, Montana. There he lived and worked intermittently until 1902, spending some of his summers traveling the West Coast of the United States, Alaska, and Europe. In 1889, he had a chance encounter with famed naturalist John Muir on a San Francisco beach, and from that point on Mills dedicated his life to conservation activism, lecturing, and writing. In 1902, Mills returned to Colorado and purchased the Longs Peak House near Estes Park from his cousin, Elkanah Lamb. Mills hired and trained nature guides there, who guided many people up Longs Peak and the surrounding area. His methods of nature interpretation are still taught to students in the field of interpretation. From 1902 to 1906, Mills was a Colorado State Snow Observer, a position in which he measured the snow depths to predict spring and summer runoff. Following this position, he served as government lecturer on forestry from 1907‚Äì1909. Naturalist and author Enos A. Mills, The End of the Trail, published in The National Parks Portfolio, 1921 Mills authored several articles and books on nature and Estes Park area, beginning in the first decade of the 20th century. His speeches generally focused on the lives of trees, forestry issues, preservation of natural lands, and the lives of wild animals. Often in his speeches and written articles he encouraged people of all ages to get outside and into nature. Mills continued to lecture and write books until his death. Rocky Mountain National Park Mills led the fight to preserve the area around Longs Peak as a national park, and used his speeches, his writing, and photography to lobby for the park. He wanted a park of about 1,000 square miles that would cover the area from Wyoming to Pikes Peak. Mills was aided by the Sierra Club, Daughters of the American Revolution, American Civic Association, the General Federation of Women's Clubs and especially, Freelan Oscar Stanley, founder of the Stanley Hotel. President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the bill that made the Rocky Mountain National Park the tenth national park on January 26, 1915. It was 352.5 square miles. He was called the \\"Father of Rocky Mountain National Park\\" by the Denver Post. Death Mills died at age 52 in 1922. He died from blood poisoning from an infected tooth. His wife, Esther Burnell Mills, was co-author with Hildegarde Hawthorne, on the book Enos Mills of the Rockies, which was published in 1935. Mills Lake, within the Rocky Mountain National Park, was named in his honor. Publications  Enos A.

Richard Bundy and Jon Nese. This program debuted before the 2005 football season in an effort to give students, alumni, and fans an alternative viewpoint from the mainstream media. The idea was that the program would put together two faculty members from completely different disciplines to give their take on university sports happenings. In its run, the program became renowned for its thorough insight into the ins and outs of university athletics. Instead of focusing just on football, Nese would often highlight more obscure sports in a segment called - \\"Perfecting the Craft\\" - in which he looked into sports such as fencing, women's rugby, among others. Bundy was the Director of the Penn State Blue Band during the show's tenure and Nese is a professor in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. The show's theme song that was played before and after the jump was a rendition of the popular Hartford Whalers theme song Brass Bonanza, a brass tune that had been defunct since the Whalers hockey team moved from Hartford in 1997. Frequent guests included Senior Women's Administrator Susan Delaney Sheetz, Mike the Mailman, Joe Battista, then Lady Lion's coach Rene Portland, and Kelly Goodman. Each week, the program was paid a visit from Penn State graduate and current NFL Network personality, Kimberly Jones. In her segment, \\"Keeping Up with the Jones\\", Jones provided color commentary alongside Bundy and Nese on the topics of the day. Additionally, the segment would profile Penn State's Center for Sports Journalism and would from time to time highlight a rising student by giving he or she the opportunity to chime in and share in the day's stories. The combination of discussion, guests, and cool music made the show popular among listeners in the 1:00PM‚Äì3:00PM timeslot, but eventually Nese and Bundy decided to focus on other commitments and new hosts were not found. The program ended after the 2006-2007 schoolyear, with Bundy uttering his signature sign-off \\"For The Glory\\" one final time on May 15, 2007.

In 1904 he succeeded Joseph Pulitzer as editor of Pulitzer's newspaper The World of New York. He became famous for his editorials in support of the policies of liberal Democrats, especially Woodrow Wilson, during the Progressive Era. Career Cobb was born to a Yankee farm family in Shawnee County, Kansas, which includes the state capital Topeka. His parents were Minor H. Cobb and Mathilda A (Nee Clark) Cobb, who was the first White child born in Grand Rapids. He grew up in a lumber camp in Michigan. Educated at local schools with a term as the state college, at age 21 he became a cub reporter on the Grand Rapids Herald for $6 a week. He moved up to political correspondent and finally city editor. After working on the rival Grand Rapids Daily Eagle (acquired by the Grand Rapids Press in 1892), Cobb went to a major metropolitan paper, the Evening News of Detroit, as political correspondent covering state politics. His vivid writing style and strong opinion brought a promotion to editorial writer in 1896, and chief editorial writer in 1899. He was married first in 1897 to Delia S. Bailey and second, on October 2, 1913, to Margaret Hubbard Ayer, a well-known newspaper woman. He and Ayer were the parents of columnist Hubbard Cobb. He worked in New York City but retreated as often as possible to their suburban estate near Westport, Connecticut. Cobb was editor of The World for almost twenty years, from 1904 until his death from cancer on December 21, 1923. A few months later, his widow received a special Pulitzer Prize \\"awarded to the widow of the late Frank I. Cobb, New York World, in recognition of the distinction of her husband's editorial writing and service.\\" The organization now lists it as one of the Editorial Writing Pulitzers, which The Boston Herald won in 1924.\\"Editorial Writing\\". The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2013-12-07. New York World Cobb was editorial writer at the Detroit Free Press from 1900 to 1904, when he was hired by Joseph Pulitzer, who owned the crusading New York City newspaper The World, then one of the two largest papers in the country. Cobb soon became Pulitzer's chief advisor and editorial writer. The World reached the common man by a variety of news and entertainment features and was a power in the Democratic Party because of its liberalism and its crusades against big business and government corruption. Cobb's hard-hitting editorials were widely read and reprinted. At the 1912 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, Cobb was a leader in making Woodrow Wilson, the intellectual Governor of New Jersey, the Democratic nominee for president. Cobb and Wilson became lifelong allies and personal friends. Relations with Pulitzer Cobb was a fiercely independent journalist who resisted Pulitzer's attempts to \\"run the office\\" from his home. However the elder man might try, he simply could not keep from meddling with Cobb's work. Time after time they battled, often with heated language. While they found common ground in their support of Woodrow Wilson as president, they disagreed on many other issues. Pulitzer wrote a precisely worded resignation when his son Ralph Pulitzer took over administrative responsibility in 1907, which was printed in every New York paper except The World. Pulitzer raged at the insult, but slowly began to respect Cobb's editorials and independent spirit. Exchanges, commentaries, and messages between them increased. The good rapport between the two was based largely on Cobb's flexibility. In May 1908, Cobb and Pulitzer met to outline plans for a consistent editorial policy. However, the editorial policy did waver on occasion. Renewed battles broke out over the most trivial matters. Pulitzer's demands for editorials on contemporary breaking news led to overwork by Cobb. Pulitzer revealed concern by sending him on a six-week tour of Europe to restore his spirit. Pulitzer died shortly after Cobb's return (in October 1911); then Cobb published Pulitzer's beautifully written resignation. Cobb retained the editorial policies he had shared with Pulitzer until he died of cancer in 1923.Louis M.

His book Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife (2012) describes his 2008 near-death experience and asserts that science can and will determine that the brain does not create consciousness and that consciousness survives bodily death. Alexander is also the author of the 2014 book The Map of Heaven which builds on the claims in his previous book, and coauthor of the 2017 book Living in a Mindful Universe which describes his personal journey since 2008. Early life and education Alexander was born in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was adopted by Eben Alexander Jr and his wife Elizabeth West Alexander and raised in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, with three siblings. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (A.B., 1975), and the Duke University School of Medicine (M.D., 1980). Medical career Alexander has taught and had appointments at Duke University Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, University of Massachusetts Medical School, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana‚ÄìFarber Cancer Institute et al. Page 95: \\"On August 6, 2008, the patient filed a $3 million lawsuit against Alexander, accusing him of negligence, battery, spoliation, and fraud. The purported cover-up, the changes Alexander had made to the surgical report, was a major aspect of the suit. Once again, a lawyer was accusing Alexander of altering the historical record when the historical record didn't fit the story he wanted to tell.\\" While practicing medicine in Lynchburg at the Lynchburg General Hospital, Alexander was reprimanded by the Virginia Board of Medicine for performing surgery at an incorrect surgical site, two times over the course of a month. In one instance, Alexander altered his operative report because he believed the surgery had diminished the patient's symptoms. He was sued by the patient for damages totaling $3 million in August 2008, but the case was dismissed by the plaintiff in 2009. As a result of the mishaps, Alexander lost his privileges at the hospital and was forced to pay a $3,500 fine to the Virginia Board of Medicine and complete ethics and professionalism training to maintain an unrestricted medical license in the state. Following the release of his 2012 book Proof of Heaven, Esquire magazine reported that Alexander had been terminated or suspended from multiple hospital positions, and had been the subject of several malpractice lawsuits and that he settled five malpractice suits in Virginia within a period of ten years. Writing career=Proof of Heaven In 2012, Alexander authored a semi-autobiographical book Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon‚Äôs Journey into the Afterlife, in which he asserted that his self-experience of out of body and near-death experience (NDE), while in a meningitis-induced coma in 2008, suggested that consciousness is independent of the brain and that death is a transition phase into another realm.Alexander, Eben (2012), Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife, Simon & Schuster, pg 169.Alexander, Eben (2012), Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife, Simon & Schuster, pg 40. Alexander said in a New York Times interview that he had preferred a title of \\"An N of One\\" (a medical trial size of one patient) instead of \\"Proof of Heaven\\". He said, believers in heaven were not happy with the title because, \\"This is not scientific proof.\\" Alexander's book was excerpted in a Newsweek magazine cover story in October 2012.Alexander, Eben (October 8, 2012), \\"Heaven Is Real: A Doctor‚Äôs Experience With the Afterlife\\", Newsweek. Alexander provided a slightly more technical account of the events described in his book in an article, \\"My Experience in Coma\\", in AANS Neurosurgeon, the trade publication of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Since the release of the book, he has presented hundreds of lectures around the world in churches, hospitals, medical schools, and academic symposia, besides appearing on TV shows including Super Soul Sunday with Oprah Winfrey. Alexander has also expanded on his NDE in the Congress of Neurological Surgeons and the peer-reviewed Journal of the Missouri State Medical Association. Proof of Heaven was included on The New York Times Best Seller list for 97 weeks. =Criticism and reaction to Proof= In a 2013 investigation of Alexander's story and medical background, Esquire found what it said were discrepancies with regard to Alexander's version of events in the book. Among the discrepancies, was that Alexander had written the cause of his coma was bacterial meningitis, despite his doctor telling the reporter that he had been conscious and hallucinating before being placed in a medically induced coma. In a statement responding to the criticism, Alexander maintained that his representation of the experience was truthful and that he believed in the message contained in his book. He argued that the Esquire article \\"cherry- picked\\" information about his past to discredit his accounts of the event. A review of his medical records published in the The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease suggested that his coma was not drug-induced and that Alexander's description of his experience was consistent with other near-death experiences rather than a dream or hallucination. Proof of Heaven was also criticized by scientists, including Sam Harris who described Alexander's NDE account on his blog as \\"alarmingly unscientific\\", and that claims of experiencing visions while his cerebral cortex was shut down demonstrated a failure to acknowledge existing brain science with little evidence prove otherwise. Neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks agreed with Harris, and argued that Alexander had failed to recognize that the experience could have been the result of his cortex returning to full function at the outset of his coma, rather than a supernatural experience.Sacks, Oliver, \\"Seeing God in the Third Millennium\\", The Atlantic Monthly (December 12, 2012). In 2012 Alexander responded to critics in a second Newsweek article, where he said that he vividly remembers having periods of hallucination and explains that there was a massive difference between them and his 'fully immersive' visions of the afterlife. Alexander describes the hallucinations in his book, saying that they were disjointed and centred around both random events and his doctors.  The Map of Heaven  Alexander's second book, The Map of Heaven: How Science, Religion, and Ordinary People Are Proving the Afterlife, was published in October 2014, where he again asserted the existence of an afterlife and that consciousness is independent of the brain. Alexander framed his observations with quotations from spiritual teachers and paired them with the recent work of scientists with the aim of bridging religion and science. He cross-referenced spiritual experiences from readers and different religions to build his case on what heaven looked like. The Map of Heaven was number 12 on the New York Times bestseller list during the week ending November 2, 2014. Living in a Mindful Universe Alexander's third book, Living in a Mindful Universe: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Heart of Consciousness, was coauthored with Karen Newell, cofounder of Sacred Acoustics. Published in 2017, the book discusses attempts to understand the true nature of consciousness backed by scientific findings and cultivating a state of harmony with the universe and our higher purpose. The authors also discuss awareness of spiritual realms and developing experience that leads to profound understanding for a more harmonious and peaceful world. Personal life In 2000, Alexander located his birth parents but learned his birth mother did not want to meet him. His birth mother eventually changed her mind and Alexander met his birth parents and siblings in 2007.

Biography Joseph Furttenbach was born in Leutkirch, Germany. From 1607/08 to 1620 he stayed in Italy (especially in Milan, Genoa and Florence). There he did an apprenticeship as a merchant under the supervision of his uncles. Moreover, he studied engineering, military architecture and grew an interest in theatre and stage design while abroad. Through his travels he made detailed accounts of buildings that interested him as well as festivals, processions and dramatic performances. In three of his books he wrote expositions on scenery and lighting for the theatre. He is only second to Nicola Sabbatini as one of the most extensive accounts of backstage practices during the Renaissance. After his stay in Italy, he moved back to Germany and settled in Ulm. There, he had a successful career as an architect and universal engineer. He designs included a hospital, a waterworks system, a schoolhouse, a theatre, and homes. He was eventually named city architect of Ulm, wrote many books, and served on the city council. His cabinet of curiosities was one of the most famous in Germany. A pious Lutheran, Furttenbach was at the same time an important cultural broker between Baroque Italy and Southern Germany.

It is headquartered in Schiphol, the Netherlands. Teleplan sells products and services in 95 countries and employs over 5000 people.  History  Teleplan was founded in Griesheim (near Frankfurt, Germany) in 1983. Initially, the company serviced broadcasting equipment. Its first customer was Broadcast Television Systems Inc.. As it grew, Teleplan acquired customers in the computer supply business, such as Sony and HP during the PC market boom of the 1980s, by providing outsourced warranty services for the PC industry in Europe. Until 1990, Teleplan concentrated on expanding the borders of its regional foundation in order to serve customers on a larger scale. Major expansions from 1990 onwards included expanding technical knowledge, developing measuring and regulating equipment and developing software in-house in order to supervise the entire process. By 1994, Teleplan had developed into one of the most important players in the German market in the field of CRT monitor repair with a vast number of large European customers. The German Teleplan concept was so successful, client requests for Teleplan's services from other regions became too large to ignore and Teleplan began examining possibilities for establishing a physical network of branches throughout Europe. In December 2019 it was announced Teleplan had been acquired by Clover Wireless.

The current version of Camp des Loges opened in November 2008. It is the second to have been built on the site, the first opening its doors in 1904. In 2022, the club's male football team and academy will move to the Paris Saint-Germain Training Center, which will be located in nearby Poissy. PSG, however, will remain closely linked to its historic birthplace in Saint-Germain-en-Laye as Camp des Loges will become the training ground of the female football team and academy. Development The first Camp des Loges opened in June 1904. Originally, it was a military camp reserved for soldiers of the French Army. In 1970, following the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain to form Paris Saint-Germain, it became the club's training ground. The venue also turned into the training facilities of the Paris Saint-Germain Youth Academy when it opened in 1975. Construction of a new Camp des Loges began in January 2008, on the same site as the old one. The first stone was laid in July 2008 and it was completed in October 2008. At a cost of ‚Ç¨5m, the new training centre was inaugurated in November 2008. In 2013, Paris Saint-Germain announced their sponsorship deal with international communications company Ooredoo. As part of the agreement, Camp des Loges was renamed Ooredoo Training Centre. Stade Municipal Georges Lef√®vre The Stade Municipal Georges Lef√®vre sports complex, whose main stadium has a seating capacity of 2,164 spectators, is located just across the street from Camp des Loges, the training centre of Paris Saint-Germain. It was one of PSG's main grounds until 1974. That year the club moved into Parc des Princes. The stadium ‚Äî as well as the other artificial turf and grass football pitches of the complex ‚Äî hosts training sessions and home matches for the club's male and female youth academy sides. New training ground The Parisian club began scouting locations for its new training ground in 2012. PSG's Qatari owners, led by club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, deemed Camp des Loges and its limited space available as below the club's ambitions. Poissy, Saint-Germain- en-Laye and Thiverval-Grignon were considered for the future training camp. In 2016, PSG selected the Poncy site in Poissy, a commune in the Yvelines department in the western suburbs of Paris Region. Construction will start in spring 2020 and finish in summer 2022. Owned and financed by the club, the Paris Saint-Germain Training Center will bring together PSG's football, handball and judo teams, as well as the football and handball youth academies. It will replace Camp des Loges ‚Äî the club's current training facility in nearby Saint-Germain-en-Laye ‚Äî upon its completion in 2022. 25 minutes away from Parc des Princes and 15 minutes from Camp des Loges, the 74-hectare site is part of PSG's global strategy to become one of the best-performing multi- sport clubs in the world.

History The genus Oxymonas within Excavata, was discovered by Janicki in 1915 within termites. Oxymonas was established in order to accommodate a newly discovered species, Oxymonas granulosa. Through the discovery of Oxymonas, Janicki was also responsible for coining the term karyomastigont for a new structure which was observed in this genus and other termite symbionts. Structure Oxymonas is found to be sub- elliptical in its body shape and has a pointed posterior end. Oxymonas is distinguishable by the rostellum, which can be thought of as a elongated proboscis. The rostellum projects anteriorly from the organism and ends in a holdfast apparatus that allows for the attachment to the gut of the termite. The rostellum is composed of a system of microtubules. Oxymonas have two pairs of flagella which originate from pairs of basal bodies, which are located at the base of the rostellum. These basal body pairs are connected to the preaxostyle, which is a paracrystalline structure. In addition to the preaxostyle, there is an axostyle. This organelle moves the Oxymonas by undulating and changing shape in a sinusoidal fashion. The axostyle is also composed of microtubules. Oxymonas secondarily lost their mitochondria and the Golgi dictyosomes. Because Oxymonas lack both these cellular components, energy producing processes must take place in the cytoplasm of the cell. Genes encoding proteins that would be functional in the Golgi are present, thus indicating that they evolved to lose their Golgi dictyosomes over time. Oxymonas are useful to serve as models regarding mitochondrial evolution as they are one of the few known eukaryotes to have completely lost their mitochondria. The nucleus is ovoid and can be found towards the anterior end close to the axostyle. Due to the endoplasm being clear, wood particles can often be observed within the organisms. An aspect not clearly understood and further focus of research is the composition and structure of the cell surface of Oxymonas.

The film is a joint production of Argentine and Spanish companies. Using a nonlinear narrative, the film depicts a judiciary employee and his boss, a law clerk, in 1974, played by Ricardo Dar√≠n and Soledad Villamil, as they investigate a rape and murder case, while also following the characters 25 years later reminiscing over the case and unearthing the buried romance between them. The film received awards in both Hollywood and Spain, notably the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 82nd Academy Awards, making Argentina, with 1985's The Official Story, the first country in Latin America to win it twice. Three weeks before, it had received the Spanish equivalent with the Goya Award for Best Spanish Language Foreign Film. At the time of its release, it became the second highest-grossing film in Argentine history, surpassed only by 1975's Nazareno Cruz and the Wolf. In 2016, The Secret in Their Eyes was ranked No. 91 by international critics for the BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century. Plot In June 1974, judiciary agent Benjamin Esp√≥sito investigates the rape and murder of Liliana Colotto de Morales. Esp√≥sito promises her husband Ricardo he will find the killer and give him a life sentence. Esp√≥sito is helped by his alcoholic partner Pablo Sand√≥val and the new department chief Irene Men√©ndez-Hastings. Romano, Esp√≥sito's rival, accuses two immigrant workers of the murder, which angers Esp√≥sito upon discovering that both of them were tortured to obtain a confession. Esp√≥sito finds a lead while watching old photos of Liliana, which Ricardo gave him: many of them featured a man, identified as Isidoro G√≥mez, staring at her suspiciously. Esp√≥sito and Sand√≥val sneak into G√≥mez's mother's house in Chivilcoy. During the break-in, they find some letters from G√≥mez to his mother. Sand√≥val steals them and Esp√≥sito finds out after returning to Buenos Aires. Their \\"visit\\" only causes them trouble with their higher-ups, and they are unable to find any evidence in the letters. G√≥mez is still on the loose due to a careless phone call from Ricardo to G√≥mez's mother, in a desperate quest for his wife's killer. Ultimately, the case is closed. In 1975, Esp√≥sito finds Ricardo in a train station in Retiro and discovers that he was trying to find G√≥mez in multiple stations. Esp√≥sito convinces Men√©ndez to reopen the investigation. Meanwhile, while getting drunk in a bar, Sand√≥val makes a discovery: an acquaintance of his identifies several names on the letters ‚Äì seemingly without any connection ‚Äì as footballers of Racing Football Club. After identifying him as a Racing fan, Esp√≥sito and Sand√≥val attend a game between Racing and Hurac√°n, in hopes of finding G√≥mez. While keeping an eye on the game's attendees in Hurac√°n's stadium, Esp√≥sito and Sand√≥val locate G√≥mez among the crowd, but a sudden goal causes a hubbub and allows G√≥mez to flee. A chase ensues and G√≥mez is caught by the stadium's security guards. Esp√≥sito and Men√©ndez then grill him illegally, with Men√©ndez making G√≥mez confess after hurting his male pride. G√≥mez is tried and sentenced, but Romano bails him out one month later in order to get revenge on Esp√≥sito and hires him as a hitman for the right-wing faction of the Peronist Party. Esp√≥sito and Men√©ndez try to reverse it, but are stopped by Romano's intervention. Esp√≥sito informs Morales that his wife's killer will never go to prison. Weeks later, Sand√≥val gets in a bar fight, causing Esp√≥sito to take him to his flat and fetch his wife. They find the door pried open, his pictures flipped over and Sand√≥val shot dead in his room. Esp√≥sito soon concludes that G√≥mez/Romano sent assassins after him, but Sand√≥val impersonated him to protect his friend. Fearing for his life, Esp√≥sito goes into hiding for 10 years in Jujuy Province with Men√©ndez's cousins. Esp√≥sito returns to Buenos Aires in 1985 to find G√≥mez missing, Romano murdered during the National Reorganization Process, and Men√©ndez married with two children. In 1999, Esp√≥sito tries to make sense out of the case and visits Ricardo, who moved in 1975 to an isolated cottage in a rural area of the Buenos Aires Province. Ricardo loses control when Benjam√≠n asks him how he coped with his wife's death and the unfair end of the investigation, since G√≥mez was never seen again after becoming part of Isabel Per√≥n‚Äôs security detail. Ricardo tells Benjam√≠n that he kidnapped and murdered G√≥mez years earlier, and Benjam√≠n leaves. Moments later, however, Benjam√≠n drives back to Ricardo‚Äôs house, where he finds Ricardo giving food to G√≥mez, whom Ricardo kept imprisoned for 25 years without talking to him. G√≥mez begs Benjamin for human contact, but Ricardo tells Benjamin he promised him \\"a life sentence\\". Back in Buenos Aires, Benjam√≠n visits Pablo's grave for the first time. He then goes to Irene's office, ready to confess his love to her, something she was always expecting from him. Smiling and expectant upon his visit, she tells him to close the door.

The main events transpire in 1975, a year before the start of Argentina's last civil-military dictatorship (1976-1983); the final year of the presidency of Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n saw great political turmoil, with both leftist violence and state- sponsored terrorist organization, especially at the hands of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (usually known as Triple A or AAA), a far-right death squad founded in 1973 and particularly active under Isabel Per√≥n's rule (1974‚Äì1976). A military coup in 1976 triggered the so-called \\"Dirty War\\", which is foreshadowed in the character of Isidoro Gomez and his protection by the government due to his work helping that administration and its judicial system to find (and later kill) left-wing activists and militants or guerrilla members. The dictatorship's National Reorganization Process was a period of more than seven years (1976-1983) marred by widespread human rights violations.CONADEP, Nunca M√°s Report, Chapter II, Section One:Advertencia, Atrocities in Argentina (1976‚Äì1983) Holocaust Museum Houston The state- sponsored terrorism of the military Junta created a climate of violence whose victims were in the thousands and included left-wing activists and militants, intellectuals and artists, trade unionists, High School and College/University students and journalists, as well as Marxists, Peronist guerrillas or alleged sympathizers of both. It is estimated that some 10,000 of the disappeared were guerrillas of the Montoneros (MPM), the oldest guerrilla organization, which began to operate in 1970, and the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP).El ex l√≠der de los Montoneros entona un ¬´mea culpa¬ª parcial de su pasado, El Mundo, 4 May 1995 Although in the period there was leftist violence involved, mostly by Montoneros, most of the victims were unarmed non-combatants, and the guerrillas were exterminated by 1979, while the dictatorship carried out its crimes until the exit from power.\\"Argentina: In Search of the Disappeared\\" Time Magazine - Amnesty International reported in 1979 that 15,000 disappeared had been abducted, tortured and possibly killed.

By 1985 the government had promoted the Trial of the Juntas, which prosecuted and condemned the men who were at the top of the military hierarchies during the country's last dictatorship, stopping short of prosecuting the other militars and civilians who were also responsible for the period's crimes. The second period portrayed is 1999, during the last days of Carlos Menem's administration. During this time, the national laws known as the \\"Full stop\\" law (\\"Ley de Punto Final\\") and Due Obedience ‚Äì sanctioned during the 1980s ‚Äì were still in effect. These legal elements, popularly known as \\"the amnesty laws\\", had effectively blocked the investigation of thousands of cases of human rights abuses committed during the time of the country's last dictatorship. This period of Argentina's History is shown to stress the predicament in which the character of Ricardo Morales lived, since the impunity that criminals and human rights abusers like G√≥mez enjoyed at the time prevented Morales to bring the former to justice: the penal system would have convicted Morales for his past actions. At the same time, many former torturers and murderers of the dictatorship ‚Äì who had previously been friends or partners of G√≥mez ‚Äì were free at the time, and would have likely taken revenge on Morales. This fact further explains why Morales isolated and locked himself up with G√≥mez for so many years. In 2003 the political climate changed, and during President Nestor Kirchner's administration, the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws, along with the executive pardons, were declared null and void, first by the Congress and then by the Supreme Court. These changes, promoted by the government in 2005,Argentina: Amnesty Laws Struck Down 14 June 2005 - Human Rights Watch enabled the judicial power to prosecute and trial all the orchestrators of State-sponsored terrorism, also including politically-motivated criminal acts committed in 1975. The crimes of that period are still being judged as of 2020.Secret in Their Eyes: The Gashes of History, by Carla Marcantonio 12 Dec 2015 - Huffington PostTwo trials of crimes against humanity continue electronically 05-31-2020, Telam All news (tag) of Trials for crimes against humanity Telam  Production  For this joint Argentine/Spanish production, Campanella returned from the United States, where he had directed episodes of the television series House and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, to film The Secret in Their Eyes. It marked his fourth collaboration with actor-friend Ricardo Dar√≠n, who had previously starred in all three of Campanella's Argentine-produced films in the lead role. Frequent collaborator Eduardo Blanco, however, is not featured in the movie; the part of Dar√≠n's character's friend is played instead by comedian Guillermo Francella. In addition to presenting the appropriate ambiance for Argentina in the mid-1970s, it features a formidable technical achievement in creating a continuous five-minute-long shot (designed by visual effects supervisor Rodrigo S. Tomasso), that encompasses an entire stadium during a live football match. From a standard aerial overview we approach the stadium, dive in, cross the field between the players mid-match and find the protagonist in the crowd, then take a circular move around him and follow him as he shuffles through the stands until he finds the suspect, continuing with a feverish stop-and-go chase on foot through the murky rooms and corridors beneath the stands, finally ending under the lights in the middle of the pitch. The scene was filmed in the stadium of football club Hurac√°n, and took three months of pre-production, three days of shooting and nine months of post-production. Two hundred extras took part in the shooting, and visual effects created a fully packed stadium with nearly fifty thousand fans. Reception The Secret in Their Eyes received very positive reviews from critics, not only in Argentina, but also abroad. It holds a 89% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 140 reviews, and an average rating of 7.72/10. The website's critical consensus is: \\"Unpredictable and rich with symbolism, this Argentine murder mystery lives up to its Oscar with an engrossing plot, Juan Jose Campanella's assured direction, and mesmerizing performances from its cast.\\" On the website Metacritic it holds a score of 80 out of 100, based on 36 critical reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Remake In 2015, American filmmaker Billy Ray wrote and directed a remake of The Secret in Their Eyes, under the same title. The remake starred Julia Roberts, Nicole Kidman, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Dean Norris, Michael Kelly, and Alfred Molina. The film was released by STXfilms on 20 November 2015. It received mixed reception from critics, who praised its performances but compared it unfavorably to the original.

In the , Acland had a population of 32 people. Originally built to support what would become Queensland's oldest continuously worked coal mine, the town had a population of between 200 and 400 prior to the mine being shut down in 1984. In 2008 almost all properties comprising the town were purchased by the new mine operators with the intention that they be demolished as the open cut mine expands into the town site. By 2009 there was only one remaining resident, Glenn Beutel, who had refused the company's offer to purchase his property. Geography Acland is north of Oakey, on the Darling Downs, west of Queensland's state capital, Brisbane. History The town is Acland is believed to be named by then Commission of Railways, Charles Barnard Evans, whose mother's maiden was Acland. Lagoon Creek Provisional School opened on 22 July 1885. On 1 January 1909 it became Lagoon Creek State School. From 1915 to 1920 it was called Acland State School. It closed on 31 August 1930. Acland town developed following the mining of coal in the area by the Acland Coal Company. The town had a police officer by 1913, at which time there was also a primary school nearby, known as Lagoon Creek.Masters, pp 5, 6, 14. Acland Railway Station Post Office opened on 1 May 1913. It was replaced by Acland Post Office in 1969, which closed October 1998. Acland State School opened on 28 February 1921. It was mothballed in December 2004. It was permanently closed on 24 August 2005. The Acland number two colliery opened in 1929, and in the 1940s and 1950s it employed 52 people. Church of England in Acland after the tornado of 6 December 1952. On Saturday 8 December 1952, most of the buildings in the town were damaged by a tornado. The Anglican Church, the Presbyterian Church, the public hall and butcher's shop were all destroyed beyond repair. St Jude's Anglican Church was dedicated on 21 June 1953 by Reverend Rupert Warner Shand. The church had been rebuilt after the previous church was destroyed by the tornado in December 1952. Its closure on 5 December 2006 was approved by Venerable G. F. Harch, Archdeacon of The Downs. By 1971, with demand for coal for transport in decline, Acland was home to the only remaining coalmine on the Darling Downs. The mine was Queensland's \\"oldest and smallest continuously worked coal mine\\" at the time of its closure in 1984. The old colliery is state heritage-listed, being \\"the most intact mine site of its age and type in Queensland\\". From the mine's closure in 1984, to the sale of the site to the Shire of Rosalie in 2000, the workings were operated as a mining museum by Kath and John Greenhalgh, the owners of the farm on which the mine was located. In September 2006 Kath & John Greenhalgh sold the land to New Acland Pastoral Company. In the 1980s Acland was a six- time winner of the Queensland Tidy Town Award for towns with a population between 200 and 400, and the inaugural overall Tidy Town prize in 1989. In 1999, New Hope Coal moved into the area and established the New Acland Mine, an open cut coal mine that since 2005 has been New Hope's main coal producing operation. Anticipating major expansion, the company began to purchase houses in Acland in advance of the area becoming an open cut mine pit, expected to produce 10 million tonnes of coal each year. Ahead of the mine's development, several Queensland bottle trees were prepared for transplantation to the new National Arboretum in Canberra. In December 2008 Glenn Beutel was the only remaining homeowner, having rejected the company's offer to purchase his house. In mid-2010 Beutel continued to resist the company's offers, and was reported to still be maintaining the local park established by his parents. On Monday 4 June 2012, during a live broadcast of ABC show Q&A; from Toowoomba's Empire Theatre, a question was asked by an audience member which made reference to Glenn Beutel being the last resident of Acland Acland State School opened on 21 February 1921. A declining population meant the primary school had just 12 students by 2004, leading to its closure on 31 December 2004. The school's most notable former student was controversial Australian radio broadcaster, Alan Jones, who started at the school in 1946.Masters, p. 36.

Life Mar√≠a Luisa Algarra ‚Äúwas educated first at local schools, then studied at the University Autonomous of Barcelona. At age Twenty she received her law degree, a rather uncommon occurrence for a woman at the time.‚Äù Stroll, 22 She emigrated to France at the end of the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939). There she aided the resistance movement during the Second World War, an effort that resulted in her three-year internment in the Vernet concentration camp.http://www.hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk/people/103 Upon her release, she left Europe to permanently live in Mexico where she met Jos√© Reyes Mesa, the famous painter, whom she married and with whom she had two daughters, Reyes and Fernanda. She had a close friendship with a fellow playwright, the Mexican Emilio Carballido, who described Algarra as ‚Äúasombrosa‚Ä¶atractiva‚Ä¶alta, alt√≠sima‚Äù (astonishing‚Ä¶attractive‚Ä¶tall, very tall).Carballido, 7 She died in 1957 at the age of 41. Work Algarra was best known as a playwright, although she also wrote movie and television scripts and radio novels (arguably having most financial success in the film industry). As well as her original work, she also wrote theatre adaptations of Cervantes‚Äô La Cueva de Salamanca and Juan Ruiz‚Äô La verdad sospechosa. While many of her plays were produced during her lifetime, her texts were not published until after her death. Individual plays were featured in a variety of theatre publications, and a complete anthology was published by Universidad Veracruz, a Mexican Publishing House, in 2008. Her plays often feature a female protagonist and treat a variety of themes, including the situation of women in society, familial conflict, friendship, exile, and love, and Algarra treats many of these concepts from a psychological perspective. Some of her works deal with issues specific to Mexico or her own experience in exile, while others feature universally-applicable issues. Reception Algarra‚Äôs plays were generally well received by her contemporaries. In 1935 she received the Concursal Teatral Universitario award from the Universidad Aut√≥noma in Barcelona for her first play, Judith, which was written in Catalan, and in 1954 she earned the ‚Äúm√°ximo reconocimento en el teatro mexicano‚Äù (the maximum recognition in Mexican theatre)Heras Gonzalez, 335 when she won the award at the Concurso de Grupos Teatrales del Distrito Federal (Mexico City Theatre Conference) for her play Los a√±os de prueba. It is of note that the aforementioned prize is awarded to a play that should be ‚Äúde autor mexicano, escrita con posterioridad al a√±o 1917, y tratar un problema mexicano‚Äù (by a Mexican author, written after 1917, and about a Mexican problem).Maria y Campos cited in Heras Gonzalez, 335 Los a√±os de prueba also won the INBA and Juan Ruiz de Alarcon awards, the latter for the best play of 1954. Her work has not been the focus of a great amount of literary criticism, but recently has garnered slightly increased attention. Carballido, in his prologue to Algarra‚Äôs complete works anthology affirms that ‚Äúlas obras de teatro‚Ä¶siguen brillantes y actuales‚Äù (the plays continue to be brilliant and currently relevant);Carballido, 9 while other critics are not quite as complimentary. In the Algarra entry in the reference book Teatro espa√±ol [de la A a la Z], by Javier Huerta Clavo, Emilio Peral Vega and Hector Urz√°iz Tortajada, several of her plays are mentioned, and then the authors refer to ‚Äú[t]√≠tulos posteriores‚Ä¶donde insiste en sus ideas antiburguesas y revolucionarias con un plantamiento formal demasiado maniqueo y discursivo‚Äù (later titles where [Algarra] insists on her anti-bourgeois and revolutionary ideas with an overly manichaeistic and overly discursive formal approach).Huerta Calvo, 13 Juan Pablo Heras Gonz√°lez takes a more balanced approach, praising ‚Äúel ingenio de sus di√°logos‚Äù (the ingenuity of her dialogues)Heras Gonzalez, 326 and ‚Äúla densidad psicol√≥gica‚Äù (the psychological density)Heras Gonzalez, 331 of the characters but also concedes that ‚Äúninguna de sus obras alcanza la perfecci√≥n‚Äù (none of her works achieves perfection). He laments that Algarra died when ‚Äúlo mejor de su obra estaba por llegar‚Äù (the best of her work was yet to come) and claims that ‚Äúlogr√≥ una presencia esc√©nica en M√©xico muy superior, que hubiera constituido una de las mayores influencias del exilio teatral espa√±ol en M√©xico, de no haberse interrumpido tan pronto su vida‚Äù (she achieved a superior stage presence in Mexico that would have constituted one of the greatest influences on Spanish theatre of exile in Mexico had her life not been interrupted so early).Heras Gonzalez, 338 Published plays * Judith (1936) * Primavera in√∫til (1944) * Sombra de alas (late 1940s) * Una passion violenta (early 1950s) * Casandra o la llave sin puerta (1953) * Los a√±os de prueba (1954) Movie scriptsimdb.com, keyword Maria Luisa Algarra * √âchame la culpa (1959) (story) * La venenosa (1959) (writer) * Amor se dice cantando (1959) (screenplay) (story) * Los santos reyes (1959) (story) * Aladino y la l√°mpara maravillosa (1958) (writer) ... aka Aladdin and the Marvelous Lamp International: English title) * Las mil y una noches (1958) (dialogue) ... aka A Thousand and One Nights (International: English title) * Refif√≠ entre las mujeres (1958) (story) (as Ma.

S. Rajamouli starring Sunil and Saloni Aswani in lead roles. This is the second film for Sunil in a lead role, and is an important example of a director casting against the norm in the Telugu film industry. The film opened to favourable reviews by critics. This film is inspired by Buster Keaton's 1923 silent comedy film Our Hospitality. The film was remade in five languages including Maryade Ramanna (2011) in Kannada, Faande Poriya Boga Kaande Re (2011) in Bengali, Son of Sardaar (2012) in Hindi, Vallavanukku Pullum Aayudham (2014) in Tamil and Ivan Maryadaraman (2015) in Malayalam. Plot A faction feud in Rayalseema results in the death of Ramineedu's (Nagineedu) brother and he, along with his two sons Mallasuri (Supreeth Reddy) and Baireddy (Prabhakar), vow for revenge. Time turns 28 years and comes to Hyderabad. Here lives Ramu (Sunil), an innocent and somewhat unlucky guy whose parents are no more and is ousted out of his job. His life takes a turn with a correspondence that he has got five acres of land in his hometown in Rayalaseema, Andhra Pradesh. He decides to sell that land and sets off to the village. In this process, he also meets Aparna (Saloni Aswani), who is Ramineedu's daughter. However, much to Ramu's bad luck, he happens to be the son of the man who killed Ramineedu's brother and he ends up in their home itself. He takes advantage of a tradition of their house that not even one drop of blood should fall inside the house. Whether he comes alive out of their hands or not forms the rest of the story.

I didn't want to commit another physically exhausting film immediately after Magadheera. Maryada Ramanna gave us time to recharge our batteries so that we could come up with another huge project.\\" He also revealed the film's plot on the film's launch to minimize the expectations of the audience because of this film's success. Soundtrack The audio was released at a function held at Shilpakala Vedika, Hyderabad. The launch of the audio release was webcast live on the internet, and it got a good response from internet viewers all over the world. Dasari Narayana Rao released the audio and handed over the first copy to K. Raghavendra Rao. The function was also attended by noted film fraternity like Junior NTR, Ravi Teja, Prakash Raj, V. V. Vinayak, Dil Raju, Prabhas, Sirivennela and other prominent cast and crew of the film. Meanwhile, music director MM Keeravani's birthday was also celebrated at a star-studded function. Reception The critic Raghu Chaitanya from CNN-IBN said \\"The climax is perhaps the only drawback in the entire movie as the director opts to take the clich√©d path of emotions and love. Sunil perfectly fits the bill as the innocent guy who comes back to sell his land and make money [...] SS Rajamouli emerges a winner showing that he can make good movies without huge budgets and big star cast.\\" The Times of India gave a two and half stars explained \\"Comedian Sunil, who turned hero with Andalaramudu few years ago this time returns with another roaring comic flick and puts in a restrained performance. However, a well-designed set, great cinematography and mellifluous tunes by Keeravani takes this comic caper to a different plane.\\" Sify which gave a verdict as \\"Worth a watch\\" further noted \\"Sunil would no longer look like a comedy hero. His dances are simply superb, Saloni is beautiful and holds natural sex appeal. It is unfortunate that her talents remained undetected for the last three years, but for Rajamouli, now. She performed with perfection all through the movie. Definitely, she awaits a bright future hereafter, it seems. Maryada Ramanna has a judicious mix of fun, thrill and suspense.\\" Rediff gave a three stars, commented Maryada Ramanna is thoroughly enjoyable. Rajamouli sure has a winner on his hands. Sunil is able to captivate the audience and Saloni looks pretty and is convincing too. Nagineedu portrays the role brilliantly. There are quite a few others like Brahmaji, Anuj Gurwara and Rao Ramesh who perform well.\\" Remakes The film was remade in Kannada as Maryade Ramanna (2011) starring Komal Kumar and Nisha Shah.

Important contributions to the theory of the paradigm were made by British social anthropologist Rodney Needham, who saw it as a basic human classifying device. It shares affinity with the cultural \\"romantic-classic\\" paradigm. p. 309 The term is used to analyze political discourse since the 19th century. It has, however, been suggested that in the 21st century the paradigm will become less useful as a tool of social and political analysis; some of the major current issues (such as global overpopulation, individual liberties and biological warfare) cannot be said to allow for either a left- or right-wing perspective. The left‚Äìright paradigm as political criticism Used in another context, the phrase refers to a political theory that alleges that members of opposing major political parties such as the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States share common interests and goals, as well as a covertly unified ruling authority over the political issues of the masses. The two major political entities act in concert to create divisiveness among the population while keeping control of the political spectrum. This \\"left‚Äìright paradigm\\" concept theorizes that the two opposing political parties utilize their tremendous hold over mainstream media to dramatize political distractions and engage in covert warfare and operations, in grand performances of bureaucratic rivalry meant to propagandize and divide the populace. Divisive issues are purposefully fed through the major media outlets to divert attention away from the ruling class's hidden and ulterior (and sometimes global) agendas. By drawing attention to the differences between the two embedded political systems, ideologies, races and classes, the political groups obscure political clarity and divide unity among the masses. The tactic creates confusion and frustration among the population, which enables the ruling class to increase and consolidate their wealth and power through maintaining an illusion of a two-party system of checks and balances that actually works. The theory contends that the fresh interjection of a new political party or group (such as the expanding Libertarian or Green parties) into the political arena, would be the only way to provide a means to break the cyclical paradigm, currently established in the political system. False left‚Äìright paradigm political theory The \\"false left‚Äìright paradigm\\" is the political theory that members of opposing political parties such as Republican and Democrat deceptively share common interests and goals, as a one body ruling authority over the masses. The two parties act to create divisiveness and influence the general population while keeping control of the political spectrum. The false left‚Äìright paradigm political theory is closely related to theory of Inverted totalitarianism and Managed Democracy. The false left‚Äìright paradigm theorizes that opposing political groups use their influence over the establishment media to dramatize party warfare distraction, in grand performances of bureaucratic rivalry meant to propagandize and divide the populace. Psychological deception is coordinated on all levels of politics and fed through controlled media outlets to divert attention away from the ruling class's hidden agendas. By drawing attention to differences between two political systems, ideologies, races, and classes, the political groups obscure and divide unity among the masses. The tactic creates confusion and frustration among the population, enabling the global elite to increase and consolidate their wealth and power through maintaining an illusion of a two- party system of checks and balances. Former Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) archivist and Georgetown University professor Carroll Quigley, who is known as being President Bill Clinton‚Äôs mentor, wrote in his 1966 book \\"Tragedy and Hope\\"‚Äî :\\"The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers.\\" :\\"Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so the American people can 'throw the rascals out' at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy.\\" See also *Left‚Äìright politics Bibliography * References Category:Political science terminology ","title":"Left‚Äìright paradigm"},{"id":"24522839","text":"Bank of Russia 2001 coin Fedot Alekseyevich Popov (, also Fedot Alekseyev, ; nickname Kholmogorian, , for his place of birth (Kholmogory), date of birth unknown, died between 1648 and 1654) was a Russian explorer who organized the first European expedition through the Bering Strait. He was normally known as Fedot Alekseyev. Only a few sources call him the son of Popov. He was from Kholmogory and the agent of Alexey Usov who was a member of the Gostinaya Sotnya, the highest merchant guild in Moscow. (Some time between 1647 and 1653 Usov petitioned to have Fedot apprehended on the grounds that Usov had sent him to Siberia with 3,500 rubles worth of goods and he had not reported back for eight years.Basil Dymytryshyn, 'Russia's Conquest of Siberia, 1985, volume one, document 82) He went to Siberia in 1639. Moving east, he was at Tyumen, Tobolsk, Tomsk, Yeniseisk (1641) and Yakutsk(1642). In 1642 he joined a group of about 100 men under Ivan Rebrov who went down the Lena to the sea and up the Olenyok River to the west. Fedot had 29 men under him. Two years later they were defeated by the local Tungus and fled down the river. Fedot and some of his companions sailed east to the Kolyma River. When he arrived at Srednekolymsk in 1645 he had 12 men with him and, probably, his Yakut concubine. Hearing of a rich 'Pogycha River' somewhere to the east, he organized an expedition to find it. Since he was not a service-man, Semyon Dezhnev was called in as the official leader. In June 1647 he sailed down the river to the Arctic with 50 men in four koches but they were forced to turn back due to thick ice. Next year they tried again. For a fuller account see Semyon Dezhnev. Sometime in September he rounded the northeastern tip of Asia and entered the Pacific Ocean. On September 20, 1648 (old style, September 30 in our calendar) he was wounded in a fight with the Chukchis. About the first of October (o.s) a storm separated Fedot's and Dezhnev's boats and we lose track of him. In 1653/54 Dezhnev captured his Yakut woman from the Koryaks. She said that Fedot died of scurvy, some of his companions were killed by the Koryaks and the rest fled in small boats to an unknown fate. From the location of the woman's capture, it is likely that his boat was wrecked somewhere not far south of Anadyr Estuary. Dezhnev is usually called the first European to reach the Bering Strait since he was the formal leader and left most of the documents, but Fedot Alexeyev organized the expedition and may have been more important than the few surviving documents indicate. The Fedotov Legend: When, in 1697, Vladimir Atlasov reached Kamchatka, he heard that other Russians had been there first. The natives said that a certain 'Fedotov' and his men had lived on the Nikul River, a tributary to the Kamchatka River, and had married local women. The ruins of their huts could still be seen. The natives thought they were gods or demons and left them alone, but when they saw one Russian kill another, they changed their minds. The Russians were attacked and fled, some going west to the sea of Okhotsk. All were killed, some by the Kamchadals, some by the Koryaks. So who was Fedotov? There have been four answers: 1)Gerhardt Friedrich M√ºller thought he was probably Fedot's son, but offered no evidence. 2)Stepan Krasheninnikov thought he was Fedot himself and tried to reconcile this with the Yakut woman's story. Other versions of Fedotov=Fedot have been tried. 3) He may have been one of the lost men from the Dezhnev or some other expedition. In Siberia at this time there was a Vas'ka Fedotov, a few people who used Fedotov as a patronymic and various Fedors and so on whose names could have been garbled. 4) He was some other Russian who does not appear in the surviving records. About all we can say is that some Russians reached Kamchatka in the second half of the 17th century and died there. Who they were is a matter of speculation.

Gladney (1996) (p. 47) gives no birth year, and 1766 as the death year; Weismann (2007) (p. 83), gives no birth year, and 1753 as the death year. Lipman (1998) does not give exact years for birth and death, and emphasizes differences between different historians' chronologies (p. 67); however, adding up lengths of time intervals in his biographical account implies that Ma would be close to 48 in 1728. The Great Chinese Encyclopedia (‰∏≠ÂõΩÂ§ßÁôæÁßëÂÖ®‰π¶, vol. 14 ÂÆóÊïô (Religion), p. 255) gives 1681-1766.), () also known as Abu 'l-Fut≈´h Ma Laichi, was a Chinese Sufi master, who brought the Khufiyya movement to China and created the Huasi menhuan (Sufi order) - the earliest and most important Naqshbandi (ŸÜŸÇÿ¥ÿ®ŸÜÿØŸäÿ©ÔºåÁ¥çÂÖã‰ªÄÁè≠Ëø™) order in Chinese Muslim history.Gladney (1996), pp. 47-48Lipman (1998), p. 65-67 Ma Laichi's mausoleum (Hua Si Gongbei) in Linxia City. Life=Afaq Khoja's blessing Ma Laichi came from a Chinese Muslim family with a military background. His grandfather, Ma Congshan, was a general under the Ming dynasty; his father, Ma Jiujun, passed imperial examinations on the military track under the Qing, but instead of joining government service, made a fortune in business. His home was in Hezhou (now called Linxia), one of the main Muslim centers of Gansu. According to the legend told by Ma Laichi's followers, Ma Jiajun was still childless at the age of forty, and, desirous to have a son, he went to Xining, to ask for a blessing from Afaq Khoja, a Naqshbandi shaykh visiting from Kashgar, and a reputed miracle worker. After reciting some prayers, the Kashgarian Sufi master told Ma Jiajun to go back to Hezhou and to marry a certain non-Muslim woman, who had previously been engaged a number of times, but every time her fianc√© died before the wedding. Ma Jiajun indeed married that 26-year-old woman, and she bore him a son. Soon after, all Ma Jiajun's property was destroyed by a fire, and he named his son \\"Laichi\\", meaning \\"[one who] came too late\\".Lipman (1998), p. 66. Lipman's telling of the story does not mention whether Ma Jiajun had been married already by the time of his asking for Afaq Khoja's help. One would imagine that he was already married or widowed, otherwise asking for divine intervention to get an heir would make little sense. Thus, it is not clear if he had other wives before, or simultaneously with, Ma Laichi's mother. Rendered destitute by the fire, Ma Jiajun became a tea peddler, travelling in the region between Hezhou and Xining. His boy, meanwhile, studied at the Koranic school run by Khoja Afaq's disciple Ma Tai Baba (, \\"The Great Father Ma\\", 1632‚Äì1709) in the nearby Milagou (). (apparently, within today's Minhe Hui and Tu Autonomous County). Tai Baba's top student, Ma Laichi had learned everything the school had to offer by the age of 18. Tai Baba ordained the young Ma as an ahong and initiated him into Sufism, passing onto him the barakah that he had received from Afaq Khoja. The great Hajj According to Ma Tong's chronology of Ma Laichi's life, after 30 years of religious work in the Hezhou region, Ma Laichi left China in 1728 for a Hajj to Islam's holy places in the Middle East. In 1728-1733 he studied under a number of Sufi masters in the Arab World (primarily in Mecca and Yemen; some versions of his biography also mention Cairo and Damascus). Due to the scarcity and imprecision of existing Chinese and Arabic sources, different researchers have come up with different versions and dates for Ma Laichi's great Hajj: the standard Chinese account by Ma Tong tells of Ma sailing to Arabia from Guangzhou (after studying for 3 months with a famous ahong there), and coming back by the sea route as well; other accounts have him traveling to the west by land, via Central Asia, and studying for a while in Bukhara. In Mecca, his teacher was the head of the Khafiya zawiya (Islamic school) there, Muhammad Jibuni Ahmad Agelai (or Ajilai, in other accounts). Another teacher who influenced him greatly was Mawlana Makhdum, who gave Ma Laichi the name Abu 'l-Fut≈´h. Not much is known about Makhdum, but Joseph Fletcher surmised that he may have been an Indian. The Khufiyya After returning to China, Ma Laichi established the Hua Si (; \\"Multicolored Mosque\\") school (menhuan) - the core of the Khufiyya (ÿÆŸÅŸäŸá) ËôéÂ§´ËÄ∂ movement in Chinese Islam. The name of the movement - a Chinese form of the Arabic \\"Khafiyya\\", i.e. \\"the silent ones\\" - refers to its adherents' emphasis on silent dhikr (invocation of God's name). The Khufiyya teachings were characterized by stronger participation in the society, as well as veneration of saints and seeking inspiration at their tombs. Ma Laichi spent 32 years spreading his teaching among the Muslim Hui and Salar people in Gansu and Qinghai. He also converted to Islam numerous Tibetan,These days, Tibetan-speaking Muslim communities who have been Muslim since the 18th century are officially included into the Hui ethnic group, as there is no separate official designation for them. On the other hand, should a modern Tibetan convert to Islam, he would still officially remain an ethnic Tibetan. (Lipman (1998), p. 23) Mongol,Probably, including the group known now as Bonan. (Lipman (1998), p. 65, citing Ma Tong). and Monguor-speaking communities in Qinghai, sometimes after winning a religious debate with a local \\"Living Buddha\\". Some of these communities still belong to the Khufiyya, and their members still revere Ma Laichi as the saint who brought their ancestors into Islam. Death On the grounds of Hua Si Gongbei After the death of Ma Laichi, his position as the leader of the Khufiyya was inherited by his son, Ma Guobao - an act that came to be strongly criticized by the founder of the competing Jahriyya menhuan, Ma Mingxin.Lipman (1998), p. 179 Ma Guobao was later succeeded by Ma Wuyi.Lipman (1998), p. 111 Ma Laichi's grave in Linxia City was restored in 1986. The shrine complex, which includes a mosque and is known as Hua Si Gongbei (), continues to be the center of the Hua Si Khufiyya menhuan.

The awards are presented each January in New York and have been held since 2011 at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens. Founded by filmmaker A. J. Schnack and Toronto International Film Festival Documentary Programmer Thom Powers, Cinema Eye was created to celebrate artistic craft in nonfiction filmmaking, addressing a perceived imbalance in the field where awards were given for social impact or importance of topic rather than artistic excellence. The awards are presented by the Cinema Eye organization, which is currently led by AJ Schnack, filmmaker Esther Robinson, filmmaker Nathan Truesdell, producer Andrea Meditch, former Hot Docs programmer Sean Farnel and filmmaker Laura Poitras. Nominations for the awards are determined by voting of top film festival documentary programmers and winners are voted on by an invited membership of more than 500 documentary film experts. Cinema Eye also presents an Audience Choice Prize where voting is open to the public. The first Cinema Eye Honors were presented at the IFC Center in New York City on March 18, 2008.

He is most known as pioneer in marketing, and for his The Economics of Retailing (1915) and his Economics of Fashion (1928).  Biography  Nystrom obtained his Ph.B. from the University of Wisconsin in 1909, and his Ph.M. in 1910, and his Ph.D. in 1914Bulletin of Information, Columbia University. 1933, p. 3. under William Amasa Scott (1862‚Äì1944). Nystrom started his academic career as Assistant Professor of Political Economy in the University of Wisconsin. He later became Associate Professor of Economics in the University of Minnesota and eventually professor of marketing at Columbia University, where he retired in 1950. Nystrom served as editor of the American Marketing Journal and as the first editor of its successor, the Journal of Marketing. He was also a founding member of the American Marketing Association. Nystrom is frequently associated with the philosophy of futility, a phrase which he coined in his 1928 book Economics of Fashion to describe the disposition caused by the monotony of the new industrial age.Social Security Death Index (Social Security Administration) Economics of Fashion. Paul Nystrom, The Ronald Press Company p68. (1928).The Journal of Marketing, Volume XXI, No.4 (April, 1957) In this work he also contributed to the concept of Hemline index.  Work = The Economics of Retailing, 1915  The Economics of Retailing, 1915. In the preface of \\"The Economics of Retailing,\\" Nystrom explained the aim of the book and its restrictions: :\\"This book aims to present fact material and to suggest constructive thought on the subject of retail distribution. It does not tell how to get rich quick at retailing. It presents but little theory and advocates no particular or special method of doing the work of the retail store. Its purpose is to describe the retail business as it is, and to point out the broad lines along which retailing progress is being made. :In this work the attempt has been made to reduce the knowledge about retailing to teachable form, and to make it usable alike to the ambitious, thinking man already in business and to the student who desires to gain an intimate insight into this interesting as well as important field of human work.\\"Nystrom (1915, p. v) And furthermore: :\\"Except in fragmentary form, there has been but little written upon which the writer could build. The effort has been made, with what success the reader must judge, to bring together in one volume a summary of the best thought so far expressed; but much of the material presented is the result of the writer's own observation and experience in the retail business, and of what he has gathered in conference with over a thousand retail store managers and salespeople who were students in his classes in retail methods during the years 1909 to 1915.\\" = Distribution and the modern distributive system = Channels of distribution for various lines of goods, 1915 The key concept in \\"The Economics of Retailing\\" is the concept of distribution. Nystrom explained that \\"the term 'distribution' is used in another sense in the standard books on political economy. There, it means the shares of income received by members of society for their participation in, or contribution to, the economic system. The term as used here has no reference to the income of any one.\\"Nystrom (1915, p. 13). The term is used in the meaning of logistics. Nystrom It refers solely to the processes of carrying and exchanging material goods, and, used in that sense, is but a part or a phase of what economic treatises call 'production.' Wherever the term distribution is used in this work it should be remembered that it means distribution of goods, and not what technical treatises on economic theory call distribution of wealth.\\" In the modern distributive system producers and consumers are regularly departed by at least two middlemen: the wholesaler and the retailer. Nystrom presented the following series of charts \\"to give a clear idea of the customary channels of distribution in the main lines of trade passing from the producer to the consumer through retail stores.\\"Nystrom (1915, p. 37) File:Channels of distribution, Heavy Hardware and Silverware, 1915.jpgChannels of distribution, Heavy Hardware and Silverware, 1915 File:Channels of distribution, Drugs and Shoes, 1915.jpgChannels of distribution, Drugs and Shoes, 1915 File:Channels of distribution, Harvesting Machinery, 1915.jpgChannels of distribution, Harvesting Machinery, 1915 File:Channels of distribution, Textiles, 1915.jpgChannels of distribution, Textiles, 1915 File:Channels of distribution, Co-Operative Fruit Marketing,, 1915.jpgChannels of distribution, Co-Operative Fruit Marketing, 1915 = Organization of the department store = In chapter 12 Nystrom described the organization of the department store and introduced two types of organizational structures. He introduced the department store as \\"a retailing institution that deals in several lines of goods, each line separated or 'departmentized' from the rest, both in location within the building and in the concern's accounting and management systems. Each department is considered practically as a store in itself, and in large stores each has its separate organization of buyer, or department manager, and salespeople, much the same as any independent store.\\"Nystrom (1915, p. 195) Internal Organization of Specialty Store, 1915 Internal Organization of Department Store. About the organization he explained: :\\"In a department store, each department or section is considered as a separate specialty store or shop. Its accounts are kept separate, and under normal conditions it must stand on its own feet ; that is to say, it must pay its own expenses, and its prorated share of the general expenditure for rent, light, heat, power, insurance, office up-keep, and so on. In addition to this it must seek to make a net profit. :Each department has its own organization for buying and selling goods, consisting in the former case of its manager or buyer and necessary assistants such as assistant buyer, head of stock, and salespeople. In these respects the department is exactly like a specialty store, but the accounting, advertising, stockroom work, credits and collections, handling of the cash paid out and received, and the delivery of the goods is done for the individual department by special departments organized to serve all of the merchandise departments in the store. The specialty store, selling one line, has its own accounting, advertising, credit, cash, and delivery departments, but in a department store of forty sections, for example, there is but one of each of these departments to serve all of the forty sections.\\"Nystrom (1915, p. 205-7) More specific on the charts, he noted: :\\"The charts will make these relations more clear and indicate the difference between specialty store organization and department store organization. In Chart 1 the single merchandise department of the specialty store is served by all of the surrounding departments. In Chart 2 the merchandise departments A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are all served by the same number of special departments, excepting that one new one has been added, viz., merchandise manager. This official acts as a sort of head buyer for all departments, apportions the buying funds among the departments, advises the buyers, gives approval or disapproval to department sales policies, and so on.\\" = Reception = In a 1916 review of this work Carroll W. Doten expressed the importance of this work. She said: :\\"There can be no doubt that the retail store is one of the most important links in the chain of activities and processes by which the wants of the consumers are met by a ceaseless flow of goods from producers. It would be interesting and enlightening to know just how much this service costs. The author states that the \\"distribution\\" of goods, which includes transportation, insurance, and storage as well as the selling, probably costs more than the manufacturing. It is generally recognized that there is great inefficiency and waste in retailing. Here then is the place where statistics should be made available, if we are to deal intelligently with the rising cost of living. The author has made excellent use of what figures he could get while at the same time he points out their inaccuracies and inadequacy...\\"Carroll W. Doten. \\"Reviewed Work: Economics of Retailing by Paul H. Nystrom\\" in: Publications of the American Statistical Association. Vol. 15, No. 114 (Jun., 1916), pp. 222‚Äì223  Economics of fashion, 1928  In Economics of fashion, Nystrom presented a notable opinion about style and fashion. He stated: :\\"Style is a characteristic, or distinctive, mode or method of expression, presentation, or conception in the field of some art; fashion is nothing more or less than the prevailing style at any given time.\\"Nystrom (1928) cited in: Harold Howard Maynard, Kenneth Dameron, Carlton John Siegler (1938). Retail Marketing and Merchandising. p. 193 Sproles (1974) stated, that \\"for centuries the phenomena of fashion behavior have been the varied subject of social analysts, cultural historians, moral critics, academic theorists, and business entrepreneurs. Spanning decades and centuries of changing fashions, literally thousands of commentaries focusing on the vagaries and nuances of fashion behavior have been published. Taken collectively, this major body of analytical commentary and anecdotal opinion describes fashion as a complex, diffuse, often perplexing, highly visible characteristic of civilizations.\\"Sproles, George B. \\"Fashion theory: a conceptual framework.\\" Advances in consumer research 1.1 (1974): 463‚Äì472. In this matter Nystrom is clearly an exception. Carolyn Mair (2014) added, that Nystrom in his 1931 work had \\"argued that the industrial revolution had induced a ‚Äòphilosophy of futility‚Äô that would increase the consumption of goods and services as an activity for its own sake. He discussed the concept of conspicuous consumption as behavioural addiction, narcissistic behaviour or both which was a means to satisfy consumers‚Äô desire for instant gratification of hedonic expectations.\\"Mair, Carolyn. \\"A Cognitive and Social Psychological Perspective on the demand for fashion.\\" 2014  Selected publications  * Nystrom, Paul H.

Development  As the head of the W.W.S. (Wojskowe Warsztaty Szybowcowe - Military Glider Workshops), Wac≈Çaw Czerwi≈Ñski designed the W.W.S. 1 Salamandra during the mid-1930s. The excellent handling properties, ideal for the solo training methods then in use, led to mass production in various workshops throughout Poland. During World War II, almost all Polish gliders and their technical documentation were destroyed or lost. After the war there was only one Salamandra left, kept hidden during the occupation, and it was decided to resume its production. Due to lack of blueprints, the design was reverse engineered in the IS (Instytut Szybownictwa - Gliding Institute). Five were built in March 1947 by the IS workshops as the first gliders in Poland after the war.Glass, A. (1965), p. 32-34 In 1948 a serial production resumed as IS-A Salamandra 48 in workshops in Je≈º√≥w. It was followed by improved variants Salamandra 49 and 53, produced also by other state-owned aviation factories throughout Poland, among others WSK Okƒôcie. IS-A Salamandra in the Polish Aviation Museum in Krak√≥w Construction of the Salamandra was entirely of wood with fabric covering on wings and tail unit. The fuselage consisted of a plywood covered nacelle for the single seat cockpit, with a wire-braced open strut rear fuselage supporting the cruciform style tail-unit. The high mounted wire braced wings were supported by struts from the bottom of the fuselage to approx 1/5 span. Later versions introduced airbrakes in the wings (Salamandra 49) and a windscreen (Salamandra 53). Wooden skids under the tail and fuselage nacelle comprised the undercarriage. In Salamandra 53 there was introduced a bigger horizontal stabilizer, next retrofitted to earlier versions. The most notable feat by a W.W.S. 1 Salamandra, in Poland, was an 11hr 15min flight by Buraka, between Bras≈Çaw and Wilno, on 22 Aug 1938. Another marathon flight of 23 hours took place in Romania with a licence built version piloted by G. Braescu. After the war, 223 IS-A were built for Polish aero clubs, where they were used until 1962. Before the war the WWS 1 was exported to Yugoslavia, Finland and Estonia. On 29 December 1956 there flew an export version Salamandra 53A ‚Äì around 50 were exported to China, and a licence production started there. In China there was also developed a primary trainer two-seater variant, without a cockpit. In Yugoslavia there was built a similar glider ƒåavka, and in Finland - PIK-5. After migrating to Canada as a refugee, Czerwi≈Ñski designed a modified Salamandra as the Czerwi≈Ñski Sparrow, as well as an improved Sparrow designated Czerwi≈Ñski Robin.

The leather material is typically dyed black, or various shades of brown, but a wide range of colors is possible. Leather jackets can be designed for many purposes, and specific styles have been associated with subcultures such as greasers, rednecks, cowboys, motorcyclists, military aviators, mobsters, police, secret agents, and music subcultures (punks, goths, metalheads, rivetheads), who have worn the garment for protective or fashionable reasons, and occasionally to create a potentially intimidating appearance. Most modern leather jackets are produced in Pakistan, India, Canada, Mexico and the United States, using hides left over from the meat industry. Fabrics simulating leather such as polyurethane or PVC are used as alternatives to authentic animal hide leather depending on the needs of the wearer such as those pursuing vegan lifestyles or for economic reasons as synthetic fibers tend to be less costly than authentic leather. History Soviet tank commander Semyon Krivoshein wearing a black leather coat based on the reefer jacket In the early 1900s aviators and members of the military wore brown leather flight jackets. One of the first modern leather jackets the type A1 was created by Chapal in 1925 . During the Second World War the garments became known as \\"bomber jackets\\" and were heavily insulated and prized for their warmth. The jacket was often part of an overall uniform-ensemble meant to protect bomber pilots from exposure to the extreme climate conditions found at high altitude, and often incorporated sheepskin, using the intact fleece on the inside for warmth. Russian Bolsheviks commonly wore leather jackets, which became a quasi-uniform for commissars during the Russian Civil War, and later for the members of the Cheka. Yakov Sverdlov allegedly initiated this practice. Leon Trotsky, \\"Jacob Sverdlov,\\" 1925. Raw material Antelope, buckskin, lambskin, sheepskin and cowhide are the hides most commonly used to make leather jackets. As soon as the skin is removed from the animal at the meat processing plant, it is refrigerated, salted, or packed in barrels of brine. It is then sent to the tannery where the skins undergo a series of processes designed to preserve and soften the hides. Sewing materials such as thread, lining, seam tape, buttons, snaps and zippers are generally bought from outside vendors and stored in the garment factory. Popularity Queen Rania of Jordan in a leather jacket at the 2010 World Economic Forum In the latter half of the 20th century, the leather jacket‚Äîin many forms‚Äîachieved iconic status and general acceptance through an inextricable link to Hollywood. Such jackets were popularized by numerous stars in the 1940s and 1950s, including actor Jimmy Stewart in the film Night Passage (1957), who had actually commanded a U.S. bomber squadron during World War II. The brown leather jacket has become a de rigueur part of wardrobe for the Hollywood adventurer, from Gary Cooper in For Whom the Bell Tolls to Harrison Ford in the Indiana Jones film series. A leather jacket could be used to shape a character, providing an important ingredient used to define the very essence of 'cool'. Prime examples include the Perfecto motorcycle jacket worn by Marlon Brando's Johnny Strabler in The Wild One (1953), Honor Blackman as Cathy Gale on The Avengers, and Michael Pare in Eddie and the Cruisers duo (1983 and 1989). As such, these all served to popularize leather jackets in American youth from the \\"greaser subculture\\" of the 1950s and early 1960s. Later depictions of this subculture are seen via The Fonz from the television series Happy Days, which was produced in the 1970s and 1980s, but shows life in the 1950s and 1960s (Fonzie's leather jacket is now housed in the Smithsonian Institution), and in the film duos Eddie and the Cruisers and Grease. Flight jackets, also (occasionally with fleece collars, as seen in the film Top Gun (1986), have remained fashionable for decades. Popular culture American actor Gary Cooper wore a leather jacket in his role as an International Brigades guerrilla fighter in the Spanish Civil War in For Whom the Bell Tolls There are many more examples of iconic leather jackets worn in popular culture, such as the Schott Perfecto worn by the T-800 character of The Terminator films and the longer ¬æ length trench coat style worn by action heroes such as Steven Seagal, and Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne in The Matrix films, or by Richard Gibson as Herr Otto Flick on the television sitcom 'Allo 'Allo!. Another example is the leather jackets worn by Brad Pitt in Fight Club, where the antagonist Tyler Durden constantly appears with different variations of his red leather jacket. Other famous leather jacket icons include those worn by members of the Black Panthers in the 1960s and 1970s, the Ramones which made it a trend in the punk subculture, members of heavy metal subcultures, etc. In most popular culture examples, the jackets are worn by people cultivating an intimidating and potentially violent or rebellious image. The tan leather jacket in particular has become very popular with the Brit Pop and Indie music image and culture and is famously worn by people such as Kelly Jones of the Stereophonics. The Punk culture also \\"rocks\\" the leather jacket with accessories such as chains, studs, cuts, and sketch designs. Many \\"Metal Heads\\" go with the Judas Priest look (black leather jacket, black leather pants, chains, and many metal studs). As safety gear There is a substantial difference between leather jackets made for fashion purposes, and those worn for protection, such as motorcycle personal protective equipment. Leather jackets designed for protective use are safety equipment and are heavier, thicker, and sometimes even equipped with armor, thus they are a practical item of clothing regardless of the symbolism invested in them by popular culture. A leather jacket primarily designed for fashion purposes would not be much protection in a motorcycle accident because of the jacket's flimsy construction. Motorcycle jackets often have more substantial zips, weatherproof pockets and closures, higher collars, and are styled to be longer at the back than the front to protect the kidneys of the riders from the cold while the rider is bent forward over the motorcycle.

Biography Benjamin was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Frank David Benjamin. In 1908 the family moved to England. Benjamin was a cadet at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Royal Engineers on 17 July 1919. He was promoted to lieutenant on 17 July 1921, and served as an adjutant from 3 October 1922 until 23 September 1923. On 24 May 1927 he was appointed adjutant to the Divisional Engineers of the 49th (West Riding) Division, Territorial Army, with the temporary rank of captain (with pay and allowances of a lieutenant). He was promoted to captain on 17 July 1930, and left 49th Division on 23 November 1931. On 10 January 1936 Benjamin was appointed a General staff Officer, 3rd Grade in Malaya serving until 11 January 1939, by which time he has been promoted to major. On 8 July 1943 he received a mention in despatches in recognition of his \\"gallant and distinguished services\\" in the Madagascar campaign of 1942. By then he was serving on the staff at Middle East Command, first as Assistant Quartermaster- General, then as Deputy Director of Military Training. In September 1944 Benjamin was appointed commanding officer of the Jewish Brigade, a 5,000-man volunteer brigade group, overseeing its training in Egypt, and eventual deployment to the Eighth Army in Italy, seeing action in the crossing of the Senio river in north-east Italy in March and April 1945. Following V-E Day, 8 May 1945, the Jewish Brigade was sent to Tarvisio on the Italian-Austrian- Yugoslav border, where Benjamin was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 June 1945, backdated to 13 May. In July 1945 the brigade was sent to the Netherlands, and then to Belgium, as part of VIII Corps. On 13 December 1945 Benjamin was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. The Jewish Brigade was eventually disbanded in June 1946. On 13 May 1948, he completed his tenure as a regimental lieutenant colonel, but remained on full pay as a supernumery officer. He retired from the Army on 4 September 1950, having exceeded the age limit, and was granted the honorary rank of brigadier.

Formerly lumped with the little bittern, it is one of the smallest herons in the world. Taxonomy The bittern has sometimes been regarded as a subspecies of the little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), or of the New Zealand little bittern (I. novaezelandiae). However, molecular evidence has shown it to be more closely related to the yellow bittern (I. sinensis) than to the African and Palaearctic forms of the little bittern, and it is now recognised as a full species. , p.108. Description This species measures from , has a total weight of , averaging . This is a very small bittern and one of the smallest herons in the world. The adult male has largely black upperparts, including a black cap, while the underparts, as well as the neck, breast and the sides of the head, are rich chestnut. There are large buff patches on the shoulders, conspicuous in flight. The female is duller, brown and streaked on back and crown; immature birds are similar. The irides are yellow, the bill is yellow with a black culmen, and the feet and legs greenish-yellow. Distribution and movements=Australia In Australia the bittern is found in the south-east of the continent, with most records deriving from the Murray-Darling Basin, as well as patchily along the east coast, and in south- west Western Australia where it is locally common on the Swan Coastal Plain. Some scattered records are given from elsewhere, including coastal locations in the Kimberley region, the Top End, and the Torres Strait islands, with vagrants occasionally reaching Lord Howe Island and New Zealand. Apart from records of vagrants, circumstantial evidence that at least part of the population makes long-distance seasonal migrations is that most sightings, and the highest reporting rates, of the bitterns in southern Australia occur in spring and summer, with the birds largely absent in autumn and winter. There are few breeding records from the Australian tropics. New Guinea In New Guinea the bittern is found seasonally in the reed beds of the Waigani Swamp near Port Moresby from November to April, only being reliably recorded elsewhere on the island from the lowlands of the Trans-Fly region. No firm breeding records are from New Guinea, though a specimen taken in the middle Fly River lagoons was of a bird ready to lay, indicating breeding in the Fly River marshes in September. The lack of good breeding records suggests that at least some birds in New Guinea are seasonal migrants from Australia. New Caledonia The bittern was sighted in New Caledonia in 2001, where it bred. Habitat The birds are mainly found in freshwater wetlands, where they inhabit dense emergent vegetation of reeds and sedges, and inundated shrub thickets. They are also occasionally found in brackish and saline wetlands such as mangrove swamps, Juncus-dominated salt marsh and the wooded margins of coastal lagoons. Behaviour Black-backed bitterns are solitary, secretive and seldom seen, mainly active at dusk or at night. They are skulkers of reed beds, walking in a crouched posture with head extended forward, crossing patches of open ground rapidly, stalking their prey at the water's edge. When alarmed they will assume the cryptic posture typical of many bitterns, standing still with the head and bill extended vertically upwards. Usually reluctant to fly, when flushed they will do so with retracted head and dangling legs, skimming low over the water and the wetland vegetation. , pp.1039-1044. Breeding The bitterns breed in spring and early summer, nesting in single pairs, or occasionally in loose colonies with the nests 15‚Äì30 m apart, in dense wetland vegetation. The nest is a platform of reeds and other plant matter, about 15‚Äì20 cm across and 10 cm thick, supported by the vertical stems of growing reeds, always situated over water and where there is overhead cover. The clutch usually comprises four to six matt white eggs, with an incubation period of about 21 days. The chicks are covered with orange-buff down and are fed by regurgitation by both parents. Young birds may start clambering in the reeds from 9‚Äì10 days old, taking their first flight when 25‚Äì30 days old, and remaining dependent on their parents for at least another 14 days. Feeding The birds feed mainly on aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans and dragonfly larvae, sometimes small vertebrates such as fish and frogs. They hunt by waiting for potential prey animals to come within range of their bills, or by active stalking. Voice Vocalisations of the bittern are poorly known. Outside the breeding season the birds are usually silent, though they may utter a small range of low croaking or grunting sounds. During the breeding season the advertising call, a deep, low and monotonous croaking call, repeated at half-second intervals and said to be made only by the males, may be heard. Status and conservation Black-backed bitterns are listed as Near Threatened nationally in Australia, and as Endangered in Victoria. The global population has been estimated to comprise about 5000 mature individuals, mainly within Australia, including a sub- population of more than 1000 individuals in south-western Western Australia. Threats include various ongoing wetland degradation factors such as salinisation, drainage and the diversion of water for irrigation, as well as the destruction of nesting habitat by inappropriate burning regimens..

Blome Granitoid Pavement is a historic road surface, as well as the associated cut sandstone curbs in a few sections, found in three of the oldest residential sections of Grand Forks, North Dakota. It is a Portland cement‚Äìaggregate combination that was intended to bridge the gap between the needs of Horse-drawn vehicles, which required sure footing, and automobiles, which needed a hard, resilient surface, in the earliest part of the 20th century. R.S. Blome Granitoid was made from a mixture of Portland cement and angular granite chips along with other stone and sand, laid down over an appropriately arched prepared road bed followed by a six-inch layer of loose gravel (macadam). It was laid in five-foot sections which were sealed at the joints with an asphalt and rubber mix to allow for expansion. Another intended benefit of laying the pavement in these sections was that it allowed for removal of only necessary portions for utility work. However it would appear that this intention was ignored as indicated by the presence of utility cuts and mismatched concrete and asphalt patching in the Grand Forks examples. Over these sections was laid a two-inch finish layer of Portland cement and carefully screened angular granite chips measuring between 1/8 and 3/8 of an inch. Angular chips of granite were specified over rounded river gravel to ensure a firm bond and prohibit the dislodging of gravel common to concrete. As the surface dried it was brushed and scored to resemble cut stone, providing a good non-slip surface for horses. Though the Blome Company patent specified a gridded pattern of scoring, the Grand Forks pavement exhibits a running bond pattern. Also surviving are a number of bronze name plates embedded into the paving surface which read \\"Established 1888. GRANITOID. R.S. Blome. Chicago. 1907.\\" This pavement type was selected after a lively discussion by city residents as a solution to the problem of ankle-deep mud which was an annual result of the spring thaw and rains. The residents determined to have a quality pavement that would last long \\"after it was paid for\\". Their choice has been validated as the Granitoid is still quite serviceable and well suited to modern automobile traffic after nearly a century of use. Out of several extant locations where Blome Granitoid has been found, such as Duluth, Minnesota, Calumet, Michigan and Spokane and Seattle, Washington, there are several characteristics which make the Grand Forks sections particularly significant. There is more surviving Granitoid and the associated brass name plates in Grand Forks, encompassing a number of streets in three distinct neighborhoods, than in any of the other locations. Another important difference is the aforementioned use of the running bond pattern in the scoring, which is unique among all of the remaining examples. It suggests a desire among the residents for an aesthetic, as well as functional, pavement. A area was listed on the National Register in 1991. However, the listing was modified in 2010 to decrease the listed area. A section of R.S. Blome Granitoid pavement located on Chestnut St, Grand Forks, North Dakota.

The ship is now the most prominent of several wrecks on what is now the Stockton breakwall, which protects Newcastle harbour. The rescue of the ship's crew has gone down in local maritime history as one of the most remarkable in local waters.  Ship description and construction  Adolphe was a four-masted steel barque built in 1902 by Chantiers de France, Dunkerque. It was rigged with double top and topgallant sails.  Shipwreck event  On 30 September 1904, the Adolphe was being towed through the entrance of Newcastle harbour by the tugs Hero and Victoria after an 85-day voyage in ballast from Antwerp under the command of Captain Lucas. Heavy seas prevented the tugs from holding her, and after the tug hawser parted she was swept first on to the wreck of the Colonist, then battered by waves that forced her on top of other submerged wrecks on what was then called the Oyster Bank. The lifeboat hurried to the scene and within two hours all 32 of the crew had been taken off. The northern breakwater of the entrance to the port of Newcastle was extended after the loss of the Adolphe. The French consul made an official visit to Newcastle to recognise the efforts of the lifeboat crew. When the breakwater was extended in 1906 and reached the remains of the Adolphe, her remaining two masts and jib-boom were removed for safety reasons.

It was found in the skin shed from frilled lizard. This fungus is mesophilic and digests hair. It reproduces both sexually and asexually. The fungus has so far not been reported to be pathogenic. Growth and reproduction Colonies of C. punctatus are yellow in the center and relatively flat surface at the pale peripherals with a central bump. This fungus is mesophile and grows at , but does not grow above . This fungus also shows digestion of hairs after 14 days in vitro. The keratinolytic, or keratin-digesting, capability is one of the characteristics of Onygenaceae. It is also cycloheximide resistant. C. punctatus can reproduce both in sexual and asexual forms. The teleomorph phase is gymnothecial and arises through a homothallic mating system. Ascomata of this species are round, 200‚Äì600 Œºm in diameter containing asci 7‚Äì9 (10) Œºm in length. Ascospores are yellow, 4‚Äì4.5 √ó 3‚Äì3.5 Œºm in diameter. The ascospores look like pitted smarties or pulley wheels, which is characteristics of Onygenaceae. Chlamydosauromyces punctatus has branched, narrow, smooth-walled, yellow hyphae, 1.5‚Äì2.5 Œºm in width with thin-walled septa. Peripheral hyphae are poorly differentiated and this is the reason that C. punctatus was once considered in the Gymnoascaceae. Ascomata lack elongate appendages. The cells initiating anastomosis are slightly swollen. Taxonomy Chlamydosauromyces is a monotypic genus, which has only single species in the family, Onygenaceae. However, it was initially thought to be affiliated with the family Gymnoascaceae because it possesses ascospores with equatorial grooves, a common feature of the Gymnoascaceae not normally found in the Onygenaceae. hypha As well, hyphae of this species are sparsely differentiated similar to those of the genus Arachniotus (Gymnoascaceae). Molecular genetic analyses demonstrated the affiliation of this fungus to the Onygenaceae. The genus Chlamydosauromyces was named after the frilled lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingii and the species epithet 'punctatus' was selected in reference to the pitted ornamentation of the ascospores. The name Chlamydosauromyces punctatus is a Latin masculine name. Small subunit (SSU) region in the nuclear ribosomal gene of C. punctatus is 1,738 nucleotides in length. Phylogenic study based on the sequence have shown Renispora flavissima to be the closest related taxon. Both are treated within the Ongenaceae and share similar characteristics such as the yellow color, thin walls, narrow ascomata, and ascospores with pitted walls. Even though these two species are the most closely related to each other, the bootstrap value was low (78%), indicating that the phylogenic similarity is not particularly high. In addition to the phylogenic distance, there are notable morphological differences between the genus Chlamydosauromyces and Renispora. the hyphae of Chlamydosauromyces are subhyaline whereas those of Renispora are hyaline or translucent. Moreover, Renispora has liver-shaped ascospores, but ascospores of Chlamydosauromyces look like pulley wheels. In addition to the morphological differences between two species of fungi, the conidia of the Chrysosporium anamorph of Renispora are large with spiny tubercules and formed on stalks whereas Chlamydosauromyces produces an asexual state characterized by alternate arthroconidia. Ecology Chlamydosauromyces punctatus was first found in the putatively healthy Squamate reptiles free of cutaneous lesions. The fungus was first isolated in 2001 from the shed skin of a 7-year-old healthy male frilled lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingii, from the San Diego Zoo (the lizard typically lives in trees found in the northern part of the Australia). Among samples of three different Squamate reptiles donated by the Zoo, the skin samples of two of the reptile species did not show any evidence of invasion by the fungus. The ex-type strain of C. punctatus is in depository at UAMH 9990. Though unique to reptiles, this species is distinct from the commonly associated fungal pathogens of reptiles. C. punctatus is associated with the shed skin of healthy lizards free of lesions or symptoms.

First classified in the Onygenaceae family, as of 2008 it is considered to be in the Ajellomycetaceae, although there is still uncertainty as to its phylogenetic relationships with other similar genera. This species is only known from a single specimen derived in the laboratory from a specimen of dung of the North American porcupine, Erethizon dorsatum, collected in Ontario, Canada. Polytolypa hystricis contains bioactive compounds that have antifungal activity. Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming Polytolypa hystricis was initially grown from the dung of the North American porcupine, Erethizon dorsatum (pictured).The genus was first described in 1993 by University of Toronto mycologists J.A. Scott and D.W. Malloch, who grew the fungus in moist chamber cultures of porcupine dung collected in Stoneleigh, Ontario, Canada. The generic name Polytolypa is from the Greek word poly (œÄŒøŒªœÖ) meaning \\"many\\", and tolype (œÑŒøŒªœÖœÄŒ∑), meaning \\"skein of yarn\\". The specific epithet hystricis comes from the Greek hystrix (œÖœÉœÑœÅŒπŒæ), or \\"porcupine\\". The genus has been classified in the Onygenaceae, a fungal family characterized by species capable of digesting human hair in vitro, and with spores that are punctate (with minute surface punctures) when viewed with scanning electron microscopy. However, as Scott and colleagues demonstrated using traditional laboratory tests to determine keratinolytic activity, P. hystricus is not able to digest hair. There is still uncertainty as to its phylogenetic relationships with other similar genera. Polytolypa is thought to be evolutionarily most closely related to the genera Malbranchea and Spiromastix. The grouping of Polytolypa and Spiromastix represent a sister clade to the Ajellomyces clade, based on analysis of partial nuclear LSU sequence data. However, the phylogenetics of Polytolypa are still unclear and await further study. The 10th edition of the Dictionary of the Fungi (2008) considers the genus to be in the Ajellomycetaceae family, although uncertainty with this classification is indicated in the entry; in contrast, the online mycological database MycoBank classifies the genus in the Onygenaceae. Description The ascus-containing reproductive structures, or ascomata, are minute, spherical bodies, typically 200‚Äì400 Œºm in diameter. They start out white, but gradually become rusty brown in maturity. The ascomata, which may be clustered together in groups or scattered about, grow in a shallow layer of \\"hairs\\" (actually fungal mycelia) called a tomentum. The ascomata have \\"appendages\\" composed of numerous coiled, sometimes branched helices of hyphae that are coiled 3‚Äì15 times. The ascospores produced by Polytolypa are ellipsoidal, yellow to yellow-orange in color, with dimensions of 2.5‚Äì5 by 3‚Äì4 Œºm. Viewed with a light microscope their surfaces appear to be smooth, but under scanning electron microscopy, they are revealed to be densely marked with punctures and small, hard, sharp projections. The structures that produce the ascospores are called asci. In Polytolypa they are numerous, spherical, and measure 9‚Äì10 by 12‚Äì13 Œºm. Each ascus contains eight ascospores, which are released when the ascus dissolves away at maturity. The anamorph (asexual form of the fungus) resembles the genus Chrysosporium. Habitat and distribution Polytolypa hystricis is known only from the dung of the North American porcupine, Erethizon dorsatum. Porcupine dens accumulate thick layers of nutrient-rich dung, hair and urine that are degraded by a succession of fungi. These fungi are disseminated by arthropods (such as insects) or by the porcupine themselves. Bioactive compounds Chemical analysis has shown that Polytolypa hystricis contains a unique triterpenoid chemical named polytolypin, as well two compounds known previously as metabolites from Scleroderris Canker (Gremmeniella abietina). Both polytolypin and one of the previously identified compounds have \\"moderate\\" antifungal activity against the species Ascobolus furfuraceous, while polytopin alone can inhibit the growth of Candida albicans.

He was convicted and sentenced to transportation to Australia for his actions during the Rebecca Riots. Early life Davies was born in the parish of Llancarfan in about 1812 to John and Mary Davies, his father is believed to have been a tenant of the Duke of Beaufort. Although little of his early personal life is known, in later police records Davies is recorded as a \\"farm labourer, can plough\\", and at one time is thought to have worked at a quarry in Newcastle, Bridgend, also serving as a preacher to the local Wesleyians. He is later recorded as attending the Philadelphia Baptist Church in Cadoxton near Barry, one of the earliest Baptist chapels in the area, from which the important Baptist preacher, Christmas Evans is believed to have given sermons.History of Barry barrywales.co.uk Davies was nicknamed \\"Dai'r Cantwr\\", David the Singer, because he \\"taught them to sing at church\\". Davies' role in the Rebecca Riots On 13 May 1839, the first tollgate was attacked by rioters at Cilymaenllwyd, in an uprising by poor farmers, angry at what they believed were unjust taxations.Davies (2008), pg730. By 26 May, the first phase of the Rebecca Riots ended with the destruction of the Water Street gate in Carmarthen. On 17 July of that year, the first instance is recorded of a group of rioters being led by a male ring leader dressed in women's clothing,Davies (2008), pg144. widely accepted to be Thomas Rees. The dressing of the mob leaders as women was a symbolic gesture, in reference to a Biblical text, Genesis 24:60.Rebecca Riots nationalarchives.gov.uk At some point during the riots, until their end in late 1843, Davies became heavily involved, and like fellow rioter Shoni Sguborfawr, was paid to take a prominent role in the toll- gate attacks. Although there are various theories of how the two men met, Davies and 'Shoni' became associated in several acts of incendiarism and gate- breaking. The riots were initially supported by the public, and very few rioters were arrested and convicted, but some of those taking part used the guise of 'Rebecca' to exact revenge on individuals and extort money; and Davies and 'Shoni' both undertook these actions.The Pontardulais affair south- wales.police.uk Eventually people turned on both men and on 24 September 1843, warrants were issued for their arrest. The following day Davies was arrested at the 'Plough and Harrow' a public house in Pum Heol near Llanelli.Statement by William Francis on the arrest of 'Dai'r Cantwr' and 'Shoni Sguborfawr' Gathering the Jewels, Welsh history site Shoni Sguborfawr was arrested in London on 26 September. Davies was placed in custody in Carmarthen Goal to await sentence. Transportation to Australia and later life On 22 December 1843 Davies was tried at Carmarthen assizes under the charge of demolishing the turnpike at Spudder's Bridge near Kidwelly. Davies was found guilty and was sentenced to transportation for 20 years; 'Shoni' was given a life sentence for attempted murder after shooting a man in Pontyberem. After sentencing, Davies was held at Carmarthen, and while awaiting transportation he wrote the poem now known as the Threnody of Dai'r Cantwr, described by Professor David Williams as 'not without literary merits'. On 5 February 1844 he was moved to the Millbank Penitentiary and remained there until 12 March when he was transported on the London to Van Diemen's Land, modern-day Tasmania. He landed on 10 July and was set to work on Maria Island, just off the country's east coast. After completing his work on the Island, he was placed in the employment of various people, but was unable to stay out of trouble, receiving brief sentences for minor offences, such as insolence, drunkenness and using indecent language. Davies received his ticket of leave in April 1854, and was conditionally pardoned on 31 October of the same year. Although some claimed he returned to Wales, he seems to have remained in Tasmania, and died there in an outhouse of the Ross Hotel in August 1874, from smoke inhalation after his pipe accidentally set fire to grass, whilst Davies was asleep and intoxicated.

The Sultanate of Langkat was a Malay Muslim state located in modern Langkat Regency, North Sumatra. It predates Islam in the region, but no historical records before the 17th century survive. It prospered with the opening of rubber plantations and the discovery of oil in Pangkalan Brandan.  Early history  In approximately 1568, a military commander from the Kingdom of Aru set up a kingdom which was the forerunner of the modern Langkat Sultanate. However, the first sultan was Sri Paduka Tuanku Sultan al-Haj Musa al-Khalid al-Mahadiah Mu‚Äôazzam Shah, known as Sultan Musa, who was awarded the title of sultan in 1887 by the Dutch monarch, as were the rulers of Deli, Serdang and Asahan as a token of gratitude for their services to the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch colonial authorities were able to use the Malay sultans to indirectly control eastern Sumatra. These sultans signed political contracts with the Dutch, and as part of their nominal authority over land use, personally received royalties for each land concession they granted allowing foreign interests to control tobacco estates. They also were granted control over their Malay subjects and guaranteed security of their sultanates. Cooperation with the Dutch colonial authorities The cooperative relationship with the Dutch made all the sultans enormously wealthy. As well as tobacco, contracts were also signed for oil exploitation, and by 1915, 37.9 percent of the income of the Langkat Sultanate passed directly to Sultan Abdul Aziz Abdul Jalil Rahmad Shah, the son of Sultan Musa, who had inherited the throne in 1893. Abdul Aziz also built the huge Azizi Mosque in Tanjung Pura, seat of the sultanate, and established a religious education centre. Abdul Aziz was in turn succeeded by his son, Sultan Mahmud Abdul Jalil Rahmad Shah, whose wealth grew in parallel with the income from various concessions and royalties, particularly following the discovery of oil in Pangkalan Brandan. He became the richest of the Sumatra Malay sultans, and by 1933 owned 13 limousines, racehorses and a boat that he never used. The ethnic Malay subjects of the sultan - 18.57 percent of the population in 1930, each received 4 hectares - later reduced to 2.8 hectares - for farming. Despite this huge income, by the end of 1934 the extravagant lifestyle of Sultan Mahmud had resulted in his accumulating a huge debt. As a result, the Dutch took control of the finances of the East Sumatran sultans, arranging loans to pay of the debts, and leaving the sultans with monthly allowances. The cooperation with the Dutch extended to political activities, including the banning of the popular nationalist Partindo party in 1933 and the recall in 1935 of the sultan's nephew Amir Hamzah from his studies in Batavia because he had become too involved in the Indonesian independence movement. Amir Hamzah subsequently married the sultan's daughter, Kamailia. The end of the sultanate The sultanate fell as a result of the social revolution of March 1946, a movement against what were seen as feudal and pro-Dutch aristocracies. The Sultanate of Langkat was declared abolished on 5 March. On 9 March, the palace was seized, seven aristocrats were killed and the sultan was handed over the republican authorities. He was released in July 1947 by Dutch forces who had launched a military offensive against the Republic of Indonesia.

Biography=Early life and education Reed was born in 1978 in Townsend, Montana, to Ernie and Florence Reed, the youngest of Florence's nine children. After her parents separated in the early 1990s, Reed moved with her mother to Mountlake Terrace, Washington. Reed dropped out of Mountlake Terrace High School in 1995; three years later, her mother died of colon cancer.http://www.sabrinaerdely.com/docs/IvyLeague.pdf Missing person In October 1999, Reed pled guilty in King County, Washington to attempted possession of stolen property. Shortly after, Reed disappeared and her family didn't hear from her again. She was reported missing in 2004 by her father after social security checks revealed she was alive. While Reed was missing, she assumed the identities of other people. Reed's situation is unusual because, unlike most identity thieves, she didn't use the identities to run up credit card debt. Instead, she used the fictitious names to obtain an education and start a new life. In 2001, Reed assumed the identity of Natalie Bowman and enrolled as an adjunct student at California State University in Fullerton, California. While at Fullerton, Reed joined CSUF's debate team and competed in several tournaments, often advancing to the final round. At CSUF, Reed became friends with several debaters at the United States Military Academy at West Point and at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. She dated one of the cadets for an extended period of time. Eventually the US Army Criminal Investigation Command investigated Reed, believing she might have been involved in espionage; the investigators determined these suspicions were unfounded. In 2003, Reed moved on and earned her GED, using the identity of Brooke Henson, another missing person from Travelers Rest, South Carolina. Reed also took the SAT and achieved a score of 1400. Using her new credentials, Reed applied to Columbia University, School of General Studies, and was admitted to the university. She attended Columbia for two years, where she majored in psychology and had a 3.22 GPA. In 2006, after an internet search by an employer revealed Brooke Henson's real identity, police in South Carolina alerted New York City police to Reed. After agreeing to give DNA to prove she was indeed Brooke Henson, Esther Reed fled New York City. She relocated to Chicago and changed her identity to Jennifer Myers. Reed was featured on the United States Secret Service's 10-most-wanted fugitive list and America's Most Wanted on the Fox Television Network. She was featured twice in 48 Hours Mystery episodes on CBS: the first, Capture the Queen, aired in 2007, and the second, Catch Her If You Can, aired in 2009. Capture On February 3, 2008, in Tinley Park, Illinois, Reed was captured by Tinley Park Police who were searching the entire area for a gunman who shot and killed five women at a Lane Bryant store. The police were checking all out-of-state license plates in the area. Reed's car was in a Sleep Inn motel parking lot in the area. Federal marshals and police knocked on her motel door and asked her for her ID. The authorities noticed that the ID she handed them had been flagged by the Secret Service, so she was transported to the police station for questioning, where she confirmed her real name. Conviction Federal Prison Camp, Alderson After being found by the police, Reed was extradited to South Carolina, where she was tried on four felony charges related to fraud and identity theft. Facing up to 47 years in prison, she pled guilty. At her sentencing, Reed's attorney argued that her behavior was the result of mental health issues stemming from the death of her mother and severe social anxiety. The lawyer said that Reed began to experience social phobia during her freshman year of high school, that her difficulties were mitigated by the presence of her mother, and that once she lost her mother's support, Reed's life began to unravel. Reed was sentenced to 51 months in prison and was released from federal prison on October 27, 2011.\\"Esther Elizabet Reed.\\" Federal Bureau of Prisons. Retrieved on October 30, 2011.

(NASA photo). Fagaloa is located on the north eastern coast of Upolu island in Samoa. The area is a significant region of conservation and culture. The bay is situated within the political district of Va'a-o-Fonoti and is ruled by the Ulualofaiga Talamaivao, descendants of the first Ulualofaiga, son of the King of Tonga, Tui Toga Faisautele.  History  The distinctive features of the Fagaloa area portrays some of the most interesting myths and legends in Samoan mythology which are considered invaluable and relevant to the peoples' cultural lifestyle.  Ulualofaiga comes to Samoa  The King of Tonga, the Tui Toga (Tu'i Tonga in Tongan), took Sinavaituu, daughter of Tuifiti and Sinasamoa, to wife. They begot Tuitoga-Faisautele. Faisautele married Painuulasi and begot Ulualofaiga and a girl named Vaetoifaga. Utufanu-nutunutu who was an adherent of the High Chief and sovereign of A'ana (Tui A'ana) Tamalelagi went to Tonga and induced Vaetoifaga to come to Samoa. He told her that Samoa, her mother's home, was a very beautiful country and different to anything that she had seen. He told her of the wonderful Vai-mata-iva (water pool with nine eyes.) and of the magnetic stone which rises in the water and scrubs the dirt off ones back when bathing. He also told her of the wonderful trees that stood on the banks of this pool and moved as if dancing. Vaitoifaga was captivated by these false stories and came to Samoe. The real reason for bringing her to Samoa was to marry her to Tui A'ana Tamalelagi. When she discovered her position she said she would not agree to marry Tui A'ana without the consent of her brother Ulualofaiga who was in Tonga. When Tui A'ana was convinced that she was determined to adhere to her decision he offered to give to her brother the villages of Vaialua and Nofoalii and down as far as Matatao if she would consent to be his wife. She agreed to these terms and was married. She gave birth to Salamasina who was proclaimed queen of Aana after her father's death. Ulualofaiga came to Samoa in search of his sister and brought with him one hundred war canoes manned by the slaves of his father Tuitogafaisautele. He arrived at Afagaloa in Savai'i and this town was the home of Sinaletinae. He learned that his sister had become the wife of Tamalelagi and he sailed to Aana to find her. His sister went out into the lagoon at Aana to welcome him and to hand over to him the villages that had been given to him by Tui A'ana. She begged him not to start fighting on her behalf as she was about to become a mother. He agreed and landed with his men and took possession of the villages. The reunion of Ulualofaiga and Vaetoifaga was referred to as ‚ÄúSootaga mai‚Äù which means reconoilliation as the result of pregnancy. After remaining in Aana for some time, Ulualofaiga proceeded to Fagaloa the home of his ancestors. On his way there he had many fights with opposing districts and he always fought from the gatai ala which means the sea side of the road and was always successful. These victories gave rise to the phrase which is used in all districts ‚ÄúTulouna a le gatai ala‚Äù (meaning ‚Äúcompliments to the party on the seaward side of the road). Ulualofaiga finally reached Fagaloa and there he established his domain.  The War of Fonoti  During the war against Samalaulu for the Kingship of Samoa, Fonoti sought the assistance of Ulualofaiga's war fleet. Having defeated Samaluulu and made King of Samoa, King Fonoti ruled from his residence in neighbouring Falefa. In return for the services rendered, King Fonoti granted Ulualofaiga autonomous rulership over the Fagaloa District as well as giving him the village of Amanave in Tutuila. Among the many titles the King gave to those who helped him, he also gave Faleapuna and Fagaloa the title 'Vaa-o-Fonoti' (Fonoti's War Canoe) in recognition of their skilled naval fleets who bested the formidable Manono fleet at sea. These titles and salutations distinguishes the district down to the present day.  Geography  The geographic area consists of a mountain formation rising out of the sea. At the base of the bay lies the village Ta'elefaga at the mouth of the Malata river. To the east above the villages of Lona and Uafato are several waterfalls by mountain forests. On the western side is Mount Fao with spurs dissolving seaward into cliffs called Utuloa. Further east lies Uafato Bay at the eastern base of Malata river which displays spectacular landscape of lush rainforest and waterfalls. Villages Situated at Fagaloa Bay are the villages of Sauano, Saletele, Musumusu, Salimu, Ta'elefaga, Maasina, Lona, Samamea and Uafato.

History The defeat suffered by Hern√°n Cort√©s in the battle of the Noche Triste led to a hurried escape of the survivors up to Naucalpan. Along the way they suffered the loss of many soldiers and native allies as well as notable hostages, such as some children of Moctezuma. The Spanish sheltered and recovered in the Indian temples until they could turn to fight the Aztecs at the Battle of Otumba. Legend tells that one of Cort√©s's soldiers, Gonzalo Rodriguez de Villafuerte, had with him one of the little religious images known as castrenses, and he hid it among the aloes in order to carry out a devotional action of thankfulness. The legend tells that during the battle, a young girl threw dirt in the eyes of the attacking natives helping to seal the Spanish victory.

This archeological structure consists of several superimposed pyramids, accumulated over six centuries. The base is on each side and high, twice as large as that of the Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacan and four times bigger in volume than that of Keops in Egypt. In the early 1930s, knowledge about the Great Pyramid was scarce. Exploration began in 1931 under the direction of the architect Ignacio Marquina. After 25 years, eight kilometers of tunnels had been excavated, enabling the discovery of the seven superimposed pyramids. (In the second one the Mural of the Butterflies was discovered, and in an attached building they found the Mural of the Drinkers, depicting more than a hundred human figures in a ceremony in honor of Octli, the god of pulque.) Decoration The main altar The basilica was constructed with brada stone and decorated with 24 carat gold leaf laminilla. The altar is in the neoclassic style, as is the rest of the decoration. In 1595, the painter Alfonso de Villasana crafted the pictures on the walls of the basilica.

It arrived on Mexican soil in 1519 with Captain Juan Rodr√≠guez de Villafuerte, who brought it from the Basque Country, Spain, to protect him during the campaign. Various versions exist of a legend about its prior history and origins as far back as 700 AD. It was in Veracruz where Rodr√≠guez de Villafuerte presided at the first mass celebrated in Mexico, on April 21, 1519, the same year as Hern√°n Cort√©s's mandate was affirmed by the Spanish in the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan. In 1520, when the Spanish under Cort√©s were defeated by the Aztecs while fleeing by way of Naucalpan, de Villafuerte concealed the image in a native temple on the highest part of the hill of Otocampulco. Twenty years later, indigenous people discovered it there under an aloe plant, and from then on, the virgin was kept in the house of the chief of San Juan Totoltepec, until he built a chapel. On the map of Santa Cruz, this chapel is shown with the name of Our Lady of Victory. Since 1594, the church has been dedicated to Our Lady of Remedies.

Geography  The Barnacken is located about 3 km (as the crow flies) southwest of Horn, part of the town of Horn-Bad Meinberg, and northwest of the Silberbach stream, which runs in a valley in a southwest to northeast direction through Veldrom to Leopoldstal, and the transition between the Teutoburg Forest and the Eggegebirge hills. Its north- northeastern spur is the Kleine Rigi (387.7 m), its eastern subpeak, the Kartoffelberg (ca. 385 m) and its western spur, the Mordkopf (408.6 m); they belong to Horn-Bad Meinberg. Its southern spur is the Padberg (437.5 m) which belongs to Schlangen. The river Strothe rises on the Barnacken, near the B 1 federal road, and flows in a southwesterly direction alongside the B1 from Horn-Bad Meinberg in the northeast to Schlangen in the southwest and which continues as the Thune before discharging into the river Lippe.  Weser-Ems watershed  The most southeasterly point of the Weser-Ems watershed is located on the Barnacken. All streams that rise in the Teutoburg Forest further to the northwest of this hill and flow westwards discharge, sooner or later, into the river Ems. By contrast, the streams and rivers that flow from here northwards and eastwards join the Weser at some point. It should also be mentioned here that all streams that rise south of the Barnacken and flow towards the southwest, eventually enter the Lippe, which ultimately flows into the Rhine.

The society publishes a semi-annual journal, American Communist History, produced by the British academic publisher Routledge. The organization also maintains an internet newsgroup on H-Net. Organizational history=Formation In March 1982, historian Lowell Dyson invited scholars interested in the history of the American Communist Party (CPUSA) to attend an organizational meeting held in conjunction with the 1982 Convention of the Organization of American Historians in Philadelphia. This meeting was held on April 2, 1982, with Dyson occupying the chair. Dyson noted that a chance meeting of several historians interested in various aspects of American Communism in which he participated at the 1980 Upper Midwest History Conference in Duluth, Minnesota had yielded productive discussion and he suggested that a new national organization of individuals interested in such matters might provide a forum for a mutually beneficial exchange of ideas. The small circle who had participated in the informal 1980 conclave had constituted themselves a General Organizing Board for such a new group, an organization tentatively called \\"The John Reed Club.\\"John Earl Haynes, \\"To The Reader,\\" Newsletter of Historians of American Communism, vol. 1, no. 1 (June 1982), pg. 1. The organizers envisioned a society which would help interested scholars make contact with one another to exchange in academic discourse. The group would additionally publish information about research in progress, it was hoped, as well as aid in the search for obscure sources ‚Äî no simple task in the days before easily searchable library catalogs via the internet. Further, organizers sought a place to where one might take esoteric questions about little-known aspects of American communism and hope to find an answer. Discussion at the organizational meeting centered around the parameters of the organization, with some arguing in favor of inclusion of other radical political organizations outside of the CPUSA, while others sought a more limited and tightly focused orientation. It was decided that a concentration upon the history of the CPUSA alone would make for a more useful organization in its initial phase. As objection was raised to the political connotation of naming the organization after John Reed, a founding member of the American Communist Party, a new name was called for. The gathering decided upon the name \\"Historians of American Communism.\\" A second meeting of the organization was called for later in 1982, to be held in conjunction with the convention of the American Historical Association (AHA) in Washington, D.C. The General Organizing Board of the new organization approved by the April 2, 1982, meeting consisted of Hyman Berman of the University of Minnesota; Lowell Dyson of Alexandria, Virginia; Max Gordon of New York City; John Earl Haynes of Washington, D.C.; Harvey Klehr of Emory University; and William Pratt of the University of Nebraska. A two-page mimeographed newsletter was published by Haynes, entitled Newsletter of the Historians of American Communism ‚Äî a publication which would continue uninterrupted through the summer of 2004.The final issue, volume 23, no. 1, with John Earl Haynes still in the editorial chair, was dated July 2004. No organizational dues were set for 1982, but a $5 membership fee was levied for 1983, with proceeds to pay for production of the newsletter, projected to be a quarterly.John Earl Haynes, \\"Paying for the Newsletter,\\" Newsletter of the Historians of American Communism, vol. 1, no. 2 (October 1982), pg. 1. Development of the organization The second meeting of the Historians of American Communism was held in December 1982 in conjunction with the annual convention of the AHA. At that gathering, the General Organizing Board distributed copies of a draft constitution and bylaws for the organization. After a discussion about possible changes, the Board announced that a revised draft would be subsequently mailed out to all members after the first of the year for approval or rejection.John Earl Haynes, \\"Report on the December 1982 Meeting,\\" Newsletter of the Historians of American Communism, vol. 1, no. 3 (March 1983), pg. 1. Ballots were sent out early in March 1983, with the mail election closing on the 29th of that month.John Earl Haynes, \\"Referendum and Election of Officers,\\" Newsletter of the Historians of American Communism, vol. 1, no. 3 (March 1983), pg. 1. The draft constitution was duly approved.

Published in Newsletter of the Historians of American Communism, vol. 1, no. 3 (March 1983), pg. 1. HOAC's system of office was convoluted. The organization was to feature four officers: a President, Vice President, General Secretary, and Treasurer. Vice Presidents were to automatically succeed to the office of president in the subsequent year and were thus to be the chief competitive election. A nominating committee appointed by the President was to provide one nominee, with others added to the list by membership petition. A six-member Central Committee, elected to a three-year term, was to directly appoint the General Secretary and Treasurer, who would join the Central Committee, along with the President and Vice President and the three most recent past presidents. This Central Committee was to meet annually at a time and place determined at its pleasure.\\"Constitution of the Historians of American Communism\\", Articles IV, V, and VI. Dues were formally set at $5 per annum by the constitution, with a special life membership made available to anyone contributing $1,000 or more to the organization.\\"Bylaws of the Historians of American Communism,\\" Article I. Published in Newsletter of the Historians of American Communism, vol. 1, no. 3 (March 1983), pg. 2. This dues rate remained in effect until 1990, when dues moved to a rate of $10 per annum by decision of the HOAC Central Committee.John Earl Haynes, \\"Professional,\\" Newsletter of the Historians of American Communism, vol. 8, no. 2 (June 1989), pg. 1. Dues rose again in 2002, this time to $25 per year, due to the launch of a new academic journal, subscriptions to which were included in the cost of membership dues.John Earl Haynes, \\"Special Announcement: American Communist History: A New Journal,\\" Newsletter of the Historians of American Communism, vol. 20, no. 4 (December 2001), pg. 1. Elected as first President of the organization was Hyman Berman, with Harvey Klehr elected Vice President. The six members of the initial Central Committee were elected for staggered terms: John Haynes and Max Gordon for a three-year term, Daniel Leab and Ellen Schrecker for a two-year term, and Kenneth Waltzer and David J. Garrow for a one-year term. Thereafter, two of the six members would come up for election each year. A membership list published in September 1985 indicated that HOAC had a paid membership of 117 for that year.John Earl Haynes, \\"Membership List,\\" Newsletter of the Historians of American Communism, vol. 4, no. 3 (September 1985), pp. 2‚Äì5.

Leab continued in this position until his death in 2016. Function of the organization Throughout its first 20 years of existence, HOAC's primary function related to its compilation and publication of a listing of \\"Writings on the History of American Communism.\\" Begun by John Haynes in 1982, this task was later taken over by Peter Filardo, an archivist at Tamiment Library, located at New York University. Haynes converted this material and further additions to digital form in the 1990s, a listing which he continues to maintain on his personal website into the 21st Century.The listing stood in early 2009 at over 8,500 titles. See: http://www.johnearlhaynes.org/page94.html The organization also publicized \\"Research in Progress\\" and \\"Recent Publications and Papers by Members\\" in its quarterly newsletter. The organization also fostered the exchange of primary source materials gathered from the Federal Bureau of Investigation under the Freedom of Information Act. Publications=American Communist History journal Beginning in 2002, HOAC began the publication of a semi-annual academic journal, American Communist History. This marked a move for HOAC from its previous function of facilitating and chronicling academic publications in other venues to actually engaging in academic publication itself. American Communist History is a scholarly journal with the worthiness of submitted articles anonymously juried by recognized experts in the field prior to their acceptance for publication. Editor of the publication from its first issue through 2016 was Daniel J. Leab of Seton Hall University. At the time of the new journal's launch, HOAC Editor John Haynes defined the purpose of the new publication: > American Communist History will be the impartial, leading journal for > scholarship about the history of the Communist Party in the United States > and its social, political, economic and cultural impact on its members, on > its opponents, and the public at large. The journal will deal with the > American party and with the various outside influences which have dealt with > its representation, with the controversial folklore that has been engendered > about it, and with the many differing views about its antecedents, and its > diverse opponents on the Left and Right. While rooted in the United States, > the journal welcomes contributions which are transnational or international > in scope. HOAC newsgroup In March 2003, HOAC launched its own newsgroup via the academic newsgroup coordinator, H-Net. In the initial post announcing the new forum, co-moderator of the forum John Haynes wrote: > H-HOAC has several tasks. It will provide a forum for discussion of the > history of American communism and domestic anticommunism.

Newsletter of the Historians of American Communism The 2002 advent of American Communist History, and its regular announcement of new publications, and the H-HOAC newsgroup, and its regular announcement of research in progress and exchange of information about various esoteric research issues, made the continuation of the Newsletter of the Historians of American Communism moot.

Joining the British Army shortly before the Second World War, he initially served with the Somerset Light Infantry in India. He subsequently volunteered for the Parachute Regiment and saw action in the Italian Campaign in late 1943. After returning to the United Kingdom with the 4th Parachute Brigade, part of the 1st Airborne Division, he took part in the Battle of Arnhem, where he was wounded and taken prisoner by German troops. After the war, Waddy remained in the army and saw action in the Mandatory Palestine and during the Malayan Emergency, for which he was mentioned in dispatches. He went on to hold a series of command posts with the Parachute Regiment, both at home and overseas, and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1963. He was an early incumbent in the post of Colonel SAS and did much to expand the Special Air Service's role. He subsequently held a number of military advisor positions, most notably in Washington DC, Vietnam, and after resigning from the military, with Westland Helicopters and during the filming of the movie A Bridge Too Far. Early life John Waddy was born on 17 June 1920 in Taunton, Somerset, the son of Lieutenant Colonel Richard Henry Waddy, DSO, and his wife Llewellyn. He was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, and then as a cadet at Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Second World War=North Africa and Italy On 3 July 1939, Waddy was commissioned into the Somerset Light Infantry as a second lieutenant and sent to India two months later with the 1st Battalion, then commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Harding. After travelling from Taunton to Scotland he sailed from Britain on the same day that Britain declared war on Germany.Waddy, Audio Archive ‚Äì Joining in 1938 and being posted to the NW frontier He was promoted to acting, then temporary, captain from September 1940, and substantive lieutenant on 3 January 1941. His time in India, however, was mostly spent on exercises with little chance of action. Desperate to leave, Waddy successfully volunteered for a new British Parachute Battalion when the chance came in August 1941, and in October joined the 151st Parachute Battalion as their intelligence officer.Waddy, Audio Archive ‚Äì The formation of the 151st Parachute Battalion Parachuting was rudimentary in India and training jumps were made from Vickers Valentia biplanes.Waddy, Audio Archive ‚Äì First parachute courses in India 1941 He qualified for his jump wings on the same day that Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, although only two months later he was nearly killed in a training jump and spent three days in a coma. In October 1942 the battalion was sent to North Africa and re-designated 156th Parachute Battalion, where it became the central unit of the new 4th Parachute Brigade, formed in December. Waddy was briefly made adjutant of the battalion, but quickly moved up to the post of the 4th Brigade's intelligence officer. The brigade moved from Egypt to Palestine in February 1943, and to Tunisia in June where it joined the 1st Airborne Division, then commanded by Major General George Hopkinson. Waddy recalled that the introduction of the now-famous maroon beret was particularly unpopular with the 156th Battalion, who had previously worn bush hats.Waddy, Audio Archive ‚Äì The introduction of the Red Beret and Distinctive Airborne Helmet in 1942 The 4th Brigade did not take part in the Allied invasion of Sicily but on 5 September the whole Division sailed to Taranto in Italy (Operation Slapstick), successfully capturing the port with 156th Battalion and brigade HQ in the vanguard. The division advanced northwards over the coming weeks, slowly pursuing the 1st German Parachute Division. In one action Waddy found an Italian 179mm Howitzer which he used to disperse Germans gathering to counterattack the 156th Battalion's positions, firing through open sights at a building in the centre of their front. Waddy was promoted to acting major in October and took charge of the 156th Battalion's B Company, a month before the 1st Airborne Division was withdrawn and sailed back to the United Kingdom, arriving there in December. On 24 January 1944, he was made a war substantive captain and temporary major. Arnhem 1st Airborne Division's next deployment was in September 1944 during Operation Market Garden. The Allies planned to use airborne forces to secure key bridges over a number of rivers and canals in the Netherlands, opening a route around the Siegfried Line and into the heart of Germany.Thompson, p. 195 1st Airborne Division was tasked with securing bridges across the Lower Rhine at Arnhem and 4th Parachute Brigade was detailed to occupy the northern approaches of the city in the event of a counterattack by German forces.Waddy, A Tour of the Arnhem Battlefields, p. 42 The brigade was scheduled to arrive on the second day of the operation, 18 September, using drop zones protected by elements of 1st Airlanding Brigade.Thompson, p. 210 In the event, ground mist in England meant that the second lift was delayed by four hours,Middlebrook, p. 225 which spared the Dakota transport aircraft from meeting Luftwaffe fighters over the drop zone.Waddy, A Tour of the Arnhem Battlefields, p. 98 Nevertheless, the aircraft encountered considerable anti-aircraft fire as they approached the drop zone. Waddy later recalled that his aircraft was so near to the ground that he could see the upturned faces of the German gun crews. He observed numerous flak bursts and watched the escorting Hawker Typhoon fighters attacking flak batteries as they approached the DZ.Waddy, A Tour of the Arnhem Battlefields, p99 His own aircraft was hit in the tail but the pilot continued to the drop zone where, despite bad yawing, Waddy and his men were able to jump. The paratroopers came under small-arms fire directed at the aircraft's doors as they left the aircraftWaddy, A Tour of the Arnhem Battlefields, p. 100 and parachuted under heavy fire onto Ginkel Heath.Ryan, p. 317 Waddy's signaller lost his radio as he jumped behind him; the bulky equipment was hit by a round the moment he jumped out of the Dakota.Thompson, pp. 228‚Äì229Waddy, Audio Archive ‚Äì Parachuting under German fire at Ginkel Heath On the ground, an irate captain, who had expected the men four hours earlier, explained to a shocked Waddy the rapidly deteriorating situation on the ground. With 11th Parachute Battalion despatched to Arnhem and 10th Parachute Battalion defending the wounded on the drop zone, only 156th Battalion was free to move.Middlebrook, p. 249 At about 5 pm they moved off along the Utrecht‚ÄìArnhem railway and met their glider-borne elements at Wolfheze just before being strafed by a German fighter. Approaching Oosterbeek they encountered German Panzer troops and stopped for the night. In the morning, fresh orders were issued to lead the 4th Brigade to the left flank of 1st Parachute Brigade. B Company were ordered to provide supporting fire from the flanks of A Company's advance, which they successfully did before returning to battalion HQ and following up the advance.Waddy, Audio Archive ‚Äì Being blocked by Panzer troops Lieutenant Colonel Sir Richard des Voeux ordered Waddy to take B Company through A Company's positions and continue the advance to the high ground, believing that there was not much opposition.Middlebrook, p. 258 In fact A Company had been nearly destroyed,Middlebrook, p. 257 and Waddy passed numerous bodies on his way forward. As the company advanced, they were held up by what Waddy believed was a twin barrelled 20mm flak gun. He led a small group to attack it, but was spotted by a German sniper as they moved forward. A companion was killed instantly and Waddy, without his machine gun, could only fire ineffectively with his pistol. The sniper shot him in the groin and tried to hit him again as he started to crawl away, forcing Waddy to lie doggo for a moment before one of his men, a tall Rhodesian soldier, carried him back to Company HQ.Waddy, Audio Archive ‚Äì Wounded in the woods and evacuated Faced with a heavy concentration of enemy armour, the attack stalled and was then called off; the battalion had taken such heavy casualties that it was reduced essentially to the size of a single company.Buckingham, p. 182 At the Regimental Aid Post, Waddy found that the doctors did not rate his chances particularly highly; the 156 Battalion's war diary even recorded that \\"B Company commander was fatally wounded\\".Margry, p. 444 He was taken next to a Field Ambulance post and from there to the Tafelburg hotel in Oosterbeek, now being used as a main dressing station. Here he was operated on in the hotel's billiard room where Major Guy Rigby Jones used the billiard table to perform surgery.Ryan, p. 494Waddy, A Tour of the Arnhem Battlefields, p. 158 A day later he was moved to a house opposite as the number of casualties increased. Because the aid stations were in the front lines of the Oosterbeek perimeter, they came under constant fire and he was wounded twice more. A mortar round shell fragment lodged in his left foot, and a later hit caused splinter injuries to his face and shoulder. On another occasion, as the battle seesawed around the aid post, Germans occupied his building. A British sniper shot a German rifleman, prompting a German sergeant to lecture the British about shooting at a Red Cross house. When the house caught fire he was taken outside and driven to a collection point from where German medics took him to Apeldoorn. Waddy spent the next six weeks in a German hospital in Apeldoorn. Once again the British patients were lectured about firing at the Red Cross after a Spitfire strafed the operating theatre, but overall Waddy was impressed by the kindness of the German staff and guards.Waddy, Audio Archive ‚Äì Kindness of the German guards He narrowly avoided having his foot amputated when a nurse removed the splinter embedded in it with a pair of forceps,Waddy, Audio Archive ‚Äì German hospital conditions and treatment and once he had sufficiently recovered from his wounds he was taken to Stalag VII-A where he remained until the camp was liberated at the end of April 1945. Post-war service Waddy remained in the army after the war ended and joined the HQ of 3rd Parachute Brigade before being sent to Palestine in September 1945. A month later he joined the 9th Battalion dealing with the Jewish terrorist threat and in July 1947 he was wounded once again, this time by members of the IZL. Because the Parachute Regiment was not allowed to recruit officers for longer than three years, Waddy was posted in March 1948, after almost seven years with the regiment. He spent the next four years in staff posts, initially in Greece, then Taunton where he became GSO 3 for 43rd (Wessex) Division. Later he was sent to 1st Infantry Division in Egypt and then Libya. In July 1952 he was promoted to substantive major, and two months later was posted to Malaya as a company commander with the 1st Battalion, The Somerset Light Infantry. He spent a year in the country during the Malayan Emergency and was Mentioned in Despatches. Returning from Malaya, Waddy spent time at RAF Staff College and as a training major for the Somerset Light Infantry Territorial Army Battalion. He then volunteered to rejoin the Parachute Regiment and was sent to the Canadian Joint Air Training Centre in Manitoba, Canada, on exchange. In 1958 the Parachute Regiment was allowed to keep its own officers and Waddy swiftly applied. He was posted to Jordan and then Cyprus as 2IC of 2nd Battalion, an experience he likened to being back with family.Waddy, Audio Archive ‚Äì Describing the 'Airborne Spirit' and the unique character of Airborne soldiers In 1960 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and posted to Aldershot to command the Depot The Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces during which time he established the Parachute Regiment Battle Camp at Brecon, which later evolved into the Infantry Battle School. In 1962 he became chief instructor at a small arms school in Hythe. In the 1963 New Year Honours he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his command of the depot. In late 1964, Waddy took up a new post as Colonel SAS, which later evolved into Director SAS (now Director Special Forces), resulting in his promotion to full colonel. Waddy was an early incumbent of this post and is credited with doing much to develop new roles for the SAS in the post-colonial war period.Kemp, p. 112 He also wrote a paper envisaging counter-terrorism and intelligence gathering roles for the service, predictions that have since been realised.Davies, p. 275 After brief stints in Washington D.C. and Fort Benning as a liaison officer, Waddy was posted to the British Embassy in Saigon as a defence advisor in 1970. Here he was able to witness the Vietnam War first hand before returning to Britain in 1972 and joining the Joint Warfare Establishment at Old Sarum near Salisbury in Wiltshire. Civilian service Waddy resigned his commission in 1974 and became military advisor to Westland Helicopters, a post he held until his retirement in 1989. Although he found the work stimulating, Waddy was frustrated by the Army's lack of interest in the helicopter. When production of the movie A Bridge Too Far began in 1975, Waddy was given six months leave by Westland to act as chief Military Advisor, an appointment that John Frost thought was ideal.Frost, p. 253 Waddy was responsible for training \\"Attenborough's Private Army\\", a group of fifty men who went through boot camp in order to portray Frost's men at Arnhem Bridge and provide the backbone of the extra cast.Waddy, After the Battle, p. 38 Waddy confessed to being deeply concerned by the actors' quality at first, but was able to turn them into men who looked and acted the part.Waddy, After the Battle, p. 39 Although there was little that Waddy or his fellow military consultants (who included Frost, Roy Urquhart, James M. Gavin, Brian Horrocks and J. O. E. Vandeleur) could do to greatly influence the film's script, he was able to ensure that some parts were kept historically accurate.Waddy, After the Battle, p. 50 By way of thanking him after receiving some advice, Edward Fox referred to his driver as Waddy in his first scene in the movie, and he had a brief cameo appearance in one of the film's final scenes. Along with many veterans, Waddy returned to Arnhem frequently. When visiting in 1954 he was presented with a damaged silver cigarette case bearing his surname. When he had it cleaned at home he discovered it was a present from his father to Colonel Hilaro Barlow, another 1st Airborne officer who was killed during the battle.Middlebrook, p. 211 From 1982 to 1996 Waddy led talks for students of the Army Staff College on their battlefield tours at Arnhem, a role he reprised when the Defence Academy restarted the tours in 2008. He wrote a book on the subject in 1999 (A Tour of the Arnhem Battlefields) and was widely recognised as an authority on the battle. By the time of his 100th birthday in June 2020, Waddy was the last surviving officer from the Battle of Arnhem. He celebrated his birthday at his home in Taunton, with visits from the Parachute Regiment and the Deputy Defence Attach√© from the embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, who presented Waddy with the Dutch Thank You Liberators Medaille. Waddy died in his sleep on 27 September 2020.

The treaty was the most important achievement of Bogislaw X's foreign policy.Schleinert (2007), p.37 It was confirmed and amended when a final settlement between the two houses was reached in the Treaty of Grimnitz in 1529. Background In the 15th century, a longstanding conflict between the Electorate of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Pomerania had flared up again: Brandenburg, then ruled by the House of Hohenzollern, claimed the Pomeranian duchy as a fief, while the House of Pomerania (\\"Griffins\\") claimed Imperial immediacy.Heitz (1995), pp.188ff The frontier between the realms of the two houses was also disputed, and the conflict was often fought out in open war. Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania In 1464, the dispute escalated due to the death of Otto III, Duke of Pomerania: Otto III had died without issue, and left his partition of Pomerania, the Duchy of Pomerania-Stettin vacated.Buchholz (1999), p.183 Both his relatives from the House of Pomerania and the Hohenzollern claimed succession. In the Treaty of Soldin (1466), the Pomeranian dukes and Brandenburgian electors settled for a scenario where the House of Pomerania would rule Pomerania- Stettin as a Brandenburgian fief.Heitz (1995), p.194 Yet, this treaty did not come into effect, and the two houses again resorted to warfare.Heitz (1995), pp.195-200 The war was temporarily ended with the Treaty of Prenzlau (1472), when the House of Pomerania had to accept Brandenburgian overlordship and succession as well as territorial losses, but flared up again in 1477.Heitz (1995), p.200 Brandenburg was able to decide the war in her favour, and Bogislaw X, meanwhile the sole Pomeranian duke after his co-rulers had died in 1464, 1474 and 1478, had to accept and renew the treaty of 1472 in the Treaty of Prenzlau (1479).Heitz (1995), pp.200-201 While in 1479 Bogislaw X had pledged allegiance to Albrecht III, Elector of Brandenburg, he refused to do so to his son, John Cicero, when the latter succeeded in the Brandenburgian electorate. Margarethe, a daughter of Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg and married to Bogislaw X since 1477, sided with her husband in the feud despite maintaining good relations to her cousin, John Cicero.Stafford (2001), p.182 Yet, Bogislaw X's marriage with Margarethe was not blessed with children. Bogislaw X accused her that she had manipulated her body to prevent conception, so the Pomeranian duchy would fall to Brandenburg according to the treaties of Prenzlau.Rogge (2004), p.78 Margarethe died in 1489.Heitz (1995), p.278 In 1490 Bogislaw married Anna Jagiellon of Poland,Schleinert (2007), p.54 but, though Anna was pregnant, no heir was born yet by the time the treaty of Pyritz was concluded. Provisions John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg accepted that the House of Pomerania is not obliged to take the Duchy of Pomerania as a fief from the House of Hohenzollern, and that the dukes of Pomerania would not have to pledge allegiance to the Brandenburgian electors.Heitz (1995), p.202 In turn, Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania assured the Hohenzollern their right of succession in the Duchy of Pomerania in case the House of Pomerania became extinct. John Cicero made his assurances on 26 March 1493 in the Pomeranian town of Pyritz, while Bogislaw X responded in the Prussian town of K√∂nigsberg on 28 March. The Brandenburgian right of Pomeranian succession was confirmed by oath by 150 Pomeranian prelates and landlords. Aftermath With the birth of Georg I, Duke of Pomerania on 11 April 1493, subsequently followed by the birth of four more children to Bogislaw X and Anna Jagiellon, Brandenburg's hopes for prompt succession in Pomerania were thwarted.Materna (1995), p.260 When in 1495 Bogislaw X was invited to the Imperial Diet in Worms, John Cicero ordered the interception of the invitation.Stollberg-Rilinger (2008), p.81 Both John Cicero and Bogislaw X then were absent from the Diet, yet John Cicero had arranged that - in his place - his brother formally received the Duchy of Pomerania as a fief. In the following, Bogislaw X frequently contacted Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor to personally receive the Duchy of Pomerania as a fief. In 1521, emperor Maximilian I's successor Charles V on his first Diet in Worms gave the Duchy of Pomerania as a fief to John Cicero's successor Joachim I and his brother Kasimir as well as to Bogislaw X, exploring an opportunity to receive taxes for the duchy from both the Hohenzollern and the House of Pomerania.Stollberg- Rilinger (2008), pp.81-82 However, Bogislaw X was then integrated in the Upper Saxon Circle and awarded a seat and a vote in the Imperial Diet, which he seized despite Brandenburgian protests in Nuremberg in 1522.Stollberg-Rilinger (2008), p.82 Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg After Bogislaw X's death in 1523, the Brandenburg-Pomeranian conflict continued between Joachim I and Bogislaw X's sons Georg I and Barnim XI who ruled Pomerania in common, but could be solved by diplomacy.NDB I (2003), p.595 In 1526, Joachim I had intervened when the Pomeranian dukes were invited to participate in an Imperial Diet in Speyer. The Pomeranian case was negotiated in Speyer, and high nobles of the Holy Roman Empire mediated the conflict thereafter. In 1529, the Treaty of Grimnitz finally settled the conflict, confirming and amending the treaty of Pyritz: In Grimnitz, Pomerania was confirmed as an immediate imperial fief, yet the Electors of Brandenburg had to be present at every formal investiture and were allowed to touch the Pomeranian flag during the process, furthermore they were allowed to entitle themselves as dukes of Pomerania with the exception of cases when both the Pomeranian dukes and the Brandenburgian electors were present. The succession clause of the Treaty of Grimnitz would have come into effect in 1637 with the death of the last Griffin duke of Pomerania, yet, as this duke had concluded a conflicting treaty with Sweden seven years before, the Treaty of Stettin (1630), and Pomerania at that time was occupied by superior Swedish forces, the Brandenburg-Pomeranian conflict continued between the houses of Hohenzollern and Sweden.Croxton (2002), p.30 Sources=ReferencesBibliography    Category:Treaties of the Duchy of Pomerania Category:Treaties of the Margraviate of Brandenburg Category:1490s in the Holy Roman Empire Category:1493 in Europe Category:1490s treaties ","title":"Treaty of Pyritz"},{"id":"24524233","text":"Zaza Sakhokia (born 12 February 1984) is a Georgian footballer currently under contract for Georgian side Skuri Tsalenjikha.Georgia - Zaza Sakhokia - Soccerway.com Notes Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Georgia (country) Category:Expatriate footballers from Georgia (country) Category:FC Mika players Category:FC Gandzasar Kapan players Category:Expatriate footballers in Armenia Category:Association football forwards Category:FC Zugdidi players Category:Armenian Premier League players ","title":"Zaza Sakhokia"},{"id":"24524234","text":"Buzara forceps is a moth of the family Erebidae.

The Islands of Newfoundland are mainly supported through fisheries, but a persistent population of sheep has been present since the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and a native landrace has developed since that time. Though it has never been fully recognized as a breed, Newfoundland sheep are a distinct genetic base. Both Border Cheviot and North Ronaldsay sheep are known to have been major contributors to Newfoundland bloodlines, and there may have also been contributions from other breeds such as the Suffolk, Border Leicester, Portland Sheep and Scottish Blackface. Newfoundland sheep show fairly wide variability, but are generally medium sheep - Very few ewes are horned, and rams can be either horned or few are polled. All Newfoundlands are characterized by a great deal of hardiness, able to survive off of poor native forage. Newfoundland Sheep are medium size and come in multiple colors. Rams are mostly horned and some ewes are horned as well. Newfoundland Sheep very easy lambing with rarely any complications. Good mothers lambs weight about 6-8 pounds (3-4 kg) at birth Preliminary Results NLS flocks across the province have developed into uniform genetic pools. That is to say there should be uniformity within each of the flocks similar to that of other registered breeds. Despite the fact that NLS are kept as small flocks, Sheep from Fortune Bay, Trinity Bay North and Notre Dame Bay had the smallest amount of genetic variability, i.e. they are more uniform than other flocks studied as a result of these small flocks being kept in isolation for 15 to 50 years. 2\\\\. The theory that if the NLS identified are classified as one group then there should be relatively small genetic differences among the flocks. The NLS from different regions have different DNA profiles which is consistent with the differences in their sizes, bone structure, face and fleece colours. There was little physical similarities across the flocks. Sheep in Trinity Bay North showed the highest difference compared with those in other regions, particularly with those in Fortune Bay and Notre Dame Bay. Such differences could be the result of different ancestral breeds, differences in climatic conditions under which these sheep have been kept for decades, There has been little information documented on the Local Newfoundland Sheep. Of the information that is documented, the author has concluded that the Border Cheviot characteristics were the most prominent breed while Blackface Highland and Portland sheep were also present. These sheep have survived through extensive management and natural selection and have been recorded to be continuous breeders, easy lambers, good mothers and late maturing lambs. A breed association is required to set the standards of Local Newfoundland Sheep and a breed registry book needs to be maintained. There has been a decent effort made to collect data on the Local Newfoundland sheep. This data needs to be analyzed by a competent animal geneticist. A breeding program needs to be set up to guide the producers into preserving the Local Newfoundland sheep. The DNA fingerprinting, though not compulsory for breed registration, will be a great asset. There has been 37 farms in which data was collected on 336 animals, there are an additional 6 or 7 farms where the animals have been let go for the summer which need to be revisited when the animals are home from summer pasture. The author found that the NLS sheep are generally white with a white face and orange mottle coloring, and a small head. A percentage (10.4%) of these sheep are black with brown coloring intermixed. Generally, \\"Local\\" Newfoundland sheep are small, narrow chested animals with a small body frame and are straight in the back with strong short legs and strong pasterns and black hooves. The late maturing trait was particularly noted in the flock of Richard Wells, Exploits Island. This was also observed in a flock on the Northern Peninsula where sheep and lambs were released on the commons in early May and were prepared for market in late November allowing for approximately 240 days to market. It was also noted that there was little information documented on the productivity of \\"Local\\" Newfoundland Sheep. This may be a result of farmers being cautious of providing information to government. In recognizing that there has been an effort made to find what the physical phenotypic characteristics of the \\"Local\\" Newfoundland breed of sheep are (by weighing, measuring and recording of these measurements) it is the author's opinion that there are some similarities and differences in the flock of sheep across the province. The most noticeable differences are usually tall sheep (76 cm at the shoulders) in certain areas versus short sheep (54 cm at the shoulders) which for the most part made up the greater population. The tall sheep resemble the Border Leicester body shape but not the head or face Breed the short sheep resemble the Welsh Mountain Sheep. There were sheep with clean faces (98%) versus sheep with some wool covering on the face (2%) and over the poll. while wool face may have a resemblance to the Dorset,Portland sheep or other breeds. In the general appearance of the face, the bulk of the animals resemble North Ronaldsay sheep in color and distinct appearance but in a larger size and a Border Cheviot body while there are a minority group with some resemblance to Finn sheep or Romanov mountain or island breeds which would be very new to North America. The similarities observed in the flocks across the island are the high percentage of black sheep and lambs in 10.4% of the flocks. These sheep may be indicative of the black faced Highland sheep breed as referred to in the 1955 Royal Commission Report on Agriculture. There were a percentage of the sheep with horns (80 % of rams, 4% of ewes) and though at the time of data collection there were 13 rams, many of these rams had horns which would resemble the Dorset horn. The overall body Many people have helped in the collecting of blood samples, including Marg Zillig, Roy MacKenzie (NSDAM), Mike Wallace (US Meat Animal Research Center, Nebraska), Brian Magee (Cornell University, NY). DNA from Red Maasai was kindly provided by Dr. Alan Teale and Dr. Olivier Hanotte, the International Livestock Research Institute, Kenya. DNA samples of some of the Icelandic sheep were kindly provided by Dr. Adsridur Palsdottir, Iceland. Many of the Newfoundland Department of Forest Resources and Agrifoods' staff assisted in data and blood collection and in particular Ben Pungtilan, Morley Hann and Michelle Ralph Spears. Special thanks to the Newfoundland Local Steering Committee which is composed Howard Morry Sr., Howard Morry Jr., Richard Coffey and Dan Harwood. Many sheep breeders across Newfoundland and Canada need to be thanked for without their kind collaboration it would not have been possible to complete this experiment. Financial assistance for this project was provided by the Canada/Newfoundland Green Plan, and Canada/Newfoundland Agricultural Safety Net Program. To date there are less than 100 pure on the Island of Newfoundland Coinciding with a general decline in sheep populations in the region, Newfoundland sheep of the native type decline to less than 200 individuals at one point. Thanks to attention by universities, rare breed organizations, and farmers, numbers have increased, but the breed is considered critically endangered still.

The 28 piece hoard includes various silver metalwork items, including twelve pennanular brooches. The treasure is now in the National Museum of Scotland. Description Sword pommel The hoard consists of 28 silver and silver-gilt objects, datomg tp the second half of the eighth century. They can be divided into dining, weapons and jeweller items. There are twelve silver penannular brooches, eight silver bowls, one silver communion spoon, one silver knife, two silver chapes, one silver pommel, and three silver cones. It is thought that some items were secular, such as the penannular brooches and different chapes from sword scabbards. Other pieces, including the bowls, spoon and cones, may have been used in religious ceremonies or community rituals. The brooches show a variety of typical Pictish forms, with both animal-head and lobed geometrical forms of terminal.Two of the scabbard chapes and a sword pommel appear to be Anglo- Saxon, probably made in Mercia in the late eighth century; one has an inscription with a prayer in Old English. Gifts were often exchanged between Anglo-Saxon and Pictish rulers, and generally \\"weapons are among the objects which travelled most widely in the early medieval period\\". History St Ninian's Isle and tombolo The hoard was discovered on 4 July 1958 by schoolboy, Douglas Coutts, during an excavation of a medieval chapel on St Ninian‚Äôs Isle. Coutts found the treasure in a wooden box, which had been buried under a cross-marked slab. Coutts was helping visiting archaeologists led by Professor A. C. O'Dell of Aberdeen University. It is believed that the treasure was hidden beneath the floor of an earlier church. Professor Andrew Charles O'Dell, writing in December 1959 in Antiquity magazine, recounts that: :\\"... the church on this site was described early in the 18th century as being still venerated by local people although it had been abandoned at the Reformation in favour of a more central parish church ... ... from the sandy spit, which has formed between the mainland and the isle, gales have carried sand and this, together with the accretion of a graveyard in use until c.1850, buried the church remains and all knowledge of its exact location had vanished from living memory ... At the occasion of the first Viking Congress in 1951 Dr W. Douglas Simpson suggested a search might prove rewarding and this was undertaken in 1955 by a party of my students under my direction. The results in this and succeeding years have exceeded expectations. ... The medieval building with its massive mortared walls, main altar and a side altar had made the excavation noteworthy before 4 July 1958, when the hoard was discovered. Close to the southern chancel arch foundation, and missed by inches by later burials, was found a broken sandstone slab, 10.5 in. by 15 in., lightly inscribed with a cross and, below this, was the hoard. It had been contained in a larch box of which a few splinters, impregnated with metal salts, had escaped decay. The bowls were upside down and the brooches and other objects tangled together, showing it has been hurriedly carried and buried with the top down. In with the objects was the porpoise jawbone and this, the only non- metallic object, is strong evidence of its ecclesiastical connection, although the brooches suggest a secular link ...\\" The treasure was donated to the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland (NMAS) in 1965-6 and is now in the successor Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, whilst replicas are held by the Shetland Museum.

It was introduced by The Law Society of England and Wales in 1998. Until 2010, the Lexcel standard was attainable by law firms and in-house legal departments in England and Wales. A separate franchised scheme was available for practices in Northern Ireland. Since September 2010, Lexcel accreditation has been attainable by any law firm or in-house legal department in any jurisdiction in the world. The worldwide scheme continues to be administered by the Law Society of England and Wales. Benefits from accreditation The Law Society of England and Wales have carried out research and received feedback from practices which indicate that the benefits of achieving Lexcel accreditation are: *Effective risk management leading to fewer claims or complaints. *Better customer service leading to increased client retention. *Lower professional indemnity insurance premiums or favourable treatment from insurers. *Improved marketability and competitive advantage. *Increased success in tenders and panel reviews. *Helping to demonstrate best value compliance. *Consistency of service from all solicitors and practice groups. *Help with new practice rules. *Increased profitability. Sections of the Lexcel standard Version 5 of the standard, published in 2011, is still broken down into eight areas of practice; Structure and Policies, Strategic Plans, Financial Management, Information Management, People Management, Risk Management, Client Care and File and Case Management. Compliance with the standard is ascertained by independent assessment. The focus of Lexcel has, over time, moved slightly more towards the management of risk. For example, v5 of the standard no longer requires a quality policy (mandatory in ISO9001:2008) but does require policies covering outsourcing, use of social media and conflicts of interest, and procedures covering financial crime. A number of Lexcel requirements simply reiterate the requirements of regulators, such as the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). All solicitors in England & Wales must meet these regulatory requirements, not just those with Lexcel. For example, the Lexcel requirement 1.4 for a \\"policy on the avoidance of discrimination\\" is very similar to the Indicative Behaviours (IB2.1-2.5) in the SRA Handbook 2011. Accreditation process Before requesting an independent assessment, a practice or legal department should ascertain how closely aligned to the standard it is. This can be undertaken by completing The Law Society's Self-Assessment Checklist - see 'External Links' below. For organisations requiring consultancy assistance to achieve compliance, they are open to seek assistance from a Law Society accredited consultant. See 'External Links' below for a list. A practice or legal department wishing to arrange an assessment against the Lexcel Standard will have to do two things. Firstly, select one of The Law Society's licensed assessment bodies to carry out the assessment. They should be contacted to agree the duration of the assessment and the fee payable. See 'External Links' below - for a list of assessment bodies. The assessment body will be able to answer any questions relating to the assessment process and guide the organisation through it. Secondly, the organisation will need to make an application for an assessment directly with The Law Society. This is done by completing the application form - see 'External Links' below. The Law Society charge practices an annual registration fee which varies from ¬£60.00 to ¬£865.00 depending on the size of the practice. Organisations must include with their application: *details of the practice's approved indemnity insurance provider, claims handler and policy number; *a full list of all employees (identifying qualified people who earn fees or provide legal advice) and also including staff in support roles; *a letter authorising the application (only necessary for applying organisations who are not private practice law firms) Outcome of assessment If an organisation is correctly aligned with the Standard, the assessment report will be sent to The Law Society and the standard awarded. If an organisation's policies, plans, procedures and processes are not correctly aligned with the Lexcel standard, the assessor will note minor or major 'non-compliances'. Where an organisation is being assessed for the first time, they have up to six months to correct the non- compliances and on completion of any necessary work, will then be awarded the Lexcel Standard. Subsequent assessments will result in minor non-compliances having to be corrected within three weeks and major non-compliances within three months. Award of the standard lasts three years subject to satisfactory annual maintenance visits (AMVs). At the end of the three-year award, if the organisation wishes to continue with Lexcel, a full re-assessment is again undertaken.

Career He started his career in Olympiakos as part of the first team in 1997. He was brought to Burnley by Stan Ternent as one of three Greeks to sign for the Clarets along with goalkeeper Nikolaos Michopoulos and centre-forward Dimitrios Papadopoulos. Cennamo is half Greek/half Italian, but just to confuse matters even further he'd been born in 1980 in Munich in Southern Germany. He signed from Olympiakos on an initial six-month deal, the 21-year-old would be understudy to Nikolaos Michopoulos but was expected to offer genuine competition for the first team role. On first team days he was always named on the bench as the substitute keeper, and in December was almost called upon at Preston when it looked as though Michopoulos would be sent off. At the beginning of 2001, there were big changes for Luigi. Firstly the club announced they had signed him from Olympiakos. The fact that the Clarets were keen to make it permanent suggested he might have a long-term future with the club but just under two weeks later his world came crashing down, as did Burnley's hopes in the FA Cup. His club was a favourite to beat Cheltenham at Whaddon Road but after twenty minutes in the game gone, Michopoulos suffered a serious injury and Luigi got his big chance. Five minutes after coming on he was picking the ball out of the net, and he was repeating that after another five minutes. Hus manager Stan Ternent didn't trust him to replace Michopoulos and before the next game he brought in Marlon Beresford on loan from Middlesbrough. Cennamo didn't even make the bench, in fact was never on the bench again and was released at the end of the season. He returned to Greece and after playing for a number of clubs. He succeeded to play with top division club Egaleo for almost 5 years. He was in their squad against Middlesbrough in the UEFA Cup during the 2004/05 season. In the season 2009/10, he moved to the Cypriot club APEP Pitsilia, having the first team role. After a year in Cyprus he returned to Greece, joining Panetolikos in Football League, helping the club to win the Championship. On August 2, 2012 Luigi Cennamo transferred to Maccabi Netanya on a free transfer from Panetolikos. It was a great year for him as he played for 38 games in all competitions. German-born Italian goalkeeper Luigi Cennamo has signed a one-year contract for an undisclosed fee with Atromitos, the Greek Super League team announced. On March 12, 2014 Atromitos announced that after Tasos Karamanos, Nikolaos Lazaridis and Efstathios Tavlaridis, another player decided to continue with the club! The club recognized the effort, the stability, the character and the professionalism and made a formal proposal for renewal. The keeper signed a new contract lasting until 2016 in the presence of the Technical Manager Yiannis Angelopoulos. \\"I want to start by thanking the president Mr. George Spanos and technical director Mr. Yiannis Angelopoulos for the confidence showed to me, but above all to my coach George Paraschos who actively shows me confidence on the court.\\" said in atromitos.fc the keeper. On 15 July 2015, after two years with the club and 42 appearances in all competitions, Atromitos announces the end of the cooperation with the player. Therefore, along with Elini Dimoutsos, has informed that are not included in the planning of the club for the next season. On 16 June 2015, Cennamo signed a one-year contract with Xanthi. On 23 August 2015, he made his debut with the club in a 0-0 away draw against PAOK. He finished as the undisputed leader of the club's defence being the main goalie for the first half of the 2015-16 season. On 17 August 2016, Cennamo signed a year contract with Lamia. On 5 July 2017, he signed a year contract with Super League club Panetolikos References External links  *Official Website Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Italian footballers Category:Italian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Israel Category:Expatriate footballers in Cyprus Category:Olympiacos F.C. players Category:Egaleo F.C. players Category:Burnley F.C. players Category:Proodeftiki F.C. players Category:APEP FC players Category:Panetolikos F.C. players Category:Maccabi Netanya F.C. players Category:Atromitos F.C. players Category:Super League Greece players Category:Football League (Greece) players Category:Cypriot First Division players Category:Israeli Premier League players Category:Panegialios F.C. players Category:Association football goalkeepers ","title":"Luigi Cennamo"},{"id":"24524399","text":"Kiliann Witschi (born 9 November 1985) is a Swiss retired professional footballer who played as a defender.

In his Politics, Aristotle saw women as subject to men, but as higher than slaves, and lacking authority; he believed the husband should exert political rule over the wife. Among women's differences from men were that they were, in his view, more impulsive, more compassionate, more complaining, and more deceptive. He gave the same weight to women's happiness as to men's, and in his Rhetoric stated that society could not be happy unless women were happy too. Whereas Plato was open to the potential equality of men and women, stating both that women were not equal to men in terms of strength and virtue, but were equal to men in terms of rational and occupational capacity, and hence in the ideal Republic should be educated and allowed to work alongside men without differentiation, Aristotle appears to have disagreed. In his theory of inheritance, Aristotle considered the mother to provide a passive material element to the child, while the father provided an active, ensouling element with the form of the human species. Differences between males and females Aristotle believed women were inferior to men. For example, in his work Politics (1254b13‚Äì14), Aristotle states \\"as regards the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject\\". In Politics 1.13 he wrote, \\"The slave is wholly lacking the deliberative element; the female has it but it lacks authority; the child has it but it is incomplete\\". Cynthia Freeland wrote: \\"Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity'.\\" Aristotle believed that men and women naturally differed both physically and mentally. He claimed that women are \\"more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive ... more compassionate ... more easily moved to tears ... more jealous, more querulous, more apt to scold and to strike ... more prone to despondency and less hopeful ... more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, of more retentive memory [and] ... also more wakeful; more shrinking [and] more difficult to rouse to action\\" than men.History of Animals, 608b1‚Äì14. He wrote that only fair-skinned women, not darker-skinned women, had a sexual discharge and climaxed. He also believed this discharge could be increased by eating of pungent foods. Aristotle thought a woman's sexual discharge was akin to that of an infertile or amputated male's.Generation of Animals, I, 728a. He concluded that both sexes contributed to the material of generation, but that the female's contribution was in her discharge (as in a male's) rather than within the ovary. Aristotle explains how and why the association between man and woman takes on a hierarchical character by commenting on male rule over 'barbarians', or non- Greeks. \\"By nature the female has been distinguished from the slave. For nature makes nothing in the manner that the coppersmiths make the Delphic knife ‚Äì that is, frugally ‚Äì but, rather, it makes each thing for one purpose. For each thing would do its work most nobly if it had one task rather than many. Among the barbarians the female and the slave have the same status. This is because there are no natural rulers among them but, rather, the association among them is between male and female slave. On account of this, the poets say that 'it is fitting that Greeks rule barbarians', as the barbarian and the slave are by nature the same.\\" While Aristotle reduced women's roles in society, and promoted the idea that women should receive less food and nourishment than males, he also criticised the results: a woman, he thought, was then more compassionate, more opinionated, more apt to scold and to strike. He stated that women are more prone to despondency, more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, and of having a better memory.History of Animals, book IX, part 1. Women's role in inheritance form from the father. The model is not fully symmetric. Aristotle's inheritance model sought to explain how the parents' characteristics are transmitted to the child, subject to influence from the environment. In his view, an active, ensouling masculine element brought life to a passive female element.Aristotle on woman The system worked as follows. The father's semen and the mother's menses encode their parental characteristics. The model is partly asymmetric, as only the father's movements define the form or eidos of the human species, while the movements of both the father's and the mother's fluids define features other than the form, such as the father's eye colour or the mother's nose shape. The theory has some symmetry, as semen movements carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is hot enough to overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; but if it is too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending. The child's sex can be influenced by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the semen overpowers the menses, so if a man has strong semen, he will have sons who resemble him, while if the semen is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother. Morality and politics According to Aristotle, there should be \\"political rule\\" of the husband over the wife.Politics I, 1259a‚Äìb.Korinna Zamfir, Men and Women in the Household of God: A Contextual Approach to Roles and Ministries in the Pastoral Epistle, Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2013, p. 375. As for the differences between husband and wife, Aristotle says that these \\"always\\" consisted in external appearances, in speeches, and in honors.Politics, 1259b. The household functions of a man and of a woman are different because his business is \\"to get\\" and hers \\"to keep\\".Politics 1277b. On good wives Economics from 1830. In his Economics, Aristotle wrote that it befits not a man of sound mind to bestow his person promiscuously, or have random intercourse with women; for otherwise the base-born will share in the rights of his lawful children, and his wife will be robbed of her honor due, and shame be attached to his sons. It is fitting that he should approach his wife in honor, full of self-restraint and awe, and in his conversation with her, should use only the words of a right- minded man, suggesting only such acts as are themselves lawful and honorable. Aristotle's thought that a wife was best honored when she saw that her husband was faithful to her, and that he had no preference for another woman, but before all others loves, trusts her and holds her as his own.The Politics and Economics of Aristotle, Edward English Walford and John Gillies, trans. (London: G. Bell & Sons, 1908), pp. 298ff. Aristotle wrote that a husband should secure the agreement, loyalty, and devotion of his wife, so that whether he himself is present or not, there may be no difference in her attitude towards him, since she realizes that they are alike guardians of the common interests, and so when he is away she may feel that to her no man is kinder or more virtuous or more truly hers than her own husband. Spartan women Aristotle wrote that in Sparta, the legislator wanted to make the whole city (or country) hardy and temperate, and that he carried out his intention in the case of the men, but he overlooked the women, who lived in every sort of intemperance and wealth. He added that in those regimes in which the condition of the women was bad, half the city could be regarded as having no laws.The Politics of Aristotle, Book 2, Ch. 9, trans. Benjamin Jowett, London: Colonial Press, 1900. Equal weight to female and male happiness Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his Rhetoric that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too. In an article titled \\"Aristotle's Account of the Subjection of Women\\", Stauffer explains that Aristotle believed that in nature a common good came of the rule of a superior being. But he does not indicate a common good for men being superior to women. He uses the word Œ∫œÅŒµŒØœÑœÑœâŒΩ kreitton to indicate superiority, meaning stronger. Aristotle believed that rational reasoning is what made you superior over lesser beings in nature, yet still used the term meaning stronger, not more rational or intelligent. Children On children, he said, \\"And what could be more divine than this, or more desired by a man of sound mind, than to beget by a noble and honored wife children who shall be the most loyal supporters and discreet guardians of their parents in old age, and the preservers of the whole house? Rightly reared by father and mother, children will grow up virtuous, as those who have treated them piously and righteously deserve that they should...\\"Aristotle, Aristotle's Politics: Writings from the Complete Works: Politics, Economics, Constitution of Athens, Princeton University Press, 2016, p. 254. Aristotle believed we all have a biological drive to procreate, to leave behind something to take the place and be similar to ourselves. This then justifies the natural partnership between man and woman. And each person has one specific purpose because we are better at mastering one specific trait rather than being adequate at multiple. For Aristotle, women's purpose is to give birth to children. Aristotle stressed that man and woman work together to raise the children and that how they raise them has a huge influence over the kind of people they become and thus the kind of society or community that everyone lives in. Comparison with Plato's views on women Aristotle appears to disagree with Plato on the topic whether women ought to be educated, as Plato says that they must be. Both of them, however, consider women to be inferior. Plato in Timaeus (90e) claims that men who were cowards and were lazy throughout their life shall be reborn as women and in the Laws (781b), he offers his reasons why women should be educated: \\"Because you neglected this sex, you gradually lost control of a great many things which would be in a far better state today if they had been regulated by law. A woman's natural potential for virtue is inferior to a man's, so she's proportionately a greater danger, perhaps even twice as great.\\" Plato further establishes his opinion on the inferiority of women's \\"natural potential\\" by claiming in Republic (455d) that \\"Women share by nature in every way of life just as men do, but in all of them women are weaker than men.\\" Plato firmly believed in reincarnation and this was very important for the distinction he made between the nature of men and women. This was not the case for Aristotle, who saw the differences as biological. Plato discusses this matter with more detail in Timaeus, where he states that men have a superior soul than women (42a): \\"Humans have a twofold nature, the superior kind should be such as would from then on be called \\"man\\". He added, once again, that men who led bad lives shall be reborn as women (42b): \\"And if a person lived a good life throughout the due course of his time, he would at the end return to his dwelling place in his companion star, to live a life of happiness that agreed with his character. But if he failed in this, he would be born a second time, now as a woman.\\" Plato also appears to use the term \\"womanish\\" or \\"female- like\\" as an derogatory term implying inferiority and emotional instability, as this is clear from Republic 469d and 605e, amongst others. Legacy=Galen Aristotle's assumptions on female coldness influenced Galen and others for almost two thousand years until the sixteenth century. Church Fathers Joyce E. Salisbury argues that the Church Fathers, influenced by Aristotle's opinions, opposed the practice of independent female ascetism because it threatened to emancipate women from men.Joyce E. Salisbury, Church Fathers, Independent Virgins, Verso, 1992. Otto Weininger In his Sex and Character, written in 1903, Otto Weininger explained that all people are composed of a mixture of the male and the female substance, and that these views are supported scientifically. Weininger cited Aristotle's views in the chapter \\"Male and Female Psychology\\" of his book.

It is based on the true story of the Reverend Frederick Densham. The film was shot on location in rural Cornwall in the United Kingdom. Background Densham was a naive and pious man who worked in Whitechapel in a boys' home and also a home for inebriates. In 1921 he visited Natal in South Africa which is where he may have been influenced by the ideas of Gandhi, who had campaigned for the rights of Indians in that province. There is no evidence for any missionary work in India, though it has been speculated that he visited both India and Germany at a time when foreign travel was considered much more adventurous than it is today. In 1931 Densham took up the post of vicar in the remote Cornish village of Warleggan on Bodmin Moor. Densham's father, William, had been a Methodist preacher. It is not known why Densham was ordained into the Church of England. As a highly educated man for his time (BA, ACA) he may have felt that the Church of England was more \\"intellectual\\". However, his heart and mind lay with Methodism and thus more \\"Low Church\\". He entered a church whose congregation was \\"High Church\\". Over the years, differences slowly deepened between him and several members of his congregation. The congregation had always been small (four to nine people) and Densham found himself on many occasions preaching to an empty church. He developed the habit of occasionally placing tiny cards in the first six pews, labelled with the names of vicars going back to the Romans. When he did so he noted this in the church records and many local people remember the tiny cards. Unfortunately, Daphne du Maurier imaginatively created a \\"cardboard cut-out\\" myth about this practice. This had led to many ill-founded film and website remarks about Densham. Local people, many of whom still remember him though he died in 1953, resent the crude caricatures of the rector and of themselves. Although Densham was undoubtedly isolated by the Church of England congregation, he was popular among the local Methodists and often preached at Warleggan Chapel. He was a kindly and generous man, known for bringing rhododendron and camellias in spring to villagers and for sending milk to people who were ill. He longed for intellectual stimulation and wrote constantly, sending and receiving several letters a week. When he died, he was cremated as he had stipulated, though his wish that his ashes be scattered in a garden of remembrance that he had created in the grounds of the rectory were ignored.
