It describes a world in which the sky undergoes a transformation that prevents people from seeing the stars, giving them instead a view of the other side of the world, as if the Earth had been turned inside out. The entire universe seems to have been rebuilt by an intelligence so that each body of matter exists in a structure that connects all matter together allowing travel between worlds using \\"quantum intrusions\\". The intrusions only allow minds, or as some would maintain, souls to pass through, emerging on the other side as a fully formed member of whatever species exists on the new world. The novel is a sequel to Beyond the Veil of Stars, and follows that novel's protagonists, Cornell Novak and Porsche Neal, as they deal with their new relationship, the secret activities of the government agency that they worked for, and the possibility that some visitors from other worlds are working to destroy human society so they can take over. Plot summary Cornell Novak and Porsche Neal have moved to an isolated property that happens to contain one of the many black glass disks that appeared all over the world shortly before the sky changed. The disks mark the sites of quantum intrusions, or gateways, that have been locked down by travelers from other worlds to prevent humans from opening them. Porsche herself is a traveler, as are her extended family. Cornell was born on Earth, but suspects that his ancestors were travelers. Their initial purpose is to gather information and prepare to expose their former employer, the Cosmic Event Agency, to the world via the Internet, while having an escape route ready should the CEA attempt to capture them. However Cornell has to come to terms with Porsche's past, and the emotional relationships she formed with beings on other worlds. Porsche herself has a guilty secret. It was because of her rash revelation of her family's origins to her lover that they had to leave their previous home on the planet Jarrtree and come to Earth. The first part of the novel describes Porsche's childhood on Jarrtree and her arrival on Earth. Her extended family is part of \\"The Few\\", who have become part of societies across the universe. On Earth, Porsche and Cornell have been working with a computer expert to create their presentation to the world. Porsche, working with her cousin Trinidad and advanced technology created by the Few, has set up a network of hidden alarms and booby trap devices around the farm. Suddenly they find themselves under attack by the CEA, who seem to be aiming to kidnap them. For some reason their defenses have failed. Porsche escapes with Cornell's father through the portal into a world of intelligent apes who live in a jungle environment. Another portal from there brings them back to Tasmania from where they travel to Australia, only to find that Trinidad is working with the CEA. Their objective was to kidnap Porsche and return her to Jarrtree. Her former lover there, Jey-im, is now in a position to help the CEA kidnap the best minds of Porsche's home city. He has been manipulated over a long period by Trinidad, impersonating Porsche over the data network. Now Porsche must appear in person to complete the deception. The CEA holds her relatives and their children as hostages. The scheme appears to work and the CEA flee with their victims from the city. They come under fire from the local militia but threaten to kill the abductees unless allowed to escape. Trinidad's father, using resources still hidden on Jarrtree, intervenes and lures the entire CEA convoy into a portal which results in all their hardware being destroyed. They are forced to come to terms with the Few. It begins to become clear that some travelers are not content to live in the societies they inhabit, but work to disrupt them so they can take over. Jarrtree itself is in turmoil thanks to a new religion. Porsche suspects members of her own extended family of being part of this group that they call \\"The Others\\". Forced to choose sides, Porsche offers a deal to the CEA: her people can provide technology that would allow humans to colonize the Solar System at minimal cost using the gateways. In exchange the government would have to shut down its plans to get technology from other worlds and turn over any members of the Others who have been helping it. The cost of this deal is the apparent death of Porsche's favorite cousin, Trinidad, who throws himself out of an airborne helicopter. Subsequently Trinidad's mother disappears, as does Porsche's sister-in-law, and many other spouses who married into the Few and were believed to be natives of the worlds they came from. All their children disappear with them. Porsche is left in shock, realizing how extensive the reach of the \\"Others\\" was. However Trinidad had cast doubt on who the real villains really might be. Sequels The novel appeared to leave room for a sequel, but apart from a novelette entitled Apothecary Blue, printed in 1999 in Science Fiction Age, no other related work has been published.

Depicting the bustling urban life of Suzhou, it combines Western perspective with traditional Chinese style.  History  The Qianlong Emperor commissioned Prosperous Suzhou after he returned from an inspection trip to the south in 1751. It took several years for Xu Yang, a native of Suzhou, to complete. Prosperous Suzhou was renamed from Burgeoning Life in a Resplendent Age in the 1950s.  Description  Prosperous Suzhou is a handscroll, a long narrow scroll for displaying a series of scenes. It is twelve meters in length. It is intended to be viewed starting from the right end, by laying it flat on a table and unrolling it. One admires it section for section during the unrolling as if traveling through a landscape, depicting a continuous journey.Delbanco, Dawn (2008). \\"Chinese Handscrolls\\". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved November 13, 2013. European art and its techniques like linear perspective became increasingly influential in China the 18th and 19th centuries. Skillfully composed, Prosperous Suzhou combines Western linear perspective with traditional Chinese compositional devices. The scroll is invaluable from both a historical and an artistic point of view, depicting in intricate detail the mid-18th century topography and customs of Suzhou, allowing modern viewers to visit a Chinese city of 250 years ago. In his inscription at the end of the scroll, Xu Yang wrote that he painted it in order to depict a peaceful and prosperous reign, and to pay homage to the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. In addition, his inscription describes the scroll as a journey from Mount Lingyan to the city walls of Suzhou, through the city, and ending at Tiger Hill. The scroll vividly illustrates the visual appearance of the terrain, urban landscapes, and everyday life in an area covering several dozen miles. The middle of the scroll depicts an idealised view of all the activities of the bustling urban center of Suzhou. Viewers can see numerous merchants, traders, barges and passenger boats, as well as dense rows of shops and vendors. More than 4,800 human figures, 2,000 architectural structures, and 400 boats are present.

Collins (c. 1842 ‚Äì November 25, 1865), was an African American schoolteacher in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, who in 1864 and 1865 contributed essays and other writings to The Christian Recorder, a publication of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Starting in January 1865, her novel, The Curse of Caste, or the Slave Bride was serialized in the pages of the Christian Recorder. The novel remains unfinished due to the untimely death of its author from consumption. In 2006, William L. Andrews of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Mitch Kachun of Western Michigan University collected Collins' writings and her unfinished novel and published them, with commentary and notes, through Oxford University Press.William L. Andrews and Mitch Kachun, editors. The Curse of Caste; or the Slave Bride: A Rediscovered African American Novel, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006) Life and literary work=Life Little is known about Julia Collins' life. Scholars believe she was born a free woman in the North, though her birth name and birthdate are unknown. Only one African American woman named \\"Julia\\" appears in the 1860 Williamsport, Pennsylvania census, a seventeen year old Julia Green who was living with the family of Enoch Gilchrist, a black abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor. It's plausible that the two Julias are the same person, but cannot be verified. A sign of an educated Northerner, Collins was well-read as she referenced Alexander Pope, William Shakespeare, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and classical antiquity in her essays. What is certainly known about Collins comes directly from references to her in the Christian Recorder. In the April 16, 1864 issue of the Recorder, Enoch Gilchrist announced that Julia Collins was appointed as schoolteacher for the African American children in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. There was no school building open to African American children at that time. The school committee authorized a teacher's salary, but the teacher had to provide the materials and space. The school was likely located in the African American section near the Susquehanna River and the city's African Methodist Episcopal Church. It is not known where Collins lived before April 1864. More is known about Collins‚Äô husband, Stephen Carlisle Collins. Stephen was born a free man in Pennsylvania and lived in Williamsport. During the Civil War, he was an officer's servant before enlisting in the 6th United States Colored Infantry Regiment. For a period of time after the war, he operated a barber shop in Williamsport and served as commander of the Fribley Post of the Grand Army of the Republic, a veterans‚Äô organization for Civil War soldiers. Barbering and school teaching were higher-status occupations for African Americans in the 19th century, which meant the Collinses would have been respected and connected in the Williamsport community. Julia Collins died on November 25, 1865. She only became a member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church on her deathbed. As reported in The Christian Recorder, she left \\"motherless children,\\" which leads to speculations that she was in her twenties when she died.\\"A Letter from Hollidaysburg Circuit,\\" Christian Recorder, Dec. 23, 1865. These children have been identified as Sarah and Annie Collins. Since Stephen was previously married, the eldest daughter Sarah, born around 1858, was likely not Julia Collins‚Äô natural daughter. Born around 1862, Annie was raised by her grandparents after her mother's death. Annie worked as a domestic, married lumberer John L. Caution in 1884, and died suddenly in 1889. Literary work The dramatic title Collins gave her novel, The Curse of Caste, or The Slave Bride, is in keeping with the drama of the story she tells. Individual chapters of The Curse of Caste were published in the weekly Christian Recorder over a period of eight months in 1865. The story focuses on racial identity, interracial marriage, and the injustices of American slavery and racism. The story abruptly ends just as the plot reaches the climax and resolution, as Collins died of tuberculosis in November, leaving the novel unfinished. In 2006, Oxford University Press published the novel, including an introduction and two alternative endings written by the editors Mitch Kachun and William Andrews. In addition to the novel, The Curse of Caste, Collins published six essays in the Christian Recorder over the course of ten months from April 19, 1864 to January 20, 1865. The essays are titled, \\"Mental Improvement,\\" \\"School Teaching,\\" \\"Intelligent Women,\\" \\"A Letter from Oswego: Originality of Ideas,\\" \\"Life is Earnest,\\" and \\"Memory and Imagination.\\" The first four essays are datelined Williamsport, Pennsylvania, while the fourth and fifth are datelined Oswego and Owego, New York. The essays convey a message of racial uplift and empowerment to the African American community. Literary reception Mitch Kachun, associate professor of history at Western Michigan University \\"rediscovered\\" The Curse of Caste while searching through the microfilm collection of the Christian Recorder. Along with colleague William L. Andrews, Katchun argues that the serialized novel is the first novel written by an African American woman. The pair argue that previous novels written by African American women, such as Our Nig (1859) by Harriet E. Wilson and Harriet Ann Jacobs‚Äôs Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861), are basically autobiographical. During a presentation at Saginaw Valley State University, Kachun remarked how it's unusual that Collins‚Äô characters are allowed to be married and (briefly) happy in a tumultuous America. Kachun speculated that \\"[Collins] is exploring what could be a happy ending, an empowering ending, in which marriage and civility are things that African American women can aspire to.\\" A few scholars argue that Kachun's and Andrews‚Äô statements are inaccurate and presumptuous. Harvard scholar, Henry Louis Gates Jr., counters that many first novels are autobiographical fiction, and that Our Nig by Harriet E. Wilson (which he brought to light in 1982) is the first novel by an African American woman. Gates also retorts that the book is not \\"rediscovered\\" as he published it in microfiche form in 1989 as part of \\"The Black Periodical Fiction Project.\\" At Gates‚Äô request, Andrews and Kachun added a footnote in the book acknowledging this. Sven Birkerts, a New York Times book reviewer, argues that the \\"sketchily developed romance\\" novel is simply not \\"worthy of the canonically foundational ‚Äòfirst novel by an African- American woman slot.‚Äô\\" He believes arguing the importance of this unfinished and editorially presumptuous novel takes away from the achievement of vital African American literary works.\\" No matter the stances on the classification of The Curse of Caste, scholars believe the novel provides significant views on racial identity, interracial romance, hidden African ancestry, and gender ideologies. The story illuminates how racial prejudice persisted across generations and has the power to deprive people of trust social and emotional freedom. Veta Smith Tucker of the African American Review states that the lack of knowledge about Collins gives scholars great opportunity for discovery and calls the piecing together of facts \\"literary archeology.\\" Collins used the vehicle of the Christian Recorder to share her voice with a broad audience, and Tucker hopes Collins‚Äô messages of self-improvement, racial uplift, and gender ideologies resonate with people today. In June 2010, a Pennsylvania State Historical Marker was installed on Williamsport‚Äôs River Walk, near the presumed site of Collins‚Äô home and school, to recognize the importance of her life and work.

Background  Beginning in 1962, under the sponsorship of the Lutheran World Federation and the Reformed World Alliance, representatives from the Lutheran Church in America, the American Lutheran Church, the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., the Presbyterian Church in the U.S., the Reformed Church in America and the United Church of Christ met to discuss their differences and agreements regarding the doctrine of the Lord‚Äôs Supper.Klug, Eugene, The Springfielder Volume XXXVI, No. 2, September, 1972 ‚ÄúFrom Marburg Revisited to Princeton ‚Äò72‚Äù http://www.ctsfw.net/media/pdfs/klugmarburgrevisited.pdf, pgs. 110 & 111 In 1966, the book Marburg Revisited, the title referring to the Marburg Colloquy of 1529, was published, claiming that ‚ÄúAs a result of our studies and discussions we see no insuperable obstacles to pulpit and altar fellowship and, therefore, we recommend to our parent bodies that they encourage their constituent churches to enter into discussions looking forward to intercommunion and the fuller recognition of one another's ministries.\\" Klug, Eugene, The Springfielder Volume XXXVI, No. 2, September, 1972 ‚ÄúFrom Marburg Revisited to Princeton ‚Äò72‚Äù http://www.ctsfw.net/media/pdfs/klugmarburgrevisited.pdf, pg. 111 While a second round of dialogues between 1972 and 1974, made little progress, a third round (1981-1983) produced joint statements on the Lord‚Äôs Supper, justification and ministry, published in A Call To Action in 1984. Two years later, representatives reached the conclusion that the Reformed and Lutheran denominations recognize each other as churches that preach the Gospel and administer the sacraments in accordance to Christ‚Äôs command, recommendations which were adopted by the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) (which has come about due to a merger between the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. in 1983) and the Reformed Church in America in 1986, and would be adopted by the United Church of Christ in 1989. For their parts, while the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches and the American Lutheran Church also adopted the resolutions in 1986, although the Lutheran Church in America was more reluctant to adopt the resolutions, recommending further dialogues.\\"A History of Lutheran/Reformed Dialogues\\" https://www.rca.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=431 In 1988, the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, the American Lutheran Church and the Lutheran Church in America merged to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and at their constituting meeting, it was voted to continue discussions with the PCUSA, RCA and United Church of Christ, forming the Lutheran-Reformed Committee for Theological Conversations in order to discuss doctrinal condemnations in the Lutheran ‚ÄúFormula of Concord‚Äù and issues relating to Christology, the Lord‚Äôs Supper and predestination. The committee released their report ‚ÄúA Common Calling: The Witness of our Reformation Churches in North America Today‚Äù in 1992, which stated that there were no ‚Äúchurch dividing differences‚Äù and unaminmously recommended > ‚ÄúThat the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church > (U.S.A.), the Reformed Church in America (RCA), and the United Church of > Christ (UCC) declare that they are in full communion with one another.

Eventually, after some reluctance from those in the RCA about entering into full communion with the UCC due to issues regarding homosexuality, in 1997, A Formula of Agreement was adopted by the denominations. Content  The formulas affirm that the denominations are in full communion with each other. Full communion is defined as that the denominations > \\" * recognize each other as churches in which the gospel is rightly preached > and the sacraments rightly administered according to the Word of God; * > withdraw any historic condemnation by one side or the other as inappropriate > for the life and faith of our churches today; * continue to recognize each > other's Baptism and authorize and encourage the sharing of the Lord's Supper > among their members; * recognize each others' various ministries and make > provision for the orderly exchange of ordained ministers of Word and > Sacrament; * establish appropriate channels of consultation and decision- > making within the existing structures of the churches; * commit themselves > to an ongoing process of theological dialogue in order to clarify further > the common understanding of the faith and foster its common expression in > evangelism, witness, and service; * pledge themselves to living together > under the Gospel in such a way that the principle of mutual affirmation and > admonition becomes the basis of a trusting relationship in which respect and > love for the other will have a chance to grow.\\" Noting overall theological disagreements in the past in their confessional documents, the formulas state that ‚Äúas a consequence of doctrinal agreement, it is stated that the ‚Äòcondemnations expressed in the confessional documents no longer apply to the contemporary doctrinal position of the assenting churches‚Äô \\" (Leuenberg Agreement, IV.32.b). Theologically, the biggest issue has been disagreements between the Lutherans and the Reformed stem from disagreements over the sacrament of the Lord‚Äôs Supper, with the Lutherans arguing that Christ is physically present in the elements, whereas the Reformed have argued that Christ is spiritually present. The formulas note that ‚Äúthe theological conversations acknowledged that it has not been possible to reconcile the confessional formulations from the sixteenth century with a ‚Äòcommon language. . .which could do justice to all the insights, convictions, and concerns of our ancestors in the faith‚Äô (A Common Calling, p. 49). However, the theological conversations recognized these enduring differences as acceptable diversities with regard to the Lord's Supper.‚Äù Citing the Leuenberg Agreement of 1973 made between several Lutheran and Reformed churches in Europe, it notes that: : \\"Lutheran and Reformed Christians agree that: In the Lord's Supper the risen Christ imparts himself in body and blood, given up for all, through his word of promise with bread and wine. He thereby grants us forgiveness of sins and sets us free for a new life of faith. He enables us to experience anew that we are members of his body. He strengthens us for service to all people. (The official text reads, 'Er starkt uns zum Dienst an den Menschen,' which may be translated 'to all human beings') (Leuenberg Agreement, II.2.15). When we celebrate the Lord's Supper we proclaim the death of Christ through which God has reconciled the world with himself. We proclaim the presence of the risen Lord in our midst. Rejoicing that the Lord has come to us, we await his future coming in glory (Leuenberg Agreement, II.2.16)‚Äù \\"A Formula of Agreement Between the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Reformed Church in America, and the United Church of Christ on Entering into Full Communion on the Basis of A Common Calling\\" https://www.rca.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=434 (retrieved Nov. 13th, 2013) In regards to historical disagreements over double vs. single predestination, the formulas state that Reformed and the Lutherans can agree that salvation by grace alone through faith alone and that ‚ÄúAlthough Lutherans and Reformed have different emphases in the way they live out their belief in the sovereignty of God's love, they agree that ‚ÄòGod's unconditional will to save must be preached against all cultural optimism or pessimism‚Äô (A Common Calling, p. 54). It is noted that \\"‚Äòa common language that transcends the polemics of the past and witnesses to the common predestination faith of Lutheran and Reformed Churches has emerged already in theological writings and official or unofficial statements in our churches‚Äô (A Common Calling, page 55)‚Äù. Exchange of ministers  The Formula of Agreement allows for ‚Äúan orderly exchange of ministers of word and sacrament‚Äù between the PCUSA, ELCA, UCC or RCA. A minister wishing to transfer to another denomination must be educated in their own tradition before transferring to a church in another tradition and it must be done at the invitation of the receiving church and with the consent of the sending church ‚ÄúA Formula of Agreement: the Orderly Exchange of Ministers of Word and Sacrament‚Äù (Office of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), 2000), pg. 3 http://images.rca.org/docs/ministry/FormulaOfAgreement.pdf , retrieved Nov. 14th, 2013 Each denomination has established procedures for allowing ministers from other denominations to serve in their denomination, and the agreement guarantees that each denomination‚Äôs polity will be respected.\\"Orderly Exchange of Ministers\\" pg. 3 Controversy  The fellowship between the denominations has remained controversial. The Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod has condemned the agreement, arguing that it jettisons the Lutheran confessional standards as laid out in the Book of Concord, as the Lutheran and the Reformed views of the supper are irreconcilable.The Formula of Agreement in Confessional Lutheran Perspective The Commission on Theology and Church Relations The Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod, 1999; retrieved November 22nd, 2013 www.lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&id;=338 One of the other larger issues has to do with diverging stances on human sexuality, as the Reformed Church in America officially does not affirm homosexuality. Even as the Formula of Agreement was being drafted, some in the Reformed Church in America objected to the agreement with the United Church of Christ because of their more progressive stance on homosexuality. The ELCA's subsequent decision in 2009 to allow homosexuals to serve as clergy prompted some conservatives in the RCA to call for the RCA's withdrawal from the Formula of Agreement.\\"Reformed Body Says Lutheran Gay Vote Does Not Impair Partnership\\" Lilian Kwon, The Christian Post.

His research focuses on closed ecological system research, ecological engineering, restoration of damaged ecosystems, and wastewater recycling. The founding director of the Institute of Ecotechnics in 1973, Nelson was one of the eight original crew members of Biosphere 2 in 1991 and served as the Director of Earth and Space Applications for the project until 1994.  Life and career  Nelson was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He majored in philosophy and pre-med at Dartmouth College and received his BA summa cum laude in 1968. After a stint in New York City working as a taxi driver, he arrived at the Synergia Ranch in New Mexico. The ranch, named for Buckminster Fuller's concept of synergy, was founded by John Allen and owned by Allen's wife Marie Harding. Its ranch hands also made furniture and pottery, studied ecology, and gave theatrical performances, occasionally touring under the name Theater of All Possibilities. It was at the ranch that the Institute of Ecotechnics was founded in 1973 with Nelson as its director. Nelson measuring soil moisture in Biosphere 2 during its 1991-1993 closure. The Institute of Ecotechnics, which described itself as an ecological think tank was financed by Ed Bass, who also funded the Biosphere 2 project. In 1986, Nelson and John Allen had co-authored Space Biospheres, which outlined the plans for the biosphere and its scientific rationale. Nelson was one of the original eight crew members who remained in the closed environment of the Biosphere from 1991 until 1993 and was responsible for the animal fodder systems, managing the wilderness sections, and coordinating the transfer of data from Biosphere. After the initial Biosphere 2 experiment ended in 1993, Nelson and his fellow crew member Abigail Alling published Life Under Glass: The Inside Story of Biosphere. Nelson then began graduate studies at the University of Arizona's School of Renewable Natural Resources, receiving his MSc in 1995. In the interim, disputes over the management of the next phase of the Biosphere project in 1994 had led to its financial backer Ed Bass placing the project into temporary receivership and relieving the project's chief management of their duties, including Nelson who was the Director of Earth and Space Applications. Nelson went on to study environmental engineering science under Howard T. Odum at the University of Florida's Center for Wetlands, and received his PhD in 1998 with a dissertation entitled Limestone wetland mesocosm for recycling saline wastewater in Coastal Yucatan, Mexico. Nelson continues to publish papers on ecosystem research and engineering in journals such as Advances in Space Research and Life Sciences in Space Research and remains Chairman of the Institute of Ecotechnics. He resumed the post in 1982 after a seven-year period when it was run by Randall Gibson. Over the years, his work at the Institute has included the founding in 1978 of the eco-station and desert reclamation project Birdwood Downs located at Meda Station in Western Australia and in 1983 of Las Casas de la Selva, a rainforest enrichment and sustainable forestry project in Puerto Rico. He is also the founder and principal of Wastewater Gardens International, a company which develops and promotes constructed wetlands.  Publications  Nelson's publications include: Nelson, M., W.

The fungus causes lesions and tissue death on pecan twigs, petioles, leaves, nuts and shucks beginning in early spring, with multiple cycles of infection repeating until late summer. Wind and rain spread the fungus to a susceptible host. Control of the disease is achieved by fungicide, sanitation and, in some cases, quarantine.Smith, S., & Vann, S. (2013).

Since its first description in 1882, the pecan scab fungus has been reclassified ten times, with other names such as Fusicladium caryigenum, Cladosporium effusum and Cladosporium caryigenum commonly associated with the fungus. Pecan scab lesions caused by Venturia effusa on pecan leaves. Host and symptoms Venturia effusa has a narrow host range, and its most economically significant host is the pecan, Carya illinoinensis. The pathogen can also infect other trees in the genera Carya and Juglans (walnut). Common symptoms of pecan scab disease include light brown to black lesions on stems, leaves, shucks and nuts. Visible circular lesions begin to develop 7 to 14 days after infection, and first appear on young tissue as olive-green spots that turn black as they age. Older lesions may crack and fall out of the leaf- blade creating a shot-hole affect. Lesions range in diameter from a pinpoint to about one-quarter inch, and occur most numerously along leaf veins. Numerous lesions can coalesce into larger dead areas on infected tissue and can cause early leaf loss. Lesions on nuts may look sunken and distort nut morphology. They may also cause nuts to shrivel or drop prematurely. Lesions are amphigenous, meaning they grow on both sides of leaves.Mycobank. (2013). Retrieved from http://www.mycobank.org/BioloMICS.aspx?Link=T&TableKey;=14682616000000063&Rec;=14612&Fields;=All Disease cycle Venturia effusa over-winters in plant debris, such as shucks, leaf petioles and stems, as well as in lesions on the tree from the previous season. It survives as stromata, a tight mat of fungal material that lives within tissue. In the spring time, hyphae in the stromata germinate to produce solitary or loosely fasciculate conidiophores which produce conidia (asexual spores) in simple or branched chains. Conidia are dentical-like and have unthickened walls. Conidia are moved by wind and water to a susceptible host, but they cannot germinate and infect without several hours of sustained wet weather. Afternoon rain storms and wet conditions overnight provide ideal conditions for germination. Conidia germinate and form germ tubes which enter the host through stomata or through the cuticle, before forming intramatrical mycelia which moves through the plant and establishes the new infection. These mycelia give rise to further conidiophores and conidia, allowing for many infection cycles in each season. Venturia effusa commonly reproduces asexually via conidia, but it may also produce a teleomorph stage like other Dothideomycetes in which pseudothecia carrying asci and sexual ascospores grow out of the hyphae. This allows for sexual reproduction and genetic recombination of the pathogen. The teleomorph stage, however, is very rare and literature on its characteristics are lacking. The severity of infection depends in part on the timing of inoculation. A study by Gottwald and Bertrand in 1982 found that trees inoculated after late June, when the endocarp (shell) begins to form, suffered much less damage to nuts than those inoculated in May or early June during nut set. Trees in the later category experienced the greatest disease severity around mid-season (mid-July through August), roughly 1.5 to 2 months after inoculation. Environment A conducive environment for the propagation of pecan scab requires wet weather. For the spores to inoculate the host, there must be a period of wet weather in order for the infection to occur. The amount of rainfall is not as important as the frequency of rainfall and length of time that the leaves and fruit stay wet. For example, the optimal time for a rain would be right before dusk because the plant will stay wet overnight, thus increasing the period of time the pathogen has to infect the plant. The temperature is not as critical of a factor in the environment.Vann, S. (n.d.). Home pecan diseases and control. Informally published manuscript, Division of Agriculture, University of Arkansas, Little Rock, AR, Retrieved from http://www.uaex.edu/Other_Areas/publications/PDF/FSA-7540.pdf The pathogen thrives in adequate temperatures of spring and summer ranging from 20‚Äì30¬∞ Celsius (68‚Äì86 ¬∞F). When there is a pecan orchard, cultural practices that increase the humidity levels also provide a good environment for the pathogen. These practices include close tree spacing, low limbs, and dense ground vegetation. Management Although resistant varieties of pecan trees are available, such as the Elliot Pecan tree, historically the pathogen has overcome the resistance due to its ability to quickly change over time. Because resistance has been ineffective, the main control of the pathogen is fungicide application for commercial farming. Some commercial fungicides used are Pristine¬Æ, Sovran¬Æ, Quash¬Æ, and Headline SC¬Æ. For the fungicides to be effective, they must be sprayed before inoculation/infection period. The exact time for the first spray depends on the chemical used, but an example time periods is when the buds are bursting and the first leaves begin to show. The fungicide should be sprayed sufficiently in order to completely cover the tree. The rates per acre of application range from 2‚Äì5 fluid ounces on developing trees to 8‚Äì12 fluid ounces on mature trees. They are protectant fungicides, meaning that they work best to prevent disease from happening when sprayed before any disease is detected. The idea of \\"getting ahead\\" of the pathogen is key to preventing a large loss of production.Smith, D. (2010). Pecan scab update. Informally published manuscript, Entomology and Plant Pathology, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, Retrieved from http://entoplp.okstate.edu/pddl/pddl/2010/PA9-27.pdf After this initial spray, the plant tissue is still susceptible to infection making it necessary for multiple sprays to occur during a growing season. The number of applications during a season depends on the weather, amount and virulence of the pathogen, and susceptibility of the cultivars. Generally, the cultivars are sprayed about every two to four weeks of its growing season in spring and summer. This ends up being about 5‚Äì7 sprays per growing season. The fungicide needs to be sprayed in a concentration high enough to prevent infection and to completely cover the trees. The fungicides have not been shown to have any adverse effects outside of the warnings of all chemical control impacts on environmental and human health.European Union, Invasive Species Compendium. (2013). Fusicladium effusum. Retrieved from CABI website: http://www.cabi.org/isc/?compid=5&dsid;=13719&loadmodule;=datasheet&page;=481&site;=144 Although fungicide application is effective in the commercial setting, the cost of the chemicals and equipment is usually not practical for noncommercial farming such as orchards and small farms. In the noncommercial case, good sanitation practices may help prevent the disease. Removal and destruction of all fallen leaves, shucks, and nuts each winter or early spring helps reduce tissue that is often involved in the primary infection. Also, selective pruning of infected tissue during the dormant season may help reduce the level of scab disease. A recent study has been done to test if phosphite, a chemical with the potential to induce systemically acquired resistance (SAR), could be used as a potential control for pecan scab. The results showed that in the early stages of the growing season, phosphite was comparable to current fungicide control, however may not be as effective in providing elongated protection in the later growing season.

In addition, the cost of fungicide application reduces the profitability of pecan production. Because of the cost of fungicides, pecan scab also prevents small orchards and yard trees from producing high quality nuts. The average cost of pecans ranges from $2.86‚Äì$3.50 per pound.Rafanan, M.

One of his three sons from his unidentified wife was Ladislaus III, voivode of Transylvania (1295‚Äì1314) who became one of the most powerful oligarchs during the interregnum after the death of king Andrew III and ruled Transylvania de facto independently until his death in 1315.Mark√≥ 2006, p. 282.

As a youth he wanted to be a bullfighter but gave this up when he found he could sell figures he made. While never formally trained, he had over seventy individual exhibitions of his work in Mexico and the United States and his work can be found in prominent public and private collections. Life Ju√°rez was born in San Juan Teotihuac√°n, the modern town near the archeological site of the same name north of Mexico City . As a child, he reproduced in clay the pre Hispanic figurines he found in the countryside. His life since very young, was tied to livestock. As a boy he would lead his father's bull down the main street to water, even though the animal weighed over 800 kilos, proud he could do this. He also had his own horse on which he took long rides. He lived close to the slaughterhouse and some of his friends jumped the fence to fight the bulls. He participated as well and decided to become a bullfighter. As such he was gored several times, once seriously, which resulted in two weeks in the hospital. This led his family to oppose this activity but Ju√°rez was stubborn and continued. It was only when he was stuck in Guadalajara without money for food, he decided to change. Bored, he made a clay figure of Lorenzo Garza, a noted Mexican matador. His friends were surprised by its quality and suggested he sell it, which it did, quickly. It was followed by many more and helped him to survive. While he continued to develop his art, he never studied formally. He died in 2008. Career Pigeon in bronze. He began his art career in 1961 and since then has had over seventy individual exhibitions and participated in over forty collective ones.

A piece called ‚ÄúCaballo con jinete‚Äù can be found at the Swedish embassy in Mexico and in 1998, the Universidad de las Am√©ricas Pueblas opened the Heriberto Ju√°rez Sculpture Garden which contains over 100 of his pieces. 1n 1999, two books on his work were published: Los dibujos de Heriberto Ju√°rez and Heriberto Ju√°rez, Plater√≠a. In 2008, Heriberto Ju√°rez. Escultura y pintura was published. In recognition of his work, Ju√°rez was accepted as a member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana . In 2010 the Museo Regional de la Laguna in Torre√≥n, Coahuila had a retrospective of his work, specially to allow children and the visually-impaired touch the sculptures. Artistry Los Ju√°rez Although he had no formal artistic training, he did learn from sculptor Juan Soriano and from a carver named Juan de la Cruz. However, most of his learning came from trips to different countries, studying the works of the Greeks, Egyptians, Mesoamericans, Henry Moore, Picasso and Rodin . Women are depicted with curved shapes, especially to emphasize the maternal in poses that create concave spaces for balance. He recalls ‚ÄúMy mother‚Äôs live had to be divided among her eight children. I think that is why I like to interpret women in my sculptures. The female figure allows me to express what I admired as a boy: tenderness, strength, femininity, sensuality.‚Äù He transferred much of what he learned as a bullfighter to his art, learning as much as he can about his subject before working on the piece. When he creates male forms, they generally resemble Atlas, a horse rider or a matador, using lives and concepts related to force. Common elements in his work include pigeons, the human figure, horses and especially bulls. Despite the short list, none of these depictions repeat. All are distinct. He has particularly depicted bulls in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, textures and colors. Pigeons come in second place which he generally depicts in simple lines in materials such as bronze, marble and onyx . He advocated that Mexican art should reflect Mexican thought and life.

Career  Reedy began his career at the NOSC (US Naval Ocean Systems Center) where he worked on silicon CMOS processing. In 1988, Reedy along with NOSC colleagues Mark Burgener and Graham Garcia published a research paper in IEEE Electron Device Letters that proved that SOS films thinned to 100 nm were suitable for application to high- performance down-scaled CMOS circuitry. It was with this advancement that Reedy decided to commercialize the technology. Their research findings were instrumental to the industry and have since been cited in 13 IEEE research papers and 58 patents.See 'Cited by' section of In 1990, Reedy co-founded Peregrine Semiconductor to commercialize the advanced technology. Peregrine became a fabless chip designer that was publicly traded on the NASDAQ until the company was acquired by Murata in December 2014 for $471 million.

It can be thought of as a continuation in the development of the Misesian system of social science. In particular, it provides further epistemological support for his earlier works, esp. Human Action. Most notably, Mises elaborates on methodological dualism, develops the concept of thymology ‚Äì a historical branch of the sciences of human action ‚Äì and presents his critique of Marxist materialism. Furthermore, Mises puts forward a theory of knowledge and value. He later explores and critically analyzes paradigms of thought like determinism, materialism, dialectic materialism, historicism, scientism, positivism, behaviorism and psychology. He argues that these schools of thought ‚Äì some politically motivated,Mises. (1957). Theory and history, pp. 26, 134. others blinded by dogmatismid. pp. 30, 77, 111, 247. ‚Äì have committed epistemological and methodological blunders and are not conducive to a scientific understanding of human behavior. Economist Murray Rothbard considered Theory and History to be Mises's most overlooked work.id. pp. xi- xix  Synopsis  Mises presents the book in four parts. Introduction and Part One ‚Äì Value: The first part sets the overall theme of the book with Mises introducing the concept of methodological dualism. He then expounds a theory of value that is central throughout. Regarding his view on science ‚Äì as systematic body of knowledge, of both natural and social phenomena ‚Äì as a means to successful action in the world, Mises argues that in order to properly understand human behavior we must attribute ‚Äì as a methodological resort ‚Äì volition and purpose to human behaviour. Mises considers this the epistemological and methodological basis of the sciences of human action. The branch that deals with the logical implications of action as such is called praxeology. Part Two ‚Äì Determinism and Materialism: In the second part, Mises weighs in on the free will vs. determinism controversy and comments that the long historical debates did little to settle the problems at hand. He argues that while the natural sciences, in discovering scientific laws, must presuppose a strict regularity in the occurrence of causes and effects, i.e. determinism, such a presupposition cannot be held in the case of human action. He argues further that the social sciences must take thoughts, ideas, and judgments of value as ultimately given in the analysis of human action. Our ignorance of the origins and causes of these phenomena, Mises argues, forces us ‚Äì at least for the time being ‚Äì to adopt a dualistic approach. He contends that attempts to find the origins and causes of these phenomena are vain, as is the task of all varieties of materialism.id. p. 69. Mises then turns his attention to the doctrine of materialism, more specifically, that of Marxist dialectical materialism. Part Three ‚Äì Epistemological Problems of History: The third part deals with the logical and epistemological problems of historical analysis. Mises explains the individualistic character of historical human events. He argues that the historian must ultimately face ‚Äì when tracing back the causal factors behind past human action ‚Äì a point at which no further reduction is possible, i.e. the ideas and actions of individuals. This, he claims, is the \\"ultimate given of history\\".id. pp. 183‚Äì8. In spite of the individuality of historical events, Mises still insists there are general laws of human behaviour but that they are praxeological laws, i.e. a priori, not historical laws, i.e. a posteriori. However, historicism, according to Mises, claimed there were no general laws ‚Äì especially economic laws ‚Äì of human behavior. Mises then enters into a critique of historicism. Mises also addresses the challenges of scientism in the context of social science, namely the application of positivism and behaviorism in the realm of human action. However, more noteworthy is Mises's presentation of thymology, a historical branch of the sciences of human action. Mises argues that thymology is what everybody resorts to when trying to understand and anticipate the historical and future actions of their fellow men, and is particularly useful to the historian. He then expounds the scope of thymology and its relation to praxeology. Part Four ‚Äì The Course of History: In the final part of his treatise, Mises dissects and critiques various speculations and interpretations of history, including a common interpretation of modern Western civilization. He also comments on his observation regarding society's move away from classical liberalism, freedom, and capitalism towards socialism and totalitarianism. Moreover, Mises notes the rising ideology of wealth and income equality and speculates on its origins. He argues that rising anti- capitalistic ideology is fostering a present trend toward the impoverishment of society. He criticizes the notion of society's inevitable \\"trend toward progress\\",id. pp. 367-70. and argues that the evolution of society and civilization is predicated ‚Äì not on an automatic and inevitable path ‚Äì but on the underlying ideology which can, at any time, change. To this point, Mises closes with some remarks on the uncertainty of the future and the neglect of ideological factors that can give rise to civilization but also stamp it out.

History Captain Berry was born at the seaport of Ilfracombe, in Devonshire, and early resolved on the life of a sailor. He went to sea with an uncle for a couple of voyages, and amongst his companions on board ship he was known as the boy who did not drink. He was a determined teetotaler and fervent religious adherent. He married when a comparatively young man, and subsequently accepted the position of missionary on the east coast of Scotland for the Scottish Coast Mission Committee. Whilst in that position he met Captain George Johnston, who was visiting Scotland for the purpose of obtaining a steamboat for the River Murray trade. Johnston had secured the boat and the crew, and offered the captaincy to Berry. He had not been at sea for many years, but he was anxious to see Australia, and on 1 February 1866 he sailed the steamer Murray, set up as a schooner, for Australia and Victor Harbor was reached on 17 June. In 1867 Captain Berry accepted the position of city missionary at the Adelaide City Mission, the centre of its operations then being in Ackland Street, off Pirie Street east, where he discharged his duties efficiently. He took a keen interest in the Adelaide Benevolent and Strangers' Friend Society, and at one period also acted as religious instructor to the Yatala Labor Prison, which he visited weekly. Captain Berry labored steadily on at the Ackland street Mission among the poor and needy in the city, and had the satisfaction of seeing it grow to such an extent that larger premises became necessary. The commodious building on the west side of Light Square was erected; the Hon. John Darling contributing ¬£500 to defray the cost. He was city missionary for 20 years, until a shrinkage in subscriptions was used by the committee to cut his salary then installed him in the newly established East Adelaide City Mission, a post he only relinquished when the infirmities of age compelled him to retire. He died at his home in Gilberton. His son may have been the secretary of the Port Adelaide Society of Marine Engineers.

Press Center  6/4/2013U.S. blacklists global network of Iranian 'front' companies  Reuters  4 June 2013 retrieved 22 November 2016 (, Set√¢d-e Ejr√¢y-ye Farm√¢n-e Em√¢m), also known as the Executive Headquarters of Imam's Directive or simply Setad, is a parastatal in the Islamic Republic of Iran, under direct control of the Supreme Leader of Iran. It was created from thousands of properties confiscated in the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. A Reuters investigation found that the organization built \\"its empire on the systematic seizure of thousands of properties belonging to ordinary Iranians\\", also seizing property from members of religious minorities, business people and Iranians living abroad; at times falsely claiming that the properties were abandoned. Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini originally ordered three of his aides to take care of and distribute the confiscated property to charity. However, under Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the organization has been acquiring property for itself. It has grown into a major center of economic power in Iran. Holdings include large amounts of real estate and 37 companies, covering nearly every sector of Iranian industry, including finance, oil, and telecommunications. While its accounts are secret even to the Iranian parliament, a 2013 estimate by Reuters news agency put the total value of Setad's holdings at $95 billion (made up of about $52 billion in real estate and $43 billion in corporate holdings). In 2013, the U.S. Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on the organization and some of its corporate holdings, referring to it as \\"a massive network of front companies hiding assets on behalf of ‚Ä¶ Iran's leadership.\\" History The organization was launched on April 26, 1989, when the first Supreme Leader of Iran, \\"The Imam\\" Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a two-paragraph order directed three of his aides to manage, maintain or sell properties confiscated or \\"supposedly abandoned during the chaotic years following\\" the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The order called for the implementation of Article 49 of Constitution of Iran under which the government had the right to confiscate all wealth accumulated through illegal means, restore \\"it to its legitimate owners\\"; and if those owners could not be identified, entrust it \\"to the public treasury\\". Aides of Khomeini ‚Äî Habibollah Asgaroladi, Mehdi Karroubi and Hassan Sane'i ‚Äî were appointed by him in the order,ÿ™ÿπ€å€åŸÜ ŸÜŸÖÿß€åŸÜÿØ⁄ØÿßŸÜ ÿ®ÿ±ÿß€å ÿ±ÿ≥€åÿØ⁄Ø€å ÿ®Ÿá Ÿàÿ¨ŸàŸá Ÿà ÿßŸÖŸàÿßŸÑ ŸÖÿ¨ŸáŸàŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿßŸÑ⁄© Ÿà... imam-khomeini.ir 6 ÿßÿ±ÿØ€åÿ®Ÿáÿ¥ÿ™ 1368 / 19 ÿ±ŸÖÿ∂ÿßŸÜ 1409 accessed 21 November 2016 to take over all \\"sales, servicing and managing\\" of assets \\"of unknown ownership and without owners.\\" The aides were to help \\"as much as possible\\" seven bonyads and charities specified by Khomeini, such as the Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs, State Welfare Organization of Iran. The \\"families of the martyrs, veterans, the missing, prisoners of war and the downtrodden\\" were to be given aid. According to Reuters, one of the three co-founders of Setad, Mehdi Karoubi, wrote in 2009 that the organization was originally intended \\"to operate for no more than two years\\". Khomeini died about a month after giving his order, and the organization did not disband but developed and grew for more than two decades into a vast parastatal known as the Setad Ejraiye Farmane Hazrate Emam - \\"the Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam\\" ‚Äî under the second Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei. According to Reuters, the organization has since been acquiring property for itself through a systematic seizure of thousands of properties belonging to ordinary Iranians, religious minorities, business people and Iranians living abroad; at times falsely claiming that the properties were abandoned. Leadership Mohammad Shariatmadari was appointed as the leader of Setad by order of Ali Khamenei on 1994. Among Iranians who have served in running of, or overseeing of, Setad is Mohammad Javad Iravani, who took over as head of Setad in 1997. In 2007, Mohammad Mokhber began acting as CEO. In 2009, Mohammad Saeedikia, a former Iranian minister of housing and urban development, was named the chairman of the Setad subsidiary Tadbir Construction Development Group. Aref Norozi served on the board of Tadbir Investment and was head of Setad's real- estate division. As of 2013, Ali Ashraf Afkhami was \\"identified\\" as head of Tadbir Economic Development Group.

PALASH GHOSH International Business Times 05/03/13 retrieved 22 November 2016  Organization  Generally, Setad has consisted of two main foundations: the Barakat Foundation that \\"has the duty of eliminating poverty and empowering poor communities\\" and Tadbir Economic Development Group to \\"set up an investment management firm\\". Barakat Foundation On 11 December 2007, based on the sentence of the second Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, \\"I‚Äôm concerned about solving problems of the deprived classes of the society. For instance, solve problems of 1000 villages completely. How good would it be if 1000 points of the country are solved or 1000 schools are built in the country\\", the Barakat Foundation has been established to solve the problems of in needed people and make habitable the deprived region where poor people live. The Mechanism of Barakat Foundation is summarized in eight steps. First, the region to implement the Poverty Reduction Project is selected. Then, by choosing the consultant (or experts) and holding meetings, studies on the status of capacities of development at the target area and on the basis of the formulation and implementation of the plan, it is considered as the agenda. After completing the establishment mechanism for implementing the plan and ways for Financing support and education steps, the project begins to operate economically and after the evaluation and documentation of the process of carrying out the project, the Barakat Foundation will be removed from the implementation process. Finally, the project is donated to people for economic activity. This process was called Sunshine in order to Poverty Reduction through the participation of local communities. The Foundation mainly has concentrated on the entrepreneurship of needy people. Tadbir Economic Development Group Ten years after establishing EIKO, Tadbir Economic Development Group was founded as the economic group of EIKO. Now it is a stockholder of many oil and non-oil companies. Services EIKO (also known as Setad) is one of the service organizations in Iran, that through the Barakat Foundation has invested 84 trillion Rials for removing poverty and preparing services to poor people in the economic and social area from 20 December 2007. One of the most important measures of the Barakat is the efforts of entrepreneurship in the deprived areas of the country. The foundation has created 322 economic entrepreneurship projects with 58 trillion Rials investment for job opportunity of 198,000 people. Constructing 1030 schools with 8000 classrooms (setting up a contract to construct 1357 school) in the deprived regions has turned Setad as an organization to prepare the educational facility for the poor student. Construction home for low-income (11000 homes) and investing in 110 civil infrastructure projects included water and power supply, road construction,building of cultural and religious accommodation in poor regions of the country (800 Mosques, Prayer Rooms (Mosalla), and residence for religious teachers in remote rural regions, and also constructed centers for religious educations are other efforts of the Barakat Foundation. Establishing 4 centers of Cancer Recognition & Treatment ,along with 11 hospitals, and 153 Health Care Centers in poor regions around the country, Cure the Infertility of young and treat 273 young couples to elimination the infertility are the important actions of Setad to prepare cure services. Also, this organization tries to fight deforestation in Iran, especially in southern provinces like Khuzestan Province, Ilam Province and gardens and Urban Green Space. During the 2019 Iran floods, in order to help to flood-stricken people, EIKO prepared essential equipment for flood-stricken people and furnished facilities (fridges, washing machines, carpets, and other necessary elements) for 15,000 families and provided 4,000 cattle of 9,000 killed by the flood for families living in villages. Some temporary clinics have been established to cure wounded and give medicine. The Barakat Foundation performed most of aids as the representative of EIKO. In other hands, the organization ensured, EIKO will be able to \\"provide some 3,000 job opportunities\\" for citizens. The polypill, drugs to lower blood pressure, is produced in Iran by the support of EIKO was designed 14 years ag and called \\"PolyIran\\". According to the study was conducted by doctors from Tehran University, the University of Birmingham in Britain and other institutions and published by The Lancet, it worked quite well in a new study, slashing the rate of heart attacks by more than half among those who regularly took the pills. The pill in the study, which involved the participation of 6,800 rural villagers aged 50 to 75 in Iran, contained a cholesterol-lowering statin, two blood-pressure drugs and a low-dose aspirin. \\"Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order\\" has also done other services for needy people, such as: the distribution of 2,000 dowries and 1,000 stationery packages for poor people, giving 3,000 wheelchairs to needy disabled individuals,3000 wheelchairs ... by Bonyade-Ehsane-Barakat tabnak.ir Retrieved 29 August 2020 preparing 2,000 food packages for Nikshahr students who were involved in nutritional problems, the establishment of \\"Ehsan Sports places\\" in deprived areas, and so on.Construction of rural sports houses in deprived areas of the country eghtesadnews.com Retrieved 29 August 2020 Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order and the Barakat Foundation (in cooperation with the Ministry of Health) have pursued/implemented the issue of Telehealth.

The factory is able to \\"produce 4 million masks per month\\". According to the report of EIKO's officials, the EIKO has provided several medical facilities to fight with the coronavirus pandemic in Iran, including \\" 25 million three-layered and N95 masks, launching a production line of medical masks, production of Iranian test kit for coronavirus infection, research on the medicine of the disease, launching the 4030 phone line with the help of 2,200 doctors and paramedics for answering people‚Äôs questions about coronavirus, making oxygen concentrator (with producing 50 machines every day), production of 400,000 liters of disinfectant gel\\".  Economic activities  Based on the order of Imam Khomeini, the EIKO was responsible to manage properties that had been abandoned during following years of the 1979 Islamic Revolution and consume them for charity aids. In other words, Setad is described as an organization for custody of \\"the properties with no owners\\". To organize such these properties, In Iran Islamic Revolutionary Court issues the final confiscation order and Setad attends to the management and disposal in any form. In 2013, Reuters news agency reported that the conglomerate has been built on \\"the systematic seizure of thousands of properties belonging to ordinary Iranians\\", not only the officially condemned Bahais, but \\"Shi'ite Muslims, business people and Iranians living abroad\\",but this claim only functions as a muffled disclaimer. Owners of confiscated property complain that Setad is a \\"methodical moneymaking scheme\\" using court orders obtained \\"under false pretenses to seize properties\\". The owners of the property are then pressured \\"to buy the property back or pay huge fees to recover them\\". In expanding its corporate holdings, Setad has acquired dozens of Iranian companies and stakes in other companies both private and public.Revealed: Iranian supreme leader‚Äôs $95 billion business empire  Reuters Exclusive  english.alarabiya.net 11 November 2013 retrieved 22 November 2016 Setad officials state that their assets have been acquired legitimately, and part of the profits from acquisition go to charity. One of the owners is Vahdat-e-Hagh who claims that she lost three apartments in a multi-story building in Tehran, ‚Äúbuilt with the blood of herself and her husband.‚Äù She also says her late husband Hussein was imprisoned in 1981 because he began working for a gas company that had been set up to assist unemployed members of the Baha‚Äôi faith, and finally executed a year later but According to Reuters reporters Hussein had been a lieutenant in the military regime of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and by this way could get three apartments. As of 2008, Setad's real estate holding was reportedly worth about $52 billion. The organization regularly conducts large auctions of its real estate - at least 59 as of November 2013. In one auction in May 2013, \\"nearly 300 properties\\" where for sale, \\"the required opening bids totaled about $88 million\\". Setad's stakes in publicly traded companies totaled nearly $3.4 billion as of 2013. It controls many businesses in which it holds very small stakes. In one case, it \\"transformed\\" the formerly liberal, privately owned Parsian Bank‚ÄîIran's largest non-state bank in 2006‚Äîwith new managers, a new strict dress code, etc. despite having only a small stake (estimated to be 16%) in ownership. Rey Investment Co., a Setad subsidiary, has been accused of pressuring Iran‚Äôs biggest dealer of German automobiles to sell its sell his stake in his auto dealership.Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei embroiled in German car dealer row by Damien McElroy, Ahmad Vahdat Daily Telegraph 2 May 2013  retrieved 22 November 2016 One of the group's earliest steps to move beyond holding property took place in 2000 when an investment management firm called Tadbir Investment Co. was set up. By 2006, the organization \\"had amassed billions of dollars\\" in property seized from Iranian citizens, and sanctions against the Islamic Republic by the US and UN were intensifying. The organization determined that large diversified conglomerates, such as the South Korean Chaebol, helped developing economies such as Iran's growing faster. To make a conglomerate out of Setad, the organization expanded its corporate holdings, assisted by helpful bureaucratic and judicial orders. By 2008 one managing director in Setad declared the group had been transformed \\"from a collective that sells property into an economic conglomerate\\". According to Reuters news agency the organization acquired a stake in \\"a major bank\\" (Parsian Bank) in 2007 and in \\"Iran's largest telecommunications company\\" in 2009. In 2010 it took control of Rey Investment Co, valued by the US Treasury Department at $40 billion at the time. By 2013, Setad had real estate, corporate stakes and other assets worth an estimated $95 billion (in comparison, Iran's oil exports for 2012 were worth only $68 billion). It was able to evade the US and UN sanctions with \\"complex network of front companies and subsidiaries\\" in foreign countries. In June 2013 the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Setad itself, which it called \\"a massive network of front companies hiding assets on behalf of ‚Ä¶ Iran's leadership.\\" Political advantage As an organ of the Supreme Leader, Setad is not overseen by the \\"Islamic Consultative Assembly\\" (Iranian Parliament). According to the Reuters, it is the third dimension in Khamenei's power, giving him financial independence from parliament and the national budget, and thus \\"insulating him from Iran's messy factional infighting\\". The \\"revenue stream\\" provided by Setad, \\"helps explain\\" why Khamenei has not only held on for 24 years, but also \\"in some ways has more control than even his revered predecessor\\", Reuters wrote. Tax According to Sayyed Mustafa Sayyed Hashemi, one of the Setad's officials, there is no difference between Setad and a private enterprise. He said that all economic activities of Setad were subject to taxation.He added that the tax had always been paid on time.

The company provides services through cooperation between science-based institutions and scientists based on medicine around the world. It supplies 14 percent of all the country's essential drugs through its 25 subsidiaries. Barakat Pharmaceutical Industrial Town Barakat Pharmaceutical Industrial Town is the first pharmaceutical research town in Iran and registered as the country's first special district of pharmaceutical economic. Also It is the largest Pharmaceutical Industrial Town at West Asia.  Legal protections and issues =Protection from oversight Khamenei, judges, and parliament have issued a series of bureaucratic edicts, constitutional interpretations and judicial decisions over the years bolstering Setad. In addition to a 2008 vote by the Iranian parliament to prohibit itself from monitoring organizations controlled by the supreme leader without his permission. According to Nayyeri, the powerful Guardian Council (whose clerics and jurists \\"directly or indirectly appointed\\" by Khamenei), has issued a declaration that Setad was beyond parliament's authority, Prior to these decisions, Reuters reports that in 1997 after reformist Mohammad Khatami was elected president, a government \\"legal commission\\" declared that the Iranian anti-corruption body known as the General Inspection Office \\"had no right to inspect Setad unless the supreme leader requested it to do so\\" in order to \\"shield Setad from scrutiny\\". Unlike other foundations in Iran, Setad does not include its logo or full name in newspaper advertisements listing auctions of confiscated property. Reuters notes that while the critic (Sazegara, the Guards co- founder) complain that these protections are \\"why no one knows what is going on inside\\" organizations like Setad, Khamenei maintains that \\"No one is above supervision,\\" in the Islamic government, not \\"even the leader ... let alone the organizations linked to the leader,\\" and \\"I welcome supervision, and I am strongly opposed to evading it. Personally, the more supervision I receive, the happier I will be.\\"  Management and disposal of confiscated assets  Under Article 49 of the constitution, the government is obliged to confiscate illegal wealth and return to its owner, \\"and if no such owner can be identified, it must be entrusted to the public treasury\\". The Ministry is overseen by the parliament and president, rather than the Supreme Leader.. However, in 1984 an implementation of Article 49 of the Iranian constitution ratified by Parliament of Iran (when Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was speaker of the parliament) transferred the right to control huge part of public assets, replacing the Treasury with another entity (Setad) outside the government and in direct control of Supreme Leader of Iran. In apparent conflict with this decision, another law was ratified by the parliament in 1992 (when another politician, Mehdi Karroubi was speaker of the parliament), calling for the transfer of confiscated assets to the government and establishing an Organization for Collection and Sale of State-owned Properties of Iran under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance to deal with those assets. Despite clearly transferring control of confiscated assets to the government, this law was never implemented mainly due to circulars issued by chief justice Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi in 2009, and by his successor, chief justice Sadeq Larijani in 2013. (The Chief Justice in Iran is appointed by Supreme Leader of Iran based on Article 110 of Iranian constitution.)  Sanctions  In July 2010, the European Union added the president of Setad, Mohammad Mokhber, to its list of individuals and entities being sanctioning for alleged involvement in \\"nuclear or ballistic missiles activities.\\" Two years later, it removed him from the list without explanation, but allegedly in \\"an attempt to fend off a broader Iranian legal challenge to financial sanctions on Iran's banks and bank directors\\". On 4 June 2013, United States Department of the Treasury took action to \\"expose\\" EIKO (Setad) -- what it called a \\" Massive Network of Front Companies\\"‚Äîand declare it subject to sanctionsTreasury Targets Assets of Iranian Leadership  US Department of the Treasury pursuant to Executive Order 13599,List of Persons Identified as Blocked Solely Pursuant to Executive Order 13599  1/16/2016 US Department of Treasury Resource Center which \\"blocks the property of the Government of Iran\\", (prohibiting \\"U.S. persons from engaging in most transactions\\" with people \\"meeting the definition of Government of Iran\\"). Six months later, in November, Reuters published a three-part investigative article about Setad and Washington based on it, considered setad as the most important one. Also in 2013, the US Treasury Department released a PDF slide \\"depicting a web of 37 companies that it accused of evading international sanctions to enrich powerful Iranians\\". These companies form part of \\"a company called Imam Khomeini‚Äôs Order (EIKO)\\". On 16 January 2016, US government documentOFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL List of Persons Identified as Blocked Solely Pursuant to Executive Order 13599 US Department of the Treasury January 16, 2016, stated EIKO was not on the SDN List (Specially Designated National) nor \\"subject to Secondary Sanctions\\", but that \\"US persons\\" were required to continue to \\"Block the Property and Interests in Property\\" of EIKO (Setad) in accordance with Executive Order 13599. Relation=Khamenei The Reuters investigation of Setad \\"found no evidence that Khamenei is tapping Setad to enrich himself.\\" But Reuters claims that Setad has empowered Khamenei, saying that \\"through Setad, Khamenei has at his disposal financial resources whose value rivals the holdings of the shah, the Western-backed monarch who was overthrown in 1979.\\" Serving the Supreme Leader, Setad helps to fund his Beite Rahbar, (\\"Leader's House\\"). According to an unnamed former employee of Setad who spoke to Reuters, Khamenei appoints the board of directors but delegates management of Setad to others, having himself just one primary interest‚ÄîSetad's \\"annual profits, which he uses to fund his bureaucracy\\". Iranian authorities have stated the findings of the Reuters investigation lack \\"any basis\\", are \\"far from realities\\" and \\"not correct,\\" but have given no further details.  The Revolutionary Guards  Setad and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are both under control of Supreme Leader of Iran and have cooperated in different fields in recent decades. In 2011, a consortium known as Mobin Trust Consortium (TEM) purchased of 51% of shares of Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI). The largest stakeholder of the consortium \\"was a company controlled by the Revolutionary Guards\\", and Setad controlled another 38%. The terms of payment were very favorable‚ÄîTEM was required to make a down payment of only 20% and had eight years to pay the rest of the price. Board of managers of TCI has members from both Setad and IRGC. The takeover of the TCI by the Setad and Revolutionary Guard was assisted by a government regulator, the Iranian Privatisation Organisation (IPO), which eliminated a competing bid for the TCI (by a telecom company called Pishgaman Kavir Yazd Cooperative Co.) the day before the sale of TCI. In 2010, the man responsible for the elimination of the bid‚Äîthe head of IPO at the time of the sale, Gholamreza Heydari Kord Zanganeh‚Äîwas appointed managing director of Tose'e Eqtesad Ayandehsazan Co, or TEACO‚Äîa \\"giant holding company\\" owned by Setad. He was later named chairman of a large pharmaceutical holding company also owned by Setad (Sobhan Pharma Group). Both examples of the \\"revolving door between Setad and Iran's government\\", according to Reuters. In October 2018, an IRGC unit in charge of the body's economic operations announced in a statement it has left Iran's telecommunications industry, after selling its share in a consortium controlling Iran's top telecoms companies and biggest mobile phone operator. ‚ÄúIn line with guidelines of the chief of staff of armed forces, the IRGC‚Äôs Cooperative Foundation sold its share and left Tose‚Äôe Etemad Mobin,‚Äù statement said, as quoted by Sepah News. Reports say it followed after both Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rohani called for the withdrawal of the military from the Iranian economy by selling off their ownership of businesses.

He is the author of I AM: The Power of Discovering Who You Really Are. He currently resides in Arizona with his wife and two children. Early career and spiritual awakening Originally from the suburbs of Chicago, Falco has said that during his childhood he wasn't connected to any religion or spiritual upbringing. He attended Arizona State University, graduated with a business degree and entered the finance world. At the age of 35, he had what he describes as an \\"expansion in awareness,\\" when he realized that money wouldn't solve his problems and he wanted to know the source of true happiness. He has said this awakening wasn't the result of one event, but rather a collection of things that had happened in his life, leading up to a breakthrough. Over the period of six months he had two life- changing experiences, the first being \\"a realization of his infinite nature\\" that was triggered at a financial seminar he attended on the concept of belief, which made him realize he was in control of the experiences of his life, which lead him to ask more questions about the nature of life. This resulted in a second experience which he has said was \\"a radical and profound expansion of consciousness that revealed the reasons for all human behavior, actions and reactions, joy and suffering.\\" This event resulted in the writing of his book. I AM I AM: The Power of Discovering Who You Really Are was published by the Penguin Group on September 2, 2010. The book is intended as a guide to giving people their own expanded awareness regarding their creative natures and purpose, with advice on managing and dealing with stressful situations, overcoming any addictions or challenges and how to take conscious control over the experience of one's life. It's laid out in a progressive movement, divided into \\"what,\\" \\"why\\", \\"how\\" and \\"who\\", in order to establish a foundation of an identity for the reader, concluding with a question and answer process for readers to learn more about themselves and what is possible for them. The book has also been published in Spanish under the title Yo Soy: El Poder de Descubrir Quien Eres. It's now available in 11 countries. Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Chris Archer has credited the book with his success in major league pitching. He first mentioned in an interview for MLB.com that he was reading I AM. Following this interview, he met with Falco over dinner to discuss the book and ask questions, saying \\"it was like a meeting of the minds.\\" Time in a Bottle: Mastering the Experience of Life Falco's second book, entitled Time in a Bottle: Mastering the Experience of Life, was scheduled to be released in April 2014. Speaking, coaching and writing Falco conducts speaking engagements on the topics addressed in I AM. He works with individuals to improvement their performance in sports, business and their personal lives. He also writes regularly for MindBodyGreen.

Jerusalem is in the centre of the map surrounded by the three continents. The B√ºnting Clover Leaf Map, also known as The World in a Cloverleaf, (German title: \\"Die ganze Welt in einem Kleberblat/Welches ist der Stadt Hannover meines lieben Vaterlandes Wapen\\") is an historic mappa mundi drawn by the German Protestant pastor, theologist, and cartographer Heinrich B√ºnting. The map was published in his book Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae (Travel through Holy Scripture) in 1581. Today the map is found within the Eran Laor maps collection in the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem. A mosaic model of the map is installed on the fence of Safra Square at the site of Jerusalem's city hall. The map is a figurative illustration, in the manner of the medieval mappa mundi format, depicting the world via a clover shape. The shape is a symbolisation of the Christian Trinity and a component at the symbolisation of the German city Hanover, where B√ºnting was born. The city of Jerusalem is represented as the centre, surrounded by three central continents, with some more areas of the world being accordingly illustrated separately from the clover. Description The dimension of the map is 38 by 30 centimeters. Jerusalem is in the centre of the map surrounded by the three continents of Asia, Europe and Africa, comprising three leaves of a clover shape. The top- right leaf-shape coloured in green represents Asia, the top-left one coloured in red represents Europe, and the bottom one coloured in yellow represents Africa. The three continents include captions of their various countries and illustrations of some of their cities. Asia includes illustrations of nine cities, Europe includes one illustration of the Italian city Rome, and the continent of Africa includes illustrations of three cities with one being the Egyptian city of Alexandria. The clover is surrounded by the ocean, with its surface including illustrations of sea creatures, monsters, and a ship. England and Denmark‚Äîas perhaps the tip of the entire Nordic countries‚Äîare represented as two island-shapes above Europe‚Äôs leaf. The Red Sea is illustrated between Asia and Africa, painted in red. America is represented as a separated, mostly unrevealed shape at the lower left corner, coloured in green like Asia, with the caption Die Neue Welt (The New World).

Early life and education Tammes was born on 23 June 1871 in Groningen in the Netherlands. She was the daughter of cocoa manufacturer Beerend Tammes and Swaantje Pot. She had a sister and four brothers, and was the aunt of the international lawyer Arnold Tammes. After graduating from the high school for girls in Groningen and taking private lessons in mathematics, physics and chemistry, she enrolled at the University of Groningen in 1890 as one of just eleven female students. She was allowed to attend lectures but not to take any examinations, although she was awarded a teaching diploma. Research career In 1897 Tammes was appointed as an assistant to Jan Willem Moll, professor of botany at the University of Groningen. Through his mediation she was invited in 1898 to spend several months doing research in the laboratory of Hugo de Vries, who had just been appointed adjunct professor of plant physiology at the newly founded University of Amsterdam. There she gained exposure to issues of variability, evolution and genetics. In 1901 she was the first woman in the Netherlands to be awarded a scholarship from the Buitenzorg Fund to conduct botanic research in Java, one of the few to achieve this without being a doctoral student. However, her poor health prevented her from travelling to the Far East and Moll offered her an unpaid place in his laboratory instead. Over the next decade Tammes published several influential works. In Die Periodicit√§t morphologischer Erscheinungen bei den Pflanzen (The frequency of morphological phenomena in plants) she was one of the first Dutch scientists to report on variability, evolution and genetics. Then in 1907 she published Der Flachsstengel: Eine statistisch-anatomische Monographie (The Flax Stem: A statistical anatomical monograph) which used statistics and probability theory to shed light on the inheritance of genetic traits in flax. In 1911 Tammes was granted an honorary doctorate in zoology and botany. From April 1912 she replaced Moll as head of practical microscopy. In 1919 she was appointed extraordinary professor of variability and genetics, the first professor in the Netherlands in this field of research. From 1932 to 1943 Tammes was editor of the journal Genetica. She was also active in the Dutch Association of Women In Higher Education (Vereniging van Vrouwen met Hogere Opleiding or VVAO) and an outspoken opponent of the principle of eugenics. Tammes died in Groningen in 1947.

Archaeologists believe that it was likely erected during the Bronze Age. The Nine Stones is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread through much of Great Britain, Ireland, and Brittany between 3,300 and 900 BCE, during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. The stone circle tradition was accompanied by the construction of timber circles and earthen henges, reflecting a growing emphasis on circular monuments. The purpose of such rings is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that the stones represented supernatural entities for the circle's builders. At least nine of these stone circles are known to have been constructed near modern Dorset. They are smaller than those found elsewhere in Great Britain and are typically built from sarsen stone. Located in the bottom of a narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has a diameter of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen megaliths, with a small opening on its northern side. Two of the stones on the northwestern side of the monument are considerably larger than the other seven. This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in southwestern Scotland, and was potentially a deliberate choice of the circle's builders, to whom it may have had symbolic meaning. Antiquarians like John Aubrey and William Stukeley first took an interest in the site during the eighteenth century. It later received archaeological attention, although it has not been excavated. Local folklore has grown up around the circle, associating it with the Devil and with children petrified into rock. The Nine Stones are regarded as a sacred site by local Druids, who perform religious ceremonies there. The circle is adjacent to the A35 road and encircled by trees. The site is owned by English Heritage and is open without charge to visitors. Location The Nine Stones circle is positioned at the national grid reference 36100904, on the western edge of the village of Winterbourne Abbas in Dorset, Southwest England . Enclosed within iron railings, it is surrounded on three sides by trees and on the northern side by the A35 road. The roots of a beech tree have engulfed two of the megaliths in the circle. The archaeologist Aubrey Burl noted that while \\"this petite ring should be a delight to see\\", it was instead a \\"frustration\\" as a result of its restricted location. He noted that it was difficult to take clear photographs of the site because of the surrounding trees. Context While the transition from the Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic‚Äîwhich took place with the transition from the fourth to the third millennium BCE‚Äîwitnessed much economic and technological continuity, it also saw a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England. By 3,000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased being built, and were instead replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles. These stone rings are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, with the exception of the island's southeastern corner. Stone circles are most densely concentrated in southwestern Britain and on the northeastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen. The tradition of their construction may have lasted for 2,400 years, from 3300 to 900 BCE, with the major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1,300 BCE. The stones These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation. This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence, and may have been deliberately created to serve as what the historian Ronald Hutton describes as \\"silent and empty monuments\\". The archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson suggested that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead and wood with the living. Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities. Burl described modern Dorset as having a \\"thin scatter\\" of stone circles, with nine possible examples known within the county's boundaries. The archaeologist John Gale described these as \\"a small but significant group\\" of such monuments, and all are located within five miles of the sea. All but one‚ÄîRempstone Stone Circle on the Isle of Purbeck‚Äîare located on the chalk hills west of Dorchester. The Dorset circles have a simplistic typology and are of a comparatively small size in comparison to other British stone circles, with none exceeding 28 metres (92 feet) in diameter. All are oval in shape, although they perhaps have been altered from their original form. With the exception of the Rempstone circle, all consist of sarsen stone. Much of this may have been obtained from the Valley of Stones, a location at the foot of Crow Hill near to Littlebredy, which is located within the vicinity of many of these circles. With the exception of the circle at Litton Cheney, none display evidence of any outlying stones or earthworks around the stone circle. The archaeologists Stuart and Cecily Piggott believed that the circles of Dorset were probably of Bronze Age origin, a view endorsed by Burl, who noted that their distribution did not match that of any known Neolithic sites. It is possible that they were not all constructed around the same date, and the Piggotts suggested that while they may well be Early Bronze Age in date, it is also possible that \\"their use and possibly their construction may last into the Middle and even into the Late Bronze Age\\". Their nearest analogies are the circles found on Dartmoor and Exmoor to the west, and the Stanton Drew stone circles to the north. It is also possible that the stone circles were linked to a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period. Description and design Plan of the Nine Stones (based on Piggott and Piggott 1939) The Nine Stones circle has been described by Gale as \\"probably the most well documented of all those surviving in the county\\". It measures 9.1 metres by 7.9 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches) in diameter, as measured from a north-to-south direction. The stones are of sarsen or conglomerate. A gap between two stones on the side of the circle adjacent to the road may suggest that there was once a tenth stone in the monument. Given its dimensions, the circle could only accommodate a small number of individuals assembling within it. Seven of the nine surviving stones are under 90 centimetres (3 feet) tall, but two of the northwestern stones are considerably larger. Located opposite the circle's two shortest stones, one is thin and pointed, reaching 2.1 metres (7 feet) high, while the other is broader, measuring 1.8 metres square (6 feet by 6 feet). The largest of the stones weighs approximately 7.3 tonnes (8 tons) and would have required the efforts of many people to move and erect it. This disparity between the sizes of the megaliths is unparalleled among the other surviving stone circles in the Dorset area, and may have been a deliberate choice by the circle's builders, perhaps reflecting sexual symbolism. There are a number of similar circles in southwestern Scotland, for example the Loupin' Stones, Ninestane Rig, and Burgh Hill, all of which share the architectural feature of having two taller stones on their perimeters. Potentially supporting this link between Dorset and southwestern Scotland is the fact that the Grey Mare and her Colts‚Äîa chambered long barrow located two and a half miles southwest of the Nine Stones‚Äîdisplays architectural similarities with the Clyde-Solway tradition of chambered long barrows. Landscape context and related monuments The circle is located at the bottom of a narrow valley. Though this is unusual for a monument of this type, the Dorset Rempstone stone circle was also erected within a valley. The antiquarian John Aubrey recorded a further stone circle, located about a kilometre (half a mile) to the west of the Nine Stones, which was of similar dimensions to it. It was later destroyed, although as of the 1930s three stones were recorded as remaining at the site. Gale later suggested that this site may not have even been a stone circle at all, but might instead have been the remains of an Early Neolithic chambered tomb. He noted, however, that \\"as nothing remains it is at the moment impossible to resolve\\". There is also a fallen standing stone known as the Broad Stone which measures 2 metres (6.6 feet) in length and which lies beside the road about 1.5 kilometres (0.9 miles) to the west of the Nine Stones. As it was recorded in the nineteenth century it measured 3 metres (10 feet) in length, 2 metres (6 and a half feet) in breadth, and 0.6 metres (2 feet) in thickness. The monument was protected from passing cars by several bollards which were later removed by the highways authority, prompting statements of concern that the stone was unprotected in 2008. Later history=Antiquarian and archaeological research Stukeley's 1724 illustration of the monument, entitled \\"A Celtic Temple at Winterburn\\", according to Burl, this image \\"shows the ring more completely than is possible today\\" The circle was recorded by Aubrey in the seventeenth century, and then by William Stukeley in the eighteenth century. Aubrey recorded the presence of nine megaliths at the site, as did Stukeley's 1723 drawing of it. In the nineteenth century the site was visited by the antiquarian Charles Warne, who wrote about it in his 1872 book Ancient Dorset. He claimed that he could discern the existence of a tenth stone, although on visiting the site in 1936, the Piggotts noted that they could find no evidence of this. Gale later stated that this claim \\"has never been substantiated\\". Warne had consulted Aubrey's manuscript, but confused Aubrey's illustration of the Devil's Quoits at Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, for a monument that he believed had once been located near to the Nine Stones. In 1888, the local council decreed that‚Äîalong with the Grey Mare and her Colts and the Tenant Hill stone circle‚Äîthe site would be registered as an \\"ancient monument\\" under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. In August 1916, the site was then listed as a scheduled monument. The circle was included in the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford's Map of Neolithic Wessex, printed by the Ordnance Survey in 1932. As of 2003, the site had not been excavated. Folklore In 1908, the stone circle was known as the \\"Nine Ladies\\" and the \\"Devil's Nine Stones\\", and in 1941 they were associated with both the Devil and human sacrifice in local folklore. As of 1968, the stone circle was still known as the \\"Devil's Nine Stones\\". In 1966, a man from Winterborne St Martin claimed that the stones were the Devil, his wife, and his children. There are many ancient sites across Britain with names that associate them with the Devil. Examining such place-names, the folklorist Jeremy Harte argued that they did not develop during the Christianisation of England in the early Middle Ages, but rather they were applied to such sites in later centuries, often supplanting the name of an earlier folkloric or legendary figure. The circle during clearances, 2007 In 1965 a woman from the Isle of Portland stated that her own father had always raised his cap when passing the circle. At the same time local folklore was recorded as holding that the stones in the ring could not be counted. This \\"countless stones\\" motif is not unique to this particular site, and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in Britain. The earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early sixteenth-century document, where it applies to the stone circle of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although in an early seventeenth-century document it was being applied to The Hurlers, a set of three stone circles in Cornwall. Later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in England, as well as a single occurrence each in Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own. The archaeologist Leslie Grinsell reported that in the mid-1970s, he learned of a folk tale that the stones had once been children who were turned to stones as punishment for playing Five-Stones on a Sunday. This folk motif of humans turned to stone for revelling on a Sunday had been attached to a range of prehistoric monuments across southwestern Britain by the early eighteenth century, although it had been first recorded in Cornwall in 1602. It is likely connected to Sabbatarianism, and may have been spread by Protestant preachers. In 1984, Harte talked to various individuals who lived in the local area, finding that the monument was also known as \\"Lady Williams and her Dog\\" or \\"Lady Williams and her Little Dog Fido\\", a reference to a family who lived at Bridehead House, Littlebredy. He also related a story that on 23 January 1985, a breakdown van was towing a car past the Nine Stones when, at 9:15pm, its engine cut out and the lights on both vehicles failed. Press coverage speculated that the event was linked to both a ley line passing through the site and to unidentified flying objects that have been reported above the nearby Eggardon Hill. Recent developments The site is in the care of English Heritage, and can be visited at any time. The circle is considered a place of religious importance to a modern Druidic group called the Dolmen Grove Druids. They have described having to confront individuals shouting abuse at them while they have performed their rituals at the stone circle. In October 2007, the sides of the stones facing the road were daubed in white paint with the slogans \\"Read family court hell\\" and \\"F4J\\". \\"F4J\\" was also painted on to the side of Dorset's Hardy Monument. The activist group Fathers4Justice‚Äîwhose acronym is \\"F4J\\"‚Äîdenied any responsibility, condemned the action, and suggested that the slogans had been painted on by unknown individuals in an attempt to discredit the group. Concern about the vandalism was expressed by the National Trust, the local landowner, and the Dolmen Grove Druids.

The line runs from the Valrico Subdivision at Edison Junction south through Bradley Junction to Arcadia for a total of 47.2 miles. It junctions with the Achan Subdivision and the Agricola Spur at Bradley Junction, and connects to the Seminole Gulf Railway in Arcadia.CSX Jacksonville Division Timetable Operation Train K343 on the turn at Bradley Junction heading from New Wales to Agrock. The Brewster Subdivision begins at Edison Junction near the community of Keysville. It starts as a wye that branches off the Valrico Subdivision. From here, it proceeds southeast to Bradley Junction, where it turns south on to the former Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway. From Bradley Junction, the line continues south to Agrock, Fort Green Springs, and Ona before coming to a point just north of Arcadia where it connects with the Seminole Gulf Railway, a shortline that operates the continuing track south to Punta Gorda and Fort Myers. The Brewster Subdivision is CSX's second busiest line through the Bone Valley after the Valrico Subdivision. The line is dispatched through Track warrant control. The line serves three phosphate facilities operated by The Mosaic Company. Mosaic's New Wales plant is located near the north end of the line between Edison and Bradley Junction and is considered by Mosaic to be the world's largest phosphate processing facility. Four Corners Mine is located a short distance behind Agrock yard south of Bradley Junction. Agrock yard is used by Mosaic as a staging area for Four Corners Mine and operates their own locomotives and equipment from the mine to the yard. The southernmost phosphate facility on the line is Mosaic's South Pasture Mine in Fort Green Springs which was previously operated by CF Industries before it was bought by Mosaic. South Pasture Mine is currently not operating and has been idle since 2018. Though Mosaic plans to reactivate it at some point in the future. When active, South Pasture is the southernmost point of CSX's Bone Valley operations. The only traffic on the Brewster Subdivision south of South Pasture is twice-weekly mixed freight for interchange with Seminole Gulf Railway in Arcadia. This traffic is the only non-phosphate related rail traffic on the Brewster Subdivision. History The northern segment of the Brewster Subdivision from Edison to Bradley Junction and the Agricola spur was built by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1910. From Bradley Junction south to Arcadia, the line was an extension of the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway built in 1911. The Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway historically extended as far south as Boca Grande, which was once the location of a major phosphate shipping port. Therefore, the line was known as the Boca Grande Subdivision prior to 1981.Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Jacksonville Division and Tampa Division Timetable (1977) The Seaboard Air Line Railroad bought the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway in 1926. In 1967, the Seaboard Air Line and the Atlantic Coast Line merged to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the Chessie System, creating the CSX Corporation. The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation. The line once had a spur track to a mine east of Agrock Yard. This defunct mine has since been redeveloped by Mosaic into the Streamsong Resort and golf course. Track south of Arcadia to Boca Grande was abandoned in 1981 after the closure of Port Boca Grande. The remaining line was subsequently renamed the Brewster Subdivision, which is named for the defunct ghost town of Brewster that was located just south of Bradley Junction. The town existed from 1910 to 1962 and played a role in the area's phosphate industry. Remnants of the town include a smokestack and a few abandoned buildings.

His whereabouts remain unknown and the motives behind his kidnapping are unclear, but the Mexican authorities allege that the priest was kidnapped by an organized crime group. Biography Carlos Ornelas Puga was born on 25 October 1975 in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico. He was ordained in the Catholic Church in 2001, and held a post as head of the Deanery in Jim√©nez, Tamaulipas. As a member of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ciudad Victoria, Ornelas Puga was also a priest at Los Cinco Se√±ores parish church in Jim√©nez. Prior to his kidnapping in November 2013, he aided victims of the Mexican Drug War in Tamaulipas, provided seminars for teenagers, and helped conduct the missions program of the diocese. Kidnapping After conducting an evening mass at Los Cinco Se√±ores parish on 3 November 2013 in Jim√©nez, Tamaulipas, Ornelas Puga was reportedly kidnapped by gunmen presumably involved in organized crime. Witnesses notified local authorities of the abduction the moment the crime occurred. However, no measures were taken for more than four days, according to Roman Catholic Diocese of Ciudad Victoria spokesman Fernando Sandoval. On 7 November, the Tamaulipas authorities sent a convoy of state police officers and an anti-kidnapping team to investigate the case, but they were ambushed by gunmen in Padilla, Tamaulipas. The attack left three officers (two male and one female) wounded by gunfire. Two days later, the Mexican authorities confirmed that several mutilated bodies were located at a ranch known as La Borbolla along the highway that connects Jim√©nez and Padilla. Unconfirmed reports suggested that the body of Ornelas Puga might be among the remains. On 13 November, the Mexican Episcopal Conference (CEM) confirmed the disappearance of Ornelas Puga and condemned the crime. The CEM admitted that this was not the first case a priest had been targeted in Mexico; many others have received threats from organized crime for protecting migrants and working on cases of people who have disappeared across the country. Background Ornelas Puga was kidnapped in Tamaulipas, one of the most violent states in Mexico. Given its geographical location along the U.S.-Mexico border, Tamaulipas is a major route for human trafficking, arms smuggling, and international drug trade. It is also home to two transnational criminal organizations, the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, who have fought for the control of these smuggling routes along the Texan border area since early 2010. In the months leading to his abduction, the municipality of Jim√©nez experienced a series of violent episodes that were a direct result of turf wars between rival drug trafficking organizations. Kidnappings‚Äîincluding forced disappearances of entire families‚Äîwere reported in the region in earlier months. In November 2013, the month Ornelas Puga was kidnapped, nine people were reportedly abducted in Jim√©nez; their whereabouts remain unknown. According to a 2013 report from the Vatican, Mexico was the second-most- violent country for priests in Latin America (just behind Colombia). In the administration of President Felipe Calder√≥n, 17 priests were killed between 2007 and 2012. The organization responsible for counting the killings is the Catholic Multimedia Center (Spanish: Centro Cat√≥lico Multimedial), which is part of the religious congregation Society of Saint Peter (Spanish: Sociedad de San Pablo), who directly gives the list to Rome through Agenzia Fides. Clergymen in Mexico are not immune to the drug violence nor to attacks from organized crime. Priests have been forced to pay protection to organized crime; if any given priest refuses to pay the racketeering, the threats become more severe, like burning the church's precinct, a kidnapping, or even death. When it is an extortion, the payment usually is around 10,000 pesos (about 778 USD). For a kidnapping, the ransom averages at around 2 million pesos (153,530 USD). Priests' outspokenness against Mexico's drug trafficking organizations can also incur reprisals, especially in areas where drug-related crimes are high. Others have received death threats and attacks because they have protected migrants (common prey of organized crime) from abuse. Besides Ornelas Puga, two other priests in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas were kidnapped in December 2013 and remain disappeared. Guillermo Amaro C√©sar (also from Tamaulipas) was killed in 2013 after alleged organized crime members beat him to death. The state authorities concluded that the motive of the murder was stemmed by robbery. Reaction On September 2014, the local bishop Antonio Gonz√°lez S√°nchez called for a peaceful march in memory of Ornelas Puga and other people who remain disappeared. The march was scheduled for 3 November 2014, the anniversary date of the priest's disappearance. Every year, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ciudad Victoria organizes a march in the city with family members and friends of people who have disappeared in Mexico.

All statutes, regulations, and ordinances are subject to judicial review. Pursuant to common law tradition, the courts of Michigan have developed a large body of case law through the decisions of the Michigan Supreme Court and Michigan Court of Appeals.

Founded in 1987, the company is based in Eugene, Oregon. Mountain Rose Herbs is known for organic, sustainably sourced, and wild harvested products. The company was the first fair trade certified supplier of these products in the United States. By 2010, it was the second-largest distributor of organic dried herbs in the nation. The company opened its first retail location, Mountain Rose Herbs Mercantile, in 2016 in downtown Eugene, selling organic botanicals and DIY supplies. History Herbalist, educator, and author Rosemary Gladstar established what would become Mountain Rose Herbs in 1987 in Northern California, as a mail-order company that provided supplies for students at the California School of Herbal Studies. In 1991, herbalist Julie Bailey purchased the small business. She continued to run Mountain Rose Herbs from her Humboldt County, California home, filling orders by mail. The company grew steadily through the 1990s and adopted rigorous guidelines for harvesting of wild plants. In 1997, Mountain Rose Herbs moved to a larger residence in North San Juan, California. In 2000, environmental activist, Shawn Donnille, was promoted to management. He obtained organic certification for the company, and built the first Mountain Rose Herbs website in order to sell products online. In 2001, Shawn Donnille became a part owner of Mountain Rose Herbs. That year they moved the business to Pleasant Hill, Oregon to be closer to the company's farm operations, wild harvesters, and processors. This move allowed Bailey and Donnille to create a full-time laboratory and quality control department. The home-based retailer became a certified organic processor through Oregon Tilth in 2002. Between 2001 and 2010, Mountain Rose Herbs experienced steady growth, averaging between 25% and 45% each year, and soon grew out of their Pleasant Hill location. In July 2010, the retailer moved to their current facility, the former Burley Design bicycle trailer factory in west Eugene. This 60,600-square-foot factory and the lease of a separate 10,000-square-foot building next door, tripled the retailer's space. 415x415px Mountain Rose Herbs has been recognized multiple times for ethical business practices. In 2010, the company was a finalist for the Oregon Ethics in Business Award. In 2011, it was honored with the Oregon Organic Coalition of Excellence award. The Oregon Sustainability Board selected Mountain Rose Herbs as the 2012 Grand Champion for the Governor's Sustainability Award, recognizing the company as a leader in socially and environmentally responsible business practices. In 2013, Shawn Donnille was a recipient of a 20 under 40 Award, for helping to \\"foster growth from an ‚Äòout of the garage‚Äô operation into one of Eugene's largest and most dynamic employers.\\" As of 2015, Mountain Rose Herbs was working with fifteen certified organic farms throughout the Pacific Northwest. In January 2017, Mountain Rose Herbs purchased the assets of Eugene herbal products company, Terra Firma Botanicals. And Shawn Donnille became an equal partner 50/50 in the business. Mountain Rose Herbs now employs over 200 people in six separate Eugene facilities. Products Mountain Rose Herbs carries approximately 1,500 botanical items, totaling 6,000 different sizes and finished products. These include bulk herbs, spices, culinary salts, sprouting seeds, teas, aromatherapy products, extracts, tinctures, salves, balms, natural bath and skincare products, and books, tools and other essentials for DIY projects. Herbal Education As part of their ongoing support for herbal education, the company established the Free Herbalism Project, an annual community event with botanically inspired lectures from experts in the field. Additionally, the company provides educational podcasts called Herbal Radio and how-to videos on YouTube. In 2011, Mountain Rose Herbs founded Rootstalk Festival, a three-day benefit festival that brought together 40 experts and environmental groups to present classes on sustainable living, herbal medicine, wilderness skills, urban farming, and homesteading projects. In 2015, Mountain Rose Herbs and Oregon Tilth presented a free Organic Land Care Peer Learning Session for landscape professionals.  Community  In 2009, Mountain Rose Herbs established the Mountain Rose River Project, a grassroots action team. Each year, employees carry out six to eight restoration projects through a Paid Time for Community Involvement program. The company partners with the state of Oregon, federal government, and nonprofit agencies to work on projects primarily focusing on local riparian ecosystems, stream health, and fish habitat. Since 2012, Mountain Rose Herbs has maintained a comprehensive fair trade certification in accordance with the IMO Fair for Life standard. The company has worked directly with organic herb and spice growers through its Fair for Life Project. This project helps small organic farms in India comply with fair trade requirements by acting as mandator of the project, funding the certification process, and paying fair trade premiums for the goods. In 2017, Mountain Rose Herbs was awarded the Innovation in Philanthropy Award from the Portland Business Journal in recognition for the Mountain Rose River Project, and for its charitable giving and nonprofit partnerships.  Sustainability  Mountain Rose Herbs advocates for organic farming, the environment, and fair trade. Most products are certified organic, all packaging is environmentally friendly, bottles and labels are made from post-consumer plastics and paper, tea boxes are compostable, and printing is done with soy-based inks. Additionally, the company conserves water with a satellite-controlled irrigation system, and a bioswale filters runoff water from the roof and pavement. Mountain Rose Herbs was the first Oregon company to receive Zero Waste Facility Certification. Companies that are awarded the Zero Waste Facility Certification must meet all local, state, and federal waste regulations, and also divert at least 90% of all non-hazardous waste from landfills and incineration. Mountain Rose Herbs holds the highest level of certification: Platinum. In 2014, the retailer became the first company in Eugene to be salmon-safe certified. In 2015, Mountain Rose Herbs installed over 100 photovoltaic solar panels to generate electricity for the main facility in Eugene. The 25 kWh solar array installed on the roof produces an estimated 32,604 kWh of power. Over the expected 35-year lifespan of the system, it is anticipated to offset 470 tons of CO2, which is equivalent to the conservation of 10,980 trees or 48,170 gallons of gasoline. Additionally, Mountain Rose Herbs is a Bicycle Friendly Business, and offers an Alternative Commute Program that pays cash incentives to employees who carpool with fellow staff members, use public transportation, bicycle, or walk to work. The company has received numerous awards for its sustainability leadership, including The 100 Best Green Companies to Work for in Oregon, the Beyond Toxics Visionary Leader Award, and the Charities@Work Corporate Excellence Award for overall excellence in employee engagement and corporate social responsibility.

When his sons and their forces met up near Colmar in Alsace, Louis the Pious' sworn supporters infamously deserted him to join his sons. Background Louis the Pious, Holy Roman Emperor, inherited a vast empire from his father Charlemagne in 814 CE. This vast territory included all of western Europe excluding the British Isles, the small Christian northern Spanish states, Muslim Spain and Byzantine southern Italy and Sicily. It is often suggested that Louis the Pious‚Äô reign marks the beginning of a period of decline of what had been his father, Charlemagne‚Äôs powerful empire, leading to the eventual decline of the Carolingians.Cabannis (1962), 171. Louis‚Äô role as Emperor carried with it the ecclesiastical basis for universal power; the concept that one of the Emperors duties was to protect the Church against dangers which might threaten its ability to correctly teach and spread the faith. The title of Holy Roman Emperor brought new ideas of inheritance. Possessing a universal authority to preserve the Church meant preserving the unity of the empire. In the past, Merovingian and Carolingian predecessors like Charlemagne treated kingdoms as private estates and, at death, the territory was divided among the sons.Encycopledia Britannica. The early Carolingian idea of dividing up the territories of the kingdom among sons began to change. The reasoning behind passing along a kingdom undivided was casually linked to the Carolingian dynasty and their affiliation to the Catholic Church, establishing the notion of a Christian empire. Following this reasoning, for Louis to divide up the empire among his sons was to commit a mortal sin, he would be breaking up a true Christian empire that protected Catholic faith.Cabaniss (1962), 175. The unity of the empire had to be maintained, thus, in a special ceremony Louis prayed to God for inspiration to decide which son should be the inheritor.Cabaniss (1962), 175. The eldest of the three, Lothar, was selected and was then associated with imperial authority, crowned co-emperor and ordered to look after and rule over his younger brothers, Pepin and Louis. These actions were to have serious consequences for both the succession to the throne, and integrity of the Frankish realm. After the death of his first wife, Louis married Judith, who bore him another son, Charles, in 823 CE. The accommodations required when a new heir was born brought on a crisis in the family.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. This included dissatisfied nobles and greedy bishops persuading Louis the Pious‚Äô sons, that in reality their father wished to destroy their inheritance. Louis the Pious‚Äô attempt to make Charles co-heir to the Frankish kingdom caused agitation among his sons.Cabannis (1962), 89. Main Players=Louis the Pious (778-840 CE)Lothar (795-855 CE) Lothar was Louis the Pious' first-born son and heir to his empire. He led his two younger brothers in a revolt against their father in 833 CE, and fought a war against his brother Louis II and their half-brother, Charles. Pepin (797-838 CE) He was Louis the Pious' second son, he received the territory of Aquitaine in his father‚Äôs kingdom. He participated in a rebellion with his brothers against their father. Louis II (806-876 CE) He was the third son of Louis the Pious. He received the territory of Germania also known as East Francia. He also received the title King of Bavaria from his grandfather Charlemagne upon his death. Charles II (823-877 CE) Louis the Pious youngest son born to his second wife. He received title of Holy Roman Emperor in 875 CE. Pope Gregory IV (795-844 CE) Pope Gregory IV became Bishop of Rome in 827 CE and had previously held the title of Cardinal Priest of Basilica of St Mark. His papacy is notable due to his involvement in the disagreements between Louis the Pious and his sons. Event A tapestry of Louis the Pious in battle. :\\"Evil communications corrupt good manners.\\"1 Corinthians 15:33. The division of the realm between Lothar and Charles stirred up Frankish aristocrats. The various dissatisfied nobles and clans of the Frankish realm caused Lothar, Pepin and Louis to form a common league against their father and to muster a large army of supporters. The brothers called upon Pope Gregory IV hoping that he of all people could help reconcile father to sons.Cabaniss (1962), 96. Rumors began to circulate that if there was any disobedience to the Pope‚Äôs will or that of Louis the Pious‚Äô sons, the Pope would excommunicate Louis the Pious and his bishops.Cabaniss (1962), 96. An assembly was held in Alsace in 833 CE. This assembly included the convergence of Louis the Pious, his three elder sons, their respective forces and Pope Gregory (with his entourage). This event was to be known as the Field of Lies, because those who had sworn fealty to the emperor betrayed him to join his sons. It was here that Louis had to confront his sons and their moral pretext of defending the realm.Booker (2009), 122. As Louis stood in battle formation he received Pope Gregory. The Pope reported hearing that Louis was having an ongoing struggle between his sons and that Gregory was there to help them all to gain peace.Cabaniss (1962), 97. Louis stated his position and Pope Gregory returned to the Emperor's sons, but his efforts to attain a mutual peace was in vain. Due to bribes, threats or seduction by promises, Louis‚Äô sworn supporters were surging to the side of his sons and joining their followers. The defection grew in momentum as the days passed and Lothar, Pepin and Louis were threatening to launch an attack on their father. Louis found himself in a position where, if an armed conflict were to take place, he would be overwhelmed by his sons' forces. The Emperor agreed to meet his sons on the field. There, Louis told them to remember the promises they had made to him and his son (Charles) then proceeded to their camp. They told their father to abandon his camp and join them at theirs, which he did. At the camp of Lothar, Pepin and Louis, Louis the Pious was held in a pavilion designed for the specific purpose of keeping him at the camp.Cabaniss (1962), 98. Aftermath After these events, the empire was partitioned among the brothers in a threefold division.Cabaniss (1962), 98. Pope Gregory departed for Italy, Pepin returned to Aquitaine, and Louis returned to Bavaria. Charles was banished to Italy and his mother was sent to a convent. Lothar took their father Louis with him as he continued on with his many duties. As Lothar traveled across his territory, he kept his father under constant watch. He also received an embassy from the Byzantine Emperor at Constantinople. He accepted the gifts and withheld the gifts designated for his father. He sent the gifts home along with the news of the tragedy, and fall from grace of Louis the Pious.Cabaniss (1962), 98. Louis the Pious then performed a public display of penance for his crimes against the empire and God. After the imprisoned Emperor performed his penance, his son Louis was compelled to make peace with him for the unity of the empire. After another shift of loyalties, Lothar fled to Burgundy and Louis the Pious was restored to power in 834 CE. NotesReferences *Booker, Courtney M.

Controversies  Rothenberg Ventures became the subject of an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2016, and multiple lawsuits have been filed against the firm. In 2018, the SEC charged Mike Rothenberg and Rothenberg Ventures with fraud. In July 2016, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened an investigation into Rothenberg Ventures' financial management practices, centering on allegations of excessive executive compensation without investors' knowledge. Media reports have cited bank fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, whistleblower retaliation, and wire fraud as possible areas of investigation, which the SEC has not confirmed. Several executives left the company during July and August 2016, including Fran Hauser, who had served as a venture partner since May 2014. Multiple lawsuits have been filed against the company, including one by a former chief of staff alleging Rothenberg Ventures owed payments to 50 employees, and another by a former chief financial officer who claimed he was never paid back for more than $100,000 in business expenses. Rothenberg was ordered to pay its former CFO $166,000 in damages on October 30, 2017. Mike Rothenberg has been accused of investing $5 million from Rothenberg Ventures' second and third funds in his own startup company, River Studios, a VR production house established in May 2015. River Studios' first contract was with Birchbox, and the company has subsequently created VR content for Bj√∂rk, Coldplay, the Denver Broncos, and the Sacramento Kings. A third party forensic accounting firm was able to reconcile the finances and confirmed that they were consistent with the agreements with the LPs. In 2017, Transcend VR sued Mike Rothenberg on allegations of breach of contract and settled out of court.. \\"We look forward to a continuation of Mike's highly ranked performance as a venture fund manager and are pleased to continue as an investor with Rothenberg Ventures\\", said Dominic Polizzotto, manager of Transcend VR and affiliate Transcend Frontier, LLC. The company's name was briefly changed to Frontier Tech Ventures, from September 2016 to February 2017. In October 2016, San Francisco's Planning Department received notification that the firm was operating from a building not properly permitted for use as general office space. The property, which was reportedly purchased in 2015 for $4.5 million, also housed co-working space for startup and portfolio companies, including Liquidspace. In late 2016, Rothenberg Ventures was mentioned in year-end stories about corporate crises by Bloomberg Businessweek, Forbes, and Business Insider. in 2018, Rothenburg filed a lawsuit against Silicon Valley Bank, which accuses them of negligence, deceit, fraud, and unfair business practices. The suit, which seeks a jury trial, alleges the bank \\"created the false appearance that the management company and Mr. Rothenberg had wrongfully misappropriated missions in investor funds.\\" The firm intended to use the deposited fees as collateral for a loan, which it wanted to complete before the end of the year, according to the suit. On Dec. 23, Rothenberg instructed the bank to set up an account owned by the 2015 investment fund for that purpose, according to the lawsuit, and the bank did so on the same day. The bank, however, didn't have enough time to complete its customary three-week internal control process before the year end, the suit says. So it took a shortcut, the suit says, creating a new account owned by the management company without telling Rothenberg. On August 20, 2018 the SEC charged Mike Rothenberg and Rothenberg Ventures with fraud. Rothenberg settled the charges without admitting guilt, and has stepped down from his position. As part of the settlement, Rothenberg does not admit guilt but has agreed to be barred from the brokerage and investment advisory business with a right to reapply after five years. In August 2019, Deloitte completed a financial audit resulting in the SEC seeking over $31m in penalties from Mike Rothenberg. In January 2020, Mike Rothenberg was ordered to pay $31.4 million to settle a court ruling favoring the SEC allegations. Rothenberg was found to have funneled millions of dollars from investors to support his flashy lifestyle, building a race car team, and to fund a virtual reality studio.

McComb designed a three-story Federal-style edifice built from New Jersey brownstone. The cornerstone for Old Queens was laid on April 27, 1809 by Queen's College's president, the Rev. Ira Condict, who did so \\"with his left hand, in consequence of suffering a temporary lameness in his right.\\" Classes began within the completed portions of the building as early as 1811 for Queen's College (now Rutgers University), Queen's College Grammar School (now Rutgers Preparatory School), and the New Brunswick Theological Seminary. The college was forced to close temporarily, not reopening until 1825. Henry Rutgers donated funds to reopen the school in the form of a $5,000 bond, and gave a bell that was placed in the cupola of Old Queens. The bell is rung on important events, including convocations, commencements, and key athletic victories.

Van Nest Hall (1845) In the nineteenth century, Van Nest Hall housed the meeting rooms and libraries of the college's two rival literary and debating societies In 1845, Rutgers College hired local builder and architect Nicholas Wyckoff to build a two-story brick building in the southwest corner of the college's small campus. The trustees named the new building after Abraham Van Nest (1777‚Äì1864), a New York City merchant and president of the Greenwich Savings Bank, who served as a trustee for over forty years, \\"in recognition of his services and gifts.\\" The building featured two large rooms on its first floor which were used by the school's two literary societies, Peithessophian and Philoclean which were significant in campus life in the nineteenth century. The second floor contained the chemical laboratory of Professor Lewis Caleb Beck (1798‚Äì1853) who taught at Rutgers for 23 years. In 1893, supported by donation from Van Nest's daughter, Ann Van Nest Bussing, the trustees expanded the building by adding a third floor and adding \\"an appropriate stone porch.\\" The first floor at this time had been renovated to house the college's history faculty and a chapter of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA).

The two-story Greek Revival octagonal brick astronomical observatory was built in 1865 soon after Rutgers College was selected as New Jersey's sole land grant college. Rutgers named the building after New York City businessman, Daniel S. Schanck, who donated a large portion of the funds to construct and equip the observatory. The cost of cost of construction and equipment amounted to US$6,166 (2013: US$86,845.07), of which US$2,400 (2013: US$33,802.82) was donated by Schanck (1812‚Äì1872). Rutgers equipped the observatory with \\"a 6.5-inch equatorial refracting telescope, a meridian circle with four-inch object glass for transit observations, a sidereal clock, a mean solar clock...chronograph, repeating circle, and other instruments.\\" The Schanck Observatory served as the university's first astronomical facility and was used to provide instruction to its students through the nineteenth and early twentieth century. It is no longer in use. Geology Hall (1872) Designed in the Gothic Revival style by architect Henry Janeway Hardenburgh, Geology Hall was built in 1872 Geology Hall, formerly Geological Hall, was built in 1872 with funds raised by the college's president, William Henry Campbell for the purpose of facilitating the expansion of science and agriculture education. Rutgers expanded these programs after being named New Jersey's only land grant college. The design was the second of three projects for Rutgers College prepared by architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh. Hardenbergh's design called initially for a Gothic Revival style brick building, although it was revised to use brownstone, a cheaper alternative.

Winants Hall (1890) Winant's Hall, built 1890, was the college's first dormitory During the eighteenth and nineteenth century, students rented rooms from local boarding houses as the college did not offer dormitories or other student housing. In 1890, Garret E. Winants, a college trustee and wealthy philanthropist from Bayonne presented to the trustees a sketch of a proposed dormitory and a donation of $75,000 to build it. The building was designed by architect Van Campen Taylor, an 1867 graduate of Rutgers College, and Winants Hall was erected in 1890. Winants would serve as Rutgers College's sole dormitory until 1915 when Ford Hall was built on the Voorhees Mall along College Avenue. After World War II, Winants was converted to offices for faculty and academic departments, and for administrative staff. In 1990, a century after its construction, Winants Hall underwent a $9.4 million restoration. The building currently houses the university's alumni relations and legal counsel offices, and the university's fundraising arm, the Rutgers University Foundation. Grounds The Queens Campus seen from George Street through the Class of 1883 Memorial Gateway The Queens Campus is a six-acre tract. During his ten- year tenure as Rutgers College's sixth president during the 1840s, Abraham Bruyn Hasbrouck (1791‚Äì1879) began planting and caring for \\"many of the noble trees that now adorn the campus.\\" There are four gates on providing entrance to the campus: * The Class of 1883 Memorial Gateway (erected in 1904) is located at the northeast corner of George Street and Somerset Streets and is the main entrance for vehicle and foot traffic to the Queens Campus. * The Henry Rutgers Baldwin Gateway (erected 1901) located on the south side of the campus on College Avenue roughly half of the distance between Somerset and Hamilton Streets. It was named for Henry Rutgers Baldwin, an alumnus from the Rutgers College class of 1849. It provides an exit for vehicular traffic. * The Class of 1882 Gateway (erected 1907) at the southeast corner of Somerset Street and College Avenue. * The Class of 1902 Memorial Gateway (erected in 1904) is located on the western side of the campus on Hamilton Street half the distance between George Street and College Avenue. It features a wrought iron and brownstone entrance portal and brownstone stairway and provides access to foot traffic between the Queens Campus and Voorhees Mall sections of the College Avenue Campus. It is through this last gate that graduating seniors have walked in procession during Commencement exercises held in May in years past. The campus contains several memorials, including trees planted in honour of victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and other persons connected to the university. Located in front of Old Queens, the Class of 1877 Cannon commemorates both the Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War and several alumni who have served in the United States military. As a tradition during commencement, those graduating break clay pipes over the cannon as a symbol of breaking ties with their \\"pipe dreams\\" of youth and embarking into adulthood.

It generally corresponds closely with the administrative divisions of Thailand. Address parts With the exception of the initial plot and house number, Thai addresses are mostly in the Western order, starting from the smallest unit and progressing to the largest. The general format, as codified by the Universal Postal Union, is: :Plot/House number, Village :Road :Subdistrict, District :Province Postal Code :THAILAND Plot, house and village Thai muban (‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡πà‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô) correspond only loosely to actual settlements, which may well have separate names, but these are not used for addresses. They are divided into groups mu (‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡πà), often transliterated moo or abbreviated \\"M\\", which are divided into numbered plots (‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏Ç‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà ban lek ti), which may (or may not) contain multiple houses. All numbers are assigned in the order they were originally registered, and generally do not follow any geographical or logical sequence. In cities, a large named building often plays the role of \\"village\\", which is then followed by the apartment number. Road Roads do not correspond with administrative divisions, and they are consequently the most complicated and non-standardized part of a Thai address. Main thoroughfares are thanon (‡∏ñ‡∏ô‡∏ô), often abbreviated \\"Th\\", glossed as \\"road\\" or \\"Rd\\" in English, or omitted entirely. Smaller streets are soi (‡∏ã‡∏≠‡∏¢), which are numbered in increasing order, although odd and even sois are on different sides of the street. New sois added between old ones may receive annexes: for example, soi 7/1 would be located between soi 7 and soi 9. Large sois usually have names and are then also referred to as thanon, e.g. Thanon Ekkamai for Sukhumvit Soi 63, and these can have their own numbered sub-sois. Consequently Soi 4 off Soi 63 off Sukhumvit Rd can be referred to as any of Thanon Ekkamai Soi 4, Ekkamai Soi 4 or even Soi Ekkamai 4. For redundancy, both the name and the number of the large soi are sometimes added, as in Soi Ekkamai 4, Sukhumvit 63 Rdhttp://www.desksurfing.net/desks/1703-hubba-thailand, where both Ekkamai and Sukhumvit 63 refer to the large soi. District Districts are called amphoe (‡∏≠‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏†‡∏≠), divided into subdistricts, tambon (‡∏ï‡∏≥‡∏ö‡∏•). In Bangkok only, amphoe and tambon are replaced with khet (‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏ï) and khwaeng (‡πÅ‡∏Ç‡∏ß‡∏á) respectively. Postal code The postal code follows the province changwat (‡∏à‡∏±‡∏á‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î), or the special administrative region of Bangkok. Thai postal codes consist of five digits, where the first two digits identify the province, the third digit the district, and the remaining two the subdistrict. There are however several cases where more than one district shares the same third digit, or some muban have the postcode of a neighboring subdistrict. Nine- digit codes in the format NNNNN-NNNN are possible, but rarely used. Examples *In practice, addresses in urban areas typically omit the village number, while rural addresses often have only the village number without a road. Often only one of town and district is used, since one or the other is usually sufficiently specific. For example, the address of the headquarters of Thailand Post is: :Thailand Post Co., Ltd. :111 Chaengwatthana Road :Laksi :Bangkok 10210-0299 :Thailand This corresponds to house number 111, Chaengwatthana Road, Thung Song Hong subdistrict (omitted), Laksi District, Bangkok Province. *A coworking space in a small street in central Bangkokhttps://www.hubbathailand.com/ has the following address: :19 Soi Ekkamai 4 :Sukhumvit 63 Rd. :Phra Khanong Nuea :Watthana :Bangkok 10110 This corresponds to house number 19 in the fourth soi off Sukhumvit Soi 63 (Ekkamai), Phra Khanong Nuea subdistrict, Watthana district, Bangkok Province. *A typical address in Phuket might be: :7/22 M.5, Soi Ta-iat, Chaofa West Rd., T. Chalong :A. Phuket 83130 Thailand This corresponds to house 22 on plot 7, Mu 5, Ta-iat lane, Chaofa West Road, Chalong Sub-district, Mueang Phuket District. *The address of a guesthouse in rural Thailand is: :144/4 M.5 :Ban Tham :Chiang Dao :Chiang Mai 50170 :Thailand This corresponds to house 4 on plot 144, Mu 5, Muban Ban Tham, Chiang Dao District, Chiang Mai Province.

A. glaesaria is the first species of the ant genus Acropyga to have been described from fossils found in Dominican amber and is the one of several species of Acropyga found in the West Indies. As with other members of the genus, A. glaesaria was most likely trophobiotic. History and classification Acropyga glaesaria is known from six fossil insects which are inclusions in transparent chunks of Dominican amber. The amber was produced by the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America and up to southern Mexico. The specimens were collected from undetermined amber mines in fossil bearing rocks of the Cordillera Septentrional mountains, northern Dominican Republic. The amber dates from at least the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene, based on studying the associated fossil foraminifera and may be as old as the Middle Eocene, based on the associated fossil coccoliths. This age range is due to the host rock being secondary deposits for the amber, and the Miocene the age range is only the youngest that it might be. Dorsal view of an A. glaesaria paratype The holotype amber specimen, number DR-16-603, entombs an alate queen associated with the only known Electromyrmococcus inclusus, and one paratype queen, in a separate amber specimen with the E. reginae holotype, are currently preserved in the American Museum of Natural History in New York. A single specimen in the collections at the Naturmuseum Senckenberg in Frankfurt, Germany preserves two more paratype queens and the two known paratype males, all in association with the holotype of E. abductus. The fossils were first studied by entomologist John LaPolla of the Smithsonian Institution. LaPolla's 2005 type description of the new species was published in the journal Transactions of the American Entomological Society. The specific epithet glaesaria is derived from the Latin for \\"of amber\\" in reference to the preservation of the fossils. Prior to the species formal description in 2005 the fossils had been attributed to the genus Brachymyrmex and in the 2001 description of Electromyrmococcus specimens of A. glaesaria were suggested to represent several different Acropyga species. The generic placement was stabilized with a review and clarification of the scope of Acropyga by LaPolla in 2004, while the suggestion of multiple species based on morphology was shown to be an artifact of distortion and preservation in the amber. The association of A. glaesaria and the Electromyrmococcus species is one of the oldest examples of trophobiosis. Modern Acropyga are thought to be fully reliant on mealy bug species as their source of food and reproductive only emerge from the nest during the mating flight, each carrying a seed bug in their mandibles.  Description  The Acropyga glaesaria specimens are well preserved, though the specimens show some distortion from the amber moving after entombment. The specimens of queens have estimated body lengths between ,while the measured male shows a length of about . The overall coloration of the A. glaesaria queens is a light yellow tone, typical for members of the genus and the males are a slightly darker dusky yellow which is also typical.

All labelling information that is provided on food labels or in advertisements, as required by legislation, must be accurate, truthful and not misleading. Ingredient lists must accurately reflect the contents and their relative proportions in a food. Nutrition facts tables must accurately reflect the amount of a nutrient present in a food. Net quantity declarations must accurately reflect the amount of food in the package. Certain claims, such as those relating to nutrient content, organic, kosher, halal and certain disease-risk reduction claims, are subject to specific regulatory requirements in addition to the prohibitions in the various acts. For claims that are not subject to specific regulatory requirements, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and/or Health Canada provide interpretive guidance that assist industry in compliance. Primary functions According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, a food label serves three primary functions: # it provides basic product information (including common name, list of ingredients, net quantity, durable life date, grade/quality, country of origin and name and address of manufacturer, dealer or importer); # it provides health, safety, and nutrition information. This includes instructions for safe storage and handling, nutrition information such as the quantity of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals present per serving of stated size of the food (in the nutrition facts table), and specific information on products for special dietary use; # it acts as a vehicle for food marketing, promotion and advertising (via label vignettes, promotional information and label claims such as low fat, cholesterol-free, high source of fibre, product of Canada, natural, organic, no preservatives added, and so on). Examples of various common food labelling found in homes Requirements Some of the core labelling requirements that are set out by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency include:  Common name  The common name of a product is the label that someone will see when they pick up a product. The name on the product must comply with three criteria set out by the Government of Canada. # What is listed in Canada's set of Food and Drug Regulations # The name prescribed by another federal regulation # The name by which the food is formally known (for example: orange juice) The name of the product must also be displayed on the main label in both English and French with a minimum height of 1/16 of an inch (1.6 mm). Exemptions from declaring a common name on the label: * Fresh fruits or vegetables that are packaged in a way that is visible and identifiable to the public. For example, mushrooms that are in clear packaging do not have to be labelled with the common name \\"mushrooms\\". * Pre-packaged fruits that have a variety of kinds do not require being universally labelled. For example, apples have numerous kinds (i.e. Red Delicious, Granny Smith); these apples can be labelled with their exact kind to benefit the purchaser. When advertising a common name food, the food must be referred to by its common name. For example, lemon juice from concentrate must be advertised as 'from concentrate' and not just 'lemon juice', as this has the ability to confuse consumers. However, once the ad has referenced the common name at least once, it can be considered acceptable to refer to it from its brand name from then on.  Ingredient labelling requirements  Unless otherwise exempted, pre- packaged multi-ingredient foods require by law, an ingredient list. In Canada, the ingredients must be displayed in both English and French unless exempted. Ingredients and their components (ingredients of ingredients) also must be listed under their specific names; for example, whey protein must be listed as such, and not just as \\"protein\\", which would be ambiguous. Exceptions to this requirement include \\"spices, seasonings and herbs (except salt), flavour enhancers, natural and artificial flavourings, food additives, and vitamin and mineral nutrients and derivatives or salts, which may be shown at the end of the ingredient list in any order\\". The Food and Drug Regulations Act also ensures that \\"ingredients appear on labels in decreasing order of proportion\\". = Allergens = Common allergens such as gluten, peanuts, and dairy must be called out below the ingredient list. On February 16, 2011, the Food and Drug Regulations Act was passed, requiring enhanced labelling requirements for food allergen, gluten sources, and sulphites, beginning on August 4, 2012. When an allergen is not a listed ingredient but is processed in the same facility so that contamination with trace amounts is possible, a precautionary statement is often given near the ingredient list (\\"may contain traces of . . . \\"); this is not required, but Health Canada \\"considers the use of allergen precautionary statements to be a useful tool in mitigating adverse reactions to priority food allergens if the statements are used appropriately.\\"  Nutrition labelling  By law, nearly all products have a nutrition label in Canada. The nutrition label gives you information about the product including, its serving size, calories, and its percentage of the 13 core nutrients that Canada deems necessary. These nutrients include fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrate, fibre, sugars, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron. All of these nutrients, except for vitamins and minerals, are recorded based on a reasonable daily intake percentage. Vitamins and minerals are based on a recommended daily intake (RDI). These differ in that one is based on what one is expected to eat in a day, while the other is based on what the government recommends one consume in a day. However, all nutrients are recorded onto the same label with the same guidelines that is prescribed by the Food and Drug Regulations. These guidelines determine that the nutrition label must be clearly and predominantly displayed on the package to the manufacturer as well as clearly visible to the consumer at the time of purchase. A Canadian nutrition Label displaying information in both English and French According to the Canadian Government, the following foods are exempted from being required to have a food label: * Fresh fruits and vegetables * Raw meat and poultry * Raw seafood * Foods prepared or processed in store (i.e. bakery items, salads) * Foods that contain very few nutrients (i.e. tea, coffee) * Alcoholic beverages What most Canadians use nutrition labels for: * Compare two food products * Be well informed in regards to nutrients so that the consumer has the ability to make a healthy choice should they want to * Have the ability to better manage special diets (i.e. low-carb diet) * Eat more or less of a nutrient * See how much of a daily nutrient one is taking  Units of measure  In Canada, food products are required to be labelled as to net quantity on the main display panel. The net quantity must be in metric units in English and French, in type that is at least 1.6 millimetres (1/16\\") high. (If international metric symbols such as \\"L\\" or \\"g\\" are used instead of words, these are considered bilingual.) Optionally, Canadian (imperial) or U.S. customary units may be listed in addition to the metric units. In cases where a U.S. unit is used that is smaller than the same-named imperial unit, \\"U.S.\\" must be designated. (This is not necessary when the U.S. unit is equal to or larger than the imperial unit.) Because these units are optional, they do not need to be stated bilingually, but may be given in English, French, or both. Rules specify what kinds of food are to be labelled by volume (most liquids), weight (most non-liquids), or count.  Date markings  * Packaging date: the date a food is placed into a package for the first time for resale to a consumer; or the date a prepackaged product is weighed by a retailer in a package in which it will be offered for sale. * Storage instructions: How a product should be stored. Can include temperature, humidity, and light conditions. * Durable life: The period between when a prepackaged package is packaged for resale and when it is good until; based on proper conditions. When the product expires, meaning that it is no longer fit for consumption, it is known as the expiry or best before date. An expiration date in one in which the manufacturer does not recommend the product be consumed (they can be located on any label panel). According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the following foods are exempted from having to have a durable life or packaging date: * Prepackaged fresh fruits and vegetables (including prepackaged, chopped or shredded fresh fruit and vegetables); * Prepackaged individual portions of food served by restaurants, airlines or other commercial enterprises with meals or snacks (e.g., milk, cheese packets - as they are intended for immediate consumption); * Prepackaged individual servings of food prepared by a commissary and sold in automatic vending machines or mobile canteens (e.g., sandwiches); and * Prepackaged donuts It should be acknowledged that a durable life date is NOT an indicator of food safety. Once something is opened, depending on how it is stored, the shelf life can change. For example, an open box of crackers meant to expire in two weeks, will expire much faster should the seal be left open after each use.  Geographical indications  A product's geographical indications will tell where the product comes from. In Canada not everything can be locally produced, especially in the winter months in regards to fresh produce. This is why Canada often imports foods such as apples and oranges from places such as Florida and Fiji. Canada's climate only ensures that the citizens have the ability to eat local produce six months of the year. The rest of the year, people who wish to continue a well balanced diet, must purchase produce from grocery stores which buy their produce from other countries. Imported goods Although readily available in the warmer months, the following food products are imported when not able to be grown or raised in Canada due to its varying climate: * Dairy products * Seafood * Honey * Fresh fruits and vegetables * Meat and poultry products * Processed products (ex: fruit, vegetables, maple products) Each one of these categories of imported goods have strict guidelines and a minimum standard that they must abide by under the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in order to gain access to Canada. This is to ensure the safety and health of the public. For example, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Regulations listed under the Canada Agricultural Products Act set out \\"packaging, labelling and grade requirements for fresh fruits and vegetables entering into interprovincial or import trade in Canada\\".  Advertising  All advertising for foods and alcoholic beverages is subject to review by the Food and Drugs Act, Food and Drug Regulations and the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act and Regulations. Generally, \\"mandatory information or claims that are acceptable on a food label may also be used to advertise that food\\". Any type of advertisement that may create a false impression should be avoided as it will then be subject to review by the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act. In today's society there are many ways in which a company can advertise their products, including radio, television, print and internet; all of these methods have different ways in which they are regulated. A Coca-Cola advertisement from the 1950s Radio and television advertisements are reviewed by the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations prior to being allowed to be broadcast. This is to ensure that the potential customers will receive the correct information about a product prior to purchase. It is listed under the Code of Ethics of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters that \\"no commercial message containing a claim or endorsement of a food or non-alcoholic beverage to which the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations apply may be broadcast unless the script for the commercial message or endorsement has been approved by the Food and Beverage Clearance Section of Advertising Standards Canada (ASC) and carries a current script clearance number\\" There is currently no compulsory law regulating print advertisements. However, a company can voluntarily submit an advertisement for review to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's Food and Labelling Information Service should the company see fit. Internet advertising is subject to the same criteria as other advertising and is available to the entire Internet-connected world. Many companies utilize this, as it has the capability to reach a large number of people for a low cost and with little effort.

Featured in the Irish poem The Voyage of Bran and the narrative Cormac's Adventure in the Land of Promise, it represents entry into the Celtic Otherworld or T√≠r na n√ìg.  Literary examples = Voyage of Bran  In Imram Brain (\\"Voyage of Bran\\"), the silver apple branch with white apple blossoms was brought to Bran mac Febail by a mysterious woman, who disclosed that the branch of white silver () was from Emain (or Emne), presumably the land where she hailed from. After singing verses describing her land as the place of delight (with poetic names such as the \\"Plain of White Silver\\"); thereafter she slipped away, and the branch sprang back to her, with Bran having no power to keep it in his grasp. Bran then mounted on a voyage and reached the Land of Women (T√≠r inna m-Ban), ed., \\"Voyage of Bran\\" ¬∂62. pp. 30‚Äì31 which is Emain, at least according to some commentators. Some other commentators venture the silver branch Bran saw originated in Emain Ablach, even though that extended form does not appear in the text of the Imram Brain. The land of the branch turned out to be some sort of \\"Otherworld\\", for even though Bran and his crew believed they tarried at the Land of Women for a year, it turned out to be many years, even centuries, so that when they approached Ireland, they learned that they had become ancient history, and a member who tried to set foot on land turned into ashes. ed., \\"Voyage of Bran\\" ¬∂62‚Äì65, pp. 30‚Äì33 golden bough of Roman legend which was required for entry into the Underworld (Pluto). In like manner, the branch (silver or otherwise) is an object given to a human invited by a denizen of the Otherworld to visit his/her realm, offering \\"a clue binding the desired one to enter\\". One of the paralleling examples was the branch seen by Bran. Though not a genuine Celticist, to quote W. H. Evans-Wentz, \\"the silver branch of the sacred apple- tree bearing blossoms.. borne by the Fairy Woman is a passport to T√≠r n-aill (the Celtic Otherworld)\\".  Cormac's adventure  A magical silver branch with three golden apples belonged to the sea deity Manann√°n mac Lir and was given to the high king Cormac mac Airt in the narrative Echtra Cormaic or \\"Cormac's Adventure in the Land of Promise\\". The sea god initially visited Cormac's ramparts (at Tara) as an unidentified warrior from a land \\"wherein there is nought save truth, and there is neither age nor decay nor gloom\\", etc., later identified as the Land of Promise (T√≠r Tairngire). The branch created magical soporific music that assuaged those afflicted with injury or illness to sleep, including \\"women in child-bed\\". In a variant text under the title \\"How Cormac mac Airt Got his Branch\\", the same object is not described as a silver branch, but rather a \\"glittering fairy branch with nine apples of red gold\\". Here, the branch possessed the additional ability make people forget their woes. Cormac bargained his wife and children away to obtain the branch, and when the wife and daughter learn of this to their utter disheartening, Cormac jiggles the branch to cause their sorrows to depart. This ability is reminiscent of the grief-soothing lapdog Petit Cr√ª and its jingling bell in Tristan and Isolde, as pointed out by Gertrude Schoepperle.  Dialogue of the Two Sages  Also, in Immacallam in d√° Thuarad, or The Dialogue of the Two Sages, the mystic symbol used by gods, fairies, magicians, and by all initiates who know the mystery of life and death, is thus described as a Druid symbol:‚Äì'Neidhe' (a young bard who aspired to succeed his father as chief poet of Ulster), \\"made his journey with a silver branch over him. The Anradhs, or poets of the second order, carried a silver branch, but the Ollamhs, or chief poets, carried a branch of gold; all other poets bore a branch of bronze.\\"Cf. .The Colloquy of the Two Sages. ed. and trans. by Whitley Stokes.

In 1981 Donnay reported a turnover of 2.1 billion Belgian francs. Donnay's fortunes began to fade when Borg retired in 1983. Its success had been too closely aligned with Borg's success, and the company lost money for four years before entering administration in 1988 after amassing debts of $35 million. The company had apparently lacked the negotiation skills to attract another player of Borg's standing as a figurehead. The Donnay family still controlled 55 percent of the company when it went bankrupt in 1988. The Walloon and Belgian governments held the remaining shares. The company was acquired by a group of investors, led by Bernard Tapie with a 51 percent stake, the Walloon government with 29 percent and Albert Frere with 20 percent. In 1991 Tapie sold his 58 percent stake in the company to the Walloon government for $16.2 million in order to finance the acquisition of Adidas shares. The government sold the factory to an Italian sports equipment manufacturer, Carbon Valley, and retained the brand rights.

The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1898 by the architect Jacob Wilhelm Nordan. The church seats about 200 people. The church was consecrated on 14 September 1898 by the local Dean Andreas D. Jespersen.

From the upper parts of the Gr√∏ndalen valley down to the fjord it was a distance of which included crossing five lakes by boat. From the fjord to Bru Church it was another across the sea, which took about four hours by row boat (if the weather was fine). They had to go all the way to the Svan√∏y Church, not only for ordinary worship services, but also for baptism ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. In 1887, the local residents began asking for their own church, and two years later the decision was made to get started on the project. The people in the valley had raised , and the same sum was allocated by the Norwegian Parliament and the municipality of Kinn. The \\"Kinn Sparebank\\" (savings bank) also donated , so the total sum raised was which was enough to cover the construction costs. At first, the parish vicar was somewhat reluctant to have a new church building because this implied that he would have to travel more frequently. Furthermore, when the church was completed, he tried to confine the services to the summer months, but the parish council objected. In the first years, services were held five times a year, preferably in the winter. Nowadays services are held fourteen times a year.

Although the long-term goal is to model all 959 cells of the C. elegans, the first stage is to model the worm's locomotion by simulating the 302 neurons and 95 muscle cells. This bottom up simulation is being pursued by the OpenWorm community. As of this writing, a physics engine called Sibernetic has been built for the project and models of the neural connectome and a muscle cell have been created in NeuroML format. A 3D model of the worm anatomy can be accessed through the web via the OpenWorm browser. The OpenWorm project is also contributing to develop Geppetto,Geppetto a web-based multi-algorithm, multi- scale simulation platform engineered to support the simulation of the whole organism. __TOC__  Background: C. elegans  The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is a free-living, transparent nematode, about 1 mm in length, that lives in temperate soil environments. It is the type species of its genus. An adult Caenorhabditis elegans worm C. elegans has one of the simplest nervous systems of any organism, with its hermaphrodite type having only 302 neurons. Furthermore, the structural connectome of these neurons is fully worked out. There are fewer than one thousand cells in the whole body of a C. elegans worm, and because C. Elegans is a model organism, each has a unique identifier and comprehensive supporting literature. Being a model organism, the genome is fully known, along with many well characterized mutants readily available, a comprehensive literature of behavioural studies, etc. With so few neurons and new calcium 2 photon microscopy techniques it should soon be possible to record the complete neural activity of a living organism. By manipulating the neurons through optogenetic techniques, combined with the above recording capacities the project is in an unprecedented position to be able to fully characterize the neural dynamics of an entire organism. In the process of trying to build an \\"in silico\\" model of a relatively simple organism like C. elegans, new tools are being developed which will make it easier to model progressively more complex organisms. NemaLoad Project Nemaload NemaLoad was created as a research program trying to empirically establish the relevant biological facts which are necessary for a true bottom-up simulation. The project founder, David Dalrymple, is a collaborator on the OpenWorm project. OpenWorm project Although the ultimate goal is to simulate all features of C. elegans' behaviour, the project is new and the first behaviour the OpenWorm community decided to simulate is a simple motor response: teaching the worm to crawl. To do so, the virtual worm must be placed in a virtual environment. A full feedback loop must be established: Environmental Stimulus > Sensory Transduction > Interneuron Firing > Motor Neuron Firing > Motor Output > Environmental Change > Sensory Transduction. There are two main technical challenges here: modelling the neural/electrical properties of the brain as it processes the information, and modelling the mechanical properties of the body as it moves. The neural properties are being modeled by a Hodgkin-Huxley model, and the mechanical properties are being modeled by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic algorithm. The OpenWorm team built an engine called Geppetto which could integrate these algorithms and due to its modularity will be able to model other biological systems (like digestion) which the team will tackle at a later time. The team also built an environment called NeuroConstruct which is able to output neural structures in NeuroML. Using NeuroConstruct the team reconstructed the full connectome of C. elegans. Using NeuroML the team has also built a model of a muscle cell. Note that these models currently only model the relevant properties for the simple motor response: the neural/electrical and the mechanical properties discussed above. The next step is to connect this muscle cell to the six neurons which synapse on it and approximate their effect. The rough plan is to then both: * Approximate the synapses which synapse on those neurons * Repeat the process for other muscle cells Progress , the project is still awaiting peer review, and researchers involved in the project are reluctant to make bold claims about its current resemblance to biological behavior; project coordinator Stephen Larson estimates that they are \\"only 20 to 30 percent of the way towards where we need to get\\".  Related projects  In 1998 Japanese researchers announced the Perfect C. elegans Project. A proposal was submitted, but the project appears to have been abandoned. In 2004 a group from Hiroshima began the Virtual C. elegans Project. They released two papers which showed how their simulation would retract from virtual prodding. In 2005 a Texas researcher described a simplified C. elegans simulator based on a 1-wire network incorporating a digital Parallax Basic Stamp processor, sensory inputs and motor outputs. Inputs employed 16-bit A/D converters attached to operational amplifier simulated neurons and a 1-wire temperature sensor. Motor outputs were controlled by 256-position digital potentiometers and 8-bit digital ports. Artificial muscle action was based on Nitinol actuators. It used a \\"sense-process-react\\" operating loop which recreated several instinctual behaviors. These early attempts of simulation have been criticized for not being biologically realistic. Although we have the complete structural connectome, we do not know the synaptic weights at each of the known synapses. We do not even know whether the synapses are inhibitory or excitatory. To compensate for this the Hiroshima group used machine learning to find some weights of the synapses which would generate the desired behaviour. It is therefore no surprise that the model displayed the behaviour, and it may not represent true understanding of the system. Open science The Open Worm community is committed to the ideals of open science. Generally this means that the team will try to publish in open access journals and include all data gathered (to avoid the file drawer problem). Indeed, all the biological data the team has gathered is publicly available, and the five publications the group has made so far are available for free on their website. All the software that OpenWorm has produced is completely free and open source. Open Worm is also trying a radically open model of scientific collaboration. The team consists of anyone who wishes to be a part of it. There are over one hundred \\"members\\" who are signed up for the high volume technical mailing list. Of the most active members who are named on a publication there are collaborators from Russia, Brazil, England, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. To coordinate this international effort, the team uses \\"virtual lab meetings\\" and other online tools that are detailed in the resources section.

He was known as an advocate for co-education and women's education, which led to tensions with the university regents and, ultimately, his ouster.  Early life and career  John Hanson Twombly was born on July 19, 1814 in Rochester, New Hampshire. He was mostly self-educated and worked through his youth. In 1843, he graduated from Wesleyan University and became a Methodist minister. He taught at Wesleyan University from 1843 to 1845. Twombly married Betsy Dow, the daughter of a Vermont minister, on November 26, 1844. He worked at Massachusetts churches and became an overseer at Harvard College from 1855 to 1867. He also worked as the New England Education Society secretary from 1857 to 1871, the American Institute director from 1868 to 1870, and Charlestown, Massachusetts public schools superintendent from 1866 to 1870.  Madison  Twombly was elected to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison presidency by the UW regents on June 30, 1871 for a September start. He was the university's fourth president. Samuel Fallows, UW class of 1859 and a local Reformed Episcopal Church bishop, was Twombly's main advocate. The regents thought he would raise funds for the university. He was known as a powerful speaker and advocated for co-education against the interests of the regents. The regents withheld some of his executive power due to their doubt, and eventually asked him to resign in June 1873. He refused and their case was brought to the Wisconsin Legislature, who supported Twombly along with the public and students. He never found the favor of the faculty. Twombly resigned on January 21, 1874 in response to the regents' determination. His legacy includes his advocacy for women's education. He became a minister again, and worked in Northeast churches.

Kit's core series of books was written by Valerie Tripp and illustrated by Walter Rane. Concept and creation Development of the character started in 1998, while series author Valerie Tripp was working on the Josefina books. Tripp cites Cincinnati's proximity to the Ohio River, along with the city's industries, works programs such as the Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration, and the Cincinnati Union Terminal, as the reasons for her choice of where the Kit Kittredge stories took place. The city's association with baseball, particularly the Cincinnati Reds and player Ernie Lombardi was also incorporated into the narrative. Tripp also stated that she drew inspiration from her mother's experiences during the Great Depression, and also from her daughter's tales of affluenza, which she used to teach children the importance of being grateful for what they have and helping those in need. Coinciding with the doll's release was a food drive and a fundraising program hosted by various charitable organizations. Character overview Kit was born as Margaret Mildred Kittredge on May 19, 1923 in Cincinnati, Ohio to a well-to-do family, and was named after her mother and her Aunt Millie. She, however, prefers to go by a nickname given to her by her family, which was taken from both her surname and the song Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag. Kit's father, Jack, owned a car dealership business in Cincinnati and was a World War I veteran. Her father's business still seemed to do well during the onset of the Great Depression, but was eventually forced to close when Jack used up his savings to pay his employees, sending the Kittredges into poverty. Kit is first seen in Meet Kit wearing a lavander-pink sweater and cardigan, a floral print pleated skirt and a pair of white canvas sandals. As her family suffered financially during the Great Depression, she was later seen wearing hand-me- downs or used clothing, and at one point during her birthday, her aunt Millie made her a dress from feed sacks, for which she was eventually grateful. Kit is the only historical American Girl to have short hair. To reflect her era, her hair is cut into a bob, although in some illustrations she is shown to be wearing it in short pigtails. With the launch of American Girl's BeForever revamp, Kit's meet outfit was retconned to that of a bright blue-green sleeveless dress with a white Peter Pan collar, and a flared skirt with floral print. Kit's old meet outfit was still available for purchase as a separate item for a time before being discontinued. Attributes Unlike her best friend Ruthie, Kit is a tomboy who cares less about dresses, chores and things that she considers \\"flouncy\\". She is more inclined towards baseball (especially Ernie Lombardi of the Cincinnati Reds), adventures such as Robin Hood, country life, and typing up her own news reports, as she dreams of becoming a reporter one day. Kit hates change, even though at one point she did long for it to happen, and dislikes being dependent on charities, which spurs her fascination with Amelia Earhart. The books also depict her as being stubborn and somewhat fussy, as she finds chores around the house to be rather boring and tedious, though eventually she realizes her family's misfortunes and learns to be more supportive and helpful. She has a strong sense of pride, but she eventually realizes that she is carried away by it and learns to be humble, and tackle her problems with thrift and cleverness. Kit also tends to be easily embarrassed and irritated, like in Kit Learns a Lesson where she is angered by one of her classmates who teased her for her family's sudden descent into poverty. Kit is also shown to be close to her father, as depicted in the film, and in the aforementioned part where Kit pushed her classmate for his taunts against her father and family. Appearances=Main book seriesFirst to third books= Upon hearing about Mrs. Howard and her son Stirling moving into the Kittredge household while her husband was off to Chicago for work, Kit was excited to have a boy of her age to play with. Her hopes were dashed when she learns about Stirling's poor health, though both shared their enthusiasm for baseball. Excited, Kit rushes to her room and comes back bringing an article about Ernie Lombardi, only to hit Mrs. Howard causing Kit's mother's dishes to break as they flew off the tray. Margaret chastises Kit for her brash behavior. Angered and disappointed, Kit stormed to her room, blaming Stirling for her misfortune. As she was waiting for her father to come in so she could share her article, Charlie came in, explaining how Kit's situation was nothing compared to those who lost their jobs because of the Depression. Kit, while writing of ways for her to help save money, hoped for her Dad to get a job, but this proved futile as Jack often came home in vain. Kit's mother then comes up with taking in boarders, much to the surprise of Kit's ill-tempered Uncle Hendrick. Kit wasn't pleased with the idea either, more so as Stirling, whom she initially had a chagrined relationship with, will be staying in her old room, and she has to sleep in the attic. Ruthie assures her about the attic, likening it to Sara Crewe's room in A Little Princess. Kit tearfully relents, and makes the most of her new surroundings as she cleaned and fixed her room, to which her mother praised. Kit and her family are still adjusting to the changes brought by taking up boarders in their household and the chores involved in it in Kit Learns a Lesson. She is hoping that her father would land a job some day, so much that in an altercation, she was incensed at her classmate Roger's remarks towards her father and her family's financial problems, spoiling the preparations for a Thanksgiving pageant. A trip to the local soup kitchen as part of their punishment made her realize the plight of those surrounding her besides her own family, even more so as her father was one of those in line for lunch. With Kit's family facing financial problems, along with the threat of their house being foreclosed, Ruthie tries to come to Kit's aid in Kit's Surprise, cheering up her best friend with fairy-tale stories and helping her like paying for Kit's movie ticket; Kit feels embarrassed at being subjected to charity and is annoyed at Ruthie's fanciful, idealistic worldview, viewing it as unrealistic. Kit's sense of pride gets the better of her and this eventually led to an argument, begrudgingly parting ways with each other. Uncle Hendrick's spitefulness towards her family added to her problems, but Kit is grateful for the errands he gave as she earned more than enough to help her family. The heavy snow forced Kit to spend the night at Hendrick's house. Kit has to call Ruthie to ask her to inform her parents about her stay at her uncle's home‚ÄîKit apologizes to her best friend, and they both make amends. =Fourth to sixth books= Kit's Aunt Millie paid a visit from Kentucky to Cincinnati to help out her family, using the moniker \\"Use It Up, Wear It Down, Make It Due, or Do Without\\". Kit makes a \\"Waste-Not Want-Not Almanac\\", which includes the thrifty tips, and also adopts a dog and names it Grace. When Aunt Millie comes to her school and announces a Penny-Pinching party for her birthday, Kit's classmates now learn of her family's poverty; she loses her temper and lashes out at Aunt Millie, hurting the latter. However, she later feels guilty. Hearing that Aunt Millie is heading back to Kentucky, the family goes to convince her to come back. Kit, knowing that it's her fault, eventually apologizes for her behavior, and shows Aunt Millie the almanac she made, who forgives her. The party is a success. Kit befriends a young hobo named Will Shepherd in Kit Saves The Day, spurring her fascination with life at the hobo jungle. Having being burned out by the endless chores and errands at home, and with her brother working with the Civilian Conservation Corps in Montana, Kit, with no other choice, decides to go on an adventure with Will, who shared his experiences as a runaway teen leaving his family behind and resorting to morally questionable means to survive such as petty theft and faking illness to gain sympathy. Will reluctantly takes her and Stirling to the dangerous act of \\"riding the rails\\"‚Äîhitchhiking aboard freight trains, a common practice by destitute people of the time to find work. This fell through when Kit is arrested and jailed for her antics. Feigning illness, Kit escapes, but Will and Stirling are left behind. Kit rushes home to explain the situation to her parents, and they went back to rescue the boys. Kit's experiences with the hobo camp gave her a sense of respect for the less fortunate. As the Kittredge family adapts to the changes they experienced during the Great Depression, Uncle Hendrick comes to stay at the Kittredge boarding house for the winter. Kit is tasked by Hendrick to write letters to the editor on his behalf expressing his dissatisfaction with society and Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs. His angry letters, some of which were scathing rants at the expense of the hobo community, concerned Kit, which led her to write an editorial in support of those in need, especially about the struggles less fortunate children had to endure. Kit's editorial is published, spurring people to donate goods to children at the soup kitchen. Kit finally accepts that she was unwilling to accept change and having misfortunes. Her behavior had been terrible; she had been prideful, impetuous, shallow, hot-tempered, mean, selfish, defiant, impulsive, prickly, cocky, and thoughtless. Kit learned the error of her ways, admits that she was very insecure, and has now become much flexible, more thoughtful, and much more kinder. With the change of her heart, demeanor and outlook on life, Kit's life is now much more stable. Love, kindness, care, giving, sharing, fairness, tact, respect, common sense, honesty, family, and helping those in need are what shape Kit's life. Other books In addition to being a supporting character in Really Truly Ruthie, a companion book which came bundled with the Ruthie Smithens doll, Kit also appeared in a number of mysteries set in the Kit Kittredge sub-series, and a gamebook where the reader takes on the role of a person who found her way to the past and befriends Kit, of which she embarks on an adventure depending on the reader's choices. Film rendition In the film version, Kit, portrayed by Abigail Breslin, hasn't been radically changed from her original book portrayal; several minor details however were altered in the film, namely her brother Charlie and Aunt Millie as unseen characters and only mentioned in passing, and other changes to her and her relatives' backstory. In other media A feature film Kit Kittredge: An American Girl was released to theaters on July 2, 2008, starring Abigail Breslin in the title role. Breslin's performance in the film was praised by critics; Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote that she \\"carries the event- stuffed story with unflagging grace\\". Several new items were added to Kit's collection to coincide with the film. Two video games based on her stories were also developed and published, namely Kit Mystery Challenge for the Nintendo DS, and the point-and-click adventure game A Tree House of My Own for Microsoft Windows. Kittredge was also parodied in an episode of the animated comedy show Mad, where she was portrayed as having a daughter who participated in a parody of Toddlers and Tiaras. Reception Nancy Davis Kho of Common Sense Media praised the character's portrayal and Valerie Tripp's depiction of the novels' early to mid 1930s setting, stating how she found Kit to be an \\"inherently likable character, upbeat and friendly but by no means perfect\\". Kho noted how despite the character's shortcomings and initially negative and callous attitude towards those surrounding her, Kit's approach towards adversity \\"is a good lesson for kids in any situation.\\" Kho also drew parallels to the 2008 financial crisis (which coincided with the release of the film adaptation), and remarked how the stories were a cautionary tale on dealing with a declining economy; \\"Even so, the main character's pluckiness will have readers rooting for her to prevail.\\" Jennifer Frey of The Washington Post also noted the film adaptation's relevance to the financial crisis, stating that it \\"highlights one effect of setting a fictional story in an all- too-real and relevant past: History lessons become current-event lessons.\\" See also * Hilde Lysiak, an American child writer notable for her newspaper story on a suspected murder References Category:American Girl Category:Book series introduced in 2000 Category:Characters in American novels of the 21st century Category:Characters in children's literature Category:Child characters in literature Category:Child characters in film Category:Child characters in video games Category:Female characters in literature Category:Fictional amateur detectives Category:Fictional characters from Cincinnati Category:Literary characters introduced in 2000 Category:Fictional female detectives Category:Fictional journalists and mass media people Category:Fictional prison escapees Category:Fictional reporters Category:Novels adapted into video games Category:Toy characters Category:Video game protagonists ","title":"Kit Kittredge"},{"id":"41077636","text":"Ernst Albert G√§umann (6 October 1893 ‚Äì 5 December 1963) was a Swiss botanist and mycologist.

Since the 1930s, the Bakoya, in particular, have settled in Gabon in the Ogooue-Ivindo Province, in the northeastern region of the country. Similar minority groups are the Babongo and the Baka pygmies. Before they adapted to the agricultural practices in the new settlements in Gabon along the flanks of the road, Bakoya were ‚Äúsemi-nomadic hunter-gatherers‚Äù like the other forest-dwelling pygmies; they resided in small huts. The word 'Pygmee' is a French coinage, adopted by the Gabonese. They are the earliest inhabitants of the forest and are nomadic hunter gatherers. Location Pygmies living in the Imbong village are specifically known as Bakoya. They are situated in the Ogooue-Ivindo Province, which is one of the nine provinces of Gabon. They are settled along the M√©kambo to Mazingo (Canton Djoua) road and (Canton Djoua), and from M√©kambo to Ekata (Canton Lou√©) road in the Zadi√© Department. History Following the many internecine wars among the tribal groups of the region, the Bakoya, who were living on the banks of the Ogoou√© River migrated along with the non-pygmy group of Bongom to an upstream region of the Ivindo and Zadi√© Rivers. According to the oral traditions of the Bakoya, during their travel through the forests they accompanied the Bongom, a non-pygmie tribe. While the Bongom moved out of the forests and established themselves on the M√©kambo-Mazingo Road by setting up the villages of Ego, Grand Itumbi, Ngunangu and Ibea, the Bakoya had stayed back in the forest to harvest their crops of u.panda (Panda oleosa) and did not move to the M√©kambo- Mazingo Road immediately. At this time the French who had colonized Gabon also created better living facilities. The Bakoya, Baka and Babongo are three minorities groups of Gabon who are known as the ‚ÄúPygmies of Gabon‚Äù (said to be the first people to inhabit the forests of Gabon) and they form a very small minority of a few thousand people only. All of them have left behind their hunter-gatherer vocation to more \\"sedentary\\" modern way of life. Their skills of hunting game with ‚Äúbow and poisoned arrows, game traps and harpoons‚Äù are however much more skillful than the majority population of the Bantu community in the country. But their lot is subject to humiliation at the hands of the Bantus. However, in recent years there is an effort to project their history as a matter of tourism interest and their culture has been brought forth in the form of exhibitions, lectures and discussions. One such initiative was taken in 2002 when an exhibition was organized to project the history of pygmies and their culture. The government of Gabon recognized the Minorit√©s Autochtones Pygm√©es au Gabon (MINAPYGA; the Indigenous Pygmy Minorities of Gabon) organization of Bokayo in 1997, which is one of three such indigenous organizations in the country; the other two recognized groups are the Edzendgui and the Association pour le Developpement de la Culture des Peuples Pygmees du Gabon. Notable people Leonard Odambo is one of the few well educated Bokayo who is a qualified journalist and head of an NGO in Libreville.

It was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on November 10, 1988. Overview The general effect of this legislation is a ban on the manufacture, possession and transfer of firearms with less than 3.7 oz (105 g) of metal content. The bill also requires handguns to be in the traditional shape of a handgun. The Act excepts from its prohibitions the federal government and its agencies, and may offer a safe harbor for licensed manufactures testing to determine if their firearms meet the Act's criteria. History What became the Undetectable Firearms Act began as an attempt to ban handguns like the Glock 17 in the mid-1980s. Pistols like the Glock had frames and grips made from lightweight polymer, and their novelty prompted public criticism that their relative lack of metal content meant they might be able to slip past airport metal detection and be suitable for use by terrorists. Initial proposals to ban handguns with less than 8 oz of steel were opposed by the National Rifle Association (NRA), and what resulted was a compromise that banned guns with less than half the metal content of the Glock. The NRA agreed not to oppose the Act because it did not affect any existing guns. Introduced by William J. Hughes (D-NJ), it passed overwhelmingly in October 1988. The gun control lobby was eager to promote it as one of the first successes of groups like Handgun Control, Inc (later the Brady Campaign). The Act set the stage for the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. Renewals The original Act had a ten-year sunset clause, and would have expired on November 10, 1998. Congress subsequently renewed it in 1998 for five years, in 2003 for ten years, and in 2013 for another ten years. Proposals to extend the scope of the law at the 2013 renewal were unsuccessful. At that time, the NRA continued to support the law but opposed any extension of its scope. Application to 3D printing With the advent of projects like the Wiki Weapon, 3D printing technologies have been noted for their abilities to help create largely polymer and ceramic firearms. Various groups of makers and tech enthusiasts have experimented with the technology in this capacity as well, leading to widespread speculation that traditional methods of gun control will become increasingly inoperable. Proposed renewals and expansions of the current Undetectable Firearms Act (, ) include provisions to criminalize individual production of firearm receivers and magazines that do not include arbitrary amounts of metal, measures outside the scope of the original UFA and not extended to cover commercial manufacture. These \\"modernization\\" proposals have been criticized as disingenuous attempts to suppress adoption of and experimentation with 3D printers in home gunsmithing.

Wheeler was also influential in the society's creation because she convinced future founder of the society, Henry Bergh, who at the time was founder of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, to take on the issue and spearhead the case. Background Etta Angell was born in Spencerport, New York, a suburb area of Rochester. She resided with her mother, Sally Angell, and sister Elizabeth Spencer, and it was here she met Charles Wheeler, whom she married. Charles Wheeler later inherited a moderate home from his deceased father in New York, New York. Career In New York City, Etta Wheeler was a Methodist missionary of St. Luke's Mission for the poor. Her work consisted of going to poor parishioners of her church and providing meals, supplies, and donations from the mission. She further added to her duties by checking in on individuals, conversing with them, and providing aid around their homes. She was assigned two routes; between West 38th Street and West 42nd Street and between 47th Street and 53rd Street. These areas that were later referred to as Hell's Kitchen. When able, Wheeler extended her care to those who were not part of the church. Charles Wheeler was a reporter for the New York Daily News, a position which he held for more than 12 years. While her husband worked long hours at the paper, Etta was consumed with her work for the mission and she devoted her life to the church and taking care of the needy. Once married, the Wheelers decided against having any children because they believed there were already too many unloved children in the world. The Wheelers lived outside the slums. Role as rescuer Mary Ellen Wilson, also known as Mary Ellen McCormack, in 1874 It was on one of her rounds on 41st Street, in December 1873, that a tenant of a building approached Wheeler and spoke of a family, the Connollys, that once resided there. They apparently had with them a little daughter that was barely seen but her screams and the mother's, Mary Connolly, brutality, were often heard. Within the week Wheeler paid the family a visit at their new location under the pretense that she wanted to speak to them about an ill neighbor adjacent them. All the while, Wheeler paid close attention to the child who was present in the back of the room washing dishes. After her initial contact with the family, Wheeler spoke to Pastor Frank Jameson about how to intervene on the child's behalf, but was told that they could not interfere. In search of other options, she spent numerous months trying to locate an agency that would assist her in removing the child from the home, but of the dozens of children's charities she contacted she was told that they were not allowed to interfere in family matters. The most these agencies could do was donate clothing; they lacked the power to remove the child from guardian custody. The New York police told her that there was a law that prevented the removal of a child from their guardian without sufficient evidence. Her niece informed her that she should be talking to Henry Bergh, the founder of American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. On April 7, 1874 Wheeler met with Bergh and conveyed the story of the abused girl and asked for his assistance. Bergh reiterated the statements of the police, and said that if Wheeler provided evidence, she might have a case. That day Etta Wheeler went to both buildings where the Connolly family lived in the past few months, collecting witnesses and documenting the incidents of suspected child abuse. The next day she had formulated a detailed letter to Bergh providing evidence and testimonies from numerous witnesses. Wheeler's thorough investigation provided sufficient evidence for Bergh to present to a Supreme Court Judge which not only granted them a case but also grounds to remove Mary Ellen Wilson and apprehend her mother. Influences A detail from the facade of 295 Park Avenue South at 23rd Street in the Flatiron District of Manhattan, New York City, built in 1892 as the headquarters of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The building was designed by Renwick, Aspinwall & Renwick. The trial of Mary Ellen was very popular. It held continuous headlines in the media and drew much publicity. Wheeler's husband was a reporter for a newspaper and may have helped contribute to the media coverage of the case. Wheeler testified during the trial, attended every court proceeding, and was Mary Ellen Wilson's advocate. On April 27, 1874, Mary Connolly was found guilty of one count of assault with intent to kill. Wheeler then asked Bergh about creation of a society for the prevention of cruelty to children. On December 15, 1874, the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was established with co-founders Henry Bergh and Elbridge T Gerry, the prosecutor of Mary Ellen Wilson's case. Directly after the trial, Wheeler fought to ensure the child was placed in an adequate home and appealed to the judge to have Mary Ellen placed with her family in upstate New York. Henry Bergh wrote a character reference letter to the Supreme Court judge. Mrs. Wheeler's younger sister and her husband were given permission to take the child in as their legal ward. Legacy Later in her life, at the age of 24, Mary Ellen married and had 2 daughters. The first she named Etta to honor the woman who rescued her. In dedication to her heroic actions which provided services and hope to future abused children, on October 13-16th, 1913, Wheeler was invited to attend the 37th annual meeting of the American Humane Association's national conference in Rochester, New York. Wheeler was the guest speaker and presented her keynote address, The Story of Mary Ellen which was later published by the American Humane Association, called The Story of Mary Ellen: Which started the Child Saving Crusade. Wheeler died December 5, 1921, in Coldwater, New York at the home of her niece, Miss Lille Thompson. In preservation of her service and legacy, the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children constructed a memorial that was placed in the Society's Heckscher Foundation for Children's building located, on Fifth Avenue, from 104th Street to 105th Street.

Yangyang is famous for its beautiful scenery and this gave Yi a strong attachment to nature from an early age. She graduated from Sorabol College of the Arts (Today Chung-Ang University) and began submitting her writing to annual spring literary contests at age 19, but not winning until 1973 when she won the Seoul Daily annual spring literary contest. Lee's writing was intimately connected to her personal life and when she married a banker many people, including the author herself, worried if this would adversely affect her ability to write. Her marriage was a bit of a surprise as she had always planned to not get married and instead concentrate on writing. In the end, however, marriage and children did not affect Yi's ability to write and her strong dedication to writing helped to bring may contradictions in the state of Korean women to light.\\"Yi Kyoung-ja\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: Work One of the salient features of Lee's works is the flowing style of her sentences, which makes her writing fast-paced and readable whether it's a short story or full-length novel. It is within internal character dialogue, however, where her lively prose really shines. Lee often uses such dialogue as a means of revealing characters' conflicts and anguish. In these internal conversations, she uses authentic and colloquial language without excessive embellishment. Her novels feel genuine to readers due to the reality effect created by her natural use of everyday language. Even during the 1980s, when ideological discourse dominated literature, author Lee Kyung-ja's prose offered a sentimental view of women's experiences. It is misguided, however, to focus on the mere fact that she is a female author writing about women.Source-attribution \\"Ïù¥Í≤ΩÏûê\\" biographical PDF available at LTI Korea Library or online at: It isn't easy to sum up her universe of published works including short story collections and full-length novels. Nevertheless, there are some keywords that can provide insight into her works. One of the most important themes Lee is interested in is the caged life of women, similar to that depicted by Guy de Maupassant in Une Vie. In her works concerned with female transformation, two major types can be identified.Source-attribution \\"Ïù¥Í≤ΩÏûê\\" biographical PDF available at LTI Korea Library or online at: One of her novels begins by introducing a married female protagonist who is fretting over the institution of marriage and her husband's indifference. The heroine ultimately ends her marriage after meeting another man, her true love. In Lee's works, most women domesticated under the institution of marriage but later reborn as 'warriors of love,' are originally middle-class housewives enjoying comfortable lives. Lee's full-length novel, [Waking up Alone in the Morning] (1993), is a work of this type.Source-attribution \\"Ïù¥Í≤ΩÏûê\\" biographical PDF available at LTI Korea Library or online at: Lee has also used the biographical format in her novels. In one of Lee's works, the reader is introduced to a heroine who had once been full of hope as a little girl, before being cast into tragedy and suffering after marriage, a transformation that Lee describes in minute detail. In the oral tradition that existed before the modern literary era, women verbally recounted their life stories. In the same fashion, narrators in Lee Kyung-ja's works tell us tales from long lives centered on marriage, birth, unfaithful husbands, family feuds, and other critical events. Lee's acclaimed and prize-winning works such as [Love and Hurt] (1998) and [Affection Never Withers] (1999) are good examples of the kind of work described above.

Manougian was born on April 29, 1935 in Jerusalem. He came to the United States in 1956. His parents are Nishan and Sirpouhi Manougian.Manoug ManougianManoug ManougianAn Interview with Dr. Manoug Manougian, Former Leader of the Lebanese Rocket Society  Personal life and education  Manougian grew up in Jerusalem and was educated at St. George's School, Jerusalem. Manougian won a scholarship to the University of Texas, and he graduated in 1960 with a major in math. Right away, Haigazian College in Beirut was glad to offer him a job teaching both math and physics. The college also made him the faculty advisor for the science club. Manougian met his wife in Armenia circa 1955 when he became her tutor. They eloped shortly after to the United States. While his wife attended school in Ohio, Manougian attended the University of Texas (see above). After graduating, they moved to Beirut.  Career  Manougian married in 1960 and went to Lebanon to become a teacher at Haigazian College.  Lebanese Space Program  He founded the Haigazian College Rocket Society in November 1960. With a very limited budget, the society launched a series of rockets to increasing altitudes. It received funding from the Lebanese government and became the Lebanese Rocket Society. He and his students finally launched a suborbital rocket in 1963. The Cedar IV rocket, launched on Lebanese independence day, 21 November 1963 from Dbayeh north of Beirut, reached and was featured on Lebanese stamps.  Teaching  He returned to the United States in 1966. Manougian completed a master's degree and doctorate at the University of Texas and continued his academic career in the Department of Mathematics at the University of South Florida. He is currently still a professor in the University's Department of Mathematics at the University. He also acts as an adviser for the University's Society of Aeronautics and Rocketry which is currently trying to launch to rocket above the k√°rm√°n line.  Views and politics  As a member of the Armenian diaspora, he has been known to write editorials advocating awareness about the Armenian Genocide. He is also a co- author and associate producer of a 4-hour documentary called The Genocide Factor: The Human Tragedy, that aired on PBS. In addition, he vehemently believes that rocketry and science should be pursued for solely peaceful means. Consequentially, he turned down multiple lucrative offers during his time in the Lebanese Rocket Society rather than let his work be used for military purposes.

Lifson is best known for his consistent force field method, one of the major theories behind 3-D computer modeling of large molecules. In 2013, two scientists who early in their career had worked under his guidance at the Weizmann Institute ‚Äì Arieh Warshel, who was his Ph.D. student, and Michael Levitt ‚Äì won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. That research focused on the development and applications of the consistent force field method to molecular dynamics of proteins.  Early years  Lifson was born in Tel Aviv in 1914, into a family of Russian immigrants. While studying at the Herzliya Hebrew High School, he became active in the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement. In 1932, after completing his studies, Lifson was among the founders of a new kibbutz, now called Nir David, in the Jezreel Valley, in which he served as a teacher in the natural sciences. In 1942, he joined the Palmach underground army, but a year later was demobilized to pursue academic studies. After earning a B.Sc. in physics and mathematics, he returned to teaching, in a school of the kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek. When the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War broke out in 1948, Lifson was drafted into the science corps of the Israel Defense Forces, Hemed, serving under the command of Aharon Katzir, who was then Head of the Department of Polymers at the Weizmann Institute of Science.  Career  RNA as both chicken and egg, the molecular biologist's dream... In 1949, Lifson joined Katzir‚Äôs department at the Weizmann Institute, while at the same time pursuing doctoral studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under Katzir‚Äôs guidance. He earned his Ph.D. in 1954, focusing in his thesis on polyelectrolyte solutions. The research he conducted on this topic in the 1950s still serves as a cornerstone for understanding the behavior of charged macromolecules, biological and synthetic, in water solutions. The activity of such biological macromolecules as DNA, RNA, enzymes and other proteins is altered by temperature, salinity and other external conditions. Lifson used the methods of statistical mechanics to investigate the structural changes of these molecules in solution. Later in his career, Lifson was the principal collaborator in formulating the theory of the helix-coil transition in biological macromolecules, a process whose clarification is essential for understanding structural changes related to protein folding. Lifson then developed a method for calculating the interactions among the forces that various molecular components exert upon one another. Known as the consistent force field method, it makes it possible to characterize molecules in mathematical and physical terms, as well as to predict and calculate the energy of interaction among their components. The ability to compute the forces operating among various atoms with the help of Lifson‚Äôs method has facilitated a basic clarification of the structure and dynamics of biological molecules and eventually led to a breakthrough in understanding protein folding and diseases caused by defective folding. Today, numerous studies of protein folding are designed on the basis of predictions obtained through such computations. The consistent force field method also enables the precise planning of chemical reactions and the study of the function of various molecules in biological systems, among them the interactions between different proteins, the binding of ions to biomolecules, and the redesign of proteins. This method lies at the basis of theoretical computational approaches in modern structural biology. In industry, building molecular models using this method has enhanced the development of drugs, food additives, pesticides and numerous other chemicals.  Honors and Appointments  Lifson held numerous leading positions in research and education in Israel. He served as Scientific Director of the Weizmann Institute (1963-1967) and Dean of its Faculty of Chemistry (1972-1978). He founded the Institute‚Äôs Department of Chemical Physics and served as its Head (1963-1979). In 1970, education minister Yigal Allon appointed Lifson to head a committee examining the need for an open university in Israel. The committee recommended that one be created on the model of institutions existing in the United Kingdom. Upon the establishment of the Open University of Israel, Lifson served as its first rector (1974-1975). He was also editor-in-chief of the Children‚Äôs Britannica in Hebrew, published starting in 1977. Lifson's honors included the Weizmann Prize (1958), the Israel Prize (1969) and election to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (1999). He was appointed an Honorary Fellow of the Open University of Israel (1991), received an honorary Ph.D. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (2000) and was named Yakir Rehovot ‚Äì ‚ÄúDistinguished Resident of Rehovot‚Äù (2000).

Route description=Segment 1 SR 36 begins in Unicoi County as the unsigned companion route of US 19W at the Tennessee-North Carolina state line. US 19W/SR 36 goes west as a narrow 2-lane highway through rural mountainous areas before curving to the north and having a y-intersection with SR 352 (Old US 23). The highway winds its way north to Temple Hill, where they interchange with I-26/US 23 (Exit 43). Here, US 19W becomes concurrent with I-26/US 23 while SR 36 comes to an end. Segment 2Washington County= SR 36 begins in Washington County in Johnson City at a y-intersection with US 11E/US 19W/SR 34. SR 36 then heads northwest as an undivided 4-lane highway and has an interchange with SR 381 before leaving Johnson City and continuing northwest. It passes through Boones Creek, where it has an intersection with SR 354, before passing through Oak Grove and Spurgeon, where it has an intersection with SR 75 which provides access to Gray to southwest and the Tri-Cities Regional Airport and Blountville in the northeast.

SR 36 then widens to 4-lanes again and enters Kingsport and has an interchange with SR 93. SR 36 then passes through a major business district, where it becomes concurrent with SR 126, before passing through several neighborhoods and curving to the west. SR 126 then splits off just west of downtown before SR 36 passes straight through downtown Kingsport.

SR 36 then continues north through several neighborhoods before coming to an end at an intersection with SR 346 at the interchange with US 23/SR 137, less than a mile from the Tennessee-Virginia state line. History US 23 was established in 1930 with a complete concurrency with SR 36, from the North Carolina state line to the Virginia state line; going through Erwin, Unicoi, Johnson City and Kingsport. In 1952, US 23 was rerouted southwest of Ernestville, along SR 81 through Flag Pond and Sam's Gap into North Carolina; its old alignment remained part of US 19W/SR 36\\\\. In 1970, The first segment of a four-lane freeway, designated SR 137, was opened between Johnson City and Kingsport. Over the following decade, SR 137 continued being extended at both ends until in 1982, when AASHTO approved US 23 relocation onto the freeway, leaving behind its old alignment to SR 36 from north of Johnson City to near the Virginia state line. In December 1985, I-181 was established, truncated SR 137 north of US 11W, while SR 36 replaced as new concurrency south of US 11E; all signs and exit numbers were based on US 23 designation. In 1988, AASHTO approved an extension of I-26 from North Carolina to I-81, on contingent upon the completion and certification of interstate standards in North Carolina, which happened in August 2003. Following the new designation, both SR 36 and SR 81 was removed of their concurrencies with US 23\\\\. In March 2007, the remaining spur of I-181, from I-81 to US 11W, was switched to I-26.

Erdmann is also a German forename and a surname. As a forename it was often given to show the connection with the earth. In the Baroque the Republic of Venice sent mineralogical prospectors to the countries north of the Alps to look for the raw materials which were necessary for glassmaking. These prospectors were called \\"Venetians\\" everywhere else and only in the Black Forest they were called \\"Stumm-M√§nnle\\" (meaning \\"dumb little men\\", because they did not speak with the local people) were mostly very small, wore an ankle-long tunic with a hood like the cowl of a monk and carefully avoided contact. These mysterious migrants who worked underground, entered with an empty sack which was filled when they came out of the mountain are obviously the prototype of what the legend turned into the \\"little men of the earth\\" who were seeking or hiding treasures in the dark galleries of the mountains.Badish Newspaper of 26 January 2013: Mystery Surrounding Little Men of the Earth Unveiled  Legend  In the present case there is a legend which speaks of Erdm√§nnlein: this is the diminutive of Erdmann. M√§nnlein can be translated as manikin or little man (dwarf). Erdm√§nnlein - or its variant Erdm√§nnchen - is also the German word for meerkat, a cute little animal that can resemble a tiny man. According to the legend the \\"little men of the earth\\" who gave their name to the Erdmannsh√∂hle were small men which were hardworking and kind and above all helpful.Hasel: Tourism  Description  Caves are seldom in the Black Forest, because in the predominant rock types, which are granite and buntsandstein, its formation is rare. Very different is the situation in the mountain massif of the Dinkelberg between High Rhine, Wiese valley and Wehra valley where muschelkalk predominates which allows the formation of holes by erosion processes. The Erdmannsh√∂hle in Hasel is one of the oldest caves of its type in Germany. The measured total length of the cave is 2185 meters, the part of the cave open to sightseeing is 360 meters long.Hasel: Erdmannsh√∂hle The largest stalactite in the cave, which is mentioned in the Guinness Book of Records, has a height of more than 4 meters and is 2 meters thick at the bottom.

National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences NTUNHS Downtown Campus History Founded in 1954 as Taiwan Provincial Junior College of Nursing, National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences (NTUNHS) has undergone various transformations in its history. In 1963, the college consolidated with Taipei Senior Vocational School of Medicine, and was renamed Taiwan Provincial Vocational School of Nursing and Midwifery, a five-year junior college. Reformed again from a state-run institution in 1994, the school changed its name to National Taipei College of Nursing. This title continued until August 2010, when the School was formally renamed National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences. In the past six decades, NTUNHS has cultivated excellent nursing and health care talent. In Taiwan‚Äôs education history, NTUNHS has accomplished various nursing technological and vocational innovations. Such remarkable achievements epitomize Taiwan‚Äôs nursing technological and vocational development. Since 1994, NTUNHS has established the Department of Medical & Nursing Management and the Department of Infant & Child Care. In 1999, NTUNHS started its master‚Äôs program in Nursing and Health Care Management, Long-Term care, Nursing-Midwifery, Health Allied Education, and Speech & Hearing Disorders and Sciences. Many of our programs are recognized as the pioneers in their fields. NTUNHS‚Äôs current departments and courses cover lifetime health care, thus satisfying NTUNHS‚Äôs health allied and nursing noble educational and humanitarian objectives. In 2002, NTUNHS further established the Department of Exercise & Health Science and Department of Information Management.

It is operated as timetable route 437 from Unna via Fr√∂ndenberg, Menden (Sauerland) and Balve to Neuenrade. The line runs through two tunnels and across seven bridges made of natural stone through the H√∂nne valley, which was already praised for its beauty during the period of German romanticism when it was built.  History  The Menden‚ÄìNeuenrade railway was inaugurated on 1 April 1912, with construction beginning in 1909. At its opening there were stations at Neuenrade, Garbeck, Balve, Sanssouci, Binolen and Lendringsen and halts () at K√ºntrop, Volkringhausen, Klusenstein, Oberr√∂dinghausen and Menden-S√ºd. Horlecke station was located between Lendringsen and Menden-S√ºd, but was no longer classified as a station by 1967. The railway was primarily used for the industry of the H√∂nne valley. Because of the new traffic, limestone bridges were built along the railway in Binolen, Sanssouci, Balve and Garbeck. The economic growth was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, which brought a restriction on passenger traffic. In the ‚Äúturnip winter‚Äù (Steckr√ºbenwinter) of 1917/18, this line also supplied potatoes and grain to the starving population of the Ruhr. After 1925, the operation of excursion passenger trains increased again. Before the Second World War, there were so many visitors to the valley that \\"car-free‚Äù Sundays were introduced to provide guests with rest and relaxation. In the period after the First World War trains from the Ruhr on Sundays carried up to 1000 people travelling to the valley's numerous restaurants. Between the two wars the narrow valley discouraged the development of an Emden‚ÄìH√∂nne valley‚ÄìFrankfurt railway as a north-south link protected against enemy (French) action. The line was disrupted during the war by the destruction of the Ruhr bridge at Fr√∂ndenberg as a result of the floodwave caused by the air raid on the Mohne Dam (Operation Chastise) on 17 May 1943. After the construction of a temporary bridge rail traffic resumed and was also used to supply the labour camp for Schwalbe I (an underground factory built to avoid air raids) at √ñberr√∂dinghausen. Two years later, the railway was closed again by the blowing up of the railway bridge in Sanssouci. In June 1945, traffic was resumed after the construction of a temporary bridge, which was used until 1952. In the mid-1950s, it was the most profitable branch line of the Bundesbahndirektion (railway division of) Wuppertal. In the following years there were a series of rationalisation measures. Despite the rationalisation, traffic increased steadily in the following years. In recent years, the line has been threatened with closure several times. There were plans to extend the H√∂nne Valley Railway from Neuenrade to Werdohl or build a branch from Sanssouci towards Plettenberg, connecting to the existing Ruhr‚ÄìSieg railway. These plans were abandoned.  Operations = Passengers  Former station building in Balve RB 29458 composed of 2 Alstom Coradia LINT cars in Neuenrade 628 676 near the entrance to Binolen station on 10 May 2011. The H√∂nne Valley Railway is served by Regionalbahn service RB 54 (H√∂nnetal-Bahn). Services run hourly in both directions between Unna and Neuenrade on weekdays with trains crossing in Binolen on the hour. Fewer services run on weekends. Trains run at least every two hours to and from Neuenrade. Services on the H√∂nne Valley Railway are operated by DB Regio NRW, using Alstom Coradia LINT 41 (class 648) diesel railcars, which by supplemented by LINT 27 (class 640) diesel railcars. The LINT 41 railcars can be operated either singly or doubly, as required, while the LINT 27 railcars are usually operated in double traction. In addition trains made up of a LINT 41 and two LINT 27 sets are a common sight for school services. Operations on the H√∂nne Valley Railway, along with the lines from Dortmund to Winterberg, Iserlohn and L√ºdenscheid, were awarded in 2004 as a tender package called the Sauerland Net to DB Regionalbahn Westfalen, which has now been absorbed into DB Regio NRW. Before the use of DMUs of class 624 and 628 from about 1994, the line was operated for many years by locomotive- hauled trains usually formed as a push-pull service of Silberling carriages and class 212 diesel locomotives.  Freight  The freight is limited now to operations to the Rheinkalk lime works in Oberr√∂dinghausen Lendringsen and an industrial siding in Menden.

History The origin of Sewells Group can be traced back to the UK where, in 1970, Ronald Sewell established a financial services consultancy. In the early 1980s, he started a similar business in South Africa. In 1986, WesBank invested in Sewells Group with a view to providing finance and insurance training to motor dealers in South Africa. In 1988, Sewells Group shifted away from offering pure training to offering performance enhancement solution to motor dealerships. A few years later, in the early 1990s, Sewells Group South Africa and Sewells Group UK agreed to operate as independent entities. At about the same time, the group evolved its business model to three primary dealer support services: Profitability and Business Management, Consulting and Training. Dealership Performance Groups where dealers got together to share best practices were also incorporated into the product offering, initially with five dealers in South Africa, then reaching a number of about 500. By the late 1990s, Sewells Group became an authority figure for automotive financial benchmarking in South Africa with over 700 dealer datasets. In 1998, Sewells Group implemented its Dealer Development Model, focusing on network health and human resource development. In 2000, Sewells Group South Africa opened a branch in New Zealand, which from the following year led also to important projects in Australia. In 2002/2003 Sewells Group continued to expand its Australian operation, forming partnerships with several major OEMs. Sewells Group Thailand was established in 2007, with offices in Bangkok then, in 2010, Sewells Group China, with offices in Shanghai and, in 2012, Sewells Group Indonesia, with offices in Jakarta.

Yi's poems apply a light tone to show small yet interesting landscapes from life, give us a feeling of intimacy at first; but after a moment that feeling becomes more complex, and then often changes to perplexity. Expressions such as \\"A blue-bellied fish lies flush with the rope, staring at one place, that place where the clouds roll by, a girl lives together with a boy, and they go to market together // a fly is jumping rope with the usual gestures, therefore at zero-six fifty minutes, they turn at the market corner and at the second house buy a mackerel\\" (selected passage from \\"Mackerel\\"), or lines like \\"This is my body/ a king jar/ I have no arms or legs/ once I am cut/ I will bare my neck/ but the rumored jar/ resembles the story/ and the story's stomach is full\\" (selected passage from \\"King Jar\\") presents scenes that are familiar to us but which, filtered through the poet's voice, become hard, unfamiliar landscapes.Source-attribution \\"Ïù¥Í∑ºÌôî\\" biographical PDF available at LTI Korea Library or online at: Some readers and critics have expressed regret or criticism, mentioning the \\"difficulty\\" and the \\"incommunicability\\" of her poems.

Biography Rumovsky studied in Berlin under Leonhard Euler. He taught mathematics and astronomy at the University of St. Petersburg from 1756 to 1812 and held numerous important positions in the St. Petersburg Academy, including director of the geography department from 1766 to 1786 and director of the observatory and professor of astronomy from 1763 until his death. At some point, he became a vice-president of the Academy of Sciences. He was appointed an honorary foreign member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1763. Rumovsky joined the Russian School Administration Board in 1803 and was responsible for several reforms. As superintendent of the Kazan Department of Education between 1803 and 1812 he played a major role in the founding of Kazan University. Works He authored scientific papers related to the field of astronomy, geodesy, geography, mathematics, and physics. In 1786, he was responsible for publishing the first catalog in Russia with astronomical geographical coordinates for sixty-two sites, later republished in Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch (1790). In 1760, Rumovsky published a textbook on mathematics for students. Later, he was involved in the edition of the Dictionary of the Russian language. He made a number of translations into Russian as well, mostly philosophical works. Observations of Venus In the 18th century, the precise measurements of the distance between the Earth and the Sun were recognized as one of the most urgent tasks of astronomy. It was previously suggested by Edmond Halley that the best available method to measure this distance was to observe the point at which Venus was between the Sun and the Earth (transit of Venus). Two such points occurred in 1761 and 1769, respectively, and the observations, performed everywhere over Europe, lead indeed to a very precise data related to the distance to the Sun. In 1761, the effort was coordinated all over Europe, including Russia. The Russian effort, backed by Mikhail Lomonosov, consisted in a number of expeditions to observe the phenomenon. In particular, Rumovsky headed the expedition to Selenginsk in Siberia. The 1761 results were used for more refined observations performed in 1769. In that year, Rumovsky was coordinating the observations in the Russian Empire, which were held over the whole accessible area. Rumovsky personally conducted observations in Kola, and later collaborated with Euler to produce the most complete picture based on the observations made in all possible locations.

Wushu was already gaining prominence in Singapore in as early as 1967. The country was hailed as Southeast Asia's \\"best wushu nation\\" in 1993. In 2000, the Government in Singapore initiated wushu into its Sports Excellence Scheme. As of 2013, Singapore won two gold medals, three silver medals, and seven bronze medals at the World Wushu Championships, placing it at number 20 in the world. The Singapore Wushu Dragon and Lion Dance Federation, formerly known as the Singapore National Pugilistic Federation, is the official body which oversees and governs the sport in Singapore. Among the notable wushu professionals in the city-state is Vincent Ng, who became the first ‚Äì and till November 2013 the only ‚Äì individual wushu champion from Singapore in 1995. History In 1993, Singapore was ranked the number one wushu nation within Southeast Asia. The same year, May Tan Mui Buay, a taijiquan exponent, snagged the gold medal at the Southeast Asian Games of the year in Singapore, and followed up this feat by finishing third and obtaining the country's first medal at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan. The Singapore Sports Council recognised Tan's achievements by rating her as an elite-class athlete. She also won a place in the Singapore Book of Records for her showing in Hiroshima. The 1995 World Wushu Championships held in the United States saw Ng Cheng Hye (now better known as Vincent Ng), who participated in the broadsword category, earning the country its first gold medal at the event. This feat was unparalleled for more than a decade, until in November 2013 when Ho Lin Ying became the second Singaporean individual wushu world champion. In 1999, he was listed as one of the twentieth-century's fifty best athletes by newspaper The Straits Times. The renowned Wing Chun master Ip Man, also spelt as Ip Man, imparted his knowledge of the sport to disciples Lee Shing and Wong Shun Leung. Joseph Cheng and Nino Bernardo became proteges of Lee and Wong respectively, and they in turn became Singaporean Chua Kah Joo's teachers, making Chua a third- generation Yip Man disciple. Later in his life, Chua set up various wushu academies in the United Kingdom and one in his home country, also coaching a healthy number of students. Similarly, there are a handful of third or fourth- generation proteges of another wushu great, Wong Fei-hung, in Singapore. They include Leong Kwok Khuen and Siew Puay Lee. Governing body and other organisations The official national governing body of wushu in Singapore is the Singapore Wushu Dragon and Lion Dance Federation, interchangeably known as the Singapore National Federation of Wushu. It was established on February 3, 1967 as the Singapore National Pugilistic Federation. There are numerous wushu schools in Singapore. Wufang Singapore is known to have produced multiple SEA games gold medalists like Jowen Lim who was also the 2012 and 2014 world junior champion. There are other Wushu schools like Xuan Sports, RexArts, and Chua Kah Joo's Wing Chun Kuen Training Centre, as well as, Leo Wen Yeow's Martial House, which bills itself as the leading wushu institute in Singapore.

Plot Soul Cartel follows Si-hun Cha, a young Korean boy who is able to see the spirits of the dead. He is taken care of by his older sister, Su-In Cha, and comes from a family of powerful mediums and exorcists. Si-hun Cha himself is lacking in any spiritual abilities whatsoever aside from his ability to see spirits. Despite this, he tries to help his sister catch weaker wayward ghosts. When chasing after one of these ghosts, he runs into a very powerful demon. The demon claims to be the Mephistopheles, or shortly, Mephisto, who wants Si-hun Cha to teach him of the modern human world and bring him books about his exploits. He states that if Si-hun Cha tries to run away, he's done for. Si-hun Cha does have the common sense to consult his sister (without revealing that he's actually caught a powerful demon's attention), but he quickly learns that even his sister would be no match for Mephisto. After Mephisto finishes a copy of Faust he reveals that he came to earth because Faust has been reincarnated. Faust was a human who'd claimed that he would not be corrupted by Mephisto's temptations, so they'd entered a contractual wager, with God acting as the judge. However, according to Mephisto, God had unfairly intervened at the last moment and cost Mephisto his victory.

Faust is branded with his crest, enabling them to communicate and for Michael to know of his whereabouts. Michael is known for having the strongest defense in the underworld, supposedly unpierced since Genesis. This has earned him the title 'The Impregnable Archangel'.

Huygens placed cycloidal-shaped metal \\"cheeks\\" on either side of the pendulum string, to force the pendulum to move in a cycloidal path, to increase accuracy. Horologium Oscillatorium: sive de motu pendulorum ad horologia aptato demonstrationes geometricae (Latin for \\"The Pendulum Clock: or geometrical demonstrations concerning the motion of pendula as applied to clocks\\") is a book published by Christiaan Huygens in 1673; it is his major work on pendulums and horology. This work is regarded as one of the three most important works done on mechanics in the 17th century, the other two being Galileo‚Äôs Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (1638) and Isaac Newton‚Äôs Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687). The book is divided into five parts. The first part of the book contains the descriptions of clock designs. The rest of the book is devoted to the analysis of pendulum motion and a theory of curves. In the second part of the book, Huygens states three hypotheses on the motion of bodies. They are essentially the law of inertia and the law of composition of \\"motion\\". He uses these three rules to re-derive Galileo's original study of falling bodies, based on clearer logical framework. He then studies constrained fall, obtaining the solution to the tautochrone problem as given by a cycloid curve and not a circle as Galileo had conceived. In the third part of the book, he outlines a theory of evolutes and rectification of curves. The fourth part of the book is concerned with the study of the center of oscillation. The derivations of propositions in this part is based on a single assumption: that the center of gravity of heavy objects cannot lift itself, which Huygens used as a virtual work principle. In the process, Huygens obtained solutions to dynamical problems such as the period of an oscillating pendulum as well as a compound pendulum, center of oscillation and its interchangeability with the pivot point, and the concept of moment of inertia. gives a detailed description of Huygen's methods The last part of the book gives propositions regarding bodies in uniform circular motion, without proof, and states the laws of centrifugal force for uniform circular motion. The book is also known for its strangely worded dedication to Louis XIV.. The appearance of the book in 1673 was a political issue, since at that time the Netherlands was at war with France; Huygens was anxious to show his allegiance to his patron, which can be seen in the obsequious dedication to Louis XIV..

Revell took the name Operator, and Steven Hill the name Ne/H/il. In Sydney, they met a couple of younger guys who completed the live setup (Danny Rumour and David Virgin, each who went on to be successful musicians in their own right).\\" In 1984 a compilation album was released called The Industrial Records Story and featured SPK (band)'s 1979 recording \\"Mekano\\" alongside Throbbing Gristle, William S. Burroughs, Cabaret Voltaire (band), Leather Nun and Elisabeth Welch. The early SPK recordings that featured Virgin were also referenced in the landmark publication RE/Search #6/7: Industrial Culture Handbook In 2006, the SPK song Slogun was sampled in the song Hakai (Deathtroy) by Kyono, and DJ Starscream (real name Sidney George Wilson of the band Slipknot (band)) . The song appeared on the official tribute album 'The Songs for Death Note the movieÔΩûthe Last name TributeÔΩû' which was released alongside the film Death Note 2: The Last Name and published by Sony Music Distribution (Japan) Early career - Sekret Sekret The Broken Toys disbanded in 1979 and shortly after that Virgin formed The Ugly Mirrors with Dan Rumour, Des Devlin and Peter McGregor. The Ugly Mirrors quickly became Sekret Sekret with the final line up including Colin Ellis on drums and Peter Mullany on second guitar who came over from Johnny Dole & The Scabs. Sekret Sekret performed and recorded for six years earning 5 number one singles on the Australian independent charts including the \\"noted underground classic New King Jack\\".

In Canada and the US, shipping insurance is offered by postal services, courier companies, and shipping- insurance companies. Not all insurers will insure all goods. For example, postal services will not insure certain economy-class parcels, though third- party insurers often will. It is possible to ship a parcel with insurance but without parcel tracking service. This can be a sensible thing to do. Shipping insurance is normally less expensive than tracking. Also, if a parcel is damaged in transit, tracking may be unhelpful, but shipping insurance may reimburse the sender in full. First-party shipping-insurance services offered by postal services and courier companies may have many more restrictions than third-party shipping-insurance services. First-party insurance services may not pay out on claims unless the item was packed very carefully. Claimants also may need to provide proof of an item's value.See: When practical, self- insurance is normally more economical than paying for insurance; see Insurance#Limited consumer benefits.

He is best known for his sermons against mandatory tithing to the Church of England and against colonial slavery. After early work at Nonconformist chapels in Godalming and Henley-on-Thames, he moved to Brighton where he became \\"one of the most important persons\\" in the 300-year history of the town's Union Chapel. He also helped to found schools and a cemetery in Brighton. Biography=Early life Goulty was born on 21 June 1788 in East Dereham, Norfolk. He was a cousin of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson (1758‚Äì1805). He was educated at Homerton College, a constituent college of the University of Cambridge, where he was taught by John Pye-Smith (1774‚Äì1851). Career Goulty was pastor of Union Chapel, Brighton between 1823 and 1861. Union Chapel, Brighton, post-1823 arrangement as it would have appeared at Goulty's tenure, with the design attributed to \\"H. Wilds, Architect\\" After Cambridge, he ministered in Godalming, Surrey from 1812 to 1815. This Surrey town had a long history of Nonconformist worship: a Presbyterian meeting was licensed in a private house in 1672, and in 1729 a permanent meeting house was built. After its pastor died in 1799, the cause declined and was taken on by the Surrey Congregational Mission and later by Independent Nonconformist students of Homerton College. Goulty was not an ordained pastor at this stage, but his service at the church saw it \\"considerably revived\\" from its declining state. He also travelled to the nearby villages of Elstead and Hascombe to preach. In 1815, he was ordained as pastor at the Independent chapel in Henley-on-Thames, where he served for nine years. From 1823 to 1862, he served as the pastor of Union Chapel in Brighton, East Sussex, succeeding John Styles. The chapel had been enlarged during Styles' 15-year incumbency, and immediately grew in popularity when Goulty took over. Its earlier debts of ¬£1,000 were settled, and in 1825 the chapel was redesigned in Classical style with Greek Revival and Egyptian Revival elements. The exterior was designed on a \\"grand scale\\", as was its interior: below a domed ceiling ran a deep balcony supported on ornate iron columns. The architect has been the subject of much disagreement: Amon Wilds is usually credited, but Charles Busby produced and signed an architectural design in 1825 and the men probably worked together on it. Goulty \\"soon became a prominent man in Brighton\\". He campaigned for Nonconformism and held many theological debates with the Vicar of Brighton Rev. Henry Michell Wagner and his son Rev. Arthur Wagner, curate of St Paul's Church and founder of others such as the Church of the Annunciation. One of their ongoing disagreements was over the mandatory tithing of nonconformists to the Church of England: nonconformists disagreed with the principle of paying tithes to a church they did not belong to. Goulty served as Secretary of the Royal Sussex County Hospital for two years between 1830 and 1832. His particular interest was improving education in the town: he founded, and served 31 years (1835‚Äì1866) as Secretary of the Board of Governors to, the Brighton Union Charity School in Middle Street (now the Middle Street Primary School) in Brighton; and in 1828 together with John Russell, 1st Earl Russell (1792‚Äì1878) he founded and served as honorary secretary of the Royal British School on Eastern Road. In 1847, at the bottom of West Street on the seafront, he founded a school for the children of fishermen and an Independent preaching station called the Bethel Arch, at which he ministered to the fishermen themselves. The 1851 religious census confirmed that the chapel was \\"also used as a Day School\\" and had a capacity of 250 seats and standing room for an additional 50 worshippers. Goulty, who signed the census return, recorded 280 attendees at afternoon and evening services, and wrote that \\"the place is generally full ... [there are] many stragglers at the Door on the Beach\\". In the same census, Goulty recorded the capacity of Union Chapel as 900 seats and standing room for 100 more, and the morning and evening attendance as 574 and 300 respectively. A third Independent chapel associated with Goulty was the Hove Chapel in the neighbouring town of Hove. Founded in 1824 and with a capacity of 100, it was served by \\"local preachers\\" but was registered in Goulty's name. Attendance on census evening was 80. The chapel does not survive and its location is not known, although it may have been associated with a Presbyterian meeting house registered in 1779 \\"in or near Hove Street\\". Goulty was one of the founders of the Extra Mural Cemetery, described as \\"one of the most delightful spots in the whole of Brighton\\". Goulty also one of the four founders of the Extra Mural Cemetery in Brighton. In 1850, in response to a Government health inspector's critical report about sanitary conditions and public health in Brighton‚Äîwhich recommended that burials in churchyards and chapel burial grounds should cease‚Äîthe doctor and political John Cordy Burrows, architect Amon Henry Wilds, Goulty and his son Horatio Nelson Goulty established the Brighton Extra Mural Company, acquired of land near Race Hill, and laid out a private cemetery for Anglican, Roman Catholic and Nonconformist burials. Goulty founded Sudeley Place Congregational Chapel in 1868. Goulty's pastorate at Union Chapel ended in 1861 with his retirement, although in 1868 he founded a Congregational chapel at Sudeley Place in the Kemptown area of Brighton. (This closed in 1918 and was converted into a cinema by John Leopold Denman and later into a residential building.) He died in Brighton on 18 January 1870 and was buried at the Extra Mural Cemetery. His grave is in the unconsecrated southwest section of the cemetery and is marked by an obelisk- style memorial. His son Horatio Nelson Goulty, who predeceased him, was also active in public life in Brighton, principally as an architect but also as a supporter of hospitals and schools. Personal life He married twice. His first marriage was to Clementine Sharp. They had three children: *William Nelson Goulty (31 October 1819‚Äìunknown). *Clementina Sharp Goulty (29 October 1820‚Äìunknown). *Mary Walter Goulty (12 May 1822‚Äìunknown).

He is mostly known to be the founder of Udavum Karangal, a NGO based in Chennai, India Early life and the meeting with Ramakrishnan Pappa Vidyaakar was born in Mangalore but grew up in Kollegal in the state of Karnataka. There when he was aged 13, witnessed an accident and rescued a man from Chennai named Ramakrishnan. The two kept in touch and few years later Pappa went to visit him in Chennai. Here he stayed under the shelter of the man, who raised in him his natural inclination towards seeking the good of others. Pappa trained in Psychiatric social work and psychological counseling at the Madras School of Social Work, and after joined Chennai‚Äôs leading organizations delivering care for leprosy and mental health. He also had the privilege of serving with Mother Teresa. Before he turned 30 he started working in a voluntary counseling and guidance center in the area of NSK Nagar. The foundation of Udavum Karangal At the beginning of the 1980s Vidyaakar moved to NSK Nagar, a poor area in Chennai, to start a volunteering collaboration with a local charity. By living among the people he was trying to help he soon raised popularity in the area. Many people started to address him for help and assistance. In 1983 a rickshaw puller came to him with an abandoned child found in a cinema hall after a show. Vidyaakar tried in vain to find a solution for him, but nobody was able to help; determined to take care of the poor victim, he fostered him. Following this example, he used his own house to shelter more children and few days later registered Udavum Karangal (Helping Hands, in Tamil language). Soon many people started spontaneously to support his project, allowing him to hire other social workers and expand the area of interest of the charity to elders, mentally challenged and education. In the 1990s a new headquarters was built in the outskirts town of Thiruverkadu and in 1997 a public, free of charge school by Udavum Karangal started operating in the same area. Recently a new branch has started in Coimbatore and Udavum Karangal is now a NGO fostering over 2,000 between students, elders and mentally challenged and giving work to over 120 people. Thanks to the life-changing impact they had in the area and the relief work produced following the 2004 tsunami event which struck Chennai, both Pappa Vidyaakar and Udavum Karangal received in the last decades several international and Indian awards Awards and accolades 1\\\\.

It was created on 29 September 1887 through the merger of the track and field clubs Hohenfelder Sportclub and Wandsbek-Marienthaler Sportclub, which both were founded in 1884. Germania was six times winner of the association football Championship of Hamburg and in 1900 a founding member of the German football association. Germania merged on 2 June 1919 with Hamburger SV von 1888, Northern German champions of that year, to form today's Hamburger SV, six times German champions and European Cup of Champions' winner of 1983. Hamburger SV carries the foundation date of Germania as its foundation date and uses the colours of Germania in its badge. , a player of Germania, emigrated in the late 19th century to Brazil where he was in 1899 instrumental in founding two of the four oldest football clubs of the country, SC Internacional (SP) which became in 1938 part of S√£o Paulo FC, three times world cup winner, and SC Germ√°nia of S√£o Paolo, which today as EC Pinheiros is considered as one of the biggest general sports clubs of the southern hemisphere. Internacional and Germ√°nia won a total of four State Championships of S√£o Paulo  History  SC Germania ca. 1904 In the beginning the newly formed SC Germania remained focused on track and field and reportedly achieved some notoriety. In 1891, after a number of expatriate Englishmen joined the club, Germania incorporated the increasingly fashionable sport of association football in its activities. Germania was soon in a position to field two teams. The first ground in that era was a meadow, rented from a farmer in Wandsbek, just out of town. An outbreak of cholera in Hamburg in 1892, occasioning about 8,000 fatalities, led to a temporary shutdown of activities. On 20 Oktober 1894 the Hamburg-Altonaer Fu√üball-Bund, the \\"Football Association of Hamburg and Altona\\" - Altona was Prussian city, immediately to the west of Hamburg, that like Wandsbek should be merged with Hamburg in 1937 - was founded and as the third German football association outside the imperial capital Berlin after the short-lived south-west German S√ºd- Westdeutsche Fu√üball-Union. The team of SC Germania, dominated by foreigners, mostly Britons, secured itself in 1896 and 1897 the first two championships of the association - undefeated on both occasions. In that period the Heiligengeistfeld and the Exerzierweide in Altona, the latter was also venue of the first national German championship final in 1903, found use as homegrounds. Exerzierweide SC Germania, like Hamburger FC 1888 were amongst the 86 clubs who founded on 28 January 1900 the national German football association Deutscher Fussball-Bund. Both, like all clubs, from the Hamburg- Altona association and Bremen, were represented at the assembly in Leipzig by Walter Sommermeier. Three more championship titles followed in 1901, 1902 and 1904. The championship of 1904 led to a participation in the play-offs for the second national championships. In the first round Germania defeated Hannover 96 11-1, however, in the second round, the semi-final, Germania lost at home 1-3 to TuFC Britannia Berlin. In 1903 the Rennbahn M√ºhlenkamp, a harness racing course, became Germania's new home, the first enclosed football venue in town. 1907 Forsthof in Wandsbek had to replace it, as the racecourse was to be built up. The northern German associations joined to form the Northern German Football Association, the Norddeutscher Fu√üball-Verband in 1905. In that period many players left Germania, which forthwith was in decline and eventually was relegated in 1912. After the outbreak of World War I Germania, like all other clubs, had a shortage of players and in order to be able to field teams entered into temporary associations with SV Uhlenhorst-Hertha and SC Concordia. SC Germ√¢nia of S√£o Paulo with Hans Nobiling wearing a tie. The kits are identical with Germania Hamburg. After the end of the war the club could not revive its fortunes and merged on 2 June 1919 with Hamburger SV von 1888, Northern German champions of that year, to form today's Hamburger SV, seven times German champions and European Cup of Champions' winner of 1982. Hamburger SV carries 1887 as its official year of foundation. The club colours were the Hanseatic red and white in honour of the City of Hamburg, with the blue and black of the oldest of the founding clubs, Germania, being used on the team badge. It is through Germania that HSV can lay a claim to being the German football club tracing back the furthest.  Influence in Brazil  Also in Brazil Germania, albeit indirectly, had an impact. Hans Nobiling, a former player, emigrated 1897 to S√£o Paulo in Brazil. Soon he founded a football team, which evolved by 19 August 1899 into SC Internacional of S√£o Paulo, the third oldest football club of Brazil. Internacional won State Championships of S√£o Paulo in 1907 and 1928. In 1938, after a merger with Antarctica FC became part of S√£o Paulo FC, which went on to become one of the most successful football clubs in the world. Also in 1899, on 7 September, Nobiling founded SC Germ√¢nia of S√£o Paulo, which was part of the first official football match in the history of Brasil and went on to win State Championships in 1906 and 1915. Later G√™rmania was renamed to EC Pinheiros, often considered the largest sports club of the southern hemisphere, and it is the club whose members have won the most Olympic medals for Brazil. Hermann Friese was another athlete from Germania. He won a national track and field title and emigrated to Brazil a few years after Nobiling. There he joined Germ√¢nia and was considered the best footballer in his days and one of the leading referees of his era. He also represented Brazil in an international track and field meeting.

It opened in a series of sections between 1885 and 1911. 3 short branches junctioned from it, parts of which were initially built by the local government. It closed in sections between 1959 and circa 2007. History Mackay, about 1000 km north of Brisbane, is situated at the entrance of a fertile river valley, and was quickly developed for agriculture, especially sugar cane. Sugar mills had been constructed with private cane tramways, meaning each mill had a local monopoly. The Mackay railway was built to allow growers to ship their sugar cane to alternative buyers, ending the mill monopolies.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong Publications 1990  Early lines  The first section opened from Mackay to Eton, the only other town in the region at the time, together with a branch from Newbury Junction to Mirani, 36 km in total, in 1885. The \\"branch line\\" from Mirani was extended 16 km west to Pinnacle between 1897-1902, and traffic grew to the point where it became regarded as the main line, and Eton as the branch line. The Queensland Government built two sugar mills as part of the development, and in due course most mills became cooperatively owned. = River Estate of John Spiller = John Spiller imported a new steam locomotive as complete as possible from John Fowler & Co. in England by for this estate (No 4150 of 1881).Christopher Hart: The Fowler was 4150 of 1881. It was christened on Thursday 4 August 1881 Emma Ruth after the wife of John Spiller. It was capable of drawing 80 tons on a level or 16 tons up a gradient of 1 in 40 (25 ‚Ä∞) and at a speed of 15 miles per hour. The new locomotive was reported to have been a cylinder, with gauge, together with pressure gauge spring balance, whistle and outfit complete. 26 cane wagons were used, out of these 16 came out with the locomotive, and they could each carry about 23 cwt (1.2 t) of cane.The River Estate In: Mackay Mercury and South Kennedy Advertiser. 6 Aug 1881. Page 2. The estate had a gauge line of rails some three and a-half miles in length. The line was substantially laid on sleepers, and was similar in construction to ordinary lines. The trestle over Fursden Creek was made of piles, which were of up to high. In 1881 Spiller has also procured from England two miles of permanent steel rails and one mile of portable rail, which will be added to the present line of 3¬Ω miles, now running from one end of the estate to the other. The River Estate comprised 2625 acres. In 1881 there were 1247 acres under cultivation, producing 1200 tons of sugar per season or 10 tons of first-class sugar per day. = Ashburton Estate and Pioneer Estate of John Spiller = A new mill was erected on Ashburton Estate of John Spiller, adjoining the Pioneer Estate. The two mills were connected by a railway similar to the one on the River Estate, of which nearly 4 miles have been completed in 1881. The Pioneer Estate consisted of 4886 acres, and was estimated to produce 1100 tons of sugar per season, so that Mr Spiller would produce one-fifth of the whole sugar of the district. Local government involvement Keen to facilitate further development, the Pioneer Shire Council funded the construction of a 9 km extension to Finch Hatton, opened in 1904. It also funded a 12 km branch from Benholme to Kirkup, opened 1903. Walter Paget, the MLA for Mackay, became the Minister for Railways in 1908, and the Council lines were purchased by the Queensland Railways Department to enable further extensions. The 10 km Finch Hatton - Netherdale extension (to the base of the Eungella Range) opened in 1911, as did the 2 km Kirkup - Kungurri extension. Systems connected In 1921 Mackay was linked to the North Coast line to Rockhampton and Brisbane, with the northern connection to Townsville opening in 1923. A third branch, 10 km from Gargett to Owens Creek, opened in 1922. As with the other lines, the main traffic was sugar cane. As cane is harvested for 6 months each year, the Mackay railway network had 2 distinct seasons, one much quieter than the other. System disruption In March 1956 the Mirani bridge was destroyed by flood waters, and a locomotive was moved west of there to operate the isolated section until a temporary bridge was opened three months later. A permanent replacement bridge was opened in December 1959. Closures and conversions The first section to close was the 4 km from Eton to Victoria, site of a sugar Mill, in 1959. In 1967 the Kungurri and Owens Creek branches were sold to local sugar mills and converted to 610mm (2') gauge cane tramways. The section from Victoria - Newbury Junction closed in 1971. The Netherdale - Finch Hatton section closed in 1977, and the 33 km Finch Hatton - Marian section in 1990, also to be converted to sugar cane tramways. The 23 km Paget Junction - Marian section closed December 2009.

It is a Grade II* listed red brick Gothic Revival church which was built between 1878 and 1887 by the English architect John Loughborough Pearson (1817‚Äì97). The church is dedicated to the Christian saint, John the Evangelist. History Exterior Cloisters In the 1870s, the London conurbation was steadily expanding into the rural county of Surrey and new suburban houses were built in the area of modern Upper Norwood, with dwellings ranging from houses for the more affluent businessmen to modest workers' housing being built over the former ancient Surrey woodland. A large, temporary iron church was built to provide a place of worship for the new area, which in October 1875 was moved to the site of the present church in Auckland Road. The Priests-in-charge were Rev Philip Kingswood and Rev Thomas Helmore. Early in 1876 it became a parish church and the first vicar was Rev William Fairbairn La Trobe-Bateman, who began an initiative to clear the church's debts and raise funds to build a permanent church to replace the iron structure. The fundraising was supplemented by a memorial fund set up in memory of the vicar's wife, who died unexpectedly in 1878 from tuberculosis. The parish engaged the services of John Loughborough Pearson, an eminent ecclesiastical architect who had already designed a number of churches in the Gothic Revival style which was at the height of fashion in Victorian Britain, including his most recent project in North London, the large-scale St Augustine's, Kilburn which he had completed in 1877. Pearson was to draw up plans for a building to seat 1000 people at Upper Norwood. The Foundation stone was laid on 6 May 1878 in a field, but building work could not commence until enough funds had been raised. The Church Commissioners contributed an additional ¬£1000 on the condition that the building plans included a tower. In 1881, after a total of ¬£7,156 pounds, 17 shillings and six-and-a-half pence had been raised, construction began; after six years of construction the building was consecrated on 30 April 1887. Church Commissioners' conditions were never met due to financial difficulty and the church to this day does not have a spire. Architecture The High altar and stone reredos Pearson's design is a plain red brick exterior with two turrets at the west end which Pevsner describes as \\"typically Pearsonian\\". The -long church is cruciform, and the south transept was originally designed to carry a -high tower, which was never completed. Above the nave is a tall clerestory. The interior of the building is stock brick with arcades and brick rib vaulting. Most striking is the large stone rood screen across the chancel, which features five gothic arches topped by four statues, and the large carved stone reredos. The church was damaged by the bombing during the Second World War and restoration work was carried out by the conservation architects Caroe & Partners between 1946 and 1951. The stained glass designed by Clayton & Bell was lost during the bombing, but a large rose window has survived which is the work of Ninian Comper, a renowned late Gothic Revival designer who lived in Upper Norwood on Beulah Hill. The building is suffering from the effects of subsidence which has required the reconstruction of the rood screen and has threatened the structure of the south aisle. Phase one works to secure the structure have now been completed with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund and other donors. Work is now underway to restore the interior features damaged by the subsidence. Music The 1882 Lewis Organ Since the incumbency of Thomas Helmore, the Church of St John the Evangelist has maintained a strong tradition of music in Christian worship. The organ was originally built by Thomas Christopher Lewis in 1882 during the construction of the church, when only the chancel had been completed. The instrument was of an unusual design; while the organ itself was situated in the north transept, the console was placed on the other side of the church in the south choir aisle. This led to technical problems and the organ underwent several rebuilds in 1912, 1947 (following wartime bomb damage) and most recently in a restoration project undertaken in 1997-98 by Harrison & Harrison. The church interior is noted for the quality of its acoustics and it is frequently used by classical music artists for CD recordings, including His Majesty's Sagbutts & Cornetts, Florilegium and I Fagiolini. Also the church was the location of two music videos of Libera.Salva Me by Libera; via YouTube (2008).

It is the only educational and professional academy exclusively dedicated to retail banking anywhere in the world. The RBA is the only international, educational and professional body that's exclusively dedicated to retail banking. The Certified Retail Banker (CRB) programme makes it possible for retail bankers to embark on a structured certification programme that covers every aspect of the industry end to end. . The Retail Banking Academy has its headquarters in London, UK.  History  The organisation was founded in London, UK in 2011 as the International Academy of Retail Banking with the objective of educating retail bankers worldwide to a high professional standard. It believes that a separated, independent retail banking sector should be led by professionally qualified retail bankers, bound by an ethical code similar to those already in place for accountants and lawyers. This ethical code is intended to oblige retail bankers to act in the customer's best interests. Bankers who persistently fail to comply would be barred from membership of the profession. To that end, the RBA believes that the foundation stone for a retail banking profession must be the complete separation of retail banking from both investment banking and large-scale corporate banking. In 2012 the UK Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards accepted evidence from a number of participants operating in the banking sector. The Retail Banking Academy was one of the participants, and its submission was included in selected submissions in its final published report, Changing Banking for Good, which outlines the radical reform required to improve standards across the banking industry. In October 2014, the organisation changed its name from the International Academy of Retail Banking to the Retail Banking Academy.  Certifications  The RBA offers a large variety of programmes such as:  Certified Retail Banker (CRB)  The Certified Retail Banker programme was designed by senior retail bankers and academics from around the world. Since 2011 the qualification strategy has evolved to grow with sector demands, for example, it was made available in the French language in 2012. To become a Certified Retail Banker, and to be able to use the designation CRB, you need to join RBA Membership and successfully pass examinations at three separate levels. *Retail Banking I (RB I) Retail Banking I was designed to introduce candidates to the theoretical and practical core competencies that are required for success within a retail banking organisation. It is ideal for retail bankers looking to broaden their scope and banking knowledge. *Banking II (RB II) Retail Banking II focuses on the issues that are encountered when leading people and retail banking departments. The course is ideal for retail bankers looking to fast track their career and understand the key divisions/functions of a retail bank. *Retail Banking III (RB III) Retail Banking III focuses on developing and enhancing the capabilities required to run retail banking strategic business units. The course is ideal for retail bankers looking to understand how different functions are brought together in one retail bank, and challenges associated to leadership.  Accelerated Programmes  The Accelerated Programmes have been created for experienced retail bankers with over 10 or 15 years experience, which means that eligible candidates will be exempt from Retail Banking I exams (Accelerated 10) or exempt from Retail Banking I & II (Accelerated 15) due to their extensive number of years working full-time in the sector. and renowned industry speakers are invited to lead thought- leadership discussion groups.  Certified Cards and Payments Professional  The Certified Cards and Payments Programme was launched in 2013 as a result of the introduction of an increasing number of new card payment methods to the market. CCPP certification is gained in the same way as the CRB certification above, with three levels of study and exams to pass. At that point in time, the programme was delivered as an in-bank classroom programme only. On the back of the success of the in-bank sessions, there are now first and second levels of the programme available for individual candidates to enrol on our site: *Cards and Payments I Cards and Payments I is a specialised programme that provides a broad overview and coverage of the entire lifecycle of all types of payments cards, including credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, corporate cards and mobile payments. The course is ideal for cards and payments professionals looking to broaden their scope and knowledge in the cards industry. As a functional specialist you will gain an excellent understanding of other areas along with a strategic grasp of the industry which embraces international trends and best practices. *Cards and Payments II Cards and Payments II is a specialised programme focussed on the key areas of the Cards and Payments industry. The course is ideal for cards and payments professionals looking to broaden their scope and knowledge in the cards industry.  Executive Management Programme  For senior retail bankers with over 15 years of experience, the RBA also offers the Executive Management Programme that is hosted twice per year in London or Johannesburg. It's a three or five-day immersive programme for senior delegates, where a group our distinguished faculty deliver lectures, facilitate practical workshops  Types of learning = ELearning  The Retail Banking Academy offers access to the CRB qualification via eLearning with a series of interactive modules and analytics solutions that continuously adapts to the candidates‚Äô performance, facilitates critical reasoning and provides continuous coaching and feedback to help you become proficient at the core curriculum and enhance your retail banking training.  Classroom (for in-bank programmes)  Programmes can also be tailored specifically to meet the needs of individual bank requirements, strategy and objectives with the in-bank programmes. Not only programmes can be bespoke, but can also be delivered by faculty staff in a classroom setting or via the e-learning platform, or in fact a combination of both types of learning.  Governance  The Retail Banking Academy is governed by a board of directors, an academic standards board, an awarding organisation and its governing body. The board of directors is chaired by Michael Lafferty (chairman of Lafferty Group and a former Financial Times journalist).

The long line is operated by Akropolis Teleferik Inc. Bergama is the site of ancient Pergamon, a major tourist attraction place. A project was worked out in 2005 to connect the site Asclepium down in the valley with the far Acropolis on the top of a steep hill north of Bergama by an aerial lift line. After rejection of this project by the responsible official body due to concerns over the conservation of the historical place, an alternate project for a much shorter route between Acropolis and its foothill north of the town found acceptance in 2006. Access to Acropolis on the narrow road by bus takes considerable time for the tourists, and any widening of the existing road is not permitted due to the archaeological status of the site. The gondola lift was constructed by the Italian company Leitner Ropeways of Leitner Group costing 6 million, and financed by the local Turkish company Akropolis Teleferik Inc. on the build‚Äìoperate‚Äìtransfer base for a lease term of 49 years.

Farrow was born in Carlton, the second son of Robert William Johnston and Mary Ann Perry. He was attracted to the military during his schooldays, and so enlisted to fight in World War 1 as soon as he turned 18. Trained as a signaller, he spent the last two years of the conflict in the Middle East ‚Äì where, like many of the Australian troops, he took every opportunity he could to kick a football. He returned to Australia in April 1919. Farrow commenced his VFL career at Melbourne late in the 1919 season. He proved himself a sure ball-handler at ground level and had an uncanny ability to read the ball as it spilt from packs. His disposal was accurate, and he took a good mark for his size. Something of a sensation from his first appearance, he played in the middle in most of his 33 games and represented Victoria in both 1920 and 1921. In 1922, Carlton convinced Farrow to move to Princes Park. His twelve games for the season produced 12 goals and included his only finals appearance, with Essendon scoring in the last few minutes to beat Carlton by 5 points. Farrow‚Äôs career lasted just two more games after that high point, ending with a sickening collision with a Richmond opponent at Punt Road Oval in May 1923. Farrow and his adversary clashed heads in a ground level contest, and both were taken from the field unconscious. At first it was feared that Farrow had sustained a fractured skull, but it was later confirmed as severe concussion. Almost twenty years later, when World War II broke out, Farrow volunteered a second time to serve his country ‚Äì in the blue serge uniform of the RAAF. He was restricted by his age to duty within Australia, but rose to the rank of Corporal before his final discharge in January 1948. He died seven years later at the age of 61.

Lee Ki-ho debuted when his short story ‚ÄúBirney‚Äù won the monthly Modern Literature New Writer's Contest in 1999. He is currently a professor in the department of creative writing at Gwangju University. Work Lee Ki-ho is considered to be one of South Korea's most unusual writers to the extent that one critic has declared that the conventions of a story cannot be applied to Lee's work. Lee debuted in 1999 with ‚ÄúBunny,‚Äù a short story that seems to reflect the rhythms of rap, as well as pansori, a traditional Korean ballad. The stories following his debut are just as diversely experimental, for one story borrows the question and answer method of an interrogation, while another adopts the writing style and typeset of the Bible, and still another uses language that is suggestive of the kind used on a TV cooking show.Source-attribution\\"Lee Kee-ho\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Lee is inventive not only with form, but also with his characters, who are a humble and sordid lot: a small-time pimp who dropped out of high school after assaulting a teacher; a third-rate actor addicted to glue; a gang member who had grown up in an orphanage; and a character who ekes out a living by working at a local convenience store. Lee's stories not only feature these back alley types, but also those with abnormal traits, such as a youth who has eyes in the back of his head and a man who falls in love with a flagstaff from where the national flag hangs.Source- attribution\\"Lee Kee-ho\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# These misfits, who seem to have jumped straight out of tabloids or entertainment programs, are distinctive and, at the same time, very real individuals who can be easily found on the fringes of society. A character named Lee Sibong, who appears regularly in Lee's work, is portrayed a little differently in each story but is, for the most part, a pathetic and na√Øve flunky with no luck whatsoever, someone who seems to be the epitome of human failure. By ridiculing the lives of these vulgar yet common characters, Lee makes his readers laugh. However, the target of our laughter quickly becomes our own society that is steeped in arrogance and artifice, for the characters‚Äô vulgarity, naivet√©, and tragic failures symbolize the failings of our society.Source-attribution\\"Lee Kee-ho\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Lee has had one novel translated into English, At Least We Can Apologize in 2013. At Least We Can Apologize has been described as: :post-modern, and a bit absurd, but also a fun read on at least two levels. First is the surface level, as a farcical course of events. Second is as a metaphor for the ability of power, particularly when it can instill guilt in the powerless, to control without having to use formal control, and how that, once unbalanced, can spill completely out of control.

Sheehan Gallery/Whitman College, 2010, Tarzin Ament, Deloris; Iridescent Light: The Emergence of Northwest Art; University of Washington Press, 2002 Life and career Meitzler was born Herbert Neil Claussen in Pueblo, Colorado, on September 14, 1930. Seeking work in the midst of the Great Depression, his family moved to Oregon, where Neil began using his stepfather's last name, after his father died and his mother remarried. When he was twelve his family moved again, to Orting, Washington (near Tacoma), and started a successful greenhouse flower-growing business. His mother and stepfather were devout Seventh-day Adventists. Meitzler had been interested in art from early youth, and wanted to be either a professional artist or a minister. After leaving high school he moved to Seattle, and eventually began working as a draftsman at Boeing. Railroad Tunnel on South Fork of the Stillaguamish River, Neil Meitzler, 1959. While at Boeing Meitzler won first prize in an employee art show, which led to exhibitions at small galleries, some sales, and critical notice. While working as a set painter he met Kenneth Callahan, who became his mentor and teacher; he also befriended Morris Graves, Mark Tobey, and other artists of the 'Northwest School'. Meitzler's early work was firmly rooted in traditional landscape painting, eventually showing the influence of mid-century Modern art, but it wasn't until his introduction to the \\"Northwest mystics\\" and Asian art that his work reached full flower. His landscapes, often featuring rocks and waterfalls, took on a soft, otherworldly glow, while blurring the line between representational and abstract art. Beginning in 1957, Meitzler worked as an exhibition designer at the Seattle Art Museum.Neil Meitzler obituary, The Seattle Times, Mar. 1st, 2009 His work was at its most popular in the Northwest from the late 1950s through the mid-70s, in which period he received several awards, appeared in two solo shows at the Zo√´ Dusanne Gallery and one at SAM, was included in several regional and national group exhibitions, and generally enjoyed strong sales at galleries in the Northwest. In 1977 he left the Northwest to work for the Seventh-day Adventist church's publishing arm on the East Coast; he continued painting, did commercial work, and taught art classes, but was mainly focused on family and religion in this period. Throughout his life Meitzler was torn by conflict between his homosexuality and his religious faith. A short marriage in the early 1950s produced a son, but ended acrimoniously. A happier marriage, to Marcia Dawson, who had two young daughters, lasted from 1972 to 1987.Ask Art: Neil Meitzler (1930-2009) (website) http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/bulletin.aspx?searchtype=DISCUSS&artist;=104163 In his late fifties, divorced and with children grown, he again became interested in fine art, his later work at times reflecting a growing acceptance of both his religious and sexual orientation. In 1989 Meitzler returned to Washington, settling in Walla Walla, where he worked for a publishing company and lived with Ikune Sawada, a painter and master landscaper. The two built a comfortably eccentric home/studio with an elaborate Japanese garden in back, and spent much time in Japan. Meitzler continued to paint, exploring new stylistic directions and occasionally exhibiting. He died on Feb. 21st, 2009, after a struggle with pancreatic cancer. A major, in-depth retrospective of Meitzler's career was presented at Whitman College's Sheehan Gallery, in Walla Walla, in 2010.\\"Neil Meitzler‚Äôs Spectra, Stream, Strata in Sheehan Gallery\\"; The Pioneer (Walla Walla, WA newspaper), Sept.30/2010 Legacy Meitzler received many awards throughout his life, including a National Council of the Arts Artists Grant in 1957. His work is found in significant private, corporate, and museum collections across the United States, including the Seattle Art Museum, the Henry Art Gallery, the Memphis Academy of Art, the Washington County Museum of Art in Maryland, Museum of Northwest Art in Laconner WA, Whatcom Museum, Bellingham, the Jundt Art Museum at Gonzaga University, and in the collection of the Imperial Family of Japan.

It was made available on BBC iPlayer and YouTube on 14 November 2013, as part of the BBC One lead-up to the show's 50th anniversary special. It was written by Steven Moffat and starred Paul McGann as the Doctor. The episode is set during the Time War and shows the previously unseen last moments of the Eighth Doctor (McGann) and his artificially controlled regeneration into the War Doctor (John Hurt). It is McGann's second onscreen appearance as the Doctor, following his debut in the 1996 TV movie. Synopsis During the Time War, the Eighth Doctor attempts to rescue a pilot, Cass, whose spacecraft is crashing into the planet Karn. When Cass realises that the Doctor is a Time Lord, she refuses his aid, ignoring his claims that he has never taken part in the devastating Time War. The Doctor refuses to abandon Cass, and both are killed when the ship crashes. On the planet, the Doctor is taken in by the Sisterhood of Karn, guardians of the Flame and Elixir of Eternal Life, who revive him temporarily; Cass, however, is beyond their help. The Sisterhood offer the Doctor a selection of potions which, if consumed before he expires, will not only trigger his regeneration into a new form, but allow him to choose which characteristics his next incarnation will have. They convince the Doctor that he must take action to end the Time War, which \\"threatens all reality\\". The Doctor refuses to help, but after seeing Cass's dead body, agrees there is not much need for a doctor any more, salutes the memory of his past companions, and asks for a potion that will turn him into \\"a warrior\\". He regenerates into a new incarnation, known as the War Doctor, who wears Cass's bandolier. Continuity Before regenerating, the Doctor mentions Charley Pollard, C'rizz, Lucie Miller, Tamsin Drew, and Molly O'Sullivan, his companions in audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions. This marks the first time that original characters from the Big Finish audio series have been mentioned in the television show. Karn and the Sisterhood also appeared in Eighth Doctor stories, but debuted in the television show in The Brain of Morbius, a 1976 Fourth Doctor story. The name of the priestess in this story, Ohila, is similar to Ohica, the name of the High Priestess of the Sisterhood in The Brain of Morbius, although no direct connection between the two characters is established. Production The Eighth Doctor's costume in this episode, on display at the Doctor Who Experience. The idea for \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" came following the creation of the previously unknown incarnation of the Doctor played by John Hurt in \\"The Name of the Doctor\\". Steven Moffat decided that he wanted to see how this Doctor came into being, with the best story idea being a direct regeneration from the Eighth Doctor, which would have the added benefit of showing the end of the Eighth Doctor, which Moffat had always wanted to see. Having contacted Paul McGann, who indicated his willingness to participate, Moffat then constructed the mini-episode to serve as an additional surprise for the fans, as well as serving as an introductory piece to \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" was recorded at Roath Lock on 7‚Äì8 May 2013; the first day of filming consisted of all scenes taking place on the planet Karn, while the second day consisted of scenes in Cass' spaceship. Rather than a return to the costume from the TV movie or using the new image that Big Finish had introduced, Moffat decided on a variation of the TV movie outfit designed by Howard Burden. The new outfit referenced the previous one, retaining the long green coat and grey waistcoat, but making it appear more of an \\"adventurer's\\" rather than \\"gentleman's\\" outfit. At the same time, pictures of McGann in costume were taken on the Eleventh Doctor's TARDIS console room set. An archival photograph of John Hurt as Rodion Raskolnikov in the 1976 BBC adaptation of Crime and Punishment was used to represent the reflection of the young War Doctor. Broadcast and reception The broadcast of the episode came as a surprise to viewers, as it was announced via Twitter less than an hour before its release. The appearance of Paul McGann was similarly unexpected. The mini-episode was intended to be released during the actual week of the anniversary, but was brought forward owing to the fact that its existence, as well as the surprise presence of McGann as the Eighth Doctor, were about to be leaked. The Atlantic listed \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" as one of the best television episodes of 2013. The episode was made available on the BBC's YouTube site, its iPlayer service, and on the BBC Red Button service. \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" received over 2.5 million views within the week of its release. McGann's reprise performance was met with acclaim; fans of the episode campaigned for the BBC to grant the Eighth Doctor his own spin-off series, with one petition on Change.org accumulating over 15,000 signatures. BBC America aired the episode on 25 December 2013 as part of an expanded broadcast of \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" including deleted scenes excluded from the normal US broadcast honouring the 50th Anniversary as well as Matt Smith's final episode which aired immediately following it and his farewell special. Fan reaction After the release of the mini-episode, fans of Doctor Who demanded a Doctor Who spin-off featuring McGann, multi-Doctor stories between McGann and Peter Capaldi's Twelfth Doctor, or further specials or mini- episodes with McGann. A petition for a spin-off passed the goal of 15,000 signatures in November 2013, but extended the goal to 25,000 and has since then surpassed 20,000 signatures.http://touch.denofgeek.us/denofgeekus/#!/entry/doctor-who-petition- for-paul-mcgann-spinoff-passes-15000-signatures,5290c404025312186c8f148b/1 Paul McGann indicated his willingness to return and noted that he had signed the petition himself. Emma Campbell-Jones, who played Cass, indicated a willingness to return also, noting that it isn't explicit that Cass died and that the character \\"needs to see that he is the good Doctor.\\" However, Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat indicated that a McGann spin-off would not happen as, with the exception of the anniversary, there should be \\"one Doctor at a time.\\" He also indicated that McGann's appearance was less important than the fact that his appearance was a surprise and stated that further mini-episodes with high production values would be produced and would be surprising for viewers and even the BBC. Home media The episode was included as an extra on the Blu-ray and DVD release of '\\"The Day of the Doctor'\\". The special was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray on 8 September 2014 as part of a \\"50th Anniversary Collectors Edition\\" boxset alongside \\"The Name of the Doctor\\", An Adventure in Space and Time, \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" and The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot. The episode was also released again as an extra feature on the Blu Ray release of Doctor Who: The Movie on 19 September 2016. In print The storyline from this episode was included in the novelisation of \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". It was stated in the novelisation (which, like this episode, was written by Steven Moffat) that the potion the Doctor drank to become a warrior was a fake, intended by Ohila to convince him to fight in the Time War.

She recorded in London for producers that included Winston Curtis and Les Cliff and is perhaps best known for her interpretation of Marlena Shaw's version of the much covered \\"Go Away Little Boy\\" and for her cover of \\"Angel of the Morning\\". Other successes included her duet with Les Cliff \\"Together in Love\\", and with Ray Mondo on \\"Easy Lovin'\\".Winston Curtis,A Rose For A Rose CD, Sleeve notes, Jet Star Distribution, 2003 Biography Samantha Rose was born in Jamaica in 1954 and began singing in public at the age of 12. In 1969, she came to live in London and made her recording debut for reggae music producer Les Cliff at the age of 21 in 1975. The song \\"Your Tender Lips\\", written by Les Cliff and Samantha Rose and released on Dennis Harris' D.I.P label, was an early example of lovers rock, a romantic ballad form of reggae that found favour amongst West Indians living in the United Kingdom.Colin Larkin, \\"The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae\\", Virgin Books, 1998, In 1976‚Äì77, she released a number of singles for Les Cliff's own label Saturn. This included \\"Undying Love\\", \\"How I Need You\\", \\"My Only Chance\\" and \\"Could This Be Love\\". They sold well enough for her in 1978 to begin recording the LP Samantha Rose In Person, produced by Winston Curtis and released in 1979 on the Empire label. It included new versions of \\"Angel of the Morning\\" and \\"Your Tender Lips\\" with a number of original songs and covers of popular soul songs that included \\"Kiss You All Over\\". She consolidated the success with a further album, Tell Me Why that consisted of similar material produced as previously by Curtis. Her version of \\"Stay With Me Baby\\", originally a hit for Lorraine Ellison, proved very popular. A further album produced by Count Shelley and Fitzroy Sterling appeared in 1982. It included her version of \\"Go Away Little Boy\\" that was also issued as a 12\\" single. Subsequently, Rose failed to find a substantial audience beyond the lovers rock scene and by the late 1980s she had relocated to Miami to work with the burgeoning West Indian music scene. She appeared at the Reggae Sunburst festivals in Miami in 1989 and 1991. Since then, she has recorded sporadically in Jamaica and England. In 2003, Winston Curtis released a collection of her most popular songs from the late '70s and early '80s reviving interest in her career.

Background On 26 July 2007, UK tabloid newspaper The Daily Star reported that it had discovered an online text story about British pop group Girls Aloud that it described as \\"a chilling story detailing each singer's gory death in scenes that could be straight out of a horror movie\\", characterizing its author as \\"a vile internet psycho\\" and \\"a cyber-sicko\\". The paper reported the content at \\"Kristen Archives\\" (a subsite of the ASSTR archive), to the Internet Watch Foundation, and that the IWF had traced the site to the US. It also claimed that Interpol had been notified to help track down the site's operators and the writer of the story. An IWF spokesperson was reported as saying that since the site was hosted in the US, it fell outside the organization's remit, but that they were aware of the site. The site hosted \\"child abuse fantasy stories\\", which details were fed to the British police. Decision to prosecute The story, entitled \\"Girls (Scream) Aloud\\", had been posted from within the jurisdiction of the UK on a website hosted in the US. Submitted under a pseudonym, the posting included a traceable email address. Officers from Scotland Yard‚Äôs Obscene Publications Unit decided to seek prosecution after consulting the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), and on 25 September 2008 it was announced that this would occur for the online publication of material that the police and the CPS believed was obscene. It was the first such prosecution for written material since the landmark obscenity cases of the '60s and '70s. Any ruling would affect intended regulation of the internet in the jurisdiction. Trial Walker appeared in court on 22 October 2008 to face charges of \\"publishing an obscene article contrary to Section 2(1) of the Obscene Publications Act 1959\\". He was granted unconditional bail; the first day of the trial was organised for 16 March 2009. However, at the procedural preliminiaries (directions) hearing in January, the defendant made it known that given the seriousness of the case he would be represented by a QC (Queen's Counsel), after which the Crown Prosecution Service gave notice of its intention to similarly employ one. The trial was postponed to 29 June 2009. Outcome Walker appeared at Newcastle Crown Court on that day. The prosecution withdrew its case after hearing evidence from an IT expert. The CPS explained it charged Walker as it believed that the story in question could be \\"easily accessed\\" by young fans of Girls Aloud. This was because of the definition of obscenity used in the act requires prosecutors to prove that those exposed to the material were previously unaware of its obscene nature. Those who actively seek out such material are deemed unlikely to be corrupted by it. However, the IT expert showed that the article could only be located by those specifically searching for such material. A spokesperson for the CPS said that the prosecution was unable to provide sufficient evidence to contradict this new evidence and therefore saw no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. Mr Justice Faulks, presiding, returned a formal verdict of not guilty to the charge.

It was destroyed in 1943. The Holocaust in Luxembourg refers to the systematic persecution, expulsion and murder of Jews in Luxembourg after its occupation and later annexation by Nazi Germany. It is generally believed that the Jewish population of Luxembourg had numbered around 3,500 before the war although many fled into France at the time of the German invasion of 10 May 1940 or in the early months of the occupation. Around 1,000 to 2,5000 were murdered during the Holocaust after being deported to ghettos and extermination camps in Eastern Europe. History Around 3,500 Jews lived in Luxembourg before World War II. Many were recent arrivals in the country who had fled from persecution in Nazi Germany and Eastern Europe and who were attracted by the commercial ties between Luxembourg and its surrounding countries and the common use of German language. A significant number fled on 10 May 1940 at the time of the German invasion of Luxembourg as part of the \\"exodus\\" of French, Belgian, and Luxembourgish civilians into eastern and southern France. The German occupation regime established in Luxembourg extended the Nuremberg Race Laws to the territory on 5 September 1940 and encouraged Jews to leave. 2,500 Jews had left Luxembourg, mainly for the \\"Free Zone\\" in Vichy France by October 1941 when emigration was banned. Many of the emigrants would become victims of the Holocaust in France. From September 1941, all Jews in Luxembourg were forced to wear the yellow badge to identify them in public. The Nazi administration interned the remaining 800 Jews in Luxembourg at Fuenfbrunnen transit camp in Troisvierges (Ulflingen) in the north of the country. The programme of deportation began in October 1941 principally to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto in German-occupied Poland as well as the concentration camps at Theresienstadt and Auschwitz. Only 36 deportees from Luxembourg are believed to have survived the war. Luxembourg was formally annexed into Nazi Germany in August 1942. Aftermath Luxembourg was liberated by the Western Allies in early 1945. However, a law of 1950 prevented the majority of Jewish victims and their families from reclaiming assets held in the country before the war by preventing pre-1931 migrants from eligeability. It was said in 2019 that Luxembourg \\"is the only country in Western Europe with major, unaddressed restitution issues\\". The government of Xavier Bettel apologised to the Jewish community of Luxembourg for the country's role in the Holocaust, including the complicity of \\"some public officials\\", in 2015.

The school was later used by Charlotte Military Academy, which architect Herbert B. Hunter (1890-1976) attended. The school building stood at East Morehead and South Boulevard in Charlotte, North Carolina. North Carolina Military Institute was established by Charlotte businessmen and Dr. Charles J. Fox. By April 1861 it had 150 students. During the start of the U.S. Civil War Governor John Willis Ellis ordered cadets from the school to Raleigh to serve as drill masters. The school closed during the war and the buildings were used as a Confederate hospital for part of it. Daniel Harvey Hill, who trained at West Point was superintendent of the school at the start of the war and was elected colonel of the 1st North Carolina Volunteers. Charles C. Lee was also teaching at the school at the start of the war. He became a lieutenant colonel of the 1st North Carolina Volunteers and then colonel after Hill's promotion. He also served as colonel of the 37th North Carolina Troops and was killed at Frayser's Farm. He is interred in Charlotte. James H.

At the end of the second year cadets received a furlough of months. There were a scientific and a primary department.

He was portrayed by the English actor John Hurt. Although he precedes Christopher Eccleston's Ninth Doctor in the show's fictional chronology, his first onscreen appearance came eight years after Eccleston's; the War Doctor was retroactively created by showrunner Steven Moffat for productions celebrating the show's 50th anniversary. Within the programme's narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien, a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body, but in doing so, gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality. This plot device has allowed a number of actors to portray different incarnations of the Doctor over the show's long run. The War Doctor, not so named within the episodes in which he appears, is introduced as the incarnation of the Doctor who fought in the Time War of the show's modern-day backstory. He was created as a result of a conscious decision of the Eighth Doctor, played by Paul McGann, to take up arms and become a warrior; in accepting this duty, the War Doctor disowned the title of \\"Doctor\\", and after the war's end is viewed with disdain by his subsequent incarnations, who reclaim the title that the character is known by. In the 50th anniversary special \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", however, the Eleventh Doctor played by Matt Smith revises his opinion of this incarnation after revisiting the final moments of the war. In his original conception of the show's anniversary special, Moffat had written the Ninth Doctor as having ended the Time War. However, he was \\"pretty certain\\" that Christopher Eccleston would decline to return to the role, which he did. As he also had reservations about making Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor the incarnation who had ended the war, he created a never-before-seen past incarnation of the Doctor, which allowed him \\"a freer hand\\" in writing the story, acknowledging that the success of doing this would be predicated on being able to cast an actor with a significant enough profile. Costume English actor John Hurt portrayed the War Doctor In \\"The Name of the Doctor\\", Hurt wore a burgundy and ivory scarf in a herringbone style. He also wore a dark brown leather trenchcoat, similar to the Ninth Doctor's black leather peacoat as well as a green brown moleskin waistcoat, dark tan trousers, and gunmetal grey leather gaiters similar to ones worn by the Eighth Doctor. Costume designer Howard Burden said that Hurt's character was a \\"dark Doctor\\" existing between the Doctor's eighth and ninth incarnations. He was also seen to use a new sonic screwdriver with a scarlet light, closely matching the prop used by the Third and Fourth Doctors. He kept it in a bandolier originally worn by Cass, played by Emma Campbell- Jones, a young pilot who dies after refusing the Doctor's help due to him being a Time Lord. Appearances The War Doctor first appears at the conclusion of the series seven finale \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" when the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) and companion Clara Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman) are trapped in the Doctor's timeline. Clara believes she has seen all the Doctor's faces, but does not recognise one figure. The Doctor (Smith) tells her that he is yet another version of himself, albeit one who has lost the right to the name of the Doctor; when the figure declares that he did what he did \\"without choice [...] in the name of peace and sanity\\", the Doctor, before he and Clara return to the universe, states that the figure did not make his choice in the name of the Doctor. The War Doctor's origins are given in the mini-episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", set during the Time War referred to in the series. After the Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann) is killed in a spaceship crash while trying to save an innocent woman, who rejected his efforts because she regards the Time Lords and the Daleks as equally monstrous for the collateral damage inflicted in the war, he is temporarily resurrected by the Sisterhood of Karn (last seen in The Brain of Morbius) and urged to take a stand and join the war. He is offered an elixir designed to trigger a life- saving regeneration into a form of his choice. Feeling the universe has no more need for a doctor, he requests to become a warrior. After regenerating into the War Doctor, he disowns the name of the Doctor, with his new incarnation's first words being \\"Doctor no more\\". In the 50th anniversary special \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", having fought in the Time War for many years, the greatly aged War Doctor steals the superweapon known as \\"the Moment\\" with the intent of wiping out all combatants in the war along with his home world of Gallifrey. However, the Moment is sentient, possessing a conscience that requires the user to morally justify his use of it, and interacts with him in the shape of his future companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). Although acknowledging that she can do what the Doctor asks of her, she then sends the War Doctor into his future to meet the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors (David Tennant and Matt Smith respectively) to understand the sadness and regret they endured while continuing the good he failed to accomplish. Having witnessed his future selves prevent a Zygon conquest of Earth and the destruction of London, the War Doctor concludes that he must destroy Gallifrey, reflecting that he is lighting the fire so that better Doctors can be forged, only for the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors to travel back to activate the Moment with him, the later Doctors declaring that they now recognise the War Doctor as having been \\"the Doctor on the day it wasn't possible to get it right\\". However, aided by the Moment's interface which shows them a vision of the horror and destruction wrought in the Fall of Arcadia, the last battle in which the War Doctor fought, and Clara's plea to remember the vow they made in taking their name, the Doctors ultimately conclude that the loss of life that would be caused by using the Moment is something they cannot accept. They instead pool their resources, and with the help of the Doctor's various incarnations, attempt to save Gallifrey by freezing it in a moment in time, creating the illusion of the planet's own destruction. The Daleks are effectively tricked into firing on each other, annihilating themselves. The War Doctor accepts that upon returning to his own timeframe, he will forget his own heroic actions and must live with the false belief that he killed his own people. Before leaving, he takes a moment to thank his future selves for helping him \\"become the Doctor\\" again. Once inside his TARDIS, he begins to regenerate, realising that his body is \\"wearing a bit thin\\", echoing the First Doctor's utterances in The Tenth Planet. The War Doctor appears in archive footage in the 2014 episode \\"Listen\\". The episode reveals that the barn to which the War Doctor travelled, in order to activate the Moment, was part of the Doctor's childhood home. Through similar footage he also appeared in \\"The Zygon Invasion\\", during which it is learned that the peace talks orchestrated by himself and his future incarnations resulted in 20 million Zygons taking up residence on Earth disguised as humans as part of an uneasy truce. The War Doctor appeared in a sequence along with all the other incarnations of the Doctor, when the Thirteenth Doctor broke out of the Matrix in ‚ÄúThe Timeless Children‚Äù. In other media The War Doctor appears in the BBC Books novel Engines of War by George Mann. The novel details the events leading to the Doctor's decision to detonate the Moment, as seen in \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", including his decision to act against the resurrected Rassilon and the death of a temporary companion as he acts to stop a Dalek plot to develop a weapon that could erase Gallifrey from history. The War Doctor appears alongside the other incarnations of the Doctor in the 2014 collection The Shakespeare Notebooks. The War Doctor's segment is titled \\"A Prologue\\", and purports to be a fictionalised account of the Time War written by William Shakespeare. A further prose story titled \\"The Stranger\\" was released in 2015 as part of the Heroes and Monsters Collection. In May 2015, it was announced by Titan Books that the War Doctor would be the fourth incarnation joining the Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors in their Four Doctors crossover mini-series. This is the War Doctor's second appearance in comics, the incarnation having previously featured in a non-speaking cameo in IDW's Dead Man's Hand. The War Doctor appears in the first issue, in a flashback. The War Doctor - along with his companion, the Squire - also appears in a number of flashbacks in the second year of Titan's Eleventh Doctor comic series, which involves the Doctor being put on trial for a crime he is believed to have committed in his earlier incarnation. The War Doctor essentially takes over as the lead incarnation in the stories The Organ Grinder and Kill God, with the Eleventh Doctor being largely absent from both stories, while his current companion Alice travels back to the Time War to help set up the events that the Eleventh Doctor is experiencing in the 'present', the crisis ending with Alice returning to her era and the War Doctor's memory of his time with her scrambled to preserve history. The War Doctor, along with the other twelve incarnations, appears in the 2015 video game Lego Dimensions, voiced using clips of John Hurt's dialogue from his episodes. The War Doctor also appears as a playable character in the mobile game Doctor Who Legacy. A younger War Doctor appears in a flashback sequence in a Twelfth Doctor storyline, which sees the Twelfth Doctor reflect on the events that led to the apparent death of his old acquaintance Fey Truscott-Sade and his own darker view on the Time War. Audio dramas It was announced in October 2015 that a series of War Doctor audio plays starring John Hurt was in production by Big Finish Productions. The fourth and final set, Casualties of War, was released on 23 February 2017, a month after Hurt's death. This last set features the return of an old companion, Leela (Louise Jameson). *Only the Monstrous (2015) **The Innocent **The Thousand Worlds **The Heart of the Battle *Infernal Devices (2016) **Legion of the Lost **A Thing of Guile **The Neverwhen *Agents of Chaos (2016) **The Shadow Vortex **The Eternity Cage **Eye of Harmony *Casualties of War (2017) **Pretty Lies **The Lady of Obsidian **The Enigma Dimension In 2020, Big Finish announced a prequel series entitled ‚ÄúThe War Doctor Begins‚Äù.

The eponymous first game in the series was released in 2003 on the PlayStation 2, and has since been followed by a sequel, a prequel, and a spin-off. It was conceived by Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki as a gameplay hybrid between Ace Combat and Dynasty Warriors 2. The story was created by Shiba, Iwasaki, Yoko Taro and Sawako Natori, who were influenced by European folklore and popular anime series and movies of the day. Shiba, Yoko, and Sawako have had involvement in every entry of the series since its debut. The setting of the main series is a Northern European style dark fantasy world where humans and creatures from myth and legends live side by side, while the spin-off games Nier and Nier: Automata are set in an alternative reality of the future leading from one of the first game's possible endings. The stories generally focus on the fortunes and personalities of a small group of protagonists either directly or indirectly connected to and affected by the events of the story. Dark or mature plot and character themes and multiple endings have become a staple of the series. Their popularity in Japan has resulted in multiple adaptations and additional media in the form of novelizations and manga. The series is considered popular in Japan, having sold well and gained a cult following, but it was a niche series in Western territories until Nier: Automata. The main games have become noted for their dark storylines and mixture of ground-based and aerial combat, while Nier stood out because of its mixture of gameplay styles. The series has received mixed to positive reception in both Japan and the West: the majority of praise has been given to its story, characters and music, while the gameplay has come in for criticisms for being repetitive or poorly designed. Games *Drakengard, the first installment in the franchise. It released for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) in September 2003 in Japan, March and May 2004 in North America and Europe respectively. Square Enix published the title in Japan and North America, while Take-Two Interactive published it in European territories. A Europe- exclusive mobile port was released in August 2004. The mobile version was co- developed and co-published with Macrospace. **Drakengard 2, the second installment in the series and direct sequel to the first game. It released on the PS2 in June 2005 in Japan, February 2006 in North America and March of the same year in Europe and Australia. For its release in western territories, Square Enix partnered with European game developer and publisher Ubisoft. Ubisoft also handled the game's localization. **Drakengard 3, the third main installment in the series and a prequel to the first game. It released on the PS3 in December 2013 in Japan and May 2014 in North America and Europe. Like Nier, it was published in all regions by Square Enix. *Nier, a spin-off from the main series. Nier was released on the PlayStation 3 (PS3) and Xbox 360 (as Nier Replicant in Japan for PS3 only, Nier Gestalt in Japan for Xbox 360, and Nier in North America and Europe) in April 2010 across all regions. It was published by Square Enix across all regions. **Nier: Automata, a distant sequel to Nier, set in the same universe but thousands of years in the future. It was released for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows in March 2017, and for Xbox One in June 2018. **Nier Reincarnation, a spin-off title for mobile platforms, set in the Nier universe but disconnected from the other titles. Development=History The original Japanese series logo The idea for Drakengard originated in 1999 between Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki. The gameplay was conceived as a blend of elements from Ace Combat and Dynasty Warriors 2. The team developing the game went under the moniker \\"Project Dragonsphere\\". The team was joined by director Yoko Taro, who was the main drive behind the game's dark atmosphere. It was Shiba's first project as a producer. As Yoko was told there would not be a sequel, multiple endings were created. When it was localized and released in the west, references to things such as sexual taboos were censored. In addition, the title was changed, as Drag-On Dragoon was considered wrong for a western audience. Drakengard was considered enough of a success that a sequel was commissioned. Multiple staff members returned for the creation of the second game, although Yoko was mostly tied up with other projects and was replaced as director by Akira Yasui. Yoko still had a role in development, and he and Yasui had creative clashes during development. Yasui ended up making Drakengard 2 the thematic opposite of the previous game, employing a lighter tone and broader color palette. Nier originated when Yoko and Shiba teamed up to create a third Drakengard game. As the project continued, it became more detached from the main continuity and eventually developed into an entirely new spin-off. Despite what it became, Yoko has stated that he considers Nier to be the true Drakengard 3. It was the last game developed by Cavia. After its release, Cavia closed down and was absorbed by AQ Interactive, then Yoko Taro left to pursue a wider range of projects. A stalled attempt to begin production of further games in the series at AQ Interactive was blamed by Shiba on a prevalent trend at the time for light-weight games for the general gaming community. Later, Yoko and Shiba came together again to create a proper second sequel to Drakengard, with the intention of creating a hard core RPG for the fanbase. Unlike the previous games in the series, Drakengard 3 was developed by Access Games, a developer whose noted games included Deadly Premonition, and brought in team members used to create action games. During the run-up to Drakengard 3s release, both Yoko and Shiba expressed their willingness to continue the series on the PlayStation 4 if the latest game was enough of a success. Speaking in 2014 after the game's release, Yoko stated that the series was on hold due to lack of funds. A new Nier game was revealed to be in development at Square Enix and PlatinumGames. Writing and character design Artwork by regular series artist Kimihiko Fujisaka, featuring Caim and Angelus (Drakengard), Nowe and Legna (Drakengard 2), Zero and Mikhail (Drakengard 3) and the Replicant version of Nier and Grimoire Weiss (Nier). The stories of the original game's characters were written by Yoko, Shiba and Iwasaki, while the main game script was written by Sawako Natori, who would go on to co-write the main scenarios for future Drakengard games. Yoko designed the darker elements to both contrast and actively compete with the likes of Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. Yoko conceived the \\"insane\\" characters around the premise that people who killed hundreds of people in pursuit of their goals and took satisfaction from it were naturally insane. During the production of Nier, his focus changed to writing a story where everyone believed they were in the right whatever their actions. Through the series, Yoko has also been attempting to answer the question of why people are driven to kill. Although some of the dark narrative themes were kept for Drakengard 2, many of the other narrative elements were made more mainstream. Drakengard 3 was intended to return to a dark aesthetic, but also to include moments of humor and tie in with Nier. The character designer for the Drakengard games is Kimihiko Fujisaka. Initially a minor staff member at Cavia, the team were impressed by his skill as an amateur artist and he was recommended for the post of character designer for the game. The designs for both the characters and the world were influenced by armor and clothing of Medieval Europe. He returned in the same capacity for Drakengard 2, and later for Nier. Disliking some of his initial designs for Drakengard, he took the opportunity to remodel them more to his liking for the arcade game Lord of Vermilion. In Drakengard 3, Fujisaka designed the protagonist Zero around the dark themes of the game, although some unusual elements were nearly cut. The other female characters were inspired by Puella Magi Madoka Magica, while the male characters, considered a low priority, were designed around male archetypes and approved quickly. The character designs for Nier were handled by an artist under the moniker D.K. For Niers international release, the protagonist was redesigned from a teenager to an adult character. This was because the publishers felt an older character would appeal more to western players. For Nier: Automata, the main character designs were handled by Akihiko Yoshida, an artist noted for his work on the Final Fantasy series. While he was initially expected to refuse, he agreed as several staff members at his company CyDesignation were fans of Nier. For his designs, Yoko requested he focus on smooth outlines and black coloring. Other characters were designed by Yuya Nagai and Toshiyuki Itahana. Music The first game's soundtrack was created by Nobuyoshi Sano and Takayuki Aihara. The two created the score using samples from well-known classical composers. The second game's soundtrack was composed by Ryoki Matsumoto and Aoi Yoshiki, who had never before been involved with video game soundtracks. The game's Japanese theme song, Hitori, was sung by Mika Nakashima. The music for Nier was composed by Keiichi Okabe, who composed the soundtrack as something different from the main series, and to directly reflect the sombre tone of the game's setting and story. Singer Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans) wrote and sung the vocal tracks, and performed many tracks in an invented language dubbed \\"Chaos Language\\". \\"Chaos Language\\" is less a language and more a writing style, as each individual song has a different language based on a real-world language. The one exception to this is \\"Song Of The Ancients\\" which is sung in a language based upon multiple different languages, instead of a single language. Okabe returned to compose the soundtrack for Drakengard 3: in an interview, he stated that, in composing the music, he tried to emulate the work of the earlier composer without imitating them. He also commented that the result was very unlike the traditional Square Enix game. The game features two theme songs: \\"Black Song\\", performed by Eir Aoi, and \\"This Silence is Mine\\", the game's theme song proper, written and sung by Chihiro Onitsuka. Okabe is again providing the music for Nier: Automata, with singer Emi Evans also returning. Common elements=Setting Midgard, the setting of the main Drakengard games, as it appears in Drakengard 3. The world has been described by Anime News Network as \\"a warped version of medieval Europe\\". The Drakengard games take place in a dark fantasy version of Medieval Europe called Midgard. Humans appear to be the predominant species, although races such as dragons, fairies and elves are shown to exist. The setting, mythos, and landscape borrow extensively from the lore of Northern Europe. The world is overseen by a group of unnamed gods who have yet to make a personal appearance. The gods are served by beings known as the Watchers, entities created to destroy humanity because they are considered a failure. The Watchers are kept from entering the world with the seals, which act to keep the world in balance: should the seals be destroyed, the Watchers would enter the world and destroy humanity. At the core of the seals is the Goddess of the Seal, a mortal virgin female chosen and branded with the final seal: if all the seals are destroyed, all that stands between the Watchers and the world is the death of the Goddess herself. A core element of the Drakengard universe is the ability for humans and beasts to form a Pact, a magical bond which links their souls and grants the human partner great power at the cost of some physical ability or personal trait (their voice, singing abilities, etc.). Pacts are normally entered into by beasts so they can feed off negative emotions, but sometimes they will enter a pact for other reasons. A recurring element across the series is the representation of magic using the Celestial Alphabet, with a common letter arrangement representing the human gene. The universe of the Drakengard series is split between multiple timelines. Events in those timelines are separate, but they can overlap. The core timeline is formed from Drakengard and its sequel. Drakengard 3 acts as the first game's prequel, but most of its events take place in separate timelines leading to different outcomes. In Drakengard 3, a malevolent flower uses servants called the Intoners, women gifted with the power to use magic through song, as instruments of humanity's destruction. In Drakengard, which succeeds the fifth version of Drakengard 3s events detailed in a supplementary novel, the Watchers use a group known as the Cult of Watchers to spark a religious war and destroy the seals. In Drakengard 2, the Watchers continue to use the former head of the cult to destroy the new seals, while the dragons prepare to usurp the gods and rule over the world. Nier is set in an alternative reality created by events stemming from Drakengards fifth ending: in this reality, our modern world was decimated by a plague created by the magical beings who came through the portal, bringing humanity to the brink of extinction. Nier: Automata takes place after the fourth ending of Nier, featuring appearances and mentions of characters from both Nier and the Drakengard games. Gameplay The Drakengard games feature a mix of action-based hack-and- slash combat during ground-based battles and aerial combat mixed in with RPG leveling mechanics. In the original, the player guides the characters around ground-based battles to combat small groups of enemy units. In aerial combat, the player takes control of the protagonist's dragon partner. In these situations, the dragon can either lock onto a target and unleash a barrage of small fireballs, or the player can manually aim and fire large bursts of flame, which do more damage but do not home in on a target. Basic gameplay changed little for Drakengard 2, but there are some differences and additions, such as weapon types being tied to the character they are associated with, with changing them also swapping the character. The dragon gameplay remained virtually unchanged, apart from the ability, during air-ground missions, for the dragon to swoop down on a group of enemies in a special attack depicted in a short cutscene. In Nier and Drakengard 3, the player controls the main protagonist with two other characters acting as AI-controlled supports. Drakengard 3 was designed to be a faster experience than the previous games, with the protagonist being given a special hyper-mode and the ability to freely switch between weapons without pausing the action. Aerial gameplay was also changed, with the dragon now capable of ground combat. Nier, while featuring similar hack-and-slash combat, also includes other gameplay types such as a top-down view for puzzle areas, 2D style areas for buildings or similar structures. Side-quests were also added, which often involved fetch quests, fishing and farming. Themes and influences One of the running narrative themes for the main series is Immorality, which also became the key character theme and was expressed through their personalities and actions. The second game also focused on themes of war and death. The theme for the world of Drakengard 3, as described by composer Keiichi Okabe, is \\"the sense of contrast\\". Multiple anime series have influenced the series' characters over the years, including Neon Genesis Evangelion, Sister Princess and Puella Magi Madoka Magica. The series writer, Sawako Natori, drew inspiration for her writing from sh≈çnen manga. The original game world was designed around Celtic and Norse myths, together with Japanese-style revisionism. The team for the original game were influenced by Asian epic movies and western action- adventure films such as the 1999 remake of The Mummy and Dragonheart. While developing Nier, the team drew inspiration from the God of War series, while the narrative structure was inspired by the September 11 attacks and the War on Terror. The central theme of Nier: Automata is struggling out of a bad situation, defined by the game's staff using the Japanese word \\"agaku\\". Related media The games received multiple adaptations and additional story content in the form of novelizations, manga and supplementary material. The first game received two novelizations: Drag-On Dragoon: Side Story on November 28, 2003, and Drag-On Dragoon: Magnitude \\"Negative\\" on January 23, 2004. The first book was written by Emi Nagashima, writing under her pen name of Jun Eishima, and the second by Takashi Aizawa. The novelization of Drakengard 2, written again by Nagashima, was released on September 30, 2005. Nagashima wrote character stories and manga for Drakengard 3 leading up to that game's release. The manga was Drag-On Dragoon: Utahime Five, a prequel following the game's main antagonists, and Drag-On Dragoon: Shi ni Itaru Aka, which acts as a sequel, although for Branch A, as it along with Branches B, C, D, and E lead to alternative timelines. A book detailing the narrative connection between Drakengard 3 and Drakengard, titled Drag-On Dragoon 3 Story Side, which serves as the fifth branch similar to the events of B and D, narrated by Brother One, was released on 28 August 2014. Drag-On Dragoon 3 Complete Guide + Setting, a complete guide to the game with extra features explaining the game chronology and a novella set after the events of Shi ni Itaru Aka, was published by ASCII Media Works in 2014. Nier was expanded after release with a CD drama which told of events immediately after the events of Drakengards fifth ending, and a supplementary book titled Grimoire Nier containing extra stories and concept art alongside a fifth ending for the game. Square Enix also paired up with WildStorm to create a digital comic, which detailed the backstories of the game's characters and world. The Japanese girl band Yorha performed on the Drakengard 3 soundtrack, and in 2015 performed a stage production written by Yoko Taro that is directly related to the plot of Nier: Automata. The band's fictional backstory places them as military androids similar to the playable characters in the Nier: Automata game. Reception The Drakengard series has received mixed to positive reviews over the years. So far, the original Drakengard has received the most positive response of the main series games. Drakengard 2 and Drakengard 3 have received lower scores. Each title in the series has received favorable review scores from Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu. The common point of praise for the series through most of its life has been the story. While individual aspects have come in for criticism, the dark atmospheres, unconventional characters and general scenarios have been cited as one of each game's strengths. Despite some mixed feelings from reviewers either for the story as a whole or certain aspects of it, the characters and plot of Drakengard 3 have also been praised. The major exception is Drakengard 2: the story's lighter tone and more traditional narrative were noted and sometimes criticized for being overly simplistic or too similar to other games in the genre. The Drakengard characters have remained popular in Japan, with Dengeki holding a popularity contest for those characters to celebrate the series' tenth anniversary and the announcement of Drakengard 3. Among the most popular characters were the first game's main protagonists, Caim and Angelus (the former having earned the nickname among fans). The characters of Drakengard 3 have also proved to be highly popular. The gameplay has so far come in for major criticism, with the original title's aerial and ground-based gameplay being seen as repetitive and dull, although some reviewers found it entertaining. Drakengard 2 also came in for such criticism, although minor improvements were cited. In contrast, the gameplay of Drakengard 3 was generally praised or seen as an improvement upon the previous two entries, though the dragon-riding segments came in for criticisms for difficult controls. Opinions were divided on Niers unconventional mix of gameplay styles from multiple game genres, with some praising the variety and others seeing it as poorly executed. The series as a whole has gained a cult following in Japan. Each game has sold relatively well in its home market. The original game was a commercial success, selling over 120,000 units in the first week of release and eventually selling over 240,000 copies in Japan. Drakengard 2s first-week sales were similarly impressive, selling 100,000 units. It sold over 203,000 copies by the end of 2005. Drakengard 3 sold just over 15,000 units in its first week, and over 150,000 units by May 2014. The two versions of Nier‚ÄîGestalt and Replicant‚Äîsold roughly 12,500 and 60,000 copies in their first week respectively. Replicant eventually sold over 121,000 in Japan by the end of May 2010. The series has sold over 770,000 units in Japan as of May 2014. Sales figures for western regions are unavailable. The first two games in the main series have both been included in Square Enix's Ultimate Hits series, re-releases of popular titles developed or published by them. As of 2018, the two versions of Nier sold about 700,000 copies worldwide.SQUARE ENIX June 2018 (Nier series had 3.7M including 3M of Automata) Nier: Automata became a worldwide success, shipping over 4 million copies by June 2019, becoming the best-selling title in the franchise.https://www.dualshockers.com/nier-automata-4-million-copies-sold/ , physical shipments and digital sales of Automata have exceeded units worldwide.

Design and performance=Software The Vibe Z originally ran Android 4.2.2 \\"Jelly Bean\\". It now comes with Android 4.3 and Lenovo has announced an upgrade to 4.4 Lenovo customized the dialer in order to facilitate one handed dialling. Lenovo has also included numerous proprietary apps. SECUREit includes antivirus, child safety, privacy and anti-theft functionality. SYNCit backs up and restores contacts, messages, and call logs. SHAREit facilitates file sharing, including via direct connections using Bluetooth and ad-hoc wi-fi. Power Manager extends battery life and protects the battery from premature failure. UC Browser, Navigate 6, Skype, Twitter, Facebook, Accuweather, CamScanner, CamCard, Kingsoft Office, and a some games like Asphalt 7 and Real Football 14 come pre-installed. Hardware The Vibe Z is powered by a 2.2 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, the same processor used in the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the Sony Xperia Z1, and comes with 2 gigabytes of RAM. It has a 5.5-inch IPS display with 1080p resolution. The Vibe Z uses a relatively large 1/3.06-inch backlit 13-megapixel camera sensor paired with a f/1.8 lens and a dual-LED flash in order to achieve good low-light performance and the ability to take ten pictures per second. Lenovo says that a proprietary low-light algorithm further enhances performance. The 5-megapixel front-facing camera has a wide- angle lens with an 84-degree field of view. Lenovo offers a WCDMA + GSM model for China Unicom subscribers, a CDMA2000 + GSM model is available for use on China Telecom, and a LTE + GSM model for the international market. The case is plastic but has metallic finish. It has an anti-fingerprint finish, like that on the Lenovo Vibe X, on its back. The backplate is sealed and cannot be removed to access the battery. The cover includes a trackpad that allows users to accept and reject calls without opening it. The power button is located on top of the shell. The volume rocker is on the left side, while the right side only has a retractable tray for SIM cards. The bottom of the Vibe Z has a standard headset port and a Micro USB port. Lenovo is selling flip covers in multiple colors for the Vibe Z. Lenovo says its battery offers up to 278 hours of standby time. Reviews A review published in Gizbot stated, \\"If you still haven't checked out the super dual cameras that are available with the Vibe Z, it's high time you did yourself a favor and checked out YouTube for related camera videos. And if you don't have that much time in your hand, let us tell you that Vibe Z makes a strong statement with its 5-megapixel front camera and 84¬∞ wide angle lens for high quality self shots, apart from amazing video chat quality. Users can also snap sensational low light images courtesy of a 13 megapixel rear camera in the rear that's fitted with BSI sensor, and can shoot 1080p HD videos.\\" A review published in Techradar stated, \\"I struggled to reach the lock button atop the phone with one hand. Lenovo made it so the volume rocker unlocks the phone, too. I had trouble reaching my thumb across the other side of the screen. Lenovo added a Smart Dialer that shifts the number pad buttons in the direction you tilt the phone for easier one-handed dialing. (Also, Smart Call allows you the answer the phone by just holding it to your ear.) The point is that Lenovo knows just how big its flagship phone is, and it's working to make it easier to operate the Vibe Z more like the phone that it is and less like the tablet that it isn't. Other handset makers are trying, but I've seen nothing this clever.\\" In a review for NDTV, Jamshed Avari wrote, \\"The Vibe Z doesn't feel as though it was made by the same company that regularly produces some of our favourite laptops. It comes across as something entirely new. Lenovo has thrown in a fair number of powerful components and has given the Vibe Z a very distinctive style, but it's the brand name that will ultimately persuade people to give it a chance. Camera irregularities aside, this is a pretty good phone.\\" References Vibe Z Category:Smartphones Category:Android (operating system) devices ","title":"Lenovo Vibe Z"},{"id":"41079759","text":"Ellen Peterson (December 5, 1923 ‚Äì October 14, 2011) was an American activist.

The book, telling the story of a gang of village kids who sneak around secretly doing good deeds, protecting families whose fathers and husbands are in the Red Army, and doing battle against nasty hooligans had a huge impact upon the young Soviet audiences.

Timur and His Squad remained part of the curriculum in every Soviet school even up into the 1990s. Ebin, F. Commentaries to –¢–∏–º—É—Ä –∏ –µ–≥–æ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞. Works by Arkady Gaidar in 4 volumes. Detskaya Literatura. Moscow, 1964. Vol. 4. Pp 398-402. The short novel was adapted into two feature films, Timur and His Team (1940) by Aleksandr Razumny and Timur and His Team (1976) by Aleksandr Blank and Sergei Linkov. Background The story of a boy who organizes his friends into a 'good gang', realizing its sense of adventure into an intricate, intelligent game the purpose of which is to help elders, support minors and fight a group of scoundrels who poison the village life, was evolving through the years, as a result of Gaidar‚Äôs own social experiments of the kind, according to biographer F.Ebin. The semi-autobiographical nature of Timur and His Squad is corroborated by contemporaries, including Konstantin Paustovsky, who, as his son grew seriously ill and was in urgent need of a rare medication, found himself a witness to a quick quasi-military operation in the course of which Gaidar (who was guesting at Paustovsky's house) made a telephone call, summoned the boys who lived in his house and nearby and sent this squad all through the city drugstores to deliver a drug needed in just some forty minutes. Paustovsky concluded: \\"'See, how well does my squad work?' Gaidar enquired, preparing to leave. To thank him was an impossible thing. He used to get very angry when people started thanking him. He considered helping people to be a thing as natural as saying hello or wishing one good health. No one'd be thanked for just wishing you good health, right?\\"The Life and Works by A.P.Gaidar. Detskaya Literatura Publishers. Moscow, 1964. Pp 189-190 Author Ruvim Frayerman remembered: > Once, long before Timur and His Squad had been started Gaidar, said to me: > \\"Why do you think all through the centuries boys were playing outlaws? Come > to think of it, outlaws are baddies who rightly deserve punishment. But > children are perceptive. Playing outlaws, what they did in effect, was > dramatizing the idea of freedom, expressing man's historic longing for it. > In the old times rebellion was a protest against the lack of freedom in a > society. But the Soviet children live through a time, the likes of which > humanity's never known. They won't be playing outlaws fighting kings' men > anymore. They'd rather play the kind of games that would help Soviet > soldiers fight international outlaws.The Life and Works by A.P.Gaidar. > Detskaya Literatura. Moscow, 1964. Pp 177 History Gaidar started writing the book in December 1939. Having published by this time two scripts, \\"Voyennaya Taina\\" (The War Secret) and \\"Sudba Barabanshchika\\" (The Drummer's Fate), he was seeing Timur and His Squad as another scenario. In summer 1940 the film of the same title was shot and released to become an instant success with the young audience. Its script was published for the first time in 1940's issues 7 and 8 of the Pioneer magazine. Having finished the script, Gaidar started re-working the text into a serial novel, which was originally called \\"Duncan\\". The atmosphere of an impending war pervaded the book. On June 14, 1940, Gaidar wrote in a diary: \\"Today 'Duncan' got started, a small novel. The war raging all over the world - there's no more Norway, Holland, Denmark, Luxembourg, Belgium. The Germans are approaching Paris, and Italy joined the war one of these days.\\" Soon the original title got reinstated. \\"Today finished the 'Timur' novel. It was mostly written in Moscow, in the course of the last two weeks,\\" reads the August 27, 1940 diary entry. On September 5, 1940, Pionerskaya Pravda newspaper started publishing 'Timur and His Squad' in serial form and continued to do so up until October the 8th. Simultaneously, All-Union Radio broadcast a radio drama version of the novel. In 1941 the novel was published in book form. The impact of it upon the young readership was immense. Children's 'squads' started to form all over the country. \\"Thousands and thousands of Soviet pioneers have followed Timur's initiative and are helping elders in their deadly fight with fascist scoundrels,\\" Pionerskaya Pravda wrote on July 19, 1941. Plot summary Daughters of the Red Army Colonel Alexandrov, Zhenya (13) and Olga (18) come from Moscow to their dacha in a village and find themselves amidst strange night time activities. In an old barn Zhenya discovers the headquarters of some mysterious organization. She meets Timur, whose Squad ‚Äì several dozens of well-organized boys ‚Äì in a clandestine fashion perform charitable acts, helping families of the Army officers and soldiers, supporting elders and minors, fighting off the gang hooligans led by a boy named Kvakin. Timur's 'games' are causing much suspicion, on the part of Timur's uncle Georgy, among other people. \\"But tell me, what kind of games did you and your friends play when you were young?\\" ‚Äì asks the boy. \\"Well, we were running, jumping about and climbed roofs too, but at least our games were simple and well-understood,\\" Georgy responds. Olga spots Timur talking to Kvakin and makes the conclusion that they are of the same ilk. Zhenya knows otherwise; she develops a strong feeling for Timur, the young leader who is honest, noble, brave and modest to the point of reticence. In a decisive battle between the two gangs Timur and his boys win out. Finally, in quite a dramatic fashion he helps Zhenya to meet her father who goes to the war, as does Georgy, now Olga's friend. \\"You live for other people, and people will respond in a kind,\\" says Olga to Timur whom she now sees she totally misunderstood.Gaidar, Arkady. –¢–∏–º—É—Ä –∏ –µ–≥–æ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞.

Gebre is the first immigrant elected as an officer in the federation's history. Prior to his election, he served as Executive Director of the Orange County Labor Federation. Early life When he was 14 years old, Gebre escaped war-torn Ethiopia, walking for weeks to Sudan. He lived in a Sudanese refugee camp until he was 15, when he was granted political refuge status and arrived in Los Angeles alone. Gebre graduated in 1987 from Belmont High School in downtown Los Angeles. He attended Cal Poly Pomona on a track and field scholarship, and later graduated from the college with a bachelor's degree in International Marketing. While in college, he worked his first union job as a night shift loader at UPS and a member of Teamsters Local 396. He credits his union job for making it possible for him to afford to attend college.  California labor movement and state politics  Early in his career, Gebre worked for then-Speaker of the California State Assembly, Willie L. Brown Jr., as a legislative aid and was twice elected as President of the California Young Democrats. He was the first Black-American and first immigrant elected to lead the California Young Democrats. Gebre's first union organizing effort in Orange County was a successful campaign for sanitation workers. He served as the Executive Director of Frontlash, which was then the youth and college arm of the AFL- CIO. From 1997 to 1999, Gebre was Director of Governmental Relation for Laborers Local 270. He later served as the Southern California Political Director of the California Labor Federation. In 2006, Gebre began working for the Orange County Labor Federation, an umbrella organization of 90 unions, first as its Political Director, and then beginning in 2008 as the group's Executive Director. As director, he was credited with helping to \\"turn the umbrella group of unions into a political force in what remains Republican territory.\\" As part of an effort to defeat California Proposition 32 on the 2012 ballot, Gebre led the Orange County federation through an extensive voter outreach and education effort that was credited as playing a critical role in the defeat of the initiative. AFL-CIO career Labor activists have suggested Gabre's election \\"represents a generational and philosophical change at the federation -- one that values new progressive partnerships and non- traditional organizing.\\" During the convention at which Gebre was elected, the AFL-CIO highlighted worker organizing campaigns that used non-traditional models of organizing within immigrant communities. In an interview with Huffington Post, Gabre said, \\"I have personally never seen a labor meeting more open and ready to bring in more people - a labor movement that is now willing to speak up for the people who sweat behind the counters and in the kitchens of McDonald's, the cab drivers, the domestic workers, and the day laborers.\\" Gebre is the Executive Vice President of AFL-CIO, the third highest-position in the labor movement. He was given the \\"Roving Ambassador for Peace‚Äù award in 2017, because he was dedicated to social justice and committed to promoting fair employment.Labor Leader, Tefere Gebre, Awarded Peace Prize CounterPunch.

Since 2018, he has headed Human Rights Watch's Alliances and Partnerships program. Kiai is also active in human rights work in Kenya, where he has focused on combating corruption, supporting political reform, and fighting against impunity following post-election violence that engulfed Kenya in 2008.  Education, career, and awards  Kiai's most prominent human rights work began in 1992, when he co-founded the unofficial Kenya Human Rights Commission. He served as the Commission's executive director until September 1998. Kiai then moved on to become Director of Amnesty International's Africa Program (1999-2001) and the Africa Director of the International Human Rights Law Group (now Global Rights, 2001-2003) before finally serving as Chairman of the Kenya National Human Rights Commission from 2003 to 2008. From July 2010 to April 2011, Kiai was the Executive Director of the International Council on Human Rights Policy.

Kiai co-founded the local Kenyan NGO InformAction, which uses a multimedia approach ‚Äì primarily video production ‚Äì to help educate Kenyans about their human rights. He formerly wrote a regular column for the Daily Nation, but resigned in 2018, citing alleged interference with publishing decisions by the government He now writes for the Standard (Kenya). In 2014, Freedom House awarded Kiai its Freedom Award, an acknowledgment begun in 1943 \\"to extol recipients' invaluable contribution to the cause of freedom and democracy.\\" Prior Freedom Award honorees include Chen Guangcheng, Aung San Suu Kyi, Vaclav Havel, the 14th Dalai Lama, Medgar Evers, and Edward R. Murrow. In October 2016, Kiai received the United Nations Foundation's Leo Nevas Award for his work as Special Rapporteur. The award recognizes \\"those who have served as agents of change in advancing international human rights.\\" In December 2016, he was awarded the 2016 AFL-CIO George Meany-Lane Kirkland Human Rights Award for his \\"dedication to and effectiveness in highlighting the widespread denial of fundamental human rights at work and in society.\\". In September 2018, he joined Human Rights Watch to launch its Alliances and Partnerships program. Kiai is an outspoken supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, arguing that the \\"involvement of additional actors such as parliamentarians and civil society is critical to democratizing the UN\\". In May 2020, Kiai was named as one of 20 inaugural members of the Facebook Oversight Board, which makes content moderation decisions on Facebook and Instagram. Kiai is a lawyer by profession, trained at Nairobi and Harvard Universities.  Work as Special Rapporteur  Maina Kiai took up his functions as the first UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association on May 1, 2011. He completed his second and final term on April 30, 2017, and was succeeded by Ms. Annalisa Ciampi of Italy. Special Rapporteurs are independent from any Government or organization and serve in their individual capacity. As Special Rapporteur, Kiai authored or co-authored seven reports to the Human Rights Council on the subjects of: * Best practices in promoting the freedoms of assembly and association (May 2012); * Civil society's ability to access funding and resources (April 2013); * The plight of groups \\"most at risk\\" when exercising their assembly and association rights (June 2014); * The rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association in the context of natural resource exploitation (June 2015); * A joint report on recommendations for the effective management of assemblies (March 2016), with fellow Special Rapporteur Christof Heyns. * Fundamentalism's impact on assembly and association rights (June 2016); * Imagining a World Without Participation: Mapping the Achievements of Civil Society (June 2017 - presented by successor Annalisa Ciampi) Kiai also authored four reports to the UN General Assembly, on the subjects of: * The rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association in the context of elections (October 2013). * The effect that multilateral institutions have on promoting and protecting assembly and association rights (October 2014). * Comparing countries treatments of businesses and associations, and exploring why businesses generally get much more favorable treatment (October 2015). * The difficulties faced by the world's most marginalized workers in exercising their assembly and association rights in the workplace (October 2016).

As Special Rapporteur, Kiai issued more than 190 press statements via OHCHR and sent over 900 communications to UN member states. Kiai conducted the first ever official country visit to the United States by a UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association in July 2016.  Retribution for human rights work  Kiai has been subjected to threats and harassment for his human rights work. In August 2017, Kiai was briefly blocked from flying out of Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport; officials claimed he needed government clearance to leave the country. In September 2013, Kiai reported that \\"thugs\\" had come to his mother's homestead in Nyeri and threatened to burn it down. In 2008, Kiai was one among several human rights defenders who received death threats, as post- election violence raged in Kenya. A coalition of Kenyan civil society groups reported that they had become aware of a plot involving \\"a five- or- so man elite squad that has been tasked with the liquidation of, inter alia, Maina Kiai, Chair of the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.\\"  References  External links  * Kiai's website for the UN Special Rapporteur mandate * OHCHR website for Kiai's Special Rapporteur mandate * Kiai's Twitter * Kiai's Facebook Category:United Nations special rapporteurs Category:University of Nairobi alumni Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Kenyan lawyers Category:Living people Category:Kenyan officials of the United Nations Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Maina Kiai"},{"id":"41079869","text":"Galomecalpa secunda is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

Accessdate = 26 February 2006 His mother died when he was aged seven and on the suggestion of Shaykh Osman Fazli he was sent to c.1663 Edirne (Adrinaople), to receive traditional education under the scholar  øAbd-al-Baki, a relative of the Shaykh In 1673, age 21, he went to Istanbul to the public classes of Osman Fazli, the head Sheykh, of the Jelveti (Djilwatiyya) order, who initiated him into that discipline. ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± also attended the lectures of other scholars, learnt Persian to study Attar, Rumi, ·∏§ƒÅfi·∫ì and Jami. He also studied Islamic calligraphy and music and set to music many hymns of the 17th century mystic HudƒÅyƒ´, founder of the Jelveti order. In 1675, age 23, Osman Fazli sent him, with three assistant dervishes, to Skopje (√úsk√ºb), Macedonia, to establish a ·π≠arƒ´qah (a monastery) for teaching Jelveti philosophy). Some welcomed them and ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± married the daughter of Sheikh Mu·π£·π≠afƒÅ  øUshshƒÅ·∏≥ƒ´. Encouraged by his master's letters he wrote his most brilliant sermons. However he offended the townsfolk by overly-berating them for what he considered loose behaviour. Despite Osman Fazli explaining to him that censure was not the Jelveti way he did not rein in his zeal and his antagonists forced them to leave, which greatly displeased his wife, it being her home town. In 1682 he was invited to Strumica, Macedonia to teach public classes. There he also began to write books, but so as to not be confused with the author Ismail Hakki Ankaravi, a famous commentator on the Mathnavi, he came to be always given a suffix, such as H√¢lvet√Æ, Bursevi, or √úsk√ºdari Amongst Sufis, Bursa in Anatolia was first made famous by the 14th century ShƒÅikhs Somuncu Baba and Haji Bayram, but in 1685 the then Sheykh of Bursa died and Fasli appointed Ismail Hakki as the new Sheykh. Unfortunately his first years in Bursa coincided with the difficult period after the Ottoman Empire's disastrous loss at the Battle of Vienna and the Holy League's invasion of the Ottoman Balkans, so the economy was in abject misery and IsmƒÅ øƒ´l ·∏§a·∏≥·∏≥ƒ´ had to sell his books to survive. In 1690 he journeyed to Cyprus to visit his master, Osman Farsli, who was in exile for his insistent criticism of Ottoman foreign policy; on his death Ismail Hakki succeeded him as the head of the order. In 1695‚Äì1697 Sultan Mustafa II requested Ismail Hakki accompany his military campaigns against the Habsburg Empire and he was in several battles until severely wounded. Osman Farsli had foreseen the end of the Ottoman line and Bursevi defined the reason for its decline as the estrangement of spiritual and political powers, represented in his discourses by a Sheikh and a Sultan, thus formulating a Sufi interpretation of the Ottoman decline paradigm. In 1700 Ismail Hakki performed the Hajj, the pilgrimage, but on returning from Mecca the caravan was slaughtered by Bedouin brigands. Ismail was left to die but managed to reach Damascus. In 1700 he returned to Bursa In 1717 he returned to Damascus and wrote 12 more books In 1720 he returned to √úsk√ºdar, the Anatolian part of Istanbul, where he began teaching again. However he was twice attacked by fanatical mobs and decided to return to Bursa. In 1722, at Bursa he bequeathed his books to public libraries, left all his money for the construction of a small mosque, and entered into retreat. That mosque is now within the Ismail Hakki Kur‚Äôan Kursu. In July 1724 or 1725 he died in serenity. His tomb is at the rear of the same mosque. Major works ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± was one of the most prolific Ottoman scholars, with 106 books and pamphlets: 46 in Arabic. and 60 in Turkish To this day he is revered as an eminent literary figure in the Turkish language. He wrote on Islamic sciences, Sufism, Tasawuf, Islamic philosophy, morality and tefsir in a style avoiding the flowery style of many contemporaries, resembling the style of Yunus Emre. The most famous of his published works are: *R≈´·∏• al-bayƒÅn (the Spirit of Elucidation), a voluminous esoteric interpretation of the Quran, combining the ideas of the author, Ibn Arabi and Al-Ghazali, written in a Persian poetic form.

The plaque on his tomb says: Footnote Although Yahya Michot controversially claims that \\"Ahmad's Sharia\\" on the plaque on the tomb refers to the Anatolian reformer Ahmad al-Rumi al-Aqhisari (d. 1632), who confident in the ability of the sharia to bring about a just order, called \\"for its implementation as a way to curb the despotism and injustice of sultans and qadis. A barrier against tyranny...\\" the term refers to the divine law of Prophet Muhammad, also referred to as Ahmad in the Quran and in some Muslim literature, as agreed upon by the majority of Islamic scholars.

It is three bays wide and three bays deep and has rectangular turrets at each corner. After the war the school was run by Colonel White and then General Raleigh E. Colston. The curriculum was revised in 1867 to include civil courses. The North Carolina state legislature changed the name to the North Carolina Military and Polytechnic Academy and established a program in which eight students could attend the school free of charge in return for two years of teaching in the state. This last reincarnation of the Military Academy was a failure and General Colston relocated to Wilmington, North Carolina in 1868. In 1872 Paul C. Cameron purchased the Academy buildings and in 1874 convinced James H. Horner of the Horner School and Ralph H. Graves of the Graves School in Oxford, North Carolina to \\"remove to the Military Academy buildings\\". The new school also failed two years later due to the illness of Horner and the death of Graves. The Cameron family sold the property to the Farmers‚Äô Alliance in 1895 and it was sold to a developer in 1919.

He was elected Imam in 1728, holding power in the interior of Oman while his cousin, Saif bin Sultan II, held power on the coast. In 1737, he renounced his claim after being defeated by Saif's Persian allies. He was again elected Imam in 1743 during another Persian invasion, and again held power in the interior while Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi was recognized as ruler by the coastal people. He died in battle against Ahmad bin Said in 1749, who shortly after became the undisputed ruler of the country. Struggle with Saif bin Sultan II In 1724 the Imam Saif bin Sultan II was deposed by Muhammad bin Nasir, who was elected Imam on 2 October 1724. His rival, Khalf bin Mubarak, stirred up trouble among the northern tribes. In an engagement at Sohar in 1728 both Khalf bin Mubarak and Muhammad bin Nasir were killed. The garrison of Sohar recognized Saif bin Sultan II as Imam, and he was re- installed at Nizwa. However, some of the inhabitants of Az Zahirah elected Saif's cousin Bal'arab bin Himyar as Imam. A prolonged struggle began in which Saif was unable to overcome Bal'arab bin Himyar. He sent his brother, Bal'arab bin Sultan, to assist the Beni Ruwaihah, whom Bal'arab bin Himyar was fighting. The outcome was a defeat for the Beni Ruwaihah, who now recognized Bal'arab bin Himyar. Bal'arab bin Himyar returned to Nizwa, and began operations to subdue the surrounding district. He took Belad Sait and then Bahila. After this, the rival Imams remained armed but avoided hostilities for a few years. Belarab had the support of the Ghafiri faction and controlled most of the interior, and gradually gained the ascendancy on land. However, although Saif was only supported by the Beni Hina and a few allied tribes, he had the navy and the main seaports of Muscat, Burka and Sohar. The stand-off had disastrous economic consequences. Around 1736 Saif engaged a company of Balochis armed with muskets, and sent them under the leadership of his brother Bal'arab bin Sultan, but they were decisively defeated by Bal'arab bin Himyar. In desperation, Saif bin Sultan asked for help from Nader Shah of Persia. The Persians arrived in March 1737. Saif bin Sultan joined the Persians. They marched to Az Zahirah where they met and routed the forces of Bal'arab bin Himyar. Bal'arab bin Himyar hastened back to Nizwa and improved the defenses. The Persians continued their advance into the interior, capturing towns, killing, looting and taking slaves. Saif fell out with the Persians and made his way to Muscat. The Persians completed their campaign and reembarked for Persia, taking their loot with them. Struggle with the Persians After his defeat in 1737, Bal'arab bin Himyar agreed to renounce his claim to be Imam. For a few years Saif bin Sultan was undisputed ruler, although the tribes did not give him wholehearted support. Saif bin Sultan led a self-indulgent life, which turned the tribes against him. In February 1742 another rival Imam from the Yaruba family was proclaimed, Sultan bin Murshid bin Jadi, a grandson of the great Imam Saif bin Sultan. Sultan bin Murshid was installed at Nakhal and began to hound Saif bin Sultan, who again appealed to the Persians for help and promised to cede Sohar to them. Fresh from a victorious campaign in India, Nader Shah dispatched an expedition of 6,000 men under Mirza Mohammed Taki Khan, which arrived at Julfar around October 1742. The Persians besieged Sohar and also sent forces to Muscat, but were unable to take either place. In 1743 Saif was tricked into delivering the last forts in Muscat while drunk at a banquet, and died soon after. The Persians took Muscat and again attacked Sohar to the north. The Imam Sultan bin Murshid was mortally wounded under the walls of Sohar in mid-1743. Bal'arab bin Himyar was elected Imam in his place. However, he was jealous of the popular governor of Sohar, Ahmad bin Said al- Busaidi, and did not provide military support. After enduring nine months of siege in Sohar, Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi negotiated an honorable surrender and was confirmed as governor of Sohar and Barka in return for payment of tribute. In 1744 he was elected Imam. The Persian forces dwindled through desertions. In 1747 Ahmad invited the remaining Persian garrison to a banquet at his fort in Barka, where he massacred them. Final struggle with Ahmad bin Said After Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi had driven the Persians from Oman the tribes of the Hinawi faction recognized him as Imam, as did some of the Ghafiri tribes. Bal'arab bin Himyar retained the support of some of the Ghafiri of Dhahireh and the Semail. Bal'arab bin Himyar raised a strong force and advanced on Muscat, but was unable to take that town. He then attempted to take Sohar. Ahmad went to support the defence, but was deserted by his troops at the Battle of Bitnah around the start of 1745 and forced to flee. For several years Bal'arab bin Himyar was recognized as the true Imam, fully controlling the interior, while Ahmed remained on the coast. In 1749 Ahmad gathered an army and moved against Bal'arab, who was encamped near Jebel Akhdar with inferior forces. In the final battle, in the second half of 1749, Bal'arab was defeated and killed. This was the end of Yaruba power. The war- weary tribes united under Ahmad bin Sa'id.

Sent by the Umayyad governor of Khurasan, an Arab relief force under al-Musayyab ibn Bishr al-Riyahi managed to break the siege and escort the garrison to safety in Samarkand. The siege marked the beginning of the T√ºrgesh invasion of Transoxiana, which the Arabs had only recently subdued, and which became a battleground between the two empires for the following two decades.  Background  The region of Transoxiana had been conquered by the Umayyad leader Qutayba ibn Muslim in the reign of al-Walid I (), following the Muslim conquests of Persia and Khurasan in the mid-7th century. The loyalties of Transoxiana's native Iranian and Turkic populations and those of autonomous local rulers remained questionable, however, as demonstrated in 719, when the Transoxianian princes sent a petition to the Chinese and their T√ºrgesh vassals for military aid against the Caliphate's governors. The situation was made worse by the incompetence of the Arab governor Abd al-Rahman ibn Nu'aym. His successor Sa'id, who took office in 720, was not much better: he had no experience of the province and his unwarlike nature earned him the mocking sobriquet \\"Khudhnaynah\\", \\"the Flirt\\" from the Khurasanis. Sa'id appointed the capable Shu'bah ibn Zuhayr al-Nahshali as his deputy in Samarkand, but after the locals rioted, he was dismissed and replaced by Uthman ibn Abdallah ibn Mutarrif ibn al-Shikhkhir, perhaps, as H. A. R. Gibb writes, \\"in a vain attempt to appease the insurgents\\".  Siege and relief of Qasr al-Bahili  The weakness of the Arab administration, and the petitions of the Transoxianian princes, led the T√ºrgesh ruler, the khagan Suluk, to launch an attack, which caught the Arabs entirely off guard. Under the leadership of Kursul, the T√ºrgesh were able to surround the fortress of Qasr al-Bahili (\\"Fort of the Bahila\\"), whose garrison numbered 100 families, according to the report of al-Tabari. Fearing that reinforcements from Samarkand would not arrive in time, the garrison of Qasr al-Bahili proposed to buy peace for 40,000 silver dirhams, as well as giving seventeen of their own men as hostages to Kursul until the tribute was paid. When the Arab governor of Samarkand, Uthman ibn Abdallah ibn Mutarrif ibn al-Shikhkhir, learned of the T√ºrgesh attack, he called for volunteers from the Arab settlers of Khurasan. 4,000 men from all the Arab tribes present in Khurasan presented themselves, but according to al-Tabari, when the appointed commander, al-Musayyab ibn Bishr, warned them that they were about to enter \\"the arena of the Turks, the arena of the khagan\\", where they faced death and martyrdom, 1,300 left. After he had marched a farsakh ( km), he repeated his exhortation for only the steadfast to remain with him, and another thousand left, and again the same after another farsakh, leaving him with barely 700 men. During the march, the Arabs were met by a local ruler, the king of Qiyy, who informed them of events at Qasr al-Bahili, and added that Kursul, having learned of the Arabs' approach, had slain his hostages. The king of Qiyy also warned the Arabs that all the Iranian aristocracy (dehqans) of the area had gone over to the T√ºrgesh, and offered 300 of his own men to assist them. When he was two farsakhs from the fort, al-Musayyab sent two riders, one Arab and one non- Arab, to approach the fort and scout out the situation under cover of night. Although the T√ºrgesh had flooded the area around the castle to obstruct access, they managed to make contact with the garrison and inform them of the Arab army's approach, before returning to al-Musayyab. When his spies informed him of the situation, al-Musayyab decided to march immediately, and attack the T√ºrgesh under cover of night. He instructed his men to muzzle their horses until the attack, and to focus on breaking the enemy resistance, rather than pursue anyone fleeing the battle. With the break of dawn, the Arabs, who had approached within two bowshots of the T√ºrgesh camp, issued the cry \\"Allahu Akbar\\", and charged. The Arabs penetrated deep into the T√ºrgesh encampment, but the latter recovered quickly and pushed the attack back. The Arabs withdrew around their commander, with many dismounting to fight; they suffered numerous casualties in the process. According to an eyewitness who was in the fortress, \\"when the two armies engaged in battle, we thought that the Day of Resurrection had arrived on account of what we heard, namely, the groans emitted by the soldiers, the clashing of iron, and the neighing of the horses.\\" In the end the Arabs prevailed, although the sources cited by al- Tabari mention no details. Al-Musayyab instructed his men to move straight for the fortress and help evacuate its garrison, and \\"not carry off any goods, except money, and do not carry off anyone who can walk\\", but only the women, children, and weak of body. Together, the Arabs made for Samarkand, so that when the T√ºrgesh returned the next day, they found nothing but the corpses of their fallen. Aftermath The relief of the fortress was celebrated and retold in story and song, but it also revealed the precarious situation the Muslims now faced. These events prompted the Umayyads to appoint the capable general Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi as governor of Khurasan. Al-Harashi quickly seized the initiative, defeated the rebels at Samarkand, and proceeded to restore Muslim rule almost to what it had been during the time of Qutayba, except for the Ferghana Valley, effective control over which was lost. Nevertheless, in 724 al-Harashi's successor Muslim ibn Sa'id al-Kilabi and his army suffered a heavy defeat (the so-called \\"Day of Thirst\\") at the hands of the T√ºrgesh when he tried to subdue Ferghana. This defeat pushed the Arabs on the defensive, and even though no pitched battles took place, over the next few years the Arab position in Transoxiana collapsed swiftly. Widespread dissatisfaction with the Arab rule resulted in a general uprising of Transoxiana in 728, and, with T√ºrgesh military aid, the Arabs were evicted from almost the entire region, even invading Khurasan itself in 737. Transoxiana thereafter remained contested, and the Arabs did not recover their previous position until the campaigns of the Umayyad governor Nasr ibn Sayyar in 739‚Äì741, who took advantage of the collapse of the T√ºrgesh khaganate into civil wars after Suluk's murder in 738.

Origins During 1960 the Scottish Bus Group faced Leyland Motors (who had absorbed Albion Motors in 1951) with a dilemma. They had bought around 180 double-decker buses a year over the past decade, from 1955 onward these had been mainly and then (post-1957) exclusively either Leyland Titans with lowbridge bodies or Bristol Lodekkas. Despite Leyland Motors promoting the Atlantean with very attractive discounts, the SBG refused it outright. They wanted Leyland to build a double-decker bus to an equivalent layout to the Lodekka FLF6G, with a low overall height and central gangways for the length of both decks, a front engine and an entrance just aft of the front wheel arch, Leyland's reported ¬£150 per bus discount on PDR1/1 Atlanteans would have made these chassis ¬£100 cheaper than the bus SBG bought in quantity, but the low-height PDR1/1 had four rows of seats to the rear upstairs in four-in a row seating with a nearside sunken gangway. SBG was yet to work rear-engined buses but were against the idea. Faced with the prospect of losing the SBG business to competitors AEC, Daimler or Guy, Leyland commissioned Albion Motors to develop a low-height front-engined double-decker bus using Leyland units, most of which already in production, the frame design was new as was the drop- centre rear axle but every other unit was made from production Leyland Motors parts. After the first four chassis were built at Scotstoun and development work was completed, the rest were assembled at Scotstoun from parts produced at Leyland. Mechanical features Four variants were coded and three produced, all had an wheelbase for a nominal bodied length of , with width of and a height of unladen. LR1 had a fluid coupling behind the engine and in front of the step-down gearbox, which joined to a drive shaft under the entry step, whilst on the nearside, aft of the front-entrance position, a four-speed Pneumocyclic semi-automatic transmission was fitted with drive then continued alongside the nearside frame-member to the driving head of the axle. The LR3 had a single-plate clutch and a four-speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on third and top. Both of these had rear semi-elliptic leaf springs; whilst the LR7 was as the LR3, but with rear air suspension designed to provide a constant height (nearly two inches (5 cm) lower than the unladen height of the steel-sprung examples) regardless of loading, an equivalent model with semi- automatic transmission and air suspension was coded LR5 but none were ordered. Albion gave all its forward-control models odd model numbers: no one was proposing a bonnet-type double decker in the UK in 1961. All Lowlanders featured a ‚ÄòPower-Plus‚Äô version of the Leyland O.600 diesel engine rated at 140 bhp at the same 2,000 rpm limit as the Titan‚Äôs 125 bhp; the Lowlander also featured as standard a dual-circuit air brake system, which latter did not appear on the Titan until 1968. However, from the front of the \\"St. Helen‚Äôs-style\\" glass-reinforced plastic bonnet assembly, to the aft spring- hanger for the front axle, the bus was closely derived from the Titan PD3A, with the driving position only marginally lower. The frame design allowed a step-less front entrance and a central sunken gangway on the lower deck: all lower saloon seats were on a higher level than the gangway to allow the transmission, fuel tanks and other ancillaries such as brake chambers and batteries to be sited. The cross-members, like the side-frames, were of complex shapes, a mixture of tubular, box-section and I-beam members being employed. Like the Lodekka FLF, bodywork was to be cantilevered from the frame aft of the rear axle. An unusual facet of the design, adapted to take steel- framed bodies from any open-market UK coachbuilder, was twin fuel tanks, offside mounted between third and fourth and fourth and fifth cross-members, and linked by a balance‚Äìpipe, with the fuel-filler attached to the forward tank. During the development programme Sir Henry Spurrier, chairman at the time of both Leyland Motors and Albion Motors, drove one of the prototypes and asked for a more progressive brake action. Customers Total production from 1961-7 was 274. One, 747 EUS (third chassis built and hence in Albion‚Äôs alphanumeric ten-vehicle chassis numbering 62100C), was the second LR1 and Albion Motors‚Äô demonstrator. The fourth chassis (62100D) which was the first LR7, was bought by Edinburgh Corporation in 1962 and stored until 1964 when it was sold via Albion to Western SMT who placed an order with Northern Counties to body it with their last batch of Lowlanders and it was thus delivered in 1965. Western took the two other Albion-constructed chassis (62100A and B); the first (LR1) as their TCS 151 (shown at the Glasgow Kelvin Hall Motor Show in 1961) and the second, UCS 659, which was the first LR3. Including these and the chassis bought from Edinburgh, Western were the largest Lowlander Customer taking 111 in total, second largest was Alexander (Midland) who had 44; 30 went to Central SMT, East Midland Motor Services based in Chesterfield took 18 and Luton Corporation and Ribble Motor Services both took 16, there were fourteen for Yorkshire Woollen District Traction Company, ten for Southend Corporation, seven for Alexander (Fife), five for the South Notts Bus Company and two for Alexander (Northern). Fifteen Lowlanders were ordered in 1962, but later cancelled, by Walsall Corporation. All Lowlanders for English operators were badged as Leylands, except for the very last one built,https://www.flickr.com/photos/7964319@N03/4703713489/ and all those for Scottish operators were badged as Albions. Two brochures were produced, both featuring artwork of Alexander's mock-up body on the cover and a Lowlander grille badge where the Leyland or Albion badges went on production bodies. That said East Midland's D162 (162 NVO) appeared at the 1962 Earl's Court Commercial Motor Show with an Albion grille badge, Leyland had previously frowned on the use of badge-engineering to gain stand space at shows, a practice used by arch rivals AEC during the 1950s; however the East Midland bus was on the Walter Alexander Coachbuilders stand. Also after 747 EUS had finished demonstrating it entered service with the Preston-area independent Bamber Bridge Motor Services and retained its Albion Grille badge. During its demonstration it spent long spells on loan to Glasgow Corporation Transport (fully one year) and Edinburgh Corporation Transport. Neither were likely customers for the Lowlander, having bought high-capacity single deckers (respectively 30 Leyland Royal Tiger Worldmaster and 100 Leyland Tiger Cub) from 1956 to 1961 for their height-restricted routes. Glasgow had previously announced a large order for Atlanteans and Edinburgh were mainly committed to Titans but dithering between body layouts, lengths and braking systems. It is interesting that Edinburgh ordered an example but perhaps it was not bodied because any coachbuilder would have had trouble providing adequate nearside visibility for the driver had it been fitted with the Leyland/BMMO full-width bonnet assembly standard at Edinburgh. With a full complement of badges a Lowlander, regardless to whom it was delivered, would have carried an enamelled Albion saltire shield on the flap concealing the radiator filler, either Leyland or Albion in stylised chrome-plated lettering across the fourth slat down on the radiator grille and a Lowlander badge in chrome finish and Leyland‚Äìstyle script, on the nearside at the foot of the grille panel, just by the nearside end of the registration number plate. Coachbuilders The Scottish Bus Group had mainly dual-sourced the bodies on their Leyland Titan PD2 and PD3 from Northern Counties Motor and Engineering Company of Wigan and Walter Alexander Coachbuilders of Falkirk and it was these two who would provide the bodies for SBG's Lowlanders. Western and Central took both firms' products whilst the Alexander companies took Alexander bodywork (the bus operations of Walter Alexander & Sons had been separated from the vehicle building activities prior to the nationalisation of the SMT group's bus operations to avoid the sales restrictions that afflicted Bristol Commercial Vehicles and Eastern Coach Works from 1948). Alexander also bodied the Southend batch, East Midland‚Äôs first twelve and both batches for Ribble: these were notable as the only Lowlanders to have fully fronted bodies, the GRP bonnet assembly built into the body and disguised at the front with a similar grille (with a Ribble legend rather than the badges of Leyland or Albion) to the fully fronted Titans Ribble had taken from 1958 to 1963. Access to the engine cover for maintenance was provided by a hinged door of the same shape as the driver's door, but with an additional kerb-viewing window. Only Ribble took Alexander bodies with hinged driver's doors, SBG, East Midland and Southend Corporation used inward-sliding driver's doors, as also used by Northern Counties and Metro Cammell Weymann. The other Northern Counties- bodied Lowlanders were those supplied to the South Notts Bus Company of Gotham, Nottinghamshire, who purchased one a year from 1963 to 1967. South Notts was since 1929 half-owned by the Dabell family and half by major independent bus & coach operator Barton Transport Ltd; Barton had taken Northern Counties bodies on its double deckers since 1957 and in 1960 South Notts had a Northern Counties lowbridge forward-entrance Titan PD3, similar to Barton's contemporary AEC Regents but without the full front and ‚Äòwrap around‚Äô curved windscreens and upper deck windows. Like this and contemporary Barton double deckers, the South Notts Lowlanders had a sliding, air-operated, single-piece entry door; the SBG‚Äôs Lowlanders all had folding four-leaf doors to the entrance. At the beginning of 1962 Dennis Brothers Ltd had announced that no further Dennis Loline orders would be accepted; the decision was rescinded later in the year but it cost Dennis a number of orders, among existing Loline customers perturbed by this was Luton Corporation. As a major railway junction with many prosperous employers in the area, including Vauxhall and Commer they had a requirement for double-deck buses able to get under low bridges and had begun to replace their early post-war Crossley DD42s, for which there were no new spare parts being made, with Leyland O.600-powered Lolines, two short wheelbase examples were delivered in 1960 and had 63 seat bodies by East Lancashire Coachbuilders of Blackburn. Thus Luton, looking for an O.600-powered lowheight double-decker placed an order for sixteen LR7 Lowlanders, these were the same 28 ft 10in length as the previous Lolines but as Leyland did not offer a choice of wheelbase, they had 65-seat East Lancashire bodies (10) or bodies on East Lancs frames finished by their associate in the John Brown Engineering group, Neepsend Coachworks of Sheffield (6). These featured a short tail and were delivered from June‚ÄìDecember 1963 in ones and twos. The first six examples took registrations 165-70EMJ booked for Lolines Luton were forced to cancel. It was 1964 when the fifth coachbuilder bodied a Lowlander, this was Weymann (1928) Ltd of Addlestone, Surrey, who were part of the Metro-Cammell Weymann sales organisation in partnership with Metro-Cammell of Birmingham, MCW had a strong relationship with the British Electric Traction group and did not like the sales incursions by Walter Alexander into their patch, so they offered a better tender price for bodies on Lowlanders for Yorkshire Woollen District Traction Company Ltd, based in the West Riding town of Dewsbury. These became YWD‚Äôs 926-39 (KHD400-13) and were the first and last Weymann-bodied Lowlanders as following prolonged industrial action and a fire at the factory, Metro- Cammell‚Äôs owners Laird Group bought out the Weymann shareholders and closed down the Surrey facility. Subsequently Metro-Cammell built East Midland Motor Services' last four Lowlanders to a similar outline in 1966, these were D183-6 (GNN183-6D): only one more Lowlander was built, the last for South Notts. Walsall's abortive order was also to have been bodied by the MCW group. In service To start with, all but tall drivers liked the Lowlander, because it was more powerful than the buses it replaced and unlike the vacuum-braked Titan, stopping within a safe distance was a certainty rather than a hope. For conductors, although it was better than a side-gangway design, it was worse than the contemporary flat-floor Lodekka as the passenger gangway on the lower deck was narrow and deeply sunken, with odd excrescences to catch unpractised feet: also unlike the Eastern Coach Works body designed to integrate with the FLF there was not an easy refuge area to stand in to allow passengers on and off at stops. For mechanics, especially those brought up on the Titan, it was a curse, sometimes even inspiring them to violence: every part was hard to get to, and much dismantling of coachwork was necessary even for routine servicing of some components. As time went by, management discovered brake and gearbox wear figures were much worse than on Titans and although bodied weight was about identical, fuel consumption was also worse, these weaknesses were particularly prominent on the LR1 variant which was chosen for most SBG orders; it was the first semi-automatic bus they had bought and not only was it less tolerant of driver abuse, drivers also had to get used to the fact that there was no longer the engine-braking effect available with a \\"solid\\" transmission. The Alexander body also had problems, the prototypes used a standard Alexander upper-deck structure with a deeply-domed roof and low-set windows as on Glasgow Titans and AEC Regent Vs and recent Dennis Lolines for Aldershot & District Traction Company and North Western Road Car Company; this left no space for most operators' standard front destination displays, and required both pairs of front upper-deck seats to be mounted on raised platforms; All Lowlanders had the offside front seats above the cab raised to give the driver a modicum of headroom. UCS659 and subsequent Alexander bodies had a modified design with a lower floor line to the nearside over the engine and the front upper deck windows mounted at a higher level than those at the sides of the body. Ribble Motor Services, the third owner of demonstrator 747EUS, rebuilt it to a similar layout, although it retained its half-cab and Albion badge. TCS151 remained in original condition until the end of its service with Highland. All forward entrance half-cab buses had structural weaknesses and these showed up on most Lowlanders, panel drumming, entry-doors sticking, stanchions rattling ‚Äì sometimes even falling out, rainwater ingress causing electrical faults with the lights and bells and larger roof leaks particularly from the joint aft of the front dome all being symptoms. Central and Western started replacing their Lowlanders after three years in service, these being transferred to Alexander (Fife), Alexander (Northern) and Highland Omnibuses. By 1967 Central had no Lowlanders and by 1974 Highland operated more of the type than anybody else. Southend faced the body structure and engineering weaknesses by using the type increasingly on peak-hour duplication, rail-replacement work and lightly loaded runs into rural Thames- side territory notably route 4B to Great Wakering and route 18 to Ministry of Defence -controlled Foulness Island; for this purpose Southend uniquely fitted their Lowlanders by 1970 for driver-only operation, for which the driver had to turn to the left inside the cab to collect fares. Luton Corporation, like Central SMT, found its mechanics constantly leaving for better paid and more congenial work elsewhere, and prior to selling out to United Counties Omnibus Company in 1970 the fleet had an increasingly shabby and neglected appearance; neglect made Luton's Lowlanders' rear air-suspension a particular cause of trouble, which in turn led to chassis-frame and coachwork problems. The first to be withdrawn was 169 (169EMJ) in July 1970; it was gradually dismantled over the next two years. With the New Bus Grant (and cascaded Bristol Lodekkas) enabling accelerated replacement and United Counties having inherited few spare parts from Luton Corporation the rest of the former Luton Corporation Lowlanders left Luton by October 1972. 171HTM was also dismantled by UCOC between November 1972 and March 1973. UCOC did convert some of the Luton Lowlanders to either rear steel-coil suspension or rear steel-leaf (in effect converting them to LR3‚Äôs). The last former Luton Lowlanders ran for United Counties by January 1974. In the secondhand market the mechanically fit examples were widely dispersed, including one passing to Highland Omnibuses. Two were in the fleet of Godfrey Abbott Group Coaches of Sale, Greater Manchester when it was purchased by Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive, these were the only Lowlanders ever to be owned by a PTE. Swiftly sold on by this standardisation-minded operator 165EMJ went to Crawford of Neilston and then Silver Fox Coaches of Glasgow who withdrew it in 1980. Luton 177 (177HTM) was the last of this unloved cohort to survive, being withdrawn by Avro Coaches of Romford Essex in August 1982. East Midland, on the other hand, chose manual Lowlanders (having previously bought lowbridge Atlanteans) because the engine-braking available suited some of their hillier routes in the Peak District, notably route 4 (Chesterfield-Doncaster) and route 17 (Chesterfield-Matlock) and the only modifications over a full service life of around 15 years were the removal of illuminated advertising displays from the first batch and the panelling over of the lower set of apertures in the radiator grille, as the engine was originally over-cooled in the upland climate in which their examples operated. After the fleet merged with Mansfield District, one was transferred there but was not popular because of its lack of cab headroom and heavy controls. It was even sent to Lincolnshire Road Car's Scunthorpe depot when they had a vehicle shortage, but it was swiftly returned to Mansfield. Yorkshire Woollen were fond of their Lowlanders, although drivers nicknamed them \\"Scrum-Half\\" buses, the point being that they were best driven by small drivers with long arms. Although the Lowlander was a specialist low height bus they were used fairly indiscriminately, often turn and turnabout with Leyland Titan PD3s. The Alexander companies got on with their Lowlanders, and Midland, in particular, may have felt a sense of obligation, as many of their services distributed Albion workers to Clydebank and Glasgow‚Äôs northern and north-eastern suburbs from a stand on Scotstoun‚Äôs Dumbarton Road. Highland made good use of their cascaded fleet of Lowlanders, mainly on scholars‚Äô contracts and work involved in the Dounreay Fast-Breeder Nuclear Reactor complex. Their AL45 was new to Luton as its 166 (166EMJ). In retrospect The Lowlander was a type Leyland did not really want to build and it never attained the sales forecast for it, which should have reached over 450 rather than 274 by 1967. By 1966 SBG had decided that they could live with a rear‚Äìengined double decker in the form of the Daimler Fleetline, taking 640 from 1963 to 1980. Aside from the over- produced frame components (most of those not newly built into chassis went for scrap, although Luton had to take some side-members as spares because neglect of the rear suspension on some of their buses caused frame-cracking) the only unique assembly was the rear axle, and with some revisions to the layout of components that became a key part of the low-height Atlanteans, types PDR1/2 and PDR1/3 built from 1964 to 1971. The Lowlander was the last Albion-designed double-decker, and the penultimate Albion design of bus for UK operation. Albion, as Albion Automotive, a specialist in axle assemblies and other automotive components, continue to manufacture in part of the Scotstoun site they first occupied in 1901. Leyland and the Scottish Bus Group have both vanished due to political decisions about which industries should be Government-supported. Ten Lowlanders are preserved whilst some survive outside the UK on tourist or publicity work. Britbus make a 1:76 scale model of the Alexander-bodied version.

After studying law, he served as attorney, diplomat and state legislator. He was an officer in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, the wounds received in it complicating his later life. McRae was also a newspaper editor. Early life and education McRae was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, the son of John McRae (1793‚Äì1880), Fayetteville's postmaster in the 1840s and 1850s. In 1825 the five-years old Duncan held the welcome speech at the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette. He attended the University of Virginia, located in Charlottesville, and the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg. Back in North Carolina he studied law under Judge Robert Strange, was admitted to the bar in 1841 and briefly practiced in Oxford before becoming a courier to Mexico for the State Department.Martin Reidinger. McRae, Duncan Kirkland. From Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, University of North Carolina Press. Political career In 1842 young McRae was elected into the North Carolina House of Commons as Democratic representative for his native Cumberland County; serving a single term until 1843.Jeffrey, Thomas E. State Parties and National Politics: North Carolina, 1815‚Äì1861. pp. 264, 381. Then he became a U.S. District Attorney, gaining a reputation as sharp lawmen and outstanding speaker. Partnering with Perrin Busbee he founded a short-lived newspaper, the Democratic Signal, in 1843. It was based in Raleigh, where he had moved to. He resigned in 1850 and moved to Wilmington the next year. McRae served as Consul to Paris with the U.S. Ambassador to France during the administration of U.S. President Franklin Pierce from 1853 to 1857; he then relocated to New Bern. In 1858 he became a candidate for the governorship of North Carolina. He left the Democratic Party and gained support from remnants of the Whig Party, but was criticized for his changing political positions.Wynstra, Robert J. The Rashness of That Hour: Politics, Gettysburg, and the Downfall of Confederate Brigadier General Alfred Iverson. New York: Savas Beatie, 2010. He became an Independent Democrat campaigning as the Land Distribution Democratic nominee, calling for public lands given by North Carolina to the federal government in 1790 to be sold and the money granted to North Carolina. He lost his candidacy to John Willis Ellis by a wide margin. Civil War When the American Civil War began Governor Ellis, shortly before he died in office, appointed McRae as commanding officer of the 5th North Carolina Infantry Regiment with the rank of Colonel in the Confederate States Army. During July the regiment was sent northwards to join the Army of the Potomac and was assigned to the brigade of Brig.Gen. James Longstreet. It participated in the First Battle of Manassas though McRae was absent ill. He commanded his regiment, now in the brigade of Jubal Early, during the Peninsula Campaign and fought in the Battle of Williamsburg. There he was wounded while leading a charge against troops under Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock. As the wound was only minor he stayed on the field and temporarily took command of the brigade when Gen. Early was wounded; later relinquishing command to Samuel Garland, Jr.. McRae fought in the Seven Days Battles but afterwards sickness and complications from his wound forced him leave his unit again. Colonel McRae was able to return in time to command his regiment during the Maryland Campaign. He took over the brigade again after the death of Samuel Garland, Jr. at South Mountain,Clark, Walter. Histories of the Several Regiments and Battalions from North Carolina, in the Great War 1861-1865. Raleigh: E.M. Uzzell, Printer and Binder. 1901, p. 286. leading it into the maelstrom of the Battle of Antietam where it nearly perished. McRae himself was badly wounded but again stayed with his command until after the battle when he was hospitalized. When the recuperating colonel was passed over for promotion, the later going to Alfred Iverson Jr., he resigned his commission; effective on November 13, 1862. McRae wrote letters describing the actions of the Maryland Campaign that survived as of today. In particular, he noted that at the Battle of South Mountain he was able to keep Garland's brigade fighting for two more hours after Samuel Garland death.Carman, Ezra A, and Joseph Pierro. The Maryland Campaign of September 1862: Ezra A. Carman's Definitive Study of the Union and Confederate Armies at Antietam. New York: Routledge, 2008. At Antietam, he admitted that, \\"the unaccountable panic occurred, when I was left along on the field, with only Capatin Withers of Caswell and perhaps one other officer, and I had just gotten off, when I encountered ... General Lee, and it was while, with him I was trying to get some men out of the Hay Stacks that a piece of shell struck me in the forehead.\\" In 1863 the new Governor of North Carolina, Zebulon B. Vance, appointed McRae a special envoy and purchase agent; sending him to southern Europe to find a market for cotton and to procure supplies. After his return, and a failed run for the Confederate Congress, McRae found another Raleigh-based newspaper, The Confederate. Later life When the war ended McRae moved to Memphis, Tennessee, practiced law as partner of McRae & Sneed and published a law journal. After 14 years in Tennessee he moved back to Wilmington. In 1880 McRae gave a speech in favor of Winfield S. Hancock, his former adversary during the Battle of Williamsburg, when Hancock was running for the U.S. presidency.Raleigh News and Observer. September 19, 1880. He became a bitter critic of the Civil War, though in private, writing on August 21, 1885 to D.H. Hill, who queried him on the battles of the past: McRae's frail health and reappearing complications from his war wounds made him relocate - first to Chicago, then to New York City. He died in Brooklyn on February 12, 1888, and was buried on Woodlawn Cemetery. Family McRae married Louise Virginia Henry, the daughter of Judge Louis D. Henry of Raleigh, on October 8, 1845. They had three daughters; Margaret Kirkland, Virginia Henry, and Marie.

Reinforced natural grass can also be used for events and concerts. The synthetic fibres incorporated into the rootzone make the grass stronger and more resistant to damage. A first generation of hybrid grass appeared in the 1990s. Grass roots were allowed to intertwine with a mix of sand and synthetic fibres as they grew. Three main methods exist to insert synthetic fibres in the root zone. The first is to inject fibres in the sand with a tufting machine. Sunday, July 19, 2020 The second method is to mix fibres, cork and sand in an automated plant and to install it afterwards on the pitch. It is the most used hybrid system in France, the system has been created with a public laboratory of biomechanics https://www.instituts-carnot.eu/fr/actualite/airfibr-1ere- technologie-de-pelouse-sportive-augmentee-pour-la-securite-et-la https://business.lesechos.fr/entrepreneurs/idees-de-business/natural-grass- equipe-la-moitie-des-terrains-de-football-de-l-euro-2016-211897.php https://www.stiga.com/fr/magazine/tendances-et-conseils/pelouse-hybride- pelouse-futur The third method is to put a carpet/mat with woven or tufted fibres on the surface, to brush in sand or sand mixes afterwards to keep the fibres in an upright position and to seed grass mixtures finally. The natural grass roots through the mat and stabilizes the system. These systems are called carpet based hybrid grass Solutions. The most innovative technology is patented by FLexGrass and is called Horizon, it's the only system on the market 100% recyclable. There are multiple patented technologies that concern hybrid grass, such as the following examples: SISGrass, developed by SIS Pitches, Vertix by FLexGrass.

They are never off the rack, so to speak. It‚Äôs about the awkward situations they‚Äôre in and how they deal with them. It‚Äôs got a lot of heart, but it can be quite dark.

When you‚Äôre working with loads of departments ‚Äì writers, directors, producers and so on ‚Äì it can get diluted very quickly. This way you can create things on the spot and mould them as you go, rather than working through the layers.\\" Bergin agrees \\"It‚Äôs very rare that there aren‚Äôt obstacles, but it didn‚Äôt feel like a hard road because in the beginning we were just playing around to see if we could bring our ideas to fruition. Our comfort in performing together definitely helped during that phase; the way things are done sometimes, if there had been more people involved the idea would have been pulled apart before it was fully formed but we were able to take our time and bring these couples to life. It‚Äôs great to have that dynamic, and be able to gauge what the other person is doing and where they want to go with an idea.\\"Whelan, Doug (March 2013) \\"Pulling the curtain back\\" TV Now  Reception  Writing in The Irish Times Bernice Harrison said \\"New Irish comedy.

Each story is rich with blackly comic potential. The acting is spot on, especially from Bergin, who is a terrific character actor, and the writing is subtle enough that by the end of the first episode the dynamics between the couples have shifted ‚Äì and look set to shift again next week. You mightn‚Äôt recognise everything in all the characters, but they seem very real all the same.\\"Harrison, Bernice (16 February 2013) \\"Lots of laughs on the couch\\" In The Sunday Times Liam Fay describes the series as \\"a gleefully bitchy two-hander. The dialogue is studded with elaborate social detail but the performances steal the show: one character‚Äôs reaction is just as important as the lines delivered by the other. All six characters seethe with disapproval of their other halves. However, they become inflamed with even greater rage whenever they recall a third party‚Äôs criticism of their choice of mate. Here, Bergin and Cooke succeed in mining comedic gold from an often over-looked universal truth: people take proprietorial pride in their partners, even those they wish would become ex-partners. To admit that a spouse is a dud is publicly to admit wasting time and a shameful lapse in judgement. There is no more painful property trap than the one for which you fell with your eyes wide open.\\".Fay, Liam (14 April 2013) Sunday Times In the RT√â Guide Michael Doherty described the series as \\"observational humour of the highest quality\\",Doherty, Michael (9 March 2013) RT√â Guide while Pat Stacey in The Evening Herald called it \\"a very satisfying maiden voyage into uncharted and, in terms of Irish television's track record, notoriously treacherous waters for the commercial channel.

The bill is intended to \\"make good on President Obama's promise that 'if you like your health plan, you can keep it.'\\" It was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Obama Administration announced on November 12, 2013, that in October 2013 only 27,000 people had been able to use HealthCare.gov to purchase insurance from the federal government. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013 would permit a health insurance issuer that has in effect health insurance coverage in the individual market as of January 1, 2013, to continue offering such coverage for sale during 2014 outside of a health care exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The bill would treat such coverage as a grandfathered health plan for purposes of an individual meeting the requirement to maintain minimum essential health coverage. Procedural history The Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on October 28, 2013 by Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. On November 8, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013 would be considered during the week of November 11, 2013. The House was scheduled to vote on it on November 15, 2013. On November 15, the House passed the bill 261-157, with 39 Democrats voting with the Republicans in favor of it. Debate and discussion Rep. Martha Roby spoke in favor of the bill and urged other members of the House to vote in favor of it. Opponents argue that the bill would make the situation worse by increasing the complications of Obamacare implementation. The actions that prompted this bill ‚Äì cancellation of existing insurance plans ‚Äì have already occurred. People have been notified, computer systems have changed, and these now-cancelled plans have not been refiled with the regulatory agencies of the various states. Opponents argue that this situation makes it difficult or impossible for insurance companies to undo the policy cancellations made in preparation for Obamacare. Subsequent criticism President Obama's promise and the subsequent legislation aimed to allow American citizens to keep their healthcare plan were widely seen as promises that could not be kept. Obama's statement \\"if you like your healthcare plan you can keep it...\\" was later dubbed \\"Lie of the Year\\" by PolitiFact.com.Lie of the Year. The Huffington Post.

The law authorizes funding for approximately 55 eligible hospitals across 30 different states. The Children‚Äôs Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2013 became law during the 113th United States Congress. H.R. 297, a different bill with the same name and similar provisions, passed the House of Representatives in February 2013 but did not make progress in the Senate. Background According to a report about a similar reauthorization bill in the House, \\"the Children‚Äôs Hospital Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) program was first enacted in 1999 as part of the Healthcare Research and Quality Act () to provide freestanding children's hospitals with discretionary Federal support for direct and indirect expenses associated with operating medical residency training programs.\\" The same report indicates that \\"freestanding children‚Äôs hospitals train over 40% of pediatricians, 43% of pediatric specialists, and most pediatric researchers.\\" In FY 2011, two children's hospitals in Pennsylvania received $32 million under this program. The CHGME program‚Äôs appropriations are authorized through FY2018. The President‚Äôs budget for FY2019 proposes to eliminate funding for this program; instead, it proposes that CHGME funds be combined with other sources of GME support, which would require new legislation. Provisions of the bill Overall, the bill reauthorizes an older law that funds medical education programs at children's hospitals. This bill would reauthorize the program until 2018, unlike the House version which would only reauthorize it until 2017. The bill would increase the available spots for pediatricians. It would also \\"extend funding to teaching programs at children‚Äôs psychiatric hospitals.\\" Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on October 30, 2013. This is a public domain source. S. 1557 would amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize payments to children's hospitals for operating training programs that provide graduate medical education. Payments would be made to such hospitals for both direct and indirect costs related to graduate medical education. Direct costs are those related to operating a medical education program, such as the salaries of medical students, while indirect costs are those intended to compensate hospitals for patient care costs that are expected to be higher in teaching hospitals than in non- teaching hospitals. S. 1557 would authorize the appropriation of $300 million a year for each of fiscal years 2014 through 2018 for payments to children‚Äôs hospitals. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the bill would cost about $1.4 billion over the 2014-2018 period, assuming the appropriation of the authorized amounts. Pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply to this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues. The bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.
