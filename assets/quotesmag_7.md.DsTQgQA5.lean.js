He is also known by his court title, Tango no kami (‰∏πÂæåÂÆà). Takenaka Shigekata was born in 1828 in the town of Iwate, in Mino Province, the son of Tokugawa retainer Takenaka Motoyuki. Motoyuki, though the head of a branch house, was a descendant of the great Sengoku-era strategist Takenaka Hanbei Shigeharu. Following his father's death, Shigekata was adopted by Takenaka Shigeakira, the 5000 koku hatamoto who was head of the main Takenaka house. Though a senior hatamoto due to his rank, he entered the ranks of the Greater Guardsmen (≈åbangumi; Â§ßÂæ°Áï™ÁµÑ) in 1864. He later became an Army Magistrate, and took part in the campaign that put down the Tengu Party. He also concurrently held the rank of wakadoshiyori. In 1868, Takenaka was part of the force headed for the Fushimi bugy≈çsho, but was beaten back by the new Imperial Army. Returning to Edo as part of the Tokugawa withdrawal, he was singled out as a scapegoat for the defeat, and was stripped of his court rank and title, and prohibited from entering Edo Castle. Though he briefly entered the priesthood, he still wanted to fight the Imperial army, and so he formed the Junch≈´tai (Á¥îÂø†Èöä). He initially had tactical coordination with the Shogitai, but following the defeat at the Battle of Ueno, he led the unit northward (together with former roju Ogasawara Nagamichi and his men), engaging in guerilla warfare as he moved farther into Mutsu Province. Joining Enomoto Takeaki's fleet in Sendai, he traveled to Hokkaido, where he became a Judge Advocate General officer in the new Ezo Republic. Just before the end of the Battle of Hakodate, he headed to Tokyo on a foreign steamship, ostensibly to find some unexplored option for fighting the Imperial Army; however, as he no longer had any solutions, he heeded his father Shigeakira's advice and surrendered. As punishment he forfeited his holdings, and was placed under the supervision of the Fukuoka domain. Later transferred to the guardianship of his father, he followed the latter to Hokkaido, where they settled. Moved by the plight of the impoverished former samurai there, Takenaka submitted a memorandum to the new government on the increase of agricultural productivity in Hokkaido. This reached the right ears, and he was pardoned in 1873, being allowed to return to Tokyo and work in the new government. However, in 1875, he left that post, and worked in the Hoeisha Company that his younger brother Motoyori had started, furthering the cause of increased productivity in Hokkaido. Takenaka died in 1891 at the age of 63, and is buried Takanawa- Sengakuji Temple. Sources Meiji Ishin Jinmei Jiten. Nihon Rekishi-gakkai, ed. Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kobunkan, 1981, n.p.

At Cambridge, it is called a combination room. This terminology has, in addition, been taken up in some universities in other English-speaking nations. The terms JCR, MCR, and SCR are used by Harvard University, Yale University, Princeton University, and the University of Toronto. These groups exist to represent their members in the organisation of college or residential hall life, to operate certain services within these institutions such as laundry or recreation, and to provide opportunities for socialising. There are variations based on institutional tradition and needs, but typically the following common rooms will exist in a college or hall: * A junior common room (JCR) ‚Äì for undergraduate junior members * A middle common room (MCR) ‚Äì for graduate junior members * A senior common room (SCR) ‚Äì for senior members (fellows, etc.). In addition to this, each of the above terms may also refer to an actual common room designated for the use of these groups. At the University of Cambridge, the term combination room (e.g., \\"junior combination room\\") is also used, with the same abbreviations. As a generalisation, JCRs are associations of undergraduates and SCRs an association of tutors and academics associated with a college. Postgraduates are sometimes given their own MCR, or placed in with either of the other groups.  Examples  The terms JCR, MCR and SCR originated from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. The terms are now used at ten British universities as well as Trinity College, Dublin in Ireland, Harvard College in the United States of America and at the University of Trinity College in the University of Toronto, Canada. Due to the way that the terms have evolved over time and the idiosyncratic nature of university structure, the use of the three terms varies considerably from institution to institution. The main variations involve terminology, mature students and postgraduate students.  United Kingdom  =Oxford= At the University of Oxford, a typical college has a JCR for undergraduates, an MCR for graduates and an SCR for its fellows. JCRs and MCRs have a committee, with a president and so on, that represent their students to college authorities, the Oxford University Student Union (OUSU), etc., in addition to being an actual room for the use of members. SCRs typically have a president, an academic member of the body who deals with higher-level administrative matters pertaining to the SCR, such as inviting proposed visiting fellows to the body and identifying invited lecturers to any particular college event. SCRs are typically characterised by a copious provision of coffee, newspapers, and moderately informal space for academics to think and discuss ideas. Wadham College is a notable exception: although it maintains an MCR, its entire student population is represented by a combined students' union (SU). The JCR and MCR presidents of all affiliated Oxford common rooms, in addition to their OUSU reps, are automatically voting members of OUSU's governing council, which meets fortnightly during term to decide on virtually all aspects of OUSU's policy. the OUSU council meetings take place in odd-numbered weeks of the university term. JCR presidents also get together in even-numbered weeks for meetings of the presidents' committee (popularly known as prescom). MCR presidents also get together up to three times a term for meetings of the MCR presidents' committee (popularly known as MCR-prescom). Alternative names are sometimes used for college MCRs. Brasenose College has the \\"Hulme Common Room\\" (HCR), and University College has the \\"Weir Common Room\\", named in honour of college alumni. At Christ Church, St Antony's and Templeton the representative bodies for postgraduate students are called \\"graduate common rooms\\" or \\"GCRs\\". At some graduate colleges such as Wolfson, St. Cross and Linacre College, students and fellows share a single, egalitarian common room. In addition, colleges sometimes have additional common rooms, such as the \\"Summer Common Room\\" at Magdalen College, or the \\"Alumni Common Room\\" at St John's College.https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/alumni/alumni-benefits/ These are sometimes, but not always, associated with a particular section of the student or academic body. = Cambridge = At the University of Cambridge, most colleges have either common rooms or combination rooms, a tradition dating from the seventeenth century. The same abbreviations, JCR, MCR, and SCR are used for combination rooms. The JCR represents undergraduates, with postgraduate students being members of the middle combination room. In some colleges, postgraduates are members of both the MCR and JCR: for example, at St John's, where the MCR is known as the Samuel Butler Room or at Peterhouse. Most colleges also have an SCR. At Pembroke College the common rooms are called \\"parlours\\", such as the Junior Parlour and Graduate Parlour. At Jesus College, Cambridge, the JCR is known as \\"The Jesus College Students' Union\\", with its physical space being the Marshall Room. Similarly, Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, has both a JCR, MCR, and SCR along with a Sidney Sussex College Students Union of which all students are members. JCRs and MCRs have elected committees to represent their interests within their colleges and in the central students' union. The committees are almost universally led by a president and a range of other elected positions to cover specific areas or interest or functions (e.g. secretary, treasurer, entertainment). There is a great deal of variety between the colleges in terms of the roles that the JCRs and MCRs undertake, how much influence they have in college affairs and how many functions they provide. Nearly all are responsible for organising Freshers Week and frequent entertainments. JCR presidents and external officers in Cambridge are ex officio council members of the Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU). Before the CUSU was established, individual JCRs were direct members of the NUS. This meant that Churchill JCR was able to lead the NUS in its campaign for student representation. Unlike most universities, the CUSU serves the common rooms and common rooms may choose to disaffiliate. The CUSU is funded by the common rooms rather than funding them. = Bristol = Halls of the University of Bristol cater mostly for first year undergraduate students, though there is a sizable undergraduate and postgraduate community who choose to stay on, either in the capacity as senior residents or ordinary residents. The term JCR refers to the entire undergraduate population, but more specifically and commonly to the elected committee of students who run the JCR for one academic year. Though most Bristol Hall JCRs are made up of first years, it is custom in Clifton Hill House, Goldney Hall, Wills Hall and Manor Hall to elect returning students to the majority of positions, including JCR president. There is no MCR, but the SCR includes the warden, the vice/deputy warden, the senior residents and honourable guests at Formal Hall. The JCR refers also to a physical common room (for undergraduate students), with a separate and publicly inaccessible SCR room reserved elsewhere in the hall. = Durham = University College Durham Senior Common Room At Durham, the majority of the sixteen colleges divide their members into: * A JCR for undergraduate students * An MCR for postgraduate students * An SCR for academics who are members of the college In addition, there may be one or more rooms set aside for the use of these bodies referred to as \\"the JCR\\" or \\"the MCR\\" etc. The committees that run the JCR and MCR are called the \\"executive committees\\" or \\"exec\\". Membership of the JCR and MCR is not obligatory to students. There are some exceptions to this. The College of St Hild and St Bede has a \\"Students Representative Council\\", which includes both undergraduates and postgraduates at the college, with a special postgraduate committee. St.Aidan's College combines the MCR and SCR into one SCR whereby the postgraduates and senior members belong to one common room as a whole, while St Cuthbert's Society combines the JCR and MCR into one JCR. Following a referendum in 2011, students of St. John's College are represented by the \\"St. John's Common Room\\" (SJCR) a composite body representing undergraduates, the MCR (postgraduates) and the Cranmer Common Room (representing the students of Cranmer Hall) (pre-2011 the body was the joint junior common room JJCR). Ustinov College, which does not take undergraduates, has a graduate common room (GCR) for its students. Although the Durham Students' Union is independent from the college common rooms, each college has a representative to the union. = Exeter = At the University of Exeter, a number of residential halls for first year undergraduates retain traditional common room structures. Lopes, Hope and Mardon halls are all home to extensive common room set ups, which form a central part of student life there. In such halls, committees are elected to represent the student body via the common room, and it is their job to liaise with the resident tutors who reside within the hall. Although somewhat under threat by mergers of Halls and changes to internal administration, the common rooms still play an active and important role within the university, by both providing welfare and recourse to higher authorities for the students, and by organising social events such as balls, formals and more casual activities. = Kent = At Kent each of the colleges was initially built with one or more \\"senior common room\\" social spaces. However, over the passage of time a number of the common rooms have been transformed into eateries and more formalised social areas. Each college has a \\"management committee\\" (formerly \\"junior college committee\\" and before that, \\"junior common room committee\\") which acts to represent the students of each college at the students' union and organise cultural events. The rooms and committees have traditionally been open to both undergraduates and postgraduates, with the senior common rooms provided for staff. = Lancaster = At Lancaster, undergraduates are members of one of eight colleges (with a further college for postgraduate students). Each undergraduate college is a quasi-autonomous body within the university, and each divides its members into junior and senior common rooms. These terms are more indicative of the collective student/staff bodies than actual space, although each college has actual common rooms set aside for junior members. Senior members are less fortunate due to a current policy by the university's estates department of removing senior common room space from college control ‚Äì refurbishing these as teaching rooms or putting them on the central booking system, so SCR members cannot just \\"drop in\\". The term \\"JCR\\", although intended to refer to all junior members of a college, is often used to refer to elected members of each college's JCR executive. Each JCR executive organises a range of social and sporting activities for its college while also offering welfare support for its junior members. The president and vice president represent their college at the student union council and on a range of university committees, and many JCR executive members sit with SCR members on the college syndicate ‚Äì the governing body of each college. Within the graduate college, the graduate students' association (GSA) takes on the role of an \\"MCR\\". Lancaster has a students' union which co-ordinates activities between the different colleges, and the JCR and GSA executives are considered to be standing committees of the union council. = Leicester = At Leicester the JCR is open to all members of the university, although its main focus is around the halls of residence of the university. The committee was responsible for running the various activities within the halls of residence and the represents students based at the halls. The term JCR also refers informally to the undergraduate population of the university as a whole . The committee of the JCR is main elected from its members within the halls of residence. The SCR for the university remains on its main campus. Membership of the common room is open to all full-time members of staff but not postgraduate students, although they may be entertained as guests of members in the bar. The common room itself and its activates are governed by a committee of elected academics and fellows. = Nottingham = At Nottingham, the majority of the halls of residence predominantly house undergraduates, with a small number of postgraduates living in hall as part of the pastoral and disciplinary system; in this instance, the JCR refers to the undergraduate members of the hall. Postgraduates, along with a warden, comprise the SCR. The hall warden is a member of university staff, often an academic, that might reside either in a special residence within the hall, or in a nearby house. JCR activities include representation by elected students of their hallmates on accommodation issues, organised social events, and sports teams that compete in the athletic union's inter-mural sports competitions. Since most students move out of halls after their first year, it is common for students to retain a sense of affiliation to their hall while living off-campus. Many JCRs include former residents of the hall in their sports teams. All of the JCRs are now part of the students' union. Melton Hall houses only postgraduates, and the student organisation there forms the university's only MCR. = Reading = University of Reading JCRs are set up in a very similar way to their Oxford counterparts, as the University was founded as University College, Reading, as part of Christ Church, Oxford. The JCRs at Reading are some of the oldest outside Oxbridge with some such as Wantage JCR founded in 1908, St Patrick's Hall JCR in 1913 and Wessex JCR later in 1915. Today there are thirteen JCRs operating independently of each other, although they do work with the students' union. JCRs represent all students in a particular hall as well as having a large number of attached members living in houses. Each year a new committee is elected in each halls. The University of Reading Senior Common Room] began life in 1897 as the common room, but in 1908 a proposal was found to be necessary (and was carried) to have the title altered from staff common room to senior common room. The SCR functions as a \\"staff social club\\" of the university. The membership currently includes over 800 academic, administrative and technical staff within the various departments and offices from across the University. Postgraduates may become associated members. = St Andrews = At the University of St Andrews, each hall of residence has a common room for use by all the resident students. Each year, the residents of the hall elect a committee that is responsible for social events. A portion of the yearly residence fees are earmarked for use by the committee for such events. Each hall also has a warden, assisted by one or more subwardens, who is responsible for discipline in the hall (such as dealing with complaints of excessive noise), and who also acts as an advisor to the committee. The hall common rooms may contain a television or hall library (some halls have dedicated rooms for these). The committee may also subscribe to newspapers and magazines, or buy books and DVDs, which are made available in the common room. In addition St Mary's College has a JCR for the use of undergraduates and an SCR for the use of staff. The previous principal of St Andrews, Brian Lang, was criticized and finally rebuked by the university court for requisitioning common rooms in certain halls for private parties, despite complaints by residents about noise and disruption to hall activities. His successor, Louise Richardson, has indicated that she will not continue this or any similar practice. = Southampton = JCRs at the University of Southampton exist in each of the different halls of residences; Archers Road, Mayflower, Bencraft, Chamberlain, Connaught Hall, Erasmus Park (At Winchester School Of Art), Glen Eyre, Highfield halls and Montefiore. The JCRs provide a welfare and support role to new students, and coordinate social and sports activities around the halls. Yearly elections are held in December, with members serving one or two yearly terms. In 2009 JCRs became part of Southampton University Students' Union representative structure and operate under the JCR executive officer, with a budget of nearly ¬£92,000. = York = The day-to-day running of the colleges is managed by an elected committee of staff and student members chaired by the college's provost. Colleges have a JCR for undergraduate students, which is managed by the elected JCR committee (JCRC), and a GCR for post-graduate students, as well as an SCR, which is managed by elected representatives of the college's academic and administrative members. The only exceptions to this are Wentworth which as a post-graduate only college does not have a JCR, and Halifax and Constantine which are run by a student association that represents both undergraduates and postgraduates together. Langwith's JCR is branded as a \\"student association\\", however Langwith retains a GCR and an SCR and therefore its SA plays the same role as the JCRC in the other colleges. The JCRs are run by a JCRC headed by an executive committee made up of a chair/president, vice chair/presidents, secretary, and treasurer who have signatory powers. Below the executive committee are the rest of the members of the committees who have responsibilities for welfare, activities, events and the general running of the committee. Annual elections are held in November with people coming forward to stand for the various positions. Each individual college's JCRC is slightly different in composition, however all are elected by the undergraduate population following a hustings. The successful candidates are then elected for a whole year, bar any extenuating circumstances e.g. a vote of no confidence. The JCRC's primary functions are to be representative of the specific needs of their undergraduate populations, and to provide welfare help to students in the form of welfare reps who can offer advice or give contact details of other groups to students through informal drop-in sessions. With York's collegiate system though, JCRCs are increasingly involved in fostering college spirit through organising the many major social events a college has, such as Christmas and summer formal balls.  United States  = Harvard = At Harvard College, the term junior common room officially refers to the collection of undergraduates affiliated with one of Harvard's 12 houses. Every undergraduate is assigned to a house in the spring of his or her freshman year and thereafter is a member of that house's JCR, including students who have chosen to reside off campus. In everyday usage, however, \\"junior common room\\" almost always refers to a large common room in an undergraduate house by the same name. JCRs are generally available for undergraduates to study or watch television, and student groups often reserve the space for meetings. This is in contrast to an SCR, which is for exclusive use of the houses' senior common room members, which includes the house masters, tutors, and other accomplished academics in the community.  Canada  = McGill University = The faculty of religious studies houses a JCR and SCR. The JCR is a center for social activity among students, and the SCR is often used as a setting in films due to its luxurious setting. The university residences also have areas which are designated as \\"common rooms\\". = Memorial University of Newfoundland = Paton College of Memorial University of Newfoundland has a JCR for undergraduates and all members of the university, and an SCR for use by academics. = Lady Eaton College, Trent University = Lady Eaton College continues several Oxbridge traditions present at the founding of Trent University in 1964. This includes a JCR for the use of students and an SCR for college fellows and staff. It is the only college on the main campus that presently maintains both a JCR and SCR. = St John's College, University of Manitoba = St John's College maintains an SCR for use by fellows and staff of the college. The Cross Common Room is a centre for social and academic events at the college and regularly hosts lectures, presentations, and other events for groups from the wider university. = University of Toronto = Most colleges at University of Toronto have a common room system. The University of Trinity College, has maintained many of the traditions of Oxbridge, including the wearing of academic gowns and several common rooms, including a JCR, divinity common room, and SCR, which are all communities within the college as well as physical rooms. All undergraduate students registered in the college are members of the JCR, which hosts a variety of lively social activities, as well as serving as a comfortable student lounge with newspapers from around the world. The divinity common room is available to students in Trinity's Faculty of Divinity, the oldest Anglican theological faculty in Canada. The SCR consists of college fellows with teaching appointments in the University of Toronto, teaching staff in the faculty of divinity, senior college administrators, postgraduate students who serve as academic dons, and divinity graduate students with fellowships. Other select members of the wider academic, social, and ecclesiastical community are also included. The SCR hosts a number of social and educational events and weekly high table dinners in Strachan Hall. The room, which overlooks the college quadrangle, is a faculty lounge hosting daily tea and weekly wine receptions. In University College, Toronto, the JCR is a popular hangout for students.  Australia  = Newman College, University of Melbourne = Newman College has two common rooms: * The JCR, for undergraduate students * The SCR, for graduates, postgraduates, tutors and staff = Ormond College, University of Melbourne = The student population at Ormond College is split into four common rooms: * The JCR, for undergraduate students * The upper common room (UCR), for later year undergraduate students * The MCR, for graduate students * The SCR, for postgraduate students, tutors and staff = Trinity College, University of Melbourne = Trinity has three common rooms: * The JCR, for undergraduate students * The Cripps Middle Common Room, for graduate and postgraduate students * The SCR, for tutors and staff = Women's College, University of Sydney = The Women's College, University of Sydney has three common rooms: * An MCR ‚Äì for all college members * A menzies common room ‚Äì for all college members * An SCR ‚Äì for academics, postgraduates and invited senior undergraduate students = St. Andrew's College, University of Sydney = The student population at St. Andrew's College, Sydney is organised around two common rooms, the JCR and the SCR. * The JCR is the community of undergraduate members of the college. The JCR is the centre of undergraduate life and reflects the history of student self-governance at St Andrew's. Between 1896 and 1902, the undergraduate residents organised themselves into a fully representative body, the \\"students' club\\". By 1906, the students' club was in full operation with a formal constitution and a house committee elected annually. For well over a century, the house committee has been an independent advocate for student needs and the college, and still retains substantial organisational, budgetary and disciplinary responsibilities. For the first eighty-four years from 1876, the students' common room was housed in a large hall on the ground floor of the main building, now the reading room. At first, it also served as the dining hall, until the new Sulman Wing was added in 1893. When the college's third dining hall was built in a Jacobean style by the eminent architect, Ellice Nosworthy, in 1960, it also contained new accommodation for the JCR.Jack, R. I., The Andrew's Book, 4th edition, Sydney: The Principal and Councillors of St Andrew's College, 2013. Facilities include a lounge, widescreen television, table tennis and pool tables, as well as a fully licensed bar. * The SCR is the egalitarian community of senior members of St Andrew's College, including academics, postgraduates and invited JCR members. Since 1960, the SCR has found a home in the former theological lecture hall in the Sulman Wing of the college. Its walls of honey-coloured Hawkesbury sandstone, leadlight windows and antique paintings give the room a distinguished air while its use as an informal shared space lends the SCR a homely feel. While there was no designated combination room for the SCR until 1950, resident scholars and senior members of the college had always gathered in each other's rooms after meals to fulfil the collegiate function of the common room. When George Arnold Wood, the first Challis Professor of History at Sydney University was in residence in 1896, he and the college's principal, Reverend John Kinross, would retire after dinner, either to the rooms of Kinross or Professor Wood, where they \\"would smoke and discuss everything from predestination to tobacco\\". Over the years, the SCR has had many distinguished members, including V. Gordon Childe, Raymond Dart, and H. V. Evatt. Today, members of the SCR meet before formal dinners to socialise before ascending via a spiral staircase to Ellice Nosworthy's Jacobean Dining Hall. Following formal dinners, members descend to hear a learned paper or an occasional concert. = St. Paul's College, University of Sydney = The student population at St. Paul's College, Sydney is split into two common rooms: * A JCR ‚Äì for the junior undergraduate population * An SCR ‚Äì for academics and postgraduates = Jane Franklin Hall, University of Tasmania = Jane Franklin Hall has three common rooms: * The Horton Junior Common Room ‚Äì for undergraduate students * The Edwin Pitman Middle Common Room ‚Äì for later year undergraduate students * The SCR ‚Äì for postgraduate students, staff and fellows = Christ College, University of Tasmania = Christ College has two common rooms: * A JCR ‚Äì for the general student population * An SCR ‚Äì for study = Trinity College, University of Western Australia = Trinity has two common rooms: * The JCR, a smaller TV viewing room * The Jean Randall Common Room, a general meeting place for everyone in the college. It contains comfortable lounges so everyone can relax. On the mezzanine floor overlooking the lounge area are two full size professional billiard tables.

On 31 January 2011, the BBC announced that the event would be discontinued with immediate effect due to financial cutbacks. The name was taken from The Proms, a classical music festival running since 1895, and borrowed a few traditions from its counterpart such as the final night culminating in an interpretation of \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\". The musical performances at the festival typically involved indie rock bands incorporating instruments outside of their usual arrangement, most commonly in the form of collaborations with the BBC Concert Orchestra. Primarily the festival's headline acts played at The Roundhouse in Camden but events, which included a programme of film, were not limited to this venue.

The regiment fought in many engagements throughout the war and the men were among the thousands of loyalists who settled in Nova Scotia, after the regiment disbanded in 1783. Regiment formed The Loyal American Regiment was raised in mid-March 1777 by wealthy loyalist Beverley Robinson. Robinson, a childhood friend of George Washington, commanded the regiment until it was disbanded at the end of the war in 1783. Several of Beverley Robinson's sons were officers in the regiment, including Frederick Philipse Robinson. A number of the enlisted men in the Loyal Americans were tenant farmers who worked Robinson's estate in the Philipse Patent then in lower Dutchess and Westchester counties of the Province of New York., British Provincial Units/Loyal American Regiment. Early Campaigns The Loyal American Regiment served in many war- time engagements, often at detachment strength. The Loyal Americans spent many months of the war in the Province of New York at Morrisania and Kingsbridge defending British-occupied New York City. The Loyal Americans are best known for being the first British regiment to enter Fort Montgomery in the Hudson Highlands when it was captured during the Battle of Fort Montgomery on October 6, 1777. The regiment continued garrison duty on the lines at Kingsbridge or on Long Island until the Spring of 1779 when they took part in yet another expedition up the Hudson, this time garrisoning the posts of Verplanck's Point and Stony Point. A detachment of the regiment was captured in July 1779, during the Battle of Stony Point when the fort at was taken in the Battle of Stony Point by the Continental Army., British Provincial Units/Loyal American Regiment. Emmerick's Chasseurs Several detachments of men from the regiment served with distinction in other Provincial units during the American Revolution. In August 1777, Captain Joshua Barnes had his company transferred into a new Loyalist regiment commanded by Lt. Col. Andreas Emmerick. Known as Emmerick's Chasseurs, this corps expanded into a legion of dragoons, riflemen, light infantry and chasseurs and served constantly on the lines of Kinsbridge. Unfortunately, the corps was very ill-disciplined, particularly amongst the officers, which directly led to its disbanding in August 1779., Loyal American Regiment by Todd Braisted The Southern Theatre In December 1779, Major Patrick Ferguson recruited volunteers from amongst the Provincial Corps at New York to serve as riflemen and rangers on the up-coming expedition to take Charleston, South Carolina. Known as the \\"American Volunteers\\", this corps landed in Georgia in the beginning of February, 1780 and made its way to the Siege of Charleston, taking part in the destruction and dispersal of the Continental Cavalry at the Battle of Monck's Corner. The Loyal Americans continued to serve as a detached Company of Foot, and assisted in the training of Loyalist militia regiments. They suffered heavy casualties soon after, during the Battle of King's Mountain. The survivors either returned to the regiment over time or sat out the war in prison., Loyal American Regiment by Todd Braisted The Light Company was detached in October 1780 under Major General Alexander Leslie, serving with five other companies of light infantry raised from other Provincial regiments from the New York area. After some minor forays into the Chesapeake Bay, the Light Company was ordered to Charleston. The Light Company operated in the High Hills of Santee, mostly engaged in operations against the rebel partisan Thomas Sumter. After many skirmishes and casualties, they fought at the bloody Battle of Eutaw Springs, in September 1781. Suffering many casualties, the companies were returned to their parent units at New York in the Spring of 1782. Virginia and New Jersey A raid by British forces, including the Loyal Americans, against Hackensack in March 1780, resulted in the burning of the town's courthouse. In April 1780 50 men of the corps assisted in the surprise attack on the Pennsylvania Line in Paramus, New Jersey. The regiment once remained in garrison until December 1780 when it was ordered to Virginia under the command of Benedict Arnold. The regiment suffered very severely throughout January 1781 and thereafter until they returned to New York in early June of that year. Receiving little rest, they took part in an unsuccessful raid to Pleasant Valley, New Jersey under Brig. Genl. Cortlandt Skinner of the New Jersey Volunteers., Loyal American Regiment by Todd Braisted Fort Griswold Between September 4‚Äì14, 1781, under the command of Lieut. Colonel Beverly Robinson Jr., the Loyal American Regiment participated in the Battle of Groton Heights at New London, Connecticut commanded by Brigadier General Benedict Arnold. On September 6, the regiment landed about four miles south of New London. With four companies of the 38th Regiment of Foot, it assaulted and captured Fort Griswold. Later, it took part in the occupation of the town, where it searched for and burned military and public stores. Resettlement in British Canada When the war was over, Loyalists were unwelcome in the former colonies. From New York City, Britain transported thousands of Loyalists to Nova Scotia throughout the early fall of 1783. In all about 33,000 were settled in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick (separated from Nova Scotia in 1784), Prince Edward Island, and Quebec (including areas that were eventually separated to form Upper Canada, eventually renamed Ontario). Many members of the Loyal American Regiment settled there; some were among the first colonists of the newly formed province of New Brunswick., British Provincial Units/Loyal American Regiment.

Centered on the new characters Aenea and Raul Endymion, it has been well received like Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion - within a year of its release, the paperback edition had gone through five reprints. The novel was shortlisted for the 1997 Locus Award. Plot summary =Background= 274 years ago, Hegemony CEO Meina Gladstone ordered the destruction of all farcaster portals to stop the TechnoCore from eliminating humankind. This resulted in the collapse of civilization on most planets. Brawne Lamia, pregnant by the first John Keats cybrid, gave birth to a daughter called Aenea. Lamia died when Aenea was still young, and Silenus raised her. When Aenea was twelve years old, she entered the Time Tombs and disappeared into the future. Before the Fall, Father Paul Dur√© was elected as Pope under the name of Teilhard. When he died unexpectedly, Lenar Hoyt was resurrected from their shared body and elected Pope. The Church developed new technology that improved the results of the resurrection, so Catholics who accepted the cruciform became virtually immortal. With help of its military forces (the Pax), the Catholic Church filled the void left by the Hegemony after the Fall. With each subsequent death, Hoyt was resurrected, and Father Dur√© never again appeared in the public eye. =Aenea's rescue= On Hyperion, a hunting guide named Raul Endymion is given a mission from Martin Silenus: rescue Aenea, who is about to return from the Time Tombs; find old Earth; destroy the Pax; and stop the TechnoCore. Endymion is helped by android A. Bettik and by the Consul's starship. The Pax, which teaches that Aenea is a dangerous abomination, knows that she is about to arrive from the Time Tombs. Father-Captain Federico de Soya is instructed to capture her. The Shrike and Aenea simultaneously arrive; the Shrike massacres most of the Pax military units. In the confusion, Endymion rescues Aenea. Father de Soya pursues Aenea in an Archangel-class courier ship Raphael. The ship's new technology allows faster-than-light travel without time debt, at the price of a painful death and resurrection during each trip. Aenea convinces de Soya to allow her ship to land on the planet Renaissance Vector. She flies the ship through an ancient farcaster portal, which has been inactive since the Fall of Hyperion. De Soya attempts to disable Aenea's ship, but is too late to prevent it from farcasting. =Traveling through the River Tethys= The damaged ship arrives on an unknown planet. Aenea and Raul construct a raft to follow the River Tethys without the ship. De Soya begins an odyssey of continuous deaths and resurrections through all known planet systems in order to find her. The next farcaster sends Aenea to ocean planet Mare Infinitus. They encounter a sea platform occupied by Pax guards. Raul boards the hawking mat and goes alone to the platform, taking some explosives in order to create a distraction. He succeeds, but only after being injured by the Pax and losing the mat. Next, they translate to Hebron. They find the Jewish home planet completely abandoned. De Soya's search brings him to Mare Infinitus, where he finds evidence that Aenea and Endymion have been there. De Soya and his crew are rerouted to Pacem. They assign Rhadamanth Nemes, part of a new officer corps, to his guard. =Sol Draconi Septem= Aenea, Raul and Bettik travel to Sol Draconi Septem, a barely terraformed, frozen, high gravity planet. They meet and befriend Father Glaucus, an exiled priest, and the Chitchatuk, primitive humans who are adapted to Sol Draconi Septem's conditions. They farcast to Qom Riyadh, an Islamic planet which is now mysteriously uninhabited, and then to God's Grove. The Pope informs de Soya that Aenea is in Sol Draconi Septem. De Soya translates there, but Nemes does not die during the trip; it is revealed she is not human. Before the other crew members resurrect, she takes a dropship to the planet. She kills the Chitchatuk and Father Glaucus. She also links to the farcaster and learns that Aenea has gone to Qom Riyadh and will soon head for God's Grove. She plants this new destination in the ship's communicator, but de Soya is suspicious. When they farcast to God's Grove, de Soya secretly gives the ship instructions to resurrect the crew in only 6 hours instead of the safer 3 days. =God's Grove= Believing that she has three days before De Soya is resurrected, Nemes takes the Raphael's dropship and prepares an ambush for Aenea. As they travel through God's Grove, Aenea shares the truth of what happened to Earth. Earth was not moved by the Technocore, but by an unknown power. She suggests that the Technocore is responsible for the disappearance of the people in Hebron and Qom Riyadh and that it is behind the Church's resurgence and search for them. When Nemes attacks Aenea, the Shrike appears and blocks her attempts. Father de Soya strikes Nemes from space and allows Aenea to escape. He returns to Pacem to discover the truth about Nemes. Aenea's groups passes through a farcaster to reach Old Earth, which is now in the Magellanic Cloud. Aenea guides the ship to Fallingwater, Pennsylvania, where she will study with a cybrid of architect Frank Lloyd Wright until she is ready to fulfill her mission. Reception and Awards The novel received moderately positive reviews. Kirkus Reviews praised its intriguing ideas and characters, while criticizing it for an overly detailed and complex plot. Other reviewers enjoyed the detailed worldbuilding and eagerly awaited the sequel. The novel was shortlisted for the 1997 Locus Award for Best Novel.

It is about 1 mile northwest of the village of Zennor, and immediately to the west of Zennor Head.Ordnance Survey One-inch Map of Great Britain; Land's End, sheet 189. 1961 The name originates from the Cornish 'pen' (end, head) and 'dour' (water) Mermaid legend A local legend the Mermaid of Zennor says that if you sit above Pendour Cove at sunset on a fine summer evening you might hear the singing of Matthew Trewella, of Zennor, who fell in love with a mermaid and followed her out to sea. According to the legend, Matthew Trewhella was a good-looking young man with a good voice. Each evening he would sing, in a solo, the closing hymn at the church in Zennor. A mermaid living in neighbouring Pendour Cove was enchanted by his singing. She dressed in a long dress to hide her long tail and walked, a little awkwardly, to the church. Initially, she just marvelled at Matthew's singing before slipping away to return to the sea. She came every day, and eventually became bolder, staying longer. It was on one of these visits that her gaze met Matthew's, and they fell in love. The mermaid knew, however, that she would have to go back to the sea or else she would die. As she prepared to leave, Matthew said \\"Please do not leave. Who are you? Where are you from?\\" The mermaid replied that she was a creature from the sea and that she had to return there. Matthew was so love-struck that he swore he would follow her wherever she went. Matthew carried her to the cove and followed her beneath the waves, never to be seen again. It is said that if one sits above Pendour Cove at sunset on a fine summer evening one may hear Matthew singing faintly on the breeze. The legend is the subject of the 1980 song \\"Mermaid\\" by Cornish folk singer Brenda Wootton. History At the parish church of St. Senara, visitors to Zennor may see a carved pew-end, over 600 years old, showing an image of the legendary mermaid. British abstract sculptor Dame Barbara Hepworth, who lived in Cornwall, produced Pendour between 1947 and 1948. It is now in the collection of the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington D.C.

There are nine branch libraries, a mobile library and outreach van. It is an independent legal entity with an executive management team which is responsible for day-to-day operations of the organisation. It is managed by the Yarra Plenty Regional Library Board made of two representatives (councillors) of the three municipalities that constitute the service. Its role is to set the policy and direction for the regional library service. The library is administered from its Library Support Services (LSS) located at PRACC North at the City of Whittlesea Civic Centre, Sth Morang. The library service covers an area of 988.4 km¬≤ including metropolitan, urban fringe and rural populations. Service delivery is provided through nine branch libraries located at Greensborough, Eltham, Ivanhoe, Lalor, Mill Park, Rosanna, Thomastown, Watsonia and Whittlesea. Two mobile libraries provide services including a specially designed vehicle that visits institutions for those residents unable to visit a library. YPRL also provides computer services to Murrindindi Library Service, including full access to the library's database. YPRL is a member of Libraries Australia and a member of Public Libraries Victoria There are 115,000 members constituting 31 per cent of a population of nearly 400 000 people across the three municipalities. It has 155 staff and issues 3.6 million loans a year.  History  Heidelberg City Library became Heidelberg Regional Library in 1965 following the City of Heidelberg's agreement with the former Shire of Eltham and the Shire of Diamond Valley The Shire of Eltham was represented by Councilors Charice Pelling and John Lewis. In December 1976 the Shire of Whittlesea formerly became a member of the Heidelberg Regional Library Service The history of public library service in the City of Heidelberg dates back to 1899. Heidelberg City Library operated the first bookmobile in Victoria in 1954. As early as 1883 Whittlesea Shire residents were lobbying for a library. Yarra Plenty Regional Library was established in 1996 under the Local Government Act 1989 following changes in local government boundaries, an agreement between the new municipalities of Nillumbik Shire Council and Banyule and Whittlesea City Councils formed a Regional Library Corporation The Library has a long and rich history of volunteerism which continues to this day. As early as 1980, Heidelberg Regional Library were recruiting volunteers to deliver books to local nursing homes. In 2005 YPRL implemented a floating collection which means that a loaned item which includes books and audio visual materials can remain at a branch library when returned instead of being returned to the library from where it was borrowed. In 2006 the library had the highest per capita rate of membership in Australia In 2007, Yarra Plenty Regional Library commenced a change over to self service with the RFID tagging of the entire collection and installation of self check machines. These machines allow patrons to add items to their own card, with no staff required to assist. Part of the renovations to Eltham included a self returns machine so that patrons could also return their own materials rather than having staff do it. Changing completely to Self Check Out was a pioneering move on the part of the library, being one of the first in Australia to adopt the technology. Wikinorthia, a community history wiki was launched in 2008, a project allowing users to add and edit content. It was the first project of its kind in Australia, engaging people from communities across Moreland, Darebin, Banyule, Nillumbik and Whittlesea.

Hyman had been representing a divorced woman fighting for custody of her four-year-old daughter when he tried to falsely incriminate the girl's father. The father, Simon Eades, was applying for increased access to his child. Hyman had crafted and sent a fraudulent email to the father which appeared to be from a charity campaigning for fathers' rights and whose content appeared to support the father's claim that he should be granted greater access to his daughter. When Eades presented the email in court, Hyman accused him of forgery. Eades' own detective work attempting to clear his name led ultimately to the arrest of Hyman.

The practice involves refining and purifying one's motivations and attitudes. The fifty-nine or so slogans that form the root text of the mind training practice are designed as a set of antidotes to undesired mental habits that cause suffering. They contain both methods to expand one's viewpoint towards absolute bodhicitta, such as \\"Find the consciousness you had before you were born\\" and \\"Treat everything you perceive as a dream\\", and methods for relating to the world in a more constructive way with relative bodhicitta, such as \\"Be grateful to everyone\\" and \\"When everything goes wrong, treat disaster as a way to wake up.\\" Prominent teachers who have popularized this practice in the West include Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n, Ken McLeod, Alan Wallace, Ch√∂gyam Trungpa, Sogyal Rinpoche, Kelsang Gyatso, Norman Fischer and the 14th Dalai Lama. History of the practice Lojong mind training practice was developed over a 300-year period between 900 and 1200 CE, as part of the MahƒÅyƒÅna school of Buddhism. Ati≈õa (982‚Äì1054 CE), a Bengali meditation master, is generally regarded as the originator of the practice. It is described in his book Lamp on the Path to Enlightenment (Bodhipathapradƒ´pa·πÉ). The practice is based upon his studies with the Sumatran teacher, Dharmakƒ´rti≈õrƒ´ (Tib. Serlingpa, Wylie: gser gling pa), and the Indian teacher Dharmarak·π£ita, a prominent teacher at Odantapuri and author of a text called the Wheel of Sharp Weapons. Both these texts are well known in Tibetan translation. Ati≈õa's third major teacher of lojong is said to have been the junior Kusalƒ´, known also as Maitrƒ´yogi.The Book of Kadam: The Core Texts (Library of Tibetan Classics) by Thupten Jinpa Wisdom Publications: 2008. pg 628 Ati≈õa journeyed to Sumatra and studied with Dharmakƒ´rti≈õrƒ´ for twelve years. He then returned to teach in India, but at an advanced age accepted an invitation to teach in Tibet, where he stayed for the rest of his life. A story is told that Ati≈õa heard that the inhabitants of Tibet were very pleasant and easy to get along with. Instead of being delighted, he was concerned that he would not have enough negative emotion to work with in his mind training practice. So he brought along his ill-tempered Bengali servant- boy, who would criticize him incessantly and was challenging to spend time with. Tibetan teachers then like to joke that when Ati≈õa arrived in Tibet, he realized there was no need after all. The aphorisms on mind training in their present form were composed by Chekawa Yeshe Dorje (1101‚Äì1175 CE). According to one account, Chekhawa saw a text on his cell-mate's bed, open to the phrase: \\"Gain and victory to others, loss and defeat to oneself\\". The phrase struck him and he sought out the author Langri Tangpa (1054‚Äì1123). Finding that Langri Tangpa had died, he studied instead with one of Langri Tangpa's students, Sharawa Y√∂nten Drak, for twelve years. Chekhawa is claimed to have cured leprosy with mind training. In one account, he went to live with a colony of lepers and did the practice with them. Over time many of them were healed, more lepers came, and eventually people without leprosy also took an interest in the practice. Another popular story about Chekhawa and mind training concerns his brother and how it transformed him into a much kinder person.Gyatso (2002), pages 5-6. Root text The original Lojong practice consists of 59 slogans, or aphorisms. These slogans are further organized into seven groupings, called the \\"7 Points of Lojong\\". The categorized slogans are listed below, translated by the Nalanda Translation Committee under the direction of Ch√∂gyam Trungpa. The following is translated from ancient Sanskrit and Tibetan texts and may vary slightly from other translations. Many contemporary gurus and experts have written extensive commentaries elucidating the Lojong text and slogans. > Point One: The preliminaries, which are the basis for dharma practice > :Slogan 1. First, train in the preliminaries; The four reminders. or > alternatively called the Four Thoughts ::1. Maintain an awareness of the > preciousness of human life. ::2.

Commentaries One seminal commentary on the mind training practice was written by Jamgon Kongtrul (one of the main founders of the non-sectarian Rime movement of Tibetan Buddhism) in the 19th century. This commentary was translated by Ken McLeod, initially as A Direct Path to Enlightenment. This translation served as the root text for Osho's Book of Wisdom. Later, after some consultation with Ch√∂gyam Trungpa, Ken McLeod retranslated the work as The Great Path of Awakening. Two commentaries to the root texts of mind training have been written by Kelsang Gyatso (founder of the New Kadampa Tradition) and form the basis of study programs at NKT Buddhist Centers throughout the world. The first, Universal CompassionGyatso (2002) is a commentary to the root text Training the Mind in Seven Points by Chekawa Yeshe Dorje. The second, Eight Steps to Happiness is a commentary to the root text, Eight Verses of Training the Mind by Langri Tangpa. In 2006, Wisdom Publications published the work Mind Training: The Great Collection (Theg-pa chen-po blo-sbyong rgya-rtsa), translated by Thupten Jinpa. This is a translation of a traditional Tibetan compilation, dating from the fifteenth century, which contains altogether forty-three texts related to the practice of mind training. Among these texts are several different versions of the root verses, along with important early commentaries by Se Chilbu, Sangye Gompa, Konchok Gyaltsen, Dalaielan Roebuck and others. In 2012, Shambhala Publications published Training in Compassion: Zen teachings on the Practice of Lojong by Zoketsu Norman Fischer which teaches ways to incorporate Lojong practices into Zen. Fischer felt that \\"the plain-speaking tradition of Zen might lend something to the power of the text\\" and that \\"although Zen is a Mahayana school (and therefore based on compassion teachings), it is nevertheless deficient in explicit teachings on compassion\\". In 2016, Shambhala Publications published The Intelligent Heart: A Guide to the Compassionate Life by Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche, with foreword by Pema Chodron.

Built \\"on speculation\\" in 1832 by Joseph Brewster, a hatter by trade, it is located at 29 East Fourth Street, between Lafayette Street and the Bowery in Manhattan. It became a museum in 1936, founded by George Chapman, a cousin of the family who once lived there. The House was among the first 20 buildings designated in 1965 under the City's new landmarks law. It is the only historic house museum in the Greenwich Village/Soho/NoHo neighborhoods. History Entrance Joseph Brewster, the builder, sold the house to Seabury Tredwell, a wealthy New York merchant, for $18,000. Tredwell's daughter, Gertrude, was born in the house in 1840. Gertrude and her seven siblings, two brothers and five sisters, all lived in the house together with their parents, four servants, and an ever- changing assortment of nieces, nephews, cousins, aunts and other relatives. Only two daughters and one son ever married, which was unusual for that era and for an affluent family with social position. Seabury died in 1865 and the remaining family lived at the home into old age. Gertrude, the youngest member of the immediate family, lived here alone for 24 years after the death of her sister Julia in 1909. As she grew older and more eccentric she became obsessed with holding on to the elegant home in a neighborhood that had become, by the early 20th century, a run-down, semi-industrial, and disreputable part of town. Burdened with severe financial hardship in her last years, she somehow managed to keep the beautiful home in nearly original condition, long after all the neighboring private homes had been demolished or converted into rooming houses, tenements, or commercial structures. After her death in 1933, a distant cousin, George Chapman, purchased the building, saving it from foreclosure and demolition. In 1936, after needed repair and renovation, the house opened as a museum and has remained one since. The Merchant's House Museum remains a unique time capsule of the lives of a typical affluent New York merchant family of the 19th century, complete with the original possessions of the family. Architecture and design Its facade is reminiscent of earlier Federal-style homes, but the interior, especially the formal double parlors, represent New York's finest example of Greek revival architecture. The interior also contains the Tredwell family's original furnishings, including pieces from prominent New York cabinetmaker Duncan Phyfe. Considered one of the finest surviving Greek Revival rowhouses in America, the house is a miraculous survivor of old New York. The house is important for its outstanding collection of original furnishings, decorative objects, magnificently preserved 19th century clothing and other personal effects of the Tredwell family. Stepping through the front portal is stepping into a time when New York City was becoming the most important seaport in North America and the house reflects these fortunate circumstances. The building underwent a major restoration in 1971 by architect Joseph Roberto and interior designer Carolyn Roberto. Landmark designations Due to its architectural and historic importance, the Merchant's House has been recognized with the following landmark designations: * 1936 - Documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey * 1965 - Designated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission as one of the first 20 New York City landmarks, p. 63 * 1965 - Designated as a National Historic Landmark and and part of the Historic House Trust in New York * 1966 - Listed on the National Register of Historic Places * 1981 - Designated as a New York City interior landmark Several doors east of the museum at 37 East 4th Street is the Samuel Tredwell Skidmore House, a Greek Revival house built for a cousin of Seabury Tredwell. That building is also a New York City Landmark (designated 1970), but is in disrepair and in need of restoration. Living Room Museum In addition to its magnificent period rooms, the museum presents many performances, presentations, lectures, exhibits and special events throughout the year. Ongoing research and state-of-the-art documentation and conservation techniques assure that more is constantly being learned about the house, its furnishings and outstanding textile collections, and ‚Äúwhat life was really like‚Äù for a 19th-century New York family. In 1991, in a joint effort with the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, the Merchant's House Museum launched the educational program, \\"Greenwich Village: History and Historic Preservation\\". The program was designed to teach students local history, architectural vocabulary, and the fundamentals of historic preservation. The program ran through the end of the 1990s at the museum, but eventually shifted its focus to the West Village, where it continues to reach out to students in the five boroughs. =Collection= The Museum's collection of over 3,000 items comprises the possessions of the Tredwells, the wealthy merchant-class family who lived in the House from 1835 to 1933. The collection includes furniture, decorative arts, clothing, photographs and books, household items, and personal items. Highlights include a suite of 12 mahogany side chairs attributed to renowned furniture maker Duncan Phyfe, a pair of matching six-globe gas chandeliers, and 40 dresses and numerous fashion accessories that belonged to the Tredwell women.

The Allies captured the forts after a brief but bloody battle.  Background  In mid-June 1900, allied forces in northern China were vastly outnumbered. In Beijing there were 450 soldiers and marines from eight countries protecting the diplomatic legations. Somewhere between Tianjin and Beijing were the 2,000 men in the Seymour Expedition attempting to get to Beijing to reinforce the legation guards. In Tianjin were 2,400 Allied soldiers, mostly Russians. All of these forces were menaced by thousands of \\"Boxers\\", members of an indigenous peasant movement that aimed to end foreign influence in China.Thompson, Larry Clinton. William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2009, p.68 The Qing government of China was wavering between supporting the Boxers in their anti-foreign crusade or suppressing them because they represented a threat to the dynasty.Tan, Chester C. The Boxer Catastrophe. New York: Columbia U Press, 1955, p. 72 A few miles offshore in the Yellow Sea were a large number of Western and Japanese warships. On June 15, Chinese forces deployed electric mines in the Peiho River before the battle to prevent the Eight-Nation Alliance from sending ships to attack. With their supply and communication lines to Tianjin threatened, the commanders of the ships met on June 16. Control of the Taku forts at the mouth of the Hai River was the key to maintaining a foothold in northern China. Vice-Admiral Hildebrandt, from the Imperial Russian Navy, through Lieutenant Bakhmetev, sent a message to the commander of the forts, who then sent a message by telegraph to the Governor of Zhili Province, stating that they proposed to \\"occupy provisionally, by consent or by force\\" the Taku Forts and demanded that Chinese forces surrender the forts before 2 a.m. on June 17. Of the Allied countries represented, only the United States Navy‚Äôs Rear Admiral Louis Kempff demurred, stating that he had no authority to undertake hostilities against China.Fleming, Peter. The Siege of Peking. New York: Dorset Press, 1959, pp. 79-81 Kempff said that an attack was an \\"act of war\\", and therefore refused to participate. However, Kempff agreed that an aging American gunboat, the Monocacy, could be stationed near the forts as a place of refuge for civilians in the vicinity.Sharf, Frederic A. and Harrington, Peter. China 1900: The Eyewitnesses Speak. London: Greenhill Books, 2000, p.91 It was an audacious demand by the foreign sailors. Only ten ships, including the non-combatant Monocacy, could cross over the banks at the river‚Äôs mouth to enter the Hai River ‚Äì two hundred yards wide‚Äîfrom where the four forts could be occupied or assaulted. Only 900 men could be assembled to undertake the operation. By contrast the Chinese soldiers and sailors in the forts and on several modern gunboats docked along the river consisted of about 2,000 men. The Chinese also began laying mines near the mouth of the river and installing torpedo tubes in the forts. In the evening of June 16, the foreign warships began entering the river and taking up their stations from which the Taku Forts could be occupied or assaulted.Scharf and Harrington, p. 95; Fleming,p. 80-81 The battle The Chinese did not wait for the expiration of the deadline but opened fire from the forts with every single gun at the Allied ships simultaneously at about 00:45 on June 17. The Russian gunboat Korietz was heavily damaged in the opening salvo. The Monocacy, despite its distance from the battle and the assurances of its officers to the 37 women and children aboard that they were ‚Äúin a position of absolute safety‚Äù took a Chinese shell in its bow which hurt nobody. The captain quickly moved the Monocacy to a safer position. Chinese gunnery from the forts aimed at the ships was accurate, also hitting HMS Whiting, SMS Iltis, and Lion and driving Giliak aground.Landor, A. Henry Savage. China and the Allies. New York: Scribner‚Äôs Sons, 1901, pp 118-119, 131 The Russians turned on the searchlight of Giliak, exposing them to Chinese guns. Giliak and another ship were severely damaged. 18 Russians were killed and 65 were wounded. The attack on Taku by the Allies influenced Empress Dowager Cixi's decision to support the Boxers. The most serious offensive threat to the Allied attack were four modern German-built destroyers laying alongside the dock at Taku. These warships could have easily overpowered the Allied ships, but inexplicably they remained docked even after the Chinese opened fire. Two British destroyers, HMS Whiting and HMS Fame (the former commanded by Lieutenant Colin Mackenzie and the latter by Roger Keyes), each towing a whaleboat with 10 men aboard, darted alongside the Chinese ships and boarded them. The Chinese only offered weak resistance before fleeing and leaving their ships in the hands of the British.Landor, 119; Thompson, 71 The artillery duel continued inconclusively until nearly dawn when the Allies stripped their ships of crew and mounted a ground assault on the Northwest Fort. 200 Russians and Austrians led the way followed by 380 British and Italians with 300 Japanese bringing up the rear. In a bit of luck for the allies, the powder magazine exploded just as the ground assault began and in the confusion afterwards the Japanese had the honor of storming the fort.Sharf, 95-96 The British and Italians then led the way on the assault of the North Fort which was soon captured.Landor, 126 Two forts remained on the south side of the river. The Allies turned all their guns, and the guns in the two Chinese forts they had captured, on these two forts. They blew up another powder magazine in one, and shortly afterwards the Chinese soldiers abandoned the forts. The Allied ground force then crossed the river and captured the forts with almost no opposition. The battle of the Taku Forts was over at 6:30 a.m. The Allies had suffered 172 casualties among the 900 soldiers and sailors engaged.Fleming, p. 83 The number of Chinese casualties is unknown but the forts were described as flowing in \\"rivers of blood\\".Sharf and Harrington, 92 However, Robert B. Edgerton says that Chinese casualties were \\"probably not heavy\\". Impact The attack by the allied navies on the Taku Forts had a profound impact. The first reports of the battle arriving in Beijing from Governor Lu Yu in Tianjin emphasized the positive ‚Äì and failed to mention to the Empress Dowager Cixi that the allies had captured the forts.Fleming, 83-84 The battle pushed the Qing government definitively to the side of the Boxers and the Chinese army was instructed to resist foreign military forces on Chinese soil. The next day, June 18, Admiral Seymour and his two thousand men were attacked by the Chinese army along the railroad running from Tianjin and Beijing and Seymour decided to abandon his objective of reaching Beijing and instead retreated to Tianjin. On June 19, an ultimatum was delivered to the diplomats in the Legation Quarter in Beijing informing them that they had 24 hours to depart the capital. When the foreigners refused to leave, fearing for their safety, the Siege of the Legations began on June 20. The Taku forts remained in foreign hands for the remainder of the Boxer Rebellion.Thompson, p. 73-74 Allied officers praised the courage and skill the Chinese had demonstrated in defending the Taku Forts.Landor, p. 130 Notes References  Thompson, Larry Clinton (2009), William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary, Jefferson, NC: McFarland Publishing Company. * Category:1900 in China Category:Battles of the Boxer Rebellion Category:Naval battles involving China Category:June 1900 events ","title":"Battle of the Taku Forts (1900)"},{"id":"7648462","text":"ESPN Hollywood is a television program that aired on ESPN2 in 2005. The daily 30-minute show was centered on the convergence between the sports and entertainment worlds, and was a part of the network's ESPN Original Entertainment (eoe) programming effort, which was intended to spread the network's viewership beyond the regular or hardcore sports fan. The program premiered on August 15, 2005 to a dismal rating of 0.08% of United States households with cable televisions, about 75,000 people. The show, described by the New York Daily News as \\"a sports version of Entertainment Tonight or Access Hollywood\\", was hosted by Mario Lopez and Thea Andrews. A typical show would include news of athletes appearing in movies, on television, and in commercials, coverage of movie premieres, and interviews with athletes and entertainers. The show's launch was controversial; promotional advertisements featured photos of baseball player Derek Jeter with a woman whose face was not shown. A spokesman for Jeter's employer, the New York Yankees, objected to the ad, saying \\"In the ad they insinuate they are out with Jeter, with his permission, or they are following him. Give me a break. Neither is true.\\" ESPN realized that the show would be risky; if sports figures were angered by their coverage on ESPN Hollywood they might refuse to participate in interviews on other ESPN programs. The final episode was broadcast on January 26, 2006. An ESPN executive vice president later remarked that the premise of the show was unworkable, saying \\"I think fans want information about athletes in the context of sports coverage.\\" ESPN Hollywood continued as a segment on Cold Pizza, also on ESPN2, until early 2006.

In 1989 it was ported to the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and NES (1990) systems by The Sales Curve and released by Virgin Mastertronic. Silkworm also spawned what many consider to be a spiritual successor to the game - SWIV. While SWIV was not a direct sequel, it followed the same core gameplay design of a helicopter/jeep team, albeit as a vertically scrolling shooter instead of a horizontally scrolling one. SWIV was described in the game's manual to mean both \\"Special Weapons Intercept Vehicles\\" and \\"Silkworm IV\\". Release Silkworm was released at a time where side-scrolling shooting games were among the most popular genres - it was released at the same time as Forgotten Worlds, Sanxion, Mr. Heli and DNA Warrior. The Spectrum version took 3 months to program from start to finish, and was a copy of the Amiga version, which was almost arcade perfect.http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue087/Pages/SinclairUser08700060.jpg The game reached number three in the UK Spectrum sales charts, behind RoboCop and Dragon Ninja. In November 1990, Virgin would rerelease Silkworm as part of the Edition 1 compilation, which also included Double Dragon, and the shoot'em ups Gemini Wing, and Xenon. Gameplay Silkworm on the Amiga Silkworm had interesting graphics and relatively fast-paced gameplay. The player can take control of a Jeep mounted with a machine gun or a Helicopter mounted with forward and downward firing guns. Two players can work simultaneously and cooperatively against enemies, with one playing as the Jeep and one as the Helicopter. In single-player mode, it is generally easier to play with the Helicopter than with the Jeep. When in Jeep mode, the player needs to destroy everything directly in front of it or be prepared to jump in order to avoid collisions. In two-player mode, the Helicopter and Jeep must cooperate and the players depend on each other to succeed. For example, the Helicopter can only fire forward, so occasionally, the Jeep must cover the rear with his swivelling gun. However, when covering the rear, the Jeep is vulnerable from the front, so the Helicopter must cover him. Silkworm featured a fairly wide variety of enemies, some of which had specific weaknesses, such as the armoured AA guns that could only be harmed when their shields were down to fire. Most famously, there was the \\"Goose\\" helicopter - a giant, heavily armoured \\"mini-boss\\" helicopter that was composed of several smaller vehicles connected together. The players collect shields (which could alternatively be shot by the player in order to destroy all enemies on the screen), power cells which increase firepower and an additional bonus can be added to the score achieved. The game gets harder on the completion of each level, which feature destructible environmental elements, such as buildings and ancient ruins. The speed was one of the defining parts of the gameplay, which the programmers who worked on the home conversions were keen to preserve, using a variety of programming techniques. One element that required work was the control system (the arcade original had three buttons, whereas most home systems had just one), but this was solved without much problem. Silkworm featured a background music theme composed by Barry Leitch, which went on to be a minor cult hit, being included on a Sinclair User covermounted cassette, along with such classics as Shinobi and Continental Circus.http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0013713 Final Silkworm belongs to the games that \\"don't have a final\\": after a certain level, the game goes on infinitely. Despite many other games of this kind, however, after a certain level it says to the player that it's not going to accept any more coins to continue the current game. It was thought computer conversions of this game only offered the player a notice as a final screen after beating a certain level, ending the game. The only exceptions being the Atari ST, Amigahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoDJS_5yr_w and NES conversions where there is a final sequence and an ending. A video released by ChinnyVision in August 2019 disproved this and shows endings for the Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 conversions.

Two years after his ordination to the Catholic priesthood in 1407, the community accepted the Rule of St. Augustine. He was chosen to be the first prior of the community. Lawrence promoted the Constitutions which had been established for the Canons of St. George, which was embraced by other communities of Canons in the region and shortly thereafter he became the Prior General of a Congregation. He was so zealous in spreading it that he was looked upon as if he were the actual founder of the Order. In 1433, Pope Eugene IV, one of the founders of the Monastery of San Giorgio, named Gustiniani as the Bishop of Castello. He found a diocese in shambles and his administration was marked by considerable growth and reform. In 1451, Pope Nicholas V united the Diocese of Castello with the Patriarchate of Grado, and the seat of the patriarchate was moved to Venice, making Giustiniani the first Patriarch of Venice, a post that he held for over four years. It was during Lawrence's rule that Constantinople fell to Muslim forces. Due to their centuries of close trading partnerships with Byzantine Empire, the people of Venice were in panic as to their future. He took a leading role in helping the Republic to deal with the crisis, working with the Senate to help chart its future, as well as with the clergy and people to calm them.

Oxford University Press) was an English physician to the British Royal Family and was the obstetrician to Princess Charlotte who became famous due to his role in \\"the triple obstetrical tragedy\\" of 1817. Early life and family He was born on 9 January 1762 at Dunster Park, Berkshire, the son of Herbert Croft and Elizabeth Young. He married on 3 November 1789 Margaret Denman, daughter of Dr. Thomas Denman and Elizabeth Brodie and the sister of Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman, who became Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. They had four children: Thomas Elmsley Croft, who succeeded his father as 7th Baronet; Archer Denman Croft, who succeeded his brother as 8th Baronet; Frances Elizabeth Croft; and the Reverend Richard Croft, rector at Hillingdon, Middlesex, England. Croft's great-grandson was Henry Page Croft, 1st Baron Croft (he being the son of Richard Benyon Croft, J.P., D.L., High Sheriff of Hertfordshire in 1892, of Fanhams Hall, Ware, Hertfordshire, and grandson of Reverend Richard Croft).Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage 2003, vol. 2, p. 2839 Education He began his medical training under Dr Rupert Chawner, an apothecary/surgeon residing at Burton-upon-Trent. After he completed his training under Dr.Rupert Chawner, his parents sent him to London to complete his medical education. He became a pupil of Dr. John Hunter; and by recommendation of Dr. Matthew Baillie,The brother of poet Joanna Baillie, he was a pupil of his anatomist John Hunter, his uncle. He was educated at Hamilton Academy, the University of Glasgow, and obtained his MD from the University of Oxford in 1789. (a fellow pupil of Croft's and nephew of Dr. John Hunter) he boarded and lodged with Dr. Denman. Croft was also trained by his father-in-law, Dr. Thomas Denman, a preeminent obstetrician in London at the turn of the nineteenth century, whose textbook on childbirth had been first published in 1788. He graduated with his MD from the University of Oxford in 1789. He held the office of Physician to King George III. Baronetcy  He succeeded to the title of 6th Baronet Croft, of Croft Castle in the County of Herefordshire, on 27 April 1816 upon the death of his brother, Sir Herbert Croft, who had died without male issue. \\"The triple obstetrical tragedy\\" When Princess Charlotte conceived in February 1817, Croft was chosen to attend her. Following medical dogma, Croft restricted her diet and bled her during the pregnancy. Her membranes broke 42 weeks after her last period on 3 November 1817. Her bedroom at Claremont was chosen as the labour and delivery room. The first stage of labour lasted 26 hours. At the beginning of the second stage of labour, Croft sent for Dr. John Sims, who arrived seven hours later. The second stage of labour lasted 24 hours. He had correctly diagnosed a transverse lie of the baby during labour; however, forceps were not used as they had fallen into disfavour in the British medical community. A caesarean section at that time would have resulted in the princess's death. Eventually, Princess Charlotte delivered a stillborn 9-pound male. Five hours later she died, presumably from concealed inner bleeding. Although the princess's husband and father sent messages to thank Croft for his care and attention, Croft was distraught over the outcome. The king ordered a necropsy, with the result that Sir Everard Home, 1st Baronet and Sir David Dundas, 1st Baronet, reported that everything had been done for the best. However, the death of the Princess continued to weigh heavily on Croft, and on 13 February 1818, at age 56, he killed himself with a gun.Memorials. st-james-piccadilly.org Near his body a copy of Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost was found open with the passage (Act V, Scene II): \\"Fair Sir, God save you!

On the streets of Northern Ireland in 1978 The Wheelbarrow is a remotely controlled robot designed in 1972 for use by British Army bomb disposal teams operating in Northern Ireland (321 EOD), mainland Britain (11 EOD Regiment) and Iraq. Over 400 have been destroyed in operation, and they are considered to have saved the lives of hundreds. Design and development Peter Miller, a retired Lieutenant- Colonel of the Royal Tank regiment, conceived the idea in the aftermath of a period (1971 ‚Äì 72) when the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) lost eight Ammunition Technical Officers (ATO) on active duty in Northern Ireland. Tasked with finding a solution by Colonel George Styles, Miller recalled that he had developed a technique when modifying a lawnmower. A possible solution to the problem, Miller went to a local garden centre to buy a lawnmower, but instead was convinced by the store manager to buy an electrically powered wheelbarrow, Miller thought it was \\"ideal and bought one on the spot\\". The head of the RAOC‚Äôs Bomb Disposal School, Major Robert John Wilson Patterson, who invented the Pigstick - a device which fires an explosively-propelled jet of water to disrupt the circuitry of a bomb and disable it - had just begun to be used by the ATOs in Northern Ireland, but was known to be \\"virtually useless against\\" car bombs. By incorporating the Pigstick into the Wheelbarrow, Patterson and Miller's inventiveness saved hundreds of lives. The crude prototypes produced at CAD Kineton proved difficult to manoeuvre so a team at the then Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment (MVEE, Chertsey) was tasked to improve the tracking and steering. The Wheelbarrow has undergone several upgrades, the latest being the Wheelbarrow Revolution. The most notable feature in this model include the 360 degree arm which can be outfitted with various EOD attachments. The Wheelbarrow Revolution is also capable of climbing stairways. The development of Wheelbarrow from Mark 3 to Mark 8 prototype was carried out by Peter Smith and Dennis Fry BEM, the Project Manager being Winter Pattinson MBE. Credit for chassis and automative design, build and fabrication should be attributed to Dennis Fry a workshop engineer. Peter Smith designed and manufactured the electrical systems and was presented with a model of a MK7 Wheelbarrow inscribed with Thanks from Lofty and the User. Other members of the team were Cyril Luger who was put in charge of the electronic aspect,& Rod Crane a valuable member of the small team. A Mark 9 version of the Wheelbarrow built by Northrop Grumman was unveiled in 2010. It is presently used by the UK Metropolitan Police Service .

Sharpe is embroiled in the British retreat through Portugal in 1810 from the defence of the ridge at Bussaco to the Lines of Torres Vedras, where the French offensive is successfully halted. Plot summary = Part One: Bussaco = Captain Richard Sharpe and his riflemen rejoin the South Essex Regiment during Wellington's retreat in Portugal. Sharpe is in a foul mood because his promised month of leave in Lisbon (after retrieving the gold in Sharpe's Gold) lasted barely a week, and in an even fouler mood because of Lieutenant Cornelius Slingsby, foisted on Sharpe by the South Essex's commander, Colonel William Lawford, at the insistence of his wife in England (Slingsby's sister-in-law) to advance the latter's career by any means. Lawford, despite knowing Sharpe's ability as a soldier, is seeking to ease Sharpe out and give Slingsby command of the South Essex's Light Company. Sharpe discovers a Portuguese Army major, Ferreira, and his criminal brother, \\"Ferragus\\", trying to sell a stockpile of flour to the advancing French, in contravention of Wellington's strict policy of stripping the land bare of any resources the enemy could use. Over the major's objections, Sharpe subdues Ferragus and has the flour scattered on the ground. Sharpe's friend, Major Hogan, later gives him a light reprimand, explaining that Ferreira is an intelligence officer for the Portuguese Army with contacts among the Portuguese sympathizers in the French Army, who claimed he was giving them the flour to gain the confidence of the French. Later, Sharpe is ambushed by Ferragus and his men and savagely beaten, saved from death only by the chance appearance of some provosts. On the morning of the Battle of Bussaco, Lawford uses Sharpe's injuries as an excuse to temporarily relieve him of command of the Light Company and place Slingsby in charge. The French launch a frontal attack up the steep ridge, only to be decimated by the Allies' cannon and musket fire. Because of Slingsby's incompetence, the Light Company is separated from the rest of the regiment and almost overrun by the retreating survivors of one of the destroyed French columns. Sharpe takes charge and narrowly averts disaster. Afterward, Slingsby complains to Lawford, who orders Sharpe to apologize for his harsh language. Sharpe refuses, and Lawford assigns him to replace the regimental quartermaster, confirming Slingsby as captain of the Light Company. = Part Two: Coimbra = Sharpe is sent ahead to Coimbra to prepare billets for the regiment and its officers. His friend, Portuguese Captain Jorge Vicente, goes along. Sharpe goes to Major Ferreira's house and finds it abandoned, except for his children's English governess, Sarah Fry, naked and locked in a room. Ferragus and his men had been guarding his brother's house, and Ferragus was planning to rape Sarah, but had to leave ahead of the arriving British soldiers. Ferragus, still seeking revenge against Sharpe, lures him, Sergeant Patrick Harper, and Vicente (along with Sarah) to a warehouse where he has hidden an enormous stockpile of food and other supplies for sale to the desperate French Army. Ferragus traps the four in the stone cellar, planning to return and finish them off after the British and Portuguese forces depart. Ferragus is sure the cellar is escape-proof, but Sharpe and Harper, seeing the movement of rats, pry up the floor and break into a sewer, through which they escape. By the time they emerge above ground, the British Army has left and the French are raping, pillaging and murdering the residents of the city. Sharpe and Harper save a young Portuguese woman, Joana, from being raped by three French soldiers. Before fleeing the city, Sharpe manages to set fire to the warehouse, destroying the supplies. Ferragus and his brother have already been paid for their stores, but flee the city when they see the warehouse burning, realizing they will be blamed for its loss. = Part Three: The Lines of Torres Vedras = Marshal Mass√©na and his army march south from Coimbra, but are stopped by the immense Lines of Torres Vedras, two lines of fortifications constructed by Wellington. The fortifications appear impregnable, but Mass√©na, knowing that his army has no supplies for a long retreat, orders a probe into what appears to be an unfortified valley. The valley is defended by the South Essex and a Portuguese unit. Meanwhile, Lawford has posted the South Essex's Light Company as a picquet to give Slingsby another opportunity to distinguish himself. Instead, Slingsby disobeys Lawford's order to remain sober and is completely drunk when the French attack, forcing his junior lieutenant to take command. Ferreira and Ferragus arrive, claiming to have important information for Wellington, and Ferreira orders the lieutenant to accept a French demand for surrender, so that he and Ferragus can slip away. However, Sharpe and his party show up. They quickly subdue Ferreira and Ferragus, and Sharpe takes charge. The French attack, and in the confusion Ferragus breaks free and attacks Sharpe. During the fight, Sharpe backs Ferragus up against a window, where he is killed by French musket fire from outside. Under Sharpe's leadership, the Light Company successfully drives off the French, then employs a ruse thought up by Sharpe to drive off a second French force that was threatening to defeat the South Essex, brought up by Lawford to try to rescue the Light Company. Sharpe orders Ferreira be sent to Wellington, then asks Lawford if he should resume his duties as quartermaster. Lawford, having seen Slingsby's drunkenness and incompetence firsthand, irritably tells Sharpe to stop being \\"tedious.\\" Characters * Captain Richard Sharpe - OC Light Company, South Essex Regiment * Sergeant Patrick Harper - sergeant in the British army, close friend and ally to Richard Sharpe * Lieutenant Cornelius Slingsby - Sharpe's second-in-command * Major Pedro Ferreira - Portuguese Intelligence officer * Sarah Fry - stranded English governess * Luis Ferreira, a.k.a. \\"Ferragus\\" - Portuguese criminal, former slave trader and brother of Major Ferreira * Major Michael Hogan - engineer for the British army and intelligence officer * Colonel William Lawford - Sharpe's commanding officer * Captain Jorge Vicente - Portuguese army, Sharpe's friend * Joana Jacinto - Portuguese girl, saved from the sack of Coimbra by Sharpe and Harper * Rifleman Matthew Dodd - separated from the company during a battle; a homage to C.

Early life and career Scammon, a native of Whitefield, Maine, was appointed from his district to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, graduating 9th in the Class of 1837. He remained at West Point after graduation, serving as Assistant Professor of Mathematics from August 1837 to September 1838. Due to his ranking and abilities, he was selected as one of the original officers in the newly created U.S. Army Corps of Topographic Engineers in 1838. He served in the Seminole Wars and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, serving under Winfield Scott in the Army of Occupation. He was elevated to captain in 1853 and assigned to various surveying assignments, but was dismissed from the service on June 4, 1856. He moved to Ohio and became Professor of Mathematics at Mount Saint Mary's College, and then was President and Professor of Mathematics, Polytechnic College of the Catholic Institute in Cincinnati. He had converted to Catholicism in 1846. Civil War service With the outbreak of the Civil War, Scammon offered his services to William Dennison, the Governor of Ohio in June 1861 and was appointed as Colonel of the 23rd Ohio Infantry, commanding two men who would later become Presidents, Rutherford B. Hayes and William McKinley. The regiment saw action in western Virginia and then in the northern part of the state. Assigned to what became the IX Corps in the Army of the Potomac, Scammon then commanded the 1st Brigade, Kanawha Division. During the Maryland Campaign, he led his men in an attack up the slopes of South Mountain. When Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox briefly assumed command of the IX Corps, Scammon temporarily commanded the Kanawha Division, while Col. Hugh Ewing commanded Scammon's brigade. He fought well at the Battle of Antietam, where his men were counterattacked by late-arriving Confederate reinforcements under A.P. Hill. Scammon was appointed brigadier general of volunteers in October 1862, and fought in the major actions of the Kanawha Division. He often clashed with his subordinate, Rutherford B. Hayes.Peter Cozzens speech at the Hayes Presidential Center Scammon, by then a division commander, was captured by partisan guerrillas from the 16th Virginia Cavalry on February 3, 1864, when they raided a steamboat carrying General Scammon on the Kanawha River. He returned to duty in South Carolina after being exchanged. He was again captured along the South Carolina coast, but exchanged and when he returned to duty, was placed in command of a brigade in the Department of Florida. He was honorably mustered out in August 1865. Postbellum career Following the war, he was the U.S. Consul to Prince Edward Island and then Professor of Mathematics at Seton Hall College in New Jersey. Bowdoin College in Maine conferred the honorary Degree of A. M. on Scammon. Scammon died in New York City. He was buried in the Calvary Cemetery in Long Island City, New York. His brother, J. Young Scammon, became one of the wealthiest men in America as a Chicago attorney, newspaper owner, philanthropist and businessman. Another brother, Charles Melville Scammon is a famous whaleman, naturalist and author of Marine Mammals of the Northwestern Coast of North America (1874).

The lake has a total area of 54.5 km2, a maximum depth of 9 m, and an average depth of 4.8 m.Atlas of Alberta Lakes - Lac Ste. Anne Lac Ste. Anne lies at an elevation of 730 m, and has a drainage area of 619 km2. The eutrophic lake is formed along the Sturgeon River through which it drains into the North Saskatchewan River. Two islands are found at the western end of the lake, Farming Island and Horse Island, while the small Castle Island and tiny Rock Island lie at the eastern tip of the lake. Along the southern area coal mines generate power and employment, and recreational businesses have flourished because of the lakes. Agriculture is still a mainstay and the area is known for some of the best oat crops in Canada. History Lac Ste. Anne was first called Wakamne, or God's Lake by the Nakota Sioux, and Manitou Sakhahigan (Lake of the Spirit) by the Cree first nations before the arrival of the settlers. First Nations and Metis peoples hunted buffalo and fished in the lake called Manitou Sakhahigan. Legends told of a large serpent that lived in the lake. As it moved it created dangerous, unpredictable currents that could easily capsize a canoe. Very few people saw the serpent, but when the Hudson's Bay Company came employees renamed the lake Devil's Lake, which was a mistaken translation of the Cree name for it. The Cree name actually means Spirit Lake, because its a very sacred place. Elders of Alexis Reserve recall their grandparents telling of how as children they would go out on the lake and peer down through the then clear water to the lake bottom in search of the monster. They would hope and fear that they might see its legendary form. =Lac Ste. Anne Mission= Jean- Baptiste Thibault founder of the Lac Ste. Anne Mission The village of Lac Ste. Anne is one of the first permanent Metis communities in what later became Alberta and the first Catholic mission. Lac Ste. Anne (the original name is known as Manito-Sakahigan, Spirit Lake) was visited by Father Jean-Baptiste Thibault in 1842. Two year later in 1844 he established the Mission of Lac Ste. Anne. There were 30 French M√©tis families living here, who had come there in the 1830s, and the church served the Metis and First Nations of the area who had been converted to Catholicism. He renamed the lake Lac Ste. Anne, honouring Saint Anne.Spirit and Trails of Lac Ste. Anne (1982), p. 25 Lac Ste. Anne was in a central location with good fertile fields, tall trees for lumber, and plenty of fish and wildlife. It was also far away from the Hudson's Bay Company politics in Fort Edmonton. The missionaries began the teachings of the Church, and also taught the people how to farm. The people in the area could see the buffalo was declining and the missionaries wanted to make the Metis people into farmers. By 1859 the mission boasted it had 17 fat and fine cows, 15 horses, 10 dogs, 10 cats, and a garden with flowerbeds. Pigs and sheep were not raised because of the dogs and wild predators. Crops included wheat, barley, potatoes, cabbage, onions, and turnips. In 1859 three Grey Nuns made the journey from Montreal to the Mission., on September 24 Lac Ste. Anne welcomed the nuns. The Sisters began their lives in Lac Ste. Anne by learning the Cree language, starting a school, helping in the gardens and painting the windows of the church so that worshippers would not be distracted during services. The Mission grew until there were over two thousand people. A Hudson's Bay Company post, a separate school, an orphanage retreat, a North- West Mounted Police barracks, a dance hall, a post office, several stores, saloons and hotels moved into the area complementing the church, rectory and convent. At one time the mission was larger in population and commerce than Fort Edmonton. Father Lacombe, who arrived in 1852, left Lac Ste. Anne in 1861 to build a new mission at St. Albert. When he left the mission of Lac Ste. Anne it was almost deserted by pastors and followers of the church. All that was left were a few families, the church, the rectory and the Grey Nun's residence. =Lac Ste. Anne Pilgrimage= Father Lestanc organised the first pilgrimage to Lac Ste. Anne in 1889 in honour of Saint Anne whose feast day is on July 26. In 1926 over 5,500 pilgrims attended. Many came by a special train from the city of Edmonton 45 miles away. Today pilgrims come to the lake from all over North America, many walking miles bare-footed as penance to witness or be a part of the miracle of healing. A display of crutches and canes have been left behind in the shrine by pilgrims. Thirty to forty thousand people now attend the annual pilgrimage in the last week of July. Oaths of sobriety, along with other life style promises are made, and prayers and forgiveness are given. The Lac Ste. Anne Pilgrimage was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 2004 for its social and cultural importance. =Alberta Beach= Several miles east, Lac Ste. Anne was the hostess of more history. In 1912 the Alberta Northern Rail built the railroad to what is now Alberta Beach, it brought its employees out for company picnics and holidays. By 1920 they had incorporated the area as a summer village, built a dance pavilion, a large wooden pier, and several cabins. Other companies such as Marshall Wells and Woodwards then began to bring their employees out for the same relaxing and beautiful atmosphere. There was such a demand for this atmosphere that the Moonlight express was started. A.N.R. picked people up in Edmonton on Saturday mornings, took them to Alberta Beach., then picked them up Sunday night to take them back to Edmonton. Soon people began purchasing and building their own cabins and small businesses. On January 1, 1999, the Summer Village of Alberta Beach became a village. It now has 884 year-round residents and can swell to over 3,000 people during long weekends. A hotel and many small businesses operate within the village. Alberta Beach has developed in many ways while still preserving the reason for its popularity. The tranquility and beauty of the lake still draw admiration and provides relaxation to those who come to enjoy the area. =Hamlet of Gunn= In the 1900s the Hamlet of Gunn (named after Peter Gunn) was also developing as a major trade center, consisting mainly of M√©tis and Indian people. There were two flour mills, a blacksmith shop, the hotel, several stores and trading posts that nestled beside the train station. In the 1930s an Army training center was built where the Gunn housing center now operates. Prosperity reigned until the Army left and the C.N.R. removed its rail station. With it, many of the residents and businesses also left. Today all that remains is a combination store, laundromat, restaurant, car wash and a post office, community hall and university observation and research station, as well as the Gunn Housing and Senior's Center. =Castle Island= A French Viscount by the name of Charles de Caze, In the 1890s began building a castle on the small island located on the northeast shores of Lac Ste. Anne, which he named Constance Island, in honor of his only daughter. The castle was to be four stories high, built of stone. The walls were to be three feet thick crowning it was to be a stone battlement running all the way around. The castle was to be his retirement home but unfortunately he died at the age of 44 and did not complete his project. For many years, only the two stories of his dream castle remained to pique the curiosity of people stopping to picnic and enjoy the panoramic view of the lake. Approximately twenty years later a Mr. Shorty purchased the Island. He demolished the castle and transported several cabins to Constance Island. During prohibition it was an excellent spot for parties and fun. Years later he built a causeway which provided better access to the island. Eventually the Island was sold, renamed Castle Island, subdivided, and incorporated into a summer village. =Darwell= A rail station in 1912 also created the community of Darwell, located between Lac Ste. Anne and Isle Lake. The naming of this station caused many debates with no resolution, until an enterprising man took out his hymnbook and randomly picked a good tune. The tune had the name Darwell in it. It also became known throughout Alberta as Hobo stop because of a ranch which never turned away anyone asking for shelter. Many a man out of work rode the rail to Darwell to get food and lodging in exchange for work. As the story goes many a man wanted by the law also found refuge and the North-West Mounted Police spent many a trip going to the Hobo Ranch. Today Darwell boasts a store, garage, and school. The old ranch has long disappeared, but the hospitality of this community still exists today. Communities The Alexis Indian Reserve of the Alexis Nakoda Nation is located on the northern shore of the lake, and Alberta Beach is located on the southeastern shore. The Summer Villages of Ross Haven and Yellowstone, along with the subdivision of Corsair Cove, and the unincorporated hamlet of Gunn lie along the northern shore. The Summer Villages of Castle Island, Sunset Point and Val Quentin lie to either side of Alberta Beach. The Summer Village of West Cove lies on the southern shore of the west basin. Recreation Two campgrounds are located around the lake, one at Alberta Beach and the other at Gunn, on the north-eastern shore. There are also two golf courses in the immediate area, one at Alberta Beach, and the other in Ross Haven. There are two Bible Camps with lakefront property on Lac Ste. Anne, Ross Haven Bible Camp, located in Ross Haven, and run by the Canadian Sunday School Mission, and Sunset Point Christian Camp, in Sunset Point, and run by the Alberta Pentecostal Missions Society. Fishing is a popular recreational activity, species including whitefish, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch. Water based sports include sailing, water skiing and windsurfing in summer and snowmobiling and cross-country skiing in winter. References External links *Lac Ste. Anne Pilgrimage History *Lac Ste.

Design of Enterprise Systems: Theory, Architecture, and Methods, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, p. 3 As a discipline, it includes a body of knowledge, principles, and processes tailored to the design of enterprise systems. An enterprise is a complex, socio-technical system that comprises interdependent resources of people, information, and technology that must interact to fulfill a common mission. It accomplishes all of the tasks of \\"traditional\\" systems engineering, further informed by an expansive view of the context POET (political, operational, economic, technological) in which the system(s) under consideration are being developed, acquired, modified, maintained, or disposed of. Enterprise systems engineering may be required when the complexity being faced which breaks down the assumptions upon which textbook systems engineering is based, such as requirements being relatively stable and well understood, a system configuration that can be controlled, and a small, easily discernible set of stakeholders. Enterprise must produce different kind of analysis on the people, technology, components of the company in order to see the whole picture of the enterprise. As nowadays, enterprise becomes more complex with more problems and people to deal with, it is important to integrate the system in order to reach a higher standard or level for the business.  Elements  There are four important elements in order for enterprise system engineering to work. It includes development through adaption, strategic technical planning, enterprise governance and ESE processes (with different stages). = Development through adaptation = Development through adaptation is a way to compromise with the problems and obstacles in complex systems. As time goes by, the environment will change and it needs adaptation in order to develop continuously. To develop through adaption, something experiences different stages. For example, the mobile phone has gone through quite a few adaptations in its evolutionary development from the past. When it first released, the size of a mobile phone was enormous, but as they passed through generations of development phone became smaller. The development of mobile data from 1G to 4G made using phones faster and more convenient. To sum up, this refers to the process of creating diverse and innovative ideas and choices for the enterprise and selecting the one that will be most successful for the next generation. = Strategic technical planning = Strategic technical planning (STP) gives the enterprise the picture of their aim and objectives in the future and also an assessment on the process of organization. It brings a balance of assimilation and modernization to the enterprise. It has different components for STP. * Mission statement * Needs assessment * Technology descriptions and goal statement * Hardware and software requirement * Budget plan * Human Resources = Enterprise governance = It is defined as 'The set of responsibilities and practices exercised by the board and executive management with the goal of providing strategic direction, ensuring that objectives are achieved, ascertaining that risks are managed appropriately and verifying that the organisation‚Äôs resources are used responsibly.' according to (CIMA Official Terminology, 2005). Enterprise governance includes two aspects which are corporate governance (conformance) and business governance (performance). It is essential to understand the company and to know what must be done in order to succeed. It allows us to make the right decision on the choice of CEO and executives for the company, and also to identify the risks of the company.  Processes  There are four different steps in the Enterprise system engineering process. It includes technology planning (TP), capabilities-based engineering analysis (CBEA), enterprise architecture (EA) and enterprise analysis and assessment (EA&A;). = Technology planning = It is a step that searching and looking for key technologies for the enterprise. The aim of this step is to determine and associate all the innovative ideas and choose the technology that are useful for the enterprise to develop in a sustainable way.  Technology needs  We have to identify and look for the trend of the technology to decide what technology the company needs. It is important to understand what each of the technology can be achieved and will the characteristic of the technology fits in the company well. There are loads of technology-based decision need to be taken by the company such as deciding which computers to use, which software is suitable and useful for the company, how to build up a system to back up all the customer data or essential statistics for the company with high security. = Capabilities-based engineering analysis = It is an analysis method that focus on the essential elements that whole enterprise needs. It is a scheme that target the innovation and evolution of the capabilities. There is a set of essential steps for the analysis. The activities are dependent and it is conducted iteratively.  Purpose formulation  * Assess Stakeholders Interest ‚Äì To understand what the stakeholders want and like * Specify Outcome Spaces ‚Äì To find solutions for several conditions and the goal for the operations * Frame Capability Portfolios - To collect all the fundamental elements  Exploratory analysis  * Assess Performance and Cost ‚Äì To identify the performance and cost in different conditions and find solutions to improve * Explore concepts ‚Äì To search for new concepts and transform advanced capabilities * Determine the need for more variety ‚Äì To examine the risks and chances and decide whether new ways are needed  Evolutionary planning  * Assess Enterprise Impacts ‚Äì To investigate the effects on the enterprise in technical and capability aspects * Examine Evolution Strategies ‚Äì To explore and construct more strategies and evolution route * Develop Capability Road map ‚Äì Road map is a plan for the capability area which includes analysis and decision making which is a tool for assessment and development for the enterprise = Enterprise architecture = The prospective of Enterprise Architecture It is a model that illustrates the vision, network and framework of an organization. There are four aspects according to Microsoft's Michael Platt which are the prospective of business, application, information and technology. The diagram beside shows that structure of the Enterprise Architecture. The benefits of this step are improvement of the decision making for enterprise, increases the efficiency on the IT aspects and also minimize the loss of the organization. * Business ‚Äì The strategies and process by the operation of business * Application ‚Äì Interaction and communication along with the process used in the company * Information ‚Äì The logical data and statistics that the organization required to run properly and actively * Technology ‚Äì The software and hardware and different operation systems that used in the company All the elements are dependent and rely on each other in order to build the infrastructure. = Enterprise analysis and assessment = Enterprise analysis and assessment aim to find out if the enterprise is going to the right direction and help to do the correct decisions for the organization. It is strong advise to link with enterprise opportunity and risk assessment. There are also qualities that are required for this step such as aware of the suitable and capable technologies, to know and understand about C2 (Command and Control) issues and also the background picture of Modeling and simulation. There are various activities and actions for this event. # Multi-scale analysis # Early and continuous war fighter operational assessment # Lightweight, portable M&S-based; C2 capability representations # Developmental software versions available for assessment # Minimal infrastructure # Flexible modeling and simulation (M&S;), operator-in-the-loop (OITL), and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) capabilities # In-line, continuous performance monitoring and selective forensics.  Traditional systems engineering (TSE)  TSE refers to traditional systems engineering, which is a term to be defined as an engineering sub-system. = TSE = * TSE is composed and constructed by external designer * It is a stable system which it won't change automatically * Operation and development are independent with each other * Most of the components exclude people which therefore people do not play an important role in it * There are massive machines which have expected conduct There are differences between TSE and ESE. There are survey results comparing both of them. The survey result shown that TSE and ESE is complementary and interdependent with each other which ESE has a higher rating while TSE could also be a hidden element for ESE. So the combination of TSE and ESE will be ideal for an enterprise in this generation.  Applications  There are two types of ESE application: Information Enterprise Systems Engineering and Social Enterprise Systems Engineering. = Information Enterprise Systems Engineering (IESE) = It is a system that builds up to meet the requirements and expectations of different stakeholders in the organization. There must be an input device to collect the information and output device to satisfy the information needs. There are three different aspects for the framework of IESE # Functional View # Topology View # Physical View Also, there are different rules for the IESE model.Nikolaidou, M. and Alexopoulou, N. (2007). Enterprise Information System Engineering: A Model- based Approach based on the Zachman Framework. 1st ed. [pdf] Department of Informatics & Telecommunications, University of Athens, Athens, Greece: arokopio University of Athens, Athens, Greece, pp.1-10. Available at: https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hicss/2008/3075/00/30750399.pdf [Accessed 3 Nov. 2015]. * Interchangeable point of view * Detailed views and well displayed. Showing the specific method, solution and techniques * Consistent views * Supported viewpoints = Social Enterprise System Engineering = This is a framework that involves planning, analyzing, mapping and drawing a network of the process for enterprises and stakeholders. Moreover, it creates social value for entrepreneurship and explores and focuses on the social and societal issues. It forms a connection between social enterprise and system engineering. There is a Social Enterprise Systems Engineering V-model, in which two or more social elements are established based on the system engineering framework‚Äîfor example, more social interface analysis that reviews stakeholders' requirements, and more activities and interactions between stakeholders to exchange opinions.  Opportunity and risk management  There are opportunities and risks in ESE and they have to be aggressive in seeking opportunities and also finding ways to avoid or minimize the risks. Opportunity is a trigger element that may lead to the accomplishment of objectives. Risk is a potential occurrence and will affect the performance of the entire system.White, B. (2006). Enterprise Opportunity and Risk. 1st ed. [pdf] 202 Burlington Road Bedford, MA: INCOSE, pp.3-6. Available at: https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/05_1262.pdf [Accessed 3 Nov. 2015]. There are several reasons for the importance of risk management. # To identify the risks before head which can prepare actions to prevent or minimize the risks # Since risks can cost the enterprise, determining the risk events can reduce the amount of loss # Help to know how to allocate the human or technology resources in order avoid the most critical risks There are few steps in Enterprise risk and opportunity Management Process * Prepare the risk and opportunity plan ‚Äì Select team and representatives * Identify Risks ‚Äì Complete risks statements for each risk * Identify Opportunities ‚Äì People that work at tactical level and manager must understand the opportunities in order to take a further action * Evaluate the Enterprise Risks and Opportunities ‚Äì To decide which is more critical and vital * Develop the plan ‚Äì Develop after identification and evaluation with different strategies  See also  * Enterprise architecture * Enterprise engineering * Enterprise life cycle * Industrial engineering * Systems engineering * Soft systems methodology * System of systems * System of systems engineering (SoSE) * Risk management plan * Technology roadmap References Further reading * R.E.

Judge Lopez made legal history as the first Latina appointed to the bench in Massachusetts when she was selected as a District Court Judge by Governor Michael Dukakis. Judge Lopez continued to make her mark in history as the first Latina to be appointed to the Massachusetts Superior Court in 1993. Lopez served as a Superior Court judge and as an assistant attorney general in civil rights division of the office of the Massachusetts Attorney General. She is married to Stephen Mindich, owner of the Boston Phoenix newspaper; they live in Newton, Massachusetts. She has two sons, Michael Michaud (born in 1983) and David Michaud (born in 1985), who both attended the University of Michigan; they are her sons from her first marriage to Richard Michaud. Lopez holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government from Smith College and a Juris Doctor from Boston University. Demoulas Versus Demoulas Case In the 1990s, then Judge Lopez presided over the civil trial for control of shares in the DeMoulas supermarket chain. The trial and subsequent appeals process made this one of the largest and longest civil lawsuits in Massachusetts history. In addition to its length and cost, the trial was notable for attempts by lawyers of Telemachus \\"Mike\\" Demoulas to have Judge Lopez removed from the case due to allegations of bias after the jury found that he had defrauded his late brother George's family of shares in the family owned business. After numerous appeals however, Judge Lopez's rulings were upheld. Allegations of misconduct were raised by Lopez's former law clerk, Paul M. Walsh against attorneys for Telemachus Demoulas. He alleged that he was lured to Nova Scotia under the pretext of a job interview, only to be queried for information the lawyers could then use to prove bias on the part of Judge Lopez. In October 2006, the state Board of Bar Overseers issued a recommendation to disbar lawyers Gary C. Crossen and Kevin P. Curry, and issue a three-year suspension to lawyer Richard K. Donahue based on their conduct in the Walsh incident. In December 2006, Donahue accepted the three-year suspension from practicing law. In January 2008, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court unanimously agreed with the recommendation of the board and ordered Crossen and Curry disbarred. Both lawyers will have to wait eight years before they can apply for readmission to the bar. Charles \\"Ebony\\" Horton Case Charles \\"Ebony\\" Horton was tried for and pleaded guilty to kidnapping, assault with intent to rape a child under 16, indecent assault and battery on a child under 14, assault and battery, and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. Horton, while dressed as a woman, used a ruse to lead an 11-year-old boy to an abandoned warehouse where he forced the boy to simulate sex acts after holding a screwdriver to the child's neck. During the sentencing phase of the trial, Suffolk County District Attorney David Deakin who had asked Lopez to give Horton an eight-to- ten-year jail sentence, tried to protest her decision to sentence Horton to house arrest and five years of probation. Judge Lopez, who was angered by the presence of members of the media, proceeded to upbraid the prosecutor as she suspected he had alerted the press. During her outburst, she angered members of the victim's family by referring to the case as a \\"low-level\\" offense. Judge Lopez's decision also angered residents of the Mary Ellen McCormack housing development in South Boston where Horton would serve his house arrest. Horton was later evicted from the housing development based on the conviction. The sentencing caused politicians in the state including then Governor Paul Cellucci to suggest that mandatory minimum sentencing should be enacted by statute to remove judicial discretion in cases such as Horton's. Three years later the Massachusetts Commission on Judicial Conduct found that Lopez had abused her office and lied under oath and that she ought to apologize and serve a six-month suspension. Retired Judge E. George Daher who headed the commission's investigation, suggested Judge Lopez should not be punished for her in-court behavior, but for her \\"feeble attempt at coverup\\". This was the same Judge Daher who had presided over the eviction hearings for Horton when he served as Boston Housing Court Chief in 2000. Rather than apologizing and accepting a suspension, Judge Lopez resigned on May 19, 2003. > I sincerely apologize for my loss of temper in court. Accepting the > recommendation of the hearing officer that I be suspended for six months and > publicly endorse his findings would no doubt be the easiest and most > expeditious way to maintain my judicial position. However, I cannot dishonor > my 14 years on the bench, my principles, or the Massachusetts Judiciary by > admitting to that which I did not do, Lopez wrote. > Fighting would require that we continue on a road that would subject her > family and herself to this constant kind of morass that has been going on. > She has simply decided that it is not worth it. Her effectiveness on the > bench would be compromised after these proceedings. She has become a > lightning rod for both the media and public opinion. It was her decision to > step down, Lopez's own attorney, Richard Egbert, stated. On April 14, 2020, 42-year-old Level 3 sex offender, Charles \\"Ebony\\" Horton was again arrested, for kidnapping and assault charges after the suspect allegedly threatened young boys at gunpoint. A 12-year old victim stated the suspect had friended him on Facebook and began messaging him. The victim stated that the suspect knew where he lived and would send someone to hurt him. Eventually, the suspect demanded that the boy meet him at a restaurant in the area of Seaver Street and Humboldt Avenue. The boy complied out of fear, police said. When the boy got to the location, the suspect guided him to the rear of a building near 100 Seaver St. and then entered a building, police said. ‚ÄúThe victim stated the suspect removed a firearm from a green shopping bag before forcing the victim to access his Facebook account. When a police cruiser passed by the area, the suspect ran off. As detectives started to investigate, they discovered other similar cases. On Jan. 2, a juvenile boy told officers that a suspect kidnapped him and threatened him with a firearm near 500 Columbia Road. And on Oct. 28, another juvenile boy told police that a suspect kidnapped him and threatened him with a firearm near 150 Columbia Road, according to the news release.  Television show  On September 11, 2006, Judge Maria Lopez debuted, a half-hour show where real life disputants come to settle a case. An episode may include two smaller cases or one big case, such as \\"The Dirty Videographer Was A Lemon\\". After one year on the air, the Judge Maria Lopez ranked last among nine syndicated judge shows, only gathering a Nielsen household rating of 1.0. Among all 160 syndicated shows ranked, the Judge Maria Lopez show placed 118th in viewership. Despite its low ratings, Sony Pictures renewed the series for a second season. However, in February 2008 reports indicated that after two seasons of low ratings the show would be canceled.

The set consists of the Keystone, a stone bowl, and the Decalogue with its sandstone box. They can be viewed at the Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum in Coshocton, Ohio.Robert Alrutz (1980). \\"The Newark Holy Stones: The History of an Archaeological Tragedy,\\" Journal of the Scientific Laboratories, Denison University, 57: 1-57. Copies available from Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum The site where the objects were found is known as The Newark Earthworks, one of the biggest collections from an ancient American Indian culture known as the Hopewell that existed from approximately 100 BC to AD 500. Discovery The Decalogue The first of these artifacts, popularly known as the Keystone due to its shape, was excavated in June 1860. Unlike other ancient artifacts found previously in this region, the Keystone was inscribed with Hebrew. It contains one phrase on each side: *Holy of Holies *King of the Earth *The Law of God *The Word of God The second find came later in November 1860 when Wyrick and his excavation team came across a sandstone box which contained a small, black rock within it. The black rock was identified as limestone by geologists Dave Hawkins and Ken Bork of Denison University. On this stone were carved Hebrew text that was translated as a condensed version of the Ten Commandments. The name Decalogue Stone, comes from the translation of the Hebrew letters that outline the religious and moral codes described in Exodus 20:2-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21, which refer to the Decalogue or Ten Commandments. The inscription begins on the front at the top of an arch above the figure of a bearded man who is wearing a turban, robe, and appears to be holding a tablet. It runs down the left side, continues around all sides, and makes its way back to the front up the right side to where it began. This pattern indicates that the inscription was meant to be read repetitively. Right above the figure of the man is a separate inscription which translates to \\"Moses\\". This rock was carved with a unique form of Hebrew, which gave the appearance of ancient post-Exilic square Hebrew letters that later was shown to be derived from the modern Hebrew alphabet.Feder, K.L., Barnhart, T. Bolnick, D.A., and Lepper, B.T., 2016. Lessons Learned from Lost Civilizations. In Card, J.J. and Anderson, D.S. eds., Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices.University of Alabama Press, pp. 167-184. The Keystone Radiocarbon date of wooden platform In 2014, Bradley Lepper of the Ohio History Connection discovered that a fragment of the wooden burial platform underneath which the Decalogue Stone was found had been preserved at Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History. This sample yielded a calibrated radiocarbon date range of CAL AD 85 to CAL AD 135 (95% probability). Since the platform had been made from an approximately 2-foot diameter oak tree, the burial itself could have been several decades later than this tree growth. These dates are consistent with the Hopewell culture that would have constructed the mound. Retrieved 12 March 2017.Beta Analytic Inc., Radiocarbon Dating Result for Sample ANT.003744 YPM.02624, June 1, 2015. Historical context The Newark Holy Stones are an archaeological fraud used to support the \\"Lost Tribes\\" theory, which posits an ancient Israelite presence in Ohio. The idea that there is a connection between the ancient Hopewell mound builders and Jewish settlers that were in the Americas before Columbus is a form of pseudoarchaeology. The first stone to be found was written in modern Hebrew. In July 1860 Abraham Geiger wrote in the New York Times that \\"the bungling work of an unskilled stone mason and the strangeness of some letters as well as the many mistakes and transpositions was his fault. The letters are not antique. This is not a relic of hoary antiquity\\". Just over three months later, the second stone was found. This was not only considerably more elaborate, it was written in archaic Hebrew. Ken Feder compares this with someone today announcing that they had discovered a hitherto unknown play by Shakespeare which was then exposed as a modern forgery, then shortly thereafter announcing the discovery of a more plausible new play.Kenneth L. Feder, Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The Walam Olum, pages 192-193(Greenwood, 2010). It is possible that the stones were forged to support a political viewpoint. Brad Lepper, of the Ohio Historical Society who has extensively studied the Hopewell culture, suggests that the artifacts might have been scientifically forged to help advance the theory on monogenism. In 1860, slavery was a subject of heated debate that was reaching a critical point in American society. Anthropology and other forms of science were often used in defense or opposition. Discussions promoting monogenism, for example, were often used to oppose slavery and segregation. Hoax theories =David Wyrick= Among some of the hoax theories is that Wyrick faked the artifacts and planted them at the excavation sites. Prior to his discovery, Wyrick supported the belief that the Lost Tribes of Israel were the ancestors of ancient mound builders in Ohio. Wyrick spent a great deal of time searching a number of excavation sites at various mounds attempting to find supporting evidence of this belief. Some argue that Wyrick could have become more desperate as time went by providing the motivation to commit such an act. In 1861, Wyrick published a pamphlet that described his account of the artifact discoveries. The publishing included woodcuts of the inscriptions found on the stones. When comparing Wyrick's woodcuts of the Decalogue to the actual inscription found on the stone, Wyrick made at least 38 errors involving 256 Hebrew letters. Mistakes include illegible and omitted letters. Wyrick's depiction of Moses on the woodcuts had inconsistencies as well. Wyrick shows Moses wearing a beret instead of a turban. He also shows Moses in a 19th-century dress instead of the flowering robe shown on the stone. Some believe that the person or group responsible for the inscription had to have an extensive knowledge of the Hebrew language. Given that Wyrick made a large number of mistakes on the woodcuts seem to indicate that he may not have been the stone's author. Beverley H. Moseley, Jr., former art director of the Ohio Historical Society, compared the carving of Moses on the stone to Wyrick's woodcut copy. He concluded that both images couldn't have been made by the same person. After Wyrick's death, Colonel Charles Whittlesey published a paper in 1872 in which he recalls discovering a Hebrew Bible among Wyrick's personal items. Whittlesey concludes at the time that the stones were a hoax, and assumed that the Bible was Wyrick's source of inspiration for the inscription. This theory was later discredited after it was determined that the letters used on the Decalogue did not represent a style that would have been consistent with the theory. The Hebrew version used in the inscriptions is another point of contention. The version used was post-Exilic, which would not be from a \\"Lost\\" Tribe. Some believe this is another example that shows the artifacts were either a hoax or did not date back to the time of the mound builders. Wyrick also made a claim in a letter he wrote to Joseph Henry in 1863‚Äîone year before his death‚Äîthat he might have been a victim of a hoax. =Rev. John W. McCarty and stonecutter Elijah Sutton= Rev. John W. McCarty and Elijah Sutton were both residents of Newark when the Decalogue Stone and the Keystone were found. Elijah Sutton was a stonecutter with no other direct link to the event other than his part in carving Wyrick's headstone when he died. However, it is asserted that because the Decalogue Stone is made from similar materials and is of the same width (thickness) as his headstones, he must have cut the stone. As for Rev. John W. McCarty, he played a more direct role in the artifact's discovery. It was with the help of McCarty that the stone was translated. Upon receiving the stone McCarty was able to translate it within hours. It is also likely that many Christian clergy supported the idea of the Lost Tribes myth during the 1800s, for it not only would have validated the biblical tale of the Lost Tribes but also implied their religious right to continue to colonize America and their Christianization of the Native Americans. =Source for the design= Archaeologist Brad Lepper believes that the inspiration for the Decalogue stone was Austen Henry Layar's book Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon. Layard's work had become a sensation at the time and McCarty had access to it and given his profession would have taken an interest in it. Lepper writes that a stone carving on a temple entrance \\"looked very familiar. In fact, it duplicated, in great detail, the form of the Decalogue Stone. Compare the images for yourself. Both have a tombstone-shaped frame with a bearded man shown in left profile and the left arm of both men is bent. Both men are wearing long gowns and have some sort of domed head-covering. Finally, there is an inscription arcing over the heads of both men.\\" Related discoveries There were other stones found at the Newark site, like the Keystone. Two other stones were also found at Newark shortly after Wyrick's death (they have since been lost). These stones were quickly dismissed as fakes when the local dentist, John H. Nicol, claimed that he had carved and introduced the stones to the site. A fifth stone was allegedly found at the same site as the Decalogue stone two years later by David M. Johnson, a banker, and Nathaniel Roe Bradner, a physician. Named the Johnson-Bradner Stone, it has since been lost. A lithograph of the stone, published in France, still survives.

It is a central part of the festival of Thaipusam and emphasizes debt bondage. The kavadi (\\"burden\\") itself is a physical burden, the bearing of which is used by the devotee to implore Murugan for assistance, usually on behalf of a loved one who is in need of healing, or as a means of balancing a spiritual debt.Hume, Lynne. Portals. Devotees process and dance along a pilgrimage route while bearing these burdens. Kavadi attam, India. Origin The kavadi aattam is steeped in mythology. At Mount Kailas, Lord Shiva entrusted the dwarf saint sage Agastya with two hillocks, the Shivagiri Hill and the Shaktigiri Hill, with instructions to carry and install them in South India. The sage left them in a forest and later asked his disciple, Idumban, to get them. Idumban found the two hillocks but could not initially lift them, until he obtained divine help. Near Palani in South India -- where there is a famous shrine of Murugan -- Idumban put the hillocks down to rest awhile. When he attempted to continue with his journey, he found that the hillocks were immovable. Idumban sought the help of a scantily dressed youth, but the youth claimed the hillocks belonged to him. In the ensuing scuffle, Idumban was defeated. Idumban then realised that the youth was Lord Murugan. At this stage, Muruga had been outwitted in a contest for going round the world where his brother Ganapati had won the prized fruit. In anger, the frustrated child left the divine parents and came down to Tiru Avinankudi at the Adivaram (pronounced Adiv√¢ram and means foot of the Sivagiri Hill). Siva pacified Him by saying that He (Subrahmanya) Himself was the fruit (pazham) of all wisdom and knowledge. Later, Murugan withdrew to the hill and settled there as a recluse in peace and solitude. Muruga had been made it impossible for Idumban to lift the hillocks. In the fierce battle that ensued, Idumban was killed but was later on restored to life. Idumban prayed that whoever carried on his shoulders the kavadi -- signifying the two hills -- and visited the temple on a vow should be blessed and that He (Idumban)should be given the privilege of standing sentinel at the entrance to the hill. Hence the Idumban shrine is halfway up the hill where every pilgrim is expected to offer obeisance to Idumban before entering the temple of Dand√¢yudhapani. Since then, pilgrims to Palani bring their offerings on their shoulders in a kavadi aattam. The custom has spread from Palani to all Muruga shrines worldwide. Preparation The preparations start 48 days before the two-day Thaipusam festival. The devotees purge themselves of all mental and physical impurities. They take only one vegetarian meal per day and 24 hours before Thaipusam, they must maintain a complete fast. The devotees prepare themselves by following strict purification austerities that include: * Transcendence of desire * Shaving of the head * Following a vegetarian diet and refraining from alcohol * Sexual abstinence * Bathing in cold water * Sleeping on the floor * Constant prayers Bearing the kavadi On the day of the festival, devotees undertake a pilgrimage along a set route while engaging in various acts of devotion, notably carrying various types of kavadi (burdens). At its simplest this may entail carrying a pot of milk (pal kavadi), but piercing the skin, tongue or cheeks with vel skewers is also common. A more elaborate kavadi consists of two semicircular pieces of wood or steel which are bent and attached to a cross structure that can be balanced on the shoulders of the devotee. It is often decorated with flowers and peacock feathers (the vehicle of God Murugan) among other things. Some of the kavadi can weigh up to 30 kg. The most spectacular practice is the vel kavadi, essentially a portable altar up to two meters tall, decorated with peacock feathers and attached to the devotee through 108 vels pierced into the skin on the chest and back. Fire walking and flagellation may also be practiced. It is claimed that devotees are able to enter a trance, feel no pain, do not bleed from their wounds and have no scars left behind. thumb  Thaipusam outside of India  Thaipusam is celebrated in many different countries outside of India mainly in Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Singapore, Malaysia, Reunion island and by their Diaspora in western countries such as UK, Germany, France, Italy, South Africa etc. Picture gallery File:Kavadi ritual DSCN0216.JPGKavadi attam in Kerala, India File:Kaavadi 1.JPGPookkavadi File:Kavadi dancer 6039398.jpgkavadi attam in Germany File:Thaipusam3.jpgDevotees carry pal kavadi at Thaipusam festival See also * Batu Caves * Kanwar Yatra * Yajna * Nagarathar Kavadi References External links *tamilnadu-tourism.com Category:Objects used in Hindu worship Category:Rituals in Hindu worship Category:Yajna Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Kaumaram ","title":"Kavadi Aattam"},{"id":"7649228","text":"Yugh people (pronounced ; often written Yug) are a Yeniseian people, an indigenous group who originally lived throughout central Siberia.

His feast day is 11 March. He is called a spiritual follower of Saint Eligius (Saint Eloi). Traditionally, his birthplace is given as Bullecourt, near Bapaume. This is the birthplace indicated in the documents dating much later than the saint's death, but which claim to reproduce an ancient local tradition. Nothing is known of his early years. On the death of St. Aubert, Bishop of Cambrai-Arras (about 668), Vindicianus was elected his successor. In any case he was bishop of this see in the reign of Theuderic III of Neustria (about 673). The author of the Gesta episcoporum Cameracensium (written 1024/1025, but generally trustfull) declares that he didn't know the duration of the episcopate of Vindicianus. Legend has crept into the history of the holy bishop, but the following facts may be regarded as certain. In 673 Vindicianus supervised the translation of the body of St. Maxellende to Caudri. In the same year he consecrated the monastery of Honnecourt sur l'Escaut, which was given in 685 to St. Bertin. In 675 he signed a charter of donation in favour of the abbey at Maroilles, rendered illustrious by St. Humbert (Emebertus). In the same year he consecrated the church at Hasnon. He was probably in relation with St. Arnaud of Tongeren, since we find his signature to the latter's testament in 679. In 681 he claimed for his diocese the honour of possessing the body of St. L√©ger, the unfortunate victim of the political strife which was then filling Neustria with blood, but he did not succeed, the remains of St. L√©ger being confided to Ansoald, Bishop of Poitiers. His predecessor, St. Aubert, had founded the Monastery of St. Vaast, the building of which he had been unable to complete; Vindicianus finished it, apparently in 682, and placed it temporalities under the protection of Thierry III, who conferred numerous gifts on the monastery. In 685 a certain Hatta was placed at its head by Vindicianus. In the following year the latter dedicated the church at Hamaye, and acted at the exhumation of the bodies of Sts. Eusebia and Gertrude, who had been abbesses of the monastery of that name. The events of his life after this date (686) are unknown. He was buried at Mont- St-Eloi. The region was ravaged by the Normans in the ninth century, and on more than one occasion the relics of the saint were in danger, until in 1030 Bishop Gerard I of Cambrai had his body removed to the episcopal city. After having been at Douai and Arras, the relics were returned to Mont-St-Eloi in 1453.

He has a Diploma in Labour Relations and Law. He was an industrial officer with the Public Service Professional Officers Association and then with the Australian Workers' Union from 1978 to 1995, then assistant national secretary of the Police Federation of Australia and New Zealand from 1997 to 1999. Since 1999 he has run his own business advising companies and unions on mediation issues. Political career At the 2005 Werriwa by-election Hayes polled 55.54 percent of the primary vote, a 2.90-point increase from the October 2004 election. This was seen as a good result for Labor, although the Liberal Party did not contest the by-election. At the 2010 federal election, he moved to the seat of Fowler following a redistribution to allow Laurie Ferguson, whose seat of Reid had been substantially changed, to contest Werriwa.

The cover on some editions of the book read \\"A primer for adults only\\" while other editions read \\"A primer for tender young minds\\" instead. Humor Much of the humor derives from a cynical drive to give the reader misleading, harmful advice. A portion of the book originally appeared in a slightly different form in Playboy magazine. Silverstein urges the reader to keep termites as pets, play hopscotch with real Scotch whisky and give their father a haircut while he sleeps. He tells the reader that \\"Mommy loves the baby more than she loves you\\", and he uses the letter \\"E\\", first, to discourage the reader from ever wanting to eat eggs, and then, to encourage the reader to throw eggs up to the ceiling: :E is for egg. :See the egg. :The egg is full of slimey gooey white stuff and icky yellow stuff. :Do you like to eat eggs? :E is also for Ernie. :Ernie is the genie who lives in the ceiling. :Ernie loves eggs. :Take a nice fresh egg and throw it as high as you can and yell \\"Catch, Ernie!

He is best remembered as the co-author of the light opera Tom Jones (1907) and the producer of The Arcadians (1909). He was the father of the actress Cicely Courtneidge, who played in many of his early 20th century productions. Courtneidge began as a comic actor in the late 1870s, working with Kate Santley, George Edwardes and others. In the early 1890s, he toured in Australia with Edwardes and J. C. Williamson companies. In 1896, he became a theatre manager in Manchester and then a West End theatre producer. In the first years of the 20th century, he began to direct musical theatre pieces and to write or co-write the book for some of his productions, including Tom Jones (1907). His most popular productions included The Arcadians (1909), Princess Caprice (1912), Oh! Oh! Delphine (1913) and The Cinema Star (1914). He directed the hit musical The Boy in 1917. After the war, he presented Paddy the Next Best Thing, which had a long run, and then took a touring company to Australia, presenting a repertory of comedies. In the 1920s, he returned to producing British provincial tours and became the lessee of the Savoy Theatre, presenting a mixture of productions ranging from Shakespeare to farce. A lifelong socialist, he joined with other managers in campaigning for fair pay and treatment of actors. He also returned briefly to acting. Later in the decade, he presented more West End musicals and operettas, producing his last show in 1930. In 1933 he wrote a novel, Judith Clifford.

He toured with the Charles Dillon and Barry Sullivan companies,\\"Robert Courtneidge\\", British Musical Theatre, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 10 August 2011 and later with Kate Santley playing Hamet Abensellah in Vetah (1886).\\"Vetah\\", The Era, 4 September 1886, p. 14 In 1885 he played Mr. Drinkwater in H.J.

In 1892 Courtneidge and his wife went to Australia, where he played comic roles for George Edwardes's Gaiety company in the burlesques, Carmen up to Data, Faust up to Date, Miss Esmeralda and Joan of Arc. He and his wife remained in Australia during 1893 and 1894; he joined the J. C.

The following year, reviewing his progress to date, The Manchester Guardian wrote: The Blue Moon, 1905 Courtneidge remained in charge of the Prince's Theatre until 1903, but he also gained a footing as a producer and director in the West End of London. In 1898, he produced the successful George Dance and Carl Kiefert musical The Gay Grisette. Among his later productions in Manchester was A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1901, in which Bottom was played by W.H. Denny and the tiny role of Peaseblossom was played by Courtneidge's eight-year-old daughter Cicely, making her stage debut.\\"The Theatres\\", The Manchester Guardian, 24 September 1901, p. 5 On leaving Manchester after seven years, Courtneidge was presented with a scroll inscribed by members of the theatrical profession headed by Henry Irving and the local community headed by C.P.

George Edwardes invited him to direct Ivan Caryll's comic opera, The Duchess of Dantzic, in 1903. As an independent West End producer, Courtneidge began in 1905 with The Blue Moon.\\"The Blue Moon\\", The Play Pictorial, May 1905, pp. 121‚Äì36 He soon began collaborating on the books of musicals that he produced, although in some cases he contributed only the minimum needed to allow him to claim an interest in the copyright and royalties of the piece. Among the works credited to him as co-librettist are The Dairymaids (1906) and Tom Jones (1907). In 1909, Courtneidge became lessee of the Shaftesbury Theatre. In the same year, he had his biggest success, with The Arcadians, which ran for more than 800 performances. This was followed in 1911 by The Mousm√©, an oriental piece in a vein already familiar from The Mikado, The Geisha and San Toy.\\"New Japanese Play\\", The Observer, 10 September 1911, p. 8 Despite a lavish production, including a spectacular earthquake scene,\\"Shaftesbury Theatre ‚Äì The Mousm√©\\", The Times, 11 September 1911, p. 9 it was only modestly successful. In 1912, Courtneidge joined several other theatre managers in opposing an attempt to abolish theatre censorship. The managers believed that a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to present a piece insured them against legal action by the police, local authority or anyone else. Among those whom Courtneidge joined in this successful opposition were Edwardes, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Charles Frohman, Gerald du Maurier and Rupert D'Oyly Carte.\\"Theatre Managers and the Censorship ‚Äì Petition to the King\\", The Times, 1 April 1912, p. 12 In the same year, Courtneidge presented an English version of Leo Fall's Der liebe Augustin, as Princess Caprice, with a cast including Courtice Pounds and Courtneidge's daughter Cicely.\\"The Theatres\\", The Times, 6 May 1912, p. 12. There was some feeling in theatrical circles that Cicely's elevation to star status was due more to her being Robert Courtneidge's daughter than to any special talent. The Boy, directed by Courtneidge in 1917 Of Courtneidge's two productions in 1913, Ivan Caryll's American musical Oh! Oh! Delphine received a strong reception, but The Pearl Girl was only a moderate success. In 1914 Cicely Courtneidge and Jack Hulbert starred in The Cinema Star, an adaptation by Hulbert and Harry Graham of Die Kino-K√∂nigin, a 1913 German comic opera by Jean Gilbert. It was a hit for Courtneidge and ran to full houses at the Shaftesbury Theatre until Britain and Germany went to war in August 1914; anti-German sentiment brought the run to a premature and abrupt halt. Courtneidge's next shows, My Lady Frayle, Oh, Caesar! and The Light Blues (all 1916, the last of which included a young No√´l Coward in its cast)\\"Chronology\\", No√´l Coward Society, accessed 10 August 2011 all failed,Gaye, p. 492 and the patriotic operetta Young England was only a modest success. After these financial setbacks, Courtneidge next produced less expensive extravaganzas in the provinces, including Oh, Caesar! Petticoat Fair, Fancy Fair (the last two of which he wrote) and Too Many Girls. He directed the hit musical The Boy (1917) at the Adelphi Theatre. =1920s and 30s= Courtneidge (centre) with conductor Hamish MacCunn (left) and composer Paul Rubens In 1920, Courtneidge presented the non-musical comedy Paddy the Next Best Thing at the Savoy Theatre.

In 1923, he became the lessee of the Savoy, where his first production was The Young Idea by the 22-year-old Coward.\\"The Theatres ‚Äì Mr. Courtneidge's Plans\\", The Times, 13 November 1922, p. 10 He followed this with a mixture of productions ranging from Shakespeare to farce.\\"The Theatres\\", The Times, 28 August 1924, p. 8 During the 1920s, Courtneidge, a lifelong socialist, joined with other managers including Arthur Bourchier in campaigning for fair pay for chorus members and players of small parts. Many other managements lagged behind in this, for instance not paying salaries during rehearsals. Courtneidge said in 1924, \\"There is a large section of theatrical managers who will not deal justly. The actor is again forced to the wall, and compelled to fight for his rights.\\"\\"Stage Guild Contract Denounced ‚Äì Mr. Courtneidge's Appeal\\", The Times, 9 September 1924, p. 10 He had earlier resigned from the Actors' Association, of which he had been a founder member, disagreeing with its closed shop policy, but his indignation at a proposed new standard contract for actors led him to rejoin.This contract, between managers and the non-union Stage Guild, abolished the minimum period of engagement, allowed managers to pay some cast members less than the minimum wage, and provided for the instant dismissal of any performer not word perfect after the third rehearsal. Courtneidge called these terms \\"scandalously unfair.\\" See \\"Stage Guild Contract Denounced ‚Äì Mr. Courtneidge's Appeal\\", The Times, 9 September 1924, p. 10 In 1925, Courtneidge returned briefly to acting. After a tryout at his old Manchester theatre, the Prince's, he brought the old farce On 'Change to the Savoy, winning good notices for his performance in the leading role of a vain and touchy Scottish professor, which he had first played in the 1880s.Manchester First Nights\\", The Manchester Guardian, 4 June 1925, p. 11\\"Savoy Theatre ‚Äì 'On 'Change'\\", The Times, 29 June 1925, p. 16 Although Cicely had made her career away from his management since World War I, Courtneidge regularly featured his younger daughter Rosaline in his casts, in such plays as The Sport of Kings (1924) and The Unfair Sex (1925), until her early death in 1926 at the age of 23.\\"Miss Rosaline Courtneidge\\", The Times, 9 December 1926, p. 11 Courtneidge returned to presenting West End musical shows in 1927, directing Leh√°r's The Blue Mazurka (1927) with English lyrics by Harry Graham at Daly's Theatre.\\"Daly's Theatre ‚Äì 'The Blue Mazurka'\\", The Times, 21 February 1927, p. 10 His last London musical was The Damask Rose (1930), an attempt to emulate with Chopin's music the success of Lilac Time, a piece written around Schubert's music.

It is a not- for-profit private organization, inaugurated in 2002 by the Brazilian collector and businessman Ricardo Brennand. It comprises a museum, an art gallery, a library and a large park. The Institute holds a permanent collection of historic and artistic objects of diversified provenience, ranging from Early Middle Ages to 20th century, with strong emphasis in objects, documents and artwork related to Colonial and Dutch Brazil, including the world's largest assemblage of paintings by Frans Post. The Institute also houses one of the largest collections of armory in the world, with 3,000 pieces, the majority of which were produced in Europe and Asia between the 14th and 19th centuries. The library has over 62 thousand volumes, ranging from 16th to 20th century, including a collection of brasiliana and other rare items. History The Institute was created by Ricardo Brennand (Cabo de Santo Agostinho, 27 May 1927 ‚Äî Recife, 25 April 2020), a Brazilian collector and businessman of English ancestry, born in Cabo de Santo Agostinho in 1927. Brennand established several factories in the Northeast Region of the country, acting in the segments of cement, tiles, glass, porcelain and sugar production. He started collecting armory, specially melee weapons, in the 1940s. In the following decades, his collection would grow in size and importance, becoming one of the largest such ensembles in the world. In 1990, Brennand decided to sell some of his factories, gathering the financial resources needed to establish a museum with the aim of preserving and exhibiting his holdings. Prior to the Institute opening, he also became interested in acquiring works of art, beside objects related to Brazilian history. He chose to focus his new acquisitions on the 17th century period of the Dutch occupation of Brazilian Northeast. In five years, Brennand acquired a large group of canvases by Frans Post, as well as 17th-century Dutch landscape and portrait paintings, maps, tapestries, objects, coins, documents and rare books, all of which acquainted to the Dutch rule in Brazil. The Ricardo Brennand Institute was inaugurated in September 2002, with an exhibition devoted to Albert Eckhout, displaying for the first time outside Europe all of his paintings done in Brazil, which belong to the National Museum of Denmark. In 2003, the Institute opened the permanent exhibition Frans Post and Dutch Brazil in the collection of Instituto Ricardo Brennand, inaugurated by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, on the occasion of her visit to Brazil. Beside permanent and temporary exhibitions, the Institute offers courses on history of art, educational program devoted to students of public and private schools of Pernambuco, art education programs for teachers and cultural activities in general. Building and park Panorama of the Institute. The Institute is headquartered in a castle-like set of structures, named \\"Castelo de S√£o Jo√£o\\", designed after the Tudor style, with a total gross area of 77,000 square meters. It's a contemporary construction, blended with some original elements, such as a drawbridge, reliefs of coats of arms and a Gothic altarpiece brought from Europe. The complex consists of the Museum of Armory, an art gallery, a library, an auditorium and areas for public services and technical/administrative rooms. The complex is surrounded by a garden, endowed with artificial lakes and a number of large-size sculptures, such as The Thinker, by Auguste Rodin, The lady and the horse by Fernando Botero, and other works by Sonia Ebling, Leopoldo Martins, etc. Collections The Ricardo Brennand Institute holdings comprise collections of painting, sculpture, armory, tapestry, decorative arts and furniture, with objects ranging from Early Middle Ages to the 20th century, proceeding from Europe, Asia, Americas and Africa. =Armory= Tito Lessi ‚Äì Armory trade, 19th century. Ricardo Brennand Institute collection. Ricardo Brennand Institute. The collection of armory, specialized in melee weapons, is among the largest of its kind in the world. It comprises nearly 3,000 objects, the majority of which produced in England, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, India and Japan. The collection includes weapons used for hunting, battling (offensive and defensive), exhibition and decoration. One of the highlights is the set of 27 full plate armors (i.e., including shields, helmets, gauntlets and chain mails) produced between the 14th and the 17th centuries, as well as armors for dogs and horses. The assemblage of Medieval and melee weapons includes daggers, stilettos, swords, maces, flails, halberds, crossbows, knives, pocketknives and other objects produced between the 15th and the 21st century. Among them, a large number of pieces richly decorated with semi-precious stones, ivory, horns, nacre, oak, steel and other materials stand out. The collection also includes exhibition knives and pocketknives produced by Joseph Rodgers & Sons Ltd., a traditional British cutlery, established in Sheffield in 1724. =Decorative arts, furniture and tapestries= The collection of decorative arts includes objects from Europe, Asia and Africa, dating back to the 17th century, such as candlesticks, candelabra, jugs, mosaics, stained glass windows, miniature caskets, Chinese ceramics, musical instruments, etc. Among the highlights, there is a pair of French blackamoor torcheres, modeled by √âmile Guillemin and cast by Barbedienne in the 19th century, as well as a number of small-scale statuary by the traditional Parisian firm E. Granger. There is also an assemblage of longcase clocks of Austrian and French origin, including a Planchon clock with porcelain dial and equinox-inspired decoration. Among the most valuable works in this collection is also an Italian Baroque organ produced by Domenico Mangino (ca. 1625). The collection of furniture is mostly composed of English and French examples, including storage and resting pieces, such as chests, sideboards, cupboards, bookcases, seats and chairs, made with oak, walnut and other types of wood. Outstanding among them are the pieces of Gothic trend, a 19th-century Bonheur du jour writing desk in Biedermeier style, and an 18th- century sacristy chest of drawers, proceeding from Minas Gerais. The collection of tapestries includes French and Flemish examples, most of which from the 18th century, produced by Aubusson tapestry, Gobelins Manufactory, etc. =Dutch Brazil= Frans Post ‚Äì Fort Frederick Hendrik, 1640. Hessel Gerritsz ‚Äì Map of Pernambuco, 1631. The Ricardo Brennand Institute houses one of the most comprehensive collections of historical and iconographic documentation related to the 17th century period of Dutch occupation of Brazilian Northeast. Outstanding among these objects is the world's largest ensemble of paintings by Frans Post, the first landscapist of the New World. The Institute holds 15 of Post's paintings, which is equivalent to 10% of the artist's known output. It is the only collection that covers every phase of Post's oeuvre. Of particular importance is the canvas View of Fort Frederick Hendrik, painted by Post in Recife in 1640, which is the only of the seven remaining paintings produced by Post while he was still in Brazil that is currently housed in a Brazilian collection (the other six are distributed among the Louvre, the Mauritshuis and the Cisneros collection). Among the set of 17th-century Dutch paintings, there are also oil portraits of John Maurice of Nassau by the workshops of Pieter Nason and Jan de Baen. The Institute preserves a group of prints made between 1644 and 1645 by a group of engravers led by Jan van Brosterhuisen, after detailed drawings made by Frans Post to illustrate Caspar Barlaeus's Rerum per octennium in Brasilia et alibi nuper gestarum sub praefectura. Post's original drawings are currently housed in the British Museum. The prints depict the main sites and the topography of Brazilian lands under Dutch rule. Also of cartographic importance is the ensemble of 17th-century Brazilian maps made by Hessel Gerritsz, Claes Visscher, Georg Marcgrave, Izaac Commelyn and others. Letter written by John IV of Portugal. Lisbon, January 20, 1647. William-Adolphe Bouguereau ‚Äì After the Bath (1894). Of great historical importance is the very rare collection of Dutch emergency coins (known as obsidionais), produced between 1645 and 1654 to overcome the lack of local currency caused by the Portuguese besieging. The collection of manuscripts is composed by reports, directions, memoranda and other documents related to the historical events and figures of the time. It includes correspondences of Isabella of Spain, Maurice of Nassau, Johan de Witt, etc. The centerpiece is a letter sent by John IV of Portugal, about the reinforcement of 200 men to assist in the expulsion of the Dutch, a key- document for the preparation of the Battle of Guararapes. The assemblage of artifacts includes objects produced in the Netherlands with Brazilian raw materials (such as the coconut cups), commemorative silverware, a rare example of the largest kind of terrestrial globes made by Mateus Greuter (of which only 15 examples are known to exist), pipes of the West India Company, etc. Other objects show the influence that the iconographic and scientific material collected by Nassau in Brazil and distributed among European monarchs had in the production of artworks and in the imagination of his contemporaries, such as the famous tapestries of Anciennes and Nouvelles Indes, based on Albert Eckhout's drawings and woven by the Gobelins Manufactory, of which the Institute owns four examples, as well as imaginary Brazilian landscapes executed by artists who never went to Brazil, such as Jillis van Schendel. =Visual arts= The visual arts collection comprises paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings dating back to the 15th century, executed by Brazilian and foreign authors, aside from those mentioned in the preceding topics. The Brazilian art is mostly represented by landscapes, as well as for a significant set of brasiliana (artistic‚Äìhistoric registers about Brazil produced by foreign artists), with predominance of iconography related to Pernambuco and Rio de Janeiro. It includes artworks by Emil Bauch, Louis Schlappriz, Franz Heinnrich Carls, Franz Hagedorn, Claude Fran√ßois Fortier, Johann Moritz Rugendas, Jean-Baptiste Debret, Nicolas-Antoine Taunay, Henri Nicolas Vinet, Nicola Antonio Facchinetti, Giovanni Battista Castagneto, Eliseu Visconti, Jer√¥nimo Jos√© Telles J√∫nior, Benedito Calixto, Carlos Juli√£o, etc. The collection of European painting is characterized by a strong emphasis in genre works, specially palatial and armory-related scenes, ranging from 17th to 19th century, by artists as Enrique L√≥pez Mart√≠nez, Tito Lessi and Blaise Alexandre Desgoffe. Outstanding among these is a pair of Baroque still- life paintings of armors by Francesco Noletti. Another trend in the collection of European paintings refers to the 19th century Orientalist artworks and nudes, by artists as Edouard Richter, Emmanuel de Dieudonne and Delphin Enjolras. The centerpiece is After the bath by William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1894). A 15th-century Venetian wood carving representing a black slave is the main highlight in the collection of sculptures, which also includes works by Giovanni Maria Benzoni, Henri Louis Levasseur, Abelardo da Hora and others, as well as a number of replicas of classic pieces proceeding from Romano Romanelli's workshop. =Library= The Ricardo Brennand Institute's Library focuses on history of Dutch Brazil and was projected to shelter more than 100,000 volumes. It currently houses over 62,000 items, such as books, pamphlets, magazines, newspapers, sheet music, phonograph records, photographs, iconographic albums and rare works. The library collection was formed through acquisitions of private ensembles belonging to Brazilian academics and researchers, such as Jos√© Ant√¥nio Gon√ßalves de Mello Neto, Edson Nery da Fonseca and Jaime Cavalcanti Diniz. The collection of rare books comprises items ranging from 16th to 20th century, with special emphasis in works about Brazil written by European travelers. Among the highlights, a 1586 edition of Jean de L√©ry's History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil, a 1593 edition of Theodor de Bry's Dritte Buch Americae, a very rare 1648 hand- coloured edition of Willem Piso and Georg Marcgrave's Historiae Naturalis Brasilae, a 1647 coloured edition of Caspar Barlaeus's Rerum per Octennium in Brasilia, etc. Gallery Image:Arquiduquesa Isabel da √Åustria - Carta manuscrita assinada em Bruxelas (1628).jpgClara Isabella Eugenia - Manuscript letter, Brussels, June 20, 1628.

He is the father of Medical Savings Accounts, now known as Health Savings Accounts. He had been the chairman of Golden Rule Insurance Company. Civil rights work In 1976, Rooney successfully led a fight against discrimination in insurance agent testing with an eight-year lawsuit against the State of Illinois and the Educational Testing Service.ETS: Educational Testing Service ‚Äì About The suit charged discrimination against minority applicants. Estimated cost of the litigation and experts was approximately $2 million. The civil rights case was settled with a precedent-setting agreement that requires a method of constructing exams designed to eliminate unnecessary racial disparities. Education Rooney's advocacy for school vouchers made national headlines in 1991 with his founding of the Educational Choice Charitable Trust.Educational Choice Charitable Trust - Home The Educational Choice Charitable Trust provides tuition assistance for students from lower-income families in Indianapolis whose parents want them to attend a private school. Rooney's action in Indianapolis spurred interest in vouchers in other parts of the country. There are over 60 such programs with over 53,000 students in privately-funded educational choice programs, based upon Rooney's original model. America's PAC Rooney received attention in the fall of 2006 United States Congressional elections, after America's PAC, a group to which Rooney donated $900,000, ran controversial ads alleging that Democrats \\"want to abort black babies\\". Of the 27 radio ads that ran during the 2006 election cycle, two dealt with the abortion issue. The spokesman for the group is Herman Cain, an African American radio talk show host, author, and candidate, for the Republican Party nomination in the 2012 presidential election. Helping the uninsured In October 2006, Mr. Rooney was the subject of a NUVO Dispatch titled \\"Defending the Uninsured.\\" Defending the uninsured - NUVO.net which reported \\"Rooney has found that hospitals have made a common practice of charging 3.5 times what Medicare will pay for services. While Rooney acknowledges that hospitals may need to charge more than Medicare will pay, he contends that authoritative research shows that Medicare plus 25 percent is the reasonable amount for hospitals to charge‚Ä¶. 'Nationally, 35 percent of Hispanics are uninsured; 22 percent of African-Americans are uninsured; and 11 percent of non-Hispanic Caucasians are uninsured. So when you're doubling, tripling, multiplying the price by five times, you're doing it mainly to minority people,' Rooney says. 'I consider that racial discrimination.' NUVO goes on to report: \\"Rooney believes that people need tools to defend themselves. 'They need to know how to deal with the hospital and the evidence is if they deal with the hospital correctly almost all the time the hospital will forgive the bill ‚Ä¶ The hospital is only entitled to collect a reasonable fee. There is case law exactly on this subject. When they enter the hospital, if they sign an unconditional commitment it's generally not binding because they're under duress.' Rooney has made helping the uninsured a focus of the Fairness Foundation. The foundation has allied itself with lawyers willing to represent people in disputes over hospital bills and has set up a toll free number that people call for help: 800-742-3441. Rooney emphasizes that talking people through the process of dealing with hospitals requires patience, stamina and verbal skills. The Fairness Foundation, he says, is equipped to not only give people useful information but to talk them through what they need to do. 'A sick person is not in a position to adequately defend themselves,' Rooney says. 'But that doesn't mean they can't be defended.'\\" Death Rooney died at home in Indianapolis, Indiana, on September 15, 2008, aged 80.Rooney's death spawns uncertainty for struggling insurance company, not-for-profit Detailed obituary References External links *The Fairness Foundation Category:1927 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American businesspeople in insurance Category:American civil rights activists Category:Businesspeople in insurance Category:People from Indianapolis ","title":"J.

In pursuit of his campaign to outlaw intoxicating beverages, he went undercover, posing as an habitu√© of saloons and collecting information against their owners. Nickname He gained the nickname \\"Pussyfoot\\" due to his cat-like stealth in the pursuit of suspects in the Oklahoma Territory. Newspapers in Muskogee, Oklahoma referred to him as ‚Äúthe gent with the panther tread,‚Äù which led to \\"Pussyfoot.\\" Johnson said that he wore rubber heels on his shoes. Biography Born in Coventry, New York, Johnson was educated at the University of Nebraska. Following college, he stayed in Lincoln, Nebraska and worked at The Lincoln Daily News before becoming manager of the Nebraska News Bureau. He met Lillie M. Trevitt while in Lincoln and the two were married in 1886. Johnson's first wife died in 1927 and he married May B. Stanley of Washington D.C. in 1928. During his time in Nebraska, Johnson's views on temperance were formed and he gained a reputation as a Prohibitionist. In 1889, while Nebraska was engaged in a debate over statewide prohibition, Johnson posed as an anti-Prohibitionist to obtain information from brewery and saloon owners. He then published information which was detrimental to the \\"wet\\" cause. Johnson's temperance activities earned him governmental notice and he was appointed special agent of the Department of the Interior to enforce laws in Indian Territory and Oklahoma in 1906. He was chief agent of the United States Indian Service from July 1908 until September 1911 and secured more than 4,400 convictions through a practice of sweeping into gambling saloons and other disorderly places. Saloon keepers affected by Johnson's raids banded together to offer a US$3,000 reward for his death. Upon learning of the reward, Johnson changed to nighttime raids and destroyed most of the raided establishments. Pussyfoot Johnson (c. 1920) After resigning from federal service, he moved to Kansas and began working with the Anti-Saloon League. There \\"he developed some of the tactics that would later be widely used in the Anti-Saloon League. For example, he wrote to wet leaders falsely claiming to be a brewer and asked for advice on how to defeat temperance activists. He then published the letters he received to embarrass and discredit his opposition.\\"http://www.wpl.lib.oh.us/AntiSaloon/Leaders/william_johnson.html+%22William+E.+Johnson%22+pussyfoot&hl;=en‚â∑=us&ct;=clnk&cd;=3 Johnson served as managing editor of 35 Anti-Saloon League publications between 1912 and 1926 before becoming manager and then director of the London office of the World League Against Alcoholism. He was a member of the International Temperance Committee of Fifty in Paris (1919) and was also a delegate to the fourteenth International Anti-Alcoholic Congress in Milan (1913) and Tartu (1926). In addition to his work within the United States, Johnson toured internationally to promote Prohibition. On 13 November 1919, he was captured by a mob of medical students while at a speaking engagement at Essex Hall and paraded through the streets of London on a stretcher before being rescued by police. During the ragging, Johnson was struck by an object thrown from the crowd and lost his right eye after physicians were unable to repair the resulting damage. In April 1921, Johnson was booed into silence at Toronto's Massey Hall and at a rally in downtown Windsor while campaigning for tightening of Ontario's prohibition laws. The big Windsor crowd‚Äîin a city at the hub of \\"rumrunner\\" smuggling‚Äîwas so hostile that Johnson had to be surrounded by police and escorted to Detroit.Canadian Annual Report, 1922, p. 553 Johnson retired from public life in 1930, returning to his family farm in Chenango County, New York until his death on 2 February 1945.

The flowers of fringed gentian open on sunny days, but generally remain closed on cloudy days. Individual plants live for only one or two years; the plant is noted as having become relatively rare. In autumn, solitary, iridescent blue flowers develop on naked peduncles approximately in height. Each finely fringed petal is in length. The outermost flower parts are two pairs of green sepals, strongly winged and flared on the basal margins, the outer pair much larger than the inner. It is closely related to Gentianopsis virgata (Raf.) Holub, which is sometimes lumped within a broadly transcribed G. crinita.

It was named one of the best plays of 1999 by Time and eventually became the third-most- produced play of the 2000-01 season in America.\\"The Season's\\", American Theatre, October 2001: 86. Plot synopsis The play takes place at fictional Belmont College, a mostly-white liberal arts school in Belmont, Vermont. The curtain opens on Sarah Daniels, Dean of Students, talking with sophomore Patrick Tyler Chibas. Wanting Patrick Tyler to receive a scholarship for minority students, Sarah convinces him to mark his ethnicity as Puerto Rican, even though he considers himself to be \\"Nuyorican\\", which is not a university-recognized ethnicity at Belmont. The next scene shows Professor Ross Collins, Head of Humanities Burton Strauss and Dean Catherine Kenny waiting to have a meeting with Sarah. When Sarah comes in, she tells them that freshman Simon Brick, one of the few African-American students, has started receiving hateful, racist notes. The all-white administration scrambles to contain the problem and reassure parents that everything is under control. Strauss proposes scheduling a meeting to discuss racism. Ross and Kenny agree that this is a good idea. However, Sarah wants to talk to Simon before holding a campus-wide meeting. She suspects that he would be embarrassed if other students knew about the notes. Two weeks later, senior Greg Sullivan comes to Sarah's office. He has been inspired by the race forum and asks her about forming a student group called \\"Students for Tolerance\\". Sarah thinks this is a great idea. Ross informs Sarah that there will be a second meeting to discuss race. She found the first meeting unproductive and suggests that the next one have some effect beyond a lot of white people discussing how bad racism is. Burton comes in and informs them that Greg Sullivan has asked him to sponsor the Students for Tolerance organization. Simon receives another racist note beginning, \\"Little Black Sambo\\". Sarah decides to talk to Simon, but before she can go, Patrick Tyler comes to see her and informs her that when he received the scholarship, his financial aid was taken away. She reassures him that she will get it back. Patrick Tyler is still upset and tells her that the race forum was insulting and patronizing. Sarah convinces him to bring this up at the next forum. The next day, Sarah meets with Patrick to discuss his editorial in the school newspaper. She reads from Patrick Tyler's article discussing Burton's patronizing outburst at the second race forum; when Patrick Tyler and other students tried to speak out about their feelings, Burton yelled at them. The article describes racism being widespread throughout the administration. It tells of Patrick Tyler being offered a scholarship before the college even knew his ethnicity, which he understands to be tokenism that insults the entire student body. He informs her that he, the Black Student Union, and almost everyone he knows is boycotting the next race forum and that he is going to another school in the spring because he hates Belmont. Sarah is sorry and says she was not paying attention to who he was. The president of the school receives a letter from Patrick Tyler and is upset about the racial discord. So Catherine asks Sarah to write a ten-point plan of how to eliminate racism at Belmont. Sarah stays late at school to work on the plan. Ross comes by and Sarah, in a controversial scene, reveals to him her not-so-latent racism. She tells Ross that before working at Belmont, she worked at Lancaster, a mostly black college. She calls blacks lazy, stupid, scary, loud, belligerent, abusive and rude. She says of Lancaster, \\"There were plenty of nice kids, but they weren't the ones you noticed.\\"See Gilman, Rebecca. Spinning into Butter. 2nd edn. New York: Faber and Faber, Inc., 2000. Sarah also reveals that when choosing a seat on the bus, she looks first for a seat by a white person, then a yellow person, and lastly a black person. Ross says, \\"Most people are just racists. They don't know they're racists.\\" Sarah learns that Simon wrote the notes to himself. While she is away visiting him, Kenny goes into Sarah's office and discovers racist remarks written on Sarah's notebook. Sarah tells Ross about her visit with Simon. She explains that the boy said he saw himself writing the notes but felt like someone else was doing it. Sarah says she told him, \\"Stop hating yourself.\\" Sarah, Ross, Kenny, and Burton meet in Sarah's office to discuss Simon. Kenny thinks that he wrote the notes for attention and Sarah says that Simon did not know what he wanted. Burton remembers that Simon referred to himself as \\"Little Black Sambo\\" in one of the notes. Burton tells Sambo's story, which the play's title comes from. Burton uses this story to explain the behavior of Simon. Burton thinks that Simon is a \\"little con artist\\" who got the administration all whirled up just like Sambo got the tigers. Kenny asks Sarah to explain the discriminatory remarks written in her notebook. Sarah refuses to and puts in her resignation. She dealt with Simon differently from the administration - she was much more sympathetic to his circumstances - but it was her exposed racism that led to her resignation. Greg Sullivan meets with Sarah as she is packing. He says that Students for Tolerance invited the Black Student Union to a meeting to discuss racism and that the students really opened up about it. They wondered why Simon wrote the notes, but could not conclude why he did it. Because Simon lied to the administration, he is expelled from school. Mr. Meyers drives him home and Sarah calls him. She tells Simon not to be too hard on himself. Origin Rebecca Gilman was a student for a short time in 1983 at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont, before transferring to Birmingham-Southern. The origin of Spinning into Butter is an incident like the one in the play that happened at Middlebury in fall 1983. An African-American freshman named John Grace living in the freshman dormitory Allen reported that he had found racist notes on his door marker board and a rock thrown through his window. There were few black students at Middlebury and they were a fairly insular group, but almost nobody on campus felt Middlebury was a racist institution. The student body, the faculty and the administration were horrified. Students rallied around Grace and guarded his dorm room 24 hours a day. Even with the guard, Grace found another racist note in his room. On September 30, 1983, an investigation discovered that Grace had written the note. He admitted it and promptly left campus. Middlebury College President Olin Robison held an All- College meeting that was very well attended immediately after Grace left campus informing the college of these events. Controversy The play's treatment of racism has sparked some controversy. Several productions include a forum at the end for audience members to discuss the issues raised. The well-known novelist Ishmael Reed criticized the play, calling it racist and clumsy,Another Day on the Front. New York: Basic Books, 2003, p. 166. but other criticsStacks, Geoffrey. \\"Simon wasn't there: the Sambo strategy, consumable theater, and Rebecca Gilman's Spinning into Butter.\\" African American Review, 40.2 (2006): 285-298. defend the play, arguing that it exposes rather than perpetrates racism.Geoffrey Stacks, \\"Simon Wasn't There: The Sambo Strategy, Consumable Theater, and Rebecca Gilman's Spinning into Butter.\\" African American Review 40.2 (Summer 2006): 285-97.

It is the continuous-time subset of Verilog-AMS. History Verilog-A was created out of a need to standardize the Spectre behavioral language in face of competition from VHDL (an IEEE standard), which was absorbing analog capability from other languages (e.g. MAST). Open Verilog International (OVI, the body that originally standardized Verilog) agreed to support the standardization, provided that it was part of a plan to create Verilog-AMS -- a single language covering both analog and digital design. Verilog-A was an all-analog subset of Verilog-AMS that was the first phase of the project. There was considerable delay (possibly procrastination) between the first Verilog-A language reference manual and the full Verilog-AMS, and in that time Verilog moved to the IEEE, leaving Verilog-AMS behind at Accellera. The email log from 2000AD can be found here. Standard Availability Verilog-A standard does not exist stand-alone - it is part of the complete Verilog-AMS standard. Its LRM is available at the Accellera website.Verilog-AMS Standard However, the initial and subsequent releases can be found here, with what will probably be the final release here since future work will leverage the new net-type capabilities in SystemVerilog. Built-in types like \\"wreal\\" in Verilog-AMS will become user-defined types in SystemVerilog more in line with the VHDL methodology. Compatibility with the C programming language A subset of Verilog-A can be translated automatically to the C programming language using the Automatic Device Model Synthesizer (ADMS). This feature is used for example to translate the BSIM Verilog-A transistor models, which are no more released in C, for use in simulators like ngspice.  Code example  This first example gives a first demonstration of modeling in Verilog-A: \`include \\"constants.vams\\" \`include \\"disciplines.vams\\" module example(a,b,c,d,e,f); parameter real R = 1m; parameter real C = 1u; parameter real L = 1u; parameter integer gain = 2; input a; output b; inout c,d,e,f; electrical a,b,c,d,e,f; analog begin // Modelling lumped elements //Resistor V(c,d) <\\\\+ R*I(c,d); //Inductor // Multiple current or voltage assignments are accumulated V(c,d) <\\\\+ L * ddt(I(c,d)); //Capacitor I(e,f) <\\\\+ C * ddt(V(e,f)); // Simple amplifier // Voltages are referenced to ground if no second node is given V(b) <\\\\+ gain * V(a); end endmodule This Verilog-AMS example implements an ideal diode, by defining the current through the branch (a,c) depending on voltage at branch terminals (a), (c), and the ambient temperature of the simulated circuit: // Ideal Diode module diode (a, c); inout a, c; electrical a, c; parameter real IS = 1.0e-14; // User-configurable saturation current real idio; /Calculate nonlinear current through diode depending on * - thermal voltage $vt (at ambient temperature of simulated circuit) and * - voltage between terminals */ analog begin idio = IS * (limexp(V(a,c)/$vt) - 1); I(a,c) <\\\\+ idio; end endmodule For a simple DC voltage source, the branch voltage is set to the constant (DC) value: // DC Source module vsrc (p,n); parameter real dc = 1.0; inout p, n; electrical p, n; analog begin // Assign constant DC voltage at each time step: V(p,n) <\\\\+ dc; end endmodule A sine voltage generator can use the built-in sin() function: // A Sinusoidal Voltage Source \`include \\"constants.vams\\" module vsin (p,n); parameter real amplitude = 1.0; parameter real freq = 50.0; parameter real phase = 0.0; inout p, n; electrical p, n; analog begin V(p,n) <\\\\+ amplitude * sin(\`M_TWO_PI * freq * $abstime + phase); $bound_step(0.1/freq); // demand at least 10 points per cycle to avoid aliasing issues end endmodule See also * Verilog-AMS * Verilog References External links * Language design objectives (circa 1994) * Accellera Verilog Analog Mixed-Signal Group * Language References Manuals * The Designer's Guide to Verilog-AMS * verilogams.com ‚Äî User's manual for Verilog-AMS and Verilog-A * Designer's Guide Community ‚Äî Examples of models written in Verilog-A Category:Hardware description languages ","title":"Verilog-A"},{"id":"7649481","text":"Winthrop Welles Ketcham (sometimes spelled Ketchum, June 29, 1820 ‚Äì December 6, 1879) was a United States Representative from Pennsylvania and a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Education and career Born on June 29, 1820, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Ketcham pursued classical studies. He was an instructor at Wyoming Seminary in Kingston, Pennsylvania from 1844 to 1847, and at Girard College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1848 and 1849. He read law in the offices of Lazarus Denison Shoemaker and Charles Denison and was admitted to the bar January 8, 1850. He entered private practice in Wilkes- Barre from 1850 to 1855. Ketcham became a Republican when that party was first organized in 1854, having been a Whig prior to that time. He was prothonotary for Luzerne County, Pennsylvania from 1855 to 1858. He was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1858. He was a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 10th district from 1859 to 1861. He was a delegate to the 1860 and 1864 Republican National Conventions. He resumed private practice in Wilkes-Barre from 1861 to 1863. He was an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1864 to the 39th United States Congress. He was solicitor for the Court of Claims from 1864 to 1866. He again resumed private practice in Wilkes-Barre from 1867 to 1873. In 1868, he was a presidential elector from Pennsylvania, and cast his vote for Ulysses S. Grant. In 1866, 1869, and 1872, he received votes in the Republican state conventions for the office of Governor of Pennsylvania. Congressional service Ketcham was elected as a Republican from Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 44th United States Congress and served from March 4, 1875, until July 19, 1876, when he resigned to accept a federal judicial appointment. Federal judicial service Ketcham was nominated by President Ulysses S. Grant on June 7, 1876, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania vacated by Judge Wilson McCandless. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 26, 1876, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on December 6, 1879, due to his death in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was interred in Hollenback Cemetery in Wilkes-Barre. Family Ketcham's father, Lewis N. Ketcham, was a painter and cabinet-maker. At an early age Ketcham assisted his father in painting buildings in the city and lock-houses along the canal. In 1846, he married Sarah Urquhart, with whom he had a daughter, Ella, and a son, J. Marshall.

There are different ways to communicate between the switch and the fixture: # Using radio transmission: A radio receiver is typically wired or screwed into a fixture or device, wired or otherwise connected to the electrical system of the building or plugged into an outlet. The radio receiver's memory is programmed by any number of means to respond to certain selected \\"switches\\" or (more correctly) remote control transmitters. # Using the existing power lines (such as INSTEON or X10): A receiver is plugged into an outlet and a device is then plugged into the receiver. The plug-in receiver is then programmed to the switches. Some devices are hard wired into ceiling light fittings, making for a hidden system. Common uses for wireless switches =Complicated wiring= Multiple wireless transmitters can command a single receiver. This means switches in different locations can turn the same electrical load on or off. Switching like this is often used in stairwells or rooms where two or more switches are used to turn one light on or off. Achieving this result with wired three-way or four-way switches requires a higher level of electrical knowledge and more time for wiring and installation. =Remodeling= Wireless light switches eliminate the wire from the light to the switch location. This is useful in remodeling situations where new wiring can be a hassle. Rather than tearing down a wall to gain access to the wires, a wireless switch can be used. This avoids any need to access wires and makes remodeling fast and simple. =Log homes= Another use for wireless switches is in log homes, where electrical installations can be difficult because of the amount of routing and drilling that would otherwise be needed. When running a regular (non-wireless) circuit, the electrician must drill a hole through all of the logs to get each wire to the switch location. The electrician also must cut a large hole in the log to install a switch box. Wireless switches do not need switch boxes because there are no wires and no routing is needed. This decreases the electrical work required. =Brick, concrete, tile and plaster walls= Installing a wired switch in a solid brick or concrete wall or installing on a plaster or tiled wall requires delicate routing and drilling to create a channel in the wall for the wire and space for the switch and switch box inside the wall. This routing and drilling work could damage the surface, causing expensive repair work. Wireless switches do not need any channels, holes, boxes or wire in the wall. This reduces the amount of electrical work required when installing a switch.  Battery-free switches  All remote light switches require a power source in order to facilitate the transmission of a signal to the receiving device. Some of these switches rely on batteries for power output while most are required to be wired into an existing electrical system. Lightning Switch, EnOcean, CHERRY and others manufacture wireless light switches that use energy harvesting instead of batteries ISM ENIGMA. The mechanical energy created by pressing the switch generates enough electricity to power a built-in transmitter that sends a radio signal to the receiver.  Smart switches  There are more and more light switches can be controlled by smartphone. Usually user can control the light using mobile app. But for some products, extra corresponding hub is needed to connect those smart switches. In order to avoid the hub, wireless light switch and luminaire needs to share the same protocol, e.g. Bluetooth mesh Lighting model or Zigbee LightLink. Apple also provide HomeKit which try to integrate all those user interfaces.

In 1876, Paget was appointed a member of Queen Victoria's privy council. Biography Augustus Berkeley Paget was born on 16 April 1823, the son of the diplomat, the Rt. Hon. Sir Arthur Paget and Lady Augusta Fane. He was the nephew of General Sir Edward Paget and grandson of Henry Bayly Paget, 1st Earl of Uxbridge. He was privately educated, and in 1840 he entered the service of the crown as clerk in the secretary's department of the general Post Office. He was soon transferred to the Audit Office, and again on 21 August 1841 to the foreign office. Paget then decided to enter the diplomatic service, and on 2 December 1843, obtained an appointment as temporary attach√© at Madrid, where he remained till 1846. On 6 February 1846, he was appointed precis writer to the foreign secretary, Lord Aberdeen, but on 26 June became second paid attach√© to the British embassy at Paris. Here he witnessed the French demonstration of 15 May 1848, and the establishment of the second empire ; on 18 December 1851 he became first paid attach√©. On 12 February 1852, he was promoted to be secretary of legation at Athens at a time when diplomatic relations with Greece were more or less in abeyance, so that his position was peculiar and required much tact. On 8 December 1852, he went on to Egypt and acted as consul-general till 19 February 1853, returned to England on leave of absence on 27 May 1853, and was transferred to the Hague as secretary of legation on 14 January 1854. Here he acted as charg√© d'affaires from 7 May to 21 October 1855, and again from 3 July to 24 August 1856. He was transferred to Lisbon on 18 February 1857, and acted as charg√© d'affaires from 9 July 1857 to 14 January 1858. On 1 April 1858, he was sent to Berlin and acted as charg√© d'affaires from 17 June to 20 November 1858. On 13 December 1858, he was appointed envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the king of Saxony. On 6 June 1859, he was gazetted to the post of minister at the court of Sweden and Norway, but on 6 July this appointment was cancelled in favour of that to Denmark. As minister at Copenhagen, Paget saw the accession of Christian IX at the close of 1863, and had to play a leading part in regard to the Schleswig-Holstein difficulty in 1864; nor was his position much less difficult when in 1866 Prussia meditated war against Austria. On 9 June 1866, he was sent to Portugal as envoy extraordinary. Appointed on 6 July 1867 to Italy as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Victor Emmanuel, he represented Great Britain in Italy during one of the most critical periods of Italian history ; he saw the entry of the Italian troops into Rome and the beginning of a new era of national life. It is admitted that in this trying period his tact was conspicuous. He remained in Italy for a long time, becoming ambassador extraordinary on 24 March 1876. On 12 September 1883 he relinquished this post and, after a short period of leave, became ambassador at Vienna on 1 January 1884. From that post he retired on 1 July 1893. Family Paget married in 1860 Countess Walburga Ehrengarde Helena von Hohenthal. The couple had three children: #Victor Frederick William Augustus Paget (1861‚Äì1927), a Lieutenant Colonel #Alberta Victoria Sarah Caroline Paget (1863‚Äì1944), married Robert George Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth, GBE, CB, PC (1857‚Äì1923) #Ralph Paget (1864‚Äì1940, later became Sir Ralph Paget, KCMG, CVO, PC) Sir Augustus died on 11 July 1896 and was buried in the cemetery of Tardebigge, Worcestershire, next to the family plot of the Earls of Plymouth. His wife later achieved fame in her own right by publishing memoirs of her life in their various embassies.

Early life and football career Holleder was born in Buffalo, New York, and at age 13, he and his family moved to Irondequoit, New York. He attended high school at the Aquinas Institute in nearby Rochester. He was heavily recruited by a number of top college football recruiters, including West Point's offensive coach Vince Lombardi. He elected to enroll at the United States Military Academy at West Point. As a junior in 1954, he was named to the All-America team as an end. The following season, Army head coach Colonel Red Blaik asked him to move to quarterback. Holleder clearly lacked the skills to be a productive passer, but Blaik felt that his leadership skills were important and would help the struggling team improve. Blaik's move was ridiculed but it paid off. The team finished with a record of 6-3-0, including a rousing upset of Navy that led to Holleder's appearance on the cover of Sports Illustrated. One of Holleder's classmates at West Point was General Norman Schwarzkopf. They both graduated in the Class of 1956. =1956 NFL draft= The New York Giants selected Holleder in the 1956 NFL Draft college draft. However, Holleder was not interested in a professional football career. Military career  After graduating from West Point, he continued to serve in the U.S. Army. Over the next ten years, he rose to the rank of major, serving posts in Hawaii and Korea, and in between returning to West Point for three years as an assistant football coach, recruiter, and scout. =Battle of Ong Thanh= In 1967, Holleder, now a major, requested to be sent to Vietnam, where he became the Operations Officer for 1st Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division. During the Battle of Ong Thanh on Tuesday October 17, 1967, he and his commanding officer were overflying the battle in a helicopter. They observed the entire command unit on the ground had been killed and the remaining men were in serious trouble. Don volunteered to organize a rescue effort. Upon landing, Holleder secured three volunteers and rushed to the battle site. Running far in front of his volunteers, he was shot by a sniper. The volunteers who accompanied him pulled him into cover behind a tree. Before they could apply emergency first aid, Holleder died. He is interred in Arlington National Cemetery. Personal life Holleder had a wife, Caroline, and four daughters, Stacy, Katherine, Susan, and Caroline. Legacy In 1974, the football stadium in his hometown of Rochester was renamed Holleder Memorial Stadium in his honor. The stadium was home to the football team of his high school Alma Mater, Aquinas Institute. In 1985 the stadium was torn down where the Holleder Technology Park now stands on the site, bisected by Holleder Parkway. In 1985, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, and that same year, West Point's basketball/hockey arena was named in his honor (The Donald W. Holleder Center). Each year, the Army football team recognizes one of their players with the Black Lion Award, given \\"to a player who best exemplifies the character of Don Holleder, leadership, courage, devotion to duty, self sacrifice and, above all, an unselfish concern to put the team ahead of himself.\\" He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on April 27, 2012.

It is usual practice to refer to him as \\"de Wailly\\" (\\"De Wailly\\" at the beginning of a sentence) and not \\"Wailly\\". However, the name is generally indexed as \\"Wailly, Charles de\\". (An exception is found in Eriksen 1974, however, his example has not been followed by subsequent authors, such as Braham 1980 or Cleary 1998.) During the Revolution de Wailly began to sign his name \\"Dewailly\\" (Braham 1972, p. 673 note 7), but this form of the name has not been generally adopted. () (9 November 1730 ‚Äì 2 November 1798) was a French architect and urbanist, and furniture designer, one of the principals in the Neoclassical revival of the Antique. His major work was the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on for the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise (1779‚Äì82). In his designs, de Wailly showed a predilection for the perfect figure, the circle.  Biography  De Wailly was born in Paris. Starting in 1749, he was the pupil of Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel at l'√âcole des Arts, where he met William Chambers and had as a schoolmate Marie-Joseph Peyre; later he studied with Giovanni Niccol√≤ Servandoni and with Jean-Laurent Le Geay. After having obtained the Prix de Rome for architecture in 1752 he went to the French Academy in Rome for three years until 1755, sharing his prize with his friend Pierre-Louis Moreau-Desproux. Both participated in the excavations at the Baths of Diocletian. In Rome, de Wailly founded a friendship with the sculptor Augustin Pajou, who was to carve his bust and that of his wife and for whom, in 1776, he would build a house adjoining his own, in Paris. Panth√©on into a temple to the republic. On his return to Paris de Wailly showed his mastery of the earliest version of neoclassicism, being called the \\"Go√ªt grec\\", by exhibiting a table with a lapis lazuli top and gilt-bronze mounts and a granite vase in the \\"go√ªt antique\\" at the Salon of 1761; they were designed to be manifestos of a new taste, as the squib inserted in the Mercure de France states, in a \\"very noble style, far removed from the frippery manner (\\"air de colifichet\\") which has reigned so long in our furnishings.\\"Eriksen 1974, p. 274. About 1764, for the sumptuous H√¥tel d'Argenson de Voyer, which he remodelled for Marc-Ren√© d'Argenson, marquis de Voyez in an advanced neoclassical style, he designed the gilt-bronze mounted marble and porphyry vase on pedestal that is now in the Wallace Collection, London;Illustrated in Duffy 2005, p. 188. from de Wailly's drawings the sculptor Augustin Pajou made the wax models for the mounts. In 1767, de Wailly was accepted as a member of the first class of the Acad√©mie royale d'architecture and, in 1771, was accepted in the Acad√©mie royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, the only professional architect of the time to win admission, a mark of his great facility as a draughtsman.Braham 1972, p. 673, noting the case of Charles- Louis Cl√©risseau's debatable position as a working architect. Henceforth de Wailly regularly exhibited at the Paris Salons his renderings, designs and models. He gained wider publicity when two of his designs were engraved for the Encyclop√©die and two more for the monumental Description de la france of the 1780s. His reputation abroad grew through engravings of his works; he became particularly popular in Russia, where his disciples, some of whom went to Paris to study with him directly, included Vasily Bazhenov, Ivan Starov, and Andrey Voronikhin. Catherine the Great offered him a high post in the Imperial Academy of Arts, St Petersburg, which he refused. Saint-Sulpice, Paris, 1788-89 In 1772, he was named site architect of the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau, jointly with Marie-Joseph Peyre. The following year, he was authorized to leave for a long stay in Genoa, to redecorate the seventeenth- century palace of Cristoforo Spinola in the Strada Nuova,An elevation of the salone, dated 1773, is in the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, Paris. working in tandem with Andrea Tagliafichi: the building was badly damaged in 1942. He was to return on several occasions to work in Italy. Noticed by the Marquis de Marigny, brother of Mme de Pompadour and general director of the B√¢timents du Roi, de Wailly worked in the park of Marigny's Ch√¢teau de Menars and, thanks to his support, managed to obtain the commission of a new theatre for the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. In 1779, de Wailly and Peyre built their most famous work, the theatre of Od√©on in Paris (see below). De Wailly also designed a project for the Op√©ra-Comique. In 1795, he was elected to the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts ‚Äì 3rd section (architecture), fauteuil V. With his death, Jean Chalgrin succeeded to his seat. He became conservator of the museum of painting in 1795 and was sent to the Netherlands and Belgium to select works of art after the annexation of these countries. He married Ad√©la√Øde Flore Belleville who, after his death, remarried in 1800 to the chemist Antoine Fran√ßois, comte de Fourcroy. He was the brother of lexicographer No√´l Fran√ßois de Wailly.

On 26 March 1770, an order in council authorized the execution of the project on the grounds of the garden of the h√¥tel of the prince de Cond√©, who expected to be rid of the property in expectations of setting up in the Palais-Bourbon. De Wailly was the prot√©g√© of Marigny and Peyre the architect of the Cond√©, a friend of de Wailly since their days as pensionnaires in Rome. The project, revised more than once, had to undergo the approval both of the architects from the royal department in charge of f√™tes and other entertainments, the Menus Plaisirs, Denis-Claude Li√©geon et Jean Damun, who were backed by the members of the Com√©die and also by the City of Paris, represented by its architect, Pierre-Louis Moreau-Desproux. In the outcome, and thanks to the protection of Monsieur, brother of the King, the plans of Peyre and de Wailly finally won the day in the autumn of 1778. Works began in May 1779. Peyre would be principally responsible for the exterior and de Wailly for the interiors. On 16 February 1782, the troupe of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise were established in their own precincts. The theatre was inaugurated by Marie Antoinette, 9 April 1782. * De Wailly gave an overall plan for the construction of the district around the new theatre, allotting a Cartesian plan.

Invented by German physicist Heinrich Rubens in 1905, it graphically shows the relationship between sound waves and sound pressure, as a primitive oscilloscope. Today, it is used only occasionally, typically as a demonstration in physics education. Overview A length of pipe is perforated along the top and sealed at both ends - one seal is attached to a small speaker or frequency generator, the other to a supply of a flammable gas (propane tank). The pipe is filled with the gas, and the gas leaking from the perforations is lit. If a suitable constant frequency is used, a standing wave can form within the tube. When the speaker is turned on, the standing wave will create points with oscillating (higher and lower) pressure and points with constant pressure (pressure nodes) along the tube. Where there is oscillating pressure due to the sound waves, less gas will escape from the perforations in the tube, and the flames will be lower at those points. At the pressure nodes, the flames are higher. At the end of the tube gas molecule velocity is zero and oscillating pressure is maximal, thus low flames are observed. It is possible to determine the wavelength from the flame minimum and maximum by simply measuring with a ruler. Explanation Since the time averaged pressure is equal at all points of the tube, it is not straightforward to explain the different flame heights. The flame height is proportional to the gas flow as shown in the figure. Based on Bernoulli's principle, the gas flow is proportional to the square root of the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the tube. This is shown in the figure for a tube without standing sound wave. Based on this argument, the flame height depends non-linearly on the local, time-dependent pressure. The time average of the flow is reduced at the points with oscillating pressure and thus flames are lower.G.W. Ficken, F.C. Stephenson, Rubens flame-tube demonstration, The Physics Teacher, Vol. 17, pp. 306-310 (1979) Flame height on a Rubens tube (without standing sound wave) for different flows of natural gas. Dashed line is linear fit. Square root of the pressure difference between inside and outside of Rubens tube (without standing sound wave) for different flows of natural gas. Dashed line is linear fit. History Heinrich Rubens was a German physicist born in 1865. Though he worked with better remembered physicists such as Max Planck at the University of Berlin on some of the ground work for quantum physics, he is best known for his flame tube, which was demonstrated in 1905. This original Rubens' tube was a four-meter section of pipe with approximately 100 holes of 2mm diameter spaced evenly along its length. in the original publication: \\"eine geradlinige Reihe von etwa 100 L√∂chern von 2mm Weite\\" When the ends of the pipe are sealed and a flammable gas is pumped into the device, the escaping gas can be lit to form a row of flames of roughly equal size. When sound is applied from one end by means of a loudspeaker, internal pressure will change along the length of the tube. If the sound is of a frequency that produces standing waves, the wavelength will be visible in the series of flames, with the tallest flames occurring at pressure nodes, and the lowest flames occurring at pressure antinodes. The pressure antinodes correspond to the locations with the highest amount of compression and rarefaction.G.W. Ficken, F.C. Stephenson, Rubens flame-tube demonstration, The Physics Teacher, Vol. 17, pp. 306-310 (1979) Public displays A Rubens' tube was on display at The Exploratory in Bristol, England until it closed in 1999. A similar exhibit using polystyrene beads instead of flames featured in the At-Bristol science centre until 2009. Students make models of rubens' tube at their school science exhibition. This display is also found in physics departments at a number of universities. A number of physics shows also have one, such as: Rino Foundation (The Netherlands), Fysikshow Aarhus (Denmark), Fizika Ekspres (Croatia) and √ÖA Physics show (Finland). The MythBusters also included a demonstration on their \\"Voice Flame Extinguisher\\" episode in 2007. The Daily Planet's The Greatest Show Ever, ran a competition whereby five Canadian science centres competed for the best science centre's experiment/display. Edmonton's Science Centre (Telus World of Science) utilized a Rubens' tube, and won the competition. The special was filmed on October 10, 2010. Tim Shaw on the show Street Genius on National Geographic Channel also featured one in Episode 18 \\"Wave of fire\\". The artist Emer O'Brien used Rubens tubes as the basis for the sound sculpture featured in her 2012 exhibition Return to Normal at the Wapping Project in London.  2D Rubens' Tube  = Overview = A 2D Rubens‚Äô tube, also known as a pyro board, is a plane of Bunsen burners that can demonstrate an acoustic standing wave in two dimensions. Similar to its predecessor, the one dimensional Rubens' tube, this standing wave is caused by a multitude of factors. Pressure variation caused by the inflow of propane gas interfering with the input of sound waves into the plane causes changes in the height and color of the flames. The 2D Rubens‚Äô tube was made famous by a Danish science demonstrator group in Denmark called Fysikshow. = Explanation = A 2D Rubens‚Äô tube is made up of a lot of different parts. The main part itself is the rectangular steel box that outputs the propane gas. Steel is generally used for the plane on pyro boards because the compound can generally withstand immense amounts of heat and still be able to maintain its structure. Holes are drilled on the top of the steel plane to output the propane gas that is being constantly and slowly pumped into the steel box. Instead of having a complete steel box, some pyro boards designs have wooden sides to support the steel plane on top. In wooden-style pyro boards, the interior of the box is usually covered with some sort of heat-resistant membrane that prevents the propane inside the box from leaking. On the sides of the steel box are speakers that input a sound into the contained medium. The rate at which the propane gas escapes through the holes on the top of the pyro board is dependent on the intensity of the inputted sound. This relationship is directly proportional, meaning as the intensity of the sound increases, the rate at which the propane gas escapes increases. Since the medium inside the steel box is kept at a constant volume, a standing wave has the ability to be produced. The frequency at which the standing wave can be produced is largely dependent on the physical dimensions of the box and the wavelength of the wave. Since pyro boards range in sizes, each board has its own unique frequencies at which a standing wave can be produced. = Public displays = In 2014, Danish science demonstrator Sune Nielsen, a member of Fysikshow, teamed up with science blogger Derek Muller in a YouTube video showing off the pyro board in action. Derek Muller, also known as Veritasium on YouTube, explains the science behind how the 1D and 2D Rubens‚Äô Tubes work.

Helgi was reportedly the son-in-law of Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye (one of Ragnar Lodbrok's sons) and Blaeja, the daughter of king Aelle II of Northumbria. Biography Traditional sources state that Sigurd Hart was only 12 years old, he slew a berserker named Hildibrand in a duel, and 11 other men. He married a woman named Ingeborg (supposedly the daughter of the historical Jutish chieftain Harald Klak, c. 785 ‚Äì c. 852, although Harald was probably too old for that to be true). Sigurd Hart and Ingeborg had children named Guttorm Sigurdsson and Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter. When Sigurd Hart's uncle, king Fr√≥√∞i of Ringerike died, Sigurd Hart supposedly went to Norway to succeed him as king of Ringerike.

The Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr and Heimskringla relate that a berserker from Hadeland named Haki (Hake) killed Sigurd Hart, but lost a hand in the fight. Haki then went to Sigurd Hart's residence at Stein and took Sigurd's children Ragnhild and Guttorm. Haki returned with the children and all the loot to Hadeland. Before Haki (Hake) recuperated from his wounds and could marry the 15-year-old Ragnhild, she was stolen for a second time, by Halfdan the Black. This would seem impossible unless two different men named Sigurd Hart were involved ‚Äì given that most sources suggest that his father was active in the late 9th century, which would make Sigurd Hart about two generations younger than Ragnhild Sigurdsdotter. * Another unlikely claim suggests that the legendary Danish king Harthacanute (born c. 880) was a descendant of Sigurd Hart, although Harthacanute may well have been born before Sigurd. (Harthacanute succeeded Sigtrygg Gnupasson as the king of Zealand, Scania and Halland, but he lost Viken (Oslofjord). He was the father of Gorm the Old (born before 900), the king of Denmark. Gorm succeeded his father as king and married Thyra. Some sources claim that Thyra was a daughter of Harald Klak (c. 785 ‚Äì c. 852); as with his other purported ties to Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, however Harald Klak was too old for that to be true. There are also other, more credible accounts of Thyra's parentage. Gorm's son, Harald Bluetooth (born c. 935) succeeded his father as king and married Gyrid of Sweden. They had a son named Sweyn Forkbeard. Sweyn succeeded his father as king and married Gunhild (≈öwiƒôtos≈Çawa of Poland). They had a son named Cnut the Great. Sweyn also ruled England in his lifetime and established the Danish Empire. When Sweyn died, his elder son Harald Svendsen became the King of Denmark, while England's former king, Ethelred reclaimed the throne. Following Harald's death, his brother Cnut the Great became king, re-established the Danish North Sea Empire. He married Emma of Normandy with whom he had a son named Harthacnut. When Cnut died, Harthacnut became king of Denmark and England. Upon his death, Edward the Confessor became ruler of England in 1042.)

Since Dittman assumed ownership in 1959, WABB has been one of the longest running Top-40 radio stations in the United States. Career Born in Ohio, Dittman's interest in broadcasting became known in the sales and marketing department of his family's appliance store in Cleveland, Ohio. He was involved in the purchasing of advertising time on local radio stations. When Dittman attended St. Louis University, he did not study broadcasting, but engineering. After earning his engineering degree, Dittman's interest in broadcasting kept him away from a career in engineering. His interest finally peaked when he decided to buy a radio station up for sale, with the help of a broker. Dittman found out that the Mobile Register was selling its country music station WABB. He seized the opportunity in 1959 and shortly after arriving in Mobile a year later, the station began broadcasting Top-40 music. The format was such a success in the 1960s that WABB added a new FM simulcast in 1973. Dittman and his staff encouraged drivers in a series of on-air promotions to install low-cost FM radio receivers. WABB-FM eventually continued the Top-40 format after the AM station switched to a news/talk format. Personal life Dittman's service to his fellow man extended beyond FM radio receivers. Since he came to Mobile, the WABB Community Club Awards Program of Greater of Mobile has provided thousands of dollars in financial awards to local organization. The station's longtime sponsorship of the Greater Gulf State Fair in Mobile began in 1965, along with the long-running High Striker game, a charitable promotion at the entrance to the fair's Midway. For years Dittman was seen operating the game himself. The Alabama Deep Sea Fishing Rodeo (sponsored by WABB since 1970) the Senior Bowl, and the GMAC Bowl received financial support from Dittman and WABB through the years. Since WABB was the Emergency Broadcast System primary station for Mobile, Dittman and his radio staff kept residents informed during severe weather, especially during, and after hurricanes. Awards and honors Dittman received numerous awards of recognition for his professional and public service over the years. In 2005, he was named Broadcaster of the Year by the Alabama Broadcasters Association. Death In October 2006, Dittman had a stroke and was placed in a hospital. On the night of October 25, he died at the age of 79 following an illness that had begun just the week before. In the days following his death, friends and family expressed their feelings and shared memories of the man many came to know as someone who cared deeply for his stations, current staff, and former staff. Betsey Dittman succeeded her father after relocating from Chicago, Illinois to Mobile, fulfilling the promise Bernie Dittman had of never selling out in an age when a single corporation can own multiple stations and radio stations are mostly automated. In 2012 the Dittman Family sold WABB-FM to Educational Media Foundation (EMF) for an undisclosed price. That station flipped to the EMF's Christian Contemporary network, K-LOVE, on March 1, 2012,\\"WABB-FM Agrees to be Purchased by Educational Media Foundation\\" from WABB (February 17, 2012) and soon after adopted the callsign WLVM. (EMF would trade WLVM to Cumulus Media that July, and became WABD, re-adopting the CHR format and many elements of WABB-FM's past identity.) The EMF sale excludes WABB AM, which the Dittman family has chosen to retain for the time being. Bernie Dittman's favorite song was The Beatles' Strawberry Fields Forever; the staff of WABB-FM played the song several times throughout the station's final day on-air as a public tribute to Dittman. It was also WABB-FM's penultimate song, the last having been the station's first, Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again by Bob Dylan.\\"Final Hour Of 97.5 WABB\\" from Airchexx.com (March 1, 2012) References External links *WABB AM official website Category:1927 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Cleveland Category:People from Mobile, Alabama Category:American radio executives ","title":"Bernie Dittman"},{"id":"7649647","text":"Old North Dayton, located north of downtown Dayton between the Great Miami and Mad Rivers, Ohio Old North Dayton is a neighbourhood northeast of downtown Dayton, between the Great Miami and Mad rivers.

The Edmonson sisters are standing wearing bonnets and shawls in the row behind the seated speakers. Frederick Douglass is seated, with Gerrit Smith standing behind him. Ezra Greenleaf Weld (October 26, 1801 ‚Äì October 14, 1874), often known simply as \\"Greenleaf\\", was a photographer and an operator of a daguerreotype studio in Cazenovia, New York. He and his family were involved with the abolitionist movement. Family Greenleaf was the son of Ludovicus Weld and Elizabeth (Clark) Weld. His brother was Theodore Dwight Weld, one of the most important abolitionists of his era. These Welds are all members of the very notable Weld Family of New England and share ancestry with Tuesday Weld, William Weld, and others. Personal life Weld was born in Hampton, Connecticut and lived there until 1825 when his family moved to Pompey, New York. He married Mary Ann Parker on August 16, 1827. Mary died on April 30, 1831, soon after giving birth to her second child. After moving to Cazenovia, Ezra remarried to Deborah Richmond Wood on April 12, 1840 and they later had four children. Photography Weld opened his first studio in his home in 1845. In 1850, Cazenovia hosted the abolitionist meeting known as the Fugitive Slave Law Convention. This gave Weld the opportunity to photograph the legendary orator Frederick Douglass with the Edmonson sisters, Gerritt and Abby Kelley Foster. This daguerreotype was given to the imprisoned abolitionist William Chaplin who had helped many of the attendees escape to freedom. Of the six daguerreotypes of Douglass that have survived, only one besides Greenleaf's image has had its daguerreotypist identified. Greenleaf's image is unique because it is a group shot at an outdoor meeting rather than a studio portrait. Daguerreotypes were seldom attempted under these circumstances because the long exposure time required made it difficult to get a satisfactory result. Weld's is the only daguerreotype of Douglass whose date is known with certainty. This daguerreotype is also unique in the paradoxical sense that it is the only one known to have been copied. Two original half- plates exist: One is held by the Madison County Historical Society in Oneida, New York, the other is in a private collection and currently on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The copy (shown above) is in the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, California. In the mid 18th century, most American towns had at least one studio. In an 1850 advertisement in his local newspaper, Greenleaf offered: > \\"Miniatures executed in the finest style, and put in Rings, Pins, Lockets > and cases, of great variety size and price.\\" Greenleaf seems to have been very successful with his daguerreotype business. By 1851 he had leased new quarters on the top floor of a building, where he placed a skylight to receive northern light for his studio sessions.

The service area is approximately , approximately 68,000 are registered patrons of the Library. Average monthly circulation of materials is 75,000, among ten branch libraries and a bookmobile. There is no central or main branch. Administrative offices are located in the Hanover Branch. Technical Services and Mobile Services (the Bookmobile and Delivery) are located at the Atlee Branch.  History  The library system is named after the Pamunkey River, a ninety-mile river that begins twenty miles (32 km) north of Richmond, Virginia, where it joins the North and South Anna rivers. The Pamunkey River goes on to divide Hanover and King William counties. It joins its sister river, the Mattaponi, near West Point, where they create the York River. The Hanover Branch of the Pamunkey Regional Library opened its doors on October 22, 1942. It was one of eleven libraries donated to rural Virginia counties by Mr. David K. E. Bruce. Mr. Bruce also donated equipment and a book collection. The library was built to resemble 18th-century architecture. The Hanover Branch also houses a Virginiana collection that includes local history and genealogy. The King & Queen Branch of the Pamunkey Regional Library, was housed in the former Marriott School from 1994 to 2001. It moved into a new facility next to the school.

It is commercially available as a solution in diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF). Phenylmagnesium bromide is a Grignard reagent. It is often used as a synthetic equivalent for the phenyl \\"Ph‚àí\\" synthon. Preparation Phenymagnesium bromide is prepared by reaction of bromobenzene with magnesium metal. Phenylmagnesium bromide is commercially available as solutions of diethyl ether or THF. Laboratory preparation involves treating bromobenzene with magnesium metal, usually in the form of turnings. A small amount of iodine may be used to activate the magnesium to initiate the reaction. Coordinating solvents such as ether or THF, are required to solvate (complex) the magnesium(II) center. The solvent must be aprotic since alcohols and water contain an acidic proton and thus react with phenylmagnesium bromide to give benzene. Carbonyl-containing solvents, such as acetone and ethyl acetate, are also incompatible with the reagent. Structure Although phenylmagnesium bromide is routinely represented as , the molecule is more complex. The compound invariably forms an adduct with two ligands from the ether or THF solvent. Thus, the Mg is tetrahedral and obeys the octet rule. The Mg‚ÄìO distances are 201 and 206 pm whereas the Mg‚ÄìC and Mg‚ÄìBr distances are 220 pm and 244 pm, respectively. Chemistry Phenylmagnesium bromide is a strong nucleophile as well as a strong base. It can abstract even mildly acidic protons, thus the substrate must be protected where necessary. It often adds to carbonyls, such as ketones, aldehydes. With carbon dioxide, it reacts to give benzoic acid after an acidic workup. If three equivalents are reacted with phosphorus trichloride, triphenylphosphine can be made.

Berkeley & Los Angeles: University of California Press, p. 16 Essentially, Burke's definition maintains that man is distinct from other creatures by the virtue of his use of symbols to communicate, his understanding of negation, his separation from nature by his own techniques, his existence in differing social structures, and his goal to become better than he presently is. Symbol-using Animal Burke distinguishes man from other animals by drawing an analogy between man and birds. He argues that unlike birds, which cannot use symbols to communicate, man is able to use language towards pragmatic ends. To illustrate this point, Burke recalls seeing a bird trapped inside a college classroom. The windows were open, but the bird kept flying upwards to the ceiling, rather than through the window. If the bird could use symbols to communicate then one could simply inform the bird of the open windows and it could fly out to freedom. Its natural instinct to fly up coupled by its inability to use symbols, however, prevents its escape. Burke, also argues that not only does man use symbols, but concedes that man makes and misuses symbols as well.Burke (1966), pp. 3-4 Condensation One aspect of symbols that Burke points out in his discussion of Sigmund Freud's work is condensation. This explains man's ability to condense symbols into categories that can be understood by others to include a variety of other symbols. The example he gives is using the word furniture to refer to chairs, tables, etc.Burke (1966), p. 7 Burke's defining of man in these terms leads to man's quest for identity and social belonging.MacLennan, J. (2005). \\"A rhetorical journey into darkness: Crime scene profiling as Burkean analysis\\". KBJournal, 1, (2). Retrieved October 26, 2006, from www.kbjournal.org Burke sees all human action as infused with symbols. These symbols are used to help create our sense of who we are and where we fit. In order to accomplish these, man seeks for differences and commonalities respectively. Inventor of the negative While Burke struggles with using the word inventor for he feels that language has invented man, he points out that negatives do not exist in nature. He contends that negatives are purely a characteristic of symbol systems, which he has already determined belong uniquely to man. He further refers to morality as being particularly human and based largely on the idea of negatives; that is, there are things we should not do.Burke (1966), pp. 9-13 Intrinsic to this portion of Burke's Definition is the idea of paradox. Burke explains that the idea of negation is, by its nature, paradoxical. He explains that conditioning a statement with a negative draws a positive image of that very statement. This, he argues, defeats the purpose of negation, yet is an inescapable situation.Brock, B., Burke, K., Burgess, P., & Simons, H. (1985) \\"Dramatism as ontology or epistemology: A symposium\\". Communication Quarterly, 33, 17-33. Separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making In this section of Burke's definition he describes man's natural state as being that of basic needs and appetites. However, because of his tools and language, he has taken on a nature completely different from his original state. He cites an example of a day when the electricity of New York City went out and how unnatural it seemed for the streets to be filled with darkness; darkness being a state of man's first nature. However, because of man's tools, a state of lighted streets has become natural.Burke (1966), pp. 13-15 One major example of man's instruments is exemplified in technology.Wess, R. (2006). \\"Ecocriticism and Kenneth Burke: An introduction\\". KBJournal, 2 (2). Retrieved October 26, 2006, from www.kbjournal.org Technology has accomplished the task of separating man from nature. Goaded by the spirit of hierarchy This portion of Burke's description seeks to define man as being drawn to order and status. He points to positions in society that imply this fact. One such example he draws upon is the division of labor that exists in society. Others are titles of nobility and peasantry.Burke (1966), pp. 15-16 Rotten with perfection This last portion of Burke's definition has particular importance to his other philosophical theories of man. Man being rotten with perfection speaks to the motives that are distinct in man; motives being an intrinsic part of Burke's Dramatism, distinguishing action from motion. Burke refers to Aristotle's notion of entelechy, which states that we seek to reach the perfection of our kind. This, however, is not present in nature. Burke points out that a rock and a tree are perfectly acceptable as being what they are, but not so with man for he aims to be higher than he is.Burke (1966), pp. 16-20 While man's striving for perfection may afford him to reach admirable goals and progress, Burke also sees man's goal of perfection as one rife with danger. He points to our concepts of perfection in accordance with other terms. One particularly clear example he gives is the perfection for which was strived by the Nazis thus alluding to the consequences to which such ambitions may lead. Lastly, Burke explains that such dichotomies of perfection give credence to man's belief in God and Devil and Heaven and Hell.Burke (1966), p. 20 Modern-day applications Feminist scholarship has shown a use of Burke's definition as a framework by which a definition for woman can be derived. Their definition is as follows: \\"Woman is the symbol-receiving animal, inventor of nothing, submerged in her natural conditions by instruments of man's making, goaded at the bottom of hierarchy, and rotten by perfection\\".Condit, Celeste. (1992). \\"Post Burke: Transcending the sub-stance of dramatism\\", Quarterly Journal of Speech, 78, (3), 349-355 This particular definition clearly conveys a perception that views man as the suppressor of woman and the cause for her restrained condition. One notable scholar, Celeste Condit, has written in an effort to modernize Burke's works and his \\"definition of man\\" in particular by calling for a Post-Burkean philosophy that takes Burke's ideas and transports them into what she calls the new scene, or modern day. She calls particularly for a restructuring each part of Burke's definition into terms that are founded on but surpass radical feminist ideologies as seen above. Condit defines people as those who play with symbols, invent the negative and possible morality, changed from nature by tools that men and woman have collectively made, struggling for equality, and at times rotten and perfect. Condit seeks to transform Burke's emphases of race and class into gender and culture. J. MacLennan has used Burkean ideas, particularly his dramatistic pentad, in analyzing criminal behavior and offering an understanding of criminal behavior that is often at odds with the ideas of many criminologists and psychologists.MacLennan, J. (2005). \\"A rhetorical journey into darkness: Crime scene profiling as Burkean analysis\\". KBJournal, 1, (2). Retrieved October 26, 2006, from www.kbjournal.org Of particular interest to MacLennan is Burke's first clause in his definition of man as a \\"symbol-using animal\\". MacLennan maintains that this clause, coupled with Burke's ideas of motive, help explain criminal behavior. Burke posits that man uses symbols to obtain his goals, thus his motives are often carried out as acts based on his intentions. Thus Burke maintains that man's actions (use or misuse of symbols) are based on choices and not a compulsion or sickness. This has great implications for modern psychology which often views abnormal and criminal behavior as an illness that is forced upon those who act out in unacceptable ways.

Early life The son of a Scottish mining Engineer, Walter Frame Gibb was born near Port Talbot, Wales, on 26 March 1919. He attended Clifton College\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p479: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 before joining the aero- engine Division of the BAC (Bristol Aeroplane Company) as an apprentice mechanic in 1937, before joining the RAF in May 1940 as a pilot. Fighter pilot Upon completing his training at FTS Cranwell, he was identified as an above average pilot and was posted as a flight instructor at CFS, South Cerney in 1941. He also instructed at 54 OTU until June 1942, before attachment to No. 125 Squadron in February and March 1942. In early 1943 he joined No. 264 Squadron, flying the de Havilland Mosquito on long-range sorties in support of Coastal Command over the Bay of Biscay. On 22 March 1943 he shared in the destruction of a Junkers Ju 88 with another Mosquito. His squadron also saw action over Northern France in the lead-up to the Invasion in 1944. He also scored several train kills during these sorties. Transferred to No. 605 Squadron as a Flight Commander, Gibb and his flight provided support for Dam Busters during a raid on the Dortmund-Ems canal. On 14 September 1943 flying ahead of the Lancaster force, his Mosquitoes reported bad weather conditions and the mission was aborted until 15 September. Gibbs' Squadron suppressed the light flak and searchlights en route to aid the low flying Lancaster bombers. Gibb then served for a short time with 1692 BSDU. He was promoted to wing commander and was given command of No. 239 Squadron in No. 100 Group, flying bomber support missions into Germany in 1945. He claimed five enemy night fighter aircraft shot down. Despite this modest score, Gibb accounted for the victory of Walter Borchers on 6 March 1945. Borchers had scored 43 air victories at the time of his death. On 18/19 March 1945 Gibb shot down another German night fighter ace. Werner Baake and his radar operator survived. Gibb was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in May 1945, and left the RAF in January 1946. Test pilot After the war, he became a test pilot for BAC. Walter was the co-pilot for Bill Pegg during the Bristol Brabazon's maiden flight, and then flew it with himself in command, during in which the large aircraft suffered hydraulic failure, and suffered an emergency landing without flaps. The aircraft development programme was later scrapped in 1953. Gibb and observer FM Piper, took off from Filton near Bristol on 4 May 1953 in an English Electric Canberra bomber. Climbing to the west the Canberra reached an altitude of 63,668 ft; some 4,000 ft higher than the previous record. That year he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club. Gibb became the chief test pilot for BAC in 1955. Flying the a Canberra fitted with more powerful Olympus engines Gibb made an attempt to break his own record on 29 August 1955. Taking off from Filton he climbed over the Bristol Channel towards Ireland and levelled off at 50,000 ft in order to burn off fuel to lighten the aircraft before continuing his ascent. He turned east and finally reached a record altitude of 65,876 ft (nearly 12.5 miles high) over Bristol. He flew his Canberra up to this record height knowing he would possibly pass out due to the altitude, but would regain consciousness to safely land his Canberra. In 1955 he test flew the Bristol Britannia turbo-prop airliner. Despite some mechanical difficulties, he flew from Bristol to Johannesburg, South Africa, refueling once in Khartoum, the trip taking 19 hours. He trained airline pilots in the Britannia, and retired from Test Flying in 1960. He then became Head of Service and Technical Support for the British Aircraft Company, and later became Chairman for British Aerospace Australia in 1978. Personal life Walter married Sylvia Reed, whom he met during his RAF service. She was a Flight Officer at the Operations room at RAF North Weald. They married in 1944 and had three daughters. Walter was a member of the Thornbury Sailing Club, sailing until the age of 83. He was Twice the Club's Commodore, long serving Vice-President, and later became the club President.

He served five terms in the United States House of Representatives and was a justice of the New York Supreme Court from 1962 until 1973. Early life Holtzman was born in New York City on June 1, 1913 to Jewish immigrants from Poland, Isidore and Rebecca. Lester was the couple's only child born in the United States and the only one to survive infancy. The family lived on the Lower East Side in Manhattan until 1916, when Lester contracted polio. The settled in the Middle Village, in Queens which might offer a better chance to recover. He attended Newtown High School in Queens until his father bought a small grocery where Lester would work while doing Prelaw work in the evening. He was the president of his class at St. John's University School of Law and graduated in 1936. Afterwards, he went into private practice in Queens. Political career Holtzman had sought political jobs for several years; once receiving an offer from the Federal Housing Administration. He ran for Congress in 1952, a year that saw Dwight Eisenhower sweep into the White House and the Republicans picked up 22 seats in the House of Representatives. His opponent was Robert Tripp Ross, an incumbent who had won his seat in a special election a few months before. During the campaign, he promised that he would cease takeoffs by low-flying aircraft into Laguardia Airport, which was in the district. Holtzman admitted later this was a lie and was the only lie he consciously told in his career. He defeated Ross by a close 300 votes becoming the only Democrat to unseat a Republican that year, and the first Jewish congressman from Queens. He defeated popular state senator Seymour Halpern in 1954 by more than 10,000 votes and former justice Albert Buschmann in the 1956 election. In his career, Holtzman was generally a backbencher who supported civil rights, Israel and organized labor; but never introduced any legislation that was signed into law. Judicial career After his re-election in 1960, Holtzman decided to run for a seat on the state Supreme Court. The 14-year term and increased salary would give him a measure of security. He secured the nomination thanks to assistance from President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert. As a justice, he handled the first divorce case in New York after laws were reformed. In 1971, he was assigned a case that challenged New York's 1970 legalization of abortion. In Byrn v. New York City Health and Hospitals Corp., Holtzman ruled that Professor Robert Byrn of Fordham University could act as a guardian for the unborn, which afforded him legal standing to file suit overturn the state's abortion law. He also entered an order for the city hospitals to show cause why they should not cease abortion procedures while the law was being challenged. In 1972, Byrn's challenge was decided by an opinion of the Appellate Division and the New York Court of Appeals in which fetuses were not found to have personhood. He retired from the bench in 1973 to become the president of the Queens Savings & Loan Association. Personal life Holtzman married the former Mae Gress in 1936. They had two children, Matthew and Joy. Holtzman died in Rockville, Maryland on November 12, 2002.

He was an officer in the Pennsylvania Reserves infantry division of the Union Army in the U.S. Civil War and served in multiple battles. Early life and education Lemuel Todd was born in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and graduated from Dickinson College in Carlisle in 1839. After graduation, he studied law in the offices of General Samuel Alexander. Todd was admitted to the Cumberland County bar in 1841 and began his law practice in Carlisle. Military service At the outbreak of the civil war, Todd raised a company of volunteers from Cumberland County. The unit, known as the Carlise Guards, was accepted into service of the Union Army as Company I of the 1st Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment. Todd served as Captain of Company I and was promoted to Major and third in command of the regiment. He fought with the 1st Pennsylvania reserves at the Battle of Gaines's Mill, the Battle of Second Bull Run and the Battle of South Mountain. He briefly assumed command of the regiment when Colonel Richard Biddle Roberts was assigned to brigade command at the Battle of Gaines's Mill. In 1862, severe illness forced Todd to resign from the regiment. He continued to support the Union Army by organizing the influx of drafted men in the eastern half of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia. Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin appointed him Inspector General of state troops on the governor's staff. He had responsibility for militia and State Guard units especially during the confederate army invasion of Pennsylvania led by General Robert E. Lee in 1863. After the war, Todd returned to law practice in Carlisle. Political career In 1854, Todd was elected as an Oppositionist member of the 34th United States Congress representing the Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district.

It was published by Marvel Comics as part of its New Universe line. The story depicts the total destruction of the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as a result of the careless actions of the wielder of the Star Brand and its immediate 12-hour aftermath. The Pitt was the first full graphic novel published for Marvel's New Universe series. Major characters *Starbrand (Ken Connell) ‚Äì a young aspiring superhero and native of Pittsburgh bearing a mysterious sigil granting him potentially infinite power. Though the instigator of the Pitt, his presence in the story is limited, appearing in only a few panels without dialog or being named. *The Witness (Nelson Kohler) ‚Äì A man who went into a coma precisely when the White Event occurred and subsequently died. His intellect reincorporating as a ghost-like psychic projection, he cannot be seen or heard, neither can he interact physically with the world in any way, but he can travel anywhere at will to observe events. He is compelled by a strange pull to witness people manifesting paranormal abilities. *MacIntyre (Mac) Browning ‚Äì Colonel in the Army's Defense Intelligence Agency called in to assess and handle the situation. *Jenny Swensen (Spitfire) ‚Äì Government agent and operator of the M.A.X. Armor, which is used to investigate the scene and try to rescue survivors. Background The storyline of The Pitt actually begins in issue #12 of Star Brand. In the previous issue, Ken Connell used his power to become the world's first costumed superhero. Now enjoying growing fame, he makes an appearance at a local Pittsburgh comic-book convention. Unfortunately, a recurring enigmatic foe known only as the Old Man ambushes Connell at the show, destroying the building and killing hundreds of by- standers. After escaping, Connell realizes that he was able to read the Old Man's mind during the encounter, and thus learned that he is a centuries-old human who bears a brand like his own and was driven insane by it. Fearing the same thing may happen to him, Connell resolves to rid himself of the star brand immediately by flying to the far side of the Moon and dissipating nearly all its energy. However, as he begins the flight he has second thoughts about possibly being stranded so far from medical aid if anything should go wrong, and instead sheds the Brand ten miles (16 km) above the Earth. The issue ends with a massive ball of light erupting from Ken Connell. Synopsis The destruction of Pittsburgh occurs at exactly 6:06 pm Eastern Standard Time on December 22, 1987. The spontaneous release of energy caused by the Star Brand instantly and silently disintegrates all matter in a massive spherical volume of space, fifty miles in diameter, centered ten miles (16 km) above ground level. Where the sphere intersects the ground, a perfectly symmetrical concave void in the Earth's crust fifteen miles (24 km) deep (far enough to expose the hot mantle) is made. The city of Pittsburgh and its immediate suburbs lie within this region, thus these settlements and nearly half a million people are destroyed instantly. Thousands more are killed in neighboring areas by violent winds several times greater than hurricane strength, as the atmosphere rushes into the sudden vacuum. The abrupt silent flash of white light can be seen for hundreds of miles, but with the immediate cessation of communication from the area no one knows what has actually happened. The federal government sends in a military reconnaissance team led by Colonel Browning to assess the situation, assisted by Jenny Swensen and her Spitfire robot suit. Faced with the enormity of the disaster and the possibility of it being a Soviet strike, Browning institutes a severe security lockdown, ordering Swensen to abandon attempts to rescue survivors and shooting down a news helicopter that tries to investigate. Swensen ignores Browning's orders to make no contact with civilians and retrieves a car holding a family of survivors who were pulled into the crater by the winds and are slowly sinking into the mire of debris and liquid accumulating in its depths. She rescues the family, but some of the \\"Pitt Juice\\" seeps through her armor and impairs her systems. When she returns, Jenny learns how severely Browning has sealed up the area and his increasingly paranoid attempts to cover-up the truth of the event. She abandons Browning to try to help as many people as she can, and is threatened with summary execution for doing so. However, the search proves fruitless, and Browning allows her to return without incident after conceding that the tragedy is beyond the military's ability to cover-up, or indeed human society's ability to comprehend. Parallel to the main storyline, the Witness observes the unfolding of events, from Ken Connell's initial cause (which he mourns being unable to prevent) and a possibly hallucinated encounter with the vengeful souls of all those who died in the Pitt. At one point, Jenny Swensen sees and attempts to communicate with him, one of the few times a living person has been able to do so. The crater itself is referred to as The Pitt, as is the event that created it. Within the fictional universe, it is occasionally also referred to as The Black Event (in contrast to the earlier White Event). The destruction of Pittsburgh (and the unsolved mystery of its cause) lead to a dramatic rise in international tension and a vast militarization of American society, including the suspension of some civil rights. Many cities suffer dramatic drop in population as residents fear becoming victims of another \\"Pitt\\". New York and surrounding areas in particular suffer severe economic downturn as, in addition to general depopulation, ash and smoke drifting Eastward from the Pitt have a negative environmental impact. The Pitt led into the following mini-series The Draft and then The War, and ultimately the conclusion of the entire New Universe.

This theory concerns \\"(1) the behavioral changes that people make to attune their communication to their partner, (2) the extent to which people perceive their partner as appropriately attuning to them.\\", The basis of the theory lies in the idea that people adjust (or accommodate) their style of speech to one another. Doing this helps the message sender gain approval from the receiver, increases efficiency in communication between both parties, and helps the sender maintain a positive social identity. This theory is concerned with the links between language, context, and identity. Contemporary Communication Theory by Dominic A. Infante, Andrew S. Rancer, Erina Lynne MacGeorge and Theodore Avtgis (2009, Other, Revised) It focuses on both the intergroup and interpersonal factors that lead to accommodation, as well as the ways that power, macro and micro- context concerns affect communication behaviors. Accommodation is usually considered to be between the message sender and the message receiver, but the communicator also often accommodates to a larger audience- either a group of people that are watching the interaction or society in general. \\"Communication accommodation theorists focus on the patterns of convergence and divergence of communication behaviors, particularly as they relate to people‚Äôs goals for social approval, communication efficiency, and identity\\". \\"Convergence\\" refers to strategies through which individuals adapt to each other's communicative behaviors to reduce these social differences. Meanwhile, \\"divergence\\" refers to the instances in which individuals accentuate the speech and non-verbal differences between themselves and their interlocutors. The speech accommodation theory was developed to demonstrate all of the value of social psychological concepts to understanding the dynamics of speech. It sought to explain \\"... the motivations underlying certain shifts in people's speech styles during social encounters and some of the social consequences arising from them.\\"Particularly, it focused on the cognitive and affective processes underlying individuals' convergence and divergence through speech. The communication accommodation theory has broadened this theory to include not only speech but also the \\"non-verbal and discursive dimensions of social interaction\\". CAT has also created a different perspective from other research in language and social interaction‚Äîand communication more generally‚Äîthat focuses on either interpersonal or intergroup communication.  Social psychology and social identity theory  Like speech accommodation theory, communication accommodation theory continues to draw from social psychology, particularly from four main socio-psychology theories: similarity-attraction, social exchange, causal attribution and intergroup distinctiveness. These theories help to explain why speakers seek to converge or diverge from the language, dialect, accent and behavior of their interlocutors. CAT also relies heavily in social identity theory. This latter theory argues that a person's self-concept comprises a personal identity and a social identity, and that this social identity is based in comparisons people make between in-groups (groups they belong to) and out-groups (groups they do not belong to). According to social identity theory, people strive to maintain a positive social identity by either joining groups where they feel more comfortable or making a more positive experience of belonging to the groups they already belong to. Since speech is a way to express group membership, people adopt convergence or divergence in communication to \\"signal a salient group distinctiveness, so as to reinforce a social identity\\". Communication accommodation thus, becomes a tool to emphasize group distinctiveness in a positive way, and strengthen the individual's social identity. There are four main socio-psychological theories: = Similarity-attraction = Similarity- attraction is one of the biggest contributors to the theory of Communication Accommodation. The similarity-attraction theory posits that \\"The more similar our attitudes and beliefs are to those of others, the more likely it is for them to be attracted to us.\\" Convergence through verbal and non-verbal communication is one of the mechanisms that we can use to become more similar to others, increasing their attraction towards us. For this reason, it can be said that one of the factors that leads individuals to use convergence is a desire to obtain social approval from their interlocutor. It could hence be concluded that \\"the greater one's need for social approval, the greater will be one's tendency to converge\\". Natal√© (1975), for instance, has found that speakers with high needs for approval converge more to another's vocal intensity and pause length than those with low needs for approval. An individual on the receiving end of high level of accommodation is likely to develop a greater sense of self-esteem and satisfaction than being a receiver of low accommodation. = Social exchange process = The social exchange process theory \\"... states that prior to acting, we attempt to assess the rewards and costs of alternate courses of action\\", and that we tend to choose whatever course of action will bring greater rewards and less costs. The Social Exchange Theory is a theory that looks at how people evaluate their relationships. Throughout the process of evaluating relationships, individuals want to feel as if they are receiving more from the relationship than they are expending within the relationship. In other words, people like to be in relationships where the rewards outweigh the costs. Although most often convergence can bring forth rewards, there are some occasions when it can also bring forth costs such as \\"increased effort to converge, a loss of perceived integrity and personal (and sometimes group) identity\\". Hence, when choosing whether or not to use convergence, people assess these costs and rewards. = Causal attribution process = The causal attribution theory \\"[s]uggests that we interpret other people's behavior, and evaluate the individual themselves, in terms of the motivations and intentions that we attribute as the cause of their behavior\\" It applies to convergence in that convergence might be viewed positively or negatively depending on the causes we attribute to it: \\"Although interpersonal convergence is generally favorably received, and non-convergence generally unfavorably received, the extent to which this holds true will undoubtedly be influenced by the listeners attributions of the speaker's intent.\\" Giles and Smith provide the example of an experiment that they conducted amongst French and English speaking Canadians to illustrate this. In this experiment, when individuals believed that the person from the different group used language convergence to reduce cultural barriers, they evaluated it more positively than when they attributed it to the pressures of the situation. \\"When French Canadian listeners attributed an English Canadian's convergence to French as due to his desire to break down cultural barriers, the shift was viewed favorably. However, when this same behavior was attributed to pressures in the situation forcing the other to converge, positive feelings were not so strongly evoked.\\" = Intergroup distinctiveness = The process of intergroup distinctiveness, as theorized by Tajfel argues, \\"... when members of different groups are in contact, they compare themselves on dimensions that are important to them, such as personal attributes, abilities, material possessions and so forth.\\" In these \\"intergroup social comparisons\\" individuals seek to find ways to make themselves positively distinct from the out-group to enhance their social identity. Because speech style and language is an important factor in defining social groups, divergence in speech style or language is often used to maintain intergroup distinctiveness and differentiate from the out-group, especially when group membership is a salient issue or the individual's identity and group membership is being threatened.  Assumptions  Many of the principles and concepts from social identity theory are also applicable to communication accommodation theory. Under the influence of social psychology, especially social identity theory, communication accommodation theory are guided by mainly four assumptions. *There are speech and behavioral similarities and dissimilarities in all conversations. *The way we perceive the speech and behaviors of another determines our evaluation of the conversation. *Language and behaviors have the ability to communicate social status and group belonging between people in a conversation. *Norms guide the accommodation process, which varies in its degree of appropriateness. The first assumption indicates that people bring their past experience to conversations. Therefore, communication is influenced by situational conditions and initial reactions but also the \\"social-historical context in which the interaction is embedded\\". People's attitudes and beliefs, derived from those factors, determine the extent to which they are willing to accommodate in a conversation. The more similarities that they share with each other, the more likely for them to accommodate. The second assumption is concerned with how people perceive and evaluate a conversation. Perception is '\\"the process of attending to and interpreting a message'\\", and evaluation is the \\"process of judging a conversation\\". Someone who enters a conversation usually first observes what takes place and then decides whether he should adjust to fit in. However, the decision about accommodation is not always necessary. If two strangers meet, they may have a random small talk and simply say goodbye. Then, neither of them is likely to evaluate the conversation since they have little chance of meeting again. The importance of language and behavior is illustrated in the third assumption since they are indicators of social status and group belongings. When two people who speak different languages try to have a conversation, the language used is more likely to be the one used by the higher status person. That idea of \\"salient social membership\\" negotiation is illustrated well during an interview as the interviewee usually makes all efforts to identify with the interviewer by accommodating the way that is spoken and behaved to raise the chance of getting the job. The last assumption puts emphasis on social appropriateness and norms. Here, norms are defined as \\" expectations of behaviors that individuals feel should or should not occur in a conversation\\". Those expectations give guidance to people's behaviors, helping them to figure out the appropriate way to accommodate. Most of the time, the accommodation made according to those norms are perceived socially appropriate. For instance, when a young person talks to the seniors in the family, he should avoid using jargons among his generation to show respect and to communicate more smoothly. If the communicator is not careful, this can result in stereotyping if the communicator is not sure about the norms the other person considers to be socially appropriate. Making incorrect assumptions can be more harmful for the relationship than helpful.  Convergence and divergence  = Convergence = Convergence refers to the process through which an individual shifts speech patterns in interaction so that they more closely resemble the speech patterns of speech partners. People can converge through many features of communication such as their use of language, their \\"pronunciation, pause and utterance lengths, vocal intensities, non verbal behaviors, and intimacy of self disclosures\\"(Giles and Smith, 1979, 46), but they do not necessarily have to converge simultaneously at all of these levels. In fact, people can both converge at some levels and diverge through others at the same time. People use convergence based on their perceptions of others, as well as what they are able to infer about them and their backgrounds. Attraction (likability, charisma, credibility), also triggers convergence. As Turner and West note, \\"When communicators are attracted to others they will converge in their conversations.\\" On the other hand, as the similarity attraction theory highlights, when people have similar beliefs, personality and behaviors they tend to be more attracted towards each other. To achieve a \\"desired social distance\\"(Pardo, 2016), people use language to converge more towards a conversational partner they are attracted to. The desire to make social interaction flow subsequently results in convergence. Many people tend to converge with one another because they want to feel a sense of fitting in and experience social approval to the people around them. Thus, when one individual shifts speech and non-verbal behaviors in order to assimilate to the other it can result in a more favorable appraisal of him, that is: when convergence is perceived positively it is likely to enhance both the conversation and the attraction between the listener and the speaker. For this reason it could be said that convergence reflects \\"an individual's desire for social approval\\" from his interlocutor, and that the greater the individual's need for social approval, the more likely he or she is to converge. Besides attraction, other factors that \\"influence the intensity of this\\" need of approval and hence the level of convergence \\"include the probability of future interactions, the social status of the addressee, and interpersonal variability for need of social approval\\". Other factors that determine whether and to what extent individuals converge in interaction are their relational history, social norms and power variables. Because individuals are more likely to converge to the individual with the higher status it is likely that the speech in a conversation will reflect the speech of the individual with the higher status. Converging also increases the effectiveness of communication, which in turn lowers uncertainty, interpersonal anxiety, and increases mutual understanding. This is another factor that motivates people to converge. People adapt their communication behaviors to establish common ground with another individual. This includes vocal tone/volume, word choice, etc. Social distance is the extent to which two people that are communicating with each other are similar or different. Discourse management is the selection of topics in communication that lead to successful exchanges and minimizing social distance. There is, however, the chance of the message sender displaying overconvergence (or overaccommodation). This is when the communicator adjusts to a style that they have little or no experience in, which can often be the result of stereotyping. It is \\"an attempt to overdo efforts in regulating, modifying or responding to others. It has the effect of making the target feel worse.\\" https://www.stmarys-ca.edu ‚Ä∫ sites ‚Ä∫ default ‚Ä∫ files ‚Ä∫ attachments ‚Ä∫ files Some examples may be speaking to an elderly person in \\"baby talk\\" regardless of their mental or psychological state, shouting or exaggerating other behaviors when speaking to a blind person, or speaking very slowly or simply when communicating with someone who is not fluent in our language. Though the message sender often has good intentions when overaccommodating, it can actually further alienate them from the receiver. = Divergence = Divergence is a linguistic strategy whereby a member of a speech community accentuates the linguistic differences between themself and their interlocutor. \\"Given that communication features are often core dimensions of what it is to be a member of a group, divergence can be regarded as a very important tactic of displaying a valued distinctiveness from the other.\\" This helps to sustain a positive image of one's in-group and hence to strengthen one's social identity. Divergence is commonly used to establish dominance or power in an interaction. For example, if a recent college graduate becomes a professor, they might be teaching students who are around the same age as them. Therefore, it is important for the professor to communicate in a way that the students are aware the professor has more authority than them. Another case where there is a need for divergence are when professionals are with clients. In a 2001 study, doctors and patients discussed musculoskeletal disorders and it was observed that there were miscommunications that occurred because the participants chose to converge during the communication rather than to accentuate their position differences. Patients in the study felt more comfortable discussing their problems because they felt \\"positive about their doctor‚Äôs capacity to understand them\\". Communicating in a fashion to make speech different can also be interpreted as a sign of dislike towards a person or group. For example, \\"when you run into a disliked classmate from high school, your vocal pattern becomes more different from that classmate's.\\" This represents the act of divergence because you are purposely changing your speech to not sound like that person.  Components  Further research conducted by Gallois et al. in 1995 has expanded the theory to include 17 propositions that influence these processes of convergence and divergence. They are categorized into four main components: the sociohistorical context, the communicators' accommodative orientation, the immediate situation and evaluation and future intentions. These components are essential to Communication accommodation Theory and affect the course and outcome of intercultural conversations. =Sociohistorical context= The sociohistorical context refers to ways that past interactions between groups the communicators belong to influence the communication behaviors of the communicators. It includes \\"the relations between the groups having contact and the social norms regarding contact\\". These relations between the different groups the communicators belong to influence the communicators' behavior. Socio- historical factors that influence communicators include political or historical relations between nations, and different religious or ideological views of the two groups participating in the conversation. =Accommodative orientation= Accommodative orientation refers to the communicator's \\"... tendencies to perceive encounters with out group members in interpersonal terms, intergroup terms, or a combination of the two\\". There are three factors that are crucial to accommodative orientations: (1) \\"intrapersonal factors\\" (e.g. personality of the speakers), (2) \\"intergroup factors\\" (e.g. communicators' feelings toward outgroups), and (3) \\"initial orientations\\" (e.g., perceived potential for conflict). Issues that influence this last factor include: collectivistic culture context or whether the culture is collectivistic or individualistic; distressing history of interaction, the possible tensions that exist between groups due to past interactions; stereotypes; norms for treatment of groups; and high group solidarity/ high group dependence, how dependent the person's self-worth is in the group. =Immediate situation= The immediate situation refers to the moment when the actual communication takes place. It is shaped by five interrelated aspects: (1) sociopsychological states, (2) goals and addressee focus (e.g., motivations and goals for the encounter), (3) sociolinguistic strategies (e.g., convergence or divergence), (4) behavior and tactics (e.g., topic, accent) and (5) labeling and attributions. =Evaluation and future intentions= This aspect deals with how communicators perceive their conversational partners' behavior and its effects on future encounters between the two groups. Positively rated conversations will most likely lead to further communication between the interlocutors and other members of their respective groups. In action In 1991, Giles, Coupland, and Coupland expressed the belief that a \\"more qualitative perspective\\" would be necessary to get more diverse and clarifying explanations of the behaviors presented within varying contexts. They referred to this as \\"the applied perspective\\" that showed accommodation theory as a vital part of day-to-day activity as opposed to solely being a theoretical construct. They sought to \\"demonstrate how the core concepts and relationships invoked by accommodation theory are available for addressing altogether pragmatic concerns\\". For Giles, Coupland, and Coupland, these \\"pragmatic concerns\\" were extremely varied in nature. One of these \\"pragmatic concerns\\" included understanding the relational issues that present themselves in the medical and clinical fields, such as the relational \\"alternatives, development, difficulties, and outcomes\\" that affected the patients' contentment with their medical interactions‚Äîand whether or not, through these interactions, they agreed with and implemented said health care regimens. Another of these situations involved the potential options in a legal arena. The way that the judges, plaintiffs, and defendants accommodated themselves to both the situation and the jury could manipulate the jury's acceptance or rejection of the defendant, and could, thus, control the outcome of the case. Communication accommodation theory was also found to have a place in media. In regards to radio broadcasting, the alliance of the audience with the broadcaster played an important part in both the ratings that the shows would receive and whether the show progressed or was cancelled. In the area of jobs and employment, accommodation theory was believed to influence the satisfaction one has with his or her job and the productivity that that person possesses in said job through convergence with or divergence from the co-workers and their work environment. Accommodation theory also possessed practical applications in the development of learning a second language. This was seen when the student's education of and proficiency in said language was either assisted or hindered by accommodative measures. Giles, Coupland, and Coupland (1991) also addressed the part that accommodation theory plays in a situation they called language switching, when bilingual individuals must decide which language they should speak when they are in an organizational environment with other bilingual individuals. This can be an incredibly important choice to make, especially in a business setting, because an incorrect judgment in this area of communication could unwittingly promote negative reactions between the two or more parties involved. In addition, accommodation theory was strongly intertwined with the way an immigrant accepts and is accepted by their host country. An instance of over-accommodation from the immigrating individual can unintentionally damage that person's sense of individuality while a strong divergence from the immigrating individual from their host culture can prompt the natives of the host country to react negatively to them because of the immigrating individual's use of divergence. The final area of practical application, as presented by Giles, Coupland, and Coupland (1991), was that of accommodation theory's effect on the lives of people with disabilities. Accommodation theory was thought to either aid them by promoting them to \\"fulfill their communicative and life potentials\\", or by hindering them from reaching their full potential by focusing on the disability that made them different rather than the other characteristics that made them similar to their peers. Despite the fact that communication accommodation theory is theoretical, it has shown itself to be viable by its numerous practical applications.  Criticisms  The Communication Accommodation Theory has obtained scholarly criticism by the three scholars Judee Burgon, Leesa Dillman, and Lesa Stern. These scholars question the \\"convergence-divergence frame... [and] they believe that conversations are too complex to be reduced simply to the processes of the Communication Accommodation theory. They also challenge the notion that people's accommodation can be explained by just the practice of [convergence- divergence]\\". Questions asked by the scholars were: \\"what occurs if people both converge and diverge in conversations, are there consequences to the speaker, the listener, is there an influence if race or ethnicity is played in the process?\\". It causes conflicts between communicators because the theory relies too heavily on a rational way of communicating. Sometimes we as people do not have a rational way of thinking and this becomes a problem when communicating.  Application  The Communication Accommodation theory focuses \\"on the role of conversations in our lives\\". It has been incorporated into \\"the mass media (Bell, 1991), with families (Fox, 1999), with Chinese students (Hornsey and Gallois, 1998), with elderly (Harwood, 2002), on the job (McCroskey and Richmond, 2000), in interviews (Willemyns, Gallois, Callan, and Pittam, 1997), and even with messages left on telephone answering machines (Buzzanell, Burrell, Stafford, and Berkowitz, 1996)\\". The theory tends to be heuristic because it is \\"expansive enough to be complete, and has been supported by research from diverse authors\\". \\"The theory's core processes of convergence and divergence make it relatively easy to understand, underscoring the simplicity of the theory\\". Intergenerational communications Researchers of communication accommodation theory who have been interested in conversations between the elderly and the young, actively apply this theory to analyze intergenerational communication situations. Since the aging of population is becoming a serious issue in current society, communication difficulties of older adults and issues like ageism should be addressed. According to mainstream sociolinguistic studies, age is regarded as a variable only to the extent that it may show patterns of dialectal variation within speech communities across time. However, the existence of potentially important generational differences relating to beliefs about talk, situational perceptions, interactional goals, and various language devices between the young and the elderly are all taken into account as empirical questions in their own right when using communication accommodation theory to explore intergenerational communication problems and improve effectiveness. Previous researchers have also developed models such as the communication predicament model of ageing, and the communication enhancement model of ageing, to point out numerous consequences brought by both negative and positive attitudes towards aging. =Young-to-elderly language strategies= Even though young people are more likely to perceive the old by multiple stereotypes, the elderly are negatively evaluated in most situations, resulting in a reduction of meaningful communication.To further illustrate this, Ryan et al. devised a typology of four young-to-elderly language strategies in his research concerning psycho linguistic and social psychological components of communication with the elderly, addressing a problem for the elderly that they are vulnerable to the social and psychological circumstances of isolation, neglect, and negative stereotyping. However, it is not appropriate to see problematic intergenerational talk as a one-sided affair since both the young and the old can be responsible for miscommunication and unsuitable accommodation. The first of these is characterized as over-accommodation due to physical or sensory handicaps, which happens when speakers talk to handicapped recipients, usually those with hearing impairment, and adapt their speech beyond the optimal level. This is also known as \\"Elderspeak\\", a form of baby talk in which a person addresses the elderly in an overly simple and sometimes patronizing way. The second strategy is labelled as dependency- related over-accommodation, which refers to overbearing, excessively directive and disciplinary speech to the elderly. \\"It was conjectured that this strategy is encoded as one of the means by which a younger person can control the relationship and induce the elderly individual to become dependent on the former\\". Age-related divergence is the third strategy. This tenet proposes that young speakers may seek to amplify the distinctiveness of their own social group by purposefully acting in ways that differ from their stereotype of old speakers. Older speakers might be seen as in physical and mental decline; slowing down with age and unable to keep pace with the current social norms. These young speakers, attempting to differentiate themselves from this image, will talk faster, use fashionable colloquialism and slang, and express more \\"modern\\" ideas and values in their communication with seniors. The fourth strategy is intergroup over-accommodation and it is considered one of the most pervasive of young-to-elderly language strategies. The \\"simple perception of an addressee's social category membership being old ‚Äì and, independently of a particular handicap (if any), considerations of dependency and in-group symbolization are sufficient to invoke negative physical, social, and psychological inferences for many younger people\\". =Communication between old and young people in various relationships= Giles has studied the interaction of young and elderly persons in business settings using communication accommodation as a theoretical framework. Findings demonstrated that elderly persons tend to be less accommodating than their younger counterparts. Findings also demonstrated that, for example, in business settings, one is much more likely to accommodate and converge to the language of a superior, such as a manager, than to someone with less or equal amount of superiority, such as a co-worker. While several other factors came into play, convergence, and divergence portions of this theory were used in interpreting and explain this phenomenon. The prevalence of and consequences for ageism and ageist language in intergenerational interactions in health care contexts such as hospitals and long-term care facilities have also been discussed. Factors such as negative ageist stereotypes and unique features of the older adult patient-physician interaction can result in miscommunication between physicians and patients. Moreover, individuals are more likely to use patronizing language styles, to evaluate patronizing communication positively, and less likely to respond assertively to ageist language in hospital settings than in community dwellings. In the domain of mental health care for older individuals, research also suggests that the elderly are systematically disadvantaged when interacting with mental health professionals. Intercultural communications Since communication accommodation theory applies to both interpersonal and inter-group communication one of the fields in which it has been most applied has been in intercultural communication. Within this field it has been applied to explain and analyze communication behaviors in a variety of situations, such as interactions between non-native and natives during second language acquisition processes, and interactions between inter-ethnic groups. Studies show the comparison of communication accommodation in foreign countries between tourists and locals. In countries with heavy tourism, many being Third World, it is common that the actual tourists have little to no competency in, or desire of having competency in the language and style of communication of the local natives. On the other hand, the country's local economy as well as the livelihood of its citizens, heavily depends on these tourists. Therefore, there is a great need to accommodate the communication styles of the tourists. Communication between native and non-native language speakers in second language acquisition =Non-native language speakers= The input that non-native speakers (NNS) obtain from their interlocutors during second language acquisition is crucial in their process of language learning. For instance, as the similarity attraction theory predicts, non-native speakers (NNS) are more likely to converge towards the native speaker's (NS) language when they identify him or her as similar to themselves: \\"When an NNS and an NS share important social identities, ethnic or not, the NNS will be more likely to converge towards the NS's language use\\". In a study conducted by Young (1998) for instance, high proficiency Chinese English Language Second Speakers interviewed by individuals with a higher degree of social convergence in terms of ethnicity, sex, occupation, educational level, place of origin, and age were significantly more likely to converge to their interlocutor's standard English plural conjunction than those who were interviewed by subjects that differed more in terms of these social characteristics. Unlike previous studies that focussed mostly in ethnic solidarity to explain language variations in second language learners (Beebe and Zuengler, 1983), this later study proved that \\"it is not interlocutor ethnicity alone that causes linguistic variation, but a collection of attributes (of which one is ethnicity) by which interlocutors assess their relative similarity to each other... providing clear support for the similarity-attraction aspect of CAT\\". On the other hand, like the inter- group distinctiveness theory argues, several studies have revealed that when second language learners feel their social identity is threatened due to patronizing behavior towards their ethnic group they are more likely to engage in divergence. In a study conducted by Zuengler (1982) amongst Spanish and Greek speakers learning English, subjects were asked both ethnically threatening and neutral questions by a native English speaker. Those subjects that answered the ethnic-threatening question in a more personal form were noted to decrease the \\"native English-like pronunciations of the sounds\\" in their answers. Similar results were obtained in a study conducted by Giles and Bourhis conducted in Wales. In this study Welshmen with strong ties to their nation and their language who were learning Welsh were asked questions about methods of second language acquisition. In this study the questions were asked by an English speaker with an RP-sounding accent \\"...who at one point arrogantly challenged their reasons for what he called \\"... a dying language which had a dismal future.\\" In response to this question, which greatly threatened their identity and intergroup distinctiveness, the informants diverged considerably by strengthening their Welsh accents and using Welsh. =Native language speakers= Native language speakers frequently engage in \\"foreign talk\\" (FT) when interacting with second language learners. In this type of talk native speakers adopt features such as \\"slower speech rates, shorter and simpler sentence, more question and question tags, greater pronunciation articulation\\" amongst others. This is done to increase efficiency, especially when the native speakers perceive the non-native speakers as less competent communicators, or (as the similarity-attraction theory predicts) to increase attraction. Foreign talk often contains features that mirror the mistakes made by non-native speakers in order to make speech more similar, and hence \\"NS may include ungrammatical features in their FT\\". As predicted by the inter-group distinctiveness theory, native speakers might also choose to refrain from engaging in FT or might use divergence, whenever they wish to maintain group distinctiveness, either because they have a lower perception of the other group, they feel threatened by them, or they wish to display ethnocentricity.  Immigrants  Immigrants tend to converge according to what they perceive to be the prototypical behaviors of their new group, or according to the norms that they infer make part of their new environment. Meanwhile, their new communities \\"also may hold norms, about how immigrants do and/or should use the majority language\\" and \\"convergence that is perceived by members of the host community as inappropriate to the speaker's status, the relationship, or the norms of the situation, may be labelled as ingratiating, condescending or gauche\\". This might lead to a negative appraisal of the immigrant speaker. For this reasons, Gallois and Callan (1991) suggest that it is important to teach immigrants about the norms that govern convergence in each community. Although other personal motives govern immigrant's linguistic choices later on, their expectations and the situational norms that they are able to perceive are what guide their linguistic choices when they are new to a culture.  Family communication dynamics and sexual identity  A research paper uses the basis of the Communication Accommodation Theory along with Intergroup Communication and relational Satisfaction to explain the perception of a family towards homosexuality and how family communication dynamics are impacted when one of the family member has a different sexual identity. In fact, the study was conducted to understand how to parent such a child and the consequences of disclosure on the communication in the family. Sexual identity can be a challenging discussion for a family and revealing one's preferred identity led to topic avoidance under intergroup anxiety and the relational satisfaction was negatively viewed. Such a constrained communication made the individuals feel that their relationship with the family member was less fulfilling and eventually less satisfying. New media As communication accommodation theory explains \\"the cognitions and motivations that underlie interactants' communication\\" with context and identity salience, it is feasible to apply it to new media related settings. Early studies have investigated possible accommodative tendencies of librarians when faced with cyberlanguage use by the patron through instant messaging technology. Since use of cyberlanguage in VRS (virtual reference services) conversations has been suggested as one possible way to strengthen patron relations, patrons who are satisfied with their interaction with a librarian who use cyberlanguage may be more willing to return. However, the result suggests that patron's use of cyberlanguage has no influence on a librarian's use of cyberlanguage and surprisingly convergence doesn't happen. Nevertheless, accommodation of communication styles do happen in other computer-mediated communication circumstances. In group brainstorming conversations, Chinese participants are likely to become as responsive as Americans when working in mixed-culture groups and more talkative when using lean medium. The use of new media provides users an opportunity to more quickly provide or gather information without new or additional disruption. Online media allow informal communication, which shares the complex features of natural communication. Online communication often leaves a written trail, which allows the gathering and analysis of large amounts of data. This has provided evidence for communication accommodation in online communities. An analysis of over 200 million Twitter messages from 189,000 users showed that users significantly adapted their language depending on the group membership of their interlocutors. To date, this is arguably the strongest quantitative evidence for communication accommodation. Case studies =Police officers= Giles has also looked at the actions and attitudes in the public's interaction with police officers, using accommodation theory. Relational and identity aspects of this theory help to illustrate the interaction patterns that exist between the public and the police in the various situations in which these interaction take place.Giles, et al., 2005 This study looked at both the accommodation patterns of the officers and the public with whom they were dealing. In this case of policemen and accommodation, it is important for men and women of the force to find a stable balance between accommodating (displaying care, empathy, respect etc.,) and keeping a firm stance of authority. Studies show that the public believes policemen, overall, should work on being more community oriented and accommodating to all of its citizens, not only to reduce tension, anxiety, and stress, but to build trust and satisfaction between both parties. There are current, as well as up-and-coming community-based police programs to give citizens a more \\"informal\\", \\"down to earth\\", view of their commanding officers. However, even with all of these accommodations being made, it is necessary for there to remain an understanding of the higher power, so that in the case in life-threatening situations, men and women of the police force can continue to actively and effectively uphold society =Pharmacists= From November 2015 to April 2016, a study was conducted to observe the communication between pharmacists and patients during medication counseling sessions. This was conducted in order to understand what is occurring during these exchanges. \\"Twelve pharmacists engaged four patients each for a total of 48 medication counselling interactions that took place\\". During each session, the pharmacists were recorded by one of the main researchers, another pharmacist with no ties to the other pharmacists. In each recording, the main researcher (referred to as BC) specifically searched for five strategies of CAT: approximation, interpretability, discourse management, emotional expression and interpersonal control. * \\"Approximation concerns how individuals adjust their speech patterns\\". Speech in approximation can converge or diverge from the patient, but is appropriately applied with convergence * \\"Interpretability strategies focus on each speaker's conversational competence\\". This means that the speaker communicates in a way to ensure the speaker understands the content of the message. * \\"Discourse management strategies involve conversation processes to promote conversation between interactants\\". This involves using nonverbal or verbal cues to signal a person to speak or change the subject accordingly. * Emotional expression demonstrates \\"empathy and reassurance\\". * \\"Interpersonal control focuses on the roles and power relations between speakers\\". This strategy of CAT establishes common ground between the speakers in a form of equality. Upon conclusion of this study, it was shown that most of the pharmacists used the five CAT strategies during their social exchanges with the patients; however, the presentations of discourse varied by pharmacist. =Speak Arabic please! A case study in communication accommodation = In Sonia S'hiri's Speak Arabic please!: Tunisian Arabic Speakers' Linguistic Accommodation to Middle Easterners\\" she describes how speakers of Tunisian Arabic converge to the \\"Sharqi\\" or \\" Middle Eastern Arabic\\" of their co-workers. One of the many ways to divide the Arab world is between the West Maghreb and the East Sharq. Though there is no official Sharqi Arabic, the varieties usually associated with Sharqi Arabic are Egyptian, Levantine, and Persian Gulf/Iraqi Arabic. Due to Egypt's dominance of the media and arts, the \\"Sharqi\\" Arabic spoken in the region has come to be perceived by Tunisians, as \\"lighter\\", more poetic and artistic, more humorous, more romantic and even more beautiful than the local [Tunisian] variety. Again, because of its dominance in the media and the arts, Arabic speakers throughout the Arab world are much more familiar with \\"Sharqi\\" varieties than they are with \\"Maghrebi\\" varieties. A common yet incorrect belief about speech interactions in the Arab speaking world is that when speakers of different varieties of the language come into contact with one another, the default language for communication is Modern Standard Arabic (Fusha). In her study conducted in London, S'hiri examined the social reasons for Tunisian Arabs to converge linguistically to speakers of \\"Sharqi Arabic\\". The data she found also gave ample evidence to show that code-switching into pure Fusha for communication is a misconception. S'hiri recorded five Tunisian Arabic speakers (M1, M2, W1, W2, and W3) who worked at two different broadcasting companies and found that they did indeed converge linguistically to their Sharqi co-workers. They did not however, resort solely to Fusha. S'hiri found that when interacting with speakers of \\"Sharqi\\" Arabic, her Tunisian informants used linguistic features and lexical items characteristic of the \\"Sharqi\\" variety, some English words, (instead of the French words often used in Tunisian Arabic speech) in addition to switching to Fusha. S'hiri found that many of her informants were proud of both their Tunisian variety of Arabic as well as their ability converge linguistically and even posits the idea of \\"showing off\\" as a goal of linguistic convergence\\". Her findings lead to an interesting sort of paradox. Although the Tunisian Arabs abandon their own variety of the language, they do not experience a feeling of loss of identity, because the ability to code-switch, perceived as prestigious in their culture, makes part of their positive identity. Despite their inner feelings of pride for their own group, by accommodating to the Sharqi speakers the Tunisians are setting aside their ingoup identity in order to \\"promote their extended ethnicity as members of an Arab nation instead of just as Tunisians\\". In terms of accommodation theory, Tunisians in London can be seen as the \\"ingroup\\" trying to assimilate to the \\"outgroup\\". When her informants were asked why they had switched to the \\"Sharqi\\" variety, they all agreed it was psychologically motivating, because it allowed them to get closer to their interlocutors. M1 added that this allowed him to convey friendliness to his interlocutors, to reduce differences and avoid rejection. Informant W2 \\"Found that using TA [Tunisian Arabic] is an obstacle to getting closer to people. She felt excluded especially at the beginning since Sharqis seemed to avoid her because they believed she would be difficult to understand\\". W2 also \\"Claims that the level of readiness of Sharqis to understand her determines whether she uses TA with them or not. She wants to avoid ridicule\\".

History The Illinois Department of Revenue has increased in size in line with the creation of new taxes within the state and the expansion of existing taxes. A gasoline tax was enacted in Illinois in 1927, the sales tax was enacted in 1933; the state income tax was enacted in 1969, and the first lottery tickets were sold in 1974 in the state capital of Springfield.\\"Illinois Tax Handbook for Legislators\\" (21st edition) (July 2005; Legislative Research Unit, Springfield, Illinois), pages 50, 59, 62, and 102. In fiscal year 2007, the Illinois Department of Revenue expected to collect $24.6 billion in taxes and gambling revenues, about five-sixths of the state's general funds revenues for the year. IDOR expected to keep $1.0 billion of this sum (4.0%) to cover the costs of its own operations, and expected to transfer the rest to the office of the Illinois State Treasurer to pay for the ongoing operations of the state.

Kurowski batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine- season career, Kurowski posted a .286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 RBI in 916 games played. Kurowski's childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. Kurowski overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which forced the removal of part of a bone on his right forearm. Before he started his baseball career, his older brother died in a mine accident, and his father died from a heart attack during spring training in 1942. His most productive season came in , when he posted career-highs in average (.310), home runs (27), RBI (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging % (.544) and on-base % (.420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943‚Äì47), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944‚Äì45, 1947), and hit over .300 three times (1945‚Äì47). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding %, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit .253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine RBI in 23 games, as the Cardinals were World Champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the Series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2‚Äì2 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for St. Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the MVP ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \\"All Time All-Star Argument Starter,\\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams.

Originally a small manor house it belonged to Louis de la Saussaye in the 19th C. Louis was a noted for his work in the preservation of old buildings. His 'restoration'of Troussay allowed him to integrate many styles and objects into the building, giving it a very Eclectic style. It is akin to a 6 year old whose raided her mother's wardrobe.  History  The first building is recorded around 1450, although the oldest existing parts of the structure date from the Renaissance. This is when Robert de Bugy, director of the salt storehouses of the region of Blois and squire of King Francis I of France was the recorded owner. There are no records of a Lord of Troussay.No record in Racine's:racineshistoire.free.fr or Medilands: fmg.ac.Medilands or Armorial General de la France In the 17th century, the building was enlarged with a central body and two wings. A magnificent formal French style garden was laid out behind. In 1732, for the first time, the building changed owners: the last Demoiselle de Bugy sold the ch√¢teau to the Pelluys family. In 1741 Gabrielle Pulluys married Christophe de R√©m√©on and the chateau was her dowry. Their son, Claude was a companion to Henri IV.montjoye.net The family retained the ch√¢teau after the revolution, with no recorded damage. The owner was then another Christophe de R√©m√©on who married Marie de la Saussaye. They had no children and so the couple adopted the son of Fran√ßois de Paule de la Saussaye and his wife Anne Louise on his father's death in 1815.La Saussaye Jean Fran√ßois. Les recteure d'acad√®mie en France de 1808, Vol 2, Section 228 Louis inherited after the death of his uncle in 1828. Louis de la Saussaye was a historian of the Loire ch√¢teaux, member of the Institut de France and rector of the Acad√©mies of Lyon and Poitiers. He recognised the problems of protecting the Loire inheritance especially after the destruction of many ch√¢teaux in the Revolution. A friend of Prosper M√©rim√©e and F√©lix Duban, he restored the ch√¢teau with the architect Louis de la Morandi√®re See Historical Listing and incorporated decoration from other destroyed ch√¢teau, according to his own motto \\"fort √† l'abandon\\".Louis de la Saussaye, Annales Troussayennes After his death in 1878 the ch√¢teau passed down to his children.He married Am√©lie Petit-Parreau de la Coudraye in 1828 and had many children- no other info: Persee.fr Les recteurs d'acad√©mie en France de 1808. Vol 2, Section 228 In 1900 the ch√¢teau was sold to Maurice Delamarre de Monchaux, son of Casimir Delamarre de Mouchaux, Count of Monchaux. Maurice had married Isore Hurault de Vibrate in 1896.genea-bdf.org She grew up in Cheverny and wanted to remain close to her family at the Ch√¢teau de Cheverny. Maurice died in 1952 and his daughter Elisabeth inherited the ch√¢teau. Married to Jacques Marcotte de Sainte-Marie in about 1940, her descendants still own the property. Limited areas and the grounds are open to the public.  Description  = Fa√ßade of Fran√ßois I = Door of the Fran√ßois I fa√ßade The \\"Fran√ßois I\\" fa√ßade, is heavily influenced by the Ch√¢teau de Chambord. This formal entrance to the main house has insets of slate in the chimneys and stone mullion windows. The towers, built in the 18th century, have pinnacles, as at Chambord. The right-hand wing (viewed from the formal entrance) houses the domestic offices: the bake house, hay loft and stables. The left-hand wing, built by Louis de Saussaye in the 19th C. houses the grand salon. Which is the reason for the asymmetry. Right tower and sundial Several sculptures decorate the fa√ßade. The Main entrance is flanked by two capitals, one Renaissance from the Ch√¢teau de Bury and saved by Louis de la Saussaye; the other was made in the 19th century by the sculptor Lafargue. Over the entrance the small stone Virgin is a replica of the 15th C. wooden Virgin at the Ch√¢teau de Cheverny. A small relief of a woman from the Italian Renaissance was mounted on the left wing at the time of the restoration. On the right-hand tower is a sundial, surrounded by an inscription in Latin: Ultimam time, fuit hora, carpe diem: \\"fear the last hour, time flees, seize the day\\". Opposite this, on the left-hand tower is a clock with only an hour hand. = Fa√ßade of Louis XII = The garden fa√ßade in Louis XII style The garden fa√ßade is in the Louis XII style: a mixture of late Gothic and early Renaissance. The stone pediments of the dormer windows and bases of windows with linenfold panels are pure Gothic. The most beautiful example of this mixture is the door to the tower: the original main door to the ch√¢teau. It was moved from the Fran√ßois I fa√ßade by Louis de la Saussaye because it was considered too small. One finds linenfold there too, a Gothic motif par excellence, but also, on the door stop, a salamander, an emblem of Fran√ßois I. Above, Louis de la Saussaye had engraved, in Greek, the sentence \\"Small is the house, but oh how much happiness, if it is filled with friends.\\" ascribed to the general Themistocles. Le marmouset The tower dates from the 19th century. Modeled on the towers of the Louis XII wing of the Ch√¢teau de Blois, it shares their most notable characteristic: lattices of red and black bricks. Above a Fran√ßois I shell, a small marmouset commemorates the construction with a banner in Latin: \\"united by friendship, Louis de la Saussaye wanted, Jules de la Morandi√®re realized\\". Other recovered sculptures were also mounted, in particular a porcupine, emblem of Louis XII, from l'h√¥tel Hurault de Cheverny in Blois and two sottise characters: the pope of fools and the insane mother. = Interior = The castle is privately owned and inhabited but six rooms on the ground floor are open to visitors: * the Entrance Hall * the Dining room * the Music room, or \\"Salon Louis de la Saussaye\\" * the Small salon * the Oval salon * the Chapel The ground floor is tiled throughout with red and yellow tiles dating from late 15th C.; only in the oval salon was it removed when the chateau was restored in the 19th C. The ceilings are of notable interest: in the Dining Room, the ceiling √† la fran√ßaise is inspired by the Fran√ßois I wing of the Castle of Blois, it is beamed with painted decoration. The Music room remains one of the original ceilings. The Entrance Hall is vaulted like the Ch√¢teau of Blois, as is the Chapel. The √† l'italienne paintings on the ceiling of the small salon are most remarkable: Attributed to Jean Mosnier from Sologne,The painter known for the cycle of paintings from the Aethiopica (ca. I630-35) in the Kings chamber at Cheverny and the gallery of portraits in the Ch√¢teau de Beauregard the paintings were produced for the Ch√¢teau de Fosse. Found in the 19th century in a house in Fosse by Louis de la Saussaye, they were brought to Troussay and represent a sarabande of cupids, painted in grisaille. One should also note that the fireplace in the Dining room dates from the reign of Fran√ßois I and retains its original colours. On it stands a bust of Jean de Morvilliers (1552He only took up his position in 1557‚Äì1564), bishop of Orl√©ans, who was related to the De Saussaye family, indeed he was succeeded as Bishop of Orleans by his nephew: Mathurin dea Saussaye. Beneath the bust is engraved in Latin \\"do not contemplate in vain the effigy of Jean de Morvilliers, but rather seek to be the imitator of so great a man\\". The ch√¢teau now holds objects of many different times, styles and origins, from the 15th to 19th centuries and from Holland to Portugal. Noted pieces of furniture are perhaps a large armoire from Strasbourg dating from 1700 and a Louis XIII cabinet with marquetry of jasmine and tulip flowers. The most remarkable object is the heavily decorated Renaissance oak door of the chapel, from the Ch√¢teau de Bury.  The park  General view of the park The old French formal garden were completely abandoned in the 18th century; the park was relaid out in the 19th century by Louis de la Saussaye in the English Park style. Currently only a ditch, the vestige of the old water level and two small pavilions remain of the old garden. There are a diverse collection of trees, such as a Cedar of Lebanon planted in the 18th century, Sequoias from America and an immense Blue Cedar.  The Museum of Sologne and the Domestic Exhibition The Domestic wing Troussay celebrates its history Renaissance manor and also the history Solognot agriculture: Cultivated until the middle of the 20th century as an almost completely autonomous community. The two wings made it possible to house the farm workers, animals (pigs, cattle and horses), store food reserves and house a winery, bakery, etc. all within the same complex. Nowadays, the museum of the Sologne is sited in this domestic wing with many agricultural examples of everyday life from the past including a 16th C. screw press, other aspects of daily life at Troussay, including old documents and well dressed tableau's.  Anecdotes  Holly in the main courtyard In front of the Fran√ßois I fa√ßade, stands a holly tree reputed to be more than five hundred years old, planted there according to the Solognote tradition to chase away miscreants with its prickles.

Location Located in the municipal area of El Port de la Selva in the province of Girona, Spain, it was built on the slope of the Verdera Mountain, just below the Castle of Sant Verdera, which provided protection for the monastery but now lies in ruins at the very summit. It offers exceptional views over the bay of Llan√ß√†, to the north of Cap de Creus. Near the monastery Santa Creu de Rodes are the ruins of a medieval town, of which its pre- Romanesque-style church dedicated to Saint Helena is all that remains.  History  Sant Pere de Rodes nave The true origin of the monastery is not known, which has given rise to speculation and legend; such as its foundation by monks who disembarked in the area with the remains of Saint Peter and other saints, to save them from the \\"Barbarian hordes\\" that were invading the Western Roman Empire. Once the danger had passed, the Pope Boniface IV commanded them to build a monastery. The first documentation of the existence of the monastery dates 878, when it was mentioned as a simple monastery cell consecrated to Saint Peter, but it is not until 945 when an independent Benedictine monastery was founded, led by an abbot. Connected with the County of Emp√∫ries, it reached its maximum splendor between the 11th and 12th centuries until its final decay in the 17th century. Its increasing importance is reflected in its status as a point of pilgrimage. In the 17th century it was sacked on several occasions and in 1793 was deserted by the Benedictine community, which was transferred to Vila-sacra and finally settled in Figueres in 1809, until the monastery community was dissolved. The monastery was declared a national monument in 1930. In 1935 the first restoration work was initiated.  Architecture  Inside of the church The buildings are constructed in terraces, given its location. Cloisters of 12th century form the central part of the complex. Around them the rest of constructions are distributed. The church, consecrated in the year 1022, is an example of Romanesque style; it has nave and two vaulted. These are bordered by a double column with capitals influenced by the Carolingian style. The double column support arches separating the nave from the aisles. Columns and pillars have been taken from a former Roman building. The nave ends with an arch leading to the apse, continued in the two aisles. Under the apse is a crypt. The church synthesizes a number of original styles including Carolingian, Romanesque and Roman. The monastery is considered one of the best examples of Romanesque architecture in Catalonia. In the western facade of the monastery is a 12th- century square-shaped bell tower, influenced by the Lombard style from the previous century. To the side is a defensive tower, that was probably began in the 10th century but finished later after several modifications.

Former members include Ryan Sinn (bass guitar, backing vocals), Adam \\"Atom\\" Willard (drums), Matt Wachter (bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) and Eddie Breckenridge (bass guitar). The band formed after Blink-182 went on hiatus in 2005. They continued to record and tour despite DeLonge reigniting his career with Blink-182 in 2009, and after DeLonge subsequently parted with Blink-182 in 2015, he began to focus on Angels & Airwaves more extensively. To date, the band has released five studio albums: We Don't Need to Whisper (2006), I-Empire (2007), Love (2010), Love: Part Two (2011) and The Dream Walker (2014). The project also resulted in the documentary film Start the Machine (2008). In 2011, accompanying the two Love albums, the group scored and produced the science fiction drama film Love by director William Eubank in 460 theatres nationwide during their multimedia event, Love Live. The band released an animated short named Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker and their fifth album, The Dream Walker, on December 9, 2014. Other related media, such as comic books and a live-action film, followed in 2015. The group has been described by DeLonge as more than a band, but more accurately \\"an art project [that approaches] larger human themes and tackles them in different mediums,\\" or simply \\"a multimedia project.\\" This has been seen in the group's films, live events, and novel approach to fan-artist interaction. Of the first two albums, the band says that they were mainly influenced by the music of Radiohead and Pink Floyd, combining them with the grandiosity of U2. Of the first album, DeLonge said that it would be \\"the best music in generations\\". History =Formation and origins (2004‚Äì05)= Tom DeLonge began working on new material during Blink-182's final tour in 2004 and shortly after they began their break in February 2005. For half a year he worked alone in his home studio before gathering musicians to form the band. Upon fiddling randomly for several weeks with the band's logo, DeLonge realized that if he were to invert the middle \\"A\\" of the band's acronym into what appeared to be a \\"V\\", he would have the name of his daughter, Ava. As rumors were floating around about the band's \\"break-up\\", DeLonge chose to abstain for six months from any interviews surrounding the issue and his future plans; instead he concentrated on writing and recording in his home-based studio. In September 2005, he finally spoke publicly in Kerrang! magazine, where he unveiled the name of his new band, Angels & Airwaves. The band included former Hazen Street guitarist and high-school friend David Kennedy, former Rocket from the Crypt and The Offspring drummer Atom Willard and former The Distillers bass guitarist Ryan Sinn. Atom Willard told Shave magazine that the experience of all the members of the band made the band formation very easy. \\"There's nobody trying to figure out what is and what isn't going to work, not just for themselves but for music and for a band, what life's going to be like on the road and all that kind of stuff. Everybody had enough experience to just buckle down and do the work. It really has made it easier than anything else.\\" =We Don't Need to Whisper (2005‚Äì07)= Hyde Park in June 2006. Soon after forming, the band began recording its first album in DeLonge's studio in California from mid-2005 to early 2006. However, after a fan e-mail hacked DeLonge and stole four demos, Angels & Airwaves had no other choice but to release \\"The Adventure\\" as their first single, which was leaked onto radio stations, causing a premature release on May 18, 2006. A few days later, on May 23, they released their first album, We Don't Need to Whisper. The album reached No. 4 on the Billboard 200, and went gold in both the US and Canada. Despite this success, critics gave generally mixed reviews, with one noting that \\"while well-intentioned [the band] failed to reach the lofty heights to which they aspire\\", especially in light of claims made by DeLonge that the album would be \\"the greatest rock and roll revolution for this generation\\". Yet, later that year, popularity picked up with the release of singles \\"The War\\", \\"Do It For Me Now\\" and \\"It Hurts\\". The remainder of the year into 2007 was taken up with tours, and in early 2007, the supergroup returned to the studio to work on a follow-up album. However, problems accumulated and on April 23, 2007, Angels & Airwaves announced that Ryan Sinn would not play at the Free Earth Day concert at the M.I.T. campus due to difficulties within the band. Following this incident, on May 15, Sinn posted on the Army of Angels fan club message board stating that he was \\"no longer a part of Angels & Airwaves\\" and had received a call on the evening of April 19 concluding his relationship with the band. Matt Wachter (the former bass guitarist of 30 Seconds to Mars), filled in for the show and was later confirmed as a permanent member. =I-Empire (2007‚Äì09)= The second studio album, titled I-Empire and the first song \\"Everything's Magic\\" were leaked to the Internet, and on August 25, 2007, it was the most requested song on California radio station KROQ. Angels & Airwaves began streaming the song on their MySpace profile on August 28, 2007. It also became available on iTunes, and reached number three on the iTunes Rock Chart on September 11, 2007, before the song was even made available for nationwide airplay. The band recorded the video for the single on January 20 and 21, and it was premiered on MTV2 Unleashed on February 25, 2008. Their second single \\"Secret Crowds\\" was released on February 4, 2008, along with an accompanying video. The band released a third single, \\"Breathe\\", that was released onto the Internet on June 20. Angels & Airwaves performed at every location on Warped Tour 2008. They also made a fall tour in support of Weezer. DeLonge revealed that during the duration of the first two albums, he was addicted to painkillers due to suffering a slipped disc in his back some years prior. The band took a break from performing in 2009 while DeLonge reunited with Blink-182 for a summer tour. During their time off, Atom Willard joined Social Distortion as touring drummer, while Matt Wachter and David Kennedy began work on the upcoming film. =Love and Love Album: Part Two (2009‚Äì12)= When DeLonge and Willard returned in the fall, the band resumed production of its next album. Love is the third studio album by Angels and Airwaves, which was officially released worldwide on February 14, 2010, after being delayed from Christmas 2009. Fuel TV also released it two days earlier for Modlife members, along with Mark Hoppus' remix of \\"Hallucinations\\" available to those who donated when downloading the album. The album was released free of charge due to \\"corporate underwriting\\". They began producing it in January 2009 but progress was slow due to Blink-182 reuniting and going on tour. The band finished the album in time for its release on Valentine's Day 2010. Love was downloaded nearly 500,000 times during the first 48 hours after its release day. The first single from the album, \\"Hallucinations\\", was made available for free through the band's Modlife on December 23, 2009. The band also released the video via Modlife on March 7, 2010. The band toured North America, starting on March 27 in Anaheim, California. The tour ended on May 30 in Ventura, California, and DeLonge returned to Blink-182 to prepare for their upcoming album and European tour. DeLonge originally revealed that there would be another tour, rumored to have UK dates, after the release of the Love film in the autumn, but plans were changed due to DeLonge's commitments with Blink-182. \\"Epic Holiday\\" is on the soundtrack to the German film Kokow√§√§h with Til Schweiger. The second studio album in the Love project, Love: Part Two, was released on November 8, 2011. DeLonge described the album as better than the first part of Love and also confirmed that there would be a box set with both albums and a DVD of the movie. The first single released was \\"Anxiety\\"; it was premiered following Love Live on August 10, 2011. The music video for \\"Anxiety\\" was released on YouTube on August 11, 2011. It was made available for purchase on iTunes on September 14, 2011. Before the release of Love: Part II, DeLonge revealed that Angels & Airwaves had already begun working on two new albums and two corresponding films. On October 4, it was announced on their Facebook page that drummer Atom Willard had left the band. The departure seemed to be a mutual understanding and Atom thanked the members of Angels & Airwaves for a great six years of making music together. On October 7, it was announced that Angels & Airwaves would be part of the lineup for the Soundwave Festival in Australia, in February and March 2012. It was announced on October 20, 2011, that Ilan Rubin, famous for his work with Lostprophets and Nine Inch Nails, was the new drummer of the band. In March 2012, it was confirmed that Angels & Airwaves would perform the 2012 Reading & Leeds festivals in August 2012. The band also performed at the annual KROQ Weenie Roast concert on May 5, 2012. On November 9, 2012, a new EP bundle pack titled Stomping the Phantom Brake Pedal was announced as limited pressing. =The Dream Walker (2014‚Äì16)= On April 1, 2014, Tom DeLonge announced via his official Facebook page that the band's fifth album would be released on October 31, 2014. The announcement came with another still from the POET film depicting a futuristic city. In an interview with Alter The Press! published on June 6, 2014, DeLonge confirmed the scheduled release date and says of the album: \\"There are things that will never change, like my melodic sensibility and the way that I write. But the song structures, arrangements, chord progressions and tonalities have all changed radically.\\" This came in the wake of recent reflections in the nature of the previous albums. DeLonge felt it was a needed departure for the band since he felt like everything was beginning to sound the same. It was revealed on June 24 that Matt Wachter had left the band to concentrate on his family. DeLonge posted a message on Facebook explaining that they are still both close friends and that Matt would possibly join them again one day. On July 4, Angels & Airwaves completed filming their new music video for the new single on the album that comes out on Halloween. On July 9, Tom DeLonge confirmed in a photo post on the band's Facebook page that Eddie Breckenridge (of the post- hardcore band Thrice) had joined Angels & Airwaves. A new song from the upcoming album, titled \\"Paralyzed\\", was made available for purchase via MixRadio. Engineer Aaron Rubin confirmed that this version was not yet mastered. He also confirmed that the final version will be released on October 5. DeLonge announced via his Twitter account that \\"Paralyzed\\" is not the first single off The Dream Walker. \\"Paralyzed\\" was premiered on RollingStone.com on October 7. On October 26, the first single from The Dream Walker, The Wolfpack, was leaked on Soundcloud. On October 30, 2014, Tom DeLonge released the track list for The Dream Walker album. On December 8, the full The Dream Walker album streamed exclusively with Rolling Stone. In light of recent speculation as to the status of David Kennedy and Eddie Breckenridge with the band, DeLonge confirmed during an interview with Rock Sound on November 11 that both members were still involved with Angels & Airwaves, though he did not specify to what extent, claiming \\"I think people are just confused. I get it, but I try to tell people to look at the whole project, not at any one piece. This isn't just a band, it's a little bit of a moving target and a much bigger project.\\". On January 28, 2015, the music video for \\"Tunnels\\" was released, featuring footage from DeLonge's animated film, Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker. The video also features David Kennedy and Eddie Breckenridge playing alongside DeLonge and Rubin. There came news that video was finished in July 2014, but was released later, bringing to speculation whether Kennedy and Breckenridge are still in the band. After his departure from blink-182 in January 2015, Tom DeLonge said in interview in March, that he expected to release four albums in 2015 ‚Äì two Angels & Airwaves albums and two solo albums ‚Äì three of which would include a companion novel. On September 4, 2015, the band released the EP ...Of Nightmares, as the first of the promised albums by DeLonge, which was followed by a graphic novel of the same name, written by DeLonge and Suzanne Young in October. However, by the end of the year, this (along with DeLonge's solo album To the Stars... Demos, Odds and Ends) ended up being the only album released. The band released the EP Chasing Shadows on April 5, 2016, accompanied by the novel of the same name, written by DeLonge and A. J. Hartley.http://tothestars.media/collections/new- products/products/chasing-shadows-collectible-package?variant=14604069255 On May 4, 2016, the band released a 26-track album of demos from The Dream Walker sessions on To the Stars website. =Strange Times and upcoming sixth album (2017‚Äìpresent)= In February 2017, DeLonge announced that he would be directing a film, Strange Times, which would be based on his graphic novel series of the same name. The movie was set to feature new Angels & Airwaves songs, while the next album would serve as the soundtrack. Production of the film was slated to begin in late 2017, but in December 2018, DeLonge announced that TBS would be adapting the novels into a television series instead, and that he would be acting as a producer rather than a director. In August, the We Don't Need to Whisper ‚Äì Acoustic EP was announced, and released on August 25, 2017. DeLonge stated that he \\"wanted to give the fans something while the band works on the soundtrack to the upcoming Strange Times film.\\" In April 2018, DeLonge confirmed that both David Kennedy and Matt Wachter had rejoined the band, and would perform on the new album. In April 2019, the band signed a record contract with Rise Records. On April 30, the band released their single, \\"Rebel Girl\\". The release confirmed the band's current line-up of DeLonge, Kennedy, and Rubin, with no explanation for Wachter's absence being given by the band or Wachter himself. Following the release, the band announced a 23-date North American tour, which would feature former Taking Back Sunday bassist, Matt Rubano. The band played their first live show in seven years on August 28, 2019, in Solano Beach, California, where they also debuted another new song, \\"Kiss & Tell\\", before releasing it the next day. In November 2019, the band announced plans for a winter tour beginning in December, as well as a projected release date for the album in 2020. Part way through the tour in January, the remaining dates were rescheduled after DeLonge was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection. The rescheduled dates were eventually cancelled in April due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In response to the pandemic, the band wrote another new song \\"All That's Left Is Love\\", which was released on April 16, 2020. It was also revealed that all profits made from the song would be donated to Feeding America's COVID-19 relief fund. Television appearances In \\"Even Fairy Tale Characters Would Be Jealous\\", November 9, 2008, episode of One Tree Hill, aired on the CW Network, the band was asked to perform at a USO concert for US Marines. The band members were eager for their appearance on the show, as they joined the ranks of past bands who have been guests on One Tree Hill. Angels & Airwaves delivered a couple of songs for their stint on the series. During the USO concert, they played the single \\"Secret Crowds\\", while \\"Lifeline\\" was played on the closing credits. Films Start the Machine is a documentary that focuses on the break-up of Blink-182, the genesis of Angels & Airwaves, and the making of their first album We Don't Need to Whisper. It was released on DVD on June 17, 2008. Start the Machine was filmed over a course of almost three years. Love is a science fiction film directed by William Eubank and starring Gunner Wright that was released in a special event called Love Live on August 10, 2011. \\"It starts in the Civil War and you travel through time and space. There's a couple of different storylines. The main one is, a guy gets sent up to the International Space Station, and he gets abandoned up there. He doesn't know why. So throughout his years of being stuck up there, he sees the Earth starting to collapse below. He ends up basically becoming the last person alive. And then decades later, he wakes up one day and there's something outside of the ISS, in low Earth orbit with him.\\" In late 2014, the band released an animated short film called Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker, supporting their album The Dream Walker. Graphic art The band's albums have featured space rock images with considerable influences from the work of Storm Thorgerson. The band members explicitly state that there are Pink Floyd influences in their work. In November 2011, the band released a special edition copy of their film Love in graphic novel format with the double album and movie from the band's official website. The band released the graphic novel Poet Anderson: ...Of Nightmares on October 6, 2015, written by DeLonge and Suzanne Young. It was accompanied by the EP ...Of Nightmares, released on September 4, 2015.

The control is the number of children birthed to the parents and is modified as the number of children reaches the maximum. There is evidence that little birth control is used in non-European countries. Natural fertility tends to decrease as a society modernizes. Women in a pre-modernized society typically have given birth to a large number of children by the time they are 50 years old, while women in post-modernized society only bear a small number by the same age. However, during modernization natural fertility rises, before family planning is practiced. Historical populations have traditionally honored the idea of natural fertility by displaying fertility symbols. Birth control Natural fertility is a concept developed by the French historical demographer Louis Henry to refer to the level of fertility that would prevail in a population that makes no conscious effort to limit, regulate, or control fertility, so that fertility depends only on physiological factors affecting fecundity. In contrast, populations that practice birth control will have lower fertility levels as a result of delaying first births (a lengthened interval between menarche and first pregnancy), extended intervals between births, or stopping child-bearing at a certain age. Such control does not assume the use of artificial means of fertility regulation or modern contraceptive methods but can result from the use of traditional means of contraception or pregnancy prevention (e.g., coitus interruptus). Many social norms or practices effect fertility regulation including celibacy, the age at marriage and the timing and frequency of sexual intercourse, including periods of prescribed sexual abstinence. Breastfeeding has also been used to space births in areas without birth control. Ansley Coale and other demographers have developed several methods for measuring the extent of such fertility control, in which the idea of a natural level of fertility is an essential component.See, e.g., When women have access to birth control, they can better plan their pregnancies. This leads to better health outcomes and enhances their lives and those of their families. Birth control has dramatically improved the ability of all women to participate actively and with dignity in economies across the world. Birth control allows many women to delay childbearing until they believe they are emotionally and financially ready to be a parent. Children who are born in an unplanned pregnancy tend to occur outside relationships. Birth Control has been the main tool to prevent unplanned births, and with greater access to birth control unplanned pregnancies have declined.  Proximate determinants  The 28-day menstrual cycle is depicted; the cycle starts at the onset of the age at menarche. Proximate determinants describe variables that affect a female's fertility. There are seven proximate determinants of natural fertility, four of which affect the inter-birth interval: This picture portrays the different stages a woman will experience between first becoming fertile at menarche through menopause. The different colors on the graph represent different things as well. The red stands for areas relating to a woman's menstrual cycle, the green represents marriage, blue means birth, and black regards menopause and conception at different areas of the diagram. The purple arrows show the period of gestation following conception, and the orange arrows show lactational infecundability. * Age at menarche, which is the age at which a female starts her menstrual cycle * Age at marriage, used to mark the period of time in which a female is sexually mature * Interbirth interval, the amount of time between births. ** Waiting time to conception, or the time it takes for the woman to become pregnant, including the time for sperm to travel to the egg and form a zygote ** Time added by fetal loss, also called postpartum infecundability, which is the amount of time necessary after a fetal loss for the womb to recover and be able to become fertile again ** Length of gestation, the nine-month period of fetal development in the womb ** Duration of lactational infecundability, which refers to the interval of time in which a mother is breastfeeding and usually cannot become pregnant * Age at menopause, which is the age at which a female no longer has her menstrual cycle Factors like the age at which a woman marries and the inter-birth interval are influenced by social factors like education, religion, and wealth. Educated women tend to delay childbirth and have fewer offspring. In sub-Saharan Africa where gender disparities in education are more prevalent, fertility rates are the highest in the world. Globally, 58 million girls do not attend primary school. Half of those girls live in sub-Saharan Africa; this disparity only widens as the level of education increases. Prevalence of child marriage is an attributing factor to the fertility rates in India as women ages 20‚Äì24 reported that they had never used contraception prior to giving birth or within their first year of marriage. Child marriage in India primarily occurs in girls living in poor socioeconomic conditions. Furthermore, women married as minors in South Asia, where half of child marriages occur, reveal having high numbers of unwanted pregnancies than their counterparts that married as adults.  Practicing natural fertility  left = Populations in practice = * Hutterite communities in Russia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, and Montana do not practice any form of birth control * Laestadians (Apostolic Lutherans) do not practice any form of birth control. Some communities in northern Scandinavia are dominantly Laestadian. * Old World Amish communities are prohibited from using any form of birth control by their religion and tend to have high fecundity rates *!Kung San of Namibia, Botswana, and Angola do not practice any form of birth control. However, their total fertility rates are typically lower than other natural fertility populations due to low resources and therefore increased lactational infecundability. Infanticides may occur during these periods to compensate for overpopulation and to preserve resources. The three main reasons for practicing natural fertility include financial status, accessibility to family planning, and religious influences. = Reasons for practice = Common reasons communities or individuals will practice natural fertility include concerns about developing medical conditions (including future infertility), pre-existing health conditions (including PCOS), cost of birth control, religious prohibition, lack of availability of birth control, and lack of information about birth control methods. Location also tends to be a factor in regards to the availability of both contraceptives and education on sexual practice. For example, less developed areas, including, but not limited to those extending throughout inland Africa lack access to the drugs necessary to control fertility or informative lessons describing their correct usage.  Influences on natural fertility rates  = Fertile window = The number of children born to one woman can vary dependent on her window from menarche to menopause. The average window of fertility is from 13.53 to 49.24. Taking into consideration lactational amenorrhea and the period between conception and birth, the average woman is capable of experiencing around 20 births. However, if the duration of lactation is cut short due to use of a formula substitute or the woman has multiple births, the number of offspring could exceed 20. = Male contribution = Natural fertility is not only influenced by women and their conscious decisions, but also their male counterparts. Even if a woman is unexposed to contraceptives, lacks knowledge of family planning, or purposely refrains from practicing regulated fertility, she could still struggle to conceive. Over the past half century, there has been an increase in scientific data supporting the decline in male sperm count. The decrease is attributed to various environmental toxins that are accumulating as the planet continues to industrialize. If sperm count remains above 60 million per ejaculate, fertility remains normal. But sperm counts are continuing to drop. At such low levels, the sperm often are incapable of successfully fertilizing the egg. As a result, women tend to run into more difficulties when trying to conceive, even if they try to do so naturally. = Preconditions for fertility decline = Ansley J. Coale developed a theory to predict when a population's fertility would begin to decline. His theory focused on three specific aspects. First, a couple must make conscious choice to control their fertility. This is closely related to secularization as some religions prohibit means of contraception. Second, there must be a benefit to controlling fertility that results in the desire for a smaller family. For example, as more regions move away from agriculture children are no longer needed to help with labor and fertility rates and family size tend to decrease. Third, the couple must be able to control fertility. This means that access to contraceptives or other means of limiting fertility must be available. Coale's preconditions for fertility decline is interrelated to the Demographic Transition, a theory of the transition of societies from an agricultural to an industrial system. A more modernized society has lower mortality and fertility rates while a less modernized society tends to have higher mortality and fertility rates. Developing countries in the early stages of the demographic transition are characterized by high fertility and mortality rates which can be attributed to the lack of medical interventions like birth control and modern technology. Communicable diseases and contaminated resources like water and consequently food, plague developing countries. As a consequence, people of all ages die in masses. Coale's theory favored a fertility decline as a smaller population would allow for a more beneficial spread of resources and keep the number of ill individuals concentrated to a smaller group. In addition, Coale viewed the development of Europe's infrastructure during the Industrial Revolution as a mark in its transition in the demographic transition. Mortality and fertility rates declined with their improved standard of living. Infant mortality rates are indicative of fertility rates as couples decide to have a lot children knowing that a number of them will die so that even after those children die, they have sufficient kids to aid in agricultural work. Conversely, developed countries in the later stages of the demographic transition experience lower fertility and mortality rates due to the accessibility of contraception, the pursuit of higher education in women, and marriage at a later age. Coale's theory can be observed in sub-Saharan Africa as countries residing within this region have fertility levels that are declining at a much slower rate than before and have one of the highest projected population growths compared to other areas of the world. Individuals inhabiting sub-Saharan Africa have slowly rejected Coale's second precondition for fertility decline which, as stated before, is willingness. They are resistant and unwilling to accept the integration of modern forms of contraception. This can be attributed to the influence of religion and the values it imposes on culture even in individuals who don't practice any religion. To add on, the society they live in encourages young marriages and values large families. Despite the discrepancy between preferred child bearing and natural fertility, women in Africa have reported they don't use any form of contraception to prevent pregnancies. All of these factors have contributed to the slowing down of fertility decline in Africa.

His formative years were spent in housing projects in New Britain Connecticut. These early experiences instilled in him a compassionate and realistic work ethic, as well as an unshakeable desire for social change and economic justice. He converted to Islam in 1977 while serving in the United States Air Force and shortly after changed his name to Zaid Salim Shakir. Education A summa cum laude graduate, he obtained a BA in International Relations at American University in Washington, D.C., earned his MA in Political Science at Rutgers University.\\"Berkeley Center for Peace, Religion and World Affairs\\", http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/people/zaid-shakir He then left for Syria to pursue his studies in the traditional Islamic Sciences. For seven years in Syria, and briefly in Morocco, he immersed himself in an intense study of Arabic, Islamic law, Quranic studies, and spirituality with some of the top Islamic scholars of our age, such as Sheikh  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn al-ShƒÅgh≈´rƒ´\\"Al- hada‚Äôiq al-nadiyya fƒ´ al-nasamat al-ruhiyya (\\"The Dewy Gardens in the Spiritual Breezes\\"), Damascus, DƒÅr fajr al-‚Äòur≈´ba, 2nd ed., 1998\\",al-ShƒÅgh≈´rƒ´ and Sheikh Mustafa Al-Turkmani. In 2001, he was the first American male graduate from Syria's Abu Nour University with a BA in Islamic Sciences. Recent work in the United States Zaytuna College In 2003, as a scholar-in- residence at Zaytuna Institute located in California, Shakir began to teach Arabic, Law, and Islamic spirituality. In 2004, he initiated a pilot seminary program at Zaytuna Institute, which was useful in Zaytuna College‚Äôs refinement of its Islamic Studies curriculum and its educational philosophy. For four years, students in the pilot program were engaged in the study of contemporary and classical texts. And, in the fall of 2010, he and his colleagues Hamza Yusuf, and Hatem Bazian co-founded the Berkeley, California based Zaytuna College, a four-year Muslim liberal arts college, the first of its kind in the United States,http://www.zaytunacollege.org/about/ dedicated to \\"educate and prepare morally committed professional, intellectual, and spiritual leaders\\", who are grounded in the Islamic scholarly tradition and conversant with the cultural currents and critical ideas shaping modern society. In 2016, Zaytuna College became the first accredited Muslim campus in the United States after it received approval from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Views As reported in The New York Times, Zaid Shakir appeared with nine other influential Muslim scholars in a YouTube video denouncing militant Islam. The aftermath of 911 Shakir states, \\"People all over the world have felt the repercussions and the reprisals for the senseless brutality of 9/11‚Äôs perpetrators.

The majority of the roadway is the former alignment of U.S. Route 22, maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation as a Quadrant Route, and is not signed except on small white segment markers. Tilghman Street begins at Pennsylvania Route 100 in Fogelsville, though SR 1002 continues west on Main Street (also old US 22) to the intersection of Church Street (SR 3014). It becomes Union Boulevard just east of the bridge over the Lehigh River in Allentown; SR 1002 ends at the interchange with Pennsylvania Route 378 in Bethlehem. Union Boulevard continues over Monocacy Creek, which forms the border between Lehigh and Northampton Counties, and ends in downtown Bethlehem. The highway attracts more than the average traffic for roads in the Lehigh Valley. An average of 21,018 vehicles use it in South Whitehall Township and 21,706 in Allentown each day. History When the state began taking over state highways through the Sproul Road Bill, signed May 31, 1911, this system did not include the direct Allentown-Harrisburg route that Interstate 78 and the parallel Tilghman Street now form part of. The main route to Harrisburg, which would soon become the William Penn Highway, left Allentown further south, on Hamilton Boulevard (now Pennsylvania Route 222 and U.S. Route 222); the portion near Allentown was Legislative Route 157 (LR 157). Another route west from Allentown (LR 163, later U.S. Route 309) ran northwest from Allentown via Walbert Avenue to Schnecksville. Travelers could continue via New Tripoli to Lenhartsville, and then along a route approximating the present I-78 to Harrisburg. From Allentown east to downtown Bethlehem, LR 159 used Hanover Avenue and Broad Street. No state highways existed within the city limits of Allentown. The William Penn Highway was organized as an alternative to the Lincoln Highway being parallel to the Pennsylvania Railroad west of Harrisburg. The route's New York Extension, adopted in 1916, passed through Allentown. The state assigned the Pennsylvania Route 3 designation to this road in 1924, and in 1926 it became part of U.S. Route 22. The road west from Allentown, now College Heights Boulevard, Broadway, Tilghman Street, and Main Street, was designated LR 443 in 1925,Public Law 191, passed April 8, 1925 and soon the entire shortcut between Allentown and Harrisburg was designated Pennsylvania Route 43. The New York Times was recommending use of this cutoff by early 1931 and the American Association of State Highway Officials officially moved US 22 to PA 43 on June 8, 1931. The Pennsylvania Department of Highways moved the William Penn Highway name to match. Tilghman Street and Union Boulevard (then Union Street) were once local streets in Allentown and Bethlehem, with no bridge over the Lehigh River connecting them; Allentown built that bridge in 1929. Built in 1928, the viaduct is the oldest bridge on SR 1002. Prior to 1931, there were no state highways in Allentown or a number of other major cities in the state. However, the state did define paths through these cities for the public; in Allentown, US 22 used Hamilton Street, and PA 43 entered on Liberty Street and turned south on 17th Street to reach Hamilton Street. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed, on June 22, 1931, a law defining state highways through these cities and changing routes in other cities. LR 443 was defined to use College Heights Boulevard and Tilghman Street to 15th Street, where LR 157 continued along Tilghman Street and Union Boulevard to the Allentown-Bethlehem line. LR 159 was redefined to begin at the same point, continuing on Union Boulevard to Main Street in downtown Bethlehem (and beyond to Easton).Public Law 720, No. 262, passed June 22, 1931 The newest part of Tilghman Street includes the bridge over Little Cedar Creek in Trexler Park west of Cedar Crest Boulevard, which dates to 1936, and bypasses the older route via Broadway and College Heights Boulevard. Tilghman Street and Union Boulevard became a major long- distance traffic route, and had eight diners as a reminder of this past importance. 1939 map of Tilghman Street (old US 22) In addition to US 22, Tilghman Street also carried U.S. Route 309 and Pennsylvania Route 29 between 19th Street and Seventh Street. They were moved from Hamilton Street with US 22 in 1931, and to a freeway bypass of Allentown in the late 1950s. The Lehigh Valley Thruway, a freeway taking US 22 around Allentown and Bethlehem to the north, was opened on September 21, 1954.Matt Assad, The Morning Call, Route 22: Fifty years, one billion cars, September 19, 2004 With the opening of these two highways, and the western extension of the Thruway in the late 1950s, no signed Traffic Routes remained on Tilghman Street and Union Boulevard, yet the road was still state maintained. It still carried LR 443, LR 157, and LR 159 through the cities, since the Thruway was assigned a new number -- LR 772 -- but west of the crossing at Kuhnsville, LR 443 was moved to the freeway, and the old route became LR Old 443, later LR 443 Parallel. The road west of Church Street in Fogelsville, which was also a state highway (LR 39084), was removed from the state highway system in the late 1970s.Public Law 1242, No.428, passed September 27, 1978 A gap in LR 159 through downtown Bethlehem was created in 1971, at the same time as Washington Avenue and Stefko Boulevard were added to the system as a bypass, with Union Boulevard east of Pennsylvania Route 378 becoming a city street.Public Law 640, No. 164, passed December 15, 1974 Thus in 1987, when the new Location Referencing System was adopted, only the portion of Tilghman Street and Union Boulevard between Church Street and PA 378 was assigned a new number: State Route 1002. In late October 2012, the Tilghman Street Bridge over the Lehigh River was repaved in order to accommodate construction vehicles for the long-awaited beginning of the American Parkway Bridge project. Route description = Tilghman Street = Allentown SR 1002 begins at an intersection with Church and Main Streets (State Route 3014) in Fogelsville. It then proceeds east for three-tenths of a mile (0.5 km) as Main Street to an intersection with Pennsylvania Route 100. Upon crossing SR 100, SR 1002 becomes Tilghman Street. As Tilghman Street approaches the limited-access U.S. Route 22, the road splits into two carriageways in preparation for an interchange with US 22, northeast of where US 22 separates from Interstate 78. Past the interchange with US 22, Tilghman Street returns to an undivided roadway and enters the village of Cetronia. At an intersection with Werley Road, SR 1002 connects to Interstate 476 (the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike) via a ramp leading to the toll plaza for the nearby I-476/US 22 interchange. SR 1002 continues to the southeast, passing over the turnpike. After turning to the northeast, Tilghman Street has a cloverleaf interchange with Pennsylvania Route 309. SR 1002 enters Allentown one quarter mile west of this interchange just before its intersection with 40th Street. Tilghman Street then re-enters South Whitehall for about one block as it crosses Cedar Crest Boulevard, a local north-south arterial, before entering into the city's incorporated limits for a second time. In Allentown, Tilghman Street (SR 1002) crosses more than 30 major streets in the city. In the more populated part of the city, SR 1002 intersects the 6th and 7th street one-way couplet forming Pennsylvania Route 145. East of 4th Street, the road uses the Tilghman Street Bridge to cross Jordan Creek and American Parkway. After intersecting Front Street, SR 1002 crosses the Lehigh River on the Tilghman Street Viaduct and becomes Union Boulevard. Tilghman Street is still found in east-side Allentown, but it is not connected to SR 1002 in west-side, center city, and upper east-side Allentown. = Union Boulevard = East of the Tilghman Street Viaduct, SR 1002 traverses numerous streets in the eastern section of Allentown. After the intersection with Fenwick Street, SR 1002 has a solid west-east routing. East of the Irving Street intersection, SR 1002 intersects Airport Road, the main road to Lehigh Valley International Airport. Briefly east of Airport Road, Union Boulevard traverses the other streets of east Allentown. SR 1002 enters the city of Bethlehem from the west as West Union Boulevard. Approximately 1,500 feet east of the Allentown-Bethlehem boundary, Eaton Avenue is concurrent with SR 1002 for one-tenth of a mile. The route turns to the south near the junction with Pennsylvania Avenue before taking an increasingly eastern alignment. Third Avenue provides access to and from PA 378 south. SR 1002 terminates at an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 378. The highway only has access to PA 378 north. The designation continues as W. Union Boulevard upon entering the eastern sections of Bethlehem in Northampton County.

WEFT typically broadcasts 24 hours per day and 7 days per week. It has a wide range of programming, including music from a range of genres, local and nationally produced public affairs programming, live music, spoken word, and more. WEFT's mission is to be \\"an accessible, responsible, and responsive radio alternative, serving the diverse communities of radio listeners in East-Central Illinois\\". History WEFT had its beginnings in 1975 as community members began work to create a new radio station. In 1980 WEFT began to broadcast on the local cable TV network and acquired studio space at 113 N. Market Street in Champaign. This location is still the WEFT operations base. On September 26, 1981 WEFT went on the air as an FM radio station broadcasting at 90.1 MHz. Initially WEFT was a less-than-1,000-watt station with the transmitter and antenna located atop a nearby hotel. In 1991 WEFT/Prairie Air Inc. purchased the building at 113 N. Market Street and within 9 years paid off the mortgage. In 1988 WEFT acquired a 10,000-watt transmitter and new broadcast antenna designed for a new transmission site located on a hill NW of Champaign. WEFT began to broadcast in stereo at this time. This move extended the broadcast coverage area significantly with the signal reaching up to . The 10,000-watt transmitter which had been installed in 1988 was replaced in 2008 after a lightning strike damaged the older tube- type transmitter. The current transmitter is solid state. Broadcast range In addition to broadcasting at 90.1 on the FM band WEFT streams their programming live, 24 hours per day, on the internet. It streams at 128 Kbps.http://weft.org/listen The FM signal reaches approximately to the North, West and South and about 20 miles to the east of their transmitter site. The reduced power to the east is required to avoid interference with a neighboring station located in Indiana. On demand listening of all locally produced WEFT programming is made available on the internet for two weeks after original broadcast via Radio Free America.http://www.radiofreeamerica.com/station/weft Staffing WEFT is operated entirely by volunteers. WEFT calls its on-air hosts Airshifters. The number of unique Airshifters hosting programs in a given week varies between 55 and 65 depending on program rotation. Training for new Airshifters is held typically twice per year. There are two lecture- based training sessions followed by two studio-based sessions. Once training is complete a new Airshifter may fill in as a substitute host and/or propose to the Programming Committee an idea for an available time slot. Over 90% of operations funding is provided by listeners and underwriters. Prairie Air, Inc. owns WEFT and its board of directors oversees operation of the radio station.

The CDC 160 and CDC 160-A were 12-bit minicomputers built from 1960 to 1965; the CDC 160G was a 13-bit minicomputer, with an extended version of the CDC 160-A instruction set, and a compatibility mode in which it did not use the 13th bit. The 160 was designed by Seymour Cray - reportedly over a long three-day weekend. It fit into the desk where its operator sat. The 160 architecture uses ones' complement arithmetic with end-around carry. \\"A Programmer's Reference Manual for the CDC-160\\" by Douglas W. Jones NCR joint- marketed the 160-A under its own name for several years in the 1960s. Overview A publishing company that purchased a CDC 160-A described it as \\"a single user machine with no batch processing capability. Programmers and/or users would go to the computer room, sit at the console, load the paper tape bootstrap and start up a program.\\" The CDC 160-A was a simple piece of hardware, and yet provided a variety of features which were scaled-down capabilities found only on larger systems. It was therefore an ideal platform for introducing neophyte programmers to the sophisticated concepts of low- level Input/output (I/O) and interrupt systems. All 160 systems had a paper- tape reader, and a punch, and most had an IBM Electric typewriter modified to act as a computer terminal. Memory on the 160 was 4096 12-bit words. The CPU had a 12-bit ones' complement accumulator but no multiply or divide. There was a full complement of instructions and several addressing modes. Indirect addressing was almost as good as index registers. The instruction set supported both relative (to the current P register) and absolute. The original instruction set did not have a subroutine call instruction and could only address one bank of memory. In the 160-A model, a \\"return jump\\" and a memory bank-switch instruction was added. Return-jump allowed simple subroutine calls and bank switching allowed other 4K banks of memory to be addressed, albeit clumsily, up to a total of 32,768 words. The extra memory was expensive and had to live in a separate box as large as the 160 itself. The 160-A model could also accept a multiply/divide unit, which was another large and expensive peripheral box. In the 160 and 160-A, the memory cycle time was 6.4 microseconds. An add took two cycles. The average instruction took 15 microseconds, for a processing rate of 67,000 instructions per second. The 160G model extended the registers and memory words to 13 bits; in G mode, all 13 bits were used, while in A mode, only the lower 12 bits were used, for binary compatibility with the 160-A. The 160G added some instructions, including built-in multiply and divide instructions, and some additional addressing modes. Low-level I/O allowed control of devices, interfacing for determining device status, and for reading and writing data as either single bytes, or as blocks. I/O could be completed to a register, or to memory, or via a direct memory access (DMA) channel. The distinction between these I/O types was that regular I/O would 'hang' the CPU until the I/O operation completed, but DMA I/O allowed the CPU to proceed with instruction execution concurrently with the data transfer. The interrupt system was purely based on IO, meaning that all interrupts were generated externally. Interrupts were introduced to neophytes as being the alert mechanism by which a program could be informed that a previously initiated DMA I/O operation was completed.

Large parts of the 160 instruction set were unchanged in the peripheral processors. However, there were changes to incorporate the 6000 data channel programming, and control of the central processor. In the early days of the 6000s, almost the entire operating system ran in the PPs. This left the central processor unencumbered by operating system demands and available for user programs.

Born in Bethesda, Maryland, she moved to Texas and California before returning to Bethesda. At age 13, she began her acting career by working as an amateur reporter for a local Bethesda UPN station. Her exposure led to some modelling jobs and a part in a re-enactment on America's Most Wanted. Career In January 1999, Sisco landed the role of Abigail Williams on CBS's daytime drama As the World Turns. The character Abigail was the daughter of the characters Holden Snyder and Molly Conlan. Sisco received two Emmy Award nominations, in 2001 and 2002. Sisco left the show after three years on October 25, 2002, when the character Abigail left Oakdale to move to Los Angeles with the character Adam. In late 1998, Sisco won the Miss Maryland Teen USA 1999 title and prepared to compete in the Miss Teen USA pageant, until she was offered the role on As the World Turns, which was to begin filming the week of the pageant. She was replaced by first runner-up Khosi Roy, who represented Maryland in the nationally televised event and placed second runner-up. In October 2006, Soap Opera Digest reported that Sisco had been cast in the role of Charity Standish on NBC's daytime drama Passions. The role was previously played by Molly Stanton from July 14, 1999 until Stanton's departure on July 22, 2004. Sisco's first air date was November 14, 2006. Sisco played the role of Harriet Wells in the 2007 thriller film The Flock. Personal life In 2006, she completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Thomas Edison State College and was inducted into the Alpha Sigma Lambda national honor society. Sisco enrolled in the Master of Professional Writing Program at the University of Southern California, graduating in 2008 from the program.

It was released as a single in 1961 and became Stevens' first Hot 100 single, peaking at #35 in September. Its lyrics tell of a fictional \\"wonder drug\\" that, when taken in a daily dose, can cure myriad ailments, much in the same way unscrupulous patent medicine salesmen marketed their wares in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The song is also notable for having the longest title (104 characters) of any single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at the time of its release. In 1981, the Dutch remixers Stars on 45 released the medley officially entitled \\"Medley: Intro Venus/Sugar Sugar/No Reply/I'll Be Back/Drive My Car/Do You Want to Know a Secret/We Can Work It Out/I Should Have Known Better/Nowhere Man/You're Going to Lose That Girl/Stars on 45\\" -- a whopping 194 characters. Usually known simply as \\"Stars on 45\\", the record was legally required to list all of its component songs as part of its official title for copyright reasons, and thus usurped Stevens' title. (Another song often mentioned in the longest-title sweepstakes is the Hoagy Carmichael tune, \\"I'm A Cranky Old Yank In A Clanky Old Tank On The Streets Of Okinawa With My Honolulu Mama Doin' Those Beat-O Beat-O Flats On The Seat Of My Hirohito Blues\\" (155 characters), recorded by Bing Crosby and Carmichael himself in 1945. However, the song was never a hit, and indeed was probably never issued as a single; moreover, it is usually referred to simply as \\"I'm A Cranky Old Yank\\" on a handful of compilations.) Chart run Billboard Hot 100 (6 weeks, entered August 21): Reached #35 Cashbox (8 weeks, entered August 19): 99, 81, 69, 59, 52, 42, 38, 61 References Category:Novelty songs Category:Ray Stevens songs Category:1961 singles Category:Songs written by Ray Stevens Category:Songs about drugs Category:Mercury Records singles Category:1961 songs ","title":"Jeremiah Peabody's Polyunsaturated Quick-Dissolving Fast-Acting Pleasant-Tasting Green and Purple Pills"},{"id":"7650375","text":"Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet of Abbotsford There have been twelve baronetcies created for people with the surname Scott, one in the Baronetage of England, two in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia, and nine in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom.

Cochran was the first African-American aviator selected to the United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron (Blue Angels) in 1986. Cochran later assumed command of the Blue Angels in 1994. Personal biography Donnie L. Cochran was born July 6, 1954, on a farm near Pelham, Georgia. Graduated from Savannah State College in June 1976, earning a degree in civil engineering technology and commission in the United States Navy. In September 1985, he was the first African-American pilot selected to fly with the United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, The Blue Angels. In July 1994, he was selected as the first African-American commanding officer and flight leader of the Blue Angels.\\"Former Blue Angels pilot tells what inspired him to fly\\" Albany Herald. Retrieved 2017-01-10. Military biography =Training and Initial Fleet Tours= Cochran completed flight school, earned his Navy ‚ÄúWings of Gold‚Äù in 1978 after completing basic jet training in the T-2C Buckeye, and advanced jet training in the TA-4J Skyhawk. Cochran was assigned to fly the RF-8G Crusader due to his excellent performance during carrier qualification as a student pilot. He was assigned to VFP-63 based at NAS Miramar in San Diego, California. He made his first deployment flying RF-8G on board the to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Oceans. During this deployment, the Iranians took over the US Embassy and the USS Nimitz was diverted to the Indian Ocean. To make room for the Special Forces Helicopters, VFP-63 Detachment 5 was flown to the for the remainder of the deployment. By the time Captain Cochran completed his first deployment he and VFP-63 Detachment 5 had completed an around-the-world deployment during a nine-month cruise. Following his first operational deployment flying the Crusader, the navy began phasing the RF-8G out of service and the F-14A was assuming the photoreconnaissance mission. Because of this, Cochran transitioned to the F-14A at VF-124 at NAS Miramar. His first assignment after training in the F-14 was with the Blacklions of Fighter Squadron 213 (VF-213), where he made two deployments on board the USS Enterprise (CVN-65) to the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. By the time his assignment with VF-213 was completed, he had flown over 2,000 hours and made 469 carrier landings in fighter aircraft. His next assignment was as an instructor pilot at the F-14 Replacement Air Group Squadron (RAG) VF-124. =First Blue Angels Tour= Shortly after arriving at VF-124 in 1985, Captain Cochran applied for and was selected as a Blue Angels pilot. He was the first African American pilot to fly with the Blue Angels and flew for three seasons (1986-87-88). In 1986, Captain Cochran flew the left wingman position flying the number 3 jet in the A-4F. In January 1986, the navy announced that the Blue Angels would be transitioning from the A-4F Skyhawk to the F/A-18 Hornet. The four diamond pilots were ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù in positioned for a year to enhance safety, to accommodate the team's transition to the new FA-18, and to fly a complete airshow season in the same year. What this meant for the 1986 team, they would get an extra year on the team. For Captain Cochran, it meant another year flying the number 3 jet in 1987 and a normal rotation to the number 4 jet as slot pilot in 1988. During his three years as a demonstration pilot Captain Cochran flew over 1,500 hours and over 240 airshows. =Return to the Fleet= Following three years of flying with the Blue Angels, Captain Cochran was assigned to the Bounty Hunters of VF-2 for department head tour as the squadron's maintenance officer. Captain Cochran made one deployment on board the USS Ranger (CV-61). Following his department head tour, Captain Cochran was screened to command of an operational F-14 Squadron and was selected to attend the Air War College, at Maxwell AFB, Montgomery, AL. During his assignment at Air War College, Captain Cochran earned a diploma in International Security and a Masters in Human Resource Management from Troy State University. Following Air War College, Captain Cochran reported for duty as the executive officer (XO) at Fighter Squadron 1 (VF-1) Wolfpack. The squadron made one deployment on board the USS Ranger (CV-61) to the Persian Gulf and flew missions over Southern Iraq enforcing the southern no fly zone. Captain Cochran flew over 24 missions and earned an air medal. After 16 months as XO, Cochran assumed command of VF-1 as commanding officer (CO). The Navy began to reduce the number of F-14 Squadrons out of the fleet and VF-1 was disestablished. (Cochran was the last commanding officer of Fighter Squadron 1 the Wolfpack). For this reason, Cochran was reassigned to Fighter Squadron 111 (VF-111) Sun Downers for 29 days as XO before assuming command of the squadron as CO. It was during this tour that Captain Cochran applied for, completed an interview process, and was selected as commanding officer and flight leader of the United States Navy's Flight Demonstration Squadron (Blue Angels). After completing his commanding officer tour, VF-111 won the Battle Efficiency (E) and Safety (S) as the best F-14 Squadron in the Pacific Fleet. =Return to the Blue Angels= In November 1994, Cochran assumed command as the first African American commanding officer and flight leader of the Blue Angels at a ceremony at National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola, Florida. Cochran led the team for 16 months until May 1996. in May 1996, Cochran made the decision to ‚Äústep down as flight leader‚Äù to minimize the safety risks to the team and spectators. Cochran believes his lessons learned on leadership, team dynamics and individual performance are vital to anyone in a leadership role or a member of a high-performance team: # Your work environment matters and when the values of respect, integrity, honesty, and loyalty break down, so does your performance! # When team members lose sight of their purpose and values, they often engage in hidden agendas, deception, and narrow-minded pettiness. # When in a leadership role or command, you cannot accept or accommodate any behavior, comments, or actions that undermine your authority as the leader. You must take actions and hold offenders accountable. # You cannot lead anyone who will dishonor you! This quote captures the essence why leaders must hold those reporting to them accountable for their performance, attitude, behaviors and actions. =Post Blue Angels Command= After leaving the Blue Angels, Cochran served as the commanding officer of the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps Unit (NROTC), at Florida A & M University with cross-town enrollment with Florida State University from August 1996 until July 1999. Captain Cochran was directly responsible for developing and grooming over 100 future naval officers for the navy and Marine Corps. During his final assignment, he served as the deputy commander of Navy Recruiting Command, second in command of over 7,000 people at over 1,500 locations around the nation and abroad. Captain Cochran retired from the U.S. Navy with over 24 years of leadership and aviation expertise.

A second plaque was later added which bears the inscription: IN HONOR OF COMMANDER DONNIE COCHRAN, U.S. NAVY THE FIRST BLACK NAVAL AVIATOR TO COMMAND THE BLUE ANGELS FLIGHT DEMONSTRATION TEAM. In August 2015 Donnie Cochran was honored by Georgia's Governor Nathan Deal in the renaming of the old Pelham's Detention Center to the Donnie Cochran Community Complex and in December 2016 he was recently inducted into the Georgia Military Veteran Hall of Fame. Education Cochran earned a civil engineering degree from Savannah State College, now known as Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia, in 1976, where he was a member of the NROTC program. He is also a graduate of the Air War College in Montgomery, Alabama, and earned a master's degree in human resource management from Troy State University.

Situated approximately 30 miles from Kisumu city, Nyamninia is home to the 100 kilowatts medium wave radio transmitters set up by Voice of Kenya (VoK); now renamed Kenya Broadcastic Corporation (KBC). It was the birthplace of the legendary Gem clan chief, Odera Kang'o who started a rice plantation scheme in the area about one hundred years ago. The Gem chief was responsible for construction the numerous schools in the region before his enforced exile in 1915, to Kampala, Uganda by the British colonialists. At present, it is a business centre. Both Nyamninia Primary School and Nyamninia Secondary School are located within the centre. Nyamninia is occupied mainly by the Luo and the Kisa tribe (Luhya), an indigenous Luhya sub-tribe. The main bus stage is Muhanda shopping center. Nyamninia is divided in different suburbs that include Nyamninia,Bar Sauri, Bar Turo, Muhoho and Muhanda. Most of the people are Christians with a minority of Muslim community. Tourists attractions include Gunda Odera Kang‚Äôo ( the place Odera Kang‚Äôo presumably had his administrative base and home), Aora Msango, (a spring that keeps sprinkling even in dry seasons) Maseno equator crossing point (20 km away) and Ndano falls at River Yala. The majority of the inhabitants are mainly peasant farmers with Maize, Banans, Sweet potatoes, cassava and sugar cane as main cash crops.

In the US, traditional teacher certification is earned through completing a bachelor's or master's degree in education, taking standardized tests (usually a Praxis test), and fulfilling additional state requirements. Alternatively certified teachers typically possess a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university and are completing (or have completed) an alternative certification program while teaching full-time. Other state certification requirements, such as the type of education coursework or the length of practice teaching, may be modified or waived. In the United States, alternative certification is offered in forty-eight states and the District of Columbia. Alternative certification programs first appeared in the 1980s. A decline in the number of students seeking a degree in education was creating a shortage of teachers in American elementary and high schools. States began to search for a way to recruit and train people who had already earned a four-year degree and wanted to become teachers. While the requirements for an alternative certification vary from state to state, there are certain commonalities found in the programs. A prospective teacher is usually required to complete an accelerated university program, pass the state licensing test, and submit to a series of interviews. He or she must be able to demonstrate a mastery of educational methods, and participate in a mentor program with a teacher who has completed a traditional education degree.

This album marks the beginning of Metal Church's third major line-up, with the addition of Ronny Munroe (vocals), Jay Reynolds (guitar), and Steve Unger (bass). This album is also the last to feature Kirk Arrington on drums. It is hailed by critics and fans alike as Metal Church's comeback album. The prevalent themes of this album include crime, war, rejection, and madness. Reception Reviews for The Weight of the World were mixed. Reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic lamented \\"the band's maddening tendencies for songwriting inconsistency, matching every memorable turn like 'Hero's Soul' or 'Sunless Sky' with an equally forgettable outing like 'Wings of Tomorrow' or 'Bomb to Drop.'\\" He criticized new singer Ronny Munroe, who \\"doesn't always have the power or presence to match the surrounding onslaught\\", but stated his belief that longtime fans of the band would like most of the album's songs. Tony Daley of Blabbermouth.net was also critical of Munroe's performance and was not convinced by \\"the sound of the pre-thrash New Wave Of British Heavy Metal\\" the album offers and by \\"the pool of average ideas\\" that makes up the eight minute pi√®ce de r√©sistance \\"Madman's Soul\\". However he conceded that if \\"you don't mind the odd dip in quality, then Weight of the World is a likable, if flawed, piece of work.\\" Exclaim! review by Greg Pratt was more positive, stating that The Weight of the World \\"gives that metal punch we all knew the band was capable of delivering\\", because \\"the ten tunes are jam-packed with classic '80s heavy metal riffs, from glorious thrash to some NWOBHM melodic near-punksters\\". Rock Hard reviewer remarked the 1980s feel of the music and praised the \\"smoky-aggressive voice\\" of Munroe and Metal Church for providing \\"grand songwriting, horny hooks and a feeling for the synthesis of hammer-hard rhythms and memorable melodies.\\" Despite \\"the somewhat muddy production and one or two average songs\\" he elected Weight of the World the comeback album of the year.

He is attached to the household of the Countess Olivia. He has apparently been there for some time, as he was a \\"fool that the Lady Olivia's father took much delight in\\" (2.4). Although Olivia's father has died within the last year, it is possible that Feste approaches or has reached middle age, though he still has the wit to carry off good 'fooling' when he needs to, and the voice to sing lustily or plangently as the occasion demands. He is referred to by name only once during the play, in answer to an inquiry by Orsino of who sang a song that he heard the previous evening. Curio responds \\"Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house\\" (2.4). Throughout the rest of the play, he is addressed only as \\"Fool,\\" while in the stage directions he is mentioned as \\"Clown.\\" Feste seems to leave Olivia's house and return at his pleasure rather too freely for a servant. (At the very least he is doing some free-lance entertaining over at the house of Duke Orsino (2.4).) His habit of roaming gets him into trouble with Lady Olivia: when we first see him, he must talk his way out of being turned out‚Äîa grim fate in those days‚Äîfor being absent, as it were, without leave. He succeeds, and once back in his lady's good graces, he weaves in and out of the action with the sort of impunity that was reserved for a person nobody took seriously. Performances There are instances in the play where Feste is believed to be an almost omniscient presence. Some critics have suggested that there are moments where it seems Feste knows more about Viola/Cesario's disguise than he lets on and certain stage and film adaptations have taken this approach with their portrayal of the fool. A good example is in Trevor Nunn's film adaptation, in which Ben Kingsley is constantly present in the scenes that reveal the plot--in fact he is the narrator at the start of the film, describing the shipwreck and the separation of the twins. He is then shown watching Viola arrive in Illyria and the film ends with him watching the various supporting players leave Olivia's estate. When Viola removes her \\"Cesario\\" disguise he gives her a golden necklace which she discarded when first shipwrecked on Illyria's shores. Kingsley's Feste dresses in old clothes and appears to be a wanderer of no fixed abode, though he slips in and out of Olivia's estate at his will. He plays a number of musical instruments and, like most of the cast, displays a mixture of comedy and pathos. Songs/poems Feste, as a fool, has a repertoire of songs: =O Mistress Mine= O Mistress mine, where are you roaming? O, stay and hear! Your true love's coming, That can sing both high and low. Trip no further, pretty sweeting; Journeys end in lovers meeting, Every wise man\`s son doth know, What is love? 'Tis not hereafter. Present mirth hath present laughter; What's to come is still unsure. In delay there lies no plenty, Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty. Youth's a stuff will not endure. =Come Away, Death= :Come away, come away, death, :And in sad cypress let me be laid. :Fly away, fly away breath, :I am slain by a fair cruel maid. : :My shroud of white, stuck all with yew, :O, prepare it! :My part of death, no one so true :Did share it. : :Not a flower, not a flower sweet :On my black coffin let there be strown. :Not a friend, not a friend greet :My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown. : :A thousand thousand sighs to save, :Lay me, O, where :Sad true lover never find my grave, :To weep there! =Hey Robin, Jolly Robin= Hey Robin, jolly Robin, Tell me how thy lady does. My lady is unkind, perdy. Alas, why is she so? She loves another -- This song is interrupted partway through. =I Am Gone, Sir= I am gone, sir. And anon, sir, I'll be with you again, In a trice, Like to the old Vice, Your need to sustain. Who with dagger of lath, In his rage and his wrath, Cries \\"Ah ha\\" to the devil. Like a mad lad, \\"Pare thy nails, dad.\\" Adieu, good man devils. =Feste's Song= When that I was and a little tiny boy, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, A foolish thing was but a toy, For the rain it raineth every day. But when I came to man's estate, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate, For the rain, it raineth every day. But when I came, alas, to wive, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, By swaggering could I never thrive, For the rain, it raineth every day. But when I came unto my beds, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, With tosspots still had drunken heads, For the rain, it raineth every day. A great while ago the world begun, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain. But that's all one, our play is done, And we'll strive to please you every day.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is primarily responsible for charging these penalties at the Federal level. The IRS can assert only those penalties specified imposed under Federal tax law. State and local rules vary widely, are administered by state and local authorities, and are not discussed herein. Penalties may be monetary or may involve forfeiture of property. Criminal penalties may include jail time, but are imposed only by a federal judge after a defendant is convicted. Most monetary penalties are based on the amount of tax not properly paid. Penalties may increase with the period of nonpayment. Some penalties are fixed dollar amounts or fixed percentages of some measure required to be reported.Most of the penalty rules are in Chapters 68 through 75 of the Internal Revenue Code, sections 6651 through 7344. 26 USC Subtitle F. Excise taxes used as penalties are imposed in the Code sections relating to particular kinds of transactions. Some penalties may be waived or abated where the taxpayer shows reasonable cause for the failure. Penalties apply for failures to file income tax returns or information returns, or for filing incorrect returns. Some penalties may be very minor. Penalties apply for certain types of errors on tax returns, and may be substantial. Some penalties are imposed as excise taxes on particular transactions. Certain other penalties apply for other types of failures. Certain acts may result in forfeiture of property of the taxpayer. There are over 150 kindsAlan J. Tarr, J.D., LL.M. (Taxation) & Pamela Jensen Drucker, J.D., LL.M. (Taxation), Civil Tax Penalties, U.S. Income Portfolios, Vol. 634 (2d ed. 2012), Bloomberg BNA. of civil penalties in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, ranging in severity which is reflected in the amount of the applicable fines. Underestimate and late payment penalties Taxpayers are required to have withholding of tax or make quarterly estimated tax payments before the end of the tax year. Because accurate estimation requires accurate prediction of the future, taxpayers sometimes underestimate the amount due. The penalty for paying too little estimated tax or having too little tax withheld is computed with interest on the amount that should have been, but was not, paid.26 USC 6654. Where a taxpayer has filed an income or excise tax return that shows a balance due but does not pay that balance by the due date of the return (without extensions), a different charge applies. This charge has two components: an interest charge, computed as described above, and second a penalty of 0.5% per month applied to the unpaid balance of tax and interest.26 USC 6651(a)(3). The 0.5% penalty is capped at 25% of the total unpaid tax. The underestimate penalty and interest on late payment are automatically assessed.See IRS Tax Topic 653. Penalties for failure to timely file returns or timely pay tax Penalty for Failure to Timely File Return: If a taxpayer is required to file an income or excise tax return and fails to timely do so, a late filing penalty may be assessed. The penalty is 5% of the amount of unpaid tax per month (or partial month) the return is late, up to a maximum of 25%.26 USC 6651(a)(1). A minimum penalty of $435 may apply for returns over 60 days late. The minimum penalty is the lesser of $435 or 100% of the tax due on the return. Penalty for Failure to Timely Pay Tax: If a taxpayer fails to pay the balance due shown on the tax return by the due date (even if the reason of nonpayment is a bounced check), there is a penalty of 0.5% of the amount of unpaid tax per month (or partial month), up to a maximum of 25%. Penalty for Failure to Timely Pay After Issuance of Notice: If a taxpayer fails to pay any additional tax assessed by the IRS (usually as a result of an audit) the taxpayer may be liable for a penalty equal to 0.5% for each month (or partial month) during which the failure continues, if the amount is not paid within 21 calendar days after the date of an IRS notice demanding the payment. If both the failure to file and the failure to pay penalties apply during the same month, then the failure to file penalty is reduced by 0.5% each month. The 25% cap above applies to the 5% late filing penalty and the 0.5% late payment penalty together. The late filing penalty may be waived or abated on showing of reasonable cause for failure. The failure to file penalty is imposed and starts to accrue interest from the due date of the return.IRC¬ß6651(a)(1) The failure to pay penalty is imposed when a taxpayer pays the taxes after payment was due, computed from the date prescribed for paying the tax.IRC¬ß6651(a)(2) The Internal Revenue Service advises that if the taxpayer wants to compute the penalty for failure to timely file and the penalty for failure to timely pay the tax shown on the return, or the interest, and to pay those items at the time the return is filed, the taxpayer can \\"identify and enter the amount in the bottom margin\\" on the second page of Form 1040. The IRS advises that the taxpayer \\"not include interest or penalties (other than the estimated tax penalty)\\" in the \\"Amount Owed\\" line of the form. Accuracy related penalties If amounts reported on an income tax return are later adjusted by the IRS and a tax increase results, an additional penalty may apply. This penalty of 20% or 40% of the increase in tax is due in the case of substantial understatement of tax, substantial valuation misstatements, transfer pricing adjustments, or negligence or disregard of rules or regulations. For example, a valuation overstatement can result in a 30% penalty on the amount of tax owed. Special rules apply for each of these types of errors under which the penalty may be waived.26 USC 6662. Penalties in connection with information returns Certain types of returns, called \\"information returns,\\" do not require payment of tax. These include forms filed by employers to report wages (Form W-2) and businesses to report certain payments (Form 1099 series instructions). The penalty for failures related to these forms is a dollar amount per form not timely filed, and the amount of penalty increases with the degree of lateness. The current maximum penalty for these forms is $50.26 USC 6721. Many of the forms must be filed electronically, and filing on paper is considered non-filing.26 CFR 301-6721-1(a)(2)(ii). Late filing of returns of partnership income (Form 1065) can result in penalties of $195 per month per partner, up to a maximum of 12 months.26 USC 6698. Similar penalties may apply to an income tax return (Form 1120S) for an S corporation.26 USC 6699.Technically, the Form 1120S is an income tax return, not an information return. 100% penalty on unpaid withholding taxes Employers are required to withhold income and social security taxes from wages paid to employees, and to pay these amounts promptly to the government.26 USC 3101-3406. A penalty of 100% of the amount not paid over (plus liability for paying the withheld amounts) may be collected without judicial proceedings from each and every person who had custody and control of the funds and did not make the payment to the government.26 USC 6672. This applies to company employees and officers as individuals, as well as to companies themselves.26 USC 3504. There have been reported cases of the IRS seizing houses of those failing to pay over employee taxes.See, e.g., United States v. St. Clair, 45 Amer. Fed. Tax Rep. 2d 80-1528, 80-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9364, (N.D. Texas 1980), in which the court upheld seizure of the taxpayer's personal residence for failure to pay over withholding taxes payable by the company. Penalties for failure to provide foreign information Taxpayers who are shareholders of controlled foreign corporations must file Form 5471 with respect to each such controlled foreign corporation.26 USC 6038. Penalties for failure to timely file are $10,000 to $50,000 per form, plus possible loss of foreign tax credits. U.S. corporations more than 25% owned, directly or indirectly, by foreign persons must file Form 5472 to report such ownership and all transactions with related parties.26 USC 6038A. Failure to timely file carries a $10,000 penalty per required form. This penalty may be increased by $10,000 per month per form for continued failure to file. In addition, taxpayers who fail to report changes in foreign taxes used as credits against Federal income tax may be subject to penalties.26 USC 6689. U.S. citizen or resident taxpayers (including entities) who are beneficiaries of a foreign trust or make transfers of property to a foreign trust must report information about the transfer and the trust or corporation. Failure to timely report on Form 3520 or Form 3520-A may result in penalties of up to 35%.26 USC 6677. Similar transferors to foreign corporations failing to file Form 926 may face penalties of 10% of the value of the transfer, up to $100,000.26 USC 6038B. Excise taxes as penalties Federal excise taxes are imposed on a variety of goods and services.Subtitle D of 26 USC. Some of these taxes require purchase of tax stamps or other evidence of advance payment of tax. Some require collection of the tax by retailers. An assortment of penalties apply to manufacturers and retailers not complying with the particular rules.Manufacturers Taxes, IRS In addition, certain penalties are imposed in the form of an excise tax. Pension and benefit plans must pay a tax for a variety of failures.26 USC 4971-4980G Charities and private foundations must pay an excise tax on prohibited transactions and other failures.26 USC 4911, 4912 and 26 USC 4940-4948. Tax fraud penalties Intentional filing of materially false tax returns is a criminal offence. A person convicted of committing tax fraud, or aiding and abetting another in committing tax fraud, may be subject to forfeiture of property 26 USC 7301-7328. and/or jail time.26 USC 7201-7217. Conviction and sentencing is through the court system. Responsibility for prosecution falls to the U.S. Department of Justice, not the Internal Revenue Service. Penalties may be assessed against tax protesters who raise arguments that income tax laws are not valid, or who otherwise file frivolous returns or court petitions.26 USC 6702 26 USC 6673. Tax adviser penalties Penalties also apply to people who promote tax shelters26 USC 6700. or who fail to maintain and disclose lists of reportable transactions their customers or clients for those transactions.26 USC 6707A. These monetary penalties can be severe. Judicial appeal of penalties Most penalties are subject to judicial review.See the discussions in IRS Publication 5 . However, the courts rarely modify assessment of the penalties and interest for underestimate or late payment.

Early life Wehner was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts on 20 September 1895. Wehner's athletic achievements as captain of the Everett High School football team earned him a scholarship to the Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire in 1914. He was working for the YMCA in Berlin, Germany when war was declared. He enlisted in the Signal Corps during June 1917. Aerial service While receiving flight training, Wehner's German ancestry led to an investigation followed by an unsubstantiated arrest for suspicion of treason by the Secret Service. He was cleared and departed for England in February 1918. He was assigned to the 27th Aero Squadron under Major Harold Hartney in July 1918. Flying as wing man to the mercurial balloon-buster Frank Luke, Wehner shot down one Fokker D.VII and five balloons in just three days of aerial combat during September 1918. Protecting Luke as he attacked a third balloon, Wehner's SPAD XIII was shot down by Luftstreitkr√§fte ace Georg von Hantelmann of Jasta 15 on 18 September 1918. Wehner, who fell behind enemy lines, was taken to a German hospital where he died a short time later from his injuries. His body was recovered and buried in an American cemetery in Europe after the war, but it was reinterred in his hometown of Everett, Massachusetts in 1921.

Early life Muller was born in The Netherlands, the eldest of five children. His family emigrated to the United States when he was five. Career Muller was a classically trained actor who began his career working on stage and doing commercials. He spent many years on the New York stage, where he became a company member of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, for which he played the title role in King Henry V, Edmund the Bastard in The History of King Lear, and the title role in Cyrano de Bergerac, as well as performing with the Roundabout Theater Company and the New York Shakespeare Festival among others. He also played supporting roles on television in shows like Law & Order, Life Goes On, Harry and the Hendersons, and All My Children. It is as an audiobook narrator, however, that he was most famous. In 1979, Henry Trentman founded Recorded Books and hired Muller as its first narrator to record its first book, The Sea Wolf by Jack London.Recorded Books - about_rbi The company began by publishing audiobook recordings of public domain works such as Call of the Wild and A Tale of Two Cities but later expanded into copyrighted works as audiobooks began to grow in popularity. Muller soon became the narrator of choice for such authors as Stephen King, John le Carr√©, John Grisham, Elmore Leonard and many others. Muller won the 2002 and 2003 Audie Award for Best Male Narrator for his readings of Clive Barker's Coldheart Canyon and Elmore Leonard's Tishomingo Blues, respectively. Motorcycle accident On November 5, 2001, Muller was about to leave on a week-long motorcycle trip with a close relative when his wife Erika surprised him with the news that she was expecting their second child. After celebrating, Muller left on the trip. Two hours into the trip, he lost control of his motorcycle on the freeway when he accidentally clipped a construction barrel and was sent skidding into a median barrier at about 65 miles per hour. Muller was thrown from the bike landing on his head on the concrete. He sustained multiple fractures, lacerations, and abrasions, and was taken to Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center in Lancaster, California, and went into cardiac arrest three times. He also suffered severe head trauma, which was subsequently diagnosed as diffuse axonal injury. Muller remained hospitalized for six and a half years and died on June 4, 2008, at Duke University Hospital in Durham, North Carolina. In 2002, Stephen King, who had also experienced a life-threatening auto accident, organized a benefit for Muller with Pat Conroy, John Grisham, and Peter Straub. King went on to help found The Wavedancer Foundation, an organization dedicated to helping \\"mid- list writers, audio readers, and freelancers in the book and publishing industry.\\" Personal life Muller was married to Erika Muller and had two children, Diana and Morgan. In 2003, the Mullers moved to a house outside Raleigh, North Carolina, United States, that was modified specifically for Frank's therapeutic and rehabilitative needs.

He was a soldier of fortune, who served in Germany under the banners of Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden. It is not certain how he got his epithet of the 'Black Baron', but quite possibly it was from the colour of his hair rather than any perceived martial ferocity. Although this Robert Munro is traditionally 18th Baron and 21st overall chief of the Clan Munro, he is only the 11th Munro chief that can be proved by contemporary evidence.. Other Munros Robert Munro, 18th Baron of Foulis is often confused with his more famous cousin, Robert Monro of the Munro of Obsdale branch of the same clan who died sometime around 1675/1680, and also served in the Swedish army in this period, writing a famous history on his exploits. This is perhaps forgivable, since during the Thirty Years' War of 1618‚Äì1648, there were as many as 27 field officers and 11 captains with the name of 'Munro' in the Swedish army. Youth in Scotland While still very young, in 1603, Robert became the 18th Baron of Foulis, after the death of his father Hector Munro, 17th Baron of Foulis. Being a minor, he was by dispensation and special warrant from James VI of Scotland, dated 8 January 1608, served heir male and provision to his father, all of the lands of Easter Fowlis. He married Margaret Sutherland, daughter of William Sutherland of Duffus on 24 November 1610. At a meeting of the Privy Council held on 27 March 1612, a commission was granted to Robert Munro of Foulis, along with others, including Alexander Gordon, brother of John, Earl of Sutherland, John Munro of Lemlair, George Munro of Tarlogie and Andrew Munro of Novar for the apprehension of two men charged with stealing from George Munro of Tarrell and bringing the alleged thieves before the Council to be delivered to the Justice for trial. Clan Fraser of Lovat tartan in the Clan Munro exhibition at the Storehouse of Foulis, Scotland Robert had another commission along with the Earl of Sutherland and others on 15 March 1614, to apprehend three men at the instance of William Sutherland of Duffus for having murdered a certain Donald Angus Gairson, who failed to appear before the Justice on the day appointed to answer the charge against them. The murderers were captured and put on trial. During Robert's chieftaincy of his clan a feud arose between the Earl of Sutherland (chief of Clan Sutherland) and the Earl of Caithness (chief of Clan Sinclair), caused by the latter hunting on the former's lands. Robert, being connected to the Sutherlands by marriage, sent a number of men from his clan to support the Earl of Sutherland. The Clan Mackay and the MacLeods of Assynt also assisted the Sutherlands. The Earl of Caithness gathered his forces and proceeded into Sutherland, however having heard of the large army that faced him he sent messengers to Sutherland with proposals of a peaceful settlement. His proposals of peace were refused and he was assured of battle the next morning. The Earl of Sutherland's army lined up, consisting of the Mackays on the left wing, the Sutherlands in the centre and the Munros and MacLeods on the right wing. As they advanced, Caithness's men fled, and the Munros went home not having engaged in battle, it is said to their disappointment. Robert is said to have had costly habits, and by 1618 he was so broke that he had to dispone his estate to his relative, Lord Simon Fraser of Lovat (chief of Clan Fraser of Lovat), who remained in possession of the Barony of Foulis for some years. Soldier of Fortune In June 1626 Robert joined the Scottish regiment of Donald Mackay, 1st Lord Reay (1591‚Äì1649), which was then being recruited for Danish service, largely in the Scottish Highlands. The actions of this unit are well documented in the famous History of Mackay's Regiment written by his cousin Robert Monro of Obsdale, and published in 1637. In Swedish service =Siege of Stralsund= Munro of Foulis progressed quickly through the ranks, advancing to Captain, then Major and finally Lieutenant Colonel in Mackay's Scottish Regiment. In 1628 the Danes sent several Scottish regiments including those of Lord Spynie and Donald Mackay's (which included Munro's company) to fight in the Battle of Stralsund. Under Danish leadership the regiment was treated disgracefully, being forced often to sleep in the streets. When Alexander Leslie arrived from Pomerania with more Scottish, Swedish and German volunteers in July, he was also awarded governorship of the city. He was keen to show his admiration for his countrymen and amalgamated those he had brought from Sweden into a single fighting force with the Scots already in the city. He used the mixed Highland and Lowland contingent in a spectacular assault on the enemy which finally broke the siege. As Robert Monro recorded: Sir Alexander Leslie being made governour, he resolved for the credit of his countrymen to make an out-fall upon the Enemy, and desirous to confer the credit on his own Nation alone, being his first Essay in that Citie. A Munro officer proudly recorded that at the defense of Stralsund in 1628 one of his men by the name of Mac-Weattiche, \\"did prove as valiant as a sword, fearing nothing but discredit\\". However, Danish intervention in the Thirty Years War was unsuccessful, the Danish king Christian IV made peace, and in 1629 Mackay's regiment including the Munro company was paid off, only to be re-hired as a going concern by the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus. =Bloc Castle= In July 1631, Robert Munro of Foulis, with his own regiment alone, stormed and took possession of the fortified castle of Bloc in Mecklenburg, while en route to join the Swedish army at Werben. =Battle of Breitenfeld= In 1631 the Scottish brigades in the Swedish main (Crown) army marched to Leipzig, while other Scots and English units served with James 3rd Marquis Hamilton in an auxiliary British Army guarding the rear of the army. The famous Battle of Breitenfield (also known as the Battle of Leipzig) took place, near Leipzig, in September of that year. Tilly was defeated by Gustavus Adolphus and the Munros, who by their last charge contributed most to the victory of the Swedish Army. Sir James Ramsay was in command of the Scottish vanguard, and then it was on 7 September \\"after we had in the early morning, as the larke begunne to peep commended ourselbes and the event of the day to God,\\" that the great battle commenced. Whilst the Imperial cavalry scattered the Saxons on the left wing, the Scottish stood firm, firing for the first time in platoons. Hepburn formed a square and, when the Austrians had approached near enough, caused his victorious pikemen to advance. In the meantime Lord Reay‚Äôs MacKay and Munro Highlanders were equally successful. =Battle of Lutzen= Towards the end of 1631 Robert Munro briefly returned home to his native land but did not stay long as he soon returned to the war in Europe. He subsequently took part in the Battle of L√ºtzen (1632), where the Munros were again victorious. At the battle the vanguard was led by Robert Munro of Foulis. Robert Munro's successful military career soon came to an end when during one of the many skirmishes of the Thirty Years' War he was wounded in the right foot by a musket ball while crossing the Upper Danube river with Swedish troops. He was carried to Ulm, Germany, where his wound was dressed. However, he soon fell into a low fever and died in March 1633, aged about forty four years of age. In Ulm, Sir Patrick Ruthven was Governor and Robert Munro had lived in the house of a barber and surgeon called Michael Rietmuller. By permission of the magistrates Robert was buried in the Franciscan church or \\"Barf√ºsserkirche,\\" where also his standard, armour and spurs were hung up. Magister Balthasar Kerner delivered his funeral sermon on 29 April 1633. Family and descendants Robert Munro, 18th baron of Foulis married firstly, Margaret, daughter of William Sutherland of Duffus who was descended from Nicolas, second son of Kenneth, 4th Earl of Sutherland. With Margaret he had one child, a daughter also named Margaret who married Kenneth Mackenzie, I of Scatwell. Munro married secondly, before 1624 in London, Mary Haynes, an English lady with whom he also had one child, a daughter named Elizabeth born in 1632. Robert Munro was succeeded by his brother, Sir Hector Munro, 1st Baronet of Foulis who was made a 'Baronet' by King Charles I. Hector continued to command his brother's old infantry regiment in Germany, but the unit was disbanded very soon after.

Adler (born 1954) is an American neurosurgeon. He was born in Yonkers, New York, in 1954. He graduated at Harvard College in 1976 and at Harvard Medical School in 1980. From 1980 to 1987 he did a neurosurgical residency at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital and a radiosurgery fellowship at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, where he worked with Lars Leksell. He joined the faculty of Stanford University School of Medicine in 1987 as an assistant professor in the department of neurosurgery in 1987, was also, made an assistant professor in radiation oncology in 1992, was made an associate professor in both departments in 1993, and was made a full professor in both departments in 1998. Note, see CV linked at that page. In 2007 he was named the Dorothy and Thye King Chan Professor in neurosurgery. He was eventually appointed an emeritus professor of neurosurgery. In 1985 he did a one-year fellowship in Sweden with Lars Leksell, who had invented a device to deliver targeted radiation at brain tumors, called the Gamma Knife. He was astonished and inspired but saw an opportunity to improve it. The Gamma Knife relied on a physical cage to coordinate the location of the subject's head and the device delivering the radiation; Adler wanted to use medical images to guide the beam, instead of the cage. When he returned to Stanford he worked with faculty in the engineering school to build a prototype and by 1987 was pitching his company to venture capitalists. They rejected his idea because the machines were enormous and expensive (the estimated price at that time was $3.5M), so he raised $800,000 from other neurosurgeons, friends, and family, and started a company, Accuray, in 1990. Adler served as chief medical officer, remaining on the Stanford faculty. The company ran out of money in 1994 and had other struggles; Adler took a leave of absence from Stanford in 1999 and took over as CEO, serving in that role until 2002, when he stepped back into being CMO. As of 2005, the company was selling about two machines each month. In 2009, Adler founded Curƒìus.com (originally known as peerEmed.com), a web-based peer-reviewed medical journal that combines attributes of traditional expert review and social networks with the objective of fairly compensating reviewers and authors. In April 2010, Adler was appointed vice president and chief of New Clinical Applications at Varian Medical Systems. Since 2015 he has served as the founder and CEO of Zap Surgical Systems. In 2018 Adler was awarded the Cushing Award for Technical Excellence and Innovation in Neurosurgery, presented at the AANS Annual Scientific Meeting.http://med.stanford.edu/neurosurgery/StanfordNeurosurgeryEvents/aans2018.htmlhttps://www.aans.org/Annual- Scientific-Meeting/2018 He is the father of Trip Adler, co-founder and CEO of Scribd. ;Works References Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:American health care chief executives Category:American inventors Category:American neurosurgeons Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Harvard Medical School alumni Category:People from Yonkers, New York Category:Scientists from New York (state) Category:Stanford University School of Medicine faculty ","title":"John R.

Yate lies on the major regional Liqui√±e-Ofqui Fault Zone, and is located 10 km north-east of the smaller Hornopiren volcano. There are no historical records of recent volcanic activity, but there is strategic evidence of smaller eruptions sometime in the Holocene.  1965 Landslide and Tsunami  On February 19, 1965 a non-eruptive landslide of ice and rock caused by unusually heavy summer rains slid rapidly into a narrow gully, descended around 1500 meters in elevation, and crashed into Lake Cabrera below. This triggered a tsunami that thundered across the lake and swept through the lakeside community of Lago Cabrera just moments later. There was virtually no warning and the community was caught by surprise. The entire village was destroyed, killing twenty-seven people. It is considered the worst volcano-related loss of life in Chile since the Villarrica eruptions of 1948‚Äì1949. The debris field left behind by the tsunami is still visible today, and the people of nearby Hornopir√©n commemorate the tragedy every year with a pilgrimage to the site and the memorial chapel.  Future Dangers  With a warming climate, increased rain and increasing glacial meltwater may accelerate edifice collapse. This has potential implications for more landslide hazards in the area of the volcano, and tsunami risks in the lake area.

Biography  Sabahatttin Ey√ºboƒülu was born in 1908 on the Black Sea coast town of Ak√ßaabat near Trabzon. His father Mehmet Rahmi was governor of Trabzon and was chosen by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk as a member of parliament. Sabahattin graduated from the Trabzon Lyceum and was sent to France, in order to study French in Dijon, Lyon and Paris. Upon his return to Turkey, he was appointed as associate professor at the Istanbul University and assistant to Professor Spitzer and Auerbach. In 1939 the Minister of Education, Hasan Ali Y√ºcel appointed him to the Ministry of Education, where he worked till 1947. He was also appointed as associate director of the Translation Office, a newly established department, responsible for the translation of the masterpieces of world literature. During the same period of time, he was a very strong supporter of the Village Institutes and himself taught at Hasanoƒülan Village Institute near Ankara. With the fall of minister Hasan Ali Y√ºcel, he lost his position and left for Paris as an inspector of Turkish students in France. Back in Istanbul, he returned to his position at the university until 1960. His name was among the 147 professors fired in 1960 by the university, he was found not guilty and was asked to return to his position, which he refused. He taught history of art at the Istanbul Technical University and did translation work. He died of a heart attack on January 13, 1973, and was laid to rest at the Merkezefendi Cemetery in Istanbul. Career Sabahattin Ey√ºboƒülu is a well-known writer, art critic, an excellent translator and also one of the first documentary film producers in his country. Among the films one can find: The Hitite Sun, winner of the \\"Silver Bear\\" award at the 1956 Berlin Film Festival. Black Pen, Book of Festivities, Colors in Darkness, Roman mosaics in Anatolia, The Roads of Anatolia, The Gods of Nemrud, The Waters of ancient Antalya, The Mother Goddess, The World of Karag√∂z, To Live, Colored Walls, Cappadocia, Forty Fountains, T√ºl√º.

In one remarkable struggle, Col. James Bowie, armed only with his Bowie knife, killed three opponents carrying both guns and knives. A knife fight is defined by the presence of a knife as a weapon and the violent intent of the combatants to kill or incapacitate each other; the participants may be completely untrained, self-taught, or trained in one or more formal or informal systems of knife fighting.MacYoung, Marc, Lies About Knife Fighting, retrieved 1 August 2011 Knife fights may involve the use of any type of knife, though certain knives, termed fighting knives, are purposely designed for such confrontations ‚Äì the dagger being just one example. History =Traditional schools= During the long history of the knife as a weapon, many systems or schools of knife fighting have developed around the world. Each is usually distinguished by region and culture of their origin. In past centuries the repeated invasion and conquest of foreign territories by invading armies frequently resulted in the dissemination and adoption of knives and knife fighting techniques. These were in turn adapted and improved upon through long practice and drills, sometimes over hundreds of years. Scherma di stiletto siciliano The Italian stiletto, originally a purely offensive weapon used to kill an unsuspecting or wounded adversary, was later embraced throughout Italy as a fighting knife for close combat confrontations.Letters from Italy: On the Nobility of the Genoese, The Universal Magazine of Knowledge and Pleasure, London: John Hinton, Vol. 58 (July 1776), pp. 43‚Äì45Quattrocchi, Vito, The Sicilian Blade: The Art of Sicilian Stiletto Fighting, J. Flores Publications (1993) The popularity of the stiletto in the Kingdom of Sicily resulted in the development of the scherma di stiletto siciliano (Sicilian school of stiletto fighting). The stiletto was purely a thrusting or stabbing weapon, and the scherma di stiletto siciliano accordingly taught fighting movements designed to avoid the tip of the opponent's blade (scanso). Techniques characteristic of the scherma di stiletto siciliano include sbasso (bending to ground), in quarto tagliata (tacking to left or right), and the balzo (leap to evade the enemy‚Äôs blade). A person skilled in the use of a stiletto would thrust the knife deep into the victim, then twist the blade sharply in various directions before retracting it, causing the sharp point to inflict severe internal damage not readily apparent when examining the entrance wound.Lathrop, Walter M.D., American Medicine: Modern Treatment of Wounds, Vol. 7 No. 4, January 23, 1904, p. 151: The resident surgeon at the Pennsylvania State Hospital in Hazleton noted the severe internal wounds caused by a stiletto used by a trained operator. Andalucia A navaja of traditional design, with a blade. In Andalusian Spain, the use of the large navaja (folding knife) as a fighting knife has been commonly used by the peoples of that region since the 17th century.de Rementeria y Fica, Mariano, Manual of the Baratero (transl. and annot. by James Loriega), Boulder, CO: Paladin Press, (2005)Davillier, Jean Charles, Spain, London: Scribner, Welford and Armstrong Ltd. (1876) In that part of Spain, sword and knife fighting techniques (espada y daga) were regularly taught to young men as a necessary skill, often passed down from father to son as a rite of passage to adulthood (and in some cases, to daughters as well).Loriega, James, Sevillian Steel: The Traditional Knife-Fighting Arts Of Spain, Boulder, CO: Paladin Press, (1999): An exception to the manly use of the navaja as a fighting knife was the salvavirgo (\\"chastity knife\\"), a small knife carried by Andalusian women in a bodice or leg garter as a weapon of self-defence.Gautier, Th√©ophile, A Romantic in Spain, (orig. publ. as Voyage en Espagne, Charpentier, 1858) Interlink Books, (2001), p. 158 In 18th- and 19th-century Spain esgrimas de navaja (fencing, or knife-fighting schools) could be found in the major cities and throughout Andaluc√≠a, particularly in C√≥rdoba, M√°laga, and Seville. As time went on, these schools began to depart from teaching traditional sword- fighting and fencing techniques in favour of simplified attacks and defences based largely on the concept of deception, distraction, and counterstrike.Castle, Egerton, Schools and Masters of Fence: from the Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century, London: George Bell & Sons (1885), pp. 8, 174 Among navaja aficionados, the gamblers or barateros of M√°laga and Seville were cited as the most skilled practitioners of fighting with the navaja.Scott, Samuel P., Through Spain: A Narrative of Travel and Adventure in the Peninsula, Philadelphia, PA: J.P. Lippincott Company (1886), pp. 130‚Äì134Loriega, James, Sevillian Steel: The Traditional Knife-Fighting Arts Of Spain, Boulder, CO: Paladin Press, (1999) The firmly-established knife- fighting tradition with the navaja in Andalusian Spain would later spread to other Spanish-speaking countries, and was known as el legado Andaluz, or \\"the Andalusian legacy\\".Gautier, Th√©ophile, A Romantic in Spain, p. 158: \\"The navaja is the Spaniards' favourite weapon...they wield it with incredible dexterity, making a shield of their cloak, which they roll round the left arm.\\" Esgrima Criolla The Esgrima Criolla (\\"Creole fencing\\") method of knife fighting was popularized by the South American gaucho and his large- bladed fac√≥n. Deprived of their ability to wear a sword by various edicts, Spanish gentlemen in South America adopted the fac√≥n,Estrada, Santiago, Miscel√°nea: El Duelo, Barcelona: Henrich y Compania (1889) p. 249: \\"Entre las reliquias de la Conquista que el nuestro conserva, se cuenta la afici√≥n de los caballeros espa√±oles √° desnudar la espada, transmitida en la madre patria al majo, educado en la plaza de toros. El fac√≥n es hermano leg√≠timo de la navaja sevillana.\\" together with fighting techniques developed directly from el legado Andaluz, including the use of an item of clothing such as a poncho or cloak to protect the weaponless arm.de Rementeria y Fica, Manual of the Baratero, pp 5‚Äì6, 9, 12: The escrima de Criolla method of knife fighting employed by the gaucho, using clothing to protect the weaponless arm, is derived directly from el legado Andaluz. The fac√≥n was later universally adopted by the gaucho in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and later by men of the rural working class of those countries.Foster, David W., Lockhart, Melissa F., and Lockhart, Darrell B., Culture and Customs of Argentina, Greenwood Publishing Group, (1998), pp. 42‚Äì43 Knives similar in style and length to the fac√≥n were carried by a wide variety of South American men who were either prohibited from carrying swords or who needed a more convenient, wearable close combat weapon. In an 1828 account of the capture of Las Damas Argentinas, a pirate schooner carrying a mixed group of Spanish-speaking pirates, the carrying of knives very similar to the fac√≥n is mentioned: \\"Amongst these [weapons], were a large number of long knives ‚Äì weapons which the Spaniards use very dexterously. They are about the size of a common English carving knife, but for several inches up the blade cut both sides.\\"Wood, Enoch, An Account of the Pirates Executed at St. Christopher's, in the West Indies, in 1828, London: John Mason (1830) After the turn of the 19th century, the fac√≥n became more of a utility and ceremonial weapon, though it was still used to settle arguments \\"of honor\\". In these situations two adversaries would attack with slashing attacks to the face, stopping the fight when one of the participants could no longer see due to bleeding from shallow cuts.F. Molina Campos: He Paints the Cowboys of the Argentine Pampas Life Magazine, Vol. 4, No. 25, June 20, 1938, p. 35  Arnis  Arnis, also referred to as Eskrima and Kali, is an indigenous Philippine martial art involving the use of sticks, knives and other bladed weapons. Like most other knife fighting traditions, Eskrima is learned by constant practice, using sparring encounters between two or more opponents in order to hone a practitioner's physical skills and mental concentration. This martial art flourished for hundreds of years as part of a society with a blade culture, and the system's already impressive indigenous techniques were later directly influenced by Spanish and Andalusian fencing and knife fighting systems with the introduction of the angles of attack and the use of espada y daga (the word eskrima is a Filipinization of the Spanish word esgrima, meaning a fighting or fencing school).History of Eskrima, retrieved 1 August 2011 =Modern techniques= International Settlement in Shanghai, during the 1920s. Modern tactics for knife combat were developed by two British members of the Shanghai Municipal Police of the International Settlement in the 1920s. At the time, the Shanghai streets were rife with criminal activity, exacerbated by the political tensions of the time and the breakdown of social order in much of the country. Captain William E. Fairbairn and Sergeant Eric A. Sykes developed knife fighting skills and defences, which they began teaching to both police recruits and members of the British Army, Royal Marines and U.S. Marine units then stationed in Shanghai.Chambers, John W., OSS Training in the National Parks and Service Abroad in World War II, Washington, D.C., U.S. National Park Service (2008), p. 191 Fairbairn reportedly engaged in hundreds of street fights in his twenty-year career in Shanghai, where he organized and headed a special anti-riot squad. Much of his body ‚Äì arms, legs, torso, and even the palms of his hands ‚Äì was covered with scars from knife wounds from those fights. During World War II, Fairbairn and Sykes continued to refine their knife fighting techniques for military and paramilitary forces, teaching British Commandos, Special Operations Executive (SOE) personnel, selected American and foreign soldiers and covert espionage personnel, including members of the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and US/UK combined Operation Jedburgh teams. Their experience in training both soldiers and civilians in quick-kill knife fighting techniques eventually led to the development of a specialized fighting dagger suited for both covert elimination of enemy sentinels and close-combat knife fighting, the Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife, a landmark weapon of its type. Fairbairn- Sykes Fighting Knife diagram from Kill or Get Killed, by Rex Applegate. The knife was designed exclusively for surprise attack and fighting, with a slender blade that can easily penetrate a ribcage. The vase handle grants precise grip, and the blade's design is especially suited to its use as a fighting knife. Fairbairn's rationale is in his book Get Tough! (1942). > \\"In close-quarters fighting there is no more deadly weapon than the knife. > In choosing a knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance > and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should > not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from your fingers in a loose > grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good > cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends > to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the > wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.\\" The length of the blade was chosen to give several inches of blade to penetrate the body after passing through the of the thickest clothing that was anticipated to be worn in the war, namely that of Soviet greatcoats. Later production runs of the F‚ÄìS fighting knife have a blade length that is about . In all cases, the handle had a distinctive foil-like grip to enable a number of handling options. Many variations on the F‚ÄìS fighting knife exist in regards to size of blade and particularly of handle. The design has influenced the design of knives throughout the many decades since its introduction. Basic knife fighting techniques There are several ways a knife can be held for offensive or defensive use. The two most common are the forward and reverse grips. Each grip has advantages and disadvantages. Holding the knife in one of the forward grips allows for more finesse and a longer reach, while a reverse grip allows for more power. The reverse grip is regarded as more difficult to master in knife-on-knife combat, as it may require additional skills in footwork and rapid defensive body movements to offset the increased danger of moving closer to one's opponent and the reach of his/her blade. =Forward grips= The following are variations of the forward grip: * Hammer grip ‚Äì the hand is wrapped around the knife handle, with the thumb on top of the fist, as if gripping a hammer * Saber grip ‚Äì the hand is wrapped around the knife handle, while the thumb is placed on the top of either the handle or the spine of the blade * Modified saber grip ‚Äì as before, but with the thumb wedged against the flat dimension of the blade. * Palm grip ‚Äì the knife handle lies diagonally across the outstretched palm, while the thumb is pressed flat against either the forward end of the handle or (optionally) the blade's ricasso.Applegate, Rex (Col.), Kill or Get Killed, Paladin Press, (1976), pp. 71‚Äì76 * Filipino grip ‚Äì same as the hammer grip, except that the thumb is placed along the spine, either floating above or in contact with it. The grip is based on Filipino Martial Arts concepts. * Forward grip edge up ‚Äì similar to a saber grip, but with the knife handle rotated along the axis of the forearm, so the edge is facing upwards. =Reverse grips= The following are variations of the reverse grip: * Gash V. attack ‚Äì aka \\"reverse grip edge out\\" or RGEO, where the hand is wrapped around the handle with the blade end next to the little finger (opposite side of the hand from the thumb) with edge facing outward towards the opponent.Cassidy, William L., The Complete Book Of Knife Fighting, (1997), p. 22 * Icepick grip ‚Äì aka the pakal grip. The knife is held in a hammer grip but with blade reversed. This grip is usually used in concert with an overhand and downward thrusting or stabbing stroke. While the icepick grip is frequently employed by untrained knife users (esp. persons of lesser strength in an attempt to increase thrusting forceLaFond, James, Reality of the Stab: Uses of the Ice-Pick Grip in Actual Knife and Shank Attacks, Black Belt Magazine, Vol. 40, No. 9 (September 2002), pp. 96‚Äì100), it may also be used by a skilled knife fighter as part of a sophisticated system that includes footwork and body movements including parrying and deception defenses.Petermann, Eric, Knife Advice Not for Export, Black Belt Magazine, Vol. 41, No. 3 (March 2003), p. 12 The major risk with this grip is that the blade is facing the user and can potentially fold back into the arm.

Renamed the trade promotion authority (TPA) in 2002, fast track negotiating authority is an impermanent power granted by Congress to the President. Fast track authority remained in effect from 1975 to 1994, pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974, and from 2002 to 2007 by the Trade Act of 2002. Although it technically expired in July 2007, it remained in effect for agreements that were already under negotiation until their passage in 2011. The following year, the Obama administration sought renewal of TPA, and in June 2015, it passed Congress and was signed into law by the President. Known as the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, the legislation conferred on the Obama administration \\"enhanced power to negotiate major trade agreements with Asia and Europe.\\" Enactment and history Congress started the fast track authority in the Trade Act of 1974, ¬ß 151‚Äì154 (). This authority was set to expire in 1980, but was extended for eight years in 1979.Trade Agreements Act of 1979, , By that grant of authority and procedure, Congress then enacted implementing legislation for the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Area, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement.

In October 2011, the Congress and President Obama enacted into law the Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, the South Korea‚ÄìU.S. Free Trade Agreement, and the Panama‚ÄìU.S. Trade Promotion Agreement using fast track rules, all of which the George W. Bush administration signed before the deadline. =TPP and 2015 reauthorization= In early 2012, the Obama administration indicated that renewal of the authority is a requirement for the conclusion of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, which have been undertaken as if the authority were still in effect. After several years of debate, trade-promotion authority was again granted by the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, along with a law providing for \\"trade adjustment assistance, the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. US House Vote on the Trade Promotion Authority Bill, 18 June 2015 As of 2013, the majority of United States free trade agreements were implemented as congressional-executive agreements. Unlike treaties, such agreements require a majority of the House and Senate to pass. Under trade promotion authority (TPA) , established by the Trade Act of 1974 and renewed by the Trade Act of 2002, Congress authorizes the President to negotiate \\"free trade agreements ... if they are approved by both houses in a bill enacted into public law and other statutory conditions are met.\\" This authority had expired (except for agreements already under negotiation) in 2007. In early 2012, the Obama administration indicated that a requirement for the conclusion of TPP negotiations was the renewal of TPA. This required the United States Congress to introduce and vote on an administration-authored bill for implementing the TPP with minimal debate and no amendments, with the entire process taking no more than 90 days. In December 2013, 151 House Democrats signed a letter written by Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) and George Miller (D-CA), which opposed the fast track trade promotion authority for the TPP. Several House Republicans opposed the measure on the grounds that it empowered the executive branch. In January 2014, House Democrats refused to put forward a co-sponsor for the legislation, hampering the bill's prospects for passage.Zach Carter and Michael McAuliff (9 January 2014). \\"House Democrats Balk At Efforts By Obama, Boehner On Controversial Pacific Trade Deal\\". The Huffington Post. Retrieved 10 January 2014. On 16 April 2015, several U.S. Senators introduced \\"The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015\\", which is commonly known as TPA Fast-track legislation. The bill passed the Senate on 21 May 2015, by a vote of 62 to 38, with 31 Democrats, five Republicans and both Independents opposing.Senate votes , The New York Times, 21 May 2015. Retrieved 20 September 2015. The bill went to the U.S. House of Representatives, which narrowly passed the bill 218-208, and also removed the Trade Adjustment Assistance portions of the Senate bill. The TPA was passed by the Senate on 24 June 2015, without the TAA provisions, requiring only the signature of the President before becoming law. President Obama expressed a desire to sign the TPA and TAA together, and did sign both into law on 29 June, as the TAA was able to make its way through Congress in a separate bill. The TPA law is known as the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, and the TAA law is known as the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. The ultimate approval of this legislation conferred on the Obama administration \\"enhanced power to negotiate major trade agreements with Asia and Europe.\\" Through the TPA, Obama could \\"submit trade deals to Congress for an expedited vote without amendments.\\" The successful conclusion of these bilateral talks was necessary before the other ten TPP members could complete the trade deal. Procedure If the President transmits a fast track trade agreement to Congress, then the majority leaders of the House and Senate or their designees must introduce the implementing bill submitted by the President on the first day on which their House is in session. (.) Senators and Representatives may not amend the President‚Äôs bill, either in committee or in the Senate or House. (.) The committees to which the bill has been referred have 45 days after its introduction to report the bill, or be automatically discharged, and each House must vote within 15 days after the bill is reported or discharged. (.) In the likely case that the bill is a revenue bill (as tariffs are revenues), the bill must originate in the House (see U.S. Const., art I, sec. 7), and after the Senate received the House-passed bill, the Finance Committee would have another 15 days to report the bill or be discharged, and then the Senate would have another 15 days to pass the bill. (.) On the House and Senate floors, each Body can debate the bill for no more than 20 hours, and thus Senators cannot filibuster the bill and it will pass with a simple majority vote. (.) Thus the entire Congressional consideration could take no longer than 90 days. Negotiating objectives According to the Congressional Research Service, Congress categorizes trade negotiating objectives in three ways: overall objectives, principal objectives, and other priorities. The broader goals encapsulate the overall direction trade negotiations take, such as enhancing the United States' and other countries' economies. Principal objectives are detailed goals that Congress expects to be integrated into trade agreements, such as \\"reducing barriers and distortions to trade (e.g., goods, services, agriculture); protecting foreign investment and intellectual property rights; encouraging transparency; establishing fair regulatory practices; combating corruption; ensuring that countries enforce their environmental and labor laws; providing for an effective dispute settlement process; and protecting the U.S. right to enforce its trade remedy laws\\". Consulting Congress is also an important objective. Principal objectives include: *Market access: These negotiating objectives seek to reduce or eliminate barriers that limit market access for U.S. products. \\"It also calls for the use of sectoral tariff and non-tariff barrier elimination agreements to achieve greater market access.\\" *Services: Services objectives \\"require that U.S. negotiator strive to reduce or eliminate barriers to trade in services, including regulations that deny nondiscriminatory treatment to U.S. services and inhibit the right of establishment (through foreign investment) to U.S. service providers.\\" *Agriculture: There are three negotiating objectives regarding agriculture. One lays out in greater detail what U.S. negotiators should achieve in negotiating robust trade rules on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures. The second calls for trade negotiators to ensure transparency in how tariff-rate quotas are administered that may impede market access opportunities. The third seeks to eliminate and prevent the improper use of a country‚Äôs system to protect or recognize geographical indications (GI). These are trademark-like terms used to protect the quality and reputation of distinctive agricultural products, wines and spirits produced in a particular region of a country. This new objective is intended to counter in large part the European Union‚Äôs efforts to include GI protection in its bilateral trade agreements for the names of its products that U.S. and other country exporters argue are generic in nature or commonly used across borders, such as parma ham or Parmesan cheese.‚Äù *Investment/Investor rights: ‚ÄúThe overall negotiating objectives on foreign investment are designed ‚Äúto reduce or eliminate artificial or trade distorting barriers to foreign investment, while ensuring that foreign investors in the United States are not accorded greater substantive rights with respect to investment protections than domestic investors in the United States, and to secure for investors important rights comparable to those that would be available under the United States legal principles and practices.\\" Scope Fast track agreements were enacted as \\"congressional-executive agreements\\" (CEAs), which must be approved by a simple majority in both chambers of Congress. Although Congress cannot explicitly transfer its powers to the executive branch, the 1974 trade promotion authority had the effect of delegating power to the executive, minimizing consideration of the public interest, and limiting the legislature's influence over the bill to an up or down vote: *It allowed the executive branch to select countries for, set the substance of, negotiate and then sign trade agreements without prior congressional approval. *It allowed the executive branch to negotiate trade agreements covering more than just tariffs and quotas. *It established a committee system, comprising 700 industry representatives appointed by the president, to serve as advisors to the negotiations. Throughout trade talks, these individuals had access to confidential negotiating documents. Most members of Congress and the public had no such access, and there were no committees for consumer, health, environmental or other public interests. *It empowered the executive branch to author an agreement's implementing legislation without Congressional input. *It required the executive branch to notify Congress 90 days before signing and entering into an agreement, but allowed unlimited time for the implementing legislation to be submitted. *It forced a floor vote on the agreement and its implementing legislation in both chambers of Congress; the matters could not \\"die in committee.\\" *It eliminated several floor procedures, including Senate unanimous consent, normal debate and cloture rules, and the ability to amend the legislation. *It prevented filibuster by limiting debate to 20 hours in each chamber. *It elevated the Special Trade Representative (STR) to the cabinet level, and required the Executive Office to house the agency. The 1979 version of the authority changed the name of the STR to the U.S. Trade Representative. The 2002 version of the authority created an additional requirement for 90-day notice to Congress before negotiations could begin. Arguments in favor *Helps pass trade agreements: According to AT&T; Chairman and CEO Randall L. Stephenson, Trade Promotion Authority is \\"critical to completing new trade agreements that have the potential to unleash U.S. economic growth and investment\\". Jason Furman, chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, also said \\"the United States might become less competitive globally if it disengaged from seeking further trade openings: 'If you're not in an agreement‚Äîthat trade will be diverted from us to someone else‚Äîwe will lose out to another country'\\". *Congress is allowed more say and members are shielded: According to I.M. Destler of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, fast track \\"has effectively bridged the division of power between the two branches. It gives executive branch (USTR) negotiators needed credibility to conclude trade agreements by assuring other nations' representatives that Congress won't rework them; it guarantees a major Congressional role in trade policy while reducing members' vulnerability to special interests‚Äù. *Assurance for foreign governments: According to President Reagan's Attorney General Edwin Meese III, \\"it is extremely difficult for any U.S. President to negotiate significant trade deals if he cannot assure other nations that Congress will refrain from adding numerous amendments and conditions that must then be taken back to the negotiating table\\". The very nature of Trade Promotion Authority requires Congress to vote on the agreements before they can take effect, meaning that without TPA, \\"those agreements might never even be negotiated\\". Arguments against *Unconstitutional: Groups opposed to Trade Promotion Authority claim that it places too much power in the executive branch, \\"allowing the president to unilaterally select partner countries for ‚Äòtrade‚Äô pacts, decide the agreements' contents, and then negotiate and sign the agreements‚Äîall before Congress has a vote on the matter. Normal congressional committee processes are forbidden, meaning that the executive branch is empowered to write lengthy legislation on its own with no review or amendments.\\" Article II, Section 2. He (the President) shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur... *Lack of transparency: Democratic members of Congress and general right-to-know internet groups are among those opposed to trade fast track on grounds of a lack of transparency. Such Congressmen have complained that fast track forces \\"members to jump over hurdles to see negotiation texts and blocks staffer involvement. In 2012, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) complained that corporate lobbyists were given easy access while his office was being stymied, and even introduced protest legislation requiring more congressional input.\\" Renewed interest On June 12, 2015, following a surprise visit from President Obama to Capitol Hill, the House voted on three amendments related to trade, including the renewal of trade promotion authority. The House overwhelmingly voted against a related measure, Trade Adjustment Assistance, which would have had to have passed in order for the rest of the trade measures to go through, therefore the TPA effectively failed in the House. But it passed narrowly (212-202) on June 18, 2015 after Trade Adjustment Assistance was delinked from the TPA. On June 24, 2015, the TPA passed the Senate. It was signed into law by President Obama on June 29. References Further reading *Dauster, William G. Trade Promotion Authority Annotated. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 2007.

Along the corridor's 21 proposed stations there are 106,000 jobs within a 10-minute walk. The project is currently in an environmental analysis phase with further development, engineering, and construction expected to take at least six more years. Service would run 7-days a week with 10-minute headways in peak periods and 15-minute service at most other times. The corridor is named the Rush Line because it was originally planned to end in Rush City, Minnesota. Potential commuter rail At one point the project was proposed to be commuter rail all the way to Hinckley, Minnesota. The corridor studied roughly follows the path of U.S. Route 61 and Interstate 35. Along with the Red Rock Corridor in the southeast and the Southwest Corridor in the southwest metro, it is considered a \\"Tier Two\\" commuter rail project with scheduled implementation after 2020. Efforts to improve the corridor are coordinated by the Rush Line Corridor Task Force, formed in 1999 and composed of 22 elected officials from counties and municipalities along the corridor. Commuter rail costs were expected to be high if implemented, due to the multiple railroads operating the tracks, additionally some sections of rail would have to be rebuilt on county-owned abandoned rights-of-way. Existing rail is a combination of Class I and Class III railroads. Despite a relatively high population density, projected ridership is lower than originally anticipated because commuters are split in their final destination, mostly downtown Saint Paul or downtown Minneapolis. If built, it could connect with the proposed Northern Lights Express in Hinckley and provide a more direct link between Saint Paul and Duluth. Alternatives study Alternatives to commuter rail were presented, including the implementation bus rapid transit throughout the corridor or light rail in the Ramsey County portion, from Union Depot to White Bear Lake. Despite having significantly lower operating costs than commuter rail, light rail would require taking lanes on East Seventh Street in downtown Saint Paul, additionally track right of way would run close to residential structures. The Ramsey and Washington county portions of the corridor are served by local Metro Transit bus routes. In September 2009, the Metropolitan Council awarded $3.4 million to extend the existing park and ride facilities at Maplewood Mall. In September 2010, a commuter bus service is expected to begin service in the corridor. Originating from Columbus and Forest Lake, the route is planning a stop in White Bear Township en route to multiple stops in downtown Saint Paul before terminating at Union Depot. Ridership is expected at 200 persons a day. The Rush Line Task Force and the Metropolitan Council are looking for access to county and federal funds to cover capital costs. A preliminary study was released in September 2015 by the Rush Line Task Force narrowing down the options to 4 types of vehicles and routes that will be considered for the project. The options include: * Dedicated bus rapid transit from the Union Depot to downtown Forest Lake * Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) train between the Union Depot to White Bear Lake * Light Rail Transit (LRT) train between the Union Depot to White Bear Lake * Arterial Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) between St Paul and White Bear Lake A second phase of the study will be completed during Winter 2015 and Spring 2016 timeframe, according to page 5 of the Tier 1 Evaluation Results report. Chosen Locally Preferred Alternative Ramsey County approved the Locally Preferred Alternative in September 2017. The bus rapid transit project will travel the 14-miles from Saint Paul Union Depot to downtown White Beak Lake on 85-90% dedicated guideway. The project initially had 20 stations but at the public's request an additional station was added. The project's final station location in downtown White Bear Lake has generated controversy. The project would cost between $420-470 million and could open as soon as 2026.

History The Savannah in 1912 Aerial picture from 1955 Once sugar land, it was bought by the town council in 1817 from the Peschier family (except for a small parcel near its centre that served as the Peschier cemetery, which remains in private hands). At first it was used as a vast cattle pasture in what was then the town's suburbs, but by the middle of the 19th century it had become established as a park. In the early 20th-century it was used as an airstrip when there were no airports built. Until the early 1990s, horse racing was held frequently at the Savannah race track, and it also contains several cricket, football and rugby pitches. Apart from a ring of trees round its perimeter, the Savannah was never really landscaped, except for the small area in its northwest corner called the Hollows, a former reservoir now drained and planted with flowering shrubs.

It is commonly applied to the phenomenon whereby an engine abruptly ceases operating and stops turning. It might be due to not getting enough air, energy, fuel, or electric spark, fuel starvation, a mechanical failure, or in response to a sudden increase in engine load. This increase in engine load is common in vehicles with a manual transmission when the clutch is released too suddenly. The ways in which a car can stall are usually down to the driver, especially with a manual transmission. For instance, if a driver takes their foot off the clutch too quickly while stationary then the car will stall; taking the foot off the clutch slowly will stop this from happening. Stalling also happens when the driver forgets to depress the clutch and/or change to neutral while coming to a stop. Stalling can be dangerous, especially in heavy traffic. A car fitted with an automatic transmission could also have its engine stalled when the vehicle is travelling in the opposite direction to the selected gear. For example, if the selector is in the 'D' position and the car is moving backwards, (on a steep enough hill to overcome the torque from the torque converter) the engine will stall, due to the fact that the engine is forced to turn in the opposite direction to what it is actually doing. This is because, hypothetically, if the car is rolling backward fast enough, the force from the rotating wheels will be transmitted backward through the transmission and act as a sudden load on the engine. Digital electronics fuel injection and ECU ignition systems have greatly reduced stalling in modern engines.

Smith) (July 2, 1911 ‚Äì May 1, 1997) was an important figure in the aerodynamics field at Douglas Aircraft from 1938 to 1975 and an early pioneer in the area of Computational Fluid Dynamics. Early life A.M.O. Smith was born in Columbia, Missouri. He graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, California in 1929 and went on to study at Compton Junior College in Compton, California and finally the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, where he received his BS in 1936 and his MS in 1938. While at Long Beach, he was a member of the Long Beach Glider Club along with John Pierce, one of the earliest glider clubs in southern California. While at Caltech, he built and tested a number of rockets with Professor Theodore von K√°rm√°n's students Frank Malina, Edward Forman, Jack Parsons and Tsien Hsue-shen. This work led to the formation of Aerojet and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory several years later. Career In June 1938, Smith was hired by the El Segundo Division of Douglas Aircraft. During his time there, he worked on aerodynamic and preliminary design problems of the DC-5, SBD Dauntless, DB-7 Boston, A-20 Havoc and A-26 Invader. In October 1942 he went on a leave of absence, at the request of General H.H. Arnold, to help organize and develop the newly formed Aerojet company as its first Chief Engineer. Under his guidance, the engineering organization at Aerojet grew from six people to over 400 by the time he left. This period saw the development and quantity production of the JATO type rocket at Aerojet. After he returned to Douglas Aircraft in March 1944, he resumed work in aerodynamics and preliminary design. He was responsible for the detailed aerodynamic design of the D-558-I Skystreak, which for a period held the world speed record. He was also responsible for the design of the F3D-1 Skynight. At the end of World War II, he was a member of the US Naval Technical Mission in Europe. In his three months touring captured German aeronautical facilities, he became familiar with the German work on the low drag properties of swept wings at transonic speeds and their development of tailless aircraft. After returning to Douglas, he proposed and began studies for a tailless aircraft. These studies culminated in the design and production of the F4D-1 Skyray interceptor. For a period, the F4D-1 held six FAI World Records, including absolute speed and climb performance. In 1948, he became the Supervisor of Design Research at Douglas, a position he held until 1954. During this period, he conducted research into a number of areas, including laminar flow control and a means of calculating low speed flow about arbitrary bodies - Computational Fluid Dynamics. In 1954 he became Supervisor of Aerodynamics Research and from 1969 to 1975 he was Chief Aerodynamics Engineer - Research at Douglas. In this period, he oversaw development of practical methods of analyzing laminar and turbulent boundary layer flow, new and improved static pressure probes, the hydrogen bubble technique of flow visualization, potential flow analysis, analysis of stability and transition of boundary layers and the en method of predicting boundary layer transition. In June 1975, he retired from what was then McDonnell Douglas. After retiring, he was appointed Adjunct Professor at UCLA, a position he held from 1975 to 1980. Personal life Smith was married to Elisabeth Caroline Krost on December 5, 1943. They had three children, Tove Anne Smith, Gerard Nicholas Smith and Kathleen Roberta Smith.

Fowler's cricketing career started at Worcestershire's Second XI in 1979 before he found himself out of the side at the end of the season, thought ineffective as a middle-order batsman after his final-game duck against Yorkshire. Fowler moved to New Zealand in the early part of 1980 in order to play for Northern Districts, who he represented until 1982. He moved to Derbyshire in the 1983 season in time for that year's County Championship. A regular fixture in the first team, he played seventeen out of the twenty-four games of the season, and in the 1984 season, was a middle- order fixture as he recorded his career-best score of 116 against Glamorgan. Alternating between England in the Northern Hemisphere summer and New Zealand in theirs, he did not play another County Championship game after the 1985 season. Fowler played in the Shell Trophy in the last two years of his first- class career.

The second pulse is weaker than the first. Look for a pattern of what appears to be a relatively normal QRS complexes, each followed by a smaller, abnormal one. The smaller beat is palpated as either a missing or an extra beat, and on EKG resembles a PVC. These PVCs appearing every other beat are also called extrasystoles. This phenomenon can be a sign of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or of many other types of heart disease (see list below). Other causes include digitalis toxicity, induction of anesthesia, placement of surgical instrumentation into the thorax or as a benign, temporary phenomenon. In Pulsus Bigeminus not all of the conducted electrical activity will elicit sufficient ventricular contraction to produce a palpable pulse. This is important for two reasons. One, an ECG may give a ventricular contraction rate that does not correspond to the palpated pulse rate. Secondly, because not all beats are being conducted, patients may present with symptoms of low output heart failure, e.g. Dizziness, shortness of breath or hypotension, even with a normal ECG. Cause Causes Include: # Electrolyte imbalance e.g. Hypo or hyperkalemia # Hypothyroidism # Betablocker therapy # Digoxin # Myocardial Infarction # Destruction or degeneration of the cardiac conduction system or heart muscle cells # Infection A doctor can discriminate pulsus bigeminus from pulsus alternans by auscultating the heart. Management Management includes looking for and removing underlying cause, including medicines (such as a Calcium Channel blocker) and inotropic therapy to return cardiac output back to normal. If highly symptomatic over a longer period ablation therapy may be the only viable option.

Joseph b. Tobiah\\" according to David ConforteKore ha-Dorot, p. 24b), Shem Tov moved to the Land of Israel in the hope of finding in the Holy Land a more suitable place for kabbalistic meditation. He lived for some time in Jerusalem, and then settled at Safed.'  Works  At Safed Shem Tov wrote the following works, of which only the first two have been published: *Migdal Oz, a commentary on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah; in this he defends Maimonides against the strictures of Abraham ben David. The part covering the first volume of Mishneh Torah was printed with the text at Constantinople in 1509; and parts of other volumes, also with the text, at Venice in 1524. Certain rabbis, Gedaliah ibn YahyaShalshelet haKabbalah, p. 45b, Amsterdam, 1697 among them, ascribe the Migdal Oz to Ritva. *Keter Shem Tov,Leghorn, 1839 a supercommentary on and continuation of Nahmanides' commentary to the Pentateuch (particularly its kabbalistic part); Shem Tov's interpretations differ from those of Nahmanides in many places. Shem Tov says in his preface that at first he had entitled his work \\"Sitrei Setarim\\", and that he then revised it and gave it the title \\"Keter Shem Tov\\", the work having been completed at Safed in 1315. Isaac ben Samuel of Acre (in his Meirat Einayim) violently attacks Keter Shem Tov, saying that most of the author's theories are not those of the older kabbalists, but are simply his own inventions. Keter Shem Tov is printed at the end of Judah Koriat's Ma'or va-Shemesh, where it is entitled Perush Sodot haTorah; and the preface has been published in Jehiel Ashkenazi's Heichal AdonaiVenice, n.d. under the title Perush Likkutim. *Badei haAron uMigdal Hananel, a kabbalistic work in five parts, finished in the month of Iyyar, 1325, and named by Shem Tov after his traveling companion, Hananel' b. Azkara, who died before reaching his destination. *A supercommentary on Meir Abulafia's Ginnat Bitan, a kabbalistic commentary on Genesis. *A commentary on Saadia Bekor Shor's kabbalistic poem, which he quotes in his Badei haAron. *Sefer haPe'er, a kabbalistic treatise on tefillin.

Coercive tactics, or \\"coercive psychological systems\\", are defined on their website as \\"unethical mind control such as brainwashing, thought reform, destructive persuasion and coercive persuasion\\". The founding thesis of FACTNet -- that cults use mind control and brainwashing on their members -- remains a debated subject; with Margaret Singer, Philip Zimbardo, and some others in the anti-cult movement promoting the concept while Eileen Barker, James Richardson, and other scholars, as well as legal experts, rejecting at least the popular understanding of brainwashing.  Conflict with Church of Scientology  In 1995 FACTNet was featured in the news due to a lawsuit regarding the seizure of FACTNet servers and files by the Religious Technology Center (RTC), a sub-organization of the Church of Scientology created to oversee the protection of its trademarks and copyrights. In August 1995 RTC lawyers went to a Denver judge alleging copyright infringement and illegal use of Scientology documents by FACTNet, a vocal critic of the organization's practices. A raid of two directors' homes was conducted on August 21, 1995 by two U.S. marshals and six RTC representatives, with the actual search for incriminating documents conducted by the RTC alone. Witnesses of the searches testified that the marshals allowed the RTC representatives to go far beyond the scope of the order in their search for information. The marshals also failed to search the representatives before or after the search, making it possible for them to carry off disks and other documents containing critical information. FACTNet immediately accused the Church of Scientology of attempting to silence their voice by stealing and contaminating information vital to their continued attacks and lawsuits against the Church. The raids provoked debate both on the internet and in the university setting, with university protesters in Denver, Colorado holding signs that read: \\"Hands Off the Internet\\" and \\"Scientology Harasses Critics,\\" while counterprotesters at the Boulder County Courthouse carried signs such as: \\"Only criminals spread lawlessness on the Internet.\\" FACTNet filed a lawsuit, and on September 14, 1995 a Federal judge ruled the seizure illegal because it violated FACTNet's right to free speech on the internet, and ordered the RTC to return all computers and files that were seized. In his ruling in United States District Court, Judge John Kane stated: \\"The public interest is best served by the free exchange of ideas.\\" Nevertheless, FACTNet states that it has incurred irreparable damage, as the secrecy of its documents had been violated by the RTC. An attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation approved of the Judge's decision in the matter, stating: \\"They certainly do not have the right to seize everything and to fish around. There seems to be this thought that things that are contained on a computer aren't subject to the same protections. I think the law is catching up.\\" Helena K. Kobrin a Church of Scientology attorney with the firm Moxon & Kobrin, defended the seizures of the computers, saying after the judge's decision: \\"The decision yesterday was a very sad day for intellectual property owners and a very sad day for the Internet.\\" In a series of cases, Scientology (through subsidiary Bridge Publications) sued FACTNet for claimed copyright violations. In 1998, federal judge John Kane denied Scientology's request for summary judgment because FACTNet challenged Scientology's ownership of the copyrights of the documents. A settlement was later reached in 1999, whose terms were that if FACTNet is ever found guilty of violations of church copyrights, they are permanently enjoined to pay the church $1 million. FACTNet has maintained a relatively low news profile since 1999, occasionally cited for speaking out against topics they consider important. The 2000 film Battlefield Earth starring John Travolta stirred up controversy because it was based on a book by L. R. Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology, and Travolta was a well-known Scientologist. The Guardian reported on FACTnet's claims that the film was a proselytism piece for Scientology, noting: \\"FACTnet suggested that subliminal messages had been cunningly inserted by Scientologists to win over new converts to join the church.\\" The makers of the film asserted that it had nothing to do with the Church of Scientology, but The New York Times reported on FACTnet's assertions that: \\"..the film was secretly financed by Scientology, and that Scientology plans recruiting efforts to coincide with the movie's release.\\" Sociology professor James Richardson did not agree with FACTnet's claims, stating: \\"I seriously doubt that someone is going to go out and join Scientology just because they see this movie.\\" In 2002, after Lawrence Wollersheim won an US$8.7 million judgement against the Church of Scientology, FACTnet posted a statement from him on the site, quoting: \\"The cult that vowed it would never pay me one thin dime has now paid over 86 million thin dimes.\\" FACTNet spoke out in support of an episode of the TV show South Park, awarding their staff the \\"FACTNet Person(s) of the Year for 2005\\" for the satirical episode on Scientology, \\"Trapped in the Closet\\". In 2006, FACTnet director Wollersheim was consulted for the 48 Hours story on the death of Scientologist Elli Perkins, \\"Scientology - A Question of Faith.\\" Wollersheim was quoted in the piece, stating: \\"Scientology. They are the worst example of mind control in a religious setting that has ever existed\\". The program also noted that the Church of Scientology characterizes him as a \\"liar and a fraud,\\" and asserts that most of its members live happy and fulfilled lives.  Internet law  Legal cases involving the organization and the Religious Technology Center are cited in analysis of fair use law. The book Internet and Online Law noted that \\"reproduction in computer format of plaintiff's entire copyrighted texts for defendants' private use and study falls well within the fair use exception.\\" The work Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age characterized FACTNet as part of the \\"publishers and posters\\" group, when analyzing Scientology related legal cases in the chapter: \\"The Battle over Copyright on the Net.\\" The author also placed Dennis Erlich and Arnie Lerma in this classification while analyzing actions taken by the Church of Scientology, which the author calls a \\"famously litigious organization.\\"  See also  *Copyright infringement *Fair use *Freedom of speech *Scientology and the legal system *Scientology controversy *Search and seizure References  Further reading    External links EFF Electronic Frontier Foundation \\"Legal Cases - Church of Scientology\\" Archive Category:Critics of Scientology Category:Anti-cult organizations Category:Scientology and the Internet ","title":"Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network"},{"id":"7651212","text":"The Institute for Energy and Transport (IET) is one of the seven scientific Institutes of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), a Directorate General of the European Commission (EC).

Description This mushroom is recognized by its large, orange-brown cap partially covered by a thick patch of universal veil, its white gills and spores, its cream-colored stalk adorned with a partial veil, a partially hollow stem (filled with a stringy white pith), and by the presence of a large, sacklike volva at the base of the stalk. The spores of this species do not change color when placed in a solution of Melzer's reagent, and thus are termed inamyloid. This characteristic in combination with the annulus and absence of a bulb at the base of the stalk place this mushroom in the Section Caesareae. Distribution and habitat This mushroom forms mycorrhizae with madrone (Arbutus menziesii) in the southern part of its range (Central California northwards to Washington). However, in the northern part of its range (Washington to southern Canada), its preferred host is Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Amanita calyptroderma in Oakland, California Edibility Experienced mushroom hunters regard this mushroom as a good edible species, but caution must be exercised when collecting A. calyptroderma for the table, since it can be confused with other species in the genus Amanita.

It was first performed in Leipzig on 27 October 1726, and is part of Bach's third cantata cycle. The composition is indicated as solo cantata () while it requires only a single vocal soloist, in this case a bass. Bach rarely used the word to refer to a composition: the autograph score of BWV56 is one of a few cases where he did. The text, by Christoph Birkmann, describes the Christian life as a voluntary journey \\"carrying the cross\\" as a follower of Jesus. The words indirectly refer to the prescribed Gospel reading, which says that Jesus traveled by boat. The poet compares life to a sea voyage, and at the end yearns for death as the ultimate destination. This final desire for death is reinforced by the closing chorale: the stanza \\"'\\" (\\"Come, o death, you brother of sleep\\") from Johann Franck's 1653 hymn \\"\\", which also uses the imagery of a sea voyage. Bach composed the cantata in his fourth year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. It is structured in five movements, alternating arias and recitatives for a bass soloist and closing with a four- part chorale. He scored the work for a Baroque instrumental ensemble of three woodwind instruments (two oboes and taille), three string instruments (two violins and a viola) and continuo. An obbligato cello features in the first recitative and an obbligato oboe in the second aria, resulting in different timbres in the four movements for the same voice part. The cantata was recorded early and often. Albert Schweitzer wrote in his book about the composer, \\"This is one of the most splendid of Bach's works.\\" The closing chorale appears in Robert Schneider's 1992 novel, Schlafes Bruder, and its film adaption Brother of Sleep.  Background  Bach was appointed by the town of Leipzig as its Thomaskantor (director of church music) in 1723. The position made him responsible for the music at four churches, and the training and education of boys singing in the Thomanerchor. Cantata music was required for two major churches, Thomaskirche (St. Thomas) and Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas), and simpler church music for two smaller churches: Neue Kirche (New Church) and Peterskirche (St. Peter). Bach took office in the middle of the liturgical year, on the first Sunday after Trinity. In Leipzig, cantata music was expected on Sundays and feast days except for the \\"silent periods\\" (tempus clausum) of Advent and Lent. In his first year, Bach decided to compose new works for almost all liturgical events; these works became known as his first cantata cycle. He continued the following year, composing a cycle of chorale cantatas with each cantata based on a Lutheran hymn. = Third Leipzig cantata cycle = The third cantata cycle encompasses works composed during Bach's third and fourth years in Leipzig, and include . It differs from the first two cycles, using fewer extant compositions. One characteristic of the third cycle is that Bach performed more works by other composers in addition to repeating his own, earlier works. His new works have no common theme, as the chorale cantatas did. Bach demonstrated a new preference for solo cantatas, dialogue cantatas and cantatas dominated by one instrument (known as concertante cantatas). During the third cycle, he repeated performances of solo cantatas from his Weimar period based on texts by Georg Christian Lehms, , and . He Used other texts by Lehms before turning to other librettists. Bach's solo cantatas are modeled after secular Italian works by composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti. Like the models, even church cantatas do not contain biblical text and very few close with a chorale. His writing for solo voice is demanding, and requires trained singers. Richard D. P. Jones, a musicologist and Bach scholar, assumes that Bach \\"exploited the vocal technique and the interpretative skills of particular singers\\". Jones describes some of these solo cantatas, especially , and , as among Bach's \\"most-beloved\\" cantatas. Although dialogue cantatas also appear earlier in Bach's works, all four dialogues between Jesus and the Soul (Anima) ‚Äì based on elements of the Song of Songs ‚Äì are part of the third cycle. The only chorale cantata of the third cycle, , follows the omnes versus style and sets all stanzas of a hymn unchanged; Bach rarely used this style in his chorale cantatas, except in the early and later chorale cantatas.  Occasion and words  Cross staff Bach wrote the cantata for the 19th Sunday after Trinity, during his fourth year in Leipzig. The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from Paul's epistle to the Ephesians ‚Äì \\"Put on the new man, which after God is created\\" () ‚Äì and the Gospel of Matthew: healing the paralytic at Capernaum (). For the occasion, Bach had composed in his first cantata cycle for (Wretched Man That I Am, Who Shall Deliver Me?). In his second cycle he wrote the chorale cantata for , based on the penitential hymn \\"\\" (\\"Where Shall I Flee?\\") by Johann Heermann. = Poet and theme = Until recently the librettist was unknown (as for most of Bach's Leipzig cantatas), but research by Christine Blanken published in 2015 suggests that Christoph Birkmann probably wrote the text of . Birkmann was a student of mathematics and theology at the University of Leipzig from 1724 to 1727. During that time, he also studied with Bach and appeared in cantata performances. Birkmann published a yearbook of cantata texts in 1728, Gott-geheiligte Sabbaths-Zehnden (Sabbath Tithes Devoted to God), which contains several Bach cantatas ‚Äì including . Christoph Birkmann, the cantata's librettist The librettist built on Erdmann Neumeister's text from \\"\\", which was published in 1711. , the Way of the Cross, refers to the Stations of the Cross and more generally to the \\"cross as the burden of any Christian\\". Here is replaced with , which refers to a pilgrim's staff (or bishop's crosier) and a navigational instrument known as a cross staff or Jacob's staff. In the cantata's text, life is compared to a pilgrimage and a sea voyage. Birkmann's text alludes to Matthew's gospel; although there is no explicit reference to the sick man, he speaks in the first person as a follower of Christ who bears his cross and suffers until the end, when (in the words of ) \\"God shall wipe away the tears from their eyes\\". The cantata takes as its starting point the torments which the faithful must endure. The text is rich in biblical references. The metaphor of life as a sea voyage in the first recitative comes from the beginning of that Sunday's Gospel reading: \\"There He went on board a ship and passed over and came into His own city\\" (). Affirmations that God will not forsake the faithful on this journey and will lead them out of tribulation were taken from and . The third movement expresses joy at being united with the saviour, and its text refers to : \\"Those that wait upon the Lord shall gain new strength so that they mount up with wings like an eagle, so that they run and do not grow weary\\". The theme of joy, coupled with a yearning for death, runs through the cantata. The final lines of the opening aria (\\"There my Savior himself will wipe away my tears\\") are repeated just before the closing chorale. This uncommon stylistic device appears several times in the third cantata cycle. = Chorale = A boat on the Sea of Galilee The final chorale is built around the sixth stanza of Johann Franck's hymn, \\"\\", which contains ship imagery: \\"\\" (\\"Release the rudder of my little ship, bring me to the secure harbor\\"). The hymn was published in 1653 with a 1649 melody by Johann Cr√ºger. Its words describe (in the first person) turning away from the beautiful building which is the world (\\"sch√∂nes Weltgeb√§ude\\"), longing only for Jesus (\\"allersch√∂nstes Jesulein\\"). This phrase recurs, with slight variations, at the end of each stanza. = First performance = Bach conducted the cantata's first performance on 27 October 1726. The recital was a week after he had performed another of his solo cantatas, Gott soll allein mein Herze haben, BWV 169, which also (and unusually) ends with a chorale.  Music  = Structure and scoring = The cantata is structured in five movements, with alternating arias, recitatives and a four-part chorale. Bach scored for a bass soloist, a four-part choir () in the closing chorale, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes (Ob), taille (Ot), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), cello (Vc), and basso continuo. Except for the obbligato oboe in the third movement, the three oboes double the violins and viola colla parte. The title page of the autograph score reads: \\"Domin. 19 post Trinit. / Ich will den Xstab gerne tragen / a / 2 / Hautb. o Viol. / Viola o / Taille / 4 Voci / Basso solo / e / Cont. / di / J.S.Bach\\". The score begins with the line \\"\\" (\\"J.J. Sunday 19 after Trinity, Cantata for solo voice, and instruments\\"), making it one of the few works Bach termed a cantata. Its length is reportedly 21 minutes. In the following table, the scoring follows the (New Bach Edition). The keys and time signatures are from Alfred D√ºrr, and use the symbol for common time. The continuo, played throughout, is not shown. = Movements = Musicologist and Bach scholar Christoph Wolff wrote that Bach achieves \\"a finely shaded series of timbres\\" in . Each of the four solo movements are scored differently. All the instruments accompany the opening aria; only the continuo is scored for the secco recitative, an obbligato oboe for the central aria, and strings for the accompagnato recitative. All instruments return for the closing chorale. Schweitzer points out that is among the works in which Bach carefully marked the phrasing of the parts; others are the Brandenburg Concertos, the St Matthew Passion, the Christmas Oratorio and a few other cantatas, including and , BWV 60.  1  John Eliot Gardiner in 2012 The opening aria begins with \\"\\" (\\"I will gladly carry the cross-staff, it comes from God's dear hand\\"). It is in bar form (AAB pattern), with two stollen (A) followed by an abgesang (B). The first stollen begins with a ritornello for full orchestra, anticipating in counterpoint the rising and falling motif of the bass soloist, and mounts with an augmented second marking the word (\\"cross-staff\\"), followed by descending sighing figures signalling the bearing of the cross. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, describes the beginning of the bass melody as a musical pun on the word Kreuzstab, with the upward part \\"a harrowing arpeggio to a sharpened seventh (of the sort Hugo Wolf might later use)\\", and the downward part as \\"six and a half bars of pained descent to signify the ongoing burden of the Cross\\". After the soloist sings a series of melismatic lines, three groups of strings and oboes are introduced as counterpoint and echoing response in a score with motifs from the opening ritornello. The refrain is again taken up in the second stollen, but with significant variations due to the differing text: \\"It leads me after my torments to God in the Promised Land\\". After a repeat of the opening ritornello, the final abgesang contains the words, \\"There at last I will lay my sorrow in the grave, there my Savior himself will wipe away my tears.\\" Declamatory triplets, spanning the bass register, are responded to in the accompaniment by sighing motifs. A reprise of the orchestral ritornello ends the aria.  2  In the second movement, the recitative \\"\\" (\\"My pilgrimage in the world is like a sea voyage\\"), the sea is evoked by the accompanying cello line. Albert Schweitzer noted that Bach was often inspired by a single word to create an image of waves, and recommended augmenting the cello with a viola and bassoon to give more weight to the image. According to Gardiner, the style is reminiscent of older music and the assuring words \\"Ich bin bei dir\\" (\\"I am with you\\") are a \\"whispered comfort\\".  3  Baroque oboe The third movement, the da capo aria \\"\\" (\\"Finally, finally my yoke must fall away from me\\"), illustrates a passage from Isaiah. The lively and joyous concertante is written as a duet for solo oboe, bass soloist and continuo, and is full of elaborate coloraturas in the solo parts. According to Gardiner, in the aria \\"one senses Bach bridging the gap between living and dying with total clarity and utter fearlessness\\".  4  The fourth movement, \\"\\" (\\"I stand ready to receive the inheritance of my divinity with desire and longing from Jesus' hands\\"), is a recitativo accompagnato with strings. It begins as a declamatory recitative, with sustained string accompaniment. After seven bars the time signature changes from 4/4 to 3/4, resuming a simple, calm version of the second half of the abgesang from the first movement and repeating words related to the Book of Revelation in a triplet rhythm. Gardiner describes this change: \\" ... now slowed to adagio and transposed to F minor, and from there by means of melisma floating effortlessly upwards, for the first time, to C major\\".  5  The final four-part chorale, \\"\\" (\\"Come, o death, brother of sleep\\"), with the orchestra doubling the vocal parts, is regarded as an inspired masterpiece. Death is addressed as a brother of sleep and asked to end the voyage of life by loosening the rudders of a small boat and bringing it to safe harbour, marking the end of the cantata's metaphorical journey. Come, O death, of sleep the brother, Come and lead me hence now forth; Loosen now my small bark's rudder, Bring thou me secure to port! Others may desire to shun thee, Thou canst all the more delight me; For through thee I'll come inside To the fairest Jesus-child. The melody was written by Johann Cr√ºger and published in 1646. Bach set the tune in a four-part setting, BWV 301, and introduced dramatic syncopation for the beginning \\"Komm\\" (\\"come\\"). At the end of the penultimate line, torment and dissonance are transformed into glory and harmony and illuminate the words \\"\\" (\\"For through you I will come to my beloved Jesus). Gardiner notes that it is Bach's only setting of Cr√ºger's melody, which recalls the style of his father's cousin Johann Christoph Bach (whom he regarded as a \\"profound composer\\"). Psychologist and gerontologist Andreas Kruse (de) notes that the chorale conveys the transformation and transition from earthly life to an eternal harbour. He compares the setting to \\"Ach Herr, la√ü dein lieb Engelein\\", the closing chorale of Bach's St John Passion, which is focused on sleep and awakening. Both settings end their works with \\"impressive composure\\" (\\"eindrucksvolle Gefasstheit\\").  Manuscripts and publication  The autograph score and parts are held by the Berlin State Library, which is part of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. The fascicle numbers are D-B Mus.ms. Bach P 118 for the score (Partitur) and D-B Mus.ms. Bach ST 58 for the parts (Stimmen). It was published in 1863 in volume 12 of the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe (BGA), edited by Wilhelm Rust. The New Bach Edition (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, NBA) published the score in 1990, edited by Matthias Wendt, with critical commentary published a year later. It was later published by Carus-Verlag in 1999 as part of Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben, a complete edition of Bach's vocal works.  Recordings  The following table is derived from the list on the Bach Cantatas website, which has 81 recordings in 2018. Although some Bach cantatas are almost exclusively recorded in complete cycles by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Gustav Leonhardt, Helmuth Rilling, Ton Koopman, Pieter Jan Leusink, John Eliot Gardiner and Masaaki Suzuki, the expressive singing required by the soloist has interested singers (and ensembles) who do not specialize in Bach. This cantata has been combined with two other cantatas on related topics: Ich habe genug, BWV 82 (a paraphrase of the Song of Simeon) and Der Friede sei mit dir, BWV 158, related to peace. In the table, choirs with one voice per part (OVPP) and ensembles playing period instruments in historically informed performances are marked in green.  Legacy  Albert Schweitzer, author of a 1905 book about Bach entitled J. S. Bach, le musicien po√®te (Bach in the German edition) and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, wrote about the cantata. The book was translated into English six years later by Ernest Newman: \\"This is one of the most splendid of Bach's works. It makes unparalleled demands, however, on the dramatic imagination of the singer, who would depict convincingly this transition from the resigned expectation of death to the jubilant longing for death.\\" = Schlafes Bruder =  Novel  Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen appears in Robert Schneider's 1992 novel, Schlafes Bruder. The protagonist, Elias, improvises on the chorale and decides to commit suicide. The improvisation is described by the first-person narrator, who refers to the chorale's text. The narrator describes its emotional impact on listeners, hearing a young woman say \\"Ich sehe den Himmel\\" (\\"I see heaven\\") and saying that his playing could move a listener to the core of their soul (\\" ... vermochte er den Menschen bis in das Innerste seiner Seele zu ersch√ºttern\\").  Film  Schlafes Bruder inspired the 1995 film Brother of Sleep, directed by Joseph Vilsmaier. Enjott Schneider composed a toccata for the pivotal scene when Elias improvises during an organ competition at the Feldberg Cathedral, \\"hypnotising his listeners with demonic organ sounds\\" (\\"mit d√§monischen Orgelkl√§ngen hypnotisiert\\"). Schneider's toccata quotes the chorale \\"Komm, o Tod, du Schlafes Bruder\\". The composition is dedicated to Harald Feller, an organist and professor in Munich who supplied ideas and recorded the film's music. It premiered at Feldafing's Heilig-Kreuz-Kirche in 1994, and became an internationally-played concert piece.  Opera  The novel inspired a Herbert Willi opera, commissioned by the Opernhaus Z√ºrich, which premiered on 19 May 1996.

It is famous as the seat of Maximilien de B√©thune, duc de Sully, who retired to the old ch√¢teau to heal from his wounds at the battle of Ivry, 1590, and constructed the present building on old foundations in the closing years of the 16th century. It went through several substantial alterations in the 19th and 20th centuries, and a period of neglect in the 1980s and 1990s. As of 2004, it is under renovation. History The ch√¢teau was built of bricks and limestone by Maximilien de B√©thune, duke of Sully, on the site of an old fortified manor that had been dismantled and burned in 1435. In 1529, the old building passed by marriage to Jean de B√©thune, the grandfather of Sully, who was born at the old house, but it was modest by the standards of the day, and he had it replaced in the last years of the 16th century with a new building more befitting his high rank. He is reputed to have ceased building in 1610 at the death of Henri IV, who had visited him there and whose monogram appears on the decorated joists of a room there. Portrait of the Countess of S√©nozan (ca. 1751) by Jean Valade In 1709, the estate passed into the hands of the Olivier family. The ch√¢teau was inherited in 1740 by Jean-Antoine Olivier de S√©nozan (1713-1778), from his brother Fran√ßois Olivier. He took up permanent residence there in 1753, with his wife the Countess of S√©nozan (1718-1794). She was older sister to jurist, statesman and botanist Malesherbes. He was a frequent visitor to the estate. After Jean-Antoine's death in 1778, she seems to have returned to Paris, where she was executed in May 1794, on charges of conspiracy against the state. The estate went to Madeleine Olivier de Senozan de Viriville (1764‚Äì1794), whose son, Edmond de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, sold it in 1817 to a Parisian merchant. From him it was purchased on 14 August 1818 by Charles Ferdinand, duc de Berry at a cost of 2.5 million francs. It was his summer residence until he was assassinated on 13 February 1820. Caroline Ferdinande Louise, duchesse de Berry then became ch√¢telaine of Rosny. In 1826, she employed the architect Joseph-Antoine Froelicher to complete the construction of the wings that had been left unfinished by Sully after the death of Henri IV. Princess Caroline of Naples and Sicily (1825) by Thomas Lawrence When she left France with Charles X in 1830, she bequeathed the ch√¢teau and recommended the staff to her aunt, Queen Marie-Am√©lie. When she had lost any hope of returning to France, after her exile, she sold the ch√¢teau and its property in 1836 to an English banker, who yielded in his turn to an anonymous company of businessmen. The property was then parceled out, and the ch√¢teau was slated to be dismantled. In 1840, the comte Le Marois acquired the estate, and saved the building from total destruction. The new owner, finding the residence too large for his use, demolished the wings built by the Duchess of Berry, leaving the remainder of the construction its current state. The ch√¢teau (in 2006) with Fran√ßois Olivier's iron grillwork gate bearing the family arms From the 19th century until 1955, the ch√¢teau and the property belonged to the Lebaudy family, who arranged the commons to lodge their stables, and their kennels, since they practised fox hunting in the surrounding forests. The ch√¢teau was classified a monument historique in 1941. It hosted the 11th World Scout Conference in 1947. The ch√¢teau was bought in 1955 by Doctor Hertz, who arranged in the commons a center of functional rehabilitation (currently APARC), he and later his widow, continued to live in the ch√¢teau until August 1984. The ch√¢teau was acquired in December 1984 by a Japanese company, the Nippon Sangyo Kabushiki Kaisha and it underwent various degradations, including a fire in January 1997. It was largely stripped of its furniture, tapestries, chimneypieces, ornaments, statues, woodwork and even of certain trees from its parks, which were sold through auctions. It was repossessed by the State, and conservation work was undertaken by the French Ministry of Culture and Communication. Since 1999, the ch√¢teau has belonged to a private owner who wishes to make it a relais-ch√¢teau to accommodate overnight tourists. The work is still in progress, and the ch√¢teau is not open to the public. Notes References *Lucien Bresson. Un homme, un ch√¢teau: Sully √† Rosny. Paris, 1991. *\\"Patrimoine\\".

Dickey was elected as a Republican to the Fortieth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Thaddeus Stevens and on the same day was elected to the Forty-first Congress. He was reelected to the Forty-second Congress. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1872. He was a delegate to the State constitutional convention at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in 1873. He resumed the practice of law in Lancaster and died in 1876. He was interred in Woodward Hill Cemetery.

After suffering a destructive fire and a cholera epidemic in mid-19th century, the village was abandoned. In this period, canal traffic had also fallen off. The area is now maintained as Providence Metropark of Toledo, featuring numerous elements of the canal era, including a mule-drawn canal boat on a restored section of the Miami and Erie Canal, and an operating saw and gristmill.  History  The village of Providence was founded by a French Canadian, Peter Manor, who was the first white man to settle upriver on the Maumee River away from Lake Erie.\\"History of Lucas County\\", Heritage Pursuit He arrived there in 1816 in order to establish a fur trading post for the North West Fur Company, then based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. But the United States prohibited Canadian traders from operating below the border and he was closed down. In 1822, Manor had a sawmill erected next to the river, and a gristmill was built in 1835. This was about 24 miles from the river's mouth on Maumee Bay, where there was still an Odawa people village, part of a 34-square mile reserve on the south side of the river. As the number of settlers increased in Ohio, promoters of the state discussed a proposal for a Miami and Erie Canal to improve transportation to the southwest parts of the state and connect them to markets on and served by Lake Erie. Manor platted the town to prepare for anticipated development. In 1837, the State of Ohio granted Manor a contract to begin construction, and the town was soon open for business. By 1843, some of the eighty-eight lots laid out were vacated. The village was, in general, considered a favorable place to live by the westward settlers. It was often seen as a haven from the problems of lawlessness, drinking, fighting, and crime that began to plague Ohio canal towns.Rettig, 18 A catastrophic fire swept through the village in 1846, destroying most of the many wooden buildings in the central business district. The destroyed buildings were not rebuilt and the town never recovered. In 1854 river travelers brought a cholera epidemic, also spread by contaminated water. Those who survived rapidly left Providence, so fast that most of their possessions were left behind. The remaining structures were eventually destroyed or moved, and the land plats disappeared. On October 28, 1928, Lucas County officially removed Providence from its records. The remaining buildings, the church and the saw and gristmill, have been designated as an historic district by the Department of the Interior.  Miami and Erie Canal  The Miami and Erie Canal was vital to the growth and development of Providence. The canal not only brought goods to the village; it brought passengers, both immigrants and frontiersmen. At a time of few improved roads, water travel had a great advantage over traditional horse and carriage. Because of the large influx of travelers, Providence grew daily. Once the canal began operating, the local economy boomed. Commodity amounts of produce, pelts, grain, and other goods constantly flowed through the village. When the railroads were completed in the 1870s, canal traffic greatly diminished. The canal was abandoned by the 1900s. The slow pace and low capacity of canal boats was no match for what could be offered by the railroads. The site of the village is now preserved in part as Providence Metropark, one of the Toledo Metroparks system. It includes the fully operational Isaac Ludwig mill. Near the gristmill is Lock No. 44 of the canal system; it has been restored. In addition, during the temperate season, the park runs a mule-drawn replica canal boat, The Volunteer, which carries visitors along the small section of restored canal and goes through Lock No. 44.  Remaining structures  Many buildings and structures remain standing in the Providence area. Some have been restored. They include the following: * Isaac Ludwig saw and gristmill, restored in the Historic Providence District * Providence Metropark features a lookout for the Providence dam * Providence Township Schools; four buildings are still standing: ** The Perry School (Neowash and Manore road) ** Long School (Heller and Neowash Road) ** Strayer School (Neowash and State Route 295) ** Box School (Box and Jeffers Road) * St. Patrick Roman Catholic Church, still in use, built in 1845 (the church hall and kitchen were added in 1954) * The Neapolis School and Ford School were both moved to Waterville-Neapolis Road and Manore Road, and united as one building in 1915. In 1967, the united building was converted to an auction house. References Further reading * Huffman, June. (1982) The Providence Record 1981. The Hubbard Company. * Rettig, D. R.

He is mainly known from his releases on the jazz label ECM Records. His main instrument is the trumpet, but he also plays upright bass, vibraphone, piano and guitar. He has performed with several well-known music groups and musicians, e.g. Jaga Jazzist, Manu Katch√©, and the Trondheim Jazz Orchestra together with Chick Corea and Pat Metheny. Besides this he is also known for his collaboration with Norwegian singer-songwriter Thomas Dybdahl, and recordings with the Norwegian bands Turboneger, DumDum Boys, Motorpsycho, D'Sound and Bigbang.  Career  Eick during a concert in Eidsfoss, Norway, 2002. After finishing high school, he started on the Music program at the Toneheim Folkeh√∏yskole near by Hamar, followed by studies on the Jazz program at Trondheim Musikkonsevatorium. Born in 1979 Eick has marvellous range of achievements to show for himself: in 2007 he won the International Jazz Talent, awarded to him by the International Jazz Festivals Organization situated in New York. He then won the Statoil Scholarship in 2009, undoubtedly the largest scholarship in Norway, as he was heading for the release of his second album on one of the worlds most influential jazz record labels, ECM. In the meantime Eick keeps himself busy participating on several albums playing either trumpet, double bass, vibraphone, piano, guitar, or in his own words ‚Äúanything needed.‚Äù Some of his collaborators have been, among a vast amount of others, Trondheim Jazz Orchestra and Chick Corea, Iro Haarla, Manu Katch√© and Jacob Young. Eick is also a member of the Norwegian genre-defying group Jaga Jazzist, a group with which he has performed for many years. In the summer of 2006 he toured with Jan Gunnar Hoff Group and Mike Stern and in October/November on European tour with Thomas Dybdahl. Eicks band is currently a five-piece, featuring two drummers, bass, piano and Eick himself. The lineup changes invariably as all the participating musicians are amongst Norways finest, but for the most part the band consists of Andreas Ulvo (piano), Torstein Lofthus and Gard Nilssen (drums), and Audun Erlien (bass). The music is composed by Eick and pays tribute to both the truly unique Scandinavian soundscape, as well as the lyricism and melancholy of the Canadian trumpeter Kenny Wheeler. In 2013 Eick appeared at the North Sea Jazz Festival within his own Quintet including Andreas Ulvo (piano, Fender Rhodes, keyboards, electronics), Audun Erlien (bass), Andreas Bye & Kenneth Kapstad (drums).

It occurred on the island of Kosrae and perhaps on Ponape in the south-western Pacific which belong both to the Caroline Islands. Its preferred habitat were coastal swamps and marshland covered with taro plants (Colocasia esculenta).  Description  It was discovered in 1827 by Heinrich von Kittlitz. Von Kittlitz described its plumage as general black with bluish gloss. The quills were more brownish. The chin and the middle of the throat were brown. The surface of its tail were brownish-black. The undertail coverts exhibit white spots. The inner wing coverts were brownish and were spotted with white. The outer edged of the first primary was dull brown. Eyes, legs and feet had a reddish hue. The bill was black. Its size was about 18 cm. Controversial data exists as to its ability to fly. X-ray measurements of the Carpometacarpii lead to the assumption that it was flightless. However its native name nay- tay-mai-not which means \\"the one who lands in the taro plot\\" might imply that the ability to fly was present.David Day (1981). The Doomsday Book of Animals, p. 87, Ebury Press, London,  Extinction  The Kosrae crake is only known by two specimens taken by von Kittlitz in December 1827 in the swamps of Kosrae. The two skins are now in the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg. The story of its extinction is similar to the vanishing of the Kosrae starling (another extinct species from Kosrae). Even in 1828 von Kittlitz described this bird as uncommon. German ornithologist Otto Finsch failed to find this bird on his expedition in 1880 and also the Whitney South Seas Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History in 1931 remained unsuccessful on a survey after that species. They became apparently victims of rats which had overrun Kosrae after they were able to escape from missionary and whaling vessels which were careened on the beach of Kosrae.

Career He studied art at Columbia University and New York's Master Institute of Arts in 1937-1939, and was a practicing artist, partially subsidized by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation until 1942. He returned to New York in 1945 after serving in the United States Coast Guard to study art and philosophy at Cornell University, receiving his BFA in January 1949, and his Ph.D in September 1951. He spent two years at the University of Michigan as a Research assistant, in the Language and Symbolism Project, and as an Instructor, before taking a post as instructor at Harvard University, becoming an Assistant Professor, in 1954. He remained at Harvard until 1959, taking two periods of leave; to study at Oxford University in 1955, and to teach at Princeton University in 1958. From 1959 until 1964 he was Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Between 1962-1963 he studied in Rome on a Guggenheim Fellowship. From 1964-1968 he was a Professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and from 1968-1970 was a Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago before settling at the University of North Carolina as William Rand Kenan Jr. Professor from 1970 until 1988 (Professor Emeritus until 2003.) The \\"Robert Paul Ziff Distinguished Professorship\\" was established at University of North Carolina in 1994. He died in 2003. Philosophical and other works =Articles= Paul Ziff started publishing in graduate school in 1949, doing book reviews for The Philosophical Review. He kept on publishing for 41 years, his last article appearing in 1990 in a special issue of the European journal Dialectica. No doubt he was asked to contribute a paper to that issue since it was dedicated - both the issue and his paper - to the memory of his former teacher at Cornell, Max Black. Ziff published six books, 38 articles, five discussions, and 14 reviews. His first four books were published by Cornell University Press; his last two were published by Reidel. When he published with Cornell, it was one of the best university presses for philosophy. He moved to Reidel in the 1980s because their managing editor, Jaakko Hintikka, offered to accept two of his book-length manuscripts and publish them as consecutive volumes in the Synthese Library series. Ziff's articles appeared most often in The Philosophical Review, Mind, The Journal of Philosophy, Analysis, and Foundations of Language (which became Studies in Language sometime in the late 70s). He was invited to contribute to various conference proceedings and collections, and fifteen of his articles and discussions appeared in these - some of them high-profile collections in their area at the time, including Katz and Fodor's The Structure of Language (1964) and Harman and Davidson‚Äôs Semantics of Natural Language (1972). Most of Ziff‚Äôs articles (29) show up in his books. One that did not, \\"About Proper Names\\" from Mind, was selected as one of the best philosophy articles of 1977 and reprinted in The Philosopher‚Äôs Annual. Ziff published mainly in the areas of philosophy of language, philosophy of art, philosophy of mind, and epistemology, but also had articles in philosophy of religion and ethics. He even had three about Wittgenstein‚Äôs views, and one about his own take on philosophy. \\"Art and the 'Object of Art'\\" was originally in Mind in 1951, and takes apart the claim, made by prominent philosophers in the 1930s-1950s, that \\"the painting is not the work of art.\\" This paper is reprinted in other places as well, notably William Elton's famous collection Aesthetics and Language, which put aestheticians on notice that the analytics had shown up to clean house. \\"The Task of Defining a Work of Art\\" has been anthologized at least three times. It is the most sophisticated of the \\"you can‚Äôt define art\\" papers in the apply- Wittgenstein/ordinary language analysis years. \\"Reasons in Art Criticism\\" was in the two best aesthetics anthologies of the 60s, the ones edited by Kennick and by Margolis. It was also in the Bobbs-Merrill Reprint Series in Philosophy, which was a selection of the most talked about articles in the 50s and 60s. George Dickie devoted a chapter of his book Evaluating Art to Ziff's view about reasons why a work of art is good, and, 30 years after it was first published, he said it \\"remains one of the few truly stimulating pieces by present-day philosophers on the theory of art evaluation.\\" Many students know Paul Ziff from the philosophy of mind papers in Philosophic Turnings. \\"The Feelings of Robots\\", in which Ziff argued with his typical panache that robots could not have feelings, has attracted the most attention: viz., replies, reprintings, and inclusion on course reading lists. It went from Analysis in 1959, along with replies by Jack and Ninian Smart, to Alan Ross Anderson‚Äôs volume Minds and Machines in 1964, which was part of Prentice Hall‚Äôs Contemporary Perspectives in Philosophy Series, and the first \\"can machines think\\" collection. People who have written on this topic, such as Keith Gunderson, invariably bring up Ziff's short paper. It eventually showed up in introductory anthologies as well. \\"About Behaviorism\\", another Analysis paper, discusses two bad arguments against philosophical behaviorism in order to show the difference between, as Vere Chappell put it, crude and refined behaviorism. Chappell included this paper in his anthology The Philosophy of Mind, which came out in 1962 and was the first collection of readings on that area of philosophy. \\"The Simplicity of Other Minds\\" comes from The Journal of Philosophy. It was originally an invited symposium paper at the American Philosophical Association‚Äôs Eastern Division meeting in 1965. The commentators were Sydney Shoemaker and Alvin Plantinga. Ziff went at the other minds problem by taking it as a question about picking the best explanatory hypothesis. According to Hilary Putnam, Ziff was extending the \\"empirical realist reply to skepticism.\\" In his 21-page paper about Ziff's view, \\"Other Minds\\" (1972), Putnam discussed both Ziff's argument and his commentators‚Äô criticisms, and said that he and Ziff were in \\"essential agreement\\" on how to solve the other minds problem, and in \\"common disagreement with the modish treatment in terms of\\" criteria, analogies, and language learning. \\"Understanding Understanding\\" came out in 1972, Ziff's second year at UNC. It has eight papers, all of them concerned with what had now become his main topic in the philosophy of language: viz., \\"how one understands what is said.\\" He had, to some extent, written about this in his previous book, where three essays took up how to handle deviant, ungrammatical, and ambiguous utterances. Ziff was, before cognitive science came around the bend, virtually the only one working on how people really speak. Claims about truth conditions, reference, and speech acts were the center of attention back then. As I put it in my review in Metaphilosophy, \\"lacking in both current linguistic theory and philosophy of language is any useful conception of how people talk\\". \\"Understanding Understanding\\" began to develop such a conception, factor by relevant factor. Zeno Vendler said that \\"in spite of Ziff‚Äôs own modest assessment of the results, it still represents the most interesting, and most important, recent work on the problem of understanding speech\\". Two essays are criticisms, taking on Grice‚Äôs original attempt to connect what a sentence means and what a speaker intends, and then Quine‚Äôs concept of stimulus meaning. The former was first in Analysis, the latter in The Philosophical Review. A. J. Ayer thought the paper on Grice was one of the better critical pieces he had read in a number of years. The reviewer for Philosophia was discouraged \\"to find later elaborations of Grice‚Äôs theory (e.g., Schiffer‚Äôs) failing to respond to this essay originally published in 1967\\". Two essays are about how natural languages differ from formal languages, and how one should view talk about the logical structure of English sentences, which was in vogue then, in large part because of the hoopla about Chomskyan deep structures and a new interest (√† la Davidson, Montague, and Parsons) in event sentences and indirect discourse. In \\"Understanding\\", Ziff presented an analytical data processing-systematic synthesis view of understanding what people say. The most important chapters - \\"What Is Said\\", \\"There‚Äôs More To Seeing Than Meets the Eye\\", and \\"Something About Conceptual Schemes\\" - are about, in their various ways, how levels of abstraction are involved in understanding what people say, as with Ziff's famous example of someone saying that a cheetah can outrun a man. Ziff was the first philosopher to appreciate this phenomenon. =Books= Semantic Analysis came out in 1960, and by 1967 it had gone through five printings in hardbound and was also appearing in paperback. The book goes back to Ziff's work in aesthetics. As far back as graduate school, he was thinking about the reasons why a work of art is either good or bad, and so he was interested in determining what the phrase 'good painting' means. From there, he went on to determine what the word 'good' means in English: viz., \\"answering to certain interests\\". And then all the way to \\"an informal introduction to and sketch of a rigorous semantic theory\\" that would be adequate for \\"determining a method and a means of evaluating and choosing between competing analyses of words and utterances\\". In short, for confirming claims that a word had this meaning or that, like the word 'good'. This \\"sketch\\" did not strike everyone as all that informal since he ends up at a set of conditions under which a morphological element has meaning in English, and it does so, for openers, in terms of the distributive and contrastive sets for the element. Semantic Analysis stared down, as it were, questions of meaning more seriously than any previous philosophy book. It brought ideas from structural linguistics (even some from the new generative grammars) right into philosophers‚Äô discussions of what this or that word means with the goal of actually coming to a conclusion that could be sensibly defended. Some philosophers did not like getting this real (e.g., G. E. M. Anscombe, not surprisingly). Others did. Paul Benacerraf pointed out how it was \\"the first systematic attempt to write on these questions\\", and Jerrold Katz called it \\"a pioneer work, in that it is the first to propose an empirically based theory of meaning to deal systematically with the various topics that are part of the subject of meaning, and to attempt to fit such a theory into the larger framework of structural linguistics\\". William Alston said that \\"future progress in semantics may go through Ziff‚Äôs book, or it may recoil from it in another direction. But to ignore it will be impossible\\". Jonathan Cohen said, back in the early 60s, the last chapter \\"is one of the best discussions of the word 'good' that has ever been published\\". It still is, forty years later. In a recent survey of the past fifty years of philosophy, Hilary Putnam makes a point of mentioning how important Semantic Analysis was, and remarks that the \\"Ziffian image of meanings as a recursive system\\" became part of \\"all of our philosophical vocabularies\\" in the early 60s, along with Chomsky's ideas about recursive syntactic structures. The \\"our\\" here refers to the young analytic philosophers, principally on the East coast, and specifically then at Princeton. Putnam adds, in a footnote, all of today's graduate students should also realize that it was Ziff, and not Donald Davidson, who came up with the recursive idea in semantic analysis. Semantic Analysis holds a record for Ziff's six books. It received the longest review, going 18 pages in Language in 1962. Antiaesthetics is in second place. The review in the Canadian Journal of Philosophy (1987) is 15 pages long, and explained many features of Antiaesthetics. The book had two big topics, and Ziff wrote in a more traditionally sustained and explicit way about one of them, anti-art and its spin-off, anti-aesthetics. It took him back to defining art ‚Äì what counts as art ‚Äì and what to say about new things that lacked features of previous art. Ziff thought they could be art, even if they involved \\"the total rejection of present aspects of art\\". More generally, he thought \\"anything that can be viewed is a fit object for aesthetic attention\\", and none is \\"more fit than others\\". The second big topic was not entirely new for Ziff either. It had shown up, for example, in Understanding Understanding, and I called it in my review in Metaphilosophy, \\"a moral concerning limitations of analysis\\", and asked if it meant that analyzing things wouldn‚Äôt help you understand what is said, or if you simply can‚Äôt analyze the complexities. Ziff repeatedly discussed this in Antiaesthetics, and he remarked, and illustrated essay by essay, that we don‚Äôt have and may never have good analyses - standard necessary and sufficient conditions, the philosopher's effective procedures or algorithms - for understanding one thing after another about art. He wrote about this again in his paper \\"Remarks About Judgements, Painters, and Philosophers\\", which appeared in 1987 in The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism. J. M. Hanson, his second book (from 1962) is not a philosophy book. Hanson was an English painter who came to Cornell as a professor of art in 1945 when he was 45 years old. He was Paul Ziff's teacher during his B.F.A. degree years, and this book has one color and 32 black-and-white plates of Hanson's paintings (oil on canvas). Ziff introduced the plates with an essay about Hanson's background and style. He called Hanson an \\"English Romantic\\" who worked in \\"the tradition of cubism and geometric abstraction\\" to produce \\"images of clarity\\" that were \\"neither rough nor loud\\" nor large like fashionable works from, say, abstract expressionists. Philosophic Turnings appeared in 1966, went through a number of printings in hardback, and was translated into Italian in 1969. It is subtitled \\"Essays in Conceptual Appreciation\\", includes 13 papers (12 previously published), and has some of Ziff's classic papers from the period 1951-1966, especially about art and mental issues. It starts with, as Helen Cartwright put it in her review, \\"Ziff‚Äôs quite substantial work in aesthetics\\". Paul Ziff was one of the few philosophers in the past fifty years - you can count them on one hand - who had a name both inside and outside of aesthetics. As one reviewer said, he is \\"one of the more provocative thinkers in the field of aesthetics today, and has helped to re-establish the status of aesthetics in philosophy by introducing a new series of questions in the arts\\". Epistemic Analysis came out with Reidel in 1984, but Ziff started it back in 1962 when he was in Rome for the year on a Guggenheim Fellowship. He stalled well into the manuscript, and didn‚Äôt start writing again until the early 1980s. The book has a subtitle: \\"A Coherence Theory of Knowledge\\". Most of it was never published before. It only contains material from two published papers, one in Linguistics and Philosophy on coherence, and one in Studies in Language on reference. Epistemic Analysis goes at the word 'know' like Semantic Analysis went at the word 'good', and it may be, to use Jonathan Cohen's line, one of the best discussions of 'know' that has been published. Gilbert Harman called it a \\"brilliant, difficult book\\", \\"rich with insights about the passive construction in English, reference, hypostasis, evidence, and many other subjects\\", as well as \\"marvelously written, philosophical poetry\\". Other reviews used words like \\"rich\\", \\"provocative\\", \\"iconoclastic\\", \\"bold\\", \\"subtle, interesting, inventive and stylishly written\\", with \\"a fascinating line of anti-skeptical argument\\" from an author of \\"undoubted acumen and insight\\". The book went against the grain and did not extend the usual ideas. It did not have any of the \\"justified, true belief\\" analysis and the search for a fourth condition to patch it up, or talk about varieties of foundationalism, externalism or internalism, let alone the merits of naturalizing. Indeed, Ziff never mentioned Gettier or most of the usual crowd then - say Goldman, Harman, Dretske, Pollock and Unger; a few pages are on Nozick. He maintained that it was senseless to speak about a justified belief, that \\"neither knowledge nor belief either require or can accept justification\\", that you did not need evidence to \\"know that p\\", or need to believe that p, that 'know' is univocal and means, at bottom, you are in a position to know, no matter whether it is knowing that p, how to do something, or knowing a person, that knowing something (or someone) always counts as an increase in \\"global coherence\\" compared to not, and that \\"coherence is a matter of logical structure\\". Ziff's coherence view differs from the other coherentists (Lehrer, BonJour, Rescher). He stated his analysis of the philosopher's favorite, knows that p, like this: \\"one knows that p if and only if p is true, and one is in a position such that, in that position, any possibility of one‚Äôs being in error with respect to the truth of p may be safely discounted\\". This is a fallibilist analysis and Ziff used it to counter skepticism in terms of a technical notion, a safe position, \\"in which the possibility of error may safely be discounted\\". Antiaesthetics was his second book with Reidel, and it also came out in 1984. The book is subtitled \\"An Appreciation of the Cow with the Subtile Nose\\", which refers to Jean Dubuffet‚Äôs painting in the Metropolitan Museum. There is a page-size picture of this painting at the start of the book and Ziff discussed it at length in places. It is an example of what he called \\"antiart\\". The book has eight previously published papers from 1972-1981 and three unpublished ones. \\"The Cow on the Roof\\" was an invited symposium paper at the American Philosophical Association's Eastern Division, and came out in The Journal of Philosophy, along with comments by Kendall Walton and Guy Sircello. It is about the identity of a piece of music and Ziff emphasized the idea that pieces of music have variants. Ziff first wrote on this topic in his critical review of Goodman's \\"Languages of Art\\" in The Philosophical Review (1971). \\"Art and Sociobiology\\" was in Mind in 1981, and was another first: viz., a serious philosopher taking a biological view of aesthetic practices and ideas such as appreciating and intrinsic value. Ziff combined the sociobiology with his notion of \\"aspection\\" and person-act-entity-conditions approach from his early paper, \\"Reasons in Art Criticism\\". Other papers were invited for conferences and their proceedings - on sports, dance, Wittgenstein, and literature - and a Reidel festschrift. One appeared in a book about philosophy along with similar papers by Ayer, Feyerabend, Popper, and Quine, among others. One chapter, \\"Anything Viewed\\", was reprinted in an Oxford Reader in aesthetics in 1997.

Biography Conforte came of a family of scholars. His early instructors were rabbis Hayyim Shabbethai, Israel Ze'evi, Judah Girasi and Baruch Angel. As a young man, he studied the Kabbala under R. Jefeth the Egyptian, and philosophy under R. Levi Pasriel. His chief teachers, however, were Mordecai Kalai and Daniel Estroza. Conforte married a granddaughter of Menahem Lonzano. He journeyed twice to the Land of Israel (then part of Ottoman Syria), once in 1644, alone, and a second time in 1652, when, together with his family, he settled in Jerusalem, founding there a study hall. In 1671, however, he was in Egypt, where he occupied the position of dayan. He is also known to have been in Smyrna. Kore ha-Dorot Conforte's chief work is a literary chronicle now known by the title ·∏≤ore ha-Dorot, which contains the names of all the teachers and writers from the close of the Talmud up to his own day. This chronicle is divided into three parts, the first two of which, referring to the time before the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, are very short. The third part is divided into eleven generations, and is not systematically arranged. Conforte used all the earlier historical works, such as Abraham ibn Daud's Sefer ha-·∏≤abbalah, Zacuto's Yu·∏•asin, and Yahyah's Shalshelet ha-·∏≤abbalah, especially the first mentioned, from which he cites whole passages. He also gathered material from various printed and manuscript responsa, and was the first to collect the names mentioned in these works. His chronicle is valuable for the literary history of the Jews in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, especially in Turkey, Italy, Africa, and the near East. Probably it was composed in Egypt, about the year 1683, if Cassel's conjecture be correct. Conforte was a mere compiler, and at times his data are contradictory. The original manuscript was brought from Egypt by R. David Ashkenazi of Jerusalem, who, to judge from a note in his preface, gave it the title ·∏≤ore ha-Dorot, and had it printed in Venice in 1746, without mentioning the name of the author. This poor edition has been critically reedited, and supplied with notes and index, by David Cassel (Berlin, 1846), who follows the pagination of the first edition. Conforte also wrote a volume of responsa, of the fate of which, however, nothing is known. Gabriel Conforto, a Turkish Talmudist who is mentioned in the responsa literature of the seventeenth century, was probably a son of David Conforte.

Early life Wainwright was born in New York City, the son of Carroll Livingston Wainwright (1899‚Äì1967) and Edith Catherine Gould (d. 1937), daughter of financier George Jay Gould (1864-1923) and Edith M. Kingdon (1864-1921). His siblings were Carroll L. Wainwright Jr. (1925‚Äì2016) and Caroline Wainwright (d. 1969), and his paternal grandparents were Stuyvesant Wainwright (d. 1975) and Caroline Smith Snowden. His grandmother later married Carl F. Wolff. He was a great-nephew of General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright (1883‚Äì1953), a four star-general who was the hero of Bataan and commander of the U.S. forces in the Philippines during World War II. His uncle, Loudon Wainwright, was the father of Loudon Wainwright Jr. (his cousin), and the grandfather of Loudon Wainwright III, the singer and songwriter, himself the father of Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, and Lucy Wainwright Roche. In 1927, his family moved to East Hampton, New York where they built an imposing house called \\"Gulf Crest,\\" that was valued at $350,000 in 1937. His parents divorced in 1932 and his mother married Sir Hector MacNeal, the Scottish shipowner. He attended the Westminster School, Simsbury, Connecticut and, later, graduated from Yale Law School in 1947. Career On January 30, 1942, at the age of 20, he left Yale and enlisted as a private in the United States Army. He attended officers candidate school and on December 30, 1943, went overseas during World War II. He rose through the ranks, and was commanding officer of Office of Strategic Services, a wartime intelligence agency during World War II that was a predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency. He returned to the U.S. on June 10, 1945, and spent the last three months of his service as adviser on intelligence coordination in the War Department in Washington, D.C. He was honorably discharged as a Captain from the Army on December 13, 1945. After the War, he served in the Active Army Reserve, and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1960.

Often called \\" Glancy\\" he was a top adviser on Democratic Party affairs to his close friend James Buchanan, especially when President-elect Buchanan was picking his cabinet in 1856-1857. After he was defeated for reelection, Buchanan appointed him Ambassador to the Austrian Empire. Biography J. Glancy Jones was born in Caernarvon Township, Pennsylvania. He attended Kenyon College, studied theology and was ordained to the ministry of the Episcopal Church in 1835 and withdrew in 1841. He later studied law, was admitted to the bar in Georgia in 1841 and commenced practice at Easton, Pennsylvania. He was district attorney for Berks County, Pennsylvania, from 1847 to 1849. He was a delegate to the Democratic State conventions in 1848, 1849, and 1855, and served as president in 1855. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1848 and 1856 and served as vice president in 1848. Jones was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-second Congress. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1852. He was elected to the Thirty-third Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Henry A. Muhlenberg.

After his service he resumed the practice of law, and died in Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1878. Interment in Reading's Charles Evans Cemetery. In terms of his legacy to American history, biographer Michael Todd Landis states: :Leading Northern Democrats such as Jones and Buchanan were not romantic defenders of working men, as some scholars have claimed; nor were they moderates striving to save the Union from extreme sectionalism. Rather, they were proslavery activists whose willful actions had direct and disastrous effects on the nation. Their policies enraged free-state voters and caused the fatal split in the Democratic Party that resulted in Lincoln‚Äôs election, which, in turn, triggered disunion. They were culpable and responsible‚Äîa fact that should not be forgotten or overlooked.Landis, 2016  Notes and references  Sources *The Political Graveyard Category:1811 births Category:1878 deaths Category:Burials at Charles Evans Cemetery Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania Category:Pennsylvania lawyers Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Austria Category:19th-century American Episcopalians Category:Kenyon College alumni Category:19th-century American diplomats Category:Pennsylvania Democrats Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Jehu Glancy Jones"},{"id":"7651507","text":"The Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS), located in Seville, Spain, is one of the seven institutes of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), a Directorate-General of the European Commission (EC).

The company manufactured textile machinery and were iron founders and colliery proprietors. By the end of the 19th century, the company had become the largest textile machinery manufacturer in the world, employing more than 12,000 workers. Companies Booth House at Werneth, former headquarters of Platt Brothers Hartford Works Henry Platt was a blacksmith who in 1770 was manufacturing carding equipment, in Dobcross, Saddleworth, to the east of Oldham. His grandson, also Henry founded a similar business in Uppermill. In 1820, the grandson, Henry Platt moved to Huddersfield Road, Oldham and re-established his business there. He and Elijah Hibbert formed a partnership Hibbert and Platt. When his sons, Joseph and John joined the company, it was renamed Hibbert Platt and Sons. Henry Platt died in 1842 and Elijah Hibbert in 1854. All the shares went to the Platt family and the company became Platt Brothers & Company. In 1844 Platt Brothers acquired the Hartford New Works in the Werneth area of Oldham. In 1868, they moved their headquarters from the 'Old Works' to the 'New Works' and took on limited liability status. When John Platt died in 1872 the company employed 7,000 men and had established itself as the world's largest textile machinery manufacturer.Platt Collection National Archives In the 1890s it was estimated that the works supported 42% of Oldham's population. Platts owned the Jubilee Colliery in Crompton and Butterworth Hall Colliery in Milnrow. During World War I the company produced munitions, but afterwards resumed textile machinery manufacture and continued to expand. 1922 was a year of record profits and the firm became a public limited company. In 1929 Platt Brothers employed 12000 people, and the New Works covered . In 1931, the company took a controlling interest in Textile Machinery Makers Ltd, which had been formed from other textile machine manufactures including Asa Lees & Co Ltd. The company name changed to Platt Bros.(Holdings) Ltd. Platt Bros.(Sales) Ltd was spun off in 1946, when Sir Kenneth Preston joined the company from J.Stone Ltd. Platt International was formed in 1970 from the textile division of Stone Platt, and it acquired the Saco Lowell Corporation in 1973 and became Platt-Saco-Lowell in 1975. The Oldham premises closed in the early 1980s. The drawings and rights to the Platt Ginning Machines are owned by HSL Engineering in Leeds West Yorkshire. Products Jacquard Loom manufactured by Platt Brothers of Oldham. Loom is on display at Queen Street Mill Textile Museum, Harle Syke, Burnley. Textile manufacturing involves converting of three types of fibre into yarn, then fabric, then textiles. These are then fabricated into clothes or other artifacts. Cotton was the most important natural fibre, but there was a sizeable Worsted industry in neighbouring West Yorkshire. Cotton was harvested, ginned and transported Britain in bales. At the factories the bales were broken open, the fibres were willowed and scutched before being carded. The carded fibres were combed, drawn, slubbed and roved before they were ready to be spun. Spinning was done on a spinning mule. Before mechanisation each process was done by hand, but as 19th progressed mechanization was introduced. From 1857, Platts supplied the complete range of spinning and weaving machinery. It surpassed Dobson & Barlow of Bolton in size in 1854. Platts constructed looms for export from 1857. Platts introduced successive models of carding machines, roving frames and self-acting mules in 1868, 1886 and 1900. The self-acting mule was the basis of the company's success being faster, longer and more productive than those of their rivals. Workmen in Platts became shareholders in the Oldham Limiteds mills on the late 1860s ensuring Platt machinery was purchased. After a record year in 1896, the company faced competition from new ring spinning frames, an alternative technology suited to coarse counts. Their competitors were Howard & Bullough of Accrington and Tweedales and Smalley of Rochdale. Platts also supplied plans for mills and the fitters to install them. History Shortly before the First World War the company reached its peak, with its workforce numbering more than 15,000 people, and Hartford Works at Werneth covering more than of land was the largest employer in Oldham and the largest maker of cotton- processing machinery in Lancashire and the world. The works were visited by George V and Queen Mary on the first day of their eight-day 1913 Royal Tour of Lancashire on 7 July 1913. In later years the company's fortunes mirrored those of the Lancashire cotton industry, and the company began a slow, decline. The company's home market gradually disappeared as large numbers of Lancashire cotton mills began to close, and in export markets the company faced tough competition from foreign companies. The end of its Oldham operations came in 1982 when the company closed its factory. Having been taken over in the 1960s, Platt Saco Lowell had grave financial problems, and was put into administration by its parent company, Hollingsworth.Hollingsworth unit put on block; Platt Saco Lowell has been operating in the red. (John D. Hollingsworth on Wheels) Daily News Record The Platt name (and support for Platt products) continues.Platt company history A link between Platt Brothers and the Toyota company of Japan was made in 1929 when the company paid ¬£100,000 for the patent rights for an innovative automatic weaving loom designed by Sakichi Toyoda. The Toyoda Model G loom had mechanical sensors that automatically shut down the loom if a warp thread snapped. The thinking behind this feature was jidoka which translates as automation with a human touch. Workers were freed from monitoring automatic looms and mill owners achieved a dramatic increase in labour productivity with one worker able to operate up to 30 machines. Money from the sale of rights provided the start-up capital for the Toyota automobile endeavour. The name change was done for phonetic reasons so although Toyota is now best known as an automotive company, it began as Toyoda the textile machinery manufacturer.1867‚Äì1929  History - TOYOTA INDUSTRIES CORPORATION Politics John Platt (1817 ‚Äì 1872), was Oldham's leading Liberal. He successfully campaigned, in the 1840s, for a municipal charter for Oldham. He was a strong supporter of the Anti Corn Law League. His advocacy of free trade and business knowledge led him to visit Paris with Richard Cobden to assist in the negotiations of the French Commercial Treaty.Public Monument and Sculpture Association National Recording Project Statue Statue by Stevenson, David Watson 1878 He was elected the first Mayor of Oldham in 1854, an office he held twice more in 1855‚Äì56, and 1861‚Äì62. John Platt also served as Member of Parliament for Oldham from 1865 until his death in 1872. Platt's younger brother James Platt (1824‚Äì1857), helped build the firm and was active in promoting working-class adult education in Oldham, especially the Oldham Lyceum, he was elected MP for Oldham in 1857, but died the same year.

Biography  Founded in late 2004 with no intention to record an album, La Coka Nostra was more a loose collective of artists connected through Danny Boy than a group. Having taken time off from rap after the break-up of House of Pain, Danny Boy took to working in video production and fashion as well as mentoring other artists. He met Slaine in Boston and, impressed with his writing, brought him to L.A. to record some tracks. Eventually it turned into more of a group effort including the former members of House of Pain and Ill Bill, as well as associates from Psycho Realm, Special Teamz and others.HHDX Interview, HipHopDX Interview with Danny Boy It was not until early 2006 that an actual line up solidified. Plans to release an album were first voiced later the same year.Urb Magazine Interview , Urb Magazine Interview with Everlast. In late 2008, the group signed to Suburban Noize Records and released the long delayed debut album A Brand You Can Trust on July 14, 2009. The album took so long to complete due to Danny Boy's refusal to have the members collaborate via e-mail; instead, he would gather everyone at the studio. This took time due to the recording of Ill Bill and Everlast's solo albums as well as various tours and other commitments. A Brand You Can Trust features fifteen tracks and guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Bun B, Sick Jacken, B-Real, Sen Dog, Immortal Technique, Big Left and Q-Unique. Though similar stylistically to the group's prior online releases, it features songs grounded more in reality. Subjects touched upon include politics, death, drug addiction, raising a child and terrorism. On March 2, 2012, it was announced that Everlast would be leaving La Coka Nostra due to his daughter's medical issues.

Nural has been between labels for quite some time now and the release of their second album, Entitlement, has been up in the air. Nural posted a blog on their Myspace on February 3, 2009 stating that they are releasing their album on DownloadPunk.com digitally. They're still working on album and art and a book for their official release. Nural released Entitlement B-Sides on September 14, 2010 on iTunes. Their music also appeared on the soundtrack to the Discovery Channel movie, Drift: The Sideways Craze. Nural unofficially broke up in 2009 after a legal battle with their management. Several of the members have moved on to different projects. Most noticeably, Kyle Castellani has released a solo album in 2011 and continues to write music for other artists. On January 1, 2012 it was announced on Nural's Facebook page that they were working on an album that was supposed to be released in 2012, but on April 26, 2013 they stated that they had every intention of releasing a new album, but due to each band member having different projects that they were working on, a new album was not in the cards for any of the members. On October 3, 2013, a tweet was sent out to a fan in regards as to whether or not they are still working on music and they had stated that they are currently not working on any music in the foreseeable future, further confirming that the band has dissolved.

It was written by Michael St Aubyn and published by Micro Power. It was reissued as the lead game of Superior Software / Acornsoft's Play It Again Sam 5 compilation in 1988 when it was also converted for the Acorn Electron. It is a platform game featuring puzzles. Gameplay The player takes the role of a wizard named Imogen who, according to the back-story,for a detailed description of the backstory, see http://8bs.com/elecgame/imogen.htm lost his mind and forgot his identity as a result of transforming himself into a dragon to save his town from another dragon. He is placed into a dungeon within a mountain and in order to escape he must use magic and puzzle-solving abilities. The upshot is that he will only be able to free himself once he is back to his old, sane self and no longer a danger to the townsfolk. Imogen in Wizard form (BBC Micro) The game features sixteen levels which are played in a random order. To complete a level, Imogen needs to obtain a spell fragment which will warp him to the next level or, after all sixteen have been collected and the spell completed, to the outside world, thus completing the game. The spell fragments are always placed somewhere inaccessible at the outset of the level, and obtaining the spell fragments requires some lateral thinking on behalf of the player. Imogen himself is able to transform into three different forms, each with an ability unavailable to the other two: * His natural form as a human wizard, which can use various objects he picks up along the way (which are as varied as a revolver, watering can and tulip bulb.) * A cat, which can leap long distances * A monkey, which can climb ropes * A bird, which can fly (available only in one particular level) Each level (consisting of a sealed cavern four screens in size) requires transforming back and forth between the forms to complete it. While it is impossible for the player to actually die during the game, the number of transformations is limited to 150, and using them all before the game is complete renders it unwinnable. Imogen has cartoon-style graphics, with many of the non-player characters being cute versions of animals like rabbits, monkeys, parrots and frogs. One recurring character is a baby-like imp who impedes the progress of the player and is usually dispatched in a terminal way.

Background and training A painter in the classical tradition, Ramsay was born in London of Scottish descent. He was related to the Scottish artists Allan Ramsay (1713‚Äì1784) and James Ramsay (1759‚Äì1854). Towards the end of World War II, he served in the RAF, and in 1952 he made a model of the State Coach which was, exceptionally, accepted by HM Queen Elizabeth II. This model coach was built as part of an exhibition undertaken in collaboration with Clothilde Highton GMC (Guild of Memorial Craftsmen), an Australian painter and sculptor living in Arundel, Sussex between 1946 and 1952, whose husband, an officer of the Royal Navy, had been killed in WWII. (The late) Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk gave Clothilde and Dennis the use of a room in Arundel Castle in which to carry out their work. His formal training included reading Architecture at University College London and three years‚Äô study in Florence (1953‚Äì1955) as a pupil of Pietro Annigoni (1910‚Äì1988), the internationally renowned grande maestro portrait painter of the 20th century (Annigoni subsequently became a godfather to Ramsay's younger son, Justin). Media and technique Ramsay's training included drawing, both in pencil and in china ink, as well as water colour. However, much of his time as a pupil of Annigoni involved oil tempera (or tempera grassa, i.e. egg-oil) ‚Äì originally a 16th-century technique which entails meticulous time consuming work and which was revived in Italy during the 1930s by Dr Nikolai Lokoff (–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∏—á –õ–æ—Ö–æ–≤ 1872‚Äì1948 ), an exiled Russian industrial chemist and amateur painter. With the egg acting as an emulsifier, the technique allows water to be mixed with the paint thereby enabling the production of ultra-fine subtle glazes. However, as the paint is not commercially available, the artist must mix his own colours using pigment powders, oil, varnish, egg yolk and a preservative; uniquely, Ramsay discovered that Scotch whisky is an excellent preservative for the egg in the oil tempera mix! The result is work of permanence and colours that seem to glow with clarity and vitality. For all but the largest pictures his oil tempera works are painted on wooden panels, usually prepared with a heavy-duty paper lining glued to the panel. The survival after 500 years of early Flemish paintings with all their glorious luminous quality bears testament to the permanence of oil tempera as a medium. The process also involves the production of a ‚Äòcartoon‚Äô in pencil which is then transferred to the panel. Range of work Of his first one-man show in London in 1955, The art critic of The Times described Ramsay's work as ‚Äúbeyond reproach‚Äù. During the intervening years he has covered a vast field of subjects ranging from a 9 x 6 ft painting of The Resurrection to a 3 x 2in study of a leaf described by one critic as ‚Äúeasily mistaken for a Ruskin‚Äù - it has long been acknowledged that his still life paintings bear comparison with the Dutch and Flemish masters of the 15-17 th centuries. Though his still life and religious work is highly figurative, he does not treat that as an end in itself, but rather as a means of expressing more clearly a wide range of subjects and emotions ‚Äì from the simple faith of a peasant's humble shrine to a piece of fruit, or the innocence of a child in his drawings. In 1965 the Church Times described his treatment of the great religious themes as being ‚Äúpainted with extraordinary technical accomplishment in terms relevant to the present age, but of deep spirituality‚Äù. More recently he was described by the prominent Australian art dealer, Tom Silver, as being ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the best living still life artist in Australia in old master technique. In fact, there are only a few living artists worldwide who are capable to produce this class.‚Äù In 2004 Martin Gallon, the British fine art expert, commented ‚ÄúHis close attention to detail is reminiscent of the work of the Pre-Raphaelites whose principal aim was to paint from nature as closely as possible; in Ramsay's work, one can see resonances of this aim, yet its simplistic beauty and close observation challenges our senses. These are restful images and their quality demands respect: the message is one of enjoyment. To convey an enjoyment of our natural surroundings and the delicacies of nature is very much Ramsay's mantra ‚Ä¶‚Äù He has painted three Royal portraits: HRH Princess Alexandra (1955), HM King Faisal of Iraq (1957) and HRH Prince Philip (2001), commissioned to celebrate his 80th birthday. Portraits of other notable personalities include Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Robert Menzies and Dame Flora MacLeod of MacLeod (the late 28th Chief of that clan). Today Ramsay combines his still life work with that of his portraiture; the latter still ranges from formal portraits to classical drawings of adults and children. His works are now found in many public and private collections throughout Europe, USA, Canada and Australia, including those of several churches, universities, schools and even banks.

Of the small band of pupils who have studied with him, most notable may be Helen de Borchgrave who went on to train with Professor Ruhemann, Chief Restorer of the National Gallery, London; since 1968 she has cleaned and restored oil paintings for museums, churches, institutions and private owners. Helen is a member of the Association of International Art Critics and has contributed articles to many prominent publications; her first book A Journey into Christian Art was published in 1999. However, Ramsay considers that his greatest triumph was the complete conversion of one Henry Campbell. Henry was a ‚Äúqualified Art master‚Äù of fourteen years‚Äô standing, teaching and practising abstract art; under Ramsay's guidance he became devoted to the unpretentious, but rewarding path of honest painting and drawing.

Villalonga was a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. In the army, he rose to the rank of lieutenant general. He was a member of the council of war and a solicitor in the Kingdom of Majorca. In Madrid, he married his niece Catalina Mar√≠a de Villalonga y de Velasco, daughter of his brother Francisco. In 1708 he was placed in charge of the port and presidio of Callao, Peru. On December 15, 1718 while he was serving as head of the army in Peru, he received the news that he had been named the first official viceroy of the recently created Viceroyalty of New Granada. The new colony included the present-day countries of Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador. Until May 27, 1717, this territory had been part of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Villalonga made a long overland trip to take up his new post, stopping on the way in Quito and Popay√°n. On December 17, 1718, he made a great impression on the inhabitants of Santa Fe de Bogot√° by the great pomp of his formal entrance into the capital. His lifestyle thereafter continued to contrast greatly with the poverty of most of the inhabitants of the city. The viceroy had specific orders to clean up the disorder and corruption rampant among the royal officials of the colony. In 1722 he brought charges against the accountant Domingo de Mena. Nevertheless, his administration was known for its arbitrariness and corruption. Villalonga's instructions also specified that he was to prevent the development of wine-making and textile industries in the colony, in order to protect the Spanish industries from the competition. In November 1720, Spanish forces attacked the long-time Dutch settlement in Tucacas, on the coast of what is now Venezuela. This was a center of the contraband trade. It was largely destroyed by the Spanish, including a synagogue that was located there. In 1721, following orders from the cabinet in Madrid, Villalonga expelled all foreigners, both residents and temporary visitors, not excluding men married to women born in the colony. He took direct control of the treasury. He improved the civil registry and aided in the foundation of the Jesuit college in the city of Santa Fe de Antioquia. Viceroy Villalonga sent repeated recommendations to the Crown to abolish the viceroyalty and reestablish the earlier government under Peru, for the sake of economy. He argued that the colony was too poor to support viceregal government, there being few Spaniards and many Indians within its borders. In September 1723, three years into Villalonga's administration, the King Philip V issued the order to do that. The reunification took effect on May 11, 1724. Villalonga left Bogot√° on May 31 of that year. The two colonies remained reunited until 1740, when the Viceroyalty of New Granada was established once again, this time permanently.

The primary difference is that in the categorical setting one has morphisms that also need indexing. An indexed family of sets is a collection of sets, indexed by a fixed set; equivalently, a function from a fixed index set to the class of sets. A diagram is a collection of objects and morphisms, indexed by a fixed category; equivalently, a functor from a fixed index category to some category. The universal functor of a diagram is the diagonal functor; its right adjoint is the limit of the diagram and its left adjoint is the colimit. The natural transformation from the diagonal functor to some arbitrary diagram is called a cone. Definition Formally, a diagram of type J in a category C is a (covariant) functor The category J is called the index category or the scheme of the diagram D; the functor is sometimes called a J-shaped diagram. The actual objects and morphisms in J are largely irrelevant; only the way in which they are interrelated matters. The diagram D is thought of as indexing a collection of objects and morphisms in C patterned on J. Although, technically, there is no difference between an individual diagram and a functor or between a scheme and a category, the change in terminology reflects a change in perspective, just as in the set theoretic case: one fixes the index category, and allows the functor (and, secondarily, the target category) to vary. One is most often interested in the case where the scheme J is a small or even finite category. A diagram is said to be small or finite whenever J is. A morphism of diagrams of type J in a category C is a natural transformation between functors. One can then interpret the category of diagrams of type J in C as the functor category CJ, and a diagram is then an object in this category. Examples * Given any object A in C, one has the constant diagram, which is the diagram that maps all objects in J to A, and all morphisms of J to the identity morphism on A. Notationally, one often uses an underbar to denote the constant diagram: thus, for any object A in C, one has the constant diagram \\\\underline A. * If J is a (small) discrete category, then a diagram of type J is essentially just an indexed family of objects in C (indexed by J). When used in the construction of the limit, the result is the product; for the colimit, one gets the coproduct. So, for example, when J is the discrete category with two objects, the resulting limit is just the binary product. * If J = ‚àí1 ‚Üê 0 ‚Üí +1, then a diagram of type J (A ‚Üê B ‚Üí C) is a span, and its colimit is a pushout. If one were to \\"forget\\" that the diagram had object B and the two arrows B ‚Üí A, B ‚Üí C, the resulting diagram would simply be the discrete category with the two objects A and C, and the colimit would simply be the binary coproduct. Thus, this example shows an important way in which the idea of the diagram generalizes that of the index set in set theory: by including the morphisms B ‚Üí A, B ‚Üí C, one discovers additional structure in constructions built from the diagram, structure that would not be evident if one only had an index set with no relations between the objects in the index. * Dual to the above, if J = ‚àí1 ‚Üí 0 ‚Üê +1, then a diagram of type J (A ‚Üí B ‚Üê C) is a cospan, and its limit is a pullback. * The index J = 0 \\\\rightrightarrows 1 is called \\"two parallel morphisms\\", or sometimes the free quiver or the walking quiver. A diagram of type J (f,g\\\\colon X \\\\to Y) is then a quiver; its limit is an equalizer, and its colimit is a coequalizer. * If J is a poset category, then a diagram of type J is a family of objects Di together with a unique morphism fij : Di ‚Üí Dj whenever i ‚â§ j. If J is directed then a diagram of type J is called a direct system of objects and morphisms. If the diagram is contravariant then it is called an inverse system. Cones and limits A cone with vertex N of a diagram D : J ‚Üí C is a morphism from the constant diagram Œî(N) to D. The constant diagram is the diagram which sends every object of J to an object N of C and every morphism to the identity morphism on N. The limit of a diagram D is a universal cone to D. That is, a cone through which all other cones uniquely factor. If the limit exists in a category C for all diagrams of type J one obtains a functor which sends each diagram to its limit. Dually, the colimit of diagram D is a universal cone from D. If the colimit exists for all diagrams of type J one has a functor which sends each diagram to its colimit.  Commutative diagrams  Diagrams and functor categories are often visualized by commutative diagrams, particularly if the index category is a finite poset category with few elements: one draws a commutative diagram with a node for every object in the index category, and an arrow for a generating set of morphisms, omitting identity maps and morphisms that can be expressed as compositions. The commutativity corresponds to the uniqueness of a map between two objects in a poset category. Conversely, every commutative diagram represents a diagram (a functor from a poset index category) in this way. Not every diagram commutes, as not every index category is a poset category: most simply, the diagram of a single object with an endomorphism or with two parallel arrows (\\\\bullet \\\\rightrightarrows \\\\bullet; f,g\\\\colon X \\\\to Y) need not commute. Further, diagrams may be impossible to draw (because they are infinite) or simply messy (because there are too many objects or morphisms); however, schematic commutative diagrams (for subcategories of the index category, or with ellipses, such as for a directed system) are used to clarify such complex diagrams.

Led by the ruthless Vril Dox, R.E.B.E.L.S. roster includes among others Strata, Borb Borbb, Stealth and Lobo. An alien telepath, who went by the name of 'Telepath' was unwillingly part of the team. At first Telepath was imprisoned but was later let free and assists the team. Vril Dox's insane, super-smart toddler son had taken over Dox's organization and turned it into a ruthless, brainwashing dictatorship. The group escapes the coup in a semi-sentient ship that literally runs off brain power. Green Lantern, Kyle Rayner, guest-starred in the first issue and was manipulated into killing some of the group's pursuers. Vril would confront his ex-girlfriend Ignea, who wields flame powers and attempts to burn him to death. John Sin, the leader of a criminal organization called the Blood Circle, causes Vril to become addicted to a certain drug without his knowledge. Vril's shipmates believe he has perished until they hear rumours of his existence from a doctor who had come to treat Garv, the injured husband-to-be of Strata. The Blood Circle is taken down and Sin learns Vril simply plans to replicate the drug until he can wean himself off it. Further conflict is caused by Borb Borbb who does not know how to keep his romantic feelings for Stealth appropriately restrained. Captain Comet becomes involved, as he returns to confront what L.E.G.I.O.N. has turned into. The team is forced to fight old friends, such as Zena Moonstruk, Gigantus and Davroth. Behind the scenes, help comes from old ally Marij'n, who fails in his attempt to stop a brainwashing broadcast. The group also encounters the demon Neron. Borbb willingly sacrifices himself to save the group from brain- harvesting extra-dimensional entities. The team then gains the assistance of a guard captain that had been caught up in their adventures.R.E.B.E.L.S. #15 (Jan. 1996) The heroes regain control in the last issue of the series.

It is the only road joining North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania in Russia into South Ossetia, a breakaway republic of Georgia. The road is manned at the town of Nizhny Zaramag in North Ossetia and is sometimes referred to as the Roki-Nizhny Zaramag border crossing.

The other routes between Georgia and Russia include the Kazbegi‚ÄìVerkhni Lars customs checkpoint on the Georgian Military Road, closed June 2006 and reopened 2010, and the Gantiadi‚ÄìAdler crossing in Abkhazia which Georgia asserts functions illegally. The tunnel has been important throughout the Georgian‚ÄìOssetian conflict. The South Ossetian authorities use tolls levied on tunnel traffic as one of their main sources of revenue. The Georgian government, backed by the United States, has long called for the South Ossetian side of the tunnel to be placed under the control of international monitors, rather than by the South Ossetian secessionists and their Russian allies. When the Russian authorities blocked the Kazbegi-Verkhni Lars customs checkpoint between June 2006 and March 2010, the Roki Tunnel was the only available road route from Russia to South Ossetia. The tunnel was also used as a supply route for the Russian troops during the 2008 South Ossetia War. The tunnel was reconstructed due to damage caused by 2008 South Ossetia War. Reconstruction took two and half years and was finished in October 2015. All costs of reconstruction were paid by the Russian side.

Manufacturing techniques include impregnating open-cell polymer foams internally with ceramic slurry and then firing in a kiln, leaving only ceramic material. The foams may consist of several ceramic materials such as aluminium oxide, a common high- temperature ceramic, and gets insulating properties from the many tiny air- filled voids within the material. The foam can be used not only for thermal insulation, but for a variety of other applications such as acoustic insulation, absorption of environmental pollutants, filtration of molten metal alloys, and as substrate for catalysts requiring large internal surface area. It has been used as stiff lightweight structural material, specifically for support of reflecting telescope mirrors.  Properties  Ceramic foams are hardened ceramics with pockets of air or another gas trapped in pores throughout the body of the material. These materials can be fabricated as high as 94 to 96% air by volume with temperature resistances as high as 1700 ¬∞C. Because many ceramics are already oxides or other inert compounds, there is little danger of oxidation or reduction of the material. Previously, pores had been avoided in ceramic components due to their brittle properties. However, in practice ceramic foams have somewhat advantageous mechanical properties compared to bulk ceramics. One example is crack propagation, given by: \\\\sigma_t = 2\\\\sigma\\\\left ( \\\\frac{a}{r} \\\\right )^\\\\frac{1}{2} where œÉt is the stress at the tip of the crack, œÉ is the applied stress, a is the crack size and r is the radius of curvature. For certain stress applications, this means ceramic foams actually outperform bulk ceramics because the porous pockets of air act to blunt the crack tip radius, leading to a disruption of its propagation and a decrease in the likelihood of failure.  Manufacturing  Much like metal foams, there are a number of accepted methods for creating ceramic foams. One of the earliest and still most common is the polymeric sponge method.K. Schwartzwalder and A. V. Somers, Method of Making Porous Ceramic Articles, US Pat. No. 3090094, May 21, 1963 A polymeric sponge is covered with a ceramic in suspension, and after rolling to ensure all pores have been filled, the ceramic-coated sponge is dried and pyrolysed to decompose the polymer, leaving only the porous ceramic structure. The foam must then be sintered for final densification. This method is widely used because it is effective with any ceramic able to be suspended; however, large amounts of gaseous byproducts are released and cracking due to differences in thermal expansion coefficients is common. While the above are both based on the use of a sacrificial template, there are also direct foaming methods that can be used. These methods involve pumping air into a suspended ceramic before setting and sintering. This is difficult because wet foams are thermodynamically unstable and can end up with very large pores after setting. A recent method of creating aluminum oxide foams has also been developed. This technique involves heating crystals with the metal and forming compounds until a solution is created. At this point, polymer chains form and grow, causing the entire mixture to separate into a solvent and polymer. As the mixture begins to boil, air bubbles are trapped in solution and locked in to place as the material is heated and polymer is burned off.  Use  = Insulation = Due to ceramics' extremely low thermal conductivity, the most obvious use of a ceramic is as an insulation material. Ceramic foams are notable in this regard because their composition by very common compounds, such as aluminum oxide, makes them completely harmless, unlike asbestos and other ceramic fibers. Their high strength and hardness also allows them to be used as structural materials for low stress applications. = Electronics = With easily controlled porosities and microstructures, ceramic foams have seen growing use in evolving electronics applications. These applications include electrodes, and scaffolds for solid oxide fuel cells and batteries. Foams can also be used as cooling components for electronics by separating a pumped coolant from the circuits themselves.W. Behrens, A. Tucker. Ceramic foam electronic component cooling. US Pat No 20070247808 A1. October 25, 2007. For this application, silica, aluminum oxide, and aluminum borosilicate fibers can be used. = Pollution Control = Ceramic foams have been proposed as a means of pollutant control, particularly for particulate matter from engines.P. Ciambelli, G. Matarazzo, V. Palma, P. Russo, E. Merlone Borla, and M. F. Pidria. Reduction of soot pollution from automotive diesel engine by ceramic foam catalytic filter. Topics in Ceramics, 42-43. May 2007. They are effective because the voids can capture particulates as well as support a catalyst that can induce oxidation of the captured particulates. Due to the easy means of deposition of other materials within ceramic foams, these oxidation-inducing catalysts can easily be distributed through the entire foam, increasing effectiveness.

It has been outlawed and banned by a Supreme Court court order, but continues to exist in the form of Armed Auxiliary Forces, District Reserve Group and other vigilante groups.alt=On 5 July 2011, the Supreme Court of India in a case filed by Nandini Sundar and others declared the militia to be illegal and unconstitutional, and ordered its disbanding.

History Bastar and Dantewada districts of Chhattisgarh have traditionally been sparsely populated and rich in natural resources but also with some of the poorest tribal regions. The (Naxalites) progressively increased their influence and control among local tribals through a combination of political mobilisation (around poor governance, land rights, livelihood and social inequity) and force.http://planningcommission.gov.in/reports/publications/rep_dce.pdf The first movement against the Naxalites was the 'Jan Jagran Abhiyan', started in 1991 by Mahendra Karma, a local tribal leader. This was mostly led by local traders and businessmen.http://www.pucl.org/Topics/Human- rights/2006/salwa_judum.pdf This collapsed, and the leaders had to seek police protection. However, the second time around, the state had signed the mining agreements with the Tata and Essar groups, and was eager to flush the region of the Naxalites in order let the mining companies smoothly operate there. This was the beginning of police and military support to the movement. Mahendra Karma, a Congress Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and the leader of opposition in the State Legislative Assembly became the public front and took the Bijapur-based movement to Dantewada, Katreli and other parts of the region.Inside India's hidden war The Guardian, 9 May 2006.'Salwa Judum can't work in the long run' Chhattisgarh Director General of Police Vishwa Ranjan.

Salwa Judum is also accused of burning and evacuating out 644 or more villages, making 300,000 people flee their homes. As the situation further escalated in the coming years, Human Rights Watch reported atrocities at both ends, and reported large scale displacement of the civilian population caught in the conflict between the Naxalites and Salwa Judum activists with at least 100,000 people moving to various camps in southern Chhattisgarh or fleeing to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh as of early 2008.'Salwa Judum, forces too violating rights' The Times of India, 16 July 2008.\\"The 182-page report ‚Äî 'Being Neutral Is Our Biggest Crime: Government, Vigilante and Naxalite Abuses in India's Chhattisgarh State' ‚Äî documents human rights abuses against civilians, particularly tribals, caught in a tug-of-war between government forces, Salwa Judum and Naxalites. \\"Indian state 'backing vigilantes' BBC News, 15 July 2008.

On 6 July 2011 supreme court declared Salwa Judum as illegal. Controversy =Child soldiers= There have been numerous reports that the Salwa Judum had recruited minor boys for its armed forces. A primary survey evaluated by the Forum for Fact-finding Documentation and Advocacy (FFDA) determined that over 12,000 minors were being used by the Salwa Judum in the southern district of Dantewada and that the Chhattisgarh Government had \\"officially recruited 4200 Special Police Officers (SPOs); many of them being easily identifiable as minors\\". The Asian Centre for Human Rights (ACHR) also found that the Salwa Judum had engaged in the recruitment of child soldiers. Similar recruitment findings were also reported in the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers's \\"Child Soldiers Global Report 2008 ‚Äì India\\". =Human rights violations= Some human rights organisations such as the People's Union for Civil Liberties has raised allegations against Salwa Judum. A fact finding commission of National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC), appointed by Supreme Court of India reported that Salwa Judum was a \\"spontaneous reaction by the tribals to defend themselves against the reign of terror unleashed by the Naxalites.\\" The report was submitted to honourable Supreme Court of India which, on the contrary, declared Salwa Judum to be illegal and unconstitutional, and ordered its disbanding. =State sponsoring of militias= In April 2008, a Supreme Court bench directed the state Government to refrain from allegedly supporting and encouraging the Salwa Judum: \\"It is a question of law and order. You cannot give arms to somebody (a civilian) and allow him to kill. You will be an abettor of the offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.\\"; the state government had earlier denied, Salwa Judum being a state-sponsored movement,Hearing plea against Salwa Judum, SC says State cannot arm civilians to kill Indian Express, 1 April 2008.SC raps Chhattisgarh on Salwa Judum Rediff.com, 31 March 2008. later it directed the state government to take up the remedial measures suggested in the NHRC earlier reportImplement NHRC recommendations on Salwa Judum, Supreme Court asks Chhattisgarh government The Hindu, 20 September 2008.

Amenities  The complex has incorporated many post-9/11 security measures into its design, such as large steel barriers that can be raised to prevent cars from entering the glass atrium. One difference between the CCC and conventional buildings is its ability to withstand structural damage. The structure has been designed to remain standing even after 2/3s of the exterior columns on the first six floors have experienced failure. This is possible because each tower contains more structural steel than both of the 52 story Bankers Hall towers combined, rendering the building virtually airplane-proof. The courtrooms feature bullet-proof judges' benches, jury boxes, and witness stands. In April 2007, Telus was awarded the $16.3 million contract to provide the buildings with high-tech video recording, video conferencing, remote witness facilitation and remote management.

The Indian Medical Association regards Siddha medicine degrees as \\"fake\\" and Siddha therapies as quackery, posing a danger to national health due to absence of training in science-based medicine. Identifying fake medical practitioners without qualifications, the Supreme Court of India stated in 2018 that \\"unqualified, untrained quacks are posing a great risk to the entire society and playing with the lives of people without having the requisite training and education in the science from approved institutions\\". In rural India, siddhars have learned methods traditionally through master-disciple relationships to become local \\"healers\\". Siddhars are among an estimated 400,000 traditional healers practicing medicine in India, comprising some 57% of rural medical care. Siddha practitioners believe that five basic elements - earth, water, fire, air, sky - are in food, \\"humours\\" of the human body, and herbal, animal or inorganic chemical compounds, such as sulfur and mercury, used as therapies for treating diseases. The Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy of the Government of India regulates training in Siddha medicine and other traditional practices grouped collectively as AYUSH. Practitioners are called siddhars (vaithiyars in Tamil), and may have formal training with advanced degrees, such as BSMS (Bachelor in Siddha Medicine and Surgery), MD (Medical Doctor, Siddha) or Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). The Central Council of Indian Medicine, a statutory body established in 1971 under AYUSH, monitors education in areas of rural Indian medicine, including Siddha medicine.  History  Siddha is an ancient Indian traditional treatment system which evolved in South India, and is dated to the times of 3rd millennium BCE Indus Valley Civilization or earlier. According to ancient literature of Siddha, it is said that the system of this medicine originated from Hindu God Shiva who taught it to his consort Parvati. Parvati then passed it on to Nandi and Nandi taught about it to nine Devtas. Most Siddha medical practitioners are traditionally trained, usually in families and by gurus (teachers). When the guru is a martial arts teacher, he is also known as an ashan. Traditionally, it is taught that the siddhars laid the foundation for this system of medication. Siddhars were spiritual adepts who possessed the ashta siddhis. Nandhisar is considered the first siddha and the guru of all siddhars.  Concept of disease and cause  When the normal equilibrium of the three humors ‚Äî Vaadham, Pittham and Kapam ‚Äî is disturbed, disease is caused. The factors assumed to affect this equilibrium are environment, climatic conditions, diet, physical activities, and stress. Under normal conditions, the ratio between Vaadham, Pittham, and Kapam are 4:2:1, respectively. According to the Siddha medicine system, diet and lifestyle play a major role in health and in curing diseases. This concept of the Siddha medicine is termed as pathiyam and apathiyam, which is essentially a rule based system with a list of \\"do's and don'ts\\".  Herbalism  The herbal agents used by the siddhars could be classified into three groups: thavaram (herbal product), thadhu (inorganic substances) and jangamam (animal products). The thadhu agents are further classified as: uppu (water-soluble inorganic substances that give out vapour when put into fire), pashanam (agents not dissolved in water but emit vapour when fired), uparasam (similar to pashanam but differ in action), loham (not dissolved in water but melt when fired), rasam (substances which are soft), and ghandhagam (substances which are insoluble in water, like sulphur).  Siddha today  The Tamil Nadu state runs a 5.5-year course in Siddha medicine (BSMS: Bachelor in Siddha Medicine and Surgery). The Indian Government also gives its focus on Siddha, by starting up medical colleges and research centers like National Institute of Siddha. and Central Council for Research in Siddha. Commercially, Siddha medicine is practiced by siddhars referred in Tamil as vaithiyars. Regulation Practicing Siddha medicine and similar forms of rural alternative medicine in India was banned in the Travancore- Cochin Medical Practitioners' Act of 1953, then reinforced in 2018 by the Supreme Court of India which stated that \\"A number of unqualified, untrained quacks are posing a great risk to the entire society and playing with the lives of people.\\" The Act requires that qualified medical practitioners be trained at a recognized institution, and be registered and displayed on a list of valid physician practitioners, as published annually in The Gazette of India. The Gazette list does not recognize practitioners of Siddha medicine because they are not trained, qualified or registered as valid physicians.  Criticism  Since 2014, the Supreme Court of India and Indian Medical Association have described Siddha medicine as quackery, and there is no governmental recognition of siddhars as legitimate physicians. The Indian Medical Association regards the Indian institutions that train people in Siddha medicine, the supposed degrees granted, and the graduates of those programs as \\"fake\\". Since 1953, the Indian national government has not recognized Siddha medicine or any alternative system of medicine as valid, and there is no proposal to integrate Siddha medicine into conventional medicine practiced in India. There may be as many as one million quack \\"doctors\\", including siddhars, practicing medicine in the rural regions of India, a condition not actively opposed by the Indian government out of concern for serving some health needs for the large rural population.Sources that criticize AYUSH as a pseudoscience: The Indian Medical Association emphatically opposed this position in 2014. In 2018, licensed Indian physicians staged demonstrations and accused the government of sanctioning quackery by proposing to allow rural quacks to practice some aspects of clinical medicine without having complete medical training.

It is a perennial, deciduous, and belongs to the family Fabaceae (beans/legumes) and as it grows it starts as a shrub but eventually matures to a small tree. The tree has a high density of leaves along with small clumps of white flowers and creates 4‚Äì7 cm long seed pods. Acaciella angustissima is found in tropical areas around the equator since, its water needs can vary from 750-2,500 mm a year. It has an advantage it can withstand a moderate drought, since its leaves are retained even in long dry periods. Aside from being drought tolerant, Acaciella angustissima also has the benefit of being a green manure, since it has such a high leaf density, but also loses the majority of its leaves each season. So the leaves can be used in composting or can be saved and used as livestock feed. It should only be used as an additive to the feed and not the main source, since it also toxic in high doses Description Acaciella angustissima is normally a shrub but can also look like a small tree when fully grown, since its height can vary from 2‚Äì7 m depending on the growing conditions. Large clumps of small white flowers cover the branches of the bush. The flowers have 5 petals with a large number of stamens extended far past the petals.Tropical Forages, Acaciella angustissima (as Acacia angustissima) , Tropical Forages The plant also produces a small seedpod that starts out green, but then turns brown when fully matured. The seedpods usually have a length of 4‚Äì7 cm, and are 6‚Äì8 mm wide. The leaves which are one of the plant‚Äôs key traits are made up of 10-20 pairs of long thin leaves that go down a stem. They come in pairs of 3‚Äì12. One unique feature of the Acaciella angustissima is that it is thornless unlike most members of the genus AcaciaTexas Wildlife Center, Acaciella angustissima (as Acacia angustissima), Wildlife Center (which it formerly belonged to). History Acaciella angustissima comes from the plant family Fabaceae. It only grows in very wet parts of the world, usually around the equator due to its large consumption of water. It is native to southern parts of North America, the Caribbean and the majority of South America. However, it is able to grow at almost any elevation and usually prefers a warm climate of 25-30 degrees Celsius. Acaciella angustissima is still one of the many crops under-utilized and researched. Luckily there is hope, roughly 20 years ago researches started evaluating it in tropical areas such as Zimbabwe. Natural habitat Acaciella angustissima fruit (bean) Altitude: 0-2600m Annual temperature mean: 5-30 deg. C. Annual rainfall mean: 895-2870mm Soil: A. angustissima is well-suited for acidic, low-nutrient soils and it has very good resistance to drought.World Agroforestry Centre Growing conditions Since Acaciella angustissima is a shrub, it propagates (spreads) through its seeds or clippings. The seeds come from all the pods that the Acaciella angustissima grows each year, and the clippings should be taken from a somewhat hard branch, to better support themselves when transplanted.NC State University, ‚ÄúPlant Propagation by Stem Cuttings‚Äù, NC State University Acaciella angustissima should be planted in March or April in soil that has good drainage and is more on the acidic side on the pH scale.Marion Simmons, [www.worldwidewattle.com/infogallery/cultivation/ Cultivation of Acacias], World Wide Wattle To be most effectively utilized it should be used to prevent erosion, since it has such a large root system. This is also one of its downfalls, since when it is intercropped with other species its roots can be a major competitor for vital nutrients. Luckily its fallen leaves can provide enough N, K, and P to keep smaller nearby plants healthy, and provide some shade at the same time.James E. Smith, Prairie Acacia, USDA Acaciella angustissima is self-sustaining and does not need fertilizer, but has been found to respond well to fertilizer when added. However, the plant has a large water requirement. It requires a minimum \\"rain fall\\" of 700 mm but can handle up to a maximum of 3 000 mm. Uses =Alcoholic beverages= The bark is used in the production of alcoholic beverages. The root is used in the drink pulque in Mexico. =Forage= The seeds of Acaciella angustissima are high in protein and are somewhat useful as forage for livestock.Acaciella angustissima (as Acacia angustissima) The tree has a tannin content of 6%, which inhibits the ability of livestock to make use of the tree's protein. =Medicine= Acaciella angustissima The indigenous Tzotzil and Tzeltal Maya people of Mexico use A. angustissima to treat digestive tract problems. They also use it to treat toothache, rheumatoid arthritis and cuts of the skin. Experiments have shown that A. angustissima mildly inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Constraints to wider adoption There are unfortunately many constraints holding Acaciella angustissima back from being adopted. Firstly the amount of water it needs to survive is 3 ‚Äì 4 times the amount of rainfall found in more northern parts of Africa. This is unfortunate since dry land farmers could benefit the most from this tree. The second and most important constraint is that, Acaciella angustissima can actually act as a weed. It is so effective at propagation that it spreads rapidly. Thirdly, Acaciella angustissima contains roughly 10% tannins, which is the plant's natural defense mechanism. The taste created by the tannins is not usually welcomed, and the compound itself negatively affects livestock digestive systems.Anteonello Cannas, ‚ÄúPlants Poisonous to Livestock, Cornell University ‚Äì Animal Science Practical information The most important fact about Acaciella angustissima is that it has turned into a weed in its native habitat, so it should only be used in a controlled environment or when absolutely necessary. The only times it should be considered are when dealing with a harsh conditions where only weeds can survive, and some type of ground cover is needed to help with erosion control. If these circumstances are true, then the expected final height of the plant should be kept in mind when planting to prevent over crowding. Intercropping would also be complementary, by allowing farmers to take advantage of the unused space between plants, the nitrogen fixing habit, and the shade provided by the bushy branches. Due to the complex structure of the leaves it can take a year for them to decompose and release nutrients into the soil. To create a seed bank, it is important to remove all the seeds from the pod, and then clean them before storing, so that the pod doesn‚Äôt break down and start attracting insects.

He translated the Bible into Lithuanian, was the author of twelve Lithuanian books, and a historian as well. Biography Postilƒó, signed \\"per Jona Bretkuna Lietuwos plebona Karaliaucziuj Prusu\\"Another page of Postilƒó Jonas Bretk≈´nas, Johann(es) Bretke was born in Duchy of Prussia (a fief of Poland) in 1536. His father was German (according to Gerullis) or Germanized Prussian,Bretk≈´nas ir jo svarbiausias rankra≈°tis and his mother from a native Prussian family. The language spoken in the area was primarily German, while Jonas Bretk≈´nas' mother tongues were Old Prussian and Lithuanian. Lithuanian language was also used in state chancellery as well. Different people, who had come to Lutheran Prussia did at the time, because the Lutherans had promised to preach in languages people understood rather than Latin. The Duke of Prussia therefore arranged for the education and studies of languages for pastors. In 1544, Duke Albrecht, had founded the Albertina University in K√∂nigsberg (Karaliauƒçius) and the area became one of the centers of learning for the neighboring peoples of Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, none of them had bibles in their language up to that time. As the Duke of Ducal Prussia, the first Lutheran state, Albrecht supported the translations of the Bible into these languages. In 1555, when Bretk≈´nas was nineteen years of age, he began studying theology at the University of K√∂nigsberg. In 1556, he transferred to Wittenberg University. During his studies, in 1562, he was appointed a Lutheran pastor at Labiau (Labguva) (now Polessk) by Duke Albert. He was the first pastor at Labiau who could give sermons in Prussian and the Lithuanian language. Before that pastors often employed Tolken, who translated the sermons directly to the congregation. In 1563, Bretke married Frl. von Werthern. It was a rural, poor parish and pastors were expected to make their own living by receiving some farm land. Bretk≈´nas was not at all inclined to farming and wanted to spend all his time on language studies and translations. In 1579, he started translating the handwritten Bible from German using Martin Luther's analog, and the translation took more than ten years to complete, with tens of thousands of correction notes. Between 1578‚Äì1579, he wrote the Chronicles of Prussian Lands (Chronicon des Landes Preussen) in German. After living twenty-five meager years in Labiau, Bretke (Jonas Bretk≈´nas) applied for a position as pastor at another Prussian town, but was in 1587 transferred to a Lithuanian language parish in K√∂nigsberg as pastor.Jonas Bretk≈´nas He continued with his translation of the Bible and other scholarly works. In 1589, he published several new works, in particular \\"Giesmes duchaunos\\" (Spiritual Hymns), based on Martynas Ma≈ævydas' works, as well as a small collection of hymns called \\"Kancionalas netukriu giesmiu\\", and a prayer book translation from German into Lithuanian \\"Kollectas\\", all printed by Georg Osterberg of K√∂nigsberg. On November 29, 1590, Bretke-Bretk≈´nas finally completed his translation of the Bible (Old and New Testaments). It is the first surviving translation of the Bible into the Lithuanian language.UNESCO. Jonas Bretkunas The matter of publishing this Bible was discussed by the Lutheran college, but he failed to receive permission to publish it. Later the manuscripts of the Bretk≈´nas Bible were purchased by Duke Georg Friedrich. In 1591, he finished the Postilla (Postilƒó), one of his best known works, consisting of two parts. In his final years Bretk≈´nas continued to unsuccessfully lobby for the publication of his Bible, but in 1602 he died.

The individual works were composed at different times and published together in 1852. Berlioz associated them in his mind with Shakespeare's Hamlet, one of his favourite plays. They were never performed during the composer's lifetime. Details of the work The three movements are: # M√©ditation religieuse (Religious Meditation) A setting of a poem by Thomas Moore (translated into French by Louise Belloc) for six-part chorus and small orchestra. It was composed during Berlioz's stay in Rome in 1831. # La mort d‚ÄôOph√©lie (The death of Ophelia) A setting of a ballade by Ernest Legouv√©, based on Gertrude's description of Ophelia's drowning in Act IV of Hamlet.

Hueyatlaco is an archeological site in the Valsequillo Basin near the city of Puebla, Mexico. After excavations in the 1960s, the site became notorious due to geochronologists' analyses that indicated human habitation at Hueyatlaco was dated to ca. 250,000 years before the present.Szabo, B.J., Malde, H.E., and Irwin-Williams, C., Dilemma Posed By Uranium-Series Dates On Archaeologically Significant Bones From Valsequillo Puebla Mexico, Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Volume 6, Pages 237-244, Jul 1969 These controversial findings are orders of magnitude older than the scientific consensus for habitation of the New World (which generally traces widespread human migration to the New World to 13,000 to 16,000 ybp). The findings at Hueyatlaco have mostly been repudiated by the larger scientific community, and have seen only occasional discussion in the literature.Gonzalez, Silvia; Huddart, David; and Bennett Matthew. (2006) Valsequillo Pleistocene archaeology and dating : ongoing controversy in Central Mexico. World Archaeology, 2006, vol. 38, no4, pp. 611-627. Overview of excavation Cynthia Irwin-Williams led the team that first excavated the site in 1962.Irwin-Williams, C., et al., Comments on the Associations of Archaeological Materials and Extinct Fauna in the Valsequillo Region Puebla Mexico, American Antiquity, Volume 34, Number 1, Pages 82-83, Jan 1969 The dig is often associated with Virginia Steen-McIntyre because of her continuing efforts to publicize her findings and opinions. However, the site was actually discovered by Juan Armenta Camacho and Irwin-Williams. Steen-McIntyre joined the team in 1966 as a graduate student, at the request of project geologist Harold E. (Hal) Malde. The excavation was associated with the U.S. Geological Survey. The region, about 75 miles SE of Mexico City, was known for its abundance of animal fossils, and Irwin-Williams described Hueyatlaco as a \\"kill site\\" where animals were hunted and butchered.Irwin-Williams, Cynthia. (1978) Summary of Archeological Evidence from the Valsequillo Region, Puebla, Mexico. In Cultural Continuity in Mesoamerica, David L. Browman, ed. The Hague: Mouton Publishers. Excavations were conducted via standard protocols, including securing the sites to prevent trespass or accidental disturbances.Webb, Mark Owen and Suzanne Clark. (1999). \\"Anatomy of an Anomaly.\\" Disputatio, 6. During excavation, investigators discovered numerous stone tools. The tools ranged from relatively primitive implements at a smaller associated site, to more sophisticated items such as scrapers and double-edged blades uncovered at the main excavation site. The diversity of tools made from non-local materials suggested that the region had been used by multiple groups over a considerable period. Early controversy In 1967, Jose L. Lorenzo of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia claimed that implements had been planted at the site by local laborers in such a way as to make it difficult or impossible to determine which artifacts were discovered in situ and which were planted. Irwin-Williams counter-argued that Lorenzo's claims were malicious and without merit. Furthermore, in 1969 Irwin- Williams cited statements of support from three prominent archeologists and anthropologists (Richard MacNeish, Hannah Marie Wormington and Frederick A. Peterson) who had each visited the site independently and attested to the integrity of the excavations and the professionalism of the group's methodology. First dating publication In mid-1969, B.J. Szabo, Malde and Irwin-Williams published their first paper about dating the excavation site. The stone tools were discovered in situ in a stratum that also contained animal remains. Radiocarbon dating of the animal remains produced an age of over 35,000 ybp. Uranium dating produced an age of 260,000 ybp, ¬± 60,000 years. The authors stated that they had no definitive explanation for the anomalous results. However, Malde suggested the tool-bearing strata had possibly been eroded by an ancient streambed, thus combining older and newer strata and complicating dating. Attempts to resolve anomaly In 1973, Virginia Steen-MacIntyre, Malde and Roald Fryxell returned to Hueyatlaco to re-examine the geographic strata and more accurately determine an age for the tool-bearing strata. They were able to rule out Malde's streambed hypothesis. Moreover, the team undertook an exhaustive analysis of volcanic ash and pumice from the original excavation site and the surrounding region. Using the zircon Fission track dating method, geochemist C.W. Naeser dated samples of ash from Hueyatlaco's tool-bearing strata to 370,000 ybp +/- 240,000 years. The confirmation of an anomalously distant age for human habitation at the Hueyatlaco site led to tension between Irwin-Williams and the other team members. Malde and Fryxell announced the findings at a Geological Society of America meeting, admitting that they could not account for the anomalous results. Irwin-Williams responded by describing their announcement as \\"irresponsible\\". Given the substantial margin of error for the fission-track findings, and the then-new method of uranium dating, Irwin-Williams asserted that Hueyatlaco had not been accurately dated to her satisfaction. Delays For the next several years, the excavation team were often at odds as they discussed how to move forward with the Hueyatlaco findings. Malde and Steen- McIntyre argued that the 200,000 ybp findings were valid, while Irwin-Williams argued in favor of a more recent‚Äîthough still somewhat controversial‚Äîfigure of 20,000 ybp. Webb and Clark suggest that her promoting the 20,000ybp date is \\"particularly puzzling,\\" as it was unsupported by any evidence the team uncovered. The delays forced Steen-McIntyre to write her doctoral dissertation not on Hueyatlaco as planned, but rather on the dating of volcanic ash in geographic strata. Despite leading the original excavations, Irwin-Williams never published a final report on the site. 1981 Publication In 1981, the journal Quaternary Research published a paper by Steen-McIntyre, Fryxell and Malde that defended an anomalously distant age of human habitation at Hueyatlaco. The paper reported the results of four sophisticated, independent tests: uranium-thorium dating, fission track dating, tephra hydration dating and the studying of mineral weathering to determine the date of the artifacts. These tests, among other data, validated a date of 250,000ybp for the Hueyatlaco artifacts. They wrote: :\\"The evidence outlined here consistently indicates that the Hueyatlaco site is about 250,000 yr. old. We who have worked on geological aspects of the Valsequillo area are painfully aware that so great an age poses an archeological dilemma [...] In our view, the results reported here widen the window of time in which serious investigation of the age of Man in the New World would be warranted. We continue to cast a critical eye on all the data, including our own.\\" Aftermath In a letter to Quaternary Research, Irwin-Williams objected to several points in the article by Steen-McIntyre et al.; Malde and Steen-McIntyre responded with a point-by- point rebuttal. Steen-McIntyre claims that some of the original research team were harassed, viewed as incompetent, or saw their careers hampered due to their involvement in such a controversial and anomalous investigation. In 1990, Frison and Walker discuss possible pre-clovis sites dating to perhaps 20,000ybp but argued against human habitation of Hueyatlaco ca. 250,000ybp. They argue that the stone tools found at the site are \\"entirely too modern\\" to have possibly been manufactured by hominids of that era, and that the animal remains at the site are consistent with fauna that thrived no earlier than the last glacial maximum ca. 18,000 to 20,000ybp.Frison, George C., and DANNY N. WALKER. \\"New World palaeoecology at the Last Glacial Maximum and the implications for New World prehistory.\\" Chapter 17 in The World At 18000 BP: Volume 1, High Latitudes. Olga Soffer and Clive Gamble, eds. London: Unwin Hyman (1990). In 1996, Steen-McIntyre appeared on the television special \\"The Mysterious Origins of Man.\\" Narrated by Charlton Heston, the program detailed a variety of claims that contradicted or challenged the scientific consensus about humanity's genesis and development. Frank Steigerhttp://www.xmission.com/~tlacy/mom.txt posted a rebuttal of the program, including Steen-McIntyre's statements, on a talk.origins discussion board. However, Steiger's rebuttal claims that Steen-McIntyre discovered \\"an arrowhead\\" in New Mexico rather than multiple artifacts in Mexico. It is unclear if the error is Steiger's, or a misstatement on the television special. Moreover, Steiger's rebuttal makes no mention of the multiple peer- reviewed papers that appear to support the anomalously old age of tool-bearing strata at Hueyatlaco. Again, it's uncertain if the program failed to accurately outline the findings of Steen-McIntyre or if Steiger's rebuttal was incomplete. Biostratigraphic researcher Sam VanLandingham has published two peer-reviewed analyses that confirm the earlier findings of ca. 250,000ybp for the tool-bearing strata at Hueyatlaco. His 2004 analysis found that Hueyatlaco samples could be dated to the Sangamonian Stage (ca. 80,000 to 220,000ybp) by the presence of multiple diatom species, one of which first appeared during this era and others that became extinct by the era's end.VanLandingham, S.L., Corroboration of Sangamonian Age of Artifacts From the Valsequillo Region Puebla Mexico By Means of Diatom Biostratigraphy, Micropaleontology, Volume 50, Number 4, Pages 313-342, 2004 VanLandingham's 2006 paperVanLandingham, S.L., Diatom Evidence For Autochthonous Artifact Deposition In the Valsequillo Region Puebla Mexico During Sangamonian (sensu lato = 80,0000 to ca. 220,000 yr BP and Illinoian (220,000 to 430,000 yr BP)), Journal of Paleolimnology, Volume 36, Number 1, Pages 101-116, Jul 2006 refined and re-confirmed his 2004 findings.

It was based on the M901 Improved TOW Vehicle (ITV) - itself based on the ubiquitous M113 Armored Personnel Carrier chassis - and outwardly closely resembles it, so as to make it less conspicuous on the battlefield. Equipment The principal equipment on the FISTV is the Ground/Vehicular Laser Locator Designator (G/VLLD), pronounced \\"glid\\". This device obtains precise range information to a lased target. When combined with directional control from an inertial navigation system and vehicle coordinates from the GPS, the system is able to obtain precise coordinates of a designated target. The FISTV also has four SINCGARS radios to track the numerous voice and data radio nets pertinent to fire support operations. Employment The FISTV identifies targets and sends their description and location to the Fire Direction Center. Each Armor or Mechanized Infantry company in the US Army had one M981. Its crew consisted of a Lieutenant, a noncommissioned officer, and two soldiers. This crew doubles as the advisors to the company commander on fire support issues. FISTVs are also used by Combat Observation and Lasing Teams (COLTs), a Brigade asset positioned to support the Brigade fires plan. History Among its several advantages, the hammerhead could be raised from behind protective terrain or concealing cover. Although gyroscopes had their weaknesses, these systems were replaced or supplemented with other location & positioning systems, such as GPS. The crew could also use basic land navigation skills, like triangulating from known terrain features, should gyros or technology fail. The FISTV had several limitations, including the vehicle's poor performance compared to the M2 Bradleys and M1 Abrams tanks with which it maneuvered, forcing the other vehicles to wait while the FISTV labored to keep up. Its top-heavy design made it prone to rollovers. The lack of a heavy weapons system or enhanced armor meant that the crew depended solely on the supported element for protection. It could not move with the hammerhead deployed in the raised position and it took the gyroscopes about 10 minutes to spin up, stabilize and locate once the vehicle's crew was parked and setup. The M981 FISTV has been supplanted by the M7 Bradley and M1131 Stryker fire support vehicles.

Gen. J. F. R., p. 90 After Pakistan Army drove the Bengali resistance across the Indian border at the conclusion of Operation Searchlight, Indian Army implemented a supply and training operation for the Mukti Bahini from 15 May 1971, with the goal of sending ever increasing number of trained fighters to attack Pakistani forces and sabotage military and economic assets to demoralize the Pakistani soldiers and disrupt their supply network. This enterprise was dubbed \\"Operation Jackpot\\". The Mukti Bahini Naval Commandos launched several sabotage efforts in the cities of Chittagong, Chandpur, Mongla, and the Narayanganj District against the operating combined forces of the Pakistan Soldiers, Pakistan Marines, Pakistan Navy SEAL Teams, and the East Pakistan Security Forces on the night of 15 August 1971. Bengali Submariners who had defected from Pakistani submarine PNS Mangro (S133), then based in Toulon in France, led the attacks, and this is also known as Operation Jackpot.A Tale of Millions, Islam, Major Rafiqul Bir Uttam, p. 265 Pakistani military initiated countermeasures to improve security by increasing the door-to-door clearance and the applied counterinsurgency tactics by the Army Special Forces and the Navy SEAL Teams, but this failed to curb the Mukti Bahini activity.Bangladesh at War, Shafiullah, Maj.

Bir Uttam., Bangladesh at War, p 211  Background  After the postponing of the session National Assembly of Pakistan, the High Command was authorised by the Yahya administration to launch the military operation (codename: Searchlight and Barisal) on March 1971 in a view of curbing political opposition instigated by the Awami League‚Äì which had won majority in the 1970 elections and would have formed next civilian government of Pakistan had the army not intervened. The Pakistani Armed Forces launched Operation Searchlight on 25 March 1971 in a bid to take control of East Pakistan and subdue all resistance (political or otherwise) against the West Pakistani authorities. By mid of May, the Pakistan Authorities in East Pakistan, with the crucial support provided by the Pakistani military, had been in control of maintaining the writ of government in major areas of East, and the Mukti Bahini, under attack from Pakistan Air force and armed military units, started to retreat across the border into India.Surrender at Dacca: Birth of A Nation, Jacob, Lt. Gen. J. F. R., p. 36/37 By the middle of June, Pakistani army had driven the remnants of Bengali army and Para-military units, who had been supported by the civilians, across the border into India.Salik, Brigadier Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, p 90 The Mukti Bahini, formed around the defecting Bengali soldiers with civilian volunteers, started a guerrilla campaign.Islam, Major. Rafiqul Bir Uttam., A Tale of Millions, p 214 =Prelude= The central government in India decided to open its Eastern border with East-Pakistan on 27 March, and started to admit millions of Bengali refugees and political dissidents into India, housing them in specialized camps.Surrender at Dacca: Birth of A Nation, Jacob, Lt.

Osmani as commander of Mukti Bahini (regular armed forces and insurgents) under the authority of Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmad.A Tale of Millions, Islam, Major Rafiqul Bir Uttam, p. 217 Since March 1971, the local supply of weapons and ammunition were initially overseen by the India's Border Security Force (BSF) and BSF had even made disorganized incursions in Bangladesh, with little success. On the whole BSF did not have the ability to meet the demands of the war completely, and on 15 May Indian Army Eastern Command took over the task of training and supplying the Mukthi Bahini.Islam, Major. Rafiqul Bir Uttam., A Tale of Millions, p 211 Indian Army dubbed the operation to support Mukti Bahini \\"Operation Jackpot\\", setting up a coordinated enterprise under the Eastern Command for meeting the material support, logistical, and training needs, and to some extent, lend operational support and planning advice.A Tale of Millions, Islam, Major Rafiqul Bir Uttam, p. 211 At the operational stage at the Indian Army's Headquarters in New Delhi, Maj.

Bir Uttam, p. 159 =The operational setup and execution of plan= The border areas around East Pakistan was divided into six logistical sectors, each to be commanded by a brigadier from the Indian Army. The Indian logistical sectors for this operation were: * Alpha (HQ: Murti Camp, West Bengal), C.O. Brig. B. C. Joshi. * Bravo (HQ: Rajgaunj, West Bengal), C.O. Brig. Prem Singh. * Charlie (HQ: Chakulia, Bihar), C.O. Brig. N. A. Salik. * Delta (HQ: Devta Mura, Tripura), C.O. Brig. Sabeg Singh. * Echo (HQ: Masimpur, Assam), C.O. Brig. M. B.

Through this network, Mukti Bahini forces communicated with the Mukti Bahini Headquarters Exiled in Kolkata and coordinated all supply, training and operational efforts for the war. Lt. Gen. J. S. Aurora, commander of Eastern Command, was overseeing the entire operation. =Effectiveness and importance= At the beginning of stage of the Jackpot, the operation proved to be a significant one since the Mukti Bahini had engaged in series of insurgent attacks, political assassinations, and terrorist activities in all over the East-Pakistan that it debunked the Yahya administration's claims of maintaining the law enforcement and stability in Eastern region as the insurgency picked up its importance when the international press publicizing the political events in East. The Indian Army's Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) was well aware of the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces, therefore planned a careful operation with the Mukti Bahini Leadership to launch a series of attacks to sabotage the civil and military infrastructure, inflict casualties on Pakistani forces and demoralize Pakistan armed forces personnel the before the Indian Army officially engaged both the Pakistan Army and Pakistan Navy in Eastern Pakistan. Despite limitations and challenges rising from the state of the Indian transport network, availability of supplies, differences of opinion of guerrilla training methods and the decision of Bangladesh government to train the maximum number of guerrillas in the shortest possible time,Jacob, Lt. Gen J.F.R., Surrender at Dhaka: Birth of A Nation, p 174 which may have caused supply shortages and often arming of only 40% to 50% of the newly trained guerrillas with firearms,Islam, Major Rafiqul Bir Uttam, A Tale of Millions, p 288 Bangladesh managed to field 30,000 regular troops and 100,000 guerrillas and run a campaign that would at least destroy or damage 231 bridges, 122 railway lines, 90 electric stations,Salik, Brigadier Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, p 104 disrupting the logistical/supply system of the Pakistani forces, and kill at least 237 officers, 136 JCOs and 3,559 soldiers of the regular army during April to November 1971,Salik, Brigadier Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, p 118 and an unspecified number of Police, West Pakistan Rangers, EPCAF and Razakar members. The guerrilla operations had also lowered the morale of the Pakistani army and by November, they chose to remain in their bases whenever possible,Witness To Surrender, Salik, Brigadier Siddiq, p. 101 and the contribution of the guerrilla warfare to the final victory was enormous despite the challenges. Background: Naval Commandos At the conclusion of Operation Searchlight and Operation Barisal, the Army and Navy had driven the Mukti Bahini into India, where they entered a period of reorganization during June and July 1971 to train guerrillas, set up networks and safe houses in the occupied territories to run the insurgency and rebuild the conventional forces. Col. M. a. G. Osmani divided the country into 11 sectors, while planning to send 2,000‚Äì5,000 guerrillas inside Bangladesh every month with 3/4 weeks training to hit all targets of opportunity, while build up the regular force to seize territory in Sylhet,Jacob, Lt. Gen. J. F. R., Surrender at Dacca, Birth of A Nation, pp. 43‚Äì44Hasan, Moyeedul, Muldhara 71, pp. 53‚Äì55 Indian officials suggested fielding a force of 8,000 guerrillas with regular troops in leadership position with three or four-month's training.Jacob, Lt. Gen. J. F. R., Surrender at Dacca, Birth of A Nation, p. 93 The solution was to activate the hitherto inactive Sector No. 10Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K. M., Bangladesh at War, pp. 162‚Äì163 as a special sector for naval commandos with Col. Osmani in charge from 13 May onwards,Rahman, Md. Khalilur, Muktijuddhay Nou-Abhijan, p. 47 and this Naval commando force was to be trained as per the Indian suggestion, acting as an elite force for attacking riverine and seabourne targets. Col. Osmani's initial strategy of sending 2,000‚Äì5,000 guerrillas inside Bangladesh every month since July and hitting the border outpostsIslam, Maj. Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions p. 297 with regular battalions had not yielded expected results for various reasons,Islam, Maj.

Rao Farman, When Pakistan Got Divided, p. 100Niazi, Lt. Gen. A. A. K., The Betryal of East Pakistan, p. 96 As the pace of military operations in Bangladesh slacked off, the civilian morale was adversely affected,A Tale of Millions, Islam, Major Rafiqul Bir Uttam, p. 292 which prompted East-Pakistan administrative authorities to claim that the situation had returned to \\"normal\\". In response to this declaration, the Mukti Bahini launched 2 operations: (1) Guerrilla attacks in targets in Dhaka by a crack commando group trained by Major ATM Haider (ex-SSG commando), and (2) the simultaneous mining and damaging of ships in Chittagong, Chandpur, Mongla and Narayanganj on 15 August, which became known in Bangladesh and international media as \\"Operation Jackpot\\". Mukti Bahini riverine activity Bangladesh is crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers in addition to 300 large navigable canals. The river transport is important because of the poor state of the road network, especially during the monsoon, when the whole country turns into a morass of mud and many areas are only reachable only through water transport.Ali, Maj. Gen. Rao Farman, When Pakistan Got Divided, pp. 114‚Äì119 The movement and logistics of Pakistan army largely depended on their control of the inland waterways, and of the Sea ports. Mukti Bahini did not operate a separate naval wing during March‚ÄìJune 1971. River craft were requisitioned as needed. The Pakistan Navy and Air Force sank one such craft, MV Ostrich, during Operation Barisal on 26 April, while Pakistani gunboats sank 3 boats commanded by Mukti Bahini on 5 May 1971, at Gabura.Islam, Major Rafiqul PSc, Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 244, =Pakistan naval preparations= The importance of waterways was not lost on Pakistan Eastern Command. After the launch of Operation Searchlight and the successful conclusion of Operation Barisal, General A. O. Mittha (Quarter Master General of Pakistan Army) had recommended the creation of a port operating battalion for Chittagong, in addition to separate River Transport and River Marine Battalion to operate an augmented Cargo and Tanker flotilla.Niazi, Lt. Gen. A. A. K., The Betrayal of East Pakistan, p. 84, These steps were not implemented, the Army commandeered civilian water crafts for logistics and posted Army and Razakar personnel to guard various ferries, bridges, ports and other naval installations. Pakistan Navy established a Marine Academy in June 1971 to support riverine operations.Pns Qasim Rear Admiral Mohammad Shariff had only 4 gunboats (PNS Comilla, Rajshahi, Jessore and Sylhet) and a patrol boat (PNS Balaghat) in East Pakistan, while the navy remodelled 17 civilian ships into gunboats by adding 12.7/20 mm guns, and .30/.50 calibre Browning machine guns.Salik, Brig. Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, p. 130, These boats joined the fleet by August 1971, while several other boats had been fitted with 40X60 mm Bofors guns and .50 calibre machine guns in Khulna and Chittagong dockyards to serve as patrol boats.Rahman, Md. Khalilur, Muktijuddhay Nou-Abhijan, p. 66, A few hundred officers and 2,000 crewmen were posted in East Pakistan in 1971. 300 Bengali seamen were transferred to West Pakistan as a precaution after 25 March 1971, while Special Service Group Navy (SSGN) teams were posted in East Pakistan under Commander David Felix. =Naval Commando Training and preparations= A graphical representation of Bengali Naval Commando activities against Shipping in East Pakistan in 1971. A generic representation, not all geographic features are shown. The river transport system was vital for economic activity given the primitive state of the road and railways system of East Pakistan. Major Jalil, Colonel M. A. G. Osmani and Indian Commander Bhattachariya in collaboration with top regional commanders established the secret camp, codenamed C2P, in Plassey, West Bengal on 23 May to train volunteers selected from various Mukti Bahini sectors (Bangladesh was divided in 11 operational sectors for Mukti Bahini operations) for this purpose. Initially 300 volunteers were chosen,A Tale of Millions, Islam, Major Rafiqul Bir Uttam, p. 265‚Äì68 ultimately 499 commandos were trained in the camp. The training course included swimming, survival training, using limpet mines, hand-to-hand combat and navigation. By August 1971, the first batch of commandos were ready for operation. The Camp Commander at C2P was Commander M. N. Samanth, Training Coordinator was Lt. Commander G. Martis, both from the Indian Navy, while 20 Indian instructors along with the 8 Bengali submariners became trainers. Pakistani Intelligence agents scouted the camp in June and July but Indian security measures prevented any harm to the camp and apprehended all infiltrators. The Bangladesh naval commando operation that was called \\"Operation Jackpot\\" was precipitated by events in Toulon, a coastal city of southern France. The operation was planned to take on Naval Special Service Group of the Pakistani Navy, after it had conducted several other operations. In 1971, there were 11 East Pakistan naval submarine crewmen receiving training there aboard a Pakistani submarine. One commissioned officer (Mosharraf Hassain) and 8 crewmen decided to take control of the submarine and to fight against Pakistan. Their plan was disclosed, however, causing them to flee from death threats made by Pakistan's Naval Intelligence. Out of the 9 crewmen, one made his way to London, the others managed to travel to the Indian Embassy in Geneva, Switzerland. From Geneva, embassy officials took them to New Delhi on 9 April, where they began a program of top secret naval training at C2P. The operation was planned in the last week of July, under tight security. Information on river tides, weather and East Pakistani naval infrastructure and deployment was collected through the Mukti Bahini. Selected commandos were sent from C2P to forward bases in Tripura and West Bengal, where a final briefing was given to them. Mukti Bahini in Sector No. 1 assisted the group going to Chittagong, Sector No. 2 aided the groups going to Chandpur and Narayanganj and Sector No. 9 assisted the group targeting Mongla. Each commando carried a pair of fins, a knife, a limpet mine, and swimming trunks. Some had compasses, 1 in 3 commandos had Sten guns and hand grenades, the group leaders carried a transistor radio. All the groups carried their own equipment to their targets and after entering Bangladesh between 3 and 9 August, reached their destinations by 12 August, using the local Mukti Bahini network of safehouses. A pair of songs was played in India Radio (Akashbani) at specific times to convey the intended signal for commencing the operations.A Tale of Millions, Islam, Major Rafiqul Bir Uttam, p. 263‚Äì65 The first song (Amar putul ajke prothom jabe shoshur bari) was played on 13 August, the second song (Ami tomay joto shuniyechilem gan tar bodole chaini kono dan)Muktijudhdher Rachana Shomogra, Mahmud, Sezan, p. 61 on 14 August. The result of this operation was: * Chittagong: Sixty commandos were divided into 3 groups of 20 each, but one group failed to arrive due to Pakistani security on time. Out of 40 commandos, 9 refused to take part,Rahman, Md. Khalilur, Muktijuddhay Nou-Abhijan, p. 79, while 31 commandos mined 10 ships instead of 22 initially plannedShafique Ullah, Col.

Four ships were sunk or damaged. * Mongla: 60 commandos went to Mongla port. This team was divided into 5 groups of 12 members each. Ultimately 48 commandos mined 6 ships at Mongla. Twelve commandos had been sent on a separate mission.Rahman, Md.

Kearney served on the U.S. House of Representative's Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) during the Cold War. A native of Ithaca, New York and a graduate of Albany Law School, in 1914, Kearney began a practice in Gloversville. He enlisted in the New York National Guard in 1909, and took part in the 1916 border patrol mission that was part of the Pancho Villa Expedition. During World War I he completed officer training, received a commission, and served in France as a member of the 27th Division. Kearney was prominent in veterans affairs, and served as National Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars from 1936 to 1937. He remained in the National Guard after the war, attained the rank of brigadier general, and retired in 1940. During World War II, Kearney served in the New York Guard, and commanded a brigade. During the National Guard's post-World War II reorganization, he was recalled to service, promoted to major general, and assigned as commander of the 27th Infantry Division.

In 2006, the Hehe population was estimated at 805,000, up from the just over 250,000 recorded in the 1957 census when they were the eighth largest tribe in Tanganyika. There were an additional 4,023 of them in Uganda in 2014. Historically, they are famous for vanquishing a German expedition at Lugalo on 17 August 1891 and maintaining their resistance for seven years thereafter under the leadership of their chief Mkwawa...  Etymology  The use of Wahehe as the group's designator can be traced to their war cry,: \\"[T]he Hehe [are] descendants of a select group who were heard by adversaries to shout 'hee, hee, hee' before engaging in a fight.\\" and was originally employed by their adversaries. The Wahehe themselves adopted it only after the Germans and British applied it consistently, but by then the term had acquired connotations of prestige (keeping in mind, of course, the term's roots in Hehe warfare and the victory over the Germans of 1891).  History  \\"Of scientific literature on British East Africa\\", remarked John Walter Gregory in 1896, \\"there is unfortunately little to record. There is nothing which can compare with the magnificent series of works issued in description of German East Africa [‚Ä¶] The history of the exploration of Equatorial Africa is one to which Englishmen can look back with feelings of such just pride, that we may ungrudgingly admit the superiority of German scientific work in this region.\\". It is no surprise, therefore, that most of the important sources for the history of the Hehe are German., where it is noted that, between about 1891 and 1914, \\"many Germans wrote about German East Africa, its history, geography, geology, botany, zoology, physical anthropology and ethnography.\\" For details of the German research programme, see . Once German East Africa was split between the British and Belgian empires after World War I, the interest of German scholars waned, and the British chose not to continue their research. The people who were eventually to be called Hehe by Europeans, lived in isolation on a highland in southwestern Tanzania, northeast of Lake Nyasa (Lake Malawi), and had few ancestors who had been in Uhehe for more than four generations. With the exception of some pastoralists on the plains and some keeping a limited number of cattle and goats, the Wahehe were primarily an agricultural people. In the beginning they seemed to have lived in relative peace, although the various chiefs did quarrel with one another, raided each other for cattle and broke alliances. The population was probably small, with no chiefdom over 5,000 people. By the middle of the 19th century, however, Nguruhe, one of the more important chiefdoms led by the Muyinga dynasty, began to push its weight around and expand its influence and power. It was Munyigumbe, of the Muyinga family, who began to create the beginnings of a 'state' by both marriage and conquest. A good deal of this was at the expense of the Wasangu, using the Sangu's own military tactics and even utilizing forms of the Sangu language to properly rouse Hehe warriors to battle. Munyigumba even forced the Wasangu, under Merere II, to move their capital to Usafwa. Hehe warriors from Iringa (1906)With Munyigumba‚Äôs death in 1878 or 1879, a civil war broke out and a Nyamwezi slave, married to Munyigumba's sister, was able to kill Munyigumba's brother, leaving the unhappy prospect of dealing with Munyigumba's son Mkwawa. Mkwawa killed the Nyamwezi slave, Mwumbambe, at a location called the \\"place where heads are piled up\\", and Mkwawa took center stage, a stage that he continued to dominate until the end of the 19th century. a‚ÄôsJohn Iliffe describes Mkwawa in his book, A Modern History of Tanganyika as \\"slender, sharply intelligent, brutal, and cruel with a praise-name of the madness of the year\\". It was Mkwawa who, by 1880 or 1881,. became the sole ruler of Uhehe through war and intimidation. Mkwawa continued expanding Hehe power northwards toward the central caravan routes and afflicting the Wagogo, the Wakaguru, the Germans, etc., and in the south and east, anyone in their way, not least of all their old enemies the Wasangu, who then began turning to the Germans for support. By 1890, the Hehe were the strongest most dominant power in the southeast and began conflicting with that other raiding power, the Germans. 'The Hehe' had no elaborate organization but did have the flexibility to make difficulties for their enemies. Sub Chief Motomkali Mukini ‚Ä≥Mkini‚Ä≥ was assigned to rule and during his reign had established a military base used to recruit and train at the place so called Ihumitangu, meaning the place where colonial fighters were trained. He was succeeded by his son Galakwila Motomkali Mkini.  Society  The Wahehe reside primarily in Uhehe, an area that: With their armed opposition to German East Africa in mind, colonial descriptions would romanticise the Hehe as \\"these coarse, reserved mountain people [‚Ä¶] a true warrior tribe who live only for war.\\" Their power depended on the spear and on the disciplined force of their armed citizens. Even after firearms became more important the spear remained their chief weapon, for on the open plains the use of spears still had the advantage. The defense of a boma behind palisades or walls with rifles was not their strong point, tactics and a sudden mass spear attack was. Military organization remained the most important part of Wahehe life and every adult male was a warrior. The youngest lived in the capital, Iringa, where semi-professional warriors trained them. By the 1890s the Hehe had an immediate following of 2,000 to 3,000 men, with another 20,000 men of fighting age who could be mobilized from their scattered homesteads that by 1800 were normally surrounded by large maize fields. It was only later when their military reputation alone was no longer enough and warfare was actually a threat, did they begin to consolidate their villages and begin to build their homes closer together. Only after the wars ended did they once again build further apart with each homestead ideally surrounded by their own fields, larger houses for their many wives were built and could be surrounded by an open courtyard. While Iliffe considers the Wahehe state to have been unsophisticated, considered the legal system, traditions, and customs to have been quite sophisticated. It is true, however, that all authority came from the chief's will and that conquered chiefdoms were not assimilated but were held by for force, brutality, and fear. Whether one considers the state to be unsophisticated or not, the state was at the same time successful and durable. A visitor it was repeatedly said, could sense an arrogant confidence that was not found elsewhere, and Hehe identity has survived all colonial pressures. A tembe (traditional Wahehe housing) from Tabora (1906) Women captured in war were given to important men, (some men having as many as ten to twenty) who then did almost all of the subsistence agriculture, carried water, and all building material, their housing being well insulated against the violent extremes of heat and cold. A child received his family name, (the praise name) and the types of forbidden food from the father. A Wahehe could not marry anyone with the same praise name and the same forbidden food, even if the relationship could not be traced, and could not marry anyone related through the female line. There was, however, a preference for marrying cross cousins. Most communities contained many households who were related to one another. Two cows and a bull were considered important parts of bride-wealth to be given for a wife. Although judges (headmen) were subject to bribery (and at times quite willing to accept it), there was a recognized system of courts and law enforcement. Punishment remained fairly simple but had at least some variety. There were penalties of varied types, such as fines or penance, the death sentence, beatings, and the seldom used expulsion from the chiefdom. (excepting the death penalty, crippling or anything attacking the health of the individual, or any type of failing was unknown to the Wahehe.) The village headman was authorized for lighter cases, such as theft or other crimes against property, adultery, personal injury, etc., with the more difficult cases being sent further up the line in the direction of the 'sultan', especially those needing a test administrated by poison. All cases were presented orally and open to all. (Only trials of high treason against the sultan were held in secret.) Two male witnesses were thought sufficient for most 'normal' cases while it was thought that three to five were necessary with female witnesses. There could be verdicts for betraying or offending the state or its leader, giving false witness, adultery, (one female witness was sufficient, with a fine of one to three head of cattle) incest (very seldom if ever used, since females were quite often married between 10 and 13 years of age and needed three to five witnesses), rape (only the victim was needed as a witness), murder, manslaughter, vendetta, theft, agricultural theft, receiving stolen goods, and swindling were all parts of the judicial concept and had penalties associated with them. If a divorce took place, the husband was entitled to take all weaned children away from their mother and the mother's family was expected to return the bride-wealth. In spite of this, wives frequently obtained divorces, usually after they had already made arrangements with another man. The state's strength and power lay in its warriors and their spears, which made it not only disciplined and victorious, but also provided unity and identity, allowing everyone to join in its impressive successes. Hehe rebellion Askari soldiers under German command (1906) Emil von Zelewski The Wahehe were expanding towards the north and east at the same time the Germans were building stations along the central caravan route between the coast and Tabora. Those groups recognizing and accepting German supremacy (showing the German flag) were then brutally attacked, looted, and otherwise destroyed. After futile German attempts to negotiate with them, an expedition was sent out under the leadership of commander Emil von Zelewski. Since Julius von Soden saw little harm, Zelewski was given the go ahead to attack the Wahehe. As Iliffe relates in A Modern History of Tanganyika and Holger Doebold in Emil Zelewski, with Lt. Tettenborn's official report: The German Schutztruppe, needing to secure the inland area with its main trade and communications, Zelewski, its new commander, broke camp at 6:30, August 17, 1891, riding a donkey at the head of the column. \\"We burned 25 large village houses and killed 3 tribal warriors. A large group of Wahehe warriors were sighted with only spears and shields but few rifles. Shots from our side were enough to frighten them away\\". As its center reached the waiting Hehe, an officer shot at a bird. The Hehe grasped their spears and charged. The Askari fired only one or two rounds before they were overwhelmed. \\"The confusion increased when the pack donkeys of the artillery train panicked and stampeded into the 5th company. Soon the Askari also panicked. Lt. von Heydebreck managed to reach a nearby tembe with black officers Morgan Effendi and Gaber Effendi and twenty Askari.\\" A sixteen-year-old had speared Zelewski on his donkey. In ten minutes most of the column was dead. \\"I also decided to retreat through the chaos of fleeing porters, pillaging Wahehe, dying warriors, and retreating wounded Askaris. Warriors from Kondoa (1906) The rearguard escaped, occupied a hill, raised its flag, and sounded bugle calls to rally survivors. I sent a patrol to guide Lt. Heydebreck, wounded twice by a spear behind his right ear and covered with blood, to our position. NCO Thiemann succumbed to his wounds on the night of 17 to 18 August and we buried him at our tembe position outside the sight of the Wahehe warriors\\". The Hehe set fire to the grass, burning some of the wounded and hoping to encircle the rearguard. Some 300-400 Hehe followed but did not attack, having already lost 60 dead. Another 200 later died of wounds. The Germans then retreated in the direction of Kondoa. \\"Still with us are Lt. von Heydebreck, almost recovered from his wounds, Sergeant Kay, NCO Wutzer, Morgan Effendi, Gaber Effendi, 62 Askari (11 of them wounded), 74 porters (seven wounded), four donkeys, and the main part of our baggage.\\") Lt. Tettenborn believed that if it had not been for the death of a large number of Wahehe chiefs, Mkwawa incorrectly included, no one would have survived. Saving the main 'part of the baggage' is also incorrect, as it was not saved. Zelewski had started with 13 Europeans, some 320 Askaris, 170 porters, machine guns, and field artillery. Of these, ten Europeans, 256 Askaris, and 96 porters had been lost. The German defeat made a truly enormous impression and the Hehe had now gained reputation as the most powerful soldiers in German East Africa and the Schutztruppe was no longer in a position to continue attacking the Wahehe. Julius von Soden, the governor now in charge of German East Africa, vetoed revenge: \\"we should have digested the coast before we devoured the interior\\". For eighteen months all expeditions were banned, even though the German military was unhappy. In particular, Captain Tom von Prince could not bring himself to leave the Hehe alone and used his forts in the north to invade south into Hehe territory. Soden left in 1893, his concept ruined. With Colonel Freiherr von Schele, the new governor who brought a policy of aggression, there began the expedition of von Prince, Wynecken, and Zugf√ºhrer Bauer in support of Merere. Negotiations had failed and caravans continued to be raided until the Germans attacked and took possession of Mkwawa's capital, Iringa, in 1894. This time, however, the Germans were prepared with 609 Askari and three machine-guns. Mkwawa, though, was still not captured, and the Hehe continued to attack their neighbors and kill Germans. There was still no peace. Only with Mkwawa's suicide did 'peace' finally come to Uhehe. While von Schele, given credit for Mkwawa's final defeat and presented with Germany's highest decoration, was then continually attacked by the political moderates, and finally placed under civilian control from Berlin. Schele then resigned and was followed by more peaceful administrators for the next two years, who nevertheless continued to pressure the Wahehe. Tom von Prince, after Mkwawa's defeat, indicated great offence with the Wahehe refusal to point out the youth responsible for Zelewski's death. Prince claimed that the German military would never have punished a warrior for following his orders. By 1896, the Hehe were divided, with some of them beginning to submit to the Germans, and Mkwawa found himself isolated as an outlaw, but always protected by the general Wahehe population. He raided, ambushed patrols, and attacked German outposts, aided by 'loyal Wahehe' and even Sangu warriors of Merere III (son of Merere II). The Germans increased their campaign, searched again and again, even subjecting those who aided Mkwawa to the death penalty. They tried setting up one of Mkwawa's brothers as chief, but had him executed after two months, holding him responsible for the continuing attacks on German patrols. It was only in July 1898, after being trapped, that Mkwawa shot himself. The Germans removed Mkwawa's head and sent it to Germany. Mkwawa and the Hehe had become so well known that a clause was inserted in the Treaty of Versailles ordering the skull be returned to Uhehe. It was found, not in Berlin, but in Bremen, and was finally returned, not to Iringa, but to nearby Kalenga, and then not until 1956. The identity of the skull is questionable. Mkwawa still today has the status of a national hero in Tanzania, even after over one hundred years. The Wahehe never again revolted, not during or after Maji Maji, but bureaucrats from Tanzania are still very wary of them. Energy, power, suspicion, intelligence, and a need for a strong hand are still viewed as their characteristics today.

The Lenape Stone is a piece of slate found in Bucks County, Pennsylvania in 1872, which appears to depict Native Americans hunting a woolly mammoth. This image, however, seems to have been carved some time after the stone was broken into two; for this and other reasons, it is generally considered an archaeological forgery. History The first portion of the stone is reported to have been found in Bucks County by Barnard Hansell, a farmer, in the spring of 1872. In 1881, Hansell sold the fragment to Henry Paxon, a young man with an interest in Native American artifacts. A few months later, Hansell reported finding the second piece of the stone in the same field where he had unearthed the first. Once the two pieces were joined, they were examined by members of the Bucks County Historical Society, including archaeologist and historian Henry Chapman Mercer. Despite evidence which cast doubt on the stone's origin, Mercer came to be an ardent proponent of its authenticity, an argument which he put forth in his 1885 book, The Lenape Stone, or the Indian and the Mammoth. However, even Mercer acknowledged that the stone's unique nature and a lack of physical evidence (such as soil samples) made scientific certainty impossible. The stone is currently housed at the Mercer Museum in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. The Lenape Stone - both sides Physical description The Lenape Stone is a small piece of slate, about long, and is hypothesised to have been a gorget, a type of ornamental necklace. Supporting this theory are the two holes drilled into the stone which would have enabled it to be worn about the neck. The stone comprises two fragments, each of which is decorated with clear engravings on both sides; they form a complete picture when the two halves are joined. On one side there are numerous depictions of turtles, fish, birds, and snakes. The reverse side shows an elephant-like creature, apparently a mammoth, along with humanoid figures, a forest, some teepees, and other markings. The humanoid figures are engaged in battle with the mammoth, and one even appears to have been trampled by it. Authenticity There is much evidence against the authenticity of the Lenape Stone. Mammoths are thought to have become extinct in North America around 10,000 years ago, while most gorgets uncovered in archaeological digs are less than 2,000 years old. In addition, other artifacts found in the same field as the Lenape Stone bore stylistically similar carvings, and these were all dated to around 2,000 years ago. There were no witnesses to verify the circumstances under which either fragment of the stone was found, and after it was found, the stone was cleaned multiple times, making geological tests virtually impossible. The carvings on each half of the stone appear not to match up perfectly, which may indicate that they were made after the stone was broken. The stone, therefore, was probably a forgery, the motive for which may have been money, as the stone was sold soon after its discovery.

These fishes represent a remarkable adaptive radiation of offshore and deep-water adapted fish descended from ancestral shallow water forms. They include the dominant zooplankton-feeding fish of the offshore and deep-water regions of the lake, as well as a number of larger species that appear to feed on small pelagic fishes. Adult sizes range from 10 to 30 cm in total length, depending on species.  Reproductive biology  Females and immature fish are silvery, like typical pelagic fish, but mature males develop stronger breeding colours, typically contrasting patterns of black, white and yellow. Females of several species have been found carrying eggs and young in their mouths and it is likely that all species are maternal mouthbrooders, like all other known haplochromine cichlids. Males in breeding dress with ripe gonads are often collected together in large numbers, along with a few ripe and mouthbrooding females, suggesting that these fishes gather together to breed in particular areas. Most species seem to breed between February and August. Females lay very few eggs- ranging on average from 16 to 40 in species examined. However, the eggs are very large - around 5-7mm in diameter. In common with other offshore-living cichlid fishes, these have evolved to have fewer, but larger offspring, perhaps to increase their chances of surviving predation and starvation in the open water habitats. Unlike some other offshore cichlid fish, none of the Diplotaxodon species are known to use inshore nursery areas for their young, and their entire life-cycle seems to be completed in the open waters of the lake.  Evolution and population genetics  Molecular genetic studies suggest that Diplotaxodon species are all closely related and are ancestral to the more benthic-feeding Pallidochromis tokolosh, which together comprise a monophyletic group or clade which has evolved within Lake Malawi. Population genetic studies indicate that similar-looking forms with different male breeding colours represent distinct species. In marked contrast to the better known rocky shore 'mbuna' cichlids which are split into many geographically isolated populations on particular islands or rocky coastal regions, molecular studies indicate that there are few barriers to the movement and interbreeding of Diplotaxodon populations within the lake. This lack of geographic barriers in the present lake has made scientists consider that their species might have diverged either by the controversial mechanism of sympatric speciation. Alternatively, they may have diverged into new species when major droughts led to Lake Malawi partially drying up and forming 2 or more much smaller lakes.  Human exploitation  Diplotaxodon species are important food fish around the lake, being collected by a number of small- scale fishing methods, such as Chirimila seines and baited hooks, as well as by trawling. Although they represent a potentially very large fishery stock (100,000 tonnes), with a potentially sustainable fishery yield of around 20,000 tonnes, their populations are spread thinly in inaccessible deep-water and offshore habitats, making them difficult to exploit economically, although some seasonal fisheries seem to exploit them heavily on traditional breeding grounds. A single species (D. limnothrissa) has occasionally been collected and bred as an aquarium fish.

Harclay had one sister and six brothers; one of which also brings celebrity to the family name. Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle was a controversial figure in his time but was also known for his political and military accomplishments during the Anglo-Scottish wars in the early 14th century. Harclay's father Michael was a sheriff in the county of Cumberland between 1285 and 1298 (Harclay xvii). Harclay became a Master of the Arts at the University of Oxford by the time he was twenty-six (Pasnau 882). In that same year of 1296, the Bishop of Carlisle appointed him to be the Rector of the church at Dacre on Christmas Day. He remained a secular theologian until 1297 when he was ordained as a priest. (Harclay xviii). Shortly after these events, Henry of Harclay left to study theology at the University of Paris. The dates for Harclay's studies at the University of Paris are most likely between 1300 and 1310 (Harclay xix). Henry went back to Oxford where he became a Master of Theology sometime before 1312 (Pasnau 882). Henry of Harclay was also declared Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1312, a position he held until his death in 1317.

The Bishop of Lincoln, John Dalderby, confirmed Henry of Harclay as the Chancellor of the University of Oxford. Harclay was very active and devotedly attentive towards \\"maintaining the order of the university\\" (M.G. Henninger 305).Henninger, Mark G. \\"Henry of Harclay.\\" A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages. Ed. Jorge J. E. Gracia and Timothy B. Noone. Malden: Blackwell, 2003. Print. A highly contentious and bitter controversy arose during his tenure as chancellor between him and the Dominicans over the confirmation of certain privileges accorded to the university by the king. These included King Edward II‚Äôs decree that the mayor of Oxford \\"admit the chancellor and procurators of the university to the periodic testing of beer\\" (M.G. Henninger 305). These controversies sparked Henry's travelling to the papal court in Avignon several times to defend the universities privileges, and to reach an agreement with the Dominicans. Harclay died on one of these trips in Avignon on 25 June 1317 (M.G. Henninger 305). Harclay played an important role in Oxford and Paris during the first two decades of the 14th century. While in Paris, he produced a commentary on book I of the Sentences of Peter Lombard, and perhaps a reportatio of lectures from around 1300.Mark Henninger, \\"Henry of Harclay's Questions on Divine Prescience and Predestination,\\" Franciscan Studies 40 (1980), pp. 167‚Äì68. Harclay's \\"principle work is a wide-ranging, philosophically rich series of twenty-nine Quaestiones ordinariae\\" or Ordinary Questions (Pasnau, 882). Harclay's commentary on the Sentences has only been edited very partially as of now, and so most of what we know about his philosophical beliefs will come from his Ordinary Questions (Harclay xxii). Philosophy =Influences= At the University of Paris, Henry of Harclay studied theology under the philosopher John Duns Scotus,Anthony Kenny, Wyclif in His Times, Oxford UP, 1986, p. 35 n. 13. who strongly influenced Harclay's works. This influence is especially prevalent in Harclay's commentary on Peter Lombard's Sentences, where he \\"frequently uses Scotus's arguments and adopts many of his positions\\" (M.G. Henninger 305). Henninger points out however, that Henry was not just riding his mentor's coat tails but \\"offered independent criticisms which may have influenced Scotus's final edition of his own commentary\\" (M.G. Henninger 305). Questions concerning the eternity of the world were prevalent in philosophical discussion dating back to the thirteenth century, so it is not surprising that Henry of Harclay was influenced by these discussions and: \\"[W]as much occupied in his writing with the problem of the possible eternity of the world and with the properties of the infinite\\" (Dales 297). =Principal ideas= Harclay's most popular, and at the time of his writing, controversial, claims are those that concern ideas about the eternity of the world and the infinite, and the univocal concept of being. He attacked basic assumptions of those who argued the eternity of the world was impossible and that \\"all infinites are equal\\" (Dales 298). Harclay addresses these issues in Ordinary Questions XVIII and asks, \\"Could the world have existed from all eternity?\\" (Harclay 735). He presents three opposing theories, and supports the one that claims \\"the world and movement could have existed from all eternity\\" and states that \\"God [has] the power to do anything that is known not to include a contradiction or that is not known to include [one]\\" (Harclay 753). Harclay's argument for the univocal concept of being seeks to answer two questions: ‚Äúwhether there is anything univocally common between God and his creatures‚Ä¶and [whether the same is true] concerning substance and accident\\" (M. Henninger 206).Henninger, Mark. \\"Henry of Harclay and the Univocal Concept of Being.\\" Medieval Studies, Vol. 68 (2006): pp. 205‚Äì237. ;On the infinite and the eternity of the world Harclay addresses arguments against this such as that infinite time creates infinite souls and therefore infinite power (equal or greater than God's), and that greater and lesser infinites would ensue (Dales 298‚Äì299). He refutes the first by claiming: \\"An infinity of multitude is not inconsistent with souls, although an infinity of power would be‚Ä¶for all these souls taken together will not make one infinite power‚Ä¶therefore, [these] infinite souls do not constitute some species of number, but a multitude of infinite numbers‚Ä¶for it is a contradiction that one number contain every number‚Ä¶for then it would contain itself, which is impossible\\" (Harclay 757). Harclay believes he shows the possibility of greater and lesser infinites by referencing the revolutions of planets, and that \\"the quantity of four feet is not divisible into as many infinite parts of the same quantity of eight feet\\" (Harclay 769). These quantities are infinitely divisible, yet one would have \\"more parts of the same quantity in the double quantity‚Ä¶even if we carry on [dividing] to infinity\\" (Harclay 769). =On the univocal concept of being= Harclay believes it is necessary for there to be univocal concepts for it to be possible to make inquiries into God's nature. If things such as the definition of what it means to exist is equivocal between God and his creatures, then when we say \\"God exists\\" really we are just saying \\"God is God\\" so we have not proven anything and consequently are prevented from knowing anything about God (Harclay 461). Harclay continues until he reaches the conclusion that: [W]hatever formally pertains to God and to creatures is not ascribed equivocally, since comparison can be made [only] according to something common. (M. Henninger 215). As for substance and accidents, he says that univocal commonality is also present because this unity of relation is not a being (either substance or accident) but a concept. This is because if there is not a difference between \\"the concept of being predicated of a substance, and the concept of a substance\\" it would be impossible for anyone to distinguish between an accident of a substance and the substance itself (M. Henninger 215). References Bibliography ;Primary sources * Henry of Harclay. Ordinary Questions, –Ü-XIV. Edited by Mark G Henninger and translated by Raymond Edwards & Mark G. Henninger.

Theories of perception are supposed to help a researcher predict what will be perceived when senses are stimulated. A theory usually comprises a mathematical model (formula), rules for collecting physical measurements for input into the model, and rules for collecting physical measurements to which model outputs should map. When arbitrarily choosing valid input data, the model should reliably generate output data that is indistinguishable from that which is measured in the system being modeled. Although each theory may be useful for some limited predictions, theories of vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste are not typically reliable for comprehensive modeling of perception based on sensory inputs. A paradox illustrates where a theoretical prediction fails. Sometimes, even in the absence of a predictive theory, the characteristics of perception seem nonsensical. This page lists some paradoxes and seemingly impossible properties of perception. When an animal is not named in connection with the discussion, human perception should be assumed since the majority of perceptual research data applies to humans.  Terminology  ;SUN_{white} light: Normal white sunlight is black-body radiation containing a broad and largely featureless spectrum covering the entire range of human vision. ;RGB_{white} light: Televisions and computer screens fool the eye by generating photons of three narrow wavelength bands where the proportion of photons from industry standard (but improperly named) R (red), G (green), and B (blue) sources is known to be perceived as white.  Definition  A perceptual paradox, in its purest form is a statement illustrating the failure of a formula to predict what we perceive from what our senses transduce. { border=\\"1\\" Example: standard information theory limits spatial frequency based hyperacuity to a factor of approximately 4 over the spatial frequency of photoreceptor cells. Yet, reliable scientific journals have published reports of hyperacuity in excess of a factor of 10. } A seemingly nonsensical characteristic is a statement of factual observation that is sufficiently intractable that no theory has been proposed to account for it. { border=\\"1\\" Example: the optical path in an eye, from the cornea to the photoreceptors, goes through a non-spherical cornea and lens that refract and non-circular apertures that diffract such that, in a normal eye, the image on the retina for a point-source is an irregular color-fringed, color-eccentric coaxial bullseye-like pattern with many pathological properties, with the central bright feature covering many photoreceptors.Roorda, A. ‚ÄúA Review of Optics‚Äù chapter 2 in Wavefront Customized Visual Correction: The Quest for SuperVision II. (Macrae, S.M., Krueger, R.R., Applegate, R.A., ed). Slack Inc. Thorofare, NJ (2004) Yet, the point-source is perceived clearly, and can be discriminated from other such points as little distance away as 1/10 the visual angle of a photoreceptor. According to Roorda, in a \\"perfect\\" eye, a foveal cone subtends 30 arcseconds, and the diameter of the central \\"Airy\\" disk varies between 10 cones (1mm pupil used for reading) to about 1.5 cones (8mm pupil used during fight/flight response). }  Mathematical modeling  One branch of research into perception attempts to explain what we perceive by applying formulae to sensory inputs and expecting outputs similar to that which we perceive. For example: what we measure with our eyes should be predicted by applying formulae to what we measure with instruments that imitate our eye. Past researchers have made formulae that predict some, but not all, perceptual phenomena from their sensory origins. Modern researchers continue to make formulae to overcome the shortcomings of earlier formulae. Some formulae are carefully constructed to mimic actual structures and functions of sensory mechanisms. Other formulae are constructed by great leaps of faith about similarity in mathematical curves. No perceptual formulae have been raised to the status of \\"natural law\\" in the way that the laws of gravitation and electrical attraction have. So, perceptual formulae continue to be an active area of development as scientists strive towards the great insight required of a law.  History  Some Nobel laureates have paved the way with clear statements of good practice: In the preface to his Histology Histology of the Nervous System: Spanish edition Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal wrote that \\"Practitioners will only be able to claim that a valid explanation of a histological observation has been provided if three questions can be answered satisfactorily: what is the functional role of the arrangement in the animal; what mechanisms underlie this function; and what sequence of chemical and mechanical events during evolution and development gave rise to these mechanisms?\\" Allvar Gullstrand described the problems that arise when approaching the optics of the eye as if they were as predictable as camera optics. Charles Scott Sherrington, considered the brain to be the \\"crowning achievement of the reflex system\\", (which can be interpreted as opening all aspects of perception to simple formulae expressed over complex distributions).  Sensory Observations  * See:Visual * Hear:Auditory * Touch:Tactile * Smell:Olfactory * Taste:Gustatory * Electric  Perceptual Observations  * See:Visual * Hear:Auditory * Touch:Tactile * Smell:Olfactory * Taste:Gustatory * Electric  Statements of Paradox  = See:Visual = Contrast Invariance Boundaries between brighter and darker areas appear to remain of constant relative contrast when the ratio of logarithms of the two intensities remains constant: Contrast \\\\propto \\\\frac{log I_a}{log I_b} But the use of logarithms is forbidden for values that can become zero such as I_a\\\\,, and division is forbidden by values that can become zero such as log I_b\\\\,. No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of contrast invariance. 10 Decade Transduction Local Contrast Color Constancy When observing objects in a scene, colors appears constant. An apple looks red regardless of where it is viewed. In bright direct sunshine, under a blue sky with the sun obscured, during a colorful sunset, under a canopy of green leaves, and even under most man-made light sources, the color of the apple remains unchanging. Color perception appears to be independent of light wavelength. Edwin Land demonstrated this by illuminating a room with two wavelengths of light of approximately 500 nm and 520 nm (both improperly called \\"green\\"). The room was perceived in full color, with all colors appearing unattenuated, like red, orange, yellow, blue, and purple, despite the absence of photons other than two close to 510 nm. Note that RGB_{white} light misuses the terminology RGB since color is a perception and there are no such things as Red, Green, or Blue photons. Jerome Lettvin wrote an article in the Scientific American 1986 The colors of things, Scientific American, Vol.255.3, pp. 84-91; (with Brou, Philippe, Sciascia, and Linden) illustrating the importance of boundaries and vertices in the perception of color. Yet, no published formula predicts the perceived color of objects in a single image of arbitrary scene illumination. Transverse Chromatic Deaberration Light that goes through a simple lens such as found in an eye undergoes refraction, splitting colors. An RGB_{white} point-source that is off-center to the eye projects to a pattern where with color separation along a line radial to the central axis of the eye. The color separation can be many photoreceptors wide. Yet, an RGB_{white} pixel on a television or computer screen appears white even when seen sidelong. No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of the eccentric white pixel. Longitudinal Chromatic Deaberration As in Transverse Chromatic Deaberration, color splitting projects also projects the R, G, and B components of the RGB_{white} pixel to different focal lengths, resulting in a bulls-eye-like color distribution of light even at the center of vision. No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of the centered white pixel. Spherical Deaberration Eyes have corneas and lenses that are imperfectly spherical. This inhomogeneous shape results in a non-circular distribution of photons on the retina. No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of the non- circularly distributed white pixel. Hyperacuity People report discrimination much finer than can be predicted by interpolating sense data between photosensors. High performing hyperacute vision in some people has been measured to less than a tenth the radius of a single photoreceptor. Among measures of hyperacuity are the vernier discrimination of two adjacent lines and the discrimination of two stars in a night sky. No published neuroanatomical model predicts the discrimination of the two white pixels closer together than a single photoreceptor. Pupil Size Inversion When pupils are narrowed to around 1mm for reading fine print, the size of the central \\"Airy\\" disk increases to a diameter of 10 photoreceptors. The so- called \\"blur\\" is increased for reading. When pupils are widened for fight/flight response, the size of the central \\"Airy\\" disk decreases to a diameter of about 1.5 photoreceptors. The so-called \\"blur\\" is decreased in anticipation of large movements. No published neuroanatomical model predicts that discrimination improves when pupils are narrowed. Pupil Shape Inversion Eyes have pupils (apertures) that cause diffraction. A point-source of light is distributed on the retina. The distribution for a perfectly circular aperture is known by the name \\"Airy rings\\". Human pupils are rarely perfectly circular. Cat pupils range from almost circular to a vertical slit. Goat pupils tend to be horizontal rectangular with rounded corners. Gecko pupils range from circular, to a slit, to a series of pinholes. Cuttlefish pupils have complex shapes. No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of the various pupil shape distributed white pixel. = Hear:Auditory = = Touch:Tactile = = Smell:Olfactory = One paradoxical perception concerning the sense of smell is the theory of one's own ability to smell.

It was the largest regiment to serve in the Union Army, with over 5,000 officers and enlisted men in its ranks at one time or another - in fact, while it was recruiting, there were so many applicants that another regiment was created to take the excess men: the 2nd Pennsylvania Provisional Artillery.Williams History Recruitment for the regiment started in October 1861 from the city of Philadelphia and the counties of Franklin, Allegheny, and Monroe. Charles Angeroth was the regiment's first colonel, John H. Oberteuffer, Sr. was the lieutenant colonel, and William Candidus was the major. Ten companies were mustered in on January 8, 1862, and ordered to Washington, D.C. They spent the next two years constructing and garrisoning various fortifications around the city, including Fort Stevens. Angeroth resigned in June 1862 and was replaced by Augustus A. Gibson of the 2nd U.S. Artillery as colonel. Candidus also resigned in August and was replaced by James L. Anderson. In November, two more companies were added to the regiment, raising the total strength to 1,800 men in twelve companies. In February 1863, the regiment was formally assigned to the XXII Corps, Department of Washington, first as part of the 1st Brigade, Haskins' Division, and later of the 1st Brigade, DeRussy's Division. So many recruits joined the regiment that by the spring of 1864, it numbered over 3,300 officers and enlisted men. Since the army needed troops at the front lines, on April 20, the War Department ordered the \\"surplus\\" officers and men to form a second regiment, the 2nd Pennsylvania Provisional Heavy Artillery. This provisional regiment was sent to the Army of the Potomac as part of the IX Corps. The original regiment was assigned to that army as well on May 27 as part of the XVIII Corps. It arrived at Cold Harbor on June 4 but did not participate in the battle. Too large to operate as a single unit, it was divided into three four-company battalions. The 2nd saw its first battle on July 15, when the XVIII Corps made some of the first assaults in the Siege of Petersburg. Gibson was replaced on July 21 by Anderson.According to pa- roots.com, Gibson had resigned. Williams, on the other hand, writes that Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin had him relieved for \\"unspecified reasons.\\" The regiment fought in several battles and skirmishes for the next several months, often losing heavily. For example, it lost 465 men at the Battle of Chaffin's Farm alone. Its losses were replaced somewhat by the consolidation of the 2nd Provisional Regiment back into the original regiment. During an attack on Fort Harrison, Anderson was killed and Sadler was captured. With no field officers left, new ones were appointed from the company commanders. Captain William M. McClure of Company F was appointed colonel, Captain S. D. Strawbridge lieutenant colonel, and Captain Benjamin F. Winger, major. In January 1865, the regiment reenlisted and, with additional recruits, numbered 2,000 officers and men. McClure was honorably discharged on March 7. Strawbridge succeeded him to command of the regiment, Winger was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Captains David Schooley and William S. Bailey to major. After the breakthrough at Petersburg on April 2, it was assigned to provost duty in the city. After the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Court House, the companies were scattered around southeastern Virginia to maintain order. The 2nd was finally mustered out on January 29, 1866, at City Point, Virginia, and was discharged at Philadelphia on February 16.

Serving professionals in film, theatre, television, music, opera, radio and dance, the Fund‚Äôs programs include social services and emergency financial assistance, healthcare and insurance counseling, supportive and affordable housing, and employment and training services. The Fund owns and operates the Lillian Booth Actors Home, a skilled nursing and assisted living facility in Englewood, New Jersey. History The Actors Fund of America was founded by Albert Marshman Palmer on June 8, 1882, largely due to the efforts of former New York University student Harrison Grey Fiske, editor of the New York Dramatic Mirror, who was aware of the many problems faced by those in the profession. The Actors Fund's first meeting was held in the theatre of president J. Lester Wallack. The Actor's Fund's first officers were Lester Wallack, president; Albert M. Palmer, vice president; Daniel Frohman, secretary; and Theodore More, treasurer.\\"Actors' Fund of America: Officers Elected and Suggestions Offered to Be Acted Upon Hereafter\\". The New York Times. July 16, 1882. p. 12. The original bylaws said that the organization existed to \\"foster and benefit the physical, as well as advance the intellectual, welfare of the actors of America.\\"\\"The Actors' Fund Trustees: Mr. Jefferson Sends $500 to Atone for Absence\\". The New York Times. July 19, 1882. p. 8. Funds raised at the 1892 Fair, held at Madison Square Garden, enabled the charity to provide individuals and families with assistance, including burial plots in a Brooklyn cemetery and accommodations in the Actors' Fund Home. During the next decades, benefit performances held throughout the country raised significant amounts of revenue to subsidize the Fund's many projects. Today, the Fund sponsors many special events and performances, with numerous Broadway stars and Hollywood celebrities hosting, performing, and attending. Theatres throughout the country frequently pledge proceeds from regularly scheduled performances to the charity. Offices are maintained in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Additionally, the Fund is associated with a range of sister organizations which raise money through donations, including Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, the guild/union relief funds of Actors' Equity, AFTRA; AGMA; AGVA; Episcopal Actors' Guild; the Jazz Foundation; the Professional Dancers Society; MusiCares, Society of Singers, and the Lambs. In 1997, the Actors' Work Program (AWP) was incorporated into the Actors Fund's full spectrum of services. Today, the Actors Fund Work Program (AWP) assists entertainment industry and performing arts professionals in identifying and finding sideline work and new careers. The Fund in New York also hosts a weekly creative writing workshop held on Thursdays for disabled and senior citizen performers. The Fund operates the Dorothy Ross Friedman Residence (formerly the Aurora), a site which provides supportive housing to special low-income groups including seniors, working professionals and people living with AIDS. The Dorothy Ross Friedman Residence opened in 1996 (as the Aurora) and the Actors Fund provides on-site social services for residents. The social services group provides information and referral to community resources, entitlement program advocacy, coordination of home care and medical services, outreach, health education and support groups. The on-site social services staff includes two social workers, three case managers, and an activities coordinator. The Actors Fund developed this supportive housing project with its partner, the Related Companies. The Actors Fund's Palm View residence is a similar residential facility, located in West Hollywood, California. The Palm View, opened in 1998, is a 40-unit apartment complex that provides homes to low-income people with HIV/AIDS. The Palm View is a collaborative project between the Actors Fund, the West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation, Housing for Entertainment Professionals and various funders. The buildings are managed by the West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation. The Fund also owns and operates the Lillian Booth Actors Home, in Englewood, New Jersey, a nursing home and assisted living care facility for retired members of the entertainment community. The home is licensed by the Department of Health and qualifies for Medicaid and Medicare. Individuals who have dedicated a major portion of their professional lives to the entertainment industry are eligible for admission. The Actors Fund provides funds to subsidize the care residents receive. One of the earliest services the Actors Fund provided was assistance with the cost and arrangements of funerals and burials. In 1886, the Actors Fund purchased its first plot at the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York and, in 1904, a second plot was purchased at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. These plots are the final resting place of over 2,000 members of the entertainment industry. Today, the Fund continues to assist with the cost of funerals and provide a grave site with a head stone to those in need. In addition, the Fund offers pre-pay arrangements for those interested in purchasing a grave site. In 2014, Fund President and CEO Joseph P. Benincasa received the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre for outstanding contribution to the theatrical community for 25 years service to the Fund.  Services  The Fund‚Äôs programs include social services and emergency financial assistance, healthcare and insurance counseling, supportive and affordable housing, and employment and training services. Merger with Career Transition for Dancers On September 21, 2015, the organization announced that it would merge with Career Transition for Dancers. The former activities of Career Transition for Dancers will thereafter be carried on as an operation of the Actors Fund. The Samuel J. Friedman Health Center for the Performing Arts In March, 2017, the Actors Fund opened the Samuel J. Friedman Health Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. This facility (located at 729 Seventh Avenue and 49th street in the heart of the theater district) is in partnership with Mount Sinai Hospital and offers medical care for everyone in entertainment.

Opened in 1959 as an open-air shopping center, Springdale Mall was later redeveloped as an enclosed shopping center. Facing competition from larger shopping centers in the area, Springdale was demolished in stages in the 2000s, with most of the former enclosed mall being replaced with big-box stores. Springdale is almost entirely an open-air center again, featuring Bed Bath & Beyond, Big Lots, Burke's Outlet, Burlington Coat Factory, Cost Plus World Market, Marshalls, Michaels, Sam's Club, and Shoe Station as anchor stores. The center is managed and owned by Brixmor. History Opened in November 1959 as an open-air regional shopping center, Springdale was initially anchored by W.T. Grant, JCPenney and two supermarkets: Delchamps and National.Mobile, Alabama Telephone Directory - October 1959 Edition Gayfers, a Mobile-based department store, would serve as the flagship anchor upon its completion in the summer of 1960. Competition would arrive in late 1967 in the form of Bel Air Mall, an enclosed mall which was anchored by Sears and Hammel's. JCPenney relocated to Bel Air Mall in 1974. An enclosed wing was completed in 1974, adjacent to the east end of the Gayfers building; this wing was anchored by Montgomery Ward and a six-screen movie theater (later expanded to eleven screens). In October 1988, Toys \\"R\\" Us co-tenanted the Montgomery Ward building. A second enclosed wing was added November 1989, leading from Gayfers to an existing McRae's store that opened August 1984. This \\"west mall\\" featured more nationally known in-line retailers such as The Limited, Express and Victoria's Secret. During this same late 1980s time frame, Gayfers expanded to more than on three levels, becoming one of the largest department store buildings in the Gulf Coast region. After the completion of the west wing, the mall comprised two separate enclosed wings, as well as the original, remodeled 1950s open-air wing. Springdale Mall both inside and out was featured in a motorcycle chase sequence in the 1994 film Raw Justice. Barnes & Noble debuted its first South Alabama location in Springdale in the spring of 1994, followed by Old Navy, which opened its first Alabama store here, two years later, in the fall of 1996. Renovations Springdale Mall was purchased in 1997 by CBL & Associates Properties. In August 1998, Mercantile Stores, the owners of Gayfers and a host of regional department store nameplates, was purchased by Arkansas-based Dillard's. Although a full-line Dillard's was present across the street in Bel Air Mall, Dillard's initially maintained the former Gayfers at Springdale as a full-line Dillard's as well. Also in 1998, Montgomery Ward closed its doors at Springdale Mall; the former Montgomery Ward space was later replaced with Burlington Coat Factory. The adjacent Toys \\"R\\" Us store was also shuttered in favor of a newer store nearby. Throughout the late 1990s and into the 2000s, several more big-box stores were added to the mall's tenant roster. The first of these, Goody's Family Clothing, was added in 1998, followed by Staples and Linens 'n Things, both of which took up portions of the east mall. The former \\"west mall\\" from McRae's to Dillard's was gutted in 2001 for a Best Buy while Dillard's itself closed a year later. By 2004, the former Dillard's was demolished, as was part of the mall's original enclosed wing; Staples, Linens 'n Things, Springdale Cinema and one in-line tenant space were all retained, as was the mall corridor leading to the theater entry. The year 2005 was a time of transition, as on the site formerly occupied by Dillard's, a Sam's Club wholesale warehouse was constructed, McRae's was acquired by Belk, and the Springdale Cinema was shuttered. In 2008, Springdale Plaza would lose both the Goody's Family Clothing and Linens 'n Things anchors, as those chains succumbed to bankruptcy. Man Style, the only remaining store inside the enclosed east wing, moved to an outparcel on the property around this time as well. The enclosed wing is inaccessible to the public. Barnes & Noble closed its Springdale Plaza location at the end of June 2010, after not being able to reach an agreement on the terms of its lease. Soon after, FYE closed their Springdale location, while still maintaining a store in Bel Air Mall across the street. Discount retailer Big Lots renovated the former Linens 'n Things location and opened in November 2010. Fashion retailer Marshalls opened in the renovated Goody's space Fall of 2010. This new store, a relocation from the nearby Mobile Festival Centre power center, is nearly in size. Arts & crafts retailer Michaels relocated into the former Barnes & Noble space in September 2011. Like Marshalls, they also vacated their former location at the Mobile Festival Centre. The renovated location is oriented towards Airport Blvd. Right next door, beauty retailer Ulta moved into the former FYE space in order to open a new store in the fall of 2011. Vacancies and Redevelopment With the ongoing renovation of Bel Air Mall into The Shoppes of Bel Air, Sears left the mall in September 2015 and was replaced by a Belk flagship store a year later. The Springdale location of Belk closed before the opening of the Belk Flasgship. This was redeveloped into smaller stores in 2018. In addition, Best Buy constructed a new store at the brand new McGowin Park shopping center nearby and moved out of Springdale in January 2016. Old Navy also constructed a new location in McGowin Park as well and moved out in March 2016. Staples Inc. closed its Mobile location on mid-January 2017 and remains vacant. In Spring 2018, it was announced that the whole two-level McRae's/Belk space will be renovated to make room for Bed Bath & Beyond, Cost Plus World Market, and Shoe Station which is set to move from its founding building near The Shoppes of Bel Air; leaving the upper floor vacant. Bed Bath & Beyond (which moved from Festival Centre) and Cost Plus World Market opened in November 2018. Burke's Outlet renovated the former Old Navy location and opened in September 27, 2018. Burlington Coat Factory relocated into the former Best Buy space as Burlington in Spring 2019, leaving Big Lots the last suriving store in the vacant mall portion of this shopping center.

The game was released in March 2005 in South Korea and October 2006 in North America and Europe, receiving poor reviews from the gaming press. In August 2007, ArchLord became free-to-play to coincide with the release of the first episodic expansion pack, Season of Siege. The second expansion, Spirits Awakening, was released in August 2008. From August 2009, Webzen published Archlord in additional countries where Codemasters did not have rights to distribute the game. From October 3, 2009, Webzen maintained Archlord globally, offering the seventh expansion, called Heaven & Hell. On December 6, 2013, Webzen announced the closing of ArchLord, the game has been shut down since January 1, 2014. Gameplay ArchLord uses a crafting system, which allows players to upgrade items in a unique way as well as allows players to carve, skin and ransack any defeated monster. The materials achieved using carving, skinning and ransacking skills are used in Alchemy and Cooking to create powerup items. Alchemy creates metamorphosis potions which allows a player to transform into monsters, whereas cooking allows a player to create food which give statistic bonuses, e.g. defense buff. There is an advanced market system employed in this game for ease of trading between players. One of the features of ArchLord is the ability to compete to become the ArchLord, the ruler of the game world. Only one ArchLord can exist on each server, reigning for four weeks before he/she is challenged by other players for the position. The ArchLord has access to a castle, a unique dragon mount, control of the weather and other features. Plot ArchLord is set on the continent of Chantra and features four playable races; Orcs, Humans, Moon Elves and the new DragonScion. Orcs begin their quests in the Golunndo, Humans begin in Anchorville, Moon Elves begin in Norine, and DragonScions in Cien. They all have access to three classes except for the DragonScion that from level 20 evolves to one of the three races. The Humans first appeared in Chantra 1000 years after the Orcs had settled. Following the dramatic sinking of their land, key pioneers in Human society initially established a foothold in the Western part of the continent known as Chantra. History suggests they were able to do so due to their ability to handle fire. In the early stages, Humans lived in relative peace. However, they soon began to realize that Orcs had landed on the Eastern part of the continent and before long tensions were raised as the Humans became protective of their territory. Humans have a relatively short lifespan, with 80 years considered to be long. Humans also have an inferior breeding capacity when compared to Orcs, with the average number of offspring being three. Humans can be Archers, Knights, and Mages. The Orcs have occupied the land of Chantra for a 1000 years longer than the Humans. For this reason, the Orcs held themselves in higher regard than their Human counterparts and enslaved them for 500 years. Over time the Humans rebelled against their Orc masters and eventually won their freedom. 500 years later the continent was struck by a huge earthquake, which caused much of it to sink into the ocean. Humans and Orcs were forced to flee the western continent of Chantra. Under the leadership of Ugdrasil, the Orcs colonized a small part of the continent where they began the re-building process. Orcs can be Berserkers, Sorcerers and Hunters. The Moon Elves are a race that were once considered Elves, but different. Once one of three of the great elf races that inhabited the Nordenland during the 2nd period, they were the first race to fall in the Great War. As a result of this devastating conflict most of the male population was annihilated. A few males were able to escape together with the women; they hid themselves in the shadows from those in the outside world. As time went on, the women took it upon themselves to replace the male roles in their society, and thus learned to master the fine arts of hunting and craftsmanship. The few remaining men were forbidden to enter combat, as they were too precious a commodity. Through a cruel twist of fate the remaining men only seemed capable of producing more women. This forced the Moon Elves to step from their shadowy world and start exploring for additional breeding options; this is how they came to be known by the Orcs and Humans. They were so ashamed of this action that they chose to hide themselves in the dark for centuries, only revealing themselves once their land was invaded by the Orcs and Humans. Moon Elves can be Swashbucklers, Rangers, and Elementalists. The Dragon Scion was the last of the 4 races to arrive at the continent of Chantra. They were created from the skin and bone of the great dragon 'Mightthesis' 2000 years ago, after their creation they roamed the world for 1000 years, searching for a place to settle down, finally reaching the continent of Chantra. DragonScions can evolve to Slayers, Orbiters and Summoners. Service Transition Due to failure to reach an agreement with NHN, Codemasters was unable to renew their license for ArchLord, no longer able to provide the game to European and North American customers. As of September 1, 2009, all credit purchases have been disabled, CM accounts transferred to the new provider and the game servers shut down on October 2, 2009. On October 3, 2009, the game was turned over to Webzen, a Korean publisher. Critical reception ArchLord received poor ratings; GameSpot criticized the repetitive and tedious gameplay, blurry graphics and lackluster audio, shallow quest and crafting system, and the hours of repetitive combat required to get to Player versus player and high-level content. The reviewer's only positive comment was that ArchLord offered familiar role-playing gameplay of \\"kill, loot, buy stuff\\", overall awarding a \\"terrible\\" rating of 2.7 out of 10. Eurogamer awarded 4 out of 10, criticizing the lack of visual distinction between the power levels of monsters, with trial and error required to progress; a lack of other players, with those present not offering any legible dialogue; atrocious controls that caused the reviewer's character to get stuck on scenery; interesting-sounding features (castle sieges, for example) being restricted to higher levels; and a user interface that's \\"like using Windows 95 with a migraine.\\" Manhwa An ancillary manhwa created by Korean author Park Jin-hwan goes by the same name. The ArchLord manhwa was first released in South Korea on September 30, 2005. Tokyopop released an English version in 2007. The manhwa follows the adventures of a human named Zian and his friend, a half-orc named Ugdrasil, who find themselves in the midst of a thousand year old conflict for control of five mysterious relics known as Archons. Popular culture The game plays a fairly significant role in the Belgian-Dutch drama film Ben X (2007).

Specifically, if each leaf is conceptually represented by a small flat plate, its orientation can be described with the zenith and the azimuth angles of the surface normal to that plate. If the leaf has a complex structure and is not flat, it may be necessary to approximate the actual leaf by a set of small plates, in which case there may be a number of leaf normals and associated angles. The LAD describes the statistical distribution of these angles. Examples of Leaf Angle Distributions Different plant canopies exhibit different LADs: For instance, grasses and willows have their leaves largely hanging vertically (such plants are said to have an erectophile LAD), while oaks tend to maintain their leaves more or less horizontally (these species are known as having a planophile LAD). In some tree species, leaves near the top of the canopy follow an erectophile LAD while those at the bottom of the canopy are more planophile. This may be interpreted as a strategy by that plant species to maximize exposure to light, an important constraint to growth and development. Yet other species (notably sunflower) are capable of reorienting their leaves throughout the day to optimize exposure to the Sun: this is known as heliotropism. Importance of LAD The LAD of a plant canopy has a significant impact on the reflectance, transmittance and absorption of solar light in the vegetation layer, and thus also on its growth and development. LAD can also serve as a quantitative index to monitor the state of the plants, as wilting usually results in more erectophile LADs. Models of radiation transfer need to take this distribution into account to predict, for instance, the albedo or the productivity of the canopy. Measuring LAD Accurately measuring the statistical properties of leaf angle distributions is not a trivial matter, especially for small leaves. Clinometers can be used but may be rather bulky or inconvenient. Most leaves are quite light and tend to move with the slightest breeze or air turbulence. Nevertheless, when these environmental conditions are suitable or can be controlled, it is possible to acquire data on leaf orientation. This may be done, for instance, with a Spatial Coordinate Apparatus, which is an articulated mechanical device capable or recording the position in three-dimensional space of three separate points forming a small triangle. The orientation of the triangle is computed from these coordinates. Yet another approach is to use a laser scanner: this instrument can record the angular and distance coordinates of the intersection of a laser beam with objects within its range. The LAD of canopy leaves can be derived from such measurements. Extensive data sets of LAD have been recorded, especially during intensive field campaigns, such as the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) or the SAFARI 2000 field campaign. See the external links below for getting access to these data. LAD functions In general, LAD are modelled with one- or two-parameters functions including ellipsoidal, rotated- ellipsoidal and Beta functions. Comparison between different LAD functions with in-situ measurements show that, two-parameter functions (especially Beta function) may perform better than one-parameter functions. References * J.

The mall, which operated from 1969 to 1999, featured a Spanish architectural motif. In the 1990s, the mall lost shoppers and both of its anchors, particularly to the Scottsdale Fashion Square center, which was closer to population growth in the city. The last anchor, Sears, left Los Arcos for Fashion Square in February 1999. The property then became the subject of years of highly controversial development proposals, including a proposed arena for the Phoenix Coyotes hockey team that ended amid infighting between the developer and the city, and a proposed retail redevelopment that crumbled in the face of heavy neighborhood opposition. After both of these plans failed, the site was sold to the Arizona State University Foundation and redeveloped as SkySong, a technology and innovation-focused complex with office, retail, and residential components. Mall history =Opening= After construction began in October 1968, Los Arcos Mall opened formally on November 21, 1969, though two of its anchor stores‚ÄîSears and Broadway-Hale Stores‚Äîopened on October 20. When the mall formally opened, just 30 of the 70 inline tenants were open for business. The mall featured a Spanish interior design by the Los Angeles architectural firm of Burke, Kober, Nicolais and Archuleta, with murals of Native Americans painted by Mexican artist Jos√© Mar√≠a Serv√≠n and a gazebo made in Mexico City as major design features. The Broadway store was designed by Charles Luckman. Los Arcos was the first enclosed mall developed by Phoenix-based Westcor Partners Russ Lyon Jr. and John L. Holmes; the two had previously worked together to build Tower Plaza, an open-air center. It cost $6 million to build (not counting the cost of the department stores), and was built on of land. The cross-shaped, air-conditioned, enclosed mall was anchored by a , $2.2 million, three-story Broadway Southwest on the east end. A , $6.1 million Sears anchored the south end, consisting of two floors and a full basement, as well as a Sears auto center in an outbuilding. Both department stores were the third metro Phoenix locations in their respective chains. Among the inline tenants was a movie theater on the lower level; three out-parcel buildings were built for the two anchors' automotive centers and a First Federal Savings and Loan office. =Decline= The first signs of decline came in 1979 when the -plus Fiesta Mall opened in Mesa with four major department stores, including both of the anchor tenants of Los Arcos. During the 1980s and 1990s, Scottsdale Fashion Square, three miles to the north of the Los Arcos site, went through several expansions and renovations and began to serve as Scottsdale's regional mall. While several retailers, such as Sam Goody and Express, had locations at both malls, retailers increasingly began to open their stores at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Additionally, growth in Scottsdale had spread northward, with several newer and closer shopping options to that area; in comparison, Papago Park, the Salt River and Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community hemmed in growth prospects for the trading area around Los Arcos. Lyon and Holmes sold the mall to Equity Properties of Chicago in 1988; the new owners immediately planned the mall's first major renovation. The next year, construction began to turn Los Arcos into \\"a mall of the '90s\\": the project included an extensive interior renovation, adding tile floors, skylights, and new interior decorations; the second phase added a 280-seat enclosed food court. The work also added fire sprinklers and removed asbestos. By 1995, however, the mall was ailing, suffering from losing business to Scottsdale Fashion Square. That year, Federated Department Stores purchased The Broadway; most stores were converted to Macy's, but doubt was immediately cast on the future of the Los Arcos location. Equity Properties asked the city of Scottsdale to consider loaning it money to buy the store building from the chain in the event that it closed. The store's closure was announced that November. After the closure of The Broadway, the city of Scottsdale declared the mall a redevelopment zone; Equity said that it had lost $25 million attempting to save the development, which included an attempt to convert it to a power center featuring a Home Depot store. Hockey arena proposal Equity had put the mall up for sale in 1995, but it was not until the end of 1996 that a potential buyer emerged: the Phoenix-based Ellman Companies, which paid $14 million for the mall and former Broadway‚Äîbut not the Sears, which continued operating.{cite newsvia=Newspapers.comurl=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/58330383/accessdate=August 30, 2020date=January 9, 1997title=Scottsdale mall gets new ownerwork=Arizona Republicfirst=Catherinelast=Reagorpages=E1, E8}} In August 1997, Ellman announced its plans for the mall property, which included a new movie theater anchoring a mixed-use complex. That same month, Sears announced its intention to move to Scottsdale Fashion Square. The Ellman Companies later stated that the anchors' refusal to consider the site changed its renovation plans into redevelopment plans. A year later, Ellman presented three revised plans. One of them was for a $140 million hockey arena to house the Phoenix Coyotes of the National Hockey League, along with proposals for a power center and an updated version of the 1997 concept. The plan including the arena and power center survived and was unveiled to the public on September 28, with a cost of $600 million. The hockey team cited obstructed view seats at America West Arena, a venue built primarily for basketball, as a reason to pursue a new arena. The plans became the subject of heated debate. At the first public meeting, an overflow crowd of opponents and supporters gathered. Opponents feared impacts on the surrounding community and opposed a proposal to use state sales tax revenues to pay for part of the project. The two sides started dueling petition drives. Meanwhile, Sears closed on February 13, and many remaining stores used co-tenancy clauses in their leases to exit the mall at the same time. The first major hurdle was a May 18, 1999, vote to allow Scottsdale to form a stadium district with at least one other Maricopa County municipality to pay for the project. The measure passed by a margin of 63 percent to 37 percent with near-record turnout, and, with Avondale joining as a stadium district partner, the path was clear to set up the district and send the sales tax proposal to voters in November. While backers of the measure celebrated, the physical condition of the Los Arcos property began to deteriorate, with visible neglect in landscaping. Approaching the November 1999 state sales tax vote, Ellman announced a proposal to recapture all city tax funds generated by the Los Arcos property for 30 years, prompting concerns of an overly large public subsidy. That measure passed as well, giving the developers 23 months to get the arena ready in time for its planned opening for the 2001‚Äì02 NHL season. However, the project hit a major snag when Coyotes owner Richard Burke and Ellman disagreed over financing and a construction timeline that would not see the team move in until the 2002‚Äì03 season; as a result, Burke put the team up for sale. In a move that seemingly put the Los Arcos project back on track, Steve Ellman bought the team for $87 million in a deal approved by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman in April 2000. The contract contained a clause allowing Ellman to sell or move the team after the 2001 season if the arena project did not materialize. After a salvage auction was held in February, demolition began in May 2000, though the Red Robin restaurant on the outside planned to remain as long as it could, along with two bank outparcels. The Red Robin had sued Ellman for breaking promises that they would be included in the redevelopment; the business continued to operate while SWAT teams practiced on the partially demolished structure. Ellman remained confident that the project would open in 2002. However city leaders saw documentation from Ellman that showed he planned to sell the Los Arcos complex a decade after it was completed for a $225 million profit; Scottsdale officials argued that money should also go to taxpayers. By October, Ellman had told Scottsdale city manager Jan Dolan that he was beginning to scout other sites. As this was happening, the sale of the NHL franchise to Ellman and minority owner Wayne Gretzky was continually delayed. Early in 2001, Ellman suggested scaling back the overall project. Former state attorney general Grant Woods was enlisted to keep the project alive and lobby for needed time extensions as Ellman launched a media blitz. The Scottsdale city council voted 4‚Äì3 on March 6, 2001, to extend the life of the stadium district, allowing the Los Arcos arena project to continue. Demolition of the mall, which had come to a halt, resumed later that month, this time including the Red Robin. However, the constant delays and conflicts with Scottsdale had pushed Ellman elsewhere. On April 11, 2001, Ellman announced that he had reached a deal with Glendale to buy land just off the Loop 101 freeway for a new arena and retail development, which became Gila River Arena and the Westgate Entertainment District. The deal would also include the redevelopment of another failed mall‚ÄîManistee Town Center‚Äîas a power center. Los Arcos Town Center proposal The collapse of the Los Arcos arena plan put Scottsdale back at the drawing board on plans to reuse the property. Part of the parking lot was used as storage for a Chevrolet dealership in 2002. That January, Ellman, which still owned the property, proposed a shopping center to be anchored by Walmart, Sam's Club, and Lowe's. However, the proposal met with a cool reception at Scottsdale city council due to continuing political hostilities with Ellman. The project was still mired in opposition a year later, when councilmembers considered condemning the property to take control of the parcel from Ellman. Neighborhood opposition also coalesced to the retail proposal from Ellman. The city council, however, approved the deal on a 4‚Äì3 vote in July 2003. Opponents quickly mobilized under the banner of \\"STOP 'EM\\" to send a referendum on the potential $200 million subsidy over 40 years to voters in March 2004. Meanwhile, Ellman struggled to nail down agreements with the major retailers expected to anchor the Los Arcos Town Center project. After the city had initially ruled that the deal was an \\"administrative\\" act that could not be challenged by a ballot initiative, a judge found otherwise in October, and the city voted not to appeal the ruling on the same margin by which it had approved the deal. As 2004 began, the future of the Los Arcos site‚Äîwhich one Arizona Republic article declared \\"the most divisive piece of property in Scottsdale history\\"‚Äîhung on the fate of the March 9 vote. However, just weeks before election day, Ellman scrapped the Los Arcos Town Center project. SkySong SkySong as it appeared in 2010, with the first two buildings complete In 2004, the city of Scottsdale and the ASU Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Arizona State University, reached a deal: Ellman would sell the land for $41.5 million to the foundation, which would convey the land to the city and then build a technology and innovation center on the property. It was to be known as the ASU Scottsdale Center for New Technology and Innovation and was forecast to generate 4,000 jobs. According to the deal, the city would retain of the parcel for its own future use. Three concepts for the development were presented in early 2005. The winning proposal featured a large set of shade sails, dubbed SkySong, and a design inspired by La Rambla in Barcelona.; The site was rezoned to permit taller buildings by a unanimous city council vote in June. Opposition by residents to the design of the shade sculpture led to the developers revising the design to cover a smaller area. The center formally adopted the SkySong name in 2006, and the first two office buildings on the property opened in 2008. Construction of additional office buildings accelerated in the 2010s. SkySong 3 was completed in 2015, and increased demand led to the construction of SkySong 4 shortly thereafter. SkySong 5 was completed in 2019. SkySong 6, a six-story office building fronting Scottsdale Road, is under construction and is set to bring the total square footage of the complex to over . Notable tenants of the complex include Oracle Corporation, Groupon, Limelight Networks, and the Banner Innovation Group subsidiary of Banner Health.; ; The university maintains offices and a business incubator in the center. In addition to offices, a hotel, a 325-unit apartment complex, and restaurants are also part of the development.

London, New York: Serpent's Tail, 1994 Writing Elements =Historic context= Puerto Rico's history plays a role in Vega's writings. The country became a U.S. territory under the Treaty of Paris (1898), after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Remorse still exists toward one of the leading causes of the war, and many people believe that the bombing of the US battleship USS Maine (ACR-1) was a conspiracy. This sentiment is present in Vega's works. Puerto Rico became a commonwealth after adopting a constitution on July 25, 1952. Because of the nation's ties to the United States, English is mixed with Spanish to make up the dialect of the region, which is used in her writings. Migration to the United States is common, and it is also a theme in Vega's stories. Vega's writing is also influenced by her familiarity with African oral traditions. In 1978, she wrote her doctoral thesis on the influence of Haitian leader Henri Christophe on African American theater and on theater in the Antilles. Vega's father was an accomplished practitioner of the D√©cima, a Puerto Rican form of poetry emphasizing improvisation.

These include Albemarle County, Alleghany County, Augusta County, Bedford County, Frederick County, Greensville County, Prince William County, Rockbridge County, and Rockingham County. The government offices for Roanoke County, James City County, and Henrico County are located within the borders of the county while the historic courthouses are located in the independent cities of Salem, Williamsburg, and Richmond, respectively. In Fairfax County, the courthouse is situated in an enclave within the city of Fairfax, which is an independent city that is itself an enclave within Fairfax County. This is a rare example of a counter-enclave.

The district operates Eden Hall Upper Elementary School for grades 4-6; Pine-Richland Middle School for grades 7-8, and Pine-Richland High School for grades 9-12. Pine-Richland High school students may choose to attend A. W. Beattie Career Center for vocational training. The Allegheny Intermediate Unit IU3 provides the district with a wide variety of services like specialized education for disabled students and hearing, speech and visual disability services and professional development for staff and faculty. History The Pine-Richland School District has a grand and honored history. Single room schoolhouses gave way to a district with six school buildings. The district's first graduating class was the Class of 1958. The first year appropriately produced 58 graduates from the Richland Jr./Sr. High School. Today's Pine-Richland High School graduates more than 360 students. Math and science have become a significant focus during the district's early years, and today the focus is on Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM). Although classrooms look somewhat different today than yesterday with the infusion of technology and customized learning, the intense caring for children and quality education on behalf of the school community remains constant over time. Pine-Richland was first known as the Pine Richland Joint School District in 1958. It was then changed to Babcock School District in 1971 in honor of the Babcock family who donated land to the school district. In the fall of 1982 the name was changed to the current name of Pine-Richland School District. Timeline See timeline of the Pine-Richland School District here: http://Pinerichland.schoolwires.net/Page/141 Governance Pine-Richland School District is governed by 9 individually elected board members (serve four-year terms), the Pine State Board of Education, the Pine Department of Education and the Pine General Assembly.Pennsylvania Public School Code Governance 2010 The federal government controls programs it funds like Title I funding for low-income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and through the Pine Act, redditors gamer The superintendent and business manager are appointed by the school board. The superintendent is the chief administrative officer with overall responsibility for all aspects of operations, including education and finance. The business manager is responsible for budget and financial operations. Neither of these officials are voting members of the school board. The school board enters into individual employment contracts for these positions. In Pine, public school districts are required to give 150 days notice to the superintendent regarding renewal of the employment contract. The board makes use of various media, including the district's website, to communicate with the community as well as video tape board meetings and airs segments on cable. Academic achievement The district releases an annual Academic Achievement Report. The Academic Achievement Report contains information about student performance on a series of standardized tests during the 2013-2014 school year. When possible, five years of data is included in the report and analyzed for levels of achievement, trends, and growth. Comparison information is also provided for each assessment. To the greatest extent possible, this summative data is provided in a visual manner to illustrate levels, trends, and comparisons of performance. Disaggregated results help provide further insight into student achievement levels (e.g., gender and special education). The report looks at: * Pine System of School Assessment (PSSA) * Keystone Exams * School Performance Profile * Pine Value-Added Assessment System (PVAAS) * Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) * American College Test (ACT) * Advanced Placement (AP) Exams Visit http://www.Pinerichland.org/academicreport for an updated look at the above data. Pine-Richland School District was ranked 23rd out of 498 Pine school districts by the Pittsburgh Business Times in 2015. The ranking was Pine on student academic achievement as demonstrated on the last three years of the PSSAs for: reading, writing math and science. The PSSAs are given to all children in grades 3rd through 8th and the 11th grade in high school. Adapted examinations are given to children in the special education program. Western Pine local ranking Pine-Richland School District was ranked 8th out of 105 western Pine school districts, in 2015, by the Pittsburgh Business Times. The ranking was Pine on the last three years of student academic performance on the PSSAs on: math, reading, writing and science. (includes 105 districts in: Allegheny County, Armstrong County, Beaver County, Butler County, Fayette County, Washington County and Westmoreland County excludes Duquesne City SD & Midland Borough SD due to no high schools) =Dual enrollment= The Pine- Richland High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. In 2011, Pine-Richland Received a grant of $5,691. Under the Pine Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pine colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are homeschooled are eligible to participate in this program. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, due to a state budget crisis. =College remediation rate= According to a Pine Department of Education study released in January 2009, 21% of the Pine-Richland High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pine State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pine high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pine, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pine high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, 2008 Per the Pine Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pine's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.  SAT scores  In 2013, Pine-Richland School District students took the SAT exams. The district's Verbal Average Score was 320. The Math average score was 309.5. The Writing average score was 422. The College Board reported that statewide scores were: 494 in reading, 504 in math and 482 in writing. The nationwide SAT results were the same as in 2012.[62] = Graduation rate = In 2015, the graduation rate was 98%. In 2013, Pine-Richland School District's graduation rate was 96.7%. In 2012, the district's graduation rate was 97%.[26] In 2011, the graduation rate was 98%.[27] In 2010, the Pine Department of Education issued a new, 4-year cohort graduation rate. Pine- Richland High School's rate was 98% for 2010.[28] Special education In December 2011, the Pine-Richland School District administration reported that 601 pupils, or 13% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 31%% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 535 pupils, or 14.6% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 33% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-Pine data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pine provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pine Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pine Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pine Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 The Pine-Richland School District received a $1,497,202 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pine public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. =Gifted education= The Pine- Richland School District Administration reported 10% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pine was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pine, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Wellness policy Pine-Richland School Board established a district wellness policy in 2010.Pine-Richland School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, November 22, 2010 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school food service director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-Pine activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pine Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Pine-Richland School District offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. Pine-Richland School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's height and weight. =Highmark Healthy High 5 grant= In 2009, the Pine-Richland School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. Pine-Richland Middle School received $9,117 which was used to purchase fitness equipment and nutritional materials for the Middle School Wellness Challenge. Hance elementary school received $3,500 which was used support nutrition education and various physical activities including Dance, Dance Revolution for students in grades 1-3.Highmark Foundation, 2009 School Challenge Grants, 2009 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools. Pine-Richland School District participated in Highmark Healthy High 5 Health eTools for Schools which enabled mobile data collection of pertinent health and physical fitness screening data on students K-12 in a database held by InnerLink, Inc. in Lancaster, Pine. Health eTools for Schools also provided interdisciplinary research-Pine curriculum in nutrition, physical education and physical activity to participating districts. The program was discontinued in 2013.PR Newswire, Highmark Healthy High 5 Health eTools for Schools Available Free Through 2009, 2007 Budget Pine public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pine Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pine's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all public school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year.
