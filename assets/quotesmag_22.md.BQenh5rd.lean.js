The airline was based at Skien Airport, Geiteryggen and diverse range of general aviation activities and a limited scheduled services. Major undertakings included deliveries of the newspaper Dagbladet, flying tourists into mountainous areas such as Hardangervidda and crop dusted forest areas. A scheduled service was introduced from Skien to Oslo Airport, Fornebu in 1963, and extended to Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Hamar Airport, Stafsberg four years later. At its peak in 1965, the airline had a fleet of fourteen aircraft. Owned by Snorre and Reidun Kjetilson, the airline was established in 1954 in Drammen. Operation started out of Skien the following year. In addition to a range of Cessna, Piper, Fairchild and other smaller aircraft, Fjellfly operated the 10-passenger Noorduyn Norseman for most of its existence. From the mid-1960s it introduced the 16-passenger Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer on the scheduled flights, at the time the only aircraft of such a size that could land at Geiteryggen. From 1967, the airline started flying out of Vest-Telemark Airport, Fyresdal and established a pilot school at Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik. With the runway at Geiteryggen extended in 1970, the airline went over the de Havilland Heron on the scheduled services. Fjellfly filed for bankruptcy in 1972. History The airline was established by Snorre Sturla Kjetilson and his wife Reidun. Originally from Rjukan, the Snorre in Drammen when he decided to take his pilots' license.Olsen: 162 Along with an investor, Kjetilson bought a Cessna 180 from Thor Solberg in 1954 and established Drammen Flyselskap. The investor quickly lost faith in the airline and sold his share to Kjetilson.Olsen: 163 To secure sufficient business, he contacted several newspapers, and agreed to fly Dagbladet from Oslo to Grenland daily. From 1955 the airline flew from the water aerodrome at Oslo Airport, Fornebu to Her√∏ya in Porsgrunn and onwards to Hjellevatnet in Skien. Later in the year, wheels were placed on the aircraft and it started flying to Geiteryggen.Olsen: 166 Geiteryggen became the airline's base, and the couple moved to Skien in 1957.Olsen: 167 A Twin Pioneer at Groningen Airport The airline took delivery of a used Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer on 3 September 1963.Olsen: 197 The remainder of the year the aircraft remained at Geiteryggen for an overhaul. Among the uses of the aircraft had originally been thought crop dusting, but this was never carried out. The aircraft's test flight took place on 24 April 1964Olsen: 199 and the aircraft entered service on 2 May, flying FC Odd to Bergen to play a football match. In addition to charter, the 16-passenger aircraft was sometimes used on the round trips to Oslo. Fjellfly was the only Norwegian operator of the Twin Pioneer.Hagby: 75 Fjellfly received permission to operate a scheduled \\"line taxi\\" service from Skien to Fornebu. This implied that the route was flown with less administrative work, but limited the size of the aircraft. The services started on 1 March 1963 using the Twin Pioneer. At the time, only a single pilot in the country had the necessary type rating for the aircraft. The Twin Pioneer was expensive, having high fuel consumption, high maintenance costs and a lower speed. In addition, it had too high capacity for the Fornebu route. Kjetilson considered purchasing the de Havilland Dove, but no deal was struck.Olsen: 202 A scheduled services from Skien via Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Oslo Airport, Fornebu to Hamar Airport, Stafsberg was established from 2 May 1967.Olsen: 226 Kjetilson was one of the driving forces behind Vest-Telemark Airport, Fyresdal. He had faith in that the area was superb for tourism and stated to Telemark Arbeiderblad on 16 September 1967 that he would give the airline to the municipality it Fyresdal did not have continental traffic within two years.Olsen: 204 The airport opened on 23 September.Olsen: 205 Fjellfly established a pilot school at Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik the same year.Olsen: 208 With the upgrading of Geiteryggen to a longer, asphalt runway, the airline started looking for a more economical aircraft. In 1969, Fjellfly bought a de Havilland Heron from Tokyo and flew it back, arriving in February 1970. After a simple renovation, which included a renewal of the interior, the aircraft was put into service in the scheduled traffic.Olsen: 279 A second Heron was bought in 1971 and registered it on 10 February 1972. However, it would never enter service.Olsen: 280 By March Fjellfly was bankrupt. As Geiteryggen was operated by the airline, it also closed, but was soon reopened. After the bankruptcy, the aviation authorities were criticized for giving the schedule concession in 1967 to Fjellfly as the privilege was granted based on rural politics concessions while the company did not have sufficient financial security to operate the route. Operations Newspaper flying was one of the airline's main contracts. Dagbladet and Verdens Gang, the two main non-subscription newspapers, had a fierce competition to bring their newspapers first to the market. Fjellfly had a contract to fly Dagbladet out from Oslo to Hamar, T√∏nsberg, Sandefjord, Skien, Kristiansand, Stavanger, Bergen and Trondheim. If weather conditions did not allow visual flight rules, the latter four would be transported by scheduled services instead. In extreme cases where the weather did not allow flights to the airports in Eastern Norway, Fjellfly was responsible for distributing the newspaper by truck.Olsen: 224 To supplement the newspaper flights, Kjetilson started a systematic campaign to fly tourist into the mountain areas of Hardangervidda and Setesdalsheiene. The airline established a summer base at M√∏svatn. The Cessna 180 was equipped with hydraulic skis, allowing the aircraft to land both on runways and on lakes. The peak period was during the hunting season in September.Olsen: 169 The airline also flew a route with Dagbladet which it dropped at about 65 hotels and resorts in a six- to seven-hour trip.Olsen: 171 By the 1960s, the airline flew a regular service Skien‚ÄìOslo‚ÄìSandefjord‚ÄìLarvik‚ÄìSkien.Olsen: 201 From 1963 Fjellfly started crop dusting forests with fertilizer on a contract with Felleskj√∏pet. A Cessna 185 seaplane was bought for the job, which allowed it to be used for crop dusting in May and June, and be used for passenger flights the rest of the year. The first such mission took place on 3 May 1963.Olsen: 173 Although some of the operations took place from airstrips, most of the work was carried out using seaplanes.Olsen: 175 At the peak, four aircraft were used for crop dusting: two 185s, a Piper Super Cub and a Pilatus Porter.Olsen: 176 During the 1960s, Fjellfly had two domesticated bears which were held at the airport.Olsen: 186 Fleet {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" + List of aircraft operated by Fjellfly - ! scope=col  Aircraft ! scope=col  No. ! scope=col  Seats ! scope=col  Period ! scope=col class=unsortable Ref - ! scope=row  Cessna 150  2  5  1967‚Äì72  align=center  Hagby: 314 - ! scope=row  Cessna 172A  2  4  1965‚Äì72  align=center  Hagby: 123Hagby: 304 - ! scope=row  Cessna 180  2  4  1955‚Äì65  align=center  Hagby: 201Hagby: 305 - ! scope=row  Cessna 185 Skywagon  3  6  1963‚Äì72  align=center  Hagby: 116Hagby: 113Hagby: 194 - ! scope=row  Cessna 195  1  5  1957‚Äì68  align=center  Hagby: 117 - ! scope=row  de Havilland Heron  2  17  1969‚Äì72  align=center  Hagby: 36 - ! scope=row  Fairchild PT-19-FA Cornell  3  2  1957‚Äì66  align=center  Hagby: 122-124 - ! scope=row  Fairchild PT-26B-FE Cornell  5  2  1956‚Äì66  align=center  - ! scope=row  Noorduyn Norseman IV  4  11  1957‚Äì72  align=center  Hagby: 301 - ! scope=row  North American Harvard IIB  2  2  1961‚Äì72  align=center  Hagby: 134 - ! scope=row  Fieseler Fi 156 Storch  1  2  1959‚Äì62  align=center  - ! scope=row  Piper J-3 Cub  1  2  1961‚Äì72  align=center  Hagby: 191 - ! scope=row  Piper PA-18 Super Cub  1  2  1965‚Äì66  align=center  Hagby: 303 - ! scope=row  Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer  2  4  1959‚Äì68  align=center  Hagby: 96Hagby: 136 - ! scope=row  Piper PA-23 Apache  3  6  1962‚Äì71  align=center  Hagby: 150Hagby: 204 - ! scope=row  Piper PA-28-140 Cherokee Cruiser  3  2  1967‚Äì71  align=center  Hagby: 308 - ! scope=row  Piper PA-31 Navajo  1  8  1972  align=center  Hagby: 286 - ! scope=row  Piper PA-32 Cherokee Six  1  6  1968‚Äì72  align=center  - ! scope=row  Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer  2  16  1964‚Äì72  align=center  } References ;Bibliography Category:Transport companies of Vestfold og Telemark Category:Defunct airlines of Norway Category:1972 disestablishments in Norway Category:Airlines established in 1954 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1972 Category:Defunct seaplane operators Category:Norwegian companies established in 1954 ","title":"Fjellfly"},{"id":"7746103","text":"The Kuwaiti Family Committee is an organization that was formed in 2004 by relatives of the Kuwaiti detainees in Guantanamo Bay.

As such, it is nearly impossible to generalize the duties of chem techs as their individual jobs vary greatly. Biochemical techs often do similar work in biochemistry. Laboratory, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Cologne Technologists Chemical technologists are more likely than technicians to participate in the actual design of experiments, and may be involved in the interpretation of experimental data. They may also be responsible for the operation of chemical processes in large plants, and may even assist chemical engineers in the design of the same. Some post-secondary education is generally required to be either a chemical technician or technologist. Occasionally, a company may be willing to provide a high school graduate with training to become a chemical technician, but more often, a two-year degree will be required. Chemical technologists generally require completion of a specific college program‚Äîeither two year or four year‚Äî in chemical, biochemical, or chemical engineering technology or a closely related discipline. They usually work under or with a scientist such as a chemist or biochemist. Technicians Chemical or biochemical technicians often work in clinical (medical) laboratories conducting routine analyses of medical samples such as blood and urine. Industries which employ chem techs include chemical, petrochemical, and pharmaceutical industries. Companies within these industries can be concerned with manufacturing, research and development (R&D;), consulting, quality control, and a variety of other areas.

The bog was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1973 as the only remaining open-water quaking bog in Illinois. The site also contains woodlands, savanna, marshes, prairie restoration areas, shrubland and old fields. Maintained by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (Illinois DNR), the site is located about a mile west of U.S. Route 12 between the towns of Volo and Fox Lake, Illinois. Bog biology The bog itself is in size. It was originally a steep-sided lake created by the melting of a large chunk of glacial ice at the end of the Wisconsonian glaciation. About 6,000 years before the present, a mat of sphagnum moss began to grow out into the water, playing a major role in the evolution of this geological feature from a lake into a bog. As the sphagnum mat aged and thickened, the developing bog (already poorly drained) became acidic. The bog's changing pH levels encouraged the growth of other acid-loving plant species, such as leatherleaf, certain specialized orchids, and coniferous tamarack trees. The development of a tamarack grove on the edge of the bog signaled further change in the wetland. By historic times Volo Bog was deep into the process of plant succession. While the center of the bog remained a pool of open water, shallower sections of the sphagnum-moss cushion had begun to provide a substrate for the growth of woody plants, such as tamaracks and poison sumac. The edges of the bog were further developing from a bog into a slightly drier wetland. A state-owned protective zone around the bog displays further stages of plant succession. The entire state park displays a microcosm of plant succession, from bog, through wetland, to sedge-grass meadow. Bog history The boardwalk trail through the tamarack zone to the bog Pitcher plants visible from the boardwalk, taken July 2015 During the 19th century Volo Bog was known to neighbors but not to outsiders. While the damp meadows surrounding the bog provided pasturage for a dairy farm, the bog itself was not economically used. The first field study mentioning Volo Bog was published by W.G. Waterman of Northwestern University in 1921. As the 20th century moved forward, population growth in the Chicago area placed Volo Bog under threat from residential development. Cyrus Mark, the first president of the Illinois chapter of The Nature Conservancy, spearheaded the efforts to purchase Volo Bog for preservation. Under Mark's leadership, the Conservancy's Illinois chapter purchased the bog and donated it to the University of Illinois in 1958; this was the first land purchase made by the Illinois Nature Conservancy. The university served as the bog's custodian from 1958 until 1970. Growth in public sensitivity toward ecological concerns in the 1960s led to fears that the bog could not survive as an isolated unit. It became clear that the wetlands and meadows surrounding the bog formed an essential element in the survival of the bog itself, as well as serving as a teaching tool for plant succession. In 1970 with widespread local public support, the University of Illinois transferred the bog to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, and the state of Illinois began purchasing parcels of land surrounding the bog to create the current park. Volo Bog was listed as a National Natural Landmark in 1973. One of the wetland farm's original, circa-1900 dairy barns was renovated and reopened as the bog's visitor center in 1980. Work since 1980 has concentrated on rebuilding and maintaining trails throughout the bog, increasing the accessibility of the bog and visitor center for persons with disabilities, and operating continuing ecology-education programs for adults and schoolchildren. Recreation Volo Bog State Natural Area currently offers two major trails. An elevated boardwalk leads from the Visitor Center into the bog itself. A ground trail circles through the wetlands and meadows surrounding the bog.

(2011), First International Conference of the South Asian Society [of] Criminology and Victimology (SASCV), 15‚Äì17 January 2011, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India: SASCV 2011 : Conference Proceedings, South Asian Society of Criminology and Victimology. International Conference, PP-295 The killings took place in a small village in India named Kherlanji, located in the Bhandara district of the state of Maharashtra. History On 29 September 2006, four members of the Bhotmange family belonging to a Scheduled caste were murdered in a small village called Kherlanji in Maharashtra. The women of the family, Surekha and Priyanka, were paraded naked in public before being murdered. Enraged by a police complaint lodged the previous day by Surekha over a land dispute, the accused dragged out Surekha Bhaiyyalal Bhotmange and two of her sons and daughter, paraded naked in the village, sexually abused them and then hacked them to death. The accused were members of the politically dominant Kunbi caste. The Indian media did not cover this incident until the Nagpur riots by the Scheduled Caste citizens. The criminal act was in fact carried out by assailants from the politically powerful Kunbi caste (classified as Other Backward Classes) for \\"opposing\\" the requisition of their field to have a road built over it. Initial reports suggested that the women were gang-raped before being murdered. Though CBI investigations concluded that the women were not raped, there were allegations of bribery of doctors who performed the post-mortem, and of corruption. There were allegations that the local police shielded the alleged perpetrators in the ongoing investigation. A government report on the killings, prepared by the social justice department and YASHADA‚Äîthe state academy of developmental administration, has implicated top police officers, doctors and even a BJP member of the Legislative Assembly, Madhukar Kukade in an alleged coverup and hindering the investigations. Kukade has denied these charges, saying that he had not even been in Kherlanji in months. The state Home Minister R. R. Patil admitted to initial lapses in police investigation and said that five policemen suspended in the investigation of the killings have been dismissed. In December 2006, CBI filed a chargesheet against 11 persons under charges of murder, criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly with deadly weapons and outraging the modesty of women. CBI also said that it will investigate the role of the 36 people under detention. The media coverage of the incident was initially weak, but picked up momentum after an investigative feature article by Sabrina Buckwalter with the help of social activist Deelip Mhaske in The Times of India provided the first mainstream, in-depth coverage of the massacre. In September 2008, six people were given the death sentence for the crime.Economic Times However, on 14 July 2010, the Nagpur bench of the High Court commuted the death penalty awarded to the six convicted to a 25-year rigorous imprisonment jail sentence. Protests Protests against the killings in the Kherlanji village took place in various parts of Maharashtra. On 19 November 2006, over 4,000 Scheduled Caste citizens gathered at the Azad maidan in Mumbai to protest against the Khairlanji incident. On 23 November 2006, several members of the Scheduled Caste community in the nearby district of Chandrapur staged a protest over the Khairlanji killings. The protesters allegedly turned violent and threw stones. The police baton-charged the protesters to control the situation. Scheduled Caste leaders, however, denied that they had caused any violence and claimed that they were \\"protesting in peace\\". Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 600,000 to the next of kin of the victims' family, and housing and job awards to the affected family members. He also assured that his government would give an additional Rs 200,000 to them from the Chief Minister's Relief Fund. In November and December 2006, the desecration of an Ambedkar statue in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh triggered off violent protests by Buddhists in Maharashtra. Several people, including the Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and the Mumbai Police Commissioner A N Roy remarked that the protests were fuelled by the Khairlanji killings.  Court case  =2008 September Verdict by the Bhandara court= The verdict in the 2006 Khairlanji court case was announced on 15 September 2008. Bhandara Sessions court has held eight people guilty of murder and acquitted three. List of people held guilty of murder: * Gopal Sakru Binjewar * Sakru Binjewar * Shatrughna Dhande * Vishwanath Dhande * Prabhakar Mandlekar * Jagdish Mandlekar * Ramu Dhande * Shishupal Dhande List of acquitted people: * Mahipal Dhande * Dharmpal Dhande * Purshottam Titirmare The first ad-hoc sessions judge, S S Dass, had heard the arguments of prosecution and defence on the quantum of punishment and had fixed 24 September for his pronouncement. Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam had made a forceful plea for capital punishment to all the convicts. Defence lawyers Sudip Jaiswal and Neeraj Khandewale pleaded for leniency in view of the act committed in the heat of the moment and clean past record of the convicts. On 24 September 2008, six people were awarded the death sentence, while two others were given life imprisonment. The ruling was appealed to the Nagpur division bench of the Bombay High Court where hearings began in April 2010. Justices A P Lawande and R C Chavan heard arguments in the case until 21 April 2010, at which point they announced the verdict would be announced on 15 June 2010. However, Justice Lawande on 15 June said the decision would be deferred until 14 July 2010 as Justice Chavan is posted in Bombay. =2010 July verdict by the Bhandara court= On 14 July, the Nagpur bench of the High Court commuted the death penalty awarded to the six convicted to a 25-year rigorous imprisonment jail sentence. The two others who received life sentences received a similar sentence. The ruling touched off statewide protests and re-kindled the fury of injustice felt by local Scheduled Caste organizations and the sole survivor, Bhaiyalal Bhotmange. The court ruled that the murders resulted from an act of revenge and was not caste related. Bhotmange was told that the CBI would appeal the commutation to the Supreme Court, however, after over two weeks of no action, Bhotmange announced he would appeal the decision himself. An appeal against the judgment of the High Court is pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. It was last listed for hearing on 14 August 2015. =Death of Bhaiyyalal Bhotmange= The lone survivor of the 2006 Khairlanji Scheduled Caste family massacre, Bhaiyyalal Bhotmange died on 20 Jan 2017 due to heart attack.

The suit claims that Liberty Tax had a plan or a scheme to increase their profits by filing false, fraudulent or inappropriate forms.Five Signs You Might Have a Bad Tax PreparerThe Ugly Truth about the Tax Preparation Chains * Liberty Tax has been accused of engaging in predatory lending targeted at low income and military families. The alleged abuses relate to what is known as refund anticipation loans (RAL). An RAL is a high interest rate short-term loan secured by a taxpayer's expected tax refund, and designed to offer customers quicker access to funds, rather than waiting for their tax refund from the IRS. The New York State Division of Human Rights in 2008 filed a complaint against Liberty Tax Service and others, seeking to limit the tax preparers' ability to market RALs. According to the DHR's court filings, military families and ethnic minority families have found themselves in deep debt having to use their tax-refund and savings just to keep up with interest payments that can balloon up to 700% annualized when they get RALs.Predatory Lenders Milking Consumers Subsidiaries * JTH Tax, Inc.

The name Ouiatenon, also variously given as Ouiatanon, Oujatanon, Ouiatano or other similar forms, is a French rendering of a term from the Wea dialect of the Miami-Illinois language which means \\"place of the people of the whirlpool\\", an ethnonym for the Wea. Ouiatenon can be said to refer generally to any settlement of Wea or to their tribal lands as a whole, though the name is most frequently used to refer to a group of extinct settlements situated together along the Wabash River in what is now western Tippecanoe County, Indiana. History =Establishment= By the late 17th century the Miami speaking peoples, of which the Wea were a part, had begun to return to their homelands in the Wabash River Valley, an area they had earlier been driven from by the eastern Iroquois. The several tribal bands of Miami separated as they settled the valley, with the Wea occupying the middle Wabash Valley between the Eel River in the north and the Vermilion River in the south. Of the Wea's five major settlements, Ouiatenon was the largest concentration; it was described in August 1791 by U.S. General James Wilkinson as \\"the chief town of the Ouiatenon Nation.\\" The Ouiatenon site was favorably located for trade and habitation, being situated on a fertile plain near what was considered to be the head of deep water navigation on the Wabash River. It was also well supplied with fish, plentiful near the mouth of Wea Creek, and with wild game in the surrounding prairie and woodlands.Craig, pp. 11-12 Ouiatenon consisted of two large villages and two or three smaller onesCraig, pp. 25-28. Based on the official report of Gen. Scott, who described two villages in the plains and two along the river, with another chiefly Kickapoo village on the far shore. located along or near the Wabash River between the mouth of Wea Creek in the east and mouth of Riviere de Bois Rouge (later Indian Creek) in the west, a distance of between four and five miles (8 km). One village, located on the north bank of the river opposite the main Ouiatenon town, was chiefly inhabited by Kickapoo. =French period= The French, in an effort to counter British influence over the area, established a military post on the north bank of the Wabash opposite Ouiatenon in 1717, a site now known as Fort Ouiatenon. European settlement in the area surrounding the fort was sparse because the post's commandants did not make grants of land to settlers as was done elsewhere;Craig, p. 18 however, it did become one of the most successful trading posts in the region. In 1760 the French agreed to withdraw from the valley and ceded the area to British control. =Destruction= On 9 March 1791, U.S. Secretary of War Henry Knox issued orders from President George Washington to Brigadier General Charles Scott of Kentucky to lead a punitive expedition against the Wea settlements in the Wabash Valley. Just after noon on 1 June 1791, Scott with a force of 33 officers and 760 mounted Kentucky volunteers crested High Gap Hill and entered the Wea Plains. Perceiving two villages to the northwest, at two miles (3 km) and four miles (6 km) out, Scott sent a small detachment under Colonel John Hardin to destroy them while he and the bulk of his force continued north toward the main Ouiatenon village near the mouth of Wea Creek, where the smoke of cooking fires could be seen. Rounding the fringe of trees at the bend in Wea Creek, Scott's forces found the Ouiatenon town in the bottom land near the Wabash and descended upon it, causing panic amongst the inhabitants. Some in canoes tried to escape to the Kickapoo village opposite, but were killed by riflemen before reaching the opposite shore; 41 women and children were taken prisoner; the remainder were killed, dispersed or escaped. Scott burned the town and several hundred acres of growing corn. =Post-destruction= Vestiges of Ouiatenon remained visible for many years after its destruction, and artifacts could be easily found after the grass had been burned off in the autumn. A small town named Granville or Weaton was founded in 1834 near the site of the westernmost Ouiatenon village and prospered from the presence of the Wabash and Erie Canal, built through the area in the 1840s. Both the canal and town declined in the 1850s and were defunct by the 1870s. The towns of Glen Hall and Shadeland remain on the southern and eastern periphery of the plain. Tippecanoe Labs, a large chemical laboratory and manufacturing complex operated by Evonik Industries, stands just east of the mouth of Wea Creek; the site of the main Ouiatenon town and surrounding area is owned by the labs and is partly contained within the Tippecanoe Labs Wildlife Habitat. Geography The Wea Plains historical marker near Granville. The villages of Ouiatenon occupied a fertile area known as the Wea Plains, a roughly area in what is now northern Wayne and Union townships. > To the north lies the long range of the Indian Hills, crowned with forest > trees, and scarped with many a sharp ravine.

Denialism is an essentially irrational action that withholds the validation of a historical experience or event, when a person refuses to accept an empirically verifiable reality. In the sciences, denialism is the rejection of basic facts and concepts that are undisputed, well-supported parts of the scientific consensus on a subject, in favor of radical and controversial ideas. The terms Holocaust denialism and AIDS denialism describe the denial of the facts and the reality of the subject matters,Usages of Holocaust and AIDS denialism: ; ; ; ; and the term climate change denial describes denial of the scientific consensus that the climate change of planet Earth is a real and occurring event primarily caused by human activity.Usages of global-warming denialism: ; ; . The forms of denialism present the common feature of the person rejecting overwhelming evidence and the generation of political controversy with attempts to deny the existence of consensus. The motivations and causes of denialism include religion, self-interest (economic, political, or financial), and defence mechanisms meant to protect the psyche of the denialist against mentally disturbing facts and ideas. Orthodoxy and heterodoxy Anthropologist Didier Fassin distinguishes between denial, defined as \\"the empirical observation that reality and truth are being denied\\", and denialism, which he defines as \\"an ideological position whereby one systematically reacts by refusing reality and truth\\". Persons and social groups who reject propositions on which there exists a mainstream and scientific consensus engage in denialism when they use rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of argument and legitimate debate, when there is none. Rick Stoff quoted Chris Hoofnagle‚Äîa senior staff attorney at the Samuelson Law, Technology & Public Policy Clinic and a senior fellow at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the UC Berkeley School of Law‚Äîas follows: In a 2003 newspaper article, Edwin Cameron, a senior South African judge who has AIDS, described the tactics used by those who deny the Holocaust and by those who deny that the AIDS pandemic is due to infection with HIV. He states that \\"For denialists, the facts are unacceptable. They engage in radical controversion, for ideological purposes, of facts that, by and large, are accepted by almost all experts and lay persons as having been established on the basis of overwhelming evidence\\".The dead hand of denialism Edwin Cameron. Mail & Guardian (Johannesburg), April 17, 2003. To do this they employ \\"distortions, half-truths, misrepresentation of their opponents' positions and expedient shifts of premises and logic.\\" Edwin Cameron notes that a common tactic used by denialists is to \\"make great play of the inescapable indeterminacy of figures and statistics\\", as scientific studies of many areas rely on probability analysis of sets of data, and in historical studies the precise numbers of victims and other facts may not be available in the primary sources. A 2009 article published in the journal Globalization and Health also notes \\"recourse to data debates and pseudo-scientific 'evidence is a common feature of several types of denialism. This is an area which British historian Richard J. Evans mentioned as part of his analysis of the David Irving's work which he presented for the defence when Irving sued Deborah Lipstadt for libel: Mark Hoofnagle (brother of Chris Hoofnagle) has described denialism as \\"the employment of rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate, when in actuality there is none\\". It is a process that operates by employing one or more of the following five tactics in order to maintain the appearance of legitimate controversy: #Conspiracy theories ‚Äì Dismissing the data or observation by suggesting opponents are involved in \\"a conspiracy to suppress the truth\\". #Cherry picking ‚Äì Selecting an anomalous critical paper supporting their idea, or using outdated, flawed, and discredited papers in order to make their opponents look as though they base their ideas on weak research. Diethelm and McKee (2009) note, \\"Denialists are usually not deterred by the extreme isolation of their theories, but rather see it as an indication of their intellectual courage against the dominant orthodoxy and the accompanying political correctness.\\"Pascal Diethelm, Martin McKee, Denialism: what is it and how should scientists respond?, European Journal of Public Health, Volume 19, Issue 1, January 2009, Pages 2‚Äì4, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckn139 #False experts ‚Äì Paying an expert in the field, or another field, to lend supporting evidence or credibility. This goes hand-in-hand with the marginalization of real experts and researchers.Pascal Diethelm, Martin McKee, Denialism: what is it and how should scientists respond?, European Journal of Public Health, Volume 19, Issue 1, January 2009, Pages 2‚Äì4, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckn139 #Moving the goalposts ‚Äì Dismissing evidence presented in response to a specific claim by continually demanding some other (often unfulfillable) piece of evidence. #Other logical fallacies ‚Äì Usually one or more of false analogy, appeal to consequences, straw man, or red herring. Regarding how to respond to denialism, Diethelm and McKee (2009) recommend allowing denialists to have a voice. When debating a denialist, they suggest shifting the topic of conversation to the tactics that the denialist is using and exposing their methods to public scrutiny.Pascal Diethelm, Martin McKee, Denialism: what is it and how should scientists respond?, European Journal of Public Health, Volume 19, Issue 1, January 2009, Pages 2‚Äì4, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckn139 Focusing on the rhetorical tactics through which denialism is achieved in language, in Alex Gillespie (2020) of the London School of Economics has reviewed the linguistic and practical defensive tactics for denying disruptive information. These tactics are conceptualized in terms of three layers of defence: # Avoiding ‚Äì The first line of defence against disruptive information is to avoid it. # Delegitimizing ‚Äì The second line of defence is to attack the messenger, by undermining the credibility of the source. # Limiting ‚Äì The final line of defence, if disruptive information cannot be avoided or delegitimized, is to rationalize and limit the impact of the disruptive ideas. Tara Smith of the University of Iowa also stated that moving goalposts, conspiracy theories, and cherry-picking evidence are general characteristics of denialist arguments, but went on to note that these groups spend the \\"majority of their efforts critiquing the mainstream theory\\" in an apparent belief that if they manage to discredit the mainstream view, their own \\"unproven ideas will fill the void\\". In 2009 author Michael Specter defined group denialism as \\"when an entire segment of society, often struggling with the trauma of change, turns away from reality in favor of a more comfortable lie\\". Prescriptive and polemic If one party to a debate accuses the other of denialism they are framing the debate. This is because an accusation of denialism is both prescriptive and polemic: prescriptive because it carries implications that there is truth to the denied claim; polemic since the accuser implies that continued denial in the light of presented evidence raises questions about the other's motives. Some people have suggested that because denial of the Holocaust is well known, advocates who use the term denialist in other areas of debate may intentionally or unintentionally imply that their opponents are little better than Holocaust deniers. For example, in an essay discussing the general importance of skepticism, Clive James objected to the use of the word denialist to describe climate change skeptics, stating that it \\"calls up the spectacle of a fanatic denying the Holocaust\\"; and Celia Farber has objected to the term AIDS denialists, arguing that it is unjustifiable to place this belief on the same moral level with the Nazi crimes against humanity. However, Robert Gallo et al. defended this latter comparison, stating that AIDS denialism is similar to Holocaust denial since it is a form of pseudoscience that \\"contradicts an immense body of research\\". Edward Skidelsky, a lecturer in philosophy at Exeter University, has suggested that this is a new use for the word denial and it may have its origins in an old sense of \\"deny\\", akin to \\"disown\\" (as in the Apostle Peter denying Jesus), but that its more immediate antecedence is from the Freudian sense of deny as a refusal to accept a painful or humiliating truth. He writes that \\"An accusation of 'denial' is serious, suggesting either deliberate dishonesty or self-deception. The thing being denied is, by implication, so obviously true that the denier must be driven by perversity, malice or wilful blindness.\\" He suggests that, by the introduction of the word denier into further areas of historical and scientific debate, \\"One of the great achievements of The Enlightenment‚Äîthe liberation of historical and scientific enquiry from dogma‚Äîis quietly being reversed\\", and that this should worry liberal-minded people. Scientific = AIDS = AIDS denialism is the denial that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS denialism has been described as being \\"among the most vocal anti-science denial movements\\". Some denialists reject the existence of HIV, while others accept that the virus exists but say that it is a harmless passenger virus and not the cause of AIDS. Insofar as denialists acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of recreational drug use, malnutrition, poor sanitation, and side effects of antiretroviral medication, rather than infection with HIV. However, the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive and the scientific community rejects and ignores AIDS-denialist claims as based on faulty reasoning, cherry picking, and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data. With the rejection of these arguments by the scientific community, AIDS-denialist material is now spread mainly through the Internet. Thabo Mbeki, former president of South Africa, embraced AIDS denialism, proclaiming that AIDS was primarily caused by poverty. About 365,000 people died from AIDS during his presidency; it is estimated that around 343,000 premature deaths could have been prevented if proper treatment had been available. = COVID-19 = The term COVID-19 denialism or new coronavirus denialism (or viral denialism)) refers to the thinking of those who deny the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic or, at the very least, deny that deaths are happening in the manner or proportions scientifically recognized by the World Health Organization. These claims are considered pseudoscientific and the current scientific consensus supports data issued by countries' health agencies.DE TROI, M. and QUINTILIO, W.

SciELO em Perspectiva, 2020 [viewed 25 April 2020]. = Climate change = Some international corporations, such as ExxonMobil, have contributed to \\"fake citizens' groups and bogus scientific bodies\\" that claim that the science of global warming is inconclusive, according to a criticism by George Monbiot. ExxonMobil did not deny making the financial contributions, but its spokesman stated that the company's financial support for scientific reports did not mean it influenced the outcome of those studies. \\"The recycling of this type of discredited conspiracy theory diverts attention from the real challenge at hand: how to provide the energy needed to improve global living standards while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\\"CBC: Gore takes aim at corporately funded climate research.

May/June 2005 (Internet Archive) have published articles stating corporations are funding the \\"denial industry\\". In the context of consumer protection, denialism has been defined as \\"the use of rhetorical techniques and predictable tactics to erect barriers to debate and consideration of any type of reform, regardless of the facts.\\" The Bush Administration's replacement of previous science advisers with industry experts or scientists tied to industry, and its refusal to submit the Kyoto Protocol for ratification due to uncertainties they asserted were present in the climate change issue, have been cited by the press as examples of politically motivated denialism.Timeline, Climate Change and its Naysayers Newsweek August 13, 2007. = Evolution = Religious beliefs may prompt an individual to deny the validity of the scientific theory of evolution. Evolution is considered an undisputed fact within the scientific community and in academia, where the level of support for evolution is essentially universal, yet this view is often met with opposition by biblical literalists. The alternative view is often presented as a literal interpretation of the Book of Genesis's creation myth. Many fundamentalist Christians teach creationism as if it were fact under the banners of creation science and intelligent design. Beliefs that typically coincide with creationism include the belief in the global flood myth, geocentrism, and the belief that the Earth is only 6,000‚Äì10,000 years old., cited by as \\"[on]ne of the most precise explications of creation science\\" These beliefs are viewed as pseudoscience in the scientific community and are widely regarded as erroneous. = Flat Earth = The superseded belief that the Earth is flat, and denial of all of the overwhelming evidence that supports an approximately spherical Earth that rotates around its axis and revolves around the Sun, persists into the 21st century. Modern proponents of flat-Earth cosmology (or flat-Earthers) refuse to accept any kind of contrary evidence, dismissing all spaceflights and images from space as hoaxes and accusing all organizations and even private citizens of conspiring to \\"hide the truth\\". They also claim that no actual satellites are orbiting the Earth, that the International Space Station is fake, and that these are lies from all governments involved in this grand cover-up. Adherents of the modern flat-Earth model propose that a dome-shaped firmament encloses a disk-shaped Earth. They may also claim, after Samuel Rowbotham, that the Sun is only 3,000 miles above the Earth and that the Moon and the Sun orbit above the Earth rather than around it. Modern flat-Earthers believe that Antarctica is not a continent but a massive ice flow, with a wall 150 feet or higher, which circles the perimeter of the Earth and keeps everything (including all the oceans' water) from falling off the edge. Flat- Earthers also assert that no one is allowed to fly over or explore Antarctica, despite contrary evidence. According to them, all photos and videos of ships sinking under the horizon and of the bottoms of city skylines and clouds below the horizon, revealing the curvature of the Earth, have been manipulated, CGI, or somehow faked. Therefore, regardless of any scientific or empirical evidence provided, flat-Earthers conclude that it is fabricated or altered in some way. When linked to other observed phenomena such as gravity, sunsets, tides, eclipses, distances and other measurements that challenge the flat earth model, claimants replace commonly-accepted explanations with piecemeal models that distort or over-simplify how perspective, mass, buoyancy, light or other physical systems work. These piecemeal replacements rarely conform with each other, finally leaving many flat-Earth claimants to agree that such phenomena remain \\"mysteries\\" and more investigation is to be done. In this conclusion, adherents remain open to all explanations except the commonly accepted globular Earth model, shifting the debate from ignorance to denialism. = Genetically modified foods = There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation. However, opponents have objected to GM foods on grounds including safety. Psychological analyses indicate that over 70% of GM food opponents in the US are \\"absolute\\" in their opposition, experience disgust at the thought of eating GM foods, and are \\"evidence insensitive\\". = Statins = Statin denialism is a rejection of the medical worth of statins. Cardiologist Steven Nissen at Cleveland Clinic has commented \\"We are losing the battle for the hearts and minds of our patients to Web sites...\\" promoting unproven medical therapies. Harriet Hall sees a spectrum of \\"statin denialism\\" ranging from pseudoscientific claims to the understatement of benefits and overstatement of side effects, all of which is contrary to the scientific evidence. Historical = The Holocaust = The term has been used with \\"Holocaust denialism\\" as \\"the refusal to accept an empirically verifiable reality. It is an essentially irrational action that withholds validation of a historical experience or event.\\"Paul O'Shea, A Cross Too Heavy: Eugenio Pacelli, Politics and the Jews of Europe 1917‚Äì1943, Rosenberg Publishing, 2008. . p.20.

He became a Capuchin and was later Guardian of the Capuchin Friary at Meudon. Vicar-General of Louisiana From the beginning of French involvement in the area, Louisiana had been placed under the Bishop of Quebec. In August, 1717, the Duc d'Orl√©ans, as Regent of France, issued letters patent establishing a joint-stock company to be called \\"The Company of the West\\", to which Louisiana was transferred. The company applied to the Bishop of Quebec for priests, and on 16 May 1722, Louisiana was divided into three vicariates. The district north of the Ohio was entrusted to the Society of Jesus and the Priests of the Foreign Missions of Paris and Quebec; that between the Mississippi and the Rio Perdito, to the Discalced Carmelite Fathers with headquarters at Mobile. The Carmelites were recalled, not long after, and their district was given to the Capuchins. A different arrangement was made for the Indian and new French settlements on the lower Mississippi.Points, Marie Louise. \\"New Orleans.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 22 February 2019 With the Capuchins of New Orleans reporting directly to a Capuchin bishop in Paris (Mornay), this meant that the Church in Louisiana had a good deal of autonomy, \\"...separate from Quebec for all practical purposes -as the Capuchins expanded into Mobile and other nearby settlements.\\"Starr, Kevin. Continental Ambitions: Roman Catholics in North America: The Colonial Experience, Ignatius Press, 2016 Because of the remoteness of this district from Quebec, in 1713 Mornay was appointed, at the request of Jean-Baptiste de Saint-Vallier, Bishop of Quebec, his coadjutor. On 22 April 1714 Mornay was consecrated titular bishop of Eumenia. Bishop Saint-Vallier appointed him vicar-general for Louisiana. Bishop Saint- Vallier wrote asking him to go to Louisiana. The King tried to impress upon him the importance of his presence in Quebec. But nothing could prevail on him to cross the ocean. Canada and its Provinces, vol. 2, (Adam Shortt and Arthur G. Doughty, eds.), Toronto. Glawgow, Brook & Co., 1914, p. 430 Mornay did what he could through correspondence. When the Company of the West applied to him for priests for the lower Mississippi Valley he offered the more populous field of colonists to the Capuchin Fathers of the province of Champaigne, who, however, did not take any immediate steps, and it was not until 1720 that any of the order came to Louisiana. In 1721 New Orleans, named after the Duc d'Orl√©ans, was described by Father Roulleaux de la Vente as \\"a little village of about one hundred cabins dotted here and there, a large wooden warehouse in which I said Mass, a chapel in course of construction and two storehouses\\". In 1722 Bishop Mornay entrusted the spiritual jurisdiction of the Indians to the Jesuits, who were to establish missions in all parts of Louisiana with residence at New Orleans, but were not to exercise any ecclesiastical function there without the consent of the Capuchins, though they were to minister to the French in the Illinois District, with the Priests of the Foreign Missions, where the superior of each body was a vicar-general, just as the Capuchin superior was at New Orleans. Bishop of Quebec Bishop Saint-Vallier died on December 26, 1727 at the H√¥pital-G√©n√©ral de Qu√©bec which he had founded in 1692.\\"Archdiocese of Quebec\\", The Official Catholic Directory for the Year of Our Lord 1905, M. H. Wiltzius Company, 1905 In March 1728, before news of Saint-Vallier's death reached Paris, Morney resigned as coadjutor. His resignation was accepted and Abb√© Machuco de Presnaux was named in his place. However, as Mornay was named coadjutor with right of succession, He became, de facto, Bishop of Quebec immediately upon Saint-Vallier's death, thus, rendering both the later resignation and appointment null and void. Fearing any confusion a resignation might inspire, Mornay wrote to Archdeacon Louis- Eustache Chartier de Lotbiniere asking him to take possession of the See in his name. However, a dispute had arisen between Lotbiniere and the Canons over who should preside over Saint-Valleir's funeral. It became a long and bitter dispute over precedence with the canons refusing to acknowledge Lotbiniere's authority and Canon Boullard placing the H√¥pital-G√©n√©ral under interdict and removing the Mother Superior from office. The civil authorities attempted to arbitrate the matter. When the King was informed, he restored order. And still, Mornay declined to proceed to his See.Scott, Henry Arthur. \\"Archdiocese of Quebec.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 22 February 2019 In May 1729, Pierre-Herman Dosquet was appointed administrator of the diocese; the following year Dosquet was appointed coadjutor. Faced with the responsibility but not the revenues attached to the bishopric of Quebec, in 1732 Dosquet he returned to France to either get Mornay to come to Quebec or resign. Mornay was then about seventy years old. Dosquet persuaded the King's minister to write Mornay a severe letter, whereupon Mornay tendered his resignation. Dosquet became Bishop of Quebec. Mornay died in Paris, where he lived since 1713 on November 28, 1741.

Life Rhind was born at 15 Gayfield Place in Edinburgh in 1808, the son of John Rhind.Edinburgh Post Office directory 1808 His father at the time of his birth is listed as a \\"writer\\" (a standard Scots term for a lawyer) but later became a cashier to the Edinburgh Friendly Insurance Company). His wife, David's mother, was named Marion Anderson. David Rhind was married twice: firstly to Emily Shoubridge in 1840; then to Mary Jane Sackville-Pearson in 1845. He lived until 1883 and was survived by eight of his children. He is believed to have trained in the London drawing office of Augustus Charles Pugin and was a friend of Charles Barry. His practice began in Edinburgh, but examples of his work were constructed all over Scotland. David worked in conjunction with Alexander Handyside Ritchie who executed much of the sculptural work on his buildings. David Rhind's work included many branches of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, including their headquarters on George Street, Edinburgh, which is now The Dome bar and restaurant. Other buildings for the Commercial Bank, now part of the Royal Bank of Scotland, were constructed as far apart as Thurso and Jedburgh. He also designed a number of churches, local government buildings, schools, offices and private residences such as Carlowrie Castle. One of his grandest schemes was Daniel Stewart's Hospital, now Stewart's Melville College, Edinburgh. He employed Neo-Classical and Baronial styles (amongst others) during his work. In 1849, Rhind was commissioned by Sir John Maxwell, 8th Baronet, to design the lay-out of the Pollokshields area of Glasgow, in what until then had been farmland south of the city centre. He spent most of his working life (plus living with his family until retiral in 1877) at 54 Great King Street in the Second New Town of Edinburgh.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office directories 1849‚Äì1877 He was responsible for training John Dick Peddie, Robert Morham, James W Smith, Hippolyte Blanc, John Russell Walker and James McGlashen Ross.

The war gained religious undertones when rebellious Huguenot princes joined Cond√©'s revolt. Negotiations and terms Negotiations between the court and Cond√© took place at Loudun between February and May and were conducted by the secretary of state, Nicolas de Neufville, Marquis de Villeroy.. P√®re Joseph, a confidant of Armand-Jean du Plessis (at the time Bishop of Lu√ßon and Queen Anne's grand almoner, later to become Cardinal Richelieu and first minister), also took part. The treaty was signed by Marie and Cond√© on 3 May 1616 and officially ended the revolts by many nobles in France at the cost of royal concessions and reparations to Cond√© and others. Based on the terms of the treaty, the Huguenots were allowed to unite their churches in France with those in B√©arn.. Moreover, the treaty granted amnesty to Cond√© along with others and made Cond√© head of the council of state. Concini was removed as lieutenant-general of Picardy and governor of Amiens, while Cond√© received one and a half million livres. Aftermath Concini remained with quite a bit of power as the favorite of Marie, who eventually made Cond√© also give his support. Du Plessis, a supporter of Concini, was made conseiller d'√©tat late in May, and Concini got Villeroy removed from his post as councillor in June (although this did not take full effect until 9 August). Concini was also made lieutenant-general in Normandy and governor of Caen and received a sweetener of 300,000 livres. He was widely unpopular for being a foreigner (an Italian from Florence), and his receipt of these emoluments again inspired many nobles to think of revolting. Cond√© meanwhile forsook good governance in an attempt for increased personal power and the throne.. After Cond√© told Concini that he could not longer protect him from the nobles, Marie decided to take steps to protect her favorite. Louis XIII went along with Marie's plan to arrest Cond√©, inviting Cond√© to a small chat and using palace guards to arrest him on 1 September 1616. Cond√©'s followers then fled from Paris. Thus, the peace was broken and war broke out again between the supporters of Concini and Cond√©'s followers. The war ended with Louis XIII's coup d'√©tat of 24 April 1617, when Concini was arrested, but reportedly resisted and was killed.

It was in circulation among people in the radical community in the United States from 1933-1934\\\\. The first issue of Mother Earth journal was published in 1933. It borrowed its title from the original magazine of that name by Emma Goldman and others, which was published from 1906 to 1917. The couple John G. Scott and Jo Ann Wheeler were the editors of all seventeen issues of Mother Earth journal, which they published until 1934. The first sixteen issues were printed in Craryville, New York. Scott and Wheeler printed the final issue after leaving Craryville to live and teach in the Ferrer Colony and Ferrer Modern School, where their two children attended school. Scott was a teacher of nature studies for about five years. Wheeler was an art and reading teacher in the Modern Schools for seventeen years. In addition to teaching and publishing the journal Mother Earth, the couple farmed a small piece of land in East Taghkanic, New York, following the guidelines of Thoreau‚Äôs Walden.

The Francisco Ferrer Association, established in the east coast of the United States by Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman and other anarchists, led to the formation of Modern Schools in many parts of the United States. These anarchist leaders published the original Mother Earth magazine until August 1917, after Goldman was jailed for speaking against the draft and against the participation of the United States in the First World War. Wheeler stated to her son, Jon Thoreau Scott, and granddaughter, Nina Scott Frisch, that her journal was named after Goldman‚Äôs to honour the original Mother Earth and the work of earlier anarchists. During its publication, the original Mother Earth magazine was a major periodical of the anarchist movement. The Craryville version Mother Earth was primarily written and edited by Scott and Wheeler, with illustrations by Wheeler. It included contributions from leading anarchists of the time, including Tom Bell, Laurance Labadie and Carl Nold. Articles debated political issues of the time, including Marxism versus Anarchism, free schools, freedom of speech, and workplace organizing through the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and other unions. Other topics included organic and collective farming. The journal described the methods of farming used and way of life in rural upstate New York during the 1930s, and includes discussions from meetings of the United Farmers Protective Association, the National Farmers Holiday Association, and similar organizations.

The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was carried out in a CIA-led operation with Joint Special Operations Command, commonly known as JSOC, coordinating the Special Mission Units involved in the raid. In addition to SEAL Team Six, participating units under JSOC included the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)‚Äîalso known as \\"Night Stalkers\\"‚Äîand operators from the CIA's Special Activities Division, which recruits heavily from former JSOC Special Mission Units. The operation ended a nearly 10-year search for bin Laden, following his role in the September 11 attacks on the United States. The raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan was launched from Afghanistan. U.S. military officials said that after the raid U.S. forces took the body of bin Laden to Afghanistan for identification, then buried it at sea within 24 hours of his death in accordance with Islamic tradition. Al-Qaeda confirmed the death on May6 with posts made on militant websites, vowing to avenge the killing. Other Pakistani militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, vowed retaliation against the U.S. and against Pakistan for not preventing the operation.Varun Vira and Anthony Cordesman, \\"Pakistan: Violence versus Stability\\", Center for Strategic and International Studies, July 25, 2011. The raid was supported by over 90% of the American public, was welcomed by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union and a large number of governments, but was condemned by others, including two-thirds of the Pakistani public.Pakistanis Criticize U.S. Action That Killed Osama Bin Laden Gallup. May 18, 2011, Legal and ethical aspects of the killing, such as his not being taken alive despite being unarmed, were questioned by others, including Amnesty International. Also controversial was the decision not to release any photographic or DNA evidence of bin Laden's death to the public. In the aftermath of the killing, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani formed a commission under Senior Justice Javed Iqbal to investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack. The resulting Abbottabad Commission Report, which revealed Pakistani state military and intelligence authorities' \\"collective failure\\" that enabled bin Laden to hide in Pakistan for nine years, was leaked to Al Jazeera on July 8, 2013.  The search for bin Laden  Accounts of how bin Laden was located by U.S. intelligence differ. The White House and CIA director John Brennan stated that the process began with a fragment of information unearthed in 2002, resulting in years of investigation. This account states that by September 2010, these leads followed a courier to the Abbottabad compound, where the U.S. began intensive multiplatform surveillance. According to journalist Seymour Hersh and NBC News, the U.S. was tipped off about bin Laden's location by a Pakistani intelligence officer who offered details of where the Pakistani Intelligence Service held him in detention in exchange for a bounty. = ISI walk-in places bin Laden in Abbottabad = In August 2010, a former Pakistani intelligence officer approached the U.S. embassy station chief in Islamabad and offered to reveal bin Laden's location, in return for the $25 million reward, according to a retired senior U.S. intelligence official. This story was corroborated by two U.S. intelligence officials speaking to NBC News, and had been previously reported by intelligence analyst Raelynn Hillhouse. The Pakistani official informed U.S. intelligence that bin Laden had been located by the Pakistani intelligence service ISI in 2006, and held under house arrest near Pakistani intelligence and military centers ever since. The official passed polygraph tests, after which the U.S. began local and satellite surveillance of bin Laden's Abbottabad residence. According to the retired senior U.S. intelligence official speaking to Hersh, bin Laden was ill at this point, financially supported by some within Saudi Arabia, and kept by the ISI to better manage their complex relationship with Pakistani and Afghan Islamist groups. According to the official, retired CIA officials emphasized the importance of bin Laden's courier to the press, because they were nervous over torture scrutiny and possible prosecution. In May 2015, the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported that Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND) was aware that bin Laden was in Pakistan with the knowledge of Pakistani intelligence services. The BND informed the CIA that bin Laden was in Pakistan and Bild am Sonntag states that the CIA then found his precise location through a courier. Der Spiegel questioned the veracity of the report, produced in the midst of a scandal over BND and NSA collaboration. = Identity of courier = According to the earlier official version of his identification from a U.S. official, identification of al-Qaeda couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA black sites and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, because bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders. Bin Laden was known not to use phones after 1998, when the U.S. had launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan in August by tracking an associate's satellite phone. The U.S. official had stated that by 2002, interrogators had heard uncorroborated claims about an al-Qaeda courier with the kunya Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (sometimes referred to as Sheikh Abu Ahmed from Kuwait). One of those claims came from Mohammed al-Qahtani, a detainee interrogated for 48 days more or less continuously between November 23, 2002, and January 11, 2003. At some point during this period, al-Qahtani told interrogators about a man known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti who was part of the inner circle of al-Qaeda.Bergen, Peter \\"'Zero Dark Thirty': Did torture really net bin Laden?\\" CNN, December 11, 2012. Later in 2003, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged operational chief of al-Qaeda, said he was acquainted with al- Kuwaiti but that the man was not active in al-Qaeda, according to a U.S. official. According to a U.S. official, in 2004 a prisoner named Hassan Ghul revealed that bin Laden relied on a trusted courier known as al-Kuwaiti. Ghul said al-Kuwaiti was close to bin Laden as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed's successor Abu Faraj al-Libbi. Ghul revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with bin Laden. When confronted with Ghul's account, Mohammed maintained his original story. Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guant√°namo in September 2006. He told CIA interrogators that bin Laden's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al- Kuwaiti. Because both Mohammed and al-Libbi had minimized al-Kuwaiti's importance, officials speculated that he was part of bin Laden's inner circle. In 2007, officials learned al-Kuwaiti's real name, though they said they would disclose neither the name nor how they learned it. Pakistani officials in 2011 stated the courier's name was Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed, from Pakistan's Swat Valley. He and his brother Abrar and their families were living at bin Laden's compound, the officials said.Gannon, Kathy, \\"Bin Laden's trusted confidante identified\\", Military Times, June 1, 2011. The name Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan appears in the JTF-GTMO detainee assessment for Abu Faraj al-Libbi released by WikiLeaks on April 24, 2011, but the CIA never found anyone named Maulawi Jan and concluded that the name was an invention of al-Libbi. A 2010 wiretap of another suspect picked up a conversation with al-Kuwaiti. CIA paramilitary operatives located al-Kuwaiti in August 2010 and followed him back to the Abbottabad compound, which led them to speculate it was bin Laden's location. The courier and a relative (who was either a brother or a cousin) were killed in the May 2, 2011 raid. Afterward, some locals identified the men as Pashtuns named Arshad and Tareq Khan. Arshad Khan was carrying an old, noncomputerized Pakistani identification card, which identified him as from Khat Kuruna, a village near Charsadda in northwestern Pakistan. Pakistani officials have found no record of an Arshad Khan in that area and suspect the men were living under false identities. = Bin Laden's compound = View of the compound The CIA used surveillance photos and intelligence reports to determine the identities of the inhabitants of the Abbottabad compound to which the courier was traveling. In September 2010, the CIA concluded that the compound was custom-built to hide someone of significance, very likely bin Laden. Officials surmised that he was living there with his youngest wife and family. Built in 2004, the three-story compound was at the end of a narrow dirt road. Google Earth maps made from satellite photographs show that the compound was not present in 2001 but had been built by the time that new images were taken in 2005. It is located northeast of the city center of Abbottabad. Abbottabad is about from the Afghanistan border on the far eastern side of Pakistan (about from India). The compound is southwest of the Pakistan Military Academy. Located on a plot of land eight times larger than those of nearby houses, the compound was surrounded by a concrete wall topped with barbed wire. It had two security gates, and the third-floor balcony had a privacy wall, tall enough to hide the bin Laden. The compound had no Internet or landline telephone service. Its residents burned their refuse, unlike their neighbors, who set their garbage out for collection. Local residents called the building the Waziristan Haveli, because they believed the owner was from Waziristan. Following the American raid and killing of bin Laden, the Pakistani government demolished the compound in February 2012. = Intelligence gathering = CIA aerial photo of the compound The CIA led the effort to surveil and gather intelligence on the compound; other critical roles in the operation were played by other United States agencies, including the National Security Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and U.S. Defense Department. U.S. officials told The Washington Post that the intelligence-gathering effort \\"was so extensive and costly that the CIA went to Congress in December [2010] to secure authority to reallocate tens of millions of dollars within assorted agency budgets to fund it.\\" The CIA rented a home in Abbottabad from which a team staked out and observed the compound over a number of months. The CIA team used informants and other techniques‚Äîincluding a widely criticized fake polio vaccination program‚Äî to gather intelligence on the compound. The safe house was abandoned immediately after bin Laden's death. The U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency helped the Joint Special Operations Command create mission simulators for the pilots, and analyzed data from an RQ-170 drone before, during and after the raid on the compound. The NGA created three-dimensional renderings of the house, created schedules describing residential traffic patterns, and assessed the number, height and gender of the residents of the compound. Also involved in the intelligence gathering measures were an arm of the National Security Agency known as the Tailored Access Operations group which, among other things, is specialized in surreptitiously installing spyware and tracking devices on targeted computers and mobile-phone networks. Because of the work of the Tailored Access Operations group, the NSA could collect intelligence from mobile phones that were used by al-Qaeda operatives and other \\"persons of interest\\" in the hunt for bin Laden. The design of bin Laden's compound may have ultimately contributed to his discovery. A former CIA official involved in the manhunt told The Washington Post: \\"The place was three stories high, and you could watch it from a variety of angles.\\" The CIA used a process called \\"red teaming\\" on the collected intelligence to independently review the circumstantial evidence and available facts of their case that bin Laden was living at the Abbottabad compound. An administration official said, \\"We conducted red-team exercises and other forms of alternative analysis to check our work. No other candidate fit the bill as well as bin Laden did.\\" Despite what officials described as an extraordinarily concentrated collection effort leading up to the operation, no U.S. spy agency was ever able to capture a photograph of bin Laden at the compound before the raid or a recording of the voice of the mysterious male figure whose family occupied the structure's top two floors.  Operation Neptune Spear  The official mission code name was Operation Neptune Spear. Neptune's spear is the trident, which appears on the U.S. Navy's Special Warfare insignia, with the three prongs of the trident representing the operational capacity of SEALs on sea, air and land. = Objective = The Associated Press reported at the time two U.S. officials as stating the operation was \\"a kill-or-capture mission, since the U.S. doesn't kill unarmed people trying to surrender\\", but that \\"it was clear from the beginning that whoever was behind those walls had no intention of surrendering\\". White House counterterrorism advisor John O. Brennan said after the raid: \\"If we had the opportunity to take bin Laden alive, if he didn't present any threat, the individuals involved were able and prepared to do that.\\" CIA Director Leon Panetta said on PBS NewsHour: \\"The authority here was to kill bin Laden. ... Obviously under the rules of engagement, if he in fact had thrown up his hands, surrendered and didn't appear to be representing any kind of threat, then they were to capture him. But, they had full authority to kill him.\\" A U.S. national security official, who was not named, told Reuters that \\"'this was a kill operation', making clear there was no desire to try to capture bin Laden alive in Pakistan\\". Another source referencing a \\"kill\\" (rather than \\"capture\\") order stated, \\"Officials described the reaction of the special operators when they were told a number of weeks ago that they had been chosen to train for the mission. 'They were told, \\"We think we found Osama bin Laden, and your job is to kill him,\\"' an official recalled. \\"The SEALs started to cheer.\\" An article published in Political Science Quarterly in 2016 surveyed various published accounts and interpretations of the objective of the mission and concluded that \\"the capture option was mainly there for appearance's sake and to fulfill requirements of international law and that everyone involved considered it for all practical purposes a mission to kill.\\" = Planning and final decision = The CIA briefed Vice Admiral William H. McRaven, the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), about the compound in January 2011. McRaven said a commando raid would be fairly straightforward but he was concerned about the Pakistani response. He assigned a captain from the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) to work with a CIA team at their campus in Langley, Virginia. The captain, named \\"Brian\\", set up an office in the printing plant in the CIA's Langley compound and, with six other JSOC officers, began to plan the raid. Administration attorneys considered legal implications and options before the raid. In addition to a helicopter raid, planners considered attacking the compound with B-2 Spirit stealth bombers. They also considered a joint operation with Pakistani forces. Obama decided that the Pakistani government and military could not be trusted to maintain operational security for the operation against bin Laden. \\"There was a real lack of confidence that the Pakistanis could keep this secret for more than a nanosecond,\\" a senior adviser to the President told The New Yorker. Obama met with the National Security Council on March 14 to review the options; he was concerned that the mission would be exposed and wanted to proceed quickly. For that reason he ruled out involving the Pakistanis. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and other military officials expressed doubts as to whether bin Laden was in the compound, and whether a commando raid was worth the risk. At the end of the meeting, the president seemed to be leaning toward a bombing mission. Two U.S. Air Force officers were tasked with exploring that option further. The CIA was unable to rule out the existence of an underground bunker below the compound. Presuming that one existed, 32 bombs fitted with JDAM guidance systems would be required to destroy it. With that amount of ordnance, at least one other house was in the blast radius. Estimates were that up to a dozen civilians would be killed in addition to those in the compound. Furthermore, it was unlikely there would be enough evidence remaining to prove that bin Laden was dead. Presented with this information at the next Security Council meeting on March 29, Obama put the bombing plan on hold. Instead he directed Admiral McRaven to develop the plan for a helicopter raid. The U.S. intelligence community also studied an option of hitting bin Laden with a drone-fired small tactical munition as he paced in his compound's vegetable garden., p. 144 McRaven hand-picked a team drawing from the most experienced and senior operators from Red Squadron, one of four that make up DEVGRU. Red Squadron was coming home from Afghanistan and could be redirected without attracting attention. The team had language skills and experience with cross-border operations into Pakistan. Almost all the Red Squadron operators had ten or more deployments to Afghanistan. Without being told the exact nature of their mission, the team performed rehearsals of the raid in two locations in the U.S.‚Äîaround April 10 at Harvey Point Defense Testing Activity facility in North Carolina where a 1:1 version of bin Laden's compound was built, and April 18 in Nevada. The location in Nevada was at elevation‚Äîchosen to test the effects the altitude would have on the raiders' helicopters. The Nevada mock-up used chain-link fences to simulate the compound walls, which left the U.S. participants unaware of the potential effects of the high compound walls on the helicopters' lift capabilities. Planners believed the SEALs could get to Abbottabad and back without being challenged by the Pakistani military. The helicopters (modified Black Hawk helicopters) to be used in the raid had been designed to be quiet and to have low radar visibility. Since the U.S. had helped equip and train the Pakistanis, their defensive capabilities were known. The U.S. had supplied F-16 Fighting Falcons to Pakistan on the condition they were kept at a Pakistani military base under 24-hour U.S. surveillance. If bin Laden surrendered, he would be held near Bagram Air Base. If the SEALs were discovered by the Pakistanis in the middle of the raid, Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen would call Pakistan's army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and try to negotiate their release. When the National Security Council (NSC) met again on April 19, Obama gave provisional approval for the helicopter raid. Worried that the plan for dealing with the Pakistanis was too uncertain, Obama asked Admiral McRaven to equip the team to fight its way out if necessary. McRaven and the SEALs left for Afghanistan to practice at a one- acre, full-scale replica of the compound built on a restricted area of Bagram known as Camp Alpha. The team departed the U.S. from Naval Air Station Oceana on April 26 in a C-17 aircraft, refueled on the ground at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, landed at Bagram Air Base, then moved to Jalalabad on April 27. On April 28, Admiral Mullen explained the final plan to the NSC. As a measure to bolster the \\"fight your way out\\" scenario, Chinook helicopters were to be positioned nearby with additional troops. The greater part of the advisers in the meeting supported going forward with the raid. Only Vice President Biden completely opposed it. Gates advocated using the drone missile option but changed his support the next day to the helicopter raid plan. Obama said he wanted to speak directly to Admiral McRaven before he gave the order to proceed. The president asked if McRaven had learned anything since arriving in Afghanistan that caused him to lose confidence in the mission. McRaven told him the team was ready and that the next few nights would have little moonlight over Abbottabad, good conditions for a raid. On April 29 at 8:20 a.m. EDT, Obama conferred with his advisers and gave the final go-ahead. The raid would take place the following day. That evening the president was informed that the operation would be delayed one day due to cloudy weather. On April 30, Obama called McRaven one more time to wish the SEALs well and to thank them for their service. That evening, the President attended the annual White House Correspondent's Association dinner, which was hosted by comedian and television actor Seth Meyers. At one point, Meyers joked: \\"People think bin Laden is hiding in the Hindu Kush, but did you know that every day from four to five he hosts a show on C-SPAN?\\" Obama laughed, despite his knowledge of the operation to come. On May 1 at 1:22 p.m., Panetta, acting on the president's orders, directed McRaven to move forward with the operation. Shortly after 3 p.m., the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing in the corner of the screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: \\"Contrary to some news reports and what you see in the movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day.\\"quotes from Hillary Clinton's book, Hard Choices, as quoted in Daily Telegraph, June 10, 2014 Two other command centers monitored the raid from the Pentagon and the U.S. embassy in Islamabad. = Execution of the operation =  Approach and entry  Osama bin Laden's hideout, showing the high concrete walls that surround the compound The raid was carried out by approximately two dozen heliborne U.S. Navy SEALs from DEVGRU's Red Squadron. For legal reasons (namely that the U.S. was not at war with Pakistan), the military personnel assigned to the mission were temporarily transferred to the control of the civilian Central Intelligence Agency. The SEALs operated in teams and used weapons including the HK416 assault rifle (their primary weapon), the Mark 48 machine gun for fire support, and the MP7 personal defense weapon used by some SEALs for close quarters and greater silence. According to The New York Times, a total of \\"79 commandos and a dog\\" were involved in the raid. The military working dog was a Belgian Malinois named Cairo. According to one report, the dog was tasked with tracking \\"anyone who tried to escape and to alert SEALs to any approaching Pakistani security forces\\". The dog was to be used to help deter any Pakistani ground response to the raid and to help look for any hidden rooms or hidden doors in the compound. Additional personnel on the mission included a language interpreter, the dog handler, helicopter pilots, plus intelligence collectors, and navigators using highly classified hyperspectral imagers to view the operation. The SEALs flew into Pakistan from a staging base in the city of Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan after originating at Bagram Air Base in northeastern Afghanistan.Woodward, Calvin, \\"Inside bin Laden's lair with SEAL Team 6\\", Military Times, May 4, 2011. The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), a U.S. Army Special Operations Command unit known as the \\"Night Stalkers\\", provided the two modified Black Hawk helicopters that were used for the raid itself, as well as the much larger Chinook heavy-lift helicopters that were employed as backups. The Black Hawks used previously unseen \\"stealth\\" versions of the helicopter that fly more quietly and are harder to detect on radar than conventional models; due to the weight of the extra stealth equipment on the Black Hawks, cargo was \\"calculated to the ounce, with the weather factored in.\\" The Chinooks kept on standby were on the ground \\"in a deserted area roughly two-thirds of the way\\" from Jalalabad to Abbottabad, with two additional SEAL teams consisting of approximately 24 DEVGRU operators for a \\"quick reaction force\\" (QRF). The Chinooks were equipped with 7.62mm GAU-17/A miniguns and GAU-21/B .50-caliber machine guns and extra fuel for the Black Hawks. Their mission was to interdict any Pakistani military attempts to interfere with the raid. Other Chinooks, holding 25 more SEALs from DEVGRU, were stationed just across the border in Afghanistan in case reinforcements were needed during the operation. The 160th SOAR helicopters were supported by an array of other aircraft, to include fixed-wing fighter jets and drones. According to CNN, \\"the Air Force had a full team of combat search-and-rescue helicopters available\\". The raid was scheduled for a time with little moonlight so the helicopters could enter Pakistan \\"low to the ground and undetected\\". The helicopters used hilly terrain and nap-of-the-earth techniques to reach the compound without appearing on radar and alerting the Pakistani military. The flight from Jalalabad to Abbottabad took about 90 minutes. According to the mission plan, the first helicopter would hover over the compound's yard while its full team of SEALs fast-roped to the ground. At the same time, the second helicopter would fly to the northeast corner of the compound and deploy the interpreter, the dog and handler, and four SEALs to secure the perimeter. The team in the courtyard was to enter the house from the ground floor. As they hovered above the target the first helicopter experienced a hazardous airflow condition known as a vortex ring state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the helicopter's nose to keep it from tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew, or pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.  Entry into the house  The U.S. national security team gathered in the White House Situation Room to monitor the progress of Operation Neptune Spear The SEALs encountered the residents in the compound's guest house, in its main building on the first floor where two adult males lived, and on the second and third floors where bin Laden lived with his family. The second and third floors were the last section of the compound to be cleared. There were reportedly \\"small knots of children ... on every level, including the balcony of bin Laden's room\\". Osama bin Laden was killed in the raidGal Perl Finkel, Back to the ground?, Israel Hayom, November 8, 2015. and initial versions said three other men and a woman were killed as well: bin Laden's adult son Khalid, bin Laden's courier Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, al-Kuwaiti's brother Abrar, and Abrar's wife Bushra. Conflicting reports of an initial firefight exist. Mark Owen's book states that the team were in a \\"short firefight\\" before reaching bin Laden. An intelligence official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no firefight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti is said to have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team on the first floor of the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son is said to have encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official said only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. The SEALs wore night vision goggles.  Killing of bin Laden  The SEALs encountered bin Laden on the third floor of the main building. Bin Laden was unarmed, \\"wearing the local loose-fitting tunic and pants known as a kurta paijama\\", which were later found to have ‚Ç¨500 and two phone numbers sewn into the fabric. Bin Laden peered through his bedroom door at the Americans advancing up the stairs, and the lead SEAL fired at him. Reports differ, though agree eventually he was hit by shots to the body and head. The initial shots either missed, hit him in the chest, the side, or in the head.https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/zero-dark-thirty-osama- bin-laden-seals/ see account #4 A number of Bin Laden's female relatives were near him. According to journalist Nicholas Schmidle, one of bin Laden's wives, Amal Ahmed Abdul Fatah, motioned as if she were about to charge; the lead SEAL shot her in the leg, then grabbed both women and shoved them aside. Robert J. O'Neill, who later publicly identified himself as one of the SEALs who shot bin Laden, states that he pushed past the lead SEAL, entered through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. O'Neill states that bin Laden was standing behind a woman with his hands on her shoulders, pushing her forward. O'Neill immediately shot bin Laden twice in the forehead, then once more as bin Laden crumpled to the floor.Warrick, Joby, \\"Ex-SEAL reveals himself as Osama bin Laden shooter \\", The Washington Post, November 7, 2014 Matt Bissonnette gives a conflicting account of the situation, writing that Bin Laden had already been mortally wounded by the lead SEAL's shots from the staircase. The lead SEAL then pushed Bin Laden's wives aside, attempting to shield the SEALs behind him in the case that either woman had an explosive device. After Bin Laden staggered back or fell into the bedroom, Bissonnette and O'Neill entered the room, saw the wounded Bin Laden on the ground, fired multiple rounds, and killed him.Kulish, Nicholas, Christopher Drew, and Sean D. Naylor, \\"Another Ex-Commando Says He Shot Bin Laden\\", The New York Times, November 6, 2014 Journalist Peter Bergen investigated the conflicting claims and found that most of the SEALs present during the raid favored Bissonnette's account of the events. According to Bergen's sources, O'Neill did not mention firing the shots that killed Bin Laden in the after action report following the operations. The weapon used to kill bin Laden was an HK416 using 5.56mm NATO 77-grain OTM (open-tip match) rounds. The SEAL team leader radioed, \\"For God and country‚ÄîGeronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo\\" and then, after being prompted by McRaven for confirmation, \\"Geronimo EKIA\\" (enemy killed in action). Watching the operation in the White House Situation Room, Obama simply said, \\"We got him.\\" Various authors have written that there were two weapons in Bin Laden's room: an AKS-74U carbine and a Russian-made Makarov pistol. According to his wife Amal, Bin Laden was shot before he could reach the AKS-74U. According to the Associated Press, the guns were on a shelf next to the door and the SEALs did not see them until they were photographing the body. According to journalist Matthew Cole, the guns were not loaded and only found later during a search of the third floor. As the SEALs encountered women and children during the raid, they restrained them with plastic handcuffs or zip ties. After the raid was over, U.S. forces moved the surviving residents outside \\"for Pakistani forces to discover\\". The injured Amal Ahmed Abdul Fatah continued to harangue the raiders in Arabic. Bin Laden's 12-year-old daughter Safia was allegedly struck in her foot or ankle by a piece of flying debris. While bin Laden's body was taken by U.S. forces, the bodies of the four others killed in the raid were left behind at the compound and later taken into Pakistani custody.  Conclusion  conducting flight operations in the Persian Gulf (April 4, 2011) The raid was intended to take 40 minutes. The time between the team's entry in and exit from the compound was 38 minutes. According to the Associated Press, the assault was completed in the first 15 minutes. Time in the compound was spent killing defenders, \\"moving carefully through the compound, room to room, floor to floor\\" securing the women and children, clearing \\"weapons stashes and barricades\\" including a false door, and searching the compound for information. U.S. personnel recovered three Kalashnikov rifles and two pistols, ten computer hard drives, documents, DVDs, almost a hundred thumb drives, a dozen cell phones, and \\"electronic equipment\\" for later analysis. The SEALs also discovered a large amount of opium stored in the house. Since the helicopter that had made the emergency landing was damaged and unable to fly the team out, it was destroyed to safeguard its classified equipment, including an apparent stealth capability. The pilot smashed \\"the instrument panel, the radio, and the other classified fixtures inside the cockpit\\", and the SEALs \\"[packed] the helicopter with explosives and [blew] it up\\". Since the SEAL team was reduced to one operational helicopter, one of the two Chinooks held in reserve was dispatched to carry part of the team and bin Laden's body out of Pakistan. While the official Department of Defense narrative did not mention the airbases used in the operation, later accounts indicated that the helicopters returned to Bagram Airfield. The body of Osama bin Laden was flown from Bagram to the aircraft carrier in a V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft escorted by two U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jets.Gertz, Bill, \\"Inside the Ring: Osama's Escorts\\", The Washington Times, May 12, 2011, p. 10.Capaccio, Tony, \\"V-22 Osprey Flew Osama Bin Laden To Navy Ship After Death\\", Bloomberg News, June 14, 2011.  Burial of bin Laden  According to U.S. officials, bin Laden was buried at sea because no country would accept his remains. Before disposing of the body, the U.S. called the Saudi Arabian government, who approved of burying the body in the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10 a.m. local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11 a.m. The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board. The board was tilted upward on one side and the body slid off into the sea. In Worthy Fights: A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace, Leon Panetta wrote that bin Laden's body was draped in a white shroud, given final prayers in Arabic and placed inside a black bag loaded with of iron chains, apparently to ensure that it would sink and never float. The body bag was placed on a white table at the rail of the ship, and the table was tipped to let the body bag slide into the sea, but the body bag did not slide and took the table with it. The table bobbed on the surface while the weighted body sank.  Pakistan‚ÄìU.S. communication  According to Obama administration officials, U.S. officials did not share information about the raid with the government of Pakistan until it was over. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen called Pakistan's army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani at about 3 am local time to inform him of the operation. According to the Pakistani foreign ministry, the operation was conducted entirely by the U.S. forces. Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officials said they were present at what they called a joint operation; President Asif Ali Zardari flatly denied this. Pakistan's foreign secretary Salman Bashir later confirmed that Pakistani military had scrambled F-16s after they became aware of the attack but that they reached the compound after the U.S. helicopters had left.  Identification of the body  U.S. forces used multiple methods to positively identify the body of Osama bin Laden: * Measurement of the body: Both the corpse and bin Laden were ; SEALs on the scene did not have a tape measure to measure the corpse, so a SEAL of known height lay down next to the body and the height was so approximated by comparison. Obama quipped: \\"We donated a $60 million helicopter to this operation. Could we not afford to buy a tape measure?\\" * Facial recognition software: A photograph transmitted by the SEALs to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, for facial recognition analysis yielded a 90 to 95 percent likely match. * In-person identification: One or two women from the compound, including one of bin Laden's wives, identified bin Laden's body. A wife of bin Laden called him by name during the raid, inadvertently assisting in his identification by U.S. military forces on the ground. * DNA testing: The Associated Press and The New York Times reported that bin Laden's body could be identified by DNA testing using tissue and blood samples taken from his sister who had died of brain cancer. ABC News stated, \\"Two samples were taken from bin Laden: one of these DNA samples was analyzed, and information was sent electronically back to Washington, D.C., from Bagram. Someone else from Afghanistan is physically bringing back a sample.\\" A military medic took bone marrow and swabs from the body to use for the DNA testing. According to a senior U.S. Department of Defense official: * Inference: Per the same DoD official, from the initial review of the materials removed from the Abbottabad compound the Department \\"assessed that much of this information, including personal correspondence between Osama bin Laden and others, as well as some of the video footage ... would only have been in his possession.\\" = Local accounts = Beginning at 12:58 a.m. local time (19:58 UTC), Abbottabad resident Sohaib Athar sent a series of tweets starting with \\"Helicopter hovering above Abbottabad at 1AM (is a rare event).\\" By 1:44 a.m. all was quiet until a plane flew over the city at 3:39 a.m. Neighbors took to their roofs and watched as U.S. special operations forces stormed the compound. One neighbor said, \\"I saw soldiers emerging from the helicopters and advancing towards the house. Some of them instructed us in chaste Pashto to turn off the lights and stay inside.\\" Another man said he heard shooting and screams, then an explosion as a grounded helicopter was destroyed. The blast broke his bedroom window and left charred debris over a nearby field. A local security officer said he entered the compound shortly after the Americans left, before it was sealed off by the army. \\"There were four dead bodies, three male and one female and one female was injured\\", he said. \\"There was a lot of blood on the floor and one could easily see the marks like a dead body had been dragged out of the compound.\\" Numerous witnesses reported that power, and possibly cellphone service, went out around the time of the raid and apparently included the military academy. Accounts differed as to the exact time of the blackout. One journalist concluded after interviewing several residents that it was a routine rolling blackout. ISI reported after questioning survivors of the raid that there were 17 to 18 people in the compound at the time of the attack and that the Americans took away one person still alive, possibly a bin Laden son. The ISI said that survivors included a wife, a daughter and eight to nine other children, not apparently bin Laden's. An unnamed Pakistani security official was quoted as saying one of bin Laden's daughters told Pakistani investigators that bin Laden had been captured alive, then in front of family members was shot dead by U.S. forces and dragged to a helicopter.\\"Differing accounts emerge of bin Laden raid\\". NBC News. May 4, 2011. = Compound residents = U.S. officials said there were 22 people in the compound. Five were killed, including Osama bin Laden. Pakistani officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors. The Sunday Times subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide, presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid, containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents. The guide listed several adult children of bin Laden and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound. Because of a lack of accurate information, some of what follows cannot be verified as true. * Five adults dead: Osama bin Laden, 54; Khalid, his son by Siham (identified as Hamza in early accounts), 23; Arshad Khan, a.k.a. Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, the courier, described as the \\"flabby\\" one by The Sunday Times, 33; Abu Ahmed al- Kuwaiti's brother Abrar, 30; and Bushra, Abrar's wife, age unknown. * Four surviving women: Khairiah, bin Laden's third, Saudi wife a.k.a. Um Hamza, 62; Siham, bin Laden's fourth, Saudi wife a.k.a. Um Khalid, 54; Amal, bin Laden's fifth, Yemeni wife, a.k.a. Amal Ahmed Abdul Fatah, 29 (injured); and Mariam, Arshad Khan's Pakistani wife. * Five minor children of Osama and Amal: Safia, a daughter, 12; a son, 5; another son, age unknown; and infant twin daughters. * Four bin Laden grandchildren from an unidentified daughter who had been killed in an airstrike in Waziristan. Two may be the boys, around 10, who spoke to Pakistani investigators. * Four children of Arshad Khan: Two sons, Abdur Rahman and Khalid, 6or 7; a daughter, age unknown; and another child, age unknown.  Aftermath  = Leaks of the news = Around 9:45 p.m. EDT, the White House announced that the president would be addressing the nation later in the evening. At 10:24:05 p.m. EDT the first public leak was made by Navy Reserve intel officer Keith Urbahn and 47 seconds later by actor and professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson on Twitter. Anonymous government officials confirmed details to the media, and by 11 p.m. numerous major news sources were reporting that bin Laden was dead; the number of leaks were characterized as \\"voluminous\\" by David E. Sanger. = U.S. presidential address = President Obama's address (9:28) Also available: Audio only, At 11:35 p.m., Obama appeared on major television networks: President Obama recalled the victims of the September 11 attacks. He praised the nearly ten- year-old war against al-Qaeda, which he said had disrupted terrorist plots, strengthened homeland defenses, removed the Taliban government, and captured or killed scores of al-Qaeda operatives. Obama said that when he took office he made finding bin Laden the top priority of the war. Bin Laden's death was the most significant blow to al-Qaeda so far but the war would continue. He reaffirmed that the U.S. was not at war against Islam and defended his decision to conduct an operation within Pakistan. He said Americans understood the cost of war but would not stand by while their security was threatened. \\"To those families who have lost loved ones to al-Qaeda's terror,\\" he said, \\"justice has been done.\\" This remark book-ended President Bush's statement to a joint session of Congress following the September 11 attacks that \\"justice will be done.\\" = Reactions = Americans celebrating after the death of Osama bin Laden in front of The White House Woman in Times Square celebrating bin Laden's death Before the official announcement, large crowds spontaneously gathered outside the White House, Ground Zero, The Pentagon, and in New York's Times Square to celebrate. In Dearborn, Michigan, where there is a large Muslim and Arab population, a small crowd gathered outside the City Hall in celebration, many of them being of Middle Eastern descent. From the beginning to the end of Obama's speech, 5,000 tweets per second were posted on Twitter. As news of bin Laden's death filtered through the crowd at a nationally televised Major League Baseball game in Philadelphia between rivals Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Mets, \\"U-S-A!\\" cheers began. In Tampa, Florida, at the conclusion of a professional wrestling event which was occurring at the time, WWE Champion John Cena announced to the audience that bin Laden had been \\"caught and compromised to a permanent end\\", prompting chants while he exited the arena to the march \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\". The deputy leader of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood said that, with bin Laden dead, Western forces should now pull out of Iraq and Afghanistan; authorities in Iran made similar comments. Palestinian Authority leaders had contrasting reactions. Mahmoud Abbas welcomed bin Laden's death, while Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Hamas administration in the Gaza Strip, condemned what he saw as the assassination of an \\"Arab holy warrior\\". The 14th Dalai Lama was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as saying, \\"Forgiveness doesn't mean forget what happened. ... If something is serious and it is necessary to take counter- measures, you have to take counter-measures.\\" This was widely reported as an endorsement of bin Laden's killing and was criticized in Buddhist circles, but another journalist cited a video of the discussion to argue that the comment was taken out of context and the Dalai Lama supports killing only in self- defense. A CBS/The New York Times poll taken after bin Laden's death showed that 16% of Americans feel safer as the result of his death while 60% of Americans of those polled believe killing bin Laden would likely increase the threat of terrorism against the U.S. in the short term. In India, Minister for Home Affairs P. Chidambaram said that bin Laden hiding \\"deep inside\\" Pakistan was a matter of grave concern for India and showed that \\"many of the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks, including the controllers and the handlers of the terrorists who actually carried out the attack, continue to be sheltered in Pakistan\\". He also called on Pakistan to arrest them, amidst calls for similar strikes being conducted by India against Hafiz Saeed and Dawood Ibrahim. = Freedom of Information Act requests and denials = Although the Abbottabad raid has been described in great detail by U.S. officials, no physical evidence constituting \\"proof of death\\" has been offered to the public, neither to journalists nor to independent third parties who have requested this information through the Freedom of Information Act. Numerous organizations filed FOIA requests seeking at least a partial release of photographs, videos, and/or DNA test results, including The Associated Press, Reuters, CBS News, Judicial Watch, Politico, Fox News, Citizens United, and NPR. On April 26, 2012, Judge James E. Boasberg held that the Department of Defense was not required to release any evidence to the public. According to a draft report by the Pentagon's inspector general, Admiral William McRaven, the top special operations commander, ordered the Department of Defense to purge from its computer systems all files on the bin Laden raid after first sending them to the CIA. Any mention of this decision was expunged from the final version of the inspector general's report. According to the Pentagon, this was done to protect the identities of the Navy SEALs involved in the raid. The legal justification for the records transfer is that the SEALs were effectively working for the CIA at the time of the raid, which ostensibly means that any records of the raid belong to the CIA. \\"Documents related to the raid were handled in a manner consistent with the fact that the operation was conducted under the direction of the CIA director\\", CIA agency spokesman Preston Golson said in an emailed statement. \\"Records of a CIA operation such as the (bin Laden) raid, which were created during the conduct of the operation by persons acting under the authority of the CIA Director, are CIA records.\\" Golson said it is absolutely false that records were moved to the CIA to avoid the legal requirements of the Freedom of Information Act. The National Security Archive has criticized this maneuver, saying that the records have now gone into a \\"FOIA black hole\\": > What the transfer really did was ensure that the files would be placed in > the CIA's operational records, a records system that‚Äîdue to the 1986 CIA > Operational Files exemption‚Äîis not subject to the FOIA and is a black hole > for anyone trying to access the files within. The move prevents the public > from accessing the official record about the raid, and bypasses several > important federal records keeping procedures in the process. The United States Defense Department can prevent the release of its own military files citing risks to national security, but that can be contested in court, and a judge can compel the Pentagon to turn over non-sensitive portions of records. The CIA has special authority to prevent the release of operational files in ways that cannot be challenged in federal court. Richard Lardner, reporting for the Associated Press, wrote that the maneuver \\"could represent a new strategy for the U.S. government to shield even its most sensitive activities from public scrutiny.\\" The inspector general's draft report also described how former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta disclosed classified information to the makers of Zero Dark Thirty, including the unit that conducted the raid and the ground commander's name. = Legality =  Under U.S. law  Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, which authorized the President to use \\"necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons\\" he determines were involved in the attacks. The Obama administration justified its use of force by relying on that resolution, as well as international law set forth in treaties and customary laws of war. Most Wanted List on May 3, 2011 John Bellinger III, who served as the U.S. State Department's senior lawyer during President George W. Bush's second term, said the strike was a legitimate military action and did not run counter to the U.S.' self-imposed prohibition on assassinations: > The killing is not prohibited by the long-standing assassination prohibition > in executive order 12333 [signed in 1981], because the action was a military > action in the ongoing U.S. armed conflict with al-Qaeda, and it is not > prohibited to kill specific leaders of an opposing force. The assassination > prohibition does not apply to killings in self-defense. Similarly, Harold Hongju Koh, Legal Adviser of the U.S. State Department, said in 2010 that \\"under domestic law, the use of lawful weapons systems‚Äîconsistent with the applicable laws of war‚Äîfor precision targeting of specific high-level belligerent leaders when acting in self-defense or during an armed conflict is not unlawful, and hence does not constitute 'assassination'.\\" David Scheffer, director of the Northwestern University School of Law Center for International Human Rights, said the fact that bin Laden had previously been indicted in 1998 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for conspiracy to attack U.S. defense installations was a complicating factor. \\"Normally when an individual is under indictment the purpose is to capture that person in order to bring him to court to try him ... The object is not to literally summarily execute him if he's under indictment.\\" Scheffer and another expert stated that it was important to determine whether the mission was to capture bin Laden or to kill him. If the Navy SEALs were instructed to kill bin Laden without trying first to capture him, it \\"may have violated American ideals if not international law.\\"  Under international law  In an address to the Pakistani parliament, Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani said, \\"Our people are rightly incensed on the issue of violation of sovereignty as typified by the covert U.S. air and ground assault on the Osama hideout in Abbottabad. ... The Security Council, while exhorting UN member states to join their efforts against terrorism, has repeatedly emphasized that this be done in accordance with international law, human rights and humanitarian law.\\" Former Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf denied a report in The Guardian that his government made a secret agreement permitting U.S. forces to conduct unilateral raids in search of the top three al-Qaeda leaders. In testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Eric Holder said, \\"The operation against bin Laden was justified as an act of national self-defense. It's lawful to target an enemy commander in the field.\\" He called the killing of bin Laden \\"a tremendous step forward in attaining justice for the nearly 3,000 innocent Americans who were murdered on September 11, 2001.\\" Commenting on the legality under international law, University of Michigan Law Professor Steven Ratner said, \\"A lot of it depends on whether you believe Osama bin Laden is a combatant in a war or a suspect in a mass murder.\\" In the latter case, \\"you would... be able to kill a suspect [only] if they represented an immediate threat\\". Holder testified that bin Laden made no attempt to surrender, and \\"even if he had there would be a good basis on the part of those very brave Navy SEAL team members to do what they did in order to protect themselves and the other people who were in that building.\\" According to Anthony Dworkin, an international law expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, if bin Laden was hors de combat (as his daughter is said to have alleged) that would have been a violation of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions. Former Nuremberg prosecutor Benjamin B. Ferencz said it was unclear if bin Laden's killing was justified self-defense or premeditated illegal assassination, and that \\"killing a captive who poses no immediate threat is a crime under military law as well as all other law,\\" a view also held by legal scholar Philippe Sands. The UN Security Council released a statement applauding the news of bin Laden's death, and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was \\"very much relieved.\\" Two United Nations Special Rapporteurs issued a joint statement seeking more information regarding the circumstances in which bin Laden was killed and cautioning that \\"actions taken by States in combating terrorism, especially in high profile cases, set precedents for the way in which the right to life will be treated in future instances.\\" = Handling of the body = Under Islamic tradition, burial at sea is considered inappropriate when other, preferred forms of burial are available, and several prominent Islamic clerics criticized the decision. Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb, the head of Al-Azhar University, Egypt's seat of Sunni Muslim learning, said the disposal of the body at sea was an affront to religious and human values. Scholars like el-Tayeb hold that sea burials can be allowed only in special cases where the death occurred aboard a ship, and that the regular practice should have occurred in this case‚Äîthe body buried in the ground with the head pointing to Islam's holy city of Mecca. A stated advantage of a burial at sea is that the site is not readily identified or accessed, thus preventing it from becoming a focus of attention or \\"terrorist shrine\\". The Guardian questioned whether bin Laden's grave would have become a shrine, as this is strongly discouraged in Wahhabism. Addressing the same concern, Egyptian Islamic analyst and lawyer Montasser el-Zayat said that if the Americans wished to avoid making a shrine to bin Laden, an unmarked grave on land would have accomplished the same goal. The Guardian also quoted a U.S. official explaining the anticipated difficulty of finding a country that would accept the burial of bin Laden in its soil. A professor of Islamic Law at the University of Jordan stated burying at sea was permitted if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial, but that \\"it's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive bin Laden's body\\". On a similar note, Mohammed al-Qubaisi, Dubai's grand mufti, stated: \\"They can say they buried him at sea, but they cannot say they did it according to Islam. If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: you dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it. Sea burials are permissible for Muslims in extraordinary circumstances. This is not one of them.\\" Khalid Latif, an imam who serves as a chaplain and the director of the Islamic Center of New York University, argued that the sea burial was respectful. Leor Halevi, a professor at Vanderbilt University and the author of Muhammad's Grave: Death Rites and the Making of Islamic Society, explained that Islamic law does not prescribe ordinary funerals for those killed in battle, and pointed to controversy within the Muslim world over whether bin Laden was, as a \\"mass murderer of Muslims\\", entitled to the same respect as mainstream Muslims. At the same time, he suggested that the burial could have been handled with more cultural sensitivity. Omar bin Laden, son of Osama bin Laden, published a complaint on May 10, 2011, that the burial at sea deprived the family of a proper burial.\\"Statement From the Family of Osama bin Laden\\". The New York Times. May 10, 2011. = Bin Laden's will = After bin Laden's death, it was reported he had left a will written a short time after the September 11 attacks in which he urged his children not to join al-Qaeda and not to continue the Jihad. = Release of photographs = CNN cited a senior U.S. official as saying three sets of photographs of bin Laden's body exist: Photos taken at an aircraft hangar in Afghanistan, described as the most recognizable and gruesome; photos taken from the burial at sea on the before a shroud was placed around his body; and photos from the raid itself, which include shots of the interior of the compound as well as three of the others who died in the raid. A source told ABC News that the photos taken by the military servicemen on the scene depict the physical damage done by a high-caliber bullet. CBS Evening News reported that the photo shows that the bullet which hit above bin Laden's left eye blew out his left eyeball and blew away a large portion of his frontal skull, exposing his brain.CBS Evening News, May 4, 2011. CNN stated that the pictures from the Afghanistan hangar depict \\"a massive open head wound across both eyes. It's very bloody and gory.\\" U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe said the photos taken of the body on the Carl Vinson, which showed bin Laden's face after much of the blood and material had been washed away, should be released to the public. A debate on whether the military photos should be released to the public took place. Those supporting the release argued that the photos should be considered public records,Kevin Drum, \\"Public Records Should be.....Public\\"\\" (May 4, 2011).

Those in opposition expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East. Obama decided not to release the photos. In an interview aired on May4 on 60 Minutes, he said: \\"We don't trot out this stuff as trophies. We don't need to spike the football.\\" Obama said that he was concerned with ensuring that \\"very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence, or as a propaganda tool. That's not who we are.\\" Among Republican members of Congress, Senator Lindsey Graham criticized the decision and said he wanted to see the photos released, while Senator John McCain and Representative Mike Rogers, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, supported the decision.James Rosen and Steven Thomma, \\"S.C.

On May 11, selected members of Congress (the congressional leadership and those who serve on the House and Senate intelligence, homeland security, judiciary, foreign relations, and armed forces committees) were shown 15 bin Laden photos. In an interview with Eliot Spitzer, Senator Jim Inhofe said that three of the photos were of bin Laden alive for identification reference. Three other photos were of the burial-at-sea ceremony.Members of Congress see bin Laden photos (May 11, 2011), CNN.

The Defense Department rejected the request, and the AP administratively appealed. = Alternative accounts =  Seal Target Geronimo  A book published in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account as given by U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed at the beginning of the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.Susannah Cahalan, \\"Real Story Of Team 6's Charge\\", New York Post, November 6, 2011, p. 18. Two SEALs broke through the bedroom door. Bin Laden's wife Amal was on the edge of the bed shouting in Arabic at the SEALs, and Osama bin Laden dived across the bed, shoving Amal at the same time, for an AKS-74U kept by the headboard. The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from jumping on the roof to Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds. Around the same time, snipers in the hovering Razor2 helicopter shot and killed Abu Ahmed al- Kuwaiti when he came to the door of the guest house firing an AK-47. One SEAL sniper fired two shots at al-Kuwaiti and the other fired two three-round bursts. Two of the snipers' bullets went through al-Kuwaiti and killed his wife who was standing behind him. The Razor2 team cleared the guest house and then breached their way into the main house with explosives. As the Razor2 team entered the main house, al-Qaeda courier Arshad Khan pointed his AK-47 gun and was killed with two shots. The SEAL team fired a total of 16 shots, killing Osama bin Laden, Khalid bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, and al- Kuwaiti's wife, Arshad Khan, and wounding Osama bin Laden's wife Amal al- Sadah. Twenty minutes into the operation, Razor1 took off from the roof of the main house to reposition to a landing spot outside the compound. As Razor1 was crossing over the courtyard, both \\"green unit\\" flight deck control systems went off line. The helicopter settled slowly, bounced off the ground, and then broke apart as it hit the ground a second time. Both failed green units were removed for later examination. Media accounts had reported that the plan had been to fast rope to the inner courtyard and to clear the main house from the ground floor up. The helicopter crashed in the outer courtyard with the SEAL team still on board. The SEAL team exited and needed to breach two walls and then into the house. As a result, Osama bin Laden was killed several minutes into the operation. Pfarrer's account differs in that he wrote that a SEAL team was inserted onto the roof of the main house, that Osama bin Laden was killed seconds into the operation, and that the main house was cleared from the top down. The Pentagon disputed Pfarrer's account of the raid, calling it \\"incorrect\\". The U.S. Special Operations Command also disputed Pfarrer's account, saying, \\"It's just not true. It's not how it happened.\\"Dozier, Kimberly, (Associated Press), \\"Spec-Ops Command: SEAL raid book 'a lie'\\", Yahoo! News, November 15, 2011; Retrieved November 15, 2011.  No Easy Day  Matt Bissonnette in March 2001 Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL who participated in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which significantly contradicts Pfarrer's account. Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version. According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him on the right side of the head. Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot several rounds into bin Laden's chest until he was motionless. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room‚Äîan AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol‚Äîwere unloaded. Unlike the official account, Bissonnette's version alleges that bin Laden's wife Mariam was uninjured in the raid. In addition, Bissonnette states that the report of bin Laden's daughter Safia having splintered wood striking her foot is false, as he explains that it was rather his wife Amal who was injured by such fragments. The author also asserted that one SEAL sat on bin Laden's chest in a cramped helicopter as his body was flown back to Afghanistan.Fagen, Cynthia R., \\"Navy SEAL reveals: 'The Night I Killed Osama'\\", New York Post, September 2, 2012, p. 18 Bissonnette stated that a search of bin Laden's room after his death uncovered a bottle of Just for Men hair dye.Brook, Tom Vanden, \\"Two Sides Of Story On Revelations By Ex- Navy SEAL\\", USA Today, September 5, 2012, p. 2 In February 2013, Esquire conducted an interview with an anonymous individual called \\"the shooter\\" who said that bin Laden placed one of his wives between himself and the commandos, pushing her towards them. \\"Shooter\\" then claimed bin Laden stood up and had a gun \\"within reach\\" and it was only then that he fired two shots into bin Laden's forehead, killing him. Another member of SEAL Team Six said the story as presented in Esquire was false and \\"complete BS\\".Berge, Peter , CNN, March 27, 2013 Then, in November 2014, former SEAL Robert O'Neill disclosed his identity as the shooter in a series of interviews with The Washington Post.  Hillhouse and Hersh reports  In 2011 American intelligence analyst Raelynn Hillhouse wrote that according to U.S. intelligence sources, the U.S. had been tipped-off to bin Laden's location by an unnamed Pakistani intelligence insider collecting the $25 million reward. According to the sources, Pakistan purposely stood-down its armed forces to allow the U.S. raid, and the original plan was to kill‚Äînot capture‚Äîbin Laden. Hillhouse's sources stated that the Pakistanis had been keeping bin Laden under house arrest near their military headquarters in Abbottabad with money provided by the Saudis. According to The Telegraph, Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S. forces encountered no resistance on their way to and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned to stay in their houses the day before the raid. Hillhouse later also said bin Laden's body had been thrown out of a helicopter over the Hindu Kush. Hillhouse's account was picked up and published in The Daily Telegraph, the National Post, The Vancouver Sun, The Calgary Herald, the Windsor Star, The Daily Mail, and The New Zealand Herald. In May 2015, a detailed article in the London Review of Books by journalist Seymour Hersh said that the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had kept bin Laden under house arrest at Abbottabad since 2006, and that Pakistani Army chief Pervez Kayani and ISI director Ahmad Shuja Pasha aided the U.S. mission to kill, not capture bin Laden. According to Hersh, Pakistani officials were always aware of bin Laden's location and were guarding the compound with their own soldiers. Pakistan decided to give up bin Laden's location to the U.S. because American aid was declining. Pakistani officials were aware of the raid, and assisted the U.S. in carrying it out. According to Hersh, bin Laden was basically an invalid.Hersh, Seymour M., \\"The Killing of Osama bin Laden\\", London Review of Books, May 21, 2015 Hersh's U.S. and Pakistani intelligence sources stated that the U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through a Pakistani walk-in seeking the $25 million reward, and not through tracking a courier. NBC News and Agence France-Presse subsequently reported that their sources indicated a walk-in was an extremely valuable asset, though the sources disputed that the walk-in knew the location of bin Laden. Pakistan-based journalist Amir Mir in the News International reported the walk-in's identity to be Usman Khalid, though that allegation was denied by Khalid's family. The White House denied Hersh's report. Although similar in claims, both Hillhouse's and Hersh's accounts of the bin Laden death appeared to be based on different sources which The Intercept concluded might corroborate the claims if their identities were known. After the Hersh story broke, NBC News also independently reported that a Pakistani intelligence officer was the source of the original bin Laden location report, and not the courier. = Conspiracy theories = The reports of bin Laden's death on May 2, 2011, are not universally accepted despite unreleased DNA testing confirming his identity, bin Laden's twelve-year-old daughter witnessing his death, and a May 6, 2011, al-Qaeda statement confirming his death. The swift burial of bin Laden's body at sea, the speed of the DNA results, and the decision not to release pictures of the dead body have led to the rise of conspiracy theories that bin Laden had not died in the raid. Some blogs suggested that the U.S. government feigned the raid, and some forums hosted debates over the alleged hoax.  Role of Pakistan  Pakistan came under intense international scrutiny after the raid. The Pakistani government denied that it had sheltered bin Laden, and said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009. Carlotta Gall, in her 2014 book The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014, accuses the ISI, Pakistan's clandestine intelligence service, of hiding and protecting Osama bin Laden and his family after the September 11, 2001 attacks. She claims that she learned from a Pakistani official (with whom she later clarified that she did not speak, the information coming through a friend) that a senior U.S. official had told him that the United States had direct evidence that Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad, but ISI, Pasha and officials in Washington all deny this. After the raid, there was an unconfirmed report that Pakistan allowed Chinese military officials to examine the wreckage of the crashed helicopter. = Connections with Abbottabad = View of Abbottabad, Pakistan (2011) Abbottabad attracted refugees from fighting in the tribal areas and Swat Valley, as well as Afghanistan. \\"People don't really care now to ask who's there\\", said Gohar Ayub Khan, a former foreign minister and resident of the city. \\"That's one of the reasons why, possibly, he came in there.\\" The city was home to at least one al-Qaeda leader before bin Laden. Operational chief Abu Faraj al-Libi reportedly moved his family to Abbottabad in mid-2003. Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) raided the house in December 2003 but did not find him. This account was contradicted by American officials who said that satellite photos show that in 2004 the site was an empty field. A courier told interrogators that al-Libi used three houses in Abbottabad. Pakistani officials say they informed their American counterparts at the time that the city could be a hiding place for al-Qaeda leaders. In 2009 officials began providing the U.S. with intelligence about bin Laden's compound without knowing who lived there. On January 25, 2011, ISI arrested Umar Patek, an Indonesian wanted in connection with the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings, while he was staying with a family in Abbottabad. Tahir Shehzad, a clerk at the post office, was arrested on suspicion of facilitating travel for al-Qaeda militants. = Allegations against Pakistan = Numerous allegations were made that the government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden. Critics cited the proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S. chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. U.S. government files, leaked by WikiLeaks, disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the government of Tajikistan had also told U.S. officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts. CIA chief Leon Panetta said the CIA had ruled out involving Pakistan in the operation, because it feared that \\"any effort to work with the Pakistanis could jeopardize the mission. They might alert the targets.\\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that \\"cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound in which he was hiding\\". Obama echoed her sentiments. John O. Brennan, Obama's chief counterterrorism advisor, said that it was inconceivable that bin Laden did not have support from within Pakistan. He said: \\"People have been referring to this as hiding in plain sight. We are looking at how he was able to hide out there for so long.\\" The Indian Minister for Home Affairs, P. Chidambaram, said that bin Laden hiding \\"deep inside\\" Pakistan was a matter of grave concern for India, and showed that \\"many of the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks, including the controllers and the handlers of the terrorists who actually carried out the attack, continue to be sheltered in Pakistan\\". He called on Pakistan to arrest them. Pakistani-born British member of parliament Khalid Mahmood said he was \\"flabbergasted and shocked\\" after he learned that bin Laden was living in a city with thousands of Pakistani troops, reviving questions about alleged links between al-Qaeda and elements in Pakistan's security forces. On August 7, 2011, Raelynn Hillhouse, an American spy novelist and security analyst, posted \\"The Spy Who Billed Me\\" on her national security blog, suggesting that Pakistan's ISI had sheltered bin Laden in return for a $25 million bounty; ISI and government officials have denied her allegations. Former Pakistani Army Chief, General Ziauddin Butt has said that, according to his knowledge, Osama bin Laden was kept in an Intelligence Bureau safe house in Abbottabad by the then Director-General of the Intelligence Bureau of Pakistan (2004‚Äì2008), Brigadier Ijaz Shah. This had occurred with the \\"full knowledge\\" of former army chief General Pervez Musharraf and possibly that of current Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.Jamal, Arif (December 22, 2011), Former Pakistan Army Chief Reveals Intelligence Bureau Harbored Bin Laden in Abbottabad, Jamestown.org Emails from the private American security firm, Stratfor, published by WikiLeaks on February 27, 2012, indicate that up to 12 officials in Pakistan's ISI knew of Osama bin Laden's Abbottabad safe house. Stratfor had been given access to the papers collected by American forces from bin Laden's Abbottabad house. The emails reveal that these Pakistani officers included \\"Mid to senior level ISI and Pak Mil with one retired Pak Mil General\\".McElroy, Damien (February 27, 2012) \\"Stratfor: Osama bin Laden 'was in routine contact with Pakistan's spy agency'\\", The Daily Telegraph In 2014, British journalist Carlotta Gall revealed that she had been told by an undisclosed ISI source that the ISI \\"ran a special desk assigned to handle bin Laden\\". The desk was \\"led by an officer who made his own decisions and did not report to a superior [...] but the top military bosses knew about it, I was told\\". = Pakistani response = According to a Pakistani intelligence official, raw phone-tap data had been transferred to the U.S. without being analyzed by Pakistan. While the U.S. \\"was concentrating on this\\" information since September 2010, information regarding bin Laden and the compound's inhabitants had \\"slipped from\\" Pakistan's \\"radar\\" over the months. Bin Laden left \\"an invisible footprint\\" and he had not been contacting other militant networks. It was noted that much focus had been placed on a courier entering and leaving the compound. The transfer of intelligence to the U.S. was a regular occurrence according to the official, who also stated regarding the raid that \\"I think they came in undetected and went out the same day\\", and Pakistan did not believe that U.S. personnel were present in the area before the special operation occurred. According to the Pakistani high commissioner to the United Kingdom, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, Pakistan had prior knowledge that an operation would happen. Pakistan was \\"in the know of certain things\\" and \\"what happened, happened with our consent. Americans got to know him‚Äîwhere he was first‚Äîand that's why they struck it and struck it precisely.\\" Husain Haqqani, Pakistani ambassador to the U.S., had said that Pakistan would have pursued bin Laden had the intelligence of his location existed with them and Pakistan was \\"very glad that our American partners did. They had superior intelligence, superior technology, and we are grateful to them.\\" Another Pakistani official stated that Pakistan \\"assisted only in terms of authorization of the helicopter flights in our airspace\\" and the operation was conducted by the United States. He also said that \\"in any event, we did not want anything to do with such an operation in case something went wrong.\\" In June the ISI arrested the owner of a safe house rented to the CIA to observe Osama bin Laden's compound and five CIA informants. Mark Kelton, then the CIA station chief for Pakistan, alleges that he was poisoned by the ISI in retaliation for the raid, forcing him to leave the country.  Code name  Several officials who were present in the Situation Room, including the president, told reporters that the code name for bin Laden was \\"Geronimo\\". They had watched Leon Panetta, speaking from CIA headquarters, while he narrated the action in Abbottabad. Panetta said, \\"We have a visual on Geronimo\\", and later, \\"Geronimo EKIA\\"‚Äîenemy killed in action. The words of the commander on the ground were, \\"For God and country, Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo.\\" Officials subsequently explained that each step of the mission was labelled alphabetically in an \\"Execution Checklist\\", which is used to ensure all participants in a large operation are kept synchronized with a minimum of radio traffic. \\"Geronimo\\" indicated the raiders had reached step \\"G\\", the capture or killing of bin Laden. Osama bin Laden was identified as \\"Jackpot\\", the general code name for the target of an operation. ABC News reported that otherwise his regular code name was \\"Cakebread\\". The New Yorker reported that bin Laden's code name was \\"Crankshaft\\". Many Native Americans were offended that Geronimo, the renowned 19th-century Apache leader, was irrevocably linked with bin Laden. The chairman of the Fort Sill Apache Tribe, the successor to Geronimo's tribe, wrote a letter to Obama asking him to \\"right this wrong.\\" The president of the Navajo Nation requested that the U.S. government change the code name retroactively. Officials from the National Congress of American Indians said the focus should be on honoring the disproportionately high number of Native Americans who serve in the military, and they had been assured that \\"Geronimo\\" was not a code name for bin Laden. The U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs heard testimony on the issue from tribal leaders, while the Defense Department had no comment except to say that no disrespect was intended.  Derivation of intelligence  After the death of bin Laden, some officials from the Bush administration, such as former Bush Office of Legal Counsel attorney John Yoo and former attorney general Michael Mukasey, wrote op-eds stating that the enhanced interrogation techniques they authorized (since legally clarified as torture) yielded the intelligence that later led to locating bin Laden's hideout. Mukasey said that the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed caused him to reveal the nickname of bin Laden's courier. U.S. officialsAlexander, Matthew, \\"Tortured Logic: The United States Didn't Need to Waterboard Anyone to Get Osama Bin Laden\\", Foreign Policy, May 8, 2011. and legislators, including Republican John McCain and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, countered that those statements were false. They noted that a report by CIA Director Leon Panetta stated that the first mention of the courier's nickname did not come from Mohammed, but rather from another government's interrogation of a suspect whom they said they \\"believe was not tortured.\\" McCain called on Mukasey to retract his statements: Panetta had written a letter to McCain on the issue, saying: \\"Some of the detainees who provided useful information about the facilitator/courier's role had been subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques. Whether those techniques were the 'only timely and effective way' to obtain such information is a matter of debate and cannot be established definitively.\\" Although some information may have been obtained from detainees who were subjected to torture, Panetta wrote to McCain that: > We first learned about the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a > detainee not in CIA custody in 2002. It is also important to note that some > detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted > to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator/courier. > These attempts to falsify the facilitator/courier's role were alerting. In > the end, no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full > true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through > other intelligence means. In addition, other U.S. officials state that shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, detainees in CIA secret prisons told interrogators about the courier's pseudonym \\"al-Kuwaiti\\" and that when Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was later captured, he only confirmed the courier's pseudonym. After Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured, he provided false or misleading information: he denied that he knew al-Kuwaiti and he made up another name instead. Also, a group of interrogators asserted that the courier's nickname was not divulged \\"during torture, but rather several months later, when [detainees] were questioned by interrogators who did not use abusive techniques.\\"Mulrine, Anna, \\"Military interrogators: Waterboarding didn't yield tips that led to bin Laden\\", Christian Science Monitor, May 5, 2011  Intelligence postmortem  Evidence seized from the compound is said to include ten cell phones, five to ten computers, twelve hard drives, at least 100 computer disks (including thumb drives and DVDs), handwritten notes, documents, weapons, and an assortment of personal items. It was described by a senior Pentagon intelligence official as \\"the single largest collection of senior terrorist materials ever.\\" On November 1, 2017 the CIA released to the public approximately 470,000 files and a copy of bin Laden's diary. Intelligence analysts also studied call detail records from two phone numbers that were found to be sewn into bin Laden's clothing. They helped over the course of several months to apprehend several al-Qaeda members in several countries and to kill several of bin Laden's closest associates by CIA drone attacks in Pakistan. The material gathered at the compound was stored at the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, where forensic experts analyzed fingerprints, DNA, and other trace evidence left on the material. Copies of the material were provided to other agencies; officials want to preserve a chain of custody in case any of the information is needed as evidence in a future trial. A special CIA team has been given the responsibility of combing through the digital material and documents removed from the bin Laden compound. The CIA team is working in collaboration with other U.S. government agencies \\"to triage, catalog and analyze this intelligence.\\" Bin Laden's youngest wife told Pakistani investigators that the family lived in the feudal village of Chak Shah Muhammad, in the nearby district of Haripur, for two and a half years before moving to Abbottabad in late 2005. The material seized from the compound contained al-Qaeda's strategy for Afghanistan after America's withdrawal from the country in 2014, as well as thousands of electronic memos and missives that captured conversations between bin Laden and his deputies around the world. It showed that bin Laden stayed in touch with al-Qaeda's established affiliates and sought new alliances with groups such as Boko Haram from Nigeria. According to the material, he sought to reassert control over factions of loosely affiliated jihadists from Yemen to Somalia, as well as independent actors whom he believed had sullied al-Qaeda's reputation and muddied its central message. Bin Laden was worried at times about his personal security and was annoyed that his organization had not utilized the Arab Spring to improve its image. He acted, according to The Washington Post, on the one hand as \\"chief executive fully engaged in the group's myriad crises, grappling with financial problems, recruitment, rebellious field managers, and sudden staff vacancies resulting from the unrelenting U.S. drone campaign\\", and on the other hand as \\"a hands-on manager who participated in the terrorist group's operational planning and strategic thinking while also giving orders and advice to field operatives scattered worldwide.\\" The material also described Osama bin Laden's relation with Ayman al-Zawahiri and Atiyah Abd al-Rahman. Seventeen documents seized during the Abbottabad raid, consisting of electronic letters or draft letters dating from September 2006 to April 2011, were released by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point one year and one day after bin Laden's death. and made available at The Washington Post homepage. The documents covered subjects such as the news media in America, affiliate organization, targets, America, security, and the Arab Spring. In the documents, bin Laden said al-Qaeda's strength was limited and therefore suggested that the best way to attack the U.S., which he compared to a tree, \\"is to concentrate on sawing the trunk\\". He refused the promotion of Anwar al-Awlaki when this was requested by Nasir al-Wuhayshi, leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. \\"We here become reassured of the people when they go to the line and get examined there\\", bin Laden said. He told al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to expand operations in the U.S. in the wake of the 2009 Christmas Day bomb plot by writing \\"We need to extend and develop our operations in America and not keep it limited to blowing up airplanes.\\" The seized material shed light on al-Qaeda's relationship with Iran, which detained jihadis and their relatives in the wake of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, including members of bin Laden's family. Al-Qaeda's relationship with Iran was, according to the Combating Terrorism Center, an \\"unpleasant byproduct of necessity, fueled by mutual distrust and antagonism.\\" An explicit reference to any institutional support from Pakistan for al-Qaeda wasn't mentioned in the documents; instead, bin Laden instructed his family members how to avoid detection so that members of Pakistani intelligence couldn't track them to find him. According to the seized material, former commander of the international forces in Afghanistan David Petraeus and US President Barack Obama should be assassinated during any of their visits to Pakistan and Afghanistan, if there was an opportunity to do so. Bin Laden opined that U.S. Vice President Joe Biden should not be a target because \\"Biden is totally unprepared for that post [of president], which will lead the US into a crisis.\\" Bin Laden was also against one-person suicide attacks and was of the opinion that at least two persons should undertake these attacks instead. He planned to reform in a way so that al-Qaeda's central leadership would have a greater say in the naming of the al-Qaeda branch leaders and their deputies. He expressed his opinion that killing Muslims has weakened his organization and not helped al-Qaeda, writing that it \\"cost the mujahedeen no small amount of sympathy among Muslims. The enemy has exploited the mistakes of the mujahedeen to mar their image among the masses.\\" The United States Department of Justice released a further eleven documents in March 2015. The documents were part of the trial against Abid Naseer, who was convicted of plotting to bomb a Manchester shopping mall in 2009. They included letters to and from Osama bin Laden in the year before his death, and showed the extent of the damage the CIA drone program had done to Al-Qaeda. In addition to information and data recovered that were of intelligence interest, the documents and computer items also contained personal files, including family correspondence and a large stash of pornography. US officials have refused to characterize the type of pornography found other than to say that it was \\"modern\\" in nature.Wellman, Alex, \\"Osama Bin Laden porn stash: Extensive collection found in al-Qaeda leader's hideout\\", Daily Mirror, May 21, 2015Holley, Peter, \\"A 'bro' asked the CIA about Osama bin Laden's porn stash. The agency answered.\\", The Washington Post, June 10, 2015Ackerman, Spencer, \\"Osama bin Laden's pornography stash to remain under wraps, US decides\\", The Guardian, May 20, 2015  Helicopter stealth technology revelations  The tail section of the secret helicopter survived demolition and lay just outside the compound wall. Pakistani security forces put up a cloth barrier at first light to hide the wreckage. Later, a tractor hauled it away hidden under a tarp. Journalists obtained photographs that revealed the previously undisclosed stealth technology. Aviation Week said the helicopter appeared to be a significantly modified MH-60 Black Hawk. Serial numbers found at the scene were consistent with an MH-60 built in 2009. Its performance during the operation confirmed that a stealth helicopter could evade detection in a militarily sensitive, densely populated area. Photos showed that the Black Hawk's tail had stealth-configured shapes on the boom and the fairings, swept stabilizers and a \\"hubcap\\" over the noise-reducing five- or six-blade tail rotor. It appeared to have a silver-loaded infrared suppression finish similar to some V-22 Ospreys. The crash of the Blackhawk may have been, at least in part, caused by the aerodynamic deficiencies introduced to the airframe by the stealth technology add-ons.Rogoway, Tyler, \\"Origins of Stealth Black Hawks Date Back Over Three Decades Before the Bin Laden Raid\\", The Drive, 10 January 2019 The U.S. requested return of the wreckage and the Chinese government also expressed interest, according to Pakistani officials. Pakistan had custody of the wreckage for over two weeks before its return was secured by U.S. Senator John Kerry. Experts disagreed as to how much information could have been gleaned from the tail fragment. Stealth technology was already operational on several fixed-wing aircraft and the cancelled RAH-66 Comanche helicopter; the modified Black Hawk was the first confirmed operational \\"stealth helicopter\\". It is likely that the most valuable information obtainable from the wreckage was the composition of the radar-absorbing paint used on the tail section. Local children were seen picking up pieces of the wreckage and selling them as souvenirs. In August 2011, Fox News reported that Pakistan had allowed Chinese scientists to examine the helicopter's tail section and were especially interested in its radar-absorbing paint. Pakistan and the PRC denied these claims.  Previous attempts to capture or kill bin Laden  Air strikes on Tora Bora in 2001 * February 1994: A team of Libyans attacked bin Laden's home in Sudan.

Despite only having a population of just over 40 people, the village has attracted much international attention due to the success of local singer Daniel O'Donnell.http://www.donegalcottageholidays.com/towns/holiday-cottage- kincasslagh.php Name Kincasslagh Peninsula and pier Fans meeting Daniel O'Donnell at his annual 'tea party', at his mother's residence in Kincasslagh The Irish and official name for Kincasslagh is Cionn Caslach or Ceann Caslach, which means head of the small inlet. Due to its status as a Gaeltacht village, all roadsigns to and in the village itself are in the Irish language. St. Mary's Roman Catholic church Language Kincasslagh is in the Gaeltacht region which means the official language of the area is Irish. However, the use of the language has been in decline since the 1950s.http://anghaeltacht.net/ctg/080323foinse.html There are very few Irish- speakers in Kincasslagh today, much like neighbouring villages Mullaghduff and Burtonport. History Kincasslagh has a long history of emigration, much like the rest of West Donegal.https://www.theyworkforyou.com/sp/?id=2011-01-12.32095.0 In the 1950s and 1960s, a large number of locals left the area to work in countries such as the UK (England and especially Scotland), USA and Australia. Education The local primary school is Scoil N√°isi√∫nta B√©al na Cruite with 49 pupils,http://www.schooldays.ie/school/s-n-dhubhthaigh-rollnumber-19343L and the nearest secondary school is Rosses Community School in Dungloe. Local amenities There is only one public house in the village Iggy's, and the one grocery shop, The Cope, is part of a co-operative retail chain indigenous to the area. The Viking House is the nearest hotel to the village, which was once owned by singer Daniel O'Donnell. Kincasslagh is also the nearest village to Cruit Island, which boasts a very popular golf course.http://www.cruitislandgolfclub.com/ Sport The local Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) team is Naomh Mhuire CLG which covers the greater Lower Rosses area. The local soccer team is Keadue Rovers. Arts Kincasslagh is probably best known for being the birthplace of singers Margo and Daniel O'Donnell. The village played host to Daniel's annual tea party which he held at his mother's home as part of the Donegal Shore Festival, which drew thousands of fans each year.http://www.goireland.com/donegal/festivals-and- fairs-in-kincasslagh-page1.htm The village was used as a location for the film American Women / The Closer You Get in 2000imdb. Transport Kincasslagh is situated five kilometres from Donegal International Airport which is serviced daily by Aer Arann from Dublin Airport and also does a flight to Glasgow.

Ships drawing up to have navigated the strait, but it is made very difficult by the ice. Most of the year the strait is covered with rough, heavy ice. Much of this is polar ice which has flowed down the M'Clintock Channel from the Viscount Melville Sound. Large-scale breakup of the ice in the strait begins by late July and continues into late September when it begins to freeze again.Legault, Leonard H; Pharand, Donat (October 1, 1984).

Near the entrance of Victoria Strait was where HMS Terror and HMS Erebus became trapped during John Franklin's expedition and were abandoned in 1848.

It is a single span Warren through truss bridge, spanning the Coginchaug River near the Starr Mill complex on the west bank of the river. Built in 1927 by the Berlin Construction Company, it is one of a shrinking number of period metal truss bridges in the state. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. It is closed to all forms of passage. Description and history The Starr Mill Road Bridge is located in western Middletown, spanning the Coginchaug River just below (east of) the Starr Mill dam. It is accessible via Middlefield Road (Connecticut Route 157) on the south, and Beverly Heights, the mill access road, on the north. The bridge is long with a roadway wide, and stands about above the river on concrete abutments, which were poured over rubble abutments of earlier bridges. The bridge deck and structure are in deteriorating condition. The bridge was built by the city in 1927, as a part of a bridge-building program in the outer portions of the city. The bridge was constructed by the Berlin Construction Company, one of Connecticut's leading bridge makers of the early 20th century. The company was created by principals of the Berlin Iron Bridge Company after that company was merged into the American Bridge Company, and continued to be a major regional supplier of bridge trusses until they were broadly supplanted in road engineering practices by steel girder bridges. The bridge has an unusual combination of riveted and bolted joints, an indication of the difficulty of performing riveting in the field.

It first aired in on October 3, 1966.  Synopsis  After curmudgeonly film producer Harold Hecuba (Phil Silvers) crash lands near the island during an around-the-world talent hunt, the castaways are forced to tolerate him until his rescue plane arrives. When Ginger asks him for a role in his next movie however, Mr. Hecuba laughs at the idea, causing Ginger to become so upset that she refuses to return to civilization with the rest of the castaways. Hoping to change Mr. Hecuba's mind, Gilligan suggests that they perform a play for Mr. Hecuba so that he might reconsider Ginger's talent and ultimately decide to use her in a movie. From the limited resources available on the island, they create a musical version of William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The cast performs three songs for their show. These parody the \\"To be or not to be\\" speech of Act III, Scene 1; the \\"Get thee to a nunnery\\" exchange between Hamlet and Ophelia later in the same scene, and Polonius's \\"Neither a borrower nor a lender be\\" speech from Act I, Scene III. The episode employs dialog taken directly from the original work and musical passages from the operas Carmen and The Tales of Hoffmann (\\"Belle nuit, √¥ nuit d'amour\\"). An example follows. : Neither a borrower nor a lender be. : Do not forget: stay out of debt. : Think twice, and take this good advice from me: : Guard that old solvency! : There's just one other thing you ought to do. : To thine own self be true. Hecuba awakens as the castaways rehearse at night, taking over the production. When help arrives Hecuba departs alone, leaving behind all the others in order to take full credit for the musical version of Hamlet he intends to stage as his next project.  Cast  In order of appearance: * Hamlet: Gilligan * Claudius: Thurston Howell, III * Gertrude: Mrs. Howell * Ophelia: Ginger * Polonius: The Skipper * Laertes: Mary Ann The show's only other regular character, The Professor, serves as the production's technical crew.  Reception  Although the show Gilligan's Island seldom earned awards of any sort, \\"The Producer\\" was selected by TV Guide as one of the 100 greatest television episodes of all time. In Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization, Paul A. Cantor terms the Hamlet production a \\"full-scale Broadway show\\" and notes the episode as \\"evidence of the degree of sophistication the castaways are able to achieve in their supposedly primitive state...\\" Cantor also observes in an introduction to Hamlet that this episode is one of several recent examples that demonstrate the enduring popularity of Shakespeare's play, since audiences continue to recognize references to the centuries-old drama. Cantor places the episode within the framework of a tradition of Hamlet parodies that dates back to the nineteenth century. Yet Michael D. Bristol interprets these parodies, including the Gilligan's Island episode, as reflective of \\"a distinctively modern experience of subjectivity\\" in Shakespeare's version of the character.  Trivia  * Listed as the number 3 greatest sitcom episode of all time according to the book Inside TV Land. * Part of the first song of the episode is featured in the Space Ghost Coast to Coast episode with Bob Denver, Dawn Wells, and Russell Johnson. * Silvers' Gladasya production company helped finance the Gilligan's Island series (and according to several reports, Silvers earned more money from his percentage in that series than from any of his own endeavors). * In 1997 TV Guide ranked the episode number 52 on its '100 Greatest episodes of All Time' list.

In 2003, it overtook the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, in Sarasota, and became the largest museum in Florida. History The Norton Museum of Art was founded in 1941 by Ralph Hubbard Norton (1875‚Äì1953) and his first wife, Elizabeth Calhoun Norton (1881‚Äì1947). Norton, the former head of the Chicago- based Acme Steel Co., moved to West Palm Beach upon retirement and decided to share his sizable collection of paintings and sculpture. The late Art Deco/Neoclassical building designed by Marion Sims Wyeth opened its doors to the public on February 8, 1941. Its mission statement is \\"to preserve for the future the beautiful things of the past.\\" Under the leadership of its director Hope Alswang from 2010 until 2019, the Norton Museum of Art raised $100 million, which it put toward a plan called the ‚ÄúNew Norton.‚Äù That initiative involved adding 35 percent more gallery space to the museum, as well as a new auditorium and dining area.Alex Greenberger (August 9, 2018), Norton Museum of Art Director Hope Alswang to Retire ARTnews. Building In 2001, the Norton Museum of Art underwent a significant expansion when the Gail and Melvin Nessel Wing was built and increased the size of the museum to . Constructed over two years, it was opened to the public in 2003. The expansion created more space to display art in both the new and existing areas, increasing the Norton's gallery space by 75 percent, allowing more opportunities for the museum's permanent collection. The wing includes 14 new galleries, an enclosed courtyard to accommodate a variety of educational and social events, a glass ceiling installation commissioned from Dale Chihuly, a cantilevered spiral staircase, and three-story atrium designed to evoke the museum's art.

He is best known as drummer of the rock band Luna Sea. Although he released one solo album in 1997, since then he has supported other bands and musicians instead. Career While attending high school, Shinya and his friend Sugizo were members of the power metal band Pinoccio. They were then briefly both in Kashmir. When Shinya was asked to join Lunacy on January 16, 1989, he insisted that Sugizo also join. In 1991, the band changed their name to Luna Sea and released their first album. They went on to become very successful, having sold more than 10 million certified units in Japan, and are considered one of the most influential bands in the visual kei movement. Shinya played drums for the track \\"Back Line Best\\" on his fellow Luna Sea bandmate J's 1997 debut solo album, Pyromania. Also in 1997, Shinya started a solo career where he was vocalist and drummer, his first release was the single \\"Rakkasuru Taiyou\\" released on September 26. The single \\"Hy√¥ry√ªsha\\" followed on November 21, however, since the release of his first album No Sticks in December 1997, there hasn't been any material released by his solo career. After Luna Sea disbanded in 2000, Shinya worked as support drummer for musicians such as Miyavi, Nanase Aikawa, Maki Ohguro, Kyosuke Himuro, and numerous others. He also occasionally teaches drums to students at the Osaka School of Music. Around 2005, he started the band Potbelly, with a younger singer named Milky. Although, they only released the single \\"Crash, Crash, Crash\\" on August 22, 2005. In 2006 he collaborated with Fake? (fellow Luna Sea member Inoran's band) for songs on their album Songs From Beelzebub. Also in 2006, he became a support drummer for Dead End front-man Morrie's project, Creature Creature, and teamed up with La'cryma Christi drummer Levin for several exhibitions in celebration of the 60th anniversary of Pearl Drums. On December 24, 2007, Shinya reunited with Luna Sea to play a one-night only concert at the sold-out 55,000 seat Tokyo Dome. The band would reunite once again at the hide memorial summit on May 4, 2008. From 2008 to 2009, Shinya was support drummer for X Japan vocalist Toshi's project, Toshi with T-Earth. On August 31, 2010 he appeared with the other members of Luna Sea at a press conference in Hong Kong, where they officially announced their reunion and their 20th Anniversary World Tour Reboot -to the New Moon-. In response to the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan on March 11, Shinya supported Toshi at eight concerts throughout western Japan. All of the shows were acoustic due to the electricity shortage and also featured X Japan's Heath and the Orchestra Ensemble Kanazawa. All proceeds were donated to the Japanese Red Cross to aid the victims. In 2011 Shinya also joined Yellow Fried Chickenz, a band that also included Gackt and Chachamaru. However they disbanded after their July 4, 2012 concert, after only one year together. Shinya participated in the HIV/AIDS benefit concert Hope and Live ~ HIV/AIDS Support and Treatment Benefit Concert 2013, which was held on August 26‚Äì28 at Club Citta and included many other artists such as Zigzo and his Luna Sea bandmate Ryuichi. He also contributed to the Dead End tribute album Dead End Tribute - Song of Lunatics -. Personal life Shinya grew up in a family with two older brothers, an older sister, and a younger step-brother from his father's second marriage. As a child he was trained in the traditional Japanese taiko drums, although cited Led Zeppelin's John Bonham as his favorite drummer. While known as a rockstar, he prefers to listen to Japanese pop music and enka, such as Ikuzo Yoshi and Sabur≈ç Kitajima. Shinya married former Morning Musume member Aya Ishiguro in May 2000. The couple have three children: daughters (born 2000) and (born 2002), and son (born 2004).

Like the Biblical Book of Apocalypse, the poem is addressed to the \\"Seven Churches\\", but manuscripts differ as to whether they are the \\"Seven Churches in England\\" or \\"Seven Churches in Neustria\\". The Apocalypse of Golias has been ascribed by different scholars to Alan of Lille, Walter of Ch√¢tillon, Hugh Primas and Walter Map, but the evidence is against these attributions. The poem is one of a group of about the same date, all connected with the fictional \\"Bishop Golias\\", but these poems are not all by the same author. The poet narrates a vision, a summer dream, in which Pythagoras offers to act as his guide, and gives him a quick view of the scholars and writers of the classical world from Priscian to Hippocrates. An angel then appears to introduce the main theme, a fierce criticism of pope, bishops, priests, archdeacons and deacons, who are successively likened to different animals. Monks are the worst of all, and their greed, gluttony and lust are described in colourful detail.

Lying in Sanderson Cove along a tributary of Cane Creek approximately seven miles (11 km) south of the Tennessee Valley, the shelter and the high bluffs of the surrounding valley provided a well-protected environment for the Native American occupants. Overview of Stanfield-Worley Bluff Shelter illustrating trench and block excavation According to The Earliest Americans Theme Study for the Eastern United States, Stanfield-Worley Rock Shelter is considered a strong candidate for National Historic Landmark status. History Based on archeological evidence, the Stanfield-Worley Bluff Shelter was occupied from the Paleoindian Period to the Mississippian period. The well-preserved stratigraphic zones provide insights into the evolution of prehistoric societies in northern Alabama over a period of nine millennia. =Dalton zone= Stratigraphic zones exposed during excavation at Stanfield-Worley Bluff Shelter Dalton zone projectile points collected at Stanfield-Worley Bluff Shelter The Dalton zone, shown as Zone D in the photograph of the stratigraphic zones, represents a transitional Paleo-Indian culture of Alabama with specimens dated to approximately 7000 BCE based on radiocarbon dating. The artifacts found in this complex are typical of mobile hunter-gatherers. The Dalton occupation was remarkable in its intensity with over 150 projectile points, in addition to Paleo-Indian uniface tools such as scrapers and knives, found during the 1961 survey season. The projectile points include both Paleo- Indian (lanceolate Dalton points) and Archaic (side-notched Big Sandy points) specimens. Other artifacts indicate manufacture of wood, antler, and bone tools. Paleoindian sites with preserved faunal and floral records, such as Stanfield-Worley Bluff Shelter, are important to understanding cultural development during the period. The faunal remains of the site contain bones of modern animals including deer, squirrel, turkey, and porcupine. The shelter is located below the southern extent of the current range of porcupines. In addition, remains of the extinct passenger pigeon have been found. Although the animals which the Dalton occupants hunted are similar to those hunted by Archaic peoples, there is no evidence in the zone of shellfish collection or seed processing, traits of established Archaic societies. =Middle Archaic through Mississippian periods= Zone B in the photograph of the stratigraphic zones contains specimens from the Morrow Mountain Phase of the Middle Archaic period. The excavation of this intermediate layer yielded three sets of human remains as well as projectile points, bone awls, and other tools. The youngest stratigraphic zone (Zone A, not shown in the photograph) contained specimens from the Archaic through Mississippian periods. Archeology =Archeological surveys= Big Sandy projectile points collected at Stanfield-Worley Bluff Shelter The excavation of the Stanfield-Worley Bluff Shelter commenced in 1960, after gaining approval of the property owner, Robert B. Stanfield. The project was under the guidance of the North Alabama Project, a partnership between the Alabama Archaeological Society, the University of Alabama and the Archaeological Research Association of Alabama. The first two field seasons (1960 and 1961) were reported by David L. DeJarnette and colleagues. The excavation of the third and final season (1963) was smaller in scale with the results never being published. The trench and block technique was utilized in the excavation of the site. In this technique, individual blocks are created by digging trenches in a defined pattern. The exposed sides of the resulting blocks allow excavation to proceed by individual zones or strata. The trenches and blocks are pictured in the photograph on the upper right. The resulting collection includes over 11,000 specimens. =Archeological significance= By 1960, it was clear that north Alabama had possibly the densest concentration of Paleo-Indian sites within the United States, as evidenced by the discovery of the Quad Site near Decatur, Alabama. The importance of the Stanfield-Worley Bluff Shelter, one such Paleo-Indian site, lies in its ability to establish an accurate timeframe for Dalton projectile points. This resulted in references to the site in almost every summary of eastern North American prehistory. With over 150 projectile points recovered in the 1960 season alone, the site provided invaluable information on numerous early cultures in Alabama. The projectile points were divided into \\"fifty-six taxonomic types and six residual categories or provisional types.\\" Much of the information was incorporated into the Handbook of Alabama Archaeology. Both Robert E. Bell and Charles H. Fairbanks lauded the success of the North Alabama project in raising funds to further archaeological research.

The 13th Demi-Brigade of Foreign Legion (), was created in 1940 and was the main unit of the 1st Free French Division, Free French Forces (FFL). From the coast of Norway to Bir Hakeim, to Africa then the Alsace, while passing by Syria and Italy, the 13th Demi-Brigade would be part of most of the major campaigns of the armed forces of France during the Second World War. After having been engaged in Indochina from 1946 to 1954, the 13e DBLE joined the Algerian War, and left in 1962. The 13e DBLE was based until 2011 at Quartier-G√©n√©ral Monclar in Djibouti, in virtue of an accord between France and the Republic of Djibouti in 1977. During 2011, the unit moved to the United Arab Emirates. In 2016, the unit returned to France, based at the same camp where it was first formed (and took its designation on 27 March 1940) ‚Äì Camp du Larzac.  Creation and different designations  This unit of the Legion was created on 1 March 1940 within the cadre of the Franco-British expeditionary corps intended to intervene in Finland. The first designation of this unit was 13th Mountain Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion (13e DBMLE). On 1 July 1940, the 1st battalion, 900 men, were based in England as troops of the Free French Forces, the 14e DBMLE, while the remainder of the demi-brigade, 800 men principally from the 2nd battalion, returned to Morocco and preserved the designation of 13e DBMLE. On 4 November 1940, the demi-brigade of Morocco was dissolved which allowed the troops which remained in England to readopt the designation of 13e DBLE.  History of campaigns, battles and garrisons  = Second World War = The unit was constituted in North Africa from volunteers of other foreign units stationed there. The unit was then commanded by lieutenant-colonel Raoul Magrin-Vernerey and was comprised at the start of two battalions: * The 1er bataillon ‚Äì Chef de bataillon (CBA) Gu√©ninchault ‚Äì Sidi bel-Abb√®s * The 2e bataillon ‚Äì Chef de bataillon (CBA) Boyer Ress√®s ‚Äì Fez Starting 13 May 1940, the unit partook to the Norwegian Campaign at the troop corps of g√©n√©ral B√©thouart making way with Bjerkvik and Narvik. The operation was a success, however, with the invasion of France, the unit was obliged to repatriate to the national territory. Losses in Norway were 8 Officers, and 93 Legionnaires out of which Chef de Bataillon Gu√©ninchault. The unit disembarked in Brittany on 4 June to reinforce the proposed national redoubt(). On 21 June, the survivors of the demi-brigade embarked for Scotland. Those troops which did not hear the Appeal of 18 June () joined other units of the French Scandinavian Expeditionary Corps () in the region of Trentham. Adhering to this appeal, recently promoted captain Pierre K≈ìnig adjoint (assistant) of lieutenant-colonel Raoul Magrin-Vernerey, convinced the latter to head to London, where they met g√©n√©ral De Gaulle. Magrin-Vernerey met with g√©n√©ral Antoine B√©thouart, chief 1st Chasseurs Division of the French Scandinavian Expeditionary Corps (), who allowed him to meet the men at the garrisoned camp on the night of 30 June. Out of the 1619 Legionnaires present on 28 June 1940, a little less than 900 rallied to Free France (), the others joined Morocco under the command of g√©n√©ral B√©thouard. Joining later the camp, where were regrouped the garrisoned Free French Forces, the 13e DBLE participated to the 14 July parade in London. The units of the Free French Forces took temporarily, between 1 July 1940 and 2 November 1940, the designation of 14th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion 14e DBLE, while composed of the following: * Headquarters staff commanded by commandant Alfred Maurice Cazaud () * 3 combat units * 1 support unit The demi-brigade had a strength of 25 Officers, 102 NCOs and 702 other ranks.in K√©pi blanc magazine n¬∞723 ‚Äì July 2010 At the end of September 1940, the unit participated i the Battle of Dakar against Dakar. Following the failure of the landing in Senegal, the unit finished by disembarking, under the command of lieutenant-colonel Cazaud, in Equatorial French Africa () to partake, in November 1940, to the Battle of Gabon () and the rallying of Gabon to Free France (), under the command of g√©n√©ral de Larminat. The unit accordingly assumed its original denomination, and at the corps of the French Orient Brigade, the unit circled Africa and disembarked at Port Soudan on 12 February 1941 to take part in combats in the East African Campaign. The brigade accordingly distinguished itself during the Battle of Keren, on 27 March 1941, then Massaoua on 8 April 1941. In the following month, the unit joined Palestine in order to participate to the Syria‚ÄìLebanon Campaign. The demi-brigade entered into Syria on 8 June and following harsh combats, managed to enter into Damascus on 21 June. On 6 September 1941, lieutenant-colonel prince Amilakvari assumed command of the unit. In December, the 2nd battalion (commandant Ren√© Babonneau ()) and 3rd battalion made way to North Africa where the unit, at the corps of the Koenig Brigade, front faced the forces of the Afrika Korps. Promoted to in September 1941, excellent instructor of men, Ren√© Babonneau assumed command of the 2nd battalion, which at Bir Hakeim, on 27 May 1942, held back more than 70 tanks of the division Ariete, by destroying 35 out of them.on this day of 10 June 1942, Bir Hakiem by g√©n√©ral Koenig His battalion received a citation at the orders of the armed forces. Remaining at the rear to uphold the unfolding, in the night of 10‚Äì11 June 1942, he was made prisoner and transferred to Italy, where he attempted to escape twice. From May to June 1942, a part of the unit was successful at Bir Hakeim. This would be the occasion for Pierre Messmer, captain commanding a company to write later, a book: the lost patrol (). Then the \\"13e\\" took part to the Second Battle of El Alamein, during which the commanding officer of the unit was killed. During the assembly of the 1st Free French Division (1re DFL), beginning of 1943, the DBLE disappeared as far as a troop corps and the three constituting units (1er BLE, 2e BLE and the anti-tank company) were incorporated into the 1st Brigade of the Division. The unit later engaged in combat at the corps of the French Expeditionary Corps then disembarked in Provence within the cadre of Operation Dragoon in mid-August 1944. The demi- brigade took part in the Liberation of France () as part of the 1st Free French Division (1st Army) (), notably during the course of the Battle of the Vosges (). During late 1944, a nominally Ukrainian battalion of the FFI ‚Äì composed of recent defectors from the 30th Waffen SS Grenadier Division ‚Äî was attached to the 13th Demi-Brigade. Two groups from the SS division had defected to the FFI on 27 August. One included 818 Ukrainians based at Vesoul, under the direction of Major Lev (Leon) Hloba, who had shot their German officers and surrendered to the Haute-Sa√¥ne arm of the FFI in the Confracourt Woods. They brought with them 45-mm antitank guns, 82-mm and 50-mm mortars, 21 heavy machine guns, as well as large amounts of small arms and small-caliber ammunition.Sorobey That same day, a similar defection occurred near Camp Valdahon ‚Äì hundreds of men brought with them an antitank gun, eight heavy machine guns, four mortars, and small arms and ammunition.Sorobey The defectors became known as the Bataillon de R√©sistants Ukrainiens. On 6 April 1945, the unit was seen attributed the Ordre de la Lib√©ration. =Indochina War= Destined to be part of the French Expeditionary in Extreme-Orient, the 13eDBLE disembarked of the SS Ormonde on 6 February 1946 at Saigon and garrisoned north of the town, in the triangle of Gia ƒê·ªãnh -Thu Duc ‚Äì Hoc Mon. Operations commenced, with 19 June 1946, the first combat at Mat Cat (Cochinchine). The 13e DBLE was engaged in the frontiers of Siam until Tourane, while passing by the fields of Joncs. The battalions were spread. *The 1st Battalion at Cambodia, pursued the Khmers issarak, which refuged in Siam. *The 2nd Battalion at the center of Annam, defended Tourane, emptied Hu√© and installed a series of posts around Qu·∫£ng Nam. *The 3rd Battalion confronted hard combat at Cochinchine, where local ambushes alternated with action forces. The 13e DBLE participated to operations ¬´ Vega ¬ª, ¬´ Dragon II et III ¬ª, ¬´ Genevi√®ve ¬ª, ¬´ Jonquille ¬ª, ¬´ Canigou ¬ª... with the adversary often leaving combatants behind, such as at Largauze on 26 March 1949. In 1950, the 13e DBLE, assembled in Cochinchine and received in support a 4th battalion. The latter was destined to join the units that had for mission to clean up the fields of Joncs. The rhythm of operations accelerated with the beginning of the dry season: ¬´ Potager ¬ª, ¬´ Normandie ¬ª, ¬´ Ramadan ¬ª, ¬´ Trois Provinces ¬ª, ¬´ Tulipes ¬ª, ¬´ Ulysse 3 ¬ª, ¬´ Neptune ¬ª, ¬´ Revanche ¬ª. Following this operation, the 13e DBLE was again split. Three battalions remained in Cochinchine where they participated to different operations: : ¬´ Araba ¬ª, ¬´ Mandarine ¬ª, ¬´ Pamplemousse ¬ª, ¬´ Ca√Øman ¬ª. On 31 January 1953, the 4th battalion was dissolved and the 3rd battalion transformed into an itinerary battalion: the latter would be found in Tonkin, then at Hu√©, Na Sam, Xoang Xa, at Than Hoa, engaged in a series of hard combats.  Combat engagements  * The 13e DBLE was attacked at C√† Mau by 700 combatants on 13 June 1947. * At Cau Xang, nine legionnaires defended the guard tower, until their death. * On 23 August 1947, the intervention company of the 3rd battalion was surprised with a larger superior number enemy. The legionnaires formed the Infantry square and repelled all the assaults while singing ¬´ Le Boudin ¬ª (). When the rescue column arrived, the post deplored one killed and four wounded; however, the enemy retreated with three full chariots. * On 1 March 1948, a free escorted civilian convoy passed by Saigon to Dalat and fell in an ambush. Lieutenant-colonel de Sairign√©, regimental commander of the 13e DBLE was part of the first killed. The adversaries took 134 civilians to serve them as shields. The pursuit led to the recuperation of a part of the innocent hostages which the enemy was constrained to abandon. H√≤a B√¨nh 1952 The 13e DBLE participated in the Battle of H√≤a B√¨nh from 14 November 1951 to 24 February 1952. H√≤a B√¨nh (the name means \\"peace\\" in Vietnamese) was the capital of the Muong ethnic minority. By road, H√≤a B√¨nh lay a mere 67 kilometers of map distance from Hanoi via Colonial Route 6 (Fr: Route Coloniale 6). The Vi·ªát Minh had controlled H√≤a B√¨nh since October 1950 and used the district as a logistics staging area for operations in north central Vietnam. The French commander in Indochina, General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, ordered the retaking of H√≤a B√¨nh in late 1951. The 2nd Battalion of 13e DBLE fought in a key engagement at X√≥m-Pheo from 8‚Äì9 January 1952. The legionnaires held a vital hill at X√≥m-Pheo astride Colonial Route 6, and they fortified their positions with trenches, bunkers, barbed wire, and minefields. On the night of 8 January, troops from the Vi·ªát Minh 102nd Infantry Regiment infiltrated through the minefields and attacked the 2/13e DBLE positions. The Vi·ªát Minh forces overran the 5th Company position and destroyed bunkers with TNT satchel charges and Bangalore torpedoes. With many of their officers and NCOs killed or wounded, and half of their position overrun, the legionnaires counterattacked with fixed bayonets and hand grenades. The legionnaires later counted 700 Vi·ªát Minh dead around the position at Xon-Phe√≥. Dien Bien Phu 1953‚Äì1954 End of 1953, the 13e DBLE assembled at Tonkin, the 2nd battalion in the Delta, the 1st and 3rd battalion () where at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, where they respectively held ¬´ Claudine ¬ª and ¬´ B√©atrice ¬ª. On the night of 13 March 1954, after five assaults, ¬´ B√©atrice ¬ª was submerged. The 3rd battalion was annihilated with Lieutenant-colonel Jules Gaucher, the regimental commander. The survivors barely represented the numbers of an actual company, and in the rear, efforts were made to reconstitute the battalion, however, time seemed to be missing. on 7 May, all was finished. The camp of Dien Bien Phu was submerged and 1st battalion disappeared to the turn. The Fanions of these units were destroyed at the last minute. Only a couple of fragments of the 2nd company were able to be brought back to Sidi bel-Abb√®s by a couple of legionnaires, whom share it before falling in the hands of the enemy. Lieutenant-colonel Gaucher was killed on the first day of the battle (13 March 1954), when his command post suffered a direct hit from Vi·ªát Minh artillery. Suffering from serious wounds ‚Äì the loss of both arms, severe injuries to both legs, and an open chest wound ‚Äì he died at the hospital. Gaucher was replaced as 13e DBLE commander on 23 March by Lieutenant-colonel Lemeunier who was helicoptered into the fortress. Until the end of the battle, Lemeunier would be the most senior Foreign Legion officer present at Dien Bien Phu.Fall, P139-141. The unit suffered heavy casualties during fighting in March and April. On 14 April the Dien Bien Phu garrison reported that I/13e DBLE was reduced to 354 effectives and III/13e DBLE was reduced to 80 effectives.Fall, P248. On 30 April, the legionnaires at Dien Bien Phu celebrated the anniversary of the Legion's historic Battle of Camerone. The celebration took place at the 13e DBLE command post where Lieutenant-colonel Lemeunier read the traditional Camerone proclamation over a radio hook-up that could be heard throughout Dien Bien Phu.Fall, P347. The 13e DBLE was the only French unit present at Dien Bien Phu that saved one of its battle flags from destruction or capture. The guidon of 4th Company, III/13e DBLE was initially captured by the Vi·ªát Minh during the assault on \\"B√©atrice\\" on 13 March. On 19 May, while the Vi·ªát Minh were celebrating Ho Chi Minh's birthday, Sergeant Beres, a Hungarian legionnaire serving with 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion (1er B.E.P), crawled into a Vi·ªát Minh command post and rescued the flag. The seriously wounded Beres was evacuated by helicopter from Dien Bien Phu on 24 May with the guidon hidden under his clothes.Fall, P431. During its 9-year service in Indochina (1946‚Äì1955), the 13e DBLE suffered 2,721 killed in action (2334 Legionnaires, 307 Warrant Officers, 80 Officers). This included two commanding officers ‚Äì Lieutenant-colonel Brunet de Sairign√© and Lieutenant- colonel Gaucher. D√©fense =Algeria War= Roman ruins at Lambaesis, in 1958 in a ceremonial revue.

In 1955, the 13e DBLE was found back on the African continent. Engaged in the operations of maintaining order (), the regiment disembarked in Tunisia on 28 June 1955. Based in Guelma, the regiment radiated in Constantinois, North and South in the Nemencha. Hiding places were found but no combatants. Accordingly, the phase of \\"pacification\\" commenced. The 13e DBLE constructed or restored posts: Khsirane. The fight followed in the djebels, marked by hard combats: Zaouia, Bou Zakadane, Ouindj, djebel Seike. In July 1957, a combatant group of the ALN was destroyed. Leaving then Nemenchta, the 13e DBLE reduced to two battalions garrisoned at Aur√®s. Steep pitons were succeeded by wooded massifs. At the beginning of 1958, three combats against the ALN, obliged the latter to refuse to get in contact, and accordingly reacted by taking up violence on the civilian population. Nearly 800 families came, in the middle of the winter, and massed around the post of Bou Hamama. Accordingly, On 7 May 1958, the unit responded and combat engaged at Oued Kelaa with firm resolution. In October 1958, the 13e DBLE became an intervention regiment. The regiment was articulated into eight combat companies, including the mounted company, support company, employed at the exception, as companies of Fusiliers‚ÄìVoltigeurs. Two tactical headquarter staff (EMT) mounted several companies on demand. In general, the first three were subordinated to FEMTI, the 4,5,6 to FEMT2, the CP and CA often in support of one or the other EMT. The composition number was 1778 men : 57 Officers, 249 Sous-Officiers and 1472 men. Such was put into effect for the officers due to a dozen of volunteers, out of which three were from the medical service, and lesser than a couple of dozens for the sous-officiers and the legionnaires. They had of a little harka, which was dissolved in June 1961.Les deux derni√®res ann√©es de la ligne Challe , Institut de Strat√©gie Compar√©e The mission of this itinerary unit covered all Algeria, in a series of operations: ¬´ Emeraude ¬ª, ¬´ Dordogne ¬ª, ¬´ Georgevie ¬ª, ¬´ Is√®re ¬ª.

The unit made way back to the ¬´ Bec de Canard ¬ª, on the ¬´ Barrage est ¬ª, where operations, patrols and ambushes succeeded until the end of combats in March 1962. At the independence of Algeria, the regiment left 214 tombs. = 1962‚Äì1977 = A first detachment joined Bougie () to be embarked at the end of April 1962, destination French Somaliland () (Actual Republic of Djibouti). Progressively, the remainder units would follow. The regimental colors arrived on the territory on 15 October of the same year. The companies disembarked one after the other in the new lieu. Having not known peace for the last 22 years since existence, the \\"13e\\" was at last able to justify reputation as \\"b√¢tisseur\\" which other units in the Legion rejoiced of. The unit constructed and ameliorated various existing posts: * The CCAS garrisoned at Gabode; * The 1st company at Dikhil; * The 2nd company at Gabode (works company); * The 3rd company at Ali Sabieh; * The 4th company at Holl-Holl; * The ER (Reconnaissance squadron) at Oueah. During this √©poque, the numbers in the regiment reached almost those of a sizeable battalion. On 1 October 1968, the regiment integrated a reconnaissance squadron. The 1st company ceded the respective lieu of implementation and went on to garrison in Dikhil. The 2nd company left Obock, took the denomination of 2nd works company (2e CT) and joined the headquarter staff and the CCAS at Gabode, Djibouti headquarters. On 25 August 1966, the President of the Republic, g√©n√©ral de Gaulle, visited the territory. The units of the regiment in parade uniform rendered the respective honors of homage. Following the appearance of a banderole reclaiming the territory, manifestations were launched, and the sections of the 2nd company intervened in their parade uniform at 2000 and 2200 respectively. A dozen of ranked and legionnaires were wounded in the confrontation which caused officially thirty- six wounded with forces of the order and nineteen wounded with the manifesting groups. The next day, after the death of two manifesting individuals in the morning, at 1400, the regimental commander received the order to evacuate the place Lagarde where g√©n√©ral de Gaulle was supposed to pronounce his speech. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th companies as well as two section of the CCAS were designated. The place was cleared in twenty five minutes starting at 1620. The confrontations continued at the level of blocked ¬´ Bender ¬ª by forces of the police reinforced by the Legion. In total, there were one killed and forty-six wounded in the forces of the order, three killed and two hundred and thirty eight wounded among the manifesting contingents.Imbert-Vier (Simon), Tracer des fronti√®res √† Djibouti.

Starting 14 September, the ¬´ 13e ¬ª as well as the 5th Inter-arm Oure-Mer Regiment () installed a barrage which encircled the town to filter the exit and entry points.Dubois (Colette) [2002], ¬´Jacques Foccard et la politique fran√ßaise dans le T.F.A.I.¬ª, Cahiers du Centre de recherches historiques, , octobre, , site des Cahiers Composed of rows of barbed wire (¬´¬ª) and miradors stretching over 14 kilometers, this barrier was maintained until the independence and beyond. The number of individuals killed trying to cross it remains undetermined. On 20 March 1967, the following day of a referendum on the autonomy of the territory, independent manifestations were suppressed again by the men of the 3rd company. The end of 1967 and the year of 1968 were again occasions of numerous tensions and operations of maintaining order. In 1976, the regiment and notably the reconnaissance squadron intervened during the Loyada Hostage Rescue Mission (). = 1977‚Äì2011 = Following the independence of the Republic of Djibouti in 1977, the 13e DBLE participated regularly to military or humanitarian missions at the profit of the territories or in the Horn of Africa. In 1979, the 4th company was dissolved. The company's post of Holl- Holl was ceded to the National Army of Djibouti (AND). The regiment then conserved only of the 3rd company, the 2e CT, the CCAS, the squadron and a turning company of the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment 2e REP (company detached for 4 months), based in Arta. The operational engagements succeeded. In May 1991 the regiment assured the control of country's border, which were submerged by a massive influx of refugees coming from Ethiopia, while simultaneously rescue collecting some, welcoming others and disarming an Ethiopian division (Operation Godoria (). In March 1992, it would be the turn of Operation Iskoutir (). In December 1992, its Operation Oryx (), in Somalia, then a couple of month later, Operations of the United Nations in Somalia (), where the legionnaires of the \\"13e\\" served for a first time in their history under the Blue-Helmets () of the United Nations U.N. In June 1994, the third company was rushed to Rwanda within the cadre of Operation Turquoise () and the regiment participated also to Operation Diapason () in Yemen. During the same year, in May, the COMPARA (paratrooper company), stationed in Arta and which was armed by the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment 2e REP was dissolved. ERC 90 armored car of the 13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion in Djibouti. It is convenient to add to all these operations, of the punctual assistance brought forth by the regiment to the young Republic during natural catastrophic disasters which saved the latter regularly. The legionnaires intervened also within the cadres of assuming relief measures, facing flooding disasters, but also facing dryness, to aid humanly populations affected harshly by weather circumstances as well. The 2e CT (works company) was regularly placed on call to execute diverse works, including various numerous constructions on the territory. The commemorative steles of the Legion marked the efforts of a section which worked for collective goals and these commemorations can be seen across all routes of the territory. in addition, this last specialty, the 2eCT would assume the denomination of 2e CAT (support and works company) by adding two support sections, one composed of six-120mm mortar and the other section composed of 8 missile launcher posts. This company was dissolved in 1998 to give place to an turning engineer company armed by the legionnaires of the 1st Foreign Engineer Regiment 1e REG, then the 2nd Foreign Engineer Regiment 2e REG. In 2000, it is the turn of the 3rd infantry company to disappear, also replaced by a turning company, armed however alternatively by units of the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment 2e REI and 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment 2e REP. This last infantry company of the \\"13e\\" had a unique character. In fact, at the instar of the companies of the 2e REP, each section had a specialty. The command section consisted of an 81 mm mortar group. The 1st section perfected the savoire-faire in the domain of sabotage and manipulation of explosives. The 2nd section regrouped the reconnaissance divers which were charged with infiltration missions by maritime means utilizing pneumatic boats or palms. The 3rd section regrouped the elite snipers of the regiment, equipping 12.7 mm Barret and 7.62 mm FRF2. The 4th section, consisted of five V√©hicule de l'Avant Blind√© VABs out of which two were equipped with 20mm cannons. In 2001, the maintenance company of French Forces stationed in Djibouti () was attached to the Demi-Brigade. In 2002, elements of the regiments were projected to the Ivory Coast within the cadre of Operation Unicorn (). After an intervention of a humanitarian character, where a section of the engineers were projected to Indonesia in 2005 (Op√©ration B√©ryx (), to assist and aid the victims of 2014 earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean (), the \\"13e\\" revived operational capacities in March 2007. The tactical headquarter staff, the infantry company and an engineer detachment were sent in urgency, north of the Central African Republic to secure and contain the propagation of violence in the zone of the three frontiers (Tchad, RCA, Soudan) to Birao. In addition, the legionnaires of the unit are, since the beginning of the years 2000, regularly engaged under form of instruction operational detachment () (DIO) assisting neighboring countries (Ethiopia, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and numerous others). = 2011‚Äì2015: United Arab Emirates = On 31 July 2011, the 13e DBLE left Djibouti and garrisoned in the United Arab Emirates at the French military implementation in the United Arab Emirates as a result of a defense cooperation agreement with France.La 13e DBLE quitte Djibouti This move was at the occasion of restructuring, the unit passing from a unit status of combat operational arm to that of a projected support force unit. The unit also bridged operations around the region in 2012 (Operation Tamour () in Jordan) and sent a quick detachment of almost 50 personnel to assist the counter-terrorism units of Iraq.Philippe Chapleau, Fin de partie pour le D√©tachement d'Instruction Op√©rationnelle de la 13e DBLE √† Bagdad , Ouest- France, 4 janvier 2015 = Since 2016: Camp du Larzac = On 30 July 2015, the transfert of the 13e DBLE at Camp du Larzac in Aveyron, was announced in 2016. As of January 2016, with a demi-command company and logistics (CCL), two combat companies, numbers will pass from 69 to 390 then 450 legionnaires, followed in 2017 with the remainder of the CCL and two other combat companies, and in 2018 of a fifth combat company and the company of reconnaissance and support. In 2018, the constitution should reach 1200 legionnaires at the corps of five combat companies, one support company (CCL) and one reconnaissance and support company. Organization  = Djibuti (2001) = * The CCS or command and support company, is mixed, composed of legionnaires in MCD and permanently based. The unit regrouped all projectable services, necessary to command the regiment (transmission, operations bureau, medics, transport section). The unit also armed the CECAP which organized the various tactical desert training courses in desert zones. This unit formed the French Forces stationed in Djibouti (FFDj), as well as the recently commissioned infantry officers of the various institutions and foreign military units; * The CM or maintenance company. This company is mixed in double since it consists of both legionnaires and soldiers of the arms material branch, in MCD or permanently posted. This unit assured the maintenance of all units of the French Army present on the territory; * The ER or squadron reconnaissance (permanent unit). The squadron formed mainly of legionnaires from the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment 1e REC and stationed in isolated posts, at Brunet de Sairign√©, at Oueah, 40 km from Djibouti since 1968. The unit was equipped with light armor type ERC 90 Sagaie. The unit was autonomous at the scale of maintain materials and infrastructure; * The Compagnie d'Infanterie.

NOAA rendering of a brine pool in the Gulf of Mexico. Chimaeridae fish and seep mussels at edge of brine pool. A brine pool (sometimes called an underwater or deepwater lake) is a volume of brine collected in a seafloor depression. These pools are dense bodies of water that have a salinity three to eight times greater than the surrounding ocean. Brine pools are commonly found below polar sea ice and in the deep ocean. Brine pools below sea ice form through a process called brine rejection. For deep-sea brine pools, salt is necessary to increase the salinity gradient. This salt can come from one of two processes: the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics or geothermally heated brine issued from tectonic spreading centers. The brine often contains high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and methane, which provide energy to chemosynthetic animals that live near the pool. These creatures are often extremophiles and symbionts.Extremophile life near brine pools Deep-sea and polar brine pools are toxic to marine animals due to their high salinity and anoxic properties, which can ultimately lead to toxic shock and possibly death. Characteristics Brine pools are sometimes called sea floor \\"lakes\\" because the dense brine does not easily mix with overlying seawater creating a distinct interface between water masses. The pools range in size from less than 1 m2 to as large as the 120 km2 and 200 m deep Orca Basin. The high salinity raises the density of the brine, which creates a surface and shoreline for the pool. Because of the brine's high density and lack of mixing currents in the deep ocean, brine pools often become anoxic and deadly to respiring organisms. Brine pools supporting chemosynthetic activity, however, form life on the shores of the pool where bacteria and their symbionts grow near the highest concentrations of nutrient release.  Formation  Brine pools are created through three primary methods: brine rejection below sea ice, dissolution of salts into bottom water through salt-tectonics, and geothermal heating of brine at tectonic boundaries and hot spots. # Brine Rejection #* When sea water freezes, salts do not fit into the crystalline structure of ice so the salts are expelled. The expelled salts form a cold, dense, brine that sinks below the sea ice to the sea floor. Brine rejection on a oceanic scale is associated with the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AAW) that play a large role in global thermohaline circulation. On a localized scale, that rejected brine collects in seafloor depressions. In the absence of mixing, the brine will become anoxic in a matter of weeks. # Salt Tectonics #* During the middle Jurassic period, the Gulf of Mexico was a shallow sea that dried out, producing a thick layer of salts and seawater derived minerals up to 8 km thick. When the Gulf refilled with water the salt layer was preserved from dissolution by sediments accumulating over the salt. Subsequent sedimentation layers became so heavy that they began to deform and move the more malleable salt layer below. In some places, the salt layer now protrudes at or near the seafloor where it can interact with seawater. Where seawater comes in contact with the salt the deposits dissolve and form brines. The location of these surfacing Jurassic era salt deposits is also associated with methane releases giving deep ocean brine pools their chemical characteristics. # Geothermal Heating #* At earth's oceanic tectonic spreading centers, plates are moving apart allowing new magma to rise and cool creating new sea floor. These mid-ocean ridges allow seawater to seep downward into fractures where they come in contact with and dissolve minerals. In the Red Sea for example, Red Sea Deep Water (RSDW) seeps into the fissures created at the tectonic boundary. The water dissolves salts from deposits created in the Miocene epoch much like the Jurassic period deposits in the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting brine is then superheated in the hydrothermal active zone over the magma chamber. The heated brine rises to the seafloor where it cools and settles in depressions as brine pools. The location of these pools is also associated with methane, hydrogen sulfide, and other chemical releases setting the stage for chemosynthetic activity. Support of life Due to the methods of their formation and lack of mixing, brine pools are anoxic and deadly to most organisms. When an organism enters a brine pool they attempt to \\"breathe\\" the environment and experience cerebral hypoxia due to the lack of oxygen and toxic shock due to the hyper-salinity. When observed by submarines or Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV), brine pools are found to be littered with dead fish, crab, amphipods, and other organisms that ventured too far into the brine. Dead organisms are then preserved in the brine for years without decay due again to the anoxic nature of the pool preventing decay and creating a fish \\"grave yard\\". Despite their inhospitable nature, deep sea brine pools often coincide with cold seep activity allowing for chemosynthetic life to thrive. Methane and hydrogen sulfide released by the seep is processed by bacteria, which have a symbiotic relationship with seep mussels living at the edge of the pool. This ecosystem is dependent on chemical energy, and relative to almost all other life on Earth, has no dependence on energy from the Sun.World Wildlife Fund. \\"Deep sea ecology: hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.\\" March 23, 2006. Accessed October 3, 2007. Like the chemosynthetic communities surrounding hydrothermal vents, brine pool communities offer some of the most compelling evidence yet to suggest extraterrestrial life exists. Chemosynthetic communities offer excellent evidence for extraterrestrial life because they prove that life can exist without light or oxygen: characteristics thought necessary to support life prior to the 1977 discovery of chemosynthetic communities in the deep ocean.

A copy of this photo appeared in the Seattle Post- Intelligencer on July 5, 1908. At the time, Wada was said to stand about 5'2\\" tall, and weigh about 140 pounds. Jujiro Wada (Japanese: Wada Jujiro) (ca. 1872-5 March 1937) was a Japanese adventurer and entrepreneur who achieved fame for his exploits in turn-of-the-20th-century Alaska and Yukon Territory. Early life According to his own account, Wada was born on February 12, 1872,County of San Diego--Standard Certificate of Death #37-023109, filed March 11, 1937. in Ehime Prefecture, Japan, to wealthy parents. Wada said that he arrived in San Francisco in late 1891, and that his purpose of traveling to the United States was to attend Yale University.Cotter, Frank. \\"Ju Wada As I Knew Him,\\" Japanese-American Courier, July 3, 1937, p 2. Researcher Yuji Tani provides an alternative story. According to Tani, Wada was born on January 6, 1875, in Komatsu, Ehime Prefecture. He was the second son of a former samurai fallen on hard times, and his father died when Jujiro was four. Subsequently, Jujiro and his mother went to live with his mother's relatives in what is today Matsuyama City. In 1886, when he was 13 or 14 years of age (by Japanese counting, which would mean 12 or 13 by American), Jujiro went to work at Toda- Seishi Company, which was a local paper factory. In 1890, he went to work for the Yamaya Transport Company in Mitsuhama. Meanwhile, he heard tales about the fabulous wealth of America.Miyahara, Fumiko. \\"The tale of the Yukon's dog- mushing Samurai,\\" Yukon News, March 13, 1996, 14, summarizing the Japanese- language Orora ni kakeru samurai (Samurai Who Ran to the Northern Lights) by Yuji Tani.

Border Crossings: From Canada to U.S., 1895-1956 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2007. Arrival date September 6, 1920, age 46, born about 1874, in Iyo, Japan. However, according to his own account, he stowed away aboard a ship out of Kobe in 1891. Whaling Wada was a cabin boy and cook aboard the Pacific Steam Whaling Company's bark Balaena from March 1892 until October 1894. During this time, the ship was hunting baleen whales in the North Pacific and Arctic Oceans.Dates of service are from John R. Bockstoce, Steam Whaling in the Western Arctic. New Bedford, Massachusetts: Old Dartmouth Historical Society, 1977, p. 114. Wada learned English during this voyage. His teacher was the ship's master, H. Havelock Norwood.DeArmond, Robert N. \\"This is My Country,\\" Alaska Magazine, March 1988, pp. 37-38.A photo of Wada in Dawson City appears on a site dedicated to H. H. Norwood. Wada returned to Alaska in 1895, this time as a shore hunter at Utqiagvik. Shore hunters hunted whales using land-based boats, and also hunted caribou with which to provision visiting whale ships. Wada worked for the Cape Smythe Whaling and Trading Company. The local manager was Charles Brower.Brower, Charles D. Fifty Years Below Zero: A Lifetime of Adventure in the Far North. Fairbanks: University of Alaska Press, 1994. This is probably when and where Wada learned to handle sled dogs and speak Alaska native languages. In 1896, Wada returned to Japan to see his mother. He was in Japan about three months. Following his trip to Japan, Wada returned to Alaska, where he went back to working as a shore whaler at Utqiagvik.Dawson Daily News, October 18, 1909; Dawson Daily News, January 11, 1913; Seattle Times, May 9, 1916. Wada's accounts of his participation appear in Seattle Times, September 18, 1909, and Dawson Daily News, September 22, 1909. In September 1897, an early freeze trapped eight ships of the U.S. whaling fleet in the ice off Point Barrow. Naturalist Edward Avery \\"Ned\\" McIlhenny (of the Tabasco sauce family) and two assistants were then living at the Point Barrow refuge station, and during the next few months, the McIlhenny party and the Barrow shore whalers helped the crews of the stranded whale ships.Bockstoce, John. \\"The Arctic Whaling Disaster of 1897,\\" Arctic Whaling, 1977, pp. 27-42. Prospector and cook Wada was in San Francisco during 1898-1899,Kagan, Norm. \\"Wada the Wanderer.\\" and in August 1914, a young girl from San Francisco calling herself Helen Wada Silveira wrote the postmaster in Fairbanks, claiming to be Wada's daughter. She wrote a message to the Fairbanks Times and when presented to him by an acquaintance, Wada replied back, calling her \\"Himeko.\\"Dawson Daily News, September 5, 1914; Fairbanks Times, August 5, 1914. Her sixteen children and their families live throughout Northern California today. Wada was in Nome during 1901.Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 21, 1912. He apparently spent the winter of 1901-1902 in Seattle, because on May 26, 1902, he arrived in Skagway on a steamer out of Seattle.Yukon Sun, January 17, 1903. From Skagway, Wada caught a different ship to St. Michael, and then took a gasoline launch up the Koyukuk River. In August 1902, Wada took a job as a cook for E.T. Barnette, who had established a trading post on the banks of the Chena River that subsequently became the site of modern Fairbanks.Cole, Terrence. E.T. Barnette: The Strange Man Who Founded Fairbanks. Anchorage, Alaska: Northwest Publishing Co., 1981.Hedrick, Basil & Savage, Susan. \\"Steamboats on the Chena: The Founding & Development of Fairbanks, Alaska.\\" Epicenter Press, Inc., 1988. Fairbanks On December 28, 1902, Wada drove one of Barnette's dog teams into Dawson City to tell the Canadians about the recent gold strikes near Fairbanks.A photo of Barnette's dog team appears on page 217 of E. Tappan Adney, The Klondike Stampede, Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1994. The rig shows five dogs in a row, but a photo of the fan harness that Wada often used appears on pages 219-220. Reporter Casey Moran of the Yukon Sun subsequently wrote a front-page story whose headline screamed \\"Rich Strike Made in the Tanana.\\" The story caused several hundred miners to leave Dawson City for Fairbanks, where most were disappointed to find that prices were high and the best sites were already staked. An angry mob approached Barnette's store, and threatened violence against both Barnette and Wada. Nonetheless, said Wada in September 1907:Dawson Daily News, September 28, 1907. More trials Seal hunting in the Arctic After this experience, Wada left Fairbanks for Nome, where, in July 1903, he was arrested on the charge of failing to report the sale of 40 mink pelts. He paid the fine, and left town.Seattle Times, July 27, 1903. During the winter of 1904-1905, Wada was hunting seals along the Beaufort Sea.Yukon Daily News, September 22, 1909. He was accompanied by several Indians. In August 1906, he was back in Nome. He promptly lost the money he'd made selling pelts in a card game, and he was arrested yet again, this time because some of the money he'd lost belonged to his Indian companions. The two Indians testified against him, but an all-white jury acquitted him anyway.Dawson Daily News, December 10, 1906. Wada was arrested a third time, in Candle, on the same charges, and he spent the rest of the year in and out of court. Marathon runner Needing money to pay his lawyers, Wada began running indoor marathon races. These were gambling events, in which prizes were measured in thousands of dollars. Wada ran well, too, winning a Nome marathon in March 1907.Hunt, William R. North of 53 Degrees: The Wild Days of the Alaska-Yukon Mining Frontier. New York: Macmillan, 1974, 163. Said the Dawson Daily News on May 6, 1908: In August 1907, Wada took his money to Vancouver, British Columbia. The Vancouver Daily Province of August 7, 1907 reported that Wada was a fine storyteller, a favorite being the one about the time he trained two polar bear cubs to pull his sled. After a month in Vancouver, Wada returned to Dawson City. He secured a dog team, and then drove to Rampart, Alaska, to do some prospecting.Dawson Daily News, April 27, 1908. He visited whalers wintering at Herschel Island on March 15, 1908.Dawson Daily News, April 28, 1908. He left the whalers on March 21, and returned to Dawson City via Rampart House, Yukon Territory. It was on this trip that Wada, running short of dog food, reportedly fed the animals his sealskin pants. \\"Fortunately,\\" he said, \\"the spring days were so warm that I did not suffer so keenly as such a sacrifice would have entailed in winter.\\" Then, after filing some mining claims and buying a new worsted suit and brown derby, Wada caught a series of steamers to Nome.Dawson Daily News, April 29, 1908; Seattle Post- Intelligencer, July 5, 1908. Wada left Nome on December 18, 1908, and arrived in Fairbanks on January 11, 1909. This meant his sustained rate by dog team was about 35 miles per day. The reason for this haste was an indoor marathon scheduled for January 15, 1909. Wada finished second.Dawson Daily News, February 2, 1909; Seward Weekly Gateway, January 30, 1909; Yukon World, January 30, 1909. Wada signed up to run in Fairbanks' Independence Day Marathon, which was scheduled for July 1, 1909, but he fell ill and so didn't participate.Dawson Daily News, July 8, 1912Seattle Times, August 19, 1909. After recovering, Wada went south, to run in more long-distance races. On October 7, 1909, he ran a 20-mile race in Vancouver, British Columbia. He lost.Seattle Times, October 8, 1909. He was scheduled to run an officially sanctioned marathon in Seattle on October 17, but did not. The winner, Henri St. Yves, set a world record in that race (2 hours, 32 minutes, 9 and 1/5 seconds).Seattle Times, October 18, 1909. Establishing the Iditarod Trail Street scene in Seward, Alaska, between 1910 and 1914. Wada left Seattle on November 24, 1909. The Seattle Times published later that day recorded his departure. Said the newspaper article: After arriving in Seward, Wada and Alfred Lowell, Dick Butler, and Frank Cotter helped pioneer the Iditarod Trail.Seward Weekly Gateway, December 4, 1909; Seward Weekly Gateway, January 15, 1910; Seward Weekly Gateway, February 5, 1910; Frank Cotter, Japanese- American Courier, July 17, 1937. After finishing this project, Wada returned to Seattle. From Seattle, he went to Louisiana, where he visited Edward McIlhenny, probably to raise money for further expeditions. He returned to Alaska via Seattle in April 1911.Seattle Times, April 11, 1911; Seattle Times, July 12, 1912. In early 1912, Wada was in the Kuskokwim area, looking for traces of a Japanese man known locally as Allen, who had disappeared there. On March 11, 1912, Wada was in Iditarod.Fairbanks Daily Times, March 12, 1912. In July 1912, he and his partner, John Baird, made a gold strike on the Tulasak River.Fairbanks Daily Times, June 15, 1912; Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 21, 1912. Wada took about $12,000 in gold with him when he went to Seattle to report the findings to his backers, who included McIlhenny and the Guggenheim brothers.Seattle Times, October 30, 1912; Letter of Agreement between Jujiro Wada and E.A. McIlhenny dated September 14, 1912, in McIlhenny Company Archives; Mary J. Barry. Seward, Alaska: A History of the Gateway City, Part I: Prehistory to 1914. Anchorage, Alaska: Self-published, 1987. Wada returned to Seward in November 1912. He brought with him two sled loads of mining equipment, another sled load of miscellaneous supplies, and four Japanese companions who would serve as assistant dog drivers.Seattle Times, November 23, 1912; Dawson Daily News, January 11, 1913. The Japanese and their twenty dogs then drove to the Bear Creek strike. Wada remained at the Bear Creek site until February 1913.Fairbanks Daily Times, February 18, 1913. Late life Wada went to Seattle for a short while, then he returned to Alaska in May 1913.Seattle Times, May 2, 1913. That same year, he was described in John Underwood's Alaska, an Empire in the Making, as one of Alaska's best long- distance dog sled drivers.Underwood, John Jasper. Alaska, an Empire in the Making.

During May 1915, Wada was in San Pedro, California, working at Van Camp's tuna packing plant, but left town swiftly after receiving a phone call. As with many stories about Wada, the published accounts are contradictory. In the Seattle Times on May 15, 1916, Wada insisted the phone call was a job offer in Alaska, and he traveled to New York.

There was also a van version from 1967, known as the Ranger. The car was announced in August 1965, though volume production got under way only during the summer of 1966. The 875 used the lower-compression (8:1) four-cylinder 875 cc 34 b.h.p. four-stroke engine used in the Commer Imp Van from the Rootes Group. Crucially for the dynamics of the vehicle, this was rear-mounted, unlike in most other British three-wheelers of the era. It was the same basic layout as used in the Hillman Imp, installed as a complete package along with the Imps' transmission, rear suspension and rear wheels: however, thanks to the fact that the 875 had a fibreglass body along with aluminium doors, and weighed less than , the performance was good -- better than the Imp. The low- compression engine meant it was able to run on \\"2-star\\" low-octane petrol, which was cheaper than varieties used by larger and more highly tuned engines. The car's light weight enabled it to qualify for motorcycle road tax rates, and be driven on a motorcycle licence but in order to keep the weight down the interior trim and fittings were minimal. Racing driver John Surtees drove the car at Brands Hatch in 1965, setting a fastest lap of 1:22 for the 1.24 mile circuit and attaining speeds over . Bond played on the car's sporty reputation, track testing a standard production version around the Silverstone Circuit in 1966, setting a lap time of 1:43.34 and reaching through a timing trap along the Hanger Straight. Following the test, Bond refused to confirm or deny that they would be building a racing version of the car for 1967. Development A van version, the Ranger, was introduced in April 1967. Styling changes, rectangular headlamps, front grille, a larger bonnet opening and revised seats heralded the \\"Mark II\\" announced in April 1968.

Also called the 1957 Palermo Mafia summit, the summit discussed the international illegal heroin trade in the French Connection. The FBI believed it was this meeting that established the Bonanno crime family in the heroin trade.Shawcross & Young, Men Of Honour, p. 44-45 Heroin summit? The protagonist of this \\"heroin summit\\" legend is journalist Claire Sterling: \\"Although there is no firsthand evidence of what went on at the four-day summit itself, what followed over the next thirty years has made the substance clear. Authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are persuaded by now that the American delegation asked the Sicilians to take over the import and distribution of heroin in the United States, and the Sicilians agreed.\\"Sterling, Octopus, p. 85 However, she fails to back this claim with solid evidence. Sterling even has the dates of the alleged meeting wrong. At the time, although the Sicilian Mafia was involved to some extent in the heroin business all through the 1950s and 1960s, it never had anything more than a secondary role in the world drugs system. According to the McClellan Hearings, Sicily was no more than a staging-post in the shipment of French- produced heroin to the USA. Until the 1970s, Sicilian mafiosi were prevented from acquiring any oligopoly on the heroin market because they were not competitive in comparison with other European criminal groups, in particular the French Connection by Corsican groups in Marseille.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 203, quoting: US Senate, Organized Crime and Illicit Traffic in Narcotics, Report of the Committee on Government Operations, Washington DC, 1965 The first mention of the \\"summit\\" in the United States was during the McClellan Hearings on October 10‚Äì16, 1963. Among the American mafiosi present were Joe Bonanno, his underbosses and advisors Carmine Galante, John Bonventre and Frank Garofalo, as well as Lucky Luciano, Santo Sorge, John Di Bella, Vito Vitale and Gaspare Magaddino. While among the Sicilian side there were Salvatore \\"Little Bird\\" Greco and his cousin Salvatore Greco, also known as \\"l'ingegnere\\" or \\"Tot√≤ il lungo\\", Giuseppe Genco Russo, Angelo La Barbera, Gaetano Badalamenti, Calcedonio Di Pisa, Cesare Manzella and Tommaso Buscetta.Servadio, Mafioso, p. 189Sterling, Octopus, p. 83 No first-hand accounts There are no first-hand accounts of the meeting, except for the version of Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta, who denied a summit ever took place at all. According to Buscetta, Bonanno did stay at the Grand Hotel des Palmes and received many guests all the time, but there was no summit as such.Arlacchi, Addio Cosa nostra, p. 60-63 In his memoirs, Joe Bonanno mentions his trip to Palermo, but says nothing about a summit.See Bonanno's autobiography A Man of Honour (1983) According to Buscetta a gathering took place in a private room at the Span√≤ seafood restaurant on the evening of October 12, 1957, where Bonanno was f√™ted as the guest of honour by his old friend Lucky Luciano. Among the other guests were Bonanno‚Äôs underboss Carmine Galante, the brothers Salvatore and Angelo La Barbera, Salvatore \\"Little Bird\\" Greco, Gaetano Badalamenti, Gioacchino Pennino, Cesare Manzella, Rosario Mancino, Filippo and Vincenzo Rimi, and Tommaso Buscetta. According to Buscetta, it was at this dinner that Bonanno suggested to form a Sicilian Mafia Commission to avoid violent disputes, following the example of the American Mafia that had formed their Commission in the 1930s. The Italian police had been following Luciano and in so doing found out about the meetings. They observed the gatherings. However, the report was buried in some filing cabinet in Palermo. A copy was sent to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in Washington. Only eight years later the report was used to indict the participants and some of their associates in Palermo.Police in Sicily Say U. S.

The Court of Palermo dismissed the charges in June 1968 because of lack of evidence.Cosa Nostra Men Cleared In Sicily; 7 From U.S. Are Among 17 Acquitted in Rackets Case, The New York Times, June 26, 1968 What can be said about the events in October 1957 in Palermo is that the gatherings reforged the links between the most Sicilian of the American Five Families, the Bonanno Crime Family, and the most American of the Sicilian Mafia families. It was not a conference between \\"the\\" Sicilian Mafia and \\"the\\" American Cosa Nostra as such.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 295-96 Heroin trafficking between these two groups might have been discussed, but there certainly was not a general agreement on the heroin trade between \\"the\\" Sicilian Mafia and \\"the\\" American Cosa Nostra.

It comprises two islands, Saint Helen's Island and the artificial island Notre Dame Island. The islands were the site of the Expo 67 World's Fair. Notre Dame Island was constructed for the exposition, and Saint Helen's Island artificially extended at its north and south ends. The park was renamed in honour of Jean Drapeau, the late mayor of Montreal and initiator of Expo 67. History Saint Helen's Island was discovered by French explorer Samuel de Champlain in 1611, who named it in honour of his wife, H√©l√®ne de Champlain, n√©e Boull√©. It also bears the name of Helena, mother of Roman emperor Constantine the Great. The island belonged to the family of Le Moyne de Longueuil from 1665 until 1818, when it was sold to the British government. The British built a fort, a magazine and a bunker after the War of 1812. The new Canadian government acquired it in 1870, and it was converted into a park in 1874. The islands of the archipelago were chosen as the site of Man and His World (Expo 67). To prepare for this role, Mayor Jean Drapeau expanded Saint Helen's Island and consolidated it with several neighboring islands (including Round Island) and created Notre Dame Island using the fill excavated during the construction of the Montreal Metro in the early 1960s. 28 million tons of fill were needed for this massive undertaking. When the work was completed, Notre-Dame Island and St. Helen's Island hosted Expo 67, which featured pavilions from over sixty countries. After the closing of Expo in late 1967, the site continued its fair vocation under the name Man and His World until 1984, and finally, most facilities were dismantled and the island was converted into a park. In 1999, the Parc des √éles de Montreal was renamed Parc Jean-Drapeau in honour of former Mayor of Montreal, Jean Drapeau, who had re-shaped the islands, built the Montreal Metro and brought Expo 67 to the city. Attractions Summer is the high season for the park, as the majority of attractions are open to the public. These include: *An amusement park, La Ronde operated by Six Flags under an emphyteutic lease *The Montreal Casino *An environmental museum at the Montreal Biosphere (United States pavilion during Expo 67) *The early Victorian Era fortifications at Fort de l'√éle Sainte-H√©l√®ne, which includes the Stewart Museum *A Formula One race track, the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, which hosts the Canadian Grand Prix *The city's largest outdoor concert venue, regularly hosting the Vans Warped Tour, Osheaga Festival and Heavy MTL, and as of 2014, an EDM festival known as √Æle Soniq *An Olympic rowing basin *An aquatics centre, which hosted the 2005 World Aquatics Championships *A beach, Plage Jean-Dor√© During winter for several weekends, the park throws the winter carnival F√™te des neiges de Montr√©al which is a free event that offers a variety of winter activities. The islands also boast numerous hiking and skiing trails, bike paths, large athletic grounds and diverse other services and conveniences. During the more temperate months, a diverse array of free and pay activities are offered on a weekly basis in addition to the aforementioned attractions. There's also a weekly electronic dance festival located under Alexander Calder's sculpture Man, commissioned for Expo 67. The islands are also notable for the remnants of Expo 67, most of which are still in use, though few are still standing. The American and French pavilions are the best preserved, functioning today as the Biosphere and Casino respectively. The Canadian pavilion contains administrative offices, rental halls, and is the site of the studio of Radio-Classique Montr√©al. The former Tunisian and Jamaican pavilions are also in use, the former for bike rentals while the latter is used principally for receptions. A considerable portion of √éle Notre-Dame was redeveloped into an intricate and elaborate flower garden in the early 1980s, which remains today. The only other significant remnant of the former World's Fair is the Place des Nations at the western end of √éle Sainte-H√©l√®ne, though this is abandoned and officially off-limits. As such, it's become a popular spot for fishing. A snowboarding park was added in winter 2009.

Born in the southeastern French city of Grenoble in 1653, to a wealthy land owning family, Saint-Vallier swiftly became a community figure, known for founding a hospital in St. Valier. His officious and dominating personality, led him to accept the position of bishop in 1685 at the call of Louis XIV and Fran√ßois de Laval, former bishop of Quebec. Often referred to as Abb√© Saint-Vallier, he was a controversial figure as Bishop of Quebec, since he rarely listened to advice.Alfred Rambaud. \\"La Croix de Chevri√®res de Saint-Vallier, Jean-Baptiste De.\\" Dictionary of Canadian Biography. He spent large amounts of money that left the seminary in great debt at the time of death in 1727. He was deeply involved in the Catholic reform tradition and promoted several missions throughout Canada. He was seen as a very strict leader for most of his reign. He refused demands for his resignations both by the King and the religious of New France. He was suspected of Jansenism, and his administration of the diocese led to popular revolts and struggles with various religious groups. Accomplishments during his 42-year reign include: the founding of the H√¥pital- G√©n√©ral de Qu√©bec (1692), the edifice for the bishop (1688), and the installations of religious reformist communities in the Montreal area.August Gosselin. \\"Mgr. de Saint-Vallier et son temps\\". Nos Racines/Our Roots. The development of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec and Roman Catholic faith was his utmost priority and interest; he was particularly sensible on the point of morality, which he believed was failing in his see. He was also greatly involved with the Society of Foreign Missions of Paris.  Biography  Born November 14, 1653 to Jean de La Croix de Chevri√®res de Saint-Vallier and Marie de Sayve, Jean-Baptiste was part of the La Croix family, known to be ranked among the best in Dauphin√© with prestigious posts such as country noblemen, officers, magistrates and ambassadors. Jean-Baptiste's father was a Grenoble magistrate and worked for the diplomatic services and his grandfather was a lawyer and poet, then a judge at the Parliament of Grenoble. The La Croixs owned a large amount of land including the castle of Saint-Vallier in the Rhone, which previously belonged to King Henry II's mistress, Diane de Poitiers. This was where Jean-Baptiste spent most of his childhood. However, little is known about him during that period besides his charitable deeds and his education at the Jesuit College in Grenoble. The La Croix children were much influenced by religion; three out of ten entered religious life. Jean- Baptiste entered the seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Paris and obtained his licentiate in theology in 1672 at 19 years of age. In 1676, he was appointed almoner-in-ordinary to King Louis XIV, a promotion that can be attributed to his family's connections. He was ordained priest in 1681. He personally funded a small hospital in Saint-Vallier in 1683. Jean-Baptiste was known for his austerity, his strong will and his dynamism. He was a close friend of the bishop of Grenoble, Le Camus, and would regularly visit hospitals, prisons and country parishes. At the court of the \\"Sun King\\", he kept his religious attire.  Ideology  Saint-Valier was a supporter of the Counter Reformation. His initial intent in the New World was to engage in the conversion of the indigenous residents. He introduced Jesuits and Recollects in an attempt to evangelize New France. Many of these missions (Illinois, Louisiana, and Mississippi) resulted in conflicts between Bishop Saint- Vallier, the Jesuits and the seminary of Quebec. His various construction projects reflect a desire to restore and renew the authority in the Catholic Church as the main institution of administrative organization.Annie Blouin. Les exigences pastorales de Mgr de Saint-Vallier envers ses pr√™tres, 1685-1727. M√©moire (M.A.)‚ÄîUniversit√© Laval, 1999. In 1697, Saint-Valier built a palace in Quebec for his clergy and as a place of hospitality. During the same year, he also established a nuns monastery in Trois-Rivi√®res Saint- Vallier‚Äôs zeal for religious activities and establishments, stretched from Quebec, Montreal, Acadia and Louisiana. His way of life embodied that of the ideals of the Council of Trent.  Diocese of Quebec  The Diocese of Quebec was vast and its population diverse and widespread. It included the whole of French North America, or what was called New France, divided in seven colonies: Newfoundland, Acadia, √éle Royale, Louisiana, Illinois, Upper Country and Canada,James S. Pritchard, 2004. In search of empire: the French in the Americas, 1670-1730. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. p. 31 inhabited by Indigenous people and the European settlers. During the tenure of Saint-Vallier, immigration from France was mostly over; the European colonists were farmers, fishermen, sailors, merchants and ‚Äòcoureurs des bois‚Äô, overseen by a small elite of aristocratic leaders, but a great demographic explosion occurred between 1685 and 1730, the white population in New France jumping from c. 12,000 inhabitants to c. 41,500.Pritchard, 2004, pp. 423-425 During the same time, the number of Amerindian fell from c. 163,500 to c. 61,500. That loss, mainly in the tribes of Louisiana, was attributed to warfare and diseases brought to the valley of the Mississippi. The number of Aboriginals compared to white settlers is one reason for the presence of so many religious orders in New France. The missions and conversions to Christianity were deemed very important. Priests of the Missions √âtrang√®res of Paris, the Jesuits, the Recollets and the Sulpicians often worked in collaboration with the nuns from different orders like the Congr√©gation de Notre-Dame or the Canonesses of St. Augustine of the Mercy of Jesus at l‚ÄôH√¥tel-Dieu de Qu√©bec. The arrival of Saint-Vallier and his strong views on what should be the duties of the priests created a shock wave in the orders, especially for the Seminary of Quebec, newly founded by his predecessor Bishop Laval.  Beginnings as Bishop  Advancing quickly in the religious and social hierarchies, it was but a matter of time before Saint-Vallier would be elevated to the rank of bishop. In 1685, Mgr de Laval, Bishop of Quebec, gave his resignation to the King and proposed Saint-Vallier to replace him. His entourage first pushed him to refuse the see, since the Diocese of Quebec was relatively new, poor, far from court and at that time \\"perhaps the most wretched and difficult of all the dioceses in mission lands\\". Abbot Saint-Vallier finally decided to accept the position, and left France for a sojourn in his future see with the title of vicar general of Bishop Laval, since the ceremony of his investiture had to be postponed due to the difficult relationship between the Pope Innocent XI and Louis XIV. His first stay in Canada lasted a year and a half. Saint-Vallier surprised the clergy with his passion and energy. His trip started in Quebec, down to the parishes along the St. Lawrence River, Montreal and then to Acadia. During this time, he preached to both the French and the Indians. In 1686, he debated going further into the Great Lakes in order to continue his investigations. However, his strong personality intimidated people. The superiors of the seminary later wrote to Bishop Laval that they believed he wasn't a suitable candidate for the task of governing the Quebec diocese. Laval sided with them and requested that Saint-Vallier leave his post. This of course offended him and he refused this request, backed by the King, who ‚Äòexiled‚Äô Mgr Laval in France and refused to permit his return to Quebec. Disappointed and angry, as he had expected to die at the Quebec church he had co-founded, Laval made many accusations that portrayed Saint-Vallier as a manipulative traitor. Saint-Vallier was consecrated bishop at Saint-Sulpice on January 25, 1688 and allowed his predecessor to go back to Canada. However, this would prove to be detrimental for him as upon his return in the summer of 1688, there was a disagreement between him and the seminary of Quebec. Three priests and the Bishop Laval conspired together in order to undermine Saint- Vallier‚Äôs authority and \\"three quarters of the clergy in Canada [‚Ä¶] [had] already escaped the direct authority of the bishop, who found himself, in addition, obliged to share his jurisdiction over his own secular clergy with his seminary.\\" Autumn of 1688, Bishop Saint-Vallier initiated a turnover of the old system and replaced it with new changes in the organization of the seminary which the latter rejected with backing from the Bishop Laval. \\"Mgr de Saint-Vallier worked on establishing more strict and clear pastoral norms [‚Ä¶] the directives that he fixed throughout his episcopate concentrate mainly on the administration of the sacraments, especially the sacrament of penitence, and on the preaching\\"Annie Blouin.

At that time, the Iroquois started attacking the French again and the impending approach of the English loomed ahead. Attacked on every side and called a tyrant and a jansenist, he decided to seek for arbitration by higher religious authorities, in this case the Archbishop of Paris and the private confessor of the King, who \\"both decided in favour of the bishop on the essential points [‚Ä¶], the seminary of Quebec lost its privileges and came [back] under the usual rule.\\" Nevertheless, by the end of 1694, Saint- Vallier‚Äôs relation with his diocese had deteriorated to the point that Louis XIV was forced to recall him to Paris. While Saint-Vallier defended his actions, he was asked to resign, which he refused to do. After being kept in France until 1697, without consenting to resign, Saint-Vallier was allowed to return to Canada after agreeing to be more \\"prudent\\"Lucien Campeau. \\"Bouvart, Martin\\" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 2, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003. and moderate in his ways. He returned to his see and authorized a new establishment of Ursulines at Trois-Rivi√®res.  Quarrels With Different Institutions  Saint-Vallier's tenure as bishop was defined by interminable quarrels with governmental and religious institutions in French North America. Even before he was officially consecrated as bishop, Saint-Vallier's active leadership style brought him into conflict with various groups, who perceived him as, at times, domineering and micromanaging. He quarreled with Governor Frontenac over their respective social standing, going so far as to threaten to place an interdict on the Recollet order for giving the Governor precedence.Jacques Valois. \\"Denys, Joseph\\" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 2, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003. He also clashed with the female religious order of the Congr√©gation de Notre- Dame. The order was active in teaching and nursing, and the Bishop sought to impose upon them a stricter cloistered lifestyle.Foley, Mary Anne, \\"\\"We Want No Prison Among Us\\": The Struggle for Ecclesiastical Recognition in Seventeenth-Century New France,\\" Beyond the Walls: Women Religious in American Life 14 (Winter 1996) In addition, he demanded they assent to dowry payments, solemn vows, and that they swear obedience to him as bishop. While the Congregation resisted, they were eventually forced to accept many of Saint- Vallier‚Äôs dictates.M. Eileen Scott. \\"Barbier, Marie, de l‚ÄôAssomption\\" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 2, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003. Upon his return from France, Saint-Vallier quickly became entangled in more intra-religious disputes. Further conflict arose in regard to competing claims to evangelization rights. In 1698, the seminary of Quebec requested permission to send a mission to the Tamaroa tribe. Saint-Vallier, who, after the \\"great quarrel\\" with the seminary, was eager to remain on good terms, consented. This was a slap in the face to the Jesuits, who felt their evangelizing efforts were under pressure worldwide from the secular church. Claiming the Tamaroas were included in the Illinois tribe, whose conversion had been entrusted to them, they objected. When the dispute was put to his arbitration, Saint-Vallier decided in favour of the Seminary. When the Jesuits appealed to the King Louis XIV in 1700, the Bishop returned to France to defend his decision. Although it was upheld, the damage done to his relation with the Jesuits was lasting. While subject to much criticism, Saint-Vallier was also admired in his diocese for his dedication and self-sacrifice. Rather than staying in Quebec or Montreal, he tirelessly traveled the back-country. The founding of the H√¥pital G√©n√©ral and installation of Jesuits and Recollets at Montreal were also to his credit.  Saint-Vallier and Jansenism  There was a very strong suspicion in the colonies and in France that the Bishop of Quebec was in fact a follower of Jansenism. Named for Cornelius Jansen, a Dutch Catholic Bishop, Jansenism was characterized by a very strict and austere Christianity, a rigorism in the practice of religion and a certain individualism. The Critic Dictionary of Theology explain the large meaning of Jansenism thus: \\"designated an intern movement of Catholicism that refutes the necessity of certain condemnations and limits their range, and tries to present Christianity in its original form and closer to its objectives\\"Jacques M. Gr√®s-Gayer. ¬´ Jans√©nisme ¬ª, dans Jean-Yves Lacoste (dir.), Dictionnaire critique de th√©ologie, Paris, Presses universitaires de France, 2002, p. 708-710. Traduction libre du Fran√ßais √† l‚ÄôAnglais. Opposed to the centralization of power and the absolutism, this religious movement was seen as a plague by the court of King Louis XIV and in New France, where the government system was strongly based on absolutism.J. S. Pritchard. \\"In search of empire: the French in the Americas, 1670-1730\\". pp. 231-234 If Saint- Vallier presented Jansenist ideas, it was in certain aspects of his writing and in his austerity and deep orthodoxy, but he was certainly not a Jansenist. In the beginning of the 18th century the Bishop wrote 3 books; the Ritual, the Catechism and the ‚ÄòStatuts et ordonnances‚Äô. Because of his quarrels with the Jesuits, the Superior of the order decided to attack Saint-Vallier‚Äôs authority by writing a long critic of those three books seeing them as a \\"lapse into Arianism, Pelagianism, Jansenism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism\\". Father Bouvart based his accusations on different passages of the works of the Bishop, for example this extract from the Catechism.Claude La Charit√©. ¬´Les deux √©ditions du Rituel du dioc√®se de Qu√©bec de Mgr de Saint-Vallier, dat√©es de 1703 : de l‚Äô√©dition jans√©niste √† l‚Äô√©dition revue et corrig√©e par la Compagnie de J√©sus¬ª, Revue de Biblioth√®que et Archives nationales du Qu√©bec, No. 3 : p. 78 \\"Le nombre des r√©prouvez sera-t-il bien plus grand que celui des bienheureux ? Oui, le chemin de la perdition est large, au lieu que le chemin qui conduit √† la vie √©ternelle est √©troit.\\"Jean-Baptiste de La Croix de Chevri√®res de Saint- Vallier. Cat√©chisme du dioc√®se de Qu√©bec par Monseigneur l‚Äôillustrissime & reverendissime Jean de La Croix de Saint Valier, √©v√™que de Qu√©bec. Paris, Urbain Coustelier, 1702. (Will the number of the damned be much greater than the number of the blessed? Answer: Yes, the road to perdition is broad, whereas the road that leads to the everlasting life is narrow.) Bishop Saint- Vallier eventually appealed to the Sorbonne to have his works rehabilitated. The doctors of the Faculty of Theology declared the Ritual and the Catechism perfectly orthodox and censured the critic of Bouvart. Nevertheless, Saint- Vallier decided to re-edit in 1713 the Ritual so as to cast away all doubts about his pretended Jansenist ideas. This book remained in use in the parishes until the middle of the 19th century.Claude La Charit√©. p. 78  Capture and Detention  On his return to New France, Msgr de Saint-Vallier‚Äôs vessel, along with other ships from the convoy sailing to the New France, was attacked by English naval forces and sent to England. There he was made a diplomatic prisoner and placed under house arrest, as France was at war with England in the War of Succession of Spain. With Saint-Vallier unable to rule from custody, the religious dimension of the diocese of Quebec fell into decay. The problem in the eyes of the Bishop and many of the priests was the lack of morality in the colony. They encountered much reluctance from the population, especially with the Natives, who were in disagreement with the clergy's fight against alcoholism, ‚Äòindecency and immorality‚Äô and their attempt to instill Christian practices into the tribes while ridding them of their own set of customs. The dispute over the sale of alcohol also created waves in the colonial population since the government and especially the merchants sought to use spirits as a way to maintain good relations with the Amerindian tribes. The Bishop remained a prisoner in London for five years while Queen Anne ruled. During this time, the King of France and the war council were deliberately slowed negotiations for his release. Many people were happy to be rid of Saint-Vallier and his incessant disputes, while the Queen of England demanded in exchange for the Bishop of Quebec the return of the Baron de M√©an, \\"a dangerous man for France‚Äôs interests\\". It wasn't until 1709 that the king decided to set the dean of Li√®ge free and in turn the English returned Saint- Vallier. At that time, Saint-Vallier's diocese had deteriorated greatly especially after Bishop Laval's death in 1708. Despite his pleas, the king was reluctant to let him go back to New France, fearing new religious conflicts. Thus Saint-Vallier underwent a 'forced exile' for four years (1709-1713) before he could return.  Late Life, Death & Epilogue  After thirteen years of absence, Saint-Vallier finally returned to Quebec, having persuaded the king to give consent to his departure. He arrived in his Diocese tired and worn by the torments of the last 20 years of constant infighting. The disputes with the religious orders of New France, the government and the merchants gave way to a more peaceful period that lasted until his death, although he retained some of his old habits. He refused, for example, to ring the bell of the cathedral for the death of the governor Rigaud de Vaudreuil and \\"grudges subsisted between [him] and his seminary\\". Austere throughout his life, he became more and more humble in his way of living and turned toward contemplation and simple duties. As Timothy Pearson explained in Becoming holy in early Canada: \\"Charity, both the love one bore for God and the public acts of altruistic gift-giving [‚Ä¶] became the prominent trope of holiness after 1650\\".Timothy G. Pearson. Becoming holy in early Canada. McGill-Queen‚Äôs University Press, 2014. p.110 Saint-Vallier, following the example of the ‚ÄòSaints‚Äô, showed his generosity by helping the poor and the H√¥pital G√©n√©ral of Quebec. He also took very seriously his duties of Bishop and developed parishes in the farthest corners of the diocese. Weak from sickness, he died the 26th December 1727 in the H√¥pital G√©n√©ral, which he founded. His last words showed his charity, for he said: \\"Forget me, but do not forget my poor\\". The Abbot Gosselin who wrote about the Bishop Saint-Vallier in the late 19th century said of him: \\"especially by his great virtues and the holiness of his life, he is revealed in history with the halo of charity and disinterest: his memory shall be eternal\\" (surtout par ses grandes vertus [‚Ä¶] et la saintet√© de sa vie, [‚Ä¶] il nous appara√Æt dans l‚Äôhistoire avec l‚Äôaur√©ole de la charit√© et du d√©sint√©ressement : sa m√©moire sera immortelle)  See also  *Michel Bertier *Michel Sarrazin References =Bibliography= * Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online * the Catholic Encyclopedia - Jean- Baptiste de Saint-Vallier *Saint-Vallier, Jean-Baptiste de La Croix de Chevri√®res de.

It was held from 7-15 June. Domestic and family life in general were represented by the festival of the goddess of the house and of the spirits of the storechamber ‚Äî Vesta and the Penates ‚Äî on Vestalia. On the first day of festivities the penus Vestae (sanctum sanctorum of the temple of Vesta which was usually curtained off) was opened, for the only time during the year, at which women offered sacrifices. As long as the curtain remained open, mothers could come, barefoot and disheveled, to leave offerings to the goddess in exchange for a blessing to them and their family. The animal consecrated to Vesta, the donkey, was crowned with garlands of flowers and bits of bread on 9 June. Ovid says that donkeys were adorned with necklaces of bread-bits in memory of the myth where Vesta is nearly violated by Priapus. In that myth, it is the untimely bray of a donkey that startles Priapus causing him to flee. Before that, he says donkeys were honored on 9 June in thanks for the services they provided in the bakeries.Ovid, Fasti VI. 319-48 The final day, 15 June, was Quando Stercum Delatum Fas [\\"when dung may be removed lawfully\\"]. The penus Vestae was solemnly closed, the Flaminica Dialis observed mourning, and the temple was subjected to a purification called stercoratio: the filth was swept from the temple and carried next by the route called clivus Capitolinus and then into the Tiber. The military Feriale Duranum of AD 224 records the first day of Vestalia as Vesta apperit[ur] and the last day as Vesta cluditur.

It extended from the Clinchfield Railroad at Miller Yard in northeastern Scott County north and west to Appalachia and north to the main yard at Andover, with many branches to the north into the mountains. The company still exists as an operating subsidiary of the Norfolk Southern Corporation,Class I Railroad Annual Report: Norfolk Southern Combined Railroad Subsidiaries To The Surface Transportation Board For the Year Ending December 31, 2007 but is operated as if it were a Norfolk Southern Railway line. Route description The Interstate Railroad generally followed the valleys of the Guest River and Powell River, with only one summit, at Norton, between those two rivers. The railroad began at the Clinchfield Railroad's Miller Yard, along the Clinch River between Dungannon and Carfax. It started off paralleling the Clinchfield to the northeast until its crossing of the Guest River (the line between Scott County and Wise County). The Interstate crossed the Guest River and split away to the north, running first along its east shore and then along its west shore and through the short Swede Tunnel. The Interstate crossed the Guest River again, where the river turned west, and continued north through another tunnel to Maytown. At Maytown, the railroad turned west, continuing to follow the Guest River (and crossing it several times) via Riverview, Tacoma, Ramsey, and Hawthorne to Norton, where it interchanged with the Norfolk and Western Railway and Louisville and Nashville Railroad. The Interstate ran west from Norton to Dooley, where it interchanged with the L&N; again (at Dorchester Junction). From there it generally paralleled the Powell River past Josephine, Blackwood, and Kelly View to Appalachia. There it interchanged with the Southern Railway and again with the L&N; and turned north alongside Callahan Creek to the main yard at Andover. Several branches continued north alongside creeks, ending at Wentz, Roda, and Derby. Other branches left the mainline east of Norton (to Glamorgan and Dixiana), at Dorchester Junction (to Needmore), and east of Kelly View at Kent Junction (to Roaring Fork and Pardee). These branches all ran north alongside waterways; the one to Dixiana used the valley of the Guest River, and the one to Needmore ran along the Powell River.  Heritage Unit  As a part of Norfolk Southern's 30th anniversary, the company painted 20 new locomotives into predecessor schemes. NS #8105, a GE ES44AC locomotive, was painted into the Interstate scheme. It is commonly known by railfans as the \\"Creamsicle.\\" NS Heritage unit 8105 in Interstate Railroad colors at Weller Yard, Grundy, Virginia, June, 2019.

Laser Chess first appeared in Compute!'s Atari ST Disk & Magazine in 1987, written in Modula-2, winning the $5,000 first prize in a programming competition held by the magazine. Ports of the game written in BASIC and machine language were published in the June 1987 issue of Compute! for the Amiga, Commodore 64, Apple II, and Atari 8-bit family as type-in programs. Laser Chess has been re-implemented many times over the years, including a variant Advanced Laser Chess with a larger board and additional pieces. Gameplay Players take alternate turns taking two actions with their pieces. An action consists of moving a piece vertically or laterally, rotating a piece 90 degrees, or \\"firing\\" the laser cannon. A teleporter piece can teleport pieces that it lands on. Moving a distance of one square takes one action; moving two squares takes two actions. Since a player has only two actions per turn, the maximum distance a piece can be moved on one turn is two squares. Pieces can be moved forward, backward, left, or right, but not diagonally. However, a player can effectively move a piece diagonally by using two actions‚Äîforward and right, for example. =Firing the laser= On a player's turn, the player can elect to fire the laser cannon. Firing the laser cannon takes only one action, but can be done only once per turn. Therefore, a player may want to use the first action in a turn to aim the laser, rotate a reflecting piece to set up a reflected shot, or move another piece into position. Laser beams are absorbed if they hit the edge of the board. The laser will bounce off any mirrored piece, so both a player's own and the opponent's pieces may be used to set up a shot. Since a player is focused on creating a path from that player's laser cannon to a target of interest, the player must be aware that a return path is also created for the opponent at the same time. Some mirrored pieces can be destroyed by aiming the beam at one of their non-reflective sides, while others will simply absorb the beam harmlessly. Each player also has a beam splitter. Legacy In an MS-DOS re-implementation by Peter Venable (1994),Shareware Game: Laser Chess. archive.org. the pieces move like normal Chess pieces on a 9x9 board, with the laser moving like a king, and a turn consists of making any number of rotations to one's pieces followed by either playing a Chess move or firing the laser.

His latest recording, I Miss Everything was released January 31, 2017. He currently fronts the band Joseph King and the Mad Crush and formerly fronted the bands Deadbeat Darling, Canvas, and Murder My Sweet. Wanderlusting Joseph's album Wanderlusting was recorded during the summer of 2013 at Bird Creek Studios in the woods of upstate New York with co-producer, studio owner and long-time friend Drew Nix. Inspired by the solace of the isolated bucolic surroundings, the pair created a collection of songs which act as vignettes into a year in Joseph's life when his former relationship, band and record label all collapsed. The album exudes a sense of celebration, mischief, irreverence and beauty, and has a stripped-down indie rock meets 60's surf sound. To tour the album, Joseph formed a three-piece live band with himself on lead vocals and guitar, Kayce Laine McGehee on keyboards and backing vocals, and Will Whatley on drums. The group played a sold out album release concert March 6 at Rockwood Music Hall in New York City before setting out on nationwide tour dates. Deadbeat Darling Joseph formed the band Deadbeat Darling in 2006 after moving to New York City from Austin, Texas. The band released their debut EP Belle Epoch in 2007, and followed with the LP Weight of Wandering in 2009. In 2012 they were signed to British record label Spearhavoc Records for the release of their second LP The Angel's Share. Deadbeat Darling played several national tours as well as touring in the UK and became one of the strongest drawing bands in the New York indie music scene, selling out the Bowery Ballroom four times. Canvas King formed his first band Canvas at age 19 while a student at Stanford University. The band settled in Austin, adding bassist Brad Byram, lead guitarist Julian Mandrake, and drummer Scott Thomas. The group released four albums and toured relentlessly, playing over 500 concerts and becoming one of the most popular bands in Texas, before going on hiatus in 2006.

It is located alongside the River Ouse and north of the A161 road between Goole and Scunthorpe. Ousefleet and Reedness are to the east and west respectively. It forms part of the civil parish of Twin Rivers. Historically Whitgift was part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Features There was for many years a Whitgift ferry, which may originally have predated the village. =Church= Whitgift Church clock has a XIII The Church of Mary Magdalene (on the Whitgift side of the border between Whitgift and Reedness) dates from 1304 (replacing an earlier building, 11th-12th century or earlier). It has a famous clock with an unusual feature: instead of 12 (XII in Roman numerals) it has a 13 (XIII). Reasons vary, but local rumour relates that it may be due to the church being adjacent to a pub (now closed) at which the painter imbibed before completing the job. The church was designated a Grade I listed building in 1967 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. =Hall= Whitgift is also notable for Whitgift Hall, a grade II* listed Georgian manor house built in 1704 by a family called Stephenson. Since it was built, it has undergone significant change. For example, bay windows were added and the current owners have a caravan site and fishing pond. =Lighthouse= Whitgift lighthouse was erected just north of the village in the late 19th century, for the Aire and Calder Navigation: a five-storey cream-painted tower with a stone base, it stands high. It remains operational, a waymark for ships travelling to and from Goole docks, and is Grade II listed. =Other= Other features include a Methodist chapel, but Whitgift mainly consists of a sparse strip of houses spread out over its length bounded by the River Ouse to the north and fields to the south looking towards Eastoft. History The place-name 'Whitgift' is first attested in a Yorkshire charter of circa 1080, where it appears as Witegift, and in a charter of 1232 where it appears as Whitegift. The name is thought to mean 'Hviti's or Hwita's gift'. Whitgift was previously a civil parish that was part of the Goole Rural District in the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1894 to 1974, then in Boothferry district of Humberside until 1996.

The auditorium is situated next to the old Fort Caswell and faces the parade ground. Construction of the auditorium was made possible by a gift from Rachel E. Hatch upon her death in October 1966. Her estate, which included in Duplin County, was valued at $200,000. Hatch was an Episcopalian who is quoted as saying, \\"The Baptists have their hand on the pulse of humanity and seek to touch the needs of the people.\\" Ground was broken in the fall of 1967 and the auditorium was dedicated on July 17, 1968 with a trumpet fanfare and singing. Total cost of the auditorium was $400,000. Layout The auditorium consists of the main floor, an upstairs and downstairs front lobby, a balcony, and two classrooms behind the stage. In the original building, two rooms opposite each other in the upstairs lobby served as a kitchen and sitting room. Those rooms now serve as utility and storage. The main floor and balcony accommodate approximately 1,000 people in pew seating. To the rear and center of the balcony there is a sound booth with an excellent view of the stage. The stage itself is surprisingly large and it is currently rumored that it may be shortened in an effort to add more seating. The classrooms are known as \\"Hatch A,\\" located just behind stage left, and \\"Hatch B\\" which is behind stage right. To each side of the stage there are double doors leading into side exit lobby areas. These lobbies also have the entrances to the classrooms and directly to the stage itself. The downstairs lobby of Hatch has two of the auditorium's restrooms (the other two are located in the rear hallway which connects the two classrooms) and they face each other on the left and right sides next to the entrances to the main floor. On the wall between the entrances hangs a portrait of Rachel Hatch. Features The exterior of the building was originally designed to reflect its wooden interior and was brown. It wasn't until the campus was completely standardized to its now familiar blue/gray tones that Hatch was repainted. The front upstairs and downstairs lobbies are, essentially, one room with two staircases leading up. One of the most remarkable features of the building is its glass facade which stretches over both floors. Inside the auditorium itself, the rafters are painted brown and wood is the dominante design texture. The curved back wall of the auditorium features an intricate pattern of small beams which also work to disguise the built in organ speakers. These speakers appear to be a part of the wall itself. Also the back wall there is a large, brass cross mounted high above the stage. The facility was recently (2006) upgraded in the sound and lights department with over 20 new lights mounted, a new lightboard, a new speaker system, and a digital soundboard. Impact For the thousands of visitors of the Assembly the importance of Hatch Auditorium is undeniable. Many programs take place in the auditorium throughout the year but the most important, perhaps, are the study and worship sessions held in it during the summer youth camps. Each week the auditorium is usually the place in which most people come to make decisions regarding their faith in Jesus Christ. Because of this, Hatch auditorium holds a special place in the hearts of those who have been affected by their experiences there. Ghosts? Like many other places on the campus of the assembly, Hatch Auditorium is rumored to be \\"haunted.\\" Many stories do exist which seem to suggest that something strange does happen there on occasion. Footsteps are heard in the back hall and on the stage when no one else is there. Electrical equipment mysteriously malfunctions and, in at least one case, a figure has been reported to have walked down the right main aisle just before vanishing instantly. One particularly vocal supporter of the validity to the hauntings believes they are caused by Rachel Hatch herself, who died after choking on a hot dog in the cafeteria at Caswell. Rumor has it that when her picture in the lobby is taken down, bad things happen during the next service.

He was the first president of the Ecological Society of America in 1915, and helped found the Nature Conservancy in the 1940s. Shelford's early visits and study of Volo Bog in Northern Illinois helped establish its ecological significance.Smith, S. & Mark, S. (2009). The Historical Roots of the Nature Conservancy in the Northwest Indiana/Chicagoland Region: From Science to Preservation. The South Shore Journal, 3. Volo Bog became the first purchase of the Illinois Nature Conservancy. Background and education Shelford was born in Chemung, New York, the eldest son of Alexander Hamilton Shelford and Sarah Ellen Rumsey Shelford. After ten years of schooling, he taught at public schools in Chemung County, New York in 1894. He attended Cortland Normal and Training School for two years and took a teaching certificate, and returned to teaching at public schools from 1897 to 1899. From 1899 to 1901 he attended West Virginia University, where he was influenced by his uncle William E. Rumsey, the assistant state entomologist. In 1901, West Virginia University's president, Jerome H. Raymond, accepted a professorship at the University of Chicago, where he secured a scholarship for Shelford, who soon transferred. Here he took a position as associate and instructor in zoology from 1903 to 1914. Much of his early work was greatly influenced by Henry C. Cowles. Shelford wrote his doctoral thesis on \\"Tiger Beetles of Sand Dunes,\\" which described the relation between beetle populations and vegetational succession, a topic of interest to Cowles. He completed his paper in 1907 and received a Ph.D. on June 11 of the same year. The next day he married Mary Mabel Brown, with whom he would have two children. Early career His thesis work led him to five further publications on \\"Ecological Succession,\\" which were published in the Biological Bulletin in 1911 and 1912. By 1913 he published one of his great works on ecology, Animal Communities in Temperate America. He took a position for the University of Illinois, where he would end up spending most of his career, in 1914 as an assistant and associate professor of zoology. From then he would help organize the Ecological Society of America (ESA), and became its first president in 1916. He helped compile a Naturalist's Guide to the Americas, published in 1926, for the ESA. This helped him with his later work, The Ecology of North America (1963). By 1927 Shelford was made a full professor in his position at the University of Illinois. He also was interested in experimental research in both the field and the laboratory. In 1929 he had published Laboratory and Field Ecology, which served as a method book for research in animal ecology. Shelford was known to travel into the field every summer to conduct research. He initiated the \\"century-cycle\\" project in 1933 at the University of Illinois' William Trelease Woods, which was used to study the relation between vertebrate and invertebrate populations with environmental factors. The first fifteen years of data collected from this project was published in 1951 in Ecological Monographs. Shelford was the biologist in charge for the Illinois Natural History Survey at their research laboratories from 1914 to 1929. He had also been director of marine ecology at the Puget Sound Biological Station during alternate summers from 1914 to 1930. Some of his work from this time was published in 1935 in Ecological Monographs. Later life and work Much of Shelford's work was on terrestrial ecology, but he also did much aquatic research. Some of his publication in Ecology were studies from locations such as stream communities (1929), bottom communities in western Lake Erie (1942), analysis of tundra communities (1935), and of Mississippi floodplains (1954). He published a work in 1939 in Bio-Ecology in collaboration with Frederic E. Clements which attempted to integrate animal, plant, and aquatic ecologies as part of an ideal community. He left the University of Illinois in 1946, but the same year would found the Ecologist's Union, an organization which promoted the need to preserve entire ecological communities as part of nature conservation. The Union was founded in response to the ESA deciding it would be inappropriate for a scientific society to take a political stance. The Ecologist's Union is today known as The Nature Conservancy. Shelford's work with Clements helped to begin to develop the idea of biomes by characterizing them through flora and fauna. His next work would take this further. Representing his last major work, The Ecology of North America (1963) brought Shelford throughout North America in his research.\\"Shelford, Victor Ernest\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2006. In 1968, he received the Eminent Ecologist Award of the Ecological Society of America for his lifelong contributions to the field of ecology. He also chaired numerous committees, including the Committee on the Preservation of Natural Conditions of the Ecological Society from 1917 to 1938, and the National Research Council Committee on Grasslands from 1932 to 1939. In addition, he founded the Grassland Research Foundation in 1939, which he presided over in 1958, and served as chairman of their scientific advisory board from 1959 to 1968.

He was probably born in the 1090s and may have died about 1160. Along with his younger contemporary known as the Archpoet, he marks the opening of a new period in Latin literature. Biography The earliest and best-known source for Hugh Primas's life is in a passage added to the text of the Chronica of Richard of Poitiers for the year 1142: Hugh is also mentioned in the Chronicle by Francesco Pippino, and he may be \\"Primasso\\", the subject of a story in Boccaccio's Decameron (1.7). Other medieval writers say very little about his life: they knew \\"Primas\\" for his poems. Yet they rarely quoted them under his name. Modern scholars were therefore able to attribute no work to Hugh Primas until Wilhelm Meyer observed, in 1906, that one poem actually contains the name \\"Primas\\". Meyer then realised that the Oxford manuscript containing this one poem includes a collection of twenty-two others that are probably by the same author, including another seven containing the internal signature \\"Primas\\". The twenty-three poems identified by Meyer, and edited by him in 1907, are now generally accepted as the work of Hugh Primas, though A. G. Rigg has expressed doubts about some attributions.

Inverse problems are found in many branches of science and mathematics, but this approach is probably best known for its applications in condensed matter physics and solid state chemistry. Applications in condensed matter sciences =Basic method= This method is often used in condensed matter sciences to produce atom-based structural models that are consistent with experimental data and subject to a set of constraints. An initial configuration is constructed by placing atoms in a periodic boundary cell, and one or more measurable quantities are calculated based on the current configuration. Commonly used data include the pair distribution function and its Fourier transform, the latter of which is derived directly from neutron or x-ray scattering data (see small-angle neutron scattering, wide-angle X-ray scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and X-ray diffraction). Other data that are used included Bragg diffraction data for crystalline materials, and EXAFS data. The comparison with experiment is quantified using a function of the form where and are the observed (measured) and calculated quantities respectively, and is a measure of the accuracy of the measurement. The sum is over all independent measurements, which will include the sum over all points in a function such as the pair distribution function. An iterative procedure is run where one randomly chosen atom is moved a random amount, followed by a new calculation of the measurable quantities. Such a process will cause to either increase or decrease in value by an amount . The move is accepted with the probability according to the normal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, ensuring that moves that give better agreement with experimental data are accepted, and moves that worsen agreement with experimental data can be accepted to a greater or lesser extent corresponding to how much the agreement has worsened. Moreover, the move may also be rejected if it breaks certain constraints, even if the agreement with data is improved. An example would be to reject a move which brings two atoms closer than a preset limit, to prevent overlap or collision between the two atoms. Following the acceptance/rejection test, the procedure is repeated. As the number of accepted atom moves increases, the calculated quantities will become closer to the experimental values until they reach an equilibrium state. From then onward the RMC algorithm will simply generate a small oscillation in the value of . The resulting atomic configuration should be a structure that is consistent with the experimental data within its errors. =Applications= The RMC method for condensed matter problems was initially developed by McGreevy and Pusztai in 1988, with application to liquid argon (Note that there were earlier independent applications of this approach, for example those of Kaplow et al. and Gerold and Kern; it is, however, the McGreevy and Pusztai implementation that is best known). For several years the primary application was for liquids and amorphous materials, particularly because this provides the only means to obtain structural models from data, whereas crystallography has analysis methods for both single crystal and powder diffraction data. More recently, it has become clear that RMC can provide important information for disordered crystalline materials also. Issues with the RMC method The RMC method suffers from a number of potential problems. The most notable problem is that often more than one qualitatively different model will give similar agreement with experimental data. For example, in the case of amorphous silicon, the integral of the first peak in the pair distribution function may imply an average atomic coordination number of 4. This might reflect the fact that all atoms have coordination number of 4, but similarly having half the atoms with coordination number of 3 and half with 5 will also be consistent with this data. Unless a constraint on the coordination number is employed, the RMC method will have no means of generating a unique coordination number and most likely a spread of coordination numbers will result. Using amorphous silicon as an example, Biswas, Atta-Fynn and Drabold were the first to elucidate the importance of including constraints in RMC modeling. Since the RMC method follows the normal rules of statistical mechanics, its final solution will be the one with the highest degree of disorder (entropy) possible. A second problem comes from the fact that without constraints the RMC method will typically have more variables than observables. One result from this will be that the final atomic configuration may have artifacts that arise from the method attempting to fit noise in the data. One should remark, however, that most applications of the RMC approach today take account of these problems by appropriate use of implicit or explicit constraints. Implementations of the RMC method There are four publicly available implementations of the RMC method. =fullrmc= FUndamental Library Language for Reverse Monte Carlo or fullrmc fullrmc online documentationfullrmc github accountfullrmc pypi accountfullrmc public Q&A; forum is a multicore RMC modeling package. fullrmc is a fully object-oriented python interfaced package where every definition can be overloaded allowing easy development, implementation and maintenance of the code. fullrmc's computation blocks and modules are optimized written in cython/C. fullrmc is not a standard RMC package but it is rather unique in its approach to solving an atomic or molecular structure. fullrmc supports atomic and molecular systems, all types (not limited to cubic) of periodic boundary conditions systems as well as the so-called infinite boundary conditions to model nanoparticles or isolated systems. fullrmc's Engine is defined and used to launch a RMC calculation. By definition, Engine reads only Protein Data Bank (file format) atomic configuration files and handles other definitions and attributes. In fullrmc atoms can be grouped into rigid bodies or semi- rigid bodies called groups so the system can evolve atomically, clusterly, molecularly or any combination of those. Every group can be assigned a different and customizable move generator (translation, rotation, a combination of moves generators, etc.). Groups selection by the fitting engine can also be customizable. Also fullrmc uses Artificial intelligence and Reinforcement learning algorithms to improve the ratio of accepted moves. =RMCProfile= RMCProfileRMCProfile home page, visited 22 June 2010 is a significantly developed version of the original RMC code written by McGreevy and Puszta. It is written in Fortran 95 with some Fortran 2003 features. It has maintained the ability to model liquids and amorphous materials using the pair distribution function, total scattering and EXAFS data, but also includes the capability of modelling crystalline materials by explicitly using the information contained within the Bragg diffraction data. RMCProfile gives users a range of constraints, including the inclusion of molecular potentials and distance windows, which exploit possibilities afforded by the lack of significant diffusion in crystalline materials. RMCProfile allows simulation of magnetic materials, using the magnetic component of total scattering data, and also allows simulation of materials where atoms are allowed to swap positions (as found in many solid solutions). =RMC++= RMC++RMC++ homepage, visited 22 June 2010 a rewritten, C++ version of the original RMC code developed by McGreevy and Pusztain. RMC++ is designed specifically for the study of liquids and amorphous materials, using pair distribution function, total scattering and EXAFS data. =HRMC= Hybrid Reverse Monte Carlo (HRMC)HRMC homepage is a code capable of fitting both the pair correlation function and structure factor along with bond angle and coordination distributions. Unique to this code is the implementation of a number of empirical interatomic potentials for carbon (EDIP), silicon (EDIP and Stillinger-Weber ) and germanium (Stillinger-Weber). This allows the code to fit experimental data along with minimizing the total system energy.

As of 2018, approximately seven million students enrolled in U.S. schools receive special education services due to a disability. Signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 3, 2004. It became effective July 1, 2005 with the exception of elements relating to the \\"highly qualified teacher\\". It authorizes formula grants to states, as well as discretionary grants for research, technology, and training.Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) - Home Page The latest revision of IDEA became effective in October 2006.  IDEA 1997 vs. IDEA 2004  Since being signed into law, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA) of 1975 has undergone several revisions. It was initially created to assure all children were receiving a free and appropriate public education (FAPE). Updates are made approximately every five years or so. Changes were authorized in 2004 under the new name of Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA). In 2006, additional changes were made to IDEA as final regulations were released. They required schools to use research based interventions in the process of assisting students with learning difficulties, or determining eligibility for special education. Many schools have implemented Response to Intervention (RTI) as a method of meeting the new requirements set by IDEA 2004.  Changes to the IEP (Individualized Education Plan) Process  #Content of the IEP -These encompasses annual goals, short term objectives, educational progress, special education and related services, accommodations and alternative assessments, and transitions. #IEP meeting attendance - A member of the IEP team may be excused if the team member's service will not be discussed at the meeting. This must be approved by the school and the parents. #IEPs by agreement #Review and revision of IEPs #Transition - Clarifies that transition services should begin at age 16, and should include a list of interagency responsibilities with needed resources #Alternate means of participating in meetings.  Changes to Due Process  Changes to due process include the following: Procedural Safeguards Notice only needs to be distributed once per year, Parents have two years to exercise due process rights, changes to the due process complaint notice procedure, parents must go through a mandatory resolution session before due process, responsibility for attorney's fees and requirements for hearing officers.

It starred American IndyCar driver Michael Andretti, and featured the full sixteen-race schedule of the FIA Formula One World Championship circuit (though Andretti himself would only compete in Formula One in the 1993 season). F-1 Hero was unique in that it deviated from most console racing games of its time. Instead of being an arcade-style driving game (such as Rad Racer or Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing), F-1 Hero more closely resembled a simulation-style racing game. It was the first NES racing game to feature an entire field of real-life drivers (although all but Andretti had pseudonyms), and rather accurately depicted the sixteen circuits on the Formula One schedule. Four different cars were offered in the game, however, there were no car set-ups in the game, a feature most frequently associated with racing simulations. Gameplay Compared to most console racing games of its time, F-1 Hero was much more difficult. The circuits were accurately depicted as having both sharp and wide turns, thus requiring players to slow down to certain speeds for corners, instead of most arcade- style games, which allowed players to unrealistically take turns flat-out. Gear shifting was also required for three of the cars (and notably for 8 of the 9 levels of the game), and some courses required dozens of gear changes per lap. Tire wear increased as the races went on, and players would be required to pit for tires at least once during each race to remain competitive. When multiple cars were on the track, the game featured no direct interaction between vehicles. All of the competitors' machines behaved in a ghost-like manner, and could be driven through and occupy the same space as others. Cars were unable to spin others out, and could not directly impede their progress. Nearly every screen in the entire game featured a short- looped, repeating soundtrack. Unlike most racing games, however, there was no music played while actually driving. F-1 Hero featured a 16-race Formula One schedule resembling that of 1988. Each circuit featured a pit area represented by a pylon. On most circuits, the pits were located just prior to the start/finish line. In France, England, Spain, and Australia, the pits were located just after the start/finish line. Four different machines were featured in the game. Each had a unique pitch, and slightly varying top speeds. The Chevy was the dominant machine in the game, despite not being a Formula One car. In reality, it was used in the CART series. Andretti, in fact, drove one in the CART series from 1989‚Äì1991, and the cover art on the game box accurately displays Andretti's 1989 Lola Chevrolet. Grand Prix mode The Grand Prix mode of F-1 Hero featured nine levels of competition. Each had an increasing number of rounds, an increased level of difficulty, and was led by a featured driver. For each level, the player was provided a certain car. Players could save and continue games by use of a password. =Qualifying= Upon entering the Grand Prix mode, the player registers his/her name, and begins at level 1. At the onset of each race, the player is first shown a map of the circuit. On the next screen, the player is shown the results of qualifying thus far. All five computer opponents have completed their time trial run. The top four comprise the tentative starting grid. The slowest computer driver (5th fastest) does not qualify. The object of qualifying is for the player to qualify amongst the top four, and \\"bump\\" his way into the starting grid. Qualifying consists of five timed laps, alone on the track. From a standing start, the player has five laps to record the best single lap time possible. Tire wear influences the speeds, and pitting for tires is allowed on any lap, however, elapsed seconds in the pit area are included in the respective lap time. The fastest single lap is recorded and if it is among the four fastest qualifiers, the player qualifies for the race. If the player does not qualify, he must sit out the race, and instead watch it through the perspective of the featured driver. Hitting the \\"select\\" button during qualifying aborts the session. If the player had already registered a lap fast enough to qualify for the race, it is unnecessary to run all five laps. =Race= The race begins from a standing start, and runs a specific number of laps, depending upon the length of the circuit. The top half of the screen features a map of the circuit, and the position of all four cars represented by icons. Tire wear influences lap times, and a pit stop for tires near the halfway point is required to remain competitive. Players are required to compete, and are not allowed to abort the race. If a car is lapped during the race, he will only be scored for the laps he completed. Spinning out during the race is possible, but no incident ever causes a car to completely drop out of the race. Fuel is also not a factor in the game. =Championship points= At the conclusion of each race, points are awarded to the four finishers (5-3-2-1). At the end of the level, a champion is declared. In order to advance to the next level, the player is required to score the most points and be the champion of the level. If the player does not score the most points in the level, the password given returns the player back to the first race of that level, and he is allowed to replay it from scratch or the player can use the passwords provided after each individual race. If the player scored the most points in Level 9, he would be declared the World Champion, win the game overall, and a special screen displayed. If the player did not win the championship, the game is over. Nakajima Satoru F1 Hero This game was the English-language version of \\"Nakajima Satoru F1 Hero.\\" It was an original Formula One videogame released in 1988) and it was very popular in Japan during that decade. And so, Andretti and Nintendo released this game two years later for a North American audience. Practice mode In the practice mode, players could choose any of the sixteen circuits, and any of the four cars. The bottom half of the screen featured the driving apparatus. The top half of the screen featured a map of the circuit with the player's car represented by an icon as it went around. Upon selecting the course, Michael Andretti would come on the screen and give background and advice about driving the circuit. Practice sessions were five laps each, with elapsed times recorded and reported for each of the five laps upon conclusion. Hitting the \\"select\\" button aborted the session. Two-player mode In two-player mode, players drove in a head-to-head race against another human opponent, or any of the games' computer opponents. Two computer opponents could also be chosen to race against one another. Any of the sixteen courses could be chosen by the players, and any of the four cars could be chosen by the players. Race distance was chosen by the competitors, ranging from one to ten laps. The top half of the screen was the driving apparatus of player 1, and the bottom half of the screen was the driving apparatus for player 2. Instead of a map of the circuit, a graph in the middle of the screen depicted the lap length and the relative distance between the two opponents.

In addition to giving her access to the theatre-world, Thomas Griffith educated Elizabeth in French and English literature. Her father died in 1744, which lead to economic hardship for the family. Her Dublin acting debut took place on 13 October 1749, when she played Juliet to a considerably older Romeo played by Thomas Sheridan at the Smock Alley Theatre. Griffith specialized in tragic roles, such as Jane Shore in Nicholas Rowe's The Tragedy of Jane Shore and Cordelia in King Lear. Elizabeth met her kinsman and future husband, Richard Griffith, in 1746.[2] On May 12,[3] 1751, they married in secret. Elizabeth gave birth to two children, Catherine and Richard. Through her son, her descendants included Australian politician Arthur Hill Griffith, who was her grandson, and French-Canadian actress Jessica Par√©.Par√©, L.G.The Seeds: The Life Story of a Matriarch, by Lucy Griffith Par√© (with Antoine Par√©), Les Entreprises de Carpent Perdu Inc., Ste-Lucie-des-Laurentides, Qu√©bec, Canada, 1984, page 305 ‚Äì 306. Elizabeth and Richard's five year courtship provided the basis for her first publication, A Series of Genuine Letters Between Henry and Frances, published in six volumes between 1757 and 1770.

Richard traveled after the couple married and was absent for extended periods. He borrowed a large sum of money to develop a linen manufactory, which went bankrupt in 1756. During this time, and while Richard was avoiding debtor's court, income generated by Griffith's writing sustained the family. Griffith continued her acting career at Covent Garden, in London, from 1753 to 1755,Napier, Elizabeth R. \\"Elizabeth Griffith.\\" British Novelists, 1660‚Äì1800. Ed. Martin C. Battestin.

Capitalizing on the initial success of the Letters, Elizabeth translated many French works and plays. Between 1764 and 1769, she wrote four plays with varying degrees of success. Griffith's third play, The Double Mistake (1766) was well received at Covent Garden, which emboldened her to approach David Garrick for help staging her next play. Griffith collaborated with Garrick to produce her most successful comedy, The School for Rakes, in 1769.[3] While the two had a tumultuous relationship, Garrick's influence on Griffith was clear. After his death, in the advertisement for the print publication for The Times, Griffith attributed the ‚Äúfirst idea of this piece‚Äù to the late Garrick. While she praised Garrick as a primary influence, the connections she made at Smock Alley Theater in Dublin contributed more to the play's production. Richard Sheridan, the son of her acting mentor Thomas Sheridan, produced The Times, at Drury Lane. While her fame was not the direct result of her acting career, Griffith's theatrical connections were invaluable to her success. Elizabeth Griffith's literary production was steady from 1760 to 1779, garnering her significant notoriety in the literary circles of London. She published essays, epistolary novels, novelettes, translations, and literary criticism. As a hard-working professional writer she produced a large body of diverse works. The last decade of her life was free of the financial struggles she and her husband had endured throughout their marriage. Griffith's son worked for the East India Company as an accountant, and returned to Ireland in 1786 a wealthy man. He settled at Millicent House in Kildare, and Griffith and her husband lived out the rest of their days at this residence. Griffith died at Millicent House in 1793.[2]  Works  Griffith wrote a number of comedies for the theater, five of which were performed: The Platonic Wife (1765), The Double Mistake (1766, though some scholarship questions her authorship of this text), The School for Rakes (1769, an adaption of Beaumarchais's Eug√©nie), A Wife in the Right (1772, also known as Patience the Best Remedy), and The Times (1779). Of these plays, The School for Rakes was the most popular, and earned Elizabeth enough money to place her son into the East India Company.[2] She also published two non-fiction texts. The Morality of Shakespeare's Drama Illustrated (1775) was an extensive critical commentary on Shakespeare's plays. In her preface she claims that Elizabeth Montagu in her Essay on the Writings and Genius of Shakespeare inspired her attempt to defend Shakespeare against Voltaire. Griffith's 529 page tome is significant as it is one of the earliest statements, with Montagu's, on the national importance of Shakespeare. The second, Essays, Addressed to Young Married Women (1782), was published posthumously in the United States as Letters Addressed to Young Married Women (1796). This collection of essays conveyed advice on child rearing, gender roles, and financial responsibility. Griffith earned money for her family through translation work, translating from French into English. Her work included predominantly memoirs and collections of letters by people like Ninon de L'Enclos, Marthe‚ÄìMarguerite, Marquise de Caylus, and even Voltaire. She also translated some French novels, such as The Princess of Cleves: An Historical Novel by Marie-Madeline, comtesse de La Fayette. thumb Griffith was first and perhaps best known as a novelist. The Delicate Distress (1769) was published alongside a work of her husband's, a novel titled The Gordian Knot (1769), in a four volume set. Her format of choice for her fiction was the epistolary novel, as in both The History of Lady Barton (1771) and The Story of Lady Juliana Harley (1776). She also published one dramatic poem, Amana (1764).  Themes and connections  Though Griffith's first plays were deeply critical of the treatment of women, her work underwent a shift soon after her move to London. Griffith found herself attacked by London critics, and she was seen as audacious for demanding respect for women. The need to earn money to support her husband and children led her to conform to audience preferences. After this shift, Griffith's main focus became the domestic sphere. It was at this point that she abandoned the intelligent female protagonist and began to create meek, long-suffering and deeply pained female characters who bear the brunt of a traumatic life with a ne‚Äôer-do-well (and often violent) husband. From here her work became quite moralistic; for example, The Times is a critique of decadent society, and a warning against the dangers of gambling. But, though she had to package it differently in order to retain an audience, she never fully lost her focus on women's issues, and her female characters are always the moral superiors of their male counterparts. Overall, her texts focus on a need for moral development ‚Äì literature as didactic ‚Äì and she tends to use her female characters as the barometer of moral correctness. Griffith did not see herself as alone in this moral quest. She edited a collection of female dramatists such as Eliza Haywood and Aphra Behn. Though these women's plays were at the time linked to sexual immorality, Griffith argued instead that these women were instructional dramatists who were trying to teach the world about proper morality. This was likely the first reassessing of Behn's work particularly, but that of women writers in general, and illustrates the important premium Griffith placed upon proper morality.  Contemporary reception  In her own lifetime, Griffith was probably best regarded for the letters between her and her husband that were published over six volumes. A Series of Genuine Letters between Henry and Frances (1757‚Äì1770) was a celebrated series that featured the edited letters of Mr. and Mrs. Griffith as they moved through courtship to marriage. In the \\"letters\\", genuine sentimentality is the mode of discourse, and women seem to have been drawn to Griffith as a model of womanhood, illustrating sought-after traits such as intelligence, reflection, and humour. Frances Burney wrote in her journal that the Letters \\"are doubly pleasing, charming to me, for being genuine‚Äîthey have encreased my relish for minute, heartfelt writing, and encouraged me in my attempt to give an opinion of the books I read.\\"[3] Her plays received mixed reviews. The Dictionary of Literary Biography states that reviewers of productions of Griffith's work occasionally complained \\"about poor plotting or lack of incident,\\" but that overall audiences were engaged by Griffith's \\"admirable\\" sentiments and morals (175). Though audiences occasionally complained that her female characters were too heavily foregrounded, Griffith's women were often serious characters with well-developed personal values. Griffith was seen as a moralist in much of her work, and was sometimes accused of being unseemly for her use of satire, as it was not considered feminine. Griffith's least successful play was A wife in the Right, which opened on 9 March 1772. Following the opening performance, a second showing for the next night was announced. The crowd responded with \\"shouts for and against [...] apples and half-pence were thrown, a chandelier broken\\" [3], and the performance was cancelled. This unexpected setback forced Griffith to publish the play by subscription; the subscribers included Gertrude Russell, Edmund Burke, James Boswell, Elizabeth Montagu, and Sir Joshua Reynolds.[3]  Recent research  According to the Dictionary of Literary Biography, modern historians of drama have generally considered Griffith's plays \\"undistinguished, often dramatically inept and tediously sententious\\" (175). Modern readers often feel uncomfortable with the conflicting relationship between women's ability and wifely duty and the general tone of subordination to men encompassed within the play. Though there remains very little scholarly work on Griffith's life and literature, her body of work represents both an interesting life and an illustration of the struggles of an ordinary woman of modest means attempting to make a career for herself in the 18th century. While not as well known to modern times as her contemporaries (like Susanna Centlivre), she was certainly a prolific writer in her own period and had made her name in the literary world by the time of her death.

Albert also authored many important books on chemistry, including one on selective toxicity. His father, Jacques Albert, was a businessman in the music industry, and took a bride many years his junior; Mary Eliza Blanche. Albert had two much older half brothers, stemming from his father's previous marriage. After a few years, Jacques died, and so, Adrien Albert was raised by his mother and another relative. Albert attended schools in Randwick and Coogee, but soon settled into the Scots College in Sydney where he excelled in both music and science. He graduated in 1924. Education and appointments He was awarded BSc with first class honours and the University Medal in 1932 at the University of Sydney. He gained a PhD in 1937 and a DSc in 1947 from the University of London. His appointments included Lecturer at the University of Sydney (1938‚Äì1947), advisor to the Medical Directorate of the Australian Army (1942‚Äì1947), research at the Wellcome Research Institute in London (1947‚Äì1948) and in 1948 the Foundation Chair of Medical Chemistry in the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australian National University in Canberra where he established the Department of Medical Chemistry. He was a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science. Scholarship Albert was a scholar of heterocyclic chemistry. He authored Selective Toxicity: The Physico-Chemical Basis of Therapy, first published by Chapman and Hall in 1951. Honors and legacy Albert was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1989 Australia Day Honours for \\"services to medical chemistry, particularly in the fields of teaching and research\\". The Adrien Albert Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Sydney was established in his honour in 1989.

The series revolves around Aki, a busty android maid constructed by the Gene (pronounced Gen-a) Corporation. Her function, besides being a household maid, is the collection of male genetic material (semen) through sexual means, after which it is saved, possibly for species preservation. Slave Doll was followed by a sequel, released in 2001 and produced by Beam Entertainment. Plot Slave Doll tells the story of Aki, is an Android maid created by the Gene Corporation sent to infiltrate the house of the mysterious Kenichi. She disguises herself as an ordinary housekeeper and begins her mission to capture a sample of Kenichi's superior sperm which is made easy by her master's insatiable lust towards her. In Slave Doll II, Aki's sperm collecting days are over, and rather than being scrapped, she serves an eccentric professor as his maid. The professor then gives Aki a bracelet that changes the maid into a super-crimefighter (in the mold of the magical girl). Reception Bamboo Dong, writing for Anime News Network, disliked the humiliation themes of the OVA. She found the story to be \\"standard,\\" but \\"disjointed and awkward,\\" attributing some of this to her dislike.

The facility was built for a cost of $35.6 million and is used for college baseball as home to the University of South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team. Facility overview Gamecocks playing Duquesne on February 21, 2009 The dimensions of the field are down the right and left-field lines and to dead center, matching those of Sarge Frye Field, the previous home stadium of the Gamecocks. The baseball training facilities at the stadium include four indoor batting tunnels, a weight room, team clubhouse, coaches' offices, and a sports medicine room. Among the numerous amenities for fans, there are five luxury suites and two club-level seating areas with lounges, a Gamecock store just inside the main entrance in the outfield plaza, along with a picnic terrace that accommodates around 120 people down the left-field line. The scoreboard towers over the left field wall and features a 28-by-16-foot video screen. The main stadium entrance to Founders Park is located at the northeast corner of the grounds directly behind the center-field wall. Following the 2010 national championship, USC had a mural applied to the backside of its center-field wall (to be viewed as visitors and fans enter onto stadium grounds), celebrating the 2010 CWS Title. In addition, a showcase was built at the base of the wall for the display of the 2010 CWS National Championship Trophy. The mural and trophy case have since been updated to honor both the 2010 and 2011 CWS Championship Teams. In 2013, the website Stadium Journey ranked Carolina Stadium as the second best Division I baseball venue, and received an average rating 4.6 of 5 stars in 7 categories. http://www.stadiumjourney.com/news/06-18-2013/382/2013-ncaa-baseball-ballpark- rankings/ In 2014, the website Stadium Journey ranked Carolina Stadium as the best Division I baseball venue, and received an average rating 4.7 of 5 stars in 7 categories. http://www.stadiumjourney.com/news/07-13-2014/717/ncaa- ballpark-experience-rankings-2014 In 2015, the facility name was officially changed from Carolina Stadium to Founders Park, becoming only the third college baseball stadium in the United States to earn a corporate sponsorship. http://www.wltx.com/story/sports/ncaa/usc-gamecocks/2015/10/22/usc-baseball- stadium-called-founders- park/74392686/http://www.gamecocksonline.com/sports/m-basebl/spec- rel/102215aab.html History The stadium was opened on February 21, 2009, with a 13‚Äì0 South Carolina victory over Duquesne with 8,153 fans in attendance, a record crowd for a Gamecock home game. The ceremonial first pitches were thrown by USC President Dr. Harris Pastides and former Gamecock baseball coaches Bobby Richardson and June Raines. Darius Rucker, former lead singer for Hootie and the Blowfish and USC alumnus, sang the National Anthem.

Early life She was born in Madurai, India, on December 15, 1861, the only child of David Coit Scudder (of the Scudder family of missionaries in India) and Harriet Louise (Dutton) Scudder. After her father, a Congregationalist missionary, was accidentally drowned in 1862, she and her mother returned to the family home in Boston. Apart from travel in Europe, she attended private secondary schools in Boston, and was graduated from the Boston Girl's Latin School in 1880. Scudder then entered Smith College, where she received her BA degree in 1884.Dictionary of American Biography (1977) Supplement 5, p. 616., Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. In 1885 she and Clara French were the first American women admitted to the graduate program at Oxford, where she was influenced by York Powell and John Ruskin. While in England she was also influenced by Leo Tolstoi and by George Bernard Shaw and Fabian socialism. Scudder and French returned to Boston in 1886.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography (1902) James T. White & Company, New York, Reprint of 1891 edition. Academic career and social activism Scudder taught English literature from 1887 at Wellesley College, where she became an associate professor in 1892 and full professor in 1910.The Illustrated Columbia Encyclopedia (1963) 3rd ed. Vol. 18, p. 5575., Columbia University Press, New York. She was one of the founders, in 1887, of the College Settlements Association, along with Helena Dudley, Katharine Coman, Katharine Lee Bates, and other women. She and Emily Greene Balch were also involved with the establishment of the CSA's third settlement house venture, Denison House in Boston. Scudder was its primary administrator from 1893 to 1913. When French died in 1888, Scudder joined the Society of the Companions of the Holy Cross, a group of Episcopal women dedicated to intercessionary prayer and social reconciliation. Also in 1888, she joined the Society of Christian Socialists, which, under William Dwight Porter Bliss, established the Church of the Carpenter in Boston and published The Dawn. In 1893 Scudder was a delegate to the convention of the Boston Central Labor Union. Later, she helped organize the Federal Labor Union, a group of professional people who associated themselves with the American Federation of Labor. Having received a leave of absence from Wellesley for 1894‚Äì1896, Scudder spent a year in Italy and France studying modern Italian and French literature. In 1903 Scudder helped organize the Women's Trade Union League. The same year she became director of the Circolo Italo-Americano at Denison House. Moving farther to the left, in 1911 she co-founded the Episcopal Church Socialist League and joined the Socialist Party. Scudder attempted to reconcile the conflicting doctrines of Marxism and Christianity. She became controversial in 1912 when she supported striking textile workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and spoke at a strike meeting, but Wellesley resisted calls for her dismissal as a professor. In Scudder's famous speech, she declared, > I would rather never again wear a thread of woolen than know my garments had > been woven at the cost of such misery as I have seen and known past the > shadow of a doubt to have existed in this town. ... If the wages are of > necessity below the standard to maintain man and woman in decency and in > health, then the woolen industry has not a present right to exist in > Massachusetts. In 1913 Scudder ended her association with Denison House and moved to Wellesley, Massachusetts, with her elderly mother, who died in 1920. Unlike Eugene Victor Debs and other Socialist leaders, Scudder supported President Woodrow Wilson's decision to intervene in the First World War in 1917. In 1919 she founded the Church League for Industrial Democracy. From 1919 until her death, Scudder lived with Florence ConverseLillian Faderman (1991) Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers, A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America pp. 23‚Äì24., Penguin Books Ltd, London. In Wellesley they resided at 45 Leighton Road.Who Was Who in America (1960) Marquis Who's Who, Inc., Chicago. She lived with Helena Dudley, her closest friend, from 1922 until Dudley's death in 1932. In the 1920s Scudder embraced pacifism. She joined the Fellowship of Reconciliation in 1923, the same year she gave a series of lectures before the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in Prague. Later life Scudder retired from Wellesley in 1927 and received the title of professor emeritus. She became the first dean of the Summer School of Christian Ethics in 1930 at Wellesley. In 1931 she lectured weekly at the New School for Social Research in New York. Having studied the Franciscans extensively after her retirement for Wellesley, she published The Franciscan Adventure, in 1931 which established her as one of the leading Franciscan scholars of her time. She published an autobiography, On Journey, in London in 1937, and a collection of essays, The Privilege of Age, in New York in 1939. Scudder had received the degree of LHD from Smith College in 1922. From Nashotah House, an Episcopal seminary in Nashotah, Wisconsin, she received an LLD degree in 1942. Vida Dutton Scudder died at Wellesley, Massachusetts, on October 9 or 10, 1954, and is buried alongside Florence Converse at Newton Cemetery, Newton, Massachusetts.Lillian Faderman, Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America, Penguin Books Ltd, 1991, pages 23-24.

Founded in 1893, it survived for over 113 years until closing in July 2006 due to a declining student population. The school had been temporarily closed in 2003, but was reopened by a rally of support from alumni and parents. The campus sits on in north-central Kentucky, in the town of Millersburg, Bourbon County. The property is bounded to the northwest by KY-68, to the southeast by railroad tracks and open land, and to the north and south by residential properties. The school was founded in 1893 on the property of the former Kentucky Wesleyan College and moved to its current location in 1920. Upwards of 250 students were enrolled during the school's peak operating times; however, class sizes steadily declined through the early 2000s, resulting in the school's closure in 2006. The U.S. Army Cadet Corps purchased the property in September 2008 and turned it into its national headquarters, as well as a National Cadet Training Center. The facility served again as a military boarding school as Forest Hill Military Academy starting in August 2012. In 2014, the US Army Cadet Corps began a reorganization and closed the school. It was announced in September 2015 that the grounds will once again be auctioned leaving the future of the school uncertain.

Massillon Coicou (, 9 October 1867 ‚Äì 15 March 1908) was a Haitian poet, novelist, playwright, and politician. Born in Port-au-Prince, Coicou was educated in a Catholic school for boys. He was appointed as the Haitian Charg√© d'Affaires √âtrang√®res for the Haitian Republic in France, where several of his works were published. Opposed to the presidency of Pierre Nord Alexis, Coicou publicly announced his intentions to overthrow Nord Alexis' government. He and his two brothers were subsequently executed by the President's orders on the night of 14‚Äì15 March 1908.  Major works  = Po√©sies Nationales = Published in 1892 in Paris by V. Goupy et Jourdan, Massillon Coicou's first collection of poetry earned him the nickname the \\"barde nationale,\\" particularly because the collection features an exhaustive number of poems dedicated to Haitian national heroes such as Toussaint Louverture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Henry Christophe, and Alexandre P√©tion, among others. Critic, historian, and bibliophile H√©nock Trouillot heralded Po√©sies Nationales saying that this series of poetry \\"showed more maturity\\" than his 1903 collections Impressions and Passions, a maturity that would \\"ultimately lead him to write L'Oracle and L'Empereur Dessalines. = L'Empereur Dessalines = Apart from his poetry, Massillon Coicou was a well known playwright. As the former director of the group L‚ÄôAssociation du Centenaire de l'Ind√©pendance Nationale, Coicou created the Th√©√¢tre National Ha√Øtien to which he was an active contributor. His play L'Empereur Dessalines was first performed on October 7th, 1906 to commemorate the centenary of the assassination of Jean-Jacques Dessalines who was murdered by his compatriots on October 17, 1806 at Pont-Rouge near Port-au-Prince. The play tells the story of Dessalines' death, the plot to murder him, and the fractured Haitian state that came as a result of the fall of the first empire. The published edition of the play only features a preface and act one, the second act has never been recovered.  Preface to L'Empereur Dessalines  In the preface to his most well-known and only printed play, Massillon Coicou argues that the assassination of Emperor Dessalines is the first sin of Haitian independence, the ultimate crime against the Haitian people. Coicou continues to pay homage to D√©fil√©e D√©d√©e Bazile known colloquially as \\"D√©fil√©e la Folle,\\" insisting that by collecting the remains of Dessalines' mutilated body that she represents the ultimate embodiment of Haitian patriotism. The preface to L'Empereur Dessalines has been extensively referenced by both Colin Dayan and Jana Evans Braziel in their writing about D√©fil√©e.  Act One  The first act of L‚ÄôEmpereur Dessalines is set around the same royal ball where Dessalines professes his desire for Alexandre P√©tion to marry his daughter C√©lim√®ne in order to create a union between black Haitians and the mulattoes. However, in Coicou‚Äôs play, P√©tion and Henry Christophe spend little time discussing the parameters of this possible union, instead they conspire to assassinate Dessalines. After having learned of P√©tion‚Äôs seditious plans, Dessalines pledges to no longer merely be the father of Haitian independence, nor the country's leader, but its master. Henry Christophe placates Dessalines playing the role of the double agent, forcing P√©tion and G√©rin to confess to their treacherous plot - even though it was P√©tion and Christophe's plan from the beginning. Dessalines ultimately accepts Christophe‚Äôs ‚Äúwise‚Äù proposal because if he executed the two responsible for the conspiracy the Haitian elite would blame Dessalines for their deaths. In Coicou‚Äôs formulation of the Pont Rouge story, Dessalines is the Christ-like figure and Christophe is the proverbial Judas Iscariot. The first act ends with Dessalines riding off to the South to quell the civil war that has allegedly broken out.  Act Two  Although act two of Coicou's play is unpublished, it presumably recounts Dessalines' assassination, dismemberment, and his burial by D√©fil√©e Bazile. The following paragraph is a description of D√©fil√©e's intervention by Beaubrun Ardoiun in his Etudes sur l'histoire d'Ha√Øti': \\"This inanimate body, mutilated, pierced by so many blows to the head, was barely recognizable. It remained exposed at the place d‚Äôarmes until the afternoon when a black woman, named D√©fil√©e ‚Äì long considered mad ‚Äì benefitted from a lucid moment or, rather, was moved by sentiments of compassion, moaned alone before the remains of the Founder of Independence and, after the soldiers had come, by order of General P√©tion, to remove them and carry them to the cemetery, spread flowers over the pit that held the scraps of Dessalines.

Spanish Point is nearby. Name There is a townland on the southern edge of the town called Poulawillin or Pollawillin (). There is evidence that this name was once applied to the town ‚Äì for example, in the Parish Namebook of the Ordnance Survey (1839) there is a reference to \\"Baile an Mhuillinn anciently Poll a‚Äô Mhuillinn, Milltown Malbay\\". Malbay is the name of the bay to the west of Milltown. The name Malbay is thought to come from the Irish meall-bhaigh, which roughly means \\"treacherous coast\\". It could also stem from the legend of the witch \\"Mal\\" who was drowned in the bay by Fionn mac Cumhaill. History The town has only existed since about 1800 but grew rapidly: by 1821 it had a population of 600. During the Great Famine (1844 - 1848) many farmers were evicted by the unpopular landlord Moroney. In the years after the famine the (Protestant) Moroney family went on with rack renting and evictions. At one time the population had enough and started a boycott. The government did not like that and imprisoned all pub-owners and shopkeepers who refused to serve the family or their servant. So at the end of 1888 most pub-owners and shopkeepers were in jail. In the lead up to the Irish War of Independence there were a number of incidents in Milltown Malbay. On 14 April 1920 the local population were celebrating the release of hunger strikers from Mountjoy Prison. It turned into the Shooting at Canada Cross when members of the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Royal Highland Infantry Regiment fired into the crowd wounding seven and killing three: Volunteer John O‚ÄôLoughlan and two civilians Thomas O‚ÄôLeary and Patrick Hennessy. Milltown Malbay was also the site of the Rineen Ambush, which took place near Rineen on the main road to Lahinch and Ennistymon. On 22 September 1920, a RIC tender was ambushed there by the Mid-Clare Brigade of the IRA mainly in retaliation for the killing of Martin Devitt at Crow's Bridge earlier in the year. Six policemen were killed in the ambush. In reprisal for the Rineen Ambush, the Black & Tans ran amok in Ennistymon, Lahinch and Milltown Malbay killing six people and burning 26 buildings, including Ennistymon and Lahinch Townhalls. The Atlantic Hotel was one of the victims of the War of Independence. Owned by the Moroney family and mainly visited by English gentry it had no future and closed down around 1925.Paddy Casey, lecture for the \\"Kilfarboy Historical Society, 13-10-2009. Milltown Malbay was served by the West Clare Railway, which operated from the 2 July 1887 and finally closed on 1 February 1961. The town had a population of 777 according to the 2016 Census. Including the rural area around the town it counts 1,580 inhabitants.Population and Actual and Percentage Change 2006 and 2011 by Electoral Division, Statistical Indicator and Year Last visited 23 April 2012.

A ground test program is generally required before the engine is certified for flight. Ground testing is very inexpensive in comparison to the cost of risking an entire mission or the lives of a flight crew. The test conditions available are usually described as sea level ambient or altitude. Sea level testing is useful for evaluations of start characteristics for rockets launched from the ground. However, sea level testing does not provide a true simulation of the majority of the operating environment of the rocket. Better simulations are provided by altitude test facilities. Sea level tests Sea Level engine test stand at the John C. Stennis Space Center The facility must restrain the rocket and direct the rocket exhaust safely toward the open atmosphere. Structural integrity, system operations, and sea level thrust can be measured and verified. However, rockets are primarily intended for operations in very thin or no atmosphere. Systems that work well on the ground may behave very differently in space. A typical sea level test stand may be designed to restrain the rocket engine in either a horizontal or vertical position. Liquid rocket engines are usually fired in a vertical position because the propellant pump intakes are designed to draw fuel from the bottoms of the fuel tanks. The effect of the propellant weight on the thrust measurement system (TMS) must be accounted for as the engine is firing. The rocket exhaust is directed into a flame bucket or trench. The flame trench is designed to redirect the hot exhaust to a safe direction and is protected by a water deluge system that both cools the exhaust and also reduces the sound pressure level (loudness). The sound pressure level of large rocket engines has been measured at greater than 200 decibels ‚Äî one of the loudest man-made sounds. Solid rocket engines may be fired in either a vertical or horizontal orientation. The thrust measurement system does not need to account for the changing weight of the rocket in a horizontal position. The associated flame trench need not be so sturdy as with a vertical test stand, however a water system may be less effective at reducing the sound pressure level. All test stands require safety provisions to protect against the destructive potential of an unplanned engine detonation. The safety provisions generally include building the stand some minimum distance from inhabited areas or other critical facilities, placing the stand behind a thick concrete blast wall or earthen berm, and using some form of inerting system (either gaseous nitrogen or helium) to eliminate the buildup of explosive mixtures. Altitude tests The advantage of altitude testing is to obtain a better simulation of the rocket's operating environment. Air pressure decreases with increasing altitude. Effects of the lower air pressure include higher rocket thrust and lower heat transfer. An altitude facility is much more complex than a sea level facility. The rocket is installed inside an enclosed chamber which is evacuated to a minimum pressure level before rocket firing. A typical chamber operating pressure of 0.16 psia (equivalent to an altitude of 100,000 feet) is established inside the chamber by some form of mechanical pumping. Mechanical pumping is typically provided by steam ejector/diffusers. If the products of combustion from the rocket firing include flammable or explosive materials, the chamber must be inerted, typically with gaseous nitrogen (GN2). The inerting process prevents build-up of potentially explosive materials inside the chamber or exhaust ducting.

The size of eddies decreases as kinetic energy is lost, until it reaches a small enough size for viscosity to control, resulting in kinetic energy dissipating into heat. The concept of turbulence or turbulent flow causes eddy diffusion to occur. The theory of eddy diffusion was developed by Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor. Because the microscopic processes responsible for atmospheric mixing are too complex to model in detail, atmospheric modelers generally treat atmospheric mixing as a macroscopic \\"eddy\\" diffusion process. In this approach, the diffusion rate at each pressure level is parameterized by a quantity known as the eddy diffusion coefficient, K (also sometimes called eddy diffusivity, with units of m2 s‚àí1).The eddy diffusion coefficient is used in the diffusion equation, to describe the dispersion or mixing of solutes in fluid or atmospheric systems. In natural systems, the vertical component of eddy diffusion, is an important parameter for modeling and describing atmospheric variations due to turbulence and convection. This process of eddy diffusion is the foundation for the structure of the atmospheric boundary layer. In rivers, the eddies cause fluctuations in the river's velocity and their size determines the magnitude of eddy diffusion. The size is usually limited by the depth of the river, due to a rivers depth is usually much smaller than its width.

As the original installment of the Guild Wars series, its campaign was retroactively titled Prophecies to differentiate it from the content of subsequent releases. The game contains a co-operative role-playing portion and a competitive Player versus Player (PvP) portion. In PvP, players may use either their co-operative characters or PvP-exclusive characters who are inherently maximum level and have account-based access to unlocked content.  Gameplay  Players use a 3D avatar to interact with the world around them. The game predominantly features a third-person perspective but also has the option of first-person. These characters are able to walk/run and interact with other characters through chat. They can also perform actions such as fighting and picking up objects, as well as interacting with special objects. = Character creation = Players can choose from a range of up to ten different professions. When creating a character, players can select their hair style, face, skin tone, height and avatar name‚Äîthe selection depending upon that profession chosen. As the player progresses through the game, they can unlock different armor and weapons to alter the visual appearance of that avatar. They can also decide whether they want their avatar to start in a Player vs. Environment world (the RPG aspect of the game), or get right into the competitive Player vs. Player and fight live against other players in the game. The maximum level for character development is capped at 20 - by this point, the character will also have reached 170 attribute points. Players may also choose to do certain quests to gain another 30 attribute points, making the maximum points available 200. Experience can still be gained and is used to learn more skills or buy consumable items throughout the game. = Professions = A profession is a type of class, central to the gameplay in Guild Wars. Each profession has an array of attributes and skills that help narrow a class's proficiency in order to perform a customized role that is determined by the player. The Warrior profession, for example, has access to the primary Strength attribute that increases their armor penetration with martial weapons, and is able to wear heavy armor providing the highest protection against physical damage of all professions. Elementalists, on the other hand, wear less protective armor, but can use their primary Energy Storage attribute to give them a much greater pool of energy than other professions. Guild Wars also introduces the ability to choose a secondary profession, expanding the selection of attributes and skills. A character does not, however, have access to the primary attribute of its secondary profession. Many, but not all, skills become more powerful with more points in a class's primary attribute. A Warrior/Elementalist, therefore, is a warrior who may use spells in combat, although the Elementalist spells used will generally not have as much power as those of a primary Elementalist. This is increased by the fact that runes, which among other things increase attribute levels, can only increase the attribute levels associated with a player's primary profession. There are over a thousand skills in the game that can be acquired by the character over time, but players may only use and equip up to 8 of them at any one time. This introduces levels of strategy, in which one must have a careful selection of skills that work well with one another and with teammates in order to survive. The core professions are Warrior, Monk, Elementalist, Ranger, Necromancer and Mesmer. The Assassin and Ritualist professions are exclusive to Guild Wars: Factions, which can be played along with the aforementioned core professions. The Paragon and Dervish professions are exclusive to Guild Wars: Nightfall, and can also be played with the core professions. Unlike the campaigns, Guild Wars: Eye of the North does not offer any new playable professions. = Environment = The Guild Wars universe consists of persistent staging zones known as towns and outposts. These areas normally contain non-player characters that provide services such as merchandising or storage. Other NPC's provide quests and present rewards to adventurers. These areas are also used when forming groups of people to go out into the world and play cooperatively. Players that venture out from the staging area and into an explorable area are then able to use their weapons and skills to defeat monsters and interact with other objects in the game. As players progress through the game, they gain access to additional staging zones. Players can then transport their characters instantly from one staging area to another using a process commonly referred to as 'map traveling'. = Combat = Apart from fighting with weapons, skills make up the majority of combat interaction. Each skill has a different effect when used, and fall under many different categories. They can range from offensive skills such as setting foes on fire and defensive skills which include resurrection and healing allies. Enchantments that include giving players extra health points or Hexes that drain the enemy's life and add it to your own make up part of the skill selection in Guild Wars. Attack skills are used in conjunction with weapons to augment the damage that they can deal and cause different side effects (such as knocking people to the ground with a hammer, causing bleeding wounds that deal additional damage over time with a sword, or striking multiple foes with an axe). Most skills have a governing attribute that determines its power and effect. These attributes are assigned using a number of attribute points. Guild Wars is similar to collectible card games such as Magic: The Gathering because of the way the different skills interact. While in a town or staging area, a character's skill and attribute selection can be freely modified to construct a \\"build\\". Once in a combat zone (such as an explorable area or a PvP arena), the build becomes immutable until the character exits the combat zone and returns to a staging area. Players generally either choose a specific build for a given area or role, or use builds that synergize with the builds of other characters in the party. A player's ability to help the party is based on the way a player's \\"build\\" works. If the skills combine well, such as a hex spell that makes an enemy attack faster and then another one that makes him miss 75% of the time and take damage for each miss, then the build will work effectively. In PvE, monsters that are slain will generate gold and loot which can be traded or sold to players or NPCs. Unique or rare weapon designs are often found from defeating powerful monsters, or by opening treasure chests. In PvP, reputation in the form of \\"faction\\" is gained based on how well a player performs. \\"Balthazar faction\\" is gained by the number of wins that you and your team achieve, and for each unique kill. Most PvP in Guild Wars is fast-paced, while the transition period between games may take longer. = Competitive gameplay = Player versus Player (PvP) combat in Guild Wars is consensual and team- based. Such combat is restricted to special PvP areas, the majority of which are located on the core area known as The Battle Isles. Individual campaigns also have certain campaign-specific PvP arenas. Players may participate in PvP combat with either their role-playing characters or with characters created specifically for PvP. Characters are rewarded with experience points for victories in competitive battle and the player account also acquires faction points redeemable for in-game rewards. In addition to this victory may also award points which contribute towards completion of character or account based titles. The following are the competitive modes in Guild Wars: ; Random Arena: Four-on-four matches with teams randomly composed from those waiting to enter combat. There are many different arenas with different victory conditions: deathmatch and kill-count. ; Codex Arena: Four-on-four matches with player- managed teams. These matches are played in the same areas as the Random Arena with a few exceptions. Each class has a pool of limited amounts of skills to choose from and this pool changes every 6 hours. ; Heroes' Ascent: A continuous tournament where players form teams of eight to battle in a sequence of arenas, culminating in the Hall of Heroes whose results are broadcast to all online players in addition to rewarding the victors with high-end loot. Arenas in the Heroes' Ascent tournament include deathmatch, altar-control, and capture-the-relic victory conditions. Victories in the Heroes' Ascent award players with fame points that can be used to determine the rank of the player. ; Guild Battles: Two guilds meet in guild halls and stage a tactical battle with the aim of killing the opposing Guild Lord, a well-protected NPC. Victory in guild battles affects the rank of the guild in the global Guild versus Guild (GvG) ladder. GvG is considered the most supported of competitive formats in Guild Wars. In 2005, ArenaNet hosted a Guild Wars World Championship, and in 2006, the Guild Wars Factions Championship was hosted as well. Since then, the Automated Tournament system has become the norm, but smaller 3rd-party tournaments have been hosted, including the Rawr Cup and the Guild Wars Guru cup. The GWWC, GWFC, RawrCup, and GWG Tournament all had real life prizes; the former tournaments had cash prizes, the RawrCup and Guru Tournament had laptops and MP3 players to give away. ; Alliance Battles: Guild Wars Factions introduced an arena where twelve players aligned with one of the opposing Kurzick and Luxon factions team up to fight an opposing team to gain new territory for their faction. The twelve player team is composed of three teams with four human players each. The three teams are selected randomly from the teams waiting on each side when the match begins. Alliance Battles grant alliance faction and affect the border between the two factions in the Factions-specific continent of Cantha. The location of the border affects the map in which the battles take place by adding a bias to favor the faction losing the war. Additionally, alliance faction can be contributed to a player's guild (if it is allied with the respective faction), allowing that guild to \\"control\\" a town in their faction's territory. ; Competitive Missions: Factions also introduced a pair of competitive arenas, named Fort Aspenwood and The Jade Quarry, where randomly assembled teams of 8 players from the opposing factions enact particular events in the Kurzick/Luxon war. Victories in these missions have no global effect, but do grant the players with alliance faction. ; Minigame: Minigames are either competitive or cooperative \\"mini missions\\" or battles that have no bearing on the plot and do not advance the story line of the Guild Wars campaigns. Most are added to the game during festivals and events. ; Hero Battles: Hero Battles was the name given to the mode of PvP known as Hero versus Hero (HvH). In this contest, players would enter the battle with three heroes (fully customizable NPC allies), and fight another player and their team of 3 heroes. A player must have had a named account to participate in Hero Battles. This type of PvP was removed in the October 22nd, 2009 update. Guild Wars has a continuously running automated tournament system. Players or guilds elect to participate in the tournament by buying in-game tokens using their PvP faction points. The participants are divided randomly into groups of 32 that participate daily in up to six Swiss rounds held on a fixed schedule, and the top eight guilds continue on to a single-elimination tournament. Participants who are unable to field a full team automatically forfeit their round. Success in daily automated tournaments qualifies that particular guild for play in the monthly automated tournament, and the final victors of this tournament earn a number of real and in-game rewards. Players who do not participate in the automated tournament were allowed to place bets on the results of these tournaments for a number of in-game rewards prior to February 2010. Many competitive matches may be observed by players by means of an observer mode. Important PvP matches such as matches in the Hall of Heroes or between highly rated guilds may be observed (after a delay of fifteen minutes) by others in order to see the tactics used by successful teams and attempt to learn or counter them. Guilds may additionally observe their own Guild Battles for a fixed period of time. = Co-operative gameplay = Player versus Environment (PvE) missions of Guild Wars use several standard tropes of the MMORPG genre. Players explore the game-world, kill monsters, perform quests and complete missions to earn rewards and advance the story. Rewards include experience points, skill points, skills, gold, faction, reputation and items for the player character. Some of these rewards not only advance the particular character being played at the time, but also unlock features of the game account-wide. In each campaign the player is involved in a linear story with which they interact by performing a series of primary quests and replayable missions. Quests are given to a player by NPCs via text dialog. As quests and missions are completed, new areas, new quests, and new missions are unlocked for the player's character to access. Missions allow the player character to participate in the major events of the storyline, such as significant battles against the main antagonist. Both quests and missions can feature in-game cut scenes which advance the story and provide context to the actions which follow. Cut scenes are in the third-person, often featuring the party leader's character and revealing elements of the game that the character would not normally be aware of, such as the actions of an antagonist. Players are given the option of skipping the cut scenes if all party members agree upon it. There are different types of PvE in Guild Wars, and it is advisable to prepare a build to meet the challenges of each type: ; Cooperative Mission : Missions that move the game story. These form the backbone of the storyline in each campaign. Each requires a party of 4‚Äì8 players (and sometimes NPCs) to complete certain objectives. The party fails the mission if every member dies. ; Explorable Area : Unlike cooperative missions, your party can die in explorable areas without grave consequences, and you will be respawned at a \\"resurrection shrine\\", but there are exceptions. Explorable areas are where quests are accepted and played out. Unlike a cooperative mission, players can work on several quests at the same time. ; Elite Mission : Especially difficult missions, with an 8‚Äì12 player party size, that require a high amount of preparation, skill, knowledge and time commitment. Having the correct team build is a must, and players must coordinate with other team members more than normal. ; Dungeon : Subterranean explorable areas in the Eye of the North expansion. A quest is given to guide the party through the dungeon, culminating in a boss fight, after which rewards are distributed. ; Minigame : Minigames are either competitive or cooperative \\"mini missions\\" or battles that have no bearing on the plot of the Guild Wars campaigns. Some are present in the game only during special events, such as the Dragon Arena for the Canthan New Year and Dragon Festival. Rewards offered for competing in these games include tokens which can be traded for prizes ; Challenge Mission : A special form of mission that is not part of the main story, in which parties aim to reach a high score. Unlike other forms of PvE play, Challenge Missions can theoretically go on forever, with the difficulty increasing the longer the player or party manages to stay alive. = Guilds = Guilds are a core element of Guild Wars, manifesting not only as social units but also being closely linked with the game mechanics. Although a player is not required to join a guild, it adds value to the gaming time and increases camaraderie. Often, joining a guild is a good way to get help from more experienced players as the in-game guild interface allows communication between guild members. A guild leader creates the guild by registering a guild name and a tag (between two and four characters long) with a Guild Registrar, found in some major towns. The guild tag is displayed in brackets after the names of guild members. The leader also designs the guild's cape (from a large palette of shapes, patterns and emblems), and purchases a guild hall that serves as the guild headquarters and may be furnished with merchants, traders, and storage NPCs. Each guild hall is an individual instanced outpost located at the same spot on the Battle Isles, but they are not physically accessible to non-allied members as the only way to enter a guild hall is by \\"map travel\\". The guild leader recruits new players to the guild and can promote a number of them to guild officers, who can then help with the recruitment and further promotion of officers. All player characters on the same Guild Wars account belong to the same guild. Players may leave their guild whenever they please, but only the leader and officers can dismiss non-officer players from the guild; the leader has the additional power to dismiss officers and disband the guild. Guilds have a membership limit of 100 members; player communities with more than that many members generally create allied sister guilds, often named similarly and using the same tag and cape. Up to ten individual guilds may ally together to form an alliance. Members of an alliance may communicate over a shared chat channel, and visit the guild halls of the other guilds of the alliance. Each alliance has a leader guild that initiates the alliance, the leader of which is also the alliance leader, who may admit or dismiss guilds from the alliance. Each alliance must be devoted to either the Kurzicks or the Luxons, the two Canthan factions (from Guild Wars Factions) locked in perpetual conflict. Players can accumulate faction (reputation) with either the Kurzicks or the Luxons, which can either be \\"donated\\" to the alliance or redeemed for certain in-game rewards. The alliances with the highest total amount of donated faction are given control of certain in-game outposts on the Canthan continent; controlling an outpost gives the alliance members access to restricted areas of the outposts, containing, among other things, merchants who sell at a discount. In addition to membership in guilds, a player may be a guest of any number of other guilds. Guest privileges are limited to visiting the guild hall and participating in guild or alliance battles. An accepted invitation expires after 24 hours.  Story  =Ascalon= Player characters begin the game in the fictional idyllic kingdom of Ascalon, which serves as the tutorial content for new characters. The setting is friendly, with few aggressive monsters and a number of easily completed quests. New characters are introduced to the main protagonists of the multi-campaign Guild Wars story: the monk Mhenlo, the warrior Devona, the elementalist Cynn and the ranger Aidan. Player characters also interact with Prince Rurik (voiced by Robin Atkin Downes), the heir apparent of the kingdom. After completing a number of initial quests and selecting a secondary profession, the character is then inducted into the Ascalon Vanguard, an elite force led by the prince himself who are fighting the armies of the Charr beasts who are planning an invasion of Ascalon. During the final quest in this tutorial world, the Charr complete a ritual to unleash a rain of fire and stone upon the world, breaching Ascalon's defensive Great Wall, and reducing most of its cities to ruins. This in-game event, referred to as the Searing, transports the characters into a post-apocalyptic world of constant strife, with no way of returning to the pre-Searing areas. The mechanic employed in the Searing is often cited by ArenaNet as a primary benefit of the instanced design of Guild Wars, which allows world-changing and time-advancing stories to be told individually to player characters instead of requiring the game-world to be static and timeless. In the post-Searing world, the initial portion of the non-tutorial plot sees the protagonists and player characters try to recover their footing against the Charr in the ruined kingdom of Ascalon. In a climactic event, Prince Rurik realizes the battle is lost, and beseeches the king to give the kingdom up and escape alive to the neighboring human kingdom of Kryta. The stalwart King Adelbern--his father--sees no merit in Rurik's plea, and banishes the prince for daring to suggest abandoning his country. A few refugees, including the protagonists and player characters, follow the now-exiled Rurik to Kryta; during the trip, Rurik is trapped and slain by the Stone Summit dwarves, a xenophobic faction who seek to control the passes through the Shiverpeak Mountains and are waging civil-war against the other human-allied Deldrimor Dwarves. =Kryta= The protagonists arrive in Kryta leaderless and attempt to set up a refugee settlement. Soon, they become involved in the war brimming between the White Mantle who govern Kryta and an army of undead, led by an Undead Lich, who are laying waste to the Krytan countryside. During a sequence of missions, the players help the Mantle hold back the undead, for which they are rewarded by being allowed to participate in a Choosing ceremony. During the ceremony, it is revealed that the Mantle are actually murderers who worship obscure beings and use the souls of the slain Chosen villagers to power arcane magical devices. The protagonists quickly decide to join a resistance organisation known as the Shining Blade and put an end to the Mantle. This plot twist also introduces the vizier Khilbron of the destroyed divine kingdom of Orr. However the White Mantle are more powerful than expected, and after some successes by the player they call upon their masters, a powerful race of beings known as the Mursaat, to destroy the Shining Blade and drive the players out of Kryta. =Flameseeker Prophecies= Prophecies introduced Vizier Khilbron, who helps the players escape to the Crystal Desert to partake in the ritual of Ascension. This is the first step to them fulfilling the Flameseeker Prophecies. After ascension, the players have an audience with the ancient dragon Glint, the author of the Flameseeker Prophecy. She aids them in a sequence of missions against the Mantle and the Mursaat, leading eventually to the volcano where \\"the power to destroy Good and Evil\\" is kept sealed. At the urging of Khilbron, the players storm the Mursaat stronghold built around the volcano and release the seals on the door, releasing the Titans, an army of powerful beings of fire from beneath the earth. Khilbron then reveals himself as the evil Lich Lord who was leading the undead in Kryta and who has been manipulating the player since they arrived from Ascalon. He reveals that he is the Flameseeker in the prophecy, not the player, and takes command of the titans and orders them to attack all of Tyria. The players then defeat him in the final mission of the campaign, using his life force to seal the Titans back in their prison. And so the prophecy is fully fulfilled. The Mursaat have been destroyed by the player and the Titans. The Lich's life energy is enough to keep the Titans imprisoned for millennia, removing the need to sacrifice Chosen to maintain the seal. =Sorrow's Furnace= Prophecies introduced, half a year after the campaign, the free Sorrow's Furnace expansion returned players to the Shiverpeak mountains, specifically to the caverns underneath it. There, they participate in a sequence of quests with the final goal of defeating the Iron Forgeman, an immense automaton used by the Stone Summit dwarves to drive their war effort. Sorrow's Furnace introduced \\"unique items\\" to Guild Wars: these are items of set stats dropped by bosses. This model was repeated and expanded in the following Factions, Nightfall and Eye of the North releases. =Gods' Realms= Prophecies introduced two high-end dungeons that have been present in every subsequent Guild Wars release: the Fissure of Woe and the Underworld. These areas are accessible by the avatars of the in-game gods (for a small game-currency fee), and contain some of the most prestigious weapons and armor in the game series. It is, therefore, one of the most intensively farmed areas of the game.  Development  Guild Wars is the first game created by developer ArenaNet. Senior developers from Blizzard Entertainment, some involved in the early development of World of Warcraft, left to create ArenaNet to develop a game which took risks with game design and business model. Guild Wars development was first announced in April 2003. Guild Wars development began in an environment following the release of EverQuest when a number of new MMORPGs were announced. ArenaNet positioned Guild Wars in a niche in this landscape, offering unlimited gametime without subscription fees. ArenaNet believed that players would not pay subscription fees for every online game they play and that paying a fee would cause players to make a \\"lifestyle commitment\\" to a particular game, rather than the usual behaviour of playing many different games and switching between them. Jeff Strain, a founder of ArenaNet, said, \\"It is our opinion that the free online gaming model combined with frequent content updates is the optimum online paradigm for interfacing with consumers and creating a significant, enduring gaming franchise.\\" ArenaNet used open beta testing throughout the development of the Guild Wars series. For the first public appearance of Guild Wars in April 2004, that occurred in conjunction with E3 2004, people were encouraged to download the client and play an online demo of the game to test its networking capabilities. This was followed by a preview event and several beta test weekend events. In addition to the public beta events, ArenaNet used continuously running closed alpha test servers throughout development; some alpha testers were ArenaNet employees but most were volunteers from the player community who signed a non-disclosure agreement with ArenaNet. To support their fee-free approach to online gaming the server architecture developed for the game was core to minimizing the bandwidth costs associated with maintaining game servers. Infrastructure design was influenced by the developers' experiences with Battle.net development. Each time there is an update to the game the existing client automatically downloads a new version which examines a manifest of files to determine which files have been modified and therefore need to be downloaded to the client machine. This manifest is prioritized so that core assets are downloaded prior to the player being able to start the game, and the rest can be downloaded in the background during gameplay. ArenaNet uses this rapid update technology to make changes on demand and close exploits in the system. Sorrow's Furnace added further playable content in September 2005. In 2010, the Prophecies campaign received a major content addition in the form of the War in Kryta, the Tyrian component of the Guild Wars Beyond initiative. This new content was designed to help bridge the 250-year story gap between the end of first game and the start of Guild Wars 2.  Editions  In addition to the standard edition, there are many other editions of Guild Wars: Prophecies available on the market. All of them contain the basic Account Creation Code and Manuscript Book, as well as other added features listed below, ;Pre-order Edition : The Pre-order edition was a disc available for purchase as a stand-alone short duration access, or obtained by pre-ordering the full version of the game. The key allowed the player to access the Guild Wars beta testing. Added to a full account the key gives the player access to a unique weapon or offhand customized for their account. ;Collector's Edition : The Collector's Edition was available for purchase at the game's official release. The Collector's Edition comes with a Guild Wars branded Logitech headset, a free 3-month trial for Teamspeak's \\"SpeakEasy\\" service, the soundtrack by Jeremy Soule on an audio CD, The Art of Guild Wars Book 1 and Divine Aura, a glowing light around the hands of a character when they use an emote. ;Special Edition : The Special Edition contains a (PvP) Skill Pack code which allows 7 regular skills, 1 elite skill, and 2 runes to be unlocked for the account from a Priest of Balthazar. The Special Edition also contains a special music-code to access in-game music from DirectSong.com, the Official Guild Wars Soundtrack CD, The Art of Guild Wars Book 2 and a map of Tyria. ;Game of the Year Edition : The Game of the Year Edition contains the full version of Guild Wars: Prophecies, and was released one year after the game's initial release. It contains an access key which unlocks seven exclusive weapons and accessories, each geared towards one of the six core professions. Each weapon has maximum damage stats according to its type, and each character created can get a customized copy of the weapons. This version was released as the One Million Edition in Europe and is also available as an upgrade to any earlier Prophecies editions via the online store. ;PvP Edition : This edition of Guild Wars is available for the three released campaigns, and is only available from the online store. This version has all of the skills and professions available in the respective version unlocked, but does not allow the player access to the PvE campaign and areas. The edition may be purchased as a stand-alone game, or may be added to an existing account. (Skills may be used by heroes.) ;Guild Wars Platinum Edition : Guild Wars Platinum Edition is a bundle containing both the Prophecies campaign and the Eye of the North expansion. It was released with Eye of the North on August 31, 2007.  Reception =Sales= Guild Wars debuted on The NPD Group's computer game sales charts at #1 for the month of April 2005. NPD ultimately ranked Guild Wars as the fourth-best-selling computer game of 2005. In the United States, it sold 540,000 copies and earned $26.1 million by August 2006. At the time, this led Edge to declare Guild Wars the country's 23rd-highest computer game seller released since January 2000. It also received a \\"Silver\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom; and a \\"Gold\\" award from the Asociaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Distribuidores y Editores de Software de Entretenimiento, for more than 40,000 sales in Spain during its first 12 months. By September 2005, Guild Wars had sold 1 million units. France accounted for 100,000 copies of this figure https://web.archive.org/web/20051019102756/http://www.afjv.com/press0509/050922_ventes_guildwars.htm As of August 2007; Prophecies and the two subsequent campaigns Guild Wars Factions and Guild Wars Nightfall have together sold more than 5 million copies. The game had sold 6.5 million copies by August 2010. =Critical reviews= Guild Wars has been well received by critics, especially for its character designs. It received a score of 89.67% on GameRankings and 89/100 on Metacritic. In 2005, it won several prestigious awards including IGN's Best PC RPG and GameSpy's MMORPG of the Year awards. The editors of Computer Games Magazine presented Guild Wars with their 2005 awards for \\"Best Technology\\" and \\"Best MMO Debut\\", and named it the year's fourth-best computer game. They wrote, \\"With almost every element of the design, ArenaNet carefully thumbs its nose at the model introduced by Ultima Online, codified by EverQuest, and perfected by World of WarCraft.\\" It won PC Gamer USs \\"Best Massively Multiplayer Game 2005\\" and \\"Best Value 2005\\" awards, and was a finalist in the \\"Best Roleplaying Game 2005\\" category, which ultimately went to Dungeon Siege II. The magazine's Chuck Osborn wrote, \\"It's too early to say whether fee-less online gaming is the wave of the future, but Guild Wars is definitely a trendsetter.\\" Guild Wars has been listed in every major Editors' Choice category in both print and online publications. Some contemporary published criticism of Prophecies was heavily informed by the then-dominant World of Warcraft MMORPG formula. For instance, IGN's Tom Mcnamara considered the number and placement of creatures encountered in the PvE world overwhelming, particularly since the party size and number of skills are both limited to eight. He further found combat repetitive, for \\"[a]s fun as combat is, and as pretty as it looks .... [mobs] don't give much (if any) experience points and will be dropping items that are virtually useless to you.\\" GameSpot's Greg Kasavin, on the other hand, hailed Guild Wars its decision to limit active skills to eight as \\"a resouding success\\", noting that \\"[w]hich eight skills you bring to battle and which skills you discover during your adventure is really at the heart of what makes Guild Wars such a compelling experience.\\" Similarly, Eurogamer's Kieron Gillen praised the flexibility of Guild Wars its profession and skill-swap systems for \\"turn[ing] the single-player game into something where you're experimenting, thinking and re-evaluating constantly (since it's easy to rejig your abilities).\\" Tyler Nagata from GamesRadar+ agreed, finding Guild Wars to provide \\"lots of incentive to experiment with various character builds until you find the one that fits your play style best\\" and \\" never let[ting] you feel that you‚Äôve been trapped in a certain character build\\". Second, both players and published reviews have commented on the unnatural coupling of cooperative and competitive matches, which require very different playing styles. At the game's release, PvP focused players were required to \\"unlock\\" their skills and items by playing through the cooperative game, even though a PvP player may have no interest in cooperative gaming. This issue, however, has been addressed by ArenaNet, firstly by introducing Balthazar Faction in June 2005 which enabled unlocking through playing PvP and further in August 2006 by making skill unlocks for the individual professions of the Prophecies campaign available in the game's online store. Unlocks for the professions of the Factions and Nightfall campaigns are also now available.

Although as an organization it did not espouse any particular theory, it was strongly oriented in a general way toward a hyperdiffusionist view that pre- Columbian contact had been extensive. It was greatly influenced by the work of Barry Fell. ISAC was founded by Dr. Joseph B. Mahan, a professional anthropologist whose career was primarily devoted to work in museums.Announcement of appointment of Dr. Mahan Headquartered in Columbus, Georgia, ISAC's activities consisted of holding an annual conference and of publishing books advocating the hyperdiffusionist view. ISAC continued holding annual conferences after the death of its founder and President Dr. Mahan in 1995. The 30th Anniversary Conference was celebrated in 2003.

It was created by the Chinese-American physicist Tsung- Dao Lee and Chinese physics community as an alternative graduate school admission procedure. At that time in China, higher education was still recovering from the Cultural Revolution; school transcripts and recommendation letters were difficult to evaluate. Furthermore, standardized tests such as the Graduate Record Examination were unavailable in China. Details The CUSPEA exam is in English and has a similar scope to that of Ph.D. written qualifying exams in major American universities. The questions were prepared by physics professors from participating North American universities -- starting with Columbia University where Lee worked, and eventually expanded to 97 universities. Committees of physicists in China administer and grade the exams. The examinees are usually senior physics majors from top-ranking Chinese universities. Those who passed the exam are followed up by an interview by a small American delegation. The final admission depends on mutual agreement between the applicant and participating physics departments. About 100 Chinese students went to the US every year through the CUSPEA exams, and the total number is 915. Over the years, the three universities with the most students passed the exam are (numbers in the parentheses indicate the numbers of students) University of Science and Technology of China (218), Peking University (206) and Fudan University (127). Similar Exams CUSPEA was so successful that other similar exams soon were created, such as CUSBEA for biochemistry and \\"Shiing-Shen Chern Project\\" (ÈôàÁúÅË∫´È°πÁõÆ) for mathematics. All were stopped in the late 80s in favor of more standard exams. Continuation as Mini-CUSPEA and Re-Expansion In the early 1990s, several years after the suspension of the CUSPEA exam, a new program called Mini-CUSPEA was created. The new program name referred to the fact that only one Chinese university, namely Fudan University, was now involved. Likewise, in the U.S., the number of target universities had been shrunk to three - Columbia University, New York University, and the City University of New York. Mini-CUSPEA applicants sit written exams and attend interviews, similar in style to the old CUSPEA admission tests. Around 6-10 students are admitted annually. The usual requirements (TOEFL and GRE) for Chinese students studying in the U.S are waived for successful Mini-CUSPEA applicants. Since 2007, the Mini-CUSPEA program has started to expand. The Chinese universities involved now include Peking University, Tsinghua University and other top universities. Expansion is also planned on the U.S. side.

It lies in the south-east of the county, at the junction of the R191 and the R194 regional roads near the towns of Virginia and Bailieborough. St Kilian and churches The town has a heritage centre dedicated to St Kilian, who was born in Mullagh c 640 and was martyred in W√ºrzburg in Franconia in northern Bavaria, Germany, in circa 689. The centre also has an exhibition related to ogham script and the development of illuminated manuscripts. The Catholic church, a Victorian neo-Gothic structure located 400m from the village on the Virginia Road (R194), is named in memory of its patron, Saint Kilian. It was built in the late 1850s.Mulligan, Kevin V., The Buildings of Ireland: South Ulster - Armagh, Cavan and Monaghan (popularly known as the Pevsner Guide to South Ulster). Yale, New Haven and London, 2013. Ruins of an earlier church, known as the Teampeall Ceallaigh, remain in what is now part of the Church of Ireland grounds located approximately 600m along the same road. Development Mullagh's population has seen an increase from 679 residents in the 2006 census, to 1,137 in the 2011 census, to 1,348 in the 2016 census. The environs of the village have witnessed substantial housing and industrial development over these years. Mullagh's relative proximity to the new M3 motorway has had the effect of making the capital city more accessible to Mullagh and County Cavan. Amenities Mullagh Lake seen from Mullagh Hill Amenities locally include Mullagh Lake and Hill Walk (2 kilometers outside the village on the Virginia Road), Tennis Court and People's Park on Mullagh Fair Green, Children's Playground beside the St. Kilian's Heritage Center. The Edwin Carolan Memorial Park includes a full size GAA pitch (open to all sports), a 440-metre track around its perimeter, a multi purpose Sports Centre and Gym. In the winter, the track is lit each night from 7.30 to 10pm or so to facilitate walking and running. Local community organisations Local community organisations include a men's and ladies GAA club (C√∫chulainns GFC), Community Games (athletics club), a drama society (Millrace Drama Group), a golf society, friendship club, parent and toddler group, Girl Guides and Boy Scouts. Separate committees include the Mullagh Tourism & Community Development Committee, Mullagh Tidy Towns, and St Kilian's Housing Association. Transport Bus √âireann route 108 provides three journeys a day (one on Sundays) to Kells in County Meath for onward journeys, and three journeys a day (one on Sundays) to the neighbouring town of Bailieborough Events Mullagh Fair Day was one of the biggest fairs in the North East, and its proximity to the Virginia Road railway station ensured that cattle purchased in Mullagh could easily be transported to ports in Dublin and Drogheda. However the opening of the Mullagh mart in 1957 finally brought to a close a long chapter in the history of Mullagh, since the first charters and licences were granted in 1621. The Mullagh Tourism & Community Development Committee re-established the Fair Day in 1997, and it has since grown to be one of the largest one day shows in the North East. The fair takes place each year on the 2nd Sunday in September. Historic associations The V. Rev. Dr Jonathan Swift, Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, wrote parts of Gulliver's Travels and The Tale Of The Tub whilst staying near Mullagh. Dean Swift was staying at the country home of his cleric friend The Rev. Thomas Sheridan at Quilca House, which is close to the old, historic Mullagh village. Other notable descendants from the (Quilca) Sheridan family are the 18th century playwright Thomas Sheridan and notable writer Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The original historic village of Mullagh was situated over a kilometre north-west of the present village close to Mullagh Lake, just off the Virginia Road, but there no longer remain any distinguishing features.

She pioneered the work of single women missionaries in China and eventually married the founder of the mission, James Hudson Taylor, after the death of his first wife, Maria Jane Dyer. As Taylor's wife, she assumed many roles within the mission agency when Taylor was overseas‚Äîacting at times as a home director for the mission. She encouraged women, both married and unmarried, to participate in the work of the China Inland Mission in ways that had previously only been reserved for male missionaries. Early life in London Jennie Faulding in 1866. Jane Elizabeth Faulding was the daughter of a piano manufacturer in London. She was an 1865 graduate of the Home and Colonial Training College along with her friend, Emily Blatchley. She attended the weekly prayer meeting at the home of Hudson & Maria Taylor in the East End of London in 1865. She was influenced by the Taylors and their book: \\"China's Spiritual Need and Claims\\", that spoke of the desperate need for the Gospel message to be brought to the Chinese before they died \\"without God and without hope in the world\\". The youngest missionary When the Taylors were recruiting missionaries to go with them back to China, Faulding volunteered to accompany the 15 other candidates who were all as inexperienced as herself. She was the junior member of the Lammermuir Party, the largest party of Protestant missionaries ever to sail to China in 1866, but she quickly proved herself useful. Mrs. Jennie Taylor. Pioneering work among women On the journey, they weathered two typhoons and a near shipwreck. Once in China, they donned Chinese clothes and ventured down the Grand Canal, looking for a place to settle down to mission work. It caused a scandal among the other Westerners in China to see a young single woman like Faulding adopt the Chinese dress, which was considered a compromise with an idolatrous culture. However, Taylor was undeterred in encouraging his missionaries to \\"adopt all things not sinful that were Chinese in order to save some\\". In Hangzhou, Faulding proved the value of being an unmarried female, as her daily walks around the neighborhood gave her opportunities to be invited in by the Chinese women, who did not feel threatened as they might have by a foreign man. After she had been in China for five years, she was given a furlough at the request of her parents. Taylor accompanied her home in 1871. She had keenly felt the loss of Maria Taylor, her friend and mentor, the year previously. On the way back to England, Hudson proposed marriage. She accepted on the condition of her parents' approval, which was not easily obtained. In November of the same year they were married. She became the stepmother to Taylor's four surviving children and a successor to Maria as the \\"Mother of the Mission\\". Together, they had two children of their own and adopted an orphaned daughter of a missionary. Leading from the shadows The news of the terrible Great North China Famine of 1877‚Äì78 in Shanxi Province motivated Faulding to go there with two single women as part of a relief team ‚Äì when no men could be spared to accompany them on their journey and her husband could not go, himself. She began an orphanage in Taiyuan, and distributed aid to the starving people there. Faulding worked alongside her husband until the end of her life. They traveled across the globe many times recruiting missionaries and visiting mission stations in China. She died of breast cancer in Les Chevalleyres, Switzerland in 1904. Hudson remained with her at the end of her life.

It was the first of what would become known as \\"snake games\\". It was designed by Lane Hauck, Ago Kiss, and Bob Pecarero.http://www.arcade- history.com/?n=blockade&page;=detail&id;=287 Using four directional buttons, each player moves their character around leaving a solid line behind them, turning at 90 degree angles. To win, a player must last longer than the opponent before hitting something, with the first person to hit something losing. The game ends after one player gains six wins.  Legacy  Several Blockade-style games appeared soon after its release, such as the Bally Astrocade game Checkmate in 1977, Atari's Surround in 1978, and the 1978 TRS-80 computer game Worm. Though Blockade did not reference snakes or worms, many variants were themed as such, including Nibbler and Snake Byte, both from 1982. The 1997 Nokia mobile phone version is simply called Snake. Midway's Tron (1982) included a single-player variant of the Blockade concept based on the Light Cycle game from the film. The player battles against one computer- controlled line-drawing cycle, and three on subsequent levels. This led to Blockade-style games sometimes being called Tron or light cycles.

History Comscore was founded in July 1999 in Reston, Virginia. The company was co-founded by Gian Fulgoni, who was for many years the CEO of market research company Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) and Magid Abraham, who was also an ex-IRI employee and had served as president of IRI in the mid-1990s. On March 30, 2007, Comscore made an initial public offering of shares on the Nasdaq, using the symbol \\"SCOR\\". On February 11, 2014, Comscore announced the appointment of Serge Matta as chief executive officer, effective March 1. Co-founder Gian Fulgoni, who had been serving as chairman emeritus since 2014, replaced Serge Matta as chief executive officer on August 10, 2016. On September 2, 2016, Comscore received a letter from NASDAQ that it was in danger of being delisted from the exchange on September 12 unless Comscore filed its 2015 annual report (form 10-K) and reports for the first two quarters of 2016. On Feb 6, 2017, Comscore announced they would not meet the NASDAQ-imposed deadline to \\"complete its financial restatement and regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements.\\" Because of this missed deadline, \\"Comscore's common stock may be suspended from trading and delisted from Nasdaq.\\" If Comscore is delisted from NASDAQ and their trading is suspended, they advise they intend to \\"be quoted on the OTC Markets.\\" In November 2017, According to the reports, Gian Fulgoni co-founder and CEO retired. On April 23, 2018, it was announced that Bryan Wiener was appointed as the company's chief executive officer, effective May 30. Wiener had previously served as chairman of 360i, a 1,000-person advertising agency known for its ability to help brands capitalize on change through innovation and a data-driven approach to marketing. On April 1, 2019, CEO Bryan Wiener announced that he, along with president Sarah Hofstetter would be stepping down from their respective roles at Comscore, citing irreconcilable differences in strategy with the company's board. On November 5, 2019, Bill Livek was appointed by Comscore's Board of Directors as Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Chairman. Prior to joining Comscore, Mr. Livek served as Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer at Rentrak, where he spearheaded the next generation of products to precisely measure movies and TV everywhere. =Mergers and acquisitions= Comscore acquired Media Metrix in a deal announced in June 2002. Earlier, the Federal Trade Commission announced it would block a bid by NetRatings to acquire Media Metrix. Media Metrix originated as PC Meter, a business unit of market research company NPD Group, and began publishing statistics in January 1996. In July 1997, it changed its name to Media Metrix. In October 1998, Media Metrix merged with a rival, Relevant Knowledge. The company went public as NASDAQ:MMXI in May 1999, reaching a market cap of $135 million on its first day of trading. In June 2000, the company acquired Jupiter Communications for $414 million in stock and changed its name to Jupiter Media Metrix. In the aftermath of the dot-com bubble collapse and associated downturn in internet marketing spending, Jupiter sold the Media Metrix service to rival Comscore for $1.5 million in June 2002. In May 2008, Comscore announced its acquisition of M:Metrics, a company that measured mobile content consumption. The transaction involved a cash payment of $44.3 million and the issue of approximately 50,000 options to purchase shares of Comscore common stock to some M:Metrics unvested option holders. Comscore announced in October 2009 the acquisition of Certifica, an internet marketing company based in Santiago, Chile. The acquisition enhanced Comscore‚Äôs presence in the Latin American market. In February 2010, Comscore announced an agreement to purchase the ARSgroup, headquartered in Evansville, Indiana. On July 1, 2010, Comscore announced that it had acquired the products division of Nexius, Inc. Comscore then acquired for approximately $36.7 million on September 1, 2010. In February 2015 Comscore US entered into a partnership with Kantar owned by WPP with an equity stake purchase. In September 2015, Comscore and Rentrak announced a merger of the two companies. The move was meant to combine Comscore's digital media measurement capabilities with the TV measurement capabilities of Rentrak to create a cross-platform media measurement firm, perhaps capable of challenging Nielsen N.V. in the media measurement space. Under terms of the agreement, Comscore agreed to acquire Rentrak in an all-stock deal valued at about $732 million, with Rentrak shareholders receiving 1.15 shares of Comscore per owned share of Rentrak. The Comscore-Rentrak deal closed on February 1, 2016, with the final transaction being valued at $767.7 million. Data collection and reporting Comscore maintains a group of users who have monitoring software (with brands including PermissionResearch, OpinionSquare and VoiceFive Networks) installed on their computers. In exchange for joining the Comscore research panels, users are presented with various benefits, including computer security software, Internet data storage, virus scanning and chances to win cash or prizes. Comscore estimates that two million users are part of the monitoring program. However, self-selected populations, no matter how large, may not be representative of the population as a whole. To obtain the most accurate data, Comscore adjusts the statistics using weights to make sure that each population segment is adequately represented. To calculate these weights, Comscore regularly recruits panelists using random digit dialing and other offline recruiting methods to accurately determine how many users are online, aggregated by geography, income, and age. Correcting the Comscore data requires having accurate demographics about the larger pool of users. However, some Comscore users are recruited without being asked to give demographic information and, in other cases, users may not be truthful about their demographics. To ensure the accuracy of the data, Comscore verifies its users' demographics during the course of measuring statistical data. The corrected data is used to generate reports on topics ranging from web traffic to video streaming activity and consumer buying power. In April 2020, Comscore launched a faster local TV rating service -- with a turnaround of 48 hours, as opposed to the previous two weeks span it takes TV stations to get TV ratings data. Unified Digital Measurement In May 2009, Comscore introduced Unified Digital Measurement (UDM), a digital audience measurement tool that blended panel and census-based measurement approaches. The methodology calculates audience reach without being affected by cookie deletion and cookie blocking/rejection. Campaign measurement Comscore debuted Campaign Essentials in 2010 to measure how digital campaigns are reaching their audiences. In March 2012, Comscore launched validated Campaign Essentials (vCE), which introduced the notion of ‚Äúvalidated‚Äù impressions. In January 2013, Comscore announced that it had evaluated 4,000 campaigns for clients covering more than 75 advertising agencies. Criticism In 2006, Ben Edelman, a Harvard researcher, alleged that there were cases where Comscore software had been installed on users' computers without their knowledge. Comscore admitted that it was in discussion with a spyware firm called DollarRevenue but said that no contract was ever signed, and that once it realized DollarRevenue was distributing Comscore's software, months later, it took steps to prevent the DollarRevenue-distributed software from sending data to Comscore. Stanford IT notes that the monitoring software has been bundled with file sharing program iMesh without users being aware of it, although Comscore's relationship with iMesh was short-lived and occurred several years ago. In the past, the software forwarded users' internet traffic through Comscore proxy servers, provoking criticism about speed performance. As a result, several universities and banks took steps to block the proxy servers. In response to these concerns, Comscore no longer uses this technology. In June 2010, a warning about Mac Spyware being launched from free applications like screensavers, from security company Intego was reported in the media and implicated VoiceFive, Inc. as the source of certain alleged spyware software. VoiceFive, Inc. has become compliant with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, as well as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Additionally, noted blogger and angel investor Jason Calacanis claimed that Comscore was running an 'extorting ring' by vastly undercounting publisher traffic numbers and forcing them to pay fees for direct measurement via a tracking pixel. Comscore responded to these allegations by offering their direct measurement tracking pixel to long-tail web publishers for free.

Forbes Jr. '70 College is one of the six residential colleges that house all freshmen and sophomores at Princeton University. The College was a gift to the school by Malcolm S. Forbes Sr. '41 in 1984 in honor of his son, Steve. Steve's daughter, Catherine Forbes '99, was a member of Forbes College while attending Princeton. Buildings The college consists of two main parts, each with a subsection: The Main Inn and its subsidiary New Wing, and the Addition, with its Annex. In addition, a two-story house adjacent to Forbes, 99 Alexander Street (nicknamed \\"the Pink House\\"), houses up to 10 juniors per year. The Main Inn and its New Wing were originally part of The Princeton Inn, a hotel with a colonial fieldstone style. The hotel was built by the architect Andrew Jackson Thomas in 1923-1924. It was a popular among parents visiting their sons (and young ladies visiting students at the all- male university). The New Wing was added in 1946, built of red brick. To the south of the main building, is the Annex with additional housing. The hotel was acquired by the university in 1970, and the Addition (designed by J. Robert Hillier '59) was built connecting the Annex and the Main Inn. From 1970 to 1983 the hotel was called the Princeton Inn College, which cultivated a unique campus culture; residents were called \\"Innmates\\" and T-shirts with the slogan \\"Die For the INN\\" (an intramural sports battle cry) still remain in circulation. Forbes is also said to foster a more close-knit community and social life, because of its unique set up. The Forbes College Addition includes a single-sex floor, one of only two in the Princeton University residential colleges. Forbes has some excellent amenities. These include private bathrooms for many of the suites (for rooms in the former hotel portions, plus a few in the Addition), and a dining hall, library, theater, and caf√© that can be reached without ever going outdoors. The dining hall was noted for outstanding Sunday brunch. Forbes is also close to the late-night snack mecca, Wawa (\\"the Wa\\"). Affiliations Forbes is a two-year college, paired with nearby Whitman College. Only first- and second-year students (with the exception of several upperclass Residential College Advisors) live in Forbes. Forbesians who wish to live in a residential college past their sophomore year may move into one of the three four-year colleges, Whitman, Mathey, and Butler. Since Forbes is paired with Whitman College, priority for housing in Whitman is given to students who spent their first two years living in Forbes or Whitman. Therefore, although it is possible for a Forbesian to move into any of the three four-year colleges after sophomore year, it is most advantageous for him or her to move into Whitman. Life at Forbes =Activities and events= Forbes College hosts a diverse range of intellectual, social, and cultural events. Over dinner, about two to three times a semester, invited guests speak to Forbes residents about their travels, their work or research, their latest publication, or simply provoke with some unconventional ideas. Friday afternoons at 4:00 p.m., the College Office staff invite students to join them for tea and pastries and some informal conversation on just about anything. The Music Society encourages performances by student artists and brings a number of music related events to Forbes each year. Performers have included instrumentalists, singers, chamber groups, the University Chamber Orchestra, the Jazz Ensemble, folk singers, and classical ensembles. Forbes College participates vigorously in the University's program of intramural sports, and has been the residential college champion 11 out of 22 years. Men's, women's, and co-ed teams are formed in many different sports. Forbes finished this past year with a significant lead. The Forbes Film Society (FFS) hosts regular film screenings, discussions, and lectures related to cinema. Members of the Forbes community are encouraged to join the FFS and participate in organizing screening schedules, to work as projectionists, and to share in the pleasure of watching and discussing a good movie in the company of friends. =Facilities= Forbes College facilities include a TV lounge, a large and a small dining room, a multi-purpose room, a seminar room, music practice rooms, a black box theater, an art and ceramics studio, a dance studio, a library, study rooms, a cafe, a multi-media lab, a darkroom, game room, and an organic garden. The Norman Thomas 1905 Library at Forbes College contains a general collection, reference books and periodicals, as well as an extensive science fiction collection. =College Council= The Forbes College Council (FCC) consists of twelve to fifteen representatives of the student body. The Council organizes and coordinates College activities, which include social and cultural events, trips, and films, and makes proposals on the allocation of student activities funds. The weekly meetings are open to any Forbesian. The FCC works hand in hand with the College Office to plan events.

It was managed by The Macerich Company before being sold to Simon Property Group in 2011. The mall features 758,504 sq ft of leasable retail space. As of 2019, Simon no longer owns the mall. Pacific Retail announced ownership of the mall on the company Instagram page on January 24, 2019. The mall serves this ethnically diverse trade area with four department stores (JCPenney, two Macy's stores (the second being Macy's home), and Forever 21) and 160 shops, eateries and restaurants. The mall is located directly adjacent to State Route 60, between the Paramount Boulevard and San Gabriel Boulevard off-ramps. Construction of the mall began in 1980 and was completed in 1985 by Donahue-Schriber. LA Times - $95-Million Montebello Shopping Center to Open The mall opened for business for the 1985 holiday season. A comprehensive remodel was almost totally completed in 2009, in time for the winter holidays. The remainder of the remodel was completed in June 2010 and includes an elegantly styled center court with more \\"high end\\" stores such as Coach fine leathers and Aldo fashion footwear. The mall was again remodeled in 2016. The food court was renovated along with enhanced entryways, landscaping, signage, and outdoor seating.Simon Properties Group Renovation Description The anchor store H&M; was also remodeled.KTGY Architecture + Planning Renovations Description The mall's original anchors were JCPenney, Mervyns and May Company California. May Company became Robinsons-May in 1993. Macy's built a new store and opened as a fourth anchor in 2001. The Robinsons-May store became a Macy's in 2006, with the former Macy's building being remade into a Macy's Home store. Mervyns went out of business in 2008 and became a Forever 21 in 2009.

In contemporary personality psychology, agreeableness is one of the five major dimensions of personality structure, reflecting individual differences in cooperation and social harmony.Graziano, W.G., & Eisenberg, N. (1997). Agreeableness; A dimension of personality. In R. Hogan, S. Briggs, & J. Johnson, (1997). Handbook of Personality Psychology. San Diego, CA: Academic Press. People who score high on this dimension are empathetic and altruistic, while a low agreeableness score relates to selfish behavior and a lack of empathy. Those who score very low on agreeableness show signs of dark triad behavior such as manipulation and competing with others rather than cooperating. Agreeableness is considered to be a superordinate trait, meaning that it is a grouping of personality sub-traits that cluster together statistically. The lower-level traits, or facets, grouped under agreeableness are: trust, straightforwardness, altruism, compliance, modesty, and tender-mindedness.  History  = Cattell's 16 Personality Factors = Agreeable Burden (William-Adolphe Bouguereau, 1895) Like all Big Five personality traits, the roots of the modern concept of agreeableness can be traced to a 1936 study by Gordon Allport and Henry S. Odbert. Seven years later, Raymond Cattell published a cluster analysis of the thousands of personality-related words identified by Allport and Odbert. The clusters identified in this study served as a foundation for Cattell's further attempts to identify fundamental, universal, human personality factors. He eventually settled on 16 personality factors through the use of factor analysis. Further factor analyses revealed five higher-order, or \\"global\\", factors to encompass these 16. Although labelled \\"independence\\" by Cattell, a global factor defined by high scores on the E, H, L, and Q1 factors of the 16PF Questionnaire was an early precursor to the modern concept of agreeableness. = The Big Five = Extent of agreeableness in the five factor model of personality is most commonly assessed through self-report measures, although peer-reports and third-party observation can also be used. Self-report measures are either lexical or based on statements. Which measure of either type is used is determined by an assessment of psychometric properties and the time and space constraints of the research being undertaken. Lexical measures use individual adjectives that reflect agreeableness or disagreeableness traits, such as sympathetic, cooperative, warm, considerate, harsh, unkind, rude. Words representing disagreeableness are reverse coded. Goldberg (1992) developed a 20-word measure as part of his 100-word Big Five markers, and Saucier (1994) developed a briefer 8-word measure as part of his 40-word mini-markers. Thompson (2008) systematically revised and improved these markers to develop a 40-word measure with better psychometric properties in both American and non- American populations, the International English Mini-Markers. This brief measure has good internal consistency reliabilities and other validity for assessing agreeableness and other five factor personality dimensions, both within and, especially, without American populations. Internal consistency reliability of the Agreeableness measure for native English-speakers is reported as .86, that for non-native English-speakers is .80. Statement measures tend to comprise more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked the extent to which they, for example, Am on good terms with nearly everyone, Am not interested in other people's problems or Sympathize with others' feelings. Cattell's factor analytic approach, used to identify the universal personality structures, inspired countless studies in the decades following the introduction of the 16PF. Using Cattell's original clusters, the 16 Personality Factors, and original data, multiple researchers independently developed a five factor model of personality over this period. From the early 1960s on, these explorations typically included a factor called \\"agreeableness\\" or \\"sociability.\\" Despite repeated replications of five stable personality factors following Cattell's pioneering work, this framework only began to dominate personality research in the early 1980s with the work of Lewis Goldberg. Using lexical studies similar to those of Allport and Odbert, Goldberg chose the term \\"Big Five\\" to reflect the sheer number of personality- related terms encompassed by each of these five distinct factors. One of these, agreeableness, was defined by a number of personality-related words similar to those present in earlier and more recent manifestations of the construct; examples include \\"friendly,\\" \\"good-natured,\\" \\"cooperative,\\" \\"trustful,\\" \\"nurturing,\\" \\"sociable,\\" and \\"considerate.\\" = NEO PI = Beginning in the 1970s, Paul Costa and Robert McCrae began researching the development of personality assessments based on factor models. Beginning with cluster analyses of Cattell's 16 Personality Factors, Costa and McCrae initially settled on a three-factor model of personality. These three factors were neuroticism (vs. emotional stability), extraversion (vs. introversion), and openness (vs. closedness) to experience, resulting in the acronym \\"NEO.\\" Due to similarities between their three-factor NEO Personality Inventory and Goldberg's Big Five, Costa and McCrae began to develop scales to assess agreeableness and conscientiousness in the early 1980s. This work culminated in the 1985 publication of the first NEO PI Manual to be based on the full Five Factor Model. Although this marked the introduction of agreeableness to the NEO PI, Costa and McCrae worked for an additional seven years to identify and elaborate on the facets comprising this factor in the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.  NEO PI facets  In the NEO PI, each of the five factors identified by Costa and McCrae are identified with six lower-level traits. Known as facets, the lower-level traits subsumed by agreeableness were first introduced with the 1992 publication of the revised version of the NEO PI. Based on the modern NEO PI-R, the six facets of agreeableness are: Trust, straightforwardness, Altruism, Compliance, Modesty, and Tender-Mindedness. = Trust = Trust is a defining feature of psychosocial development, personality theory, and folk psychological conceptions of personality. Individuals who score high on this facet generally believe others' intentions to be benevolent. Those scoring low on this facet tend to be cynical and view others as suspicious, dishonest, or dangerous. = Straightforwardness = Straightforwardness is the quality of directness and honesty in communicating with others. Despite a long history in moral philosophy, straightforwardness is not as vital to personality theory as the other facets of agreeableness. Those scoring high on straightforwardness tend to interact with others in a direct and honest manner. Low scorers are less direct, tend to be high in self-monitoring, and are generally deceitful or manipulative. Although the two concepts are not identical, those who score low on this facet tend to be high in Machiavellianism. Straightforwardness is similar to a dimension in the Interpersonal circumplex called \\"Ingenuous versus calculating.\\" According to Michael C. Ashton and Kibeom Lee, straightforwardness is similar to the honesty aspect of honesty-humility in the HEXACO Model. = Altruism = Similar to altruism in animals and ethical altruism, this facet is defined by measures of selflessness, self-sacrifice, generosity, and consideration, courtesy, and concern for others. Altruism is similar to Alfred Adler's concept of social interest, which is a tendency to direct one's actions toward the betterment of society. Individuals who score low on Altruism tend to be discourteous, selfish, or greedy, a pattern of behaviors known as \\"self- interest\\" in Adlerian psychology. = Compliance = As a facet of agreeableness, compliance is defined as an individual's typical response to conflict. Those who score high on compliance tend to be meek and mild, and to prefer cooperation or deference as a means of resolving conflict. Low scorers tend to be aggressive, antagonistic, quarrelsome, and vindictive. = Modesty = While trust, straightforwardness, altruism, and compliance all refer to interpersonal or social behaviors, modesty refers to an individual's self- concept. Those who score high on modesty tend to be humble and other-focused, while low scorers tend to be arrogant and self-aggrandizing. Low modesty is otherwise known as conceitedness or Narcissism and, in extreme cases, can manifest as Narcissistic personality disorder. Otherwise known as \\"humility\\" in the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, modesty resembles the humility aspect of Honesty-Humility in the HEXACO Model. = Tender-mindedness = Tender-mindedness is defined as the extent to which an individual's judgments and attitudes are determined by emotion. Coined by William James, this term was also prominent in early versions of the 16PF. Tender-mindedness is primarily defined by sympathy and corresponds to the International Personality Item Pool's \\"sympathy\\" scale. In contrast, \\"tough minded\\" is a trait associated with Psychoticism on the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire.  Equivalents in psychobiological models  Models based on psychobiological theories of personality have each incorporated a factor similar to agreeableness. In Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory the character trait known as cooperativeness is highly similar to and positively correlated with agreeableness. In Zuckerman's alternative five model of personality the trait known as Aggression-hostility is inversely related to agreeableness.  HEXACO Model  To address the absence of measures of Dark triad traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy), Michael Ashton and Kibeom Lee proposed the addition of a sixth factor to the Five Factor Model. Validated with psycholexical studies similar to those used in the development of the Five Factor Model, the HEXACO Model adds Honesty- Humility to five factors resembling those in the NEO PI. Although Honesty- Humility does not directly correspond to any Big Five trait, it is strongly correlated with the Straightforwardness and Modesty facets of Big Five Agreeableness. As both of these facets are only weakly correlated with Big Five Agreeableness, Ashton and Lee suggest dividing NEO PI Agreeableness into two factors similar to those in the HEXACO Model: Honesty-Humility (i.e., Straightforwardness and Modesty) and a redefined Agreeableness (Trust, Altruism, Compliance, and Tender-Mindedness). Reflecting this conception of Honesty-Humility and HEXACO Agreeableness as unique though similar concepts, Ashton and Lee propose that they represent different aspects of reciprocal altruism: fairness (Honesty-Humility) and tolerance (Agreeableness). Despite suggesting this reconceptualization of Agreeableness for the NEO PI, Ashton and Lee do not believe HEXACO Agreeableness is accurately captured by Trust, Altruism, Compliance, and Tender-Mindedness. In addition to accounting for these four facets of Big Five Agreeableness, the HEXACO Model's construction of Agreeableness includes content categorized under Neuroticism in the NEO PI (i.e., temperamentalness and irritability). To reflect the negative emotional content at the low end of HEXACO Agreeableness, this factor is also referred to as \\"Agreeableness (versus Anger).\\" The inclusion of anger in the definition of HEXACO Agreeableness further helps to differentiate this factor from Honesty-Humility. In response to offensive or transgressive actions, individuals who score low on Honesty-Humility tend not to respond immediately. Instead, they defer their response by planning their revenge and waiting for the perfect opportunity to enact it. Although those who score low on HEXACO Agreeableness also employ this premeditated strategy, they also tend to respond immediately with anger. = HEXACO Agreeableness facets = To help capture the numerous distinctions between the Big Five and HEXACO models, Ashton and Lee propose four new facet labels in their conceptualization of Agreeableness: Forgiveness, Gentleness, Flexibility, and Patience. In addition to these four Agreeableness-specific facets, Lee and Ashton have proposed an additional \\"interstitial\\" facet located in a space shared by Agreeableness, Honesty-Humility, and Emotionality: Altruism versus Antagonism. * Forgiveness: A measure of an individual's response to deception or other transgressions. Individuals who score high on this facet tend to regain their trust and re- establish friendly relations by forgiving the offender, while those who score low tend to hold a grudge. Also known as \\"Forgivingness.\\" * Gentleness: A measure of how an individual typically evaluates others. Individuals who score high on this facet tend to avoid being overly judgmental, while those who score low are highly critical and judgmental. * Flexibility: A measure of behaviors related to compromise and cooperation. Individuals who score high on this facet prefer cooperation and compromise as means of resolving disagreement, while those who score low tend to be stubborn, argumentative, and unwilling to accommodate others. * Patience: A measure of one's response to anger and aggravation. Individuals who score high on this facet tend to be able to tolerate very high levels of anger and maintain their composure while expressing anger. Those who score low on Patience have difficulties remaining calm while expressing their anger and tend to have quick tempers, becoming very angry in response to comparatively little provocation. * Altruism versus Antagonism: Although shared between three HEXACO factors, Altruism versus Antagonism is moderately correlated with Agreeableness. This interstitial facet assesses the extent to which an individual is sympathetic, soft-hearted, and helpful, with low-scoring individuals tending toward an antagonistic interpersonal style.  Interpersonal relations  Agreeableness is an asset in situations that require getting along with others. Compared to disagreeable persons, agreeable individuals display a tendency to perceive others in a more positive light. Because agreeable children are more sensitive to the needs and perspectives of others, they are less likely to suffer from social rejection. Specifically, research indicates that children who are less disruptive, less aggressive, and more skilled at entering play groups are more likely to gain acceptance by their peers.Bierman, K. L. (2003). Peer rejection: Developmental processes and intervention strategies. New York: The Guilford Press. One study found that people high in agreeableness are more emotionally responsive in social situations. This effect was measured on both self-report questionnaires and physiological measures, and offers evidence that extraversion and neuroticism are not the only Big Five personality factors that influence emotion. The effect was especially pronounced among women. Research also shows that people high in agreeableness are more likely to control negative emotions like anger in conflict situations. Those who are high in agreeableness are more likely to use conflict-avoidant tactics when in conflict with others (whereas people low in agreeableness are more likely to use coercive tactics). They are also more willing to give ground to their adversary and may lose arguments with people who are less agreeable. From their perspective, they have not really lost an argument as much as maintained a congenial relationship with another person.  Prosocial behaviour  A central feature of agreeableness is its positive association with altruism and helping behaviour. Across situations, people who are high in agreeableness are more likely to report an interest and involvement with helping others. Experiments have shown that most people are likely to help their own kin, and help when empathy has been aroused. Agreeable people are likely to help even when these conditions are not present.Graziano, W. G., Habashi, M. M., Sheese, B.E., & Tobin, R. M. (2007). Agreeableness, empathy, and helping: A person X situation perspective. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. In other words, agreeable people appear to be \\"traited for helping\\" and do not need any other motivations. While agreeable individuals are habitually likely to help others, disagreeable people may be more likely to cause harm. Researchers have found that low levels of agreeableness are associated with hostile thoughts and aggression in adolescents, as well as poor social adjustment. People low in agreeableness are also more likely to be prejudiced against stigmatized groups such as the overweight. When mental illness is present, low agreeableness may be associated with narcissistic and anti-social tendencies.Costa, P. T. & McCrae, R. R. (1992). NEO personality Inventory professional manual. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources. In theory, individuals who are extremely high in agreeableness are at risk for problems of dependency. Empirical studies show that many more problems are associated with low agreeableness. However, high agreeableness does not always lead to prosocial behaviour, in a Milgram experiment conscientious and agreeable people, when forced by ill-intent authority, are more willing to administer high-intensity electric shocks to a victim, because conscientious and agreeable people are less capable of resistance.  From childhood to adulthood  Agreeableness is of fundamental importance to psychological well-being, predicting mental health, positive affect, and good relations with others. In both childhood and adolescence agreeableness has been tied to externalizing issues. Along with this it has also been implicated in outcomes to conflict management skills, school adjustment, peer-social status and self-esteem. Some work has been done looking into whether agreeableness levels through childhood have effects on adjustment and agreeableness into adulthood. Among young adults, individuals that have been diagnosed with either externalizing as well as internalizing disorders present lower levels of agreeableness and communion, and higher levels of negative emotionality, than those young adults without such disorders. Agreeableness also is reported to mediate links between anger and depression in young adults. Among college students, agreeableness is often associated with self-reports of emotional experience and control along with psycho-physiological responses to affectively charged stimuli. Across adulthood, low agreeableness has been found to be a health risk. High agreeableness, especially trust and honesty, has been linked to longevity. A study done by Caspi, Elder, and Bem (1987) found that explosive and ill- tempered children were found to have higher rates of divorce as adults when compared with their even-tempered peers. Further, ill-tempered men had lower educational attainment, occupational status, and work stability, and ill- tempered women married men with similar low achievement profiles A second and more recent study by Shiner (2000) found that composite variables describing middle-childhood agreeableness and friendly compliance predicted adolescent academic performance, behavioral conduct, and social competence 10 years later Most recent is a study done by Larsen, Pulkkinen, and Adams (2002) in which they looked at many different levels of childhood behavior and emotion and the correlation into adulthood agreeableness. In their first analyses, structure coefficients showed that childhood compliance, aggression, and self-control, discriminated high-agreeableness from low-agreeableness in adults better than did activity versus passivity, constructiveness, and anxiety. In their second analyses, structure coefficients indicated that adulthood socialization and impulsivity discriminated high-agreeableness from low-agreeableness in adults better than did inhibition of aggression and anxiety. In linking childhood behavioral profiles to adulthood personality profiles, high-compliant, high- self-control, and low-aggressive children were most likely to become high- agreeable, high-socialized, and low-impulsive adults. These children were more unlikely to become low-agreeable, low-socialized, and high-impulsive adults. Further, low-compliant, low-self-control, and high-aggressive children were likely to become low-agreeable, low-socialized, and high-impulsive adults and these children were unlikely to become high-agreeable, high-socialized, and low-impulsive adults. In addition to this, children classified as low- compliance, low-self-control, low-aggression types and children classified as high-compliance, high-self-control, low-aggression types had a greater probability of becoming adults with high-agreeableness, high-socialization, high-impulsivity profiles. Looking at stability of agreeableness they found results that indicated that stable low agreeable individuals reported less career stability and more depression when compared with stable high agreeable individuals and low to high agreeable individuals. Further, stable high agreeable individuals reported lower levels of alcoholism than did the other groups and fewer arrests than did stable low agreeable individuals.  Geography  =United States= Agreeableness by state. Lighter regions have lower average agreeableness. In the United States, people in the West, Midwest, and South tend to have higher average scores on agreeableness than people living in other regions. According to researchers, the top ten most agreeable states are North Dakota, Minnesota, Mississippi, Utah, Wisconsin, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. Original research article: These findings are consistent with well-known expressions in these states, such as \\"southern hospitality\\" and \\"Minnesota nice.\\" Because these states are generally less urbanized than the east and west coasts, people may be more likely to live in small communities and know their neighbors. Consequently, they may be more willing to care about and help their neighbours. In a study done by Albright et al. (1997) groups of college students from China and the United States rated strangers from both countries on the \\"Big Five\\" personality traits, external traits, and how well they were dressed. They found that both Chinese and U.S. students rated faces as showing similar levels of agreeableness and extroversion. The people who were thought to be the most agreeable wore smiles, a facial expression that is recognized around the world. The findings of the research seem to suggest that the trait of agreeableness is attributed to people in a universal way.

The electrical output of the generator will vary depending on its orientation with respect to the Earth's magnetic field. This variation in the generated voltage is measured, allowing the Earth inductor compass to determine direction. History The earth inductor compass was first patented by Donald M. Bliss in 1912 and further refined in the 1920s by Paul R. Heyl and Lyman James Briggs of the United States National Bureau of Standards, and in 1924 by Morris Titterington at the Pioneer Instrument Company in Brooklyn, New York. Heyl and Briggs were awarded the Magellan Medal of the American Philosophical Society for this work in 1922. Designed to compensate for the weaknesses of the magnetic compass, the Earth inductor compass provided pilots with a more stable and reliable reference instrument. They were used in the Douglas World Cruisers in 1924 during the Around-the-World flight by the U.S. Army Air Corps. Charles Lindbergh used the compass on his transatlantic flight in the Spirit of St. Louis in 1927. Over the transatlantic leg of his voyage - a distance of about - he was able to navigate with a cumulative error of about in landfall, or about one half of one percent of the distance travelled, by computing his heading at hourly intervals for a dead reckoning estimate of position. Operation Bliss' original design consisted of two armatures spinning on a single vertical axle. One armature was connected to commutators that were 90 degrees offset from the commutators connected to the other armature. When one set of commutators is aligned with the earth's magnetic field no current is produced, but an offset angle creates a positive or negative current in proportion to the sine of the offset angle. Since the sine of the angle peaks at 90 degrees, a reading could indicate either a certain direction or the exact opposite direction. The solution to this was a second armature with commutators offset by 90 degrees to help distinguish the two opposite directions. The direction of travel was read by comparing the indications on two independent galvanometers, one for each armature. The galvanometers had to be calibrated with the correct headings, since the voltage was proportional to the sine of the angle. Readings could be impacted by the armature's speed of rotation and by stray magnetic fields. Later versions simplified readings to show the offset from the intended heading, rather than the full range of compass directions. The revised design allowed the user to rotate the commutators in such a way that zero current would be produced when the craft was traveling in the intended direction. A single galvanometer was then used to show if the pilot was steering too far to the left or to the right. Lindberg's compass used an anemometer to spin the armature through a universal joint. The armature was mounted on gimbals to prevent it from tilting with the airplane's pitch and roll. Tilting the armature could have changed the angle of the Earth's flux to the armature, resulting in erroneous readings. The gyroscopic effect of the spinning armature also helped to keep it properly aligned.

Bluepharma became FDA approved since 2009 for the development of solid pharmaceutical forms, \\"becoming the first Portuguese pharmaceutical company to export to the US market.\\" History Bluepharma's production plant was acquired from Bayer AG when, at the end of the 1990s, the German multinational company made a business decision to consolidate production at its headquarters in Germany. Bayer announced plans to sell the Coimbra manufacturing site by advertising in an international magazine. Paulo Barradas Rebelo, who had gained management and business skills and experience in logistics from a background as Chief Executive Officer of a major wholesaler and distribution company to about 500 pharmacy units within a co-operative, read about the planned sale. He contacted S√©rgio Sim√µes, who worked in research locally as a professor at the University of Coimbra. The two men, with Isolina Mesquita who was plant manager for Bayer's Coimbra site, decided they would set up a new company, Bluepharma, with the aim of acquiring the Bayer plant and developing it as an integrated contract manufacturing business. The new company took the responsibility for all former Bayer employees, so the German work culture is still present in Bluepharma. Its buildings occupy about 14,000 square meters at several levels on a land area of 18,700 square meters. The buildings have had several improvements, the most significant being in 1989, when the site was still owned by Bayer, and in 1998. During the first half of the 2000s, the company built a laboratory between the two main buildings to do more research and development work. Business Bluepharma develops its activity on the following areas: *Contract-manufacturing *Biopharmaceuticals *R&D; *Commerce of generics in Portugal Bluepharma has clients in Portugal, France, Germany and in the UK, among others. One of Bluepharma's main clients is Bayer to which the Portuguese company produced around 3.5 million units in 2004. Other clients include pharmaceuticals brands and companies such as Teva, Ivax, Arrow, EG LABO (Stada), Bexal (Hexal), Mepha (Ratiopharm) and Ciclum (Gr√ºnenthal). Most Bluepharma's employees have academic degrees and many have post-graduate degrees (MSc and PhDs) as well. Research & Development In the R&D; area, Bluepharma has research projects in the biotechnology field and is developing generic.

He is a young boy and member of Fagin's gang of pickpockets, and sidekick to the Artful Dodger, whose skills he admires unreservedly. Sikes's murder of Nancy shocks him so much that at the end of the novel he leaves London to become an agricultural labourer. In the novel Charley, along with the Artful Dodger, steal Mr. Brownlow's handkerchief, a crime Oliver is blamed for. Later in the novel, Bates delivers bad news to Fagin that when the Artful Dodger was arrested for stealing a silver snuff box and positively identified by the owner, such that it is a sure bet he will be convicted in court. Charley believes that it is too bad he did not go out in a blaze of glory by stealing something of great value instead of a \\"common twopenny- halfpenny\\" snuffbox. Fagin tells him that the Dodger's glory will be in the memory of his comrades: \\"wasn't he always top-sawyer among you all?\\". But Charley is distressed that the Dodger's greatness will not be preserved for posterity in the official record, At the end of the novel, Charley is horrified by Bill Sikes' violent murder of Nancy. When Sikes approaches him, he starts yelling, revealing Sikes's location to the mob who want to lynch him. He is the only member of Fagin's gang to reform. In the final chapter Dickens states that Charley left London to work as a farm hand, later becoming a shepherd: \\"Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes's crime, fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best. Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action. He struggled hard and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer's drudge, and a carrier's lad, he is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.\\"Dickens, C., Oliver Twist, Chapter LIII. Media illustration captioned: \\"Master Bates explains a professional technicality\\" The character of Charley Bates has a much smaller role in the musical Oliver!, and is eliminated entirely from some other adaptations, including the 1997 adaptation and the 2007 miniseries. One adaptation in which his role is almost as significant as in the novel is Roman Polanski's 2005 adaptation. His role is also fairly prominent in the 1948 David Lean film. Tito the chihuahua in Disney's 1988 animated film Oliver and Company is entirely based on Charley. Critical commentary Charley is regularly referred to as \\"Master Bates\\". Whether this is an intentional pun on \\"masturbates\\" is disputed. The word existed at the time, derived from the Latin verb masturbari, but it was relatively obscure, and it is not recorded as a verb until 1857, 19 years after the novel was published. Edward Le Comte considered it to be a Freudian slip.Edward Le Comte, afterword, Oliver Twist, by Charles Dickens, New York: Signet, 1961, p.483 John Sutherland considered it to be too puerile, a \\"schoolboy joke\\", to be intentional, since Dickens's use of names is generally much more sophisticated.John Sutherland, The Literary Detective:100 Puzzles in Classic Fiction, Publisher: Oxford University Press, 2000, p.611. Like Nancy, Charley represents the idea that redemption is possible for even the most degraded characters. Lord Acton considered the portrayal of Charley and Nancy to indicate that Oliver Twist was a much more profound work than Dickens's earlier novel The Pickwick Papers. He wrote that \\"Nancy's refusal to be delivered from Sikes after her love for the child had brought her a chance of redemption and Charley Bates turning against the murderer are surely in a higher style than anything in Pickwick\\".The Correspondence of Lord Acton and Richard Simpson, Volume 2, CUP Archive, 1973, p.218. It was Dickens's friend John Forster who persuaded him to show Charley finally escaping a life of crime.Davis, James A., John Forster, a Literary Life, Rowman & Littlefield, 1983, p.169.

M. S. Richards, was a well-known Seventh-day Adventist evangelist and author. Born in Iowa, he is most famous for founding the Voice of Prophecy radio ministry and was a pioneer in religious radio broadcasting. His ministry inspired broadcasts in 36 languages on more than 1,100 stations, and Bible courses in 80 languages offered by 144 correspondence schools. Early life Richards began his ministry as a tent preacher when he was 17. His brother worked as a driver for then Senator Warren G. Harding. Harding invited him to see a demonstration of the newly invented radio. Richards came to view radio as a way to bring the Gospel to nations. He came to California during the Great Depression and made radio broadcasts starting in 1929, when he gave a 15-minute guest sermon on KNX in Los Angeles. He noted that every six days 1,000,000 more people come into the world. He viewed the radio as a way of keeping up with these new additions to the human race. Richards married Mabel Annabel Eastman in 1920, and they had 1 daughter and 3 sons. He died in 1985 at the age of 90. In 1940, Richards ran on a very limited budget. By contrast, in 1980, he had a $6 million budget and a staff of researchers to help him avoid early foibles. Radio broadcasting Upon graduation from Washington Missionary College (now Washington Adventist University) in 1919, H.M.S. Richards served as an evangelist in various places in the United States and Canada and during this period experimented with radio announcements in connection with his meetings. He began regular radio broadcasts on October 19, 1929 on KNX (AM) in Los Angeles. Later Richards presented daily live broadcasts of The Tabernacle of the Air over KGER in Long Beach, and live weekly remote broadcasts from his tabernacle to KMPC (AM) in Beverly Hills. In his presentations he taught history. \\"Bible prophecy is not given so we can see what will happen, but so we can see what already happened, and get confirmation that the Bible is true. If it came true historically, then when Jesus gives his wonderful teachings, we ought to believe that, too,\\" he noted. In January 1937 his radio footprint expanded over a network of several stations of the Don Lee Broadcasting System, and the name of the broadcast was changed to the Voice of Prophecy. His first coast-to-coast broadcast over 89 stations of the Mutual Broadcasting System was on Sunday, January 4, 1942. Throughout the years Richards' Voice of Prophecy broadcasts were marked by an opening theme song of \\"Lift Up the Trumpet\\" performed by the King's Heralds quartet and closed with his poem \\"Have Faith in God\\" each week having a new verse written. As an author In addition to published sermons and booklets, Richards authored the following books: *The Indispensable Man *The Promises of God *What Jesus Said *Feed My Sheep *Look to the Stars *Why I Am a Seventh-day Adventist *One World *Revival Sermons *Day After Tomorrow Awards and biographies *Awarded the Honor Citation by the National Religious Broadcasters in 1967 and 1970. *Honorary doctorate conferred by Andrews University in 1960. *Washington Adventist University's faculty of religion building \\"HMS Richards Hall\\" on Flower Ave, Takoma Park, MD is named in his honor *La Sierra University renamed its School of Religion the \\"H.M.S.

Collar tabs sign the military rank (group of ranks), the rank of civil service, the military unit, the office (department) or the branch of the armed forces and the arm of service. History Gorget patches were originally gorgets, pieces of armour worn to protect the throat. With the disuse of armour they were lost. The cloth patch on the collar however evolved from contrasting cloth used to reinforce the buttonholes at the collar of a uniform coat. (This is perhaps most evident in the traditional Commonwealth design for Colonels, which has a button and a narrow line of darker piping where the slit buttonhole would have been.) In the British Empire the patches were introduced as insignia during the South African War (1889-1902). They have been used ever since in many counties of the Commonwealth of Nations. The collar patches of the most of the armed forces of the Middle East and Arab derive from the uniform tradition of the European empires that dominated the region until World War II, and especially Britain and France. Countries =Afghanistan= Afghan army has collar patches similar to Commonwealth ones. =Austria= In Austria collar patches of the Federal Army report the rank and the arm of service. They are also used in the police. Traditional, corps colours () dominate the basic colours of the rank insignia. In the Austro- Hungarian Army (k.u.k. Army), collar patches with rank insignia, appliqu√©d on the gorget of uniform coat, or jacket and the battle-dress blouse, were designated Paroli. :See also: *Waffenfarbe (Austria) *Rank insignia of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces The galleries below show examples of Parolis Patrouillef√ºhrer der k.k.

Eisenbahn-Regiment.png Major Paroli with special badge of the k.u.k. railway regiment Oberst M16 gg.pngOberst, Paroli with dark-red, vertical stripe 1916 =Australia= In Australia traditional gorget patches are worn by army colonels and general officers as well as by navy midshipmen. In the St John Ambulance Australia First Aid Services Branch, gorget patches designate State Staff Officers and National Staff Officers from those who are officers of a division or region. =Bangladesh= In the Bangladesh Armed Forces officers of the rank of colonel equivalent and above wear ‚ÄòGorget Patches‚Äô. They are respectively red, sky blue & black in color. For colonel and equivalent ranks \\"Shapla\\" insignia is displayed. Each higher flag rank level above colonel has an additional star added. =Belgium= In the Belgian army, the gorget patches have a branch color and rank insignia. =Brazil= In the Brazilian Army the gorget patches, embroined oak leafs in silver, are worn on the both lapels of rifle green and grey formal dress uniforms by generals. The same insignia, in gold, is worn on both collars of gala full-dress uniforms. In the State of S√£o Paulo Military Police, commanding officers of the rank of colonel wear, on both lapels of their dark-grey formal uniforms, embroidered silver insignia. This consists of an armillary sphere, surrounded with laurels and with a star on top. =Bulgaria= Gorget patches in the Bulgarian Army show to which branch the wearer belongs to. =Canada= With the restoration of historical nomenclature and features to the Canadian Army in 2013reinstated insignia included traditional gorget patches for colonels and general officers. For combat branches these are in scarlet with gold embroidery for generals. However the gorget patches worn by senior officers of the Medical Branch are dull cherry, the Dental Branch emerald green and the Chaplain Branch purple. =China= In People's Liberation Army of People's Republic of China gorget patches are used to denote a military rank. =France= France artilleryman's uniform, 1916 In the French Army collar patches were used on tunics and greatcoats from the early nineteenth century onwards. Usually in contrasting collars to the collar itself, they came to carry a regimental number or specialist insignia. With the adoption of a new light-beige dress uniform for all ranks in the 1980s, the practice of wearing coloured collar patches was discontinued. =Germany= Arabesques of a German Wehrmacht Generals Collar patches/gorget patches (de: Kragenspiegel, also Kragenpatte[n] or Arabesque[n]), are to be worn on the gorget (on both collar points) of military uniform in German speaking armed forces. However, collar patch insignia for General officers of the Heer (Army) are traditional called Arabesque collar patch, also Larish embroidery, Old Prussian embroidery, or Arabesquen embroidery (de: \\"Arabesken-Kragenspiegel\\", also \\"Larisch- Stickerei\\", \\"Altpreu√üische Stickerei\\" or \\"Arabeskenstickerei\\").Dictionary to the German military history, 1st edition (Liz.5, P189/84, LSV:0547, B-Nr. 746 635 0), military publishing house of the GDR (VEB) ‚Äì Berlin, 1985, Volume 1, page 396, definition: ‚ÄûVersions of collar patches‚Äú. In the German Empire, generals, some officers, guardsmen and seamen wore Kragenspiegel, but these were not part of the service-wide uniform. In the Weimar Republic such patches (or Litzen) were introduced throughout the army in 1921, where they indicated the rank and the arm of service, but were not used in the navy. The Wehrmacht continued this. Some Nazi-era civil services (e.g., police and railways) wore uniforms with collar tabs, similar to the armed forces' tabs. New tabs were also introduced for the political leaders of the NSDAP, for the new Nazi organisations as Sturmabteilung and Schutzstaffel. East Germany used similar collar tabs to those of the Wehrmacht for its army and air force. Collar tabs were also worn by some personnel of the navy. The armed forces of the Federal Republic of Germany also maintained the use of collar tabs in the army and the air force, where they indicate to which branch (or Truppengattung) an individual soldier belongs. Members of the German Navy do not wear collar tabs. =Greece= In the Hellenic Army, the use of gorget/collar patches (ŒµœÄŒπœÅœÅŒ¨ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒ±) was introduced for the undress and field uniforms, via Austrian and French influences, at the turn of the 20th century. They consist of a distinctive background colour or combination of colours, that denote a specific arm of service or corps; officers also feature a metal device with the arms/corps emblem, while other ranks and non-professional NCOs don't. General officers use a British-style general officer' patch. Collar patches are also used by the Hellenic Police (and formerly by the Greek Gendarmerie and the Cities Police) and the Hellenic Fire Service. =Egypt= In Egypt red collar patches symbolize the highest ranks of officers. =Hong Kong= Senior officers, especially the commanding officer of each disciplinary unit in Hong Kong use gorget patches in their formal uniforms: * Hong Kong Police * Hong Kong Fire Services * Hong Kong Correctional Services * Customs and Excise * Hong Kong Immigration * Government Flying Service (Hong Kong) The various services inherited their used as Hong Kong was a former British colony. =Indonesia= In Indonesia, gorget patches are currently worn by members of the Indonesian National Police. Officially, it is called a \\"monogram\\". It consists of cotton and rice embroidery (or sometimes metal made) on a dark brown background. However, general officers and cadets of the National Police Academy wear the red background one. Gorget patches were worn by Police members since their separation from the Indonesian National Armed Forces in 1999. Example of the monogram can be found here: https://abufariq.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/b2277-monogram-padi-kapas2.jpg =India= In India, coloured gorget patches are used by senior-ranking Armed Forces officers of selection-grade rank (colonels, naval captains and group captains) and above. Full colonels in the Indian Army wear crimson patches with golden braid to signify their commanding officer rank. Captains in the Indian Navy wear twin silver oakleaves set perpendicular to each other and mounted on golden patches, while Indian Air Force group captains wear the same insignia on blue patches. Officers in the Indian Armed Forces of one-star through five-star rank wear a corresponding number of stars in gold (Indian Army) or silver (Indian Navy and Indian Air Force) on scarlet (Indian Army), gold (Indian Navy) or blue (Indian Air Force) collar patches. In addition, officers of three-star rank and above who hold command positions (army, naval or air force) wear an oak leaf wreath on each gorget patch. Only the Chief of Defence Staff and the three armed force chiefs hold four-star rank and only a field marshal or a marshal of the air force wears five stars. Till date, Sam Manekshaw and Kodandera Madappa Cariappa are the only two officers who have been appointed to the rank of Field Marshal, while Arjan Singh has been appointed to the rank of Marshal of the Indian Air Force. If the Indian Navy rank of Admiral of the Fleet is ever created, the holder would presumably wear five silver stars on a gold patch. Senior commandants and deputy inspector- generals (below four years service) in the paramilitary Indian Coast Guard, who rank with Indian Navy captains, wear a similar insignia of twin golden oakleaves set perpendicularly to each other and mounted on navy-coloured patches. Coast Guard officers of one-star through three-star rank wear a corresponding number of gold stars on their patches.All senior ranking police officers of the Rank of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) or Senior Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) (both ranks being equivalent with Deputy Commissioner's are only in towns which has moved over to a commissioner system of policing this rank being equivalent to a full colonel in the Army) get a dark blue patch with a silver lining. This remains the same for the next higher rank of Deputy Inspector General (DIG) or Additional Commissioner of Police (Addl. CP). However, the next senior officer, The Inspector General (IG) or Joint Commissioner of Police (JCP) has a silver design of a long leaf rather than a simple silver lining on their patch. This remains the same for the ranks of Commissioner of Police and the Director General of Police (DGP). =Iran= In Iran black collar patches symbolize the highest ranks of officers. =Ireland= In the Irish Defence Forces, officers of Brigadier- general rank and above wear red and gold gorget patches. =Italy= Since the late nineteenth century the Italian Army has made extensive use of coloured collar patches to distinguish branches of service such as the artillery, infantry brigades and individual cavalry regiments. In 1902 each line infantry brigade (comprising two regiments) was distinguished by large collar patches of a distinctive colour or combination of colours. The universal silver \\"active service\\" star was attached at the front of each patch. There are also distinctive collar patches for the San Marco Regiment (Navy), the Guardia di Finanza, the Carabinieri and the civilian police corps. =Jordan= In Jordan red collar patches symbolize the highest ranks of officers. =Korea= In North Korea gorget patches are used to denote a military rank. =Nepal= In Nepal gorget patches of the Nepalese Army, Nepal Police and Armed Police Force Nepal are worn by general officers and senior officers. =New Zealand= The New Zealand Defence Force has collar patches for senior officers on the Commonwealth model. =Oman= In Oman black collar patches distinguish the most senior ranks of officers. =Pakistan= In Pakistan, collar patches are worn by senior officers and staff officers on the basis of their rank. A collar patch signifies that an officer is either a staff officer (Colonel) or a General Officer (Brigadier or above). When wearing non-combat standard uniform or service dress, Staff Officers (Colonel) in the Pakistan Army wear collar patches of crimson color with straight golden stripes and General officers (Brigadier and above) wear collar patches of crimson color with golden braid. When wearing combat uniform (CCD), the collar patches of junior officers (Lieutenant colonel and below) carry the insignia of serving arms. Staff officers (Colonel) have no collar patch and General officers (Brigadier and above) wear the corresponding stars that their rank carries on the collar. =Romania= Historically coloured gorget patches of a distinctive \\"arrow head\\" pattern were used in the Romanian army to distinguish regiments and branches. They survive to a limited extent in the collar braiding of modern ceremonial uniforms. =Russia= In the Russian Empire collar patches of red, blue, white and green distinguished each infantry regiment within a given division. Cavalry and other branches had a variety of collar patches. In the USSR in 1924-1943 they served as the primary insignia of military ranks. The rank system changed several times, and collar patches were different in 1924‚Äì1935, 1935‚Äì1940 and 1940‚Äì1943 systems. When the shoulder straps were restored in 1943, collar tabs remained as an insignia of the branch and the arm of service. Since 1932 they were also used as an insignia in some civil services. The state of affairs is the same in the modern Russian Federation. =Somalia= In Somalia, only officers above the rank of Second Lieutenant (or Ensign) wear gorget patches, the Army wears red patches, the Navy wear black patches, the Air Force wear navy blue patches, the Police wear royal blue patches and the Custodial Corps wear green patches. Upon reaching the rank of Brigadier General or Commodore Admiral, the patches then will have a golden ornate pattern on them. =Sri Lanka= In the Sri Lanka, general officers or senior officers of the Sri Lanka Army wear gorget patches according to their rank gold-on-red, while in the air force similar officer wear gorget patches of white-on-blue. Senior gazetted officers in the police ranks wear gorget patches of gold-on-black and silver-on-black. Officer cadets in the Army, Navy and the Royal Air Force also wear patches. The Sri Lanka Army followed the British Army pattern for the gorget patches of its general officer and senior officers. In the late 2000s, the practice was changed by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, who adopted the Indian Army pattern, with golden stars on the red gorget patches denoting rank. This practice has been used in the No. 4 and No. 4A uniforms. =Sweden= In Swedish Army gorget patches on the combat uniform denote a branch of service and rank. =Switzerland= In the Swiss army collar patches denote the rank and the arm of service. =Syria= In Syria red collar patches symbolize the highest ranks of officers. =Ukraine= In the Soviet Ukraine colored collar patches (though without gorgets) were used, as in other parts of the USSR. Historically Ukrainian national units during the period 1918-1920 and again 1941-45 wore collar patches resembling the gorget patches of other armies. These included the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen, the Ukrainian People's Army, the Sich Riflemen,and the Ukrainian Galician Army. =United Kingdom= Bernard Montgomery wearing scarlet collar patches on his battledress tunic In the United Kingdom, general officers or senior staff officers of the British Army wear gorget patches according to their branch or arm of service; their counterpart police ranks wear similar gorget patches of silver-on-black (gold- on-black in the City of London Police). Officer cadets in the Merchant Navy, Army and the Royal Air Force also wear patches. Introduced for British Army staff officers in India in 1887, the patches subsequently proliferated. Different colours were introduced to indicate the branch of service and by 1940 one finds: * bright blue (engineers) * dark blue (ordnance) * pale blue (education) * scarlet (general staff duties) * cherry (medical) * maroon (veterinary) * purple (chaplains) * green (dental) * yellow (accountants) During World War I all staff officers from second lieutenants upwards wore gorget patches and hatbands of these colours, making them conspicuous in the trenches and leading to the nickname of \\"the gilded staff\\".Major R. M. Barnes, page 278 \\"A History of the Regiments & Uniforms of the British Army\\", Sphere Books 1972 From 1921 coloured collar patches were restricted to full colonels on the staff and above.In more recent times senior chaplains, dental and medical officers wear gorget patches of the colours described above, while all other colonels and above wear gold on scarlet (as they as are described as being on the General Staff).

It originated from algae (there is debate as to whether this was a green or red alga) through secondary endosymbiosis. The apicoplast is surrounded by four membranes within the outermost part of the endomembrane system. The apicoplast hosts important metabolic pathways like fatty acid synthesis, isoprenoid precursor synthesis and parts of the heme biosynthetic pathway Significance Apicoplasts are a relict, nonphotosynthetic plastid found in most protozoan parasites belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa. Among the most infamous Apicomplexan parasites is Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of severe malaria. Because apicoplasts are vital to parasite survival, they provide an enticing target for antimalarial drugs. Specifically, apicoplasts' plant-like properties provide a target for herbicidal drugs. And, with the emergence of malarial strains resistant to current treatments it is paramount that novel therapies, like herbicides, are explored and understood. Furthermore, herbicides may be able to specifically target the parasite's plant-like apicoplast and without any noticeable effect on the mammalian host's cells. Evolutionary origin Evidence suggests that the apicoplast is a product of secondary endosymbiosis, and that the apicoplast may be homologous to the secondary plastid of the closely related dinoflagellate algae. An ancient cyanobacterium was first engulfed by a eukaryotic cell but was not digested. The bacterium escaped being digested because it formed a symbiotic relationship with the host eukaryotic cell; both the eukaryote and the bacterium mutually benefited from their novel shared existence. The result of the primary endosymbiosis was a photosynthetic eukaryotic alga. A descendant of this eukaryotic alga was then itself engulfed by a heterotrophic eukaryote with which it formed its own symbiotic relationship and was preserved as a plastid. The apicoplast evolved in its new role to preserve only those functions and genes necessary to beneficially contribute to the host-organelle relationship. The ancestral genome of more than 150 kb was reduced through deletions and rearrangements to its present 35 kb size. During the reorganization of the plastid the apicoplast lost its ability to photosynthesize. These losses of function are hypothesized to have occurred at an early evolutionary stage in order to have allowed sufficient time for the complete degradation of acknowledged photosynthetic relicts and the disappearance of a nucleomorph. Architecture and distribution Most Apicomplexa contain a single ovoid shaped apicoplast that is found at the anterior of the invading parasitic cell. The apicoplast is situated in close proximity to the cell's nucleus and often closely associated with a mitochondrion. The small plastid, only 0.15-1.5 Œºm in diameter, is surrounded by four membranes. The two inner membranes are derived from the algal plastid membranes; the next membrane out is called the periplastid membrane and is derived from the algal plasma membrane; Finally the outermost membrane belongs to the host endomembrane system. Within the apicoplast's stroma is a 35 kb long circular DNA strand that codes for approximately 30 proteins, tRNAs and some RNAs. Particles suspected to be bacterial ribosomes are present. The plastid, at least in the Plasmodium species, also contains \\"tubular whorls\\" of membrane that bear a striking resemblance to the thylakoids of their chloroplast relatives. The import of proteins into the apicoplast through the four membranes occurs through translocation complexes that originate from the algal plastid (for example: ) or from a duplication of the Endoplasmic- reticulum-associated protein degradation (for example: ).  Function  The apicoplast is a vital organelle to the parasite's survival. Tetracycline, an antibiotic also used to combat malaria infections, is thought to function by targeting the apicoplast. It hosts four main metabolic pathways: =Fatty Acid Synthesis= The destruction of the apicoplast does not immediately kill the parasite but instead prevents it from invading new host cells. This observation suggests that the apicoplast may be involved in lipid metabolism. If unable to synthesize sufficient fatty acids the parasite is unable to form the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that is imperative to a successful invasion of host cells. This conclusion is supported by the discovery of Type II Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) machinery in the apicoplast. =Isoprenoid Synthesis= The apicoplast is also thought to have a role in isoprenoid synthesis, which are prosthetic groups on many enzymes and also act as precursors to ubiquinones (involved in electron transport) and dolichols (involved in glycoprotein formation). The apicoplast contains the MEP pathway for isoprenoid precursor synthesis and is the sole site for such synthesis in the Plasmodium cell. =Heme synthesis= The apicoplast has also been implicated with heme synthesis and amino acid synthesis. It is also suggested to have a role in cell development. These functions, however, are merely postulations and are not yet conclusively supported by experimentation. =Iron-sulphur cluster synthesis= Various iron-sulphur cluster biosynthetic enzymes including SufB or Orf470 have been identified in the apicoplast genome.

The dish was described as early as the 13th century by al-Baghdadi as luqmat al-qƒÅdi (), \\"judge's morsels.\\"Charles Perry, A Baghdad Cookery Book, 2006. . Etymology The Arabic word () (plural ), means morsel, mouthful, or bite. The dish was known as luqmat al-qƒÅdi () or \\"judge's morsels\\" in 13th century Arabic cookery books, and the word luqma or loqma by itself has come to refer to it. The Turkish name for the dish, , is derived from the Arabic, as is the Greek and Cypriot name loukoum√°des.  History  The recipe for Luqmat al-Qadi, yeast- leavened dough boiled in oil and doused in honey or sugar syrup with rosewater, dates back to at least the early medieval period and the 13th- century Abbasid Caliphate, where it is mentioned in several of the existent cookery books of the time. It is also mentioned in the One Thousand and One Nights, in the story The Porter and the Three Ladies of Baghdad. The explorer and scholar Ibn Battuta in the 14th century encountered the dish he knew as Luqaymat al-Qadi at a dinner in Multan, during his travels in medieval India, where his hosts called it al-Hashimi. It was cooked by palace cooks in the Ottoman Empire for centuries and influenced by other countries cuisines of the former countries of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, Middle East and the Caucasus. Regional varieties =Arab countries= Today, in Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, luqaymat, sometimes spiced with cardomom or saffron, are little changed from the 13th-century recipes. In parts of the Middle East they may also be called ' () meaning \\"swimmer\\", or ' (), with numerous spelling variations, though the latter term may also refer to a similar dish made in a long spiral or straight baton shape. They are traditionally included in times of religious observances; for example in the Levant by Muslims at Ramadan, Jews at Hanukkah, and Christians at Epiphany alike. =Greece and Cyprus= In Greece and Cyprus, they are called loukoum√°des () and lokm√°des () in Cypriot Greek. Loukoumas can be used for a singular piece of loukoum√°des such as \\"\\" which translates to \\"Bring me a loukouma\\". They are commonly spiced with cinnamon in a honey syrup and can be sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar. They are also called zvingoi () by the Greek Jews, who make them as Hanukkah treats.Canadian Embassy in Greece, The Jewish Musueum of Greece, The City of Ioannina and the Jewish Community of Ioannina, Ioannina Jewish Legacy Project, ¬´ŒßŒ¨ŒΩŒøœÖŒ∫Œ±¬ª, accessed 30 June 2015 The term, from the Arabic for \\"sponge\\", was likely originally the name of an older Byzantine pastry, and was later used by the Romaniotes as the name for loukoumas. =Turkey= Boortsog, called pi≈üi or tuzlu lokma (salty lokma) in Turkish, which is lokma without any sweet syrup or honey, is a staple food for Turkic and Mongolian cuisines. Lokma in the form of a dessert is made with flour, sugar, yeast and salt, fried in oil and later bathed in syrup or honey. While in the former Ottoman countries such as Iraq and Greece it is an ordinary dessert, it has a ceremonial meaning in Turkey and is generally not consumed as an everyday dessert. Traditionally, forty days after someone passes away, close relatives and friends of the deceased cook lokma in large quantities and serve to neighbours and passersby. People form queues to get a plate and recite a prayer for the soul of the deceased in return after eating the lokma. Similar dishes Italian struffoli is similar to lokma Various other kinds of fried dough with syrup are found in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and South Asia, from the Italian struffoli (the most similar in preparation to lokma) and zeppole to the Indian jalebi and gulab jamun. Perhaps the oldest documentation of a related but not identical dish is in the tomb of Ramses IV, where something more like jalebi is shown being prepared. Later, the Ancient Greek enchytoi consisted of a cheese-and-flour dough squeezed into hot fat, then covered with honey.Eugenia Ricotti, Prina Ricotti, Meals and Recipes from Ancient Greece, J. Paul Getty Museum, 2007, , p. 108 A dish similar to lokma described by Archestratus, a Greek poet from Sicily, was enkris (, plural ·ºêŒ≥Œ∫œÅŒØŒ¥ŒµœÇ)‚Äîa dough-ball fried in olive oil, which he details in his Gastronomy; a work now lost, but partially preserved in the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus.

In general, they have two highly conserved aspartates in the active site and are optimally active at acidic pH. Nearly all known aspartyl proteases are inhibited by pepstatin. Aspartic endopeptidases of vertebrate, fungal and retroviral origin have been characterised. More recently, aspartic endopeptidases associated with the processing of bacterial type 4 prepilin and archaean preflagellin have been described. Eukaryotic aspartic proteases include pepsins, cathepsins, and renins. They have a two-domain structure, arising from ancestral duplication. Retroviral and retrotransposon proteases (retroviral aspartyl proteases) are much smaller and appear to be homologous to a single domain of the eukaryotic aspartyl proteases. Each domain contributes a catalytic Asp residue, with an extended active site cleft localized between the two lobes of the molecule. One lobe has probably evolved from the other through a gene duplication event in the distant past. In modern-day enzymes, although the three-dimensional structures are very similar, the amino acid sequences are more divergent, except for the catalytic site motif, which is very conserved. The presence and position of disulfide bridges are other conserved features of aspartic peptidases. Catalytic mechanism Proposed mechanism of peptide cleavage by aspartyl proteases. Aspartyl proteases are a highly specific family of proteases ‚Äì they tend to cleave dipeptide bonds that have hydrophobic residues as well as a beta-methylene group. Unlike serine or cysteine proteases these proteases do not form a covalent intermediate during cleavage. Proteolysis therefore occurs in a single step. While a number of different mechanisms for aspartyl proteases have been proposed, the most widely accepted is a general acid-base mechanism involving coordination of a water molecule between the two highly conserved aspartate residues. One aspartate activates the water by abstracting a proton, enabling the water to perform a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate scissile bond, generating a tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate stabilized by hydrogen-bonding with the second aspartic acid. Rearrangement of this intermediate leads to protonation of the scissile amide which results in the splitting of the substrate peptide into two product peptides. Inhibition Pepstatin is an inhibitor of aspartate proteases. Classification Five superfamilies (clans) of aspartic proteases are known, each representing an independent evolution of the same active site and mechanisms. Each superfamily contains several families with similar sequences. The MEROPS classification systematic names these clans alphabetically. *Clan AA (e.g. Pepsin family) *Clan AC (e.g. Signal peptidase II family) *Clan AD (e.g. Presenilin family) *Clan AE (e.g. GPR endopeptidase family) *Clan AF (e.g. Omptin family) Propeptide Many eukaryotic aspartic endopeptidases (MEROPS peptidase family A1) are synthesised with signal and propeptides. The animal pepsin-like endopeptidase propeptides form a distinct family of propeptides, which contain a conserved motif approximately 30 residues long. In pepsinogen A, the first 11 residues of the mature pepsin sequence are displaced by residues of the propeptide. The propeptide contains two helices that block the active site cleft, in particular the conserved Asp11 residue, in pepsin, hydrogen bonds to a conserved Arg residue in the propeptide. This hydrogen bond stabilises the propeptide conformation and is probably responsible for triggering the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin under acidic conditions.

Length is up to 41 cm. The French angelfish is common in shallow reefs, occurs usually in pairs often near sea fans. It feeds on sponges, algae, bryozoans, zoantharians, gorgonians and tunicates. Juveniles tend cleaning stations where they service a broad range of clients, including jacks, snappers, morays, grunts, surgeonfishes, and wrasses. At the station the cleaner displays a fluttering swimming and when cleaning it touches the clients with its pelvic fins. The adult background coloration is black but the scales of the body, except those at the front from nape to abdomen, are rimmed with golden yellow. Furthermore, the pectoral fins have a broad orange-yellow bar, the dorsal filament is yellow, the chin is whitish, the outer part of the iris is yellow, and the eye is narrowly rimmed below with blue. Juveniles are black with vertical yellow bands. This species is oviparous and monogamous. Spawning pairs are strongly territorial and usually both partners defend vigorously their territory against neighboring pairs. During the day you will mostly see these fish out and about, but come night they seek shelter in their designated hiding spot where they return every night. The flesh of the French angel has good taste and the fish is sold on fish markets. The species has been reared in captivity. Sponges constitute 70% of the species' diet and since sponges are plentiful the fish is normally well fed. It covers sponge pieces in thick mucous to help digestion.

Virtual laboratory websites A number of companies and institutions have created virtual lab websites specifically for research into Internet-based products. This type of research environment is seen as both podium and playpen for Internet-borne companies. In many cases, the labs offer visitors a chance to learn more about the company's products currently in development, and increasingly, to actually trial the work in progress. One of the best-known examples is Google Labs. Since its inception, Google Labs has resulted in the trial and launch of live products such as Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Videos. Similar examples from large web-based companies include Yahoo! Next and Microsoft Live Labs. One recent notable addition is Digg Labs, illustrating the Digg social bookmarking community's activities in near real-time. The labs are composed of the swarm and the stack activity displays. Mozilla has added a lab area to its product offering. Virtual laboratories are not the sole domain of companies and institutions. Some are created by individuals and exist solely as websites. Media labs Traditional print and broadcast media companies have also begun to experiment with dedicating specific areas on their websites to advanced projects. One of the first companies credited with creating its own lab area was Reuters. When founded, the Reuters lab offered a limited number of products for visitors to experiment with, including the news and quotes widget and their mobile service. The BBC has created a derivation on the lab idea with their BBC Backstage site. Backstage's slogan \\"Use our stuff to build your stuff\\" openly invites developers to use the BBC's various feeds and API's to power a new range of non-commercial products and services. The backstage site has allowed the BBC to create a developer network, a location for all those working with the BBC's content to come together and share their ideas and prototypes amongst their peers. The site also contains a blog. The Guardian newspaper in the UK has taken the idea of a lab to the next level with its Comment is free product. Created by Ben Hammersley, Comment is Free was made as a fully interactive extension to the Guardian Unlimited‚Äôs blogging system. The site contains the political and opinion material from both The Guardian and its sister paper The Observer, as well as work from over 600 separate subject-based experts, selected to write on their topics of knowledge. Users are encouraged to read and comment, and all posts are automatically linked to Technorati to return contextual blogosphere results. In November 2006, NEWS.com.au, the breaking news section of News Digital Media launched News Lab, the first media-driven R&D; website within News Corporation (N.B. News Corp also operates FIM Lab but this is currently without a website). The site aims to collect users' feedback on new products and amend them accordingly. Monitoring experimentation While some media companies choose to create their own experimental areas, others create dedicated areas to document the efforts of others. The Washington Post's blog section, referred to as the Mashington Post records the efforts of Internet users' experimentation with combinations of pre-existing data, referred to as mashups.

The southern terminus of SR 690 is at the concurrency of US 50 and SR 32 about east of Athens in the community of Canaanville. Its northern terminus is at SR 550 approximately west of Amesville. This two-lane state highway was established in the late 1930s. Running entirely within Athens County, SR 690 passes through Wayne National Forest and serves as a quicker route connecting SR 550 to the Athens Bypass. Route description SR 690 runs exclusively within Athens County. This state highway is not included as a part of the National Highway System, a network of highways deemed to be most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. History SR 690 was designated in 1937 along the routing that it occupies to this day. Originally in Canaanville, the route's southern terminus was located slightly west of where it is currently located along US 50. By 1997, the route was moved to its current alignment and part of its former alignment has been retained as a state highway as the SR 690-J. Other than the aforementioned realignment and the fact that the highway intersecting the route at its northern terminus was originally designated as US 50 Alternate before later becoming SR 550, the highway has not experienced any major changes to its routing since it first appeared.

It is the highest point in the upland area to the south of Garburn Pass, variously termed Kentmere Park and Applethwaite Common on Ordnance Survey maps. Topography Sallows and its sister fell Sour Howes together form a horse-shoe shaped mass, with the opening to the south east. This is the catchment of Park Beck, a tributary of the River Kent. Sallows lies to the north of the beck and connects around the head of the little valley via the ridge of Moor Head. The southern flank of Sallows, above Park Beck, is smooth and grassy, other than for the remains of a quarry. The access track to these workings is still in existence, providing the easiest access from the east. The eastern end of Sallows falls in long easy slopes for half a mile toward the Kent valley, although there are a couple of low crags, particularly on Scour Rigg. The high ground then turns southerly at the subsidiary top at Mould Rigg (), finally petering out at the confluence of Park Beck and the Kent. The slopes above the Kent are steep and predominantly covered in broadleaved plantations. Below these trees the river broadens into the oddly shaped Kentmere Tarn. A natural waterbody was drained in the 1830s to extend the available farmland, but the scheme failed and merely resulted in an area of marsh. It was later found that the tarnbed was rich in diatomite, a mineral used to produce thermal insulation. Extraction began in the 1930s and continued until 1971, producing the lines of the present man-made tarn.Blair, D:Exploring Lakeland Tarns; Lakeland Manor Press (2003) To the north of Sallows is Garburn Pass (Restricted Byway), the original route for pedestrian and horse-borne trade between Troutbeck and Kentmere. Whilst designated as a bridleway between 2006 and 2009, the road had seen considerable use from off- road vehicles, an activity causing controversy between drivers and walkers such that it was converted into a restricted byway. From the pass summit at Garburn Nook (), the land rises northwards up a broad ridge to Yoke and Ill Bell. Summit The summit of Sallows is covered in grass and heather, the highest point occupied by a curving ridge of shale about thirty feet long. This in turn carries a small cairn. There is a good view westwards to the Scafell and Coniston Old Man groups, with distant sightings from Black Combe to the Pennines.Alfred Wainwright:A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 2: Ascents In addition to climbs from Kentmere or Ings via the quarry track, Sallows is easily reached from the summit of Garburn Pass. A narrow path also leads around Moor Head to Sour Howes, allowing a circuit of Park Beck to be made.

The victory allowed the Polish troops to advance further into the Russian-controlled Lithuania and Belarus, and thus present the Bolsheviks with a fait accompli by driving them out of the newly acquired territories. The main Polish attack was in the direction of Maladzechna, Minsk, and Polatsk along the railroad lines. On August 6 the Polish Army took over Slutsk, and Minsk two days later. The Polish control over the railway lines, prevented the Russians from bringing in reinforcements. By the end of August, the forces of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski took over Barysau and Babruisk, and forced Lenin to return to the negotiating table. Operation Mi≈Ñsk was considered critical for the confirmation of Polish presence in the Kresy macroregion at the time of the reconstitution of sovereign Poland (after the century of Partitions). The negotiations however, failed, which led to the Soviet invasion of ethnic Poland in July 1920. History Polish officers in Minsk in August 1919 In early 1919 on the Eastern front the Directorate of Ukraine collapsed, and by spring, the Ukrainian insurrection had failed under attack from all sides, including by the White armies. In the summer of 1919 after the Polish successes in several skirmishes with the Bolsheviks, the two combatants (both engaged on multiple fronts) have been near the limits of their capability to wage war against each other; they needed time to regroup and concentrate their forces. ---- English ed.

Also in: The Jews had won the first skirmish, forcing the Poles to retreat several kilometers. In July, the Polish High Command decided to strike one more blow against the Bolsheviks, and cripple the Western Army (Russia) Western Division, headquartered in Minsk. The assault on the vital railway center by the 'Northern Group' was led by General Stanis≈Çaw Szeptycki whose officers included W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders, Jozef Lasocki and Stefan Mokrzecki. Their forces were composed of 12,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 40 guns. Polish plan involved a wide pincer movement around the city of Minsk. The battle raged throughout the first week of August. The Soviet forces took heavy casualties and retreated. On 8 August 1919, the Polish troops took over Minsk. Perhaps as retribution against the Jewish regiments, they killed 31 Jews suspected of supporting the Bolshevist movement, beat and attacked many more, looted 377 Jewish-owned shops (aided by the local civilians) and ransacked many private homes.. Polish soldiers in Minsk in August 1919 The success of the Polish offensive allowed the Poles to move forward again, and by the end of August J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski ordered his armies to stop, as he considered all territories important to Poland - and feasible to take before winter - secured.

Besides he was also judged as a Romantic poet and the most prolific one in the nineteen centuries. These 20th-century successors such as Ren√© Depestre, and Jacques Roumain congratulated Oswald Durand for his authentic expressions and honored him as a forerunner of Haitian indigenism. He was born in the northern part of Haiti, in the city of Saint-Louis du Nord. In 1842, both his parents died in the earthquake that devastated the city of Cape Haitian. Oswald Durand, and her sister, were welcomed in their maternal grandmother who raised them. He spent most of his childhood outside the city where he was born. Because of political instabilities in Haiti, he was forced to leave school and to educate himself without having recourse to a teacher. His most famous works are Choucoune, a lyrical poem praising the beauty of a Haitian woman, and Chant National, a lyrical historic poem which became as popular as the presidential hymn. Durand worked as a teacher before being elected to Congress in 1885. He was subsequently re-elected six times for this position. He founded or served as advisor, or writer for several newspapers and other publications.  Career  In 1860, he became a teacher in an elementary school and in 1867 he held the post of director of a secondary school in the city of Gonaives. Before he turns out to be a Professor he already created his periodical. In 1868, he turns into the secretary of the council of ministers and after elected delegate in 1885. In 1888, he became president of the Chamber of Deputies, being a journalist he created his own newspaper called \\"Bigailles\\". Before his death, Oswald Durand managed to concretize one of his greatest dreams. He travels to France and is received with honor by the famous Jean Francois Coppe to the society of letters people . Oswald Durand was considered a national poet, he used to denounce social relations in his country. In his text Poetry of Revolution Amy Reinsel stated that ‚ÄúIn general, the poems in Rires et Pleurs illustrate the various reasons Durand was hailed as Haiti‚Äôs national poet both during his lifetime and after his death‚Äù (Reinsel 106). One of Oswald Durand ambition was to show the social relations of his country, the Haitian nature and the history of his country. The author uses themes such as love, earth, slavery and revolution in his text. Indeed, slavery in Haiti was cruel. Slaves were subjected to inhuman treatment. The slave was considered a moveable good. The rest of Sunday's day was not respected . = A patriot = In Epopee des A√Øeux he reveals himself as a patriot of the Haitian nation. In his text, he extols the exploits of our ancestors who bravely fight to free slaves from slavery. He presents the history of his country as being the most wonderful of ancient stories with glorious facts. Lucmane Vieux in his article Poetry / Battle of Vertieres describes Oswald Durand 's Epopee des Aieux. Lucmane Vieux presented a passage from Oswald Durand text and stated that: ‚ÄúDessalines, one leap, is in the West. His powerful heels do not spare anything. More whites, more colonists! The slaves of yesterday, the damned Africans, were then masters of Quisqueya the beautiful. Here Dessalines is clearly identified for his accomplishments in the West‚Äù (Vieux). Jean-Jacques Dessalines was the one who continued the revolution after the death of Toussaint Louverture. He fought the powerful French army and proclaimed the independence of the country on January 1, 1804. He ordered the slaughter of all white Haitians and declared that Haiti was an all-black nation. It prohibited whites from acquiring land and property Jean- Jacques Dessalines. Durand reveals as a patriot in his poem Ces Allemands where he describes the abuses that the Germans have done to the Haitian government. Bob Lapierre in his book said this: ‚ÄúGermans, dual Prussians we tossed the money, head up, with pride, just as we toss a bone to the dogs!‚Äù (Lapierre 19). During the Luders affair, Haiti was forced to yield to German orders. They asked the Haitian government for a $20000 ransom, a letter of apology, the return of the German who was exiled and an official ceremony should be organized in honor of the German charge affairs.  Judicial Trouble  Besides the fact that Oswald Durand was a poet and a writer he also had problems with justice. In 1883, he went to jail because of his politic ideas. During his time in jail, he wrote his famous poem Choucoune. He disagreed with the government of the President Lysius Felicite Salomon and became a political refugee. During his judicial demises, he takes refuge in a foreign embassy in the city of Cap-Haitian. During his refuge, he wrote a recension of a poem title Mon Ile Bien-Aimee.  Famous works  In his text, Choucoune Oswald Durand extols the beauty of the Haitian woman. The author has created a work that went beyond the other works of his time. He had created a kind of metapoem. His Choucoune work took part in the world literature. His work has been appreciated by international readers. He used the Creole language in his text. He used rhymes from foreign models. In his text, A Primer of Haitian Literature in Kreyol George Lang tells us the type of rhymes that he used: ‚ÄúHere too Krey√≤l is subject to a European rhyme-scheme: ABABCCDD. As well, the irony that a Krey√≤l-speaking object of desire (Krey√≤l itself?) was stolen away by a French-speaker as recounted in a poem cast into a French verse form was likely not lost on readers of the time‚Äù (Lang 132). This text was also used by other people and later became very popular. Michel Mauleart Monton, a pianist of American origin, composed the music of the poem in 1893 . The music was performed for the first time in Port-au-Prince on May 14, 1893 . The same text Choukoun later becomes the lyric of a song. The lyric of this text for native English is known as yellow birds. The musical lyric was arranged in Calypso style. The lyric was performed by Harry Belafonte and Celia Cruz and was successful in the summer of 1961 when the band Arthur Lyman reached number 4 of Billboard Hot100 and number 2 of the brand new easy listening with its Hawaiian instrumental version. Another important work of Oswald Durand is Quand nos Aieux briserent leurs entraves which becomes the national song and national anthem of Haiti from 1803 to 1904 .

Early life Cherry was born in Kerens, Texas on August 7, 1901. He played his high school ball at Weatherford High School and later attended Texas Christian University in Fort Worth in the early 1920s and was a three-sport star. Upon graduation in 1924, he had a brief professional baseball career but soon entered the coaching profession. In 1936, he married Florence Snodgrass of Amarillo, with whom he had two children. Coaching career =High school= Cherry's first coaching position was at Ranger High School in Ranger, Texas, where he spent three seasons, from 1926 to 1928. In 1929, Cherry coached for one season at North Side High School in Fort Worth. In 1930, Cherry was named head coach at Amarillo High School. It was here that he established his reputation as a head coach. He compiled a record of 84 wins and 5 losses, with 45 of those wins by shutout. The average score in these games was 30‚Äì5. Amarillo High became the second school in Texas to win three straight state championships, in 1934, 1935, and 1936 (first was the Paul Tyson-coached Waco High in 1925, 1926, and 1927), allowing the opponent teams only a combined 13 points in these three championship games. =University of Texas= Football Cherry was considered as a candidate for the head coach position at the University of Texas at Austin in 1937, but was passed over for the better-known Dana X. Bible. Bible offered Cherry a position as an assistant coach on his staff. Bible groomed Cherry to be his successor, and upon Bible's retirement in 1946, Cherry was appointed as head coach. As head coach, Cherry switched the Longhorns' offense from a single-wing formation to the now-popular T formation, and found instant success. With Bobby Layne at quarterback, Texas earned a 10‚Äì1 record in his first year, a final ranking of fifth, and a defeat of sixth-ranked Alabama in the 1948 Sugar Bowl. In the 1948 season, his team compiled a 7‚Äì3‚Äì1 record and defeated eighth-ranked Georgia in the Orange Bowl. Following this season, Cherry was offered head coaching jobs by the Washington Redskins and Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL), but turned down these offers to remain the head coach at Texas. In 1949, Cherry's Longhorns compiled a 6‚Äì4 record. In 1950, the Longhorns won the Southwest Conference title with a 6‚Äì0 conference record, and earned a berth in the Cotton Bowl Classic, as well as a #3 final national ranking. Mid-season, Cherry announced that he would be retiring from coaching, and his last game was a 20‚Äì14 defeat at the hands of Tennessee in the 1951 Cotton Bowl Classic. Cherry was suffering from ulcers and insomnia at the time of his retirement, and later hinted in the article \\"Why I Quit Coaching\\" that harsh criticism from fans and media, despite his 32‚Äì10‚Äì1 record and two top-five finishes, led to his decision to retire. Baseball Cherry also served as baseball coach from 1943 to 1945 during Bibb Falk's absence. His teams compiled a 30‚Äì23 overall record, but won two conference titles with a 22‚Äì4 conference mark in three seasons. No SWC title was awarded in 1944. Post-coaching life After retiring from coaching, Cherry moved to Lubbock, Texas to enter the oil business. He died of heart failure in 1966, and is buried at Llano Cemetery in Amarillo. He was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame shortly before his death in 1966, and posthumously inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 1968.

The 17th century Dutch painters were the first artists in history to transform genre painting into a highly sophisticated and respected art form, in its own right.Sutton, Peter C.; et al.

(Berlin: De Gruyter, 2015)Waiboer, Adriaan E.; et al. (eds.): Vermeer and the Masters of Genre Painting: Inspiration and Rivalry [exh. cat.]. (Yale University Press, 2017, Genre painting (or petit genre), a form of genre art, depicts aspects of everyday life by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a genre scene is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively‚Äîthus distinguishing petit genre from history paintings (also called grand genre) and portraits. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person‚Äîa member of his family, say‚Äîas a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait‚Äîsometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the bourgeoisie, or middle class. Pieter Brueghel the Elder Genre subjects appear in many traditions of art. Painted decorations in ancient Egyptian tombs often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and Peiraikos is mentioned by Pliny the Elder as a Hellenistic panel painter of \\"low\\" subjects, such as survive in mosaic versions and provincial wall- paintings at Pompeii: \\"barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects\\".Book XXXV.112 of Natural History. Medieval illuminated manuscripts often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the Labours of the Months in the calendar section of books of hours, most famously the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. To 1800 Merry Company, a Merry company scene, by Dirck Hals The Low Countries dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both Flemish Baroque painting and Dutch Golden Age painting produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes. In the previous century, the Flemish Renaissance painter Jan Sanders van Hemessen painted innovative large-scale genre scenes, sometimes including a moral theme or a religious scene in the background in the first half of the 16th century. These were part of a pattern of \\"Mannerist inversion\\" in Antwerp painting, giving \\"low\\" elements previously in the decorative background of images prominent emphasis. Joachim Patinir expanded his landscapes, making the figures a small element, and Pieter Aertsen painted works dominated by spreads of still life food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background. Pieter Brueghel the Elder made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel's wake. Interior with Sewing Woman, c. 1800-1810 by Wybrand Hendriks Adriaen and Isaac van Ostade, Jan Steen, Adriaan Brouwer, David Teniers, Aelbert Cuyp, Johannes Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch were among the many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Low Countries during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. Often the subject of a genre painting was based on a popular emblem from an Emblem book. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in Gabriel Metsu's The Poultry seller, 1662, showing an old man offering a rooster in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595‚Äì1622), with the same scene. The merry company showed a group of figures at a party, whether making music at home or just drinking in a tavern. Other common types of scenes showed markets or fairs, village festivities (\\"kermesse\\"), or soldiers in camp. Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Filial Piety, 1765 In Italy, a \\"school\\" of genre painting was stimulated by the arrival in Rome of the Dutch painter Pieter van Laer in 1625. He acquired the nickname \\"Il Bamboccio\\" and his followers were called the Bamboccianti, whose works would inspire Giacomo Ceruti, Antonio Cifrondi, and Giuseppe Maria Crespi among many others. Louis le Nain was an important exponent of genre painting in 17th- century France, painting groups of peasants at home, where the 18th century would bring a heightened interest in the depiction of everyday life, whether through the romanticized paintings of Watteau and Fragonard, or the careful realism of Chardin. Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725‚Äì1805) and others painted detailed and rather sentimental groups or individual portraits of peasants that were to be influential on 19th-century painting. In England, William Hogarth (1697‚Äì1764) conveyed comedy, social criticism and moral lessons through canvases that told stories of ordinary people ful of narrative detail (aided by long sub-titles), often in serial form, as in his A Rake's Progress, first painted in 1732‚Äì33, then engraved and published in print form in 1735. Spain had a tradition predating The Book of Good Love of social observation and commentary based on the Old Roman Latin tradition, practiced by many of its painters and illuminators. At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many picaresque genre scenes of street life‚Äîas well as the kitchen scenes known as bodegones‚Äîwere painted by the artists of The Spanish Golden Age, notably Vel√°zquez (1599‚Äì1660) and Murillo (1617‚Äì82). More than a century later, the Spanish artist Francisco de Goya (1746‚Äì1828) used genre scenes in painting and printmaking as a medium for dark commentary on the human condition. His The Disasters of War, a series of 82 genre incidents from the Peninsular War, took genre art to unprecedented heights of expressiveness. 19th century Vasily Perov, The Hunters at Rest (1871), Tretyakov Gallery Henry Voordecker, Hunter's Home (1826) John Lewis Krimmel, Country Wedding (1820) With the decline of religious and historical painting in the 19th century, artists increasingly found their subject matter in the life around them. Realists such as Gustave Courbet (1819‚Äì77) upset expectations by depicting everyday scenes in huge paintings‚Äîat the scale traditionally reserved for \\"important\\" subjects‚Äîthus blurring the boundary which had set genre painting apart as a \\"minor\\" category. Realist paintings on such a scale, and the new type showing people at work, emphasizing the effort involved, would not normally be called \\"genre paintings\\". Both monumental scale and the depiction of exhausting work are exemplified by Barge Haulers on the Volga (Ilya Repin, 1873). History painting itself shifted from the exclusive depiction of events of great public importance to the depiction of genre scenes in historical times, both the private moments of great figures, and the everyday life of ordinary people. In French art this was known as the Troubador style. This trend, already apparent by 1817 when Ingres painted Henri IV Playing with His Children, culminated in the pompier art of French academicians such as Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me (1824‚Äì1904) and Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier (1815‚Äì91). In the second half of the century interest in genre scenes, often in historical settings or with pointed social or moral comment, greatly increased across Europe. William Powell Frith (1819‚Äì1909) was perhaps the most famous English genre painter of the Victorian era, painting large and extremely crowded scenes; the expansion in size and ambition in 19th-century genre painting was a common trend. Other 19th-century English genre painters include Augustus Leopold Egg, Frederick Daniel Hardy, George Elgar Hicks, William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. Scotland produced two influential genre painters, David Allan (1744‚Äì96) and Sir David Wilkie (1785‚Äì1841). Wilkie's The Cottar's Saturday Night (1837) inspired a major work by the French painter Gustave Courbet, After Dinner at Ornans (1849). Famous Russian realist painters like Vasily Perov and Ilya Repin also produced genre paintings. In Germany, Carl Spitzweg (1808‚Äì85) specialized in gently humorous genre scenes, and in Italy Gerolamo Induno (1825‚Äì90) painted scenes of military life. Subsequently, the Impressionists, as well as such 20th-century artists as Pierre Bonnard, Itshak Holtz, Edward Hopper, and David Park painted scenes of daily life. But in the context of modern art the term \\"genre painting\\" has come to be associated mainly with painting of an especially anecdotal or sentimental nature, painted in a traditionally realistic technique. The first true genre painter in the United States was the German immigrant John Lewis Krimmel, who learning from Wilkie and Hogarth, produced gently humorous scenes of life in Philadelphia from 1812‚Äì21. Other notable 19th-century genre painters from the United States include George Caleb Bingham, William Sidney Mount, and Eastman Johnson. Harry Roseland focused on scenes of poor African Americans in the post-American Civil War South,http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/158/5/970.pdf and John Rogers (1829‚Äì1904) was a sculptor whose small genre works, mass-produced in cast plaster, were immensely popular in America. The works of American painter Ernie Barnes (1938‚Äì2009) and those of illustrator Norman Rockwell (1894‚Äì1978) could exemplify a more modern type of genre painting. =Genre in other traditions= Japanese ukiyo-e prints are rich in depictions of people at leisure and at work, as are Korean paintings, particularly those created in the 18th century.

He was most notable for his service in the New York State Senate (1878-1881), as New York State Comptroller (1882-1883), and a member of Congress from New York's 29th congressional district (1885-1889). Early life Davenport was born in Hornellsville, New York, the son of Ira Davenport (1795-1868) and Lydia Cameron (1800-1842). His family moved to Bath in 1847, and Davenport attended Bath's Haverling Academy and the Russell Collegiate School in New Haven, Connecticut. Davenport's father owned and operated a large estate and was active in numerous business ventures including stores, farms, lumber, freight transportation, and real estate speculation. After his father's death, Davenport took over management of these enterprises. Political career He was a member of the New York State Senate (27th D.) from 1878 to 1881, sitting in the 101st, 102nd, 103rd and 104th New York State Legislatures. He was New York State Comptroller from 1882 to 1883, elected in 1881, but defeated for re-election in 1883 by Democrat Alfred C. Chapin. Davenport was a member of the 49th and 50th United States Congresses, holding office from March 4, 1885 to March 3, 1889. He was the Republican candidate for Governor of New York in the 1885 election, and was defeated by Democrat David B. Hill. Death and burial Davenport died in Bath on October 6, 1904. He was buried at the Davenport Family Cemetery in Bath. Family On April 27, 1887 in Kingston, New York, Davenport married Katherine Lawrence Sharpe (1860-1945), the daughter of George H. Sharpe. She was the granddaughter of Abraham Bruyn Hasbrouck, great-granddaughter of Abraham J. Hasbrouck and a descendant of Louis DuBois. They had no children. Legacy The Davenport family's charitable donations included founding a home for orphaned girls, which was financed by the senior Ira Davenport and his brother Charles, and supported by Ira Davenport Jr. Once closed after 94 years of operation, the orphanage's assets endowed Bath's Ira Davenport Memorial Hospital, which was named after the senior Ira Davenport. The younger Ira Davenport was a founder of the Bath Soldiers' and Sailors' Home and the town's public library. From 1906 to 1999 (when a new facility opened), the library was named for Ira Junior. The Davenports also made substantial contributions to fund Bath's monumental First Presbyterian Church, with its Tiffany sanctuary.

Greene, 523 U.S. 371 (1998), is a United States Supreme Court decision decided on April 14, 1998 which placed the United States directly in conflict with the International Court of Justice and has since been used as precedent.Justice and Society Program Newsletter Spring 1999 The Aspen InstituteWash Park Prophet: Geneva Convention Myths and Facts Background In 1992, Angel Francisco Breard, a citizen of Paraguay, was convicted of the attempted rape and capital murder of Ruth Dickie. Breard was scheduled to be executed by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1996. Ultimately, Breard filed a motion for habeas relief in Federal District Court, alleging that arresting authorities violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations when they failed to inform him that, as a foreign national, he had the right to contact the Paraguayan Consulate. The court concluded that Breard had procedurally defaulted on this claim by failing to raise it in state court. The Court of Appeals affirmed. In 1996, Paraguayan officials brought suit alleging that Virginia officials had violated their rights under the Vienna Convention by failing to inform Breard of his treaty rights and the Paraguayan consulate of Breard's situation. Ultimately, the District Court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Question Presented May Angel Francisco Breard, a Paraguayan citizen, and various Paraguayan diplomats receive a stay of execution and other relief, respectively, for the capital murder of Ruth Dickie under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations? Decision No. In a per curiam opinion, the Court denied the stay applications and all other relief. The majority of the Court concluded that, because he had procedurally defaulted it, Breard could not raise his Vienna Convention claim on federal habeas corpus review. Moreover, the Court reasoned that Breard could not have demonstrated that the alleged violation of the Vienna Convention had an effect on his state trial that ought to have resulted in the overturning of his conviction. Additionally, the Court found that the Vienna Convention did not clearly provide a foreign nation with a private right of action in U.S. courts. Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, in separate dissents, argued that the Court ought to have granted the stay applications and considered the merits of the case to different degrees. The case is also notable, as a precedent, because it is one of the most recent affirmations at the U.S. Supreme Court level of the continued validity of the long-standing U.S. constitutional law principle that a duly Senate ratified treaty may be overridden by a later domestic statute enacted by mere majorities in each house of Congress. Most countries do not permit treaties to be amended by domestic laws, and instead hold them to be superior to all legal enactments except the provisions of the national constitution in effect when the treaty was adopted. Aftermath Shortly after this decision, Angel Breard was executed by lethal injection administered by the Commonwealth of Virginia on 14 April 1998, aged 32.

On 1 July 2009, it was incorporated into the town of Ilsenburg. Geography It is situated at the northern edge of the Harz mountain range on the road from Ilsenburg and Dr√ºbeck to the town of Wernigerode in the east. The village has approximately 2.400 inhabitants, it consists of the southern part Darlingerode proper and the northern Altenrode. Darlingerode station is a stop on the Heudeber-Danstedt‚ÄìBad Harzburg/Vienenburg railway line. History Stone circle The village was known as Turincwartesrot in early medieval times, since, according to a 12th- century entry, a man called Turincwart settled down here and inherited or donated the place to the Fulda monastery, between 780 and 820. It was possibly deserted for a long time - the first time the settlement again appeared is 5 May 1086, in a document of Bishop Burchard II of Halberstadt. This date is regarded as the foundation of the village, and consequently the 900-year- jubilee was celebrated in 1986. The inhabitants lived on arable farming, but also on mining in the Harz mountains. It is assumed that Emperor Otto III held a court's day at an early mediaval stone circle in Darlingerode. The foundations of the Romanesque village church, first mentioned in 1086, also date back to the Ottonian era. The estates belonged to the County of Wernigerode; from 1429, they were held by the Counts of Stolberg. Village church On 6 August 1517, Martin Luther visited Himmelpforten Abbey near the village, where he debated with the head of his order, Johann von Staupitz, about the so-called sale of indulgences. This may be a legend, nevertheless a memorial stone was erected 400 years later here. In the German Peasants' War of 1525, the monastery was taken and nearly destroyed by insurgents from Darlingerode and Wernigerode, the monks fled, returned for some decades, but left it in the end. Nowadays just some remains of the outer walls are to be seen. During the Thirty Years' War, the area was repeatedly devastated by Imperial troops under Wallenstein and Tilly as well as by Swedish forces. The inhabitants probably were connected with people who fled into the near woods and defied the plundering troops, the Harzsch√ºtzen movement. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and the Napoleonic Wars, the Counts of Counts of Stolberg-Wernigerode became mediatized princes in the Prussian province of Saxony.

The Vilna offensive was a campaign of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War of 1919‚Äì1921. The Polish army launched an offensive on April 16, 1919, to take Vilnius () from the Red Army. After three days of street fighting from April 19‚Äì21, the city was captured by Polish forces, causing the Red Army to retreat. During the offensive, the Poles also succeeded in securing the nearby cities of Lida, Pinsk, Navahrudak, and Baranovichi. The Red Army launched a series of counterattacks in late April, all of which ended in failure. The Soviets briefly recaptured the city a year later, in spring 1920, when the Polish army was retreating along the entire front. In the aftermath, the Vilna offensive would cause much turmoil on the political scene in Poland and abroad.  Prelude  Soviet Russia, while at the time publicly supporting Polish and Lithuanian independence, sponsored communist agitators working against the government of the Second Polish Republic, and considered that the Polish eastern borders should approximate those of the defunct Congress Poland. Throughout the 19th century, Poles saw the boundaries of their territories as lying much farther east and sought to reestablish the 1772 borders of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. However, by 1919, this concept of Polish borders was already considered unrealistic and was used by Polish politicians merely for tactical purposes during the Versailles Conference. J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski envisioned a revived Commonwealth in the form of a multinational federation consisting of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and perhaps Latvia ‚Äì a plan which was in direct conflict with the Lithuanian wishes of creating the independent Republic of Lithuania. Pi≈Çsudski discerned an opportunity for regaining territories that were once the part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and now belonged to the Russian Empire, which was shaken by the 1917 Revolution, the ongoing Russian Civil War, and the Central Powers' offensive. In the first weeks of 1919, following the retreat of the German Ober-Ost forces under Max Hoffmann, Vilnius found itself in a power vacuum. It promptly became the scene of struggles among competing political groups and experienced several internal revolutions. On January 1, Polish officers, led by generals W≈Çadys≈Çaw Wejtko and Stefan Mokrzecki, attempted to take control of the city by establishing a Samoobrona (\\"Self- Defense\\") provisional government. Their aim was to defeat the Communist \\"Workers' Council\\", a rival faction within Vilnius plotting to seize the city. Samoobrona rule of Vilnius did not last long. Four days later January 5, 1919, the Polish forces were forced to make a hasty retreat when the Russian Western Army marched in from Smolensk to support the local communists as part of the Soviet westward offensive. Vilnius, the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, became part of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and was soon proclaimed capital of the Lithuanian‚ÄìBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Lit-Bel) on February 27, 1919. The Lit-Bel became the 8th government to control Vilnius in two years. During the month and a half that the Lit-Bel controlled the city, the new communist government turned Vilnius into a social experiment, testing various applications of left-leaning governmental systems on the city's inhabitants.Poland rebirth in XX century J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, Polish commander-in-chief, determined that regaining control of Vilnius, whose population consisted mostly of Poles and Jews, should be a priority of the renascent Polish state. He had been working on plans to take control of Vilnius since at least March; he gave preliminary orders to prepare a push in that direction‚Äîand counter an expected Soviet westward push‚Äîon March 26. One of Pi≈Çsudski's objectives was to take control of Vilnius before Western diplomats at the Paris Peace Conference could rule on whom the city, demanded by various factions, should be given to. The action was not discussed with Polish politicians or the government, who at that time were more concerned with the situation on the southern Polish‚ÄìUkrainian front. By early April, when members of the Kresy Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Kres√≥w) Micha≈Ç Pius R√∂mer, Aleksander Prystor, Witold Abramowicz, and Kazimierz ≈öwitalski met with Pilsudski, stressing the plight of occupied Vilnius and its inhabitants' need for self-government, Pi≈Çsudski was ready to move. Offensive =Diversionary attacks= Pi≈Çsudski arrived at the front near Lida on 15 April, bringing reinforcements from Warsaw. His plan called for exploitation of the gap in the Soviet lines between Vilnius and Lida by an advance towards Vilnius using the road and railway. Amidst diversionary attacks, designed to draw Russian attention away from the main Polish thrust towards Vilnius, the main Polish attack began at dawn on 16 April. The forces moving on Vilnius included the cavalry group of Colonel Wladyslaw Belina-Prazmowski, composed of 800 men in nine cavalry squadrons and a battery of horse artillery; and infantry under General Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy, composed of 2,500 men in three battalions of the Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division and two batteries of heavy artillery. Soviet forces in the area were composed of the Western Rifle Division, a unit which had many pro-communist Polish volunteers, and other units of the Western Army. The Soviet garrison of Vilnius numbered about 2,000 newly trained troops. Soviet forces in the area around Vilnius are estimated at 7,000 infantry, a few hundred cavalry, and 10 artillery pieces. These forces were to be engaged and thus prevented from coming to the aid of the Vilnius garrison. The diversionary attacks went well, with Soviet forces acting under the impression that the Poles had targets other than Vilnius. Despite their diversionary intent, these attacks succeeded in their own right, with Genera≈Ç J√≥zef Adam Lasocki taking Lida in two days despite unexpectedly strong resistance, and Genera≈Ç Stefan Mokrzecki taking Nowogrodek in three days and Baranowicze in four. =Assault on Vilnius= Battle of Vilnius and related operations. On 18 April, Colonel Belina decided to use the element of surprise and move into Vilnius without waiting for the slower infantry units. Polish forces left the village of M√Ωto in early morning. At 03:30 on 19 April, Maj. Zaruski took Lip√≥wka near Vilnius. Belina's cavalry bypassed Vilnius and attacked from behind, taking the train station on the night of 18 to 19 April; on 19 April, cavalry under lieutenant Gustaw Orlicz-Dreszer‚Äîfuture Polish general‚Äîcharged into the suburbs, spreading panic among the confused garrison. He seized the train station and sent a train down the line to collect infantry. In this surprise raid about 400 prisoners, 13 trains, and various military supplies were captured. Pi≈Çsudski would declare Belina's cavalry action the \\"most exquisite military action carried out by Polish cavalry in this war\\". Cavalrymen fought for control of the center of Vilnius and took Cathedral Square, the castle complex on the hillside, and the enemy quarters on the southern riverbank. They also captured hundreds of Bolshevik soldiers and officials, but their numbers were too small compared to the enemy forces, who had begun to reorganize, particularly in the north and west of the town, and to prepare a counterattack. Belina sent a message reporting that \\"enemy is resisting with extreme strength\\" and asking for immediate reinforcements. At around 8:00 in the evening the train he had sent in the morning returned with the first infantry reinforcements. The Polish troops were also supported by the city's predominantly Polish population which formed a militia to aid them. By the evening of 19 April half of Vilnius was under Polish control, however, the Red Army troops and supporters were putting up a stubborn and coordinated defence. Only upon the arrival of the main force of Polish infantry under Genera≈Ç ≈ömig≈Çy on 21 April did the Poles gain the upper hand, attacking those parts of the town still held by the Red Army. The Polish infantry was able to reinforce the cavalry in the city center, and during the night, with help of local guides, Polish forces crossed the river and took one of the bridges. On April 20, the bridges were in the hands of the Poles, and more of the city fell under their control. During the afternoon of that day, after a three-day- long urban battle, the city was in Polish hands. Pi≈Çsudski arrived in Vilnius on the same day. =Jewish deaths= As the Polish troops entered the city, the first pogrom in modern Vilnius started, as noted by the Timothy D. Snyder, citing Micha≈Ç Pius R√∂mer. Dozens of people connected with the Lit-Bel were arrested, and some were executed; Norman Davies cites a death toll for all ‚Äì Jews and non-Jews, under Polish rule ‚Äì as 65. Jews constituted close to one- half of Vilnius's population, according to the German census of 1916, and many victims of fighting and subsequent repression in Vilnius were Jews. Henry Morgenthau, Sr. counted 65, Joseph W. Bendersky counted over a hundred. There was a common belief among the Poles that most Jews were Bolsheviks and Communists, in league with the enemy of the Polish state, Soviet Russia. The Polish army stated that any Jews it killed were militants and collaborators engaged in actions against the Polish army. Having been fired at from Jewish homes, Polish soldiers took this as an excuse to break into many Jewish homes and stores, beating the Jews and robbing them, desecrating synagogues, arresting hundreds, depriving them of food and drink for days and deporting them from the city; such abuses were, however, not supported ‚Äì and even specifically forbidden ‚Äì by the Polish high command. The US Army representative on the scene, Colonel Wiliam F. Godson, agreed with the version of events presented by the Polish general staff. In his reports, Godson wrote that \\"Jews constituted at least 80% of every Bolshevik organization\\" and that, unlike the \\"harmless Polish Jews\\" (who really \\"had become Poles\\"), the \\"Litwaks or Russian Jews\\" are \\"extremely dangerous\\", making the \\"Jewish question the most important one [for the country]\\". Neglecting the plight of the Jews, Godson had only noted in his report the instances of Bolsheviks executing and mutilating civilians and Polish prisoners of war. The Nobel Prize-winning author W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont, in an article published by Gazeta Warszawska, the main organ of the openly antisemitic National Democratic Party, also denied that pogroms had taken place. Henry Morgenthau, Sr. of the Anglo-American Investigating Commission in his report acquitted the Polish side of having organized pogroms, noting the wartime confusion and the fact that some Jews had indeed shot at the Polish forces. The report was, however, highly critical of the activities of the Polish Army in Vilnius, noting that 65 Jews with no proven connections to the Bolsheviks had been killed, and that many arrests, robberies and mistreatments had occurred, while soldiers guilty of these acts had not been punished. =Soviet counteroffensive= The Polish victory infuriated the Soviets, leading to dozens of arrests and several executions among those connected to the Lit-Bel. The former Lit-Bel leaders began accusing one another of culpability for the loss of their capital. Lenin considered the city vital to his plans, and ordered its immediate recapture, with the Red Army attempting several counteroffensives in April 1919. Near the end of the month about 12,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry, 210 heavy machine guns and 44 guns were assembled by Soviet forces in the area of Szyrwiany, Podbrodzie, Soly and Ashmyany. Polish forces in the area under general Stanis≈Çaw Szeptycki numbered 11,000; Rydz-≈ömigly had 8 infantry battalions, 18 cavalry squadrons and 18 guns in Vilnius itself. Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy decided to engage the enemy forces before they combined their strengths. On the night of April 28‚Äì29, general Stefan DƒÖb-Biernacki took Podbrodzie, capturing one of the Soviet formations. Simultaneously, Soviet forces attacked near Deliny‚ÄìOgrodniki, south of Vilnius. Polish defenses and counterattacks managed to halt Soviet movements towards Vilnius, pushing them back towards Szkodziszki‚ÄìGrygajce. In retaliation, Soviet forces launched yet another counterattack, this one from north of Vilnius. The results were significantly better than those of the previous offensive, with Soviet forces breaking through Polish defenses in the area. However, Red Army forces halted their movements short of Vilnius, not wishing to attack a hostile city during the night.Robert Gerwarth, La rabbia dei vinti: La guerra dopo la guerra 1917-1923, Gius.Laterza & Figli Spa (traduzione di David Scaffei), . Polish forces took advantage of the opportunity to strengthen their defenses. Shortly afterwards, Polish forces counterattacked, pushing the Red Army back towards Mejszago≈Ça and Podberezie. Polish forces pursued and took those two settlements, as well as Giedrojsc and Smorgo≈Ñ. By mid-May Polish forces had reached the line of Narocz lake ‚Äì Hoduciszki ‚Äì Ignalina ‚Äì Lyngniany, leaving Vilnius well behind the frontline.  Aftermath  Polish Army badge commemorating the fighting over Wilno in the spring of 1919 Cathedral Square, in April 1919 Because of the successful surprise attack, the Polish army in Vilnius managed to appropriate sizable stocks of supplies and take hundreds of prisoners. When Pi≈Çsudski entered the city, a victory parade was held in his honour. The city's Polish citizens on the whole were delighted; their politicians envisaged a separate Lithuanian state closely allied with Poland. Representatives from the city were immediately sent to the Paris Peace Conference, and the Stefan Batory University in Vilnius, which had been closed in 1832 following the November 1830 Uprising, was reopened. Funeral of the Polish soldiers who died fighting over Wilno (Vilnius), April 1919 Acting in accordance with his vision of a Polish-led \\"Miƒôdzymorze\\" federation of East- Central European states, Pi≈Çsudski on April 22, 1919, issued a bilingual statement, in Polish and Lithuanian, of his political intentions ‚Äì the \\"Proclamation to the inhabitants of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania\\", pledging to provide \\"elections [which will] take place on the basis of secret, universal and direct voting, without distinction between the sexes\\" and to \\"create an opportunity for settling your nationality problems and religious affairs in a manner that you yourself will determine, without any kind of force or pressure from Poland.\\" Pi≈Çsudski's proclamation was aimed at showing good will both to Lithuanians and international diplomats; the latter succeeded as the proclamation dealt a blow to the image of 'Polish conquest' and replaced it with the image of 'Poland fighting with Bolsheviks dictatorship and liberating other nations'; however the Lithuanians who demanded exclusive control over the city were much less convinced. Pi≈Çsudski's words also caused significant controversy on the Polish political scene; as they had not been discussed with the Sejm and caused much anger among Pi≈Çsudski's National-Democratic opponents; Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\" deputies demanded incorporation of the Vilnius Region into Poland and even accused Pi≈Çsudski of treason. However, Pi≈Çsudski's supporters in the Polish Socialist Party managed to deflect those attacks. Pi≈Çsudski's bilingual \\"Proclamation to the Inhabitants of the Former Grand Duchy of Lithuania\\" (April 22, 1919). The Lithuanian government in Kaunas, which viewed the city as the historic capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, saw the Polish incursion as an occupation. The Lithuanian government demanded Vilnius back. Relations between the Polish and Lithuanian governments, unable to reach a compromise over Vilnius, continued to worsen, destroying the prospects for Pi≈Çsudski's plan of the Miƒôdzymorze federation and leading to open hostilities in the ensuing Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War. In 1920, the Soviets recaptured Vilnius, followed by the Poles' establishment of the short-lived Republic of Central Lithuania. The Polish capture of Vilnius set the stage for further escalation of Polish conflicts with Soviet Russia and Lithuania. In coming months, Polish forces would push steadily eastward, launching Operation Minsk in August.

He is also known as Iyemasa Tokugawa and Yoshihisa Tokugawa. Prince also known as Iyemasa, was a Japanese political figure of the Taish≈ç and early Sh≈çwa periods. He was the 17th hereditary head of the former shogunal branch of the Tokugawa clan and the final President of the House of Peers in the Diet of Japan. Biography Iemasa Tokugawa was born in what is now the Sendagaya district of Tokyo, as the eldest son of Tokugawa Iesato and his wife, Konoe Hiroko, daughter of Konoe Tadafusa. He graduated from the law school of Tokyo Imperial University in 1909, and accepted a post in the diplomatic corps of Foreign Ministry the same year. In 1924, he was appointed Consul-general to the Japanese consulate in Sydney, Australia. In 1929, he was appointed Envoy to Canada and from 1937 to 1939 served as the Japanese ambassador to Turkey. Iemasa often allied with his father Prince Tokugawa Iesato (aka Prince Iyesato Tokugawa) in promoting international goodwill projects between Japan and Europe, Canada, and United States. The Art of Peace book cover photo illustration at the right presents Iemasa accompanying his father, as his father receives an honorary doctor of laws degree from the president of the University of Southern California in 1934. During that same year, on May 10th, 1934, Iyemasa was also recognized for his humanitarian and goodwill diplomatic efforts by a prominent North American University and was given an honorary doctor of laws degree from the University of British Columbia in Canada. In 1940, on the death of his father, he inherited the title of k≈çshaku (, \\"prince\\") under the kazoku peerage system, and a seat as a member of the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan. On June 19, 1946, he served as the President of the House of Peers, a post which he held until May 2, 1947, when the Allied occupation authorities authorized the current Constitution of Japan abolishing the House of Peers. He died of heart disease at his home in Shibuya, Tokyo, on February 18, 1963, and was posthumously awarded the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers, 1st class. His grave is located at the Yanaka Cemetery in Tokyo. He was succeeded as head of the Tokugawa clan by Tsunenari Tokugawa, his grandson from Yasuko Tokugawa with Matsudaira Ichiro, son of Tsuneo Matsudaira.

Harlow Rugby Club currently fields three senior teams, plus a very vibrant ladies team. The first XV currently compete in London 3 Essex - a league at tier 8 of the English rugby union system - following their relegation from London 2 North East at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season, whilst the Rams (2nd XV) and Saints (3rd XV) compete in the Essex Shepherds Neame Clubs Leagues. Club history The club came into existence on December 8, 1955 at a meeting in the Essex Skipper pub in Harlow. Founder members included; Alexander J McCowan, Dr John Huntley, Ron Bracewell, Ron Strudwick, Ron Parkin, Derek Jennings and Eric Jones. Harlow initially played in a white and green striped strip. The New Town Development Corporation provided grounds for the club at a token rent of ¬£15 per annum. This ground wasn't usable to begin with so the club played rugby on a local farmer's field for the interim. The Ram Gorse Club House was opened by Sir Richard Costain in 1959. Over the years, membership grew as Harlow attracted members from all over the UK, and especially from Wales. Harlow fielded more and more teams on match days. During the 1980/81 season Harlow were able to field seven different teams on a Saturday. During these years one of Harlow's cornerstone teams was the Saints. The Saints have had two unbeaten seasons during their time, 1975/76 and 1982/83. Harlow's strength in depth continued over several decades after Gwynne Harris, the PE Advisor for West Essex Education Authority, for a number of years encouraged many high quality P.E. teachers from the Cardiff and other Welsh colleges to transfer their rugby skills and enhance their educational careers in the town and from this environment promising students were encouraged to join the club; the club built one of the highest quality junior rugby set-ups in the UK. When leagues were formed in 1987/88, Harlow were placed in the Eastern Counties Division One. Thereafter, they were promoted every two years until finally reaching the London Division One in 1993.

He is the son of Ichir≈ç Matsudaira and Toyoko Tokugawa. His great-grandfather was the famed Matsudaira Katamori of Aizu and his paternal great-grandfather was Tokugawa Iesato. As a great-grandson of Shimazu Tadayoshi, the last lord of Satsuma Domain, he is also a second cousin of the former Emperor, Akihito. Tsunenari was active for many years in the shipping company Nippon Y≈´sen, retiring in June, 2002, and is the head of the nonprofit Tokugawa Foundation. The nonprofit aims to preserve the remaining cultural treasures of the Tokugawa family, many of which were lost in the Meiji Restoration and World War II U.S. bombings. In 2007, Tsunenari published a book entitled Edo no idenshi (Ê±üÊà∏„ÅÆÈÅ∫‰ºùÂ≠ê), released in English in 2009 as The Edo Inheritance, which seeks to counter the common belief among Japanese that the Edo period (throughout which members of his Tokugawa clan ruled Japan as sh≈çguns) was like a dark age, when Japan, cut off from the world, fell behind. On the contrary, he argues, the roughly 250 years of peace and relative prosperity saw great economic reforms, the growth of a sophisticated urban culture, and the development of the most urbanized society on the planet.\\"The Edo Inheritance by Tokugawa Tsunenari\\".

Perry was laid down on 14 May 1945 by the Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine; launched on 25 October 1945; sponsored by Mrs. George Tilton; and commissioned on 17 January 1946, Commander Clyde J. Van Arsdall, Jr., in command. Service history =1946-1959= Following shakedown off Cuba and plane guard exercises off Pensacola, Florida, Perry departed the east coast, on 12 June 1946, for her first overseas deployment, a nine-month cruise which took her first to northern Europe, thence to the Mediterranean. There she joined other American units in patrolling off tension-ridden areas bordering on that sea, particularly on the Adriatic, the Aegean, and the Dardanelles‚ÄîSea of Marmara‚ÄîBosporus. Returning to her homeport, Newport, Rhode Island, on 8 March 1947, she conducted local operations and exercises from Puerto Rico to Canada and, in addition, served as Engineering School Ship for Destroyer Forces, Atlantic Fleet, and, in October, assisted in fighting the fire which ravaged the Maine resort of Mount Desert Island. Perry remained in the western Atlantic until January 1951, when she got underway again for the Mediterranean. 6th Fleet operations were followed by exercises with the British Home Fleet and in May she returned to New England and plane guard duties, local operations and training exercises. In 1952, following her 3rd Mediterranean tour, she again served as Engineering School Ship and participated in type, fleet, and NATO exercises until resuming overseas employment in 1954. In the Mediterranean from January to June, she served as Gunnery School Ship on her return. During the next four years Perry regularly deployed to the Mediterranean, patrolling, in early 1956, off the Suez Canal as the United States attempted to promote a peaceful settlement to the mounting crisis between Israel and the Arab League nations. =1960-1973= Between 29 April 1959 and 10 May 1960 Perry underwent Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) Conversion, the first such conversion, at the Boston Naval Shipyard. In addition to improved living spaces, she received the latest in sonar and anti-submarine weaponry, including ASROC and DASH. Exercises in the Caribbean followed and, in August, she shifted her homeport to Mayport, Florida, whence she began operations with Task Group Alpha. Over the next two years she operated with that group, participated in Polaris missile tests in the Atlantic Missile Range, and conducted local operations and training cruises. On 2 August 1962, she departed Florida to resume overseas deployments and for the next seven years rotated between 6th Fleet and Middle East Force tours and operations in the western Atlantic, the latter including further Polaris tests, school ship duties for the Sonar School at Key West, and, in May 1965, patrol duties with Task Force 124 (TF 124) off the Dominican Republic. In 1969, Perry interrupted her previous schedule and on 11 January got underway for duty in the western Pacific. Arriving at Subic Bay, Philippines, on 29 February, she joined the 7th Fleet for operations off Vietnam. On her return to her homeport of Mayport, Florida, she ran into Hurricane Camille on 16 August. She was ordered to remain on course and report weather conditions, among which were wind speeds of 190 knots. Her department heads eventually convinced the commanding officer to change course, but since it was his first command, he was initially reluctant to do so. He finally requested a course change, but by then Perry had suffered significant structural damage, and on 3 September returned to her homeport for three months of repairs. Perry then resumed her duties with the Atlantic Fleet, continuing them into 1970. Perry was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1973. She was sold on 24 June 1974 and broken up for scrap.

Naagulu's father has been mixing snake venom into his food since childhood, making Naagulu immune to any snake bite. Every full moon, Naagulu behaves like a cobra and searches for a woman and every woman he meets dies from his poison. On one such full moon, he kills Menaka and Raju gets suspicious about this, as there are no marks of a snake bite on her body. A young teacher comes to the village and becomes Naagulu's victim. Raju investigates with the help of film in her still camera and discovers that Naagulu has become a snake. Naagulu's father reveals his secret before dying and Naagulu tries to find a remedy, but it's too late for that. His skin starts peeling off like a snake and Raju advises him to leave the village before villagers find and kill him. Naagulu prefers death to the life of a snake and commits suicide from a hilltop.

It was founded in Bath, Somerset, in 1976 by Sir Edmund Happold when he took up a post at the University of Bath as Professor of Architecture and Engineering Design. Originally working mainly on projects in the Middle East, the firm now operates worldwide and in almost all areas of engineering for the built environment, working in 24 locations around the world. Sir Edmund Happold Edmund (or Ted) Happold worked at Arup before founding Buro Happold, where he worked on projects such as the Sydney Opera House and the Pompidou Centre. Ted Happold was renowned within the field of lightweight and tensile structures. As a result, Buro Happold has undertaken a large number of tensile and other lightweight structures since its founding (including the Millennium Dome). Ted Happold died in 1996, but the firm claims to maintain his views on engineering and life. History Millennium Dome Buro Happold was founded on 1 May 1976, with its first office on Gay Street in Bath, United Kingdom. The firm started with eight partners: The King's Office, Council of Ministers and Majlis Al Shura (KOCOMMAS), Central Government Complex in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia was the firm's first major design project in 1976. Initially, Buro Happold offered only structural engineering consultancy, with a particular strength in lightweight structures, but in 1977 it added civil engineering and geotechnical engineering and in 1978 building services engineering. In 1982 Buro Happold started to work with Future Tents Ltd (FTL) on a variety of temporary and recreational structures. The firms combined their operations in 1992, but split again in 1997. In 1983, Buro Happold opened an office in Riyadh, and has since opened offices around the UK and internationally: View of the Great Court, British Museum, London. By 1993, Buro Happold had 130 employees and eight partners. In 1998 this had grown to 300 employees and 12 partners, while in 2000 with over 500 employees the partnership was increased to 23. In 2006 the partnership stood at 25 with over 1,400 employees and 14 offices. Due to this growth and the addition of so many different services, the company was restructured in 2003 to consist of multi- disciplinary teams of engineers, each with structural, mechanical and electrical engineers supported by specialist consulting groups. In 2005, Buro Happold launched Happold Consulting, a management and overseas development consultancy with expertise in the construction sector, and Happold Media, a subsidiary offering graphic design and media development services. Significant amongst its specialist consultancy services are its fire consultancy group, FEDRA, and software development group SMART which worked with Sheffield University to develop Vulcan software, widely used throughout the fire engineering industry. SMART also develops Buro Happold's in-house software Tensyl, a non-linear finite element analysis and patterning program for fabric structures, and people flow modelling software. Also notable is its group COSA, which undertakes computational modelling and analysis and the Sustainability and Alternative Technologies Group. In 2007 Buro Happold became a limited liability partnership, and in 2008 appointed 18 new partners. In 2018 the practice appointed an additional 13 partners. Ashford Designer Outlet in Kent, United Kingdom The firm is a limited liability partnership with 60 partners and 1,700 employees. Projects =Lightweight structures= Masjid an-Nabawi (Mosque of the Prophet) In 1973, before the founding of Buro Happold, Edmund Happold, Ian Liddell, Vera Straka, Peter Rice and Michael Dickson established a lightweight structures research laboratory corresponding to Frei Otto's similar research institute at the university of Stuttgart. Ted Happold was the first to introduce ethylenetetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) as a cladding material, and the outcomes of the research carried out by the laboratory led to the development of the designs for the Mannheim Multihall gridshell and a number of landmark fabric structures in the Middle East and the UK, allowing the new building forms to become generally accepted by architects and clients. Buro Happold's early projects ranged from designing giant fabric umbrellas for Pink Floyd concerts to the Munich Aviary and the Mannheim Multihalle, both with Frei Otto, an architect who repeatedly worked with Buro Happold on projects which pioneered lightweight structures. The Mannheim Multihalle was a timber gridshell of 50 by 50 mm lathes of hemlock of irregular form, depending on the elasticity of spring washers at the joints for its flexible form. It was one of the first major uses of structural gridshells. The Venezuela Pavilion at Expo 2000 in Hanover, consisting of fabric 'petals' which could open and close according to weather conditions Following the development of fabric structures expertise on the projects with Frei Otto, Buro Happold was instrumental in further developing the knowledge and technology of fabric structures. With Bodo Rasch, a prot√©g√© of Frei Otto, and drawing on experience from the Pink Floyd canopies, they designed folding, umbrella-like canopies to shade the courtyard of Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (The Mosque of the Prophet) in Medina, Saudi Arabia. They also designed the, at the time, largest fabric canopy in Europe at the Ashford Designer Outlet in the UK.Walker. 1998. p.69 This development of fabric structures expertise culminated in Buro Happold, with a team led by Ian Liddell, and with Paul Westbury, designing the Millennium Dome, the world's largest fabric roof and the first building of its type. The expertise in wooden gridshell structures has resulted in the design of structures such as the Weald and Downland Museum and the Savill Building in Windsor Great Park. Buro Happold has also completed the designs of a number of cardboard structures, notably the Japan Pavilion for Expo 2000 in Hanover with Shigeru Ban and Frei Otto, consisting of a gridshell of paper tubes (the structure was reinforced with steel in order to comply with fire regulations, though the tubular structure was itself structurally sufficient). The firm has worked with Shigeru Ban on a number of other projects. Another design in cardboard was the Westborough School cardboard classroom in Westcliff. =Notable projects in the UK= right right UK completed projects * One Angel Square in Manchester * Arsenal F.C.'s Emirates Stadium in London * Ascot Racecourse in Ascot * The Weald and Downland Gridshell * Perth Concert Hall in Perth, Scotland * The Sage Gateshead * The Savill Building in Windsor Great Park * The British Museum Queen Elizabeth II Great Court Roof in London *The Forum at the University of Exeter, winning the 2013 Institution of Structural Engineers award for Education or Healthcare structures * The Lowry Centre in Salford * The Sackler Crossing in Kew Gardens, London * Sheffield Winter Gardens in Sheffield * The Eden Project Core in Cornwall * The Globe Theatre in London * The Millennium Dome and the later redevelopment as The O2 in London * Wales Institute for Sustainable Education (at the Centre for Alternative Technology), Machynlleth, Wales; a new education and visitor centre including the largest rammed earth wall in the UK. * Riverside Museum in Glasgow, Scotland * Museum of Liverpool, UK * Robert Burns Birthplace Museum, Alloway, Scotland * The Royal Shakespeare Theatre redevelopment in Stratford-upon-Avon * Library of Birmingham, UK * Olympic Stadium, London, UK UK projects in progress * Battersea Power Station Redevelopment in London Echo arena Liverpool =Notable international projects= Old Patent Office Building roof for the Smithsonian American Art Museum International completed projects * Spertech Mixed Use Development, Noida, India * King Tower-Lodha, Mumbai, India * Omkar Realty, Mumbai, India * King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture (KACWC), Dhahran, Saudi Arabia * Zaryadye Park, Moscow * The RWE Turm in Essen, Germany * Persija Jakarta's Gelora Bung Karno stadium in Jakarta, Indonesia * Grand Indonesia Shopping Town in Jakarta, Indonesia * The Al Faisaliah Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia * The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin * The Genzyme Headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States * The Danish National Opera House in Copenhagen, Denmark * The Palace of Peace and Reconciliation in Kazakhstan * The Khan Shatyr Entertainment Center in Kazakhstan * RAK New Gateway Building, in Ras Al Khiamah * Dresden Hauptbahnhof redevelopment, in Dresden, Germany * The Smithsonian American Art Museum's Robert and Arlene Kogod Courtyard's new roof in Washington, D.C., United States (the Old Patent Office Building); a curved steel grid roof clad in square glass overlapping panels. * Aviva Stadium (formerly Lansdowne Road Stadium) in Dublin, Ireland; a four-tiered, 50,000 seater national football and rugby stadium with a freeform transparent facade. * Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center, a multi-venue arts center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York * Hawaii Preparatory Academy Energy Lab, one of the first buildings in the world to be certified a Living Building in the Living Building Challenge. * Philippine Arena, in the Philippines is the largest indoor arena in the world in terms of seating capacity.

The roadway is referred to as the Bluewater Highway because it remains very close to the eastern shoreline of Lake Huron. Highway 21 was first designated by the Department of Highways (DHO) between Highway 3 and Highway 7 in mid-1927 and extended to Goderich in 1934. A year later, a final extension completed the route to Owen Sound. In 1997 and 1998, the portion of the route south of Highway 402 was transferred to the counties in which it laid. Highway 21 is often subject to winter closures due to lake effect caused by snowsquall, which can create sudden whiteout conditions along the Lake Huron shoreline. Several Emergency Detour Routes have been established further inland to guide drivers around such closures. Care should be taken during the winter months, as the storms can progress rapidly and unexpectedly.  Route description  Highway 6 are concurrent in Owen Sound, the only example of a Wrong-way concurrency in the provincial highway network. Highway 21 is a long lakeside route through Southwestern Ontario, which serves numerous communities along the eastern shoreline of Lake Huron. Once over longer than it is today, the highway now begins at Highway 402 near the community of Warwick, where it progresses north through the towns of Forest, Grand Bend, Goderich, Point Clark, Kincardine, Tiverton, Port Elgin, and Southampton. At Southampton, the highway veers away from the Lake Huron shoreline and travels east to Owen Sound. The route is generally smoothly- flowing, but can be somewhat congested through towns during the summer from tourists and cottagers. Highway 21 is often subject to closures at various points as it lies on the lee shore of Lake Huron. Lake effect snow squalls frequently subject motorists to poor visibility and slippery conditions, leading to whiteout conditions. Therefore, the Ontario Provincial Police claim that the road is the most-commonly closed in the province. Highway 6 descend the Niagara Escarpment into Owen Sound The highway begins at Exit 34 and progresses north towards Lake Huron. The mostly-straight section of the route lies within Lambton County and passes through the town of Forest. Near Kettle Point, the route abruptly curves north west and begins to parallel the shore of the lake, providing access to the village of Port Franks and The Pinery Provincial Park prior to entering Grand Bend. North of that village, the highway crosses into Huron County and intersects former Highway 83\\\\. Between there and Goderich, the west side of the highway is dominated by roads providing access to shoreline cottages. At Goderich, the route encounters Highway 8, then crosses the Maitland River along a bypass constructed during the early 1960s; the original routing followed portions of Saltford Street and River Ridge Crescent. The highway proceeds straight north as the baseline at the shore of Lake Huron until it reaches Sheppardton. There the surveying grid changes orientation, and Highway 21 follows a forced road allowance that meanders approximately inland from lake north to Amberley, where it encounters former Highway 86, which travels to Waterloo, and enters. The route curves northeast as it enters Bruce County to align with the surveying grid and proceeds out of Amberley towards Kincardine. Highways 21 and 6 form the only wrong-way concurrency in the Ontario highway network Between Amberley and Tiverton, Highway 21 travels straight-as-an-arrow along what was originally a rural concession road through the hamlets of Reid's Corners, Pine River, Huron Ridge and Slade. It bypasses inland of Kincardine, intersecting the western terminus of Highway 9\\\\. Within Tiverton, which acts as the primary town serving Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, traffic must turn to remain on Highway 21\\\\. As it exits southeast from the town, the highway makes a broad curve to the northeast and continues through the hamlets of Underwood and North Bruce. As it approaches the southern end of the Bruce Peninsula, the route bisects Port Elgin, then curves abruptly towards Lake Huron and passes through Southampton before curving to the east towards Owen Sound. Between those two places, the highway is generally straight, except at the boundary between Bruce and Grey Counties as well as the descent of the Niagara Escarpment at Springmount. Several communities line the inland stretch of highway, including Chippewa Hill, Kelly's Corners, Elsinore, Allenford, Alvanley and Jackson. At Springmount, the route encounters Highway 6, which joins Highway 21 to form Ontario's only wrong-way concurrency east to Owen Sound.  History  Highway 82 Highway 21 was the first King's Highway in Lambton County when it was assumed in 1927 between Highway 3 at Morpeth and Highway 7 at Reece's Corners. The original section of highway changed from a mudhole to a plank road around 1860. When James Miller Williams, a Hamilton businessman, set out one day from during a drought to dig a well, he chose a spot downhill from an existing oil seep in the village of Black Creek. Instead of encountering water, Williams hit a shallow oil deposit. As a result of the ensuing oil boom, which would begin the petroleum industry in North America, Williams laid out the village and changed its name to Oil Springs. Two competing plank road companies were formed, the Black Creek Plank Road Company (of which Williams was a principal investor) and the Sarnia to Florence Plank Road Company, both of which aimed their roads through Oil Springs. Although both roads were constructed, the former company was more prosperous in its endeavours; in 1886, a significant portion of the Sarnia to Florence Plank Road was closed up and turned over to local property owners. The Black Creek Plank Road Company meanwhile had transformed the muddy quagmire of a path into a well-maintained road. By 1863, three miles of road south of Wyoming had been paved, and the remainder south to Oil Springs planked (the Sarnia Road followed two years later). However, as the oil boom faded, so too did improvement to the road. Petrolia. A Bowstring Arch bridge was constructed to replace the existing county-built bridge shortly after the department designated Highway 21. On May 23, 1927, the Department of Highways assumed the unpaved road between Highway 7 at Reece's Corner and Highway 3 at Morpeth, via Dresden, Thamesville and Ridgetown as Provincial Highway 21, which was changed to the current King's Highway 21 in 1930. That year, the department set out to improve the new highway. Concrete slabs were laid between Petrolia and Highway 7, as well as along a section between Thamesville and Dresden. The following year, the route was paved between Dresden and Edys Mills before the effects of the Great Depression forced the department to concentrate on paving Highway 22\\\\. The election of a new government in mid-1934 led to the resumption of work in June as a depression relief project. New equipment (namely a Caterpillar Excavator), as well as the expertise of Andy Newman, an engineer who was hired when he demonstrated his abilities with the machinery upon passing a construction site on his drive home. Newman, who helped design the machine that nobody else could operate, allowed work to proceed at a much faster rate than before. The machinery could dig quicker than 50 men, and the effort showed when the gap between Petrolia and Edys Mills and the remaining gaps between Dresden and Thamesville were graded and paved by the end of the summer. On October 19, 1934, Highway 21 was officially opened by Robert Mellville Smith, deputy minister of the Department of Highways. On April 4, 1934, Highway 21 was assumed through Huron County as far north as Goderich, which was followed by the assumption of a section through Bosanquet Township on April 18, creating a concurrency with Highway 7 from Reece's Corners to Thedford. From there, the route travelled through Thedford to Port Franks, where it merged into the present highway. A final extension to Owen Sound was assumed on May 15, 1935, bringing the highway to its greatest length of . Excavation work to bypass Highway 21 north of the Maitland River near Goderich Meanwhile, on April 11, 1934, the department assumed control of a road connecting Highway 7 with Forest as Highway 21A. It was later extended to connect with Highway 21 at Port Franks on August 19, 1936. By 1938, Highway 21A had been renumbered as Highway 21, and Highway 21 through Thedford renumbered as Highway 82. Beginning in 1960, a small bypass of Highway 21 was constructed on the north side of Goderich, avoiding a nearby hairpin turn. The curving structure over the Maitland River was completed in mid-1961 at a cost of C$1.39 million and opened ceremoniously on July 17, 1962. During the early 1980s, the construction of Highway 402 east from Sarnia resulted in a shift in the route of the highway. The route was extended north from Reece's Corners to Exit 25, while the section from Highway 7 north to Exit 34 was \\"downloaded\\", or transferred to the local municipality in which it resided. Further transfers were performed in 1997 and 1998. On April 1, 1997, the section of Highway 21 from Highway 401 south to Morpeth was transferred to Kent County. On January 1, 1998, the section between Highway 401 and Highway 402 was transferred to Kent and Lambton counties.

Firmin is best known for his book De l'√©galit√© des races humaines (), which was published as a rebuttal to French writer Count Arthur de Gobineau's work Essai sur l'in√©galit√© des races humaines (). Gobineau's book asserted the superiority of the Aryan race and the inferiority of blacks and other people of color. Firmin's work, first published in 1885, argued the opposite, that \\"all men are endowed with the same qualities and the same faults, without distinction of color or anatomical form. The races are equal\\" (pp. 450). He was marginalized at the time for his beliefs that all human races were equal. Firmin pioneered the integration of race and physical anthropology and may be the first black anthropologist. His work was recognized not only in Haiti but also among African scholars as an early work of n√©gritude. He influenced Jean Price-Mars, the founder of Haitian ethnology and on American anthropologist Melville Herskovits. He worked in teaching, politics, and diplomacy. He founded Le Messager du Nord, a political and literary publication. As the third generation of a post-independent Haiti, Firmin grew up in a working class family in Cap-Haitien. He studied law, and in the early 1800s, the political turmoil surrounding the new government of General Salomon forced him into exile in Paris where he served as a diplomat. During this time, he was admitted to the Societe d'Anthropologie de Paris where he began writing L'Egalite des Races Humaines. Following the ideas of Auguste Comte, Firmin was a stark positivist who believed that the empiricism used to study humanity was a counter to the speculative philosophical theories about the inequalities of races. Firmin sought to redefine the science of Anthropology in his work. He critiqued certain conventionally-held aspects of anthropology, such as craniometry and racialist interpretations of human physical data. He was the first to point out how racial typologies failed to account for the successes of those of mixed race as well as one of the first to state an accurate scientific basis for skin pigmentation. Of the Equality of Human Races In his best known work, De l'√©galit√© des races humaines (aka Of the Equality of Human Races) published in 1885, Firmin tackles two bases of existing theories on black inferiority in an effort to critique Gobineau's De l'In√©galit√© des Races Humaines (aka Of the Inequality of Human Races). On the one hand, Firmin challenges the idea of brain size or cephalic index as a measure of human intelligence and on the other he reasserts the presence of African Blacks in pharaonic Egypt. He then delves into the significance of the Haitian Revolution of 1804 and ensuing achievements of Haitians such as L√©on Audain and Isa√Øe Jeanty in medicine and science and Edmond Paul in the social sciences. (Both Audain and Jeanty had obtained prizes from the Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine.) Founder of Pan-Africanism Firmin is one of three Caribbean men who launched the idea of Pan-Africanism at the end of the 19th century to combat colonialism in Africa. As a candidate in Haiti's 1902 presidential elections, he declared that the Haitian state should \\"serve in the rehabilitation of Africa\\". Along with Trinidadian lawyer Henry Sylvester Williams and fellow Haitian B√©nito Sylvain, he was the organizer of the First Pan-African Conference which took place in London in 1900. That conference launched the Panafricanism movement. W.E.B. Du Bois attended the conference and was put in charge of drafting the general report. After the conference, 5 panafrican congresses were held in the 20th century which eventually led to the creation of the African Union. Firmin was invested in the three main elements of Pan-Africanist thought: the rejection of the postulate of race inequality, proof that Africans were capable of civilization, and examples of successful Africans producing knowledge in diverse fields. In looking to move away from the biological understanding of race, Firmin's scientific approach was informed by the idea of a Black Egypt as the source of Greek civilization. Pan-Caribbeanism Ant√©nor Firmin devised between 1875 and 1898 a Caribbean Confederation project which envisioned the unification of Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. Firmin was interested in creating political and social unity throughout the Caribbean. This can be seen through his relationship with Puerto Rican intellectual and physician, Ramon Emeterio Betances. The pair first met in a meeting of the Society of Latin American Unity, an organisation that served as a social and political network for exiles from Latin America. It is here where they discussed the ideals of political sovereignty throughout the region. Unlike other icons from the Cuban and Puerto Rican separatist movements, Betances celebration of the Haitian Revolution countered those who did not see Haiti as an ideal revolutionary model, thus excluding it in their own plans for a Hispanic Caribbean federation.  Letters from St.Thomas  After a failed bid for presidency in 1902, Firmin was sent to live in exile in St. Thomas. In his last works, Letters from St.Thomas, Firmin remaps Haiti in the archipelago of the Americas, outlining its significance to the region as a whole. The letters reinforces Firmin's anti-essentialist agenda first displayed in L'Egalite des Races Humaines.

CatholicSaints.Info. 1 August 2016 She is the patron saint of Exeter but her historical existence is not well established. Cult and iconography The cultus of Sidwell has been active at Exeter from early times. Pilgrims were visiting her shrine by 1000, and their activity is mentioned both by John Leland and William Worcestre. The Catalogus Sanctorum Pausantium in Anglia describes her as a native of Exeter who was beheaded by reapers, who were incited so to do by her stepmother. This legend bears a striking similarity to that of both Saint Urith and Saint Juthwara, her supposed sister. She is said to have been buried outside the city, where the sick could be healed at her grave. The Church of St Sidwell, located just outside the site of Exeter's east gate, is still extant, though it was largely rebuilt after being bombed during the Second World War. The site also once had a well at which cures are believed to have been effected. One of the main streets in Exeter is Sidwell Street. In addition, a church at Laneast in Cornwall is dedicated to Sidwell, though the dedication appears to only date from the fifteenth century (the additional patron, Saint Gulval, really belongs to Lanisly (now Gulval) and was only added in the eighteenth century). Here, too, is a holy well, though without dedication. In art, Sidwell is represented with a scythe and a well at her side. St Sidwells, formerly a village outside Exeter, bears her name and she appears in stained glass in Exeter Cathedral as well as in the chapel at Oxford's All Souls College and the parish church of Ashton in Devon. She is also depicted on at least seven painted rood screens around the same county. Sidwell's feast day is variously given as 31 July, 1 August and 2 August. The sculpture in Sidwell Street (see right) was created by Bideford artist Fred Irving in 1969 and is made of fibreglass. References Sources * Farmer, David Hugh (1978).

It is a semi-rural community composed mostly of farms and suburban-like developments and is a good example of an \\"exurb.\\" Davidsonville has relatively little commercial development and no high-density housing. The community is generally not served by public water, sewer or natural gas utilities, so homes generally employ well-and-septic systems. The nominal, if not geographic, center of Davidsonville is the intersection of Maryland routes 424 (Davidsonville Rd.) and 214 (Central Ave.), located at . The Davidsonville Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Demographics As of the 2010 U.S. census, the Davidsonville ZIP code (21035) had a population of 7,815 and a median annual household income of US$141,011; 1.5 percent of families had incomes below the poverty line. Ethnically, 92 percent of the population was white, four percent was black or African American, two percent was Asian, with the rest other ethnicities. Ninety-four percent of homes were owner-occupied. As of the 2007 United States Census Bureau's Economic Census, 13 year-round retail business establishments and three retail food establishments were located in Davidsonville. History =Native Americans= Before European colonists settled in what is now Davidsonville, the area was the home to Algonquian- speaking Native American tribes. By the time Europeans began to arrive in central Anne Arundel County in numbers, the Algonquians may have vacated the area due to persistent raids by more battle-hearty members of the Susquehannock tribe. =18th and 19th centuries= Europeans and their descendants settled and developed farms and plantations in and around what came to be known as Davidsonville in the 17th and 18th centuries. Several good examples of 18th century development in the area remain today. One is the Anne Arundel Free School. On October 26, 1723 the Maryland Colonial Assembly, under the Lord Proprietor Charles Calvert, the Fifth Lord Baltimore, and his governor, passed \\"An Act for the Encouragement of Learning and Erecting Schools in the Several Counties,\\" or the Free School Act. This law, one of the first in colonial America providing for free, publicly supported primary education, mandated the construction of public schools in each of the 12 Maryland counties that existed at the time. The Free School of Anne Arundel County was built in what was to become Davidsonville sometime between 1724 and 1746, when it was under full operation with John Wilmot as schoolmaster. The original structure, expanded and restored, still stands today, is located in the community of Lavall, off Rutland Road, about one-half mile from Maryland Route 450, and is open for tours. Other examples of development in the 18th century also remain. During the late 18th century, for example, Major William Brogden, once a soldier in the American Revolution, built the Roedown plantation, once the home of the Marlborough Hunt Races, an annual steeplechase event attended by 5,000 spectators until discontinued by new owners. George Washington is reported to have stayed at the house in 1760. Roedown is located off Harwood Rd. in Davidsonville. Perhaps the most prominent example of 18th century settlement in Davidsonville is the Middle Plantation. The plantation itself dates to a 1664 land grant by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore to Mareen Duvall, a prominent French immigrant. The current house known as Middle Plantation, located on Davidsonville Rd., includes several stages of construction dating as far back as 1790. The emergence of Davidsonville as a crossroads community began in the mid-19th century. In 1839, Thomas Davidson, from whose family Davidsonville received its name, married Jane Welch. They built a home at what is now the corner of Davidsonville Road and Central Avenue that still stands today. Davidson, like virtually all plantation owners in central and southern Maryland at the time, owned slaves. However, a staunch Methodist who was instrumental in the founding of what is now the Davidsonville United Methodist Church, Davidson apparently was conflicted as to the morality of slavery. The Maryland Historical Trust states that \\"the Davidsonville Historic District is significant as a largely intact representative example of the type of crossroads community which characterized rural Anne Arundel County in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Davidsonville is among the best-preserved examples of this type of community remaining in the county; other comparable villages have been obliterated by subsequent development. The village has maintained substantial integrity despite increasingly intensive development pressure in the surrounding area.\\"  Education  *Davidsonville is also home to Davidsonville Elementary School, which has approximately 700 students in kindergarten through fifth grade. * Free School of Anne Arundel County - first free school of Anne Arundel County, which then included what is now Howard County; likely school for Johns Hopkins. *Central Middle School (Edgewater, Maryland) *South River High School (Edgewater, Maryland) Notable people *Mareen Duvall (1625-1699) was a French Huguenot and an early American settler who built the Middle Plantation in Davidsonville. * Travis Pastrana: professional motocross racer and NASCAR driver who represents Red Bull.

The two were introduced by Roderic R. Richardson, a mutual friend who recognized their shared interests and helped establish the new venture in its early stages. The inspiration to name the project Eyebeam Atelier came partly from the sculpture atelier of John Johnson's father, John Seward Johnson II and the Experiments in Art and Technology collective, although David Johnson had also used the name Eyebeam Simulations for a start-up location-based VR entertainment concept before meeting Roderic or John Johnson. After observing new media as a growing genre, the co-founders were motivated to create a similar studio. They recognized a need to provide artists and digital film artists access to new technology and a shared workspace. In addition to offering resources for new media artists, Johnson saw a need to provide middle and high school students with educational and artistic opportunities. Digital Day Camp, the first youth program which catered to new media education, was founded in 1998; in the pilot program, New York-based high school students learned web development and design. Future sessions included project-based learning around themes of bioart, urban interventionism, game design, and wearable technology. Eyebeam‚Äôs first forum, ‚ÄúInteraction,‚Äù took place online in the summer of 1998 and was curated by UCSD professor Jordan Crandall. The forum, an email list called , was hosted by Brian Holmes, Olu Oguibe, and Gregory Ulmer, and included Lev Manovich, N. Katherine Hayles, Saskia Sassen, Matthew Slotover, Ken Goldberg, Geert Lovink, Knowbotic Research, Hans-Ulrich Obrist, Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger, Mark Tribe, and Critical Art Ensemble among the participating artists, educators, new media and internet theorists, and technologists (cite). The discussions spurred by were compiled into a book titled ‚ÄúInteraction: Artistic Practice on the Network‚Äù and published in 2001. In addition to funding artistic research, Johnson hoped to develop Eyebeam as a space that would also function as a museum devoted to new media works. In 2000, Eyebeam announced an international architectural competition to construct a space devoted to the dialog between art and technology, with the design firm Diller + Scofidio‚Äôs ‚ÄúOlympic class‚Äù design named the winner of the competition. Eyebeam held its first open studios for artists in residence and fellows in 2002. Alexander R. Galloway, G. H. Hovagimyan, Tony Martin, Yael Kanarek, MTAA, John Klima, Jem Cohen, Cory Arcangel, and Michael Bell-Smith were among the inaugural exhibitors. Among the projects on display was Galloway‚Äôs Carnivore, a Processing library that allowed for the creative misuse of data surveillance created in tandem with other members of Radical Software Group.http://www.eai.org/artistTitles.htm?id=8785/ Carnivore takes its name and function from DCS1000, a surveillance system used by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigations. Carnivore was awarded the Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nica the same year. Residents Yury Gitman and Carlos Gomez de Llarena's Noderunner, a scavenger hunt based on Wi-Fi sharing, received the 2003 Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nica. Fundrace.org, a site which allows visitors to track campaign contributions through geocoding, was developed by Jonah Peretti, then-director of Research and Development at Eyebeam, and later adapted into a permanent feature on the Huffington Post. Peretti, together with Alexander Galloway, collaborated on ReBlog, one of the first blogging platform which allows users to filter and publish content from many RSS feeds. Beginning in 2005, the Eyebeam ReBlog began to feature the Eyebeam Journal, a series of in-depth writings and interviews with resident artists, research fellows, and guest contributors. During their R&D; Fellowships, Theo Watson and Zachary Lieberman continued to develop openFrameworks, a C/C++ library originally created at Parsons. Together with Processing, openFrameworks became one of the most popular platforms for creative coding. The Eyebeam OpenLab served as the birthplace of the Graffiti Research Lab. Founded by James Powderly and Evan Roth during their OpenLab fellowships in 2005, the GRL was envisioned as a nonprofit design studio for creating experimental technologies with street art applications. While at Eyebeam, Powderly and Roth developed a method for creating graffiti messages in individual LED lights and a system for projecting shapes drawn with a handheld laser in real time. Powderly and Roth later founded the F.A.T. (Free Art and Technology) Lab, a collective dedicated to the merging of open source technology and popular culture, with Theo Watson, Chris Sugrue, and others. Eyebeam expanded its programmatic lineup of exhibitions and workshops with MIXER, a series dedicated to showcasing leading performance artists in the field of live video and audio, in late 2007. The inaugural event, ‚ÄúBrother Islands (Places to Lose People),‚Äù was focused around an immersive experimental documentary of North Brother Island and Wards Island by media artist Benton C Bainbridge. MIXER events were organized around themes as disparate as the World's Fair, the 2010 Winter Olympics, and New York City‚Äôs underground and featured interactive installations alongside performances by musicians and performance artists including DƒÅM-FunK, Extreme Animals, CHERYL, and D-Fuse AV. That same year, fellows and resident artists began organizing mobile workshops and talks. In 2011, several Eyebeam residents, fellows, and alumni participated in Talk to Me: Design and the Communication between People and Objects at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Eyebeam Fellow Ayah Bdeir‚Äôs littleBits, a DIY kit of open source pre-assembled circuits, was among the projects displayed and was acquired by the MoMA as part of their permanent collection. In February 2014 the first ever Art + Feminism Wikipedia Edit-A-Thon was hosted at Eyebeam and co-organized by fellow Laurel Ptak in conjunction with more than 30 satellite edit-a-thons internationally across the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Since November 2017 Eyebeam has been located at 199 Cook Street in Brooklyn. This coincides with their 20th anniversary as an organization which was celebrated in Spring 2018.

The first three titles feature the original Superboy, the legendary hero Superman as a boy. Later series feature the second Superboy, who is a partial clone of the original Superman. Publication history =Volume 1 (1949-1977)= The first series featured the original Superboy, a teenage incarnation of the Man of Steel. It began publication in 1949, four years after the character's debut in More Fun Comics #101 (January 1945). The majority of the stories were set in the rural town of Smallville during the character's youth, including tales of his toddlerhood.Wallace \\"1940s\\" in Dolan, p. 64: \\"Superboy #8 introduced a toddler version of the Man of Steel. In a story written by Bill Finger and drawn by Curt Swan...\\" Comics historian Les Daniels noted that \\"Many early Superboy stories seemed devoted to extolling the virtues of life in America's small towns, and covers made Smallville look like a dreamworld where few problems existed...Indeed, the early Superboy might fairly be called the Saturday Evening Post of comic books.\\" The supporting cast included Superboy's adoptive parents Jonathan and Martha Kent, his over-inquisitive classmate and neighbor Lana Lang,Irvine, Alex \\"1950s\\" in Dolan, p. 65: \\"Superboy met the girl next door in Superboy #10, when the spunky redhead Lana Lang made her first appearance. In a story written by Bill Finger, with art by John Sikela, Lana quickly became infatuated with her Smallville neighbor, Clark Kent.\\" best friend Pete Ross who was secretly aware of Superboy's true identity as Clark Kent, Smallville Police Chief Parker, and the super-powered canine Krypto. With the exception of a teenage Lex Luthor, who was a frequent foe of the Boy of Steel, almost none of the featured villains appeared more than once. Fuzzy, the Krypto Mouse, a character who appeared in a single story in Superboy #65 (June 1958), inspired a similar character created by writer Art Baltazar in 2012. Bizarro debuted in Superboy #68 (Oct. 1958).Irvine \\"1950s\\" in Dolan, p. 91: \\"A book-length story by writer Otto Binder and artist George Papp took up the entirety of Superboy #68. Bizarro was a copy of the Boy of Steel, created by a malfunctioning prototype duplicator ray.\\" For much of this period, DC also published Superboy tales in Adventure Comics, which began featuring the Boy of Steel regularly in issue #103 (April 1946). In 1962, Superboy was the second best selling comic book in the United States, surpassed only by Superman in sales. The Legion of Super-Heroes starred in their own backup feature starting with #172 (March 1971). Nick Cardy was the cover artist for Superboy for issues #182-198 and 200-206. Dave Cockrum began drawing the Legion feature with issue #184 (April 1972), again increasing the team's popularity.McAvennie, Michael \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 151: \\"After more than a year as Murphy Anderson's background inker, Dave Cockrum landed his big DC break as the Legion of Super-Heroes artist ... Cockrum's debut story, which was written by Cary Bates, quickly established an exciting new vibe for the super-team.\\" Wildfire made his first appearance as ERG-1 in the Legion back-up feature in issue #195. With issue #197 (September 1973), the Legion became permanent co-stars, and the cover logo became \\"Superboy starring the Legion of Super-Heroes\\" while the title of the book itself remained Superboy. Crafted by Cary Bates and Cockrum, the feature proved popular and saw such events as the wedding of Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel in issue #200 (Feb 1974).McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 159: \\"Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel became the first Legionnaires to tie the knot. The wedding planners were writer Cary Bates and artist Dave Cockrum.\\" Issues #202 (June 1974) and #205 (Dec. 1974) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format. Cockrum was replaced on art by Mike Grell as of issue #203 (August 1974) which featured the death of Invisible Kid.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 160 \\"With the unenviable task of replacing the departing Dave Cockrum, one of the most popular artists ever to draw the Legion of Super-Heroes, Mike Grell's first issue on Superboy starring the Legion of Super-Heroes killed off one of the team's most beloved members.\\" With issue #222 (Dec. 1976), the cover logo became \\"Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes\\" and the book's title itself followed with issue #231 (Sept. 1977). The character Dawnstar was introduced in issue #226 (April 1977).McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 172: \\"[The Legion] recruited the young Dawnstar from the Legion Academy in a story by scribe Paul Levitz and artist James Sherman.\\" A backup story in issue #236 served as a lead-in to All-New Collectors' Edition #C-55 which featured the wedding of longtime Legion members Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad. Writer Paul Levitz and artists James Sherman and Joe Staton crafted \\"Earthwar\\" a five-issue storyline in Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #241-245 (July-Nov. 1978).McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 178: \\"[Paul Levitz] demonstrated his great affinity for the Legion...when he and artist James Sherman waged \\"Earthwar\\". A story originally scheduled to appear in DC Special Series was split apart and published in Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #250-251 due to the DC Implosion. Starting with issue #259 (Jan. 1980), the title was changed to Legion of Super-Heroes (volume 2), and the Boy of Steel left the team and the book. Though Superboy later rejoined, he made only occasional appearances in the series that once bore his name, and the series remained a Legion book until its last issue, Tales of the Legion of Super-Heroes #354 (Dec. 1987). =The New Adventures of Superboy (1980-1984)= The second series was actually titled The New Adventures of Superboy. It was launched to provide readers with monthly Smallville-based Superboy tales,Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 186 \\"After recently departing the pages of Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes, Superboy was free to pursue his own adventures...in this premiere issue written by Cary Bates and illustrated by Kurt Schaffenberger.\\" which had largely disappeared after the Legion became co-stars of the original Superboy title, before re-emerging for brief stints in Adventure Comics and Superman Family between 1977-1979. The series continued monthly publication for a total of 54 issues, with virtually all issues being pencilled by longtime Lois Lane artist Kurt Schaffenberger. Issue #50 (Feb. 1984) featured a Legion of Super-Heroes guest appearance with Keith Giffen splitting the story's art duties with Schaffenberger. Superboy Spectacular #1 (cover dated March 1980) was DC's first direct sales-only title. Briefly, the series also included \\"Dial H for Hero\\" back-up feature which told the story of Christopher King and Victoria Grant, two teenagers who could change into a variety of super heroes based on reader submissions. The feature was originally presented in Adventure Comics, but moved to Superboy shortly after Adventure Comics ended its run as a monthly comic. =Volume 2 (1989-1991)= The third series (Volume 2) is different from other Superman or Superboy titles in that it is set in the continuity of the Superboy television series, as opposed to the regular DC Universe (as the original Superboy was erased from mainstream DC continuity after the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, with Superman beginning his superhero career as an adult). Its intent was to explore some of the unseen tales and events that the TV series could not. The series originally carried the cover title Superboy: The Comic Book with issue #1 having a photo cover with the show's stars Gerard Christopher and Stacy Haiduk (dated Feb. 1990), although the title in the indicia was simply Superboy. After issue #11, the series changed its cover title to The Adventures of Superboy, a change reflected in the indicia beginning with #18. The series was published monthly until it went bi-monthly for its final three issues, remained in publication for 22 issues to the end of 1991 (cover dated Feb. 1992), and a concluding one-issue special in 1992. =Volume 3 (1994-2002)= A new Superboy was introduced in The Adventures of Superman #500 (June 1993),Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 259: \\"The issue also featured four teaser comics that introduced a group of contenders all vying for the Superman name...A cloned Superboy escaped captivity in a yarn by writer Karl Kesel and artist Tom Grummett.\\" the prelude to the third arc \\"Reign of the Supermen\\" in the storyline \\"The Death of Superman\\". Originally established as a human clone genetically altered to imitate Superman's powers,The Adventures of Superman #506 created by Project Cadmus, the new Superboy became the focus of The Adventures of Superman, written by Karl Kesel and pencilled by Tom Grummett. The character was then given his own title wherein he became the resident superhero of Hawaii;Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 265: \\"Superboy set up camp in picturesque Hawaii in his new ongoing title written by Karl Kesel and with art by Tom Grummett.\\" Kesel and Grummett carried over as the series' first creative team, and also retained Superboy's supporting cast including love interest Tana Moon, unscrupulous agent Rex Leech and his daughter Roxy, and fellow Cadmus creation Dubbilex. Knockout first appeared in issue #1 (cover dated Feb. 1994) and became a recurring antagonist for Superboy. During this time, Superboy also became an honorary member of the Legion of Super- Heroes during one of the team's journeys to the present day.Legionnaires #31 Kesel and Grummett departed the series after issue #30. Subsequently, the series was mainly written by Ron Marz and Barbara Kesel; pencillers included Ramon Bernado, Sal Buscema and Georges Jeanty. During this period, Superboy also appeared in the companion title Superboy and the Ravers, which ran for 19 issues. Kesel and Grummett returned to the series with issue #50. The creative team's second run saw major status quo shifts, including Superboy moving away from Hawaii and becoming employed by Project Cadmus, and the introduction of new regular supporting characters including Dr Serling Roquette, Mickey Cannon, and Guardian. Superboy was also finally given a real name, Kon- El.Superboy #59 Kesel and Grummett's second run concluded with issue #79. A new regular creative team of writer Joe Kelly and penciller Pascal Ferry began on the series with issue #83; Eddie Berganza began as co-writer with issue #87. The creative team changed again in issue #94, with the new writing team of Jimmy Palmiotti & Dan DiDio and penciller John McCrea; this run saw Kon-El move to an apartment building in the Suicide Slum section of Metropolis, with an entirely new supporting cast and set of street-level villains. The series was cancelled at issue #100 (with Kesel and Grummett returning for the prologue section of the finale; cover dated July 2002), having run for 102 issues altogether including #0 and #1,000,000. =Volume 4 (2010-2011)= A new Superboy series starring Kon-El debuted with a January 2011 cover date, written by Jeff Lemire and drawn by Pier Gallo. In the intervening time between series, Kon-El had been retconned to be the hybrid clone of Superman and Lex Luthor;Teen Titans Vol. 3 #1 Clark Kent's history as the original Superboy had also been restored to the main DC continuity. In this series, Kon-El, living under the secret identity of Conner Kent, lives with Martha Kent and Krypto in Smallville, the town he protects as the second Superboy. Superboy vol. 4 ended as a result of DC Comics relaunching their entire line of comics in September 2011. =Volume 5 (2011-2014)= As part of The New 52 relaunch in September 2011, the Superboy series began with a new first issue. This new series was written by Scott Lobdell and drawn by R. B. Silva and Rob Lean. It began with a new origin story for Kon-El where he was created by the secret organisation N.O.W.H.E.R.E. as a \\"living weapon\\", in a manner similar to the origin of Superboy from the then-ongoing Young Justice cartoon. Tom DeFalco began scripting the series over Lobdell's plots with issue #6 (April 2012) and became the full writer with issue #12 (October 2012). Kon-El's genetic donor in the new continuity was originally left ambiguous and hinted to be the same as before the reboot, but was eventually revealed to be Jon Lane Kent, the villainous future son of Superman and Lois Lane.Superboy #19 Justin Jordan became the new series writer with issue #20. Kon-El was seemingly killed in the crossover story \\"Krypton Returns\\"; beginning with issue #26 under new writer Marv Wolfman, Jon Lane Kent became the new series protagonist. Aaron Kuder took over as writer with issue #30. The series was cancelled with issue #34 (October 2014), with Kon-El returning in the finale. = Collected editions = *Legion of Super-Heroes Archives **Volume 1 includes Superboy #86, #89, and #98, 255 pages, 1991, **Volume 3 includes Superboy #117, 224 pages, 1993, **Volume 4 includes Superboy #124-125, 224 pages, 1994, **Volume 8 includes Superboy #147, 240 pages, February 1999, **Volume 10 collects Superboy #172-173, #183-184, #188, #190-191, #193, #195, #197-202, 232 pages, October 2000, **Volume 11 collects Superboy #203-212, 224 pages, August 2001, **Volume 12 collects Superboy #212-223, 240 pages, May 2003, **Volume 13 collects Superboy #224-233, 240 pages, May 2012, *Showcase Presents: The Legion of Super-Heroes ** Volume 1 includes Superboy #86, 89, 98, and 117, 560 pages, April 2007, ** Volume 2 includes Superboy #117 and 125, 528 pages, April 2008, ** Volume 4 includes Superboy #172-173, 176, 183-184, 188, 190-191, 512 pages, October 2010, *Superboy: The Greatest Team-Ups Ever Told includes Superboy #55, 63, 80, 121, 171, 182 and The New Adventures of Superboy #13, 168 pages, January 2010, *The New 52 **Superboy Volume 1: Incubation collects Superboy vol. 5 #1-7, 160 pages, August 2012, **The Culling: Rise of the Ravagers collects Superboy vol. 5 #8-9; Legion Lost vol. 2 #8-9; Teen Titans vol. 4 #8-9, and Teen Titans Annual #1, 176 pages, January 2013, **Superboy Volume 2: Extraction collects Superboy vol. 5 #0, #8-12; Teen Titans vol. 4 #10, 160 pages, Mayz 2013, **Superboy Volume 3: Lost collects Superboy vol. 5 #13-19; Superboy Annual vol. 5 #1, 200 pages, December 2013 **Superboy Volume 4: Blood and Steel collects Superboy vol. 5 #20-27, 160 pages, July 2014 **Superboy Volume 5: Paradox collects Superboy vol. 5 #0, #28-34; Superboy: Future's End #1 232 pages, January 2015 See also *Adventure Comics *Superboy and the Ravers *Smallville#Comic books - tie-in to the Smallville television series  References   External links   * *Superboy, The New Adventures of Superboy, Superboy vol. 2, and Superboy vol. 3 at Mike's Amazing World of Comics *Superboy at the DC Database Project Category:1949 comics debuts Category:1977 comics endings Category:1980 comics debuts Category:1984 comics endings Category:1990 comics debuts Category:1991 comics endings Category:1994 comics debuts Category:2002 comics endings Category:2010 comics debuts Category:2011 comics endings Category:2011 comics debuts Category:2014 comics endings Category:Child characters in comics Category:Comics based on television series Category:Comics by Arnold Drake Category:Comics by Paul Kupperberg Category:Comics spin-offs Category:DC Comics titles Category:Superhero comics Category:Superboy Category:Superman titles ","title":"Superboy (comic book)"},{"id":"7750019","text":"The Inner Life of the Cell is an 8.5-minute 3D computer graphics animation illustrating the molecular mechanisms that occur when a white blood cell in the blood vessels of the human body is activated by inflammation (Leukocyte extravasation).

He served as the 26th Secretary of State of Oregon from 2017 until his death in 2019. Richardson was from Central Point, Oregon and served six terms in the Oregon House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party. He represented House District 4, which included portions of Jackson and Josephine counties, and was the Republican nominee for Governor of Oregon in the 2014 election, losing to incumbent Democrat John Kitzhaber. In 2016, Richardson was the successful Republican nominee for Oregon Secretary of State, defeating Democratic candidate Brad Avakian with 47% of the vote to Avakian's 43%. Early life education The son of a carpenter, Richardson grew up in Southeast Los Angeles. He moved permanently to Oregon in 1979.

History St. Michael's Academy was founded in 1968 as Maria Regina Academy by Francis Schuckardt, a leader in the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima in northern Idaho as a group of four schools, a high school each for boys and girls and a grade school each for boys and girls. In September 1978, the boys high school moved to Mount Saint Michael in Spokane, Washington. In 1996 the individual schools within Maria Regina Academy, Holy Angels Elementary School, Immaculata High School for girls and St. Michael's High School for boys, were united into a single school and was renamed Saint Michael's Academy. Athletics In 1990, William Mashburn established the first boys‚Äô basketball team, which was the first ever athletics offered at the High School. Competing primarily against Christian schools, St. Michael's worked in public schools as healthy competition. After winning multiple yearly tournaments, membership to the Panorama League was reached in 1994. With this new membership, St. Michaels established a solid baseball program. In 1996, Larry Urann developed the first girls‚Äô softball team. As a result of League membership, a girls‚Äô basketball team had to be in existence within five years. Due to the attitudes and beliefs of certain religious members, girls‚Äô sports in general were frowned upon due to the idea that they were not ‚ÄúMary-like‚Äù or ‚Äúimmodest‚Äù due to physical contact and the wearing of tank tops and shorts. But after much procrastination, in 1999 the first ever girls‚Äô basketball team was formed. Students at St. Michael's for years enjoyed a normal environment with academics and sports. That would change in the late 2000s. Due to the exodus of many Religious, the school was left without educated teachers and leaders. This led to the mismanagement of the school and the sports program. As a result, St. Michael's leadership ran out perennial coaches and changed the membership of the Panorama League to the Bi-County league citing a less distance to travel for away games. Teachers were complaining that students were gone too long from the classroom and the much quieted resentment about the sports program gained significant momentum with the faculty. As a result, the opportunity was ripe for what the faculty wanted - a complete withdrawal from organized league sports. The principal of the school, Sr. Vianney, issued a letter in 2013 citing off the spot's program. But in later year's the school saw the changes in the student's attitude towards School and the drop of student population. Due to these facts \\"St. Michael's decided to bring back most of these sport's including baseball, cross-country, basketball, and softball, in the upcoming 2019-2020 school year.

Some are driven by electric motors, some by gasoline engines, and some require the rider to propel the craft by pedaling. Most are equipped with water guns for duels with other riders. Bumper boat attractions can commonly be found in places such as amusement parks, carnivals, fairs, family fun centers, and theme parks.  Description  Bumper boats are an amusement ride in which people drive small boats in a pool or pond and try to crash into each other for fun. In a patent application related to the ride, its inventor wrote, \\"one of the thrills of operating amusement park boats of this type is to initiate collisions with other similar boat within a relatively confined pool.\\" The small boats can hold one or two people and have oversized fenders that resemble a large tractor tire inner tube. The boats are powered by either electric or gasoline engines.  Bumper boat invention  Edward A. Morgan, co-founder of amusement park ride manufacturer Arrow Development Company, invented bumper boats in the early 1970s. Morgan applied for a U.S. patent on the ride in 1972. The U.S. government granted the patent in 1974. The patent includes detailed design and construction guidelines, including a maximum speed of four miles per hour and circular shock absorbers around the boat to protect riders.  History  Bumper boats are similar in concept to the much older and more ubiquitous bumper cars. Like bumper boats, the point of bumper cars is to collide with other cars. Bumper cars date to the early 1920s. Bumper car collisions tend to be more jarring than bumper boats. Arrow Development Company, later known as Arrow Dynamics, was the original maker and patent owner of the bumper boats ride. Arrow was founded in 1946 by Edward Morgan and Karl Bacon as a builder of carousels and other rides. The company's fortunes took off when Walt Disney hired it to build many of Disneyland's original rides, such as Snow White's Adventures and Casey Junior Circus Train. The company gradually became mostly a roller coaster maker over the years. It went bankrupt in 2001. Rival ride maker S&S; Power bought Arrow that year and maintains S&S; Arrow as a division today. It primarily makes roller coasters. Another idea spawned during the decade of the 1930s was the \\"Dodgem Motor Boats.\\" Like the Dodgem car, the boats were operator driven and seated two adults. As the Dodgem car had given many a first opportunity to \\"get behind the wheel of a car,\\" so the boats gave many their first chance to operate a powerboat. Streamlined and slick in appearance, the powerboats were designed to give both driver and passenger the feeling of a luxury ride in a lake or lagoon. A brief eyewitness description of the boats constructed for this new ride was written in July 1932: > Visited Amesbury with Markey and looked over his new Dodgem boat which is a > very nice looking job. It is considerably longer than the water skooter made > by Lusse [Company] and built on a different principal. These are made all of > wood. This, if it operates satisfactorily, should prove a very nice boat. Certainly the most elaborate early boat installation was done for the Chicago World's Fair in 1933. Another elaborate and memorable Dodgem boat installation was constructed six years later for the 1939 New York World's Fair. For this national event, the Dodgem Corporation teamed up with the Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC). Not only did they jointly operate a boat ride but also two Dodgem car rides. Both Dodgem and PTC were to have equal shares. Two buildings valued at $27,500 were to be put up by and mortgaged to the PTC, and Dodgem was to supply fifty cars valued at $20,000. For the boat ride, PTC was apparently responsible for the construction of a channel. How many boats were constructed or how profitable the three rides were is unclear. As to the popularity of boat rides, William Ford, who worked for Lusse Company after the boat craze had passed, reported: > They [boat rides] were very popular up to and after the second world war > when operators wanted more space and had to get rid of the required lakes > and artificial lagoons. Also, the price of gas went up as well as anti- > pollution laws, which were forced on them [park owners] because of the > filthy water that was in the lagoons. . . . Evidence suggests that Dodgem was out of the boat business by the time of the war. An expensive ride to install, outfit, and maintain, especially if a man- made lagoon was required, Dodgem motorboats were not destined to be the stellar performers that the cars proved to be. Elaborate boat rides would not return to the amusement park scene until Walt Disney and the development of theme parks in the late 1950s and early 1960s began to bring the likes of paddle wheelers and other large craft back to grand-scale manmade waterways.Bumping Down Memory Lane: The Lusse Legacy  Bumper boats today  Several companies still make bumper boats today. These companies include Barcachoc bumperboats, J&J; Amusements, Foster Manufacturing Corporation and Bumper Boats Inc. Today's bumper boats include some added features, such as mounted water guns for shooting opposing boat drivers.

In India and Pakistan, guggul is cultivated commercially. The resin of C. wightii, known as gum guggulu, has a fragrance similar to that of myrrh and is commonly used in incense and perfumes. It is the same product that was known in Hebrew, ancient Greek and Latin sources as bdellium. Guggul is used in Ayurveda remedies and it is mentioned in Ayurvedic texts dating back to 600 BC. It is often sold as a herbal supplement. The gum can be purchased in a loosely packed form called dhoop, an incense from India, which is burned over hot coals. This produces a fragrant, dense smoke. It is also sold in the form of incense sticks and dhoop cones which can be burned directly. Chemical composition Over a hundred metabolites of various chemical compositions were reported from the leaves, stem, latex, root and fruit samples. High concentrations of quinic acid and myo-inositol were found in fruits and leaves. Traditional medicinal use Commiphora wightii has been a key component in ancient Indian Ayurvedic system of medicine. Chemical structure of guggulsterone, a constituent of gum guggul The extract of gum guggul, called gugulipid, guggulipid, or guglipid, has been used in Unani and Ayurvedic medicine, for nearly 3,000 years in India.Indian herb can reduce cholesterol , BBC NEWS, 2 May 2002 One chemical ingredient in the extract is the steroid guggulsterone, which acts as an antagonist of the farnesoid X receptor, once believed to result in decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver. However, several studies have been published that indicate no overall reduction in total cholesterol occurs using various dosages of guggulsterone and levels of low-density lipoprotein (\\"bad cholesterol\\") increased in many people.  Endangerment and rescue  'Save Guggul Movement' in Rajasthan, India Because of its use in traditional medicine, C. wightii has been overharvested, and has become so scarce in its two habitats in India‚ÄîGujarat and Rajasthan‚Äîthat the World Conservation Union (IUCN) has enlisted it in its IUCN Red List of threatened species. Several efforts are in place to address this situation. India's National Medicinal Plants Board launched a project in Kutch District to cultivate of guggal, while a grass-roots conservation movement, led by IUCN associate Vineet Soni, has been started to educate guggal growers and harvesters in safe, sustainable harvesting methods.

Services were held at the academy until a permanent site for construction of a house of worship could be located by the congregation. These first members of the congregation came primarily from the same area in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, which is located west of Aberdeen. In Scotland, they had been members of the Free Church of Scotland. After immigrating to the United States and traveling to Oregon, they settled near each other in the Tualatin Valley. Because of the settlers' Scottish origin, their church building acquired its common name \\"The Old Scotch Church.\\" The twelve original Scottish pioneers were: Mr. and Mrs. William Chalmers and their 11 children, their youngest Catherine was the first buried there. Mr. and Mrs. James Smith, Rev. and Mrs. George Ross, Mr. and Mrs. George Alexander, their daughter Eliza, Miss Alexander and John Milne.

On March 11, 1878, the church board began the process of building a permanent building by authorizing an estimate to determine the costs of building a church structure. An estimate of $2120 was completed for a Carpenter Gothic-style building in early 1878. The architect for the structure was Mr. Balantyne.Historic names mark old gravestones. Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976. His design included buttresses, stained glass windows, a steep roof, and the signature eight-sided steeple. Construction commenced with much of the material and labor being donated by the congregation. The stained glass windows in the building were imported from Scotland. The church building, adjacent to McKay Creek, was completed in 1878 and dedicated that same year. A church bell was added in 1926 to the steeple. =Expansions= In 1905, the church was expanded when an annex was built onto the back of the building, adding additional classrooms for Sunday school. Then in 1940 the annex was expanded and a half-basement added, followed by a second addition in 1955 that included the first indoor restrooms at the church. From 1959 to 1960 the building was raised, allowing for a full basement to by completed. In 1984 construction was completed that added four classrooms to the church structure . Cemetery Many pioneers of the Oregon Country are also buried in the cemetery. Joseph Meek is one of the best known of those buried at the Old Scotch Church. Meek died on June 20, 1875, and was originally buried at his homestead, located near a historic marker dedicated to him along the Sunset Highway. Meek was a mountain man, a member of Oregon's Provisional Government, and the first U.S. Marshall of the Oregon Territory. After his land was sold, his remains were moved and re-interred at the church's cemetery. The cemetery also contains a cairn added in 1985 as a memorial to ancestors in Scotland who were massacred at Glen Coe in 1692.

The entire episode is set six months before the series' premiere, displaying how all the characters initially developed their powers. Plot Hiro Nakamura arrives at the Burnt Toast Diner six months in the past after attempting to go back only a single day. Charlie, the waitress he is there to save, serves him. Jackie arrives at Claire's bedroom and informs Claire that she got her the open cheerleading position. Jackie is surprised at Claire's lack of enthusiasm and threatens to give the position to someone else. A struggle ensues for the outfit, ending with Claire's hand crashing through a glass cabinet door after both girls lose their grip. Her mother helps clean the wound before taking her to the emergency room. Mr. Bennet then receives a phone call from Chandra, who tells Mr. Bennet that they must speak about Claire. Hiro continues his attempts to explain to Charlie that he teleported from the future. As it rains outside, Hiro realizes that he teleported back too far, since it was not raining the day before he teleported, and it is, in fact, Charlie's birthday in April. He considers trying to teleport again, but is afraid of where he might end up and decides against it. Hiro brings a newspaper to the diner and shows Charlie the results of a Japanese baseball game where the Swallows beat the Dragons. Hiro comments on how flawlessly she reads the Japanese article after only one day, but her skepticism has not waned. They begin to discuss origami. Charlie comments that a person who folds a thousand cranes will be granted one wish. Hiro then uses his powers to stop time and fill the diner with 1000 cranes on strings, and also offers her a one-way ticket to Japan. He states that he doesn't care if she believes him, but only wishes for her to accompany him to Japan. At Chandra's apartment, Chandra talks to Gabriel while performing some tests. Chandra asks Gabriel why he did not change professions instead of fixing clocks like his father, to which Gabriel references a phrase from Chandra's book about \\"evolutionary imperative,\\" claiming that evolution compels creatures towards certain behaviors. Chandra appears to be disappointed upon completing the tests, telling Gabriel that he appears to be \\"healthy.\\" Gabriel is also disappointed and asks whether Chandra will perform additional tests. Chandra says he may have been wrong; Gabriel may not have any special powers, despite being on his list. Gabriel begs for more tests to be done, but Chandra says there are others in need of his time. Gabriel browses through folders of other suspected evolved humans and asks whether he thinks Brian Davis, who Chandra suspects of being telekinetic, is important or whether Chandra will give up on him too, getting him kicked out. Gabriel's temper causes Chandra to make him leave. On the street, Gabriel glances at Brian Davis's name and address, written on the Post-It he took off the folder. As Gabriel leaves, Mr. Bennet exits a cab and approaches the building. Gabriel is repairing another pocket watch at his shop when Brian Davis enters, explaining that someone called him. Gabriel tells him that he made the call. He glances down at the watch on the table and sees the name \\"Sylar\\" on the face and introduces himself to Brian Davis as \\"Gabriel Sylar.\\" Brian stares at a mug on Gabriel's desk and manages to slide it across the desk telekinetically, then asking if Gabriel can make it go away, surprising him. Brian tells him he does not know what the ability is, but he doesn't want it. Gabriel then picks up a crystal from the table and kills Brian. Gabriel meets with Chandra again and demonstrates telekinetic power by moving a glass across the table until it is moved off the table and the glass flies and smashes against the wall. Gabriel apologizes for his previous behavior, and Chandra understands his anger. Gabriel tells him that he feels different now, as if he has a chance to start over with a new life and new purpose. He tells Chandra, \\"We can change the world.\\" Gabriel tells Chandra that all the others are waiting to be told of their importance and their true potential.

Filmed over three years it documents American citizens investigating anomalies and irregularities with 'e-voting' (electronic voting) systems that occurred during the 2000 and 2004 elections in the United States, especially in Volusia County, Florida. The film investigates the flawed integrity of electronic voting machines, particularly those made by Diebold Election Systems, exposing previously unknown backdoors in the Diebold trade secret computer software. The film culminates dramatically in the on-camera hacking of the in-use / working Diebold election system in Leon County, Florida - the same computer voting system which has been used in actual American elections across thirty-three states, and which still counts tens of millions of America's votes today. In 2007 Hacking Democracy was nominated for an Emmy award for Outstanding Investigative Journalism - Long Form.  Demonstrated flaws  The documentary follows Bev Harris and Kathleen Wynne, director and associate director for nonprofit election watchdog group Black Box Voting, as they attempt to discover the extent to which it would be possible to alter results on the electronic voting machines of Diebold Election Systems (now Premier Election Solutions). Andy Stephenson, an employee of Black Box Voting from July‚ÄìDecember 2004, assisted with comparisons of audit documents in Volusia County and obtained a secret videotape of Harris interviewing a voting machine testing lab. Kathleen Wynne captured live video of Harris finding voting machine records in a Volusia County trash bag, and captured video of Cuyahoga County, Ohio elections workers admitting that the initial 3% recount ballots had not been randomly selected during the 2004 presidential election. Harris and Wynne then embarked on a series of five voting machine hack tests with Dr. Herbert Hugh Thompson and Harri Hursti in 2005 and 2006. During the course of the documentary, multiple methods of tampering with the votes are shown. The first is through editing the database file that contains the voting totals. This file is a standard Microsoft Access database, and can be opened by normal means outside of the encompassing voting program without a password. Some jurisdictions have disabled Microsoft Access, making it more difficult to alter the database, but this protection was shown to be bypassed by Dr. Herbert Hugh Thompson through a Visual Basic program which searched for a string of text and edited the file through external means. However, alterations of the results in either of these fashions would be caught if a vigilant elections official compared the results with voting machine tapes. Another hacking technique was demonstrated through hacking the actual computer code used in the Diebold Accu-Vote memory cards. This method was discovered by Finnish computer security expert Harri Hursti and is known as \\"the Hursti Hack\\". In this hack, Harri Hursti rigged the Diebold optical scan voting system to make the wrong candidate win by adding negative (minus) votes to one race. This resulted in that race having votes literally subtracted from its vote total. These methods were tested by the Leon County Supervisor of Elections, Ion Sancho, on the actual Diebold optical scan voting system used by Tallahassee, Florida in all their prior elections. This method demonstrated, contrary to a previous Diebold statement, that a person attempting to rig the votes of a precinct would need access to only the memory card, not the optical scan voting system or tabulation software. This method, when cross-checked between the optical scan voting system and tabulation software, perfectly mimics a legitimate result, and further makes the voting machine produce a false zero-vote print-out, falsely confirming that the memory card has no votes inside it before voting begins. Following this historic hack Ion Sancho stated: \\"If I had not known what was behind this I would have certified this election as a true count of the votes.\\" Reaction Even though no one from Diebold Election Systems admitted to having seen the film, Diebold President David Byrd suggested that Hacking Democracy was \\"replete with material examples of inaccurate reporting\\", and demanded that it not be aired. His criticism was based on an earlier film made by the same three filmmakers. However, HBO refused to remove it from their schedules. In addition Diebold wrote a letter to HBO referring to the famous vote changing 'Hursti Hack' featured in the film, claiming that \\"Harri Hursti is shown attacking a Diebold machine in Florida. But his attack proved later to be a complete sham.\\" This statement by Diebold was proven to be wholly wrong by independent computer scientists at UC Berkeley who investigated the Hursti Hack. California's Secretary of State commissioned a Special Report by scientists at UC Berkeley to investigate the Hursti Hack. Page 2 of their report states: > Harri Hursti's attack does work: Mr. Hursti's attack on the AV-OS is > definitely real. He was indeed able to change the election results by doing > nothing more than modifying the contents of a memory card. He needed no > passwords, no cryptographic keys, and no access to any other part of the > voting system, including the GEMS election management server. One of Diebold's objections to the film was that it failed to mention that Avi Rubin, a Johns Hopkins computer science professor and vocal Diebold critic, may have a conflict of interest. Rubin at one point owned stock options in VoteHere, which sells auditing software and systems for voting machines. However, Rubin disposed of his stock options and withdrew from the VoteHere advisory board in August 2003, and says he had not had any meaningful contact since joining over two years before, except occasionally receiving press clippings.  DVD Release and Online Movie  The film was released on DVD on March 20, 2007. It includes deleted scenes, a trailer and director biographies. \\"Hacking Democracy\\" was published for online viewing on Amazon Instant Video on 30 September 2016.

Jenniskens is the author of the 790 page book \\"Meteor Showers and their Parent Comets\\" published by Cambridge University Press in 2006.Jenniskens P., Meteor Showers and their Parent Comets. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 790 pp. Jenniskens is president of Commission 22 of the International Astronomical Union (2012-2015) and was chair of the Working Group on Meteor Shower Nomenclature (2006‚Äì2012) after it was first established.IAU Meteor Data Center Discovered at Ond≈ôejov Observatory by Petr Pravec, asteroid \\"42981 Jenniskens\\" is named in his honor. In 2008, Jenniskens together with Muawia Shaddad, led a team from the University of Khartoum in Sudan that recovered fragments of asteroid 2008 TC3 in the Nubian Desert, marking the first time meteorite fragments had been found from an object that was previously tracked in outer space before hitting Earth. Published in Letters to Nature  NASA Multi-Instrument Aircraft Campaigns  = Meteor showers = Jenniskens is the principal investigator of NASA's Leonid Multi-Instrument Aircraft Campaign (Leonid MAC), a series of four airborne missions that fielded modern instrumental techniques to study the 1998 - 2002 Leonids meteor storms. These missions helped develop meteor storm prediction models, detected the signature of organic matter in the wake of meteors as a potential precursor to origin- of-life chemistry, and discovered many new aspects of meteor radiation. More recent meteor shower missions include the Aurigid Multi-Instrument Aircraft Campaign (Aurigid MAC), which studied a rare September 1, 2007, outburst of Aurigids from long-period comet C/1911 N1 (Kiess), and the Quadrantid Multi- Instrument Aircraft Campaign (Quadrantid MAC), which studied the January 3, 2008, Quadrantids. Since October 2010, Jenniskens has developed the global Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) project to map our meteor showers. Meteor showers are detected by triangulating the path of meteors recorded in a low-light video camera surveillance of the night sky. Jenniskens identified several important mechanisms of how our meteor showers originate. Since 2003, Jenniskens identified the Quadrantids parent body , and several others, as new examples of how fragmenting comets are the dominant source of meteor showers.P. Jenniskens, 2014. 2003 EH1 is the Quadrantid shower parent comet. The Astrophysical Journal 127, 3018. These objects are now recognized as the main source of our zodiacal dust cloud. Before that, he predicted and observed the 1995 Alpha Monocerotids meteor outburst (with members of the Dutch Meteor Society), proving that \\"stars fell like rain at midnight\\" because the dust trails of long-period comets wander on occasion in Earth's path. = Spacecraft reentries = His research also includes artificial meteors. An overview of ongoing missions can be found at: . Jenniskens is the principal investigator of NASA's Genesis and Stardust Entry Observing Campaigns to study the fiery return from interplanetary space of the Genesis (Sep. 2004), Stardust (Jan. 2006), and Hayabusa (June 2010) sample return capsules. The beautiful reentry of JAXA's Hayabusa probe over Australia on 13 June 2010 also included the disintegrating main spacecraft. These airborne missions studied what physical conditions the protective heat shield endured during the reentry before being recovered. More recently, Jenniskens led a mission to study the destructive entry of ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle \\"Jules Verne\\" on 29 September 2008, Orbital ATK's Cygnus OA6 reentry on 22 June 2016, and the spectacular daytime re-entry of space debris object WT1190F near Sri-Lanka to practice a future observation of an impacting asteroid.  Small asteroid impacts and meteorite recovery  = fragments recovery = The recovery of fragments of asteroid marked the first time fragments had been found from an object that was previously tracked in outer space before hitting Earth. This search was led by Peter Jenniskens and Muawia Shaddad of the University of Khartoum in Sudan, and carried out with help from students and staff of the University of Khartoum. The search of the impact zone began on December 6, 2008 and turned up of rocks in about 600 fragments. This also proved the first well documented recovery of many different meteorite types from a single fall. = Sutter's Mill = The next biggest impact over land occurred in California's gold country on April 22, 2012. One of the fragments landed at Sutter's Mill, the very site where gold was first discovered in 1848 that led to the California Gold Rush. Jenniskens found one of three fragments of this CM chondrite on April 24, before rains hit the area. The rapid recovery was made possible because Doppler weather radar detected the falling meteorites. A consortium study led by Jenniskens traced these meteorites back to a source region in the asteroid belt: a family of asteroids that move at low inclination and are close to the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter.These were the first CM chondrites to be recovered from near the surface of the original parent body before it broke up, creating the asteroid family.

The first Novato meteorite, a L6 type chondrite fragmental breccia, was found by Novato resident Lisa Webber following Jenniskens' publication of the trajectory of the fireball from video recorded by stations of his Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance project (CAMS).P.

Over 50 villages were visited to map the extent of the glass damage. Traffic video records were collected to map the shock wave arrival times. In order to determine the meteoroid entry speed and angle, star background calibration images were taken and shadow obstacle dimensions were measured at sites where video cameras recorded the fireball and its shadows. Eyewitnesses were interviewed to learn about injuries, heat sensations, sunburn, smells and where meteorites were found. Meteorites found shortly after the fall by Chelyabinsk State University colleagues were analyzed and the results from this consortium study were published in Science. O.P. Popova, P.

Polo Margarite√±o =Lyrical form= The Polo from Margarita is sung in octosyllabic or hendecasyllabic verses with varying rhyme schemes. Typically the stanzas are composed of four verses, and common rhyme schemes include ABAB and ABBA. Traditionally, however, the polo, like the malague√±a and galer√≥n has been sung in d√©cima form, that is, ten verses of eight syllables each, with an \\"ABBAACCDDC\\" rhyme scheme. It is typical for each verse in the polo to be sung twice, which has lent to it being sung as a duet on occasion. The theme of the polo's lyrics are typically centered around life in the island of Margarita and the states of Sucre, and Anzo√°tegui. As a result, the imagery and habits of coastal life are frequently the subject of the polo, as evidenced by the following stanza: { - valign=top  :Yo fui marino y que en una isla : de una culisa me enamor√© : y en una noche de mucha brisa : en mi falucho me la rob√©. } The theme of love is also common in polos, both as isolated stanzas and as the main focus of the text. Some artists who illustrate the romantically-oriented polo include Gualberto Ibarreto and the quartet Serenata Guayanesa. An excerpt of the \\"Polo de la soledad\\"Ivan P√©rez Rossi, anonymous. Canciones Venezolanas, Sonografica, 1989 (Polo of solitude) by Serenata reads as follows: { - valign=top  :Quiero ser la soledad : porque solo estoy contigo : Si estoy solo, eres mi abrigo : y solo te quiero m√°s. } =Harmony= The harmonic structure cycles between an initial major key and its relative minor. The basic progression can be described as III(I)-VII(V7)-i-V7 (the Roman numerals in parentheses represent chord functions in the initial major key). This basic harmonic form evidences the origins of the polo in the Spanish Renaissance, as the progression is known as the Romanesca. This basic version has been recorded by Cecilia Todd. A more common elaboration of the harmony would be III(I)-VII7(V7)-V7-i-iv-V7-i-VII7(V7). This version has been recorded by a great many artists ranging from Soledad Bravo to Francisco Mata, among others.

She finished her undergraduate degree in 1880, edited the Overland Monthly from 1882 to 1894, and received her Ph.D. in 1898. Early life Milicent Washburn Shinn was born in Vallejo's Mills (later known as the town of Niles, California and now a district of Fremont, California), on April 15, 1858, the daughter of James Shinn and Lucy Ellen Clark. Her father worked as a modest farmer, and her mother was the owner of a orchard-tree nursery. Shinn was one of seven children, however, four of her siblings passed away at a young age. Shinn's parents sent Milicent and her older brother Charles Howard Shinn to the University of California, Berkeley, which had only started admitting women the year prior in 1873. Her brother was a horticulturalist and forest ranger, while her cousin Edmund Clark Sanford was a prominent psychologist. Shinn helped take care of her brother's daughter Ruth, who would coincidentally be the main focus of Shinn's studies. Career She was active as a writer, editor, scientist and research worker; she was the first woman to receive Ph. D. degree from University of California. Following her undergraduate graduation from the University of California, Berkeley, Shinn began work as an editor for the Overland Monthly. Her first published essay was \\"Thirty Miles\\" which depicted what she would see on her journey home. Shinn believed in the power of the press and thought that contributing to the literature of California would help aid in reducing the social woes that had arisen following the end of the American Civil War. Shinn is well known in the Psychology community for her published Doctoral Dissertation \\"Notes on the Development of a Child (1898).\\" Additionally, Shinn's personal observational work prior to her doctorate program, \\"The First Two Years of the Child\\" was considered the first of its kind. Her research focused specifically on observing the emotional and psychical health of her niece and her progression over the first two years of her life. This was the first extensive documentation of a child's upbringing and was thought to be incredibly valuable to the field of child psychology. Shinn was convinced by her companions to pursue a doctoral degree in child psychology, which led to her resignation from the Overland Monthly in 1894 and her return to the University of California, Berkeley as a doctoral candidate. She was a member of the Society of Mayflower Descendants, the American Academy of Science, the Phi Beta Kappa, the American Eugenics Society, the Alumni Association of the University of California, the Save the Redwoods League, the League of Nations Association. Personal life She was a lifelong resident of California. Her life followed the path of academia, but family matters, described as the Family Claim, limited the amount of time she could invest in her personal aspirations. Given this limitation, Shinn capitalized on her surroundings making Ruth the center of her work. There is no record of Shinn having any intimate relationships, and there is no record of her having any children of her own. Lilian Bridgman designed her home that was located on her family's property in Niles. After retirement, she lived very quietly at home for over a quarter of a century at Niles, California where she passed away at the age of 82.  Family Claim  Women such as Millicent in the 1900s often experienced what scholars currently refer to as the family claim and sisterhood. These two concepts describe the household values held by the majority of families in North America during this time period. Females of all ages were understood to have an obligation to the family. This created a toxic environment that severely limited the social mobility of the individuals and limited the options for personal growth and expression. > \\"Scarborough and Furumoto used Shinn as an example of ‚Äúthe family claim‚Äù‚Äîthe > career limitations women faced in terms of their family obligations.\\" Despite the perceived notion that Shinn would be restrained by the family claim and her duty to her family, she was able to continue her work in the field of child psychology. Shinn did not let societal restrictions hold her back and pursued her efforts to collect data from her network of home- observers. Her network consisted of college educated mothers who helped serve as observers of their own children which provided Shinn with much meaningful data. This unique approach to in-home data collection led Shinn to produce her powerful piece titled The Development of the Senses in the First Three Years of Childhood.  The Overland Monthly  The Overland Monthly, the newspaper Shinn joined at age 25, was based in California and produced its first series of works in the year 1868. The newspaper, which maintained the same ownership throughout its existence, changed titles over the years 1868 to1935. In a paper in the Overland Monthly, during the year July, 1898, Shinn reflected on her years as editor, 1883‚Äì1894. She talks about how the world's attention at the time was fixated on the Gold Rush that took place in California.

She was the mother of Emperor Xuan of Western Liang (Xiao Cha) who founded the Western Liang with the support of Western Wei. Lady Gong was a concubine of Xiao Tong, the first crown prince of Liang dynasty's founder Emperor Wu. Her rank was the second rank for a concubine of the crown prince, Baolin (‰øùÊûó). She gave birth to Xiao Cha in 519. (It is not known whether any of Xiao Tong's other four known sons were her sons as well, although his oldest son Xiao Huan (Ëï≠Ê≠°) was not, as he was the son of Xiao Tong's wife Crown Princess Cai.) Little is known about her background, including her birth family, and Xiao Cha himself appeared to be closer to Crown Princess Cai's nephew Cai Dabao (Ëî°Â§ßÂØ∂) than he was with any cousins he might have had through his mother. Historical references to Lady Gong were not numerous. In 549, while Liang was in a state of disarray after the fall of the capital Jiankang to the rebel general Hou Jing and the imperial princes were battling each other, Xiao Cha, then the Prince of Yueyang, was leading an army against his uncle Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong to try to save his brother Xiao Yu (Ëï≠Ë≠Ω) the Prince of Hedong (whom Xiao Yi's forces were besieging), when he left his headquarters Xiangyang in the hands of Cai Dabao and Lady Gong (who was at that time still referred to as Baolin, not as princess dowager), and they defended the city against a surprise attack by the general Du An (ÊùúÂ≤∏), who served under Xiao Cha but had defected to Xiao Yi. When Xiao Cha retreated at night, Lady Gong, unaware of his military failure, mistook him for enemy; only until the next morning she realized him and let him in. Subsequently, in order to fend of Xiao Yi's attacks, Xiao Cha became a Western Wei vassal and was created the Prince of Liang. In 555, after Western Wei forces had defeated and killed Xiao Yi, Western Wei created Xiao Cha the emperor of (Western) Liang (as Emperor Xuan). While Emperor Xuan posthumously honored Xiao Tong as an emperor and Xiao Tong's wife Crown Princess Cai as an empress, he honored his mother as an empress dowager. After he died in 562 and was succeeded by his son Xiao Kui (as Emperor Ming), Emperor Ming honored her as grand empress dowager. She died about three months after her son.

Description It is a medium-sized moth with clubbed antennae. The clubbed antennae are a notable feature of Synemon plana; most other moths have brushy antennae. The golden sun moth appears on the list of Australian critically endangered fauna. The golden sun moth is synonymous with Austrodanthonia species of grasses and is almost confined to grasslands which are home to these grass species. At least a 40% cover of Austrodanthonia species is optimal for the species. Male Synemon plana are dull in colour, the forewings consisting of dark brown, patterned with pale grey and the hind wings are brown with darker brown patches. Female Synemon plana are brighter in colour with the forewings of brown and grey patterns, the forewings are a bright golden brown colouring with dark brown patches on the outer margin of the hindwings. This golden colouring gives Synemon plana its common name, the golden sun moth. Female Synemon plana are generally flightless, with small hindwings in comparison to the male. Life cycle Synemon plana larva The life cycle of the golden sun moth is relatively well understood. Longevity is estimated to be about two years (Edwards 1994), however, genetic evidence suggests that generation time may actually be 12 months (Clarke 1999). After mating, it is believed that the females lay up to 200 eggs at the base of the Austrodanthonia tussocks. The eggs hatch after 21 days. The larvae tunnel underground where they remain feeding on grass roots before digging a vertical tunnel to the surface where the pupa remains for six weeks until the adult moths emerge. The immature stages of the golden sun moth have not yet been described. Possible variation in the length of the larval stage of the golden sun moth may create the flexibility needed for a population to survive harsh years (Edwards 1993). When females emerge from the tunnel as adults, they already possess fully developed eggs (Edwards 1993), and begin to search for a mate, flashing the vivid orange hindwings to attract any males flying overhead (Clarke & Spier 2003). Adults only live for two to five days, as they cannot feed (Edwards 1993). See also * Threatened fauna of Australia References *Department of Environment and Heritage.

Focusing on trends in energy supply and demand, this text provides students with a comprehensive account of the subject and an understanding of how to use data analysis and modeling to make future projections and study climate impacts. Developments in technology and policy are discussed in depth, including the role of coal, the fracking revolutions for oil and gas, the electricity grid, wind and solar power, battery storage, and biofuels. Trends in demand are also detailed, with analysis of industrial demands such as LEDs, air conditioning, heat pumps, and information technology, and the transportation demands of railroads, ships, and cars (including electric vehicles). The environmental impacts of the energy industry are considered throughout, and a full chapter is dedicated to climate change. Real-life case studies and examples add context. Professor Rutledge is also the author of The Electronics of Radio, a book published by Cambridge University Press, as well as author or co-author of numerous other publications. This book provides an introduction to analog electronics by analyzing the design and construction of a radio transceiver. Essential theoretical background is provided at each step, along with carefully designed laboratory and homework exercises. The goal of this approach is to ensure a good grasp of basic electronics as well as an excellent foundation in wireless communications systems. The book begins with a thorough description of basic electronic components and simple circuits. Next, the key elements of radio electronics, including filters, amplifiers, oscillators, mixers, and antennas are described. In the laboratory exercises, the reader is led through the design, construction, and testing of a popular radio transceiver (the NorCal 40A), thereby illustrating and reinforcing the theoretical material. This book, the first to deal with elementary electronics in the context of radio, is often used as a textbook for introductory analog electronics courses, or for more advanced undergraduate classes on radio frequency electronics. It may also be of interest to electronics hobbyists and radio enthusiasts.

Its ancient names are Baligrama, Dakshina Kedara, Valliggame and Valligrame. Dakshina Kedara means Kedarnath of the South. A place of antiquity, it is known for its ancient monuments. Balligavi is located 72 km from Shivamogga city and 21 km from Shikaripura town and 2.3 km from Shiralakoppa in Shikaripura taluk. in Kannada means creeper or vine. Archaeologically, Balligavi dates from the Satavahana- Kadamba era and the Chaturmukha linga (four faced linga) here is in that style. The area came under the Banavasi province of the Kadamba Dynasty in 4-5th century AD. Important Kadamba inscriptions like the Talagunda inscriptions, near Balligavi have been collected by the Archaeological Survey of India.The Talagunda inscription gives the most plausible explanation to the birth of the Kadamba kingdom and the reasons surrounding the coronation of Mayurasharma as the founder of the kingdom, Dr. S.U. Kamath, Concise history of Karnataka pp 30 Golden age The golden age of Balligavi was during the rule of the Western Chalukya Empire during the 10th-12th centuries. The earliest inscription mentioning the name Balligavi is a 685 CE Badami Chalukya inscription. Balligavi during these times had six mathas, three puras \\"extensions\\", five vidyapithas \\"places of learning\\", and seven Brahmapuris. The mathas belonged to Shaivas, Vaishnavas, Jainas and Buddhists. The Kedareshwara matha belonging to the Kalamukha Shaivas and the Kodiya matha was well known and had the patronage of the Hoysala emperors, marking the place as one of religious activity. Records also indicate that an ancient University existed here. The town also had 54 temples and supported 60,000 residents during that time. Several Inscriptions reveas that it was very prominent and stronghold capital of the Vira Bananju warrior merchant community, i.e. modern day Banajigara or Banajiga or Balija community. Today, Balligavi is a quiet town much of whose daily routines revolve around agriculture and the famous 11th century Kedaresvara Temple and Tripurantakesvara Temple. Legend Legend has it that Balligavi was the capital of an Asura king (demon) and hence was called Balipura (city of Bali). The Pandavas came here while on their Vanavasa (forest sojourn) and installed the Panchalinga (five lingas); hence the name Panchalingeswara to the well known temple here. Linga is the universal symbol of Shiva. Personalities Balligavi is also the birthplace of the great Virashaiva saint Allama Prabhu and is closely associated with Vachana poet Akka Mahadevi who was born in nearby Udugani (also known as Udutadi). She was a contemporary of Allama Prabhu and Basavanna, the founder of the Virashaiva movement. Balligavi is also the birthplace of Shantala Devi, queen of Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana. Many famous Hoysala sculptors like Dasoja, Malloja, Nadoja, Siddoja hailed from here.  Kedaresvara Temple  Another view of Kedareshvara temple at Balligavi Vimana with Kirtimukha (demon face), Kedaresvara temple, Balligavi This is an excellent example of a trikuta \\"triple towers\\" temple in a transitional Western Chalukya-Hoysala architecture.Most Hoysala temples are either ekakuta (one tower), dvikuta (two tower) or trikuta, A Complete Guide to Hoysala Temples, Gerard Foekema, pp 25 It is the oldest example of such a combinational style in Karnataka according to reports from the Mysore archaeological department. The temple faces east and has a stepped entrance on three sides. The entrance on the sides is a Western Chalukya idiom.According to Dr. S.U. Kamath, A Concise History of Karnataka, pp 116 The central shrine has a linga (universal symbol of Shiva) made from black marble (Krishnashila). The shrine to the south has a linga called Brahma and the shrine to the north has a statue of Janardhana (Vishnu). The temple's outside plan is in \\"staggered-square\\" style with many projections and recesses which is a Hoysala design.According to Gerard Foekema, A Complete Guide to Hoysala Temples, pp 21 The outer walls of the open mandapa (hall) have carvings of women wearing fine jewellery. Two Hoysala emblems were added in 1060 CE by Vinayaditya.The Hoysala emblem depicts Sala, the mythical founder of the empire fighting a Tiger, according to historians C. Hayavadhana Rao, J. D. M. Derrett, B. R Joshi, Sala was a mythical founder of the empire, A Concise history of Karnataka pp 123, Dr. S.U. Kamath, The superstructure (tower) of the vimana are very well decorated with sculptures of Tandaveshwara, Varaha, Uma Narasimha, Bhairava etc. (avatars of Shiva and Vishnu) and the sukanasi of all three towers still exist.The sukanasi is the tower on top of vestibule connecting hall and shrine and this is where the hoysala emblem is located, Gerard Foekema, A Complete Guide to Hoysala Temples pp 22 The western shrine is the oldest dating from the 7th or 8th century. Attached to the vestibule that connects the shrines is a well designed open mantapa with two rows of pillars. The outer row of pillars are 16 faced while the inner row of pillars are lathe turned with bell shaped mouldings, a style popular with both Western Chalukys and Hoysalas.This is a common feature of Western Chalukya-Hoysala temples, A Concise History of Karnataka, pp 117, Dr. S.U. Kamath The ceiling of the mantapa is flat and the inner ceiling is well carved with lotuses in them. The central ceiling has the carving of Tandaveshwara (dancing Shiva) with eight dikpalakas (guards). The entrance to the shrine which faces east has a Nandi, the bull and a celestial attendant of Shiva.  Tripurantaka Temple  The 'Tripurantaka Temple (also called Tripurantakesvara or Tripurantakeshwara) was built around c. 1070 CE by the Western Chalukyas. This temple, which is in a dilapidated state, is in the historically important town of Balligavi (also called Balagamve), modern Shivamogga district, Karnataka state, India. The exterior walls of the temple have erotic sculptures on friezes. These depictions are considered rare in Chalukyan art. Being miniature in size, these are visible only upon close examination.Cousens (1926), p. 107 During medieval times, Balligavi was a seat of learning to multiple religious faiths and was home to many monuments and structures built by the Chalukyas. More than 80 medieval inscriptions have been discovered in Balligavi and belong to the Hindu (Shaiva, Vaishnava), Jain and Buddhist traditions. These inscriptions describe, among other things, the building of temples.Cousens (1926), p. 108  Notes   References  * Gerard Foekema, A Complete Guide To Hoysala Temples, 1996, Abhinav, * Dr. Suryanath U.
