In addition to the original research, reviews, and commentary submitted to the journal, The Archives publishes the abstracts to the ACRM Annual Conference each year. The ACRM is an organization of rehabilitation professionals dedicated to serving people with disabling conditions by supporting research that promotes health, independence, productivity, and quality of life; and meets the needs of rehabilitation clinicians and people with disabilities. ACRM's current President is Pamela Roberts. ACRM's CEO is Jon Lindberg. The journal is edited by Leighton Chan and Allen W. Heinemann. The Deputy Editor is Helen Hoenig. Awards Sidney Licht was a longtime member of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and was its president in 1967‚Äì68. He was the editor of the Physical Medicine Library, which was published by his wife, Elizabeth. The Licht award originated in March 1979 with its first award presented to Carl Granger, Gary Albrecht, and Byron Hamilton for their article \\"Outcomes of Comprehensive Medical Rehabilitation: Measurement by PULSES Profile and the Barthel Index\\". The award is given every year for the best scientific article published in Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation during the previous year. History *1918: The Journal of Roentgenology is launched. *1920: The Journal of Radiology is launched, superseding Journal of Roentgenology. *1926: The journal changed its name from the Journal of Radiology to the Archives of Physical Therapy, X-ray, Radium, and was declared the official journal of the American Congress of Physical Therapy. *1930: Albert F. Tyler, MD, presented the Archives to the American Congress of Physical Therapy as a debt-free, unencumbered gift. *1938: The journal name was shortened to Archives of Physical Therapy given the decreased emphasis on X-ray and radium among physicians using physical modalities. *1939: The Society of Physical Therapy Physicians was formed, the forerunner of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPM&R;). The Archives was designated as its official journal. *1945: The name of the journal became the Archives of Physical Medicine. The term \\"physical medicine\\" represented a change of emphasis from the purely clinical to the scientific and diagnostic basis of the medical use of physical agents. It also served to clarify the distinction between physicians and technicians of physical therapy, a stance the American Medical Association had recently adopted. *1952: Increasing recognition of the relationship between physical medicine and the rapidly growing field of rehabilitation resulted in a name change from the American Congress of Physical Therapy, to the American Congress of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. *1953: The official name of the journal changed to its present name, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. *1966: The official name of the Congress was changed once again, to the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM). *1973: ACRM and AAPM&R; executed an agreement whereby both organizations shared responsibility for the journal. This formalized a long period whereby AAPM&R; designated Archives its official journal. *1986: AAPM&R; and the ACRM entered into formal shared ownership of the Archives. *2009: AAPM&R; relinquishes co-ownership of the Archives. The ACRM is the sole owner again. *2010: The Archives surpasses 1,000 submissions per year. *2012: The Archives surpasses 1,500 submissions per year. *2013: The Archives undergoes a redesign, taking its new design from the redesigned ACRM logo. The overlapping petals of the lotus flower visually communicate the interdisciplinary nature of Archives and the culture of ACRM. The seeds of the lotus, much like Archives and ACRM, remain viable for many, many years. The lotus is also a symbol of rebirth, rising from dark and muddy waters; the ACRM community and the research published in Archives aim to bring about new beginnings for people affected by disabling conditions. Leighton Chan, MD, MPH, FACRM and Allen Heinemann, Ph.D., ABPP (FACRM) begin their term as co- Editors-in-Chief of the Archives. *2014: The Archives introduces the mandatory use of Reporting Guidelines from the Equator Network. *2017: Marks the debut of RehabCast, the official podcast of the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Hosted by Ford Vox, MD, RehabCast is the PM&R; podcast for all of rehabilitation medicine: physiatry, occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech-language pathology, neuropsychology, rehabilitation nursing, and more. *2018: The Archives welcomed the Archives of Rehabilitation Research and Clinical Translation (ARRCT), ACRM's open-access journal serving the rehabilitation research community. The founding Editor-in-Chief is Jeffrey R. Basford, MD, Ph.D., past Editor-in-Chief of the Archives. ARRCT is the open- access companion journal to the Archives and is published online by Elsevier. *2020: The Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, ACRM's flagship journal, celebrates its 100th year of continual publication.

It flowed around the districts of Martini and Tiefer, flanking the Market Square The Balge (also known as the Balje)Balge or Balje Low German means ‚Äúflowing body of water‚Äù, ‚Äúwaterway‚Äù or ‚Äútrench‚Äù. was a short branch of the Weser on its eastern side, running through what is now the centre of Bremen. As it served as a harbour in the early Middle Ages, it significantly contributed to Bremen's development as a port. The river gradually narrowed until in 1608, it was canalised. In 1838, it was completely filled with earth.  Early Middle Ages  At the time when the diocese was founded, the low-lying land around Bremen was swampy with several islands formed by the Weser and its branches. In 1988/1989 construction work involving excavations at the corner of Martinistrasse and Wachtstrasse revealed three small waterway channels from around the year 800 in an area of . There was also a river boat from the 9th century. From the 9th century onwards, the terrain changed significantly, partly as a result of floods which brought sand into the area, partly through increased human settlement. Gradually, the marshes and the river's minor branches disappeared. The Balge, together with the Kleine Weser (Little Weser), was one such branch. The theory that the Balge might at some time have been the main stream of the Weser has never been proven. Originally, the Balge left the Weser at Altenwall. In a bend stretching over some , it ran almost parallel to the main river along the Bremer D√ºne. It became separated from the Weser by some at the Marktplatz before rejoining it and opening up like a funnel at the ‚ÄúZweite Schlachtpforte‚Äù. The island between the Schlachte and the Weser covered roughly today's Martini and Tiefer districts. Originally, the width of the Balge varied from about .  First port of Bremen  When the diocese of Bremen was founded in the 8th century, the site for cathedral and bishop's residence was chosen at the point of contact of the two most important geographical features of the area: the Weser and the ‚ÄúBremer D√ºne‚Äù (Bremen Dune). The Weser opened the way to the long distance trade routes while the Dune offered protection against floods and enemy attacks. Bremen's first harbour was located along the north bank of the Balge. It is assumed that ships moored on both sides of the Balge, over a stretch of several hundred metres. The Langenstra√üe, one of the city's oldest streets and one of the most important streets for the city's merchants, no doubt originated at the time when one of the first settlements grew up on the right bank of the Balge. In 13th century sea vessels became too large for the Balge. On the bank of main Weser river a new quay was built, called Schlachte. Since then the importance of the old Balge harbour decreased. Nevertheless, both harbours were used until the 16th century, the Schlachte for sea-going ships and the Balge for flat-bottomed vessels and river barges.Hill (2004), 265 Finally in 1602, the Balge was closed for traffic of boats. The Balge's banks were subsequently reinforced in several stages. When excavations were carried out in 1970 at the Bankhaus Neelmeyer (close to where the B√∂ttcherstrasse joins the Marktplatz), remains of the harbour sides, fortified with masonry, together with dolphins, were found. The dolphins were made from oak piles tied together with iron rings in groups of three. Similar discoveries had already been made in 1909 at the corner of Marktplatz and Langenstrasse and in 1862 near the Sch√ºtting and Wachtstrasse. Evidence of an even older structure was found: a bank reinforcement made from piles and wickerwork, presumably built before the 10th century. The other structures consisting of stone and brick are assumed to have been made in medieval or late medieval times (between 11th and 15th centuries). The market place probably stems for its role as a harbour-side market, with ships mooring along its south bank.  Medieval and late medieval period  While the Balge had originally been quite wide, it narrowed over time as a result of buildings constructed on its banks as the city developed combined with changes in the river network and silting. In late medieval times, the width of the Balge had been reduced to some . Otherwise it would not have been possible to erect the Sch√ºtting where there had once been a river bed. In the 13th century after the Balge had already ceased to serve as a harbour for larger ships (which were moored instead at the Schlachte), an artificial channel was constructed between the Balge and the Weser, designed to improve the flow of water between the two rivers. Until then, the Balge had gradually been filled with sand and refuse. After the channel was established, the upper portion of the Balge was known as ‚ÄúKlosterbalge‚Äù and the lower part, ‚ÄúGrosse Balge‚Äù. In order to improve the city's defences, the channel into the upper portion of the Balge was closed, making it impossible to be penetrated by enemy forces. The ‚ÄúKlosterbalge‚Äù became a dead end, receiving rain and waste water only from the adjacent buildings. But at that time, the ‚ÄúGrosse Balge‚Äù was still used by ships. In 1399, the council of Bremen ruled in a decree called ‚ÄúBalgeverordnung‚Äù that so-called ‚ÄúEken‚Äù (flat river boats made of oak with a width of approximately 1,50 meters and a length between 3,50 to 10 meters) could no longer moor in the Balge for more than three days and three nights as they would otherwise present an obstacle to boat traffic. In 1602, the Balge was closed to boats. In 1608, a channel with a width of was established specifically for drainage. In 1819, the Senate of Bremen decided that the Balge should be filled in over its entire length and that it should be replaced by a waste water channel in width. As a result of formal objections relating to specific rights and competing interests of the Balge residents, work was not completed until 1838 when the Balge completely disappeared from the City of Bremen.  Bridges  From medieval times, several bridges crossed the Balge: * The Gro√üe Stintbr√ºcke (mentioned in documents as Pontis Piscium from 1261). It crossed the Balge from the south- east corder of the Marktplatz. * The Kleine Stintbr√ºcke connected Hakenstrasse and Bredenstrasse. * The Balgebr√ºcke was the connection between the two parts of the Balgebr√ºckstrasse. * The Hohe Br√ºcke crossed the vlootgote at the Tiefer. * A stone bridge served as a link for both ends of the Wachtstrasse. * A bridge crossed the Klosterbalge at St. Victors Staven at the Tiefer. * The Sch√ºttingbr√ºcke crossed the Balge as part of B√∂ttcherstrasse. * It is assumed that there was another bridge crossing the Balge at the point where it was connected to the Weser river at the second Schlachtpforte. The bridges were probably drawbridges enabling ships and boats to sail past even if the water level was high. All the bridges continued to be exist until the end of the 18th century. They were gradually dismantled after the Balge was filled in.  Lasting traces  Indication of the previous course of the Balge at the Stint bridge Statue ‚ÄúFietje Balge‚Äù by Bernd Altenstein From 1990/1991 onwards, the original route of the Balge was indicated in several parts of the old town by means of bronze plaques and by a different kind of paving. This was done on the recommendation of Senator Harald Lucht, head of cadastral services (today GeoInformation Bremen).Documented in the map Grundri√ü der Kaiserl. Freien Reichs und Handels Stadt Bremen by C. L. Murtfeldt from the year 1796 The Balge appears as a narrow channel from the 18th century, at the Schlachte, at the Stintbr√ºcke, at the Wachtstrasse and at the Balgebr√ºckstrasse where the junction between Grosse Balge and Klosterbalge is indicated. In addition, several street names are reminiscent of the Balge and its original route: * Stintbr√ºcke: leads from the corner of Langenstrasse / Marktplatz to the Bredenstrasse, passing the Sch√ºtting * Balgebr√ºckstrasse: connects Domsheide with Wilhelm-Kaisen-Br√ºcke * Hinter der Balge: a narrow street branching off from the Marterburg in Schnoor A bronze sculpture Fietje Balge by the sculptor Bernd Altenstein donated in 2007 by Bankhaus Carl F. Plump & Co. was erected in the street Hinter dem Sch√ºtting, near the Spitzen Gebel tavern, in memory of the Balge. A nearby plaque explains the history of the Balge and a QRpedia code links to this article.Plaque about Balge, Wikimedia commons, retrieved 17 January 2014  New discoveries  In the beginning of 2008, there were excavations on Bredenplatz, at the corner of Bredenstrasse and Martinistrasse, where a new hotel was to be built. They revealed the remains of the Balge river bank reinforcements, dated to around the year 1000. The structure consisted of wood piles, horizontal boards and wicker work. Findings also included objects lost in mud, including a silver denarius (a coin from Cologne), a dagger, a silver fibula and a pair of ice skates made from bones. In 2009, repair work took place in the Schifferhaus Shipper's House in Bremen. The bank reinforcement of the Klosterbalge was investigated which, like the Grosse Balge, had served as an underground waste water channel.Report in Weser-Kurier, 13 February 2009, page 11, and in the television broadcast buten & binnen, 12 February 2009 at 19:45 hours.

From a height of approx 40m above NAP, the Aue flows through the so-called Bremen Switzerland in the lowland meadows around the castle . Here the stream carved the Auetal (Aue valley), which is a major recreational area for the population of . Not far after the Aue reaches Bremen territory, it flows into a pond, which on one side forms a crescent around Schloss Sch√∂nebeck, and on the other side used to serve as the water source for a now-disused water mill. At the old mill today, there is only a weir, which regulates the water level in the Schlossteich (castle pond). Downstream from the weir, the Aue flows through Bremen suburbs Sch√∂nebeck (belongs to Bremen-Vegesack) und Bremen-Vegesack, then for a short way through fields, before reaching another residential area.

In 2007 a redirection of the Aue around the weir was initiated. This involved a small, naturalistically-formed canal, which leads the stream in a crescent around the weir and was laid out by conservationist volunteers. The mouth of the Aue was modified several years ago with a stone embankment, through which the migrating fish can still pass. For years before that, the \\"opening\\" of the Aue into a harbor basin near to Vegesack railway station was a controversial discussion point in Bremen communal politics.

The clashes resulted in dozens killed and wounded on both sides, with hundreds of displaced Kurdish villagers. The exact numbers of casualties on each side are a matter of controversy.

She is a prominent figure as a lesbian cross-disciplinary artist, whose work employs conceptualism, surrealism, and craft to address feminist and class issues. Her most notable work is characterized as site-specific installations of web-like structure crocheted from domestic and industrial material, although she works with sculpture and drawing as well. She has shown in museums and art galleries throughout the United States. Pepe's installations are made linear elements such as string, rope, shoelaces, and industrial rubber bands. They are the result of a process she has called \\"improvisational crochet.\\"Ryan, Dinah. \\"Sheila Pepe: Risking Reference, Allowing Allusion.\\" Sculpture, September 2004, p.20-21. http://www.sheilapepe.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/08/PepeSheila_ScultureMag9.2004_Focus.pdf As a Lesbian Feminist (and one-time Lesbian Separatist in the 1980s), Pepe emphasizes that her work is influenced by the work of women before her. She cites Judy Chicago's The Dinner Party and Eva Hesse's Hang Up as formative influences on her practice. Education Pepe received her BA in 1981 at Alberta Magnus College in New Haven, CT, followed shortly by a BFA in ceramics at Massachusetts School of Art, Boston, in 1983. She studied blacksmithing at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, Deer Isle, Maine, in 1984. In 1994 she received a fellowship to attend the Skowhegan school of Painting and Sculpture, Skowhegan, Maine, completed her MFA at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1995. Life and work While earning her BFA, she participated in the Boston feminist and lesbian communities, while working at the restaurant Beetle's Lunch. In 1983, she moved to rural Western Massachusetts and was involved with folk artists and feminist activists such as Diana Davies and Kady Van Duers.Pepe, Sheila. http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/gallery/sheila_pepe.php In 1985, she began working as a gallery guard at Smith College Museum in Northampton, MA. In 1986 she was awarded a position as the NEA Curatorial Intern and continued working there as a preparer's assistant, under David Dempsey, until 1989. Pepe made little work during the mid-1980s, but in 1988 while working with art at Smith College, she began to sew dolls, which were shown and sold in Northampton. In 1992, she began her MFA work at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, exploring video, performance, and sculpture comprising a highly feminist practice. During this time, an ongoing project called the \\"Doppelganger Series\\" was begun. This prompted her first solo show was at 88 Room in the Allston Mall, Allston, MA in 1994. Work From the Doppelganger Series consisted of constructions or assemblages whose shadows cast on the wall serve as prompts for wall drawings. This process draws from the Surrealist automatic drawing exercise, exquisite corpse. Pepe's break into the art world began with inclusion into a 1996 group exhibition of Boston Area Artists at Rose Art Museum and in \\"Gothic: Transmutations of Horror in Late 20th Century Art\\" at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston in Boston in 1997. Her more recent work can be exemplified by her installation \\"Mind the Gap\\", 2005, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. \\"Mind the Gap\\" was a site-specific sculptural work responding to the architecture of the gallery where shoelaces and nautical toe-line were intertwined and webbed throughout the space. This work instigated a dialogue between domestic and industrial materials and responded to a 1982 installation \\"Boa\\" by Judy Pfaff in the same place.Author unknown, University of Massachusetts Amherst Website.

From 2007 to 2020 he served as Director of the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection. His scholarship has focused on the literature, especially in Latin, of the Middle Ages. In the United States, he was elected a Member of the Medieval Academy of America in 2008, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2010, and the American Philosophical Society in 2017.https://web.archive.org/web/20170915195158/https://amphilsoc.org/members/electedApril2017 Abroad, he was appointed a corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 2006 and of the Academia Europaea in 2015. In 2015 he was awarded an Austrian Decoration for Science and Art, the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art, First Class. He held a National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Stipend in 1983, an American Council for Learned Societies Fellowship in 1986, and a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in 1987-1988. In 2005-2006 he was a Fellow-in-Residence at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study. Since becoming U.S. representative to the International Medieval Latin Committee in 1988, he has served as Vice President from 1993-1999 and as President from 2000. Personal life Born in New Haven, Connecticut, he is the son of Theodore Ziolkowski, a Germanist and comparativist, and Yetta (n√©e Goldstein) Ziolkowski. Career Like the rest of his family, Jan Ziolkowski received his primary and secondary education in public schools, the last one being Princeton High School in New Jersey, from which he graduated in 1974. He earned his A.B. summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1977 and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. His senior thesis, supervised by the Classicist Janet Martin and the Chaucerian and medievalist D. W. Robertson Jr., was published in revised form as a monograph in 1985 as Alan of Lille‚Äôs Grammar of Sex: The Meaning of Grammar to a Twelfth Century Intellectual. From 1977 through 1980 he was a Marshall Scholar at the University of Cambridge. In 1980-1981 he was a Fellow at the American Academy in Rome. In 1982 he received his Ph.D. in medieval Latin, under the direction of the late Peter Dronke. Ziolkowski began teaching at Harvard University in 1981, at the age of twenty- four. In his initial year he held the rank of instructor: he had submitted his dissertation in the spring of 1981, but could not take his viva until December or have the degree confirmed until the spring of 1982. Thus he acquired formal standing as an assistant professor in 1982. In 1984 he was promoted to associate professor. In 1987 he received tenure as a full professor, at thirty. For his first two decades of service at Harvard, his appointment was split between Classics and Comparative Literature. He became involved early in the Committees on Folklore and Mythology and on Medieval Studies. In administrative service, he served three terms as chair of the Department of Comparative Literature and concurrently two as chair of the Committee on Medieval Studies. In 2006‚Äì2007 he chaired the Department of Classics for one year. From 2007 through 2020, Ziolkowski directed the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, a Harvard institution for advanced research in Byzantine, Pre-Columbian, and Garden and Landscape studies. Publications Ziolkowski‚Äôs books include wide-ranging explorations of literary and intellectual history. The first, published in 1985 by the Medieval Academy of America, was Alan of Lille‚Äôs Grammar of Sex: The Meaning of Grammar to a Twelfth Century Intellectual. This monograph marked a first step into the scrutiny of language and literature relating to sexuality and obscenity, notably a later study of a poem about the biblical figure Jezebel and a collective volume of essays, which came out in 1998, entitled Obscenity: Social Control and Artistic Creation in the European Middle Ages. His later investigations include examinations of Medieval Latin literature associated with folk literature, such as Talking Animals: Medieval Latin Beast Poetry, in 1993, and Fairy Tales from Before Fairy Tales: The Medieval Latin Past of Wonderful Lies, in 2007. Both studies are notable for extensive appendixes of translations. His second book was the editio princeps of Nigel of Canterbury, Miracles of the Virgin Mary, in Verse. Miracula sancte Dei genitricis Marie, uersifice, which appeared as Toronto Medieval Latin Texts 17 in 1986. Within a decade he brought into print, again in the first edition ever, the original Latin (with English translations) of additional works by the same poet in Nigel of Canterbury, The Passion of St. Lawrence, Epigrams, and Marginal Poems, Mittellateinische Studien und Texte 14, in 1994. Ziolkowski's other critical editions of medieval Latin texts, with translations and substantial commentaries, include Jezebel: A Norman Latin Poem of the Early Eleventh Century, in 1989; A Garland of Latin Satire, Wisdom, and History: Verse from Twelfth-Century France (Carmina Houghtoniensia), co-edited with Bridget Balint in 2007; and Solomon and Marcolf, in 2008. His best-known work in the genre of edition cum translation and commentary was The Cambridge Songs (Carmina cantabrigiensia), in 1994 (reprinted in 1998), which has been taken as the basis for the recording Lost Songs of a Rhineland Harper by the Sequentia (music group), an ensemble for medieval music directed by Benjamin Bagby, and for Cambridge Songs Suite No. 1 and No. 2 by the composer Jim Taylor of LeTourneau University. In English-only volumes, Ziolkowski co-edited The Medieval Craft of Memory: An Anthology of Words and Pictures, with Mary Carruthers in 2002, and translated Letters of Peter Abelard, Beyond the Personal, in 2008. Between these two books he edited and introduced a translation from the French of a still-classic examination of Medieval Latin metrics by the late Swedish philologist Dag Norberg.An Introduction to the Study of Medieval Latin Versification, translated by Grant C. Roti and Jacqueline de la Chapelle Skubly, ed. Jan Ziolkowski. Washington, DC: The Catholic University of America Press, 2004. Ziolkowski's first major involvement in the study of the Roman poet Virgil came in 2008, when he brought out with Michael C. J. Putnam, emeritus of Brown University, a stout anthology of translations, The Virgilian Tradition: The First Fifteen Hundred Years, published by Yale University Press. In 2014 he expanded upon that resource with the three volumes of The Virgil Encyclopedia, co-edited with his colleague Richard F. Thomas of Harvard University, published by Wiley- Blackwell. He took his initial step into the classical tradition in 2007, when his Nota Bene: Reading Classics and Writing Songs in the Early Middle Ages was released in Publications of The Journal of Medieval Latin. This book explores the functions that musical notation served in the reception of Classical Latin literature in early medieval schools and education. Among his contributions to the study of Dante Alighieri, Ziolkowski edited Dante and the Greeks, published by Dumbarton Oaks Publications in 2014, and Dante and Islam, published by Fordham University Press in 2015. Both books set the Italian poet in broader contexts, along the way helping to connect Dante studies with medieval, Byzantine, and Islamic studies. In 2018 he brought out The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity, published with open access by Open Book Publishers. These six volumes probe a single story from its first incarnation in a medieval French poem in the early thirteenth century through its later reception from the 1870s down to the present day. Alongside the multivolume scholarship, he arranged for the reprinting of two books, Barbara Cooney, The Little Juggler, Adapted from an Old French Legend and Illustrated, from 1961, and Jos√© Mar√≠a Souvir√≥n, El juglarcillo de la Virgen, illustrated by Roser Bru, from 1942. He put into English a French version of the story for two translations, Anatole France, The Juggler of Our Lady. Written out, illuminated, and historiated by Malatesta, and The Juggler of Notre Dame, illustrated by Maurice Lalau. Ziolkowski founded the Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library and served as its general editor from 2008 through 2020. He edited and co-translated the volume of Satires by Sextus Amarcius and Eupolemius, in 2011. His interest in the history and theory of philology became apparent first in the introduction to the short collection On Philology, printed by Penn State Press in 1990, which he edited after organizing the conference on which the journal issue and book were based. His widest-ranging reprise of the topic was in a review entitled ‚ÄúMetaphilology.\\"Journal of English and Germanic Philology 104 (2005) 239‚Äì272. In 2008, he devoted an article to ‚ÄúThe Role of Interpretive Studies in Medieval Latin Philology.‚ÄùJournal of Medieval Latin 18 (2008), 277‚Äì290. Most recently, he brought out ‚ÄúMedieval Precedents for Sceptical Philology.‚ÄùIn The Marriage of Philology and Scepticism: Uncertainty and Conjecture in Early Modern Scholarship and Thought, ed. Gian Mario Cao, Anthony Grafton, and Jill Kraye. London: The Warburg Institute, 2019. 9‚Äì26. Among his contributions to the history of scholarship, Ziolkowski supplied a new foreword to Literary Language and Its Public by Erich Auerbach when reprinted by Princeton University Press in 1993.Trans. Ralph Manheim. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993. IX‚ÄìXXXIX. Four years later he provided a fresh introduction to Vergil in the Middle Ages by Domenico Comparetti when it was reissued in paperback by the same press in 1997.Trans. E. F. M. Benecke. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997. VII‚ÄìXXXVII. In 2003 he translated for the first time, from the original German, Auerbach's \\"Epilegomena to Mimesis\\" as an appendix to the fiftieth-anniversary reprint of Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature. That book opened with an introduction by Edward Said. Partial bibliography Books and monographs * The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity. Volume 1: The Middle Ages.

It lies in the area between Menz and Altglobsow and is surrounded by the forests and lakes of the Furstenberg Conservation Area and the Stechlin- Ruppiner Land Nature Park. History In 1851 the owner of the Neuglobsow glassworks began to buy up land in the surrounding area. Neuroofen lay in the midst of this land. The 560-acre estate was sold in 1896/99 to the Prussian Forest Administration, which moved the forestry office and various establishments there. In the middle of the 18th century the Prussian Administration asked what could be done with the Menzer Forest. The Head Forestry Officer said that there was so much wood that it could never be used up. 30 years later nearly all the wood had been burnt in the chimneys of Berlin. The forest was replanted and today the District Forestry Office,http://forst.brandenburg.de/cms/detail.php/bb1.c.234964.de located in Neuroofen, is mainly concerned with the ecological protection and renewal of the forest, as well carrying out research work.http://www.stechlin.net/?page_id=332 Up until the formation of the German Democratic Republic the forestry service was involved in training forestry workers and producing charcoal. Up until the re-unification of Germany it was one of the main Institutes for Forest Technology in Brandenburg.Forestry abstracts, Band 18, Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux., 1957, P.359 (GER)Jahrbuch, Deutsche Akademie der Landwirtschaftswissenschaften zu Berlin, Akademie-Verlag, 1959, P.281 (GER) From 1992 the Government Forestry Service took over the running of the Forestry Office and the former training facilities were privatised and used for the sale and repair of technical machinery for forestry work.

The regiment went by a variety of unofficial names during its existence. When Colonel Robert Crittenden Newton was in command, it went by its official title of 5th Arkansas Cavalry. Colonel Newton was succeeded in December 1863 by Col. Thomas J. Morgan, formerly captain of Company C. Under Colonel Morgan's command, the regiment went by the designation 8th Arkansas Cavalry; but it was also known on occasion as the 2nd Arkansas Cavalry. The Compiled Service Records are filed under the designation 8th Arkansas Cavalry. The commanders of the 5th/2nd/8th Cavalry include Colonels Robert C. Newton, Thomas J. Morgan, and W. A. Bevens. Battles As the 5th Arkansas under Colonel Newton, the unit served in General J. G. Walker's (later Dobbins') Division, Trans-Mississippi Department, and fought in the following engagements: * Battle of Helena, Arkansas, July 4, 1863. * Battle of Brownsville, Arkansas, August 25, 1863 * Battle of Reed's Bridge, Arkansas, August 27, 1863 * Battle of Bayou Fourche, Arkansas, September 10, 1863. * Battle of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, October 25, 1863. The unit had several members captured in the Battle of Bayou Fourche (Little Rock) in September 1863. These prisoners were sent to Camp Morton, near Indianapolis, Indiana. A few died in prison, a few joined the U.S. Army frontier service, but most were exchanged in March 1864. Many of these men were back in Arkansas in time to be paroled at Jacksonport, Arkansas, on June 5, 1865, at the end of the war. The unit designation changed to the 2nd (Morgan's) Cavalry Regiment effective December 24, 1863.

He previously played in MLB for the Texas Rangers and Oakland Athletics. Early years Profar participated in both the 2004 and 2005 Little League World Series. He helped the Pabao Little League team from Willemstad, Cura√ßao beat the Conejo Valley East Little League team from Thousand Oaks, California to win the championship in 2004. He helped lead the team to the championship game again in 2005, but this time lost to West Oahu Little League from Ewa Beach, Hawaii. Professional career =Minor Leagues= Profar signed with the Texas Rangers on July 2, 2009. Other teams wanted to sign Profar as a pitcher, but the Rangers signed him as a shortstop, his preferred position. He spent his first professional season in 2010 playing for the Spokane Indians. He hit .250 with four home runs and 23 runs batted in in 63 games. Prior to the 2011 season, Profar was ranked by Baseball America as the Texas Rangers second best overall prospect and the 74th best overall. He played the 2011 season for the Hickory Crawdads. He was selected to represent the Rangers at the 2011 All-Star Futures Game. Baseball America ranked him as the 12th best prospect in baseball during their midseason top 50 list. He finished the season hitting .286/.390/.493 with 12 home runs and 65 runs batted in and was named the South Atlantic League MVP. He was named the shortstop on Baseball America's 2011 Minor League All Star team. He was named to appear in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game. =Texas Rangers= 2012-2013 On August 31, 2012, Profar was called up to the Rangers as major league rosters expanded and as a possible postseason addition. He is the first player born in 1993 to play in the majors and was the youngest player active in the major leagues. In his major league debut, Profar started at second base in place of Ian Kinsler, who was out due to back stiffness, and hit a 388-foot solo home run off of Zach McAllister in his first major league at bat. He then later doubled in his second at-bat, and went 2 for 4 for the game. In 9 games, Profar batted .176 with a home run and 2 RBI. Profar with the Texas Rangers in 2016 Profar started the 2013 season in Triple-A Round Rock. In May 2013, the Rangers called up Profar while putting Kinsler on the 15-day disabled list. In a May 26 game at Seattle, he hit his second career home run off Hisashi Iwakuma while batting leadoff for the first time in his major league career. In 88 games, Profar batted .234 with 6 home runs and 26 RBI. 2014-2016 After the 2013 season, the Rangers traded Kinsler, anticipating that Profar would become the Rangers' starting second baseman. Profar started the 2014 season on the 60-day disabled list, and wasn't expected to make a return until mid-June. On May 22, the Rangers organization announced Profar had reinjured his shoulder, and as a result missed the entire 2014 season. On February 23, 2015, Profar underwent surgery on his shoulder and missed the entire 2015 season. Profar batting for the Round Rock Express in After missing a total of two seasons due to the shoulder injury, Profar was optioned to Triple-A Round Rock Express on March 21, 2016. On May 27, 2016, the Rangers called Profar up to the majors as a replacement for second baseman Rougned Odor, who was suspended by the MLB for seven games for punching the Toronto Blue Jays' Jos√© Bautista. Profar went 1-for-5 in his return against the Pittsburgh Pirates the same day. He hit his first home run of the season on May 31, 2016, against the Cleveland Indians. His performance during Odor's suspension earned him a regular roster spot. Upon Odor's return from suspension, Hanser Alberto was optioned to the minors. Since his return Profar has played, in addition to his normal 2B and SS positions, 3B, 1B, and the outfield (the latter two for the first time in his major league career). 2017-2018 In 2017, Profar lost playing time in left field to Ryan Rua and Delino DeShields Jr.https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/texas- rangers/rangers/2017/04/30/rangers-claim-infielder-pete-kozma-might-lead- demotion-jurickson-profar In 2018, Profar made the Rangers' major league roster out of spring training as a utility infielder. On April 16, Profar left the game after being backened after a slide. Profar was placed on concussion protocol shortly thereafter. In his first full season at the Major League level, Profar hit .254/.335/.458 with 20 homeruns, while appearing at 1B, 2B, SS, 3B, and Left Field. Profar was named the 2018 Richard Durrett Hardest Working Man Award winner by the DFW chapter of the BBWAA. =Oakland Athletics= On December 21, 2018, the Rangers traded Profar to the Oakland Athletics in a three-team deal in which the Rangers acquired Brock Burke, Kyle Bird, Yoel Espinal, Eli White, and $750,000 of international signing bonus pool space and the Tampa Bay Rays acquired Emilio Pagan, Rollie Lacy, and a competitive balance pick in the 2019 MLB draft. The Athletics played Profar almost exclusively at second base to fill the void left by free agent Jed Lowrie. After struggling on defense and to keep his batting average above .200, Profar was relegated to a platoon role when the Athletics called up Corban Joseph. On defense in 2019, he had a -10 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) rating, the lowest in the major leagues among second basemen. =San Diego Padres= On December 2, 2019, the Athletics traded Profar to the San Diego Padres in exchange for Austin Allen and a player to be named later or cash considerations. International career After Team Netherlands advanced to the semi-finals for the 2013 World Baseball Classic, manager Hensley Meulens made a public plea to have Profar on the Dutch roster since Profar was born in Curacao. The Rangers gave permission for Profar to be on the roster shortly after. Profar played during the 2017 World Baseball Classic as an infielder for the national team. Personal life Profar has two brothers. Juremi was signed by the Rangers in 2012. Both of them, as well as the youngest brother Jurdrick, have represented Curacao in the Little League World Series.ESPN: Jurickson, Juremi and now Judrick -- There's another Profar ready to rock Williamsport See also *List of Major League Baseball players with a home run in their first major league at bat References External links Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:All-Star Futures Game players Category:Cura√ßao expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Dutch people of Cura√ßao descent Category:Frisco RoughRiders players Category:Hickory Crawdads players Category:Major League Baseball infielders Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Major League Baseball players from Cura√ßao Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:People from Willemstad Category:Round Rock Express players Category:San Diego Padres players Category:Spokane Indians players Category:Texas Rangers players Category:Tigres del Licey players Category:2013 World Baseball Classic players Category:2017 World Baseball Classic players ","title":"Jurickson Profar"},{"id":"33077689","text":"Bunninadden is a Gaelic Athletic Association club based in the south of the county, comprising the parish of Bunninadden in County Sligo, Republic of Ireland.

Conceived around the time of the Caxton Celebration of 1877,Field & Tuer sponsored an exhibit volume for the Caxton Celebration exhibition titled Specimens of American Letterpress Printing, and in his introduction to Volume I Tuer cited the Caxton Celebration as the beginning of recent cooperation among printers that made such an experiment as the Specimen Exchange possible. it was an ambitious expansion of a \\"Specimens\\" column then appearing in the Paper & Printing Trades Journal, a widely read trade publication issued by London printers and publishers Field & Tuer and edited by Andrew White Tuer. The official proposal was made in a letter written in 1879 by Thomas Hailing of the Oxford Printing Works, Cheltenham, to Tuer, who replied that if 100 printers would participate, his firm would handle the arrangements.The proposal and reply were published in thePaper & Printing Trades Journal in September 1879 and reprinted in Volume I of the Specimen Exchange. Printers, and their employees and apprentices, were invited to send in examples of their work in the number of anticipated subscribers for each year. In return, they received a bound, collated set of all specimens accepted. The cost was one shilling (three shillings for American subscribers). For an additional cost, the finished volume was bound in half vellum laced with catgut. Contribution by T. L. De Vinne to Volume VII (1886)Response to the call for specimens for the first issue exceeded all expectations, and publication, originally announced as biannual, was quickly changed to annual. John Ruskin praised the goals of the project in a letter quoted in the introduction to the first volume, and a copy of Volume VI was accepted by Queen Victoria.Noted in the introduction to Volume VII. Initially most of the contributions came from Great Britain and the United States, but by the mid-1880s the Exchange included as many as 400 specimens from around the world.The high point was Volume X, with 406 specimens. For the first three years, Tuer and his editorial assistant, Robert Hilton, commented frankly and often amusingly on each specimen, but with the increase in both number and international participation, detailed critiques became burdensome and, perhaps, politically sensitive.Young, The Rise and Fall of the Printers' International Specimen Exchange (Oak Knoll Press, 2012), 22. Volumes I‚ÄìVIII (1880‚Äì1887) were published by Field & Tuer at the Leadenhall Press, London, and the content represented both old-style and new \\"Artistic\\" printing. After Volume VIII, Tuer turned publication over to Hilton, who had moved on to become editor of a new journal, the British Printer, published by the firm of Raithby & Lawrence. The Exchange began to decline under Hilton's editorship,The farewell introduction to Volume XVI (the final volume) stated, \\"The last five or six vols. represent an amount of whipping-up and persevering hammering away at subscribers that only those closely connected with the publication can form an idea of.\\" leaning heavily toward the new \\"Leicester Free Style\\" of typography developed by the firm's foreman Robert Grayson, and the venture ended a few years after Raithby & Lawrence sued Hilton for violating an agreement not to start a competing publication.British Printer, Sept.-Oct. 1895, 266. The last two (much slimmer) volumes each covered two years, with the final one not issued until early 1898, containing only 123 specimens. At its best, the Printers' International Specimen Exchange taught a generation of printers how to examine learn from printed work, and it inspired similar ventures in Germany, France, and the United States.

The castle was built of limestone on a steep hill. The keep located on its west side, and its width was and length of . All the elevation was surrounded by a tall stone wall, and in the earlier ages of the 13th century wood as building material was used instead. The castle is known as an impregnable citadel that had been tried by many as * 1226 Hungarian king Andrew the Second, * 1240 ‚Äì 1241 Batu Khan. Kremenets Castle was one of few that survived inroads of Mongol hordes on the land of Kievan Rus', * 1255 Kuremsa, tumen of Batu Khan, * 1261 fortress was demolished to an order of Vasyl‚Äôko the Landlord in demand of Boroldai, Mongol general.

Maksym Kryvonis lead the attack. History =Transformation timeline = When facts, events, and people put together in millennium long history, it is quite a story. Further we depart into depth of the centuries, more complicated it gets to establish specific dates. According to some Polish sources, Kremenets as a fortified town had existed by the year of 1064, when front ranks of landlord Boles≈Çaw II the Generous (1042‚Äì1081) charged it being an obstacle during his Kievan campaign. A few decades afterwards following unsuccessful attack on the town of Ikva enacted with the same squadrons of Boles≈Çaw II the Generous, the castle gates were opened voluntarily to the order of his owner, Denisko Mokasiev. As a reward he with his family received a lifelong town propriety patent of Kremenets. Russian sources based on Galicia annals refer to the fortress in the course of the battle between Galiciaa landlord Mstislav the Lucky (1175‚Äì1235) against the army of Hungarian king Andrew II the Jerosolimitan (1175‚Äì1235) in the vicinity of Kremenets. The winning streak of Hungarian forces were snapped although great casualties sustained. The city was one of a few that persisted through Golden Horde inroads on the land of Galicia and Volyn' during 1241‚Äì1255, nonetheless losing its commissioner who resorted to treason trying to remain in power. The castle only could not survive to the will of its defenders. In 1261 to the order of Khan Boroldai's tumen, the stronghold was disassembled by Volyn' landlord, Vasyl‚Äôko Romanovich (1203‚Äì1269). Life on the castle hill revived only 20 years later, in the 1290s, to those days' initiative of Volyn' ruler, lord Mstislav Danilovych, in the years following 1292. Difficult fortunes plagued that fringed fastness in the 14th century, since the downfall of Galicia-Volyn' dominion brought about power struggle of neighboring sovereigns, as Poland, Hungary, Lithuanian challenged each other. Kremenets Castle dilapidated at the century winding. Having turned out in the year of 1396 year to the hands of great Lithuanian prince Vytautas, the fortress of Kremenets acquired some certainty, as it was being repaired and battle readiness restored. Behind its walls a military squadron was dislocated. The power gained again together with distinctiveness and illustrious forbidding originated from king's choice of royal dungeon owned by the prince ≈†vitrigaila (1370‚Äì1452). For the centuries to come the fate of disgraced prisoner until the year of 1408 and thereafter the great prince of Lithuania as well as prince of Volhynia tied with that ground. Having become to him a bastile, later it was a stronghold of his encroach on Litvonia sovereign. It could be for that only reason town was entitled conducting self-governing status under the clause of province equal to Lutsk and Vladimir. Facing increasing Tatar aggression for half of the century, fort-post overlooking river Ikva therein as Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth property became perpetual battleground ascribing it to its borderline disposition. Although for that matter there were benefits reaped out of it. Generous outfitting subventions, restoration and security upgrades gave a momentum to further city development. Again, the castle's importance to the state was conformed by the Polish king and Litvonia prince' decree bestowing the town and vicinities to his spouse, Bona Sforza, thanks to whom Castle Hill received its another name, Bona. By the same streak fortress got new impulse for its development attributed to boundaries expansion of land and property. Last days Kremenets Castle met in September 1648 in the course of a month-and- a-half siege of Maksym Kryvonis' squadrons. Tombstones remained as a mute reminder of a bloody attack, when the fortress first and the last time fell in order to never rise from ashes again. Archaeological excavations organised in the 1970s were performed on the castle ground. There were ethereal ideas of restoration bringing it from the limbo, but inspiration and fund raising are lacking to do it practically. =Folklore narrative= Krements Castle came into existence long before princess Bona Sforza, wife of Polish king Sigismund the First. It is theorized, that the stronghold was erected in the 8th or 9th century. First written citations of Krements were found in Polish literature of 1064. The castle received great fame after unsuccessful horde attack of Batu Khan in the winter time of 1240‚Äì41. The fortress became known by the name of Polish princess of Italian descent, Bona Sforza. People of the countryside narrated many peculiar and imaginary stories on her behalf. Supposedly she sought eternal youth. In the course of absence any medicinal treatment that would provide it for her, Sforza would have to use blood of innocent virgins. They were thrown off store height in the castle tower on sharp stakes of lettuce work bearing, while the store down she was standing taking a gory shower. There is another legend telling a story of a rope bridge crossing built out of female braids of hair that princess used to take to get into the castle. To many well known narration about a tradition that Bona observed hiding out in a water well of underground palace and every Easter used to come out holding in her chin a golden key to a secret treasure chest filled with gold. Even though historian assert that Sforza owning the castle for twenty years had not visited it even once, motley canvas knit out of ancient legend perplex imagination. Legends remain to be legends, but the castle existence in many aspects has to be credited to Sigismund's I spouse. The king gave it to her all together including town outskirts in 1536. The new hostess secured tall bulwark, three towers, barracks, utility structures, and magazines. A deep well, later on becoming a source of an imaginary story, was dug out as main water supply for the troopers in case of prolonged siege. Managing the country with a help of her monitors, Bona introduced a system of oppressive imposition that consisted of monetary as well as natural goods taxation. This turned out to be viewed as a persecution towards native population. Departing to Italy due to her husband's death, she shipped out 70 horses drawn wagons of valuables. Relieved from its ruthless owner, the castle remained to be on guard. For a long time no one could have overcome this stronghold. Only in September 1648 colonel Maksym Kryvonis managed to besiege it. For a month and a half lasted furious battle between Cossacks and Szlachta. At last the fort- post fell. Since then it has not been rebuilt. And, next to the hill platform P‚Äôyatnitsky graveyard appeared retaining tombs of warrior burials. The Castle Hill has become a tourist destination of Kremenets State Historic Architectural Preservation. Thousands of people come to visit it in order to get a glimpse of fortress bulwark and bird's eye view of the town and its vicinity. Gothic arch of the gatehouse brings you into the castle yard. Not that long ago a TV-relay antennas were located here. But remains of the wall with its jugged outlines stand deserted now giving a clue if its dramatic past time.  Architectural snapshots  Having ground broken in the 11th or 12th century originally as Slavic enceinte positioned on the western fringe, fort- post was on top of Castle Hill. It comprised considerably smaller dimensions comparatively to modern encompassing ragged outline. Facing forward stone bulwark plummeted two meters down turning into convoluted mirroring shaped to the crag drop-off. The fastness as it appears nowadays was laid out in the 1290s. Its perimeter increased considerably by fourfold and outer line of battlement structure was constructed adjoining Chervlena gatehouse, initially as a single architectural piece, with wooden drawbridge over an inlet. Fortpost occupied the crest of hill, completely towering a circle of tall bulwarks as high as 8 metres and thick as 2 metres. Later in the northern part of the castle double-decker portal tower containing spade-shaped arch slash through became principal entry way to the complex from the side of Chercha mount. Triple-decker tower over a new house was erected in the western part of the encente in order to have a bird's-eye view of the town and vicinity. The first level was allocated for strategic reserves of provision, second level was inhabited including some living areas devoted to utility rooms, third level retained cannons. Reinforcing security of the fortress on the side of mount Cherche inlet, a moat was dug out and two stone bastions constructed. All the inside area of fortified perimeter was taken by thirty-four wooden structures of affluent town dwellers, where their most valuable possessions were secured due to prolonged subsistence on the front line, rainwater stone collector, nine magazines packed with provisions, living headquarter constructed out of durable wood, St. Michael's chapel, and other utility structures as dungeon, bakery, sentinel shack, etc. Kremenets Castle's complex design was conceived on the principles of early Gothic defence architecture that implied two dead-end lower decks, minimum of decorations, simplicity of geometrical spans, merlon battlement with its crenelated parapet of wood scaffolding covering the whole length of fortress walls. Only Portal tower on the north-eastern mount side with adjoining to it corner of the bulwark, tower over the new house, and fragments of western and eastern walls have been preserved.  3D Model Castle  The company AERO3Dengineering in 2019 year was developed 3D model Kremenets Castle.

Cohan himself stars in this silent version along with Anna Q. Nilsson and Hedda Hopper, billed under her real name Elda Furry. One version of the play preceded this movie in 1916 and numerous versions followed in the succeeding decades such as the early RKO talkie starring Richard Dix. Seven Keys to Baldpate is an extant film with much home video availability.Progressive Silent Film List: Seven Keys to Baldpate at silentera.comThe Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: Seven Keys to Baldpate Plot As described in a film magazine, George Washington Magee (Cohan) bets a companion $5,000 that he can write a bestseller in twenty-four hours. He goes to an isolated summer hotel in the mountains, receives the only key to the place, and sets about his task. Soon he is interrupted by complications as guests arrive, unexpected and uninvited, each with their own key to the deserted hotel. Two hundred thousand dollars gets deposited in the hotel safe, a young woman is shot, and, while the author holds the crooks at bay waiting for the police to arrive, they cook up a scheme to turn the tables on George. The woman's body disappears from the room, and the crooks are marched off to prison by U.S. Secret Service men. The caretaker returns the following night and congratulates the author on his success, and a lady reporter capitulates under the smiles of the industrious writer. Cast * George M.

This was his first of only a handful of screen appearances, and he does a fine job...The plot is far-fetched and sometimes confusing, and the fact that some sections of the plot are replaced by title cards doesn‚Äôt help, but I like the backstory, and there‚Äôs definitely an air of parody to the proceedings.

Definitions of runway accidents Several terms fall under the flight safety topic of runway safety, including incursion, excursion, and confusion. Terms such as runway event or runway accident are used for such incidents. =Runway incursion= Runway incursion involves an aircraft, and a second aircraft, vehicle, or person.

Once under the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard, the lighthouse is now managed by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. History Building of a lighthouse to guide sea-going vessels into Matagorda Bay through Pass Cavallo was authorized by the Congress of the Republic of Texas in 1845 . When President James K. Polk signed the Texas Annexation documents on December 29, 1845, it became the responsibility of the United States. In 1847, the United States Congress authorized $15,090 to build the lighthouse. Legislative red tape caused a series of delays, and the contract to build the lighthouse was finally awarded to Murray and Hazlehurst of Baltimore in 1851. The new cast iron lighthouse became functional on December 21, 1852. Gulf storms and subsequent beach erosion caused the lighthouse to be rebuilt on higher ground. The light tower was raised in 1857 to enable the beam to be seen from a greater distance. A new lens was installed in 1859. During the Civil War, the Confederate States Navy tried to blow up the lighthouse to keep it out of Union hands. Damage inflicted by the Confederate troops necessitated rebuilding of the lighthouse at a new site in 1873 at a cost of $32,000. A new iron conical tower was added, with the lens above sea level. The 1886 Indianola hurricane destroyed most of the town, and caused the water to rise inside the tower. The resulting structural swaying caused the lens to fall out. In 1956, the tower was automated by the United States Coast Guard, making it the first time the tower was not operated by human keepers. Renovation The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, which manages the lighthouse, installed a new rotating solar-powered marine lantern in 1999. After having been out of commission since 1995, the light was re-lit at Midnight as the year turned over to 2000, to celebrate the new millennium. The lighthouse underwent a renovation completed in 2004, at a cost of $1.23 million. The renovation was made possible through private donations through the Matagorda Island Foundation, and with a grant from the United States government. Cemetery The resting place for lighthouse keepers and their families can be found near the lighthouse.

They live in lodgings and spend their days drinking in caf√©s, discussing philosophy, literature and society reforms. \\"Jarmann\\" ends his life by committing suicide, shooting himself after spending his last night with a prostitute. The novel is a roman √† clef, as the characters are easily recognizable as real people: \\"Ek\\" is J√¶ger himself, and \\"Jarmann\\" also has a corresponding real person. Confiscation and trial The book was immediately banned by the Ministry of Justice, and the police managed to confiscate most of the printed copies shortly after its publication. J√¶ger was sentenced to sixty days imprisonment and a fine of , for infringement of modesty and public morals, and for blasphemy. He also lost his position as a stenographer at the Parliament of Norway. J√¶ger was defended in court by barrister Ludvig Meyer. The Supreme Court decision became the subject of a fierce debate. Liberal and conservative newspapers mostly supported the government's actions and the court decision, while intellectuals raised their voices in support of freedom of speech. The confiscation of Kristiania-Boh√™men sparked a debate on freedom of press in 1886 in the literary, cultural and political magazine Nyt Tidsskrift. The novel gave its name to a literary movement in Norway in the 1880s (in ), which included, in addition to J√¶ger, Christian Krohg, Gunnar Heiberg, Ludvig Meyer, Arne Garborg and others. Their \\"program\\" was based on naturalism, and also included elements of socialism and anarchism. Discussions on morals and sexuality had started early in the 1880s, and the debate became even more heated after the confiscation of J√¶ger's book in 1885, of Krohg's novel Albertine in 1886, and the imprisonment of J√¶ger.

She was launched on 14 January 1873 as hull number 81 at Harland and Wolff Shipyards, Belfast, and delivered to the owners on 29 March 1873. She was one of two cargo ships initially built by Harland and Wolff for the Bibby Line, but bought on the stocks for use on the South American service, the other ship being Belgics sister, . She sailed from Liverpool on her maiden voyage to Valpara√≠so on 16 April 1873, but White Star made the decision later that year to withdraw the steamship service to South America. Belgic made White Star's last steamship voyage to South America in December, though the company's sailing ships continued to operate the route. Belgic was transferred to the North American service in 1874, making voyages between London and New York. On 20 July 1874 she encountered the disabled Spanish steamer Tornas and towed her into New York. Belgic was briefly transferred to the Liverpool - New York routine, but was withdrawn from service in 1875 and chartered with Gaelic to the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company on 29 May, operating out of San Francisco. Belgic operated these routes until her sale in 1883 to Cia de Nav. 'La Flecha', and her name was changed to Goefredo. Her career in this new incarnation was short and was marked with two accidents, the first occurred on 27 January 1884 when she ran aground off Santiago de Cuba.

In recent years players have included the likes of Kevin McDonnell and Sean Carrabine. Castleconnor play in the Sligo Intermediate Championship and in Sligo League Division 2. History Castleconnor as a club have been in and out of the Sligo GAA history since 1889 but it is only since the 1970s that the club has been on a consistent footing. The club is the most westerly in county Sligo since 1896 when Queen Victoria adjusted the county boundary. This now means the parish is in both Sligo and Mayo counties with players from the club representing both Sligo and Mayo. In fact during the 1950s the club played football in the summer months in Sligo and during the winter played in the North Mayo leagues. Whilst the club dissolved and was restarted during the years it was never extinct and produced players like Paddy Best a regular Sligo and Connacht player in the 1940s, the Mulderrig brothers who went on to win All Ireland titles with Mayo in 1950 and 51 after playing minor for Sligo, Barnes Murphy who led Sligo to Connacht glory in 1975 along with other county senior captains Paddy Joe Barrins & Kevin McDonnell, with past players having played intercounty for Louth, Cavan, Donegal, Longford and London. Prior to the 1940s many of the players in the parish played with neighbouring clubs. However in 1948 Michael Mulderrig, a native of Ballina, moved into the parish and as a seasoned Mayo county footballer he brought great interest to football again and the club was reformed for a number of years. However, when the Mulderrig's transferred back to Mayo the interest waned. In those days the club had no pitch and used Jones's/Langan's fields in Attychree for training and games. The club was again reformed again in 1955 by Liam Boland and Tom McMenamin and fielded a minor team and a Junior team, and while success evaded the team they did produce Christy Barrins who played on the Sligo Minor team. In 1959, following the emigration of 16 of the panel, the club ceased to exist again. The last rejuvenation of the club was in 1969 and has seen the club going from strength to strength. The first honour ever won was the 1972 West Division Minor championship with a team featuring Gerry Barrins (who would captain a Mayo Vocational school to All Ireland glory) and Jimmy Cullen (who played for an amazing 4 years with the Sligo Minors). The club would go on to win adult championship titles in junior 1980 1985 2002 and intermediate title in 1998 and winning league titles in junior in 80,85, division 2 titles in 1990, 92, 98 and the senior league in 2006, the first adult county final played under floodlights in Sligo. In 2016 our club ground won the Sligo and Connacht titles of Club grounds of the year. In 1985 we won the best overall club in Scor na nOg in Sligo and achieved All Ireland success in the same event. In 2009 the club won our first underage A championship (u14 football) and went onto represent Sligo at F√©ile in Kildare. In 2009 the club founded a hurling club which is growing and getting stronger every year where we are now at the stage of competing in A championship underage finals. The Cawley brothers Tom√°s and Alan have both received Nicky Rackard All Star awards in the last number of years. This had its origins in the 1970 and 1980s when we had a Camogie club. Being to the forefront of ladies sport was shown again in the 1990s when Castleconnor ladies club (now Eoghan Rua) was established. The club also has a very active handball club who regularly compete in Connacht and All Ireland competition. The Club is currently represented on the Sligo inter county team by Sean Carrabine and David Carrabine also plays intercounty football with London.

Choi batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Busan. Amateur career In 1975, Choi gained national attention at the Champions Invitational Tournament where he threw a complete game no-hitter against 1974 national champion Kyungbuk High School and took another no-hitter into the ninth inning in the team's next game before it was broken up by an infield single. In 1976, he led his team to win the Blue Dragon Flag National Championship, setting a high-school record for most strikeouts in a major- tournament game with 20 in the semifinal and earning 4 out of the team's 5 wins during the tourney. In September 1976, Choi was selected for the South Korean junior national team and competed in the 3‚Äìgame friendly series against Japan where he hurled a one-run complete game victory in Game 1, and racked up another victory the very next day in Game 2 coming up on relief in the third inning and throwing seven innings of one-run ball. Upon graduation from high school, Choi entered Yonsei University and played college baseball from 1977 to 1980. In November 1977, Choi was first called up to the South Korea senior baseball team and played an important role in the team's first world championship at the 1977 Intercontinental Cup held in Nicaragua. After graduation from Yonsei University in 1981, Choi signed with the Lotte amateur baseball team. In August 1981, Choi competed for South Korea in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup where he posted a 2‚Äì0 record and an ERA of 1.32. Choi took a perfect game with 11 strikeouts into the bottom of the ninth inning against Canada in round-robin phase before giving up a single. However, he was eventually named the tourney's Best Pitcher. Professional career =Toronto Blue Jays= After the impressive performances at the 1981 Intercontinental Cup in Canada, the Toronto Blue Jays showed a strong interest in Choi, regarding him as having the potential to play in the big league immediately. The Blue Jays' scouts went to see Choi six times before signing him to a major league contract reportedly worth around $250,000. Meanwhile, South Korea was in the process of forming its own professional baseball league. When the government discovered Choi was heading to Toronto, it threatened to jail the scouts if they tried to leave the country with the contract. The Blue Jays planned on bringing Choi to Blue Jays' spring training for the 1983 season, but the government intervened again. Choi was given a choice: Serve a mandatory military commitment before going to Canada, or pitch in the Korean professional league and have his military service waived. Choi eventually opted for the latter, declaring for the KBO Draft after the 1982 Amateur World Series. =Lotte Giants= Choi was selected by the Lotte Giants in the first round of the 1983 KBO Draft. He had a respectable rookie season, posting a 9‚Äì16 record and an ERA of 2.40 with 148 strikeouts. Wearing uniform number 11, Choi hurled 9 complete games and one shutout, and was ranked fourth in ERA and strikeouts. Choi established himself in 1984 with a breakout season for the Giants. He was 27‚Äì13, ranked first in wins, and fanned a league- leading 223 batters during the season. Choi also lowered his ERA to 1.92, second-lowest in the league behind OB Bears pitcher Jang Ho-yeon (1.58), and posted the second-highest innings pitched total in a season in KBO history with 284.2 (on the contrary, ERA champion Jang Ho-yeon pitched only 102.1 innings in the season). In the 1984 Korean Series, the Giants beat the Samsung Lions in seven games. Choi started for the Giants four times and threw four complete-games with a 3‚Äì1 record as a starter, with his final outing being Game 7. Choi accumulated one more win as a long reliever in Game 6, coming up on relief in the fifth inning and hurling five shutout innings with six strikeouts. As a clutch \\"iron arm\\" pitcher, Choi finished the Series with an astonishing 4‚Äì1 record and an ERA of 1.80 in 40 innings pitched in nine days. He still holds the most unbreakable records for most wins (4) and most innings pitched (40.0) in a single championship series. Choi's 1986 season ended as one of the finest he had ever posted. He posted a 19-14 record and an ERA of 1.55 with 208 strikeouts in 267 innings pitched. Choi pitched a career-high 17 complete games and his 1.55 ERA was the lowest of his eight-season career. He led the league in innings pitched, and was runner-up in wins, ERA and strikeouts (208). He has pitched one of the finest games of his career in the 1987 season: On May 16, in a 2-2 game against the Haitai Tigers, Choi completed a game of no-decision through 15 innings - he pitched 209 pitches in total. The opposing pitcher Sun Dong-Yeol, also regarded as one of the finest in the league, also completed the game, ending up pitching 232 pitches. This matchup of the two Korean ace pitchers is often considered as one of the best moments in Korean baseball history. =Samsung Lions= Prior to the 1989 season, Choi was traded with Kim Yong-chul to the Samsung Lions for Jang Hyo- jo and Kim Si-jin. After the trade, his career quickly spiraled downward. His statistics did not improve while with the Lions. In just over two years with the Lions, he posted a 7‚Äì7 record with an ERA of 4.50. Choi became the first member of the 1,000 strikeout club on May 20, 1990 when he fanned Lee Kwang- Eun of the LG Twins in the fifth inning in Daegu. However, after the 1990 season, Choi announced his retirement from baseball as a player. Post playing career Choi Retired in 1990 and then dabbled in politics, did some baseball broadcasting work and acted. After 2001 he returned to baseball as the minor league manager for the Hanwha Eagles (2007‚Äì2009) and supervisor for the KBO (2009‚Äì2011). Death and memorial Choi Dong-Won's number 11 was retired by the Lotte Giants in 2011. Choi died of colon cancer at a hospital in Goyang, Gyeonggi-do on September 14, 2011, aged 53. Choi was survived by wife, one son, mother and two younger brothers. The Lotte Giants retired Choi's squad number 11 on September 30, 2011. The number is the club's first- ever retired number since the club was founded in 1975. He was portrayed by Cho Seung-woo in the 2011 film, Perfect Game about the two top pitchers him and his rival Sun Dong-Yeol in the Korea Baseball Organization league during the 1980s.

As such they participated in an important assault during the Siege of Yorktown in October 1781.

He was one of the first African Americans to become a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons. He was one of the most prominent Black doctors in the 20th century in the United States. Early life Matthew Walker's parents were Phillip Walker and Rosa Ware Walker. His grandfather's name was also Matthew Walker, but the elder's name was never included by the Walker family in the counting. The older Matthew had been an industrious man and well respected gentleman. One town in Louisiana had been named Waterproof, since it was on higher ground than its surroundings. Phillip and Rosa Walker began their married life in Waterproof, Louisiana. The new family thought it had picked a spot safe from the floods which sometimes plagued Louisiana. However, in his early years, the child, Matthew, was to have a particularly harrowing experience related to water. Once, when a torrential rain came pouring down, the young Walker, who was standing on the rail-less porch of the family home, fell and was swept into a rush of water flowing below the porch. One of his aunts, Mattie Walker, having noted what happened, rushed to the other side of the porch, reached down, and grabbed the young child before he could be swept away in the deluge.Walker Family Web Page. Education and family life The Walker family moved to New Orleans when Matthew was still young so that he could get a good education. When he became grown and married, Matthew left for his own children a recorded tape wherein he recalled memories of his father, Phillip Walker, who served as a Pullman porter during the older gentleman's rather short lifetime. Fishing and hunting became Walker's greatest means of relaxation throughout his lifetime. Walker's Mom, Rosa, was an expert seamstress as well as a domestic worker. Matthew would gather buttons which his Mother didn't need and sell them. Eventually, he was able to buy a radio kit with which he built a working radio for his listening pleasure. Matthew undertook his undergraduate work at New Orleans University (later called Dillard University). Walker told his family of the times he spent working in hotels as a bus boy and such to help with his college tuition. During this time, Walker, also studied and played the violin. While attending New Orleans University, Matthew Walker met and in 1937 married Alice Willa Gibbs Johnson. The two soon moved to Nashville where they resided in the countryside with a farming family named Beale, until they were able to buy a suitable home in Nashville proper. Four children were eventually born to them: Charlotte Rose (who became a general surgeon specializing in oncology and a professor of surgery as did her father), Maxine June (who later married Brandford Giddings Sr., PhD (chemistry)), who became a computer technologist, Matthew Jr., who became a successful and ardent community activist, and Daniel Phillip, who became a microbiologist. Having obtained an A.B. from New Orleans University in 1929, Walker decided he wanted a medical career. He applied and was accepted at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, and received an M.D. degree in 1934, with honors. He became a diplomate of the American Board of Surgery about 1946, and received one of two of the highest scores out of eighty persons taking the examination at The Johns Hopkins Hospital.Owen, M.D., Oliver E. \\"Leaders in American Medicine: Matthew Walker, M.D.\\", The Pharos of Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society, Editor, Edward D.

Manual of Abstracts. 1993 September,6:6. He was elected to the Kappa Pi Honorary Society at Meharry. Medical career After internship at Hubbard Hospital in Nashville, Dr. Matthew Walker Sr. served as a resident in surgery and gynecology at the George W. Hubbard Hospital of Meharry Medical College and was an instructor in surgery, gynecology, orthopedics, anesthesia, and areas of eye, ear, nose and throat. Walker held these positions from 1936 until 1938. Studying under Dr. Edward L. Howes at Howard University in Washington, D.C., Dr. Walker spent 1938-1939 as a General Education and Board Fellow in surgery. Additionally, Walker spent a few summers doing studies at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and at the Crile Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio. Having returned to the George W. Hubbard Hospital of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee in 1939, Dr. Walker became an instructor in physiology there from 1930 to 1942. He became an instructor in pathology at Meharry from 1941 until 1943. Then, Dr. Walker was an assistant professor and gynecology from 1939 until 1942. He was associate professor from 1942 until 1944. In 1944, he was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as Surgeon in The Reserve of The United States Public Health Service for a period of five years. He achieved the rank of full professor in surgery and gynecology at Hubbard Hospital also in 1944. Dr. Walker had quite a broad experience with surgery. He could go over the whole peritoneal cavity, disregarding today's distinction between the abdominal and pelvic cavities. Walker knew urology and proctology. Dr. Walker also served as acting Chairman of the Department of Surgery at Hubbard. Finally, as the year 1944 progressed, Dr. Matthew Walker was made Chairman and Professor of the Department of Surgery.Edited by Organ Jr. M.D., F.A.C.S., Claude H. and Kosiba, R.N., Margaret M. (1987)A Century of Black Surgeons: The U.S.A. Experience, p. 128. Transcript Press. Norman, Oklahoma. . As such, Matthew Walker served as chairman of Meharry's medical school curriculum committee. During this period, with the Dean of the medical school, Dr. Daniel Thomas Rolfe, Dr. Walker revitalized the entire medical school curriculum. Walker served in this position of chair of the medical school curriculum in the 1950s and beyond.Johnson Sr., M.D., Charles W.The Spirit of a Place Called Meharry: The Strength of Its Past to Shape the Future. pp.122 - 123. Hillsboro Press, Franklin, Tennessee, 2000. . He was made a Fellow of the International College of Surgeons in 1947.Cobb, PhD, W. Montague.\\"Matthew Walker Sr., MD, FACS, FICS, 1906-1978\\".Journal of the National Medical Association 1979. May 71(5): 506. Retrieved September 21, 2011. thumb Matthew Walker, M.D. was the author of many publications regarding surgery and research in medical journals. Principally, his research dealt with wound healing, peritonitis, and penicillin, nutritional and survival experiments following massive reactions of the intestines, vascular surgery, eosinophil counts and adrenocortical response and plasma expanders. A five to seven-year stint at residential training was created under Dr. Walker's leadership in the Department of Surgery at Meharry. This training program, though rough on the residents, produced exceedingly fine surgeons. Among them was Dorothy Lavinia Brown, M.D. one of the first African-American women to be trained as a surgeon. Then, later (among other residential trainees of Dr. Walker's who were women), there was (the wife of Dr. George Simpson, an outstanding Meharrian) Dr. Dazelle Dean Simpson whom Dr. Charles Johnson rated as having \\"...one of the keenest intellects....\\" he had ever come across. Indeed, Walker was devoted to training his students thoroughly. Walker served on many boards, among which were the Metropolitan Board of Hospital Commissioners and the Board of Clark Memorial Methodist Church. He also knew how to relax after days of grueling surgery. And, he was devoted to his church, Clark. On a Sunday, following the service to which he was accompanied by his family, Walker was known to gather the surplus Church bulletins and carry them to his patients and friends at his beloved Meharry - Hubbard hospital as he made his daily rounds. Matthew Sr. was a true lover of all people. When he wanted fishing buddies, he would call on anyone with a love of fishing. Thus, he was often found fishing with heads of businesses, fellow surgeons or doctors, members of his family, or janitors from any institution. Indeed, he could be seen drinking water or lemonade from the same thermos top as his buddies, for in those days, people did not worry so about catching certain diseases. Matthew Walker traveled widely, and often, he took his wife along to many of the states within the United States, either to medical meetings or on personal jaunts. The pair also went abroad to Canada, Mexico, Jamaica, England, Italy where they had an audience with the Pope at the Vatican (even though they were staunch Methodists), and the African countries of Ghana, Liberia, Senegal, and Nigeria. Matthew loved Africa so, and wished the continent well so much, that he used to send for persons from various African countries to become trained as either nurses or doctors at Meharry. His family recalls having had many African nurses and doctors to be gathered around the dinner table at their home as Alice, a grand and generous cook, prepared magnificent meals for them. As earlier noted, Matthew Walker established a residency program for his future doctors that was quite stunning. As he was working at Meharry, Walker kept getting called to Taborian Hospital in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. Taborian, built by an organization of Black people called the Knights and Daughters of Tabor,Yancey Sr., MD, FACS, Asa G. Matthew Walker Sr., MD, FACS (1906-1978): Recollections of a Resident. 1979 May; 71(5):511. Retrieved September 21, 2011. was set up with an arrangement for its patients to be provided with health care services. These services were covered under the Taborian insurance premiums; and, were prepaid. With Taborian Hospital opening on February 12, 1942, this service provided care that preceded Medicare, Medicaid, Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) and other similar ones. There, Blacks had established medical facilities for themselves; however, proper medical professionals were not largely available. So, for part of the training;and, after obtaining a major Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) grant from Washington, D. C.,Walker, Matthew. \\"The Affiliation of Taborian Hospital with Meharry Medical College and Development of the O.E.O. Planning Grant. Meharry Medical College Quarterly Digest.4:3 (April 1966); unpaginated. Dr. M. Walker built a training program that would involve a rotation from Meharry to Mound Bayou, a small Delta town. Dr. Asa G. Yancey writes of Dr. M. Walker (on learning of the loss of the services of the surgeon-in-charge at Taborian) having sent him, Yancey, as a team member to Mississippi to help provide medical services to these mostly very poor, Black, Delta people. In time, Walker, with some of his colleagues, took some young women from the cotton fields, and, over time, trained them so thoroughly that they became qualified nurses. In his zeal to keep the program up to par, Walker, himself, was known to have driven to Mound Bayou from his home in Nashville over 200 times.Summerville, James. Educating Black Doctors. A History of Meharry Medical College, p.124. The University of Alabama Press. 1983. . Dr. Walker's own daughter, the late Charlotte Rose Walker, M.D., also trained at Taborian among other places such as the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases in New York which partnership (between Meharry and Memorial) Dr. Walker also established. This training occurred at a time when going to Mound Bayou meant a long, hot drive down to the Mississippi town from Nashville. As a Black person driving, one had to know the places where he/she could stop comfortably for a bite to eat as segregation was still alive during part of this era. While he was Chairman of the Department of Surgery, Dr. Walker's residency program was such that he trained a list of physicians who have become board-certified under the program. Because they loved and admired him so, in 1958, some of Walker's trainees, who were over 70 persons, started the Matthew Walker Surgical Society. This was done strictly in Walker's honor, and to help promote Dr. Walker's form of teaching for expansive learning. During Dr. Walker's medical career, there were numerous opportunities for collaboration with esteemed physicians and medical practitioners at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. Among these opportunities was a time when an interim committee, charged with administering the affairs of Meharry Medical College while a search committee was formed to find a new president of the medical college, was needed. This happened after the resignation of President M. Don Clawson. One Dr. Amos Christie, Chairman of Vanderbilt School of Medicine's Department of Pediatrics, accepted membership on this committee. Dr. Matthew Walker also served on this committee. Then, much later, among speakers presenting at the annual Charles W. Johnson Sr., M.D. Symposium in Immunology was Dr. Alexander Lawtron, of Vanderbilt University. Then, there have been more associations between Vanderbilt and Meharry. Vanderbilt and other schools joined with Meharry in its capacity of serving as a training site and advisory body for international health. Today, because of his industry and outstanding grant writing ability, there exist several Matthew Walker Comprehensive Health Centers (MWCHC) designed particularly to serve the poor and under served of all races for whom Matthew Walker had great compassion. Walker used to say that many times doctors told their patients to take certain medications before or after meals. He then went on to say that often, some patients would have to skip meals because they had not enough food for three meals a day. Therefore, they wouldn't be able to take all of the pills with an associated meal. Thus, he was always concerned about the poor and their lack of proper health care. Dr. Walker was able to see the opening of the first health care center named to honor him with many members of his family in attendance. (See http://www.mwchc.org See this note at the website : \\"MATTHEW WALKER COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CENTER provides health care services for everyone, the insured and the uninsured. For patients without insurance, fees will be based on income. A co-payment may be required\\".) Currently, there are several other Matthew Walker Comprehensive Health Care Centers. Two are the MWCHC Clarksville Clinic and the MWCHC Murfreesboro Clinic. There is another one at Fisk University in Nashville. In total, there are seven other Matthew Walker Comprehensive Health Centers throughout Middle Tennessee, using the same philosophy and serving over 28,000 patients. Dr. Matthew Walker Sr. was Chief Surgeon at the George W. Hubbard Hospital of Meharry Medical College, a consulting surgeon at the Riverside Sanitarium and Hospital in Nashville, and Director of Surgery at the Taborian Hospital, Mound Bayou, Mississippi. His memberships included the Volunteer State Medical Association, the R. F. Boyd Medical Society, the John Henry Hale Surgical Society, New York Academy of Science, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and membership in the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. Dr. Walker was featured on the cover of Alpha Omega Alpha's magazine, Pharos. He, along with a cameo portrait of his family, was pictured on the front of Pharos in spring, 2003 issue.Owen, M.D., Oliver E.

Walker was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Meharry Alumni Association. Walker was generous to a fault. Later in life, those who knew him most intimately were told that when he would go Thanksgiving shopping, he would fill a basket for his family, and then, have a resident, who would accompany Walker, fill a basket for his own family. Additionally, though Walker never grew really rich on salary from Meharry- Hubbard, he saw to it that many of his poorer relatives whom he had left in Waterproof and nearby towns were often given money or clothing items to help them along their way. Furthermore, Matthew Walker Sr. paid college tuition for several University students (in addition to his own four children). These things he never bragged about. He simply wanted his fellow Blacks to have a chance at the good life as he did. Dr. Matthew Walker Sr. died on July 15, 1978 in Nashville, Tennessee.Walker, Matthew(1906‚Äì1978) ‚Äì Physician, Surgeon, Chronology, Final Years and Legacy Encyclopedia Jrank.org.

Text-based semigraphics or pseudographics is a primitive method used in early text mode video hardware to emulate raster graphics without having to implement the logic for such a display mode. There are two different ways to accomplish the emulation of raster graphics. The first one is to create a low-resolution all points addressable mode using a set of special characters with all binary combinations of a certain subdivision matrix of the text mode character size; this method is referred to as block graphics, or sometimes mosaic graphics. The second one is to use special shapes instead of glyphs (letters and figures) that appear as if drawn in raster graphics mode, sometimes referred to as semi- or pseudo-graphics; an important example of this is box-drawing characters. Semigraphical characters (including some block elements) are still incorporated into the BIOS of any VGA compatible video card, so any PC can display these characters from the moment it is turned on, even when no operating system is yet loaded. Single and double lines are still often drawn with this method when the system uses text mode; for example when running the BIOS setup program. Many of these historical ideas have been adopted into Unicode, in, for example in the Block Elements, Box Drawing and Geometric Shapes Unicode blocks.Unicode block U25A0 contains geometric shapes Block graphics For example, an 8√ó12 character could be divided vertically in two halves and horizontally in three parts, and then assigning \\"ink\\" and \\"background\\" values to the elements of the matrix in a binary pattern, corresponding to the binary sequence of the position in the font table of a 2√ó3 mosaic matrix of so-called squots (square dots). Less often used versions use a 1√ó6 \\"matrix\\", in which case these six \\"pixels\\" are sometimes referred to as sixels.Use of sixel in this context But dividing an 8√ó8 character in 2√ó2 \\"pixels\\" was also common (it was, for example, used in the Sinclair ZX81). Sometimes the text semigraphical characters are simply incorporated into the systems font-set, sometimes special video hardware is used to directly convert the bit-pattern from video memory into the pixels. In rare cases a character matrix wasn't dividable vertically by three, for example in an 8√ó8 matrix the mosaic is sometimes divided so that it uses a 3:2:3 scan line scheme. The Galaksija's graphics mode is an example, although with a 4:5:4 scheme the distortion effect was minimal. 300px The seminal use of this technology was in the TRS-80 where the only way to get discrete pixels on the screen that could be turned on and off individually, (all points addressable) was by the use of a 2√ó3 pixel matrix of block graphics. In the case of the TRS-80 these block graphics were not incorporated into a font ROM, as later became the norm, but were generated directly from the logic pattern of six bits from the video RAM using a dedicated circuit made from logic gates.Description of TRS-80 block graphics If the system also supported color, the color resolution of the resulting pixels was normally equal to the text resolution, often leading to attribute clash as the color of a pixel could not be changed on a per pixel basis, but only to one \\"ink\\", and one \\"background\\" color for all pixels within a character position. Sometimes the number of characters in the font, dedicated to block graphics, could be halved if the system also supported an \\"invert\\" attribute, as half the characters in a full block graphics font set are the logical inverse of the other half of the font set. Other tricks that were used to decrease the number of needed characters, was to use a space for the \\"all bits are zero\\" character, and to use character 7F hex for the \\"all bits are on\\" character, as character 7F hex (decimal 127) was often defined as an \\"all pixels on\\" character (this because of the fact that when using papertape punching out all seven holes, created the 7F hex \\"byte\\" which was considered to be the \\"DEL\\" or \\"rub-out\\" character). The assignment in ASCII of the rub-out character (to the code point 127) led designers of VDUs to use \\"rub-out\\" for a character square filled with \\"ink\\", which was often used to represent the cursor. Examples of the use of block graphics text block graphics set of the ZX-81 Other examples of systems that relied on the use of block graphics are: * The ZX80 and ZX81, where a matrix of 2√ó2 pixels was used, with the space and invert attribute tricks to keep the number of characters in the ROM needed down to just 7 (of the necessary 16).Technical details ZX-81 character set and block graphics The ZX Spectrum also supported block graphics as well as \\"real\\" higher-resolution graphics. In addition, on the Spectrum the system font (stored in its ROM) could be easily and instantly changed to one stored in RAM, allowing programmers to define their own semigraphical characters to suit their needs. * Other systems that used a 2√ó2 matrix were the Panasonic JR-200 and the Mattel Aquarius. * The Commodore PET also had a few characters to support 2√ó2 text semigraphics in its PETSCII character set. The PET was also one of the first systems to rely heavily on semigraphical characters, to get any form of graphics on screen. * The TRS-80 Color Computer, and the Dragon 32/64 are good examples of systems using 2√ó2 matrix color semigraphics. But their Motorola 6847 VDC also supported a little used 6-block semigraphics mode.CoCo Semi-graphics-6 display mode * Videotex and teletext systems used a 2√ó3 matrix and one foreground (\\"ink\\"), and one background color, normally out of a set of eight colors (including black and white). Many systems used \\"Videotex graphics\\". One of the best known examples is the Acorn BBC Micro's default graphics mode (mode 7).BBC Micro videotex graphics Other systems which used \\"Videotex\\"-like graphics are: the ABC 80, the Grundy NewBrain, many of the Acorn Eurocard systems, and the Philips P2000T, which actually used a Teletext chip designed for their TV's. * The PC-8001 managed to combine normal text with a full set of 256 text semigraphical \\"characters\\" in a 2√ó4 matrix; how the system distinguished the 8 bits used for \\"normal\\" fonts from the 8 bits needed for the text semigraphics is unclear. * One of the last video systems where text semigraphics were a useful option was the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA). This graphics adapter for early IBM-PCs only supported four colors in its high-resolution graphics mode, but in text mode it could display 16 different colors. Although the CGA adapter's font ROM did not contain all of the otherwise typical text semigraphics characters, it was still possible to create a 160 √ó 100 CGA text semigraphics mode using a semi-documented trick. Semigraphical characters The keyboard of the PET 2001 has semigraphical characters indicated for easy entry Semigraphical characters are also characters in a font that are intended to give the impression that a system can support high resolution graphics, while in fact the system operates in text mode. Characters such as box-drawing characters, circles and dots, card symbols like ‚ô†, ‚ô£, ‚ô• and ‚ô¶, and \\"graphical building block\\" geometric shapes such as triangles gave such systems that appearance. One of the first systems that used such characters, the canonical example that others followed, was the Commodore PET, which had many of them within its PETSCII font set. The original PET relied to such a degree on these characters that it printed them on its keyboard, as can be seen here, an example that other systems soon copied. Another good example of a system that relied on semigraphical characters is the venerable Sharp MZ80K, which had no high-resolution graphics, nor reprogrammable characters, but relied fully on an extended font set with many pseudo graphical characters.old-computers.com Entry on the Sharp MZ80K mentions the lack of graphics capabilities With these it was still possible to generate games that looked like the system had high- resolution graphics.A YouTube movie showing a game running on the MZ80K Some of the systems that had a programmable font set, but did not have a real high resolution raster graphics hardware, came with default character sets to be uploaded in character set RAM, and these sets often incorporated the ideas mentioned here, although it was often also the case that dedicated semigraphical characters were defined as needed. Systems that relied on semigraphical characters Examples of systems that relied heavily on semigraphical characters for their graphics are: * The original IBM PC with the MDA offered no form of graphics other than the box-drawing characters of its default hardware code page 437. * The Commodore PET was one of the first systems to rely heavily on semigraphical characters, to get any form of graphics on screen. * The Sinclair ZX80 and ZX81 relied on block graphics characters for a low-resolution graphics of 64√ó48 pixels black-and-white or 32√ó48 in black, white, and dithered gray as seen in the ZX80 character set and ZX81 character set. * The Mattel Aquarius relied completely on its characterset for games, even though it was marketed through toy-shops. It never became a commercial success partly because of this limitation, which was outdated at the time.Page describing the characterset of the Aquarius * The Panasonic JR-200 also used semigraphical characters in combination with block graphics. * The Sharp MZ series of computers offered no highres or programmable characters, but did have a very complete set of semigraphical characters. - and so still offered many visually nice games Games on the MZ-80K relied on its great set of semigraphical characters * The Compukit UK101 (clone of the popular Ohio Scientific superboard) also was a very early system that relied on its great characterset. * The text modes of later Apple II computers, beginning with the Apple IIc and the enhanced version of the Apple IIe, supported the MouseText character set, which replaced flashing uppercase characters when enabled. Although these Apple systems did not rely on these character sets they did play a role in simulating GUI like graphics of their more advanced family members, while still in text mode.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in hardcover by Tor Books in July 2003; a regular paperback edition followed from the same publisher in July 2004. According to the table of contents the book includes a listing of \\"The Conan Novels in Chronological Order\\" at the end of the text; however, at least in the paperback edition, the list provided includes only Conan novels published by Tor and is not chronological, either in terms of content or publication. Plot The Aquilonian Empire, bent on expansion, invades southern Cimmeria, occupying a number of villages and building the armed encampment of Fort Venarium to keep them pacified. The Cimmerian villagers, including young Conan's family, bear the Aquilonian yoke resentfully but stoically. Conan himself, a boy of twelve, is kept down as much by his overbearing blacksmith father as the invaders. Conflict builds as Count Stercus, the occupiers' lecherous commander, seizes the weaver's daughter Tarla, whom Conan also admires. Both she and his parents perish during the tensions. Eventually he joins the force of northern Cimmerians gathering to drive out the Aquilonians, participating in the sack of Venarium and the warriors' subsequent vengeful drive south into Aquilonia. Unusually for a Conan story, the supernatural is relatively absent, confined largely to appearances of a demonic bird and an enormous serpent, and a seer's foretelling of Conan's destiny, which in the manner common to such prophecies, the youth misinterprets. Reception Roland Green of Booklist, himself an author of earlier Conan novels, wrote \\"Among Conan's many limners, Turtledove distinguishes himself with an unmatched portrait of Cimmerian society and a fine, intelligent characterization of the young barbarian.\\"Booklist, v. 99, no. 22, August 2003, p. 1969.

Only Conan diehards and Turtledove completists will be likely to pick up this sword-with-little- sorcery novel.\\"Publishers Weekly, 2003, as reproduced on Amazon.com.

Because his brothers died young, all later Landgraves in the Rotenburg Quarter are descendants of Ernest. Hence, Ernest is known as the ancestor of the Catholic Rotenburg Quarter, a group of junior lines of the House of Hesse.  Family  Ernst was the eleventh child of the second marriage of the Landgrave Maurice of Hesse-Kassel (1572‚Äì1632) with Juliane of Nassau-Dillenburg (1587‚Äì1643). He was a great- grandson of Philip I \\"the Magnanimous\\". Landgrave Ernst married in 1647 in Frankfurt with Countess Maria Eleonore of Solms-Lich (1632‚Äì1689). Two sons from this marriage outlived Ernest: William (1648‚Äì1725) and Charles (1649‚Äì1711).  Life  Ernest was brought up as a Calvinist during the Thirty Years' War. He made his Grand Tour to France and Italy, and fought with Hesse- Kassel during the final years of the war, for example at the Battle of N√∂rdlingen on 3 August 1645. In 1647, the army of Landgravine Amalie Elisabeth reconquered Lower Katzenelnbogen and returned it to Hesse-Kassel. In 1649, Ernest came of age and received Lower Katzenelnbogen. This made him the founder of the Hesse-Rheinfels line. Hesse-Rheinfels was not considered sovereign: it remained under the sovereignty of Hesse-Kassel, as did the other parts of the Rotenburg Quarter. Details of the relationship between Hesse- Rheinfels and Hesse-Kassel were laid down in a series of house treaties; nevertheless, political and judicial disputes often arose between the two houses. Ernest chose Burg Rheinfels castle, above St. Goar on the left bank of the Rhine, as his residence and extended the castle to an imposing fortress. The new Landgrave held his official into St. Goar on 30 March 1649. The construction activities associated with the extension of his castle and the fact that many landgraviate authorities resided at Rheinfels, contributed significantly to the economic boom of St. Goar, which had suffered severely from the Thirty Years' War. Ernest and his family converted to Catholicism on 6 January 1652 in Cologne. However, he could not make Catholicism the established religion in his territory, because it fell under the jurisdiction of Hesse-Kassel and his half-nephew Landgrave William VI would not allow Ernest to undermine his authority and deviate from Calvinism, the established religion in Hesse-Kassel. In 1654, a compromise was reached: the Treaty of Ravensburg allowed Ernest to create three Catholic parishes in his landgraviate, in St. Goar, Nast√§tten and Langen-Schwalbach. After the death of his brothers Frederick in 1655 and Herman IV in 1658, he inherited their sections of the Rotenburg Quarter. He then called himself Ernest of Hesse- Rotenburg-Rheinfels. Ernest was very interested in religious matters; he was also religiously tolerant. In 1666, he had the Rheinfelsen Book of Hymns printed, which contained both Catholic and Lutheran and Reformed hymns. Ernest corresponded with the leading scholars of his time, such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Ernest died in 1693 and was buried, at his request, in the Pilgrimage Church in Bornhofen Monastery in Kamp-Bornhofen.

He is a member of the Democratic Party,\\"3 Dems, 2 Republicans Elected to Executive Council\\". Windham Patch, November 7, 2012. and was the Democratic nominee for Governor of New Hampshire in 2016. He was a candidate for a two- year term as New Hampshire Secretary of State in the New Hampshire General Court's December 5 election, which he lost to incumbent Bill Gardner. Early life and education Van Ostern was born in Carlsbad, California. He moved repeatedly as a young child, arriving in New Hampshire in 2001 in his early twenties. He attended high school at Maggie Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies in Richmond, Virginia, and college in Washington, D.C. at George Washington University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2000 in International Relations. He received an MBA from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire in 2009. Professional career Van Ostern currently works as Vice President of Workforce Solutions at Southern New Hampshire University. He previously helped SNHU launch College for America, a nonprofit school focused on providing a college education to individuals within the work force interested in furthering their education. College for America works directly with students‚Äô employers to ensure that each student can gain their education while continuing their career, usually with little or no debt. Van Ostern joined the school shortly before its launch in 2013. Previously, he was a business manager at Stonyfield, Inc., where he managed various brands and business lines for the world's largest organic yogurt maker. In 2004, he founded a business-consulting firm called Washington Street Consulting. As the principal of his consulting firm, Van Ostern advised over 30 nonprofits and small businesses. He has also served as a senior advisor to various elected officials including U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster, and before moving to New Hampshire in 2001. Political career Van Ostern won a seat on the New Hampshire Executive Council in 2012, succeeding former Executive Councilor Daniel St. Hilaire. He was re-elected in 2014. Van Ostern was the Democratic Party's nominee for Governor of New Hampshire in 2016, winning the primary election by a vote of 52 percent to Steve Marchand's 25% and Mark Connolly's 20 percent, and losing the general election by a vote of 47 percent to Chris Sununu's 49 percent. =Commuter rail= Van Ostern was first elected to the Executive Council after campaigning on the importance of building passenger rail from Boston to central New Hampshire. The New Hampshire Capitol Corridor rail project was halted by the Executive Council in 2011, but continued in 2013 after Van Ostern was elected. A study focused on the production of the rail system and funded by the state of New Hampshire was completed in 2015, finding that rail from Boston to Manchester would result in a projected 5,600 new permanent jobs and 3,630 additional construction jobs. =Healthcare and reproductive rights= Van Ostern has been a strong advocate for providing accessible healthcare options for all New Hampshire citizens. In 2014, he voted with a majority 3-2 on the Executive Council to enact the New Hampshire Health Protection Plan, which has since expanded Medicaid to over 40,000 New Hampshire citizens. Van Ostern publicly opposed Republican members of the Executive Council when they voted against funding family planning services at New Hampshire's Planned Parenthood health centers in both 2011 and 2015, and in 2015 he was awarded the Champion of Choice award by NARAL Pro- Choice New Hampshire, the state's largest grassroots organization dedicated solely to reproductive rights. =Ending the 2014‚Äì2015 Fairpoint strike= Van Ostern at a 2016 gubernatorial candidate forum steered by former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. and former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman. In October 2014, 1,700 workers at Fairpoint Communications in New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont went on strike after the company froze pensions, implemented pay reductions for new employees, and limited health care benefits. By late November, negotiations between the two sides had reached an impasse. On December 23, Van Ostern asked state officials to delay a proposed $13 million contract for state phone and data service with Fairpoint, citing the poor consumer service levels in the wake of the strike. Members of the striking labor union, IBEW, used the contract delay to call on the company to return to negotiations. Negotiations between the company and striking workers resumed on January 4, 2015 and the contract was passed unanimously on the Executive Council later that month. The strike was resolved in early February, and was the nation's largest and longest in 2014. =2018 campaign for Secretary of State= In 2018, Van Ostern was a candidate for New Hampshire Secretary of State. The New Hampshire General Court selects the Secretary of State, and Van Osten's campaign against longtime incumbent Bill Gardner, a nominal Democrat who supports Republican election and voting proposals, was based in part on the Democratic Party gaining control of both the New Hampshire Senate and New Hampshire House of Representatives in the 2018 elections. Gardner won the December 5 legislative election, 209 votes to 205. Personal life Van Ostern lives in Concord, New Hampshire, with his wife, two sons, and their dog.

MINLOG is based on first ordernatural deduction calculus. It is intended to reason about computable functionals, using minimal rather than classical or intuitionistic logic. The primary motivation behind MINLOG is to exploit the proofs-as-programs paradigm for program development and program verification. Proofs are, in fact, treated as first-class objects, which can be normalized. If a formula is existential, then its proof can be used for reading off an instance of it or changed appropriately for program development by proof transformation. To this end, MINLOG is equipped with tools to extract functional programs directly from proof terms. This also applies to non-constructive proofs, using a refined A-translation. The system is supported by automatic proof search and normalization by evaluation as an efficient term rewriting device.

The firm began as job printers, stationers, and manufacturers in 1862, when Tuer joined with Abraham Field (1830‚Äì1891), an established producer of registers and log books. Among their early successes was the invention by Tuer of Stickphast Paste, a clean, vegetable-based product that quickly became the standard office paste (and which was still being manufactured under new ownership as late as the mid 20th century). Profits from this and other inventions allowed Tuer, the more adventurous partner, to pursue his publishing ambitions. From the beginning, the Leadenhall Press output reflected his imagination, curiosity, and interest in the full range of printing and book production techniques. The Leadenhall Press imprint first appeared in 1872 in the firm's trade publication, Paper & Printing Trades Journal, as 'Ye Leadenhall Workes.' Field & Tuer occasionally printed books for other publishers and published sporadically beginning in 1869, but it was not until ten years later that the first official book in the Leadenhall Press catalogue appeared: Tuer's own Luxurious Bathing. The following year, Tuer launched the influential Printers' International Specimen Exchange, an annual survey collection of examples printed and submitted by printers and their employees. Under Tuer's guidance, the Leadenhall Press became an innovative force during the 1880s, issuing as many as 40 books a year, including trade titles for as little as sixpence, as well as limited editions costing several guineas. Although perhaps best known today for children's book reprints, chapbook revivals illustrated by Joseph Crawhall, and several of elaborate productions of Tuer's own works, the Leadenhall Press catalogue included publications on a wide range of subjects for all tastes. Although the \\"cheap editions\\" of some titles could be plain and undistinguished, great care was given to the design and printing of many of the series books that were issued only in inexpensive formats. The Leadenhall Press published many prominent (and also many forgotten) writers and artists of the time. Wilfrid Meynell acted as a literary advisor, writing and editing several books under the pseudonym 'John Oldcastle,‚Äô and the Press published the first books by Jerome K. Jerome. Other authors included Andrew Lang, Egyptologist W. M. Flinders Petrie, Lady Florence Dixie (feminist sister of the infamous Marquess of Queensberry), Max O'Rell, Louis Fagan of the British Museum, J. A. Fuller Maitland, Grant Allen, and Count Eric Stenbock. Oscar Wilde appeared in the poetry collection A Book of Jousts in 1888, and his mother, Lady Jane Wilde contributed to the periodical Bairns' Annual. The Press quickly earned a reputation for excellence in reproducing art; the first edition of Songs of the North (1885) included works by Burne-Jones, Whistler, and Frederick Sandys, among others. In addition to Joseph Crawhall, other artists who illustrated Leadenhall Press books included Randolph Caldecott, Georgie Gaskin, Tristram Ellis, William Luker Jr., and Punch cartoonists Phil May, Charles Keene and Linley Sambourne. In 1892, after the retirement and death of Abraham Field, the company was incorporated as The Leadenhall Press, Ltd. Fewer books were published during the 1890s, but the quality remained high, often reflecting Tuer's antiquarian and collecting interests. Publishing operations ceased a few years after Tuer‚Äôs death in 1900, when the Press reverted largely to its original job printing and stationery business until 1927, when it was dissolved following the death of Mrs. Tuer. Between 1879 and 1905, the Leadenhall Press issued over 400 titles, not counting several different editions of some books.  References   Bibliography  * \\"Andrew W. Tuer\\".

Origin Born to a certain landlord Gurban beg during the reign of Sultan Husayn in 1703, he was of noble birth. Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary cites a legend calling him the grandson of an Armenian priest who converted to Islam. Biographer Haji Seyid Abdulhamid mentions him as a 7th generation descendant of Darvish Mohammad Khan, last khan of Shaki before Safavid Invasion of Shirvan. Petrushevsky also thought of him being either Udi or Armenian origin. There are also some indications that he may have been descended from Shirvanshahs.  Rebellion against Nader Shah  He was supported by locals in opposition to corrupt Afsharid appointed viceroy Malik Najaf. His name was frequently mentioned in annals regarding to Nader's Dagestan campaign. He was confirmed by Nader as an overseer to check corruption of Malik Najaf. However viceroy protested against it, causing locals to rebel. In course of rebellion, despite losing 500 families to Nader, Chalabi managed to murder Malik Najaf in 1743. To punish disobedience, Nader attacked Shaki in 1744 and sieged the Galarsan-Gorarsan fortress where Haji Chalabi took refuge. The name of the fortress G…ôl…ôrs…ôn G√∂r…ôrs…ôn which means in Azerbaijani language \\"Come and see\\" derives from the historic episode related to the siege. When Nader Shah sent an ultimatum to surrender, Chalabi sent a response letter saying \\"Come and see\\". Outraged shah ordered to destroy the rest of the town. He successfully defended against a second attack from Nader in February 1745. However he submitted to Nader in March 1746, asking for forgiveness. Nader approved his submission and forgave him, appointing Malik Najaf's nephew Malik Jafar as new governor and Haji Chalabi as his overseer. Firman of Nadir Shah, which answers a petition by the inhabitants of Shakki, who requested that the local ruler Ja'far should be replaced by the former rebel Haji Chalabi. The request is turned down and the inhabitants are ordered to accept the authority of Ja'far.  Reign  He declared his independence as the khan when Nader was murdered in 1747. Using power vacuum, Chalabi raided south as far as Tabriz and became a major power in the region with strong army. His first target was Karabakh in 1748, where he made an alliance of Melikdoms of Karabakh and rival branches of Javanshir clan, although nothing came out of it. Alarmed local rulers, namely Panah khan of Karabakh, Heydargulu khan of Nakhchivan, Shahverdi khan of Ganja, Kazim khan of Karadagh concluded alliance against Shaki Khanate. They were invited by Teimuraz II who wished to join their alliance, but in fact capturing them as hostages, demanding tributes. Having received the news, Chalabi khan and his army rushed to the aid of their former enemies. His forces prevailed in the battle against Georgian prince Heraclius in June 1752 near Aghstafa river and routed them to Tbilisi. Chalabi khan appointed his son Aghakishi beg as viceroy to newly conquered territories of Ganja, Kazakh and Borchali. Subsequently, in 1755, in an attempt to establish his hegemony over the Shirvan Khanate, Haji Chalabi was defeated by Huseynali khan of Quba and the result of this defeat was the decline of the power of Sheki Khanate. Chalabi died same year from an illness.

In 1927, the South African Railways placed ten Class U Union Garratt articulated steam locomotives with a 2-6-2+2-6-2 Double Prairie type wheel arrangement in service. The locomotive design embodied the Garratt design at the front end and the Modified Fairlie design at the rear end.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945).

Manufacturer Specifications for the Class GJ 2-6-2+2-6-2 Garratt locomotive were prepared by Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the South African Railways (SAR) in 1925, but the class designation was changed to Class U when orders for its design and construction were placed with Maffei in Munich, Germany. The locomotive design deviated from the Garratt principle, the patent of which was held by Beyer, Peacock and Company, and the end result was a hybrid locomotive, part Garratt and part Modified Fairlie. Ten locomotives were delivered in 1927, numbered in the range from 1370 to 1379.Drawing: 2-6-2-2-6-2 Type Garratt Engine, Class GJ (Ordered as Class U). S.A.R.

Drawing Office/Tekenkantoor, Pretoria. p. 35. Characteristics The front end of the locomotive was of a typical Garratt arrangement with a water bunker mounted on the front engine unit's frame, while the rear end was constructed in the Modified Fairlie fashion with the coal bunker mounted on a rigid extension of the locomotive's main frame and with the pivoting rear engine unit positioned beneath the coal bunker. One reason which had been put forward for the construction of the rear end on the Modified Fairlie principle was to enable the coal bunker to be rigidly in line with the boiler frame to ensure a satisfactory arrangement for the installation of the mechanical stoker. Since the locomotive was neither Garratt nor Modified Fairlie, its unique configuration was dubbed Union Garratt. The locomotives were superheated and had round-topped fireboxes, Walschaerts valve gear and bar frames. To enable the longest boiler possible without increasing the overall length of the locomotive, the front engine unit was tucked in underneath the boiler frame somewhat further than was usual on a purebred Garratt locomotive. An additional underbelly water tank compensated for the resulting diminished water capacity of the front water bunker. All the engine's water was carried in the front bunker tank and in the large underbelly tank, each tank with a capacity of . The rear bunker carried only coal and had a capacity of . The main frame therefore carried the smokebox, boiler, firebox, cab and coal bunker, as well as the underbelly water tank. The Class U were large and powerful locomotives. With their firegrate, they were originally equipped with mechanical stokers of the duplex type, but these were removed at the Germiston shops in 1937. Two reasons were given for the removal, firstly that the locomotives were being used in short-haul service on the Reef by then and secondly that the stokers were difficult to clear in the event of a blockage. Shortcomings As delivered, the Class U locomotives were found to be somewhat sluggish. An alteration of the exhaust passages, carried out c. 1933, resulted in a considerable improvement, even though the modification was preceded by considerable controversy and correspondence. The Modified Fairlies and the Union Garratt variations of it were not successful and they suffered from the same shortcomings. On the Union Garratt, as on the Modified Fairlie, the frame was also prone to metal fatigue and cracking brought about by the long frame overhang at the rear beyond the engine unit's pivot centre. The overhang, laden with the coal bunker of which more than 80% extended beyond the rear pivot centre, was subjected to severe vertical vibration while the locomotive was in motion and this led to structural weakening of the frame over time. In addition, the rear pivot bearings were subject to quite rapid wear since they carried a considerable additional vertical load compared to those on a purebred Garratt. As was the case with the Modified Fairlie, this required increased frequency of maintenance and, as a consequence, increased operating cost. Service The Union Garratts, referred to as U-boats by the enginemen, were placed in service at Glencoe to work the difficult section of the Natal mainline through Newcastle and the reverses at Ingogo across the continental divide at Laing's Nek to Volksrust. During electrification of the Natal line to Volksrust, completed in 1938, most of them were transferred to Germiston.Soul of A Railway, System 7, Western Transvaal, based in Johannesburg, Part 4. Johannesburg to Germiston by Les Pivnic. Captions 13-14. (Accessed on 28 March 2017) On the Witwatersrand they were used mainly for pick-up work and local workings as haulers. Since they were no longer required to drag freights for hours on end up 1 in 50 (2%) gradients, their mechanical stokers were removed. Two locomotives remained in Natal to be employed on the coal line between Vryheid and Hlobane. Even though the Class U proved to be less successful than the purebred Garratts, some of them remained in service for more than thirty years. All ten were withdrawn from service by 1958. Knuckle couplers In 1927, the SAR began to convert the couplers of its Cape Gauge rolling stock from the Johnston link-and-pin coupling system which had been in use since the establishment of the Cape Government Railways in 1873, to AAR knuckle couplers. Judging from contemporary photographs as well as the official SAR Locomotive Diagram Book and the dimensional locomotive drawings as published by Holland, which were for the most part based on the original as-delivered and unmodified locomotives, the Class U were delivered new with knuckle couplers fitted, as were the Classes 18, GCA, GF and HF which also entered service in 1927. Transition era knuckle coupler Conversion of all rolling stock would take several years and both coupler types could still be seen on rolling stock into the late 1950s. During the transition period, knuckle couplers on locomotives had a horizontal gap and a vertical hole in the knuckle itself to accommodate a link and a pin respectively. This enabled them to couple to vehicles which were still equipped with the older Johnston couplers. Knuckle couplers had first been used in South Africa more than two decades earlier. The Central South African Railways (CSAR) introduced Gould knuckle couplers on the rolling stock of its Limited Express and Imperial Mail passenger trains in 1904. The Limited Express operated between Pretoria and Johannesburg while the Imperial Mail operated between Pretoria and Cape Town. These knuckle-couplers also had split knuckles to accommodate coupling to the old Johnston couplers with a link and pin, since the CSAR retained the old couplers on all their locomotives to keep them compatible with their own goods and older passenger rolling stock as well as with that from the other railways it connected with.Soul of A Railway, System 8, Part 1: Pretoria: including local services, workshops and running sheds, Part 1.

He worked at the Grafeneck and Hadamar Euthanasia Centres, and then at Treblinka extermination camp. Miete was arrested in 1960 and tried in West Germany for participating in the mass murder of at least 300,000 people; in 1965, he was found guilty and sentenced to the maximum penalty, life imprisonment. SS career Miete was born in 1908 in Westerkappeln of the German Empire, the son of a miller and farmer. Miete completed elementary school before his father died in 1921. Together with his brother, Miete worked on the family farm and as a grinder in the flour mill. Miete was married and had three children. At the beginning of 1940, Miete joined the Nazi Party, and he soon became involved in the T-4 Euthanasia Program. The local M√ºnster agriculture chamber advised Miete about a job at Grafeneck Euthanasia Centre, and he accepted an offer to work on the farm that was attached to this killing center.Henry Friedlander (1995). The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, p. 242. From May 1940 to October 1941 he worked at Grafeneck. Miete then became more involved in the killing process at Hadamar Euthanasia Centre, where he worked as a stoker; that is, one who removed corpses from the gas chambers, broke out gold teeth, burned the bodies and performed other tasks around the gas chambers and crematoria. At the end of June 1942, he was transferred to occupied Poland in order to take part in Operation Reinhard, and dispatched to Treblinka. At Treblinka, Miete gained a notorious reputation for his cruelty. He was nicknamed the \\"Angel of Death\\" by the prisoners. Miete was in charge of the fake infirmary known as Lazaret, a small barracks surrounded by the barbed wire fence where the sick, elderly and difficult prisoners were taken away from view directly from newly arrived transports. The children of sick women and children who arrived alone on the transports were sent with them.Shoah (1985). They were shot point blank at the edge of a burial ditch seven metres deep. Miete carried out most of these killings with his own hand,Yitzhak Arad (1987). Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 194-195. aided by his subordinate Willi Mentz nicknamed \\"Frankenstein\\" by the inmates, who alone killed thousands, as well as Max M√∂ller, the \\"Amerikaner\\". Dressed as medic, Miete \\"cured each one with a single pill\\". Miete also supervised the nearby \\"selection\\" square for forced labor in the camp. He would walk about, checking Jewish prisoners. Those whom he deemed too sick or weak to work at the required pace were taken from the selection area to the Lazaret. Miete would stand each man near a pit where a fire was constantly burning, calmly aim his gun and shoot them. Sometimes Miete would instruct the victim to undress first. Miete would also search prisoners. If Miete found money, food, or anything at all, he would beat them brutally before marching them to the Lazaret. In events where Miete found nothing incriminating, he would still fabricate a reason to beat the prisoner and bring him to the Lazaret. Miete also visited the living barracks and hospital room for the prisoners, where he would remove the sick and shoot them.Shperling, Heniek. Fun Letzten Churbn, No. 6, Munich, 1947, p. 11. Miete described his own actions in testimony: Miete also sought out victims from other parts of the camp to be brought to the Lazaret and shot; victims whom Kurt Franz had injured with his hunting rifle or boxing gloves, prisoners who had been whipped for various \\"crimes\\" or other reasons. Miete would decide that these prisoners were too weakened from the blows sustained and no longer fit for work, so he would shoot them. After Treblinka's closure in November 1943, Miete was sent to Trieste. Trial and conviction After the war, Miete fell into American captivity, but was soon released. Thereafter, Miete worked in the family's farming/milling business until 1950, and then as Managing Director of the Savings and Loan Association in Lotte. He was arrested again on 27 May 1960 and held in pre-trial detention at D√ºsseldorf-Derendorf. On 3 September 1965, at the First Treblinka Trial, Miete was found guilty of participating in the mass murder of at least 300,000 people and at least nine people who were shown in detail to him. He was sentenced to life imprisonment there; possibly released in the mid-1980s, and retiring near Osnabr√ºck, into his own Tyrolean house bought with the loot from Treblinka.

Unlike the past structure-centered theory, OIT focuses on the process of organizing in dynamic, information-rich environments. Given that, it contents that the main activity of organizations is the process of making sense of equivocal information. Organizational members are instrumental to reduce equivocality and achieve sensemaking through some strategies ‚Äî enactment, selection, and retention of information. With a framework that is interdisciplinary in nature, organizational information theory's desire to eliminate both ambiguity and complexity from workplace messaging builds upon earlier findings from general systems theory and phenomenology. Assumptions 1\\\\. Human organizations exist in an information environment Unlike senders and receivers models, OIT stands on the situational perspective. Karl Weick views a human organization as an open social system. People in that system develop a mechanism to establish goals, obtain and process information, or perceive the environment. In this process, people and the environment come to conclusions on \\"what's going on here?\\". Colville believes that this attributional process is retrospective. Take an education institutions as an example. A university can obtain information regarding students' needs in numerous ways. It might create feedback section in its website. It could organize alumni panels or academic affairs to attract prospective students and collect concrete questions they are interested in. It may also conduct the survey or host focus group to get the information. After that, the stuff of the university have to decide how to deal with these information, based on which, it has to set and accomplish its goals for current and prospective students. 2\\\\. The information an organization receives differs in terms of equivocality Weick's posits that numerous feasible interpretations of reality exist when organizations process information. Their varying levels of understandability lead to different outcomes of information inputs. In other academic works, scholars tend to say that messages are uncertain or ambiguous. While according to OIT, messages are described to be equivocal. believes that people proactively exclude a number of possibilities to perceive what is going on in the environment. Due to OIT's situational perspective, the meanings of messages consist of the messages, the interpretations of receivers, and the interactional context. However, ambiguity and uncertainty can mean that a standard answer - the only one true objective interpretation - exists. Also, Weick emphasizes that \\"the equivocality is the engine that motivates people to organize\\". Maitlis and Christianson states that the equivocality trigger sensemaking for three reasons: environment jolts and organizational crises, threats to identity, and planned change interventions. 3\\\\. Human organizations engage in information processing to reduce equivocality of information Based upon the first two assumption, OIT proposes that information processing within organizations is a social activity. Sharing is the key feature of organizational information processing. In that particular context, members jointly make sense the reality by reducing equivocality. It other words, the sensemaking is a joint responsibility which includes numerous interdependent people to accomplish. In this process, organizations and its members combine actions and attributions together in order to find the balance between the complexity of thoughts and the simplicity of actions.  Key concepts  = The organization = In order to place Weick's vision regarding Organizational Information Theory into proper working context, exploring his view regarding what constitutes the organization and how its individuals embody that construct might yield significant insights. From a fundamental standpoint, he shared a belief that organizational validation is derived---not through bricks and mortar, or locale‚Äîbut from a series of events which enable entities to \\"collect, manage and use the information they receive.\\" In elaborating further on what constitutes an organization during early writings outlining OIT, Weick said, \\"The word organization is a noun and it is also a myth. if one looks for an organization, one will not find it. What will be found is that there are events linked together, that transpire within concrete walls and these sequences, their pathways, their timing, are the forms we erroneously make into substances when we talk about an organization\\". When viewed in this modular fashion, the organization meets Weick's theoretical vision by encompassing parameters that are less bound by concrete, wood, and structural restraints and more by an ability to serve as a repository where information can be consistently and effectively channeled. Taking these defining characteristics into account, proper channel execution relies on maximization of messaging clarity, context, delivery and evolution through any system. One example as to how these interactions might unfold on a more granular level within these confines can be gleaned through Weick's double interact loop, which he considers the \\"building blocks of every organization\\". Simply put, double interacts describe interpersonal exchanges that, inherently, occur across the organizational chain of command and in life, itself. Thus: \\"An act occurs when you say something (Can I have a Popsicle?). An interact occurs when you say something and I respond (\\"No, it will spoil your dinner). A double interact occurs when you say something, I respond to that, then you respond to that, adjusting the first statement (\\"Well, how about half a Popsicle?) Weick envisions the organization as a system taking in equivocal information from its environment, trying to make sense of that information, and using what was learned for the future. As such, organizations evolve as they make sense out of themselves and the environment\\". \\"These communication cycles are the reason Weick focuses more on relationships within an organization than he does on an individual's talent or performance. He believes that many outside consultants gloss over the importance of the double interact because they depart the scene before the effects of their recommended action bounce back to affect the actor\\". By allowing us to consider the organization in this alternative framework, Organizational Information Theory provides us with a robust platform from which to explore the communication process, literally, as it unfolds. = Loose coupling and the information environment = In developing Organizational Information Theory, Weick took a \\"social psychological stance that notes that individual behavior is more a function of the situation than of personal traits or role definitions. Therefore, people are 'loosely connected' in most organizations and have a large latitude for action\\". As a way of formalizing this phenomenon, he \\"invites us to use the metaphor \\"loose coupling\\" in order to better understand organizations and aspects of organizations --particularly the variant kinds of connections that exist within organizations--that are either marginalized, ignored, or suppressed by normative bureaucracy\\". So, in much the same way he suggested that organizations be viewed through a non-traditional lens in structure, he acknowledges that, by doing so, one may have to consider circumstances where \\"several means can produce the same result, while offering the appearance that lack of coordination, absence of regulations, and very slow feedback times are the norm\\". While many might view these nuances as roadblocks or impediments to progress, Organizational Information Theory views each one as a catalyst for improved performance and positive change through: \\"increased sensitivity to a shifting environment, room for adaptation and creative solutions to develop, sub-system breakdown without damaging the entire organization, persistence through rapid environmental fluctuations and fostering an attitude where self-determination by the actors is key\\". Another overriding component of Weick's approach is that information afforded by the organization's environment---including the culture within the organizational environment itself---can impact the behaviors and interpretation of behaviors of those within the organization. Thus, creation of organizational knowledge is impacted by each person's personal schema as well as the backdrop of the organization's objectives. The organization must sift through the available information to filter out the valuable from the extraneous. Additionally, the organization must both interpret the information and coordinate that information to \\"make it meaningful for the members of the organization and its goals.\\" In order to construct meaning from these messages in their environment, the organization must reduce equivocality, while committing to an interpretation of the message which matches its culture and overall mission. Accordingly, the \\"flashlight analogy\\" is used to explain the inseparability of action and knowledge present in this theory. One should imagine he is in a dark field at night with only a flashlight. He can vaguely pick out objects around him, but can't really tell what they are. Is that lump in the distance a bush or a dangerous animal? When he turns on his flashlight, however, he creates a circle of light that allows him to see clearly and act with relative clarity. The act of turning on the flashlight effectively created a new environment that allowed him to interpret the world around him. There is still only a single circle of light, though, and what remains outside that circle is still just as mysterious, unless the flashlight is redirected. With organizational information theory, the flashlight is mental. The environment is located in the mind of the actor and is imposed on him by his experiences, which makes them more meaningful. = Equivocality = Based on the number of rapidly moving parts within any organization (i.e., information flows, individuals, etc....) the foundation upon which messaging is received constantly shifts, thus leaving room for unintended consequences relative to true intent and meaning. Equivocality arises when communication outreach \\"can be given different interpretations because their substance is ambiguous, conflicted, obscure, or introduces uncertainty into a situation\\". Organizational Information Theory provides a knowledge base and framework which can help mitigate these risks through by decreasing the level of ambiguity present during relevant communication activities. Simultaneously, it serves as a construct whose potential for growth stems from active use \\"communicating and organizing\\" and \\"reducing the amount of equivocality\\" within a specified domain. In looking at how equivocality evolves more closely, it can also manifest itself as a signature for highly interpretive events, along with those where the parameters (and uncertainty levels) are, traditionally, much more concrete. For instance, \\"equivocality also describes situations where there is agreement on a set of descriptive criteria (say, desirable market/undesirable market) but disagreement on either their boundaries (i.e., the point at which markets go from being desirable to undesirable) or on their application to a particular situation (whether a particular market is desirable or undesirable). Managing equivocality requires coordinating meaning among members of an organization, and is an essential part of organizing. Equivocality arises because everyone's experiences are unique; individuals and communities develop their own sets of values and beliefs and tend to interpret events differently. Equivocality also may result from unreliable or conflicting information sources, noisy communication channels, differing or ambiguous goals and preferences, vague roles and responsibilities, or disparate political interests\\". =Sensemaking= Karl Weick's Organizational Information Theory views organizations as \\" 'sensemaking systems' which incessantly create and re-create conceptions of themselves and of all around them\\". From a less clinical (and more intuitive) perspective, Weick and his collaborator, Kathleen M. Sutcliffe, jointly describe sensemaking as an action which \\"involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words or speech and that serves as a springboard to action\\". In its more defined organizational context, sensemaking can be looked at as a process \\"that is applied to both individuals and groups who are faced with new information that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs\\". In factoring the uneasiness (or cognitive dissonance) that results from this experience, they will create narratives to fit the story which serve both as a buffer and a guiding light for further renditions of the story. \\"This explains how, for example, religious groups can have such stringent beliefs, how political parties can be confident in their diametrically-opposed positions, how organizations can develop very different cultures, and how individuals can develop very different interpretations for the same event\\". The process of sensemaking usually starts with a circumstance or problem which requires a certain level of interpretation by others (i.e., something did or did not happen). Whether it is consciously or unconsciously driven, those involved then make a commitment to a perceived viewpoint surrounding those facts. \\"Commitment forms around the interpretation to bind the interpretation to future action. When publicly communicated, commitment is especially strong. Individuals are motivated to justify their commitments, so they initiate future actions and continually refine their interpretation of the original event so that their commitment to a course of action is deemed appropriate. These new actions produce \\"evidence\\" that validates the interpretation and are used to increase decision confidence\\". These are critical facets which surround the sensemaking process: a) sensemaking starts with noticing and bracketing b) sensemaking is about labeling c) sensemaking is retrospective d) sensemaking is about presumption e) sensemaking is social and systemic f) sensemaking is about action g) sensemaking is about organizing through communication The idea of sensemaking is also a theme within Organizational Information Theory. Organizational sensemaking contrasts with organizational interpretation. When an organization interprets information, there is already a frame of reference in place and this is enough information for an organization to change course. Sensemaking occurs, however, when no initial frame of reference exists and no obvious connection presents itself. According to Weick, sensemaking can be driven by beliefs or actions. Beliefs shape what people experience and give form for the actions they take. For example, disagreement about beliefs in an organization can lead to arguments. This is a form of sensemaking. Notably, sensemaking make impact on organizations in three aspects: strategic change, organizational learning, and innovation and creativity. Regarding strategic change, individuals are triggered to alter their own roles and behaviors and also help others to coordinate with their new changes. Then a new organizational order about strategies will be constructed. As for learning, on the one hand, people will learn from error. Organizational understandings and routines will be revised, updated and strengthened in response to the errors. On the other hand, sensemaking about material gathered and available options make a great contribution to learn in more conventional contexts, especially in knowledge- intensive work settings. The details about its impact on innovation can be seen in \\"extension\\" section. = Choice Points, Behavior Cycles and Assembly Rules = When information messaging remains an unclear variable, organizations will usually revert to a number of Organizational Information Theory-based methodologies which are designed to encourage ambiguity reduction: 1\\\\. Choice Points--Describes an organization's decision to ask: \\"should we attend to some aspect of our environment that was rejected before?\\" Re-tracing one's steps can provide both management and individuals with a comfort zone in addressing frequency and volume regarding messaging, lest anything have been missed. 2\\\\. Behavior Cycles--Represents \\"deliberate communication activities on the part of an organization to decrease levels of ambiguity\\". Importantly, degrees of messaging equivocality have a direct impact on how many cycles are required to alleviate its effects. Within this realm, three distinct steps emerge that are each focused on providing messaging clarity: act, response and adjustment. Each is designed to facilitate the retention and selection process. Examples of behavior cycles include staff meetings, coffee-break rumoring, e-mail conversations, internal reports, etc.. 3\\\\. Assembly Rules--Signifies a broader construct, \\"which may include evaluating how standard operating procedures (SOP) are carried out, along with chain-of-command designations\\". By its nature, this approach explores protocol measures that might be effective in handling ambiguity, as well as, how related processes might unfold.  Strategies  = The Principles of Equivocality = Three critical principles, or relationship, guide the process of equivocality reduction. They are: the relationship among equivocality, the rules and the cycles must be carefully analyzed; the relationship between the number of rules and amount of cycles; the relationship between the number of cycles and the amount of equivocality. To be specific, Weick posits that the amount of perceived equivocality influence the number of rules. Generally speaking, there is a negative correlation between the level of equivocality and the amount of rules. To be specific, the more equivocal the message is, the few rules are available to process that information. Meanwhile, an inverse relationship also exists between rules and cycles. In other words, fewer rules lead to more use of cycles. Then, the increasing number of cycles used can reduce the equivocality. =Stages of Equivocality Reduction= According to Weick, organizations experience continuous change and are ever-adapting, as opposed to a change followed by a period of stagnancy. Building off of Orlikowski‚Äôs idea that the changes that take place are not necessarily planned, but rather inevitably occur over time, Organizational Information Theory explains how organizations use information found within the environment to interpret and adjust to change. In the event that the information available in the information environment is highly equivocal, the organization engages in a series of cycles that serve as a means to reduce uncertainty about the message. A highly equivocal message might require several iterations of the behavior cycles. An inverse relationship exists between the number of rules established by the organization to reduce equivocality and the number of cycles necessary to reduce equivocality. Similarly, the more cycles used, the less equivocality remains. Enactment Weick emphasizes the role of action, or enactment in change within an organization. Through a combination of individuals with existing data and external knowledge, and through iterative process of trial and error, ideas are refined until they become actualized. Enactment also plays a key role in the idea of sensemaking, the process by which people give meaning to experience. Essentially, the action helps to define the meaning, making those within the organization's environment responsible for the environment itself. Selection Upon analyzing the information the organization possesses, the selection stage includes evaluation of outstanding information necessary to further reduce equivocality. The organization must decide the best method for obtaining the remaining information. Generally, the decision-makers of the organization play a key role in this stage. There are three critical processes happening in this stage: 1) members make a choice among interpretations; 2) members choose the type and amount of rules for processing those interpretations; 3) communication cycles start to work on those interpretations. Retention The final stage occurs when the organization sifts through the information it has compiled in attempts to adapt to change, and determines which information is beneficial and worth utilizing again. Inefficient, superfluous and otherwise unnecessary information that do not contribute to the completion of the project or reduction of equivocality will most likely not be retained for future application of similar project.  Applications  = Application in Health Care = One of the key real-world applications regarding Weick's concept of Organizational Information Theory can be found in healthcare. There, he went so far as to personally develop a dedicated health communications approach which \\"emphasizes the central role of communication and information processing within social groups and institutions\\". Specifically, Weick's work draws correlations between accuracy of information and the ability of organizations to adapt to change. Weick's model of organizing plays a powerful role in improving communication of health care and health promotion. The OIT enables consumers and providers to reduce equivocality when they face complex health care and health promotion situations. \\"In health care and health promotion, enactment processes are used to make sense of different health-related challenges, selection processes are used to choose different courses of action in response to these challenges, and retention processes are used to preserve what was learned from enactment and selection processes for guiding future health care/promotion activities\\". For instance, the theory can evaluate the problems of excessive nurse turnover in public hospital and develop interventions to address the problems. Hospital administrators used to deal with the problem by making efforts in recruiting nurses. Although the strategy attracted more new nurses, it was expensive to maintain the recruitment efforts. Thus, a retention program was generated under the Weick's model of organizing. The program used questionnaires, in- depth interviews and focus group discussion to figure out nurses' concerns (enactment). The research's results identified strategies to solve those problems (selection). Then the program gathered further information about nurses' attitude and advice for these strategies and implemented refined strategies (retention). = Application in Education = Some scholars advocate that loosely coupled system and garbage can model guarantee the flexibility of higher education organizations. Proponents of loose coupling system believe that the university's academic freedom and students' individual identity will be destroyed if administrators tighten up the loose coupling. However, Weick argues that the \\"unpredictability (of an organization) is insufficient evidence for concluding that the elements in a system are loosely coupled\\". Other scholars notice the Weick's warning that loose coupling should not be used as a normative model. Universities will not lose their academic freedom with a tighter coupled system. Frank W. states that \\"They (universities) are tightly coupled in some aspects and uncoupled in other aspects. Tight coupling occurs when an issue supports the status quo. Uncoupling occurs when an issue challenges the status quo\\". Weick's model of organizing can be applied to reduce equivocality in the large-lecture classroom and to increase students' engagement. Large-lecture classroom can be recognized as an information environment with various degrees of equivocality. Students enact assembly rules to make sense of messages in class with low equivocality. Behavior cycles which focus on act, response and adjustment can be utilized by students to clarify messages with high equivocality. \\"Students assess how the applied rules and cycles affected their ability to interpret the original input's equivocality and decide if additional rules and cycles are needed to develop an effective response to the input\\". Some students feel intimidated when they raise questions in the large-lecture classroom. Thus, the synchronicity and anonymous nature of microblog make itself a second channel to facilitate students' question asking as well as decreases their equivocality. Faculty enables to retain organizational intelligence through microblog format. = Application in Conflict Management = It is difficult to find two parties share exact same interest. Thus, conflict and cooperation coexist with each other in organizations. Institutionalized conflict management is frequently used by managers to create sustained organizations. Metaphors provides a comprehensive approach to understand and interpret the information environment which includes new knowledge and new practices. \\"Metaphor created by subsidiary representatives of the conflict management practice reflects the quality and the depth of institutionalization\\". Metaphors can be recognized as a collective sensemaking and a depict of organizational environment. Individuals are able to make decisions which depends on their metaphors about conflict in organizations. Critiques = Utility = This theory focuses on the process of communication instead of the role of individual actors. It examines the complexities of information processing in lieu of trying to understand people within a group or organization. Additionally, this theory closely examines the act of organizing, rather than organizations themselves. Weick defines organizing as, \\"the resolving of equivocality in an enacted environment by means of interlocked behaviors embedded in conditionally related process\\" and that, \\"human beings organize primarily to help them reduce the information uncertainty in their lives\\". = Logical Consistency = Some scholars argue that this theory fails the test of logical consistency and that people are not necessarily guided by rules in an organization. Some organizational members might not have any interest in communication rules and their actions might have more to do with intuition than anything else. Other critics posit that organizational information theory views the organization as a static entity, rather than one that changes over time. Dynamic adjustments, such as downsizing, outsourcing and even advancements in technology should be taken into consideration when examining an organization‚Äîand organizational information theory does not account for this. Critics of this theory assert that it does not deal significantly with hierarchy or conflict, two prominent themes associated with organizational communications. In some cases, the hierarchical context makes difficulties for sensemaking and proposes a flow of downward negative feedback. Sensemaking process can be applied to explain why employees remain silence in the organization. Two sensemaking resources which are expectation and identity preclude employees from giving upward negative feedback. Employees expect that their negative feedback for supervisors will pose threat to their job security or might be neglected by supervisors. Besides, employees make sense of their own understanding and identify themselves as deficient experts who are unable to make best decisions. = Scope = The theory also neglects the larger social, historical and institutional context. The role of the institutional context and cultural- cognitive institutions in sensemaking should be paid more attention to. According to Taylor and Van Every, \\"what is missing [in Weick‚Äôs 1995 Sensemaking in Organizations version of enactment] ... is an understanding of the organization as a communicational construction or an awareness of the institutionalizing of human society that accompanies organization with its many internal contradictions and tensions\\". Actors are constrained by cognition through socialization in the job, school system and the media when they do sensemaking in institutions. It causes less variety and more stability in institutions. In order to expand the theory, social mechanism can be applied to consider how institutions prime, edit and trigger sensemaking besides the traditional cognitive constraint.  Extension of OIT  = Dr. Brenda Dervin: the Sense-Making Approach = As an adjunct to Weick's work regarding organizational information, noted academician (and fellow researcher), Dr. Brenda Dervin, followed a similar path in exploring how ambiguity and uncertainty are handled across platforms. However, in broaching these issues from a more communication-driven perspective Dr. Dervin found that these issues evolve from a different place; one, in fact, that unlike Weick, assumes \\"discontinuity between entities, times and spaces\\". Instead of modularity, \\"each individual is an entity moving through time and space, dealing with other entities which include other people, artifacts, systems, or institutions. The individual's making of sense as a strategy for bridging these gaps is the central metaphor of the Sense-Making Approach\\". By utilizing this alternate prism, Dr. Dervin found that \\"patterns of gap-bridging behavior are better-predicted by the way individuals define the gaps in which they find themselves, than by any attributes that might be typically used to define individuals across space and time, such as demographic categories or personality indicators. Situations and people are constantly changing, but patterns of interaction between people and situations as they are defined by people seem to be somewhat more stable\\". = Organizational Information Theory and Innovation = \\"In 2000, the researchers Doughtery, Borrelli, Munir and O'Sullivan discovered that the level of innovation capability within organizations was connected to the ability of making the right sense of collective experiences in uncertain or ambiguous situations such as radical changes in the market or technology paradigm shifts\\". Instinctively, it seems, the sensemaking systems of less innovative companies appeared to be inhibited by tendencies to \\"play within existing rules...filter out unexpected information or unorthodox competency sets, resulting in groupthink and more of the same\\". Meanwhile, \\"innovative organizations ...dared to challenge existing business logic and made use of new insights\\"...these, in turn, were used to \\"change existing interpretations and schemes and thus, influence the overall evolvement of the organization so that the interpretation schemes themselves became more apt to deal with outside forces\\". Weick proposes three dynamics which are closely relevant to innovation: \\"that the knowledge is both tacit and articulated, that linking processes cut across several levels of organizational action, and that linking processes embody several tensions\\". A study applies these dynamics and organizational sensemaking to analyze how people make sense of market and technology knowledge for product innovation. Innovative organizations have a system of sensemaking that allows actors to \\"construct, bracket, interpret, and rethink the right kinds of market and technology knowledge in the right way for innovation\\". However, actors in non- innovative organizations make sense of knowledge in a separate way. See also: = Computer-mediated Communication(CMC) and Sensemaking = Computer-mediated communication have gradually become an essential part of communication in current work context and organizational settings. Weick proposes that sensemaking away from terminals experiences five procedures: effectuate, triangulate, affiliate, deliberate, and consolidate. According to Garphart, compared with in traditional workplace, sensemaking in electronically enabled work place becomes more complex and ambiguous. and act differently in the above five procedures. To be specific. four distinct features can be seen. Firstly, the process of reciprocity is much confined. The reciprocity of perspectives might be delayed when communicators are at different \\"terminals\\". Also, sensory cues are nearly absent in this process, while textual communication is commonly used. In other words, communication modes are limited. Secondly, the levels of equivocality and the difficulties of sensemaking increase. The problems of understanding computer or new technical terms emerge as a new obstacle to be overcome for achieving sensemaking in organizations. Thirdly, less etcetera principles can be used to in CMC. In other words, CMC tend to build up a rigidly structured communication environment, due to which, people will find it harder to gain additional information from outside the computer system. Lastly, CMC alters the occupational tasks. Some technical background or computer-related knowledge are required to support general occupational tasks. There are two major models proposed to explain the sensemaking with CMC in organizations: Weick's cognitive model and a social interaction model. Weick believes that people will increasingly encounter with problems to make sense information with new technology. Cognitive Model posits states that new computer technologies have a huge impact on sensemaking in organizations in five aspects. First, actions deficiencies always happen because real objects can not be fully captured and represented by simulated images and symbols. Second, comparisons are often deficient due to limited reciprocity of perspectives and nearly absent feedback based on direct action. Third, works at terminals are always solitary and will decrease affiliation of communication. Fourth, constant inflow of information in computer interrupt or even prevent the deliberation. Lastly, sensemaking at terminals always leads to consolidation deficiencies due to self-contained nature of computer. Social Interactional Model, deriving from phenomenological sociology and ethnomethodology, emphasizes the intersubjective and objective features of sensemaking. Intersubjective feature reveals that people always try to obtain subjective meanings of others. In CMC, communicators are required to actively figure out whether they share meanings with others, including computers. In this process, people are expected to use normal form objects, terms and utterances to portray correctly the contexts and experiences in order to let computer recognize. However, increasing number of knowledge are needed to achieve sensemaking than that in traditional workplace. Thus, etcetera principle come into use to deal with vague or implicit meanings. People will actively seek additional information to clarify the meanings. Meanwhile, descriptive vocabularies are used as indexical expressions to assist people to resolve equivocal meanings based on contextual, cultural, technical knowledge and information.

The hook has been repaired after the antler from which it was carved broke. The tusks of the mammoth appear on each side but have mostly been lost due to damage. It is about 12 cm in length. The mammoth is produced in low-relief on both sides of the object. When it was discovered, the broken tail hook had already been repaired. This was achieved by drilling a hole through the mammoth shape, just in front of the broken hook - and inserting in another piece of antler. Spear throwers were first used in western Europe about 20,000 years ago and enabled hunters to launch spears with more force and speed than if they threw just by hand. It was common for them to be decorated with animal carvings. Other types of spear throwers include the perforated batons, which are also often decorated.

Similar to continuous mandatory ventilation in parameters set for the patients pressures and volumes but distinct in its ability to support a patient by either supporting their own effort or providing support when patient effort is not sensed. IMV is frequently paired with additional strategies to improve weaning from ventilator support or to improve cardiovascular stability in patients who may need full life support.  Synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV)  Synchronized Intermittent Mechanical Ventilation is a variation of IMV, in which the ventilator breaths are synchronized with patient inspiratory effort.Sassoon CS, Del Rosario N, Fei R, et al. Influence of pressure- and flow-triggered synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation on inspiratory muscle work. Crit Care Med 1994; 22:1933.Christopher KL, Neff TA, Bowman JL, et al. Demand and continuous flow intermittent mandatory ventilation systems\\" Chest 1985; 87:625. SIMV, with and without pressure support has not been shown to have any advantages over continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) in terms of mortality or weaning success, and has been shown to result in longer weaning times when compared to t-piece trials or gradual reductions in pressure support. Some studies have shown an increase in patient work of breathing when switched from CMV to SIMV, and others have demonstrated potential detrimental effects of SIMV on respiratory muscles and respiratory drive.  Mandatory minute ventilation (MMV)  Mandatory minute ventilation is a mode which requires the operator to determine what the appropriate minute ventilation for the patient should be, and the ventilator then monitors the patient's ability to generate this volume every 7.5 seconds. If the calculation suggests the volume target will not be met, SIMV breaths are delivered at the targeted volume to achieve the desired minute ventilation. Allows spontaneous breathing with automatic adjustments of mandatory ventilation to the meet the patient‚Äôs preset minimum minute volume requirement. If the patient maintains the minute volume settings for VT x f, no mandatory breaths are delivered. If the patient's minute volume is insufficient, mandatory delivery of the preset tidal volume will occur until the minute volume is achieved. The method for monitoring whether or not the patient is meeting the required minute ventilation (VE) is different per ventilator brand and model, but generally there is a window of time being monitored and a smaller window being checked against that larger window (i.e., in the Dr√§ger Evita¬Æ line of mechanical ventilators there is a moving 20-second window and every 7 seconds the current tidal volume and rate are measured against to make a decision for if a mechanical breath is needed to maintain the minute ventilation). MMV is the most optimal mode for weaning in neonatal and pediatric populations and has been shown to reduce long term complications related to mechanical ventilation.  Proportional assist ventilation (PAV)  Proportional assist ventilation is a mode in which the ventilator guarantees the percentage of work regardless of changes in pulmonary compliance and resistance.Younes M. Proportional assist ventilation, a new approach to ventilatory support. Theory. Am Rev Respir Dis 1992; 145(1):114-120. The ventilator varies the tidal volume and pressure based on the patients work of breathing, the amount it delivers is proportional to the percentage of assistance it is set to give. Adaptive support ventilation (ASV)  Adaptive Support Ventilation is a positive pressure mode of mechanical ventilation that is closed-loop controlled. In this mode, the frequency and tidal volume of breaths of a patient on the ventilator are automatically adjusted based on the patient‚Äôs requirements. The lung mechanics data are used to adjust the depth and rate of breaths to minimize the work rate of breathing. In the ASV mode, every breath is synchronized with patient effort if such an effort exists, and otherwise, full mechanical ventilation is provided to the patient. ASV is a patented technology originally described as one of the embodiments of US Patent No. 4986268.Tehrani, Fleur T., \\"Method and Apparatus for Controlling an Artificial Respirator\\" US Patent No. 4986268, issued Jan. 22, 1991. In this invention, the control algorithm computes the optimal rate of respiration to minimize the work rate of breathing. The rationale is to make the patient's breathing pattern comfortable and natural within safe limits, and thereby stimulate spontaneous breathing and reduce the weaning time.

With the building of the South Manchuria Railway, Mukden (now known as Shenyang) became a Russian stronghold, which occupied it after the Boxer Rebellion.(Original from Harvard University)(Original from the University of Michigan) As with all other major powers in China, Russia demanded concessions along with the railroad. During the Boxer Rebellion, Russia became involved due to its presence in the foreign legations. Russian Cossacks formed part of the Eight Nation Alliance relief forces during the Seymour and Gaselee expeditions while Russian forces were also present inside the legations during the sieges in Beijing and Tianjin. These forces operated separately from those involved in the invasion of Manchuria, with the entire operation exclusively directed by Russians. Campaign The Russians invaded Manchuria during the rebellion, which was defended by Manchu bannermen. The bannermen were annihilated as they fought to the death against the Russians, each falling one at a time against a five pronged Russian invasion. The Russian anthropologist Sergei Mikhailovich Shirokogorov reported that the Russians killed many of the Manchus, thousands of them fled south. The Cossacks looted their villages and property and then burnt them down. Manchuria was completely occupied after the fierce fighting that occurred. Boxers attacks on Chinese Eastern Railway The Boxers attacks on the Chinese Eastern Railway during the Boxer Rebellion took place in 1900. In response Russia invaded Manchuria. Chinese Imperial troops engaged in attacks against Russians, in one incident, Chinese troops killed a cossack. Another 15 Russian casualties occurred when Chinese cavalry attacked the Russians. The Boxers destroyed railways and cut lines for telegraphs. The Yen-t'ai coal mines were burned by Chinese forces. The Chinese used arson to destroy a bridge carrying a railway and a barracks in the 27th of July. The Boxers destroyed railways in Manchuria in a strategic manouevre to halt enemy soldiers from moving. Imperial edicts were posted which called for attacks against the Russians, the stations of the South Manchuria Railway came under Boxer control. With the building of the South Manchurian Railway, Mukden became a Russian stronghold, which occupied it after the Boxer Rebellion.(Original from Harvard University)(Original from the University of Michigan) After Russia invaded with regular troops, the railway came under Russian control again. Defence of Yingkou The Battle of Yingkou was a battle where Chinese forces battled against the invading Russian army in the Boxer Rebellion. Unlike the battles in China proper during the Boxer Rebellion, battles between Chinese and foreigners in Manchuria were exclusively between Chinese and Russians. The Russians were the sole force attacking Yingkou, at the time one of the main sea ports of Manchuria. Yingkou was divided into a foreign settlement and a Chinese city. Mishchenko had to engage his reserved troops to win the fight. When the Russians seized the city, a number of Boxers and Chinese Imperial troops managed to pull off an evacuation. A combination of a moat, precipitation, and mud hampered the movement of Russian troops and their guns. Battle of Pai-t'ou-tzu The Battle of Pai-t'ou-tzu (Pinyin: Baitouzi) was an engagement during the Boxer Rebellion between regular Chinese Imperial forces and an outpost of Russian infantry located in Chinese territory. Even before the Boxer rising against foreign influence, an outpost of Russian troops had been located across the Chinese border near the village of Pai-t'ou-tzu, which lay close to Liaoyang. It was garrisoned by 204 Russian troops under Colonel Mishchenko. When hostilities began, the Chinese authorities advanced a guarantee of safe passage in exchange for his retreat to the south of Liaoyang. This was declined, and instead Mishchenko called for more Russian troops to reinforce his position. Before the Russian position could be reinforced, fighting broke out. During the opening stages of the ensuing battle, Chinese guns bombarded the Russian right and front flanks, resulting in 14 Russian deaths and 5 wounded. Firing from long range at high trajectories, the Chinese artillery hit their marks, but at closer range proved inaccurate. Chinese regular infantry armed with rifles advanced, crawling under cover artillery fire towards the Russian defense perimeter of about 350 square feet. When the Russian fire slackened the Chinese troops renewed their attack. Chinese forces alternated between advance and retreat until the Russian position was over- run. Losses on both sides are uncertain but the Russian detachment may have been wiped out.  Battles on Amur River  300px The Battles on the Amur River were border clashes between Chinese Imperial Army troops along with Boxers against Russian forces who aimed for control over the Amur River for navigation. The Chinese summoned all available men to fight, and the Chinese forces and garrisons gathered artillery and bombarded Russian troops and towns across the Amur. Despite the Cossacks repulsing Chinese army crossings into Russia, the Chinese army troops increased the amount of artillery and kept up the bombardment. In revenge for the attacks on Chinese villages, Boxer troops burned Russian towns and almost annihilated a Russian force at Tieling. Russian governor K. N. Gribsky ordered Cossacks to destroy all Chinese posts on Amur river, and Cossacks completed the order during July. On July 20, Russian forces (including 16 infantry companies, a hundred Cossacks and 16 cannons) crossed the Amur near Blagoveshchensk with support from the steamers Selenga and Sungari. On July 20, Russian troops captured Saghalien; on July 22, Aigun. After the victory over the Chinese forces, the general-governor of Amur Region, Nikolai Grodekov, decided to annex the right bank of the Amur River, and sent a telegram to St. Peterburg, but Russian Minister of War Aleksey Kuropatkin forbade such an action: > Because of restoring the good relation with China in the nearest future, His > Majesty decided not to annex any part of China Russian Invasion of Northern and Central Manchuria The Crushing of Boxers in Northern and Central Manchuria was the invasion of the 100,000 strong Russian Army of Manchuria. These events form part of the period known as the Boxer Rebellion. On June 29, the first Russian force‚Äîtwo rifle regiments and some Cossacks from Khabarovsk‚Äîcrossed the Chinese border, followed by units from Blagoveshchensk, Nikolsk-Ussuriski, and other towns. The campaign in Manchuria was conducted by both the regular Imperial army, including Manchu Bannermen and Imperial Chinese troops, and the Boxers. The Russians invaded Manchuria during the rebellion, which was defended by Manchu bannermen. The bannermen were annihilated as they fought to the death against the Russians, each falling one at a time against a five pronged Russian invasion. The Russians killed many of the Manchus, thousands of them fled south. The Russian Cossacks looted some of their villages and property and then burnt them to ashes, but as revenge, the Chinese Boxers and Imperial army came to a large Russian village and killed many civilians and looted and burnt all their houses as revenge and killed many Russian defenders. Manchuria was partially occupied after the fierce fighting that occurred. Aftermath By November 1900 most of Manchuria was secured by the Russian forces. War Minister General Kuropatkin reported that Russian losses were 22 officers and 220 men killed, along with 60 officers and 1223 men wounded. No records exist for Chinese losses, but estimates put them at much higher than Russian casualties. Lieutenant General Nikolai Linevich, for example, gave orders to destroy towns and execute Chinese in retaliation for attacks on the Russian railway in Manchuria. This policy was later changed and at least eight Cossacks were executed by hanging by a military court for crimes against civilians. Sergei Witte advised the Tsar to withdraw Russian forces from Manchuria, but Kuropatkin advocated for a continued Russian presence in Manchuria. The Russians tried to secure agreements favorable to themselves in exchange for withdrawal, but China refused. The Honghuzi continued to plague Manchuria despite multiple attempts aiming for their eradication and mass killings directed at them by Cossack forces. They were enlisted by the Japanese during the Russo-Japanese War to attack the Russians on their rear. =Russo-Japanese War= Japan was angered that Russia had not withdrawn according to the treaty it signed in the Boxer Protocol in which it promised to withdraw from Manchuria.

North Carolina Amendment 1 (often referred to as simply Amendment 1) was a legislatively referred constitutional amendment in North Carolina that (until overruled in federal court) amended the Constitution of North Carolina to prohibit the state from recognizing or performing same-sex marriages or civil unions. The amendment did not prohibit domestic partnership agreements, but defined male‚Äìfemale marriage as \\"the only domestic legal union\\" considered valid or recognized in the state.Amendment One, North Carolina Public Employers, and Domestic Partner BenefitsThe legal impact of Amendment One , ACLU of North Carolina On May 8, 2012, North Carolina voters approved the amendment, 61% to 39%, with a voter turnout of 35%.

Bill information  The long title of Senate Bill 514 is: \\"An Act to Amend the Constitution to Provide That Marriage Between One Man and One Woman is the Only Domestic Legal Union That Shall Be Valid or Recognized in This State.\\" The bill proposed to add a new section to article XIV, which covers miscellaneous provisions. The sections of the bill were: *Section 1 \\"Marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this State. This section does not prohibit a private party from entering into contracts with another private party; nor does this section prohibit courts from adjudicating the rights of private parties pursuant to such contracts.\\" *Section 2 Specifies that the amendment shall be submitted to voters, and defines the ballot text. *Section 3 Specifies that a simple majority vote is required for approval. *Sections 4 and 5 Specify that the amendment will become effective when it is certified by the Secretary of State. Potential effects In a study by Maxine Eichner, Barbara Fedders, Holning Lau, and Rachel Blunk of the University of North Carolina School of Law, the authors discussed how the wording in the proposed amendment could have legal implications beyond banning marriage between same- sex couples. A white paper authored by Lynn Buzzard, William A. Woodruff, and Gregory Wallace of Campbell Law School disagreed with many of those claims.April 2012. Campbell White Paper voteformarriagenc.com Retrieved May 10, 2012. =Employee benefits= Some said that all unmarried couples, both same-sex and opposite-sex, and their children that are receiving domestic- partner benefits as public employees would no longer be eligible for those benefits under this amendment. The second sentence in the amendment sought to address this issue by continuing to allow private-party contracts between employees and employers. For example, a private company could agree to extend health benefits to employees and their partners. However, since \\"domestic legal union\\" was untested language in the courts, the issue was considered likely to face litigation to determine what the actual meaning would be and how it would be implemented. =Legal protections= In addition to restricting benefits to couples in domestic partnerships, the amendment could have also stripped protections for unmarried couples such as domestic violence and stalking protections. If the courts had determined that the language used in the amendment invalidates protections for unmarried couples it could have harmed domestic-violence protections for that population. After passing a similar constitutional amendment in Ohio, several courts ruled that domestic violence protections did not apply to unmarried couples and cases were dismissed or told not to press charges. The courts could have determined that validation of unmarried couples domestic legal union status would violate the amendment. However, the counter argument was that North Carolina's domestic- violence statutes were better defined and included protections for unmarried couples. North Carolina Statute 50B-1, Domestic Violence, states: Adoption and child-visitation protections were also in question. While North Carolina only allows adoption by one unmarried adult, there are cases where children are adopted by two unmarried adults (including same-sex couples) in other states and are now living in North Carolina. Since those relationships would not have been recognized under Amendment One, there were potentially serious consequences. In Potential Legal Impacts of the Proposed Same Sex Marriage Amendment, the authors concluded that in child-custody disputes \\"judges may interpret [amendment one] as an expression of public policy against all non- marital relationships. This interpretation may have caused judges to view such relationships as having a per se negative impact on a child, and fashion custody orders accordingly. They also said that in custody disputes between a parent and non-parent, the courts could decide that one parent's relationship is impermissible since it would validate a domestic legal union other than heterosexual marriage. As with the other protections in question it seemed that the courts would have to decide what the actual interpretation and implementation will be in this area. Other areas of protection that were under question included hospital visitation, emergency medicals decisions, and disposition of deceased partner's remains. Although there are legal documents that can help protect medical and financial security (power of attorney, living will, medical power of attorney), these could have been contested in court based on the argument that they recognize a domestic legal union between the two parties. Issues in estate planning could have arisen through increased litigation contesting wills of unmarried individuals, particularly those in same-sex relationships. Again, the courts could have ruled that any recognition of a domestic legal union between unmarried partners would be unconstitutional and therefore rule those wills and trusts invalid. =Economics= In addition to legal implications, there were concerns that the amendment would harm economic development and vitality. Some felt that business's employee recruitment and retention would be hurt if the most talented prospects did not feel that North Carolina was progressive or representative of their beliefs. Many Fortune 500 companies have implemented policies protecting employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation, which would not be affected by such legislation. =Public knowledge= An April 2012 Public Policy Polling found that only 40% of North Carolina voters actually knew that Amendment 1 bans both same-sex marriage and civil unions, and among those voters who do know the effects of Amendment 1, they opposed it with 60% against and 38% in favor. Among the 27% of voters who thought Amendment 1 banned same-sex marriage only, they supported it with 72% in favor and 27% against, and with voters who didn't know what Amendment 1 did, they supported it with 64% in favor and 28% against. Among North Carolina voters who were informed about the effects Amendment 1 banning same-sex marriage and civil unions and then asked how they would vote, only 38% continued to support it, 46% against it, and 16% were unsure. When combined those who do and don't know the effects of Amendment 1 it found that 55% would vote for it, 41% would vote against, and 4% were unsure. It also found that 55% of North Carolina voters support legal recognition of same-sex couples with 27% supporting same-sex marriage, 28% supporting civil unions, 41% oppose any legal recognition of same-sex couples, and 4% were unsure. When asked what the effects of Amendment 1 would be, 40% of voters thought that Amendment 1 banned same-sex marriage and civil unions, 27% thought it banned same-sex marriage only, 26% were unsure, and 7% thought it legalized same-sex marriage.

The decision affirmed the February 13 ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen in Bostic v. Schaefer, in which same-sex couples sought the freedom to marry and respect for their marriages legally performed in other states. On October 6, the United States Supreme Court denied review of this case, meaning that same- sex couples would have the freedom to marry in Virginia. Since the 4th Circuit also covers Maryland, West Virginia, North and South Carolina, the decision by the Supreme Court to refuse review meant the 4th Circuit decision stood as case law in the other states. With the exception of Maryland, where same-sex marriage was already legal, court cases were promptly filed to strike down various state laws and amendments. Shortly after 5 p.m. on October 10, 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Max O. Cogburn, Jr. in Asheville issued a ruling in the case of General Synod of the United Church of Christ, et al. v. Drew Reisinger, Register of Deeds of Buncombe County, declaring the amendment unconstitutional, and also declaring unconstitutional \\"and any other source of state law that operates to deny same-sex couples the right to marry in the State of North Carolina or prohibits recognition of same-sex marriages lawfully solemnized in other States, Territories, or a District of the United States, or threatens clergy or other officiants who solemnize the union of same-sex couples with civil or criminal penalties\\".http://www.news- record.com/news/amendment-one-struck- down/article_40763ce2-5099-11e4-84c9-001a4bcf6878.htmlMemorandum of Decision and Order from U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality NC, an LGBT rights advocacy organization in North Carolina, said \\"Today's ruling allowing loving, same-sex couples to marry across North Carolina is a historic moment for our state\\", and said that \\"With it, we celebrate with so many North Carolinians who have worked tirelessly over decades to change hearts, minds, and unequal laws in the state we call home.

Born in Abingdon, Virginia, Betsy was the daughter of Dr. Frank and Ava Clark of Abingdon, Virginia, and was the youngest of seven children, hence her family nickname, Bitsy. Her father established a Presbyterian mission school in Grundy, Virginia, where Betsy was born, and the importance of education was imbued in the family. Her childhood on the family farm and her love of nature led to her lifelong passion for science. Clark graduated from Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia. Her Ph.D. (1958) in developmental biology is from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. She was a postdoctoral fellow at Washington University in St. Louis and at the University of California, Berkeley. Clark taught at Columbia University from 1960 to 1969 as the first woman appointed to the biology faculty. A desire to try a different career in management while remaining close to science then brought her to the National Science Foundation. In her roles at NSF, she helped shape national science policy serving in positions of increasing responsibility, until her resignation as Assistant Director of Biological, Behavioral and Social Sciences in 1982. Subsequent to her years at NSF, Clark was provost and vice president for academic affairs at Bowling Green State University, positions which she held until 1996.

Early life and education Nardicio was born on August 8, 1966, into a working-class Italian American family. His uncle is Danny Nardico, the only boxer to beat Jake LaMotta.Jake LaMotta vs. Danny Nardico At 17, Nardicio bounced around as an actor between San Francisco and Berlin before settling in New York City with his friend, cabaret singer Justin Vivian Bond. In 1990, Nardicio moved to Berlin where he worked as an opera singer and principal actor in such venues as the Bregenzer Festspiele and Theater des Westens. In 1995, he moved back to New York City to become an actor, only changing his mind after temping for a year and realizing: \\"As an actor you have no control over your career. I had to have more control over my life, so I went into nightlife.\\" Career = Nightlife promoter and Dlist = In 2002, Nardicio opened the now notorious Slide Bar on the Bowery, making it into one of NYC's top ten gay destinations (according to The Village Voices \\"Best Of\\" Issue, 2004). At this time, he worked on various social media sites, including originating what would eventually become Dlist.com (from \\"Daniel's List\\", his original promotional email list), which at its peak was ranked the 6000th most popular site on the web. Nardicio created a weekly podcast called Dlist Radio that now has approximately 40,000 downloads on iTunes. In 2005, the podcast was voted as \\"Best Party Posing as An Internet Radio Show\\" by The Village Voices \\"Best Of\\" issue in 2008, and was tied with Kathy Griffin's Dlist TV show downloads for listeners. Nearly a decade of substantial media work (including radio, Dlist.com, online TV, social networking, and parties) has led to Nardicio being best known as one of New York City's most well-known party promoters and nightlife fixtures. He is personally responsible for producing nearly 1000 events, including The Saint at Large, Peaches, Sandra Bernhard in Concert, and his longtime collaboration of events with punk singer Nina Hagen. Noize Magazine said about his events: \\"You haven‚Äôt done New York Nightlife until you‚Äôve done Nardicio\\". He has thrown some of NYC's most talked about and scandalous events, such as his Night at The Playgirl Mansion parties and his notorious Tigerbeat the Slide. The nature of these parties has earned him the monikers \\"The Gay Hugh Hefner\\" by gay media source Next Magazine, and \\"Sleaze Impresario\\" by New York Magazine. He is credited with introducing international comic sensation Pam Ann to the United States. His Road Trip reality show pilot with Bianca Del Rio was an internet sensation in 2005 but was passed on by Logo TV as they \\"weren't interested in drag.\\" In the summer of 2012, he began his \\"Icon Series\\" with Liza Minnelli, who performed with actor and singer Alan Cumming on Fire Island, in the first ever pairing of the two Tony Award winners and stars of Cabaret. Since then, he has paired Carol Channing with cabaret singer Justin Vivian Bond and has extensively produced in New York City with such personalities as Joan Collins, John Waters, Chita Rivera, Margaret Cho, Peaches, Bridget Everett, Pam Ann, Christine Ebersole, Dina Martina and the New York Boylesque Festival. In February 2016, Nardicio brought Tony winner Alan Cumming to Carnegie Hall in \\"Alan Cumming Sings Sappy Songs With Friends.\\" He followed this performance by bringing Chita Rivera's Carnegie Hall debut Nowadays to the stage in November of 2017. =Europride= Nardicio was the first American to produce official Europride events at Europride Warsaw in 2010. He brought over transsexual singer Amanda Lepore, Lady Bunny, and Whitney Biennial artist Julie Atlas Muz, and a party with Boy George DJing. The events were disastrous. Nardicio was quoted as saying, \\"The homophobia in Poland was palpable - it was absolute chaos\\". 15 years ago, Nardicio started a Friday night party at Cherry Grove's Ice Palace, which is now Fire Island's longest-running weekly event to date. Fleshbot.com called it \\"the greatest weekly event in the world\\".

Tanawha, the Cherokee word for fabulous hawk or eagle is an appropriate name for this trail that offers hikers views of distant mountains. Completed in 1993, the Tanawha Trail, like the final section of the Parkway it mirrors, is unique in construction. The trail traverses a fragile and ancient ecosystem and leads hikers through a surprising range of biological and geological terrains. Some sections tunnel through thickets of laurel and rhododendron. Others dip down into remote hardwood coves and then ascend into evergreen glens. Boulder fields and cascading streams punctuate the landscape. Sections above the Linn Cove Viaduct and along Rough Ridge are strenuous, but overall the trail is an easy to moderate walk. The many accesses from the Parkway let hikers choose as long a section as they like. To preserve this delicate area, hikers are encouraged to stay on designated paths, bridges, and boardwalks. Most of the Tanawha Trail is also incorporated as a part of North Carolina's Mountains-to-Sea Trail (MST), which transverses the state from the Great Smoky Mountains to the Outer Banks. History The Tanawha Trail was completed in 1993, and was explicitly designed to be hiked. Navigation Throughout its length, the Tanawha Trail is blazed with a hawk feather printed on small, metal signs. Most of these signs also display the Mountains-to-Sea Trail's white dot, where the two trails are combined. Junctions with side and connecting trails are signed; however, the other trails might not be blazed. Camping Camping is not permitted on the Tanawha Trail; however, many backpacking opportunities do exist. The north-eastern trail-head is within Price Park's campground, which is open from May to October. The south-western trail-head is close to the Pisgah National Forest, which allows dispersed camping along the MST. The Tanawha Trail also provides the principle access to Grandfather Mountain State Park's eastern trails, which have designated, primitive campsites. Route The south-western trail-head is at the parkway's Beacon Heights Overlook. Shortly past the overlook, the MST joins with the Tanawha Trail, after it ascended Beacon Heights from the Pisgah National Forest. From there, the combined trails follow wooded lands alongside the Blue Ridge Parkway to the Linn Cove Visitor Center. The Tanawha Trail as it passes underneath the Linn Cove Viaduct. From the visitor center, the Tanawha Trail passes underneath the Linn Cove Viaduct and ascends steeply up stone steps past an enormous boulder wall. The trail levels off and enters a shady glen thick with birch and beech trees. Beyond the cascading water of Wilson Creek, the trail crosses a clearing filled with huge rock formations. The trail here, accented with flat rocks, is like a flagstone path. The trail then climbs sharply to Rough Ridge and over a long boardwalk. Here the view into the Piedmont is unobstructed because of the unusual low-growing and fragile mountain-heather ecosystems. It also offers an outstanding glimpse of the Linn Cove Viaduct and several mountains, Grandmother Mountain, Hawksbill and Table Rock. The trail continues on through a stately spruce and hemlock forest into a wooded glen reminiscent of New England. Its rocky landscape is filled with poplars, yellow birch, and oak. Past Raven Rock, the trail tunnels through mountain laurel and rhododendron. This sheltered section then gives way to a more open area with a rock garden where large ferns cascade out of immense boulders. More thickets of rhododendron lead to the junction of the Daniel Boone Scout Trail, one of Grandfather Mountain State Park's many trails. Not much further away, is the junction with Nuwati Trail, another state park trail. Hiking or camping on Grandfather Mountain requires a permit. The Tanawha Trail passes several small cascades and crosses Boone Fork Creek. Around the creek are junctions with the Asutsi Trail and the Upper Boone Fork Trail. Also, a self-registration, permit box for Grandfather Mountain is located near the Asutsi Trail junction. The trail winds in and out of rhododendron and laurel thickets, joins with an old logging road, and passes through a hardwood forest. In the last section leading to Price Park, the trail breaks out of the woods into open fields. Here, it parallels and crosses Holloway Mountain Road, passes apple orchards, an old grave site, and pasture land, which in spring, is blanketed with numerous wild-flowers. Finally, the trail briefly joins the Boone Fork Trail and departs with the MST, before ending with a short walk into Price Park's campground.

The group has been producing shows in France and around the world since 1999, including elements of circus, theater, visual arts and even mathematics. It is under the direction of Denis Paumier, and focused on the experimentation with objects and new techniques of manipulating them. Juggling rapidly rose in popularity in France at the end of the 1980s, with names such as the like Institut de Jonglage and J√©r√¥me Thomas creating innovations that would influence later jugglers. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Centre National des Arts du Cirque de Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne was an important operating center for jugglers with names such as Didier Andr√©, Thierry Andr√©, J√∂rg M√ºller, Mads Rosenbeck, Laurent Pareti as well as Denis Paumier. The company was founded in 1999 by Denis Paumier, Toon Schuermans and David Fischer. The three first met at the tenth congress of the Center National des Arts du Cirque. The first show the trio produced was called Impers et Passes, which mixed juggling, theater, movement, music and humor. Since then, the group has remained under the direction of Denis Paumier but with new members. Les Objets Volants continues to participate actively in international juggling events as this allows the troupe to have contacts with other artists from around the world and to incorporate ideas from these events into their own work. In 2001, Les Objets Volants performed at the Dans la Jongle des Villes Festival. Since 2006, the group has collaborated with the Circo Aereo from Finland to create and perform a show called \\"Espresso\\". Espresso is a show featuring four artists who create scenes and stories, on the ground and in the air, with juggling, dance and aerials, but no words. The show is a fast-paced history of the circus. Circo Aereo director Maksim Komaro states that it follows his own circus experience, from the traditional to cabaret and the contemporary circus of Europe and elements of each are found in the show. Espresso is one of Circo Aereo's biggest successes. Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat called the work \\"a treasure chest filled with beautiful sights, meticulous efforts and inventive surprises\\", while France's Le Monde said, \\"intelligence and virtuosity are embedded in the magical vignettes\\". The show toured extensively for three years, with the venues during the first year mainly being the Parc de la Villette in Paris, the Th√©√¢tre de Vidy-Lausanne in Switzerland and the Damascus Opera House, Syria. In 2009, Circo Aereo toured the United States for four weeks, performing the show Espresso in theaters in mostly eastern states. This tour was considered important to opening up the North American circus market to less-traditional shows. In 2011, the show was presented at Wabash College, Brigham Young University and at the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Guanajuato, Mexico.

French service On 2 April 1771, Commander Chabert was given command of Mignonne, and conducted a cruise to test a chronometer made by Ferdinand Berthoud. Upon his return, in late November, Chabert was promoted to Captain. In 1772 Mignonne came under the command of Suffren, who had just been promoted to the rank of captain. He commanded her and later Alcemene in the squadron that the French government had established for the purpose of training its officers. In 1793 the French Navy had Mignonne razeed, converting her to a corvette. On 22 October 1793 Mignonne was part of a five-vessel squadron under the command of Jean-Baptiste Perr√©e. In addition to Mignonne, the squadron included the frigates , Minerve, and Fortun√©e, and the brig Hasard. They encountered the 64-gun third rate , under the command of Captain Horatio Nelson.

O'Hara played with the brand names of our things, and Donald Barthelme plays with the brand names of our ideas.

In The New York Times Book Review, critic John Romano called Barthelme a \\"comic genius,\\" adding, \\"The will to please us, to make us sit up and laugh with surprise, is greater than the will to disconcert. The chief thing to say about Barthelme, beyond praise for his skill, which seems to me supererogatory, is that he is fiercely committed to showing us a good time, at least in the vast proportion of his work. The spirit is: Many things are silly, especially about modern language, and there is much sadness everywhere, but all is roughly well.

Description The geology of the 578 km2 site is dominated by granite and metamorphic rocks, forming a rugged mountainous landscape covered by tropical rainforest and patches of wet sclerophyll forest. Most of it lies over 800 m above sea level. Much of the site has been selectively logged, though the ecological integrity of the area is still largely intact. It supports almost all the high altitude rainforest bird species endemic to Australia's wet tropics, and could serve as an important climate change refuge.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Paluma. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 14/09/2011. Birds The site has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it is a southern outlier for many species and contains a significant population of the vulnerable southern cassowary. It also supports populations of bush stone-curlews, tooth-billed and golden bowerbirds, lovely fairywrens, Macleay's, white-gaped, yellow, bridled and yellow-spotted honeyeaters, fernwrens, mountain thornbills, chowchillas, Bower's shrike-thrushes, pied monarchs, white-browed and pale- yellow robins, and Victoria's riflebirds. Other animals As with birds the IBA forms the southernmost extent of distribution for many other endemic animals, including the green ringtail possum, the limbless snake-tooth skink, Boyd's forest dragon, the four-fingered shade skink, and the endangered waterfall frog.

The book has sold over three million copies. Narrative In Born to Run, McDougall tracks down members of the reclusive Tarahumara Native Mexican tribe in the Mexican Copper Canyons. After being repeatedly injured as a runner himself, McDougall marvels at the tribe's ability to run ultra distances (over 100 miles) at incredible speeds, without getting the routine injuries of most American runners. The book has received attention in the sporting world for McDougall's description of how he overcame injuries by modeling his running after the Tarahumara.Parker-Pope, Tara. \\"The Human Body is Built for Distance.\\" Well, The New York Times, October 26, 2009. He asserts that modern cushioned running shoes are a major cause of running injury, pointing to the thin sandals worn by Tarahumara runners, and the explosion of running-related injuries since the introduction of modern running shoes in 1972. Alongside his research into the Tarahumara, McDougall delves into why the human species, unique among primates, has developed traits for endurance running. He promotes the endurance running hypothesis, arguing that humans left the forests and moved to the savannas by developing the ability to run long distances in order to literally run down prey.

Education Born in Barcelona on April 13, 1910, Sard√† obtained his secondary education diploma from the Instituto General y T√©cnico de Barcelona in 1927 and then went on to study Law at the University of Barcelona. While he was studying law, he developed a great interest for economics, leading him to become a regular contributor on economic subjects for the newspaper L'Opini√≥, and eventually to become part of the editing team of the magazine Economia i Finances(Economics and Finance). Upon graduating in 1932, he obtained a Ph.D. in Law from the Complutense University of Madrid, where he was tutored by Adolfo Gonz√°lez Posada, a very influential academic of the time. He complemented his formation on economics at the London School of Economics and the University of Munich, and then returned to Spain in 1934. Academic career and public service Shortly after returning to Spain, Sard√† began his academic career as an assistant professor of at the Faculty of Law and Social and Economic Sciences of University of Barcelona until the end of the civil war. Many of the professors he worked with during those years had positively influenced him to shift his career towards economics and expanded the curriculum of the faculty to include more economics-related subject. It was also during that time that he began his career as a public servant when he was named advisor to the Comissaria de Banca, Borsa i Estalvi(Banking, Savings and Stock Exchange Commissioner) in Barcelona. After the war ended, he stopped teaching for a few years. He was named president of the Association of Banks of Northeastern Spain and began contributing regularly to the publication Espa√±a Bancaria. After several failed attempts to return to academic work, he was finally given a position at the University of Compostela teaching Economic Policy and Public Finances. However, this would only last for a year, and in 1951 he was forced to move to Venezuela where he resumed his academic career at the Central University until 1956, while providing consultancy work for local banks. When he returned to Spain he was a key contributor to the National Stabilization Plan of Alberto Ullastres Calvo y de Mariano Navarro Rubio that brought about the Spanish Miracle. The main components of the plan called for balancing the national budget, the liberalization of the labor market and international trade and a monetary policy aimed at controlling inflation. During this period of time, the Spanish economy boomed, taking it to levels close to those of Central Europe. As Sard√†'s reputation grew, he helped found the faculty of Economics at the University of Barcelona and he was appointed director of the delegations of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Spain. In the years that followed he wrote several articles and books focusing mainly on monetary policy. He also founded the Monthly Statistical Report of the Bank of Spain and worked with the central bank research and statistics unit. By the time the Spanish boom had worn off in the early 1970s, Joan Sard√† had already become one of the most influential Spanish economists of the twentieth century.

The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 21, 1974. Description and history The Hammond Covered Bridge is located north of the Pittsford Village center, just north of Kendall Hill Road, a secondary street providing access from United States Route 7 to points on the west side of Otter Creek. The bridge spans the creek in an east-west orientation. It is a single-span Town lattice structure, with trusses in length, and a roadway width of . The eastern abutment is built of stone and marble slabs, and is now topped by a concrete pad, while the western abutment is marble topped by concrete. The bridge has been reinforced with laminated beams mounted below the trusses. The exterior is finished in vertical board siding, which extends around to the portal faces and a short way inside. There are square openings providing light to the interior of the structure, which is capped by a corrugated metal roof. The bridge was built in 1842 by Asa Nourse. In 1927, a flood swept the bridge downstream but left the structure intact. Since it was still functional, the bridge was placed on barrels and transported back to its original location; it is now called \\"the bridge that went on a voyage\\". The bridge was later bypassed by a steel and concrete bridge on Kendall Hill Road and is closed to vehicle traffic. It was acquired by the state in 1961, which is responsible for its maintenance.

In 1409, during the 20-year Hungarian civil war between King Sigismund and the Neapolitan house of Anjou, the losing contender, Ladislaus of Naples, sold his \\"rights\\" on Dalmatia to the Venetian Republic for a meager sum of 100,000 ducats. As Sigismund emerged as the ruler of Hungary, he used this as a pretext to attack Venice. The victory allowed Venice to affirm its rule in the Western Balkans (Venetian Dalmatia and Venetian Albania) against the plans of Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Germany, Hungary and Croatia. Prelude The Republic of Venice subjugated Verona and Vicenza after the death of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, and took control of Padova by having its count, Francesco Carrara, executed in Venice. This, and the Republics refusal to pay the annual fee of 7,000 ducats to the Crown of Hungary drove Sigismund, king of Hungary to declare war upon Venice. On April 20, 1411, 12,000 Hungarian cavalry and 8,000 foot crossed the Tagliamento under Pipo of Ozora. The initial Hungarian success and the heavy losses that the Venetians sustained forced the Republic into a peace negotiation (March 24, 1412) in which King Sigismund demanded the city of Zadar, reinstatement of the Scaliger and Carraresi to their fiefdoms and a reparation of 600,000 ducats. This proposition was not accepted by the Republic of Venice and the war was resumed by both sides with great passion. Battle The Venetians increased their army and at the head of 35,000 men, Carlo Malatesta reentered the field in Friuli conquering the castles of Polcenigo and Aviano. Pandolfo Malatesta, brother of Carlo, joined the Venetian force with 1,000 lances and by late August, the Venetians had an army of 12,000 men assembled along the Livenza river, with Carlo Malatesta laying siege to Motta. On April 24, 3,000 Hungarians (including Germans, Friulians and Bohemians) under Pippo Spano assaulted the Venetian camp from three sides. The Venetian camp was taken by surprise and the Hungarians created a slaughter and started to plunder what they could. Only Carlo Malatesta and the otherVenetian generals together with Ruggero Cane Ranieri and his company of 600 horse held off the Hungarians. The Venetian fortunes completely changed when Pietro Loredan burned down the bridges so that the fleeing Venetian troops could not escape, and thus rallied them back into combat. In the fierce encounter the Hungarians were driven off, with the loss of over 1,300 men and their general killed, several standards and 400 men captured. The Venetians won a hard fought victory, having lost a lot of men killed. Aftermath After being severely wounded, Carlo Malatesta, was forced to surrender his command over the Venetian troops to his brother Pandolfo. Motta was forced to surrender after Pietro Loredan and Martino da Faenza bombarded it, killing 60 and capturing 200 Hungarians. In October, King Sigismund arrived in person with a force of 40,000 men, but continued the war with little success. After the failed siege of Vicenza, which decimated the Hungarian force, a truce for five years with exchange of prisoners was finally concluded on April 17, 1413.

Retrieved 29 September 2011 Known in the 1960s as the \\"Queen Bee of Show Business\\", she is best remembered for her management of singers Adam Faith and Sandie Shaw. Taylor's management of Adam Faith commenced following Faith's introduction to her by John Barry. Taylor immediately changed Faith's image and appearance, and initially believed that Faith should concentrate on acting, rather than singing. When she appreciated that his records were becoming popular, Taylor enhanced popular interest by intimating that Faith would be issuing no more recordings, in favour of concentrating on his acting career. Taylor's initial relationship with John Barry was used to the benefit of Faith. With the encouragement of Eve Taylor, Adam Faith's successful early records were compositions by John Barry and lyricist Johnny Worth. When Faith began to perform regularly onstage, backed by John Barry's group, The John Barry Seven, he also heeded Eve Taylor's advice that he make separate, solo appearances, so that his musical career was not perceived to be tied to that of Barry. In 1961, at the age of twenty-one, Adam Faith signed a ten-year management contract with Eve Taylor, renegotiating previous contracts that had been signed by his parents. The term of the contract was at Taylor's suggestion; Faith had originally wanted a longer contract. Adam Faith discovered singer Sandie Shaw in 1964 when, at the age of sixteen, Shaw performed with Faith at a charity concert. Faith then introduced Shaw to his manager, Eve Taylor.Tim Auld, Interview with 1960s icon Sandie Shaw. The Daily Telegraph, 13 September 2010. Retrieved 20 September 2011. Within two weeks, Taylor had obtained a contract for Shaw with Pye Records, and had also made an agreement with songwriter Chris Andrews to write for Shaw.Biography of Sandie Shaw, British Music Experience, Retrieved 22 September 2011. Sandie Shaw's singles were produced by Eve Taylor, Chris Andrews and Sandie Shaw (uncredited), with help from Pye Records arranger Ken Woodman. It was Taylor who persuaded Shaw to enter the Eurovision Song Contest, where she won for Great Britain in 1967, with the song \\"Puppet on a String\\". Taylor also disclosed to Shaw that, despite Taylor being the manager of both Sandie Shaw and Adam Faith, Adam Faith had been taking a percentage of most of Shaw's earnings and had an interest in most of the publishing rights to her songs. Taylor was also responsible for rejecting \\"It's Not Unusual\\" to be sung by Sandie Shaw, which instead became the first international hit for Tom Jones. The song was written for Sandie Shaw by Les Reed and Gordon Mills, and was rejected by Eve Taylor, based on hearing the demo version, as sung by Tom Jones. Jon Kutner, Spencer Leigh, 1,000 UK Number One Hits, Omnibus Press, 2010 Both Shaw and Faith eventually ended their professional relationships with Taylor acrimoniously, and both criticised Taylor openly in TV interviews and in their respective biographies. In the 1997 UK Channel 4 series BritGirls, during the episode focussing on Shaw, Faith described Taylor as \\"emotionally violent\\" and said she would threaten to end her client's careers if they did not accept her demands. Shaw does concede in her autobiography, The World at My Feet, that she was saddened when she learned of Taylor's death after many years without contact. Death Taylor died in 1983, and was buried in what Shaw described as \\"an uncelebrated plot in a Jewish cemetery in North London\\".

The group consists of MC Ride (vocals, lyrics), Zach Hill (drums, production), and Andy Morin (keyboards, production). Though he is not the band's frontman, Hill has been credited with being the driving creative force behind the project.https://twitter.com/andy__morin/status/908789368424296448 Their sound, paired with Ride's aggressive performing style, draws on punk rock, electronic, noise, and industrial styles. The band released the mixtape Exmilitary in April 2011 and their debut studio album, The Money Store, a year later; both received critical acclaim. Shortly after signing to Epic Records in 2012, the group leaked their second album, No Love Deep Web, for free download in breach of their contract and were dropped from the label. They released their third album, Government Plates, in 2013. Following several broken performance commitments, the group announced their \\"disbanding\\" in July 2014 along with the release of their fourth album The Powers That B. However, in March 2015, the group revealed that they \\"might make some more\\" music and later announced a world tour. Later in 2015, Death Grips announced their fifth official studio album, Bottomless Pit, which was released in May 2016. Their sixth studio album, Year of the Snitch, was released in June 2018. Their fourth EP, Gmail and the Restraining Orders, was released in June 2019 in celebration of Warp Records‚Äô 30th anniversary. History =2010‚Äì2011: Formation and Exmilitary= Death Grips were formed in Sacramento, California, on December 21, 2010. On the same day, they recorded their first song, \\"Full Moon (Death Classic)\\". It was released on March 8, 2011, with a video and a free self-titled EP which featured the song alongside five other songs. On April 25, 2011, Death Grips released a free mixtape entitled Exmilitary, containing three tracks from the EP along with new songs. Throughout the spring and early summer in 2011, they played small shows while Exmilitary was spreading steadily throughout the Internet and receiving favorable reviews from music critics. The band members were largely elusive during this time, with the only confirmed member being Hill. =2012: The Money Store and No Love Deep Web= Death Grips performing in right Death Grips signed with Epic Records in February 2012, under the recommendation of Epic's then-executive vice president of marketing, Angelica Cob-Baehler. They announced the release of two albums in 2012. Their first studio album, The Money Store, was released in April and debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at No. 130. Termed as \\"avant- rap\\", Pitchfork called The Money Store \\"confrontational, abrasive, and chaotic\\". The Los Angeles Times called it \\"punk rock with a hip-hop face- lift\\". October saw the release of No Love Deep Web. It was described as a darker album by NPR, saying that the group creates a \\"soundtrack to modern urban living\\" with lyrics that describe \\"constant paranoia\\". The album contains heavily edited vocal performances from Ride. Its cover art drew attention and controversy for consisting of a picture of Hill's erect penis with the album title written across it. The album was recorded within four months in Sacramento. Prior to that, an international tour was scheduled to support The Money Store, but was immediately cancelled in order to complete No Love Deep Web. This caused conflict between the group and their fans, as well as their label Epic Records. In particular, the album was self-released for legal download via BitTorrent as an effort to bypass their label's original intent to release the album in 2013. Death Grips was cut from their recording contract as a result, and would launch their new label Third Worlds in the following year from \\"a unique relationship with Harvest/Capitol‚Äù. Material would then be distributed by Caroline Records. The band remixed two Bj√∂rk songs from her album Biophilia, \\"Sacrifice\\" and \\"Thunderbolt\\", after receiving an artist-to-artist note of support. The re-workings were featured in her 2012 remix album Bastards. A non-album track titled \\"True Vulture Bare\\" was issued in October 2012 and was accompanied with an animated video by Galen Pehrson. This project was created for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. =2013‚Äì2015: Government Plates and The Powers That B= Death Grips performing in left In March 2013, the band released a series of videos to their YouTube account, collectively called No Hands. On March 20, 2013, a music video for \\"Lock Your Doors\\", which was recorded at a live show in SXSW, was released. Hill did not attend the show physically, but played the drums via Skype. Hill wrote and directed an original feature film in May, with the involvement of Death Grips in the soundtrack. During this period, Hill was also working on the group's album. Death Grips were scheduled to perform at Lollapalooza in August, but their performance was cancelled after the band failed to show up for an after-party show the previous night at the Bottom Lounge, instead putting on a playlist of pre-recorded tracks. Draped over the back of the stage was a huge printout of a fan's suicide note, written to the band in the form of an email. Fans at the show destroyed and stole pieces of the band's equipment after being informed of the cancellation. Their subsequent performance scheduled for Montreal's Osheaga Music and Arts Festival on the next day was cancelled, as well as performances in Boston and New York. The group however, never planned to actually appear at Lollapalooza; they later stated that the drum kit, suicide note, and pre-recorded music \\"was the show\\". The drum kit that was destroyed was revealed to be a children's learning kit and not Hill's actual kit. Government Plates (2013) was released for free download on their official website. An NME review called the record \\"a challenging listen\\" but dubbed the album along, with Slant Magazine, as \\"transgressive\\". The album ‚Äú[pushes] further away from typical hip-hop\\" and \\"[toys] with electronic dance music of various eras\\", according to The New York Times. In January 2014, Warp Music Publishing signed an exclusive worldwide publishing agreement with the group, covering previous and future releases. In June, Death Grips announced a double album titled The Powers That B, along with a download of the first disc, subtitled Niggas on the Moon. The second disc, Jenny Death, was announced to be released later in the year. Niggas on the Moon features chopped up samples of Bj√∂rk's vocals. The double album's first half received mixed to positive reviews. Pitchfork called it the group's least intense effort in their entire discography. A review by MusicOMH stated that it had less of Hill's percussion and claimed that Morin lacked direction in producing the album. Death Grips were scheduled as a supporting act to tour with Nine Inch Nails and Soundgarden in July but the group announced an abrupt disbandment, thus cancelling their appearances. An image of the following message, posted on their Facebook page, was written on a napkin: In January 2015, without any prior notification, Death Grips released a free instrumental album entitled Fashion Week. The song titles, each beginning with the word \\"Runway\\" followed by a letter of the alphabet, spelled out the phrase \\"JENNY DEATH WHEN\\" in reference to the then-unreleased second disc of The Powers That B. The album was released in its complete form in March and reached the Billboard 200 chart at No. 72. In the same year, Hill and Morin formed a side project called the I.L.Y's and issued their debut album I've Always Been Good at True Love through Death Grips' official website; it was initially released with little information about the project. =2015‚Äìpresent: Bottomless Pit and Year of the Snitch= In October 2015, the group uploaded a video to their YouTube page titled Bottomless Pit. It features footage from 2013 of American actress Karen Black reciting lines from a film script Hill wrote months before her death. They also posted on their website and Facebook that this would be the title for their fifth studio album. In March, the band published a 32-minute video to their YouTube page titled Interview 2016, which shares its name with their second EP; the video shows the band being interviewed by Matthew Hoffman of Tuesdays With Matthew, an online volunteer project that aims to combat loneliness in elderly people by recruiting them to act in recreations of famous movie scenes.http://www.matthewhoffman.tv/tuesdays-with-matthew-1 However, all of the interview's audio is replaced by the album's songs, while the EP's cover art consists solely of a picture of Hoffman looking into the camera. Death Grips uploaded their third EP, Steroids (Crouching Tiger Hidden Gabber Megamix), to their YouTube channel in May 2017; the EP consists of a single 22-minute song of the same name. Following this, the group co-headlined an autumn U.S. tour with industrial metal band Ministry. In March 2018, Death Grips posted images on social media outlining that they were \\"working on the new album\\" titled Year of the Snitch with Australian noise artist Lucas Abela, New Zealand film director Andrew Adamson, and American musician Justin Chancellor (best known as the bassist for Tool). In April, Death Grips uploaded a video to their YouTube channel writing the track listing for the new album with text messages. In May 2018, Death Grips uploaded the singles \\"Streaky\\", \\"Black Paint\\", and \\"Flies\\". In June, they uploaded a single titled \\"Hahaha\\", as well as an accompanying tweet announcing the release date for Year of the Snitch as June 22. A week later, the band released another two singles: \\"Dilemma\\", featuring Andrew Adamson, and \\"Shitshow\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhVN6gRD5XM On June 21, Year of the Snitch was systematically made available on streaming services after the time reached midnight on June 22 in New Zealand, subsequently leading to listeners spreading differing versions of the album hours before its full scheduled rollout. The band also tweeted the album being \\"leaked\\". The following day, Year of the Snitch was officially released. On June 21, 2019, Death Grips released a 30-minute mix titled Gmail and the Restraining Orders as part of Warp Records' 30th anniversary celebrations. Style Ride (left) and Hill (right) performing in August 2011 Death Grips' music combines a variety of styles including hip hop, punk, electronic, noise, and industrial. Their style has been categorized as experimental hip hop, rap rock, electropunk, industrial hip hop, and punk-rap. The group is known for Ride's aggressive rapping style and bleak and cryptic lyrics, alongside their noisy and often chaotic production. They have also received attention for their wild physical performances and stage presence. Their live performances are notable for antics such as the destruction of instruments, their complete absence at one of their scheduled shows, Hill drumming to the point of severe injury or performing in handcuffs, Ride's intense and chaotic stage persona, and Morin's use of live sampling alongside his improvised synthesizer flourishes and violent dancing. They are also notable for engaging in extended periods of live musical improvisation interwoven into their set as bridges between songs, typically performed on the fly by Morin and Hill. Ride has been known to adopt many different vocal styles on record and during live performances, such as shouting, screaming, spoken word-style talking, and even whispering. Morin's unorthodox style of production and sampling and Hill's noisy, fast, and unconventional drumming styles and patterns are also distinct features of Death Grips' sound. The band is also notable for their distinctive and lo-fi visual style made clear in their music videos, performances, and releases. In popular culture Bj√∂rk is one of the most notable fans of the band. They remixed two tracks for Bastards, a collection of remixes from her album Biophilia. Bj√∂rk allegedly recorded original vocal samples for the band, which they used on every track of Niggas on the Moon. Actor Robert Pattinson is another notable fan, friend and collaborator of the band; he played guitar on the song \\"Birds\\" from Government Plates, which was achieved by Hill recording Pattinson's playing on his phone in a jam session and later sampling the part into the song itself. Pattinson also appeared in a 2013 photo with the band and Beyonc√© backstage at the latter's concert, which received viral attention due to its unlikely combination of people.https://www.wmagazine.com/story/robert-pattinson-beyonce-death-grips- photo/ Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno cited them as an influence on the band's album 48:13. According to David Bowie collaborator Donny McCaslin, Bowie was inspired by Death Grips whilst creating his final album Blackstar.

The song \\"I've Seen Footage\\" was used multiple times in the 2019 comedy film Booksmart. Their songs have also been used on commercials and TV shows as varied as Animals, Atlanta, BoJack Horseman, Top Boy, Westworld and Waterloo Road. The song \\"No Love\\" was used in BoJack Horseman during the title character's drug trips and the show included visual references to the band, such as stickers on dumpsters bearing their lyrics in the background of shots, during its final season. It was also used in a Burberry summer 2020 campaign, featuring Kendall Jenner. The song \\"You Might Think He Loves You for Your Money but I Know What He Really Loves You for It's Your Brand New Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat\\" was used on an Adidas Predator advertisement. The song \\"Hot Head\\" was used on the season 2 teaser trailer for Animals, as well as in the season 2 premiere of Atlanta, in which the song is being played in a car by the character of aforementioned actor Lakeith Stanfield. The instrumental for \\"Inanimate Sensation\\" was used in the season 3 finale of Top Boy.

The group tries to bring attention and justice to all marginalized and underprivileged areas of society. They offer services to women and girls throughout the country, and focus on restructuring gender relations with the aim of creating a more humane, equitable and gender-just society.  Empowerment of women  In 1997, CSR founded the Gender Training Institute (GTI) to facilitate the empowerment of women and social justice through capacity building and training-related activities. GTI's trainings investigate gendered interactions happening in other areas of life like media, economy, politics and culture. Leadership skills and the ability to address gender issues in their lives and that of society will be passed on to participants. With the support of the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF), GTI also founded a program \\"Enhancing the Role of Women in Strengthening Democracy\\", where 1000 women leaders were geared up to run for and serve in state and national political offices. Crisis Intervention Centres (CICs) are also managed under the understanding that fighting gender-based violence involves direct assistance as well as sensitization and mobilization of grassroots communities. GTI has also implemented a project on \\"Promotion of Women's Rights through Networking, Lobbying, Advocacy and Capacity Building\\". The 3rd phase of the project was successfully completed with as much success on initiating the 4th phase of the project which incorporated Men and boys in the process. Another initiative of GTI was to commence the first one of its kind online course launched on \\"Training women in leadership and Democracy\\". CSR further launched a certificate programme, India-Women in Leadership (iWIL), in collaboration with Centre for Public Policy that includes lectures, field visits and travels.  Eliminating sex selection  Eliminating Female infanticide in long term will resolve the biasness towards sex selection. CSR implemented the Meri Shakti, Meri Beti (My Daughter, My Strength) project in 2007 to reduce pre-natal sex selection. It has organized over 40 Community Outreach Programs, nine Community Watch Group meetings, two Expert Group meetings and one Interface Workshop in the Kurukshetra district of Haryana state. A second phase of the campaign was launched in 2013. The second workshop for the Meri Shakti, Meri Beti project was initiated by Manasi Mishra who emphasized issues regarding the social and economic implications of pre-natal sex selection. Results indicated 100 students had signed the petition and pledged to support the prevention of female foeticide in their communities. In addition, a continuous effort is made by reaching out to the public, creating awareness through campaigns and workshops to increase the sex ratio. These will also serve as educating materials to the local communities in encouraging their taking a stand against sex selection.  Women's education  One of the projects under CSR is to provide free education to underprivileged children specifically targeted at girls. CSR operates several schools such as a primary school Parivartan Praveshika in Etawah that aims to provide primary school education for girls who have never attended school or had early drop-outs. Furthermore, CSR has an adult literacy program that functions as a non-formal education and also counseling regarding violence against women. With such project initiatives, CSR managed to provide education for over 2500 adolescent girls and more than 9000 women in the year 2003.

There are many \\"Red Lists\\" that have been developed specifically for building materials. These lists have primarily been developed by green building rating system developers and architecture firms. They are typically developed from chemical hazard lists published by government agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), European Union Commission on Environment (European Commissioner for the Environment),http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/reach_intro.htm and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control.https://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/GreenChemistryInitiative/index.cfm Living Building Challenge Red List The International Living Future Institute (ILFI) has developed the following red list of chemicals that may not be included in materials used in construction that seeks to meet the criteria of the Living Building Challenge (LBC). According to ILFI, the list is composed of materials that should be phased out of production due to health concerns. The list is updated as new science emerges. The most recent update came in May 2014. The LBC red list is shown directly below. This list includes both chemicals and chemical groups. In 2014, ILFI published a spreadsheet that represents the full list of chemicals, as this spreadsheet expands these chemical groups into the individual chemicals of which they are composed. As of May 2014, this spreadsheet contained 815 individual chemicals. * Alkylphenols * Asbestos * Bisphenol A * Cadmium * Chlorinated polyethylene and chlorosulfonated polyethlene (CSPE); HDPE and LDPE are excluded from the Red List. * Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) * Chlorobenzenes * Chloroprene (neoprene) * Chromium VI * Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride * Formaldehyde (added) * halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) * Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) * Lead (added) * Mercury * Polychlorinated biphenyls * Perfluorinated compound * Phthalates * Polyvinyl chloride * Polyvinylidene chloride * Short Chain Chlorinated paraffins * Wood treatments containing creosote, arsenic or pentachlorophenol *Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in wet applied products In addition to this red list, LBC criteria mandate that petrochemical fertilizers and pesticides cannot be used during the certification period or be used in operations and maintenance. The Red List and the Living Building Challenge The Living Building Challenge includes seven performance categories, titled as petals. The red list falls under the materials petal. A building project may not contain any of the Red List chemicals or chemical groups. There is an exception for small components in complex products. Each of these exceptions must include a written explanation. These exceptions will only be approved with a copy of the letter sent to the manufacturer stating that the product purchase does not ensure an endorsement. In addition, the final documentation must include a statement that asks the manufacturer to stop using the red list material or chemical. There are also temporary red list exceptions for numerous red list items for which viable alternatives are not yet commercially available. Declare Product Label Declare is a product labeling program that relies on the LBC Red List as its primary basis for material evaluation. In creating a Declare label for a product, a manufacturer must disclose all of that product's intentionally added constituent chemicals to the designated 100 parts per million (ppm) reporting threshold. Additionally, the manufacturer must report the extent to which that product is compliant with the Red List. The three compliance levels are: (1) LBC Red List free, which means that the product is free of all red list ingredients; (2) LBC compliant, which means that the product contains some chemicals that ILFI has designated as temporary red list exceptions; or (3) declared, which means that the product is not compliant with the Red List or its temporary exceptions. Products with Declare labels are included in the ILFI's Declare Product Database. A project compliant with the Living Building Challenge must include at least one Declare product for every 500 m2 (5382 ft2) of gross building area and must send Declare program information to at least 10 manufacturers not yet using Declare. Other Building Industry Red Lists Several other entities in the building industry have developed chemical red lists that operate in a similar manner to the LBC Red List. Three of them are described below. =Cradle to Cradle Banned Chemicals List= The Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute (C2CPII) is a non-profit group that develops and administers the Cradle-to-Cradle Certified Product Standard. This multi-attribute standard evaluates a product's performance in five impact categories: material health, material reutilization, renewable energy and carbon management, water stewardship, and social fairness. In this product standard, the material health evaluation criteria include compliance with a banned chemical list for bronze level certification. Certified products may not contain listed chemicals as intentionally added ingredients above 1000 ppm. According to C2CPII, chemicals are selected for inclusion on the list due to their tendency to accumulate in the biosphere and lead to irreversible negative human health effects. Additionally, several substances were selected due to the hazards associated with their manufacture, use, and disposal. =Perkins and Will Transparency List= The Perkins and Will Transparency List includes substances commonly found in the built environment that regulatory entities have classified as being harmful to human and/or environmental health. Because these regulatory designations are constantly evolving, the list is updated as new information is published. The tool is fundamentally grounded in the concept of the Precautionary Principle. =LEED Pilot Credit 11: Chemical Avoidance in Building Materials= In 2011, the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) piloted a credit for its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system that intended to reduce the quantity of indoor contaminants that are harmful to the comfort and well-being of installers and occupants. This pilot credit, which was not included in LEED Version 4, required that specific interior building materials and products not contain listed chemicals for all applicable materials. The list includes halogenated flame retardants and phthalates.

Also known by his nom de guerre Jastreb (\\"Hawk\\"), Dedakoviƒá is best known for commanding the 204th Vukovar Brigade and the city of Vukovar's defenses during the 1991 Battle of Vukovar in the early stages of the Croatian War of Independence. Biography Originally from the village of Nijemci in Syrmia in eastern Croatia, Dedakoviƒá had graduated from the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) Air Force Academy and its Officer Academy before the events which led to the breakup of Yugoslavia began to unfold in 1990. Formerly a lieutenant colonel in command of a JNA military airbase near Zagreb, he joined the newly formed Croatian National Guard (ZNG) in the summer of 1991. Due to a lack of schooled officers available to the Croatian military at the time, Dedakoviƒá, an air force officer, was immediately posted to command the ZNG's brigade stationed in Vukovar, a town in eastern Croatia in his native region, which soon fell under a full-scale attack of the JNA and Serbian nationalist paramilitaries. He assumed command of the 204th Vukovar Brigade upon its formation in September 1991. At the time of its founding, the brigade roster included 1,803 men, and was assigned to cover the area of the former municipality of Vukovar, which included the cities of Vukovar and Ilok as well as numerous surrounding villages. Dedakoviƒá commanded the brigade during the first phase of the siege of Vukovar until early October when he was reassigned to nearby Vinkovci and the command passed on to Branko Borkoviƒá. In mid- October Dedakoviƒá was put in charge of a breakthrough operation to relieve the Vukovar which was in the meantime cut off from the rest of the Croatian-held territory. Although initially successful, the counter-offensive was called off by Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman, reportedly under pressure from the European Community for a ceasefire. This enabled the JNA to retake the ground that it had lost and from then on the town was completely surrounded until it eventually fell on 18 November 1991. Both Mile Dedakoviƒá and Branko Borkoviƒá survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the Croatian Government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police, and the Croatian government suppressed an issue of the newspaper Slobodni tjednik that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedakoviƒá had pleaded with an evasive Tuƒëman for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed. Dedakoviƒá was charged together with the leaders of the Croatian Party of Rights for an alleged preparation to attack Banski dvori, but the case was rejected at the Croatian Supreme Court. In 1996, he published a book Bitka za Vukovar (\\"Battle of Vukovar\\"), co-authored with Radio Vukovar journalist Alenka Mirkoviƒá Naƒë. In November 2005, Dedakoviƒá worked with the Ministry of Defence under Berislav Ronƒçeviƒá to consolidate official records of the 204th Brigade. On September 25, 2006, Dedakoviƒá ceremonially reported in Vukovar, under the brigade's now- official banners, before the Commander-in-Chief President of Croatia Stjepan Mesiƒá.

Teddy Lemke takes good care of the little Ulli ‚Äì as if he were his own son. When Ulli surprises Teddy with a children's clown costume, which he accidentally found in the attic, Teddy hesitantly tells the story of his life: Formerly he was a famous clown who performed together with his son. When the boy died, Teddy ended his career. Ulli persuades Teddy to return to the stage, and from then on they perform together. Their immediate success leads to an offer for a longer engagement. At this moment Ulli's mother Gerti, who is now married, returns from America to take Ulli back with her. Teddy flees with Ulli from Berlin to Switzerland, pursued by the child's mother, her husband, and several assistants. Finally Ulli moves with his parents to America, and Teddy, who reluctantly comes to terms with it, gives a sad solo performance at the end.

A Democrat, he represented the 37th District of the New York City Council, which includes portions of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, Bushwick, Crown Heights, Cypress Hills, and East New York in Brooklyn. On January 26, 2020 he resigned from the City Council in favor of a job with the Freelancers Union. Early life and education Espinal has lived in Brooklyn all his life, while his parents are from the Dominican Republic. He was born in 1984, and is the third of six children.https://www.rafaelespinal.nyc/meet-rafael He was raised in Cypress Hills, attending and graduating from New York City public schools, P.S. 108, I.S. 302, and Franklin K. Lane High School. Espinal attended Queens College and graduated with a bachelor's degree in English. Career Espinal first worked as an adult literacy teacher. Espinal entered public service as an aide to City Councilmember Erik Martin Dilan, ultimately serving as his Chief of Staff. In the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he was the only New York City Councilmember to endorse Bernie Sanders. He endorsed him again for the 2020 primaries, the first City Councilmember to do so. In 2017, Espinal was named one of Time Out New York's \\"New Yorkers of the Year\\", largely in recognition of his advocacy in repealing the New York City Cabaret Law, enforcement of which disproportionately targeted LGBTQ and ethnic minority venues and creating the city's Office of Nightlife, dedicated to supporting DIY art spaces, music venues, bars and restaurants. In 2019, Espinal ran in the special election for New York City Public Advocate, following Letitia James's victory in her race for New York State Attorney General. He came in 7th place in a crowded field of 17 candidates, won by fellow Brooklyn City Councilmember Jumaane Williams. Espinal, facing term limits to another term in the City Council, announced plans to run for Brooklyn Borough President in the 2021 election. The seat will be vacant as current Borough President, Eric Adams, faces term limits himself. He dropped out of the race in January 2020, and subsequently resigned from the Council entirely. =New York State Assembly= In his first campaign, Espinal won the open 54th district seat in the New York State Assembly in a special election held on September 13, 2011. The seat was left vacant after Darryl Towns resigned from the post in order to take a position with Governor Andrew Cuomo's administration. The assembly district represents parts of Bushwick, East New York, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Cypress Hills, and Cityline in Brooklyn. Espinal had endorsements from the Brooklyn Democratic Party, the Republican Party and the Conservative Party of New York State. In a tight race, Espinal (46%) defeated Jesus Gonzalez (35%) running on the Working Families Party line and Deidra Towns (19%) running on her party platform, \\"Community First\\". In 2012, Espinal was named one of City & State's \\"New York City Rising Stars: 40 Under 40\\" for his work as New York State Assemblyman. =New York City Council= In 2013, Espinal opted to leave the state Assembly to run for the New York City Council to succeed Erik Martin Dilan, and won the primary and general to take the seat in 2014. In 2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio announced an affordable housing plan that would create over 3,000 units of affordable housing in the Cypress Hills, East New York, and Ocean Hill portions of his district. Espinal used the opportunity to advocate for funding to address all of the social and infrastructure issues his community had experienced for decades. While facing opposition from a citywide advocacy group, Espinal was able to secure what some have called the most comprehensive rezoning plan in the City of New York, over a quarter of a billion dollars to address unemployment, crumbling infrastructure, and affordable housing issues. The New York Times endorsed Espinal's move and stated that \\"Espinal did right by his constituents.\\" In 2017 Espinal introduced and passed a bill calling for the full repeal of the New York City Cabaret Law, a regulation introduced in 1926 and often called racist, homophobic and authoritarian by its opponents. In 2019 Espinal passed legislation requiring all New York City buildings to install solar panels or green roofs as part of New York City's \\"Green New Deal\\" to decrease carbon emissions and build green infrastructure. On January 26, 2020 he officially resigned from the City Council to take on a job with the Freelancers Union.

It was formed as a fighter bomber unit on 1 April 1939 and was deployed in a coastal defence role as part of Coastal Command SAAF until 1943. It was disbanded after the threat of Japanese naval actions off the South African coast had waned. It was re- activated as a fighter squadron on 25 May 1944 and deployed to the Middle East where the squadron saw service in Syria, Libya and the Aegean and was disbanded at the end of the war in Italy. The squadron was reinstated as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) squadron in January 1986 in Potchefstroom to provide artillery reconnaissance and fire control for the South African Artillery Corps. The unit was operationally deployed to Angola between 1987 and 1991 and was disbanded for the last time on 31 March 1991 when the UAV's were transferred to Kentron for operational control and deployment. History =World War 2= 10 Squadron was established on 1 April 1939 as 10 Bomber Fighter Squadron at East London. It was assigned as an Active Citizen Force squadron and was placed under command of Eastern Province Command. It was re-designated as 10 (Fighter-Bomber) Squadron (10 (F.B.) Squadron) on 1 September 1939 and renamed once again as 16 (Bomber) Squadron on 1 December 1939 under command of Witwatersrand Command while the designation of 10 (F.B.) Squadron was kept in reserve to allow for possible expansion in this type of Squadron. The squadron role was changed back to that of a fighter squadron in February 1942 and it was designated for home defence purposes in Natal with Hawker Furies under command of Coastal Command SAAF.Martin and Orpen, (1979) p.275 Fearing the possible presence of a Japanese carrier force attempting to disrupt shipping in South African waters, 6 and 10 Fighter Squadrons were re-equipped with Mohawks and later Kittyhawks and organised on a mobile basis, based at Reunion Air Field close to Durban. This structure allowed the squadron to be rapidly deployed forward to airfields along the coast to allow fighter operations in the threat area. By July 1943 the Japanese threat had receded and the squadron was disbanded. The Squadron was re-established on 25 May 1944 and was deployed to Almaza in Syria, initially for training and later as a fighter squadron equipped with Spitfire Mk. Vs. By the end of June 1944 the Squadron was moved to Idku in the Nile Delta where they took over convoy escort and patrol duties from 336 (Hellenic) Squadron under command of 219 Group (RAF). The squadron aircraft were upgraded to Spitfire Mk. IXs in August 1944 and was tasked with high altitude interceptions of reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. In September the squadron was moved to Luigi di Savoia, Libya for operations over Crete and the Aegean as well as anti-submarine patrols in the Eastern Mediterranean. It was disbanded on 31 October 1944 and its aircraft were transferred to 9 Squadron.Other sources state the date of disbandment as 10 November 1944. =Reformation in the 1980s= The squadron was re-activated in January 1986 at AFB Potchefstroom and equipped with the Kentron Seeker UAV in the role of reconnaissance and artillery weapons delivery guidance support. The squadron first deployed these aircraft operationally during Operation Modular in Angola in 1987. It was finally disbanded on 31 March 1991 after the Seeker system was transferred to Kentron for operations on behalf of the SADF. The squadron flew two models: the Seeker-P model for training and the Seeker-D for operational deployment.

In 1796 he was already chief of a battalion, in 1807 he joined the service in the Kingdom of Westphalia under Napoleon Bonaparte's brother J√©r√¥me, and on 8 December 1807 he became Brigadier General, and one year later, Major General and Chief of General Staff. In July 1809, J√©r√¥me ordered Reubell with a Westphalian division to halt the Duke of Brunswick and his corps of Black Brunswickers, who were marching through Westphalia with the intention of joining their British allies on the North Sea coast. Although Reubell successfully repulsed the Brunswickers at the Battle of √ñlper just outside the city of Brunswick on 1 August, he unaccountably withdrew that night, allowing the duke to continue his march.

Green, starring Colleen Moore, produced by her husband John McCormick (1893-1961), and co-starring Moore's most popular co-star, Lloyd Hughes. The film is based on the syndicated comic strip of the same name by William M. Conselman and Charles Plumb, which in turn was based upon the millennia-old folk tale of Cinderella. In 2013, Ella Cinders was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot Ella Cinders In the house of late father in the town of Roseville, Ella Cinders (Colleen Moore) works for her shrewish stepmother Ma and two stepsisters, Prissy Pill (Emily Gerdes) and Lotta Pill (Doris Baker), who are beloved in the town but abusive toward Ella. She finds support from the local iceman, \\"Waite Lifter\\" (Lloyd Hughes). The Gem Film Company has a contest in which the winner gets an all-expense-paid trip to Hollywood and a film role. Stealing an acting book from Lotta, she works on facial expressions. A photograph is needed to enter, so Ella spends three nights babysitting to raise $3 for the photo session. The photographer unwittingly takes a picture of her looking cross-eyed at a fly on her nose which turns out to be the photo entered in the contest. Entrants must go to a Town Hall ball, but Ella's stepmother and stepsisters won't allow her to go. Waite sees her crying on the front steps and tells her he will take her to the ball. She says she has nothing to wear, so he convinces her to use one of her stepsisters' dresses. At the judges' table, her stepsisters react violently when they see the dress. The embarrassed Ella flees the ball, losing one of her slippers. She heads for an employment agency hoping for a new start, only to be placed right back with Ma, who vows to punish her severely. Later, the judges come to the house and tell Ella that she is the winner because they were amused by the cross-eyed photo and were looking at someone capable of comedy (much to Ella's disappointment at first, and Ma's fury). Ella heads for Hollywood, where she is disappointed to discover the contest was a fraud. Fearing what would happen if she tried to return to Roseville, she decides to stay in Hollywood and break into the industry as an actress the hard way; after substantial rejection and failed attempts to literally break into a studio lot, she succeeds, landing a contract to play the lead role in a rags-to-riches story similar to her own life. Waite turns out to be football hero and wealthy heir George Waite, who runs to Hollywood, sweeps Ella off her feet on the set, and marries her. The two have a child and live happily ever after.

Atmosphere is an immediate form of physical perception, and is recognised through emotional sensibility. Architects and designers use the notion of atmosphere to argue that architecture and space is designed and built for people to use and experience. Peter Zumthor in his book AtmospheresZumthor, Peter (2006). Atmospheres. Birkhauser, Switzerland. constitutes architectural atmospheres as \\"this singular density and mood, this feeling of presence, well-being, harmony, beauty...under whose spell I experience what I otherwise would not experience in precisely this way\\". Overview Spaces of atmosphere are shaped through a bodily interaction with architecture. The atmosphere is therefore closely linked to a philosophy of phenomenology and the analysis of topography. Vitruvius noted that since the human body is the measure of architecture, it is also that which determines atmospheric qualities. It is the human body that emanates the structural qualities of architecture. Drawing from Vitruvius‚Äô discussion of architecture, a number of twentieth-century architects have adopted a phenomenological interpretation of their work, to understand architecture‚Äôs primary concern as the body in space. Among these architects include; Peter Zumthor, Steven Holl and Juhani Pallasmaa. Their architectural works draw from the philosophical tradition of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Martin Heidegger, the correlation of the body and its sensory-motor functions. Merleau-Ponty in Phenomenology of PerceptionMerleau-Ponty, Maurice. (1945) Phenomenology of Perception. Routledge, New York. asserts that, ‚Äúthe body and mind cannot be separated as subject and object‚Äù. The perception of the body influences what is perceived by the mind. German philosopher Gernot B√∂hme has also expanded on the architectural atmosphere, in his essay \\"Atmosphere as the Subject Matter of Architecture\\".B√∂hme, Gernot (2005). ‚ÄúAtmosphere As The Subject Matter of Architecture‚Äù in Natural Histories. Herzog and de Meuron, Switzerland. He addresses the nature of space as the physicality of an actual space and the atmospheric qualities that are embedded within a space. B√∂hme states that ‚Äúwe must be physically present‚Äù (p. 402) to experience space in its complete entirety. By inhabiting space individuals can sense the character that surrounds them. Inhabitants sense its atmosphere. Photography, written articles and the interpretation of other viewers of a space cannot compare to individual experience and interaction in interior spaces. Spaces begin as voids, tangible and undefined structures, its atmospheres are articulated through cognitive subjects (memory, perception, judgement, emotion) and physical presence. Recently an italian philosopher Tonino Griffero addresses the theory of atmospheres in a thorough and systematic way, examining the role of atmospheres (underestimated in traditional aesthetics) in daily life and their main ontological and phenomenological characteristics,Griffero, Tonino (2010). Atmosferologia. Estetica degli spazi emozionali. Laterza, Rome-Bari. tr. Atmospheres. Aesthetics of Emotional Spaces, Ashgate, Farnham 2014 and aims to consider atmospherical feelings and moods (including pain, shame, twilight, gaze, felt-bodily isles, etc.) as prototypes of the new ontological category of quasi-things.Griffero, Tonino (2013). Quasi-cose. La realt√† dei sentimenti. Bruno Mondadori, Milano 2013. tr. Quasi-Things. The Paradigm of Atmospheres, Suny, New York 2016 Features of architectural atmospheres Several aspects of architectural and spatial design have been identified as contributing to atmosphere: Light Light that fills a room can give the impression of a space being serene, exhilarating, gloomy, celebratory or creepy. Spaces are experienced by the mood transmitted within. Peter Zumthor describes his interest in light, which is crucial in creating atmospheres within his architecture ‚Äì ‚Äú‚Ä¶Daylight, the light on things, is so moving to me that I feel almost a spiritual quality. When the sun comes up in the morning ‚Äì which I always find so marvelous‚Ä¶ and casts its light on things, it doesn‚Äôt feel as if it quite belongs in this world. I don‚Äôt understand light. It gives me the feeling there‚Äôs something beyond me, something beyond all understanding‚Äù (Atmospheres, p. 61). B√∂hme outlines the concept; that stage design, like architecture provokes emotions and atmosphere. This sense of atmosphere is enhanced ‚Äúnot only of objects, wall and solids, but also of light, sound, colour‚Ä¶‚Äù Japanese novelist Junichiro Tanizaki in his book In Praise of ShadowsTanizaki, Junichiro (1977). In Praise of Shadows. Leete‚Äôs Island Books, Canberra. describes atmospheres poetically, through space and light within Japanese thought and practice of inhabiting in variations of darkness. ‚ÄúAn empty space‚Ä¶ a mere shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; that here in the darkness immutable tranquillity holds sway‚Äù (p. 33). The mystery and ambiguity of shadows created by light are primary atmospheric conditions of interior spaces. The relationship between light and architecture occurs inevitably. Light, depending on how it is used can transform the spatial context. It can make a space seem pleasant or unpleasant, moving or ambiguous, light also plays with scale or it could be used simply to highlight elements within a space. Light makes space more enjoyable, comfortable, inhabitable and visible. Object Jean Baudrillard in The System of ObjectsBaudrillard, Jean (1968). The System of Objects. Verso used the term ‚Äòatmosphere‚Äô within the context of interior design to refer to the status image of consumption. The functional interior design, in Baudrillard‚Äôs description, is created of the combination of objects. This gives interior design its function. Objects within a space are constructed rather than inherent. Objects determine spaces of place. The objects placed in an interior create a certain atmosphere sought by the inhabitant. Objects act as replacements, products of mass production. Putting objects in a space is a means of expressing yourself. Thus the interior, through a series of cultural connotations takes on its ‚Äòatmospheric‚Äô qualities, where the term is used to describe a personal expression of status. Peter Zumthor‚Äôs view on objects within a space is that ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe idea of things that have nothing to do with me as an architect taking their place in a building, their rightful place‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a great help to me to imagine the future of rooms in a house I am building, to imagine them actually in use‚Äù (Atmospheres, p. 39). Objects in a space give a sense of identity and expressiveness to place. Objects can acquire both tangible and intangible qualities, for example; an idea, memory, colour, furniture, smell, light and texture. These are all atmospheric features present within architecture. Air Air encapsulates buildings. Building are said to be alive. By inhabitation, life is given to interior spaces through imagination and presence. Air in buildings forms an atmosphere. Steven Connor in his essay \\"Building Breathing Space\\"Connor, Steven (2004). ‚ÄúBuilding Breathing Space‚Äù in Going Ariel: Air, Art, Architecture. http://www.bbk.ac.uk/english/skc/bbs/ states, ‚ÄúLike the sky, space [is] mobile, mutable, perturbed, polymorphous, subject to stress, strain and fatigue. The most important agitations of space [are] sound, heat and odour\\" (p. 3). Connor expresses that these agitations are carried by air and fill space. Buildings defend and sustain their interiority; air creates an apparent atmosphere within architecture. Materials Materials create architectural atmospheres. Materials can be transformed in multiple ways to obtain certain atmospherics in architecture and spaces. For example a stone can be split, cut, sawed, drilled, polished and with each process it will have a different quality. Materials are also combined with other materials in a building that play with texture, colour, temperature and tone; all of which create an atmosphere and mood. For Zumthor, ‚ÄúMaterials react with one another and have their radiance, so that the material composition gives rise to something unique. Material is endless‚Äù (Atmospheres, p. 25). Sound Peter Zumthor outlines that, ‚ÄúInteriors are like large instruments, collecting sound, amplifying it, transmitting it elsewhere. That has to do with the shape peculiar to each room and with the surface of materials they contain, and the way those materials have been applied.‚Äù (Atmospheres, p. 29). Sounds are associated with certain rooms, places and memories. Empty spaces still produce sound through the stillness and silence of scale and materials. Sound in architecture is heard through physical presence and sensitivity. Sound induces emotional and sensual responses. Material, scale, memory and familiarity all create a sense of sound inside a building. It is up to individuals within a space to identify and associate with the sounds present. Sound is both a tangible and intangible sensational atmospheric quality. It allows the individual to physically hear, as well as feel and sense the characteristics present in architecture.

Some modern Chinese poetry represents major new and modern developments in the poetry of one of the world's larger areas, as well as other important areas sharing this linguistic affinity. One of the first writers of poetry in the modern Chinese poetry mode was Hu ShihDavis, xxxvi (1891‚Äì1962). Background The historical and linguistic background to modern Chinese poetry involves a long Classical Chinese poetry tradition, written or chanted in specialized, literary forms versus modern changes both in vernacular varieties of Chinese as well as the development of and exposure to various other poetic traditions from modern Europe and the United States, both directly and indirectly through Japanese literary sources. Thus, one important change in the history of Chinese poetry involves the revaluation of the use of Classical Chinese literary language and the traditions of Classical Chinese poetry. Another is the more global phenomenon of modernism in poetry, involving rejecting traditional poetic forms and styles in favor of experimental developments and novelties. =Varieties of Chinese= Modern Chinese poetry has been written and spoken in different varieties of the Chinese language. Traditionally, much poetry was written in Classical or Literary Chinese. Some modern poetry is still so written. Also used in Chinese poetry are other varieties of Chinese, such as Standard Chinese and other types of Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, Min Nan, Hakka, and Shanghainese. =Socio-political change= Modern Chinese poetry developed within a context of major socio-political changes, and some of the poets were directly involved with these as members or leaders of some of the parties involved in consciously influencing the course of historical developments. The nineteenth century had been one of upset to traditional Chinese ideas and institutions, as China went through a period of successive loss of sovereign control and self-determination as a nation and internal struggles for political power of an often violent military nature. The First Opium War (1839‚Äì42) fought between Great Britain and China resulted in the Treaty of Nanking (1842), which ceded Chinese control of five treaty ports and all of Hong Kong Island to the British. After the Second Opium War (1856 to 1860), the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895), and other conflicts China had lost control of important parts of its territory to Britain, France, the United States, Japan, Russia, Portugal, Germany, and other colonial powers, which are documented in a series of unequal treaties: these areas included all of Taiwan and many of the most important eastern cities. In the meantime, various rebellions (or civil war) arose, included among other rebellions in the Qing Dynasty were the Taiping Rebellion (1850 to 1864) and the Boxer Rebellion (1898‚Äì1901), and although the latter of which was largely directed against foreign powers and influence, both showed the weakness of the Qing court. These nineteenth century events in China resulted in an aftermath in which tens of millions of the population had died during the various conflicts, a significant part of the cultural legacy of China having been looted or destroyed (for example the Old Summer Palace and its contents, including the burning of the library), and that the Qing government increasingly having been viewed as less and less viable as a political institution, together with the Qing experiencing a demonstrable and ongoing erosion of territorial control. During the final years of the Qing dynasty poets, such as Gong Zizhen (1792‚Äì1841) continued work in the traditional Classical Chinese poetry modes, as did Huang Zunxian (1848‚Äì1905), though some changes as a reaction to events including poetic evaluation of foreign places, cultures, and ideas can be seen in Huang's works.Davis, xxxv ‚Äì xxxvi Gong Zizhen was quite disturbed by the condition of the empire,Davis, xxxv and Huang Zunxian traveled widely in the course of his diplomatic duties, including to Japan, the United States, London, and Singapore. Such experiences and the associated poetry would prove to be harbingers of the development of modern Chinese poetry in the twentieth century, and into the first part of the twenty-first century. Early twentieth century The early poetry of the twentieth century in China was written \\"in an atmosphere of great uncertainty...but of some excitement.\\"Davis, lxx Twentieth century events in China which had a major importance from the perspective of poetry include the Xinhai Revolution (1911‚Äì1912) and the end of Qing (1912), the establishment of the Republic of China (1912‚Äì1949), the Chinese Civil War (1927‚Äì1950) fought between the Guomindang and the Communist Party of China as major belligerents, the Second Sino-Japanese War and the occupation by Japan of large parts of China (1937‚Äì1945), and the establishment of People's Republic of China (1949). In the early years of the century, the Qing government clearly was not sustainable as an ongoing institution, at least without major reform. Opinion and intrigue were heavy, with the formation or existence of various parties, opinions, and secret societies. The poets did not fail to weigh in. The Southern Society (Nanshe), formed in 1909, opposed the Qing government but advocated writing traditional poetry. Its leader, Liu Yazi, continued to write in Classical Chinese until the early 1920s. =New Culture Movement= In the beginning of the twentieth century, the scene was set in China for both socio- political and poetic change, both political and literary revolution; indeed, the \\"twentieth century has drawn a heavy line across the time-chart of Chinese culture.\\"Davis, lxix The New Culture Movement also known as the May Fourth Movement, was a defining time period in the direction of poetic literature in Chinese language. Nominally originating in the socio-politically oriented student demonstrations in Beijing on May 4, 1919, the New Culture Movement May Fourth Movement was associated with a more general \\"intellectual ferment\\".Davison and Reed, 101 The Beijing University (also known as the Peking University) had an important role in this process. Both Hu Shih and Cai Yuanpei are prime examples of those associated with the university around this time who urged a transformation in literary style deprecating the use of Classical Chinese, in favor of embracing written vernacular Chinese. Hu Shih, Xu Zhimo, Guo Moruo and some of poets followed this path towards a more modern literature, through the use of a more colloquial writing style.Davison and Reed, 101‚Äì102 This, together with a western influence can be seen in other authors, such as Wen Yiduo. =International influence= The early twentieth century was also a period in which the world's other linguistic and cultural traditions of poetry greatly influenced Chinese poets, partly as a result of colonialism. For example, Lin Heng-tai grew up in Taichung, on the island of Taiwan, which was then under imperial Japanese control, with its resultant Japanese-oriented educational system; and, so, wrote all of his early poetry in Japanese. The presence of European colonies on the mainland and the islands of Hong Kong and Macau also provided sources of international influence. Attendance at university in Europe, Japan, or the United States provided another source of international influence on Chinese poets, or future Chinese poets, such as Xu Zhimo or Lu Xun (better known for his short stories and prose). =Societies= The formation of various literary or poetic societies played an important role in the developing movement of modern Chinese poetry. Among these societies are the Crescent Moon Society, the League of Left-Wing Writers, and the Silver Bell Poetry Society.Leo Oufan Lee, \\"Literary Trends: The Road to Revolution 1927‚Äì1949,\\" Ch 9 in link to excerpt =Publications= A number of magazines or other publications also played an important role in the developing movement of modern Chinese poetry. One of the important early publications for modern Chinese poetry was New Youth (Xin Qingnian) Êñ∞ÈùíÂπ¥, or La Jeunesse, which published poetry written in vernacular Chinese by Hu Shih and Liu Bannong, as early as 1918. =Continuing the classical tradition= Some authors of poetry in the first half of the twentieth century \\"continued to write pleasantly in the traditional metres and with more or less of the traditional manner\\": a major example of this is Mao Zedong (1893‚Äì1976), the first Chairman of the Communist Party of China and leader of the People's Republic of China for nearly 30 years, who continued the tradition of Chinese governmental officials writing Classical Chinese poetry. Many of Mao's popular poems can be seen to chronicle moments during his rise to power, from his early \\"Changsha\\" (1925) through \\"Reply to Mr. Liu Yazi\\" (1950). Later twentieth century By the midpoint of the twentieth century, imperial Japan had been decisively defeated as part of the process of World War II, the Guomindang had retreated to bases in Taiwan and some other islands, where they began to establish regional control, and the Communist party controlled most of the Chinese mainland. Many (with notable exceptions) of the poets of the first half of the twentieth century were already dead, imprisoned, in exile, or subject to strong political pressures to make their work conform to the expectations of their ruling governmental bodies. This was part of a trend which would continue throughout the next few years, through the so-called White Terror (1949‚Äì1987) in Taiwan and the Cultural Revolution on the mainland (1966‚Äì1976). The Cold War (often dated 1947‚Äì1991) was one of the factors which contributed to the pressure on poets to produce patriotic poetry, and since then there has been some influence wrought by various political campaigns and plans. =Amateur poetry societies= Amateur poetry societies have a long history on the mainland and on Taiwan.Davison and Reed, 107 Towards the end of the twentieth century Ming and Qing style poetry contests were held in towns and cities around Taiwan, in which people sometimes wrote poems in contests. One type of these poems were known as \\"hitting the bowl\\" poems, because of the old-fashioned method of limiting the time to compose a poem by the time being regulated by burning an inch of incense stick to which a thread suspending a coin over a bowl was attached: when the incense stick burned up, the thread burned through, and the coin sounded an alarm when it hit the bowl below. Watches may have replaced incense sticks, but the \\"hitting the bowl\\" name remains. Early twenty-first century Many of the traditional uses of Chinese poetry remain intact in the modern era. These include relationships between politics and poetry, and also completely traditional practices in folk culture such as posting New Year's couplets. Evaluation Some critical views have involved evaluation of socio-political utility or loyalty of various poems or poets. Another critical theme involves esthetic issues regarding the poetry deliberately written according to ideas about modernist/postmodernist/hypermodernist poetry versus poetry which continues the use of Classical Chinese poetry forms.

It was the first purpose- designed Art Deco cinema in Perth. The Plaza Theatre opened in 1937 and was built for Hoyts Theatres Ltd. History The Plaza Theatre was opened on Hay Street on 17 September 1937 with a seating capacity of 1,275 divided into lounge, circle and stalls. The first feature film screened at the theatre was Lloyd's of London. Built on the site of the former Majestic Picture Theatre,see and other photos of the Majestic at http://henrietta.liswa.wa.gov.au the theatre was part of a new arcade development linking Hay and Murray Streets. The arcade remains one of Perth's busiest, while the theatre has been closed and put to other uses in recent decades. Designed by William G. Bennett in association with Melbourne's H. Vivian Taylor (Taylor & Soilleux), the facade of the theatre/arcade is narrow but dramatic, presenting a stylised skyscraper effect in classic art deco fashion. It opened a year in advance of the rival development of the Piccadilly Theatre and Arcade, located 60 metres further to the west on Hay Street. Like its late-1930s rivals ‚Äì the Piccadilly Theatre and the Metro Theatre (on William Street) ‚Äì the Plaza offered a new level of comfort for Perth's movie-goers.Battye Library entry: 'A description of the new theatre designed by W.G. Bennett, especially the ventilation system built and installed by Atkins (W.A.) Ltd.' in Contact : Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Division (Atkins W.A. Ltd.), Oct. 1937, p.5, Unlike the vast atmospheric Ambassadors Theatre (across the street from the Plaza) and the monumental Capitol Theatre (on William Street), the new-wave art deco cinemas were compact and stylishly modern. In 1940 the Plaza was modernised and remodelled at a cost of ¬£15,000. Further renovations, including the refurbishing of the interior and the installation of a Todd-AO sound system, were completed before the opening of South Pacific in 1960, which established a new long-run record for Perth of 45 weeks. The seating capacity of the theatre was reduced to less than one thousand in 1961. With increased capacity, a new screen and plusher appointments, the Plaza became Hoyts' premier theatre in Western Australia. On 17 August 1965 the theatre closed and re-opened two days later as the Paris. Soon after, Hoyts relinquished their lease to the Ace Theatre group. With the advent of the multi-screen central city and suburban complexes, the theatre was closed permanently in 1984, briefly becoming a youth disco. In 2003 the Plaza Arcade was acquired by Lease Equity, on behalf of Atzemis Berbatis Group for $26 million. In August 2005 a major refurbishment of the Arcade commenced, under the supervision of Bollig Architects with construction by Link Projects and Project Management. The $5 million redevelopment featured new Italian terrazzo mall tiles, modern ceiling works, new facade lighting and glass panelling, and was completed in October 2006. Architectural character The Plaza Arcade has 40 convenience based shops on the ground floor, with the former cinema above. The arcade entrance at Hay and Murray Streets is located centrally within the facade, with a shop on either side. The facade of the building at Hay Street has been constructed in the Inter-war Art Deco style. At first floor level the facade is divided into three bays, symmetrically composed around the dominant central bay. This bay is rendered. The flanking bays are painted brickwork. The shops below the canopy have been modernised. Architecture historian Ross Thorne provides the following description: Heritage value The Plaza Theatre and Arcade was classified by the National Trust of Australia (WA) on 3 December 1990.

It functioned from 1869 till 1972 when it closed down due to lack of patronage.  History  The Trichinopoly Club or Trichy Club was founded in 1869 as a Europeans-only club. A gymkhana club was also founded in association with it. After flourishing in its early days, the club gradually began to run out of members. The numbers declined from about 50 in the early 1900s to 6 in 1955 and 3 in 1957. The decline was partly attributed to the club's policy to give membership only to Europeans. Eventually, H. C. Boas, the then President of the club, requested the Madras Club to bail it out. Down to one or two members, the club was closed down in 1972, three years after celebrating its centenary. Its assets were taken over by the Madras Club.

He is a specialist leg break spin bowler and is known for his leg spinners, flippers and googlies. He is regarded by Shane Warne as one of the best spinners in modern cricket. Shah made his Test match debut for Pakistan against Australia in the UAE on 22 October 2014. During Pakistan's tour of Sri Lanka, Shah became the fastest Pakistani bowler to take 50 Test wickets. In December 2018, during Pakistan's series against New Zealand, Shah became the fastest bowler to take 200 wickets in Tests, breaking an 82-year old record. Family Born into a Bondizai Pashtun family in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 1986, Shah is the cousin of Pakistani fast-bowler Junaid Khan as well as of Australian leg- spinner Fawad Ahmed.Tom Morris (12 December 2016), \\"Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah's story from domestic cricket butterfly to international star\\", Fox Sports.

He was picked in place of Saeed Ajmal, who was banned for an illegal bowling action. In the first Test, he picked up 7 for 116 with Steve Smith becoming his first wicket. He helped the team to win the match by 221 runs. In the second Test, he picked 5 for 91 which resulted a 356-run win for Pakistan and a whitewash for Australia. He picked 12 for 207 overall and was the second highest wicket-taker of that series. In June 2015, while on tour against Sri Lanka, Shah became the fastest Pakistani bowler to take 50 Test wickets, which he did in just nine matches. The record for Pakistan in Test cricket was previously held by Waqar Younis, Mohammad Asif and Shabbir Ahmed, all of whom took 50 wickets in ten matches. However, the fastest bowler to take 50 wickets in Test cricket is Charles Turner of Australia, who accomplished the feat in only six matches. Shah then picked up 3 consecutive five-wicket hauls in three Tests against Sri Lanka, further improving his Test record. For his performances in 2015, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC.https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/182259 He was also named in the Test XI of the year 2015 by Cricinfo In July 2016, while on tour against England, Shah became the first leg spinner to take a five-wicket haul in a Test innings at Lord's since Mushtaq Ahmed in 1996. and 10 wickets in the whole match. He also became the highest wicket-taking bowler in a single match from any Asian side at Lord's. On 18 July 2016, Shah reached No. 1 in the ICC rankings for Test bowlers, becoming the first Pakistani bowler to do since Ahmed in December 1996. He displaced English quick Jimmy Anderson from the No. 1 spot and is the first leg spinner since Warne in 2005 to be ranked No. 1. However, following his poor performance in the second Test eight days later, he dropped four places to number five. Shah had 86 wickets to his name at the end of his 13th Test match and, after 15, the total was 90. Both these totals are world records for any bowler after their 13th and 15th Test match respectively. In his 17th Test match against West Indies in Dubai, Shah took his 100th Test wicket and became the second fastest ever to achieve this milestone, with only George Lohmann bettering it. He is fastest Pakistani to take 50 and 100 wickets in Tests. On 28 September 2017, during the first Test against Sri Lanka, he became the joint-second fastest bowler of all time and quickest spinner to take 150 wickets in Tests. In November 2018, in the second Test against New Zealand, Shah took fourteen wickets in the match. In the first innings, he took eight wickets for 41 runs, the best for any bowler against New Zealand in a Test match. On the same day, he took a total of ten wickets to become the first bowler for Pakistan and, only the second bowler overall, to take ten wickets in a single day of Test match cricket. His match figures of 14/184 are currently the best by a Pakistani spin bowler in Tests, the second-best figures by any bowler for Pakistan in Tests and the most wickets by a single bowler against New Zealand in a Test match. In December 2018, during the same series against New Zealand, Shah took his 200th wicket in Test cricket. He became the fastest bowler, in terms of matches played, to take 200 wickets in Tests, doing so in his 33rd match. In November 2019, during the series against Australia, Yasir Shah set a record for becoming the first ever bowler to concede 200 runs in an innings of a Test match on three occasions. During the same series, he also scored his first century in Test cricket. In the series against Bangladesh he took 4-58 in the 2nd innings of the first test. In June 2020, he was named in a 29-man squad for Pakistan's tour to England during the COVID-19 pandemic. In July, he was shortlisted in Pakistan's 20-man squad for the Test matches against England. 2015 World Cup In January 2015, Shah was selected in Pakistan's squad for the 2015 Cricket World Cup and was considered as a long-term replacement for Pakistan's banned off spinner Saeed Ajmal. He made his World Cup debut against arch- rivals India on 15 February 2015. Doping violation Starting from 27 December 2015 to 27 March 2016, Shah was banned for 3 months from playing any type of cricket by the ICC after a sample taken from him on 13 November was found to contain chlortalidone, a banned substance which is on WADA's prohibited list of diuretics and masking agents.

Craig is a millionaire who owns companies that manage high-rise buildings. His current company manages about $1.3 billion of assets. Upon entering politics in 2011, he opposed same-sex marriage, foreign ownership of land and housing, and \\"anti-smacking\\" legislation. On 19 June 2015, Craig resigned as leader of the Conservative Party following allegations of inappropriate behaviour surrounding the party's former press secretary Rachel MacGregor (to which he admitted later at a second press conference on 22 June 2015 with his wife) and tensions with the party's governing board. Craig has since admitted to inappropriate conduct with MacGregor but has denied charges of sexual harassment a claim being challenged in the courts by several people including Craig himself. On 27 June, Colin Craig was formally suspended from the Conservative Party. Since then, his suspension has been invalidated which would enable Craig to contest the Conservative Party's leadership. On 16 November 2015, Craig announced that he would not be contesting the Conservative Party leadership in lieu of a police investigation against him over his Party's spending during the 2014 general election.

As of June 2014, he is resident in Fairview Heights on Auckland's North Shore. Views Craig has stated he is not sure that \\"legislating morality\\" works well. However, he has described legalisation of same-sex marriage as \\"social engineering\\", and is also opposed to gay adoption, adolescent access to abortion, and voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide. In May 2012, Craig described New Zealand's young men and women as \\"the most promiscuous in the world\\" based upon surveys such as David P. Schmitt's International Sexuality Description Project research statistics and anecdotal evidence from New Zealand gynaecologists, a statement which was dismissed by Prime Minister John Key and other political leaders like Tariana Turia and Winston Peters. Following a series of child poverty items on current affairs show Campbell Live and a fundraising effort from the show to raise money for school lunches, Craig said children sent to school without lunch should go without. Instead, their parents should be charged the \\"cost of rectifying their bad behaviour\\". In September 2012, Craig had 20,000 leaflets delivered to residents in the Helensville electorate, claiming locals had told him Helensville MP and Prime Minister John Key was \\"too gay\\" to be their representative in Parliament. In April 2013 Craig sided with controversial Danish politician Marie Krarup after she called a traditional Maori greeting \\"grotesque\\". Craig said no visitors should have to face a \\"bare-bottomed native making threatening gestures\\" if they didn't want to. Following the legalisation of same sex marriage in April 2013, Craig said \\"the day of reckoning\\" would come, that it was a \\"failure of democracy\\" and that \\"[it] was not a vote of the people of New Zealand,\\" adding \\"If it had been, the answer would have been no.\\"Gay marriage opponents licking wounds http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/8566153/Gay-marriage- opponents-licking-wounds Craig has been known to take offence at satirical articles directed at him, including a piece on the satirical website The Civilian, which he said published a story designed \\"to make him look ridiculous\\".

In November 2013 Craig said humans were not to blame for climate change, instead pointing to sunspots and \\"the circulation of planets\\".VIDEO: Who is Colin Craig?. 3 News NZ. 15 November 2013. Political career =March for Democracy= Craig first emerged as a conservative activist in 2009 when he organised and funded a \\"march for democracy\\" to protest government decisions not to adhere to three citizen's initiated referenda: # the 1999 New Zealand MP reduction referendum, on a proposed reduction in the number of members of parliament (1999 ‚Äì 81% in favour) # the 1999 New Zealand justice referendum, re sundry suggested changes to the justice system (1999 ‚Äì 92% in favour) # the 2009 referendum concerning the repeal of the 2007 amendment of the Crimes Act, the so-called \\"anti-smacking\\" law, which removed parental corporal punishment as a defense in criminal assault cases (2009 ‚Äì 87% in favour). He spent $450,000 organising the march, and it attracted 5,000 participants. In 2010, Craig contested the Auckland Mayoral election, finishing third with 42,598 votes behind Len Brown, mayor of Manukau City (237,487 votes) and John Banks (New Zealand politician and former mayor of Auckland ‚Äì 171,542 votes), but ahead of incumbent North Shore City mayor Andrew Williams (3,813 votes). =Conservative Party leadership= In 2011 Craig announced the formation of the Conservative Party of New Zealand. The party contested the 2011 general election on a variety of issues, including the introduction of binding referenda, reducing the number of members of parliament while increasing the electoral term by one year, law and order reform (including work for prisoners), a repeal of the New Zealand emissions trading scheme, the protection of state assets (notably the foreshore and seabed), and fiscal conservatism. In September 2011, he announced he would stand in the Rodney electorate for the 2011 general election. After pre-election polling in this electorate, Craig claimed to have 47% support while the National Party candidate Mark Mitchell had 36.3%. Prime Minister and National Party leader John Key said that the Conservative Party faced a \\"massive hurdle\\" to get a seat in Parliament. According to preliminary election results, Mitchell won the seat with 52.6% of the vote, and Colin Craig came second with 21.4% of the vote. The Conservative Party also gained 2.76% of the vote nationwide, the fifth-largest share of any party and more than four of the parties that actually won seats, but this was insufficient for any Conservatives to enter Parliament because of the 5% of the party vote or one electorate seat required by the mixed-member proportional voting system operating in New Zealand. Since the Conservative party's conception, Craig has donated $4 million. He is one of the party's two major donors besides Waikato businessman Laurence Day. Craig stood as a candidate in the East Coast Bays electorate in the 2014 general election but failed to win the electorate. His party received 4.1% of the vote; less than 5% of the voting threshold which denied them a seat in the New Zealand Parliament. On 18 September 2014, the Conservative Party's press secretary Rachel MacGregor resigned, citing his alleged manipulative behaviour. When questioned by the media, Craig denied the allegations and offered to discuss the issue with MacGregor following the 2014 general election. In February 2014, the-then Green Party co-leader Russel Norman alleged that Colin Craig held misogynistic and homophobic attitudes during a speech at the Big Gay Out event in Auckland. Norman's comments prompted Craig to file a defamation suit and to demand that Norman issue an apology. In response, Norman and the Green Party announced that they would contest the lawsuit. On 10 October 2014, following the 2014 general election, both parties settled the lawsuit out of court and agreed to bear their own legal expenses. =2015 leadership dispute= In June 2015, Colin Craig drew criticism from elements of the Conservative Party when he participated in a sauna interview hosted by TV3 reporter David Farrier, which they felt badly reflected on Craig's public image. The interview was part of the television channel's new Sauna Session current affairs series. Following sexual harassment allegations that were published on the right-wing blogger Cameron Slater's blog Whale Oil, Craig resigned as party leader on 19 June 2015 and also agreed to \\"facilitate a review\\" of the leadership. Craig was also criticised by elements of the Conservative Party for postponing a leadership vote at a scheduled board meeting that month. On 20 June 2015, Colin Craig announced that he was not ruling out a return to the Conservative Party's leadership if he found sufficient support from the Party's members. He also threatened to sue several media outlets over allegations that he had paid off his former secretary MacGregor over a complaint of sexual harassment to the New Zealand Human Rights Commission. On 21 June, The New Zealand Herald reported that Craig had settled a \\"financial dispute\\" with MacGregor for around NZ$16,000 to $17,000 approximately eight weeks earlier. The television channel One News also reported that there was a serious falling-out between Craig and several Conservative board members. One board member, John Stringer, has accused Craig of lying to the board and other inappropriate behaviour. In response, Craig has denied these allegations and threatened to take action against Stringer for speaking to the media. During the press conference held on 22 June 2015, Craig admitted that he had acted inappropriately towards his press secretary Rachel MacGregor but denied any charges of sexual harassment. In response, MacGregor accused the former Conservative leader for breaching a confidentiality agreement the pair had reached under Human Rights Commission mediation and disputed his version of the events. Craig's wife Helen Craig also announced that she was standing by her husband and characterised the charges against him as \\"false allegations.\\" Both Craig and MacGregor have also denied that they were involved in a romantic relationship. Both Craig and MacGregor have also indicated that they would support the lifting of the confidentiality agreement in order to allay uncertainty and speculation. According to the Herald, several board members of the Conservative Party including John Stringer, Christine Rankin, and Laurence Day have indicated support for a change of leadership. A board meeting has been scheduled for 27 June 2015 and Day has also called for Craig to be expelled from the party. Following the resignation of six Conservative Party board members, Craig indicated that a new board and a new leader would later be elected by the Party over the weekend. Craig has not ruled out contesting the leadership poll. It is currently unclear whether the dissolution of the board would favor Craig or any other contender for the Conservative Party's leadership. On 27 June 2015, Colin Craig was formally suspended from the Conservative Party by the party's newly appointed board which consisted of John Stringer and four newly appointed members. Four of the five board members with the exception of Stringer voted to suspend the former Conservative leader's membership. The conference took place in a hotel room at the Heartland Hotel near Auckland International Airport. According to One News, Craig has since challenged the legality of Stringer and the board's actions; claiming that Stringer had been suspended from the Party. He has also not ruled out contesting the Conservative Party's leadership. Craig's remarks have been dismissed by Stringer, who has become the Party's interim leader. On 5 July 2015, John Stringer resigned his positions as chairman and board member to preserve the neutrality of the second Board so he and Craig could resolve their differences in court separately. According to the New Zealand Herald, a statement by former chairman Brian Dobbs that Stringer had been suspended meant that the decision by the interim board to suspend Colin Craig's membership was invalid. It transpired that the \\"suspension\\" of Stringer was nothing more than a phone call by Dobbs to Nathaniel Heslop (who had already resigned) and Stringer was never notified of any hearing or meeting being the only other Board member still active. Dobbs then resigned hours later with Stringer not being notified he was 'suspended\\" until a week later which was ignored. Documents later emerged that Craig had threatened Dobbs with personal liabilities of the party debts and letters flowed from Craig's lawyers to Dobbs. On 7 July, Craig also sent a personal letter to Conservative Party members to apologize for his behaviour and to gauge whether he had sufficient support to return to the Party's leadership. On 29 July 2015, Colin Craig announced that he was going to sue several opponents including Conservative Party member John Stringer, the right wing blogger Cameron Slater and New Zealand Taxpayers' Union's president Jordan Williams for alleged defamation. In addition, Craig also circulated a booklet, entitled \\"Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas\\", which he claimed outlined a \\"campaign of defamatory lies\\" against him. On 2 August 2015, Craig also announced his intention to contest the Auckland mayoral election in 2016. On 10 August 2015, John Stringer lodged a complaint against Colin Craig with the New Zealand Police, alleging that the later had exceeded his allocated election fund legal limit by NZ$2,000 when contesting the East Coast Bays electorate in 2014. In addition, Stringer criticized Craig's management of the Conservative Party's 2014 election campaign. The following day, Stringer submitted a dossier of documents to both the Police and the Electoral Commission. On 14 August 2015, Jordan Williams served proceedings in defamation against Colin Craig and several Conservative Party officials in response to Craig's statements at the July press conference and in the circular Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas. On 11 September 2015 Colin Craig filed a defamation suit against the Party's former chairman, John Stringer. Stringer has indicated that he would contest these charges in court. On 7 November 2015, Colin Craig was outed as the anonymous \\"Mr X\\" who posed as a party whistleblower that was interviewed in the \\"Dirty Politics\\" booklet delivered earlier in July. Despite acknowledging that he had fabricated the interview by posing as the interviewee, he defended his actions on the grounds that \\"talking about himself\\" in the third person was a common literary tool. He also stood by his assertions in the \\"Dirty Politics\\" booklet and vowed to continue his involvement in the Conservative Party. On 16 November, Craig announced that he would not contest the Conservative Party's leadership in lieu of a police investigation over his Party's spending during the 2014 general election. However, he also indicated that he would contest the 2017 general elections if he was cleared and if the Party wanted him back. On 24 November, it was reported that Craig had demanded that the blogger Cameron Slater pay him NZ$15,000 as compensation for reproducing a poem written for his former press secretary Rachel MacGregor on his blog Whale Oil. Post- leadership On 19 January 2016, Colin Craig donated NZ$36,000 to the Conservative Party. Despite his lack of involvement with the leadership, he stated that he and his wife still wanted to support the Party financially. On 1 March 2016, Stringer subsumed his Christchurch counter-claim suit against the Craigs within new proceedings for defamation against the Craigs in Auckland. Stringer's case was heard in Auckland before Justice Palmer September 2019 (verdict pending) and the older counter-claim was voided by the plaintiff (Stringer). In early April 2016, Craig tabled legal papers seeking more than $NZ13,000 in legal damages from blogger Cameron Slater for publishing his romantic poem The Two of Me relating to the former Conservative press secretary Rachel MacGregor on his blog Whale Oil the previous year. In April 2016, the High Court ruled that the telecommunications company Vodafone could not disclose private email correspondence between Craig and former party member John Stringer, who welcomed the decision. Craig also agreed to pay Vodafone's legal bills. =2016 Defamation lawsuit= On 5 September 2016, Colin Craig appeared in the Auckland High Court to face a defamation lawsuit filed by Taxpayers' Union executive director Jordan Williams. Williams had filed the lawsuit after Craig alleged that Williams lied when he said that Craig had sexually harassed his former press secretary Rachel MacGregor. A jury of seven men and five women were selected for the trial, which is scheduled to take place for five weeks. On 6 September, Williams submitted text message correspondence between Craig and MacGregor as evidence of Craig's alleged sexual harassment. Williams has also alleged that Craig had breached a confidentiality agreement with McGregor. On 7 September 2016, the former Conservative Party deputy Christine Rankin took the stand to testify in support of Williams' defamation suit. Rankin testified that revelations about Craig's alleged inappropriate relationship with MacGregor had led her to question Craig's suitability to lead the Party. That same day, Williams took the stand to read portions of Craig's poems to MacGregor. He also alleged that Craig's defence team had tried to link him to the Dirty Politics scandal by alleging that he had taken part in a smear campaign against the former head of the Serious Fraud Office. On 8 September, the judge discharged a juror after he revealed that he had a connection to a witness who was scheduled to give evidence for Craig later in the trial. As a result, the trial would proceed with eleven jurors. On 8 September, Craig's lawyer Stephen Mills QC cross- examined Williams, who admitted that he had never seen the actual \\"sex text\\" between Craig and MacGregor. He also presented correspondence between Craig and MacGregor and contended that their relationship was consensual. The following day, Mills continued his cross-examination of Williams and suggested that William's motives for releasing the letters and emails were link to an ulterior motive of removing Craig as Party leader. Williams admitted this was the case but asserted that Craig's alleged inappropriate relationship with MacGregor made him an unsuitable leader for a \\"Christian movement based on family values.\\" On 12 September, the former Conservative board member John Stringer alleged that Craig was involved romantically with other women besides Rachel MacGregor. He also denied that there was a \\"dirty politics\\" strategy against Craig and alleged that Crag had disciplined, harassed, and attacked members that had disagreed with him. In his testimony, Stringer also alleged that Craig had created a \\"cult-like culture of confidentiality within the Conservative Party.\\" On 14 and 15 September, Craig's former press secretary Rachel MacGregor took the stand to testify about Craig's alleged sexual harassment during the three-year period she had spent working as his press secretary. In her testimony, MacGregor cited a disagreement about her pay rate as the final straw in her decision to resign as press secretary two days before the 2014 general election. In addition, MacGregor admitted that Craig had once fallen asleep on her lap but denied singing Christian hymns to him during that incident. On 15 September, the former Auckland City councillor Aaron Bhatnagar testified in support of Williams. He dismissed Craig's claim that he had supplied the text correspondence between Craig and MacGregor to Williams as false allegations that had damaged his reputation. On the afternoon of 15 September, Colin Craig and his lawyer Stephen Mills began presenting evidence for his defence after Jordan Williams and his team concluded their evidence. On 16 September, Craig denied William's allegations that he had sexually harassed MacGregor and likened their relationship to that of siblings. Craig also testified that MacGregor had proposed to marry him but that he had turned her offer down because he was already married. In his testimony, he argued that his rejection of MacGregor's proposition had led her to resign as press secretary. On 19 September, Craig denied sending any sex text messages to Rachel McGregor but during cross-examination was unable to provide evidence supporting his claim. While hundreds of text messages from MacGregor's phone had been submitted as evidence, Craig's complete phone records have not been supplied to the court. The following day, Craig denied that he charged a 29.5% interest rate on MacGregor's loan in order to coerce her into dropping her sexual harassment claim against him. He maintained that he had imposed the interest rate after she had resigned because she had defaulted on a $19,000 loan. On 20 September, Craig's wife Helen Craig testified that MacGregor had privately called her to confess that she was having an emotional relationship with Craig. She added that MacGregor had admitted kissing Craig on the night of the 2011 general election. Helen also confirmed that she had forgiven her husband. Helen also testified that she and Craig had drawn up a set of \\" working rules\\" to govern his working relationship. While Craig had admitted kissing McGregor, he denied undressing or having sexual intercouse with her. On 21 September, the investigative journalist Nicky Hager testified as part of Colin Craig's defense. In his testimony, he alleged that the information that had been released about Colin Craig on blogs like Cameron Slater's Whale Oil matched the patterns he had documented in his book Dirty Politics, which had inspired Craig's pamphlet \\"Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas\\". Brian Dobbs, the former chairman of the Conservative Party, also testified that he and several other board members had expressed their discomfort with Craig and MacGregor's relationship. He criticized Craig for proceeding with the a 2015 sauna interview with a journalist without consulting him first. Dobbs also disclosed that Williams had showed him a collection of love letters, poems, emails, and other correspondence between Craig and MacGregor in June 2015. On 22 September, former Conservative Party board member Laurence Day disputed Rachel MacGregor's claim that Colin Craig had sexually harassed her on the grounds that Williams had failed to present the incriminating alleged \\"sext\\" text message. He alleged that Williams was trying to use the sexual harassment allegations to turn the party board members against Craig. Meanwhile, Family First director Bob McCoskrie described Williams' leak of the alleged sexual harassment allegations as part of an \\"organized campaign\\" to unseat Craig. Day and McCoskrie supported Craig's assertion that his relationship with MacGregor had been inappropriate but consensual. McCoskrie defended Craig's pamphlet as a response to the alleged \\"organized campaign\\" against Craig. On 23 September, several Conservative Party staff members testified in Craig's defense. Two staffers Bev Adair-Beets and Angela Storr alleged that MacGregor had tried to exploit her relationship with Craig and disputed her sexual harassment allegations. Another staffer Kevin Stitt vouched for the accuracy of the allegations presented in Craig's \\"Dirty Politics\\" pamphlet. The left-wing blogger Martyn \\"Bomber\\" Bradbury also alleged that Williams had embarked on what he described as a \\"political hit\\" job against the former Conservative leader. While on the stand, the plaintiff Williams disputed Craig's defense lawyer Stephen Mill's charge that he had used MacGregor for political gain. On 28 September, lawyers for both Jordan Williams and Colin Craig entered closing arguments. William's lawyer Peter Knight argued that the love letters and poems were proof that Williams had not been lying about Craig's alleged sexual harassment against MacGregor. In response, Craig's lawyer Stephen Mills asserted Craig had a right to defend himself through his \\"Dirty Politics\\" pamphlet. Mills also contended that Williams had broken MacGregor's trust by passing information on her relationship with Craig to other Conservative Party officials and Cameron Slater's blog Whale Oil. On 30 September, after ten hours of deliberations, the jury unanimously found Craig guilty on two counts of defamation against Williams. Craig was ordered to pay $1.3 million in compensation and punitive damages to Williams. While Williams and his supporters including Cameron Slater have welcomed the decision, Craig's lawyers have announced that they would be appealing the verdict and challenging the size of the damages awarded. = Historic defamation damages award v Craig appealed = On 12 April 2017, High Court Justice Katz ruled that the compensation damages of $1.27 million constituted a \\"miscarriage of justice\\". The decision was welcomed by Colin Craig as a vindication of his assertion that he was responding to attacks on his character by Jordan Williams. However the judge's decision related only to the amount of damages awarded to Williams against Craig by the jury not their verdict that Williams had been defamed by Craig which stood. Justice Katz indicated that the two parties had until 26 April 2017 to consent to the High Court substituting its own award or setting aside the earlier verdict and ordering a retrial. Mr Williams filed an appeal of the Katz decision. Colin Craig did not file an acceptance of this action by 26 April, actioning an inevitable re-trial. However, Jordan Williams then filed an appeal of the judge's decision seeking the jury damages award in his favour stand. He released a press statement late April saying \\"Colin Craig argued that the jury's damages award was too high. The judge agreed but the High Court is only able to reset the damages if both parties agree...I don't want Rachel MacGregor or my mother or any other of my witnesses to have to go through it all again. The jury made clear findings. At every stage Mr Craig has wanted to stretch things out. We have no assurance he would not appeal after a new trial...So an appeal now could get to the key issues directly. It is the best way forward.\\" = Human Rights Review Tribunal record damages awarded against Craig = On 3 October, it was reported that the Human Rights Review Tribunal had, earlier in 2016, ordered Craig to pay Rachel MacGregor $128,780 in compensation for breaching the non-disclosure agreement with MacGregor by giving interviews about her. Because of the Williams defamation trial, the decision had been covered by blanket suppression until after the Williams v Craig verdict. As of 2016, this amounts to the highest amount awarded by the Human Rights Review Tribunal. In addition, Craig paid MacGregor $100,000 relating to her legal costs. =Subsequent developments= On 4 October, the Conservative Party's board chairman Leighton Baker (confirmed as new leader of the party on 24 January 2017 confirmed that Colin Craig had resigned his membership and was not holding any positions in the party. However, Craig has not ruled out playing a role with the Conservatives after his legal problems were resolved.4 October 2016 Newshub and Paul Henry Breakfast On 6 December 2016, Craig won his bid for his upcoming defamation case against former Party official John Stringer to be heard before a judge rather than a jury as with the Williams case which Craig lost with historic damages. The Craig v Stringer case had been scheduled to be heard in the Christchurch High Court before Justice Gendall for a three- week period on 6 March 2017 (Craig v Stringer). In late 2016 John Stringer succeeded before Justice Nation in having granted an application for a Judicial Settlement Conference under r7:79 in Christchurch. On 30 January 2017 Craig and Stringer settled their differences and the case against Stringer was dropped. No money exchanged hands and the settlement was sealed by the court and will not be released. On 6 December 2016, Judge Mary Beth Sharp of the Auckland District Court dismissed both of Craig's copyright lawsuits against Cameron Slater and Jordan Williams over the publication of Craig's poem Two of Me calling the claims \\"vexatious\\" and \\"improper\\" and a \\"deception perpetrated on the court\\". On 6 April 2017, Colin Craig filed a $240,000 lawsuit against former employee Jacqueline Stiekema regarding defamatory statements she had allegedly made on a Facebook page and other defamatory publications she had made to a third person. On 29 March 2017 Associate Judge Bell transferred the application to strike out the case to the district court. =2017 defamation trials= Craig and blogger Cameron Slater both sued each other for defamation following the 2014 election. The cases were held in May 2017 and Craig represented himself in the four week trial. The Judge reserved his decision. 8 May - 1 June 2017 the Craig v Slater (and Slater v Craig counterclaim) CIV2015-404-1923 was heard in the Auckland High Court before Justice Toogood. Slater was represented by Brian Henry and Craig represented himself. The trial went a week past its scheduled three weeks. Craig said the case came down to credibility and whom the judge believed was telling the truth. Slater sued Craig for alleged defamatory statements in his booklet \\"Dirty Politics & Hidden Agendas\\" (2015) and Craig sued Slater for making alleged defamatory statements on his blog. These included that Craig: had sexually harassed Rachel MacGregor; lied about it; and covered it up after settling a sexual harassment hearing in the Human Rights Commission and then the Human Rights Review Tribunal; and that there was a \\"second woman\\". It transpired during the trial that Slater had been rung by a barrister that he knew (and whose identity vocation and area of practice he had chosen to keep anonymous) was in fact working for Colin Craig. There was disagreement over phone calls on 24 and 25 June 2015 initiated by the barrister and allegedly by Mr Craig which left Slater with an inference the barrister (a sexual harassment specialist) was representing a \\"second victim\\" with whom \\"Craig was a factor\\". However, neither the barrister nor Craig ever revealed the conflict of interest nor did Craig correct Slater's inference at any stage leading up to and during most of the trial (the \\"second woman\\" was a central factor in both the earlier Craig v Stringer and Williams v Craig proceedings based on that evidence). Craig instead chose to sue all three parties for this contention which he knew was false yet allowed Slater to infer without correction until the much later trial. The judge reserved his decision on 1 June 2017 to be delivered \\"as quickly as possible.\\" The Slater trial was the second in a triumvirate of trials central to a cluster of ancillary proceedings involving Craig (in the District Court; in hearings; in tribunals; and with the police; the Privacy Commission and the Electoral Commission all based on independent complaints). The main three trials (all filed 2015) concern the so-called \\"Dirty Politics Brigade\\" (Jordan Williams; Cameron Slater; John Stringer) alleged in the Craig's booklet \\"Dirty Politics & Hidden Agendas (2015) named after the Hager book \\"Dirty Politics\\" (2014). The Williams trial concluded 30 September 2016; the Slater-Craig trials 1 June 2017; and Stringer v Craig & Others CIV2015-404-2524 is anticipated later in 2017 which will be the largest of the three. The latter has six defendants including Helen Craig but one of the defendants (a lawyer) settled with John Stringer in May 2016. Stringer and Craig also settled \\"Craig v Stringer\\" (CIV2015-409-0575) on 30 January 2017 in the Christchurch high court for zero an unrelated but parallel proceeding to the three main trials which largely concern the same issues and the same people. On 9 June, it was reported that Colin Craig had filed a lawsuit against his former press secretary Rachel MacGregor. He was criticized by MacGregor, her advocate Ruth Money, and Jordan Williams for abusing the legal process. On 20 June, MacGregor filed a counter-suit against her former employer for defamation. On 31 July, Judge Garry Harrison dismissed Craig's lawsuit against the former employee Jacky Stiekema, who had previously worked as a trust accounts manager for his company Centurion Management. =Second strike-out of Craig suit 1 September 2017= On Friday 1 September 2017 Judge Harrison delivered a second strike-out of a Craig defamation suit. In the judges' four page decision Craig was ordered to pay Mrs Jacky Stiekema [Craig v Stiekema Civ2915-404-002882] $17600 in costs following his earlier refusal to discontinue what was described as frivolous litigation [para 12 of the decision] against her by senior barrister Peter McKnight of Wellington firm Langford Law. In the Stiekema case it was concluded Craig sought to obtain emails (that did not exist) between John Stringer (see above) and Mrs Stiekema for ulterior purposes (so Craig could use any material discovered against Stringer elsewhere); ruled a \\"fishing expedition\\" in relation to Craig by Associate Judge Osborne in the Christchurch High Court in yet another Craig proceeding.See para 11 The Judge Harrison decision followed an earlier decision by Judge Sharp at the Auckland District Court in December 2016 to strike-out Craig's litigation Craig v Social Media Ltd and Jordan Williams described as \\"vexatious,\\" \\"malicious\\" and \\"a deception on the court.\\" In both instances Craig is appealing the judgements. Jacky Stiekema (described in blog posts by Stringer as \\"Grandma Quilts\\" to protect her privacy) had previously worked as a senior trust account manager at Craig's Centurion company. In 2012, Stiekema had successfully taken Craig to the Employment Court for which she was awarded several thousand dollars. It was felt in some quarters that perhaps the more recent litigation was in retaliation for this as it appeared difficult to ascertain Craig's motivation for suing Stiekema and that he had failed \\"to disclose a serious tort\\".see 6 of Harrison 1 September 2017 ref ibid At the time of Stiekema's 2012 Employment Court hearing, it was reported that Craig had made remarks claiming that \\"shortness\\" was the result of sin; an allusion to the Biblical character Zaccheus the tax collector. Stiekema also objected at being forced to attend \\"prayer meetings\\" run by Craig at the business despite Stiekema's strong personal Christian faith. =New litigation, 2017-2019= In late 2017 Craig was facing additional strike-out applications including a recall and possible strikeout of his Christchurch high court case against John Stringer (mid-October 2017; that was settled by Stringer in January 2017 for zero), still to be heard. He is involved in multiple proceedings including a new suit announced against his former sexual harassment complainant Rachel MacGregor and a counter suit from her against Craig. On 24 September 2018, Craig dropped his damages claim against MacGregor but stated that he was still pursuing his defamation claim against his former press secretary. MacGregor has also pursued a defamation claim against her former employer. On 25 October, Auckland High Court Judge Kit Toogood ruled that Craig had committed \\"moderately serious sexual harassment\\" against MacGregor. He also ruled that Cameron Slater had defamed Craig in five untrue statements but declined to award damages, stating that \\"the reputational damage which Mr Craig suffered throughout the events traversed at length in this judgment resulted almost entirely from his own actions.\\" In mid September 2015, Stringer filed a lawsuit against Craig and others, claiming Colin and Helen Craig's 2015 booklet Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas was defamatory of him. The case was heard before Justice Palmer in September 2019 (verdict pending).https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/pdf/jdo/61/alfresco/service/api/node/content/workspace/SpacesStore/12fea959-37e2-4829-b910-6d7de249c8f5/12fea959-37e2-4829-b910-6d7de249c8f5.pdf Earlier in 2019, the same Justice, the son of Sir Geoffrey Palmer, threw Craig's Christchurch high court case against Stringer (also for defamation) out of court. This is being appealed by Craig in Auckland and was heard 11-12 March 2020 before the Appeals' Court.https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/120171701/judge-was-not-wrong-to- deny-colin-craig-a-payout-for-defamation-court-of-appeal-hears Justice Palmer described it as \\"unjust\\" and \\"an abuse\\" against Stringer, and ruled it not be allowed to continue, \\"Mr Craig‚Äôs defamation proceeding against Mr Stringer is stayed\\" [67b].https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/pdf/jdo/1a/alfresco/service/api/node/content/workspace/SpacesStore/eb74a884-b243-4161-a346-78e8f9a30de8/eb74a884-b243-4161-a346-78e8f9a30de8.pdf Several Craig appeals are pending and the verdict for defamation in (2015) Stringer v Craig and Others (a repeat of the parallel Williams and Slater trials over the \\"Dirty Politics\\" booklet) is imminent from Justice M. Palmer (as at 12 March 2020). =2020 Litigation= The verdict in the Stringer v Craig & Others 2015 litigation (heard Sept 2019) was delivered by Justice Palmer, 3 April 2020 [Civ2015-4042524 [2020] NZHC 644]. https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/pdf/jdo/61/alfresco/service/api/node/content/workspace/SpacesStore/12fea959-37e2-4829-b910-6d7de249c8f5/12fea959-37e2-4829-b910-6d7de249c8f5.pdf The court delivered a verdict identical to the Craig v Slater trial regarding defamation in the booklet ‚ÄúDirty Politics & Hidden Agendas.‚Äù In the Stringer verdict, the judge ruled Mr Stringer had been defamed multiple times by C. and H. Craig, as well as by party officials/members A. Storr, K. Stitt and S. Taylor, but that they were all covered by a qualified privilege defence, and the case was therefore dismissed. No damages or costs were awarded in the verdict. The court also ruled, that (a) Mr Stringer was a member of the ‚ÄúDirty Politics Brigade‚Äù but ‚Äú(d) to elevate that to a conspiracy requires hard facts, not inferences, and Mr Craig‚Äôs case for Mr Stringer‚Äôs collusion with Whale Oil is a mirage.‚Äù Judgment No. 3 of Palmer J., Civ2015-4042524 [2020] NZHC 644, 3 April 2020, [100d]  References   External links  * Vote Colin Craig campaign website * Conservative Party Category:Living people Category:People from Auckland Category:New Zealand businesspeople Category:New Conservative Party (New Zealand) politicians Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 2011 New Zealand general election Category:1968 births Category:New Zealand Baptists Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:Massey University alumni Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 2014 New Zealand general election ","title":"Colin Craig"},{"id":"33081997","text":"Black Heart may refer to: * Uranothauma nubifer, an African butterfly also known as \\"black heart\\" Arts and entertainment =Books= * Black Heart (novel), a 2011 book by Holly Black * Black Heart, a 1983 novel by Eric Van Lustbader =Music= * Black Heart (Stooshe song), 2012 * Black Heart (Stone Temple Pilots song), 2013 * \\"Black Heart\\", a song from the deluxe edition of Emotion (Carly Rae Jepsen album) * Black Heart (album), a 2009 album by Kish Mauve See also * Blackheart (disambiguation) * ","title":"Black Heart"},{"id":"33081998","text":"Caroline Wozniacki was the defending champion, but lost to Kaia Kanepi in the third round.

C. Thomas by which Sheikh Abdullah and others were arrested and jailed. Abdullah along with Mirza Afzal Beg and 22 others, who were accused of conspiracy against the state for allegedly espousing the cause of an independent Kashmir. The case was framed in 1958, for which trial begun in 1959 was withdrawn in 1964 as a diplomatic decision.The activities of the Plebiscite Front eventually led to the institution of the ‚ÄòKashmir Conspiracy Case‚Äô in 1958 and two other cases Having put Abdullah behind bars on 8 August in \\"Kashmir conspiracy case\\"Sheikh Sahib was charged with treason and conspiracy against the state and the infamous \\"Kashmir Conspiracy Case\\" unfolded with the Lion of Kashmir spending the next eleven years behind bars. His closest comrades including Mirza Afzal Beg, and 22 other NC loyalists were sent to jail as well by Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad.The Kashmir conspiracy case History of Case On 8 August 1953 Sheikh Abdullah was dismissed as Prime Minister by the then Sadr-i-Riyasat (Constitutional Head of State) Dr. Karan Singh son of the erstwhile Maharajah Hari Singh on the charge that he had lost the confidence of his cabinetSheikh Abdullah; M.Y.Taing (1985), p593-594 He was denied the opportunity to prove his majority on the floor of the house,Sheikh Abdullah; M.Y.Taing (1985), p607 and Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed was appointed as Prime Minister. He was arrested soon after in year 1953 for anti-national activities.Sheikh Abdullah; M.Y.Taing (1985), p600 Following the overthrow of Sheikh Abdullah, his lieutenant Mirza Afzal Beg formed the Plebiscite Front on 9 August 1955 to fight for the plebiscite demand and the unconditional release of Sheikh Abdullah who had been arrested after his removal. Abdullah meanwhile was released for a short time and later again re-arrested for the activities of the Plebiscite Front eventually led to the institution of the Kashmir Conspiracy Case in 1958 and two other cases. Sheikh Abdullah was immediately arrested and later jailed again thus spending almost eleven years, accused of conspiracy against the State in the infamous \\"Kashmir Conspiracy Case\\".Sheikh Abdullah; M.Y.Taing (1985), p711-717 Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, who was installed as Prime Minister of Jammu & Kashmir, said in his radio broadcast that :- Before his dismissal, arrest, brief release and re-arrest under the case, the intelligence agency had collected ample proof regarding the Sheikh's links with Pakistan and of his speeches and activities to these affect, after which Bakshi rearrested Sheikh Abdullah. The entire matter relating to the alleged conspiracy of the Sheikh for joining hands with Pakistan was submitted to Nehru along with documentary evidence and recorded tapes of his public speeches. Jawaharlal Nehru was taken aback while listening to the tapes and going through the letters of Sheikh Abdullah. He approved launching of a case against the Sheikh, his one time very close friend. Thus, the Kashmir conspiracy case was launched against Sheikh Abdullah, Mirza Afzal Beg and 22 other people on charge of having conspired with Pakistan for making of an independent Kashmir. The counsel of Government, between 9 August 1952 and 29 April 1958, in his several briefs before the court, stated that the accused and their accomplices both inside and outside the state collaborated with Pakistani officials to overthrow the Government with violence. Their intention was to overthrow the Government and to annex the state with Pakistan through the process to spread hatred in the masses against the Government. The court was shown that, while Sheikh Abdullah was in jail his wife Begum Akbar Jahan Abdullah and allies, Mirza Afzal Beg, Ghulam Mohammad Chikan, Mir Ghulam Rasool, Pir Maqbool Gilani, Khwaja Ali Shah and others, received large amount of money from Pakistan for this purpose. They also received type-writers and litho-machines and literature for propaganda purposes. Besides explosives were received from Pakistan for blowing up bridges, factories, military installations, mosques, temples and Gurudwaras in Jammu & Kashmir, so that the Government machinery may be paralyzed. People were trained in Pakistan to come and create havoc here. Link, Volume 6, Issues 26-52, 1964 The trials began in 1959 and were heard over several years, when in 1962 the special Magistrate, transferred the case to higher court that all the accused be tried under Indian Penal Code, under sections for which punishment was either death or life-imprisonment. But certain later developments like Hazratbal disappearance episode in Kashmir, lead to Nehru's decision to drop the case. Sheikh Abdullah spent almost eleven years behind bars from 1953 till 1964 (six years after being accused under the case), while others were held from 1958 till 1964. In 1964, when whole nation was eagerly awaiting the outcome of the case and the judgement of the court, the case was withdrawn and all the accused were released as a part of controversial and sudden diplomatic decision taken by Jawaharlal Nehru, the erstwhile Prime Minister of India and Ghulam Mohammed Sadiq, the erstwhile Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir.

On 11 December 2016, the Haard-Bahn was renamed the Niers-Haard-Express (RE 42) and extended to Duisburg, Krefeld and M√∂nchengladbach. Since December 2019, the additional trains in the peak hour between Haltern am See and Essen have been replaced by a service every 30 minutes between M√ºnster and Essen. History  The Rhein- Haard-Express operated from 1998 to 2002 as the Haard-Express only between M√ºnster and Essen. From the timetable change in December 2002, it ran via Duisburg to M√∂nchengladbach, taking over the Duisburg‚ÄìM√∂nchengladbach section from the Rhein-Emscher-Express (RE 3), which ran to D√ºsseldorf instead. With the timetable change on 12 December 2010 there was another exchange of routes with the Duisburg‚ÄìM√∂nchengladbach section operated by the Rhein-Hellweg- Express (RE 11), which now runs hourly between Hamm and M√∂nchengladbach. In return the Rhein-Haard-Express took over the Duisburg‚ÄìD√ºsseldorf section and also operates as an hourly service. In this section, there are normally five Regional-Express services per hour (RE 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6), and four Regional- Express trains per hour on the Essen-Duisburg section (RE 1, 2, 6 and 11). Since the timetable change on 12 December 2010, the Rhein-Haard-Express trains have operated with five instead of four carriages. After an EU-wide tender, DB Regio NRW contract to operate the service has been extended from December 2014 to December 2029. With the timetable change in December 2016, there was a further change in the route of the service. The RE 11 service returned to its former route between Duisburg and D√ºsseldorf. The section of the RE 2's former route between Essen to M√∂nchengladbach, was not resumed by the Rhein-Haardt- Express. Instead, the Haard-Bahn (RB 42), which previously ran between M√ºnster and Essen on the same route as the Rhein-Haardt-Express, was extended to M√∂nchengladbach and renamed the Rhein-Haard-Express (RE 42). This reflects the fact that the train does not stop at every station between Duisburg and M√∂nchengladbach, unlike the parallel Rhein-Niers-Bahn (RB 33) and Emscher- Niederrhein-Bahn (RB 35), so it was considered appropriate to designate it as an \\"express\\". At the timetable change in December 2019, the Rhein-Haard- Express on the M√ºnster‚ÄìEssen section was accelerated by skipping stops and extended to the Lower Saxony regional centre of Osnabr√ºck. At the same time, the Niers-Haard-Express began operating at half-hourly intervals on this section, stopping at all intermediate stations. Route The Rhein-Haard- Express runs daily every hour and utilises five railway lines: *The Wanne- Eickel‚ÄìHamburg railway between Osnabr√ºck and Wanne-Eickel (which is also used by various Intercity services and Regional-Express service RE 42), *The Duisburg‚ÄìDortmund railway between Wanne-Eickel and Gelsenkirchen (shared with a variety of traffic and without intervening stations), *The whole of the Essen‚ÄìGelsenkirchen railway (shared with RE 42 and Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn line S 2) *The Dortmund‚ÄìDuisburg line between Essen and Duisburg (on the long-distance tracks, which is used by all types of regional and long distance traffic), *The Cologne‚ÄìDuisburg railway between Duisburg and D√ºsseldorf. In this four to six track section the Rhein-Haard-Express uses the S-Bahn tracks or the so- called \\"local\\" tracks where they exist, along with the Rhein-Emscher-Express (RE 3), Rhein-Weser-Express (RE 6), Rhein-Hellweg-Express (RE 11) and the Rhein-IJssel-Express (RE 19). Only the NRW-Express (RE 1) and the Rhein- Express (RE 5) use the long-distance tracks. Rail services The Rhein- Haard-Express runs every hour and stops between Wanne-Eickel and M√ºnster only in Recklinghausen Hbf, Haltern am See and D√ºlmen, vur stopping at every stop north of M√ºnster. It runs on a long section parallel to S-Bahn lines and from M√ºnster to Duisburg it runs on the same route as the Niers-Haard-Express (RE 42). The RE 2 is operated by DB Regio AG, using push-pull trains of five double-deck carriages hauled by class 146 electric locomotives at speeds of up to 160 km/h. The RE 42 is operated with class 1428 (Stadler FLIRT) sets, which are slower that the RE 2 trains but have better acceleration. As a result, the Rhein-Haard-Express takes two minutes longer between Essen and M√ºnster than the Niers-Haard-Express. The average speed is 71 km/h. In the evening or at night, when the RE 42 no longer runs, the Rhein-Haard-Express stops at all stations between Essen and M√ºnster. The Rhein-Haard-Express was the last RE line in North Rhine-Westphalia that still featured a so-called ZugCaf√© (dining car). In recent years, this bistro was only open during the peak hour from Monday to Friday. With the new contract awarded to DB Regio AG for the operation of the service from 14 December 2014, continued operation of the bistro was omitted. The sets have been converted for the Rhein-Haard-Express, so that the first class seating is now be located in the control car. This is where step-free access and a toilet for the disabled is located, along with bicycle parking spaces. The control car heads the trains running towards D√ºsseldorf, while the locomotive leads towards M√ºnster. Barrier-free entry and exit is not always possible because some stations have a platform height of only 38 centimetres above the rail. The Rhein-Haard-Express connects in Munster, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Duisburg and D√ºsseldorf with other transport services. In addition, it has direct connections with long-distance rail services in Duisburg and M√ºnster. Two North Rhine-Westphalian municipal transport associations, the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (\\"Rhine-Ruhr Transport Association\\", VRR) and the Zweckverband SPNV M√ºnsterland (\\"M√ºnsterland rail transport association\\", ZVM) are involved in the operation of the service. After a call for tenders from European companies to operate the Rhein-Haard- Express and the Haard-Bahn, the contract for operating both lines was awarded in 2001 for the period from 2004 to 2014 to DB Regio NRW.

ERM builds upon release management and combines it with other aspects of IT management including Business-IT alignment, IT service management, IT Governance, and Configuration management. ERM places considerable emphasis on project management and IT portfolio management supporting the orchestration of people, process, and technology across multiple departments and application development teams to deliver large, highly integrated software changes within the context of an IT portfolio.  Managing Multiple Releases  Just as traditional release management packages changes together for execution and delivery, so an enterprise release is a mechanism for integrating and managing multiple, independent programs and projects that impact the enterprise. ERM takes an end-to-end life cycle perspective addressing the (strategic) planning, execution and delivery of an organization‚Äôs entire change portfolio, even though in reality it is often confined to the latter integration, test and implementation stages of delivery. An enterprise release consolidates and integrates the deliverables of multiple projects (or more generally, change initiatives) that have to be time-boxed or synchronised so they can be tested and released as a whole. By stressing the need for a cohesive release architecture, ERM aims to supplement portfolio prioritization with greater design governance that serves to improve productivity and reduce change disruption by executing related features together. While traditional release management addresses fine-grained changes and provides technical support for the project, ERM supports enterprise portfolio/project management (PPM) and brings a pragmatic architectural and execution perspective to the selection and planning to an enterprise release.  Influence of Continuous Delivery and DevOps  Organizations practicing Enterprise Release Management often support software projects across a wide spectrum of software development methodology. An IT portfolio often incorporates more traditional Waterfall model projects alongside more iterative projects using Agile software development. With the increasing popularity of agile development a new approach to software releases known as Continuous delivery is starting to influence how software transitions from development to release. With continuous delivery, transitions from development to release are continuously automated. Changes are committed to code repositories, builds and tests are run immediately in a continuous integration system, and changes can be released to production without the ceremony that accompanies the traditional Software release life cycle. While continuous delivery and agile software development provide for faster execution on a project level, the accelerated pace made possible by continuous delivery creates challenges for less-agile components in an IT portfolio. ERM provides organizations with a comprehensive view of software change across a large collection of related systems allowing project managers and IT managers to coordinate projects that have adopted more continuous approaches to software delivery with projects that require a slower, more sequential approach for application development. Enterprise Release Management provides enterprises with a model that can adopt the localized effects of both DevOps and Continuous delivery to the larger IT department.  References  * Taborda, L.J.

Biography  = Childhood and youth = Vlastimil Ko≈°vanec son of Bed≈ôich Ko≈°vanec, a glover, and Helena Ko≈°vancov√†, a dressmaker, was born in Karl√≠n on December 14, 1887. He was baptized under the name of Emil Vlastimil in the Roman Catholic church on December 27 of the same year. The family also included brothers Jarom√≠r, Bla≈æen and Bed≈ôich. After elementary school he attended the Imperial Royal Lyceum and graduated. After high school he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts at the Professor Vlaho Bukovac's school. In this period his father died and the industrialist Antonin Pick from Sm√≠chov became his stepfather. Later he studied with Professor Vojtech Hynais, experimenting with techniques of drawing and painting. At the Academy, Ko≈°vanec received awards as the best student of the year several times. In 1909 he participated in a contest and received a scholarship by Hlavka foundation, one of the most desirable. The artist moved between many pictorial styles: Realism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and Symbolism. During this time he lived in Prague Hole≈°ovice district, in Nad ≈†tolou, near the Academy. After academic studies, he traveled abroad until 1939 in Italy, France, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Albania, Yugoslavia and Montenegro. = Magazines and illustrations = When he was twenty-eight (in 1916), he was chosen as substitute teacher at the Royal Lyceum of Kol√≠n, 50 km east from Prague. Teaching lasted until the half of the school year 1916/1917. In February 1917 young Ko≈°vanec resigned but we don't know the official reasons for this act. The Czechoslovak Republic was born, on October 28, 1918, after the end of the First World War. The political situation was divided between the Communist Party and the Nationalists. Ko≈°vanec began his collaboration with the magazines Koprivy (a satirical publication printed by the Social Democratic Party from 1909 until 1931) and Sr≈°atec (a satirical magazine published by the Communist Party during the Twenties). He probably used at least three pseudonyms to remain anonymous and to protect his safety: V. Havrda, V. Patrik and Karambol. In 1920 he drew the illustrations of the book Three men with the shark and Other Stories(T≈ôi mu≈æi se ≈æralokem a jin√© pouƒçn√© historky) written by Jaroslav Ha≈°ek, writer, activist of the Anarchist Party, and author of the famous novel The Good Soldier ≈†vejk (Osudy dobr√©ho voj√°ka ≈†vejka). A year later, in a booklet called Sovetsk Rusi, illustrations made by Ko≈°vanec appeared with those from two Avant-garde artists: Vaclav Sp√°la and Karel Teige. The boh√©mien painter probably visited Picasso exhibition in 1921 and the 19th and 20th century French art exposition of the 1923. In 1922 each page of the booklet for children To the children of workers (Dƒõlnick√Ωm dƒõtem) was composed of illustrations and two versed notes by Ko≈°vanec. The painter was asked to draw two of the four volumes of Les Miserables by Victor Hugo Czech version, and this work became his masterpiece in 1923; the other two volumes were illustrated by graphic artist and painter V√°clav Cutta. In the same year the artist illustrated the book The fascists of B. G. Sandomirsky; a portrait of Benito Mussolini appeared among the represented images. During the 1920s Ko≈°vanec increased its prestige, and in the meantime he married the painter Franti≈°ka Matou≈°kova, which painted under the pseudonym Sidonie Matou≈°kov√°- Ko≈°vancov√° later. The artist, while cooperating with satirical magazines, worked for the left-wing newspaper Pr√°vo Lidu, later called Rud√© Pr√°vo. The caricatures, which accompanied the articles of Antonin Macek, were republished in 1958 in a book titled Kuk√°tka (Binoculars). The Czechoslovak Republic, was a bilingual country until 1945, and the German paper Prager Presse was published there from 1921 to 1938: on its pages Ko≈°vanec issued his satirical cartoons. The cover of the book of Ivan Suk Little girls under the lantern (Holƒçiƒçky pod lucernou, 1926) was illustrated with an impressive drawing, that expresses the light and the shade of the human and social complexity of the prostitutes' world. Ko≈°vanec was an active member of the left-wing group called Umƒõleck√° Beseda (founded in 1863) in 1929. It was an intellectual elite which included figurative artists, musicians, philosophers and writers. The group was particularly animated, and it organized events and exhibitions of artists not only in Prague. It promoted international initiatives dedicated to artists like Carlo Carr√† (1929), Giorgio de Chirico (1931) and even the √âcole de Paris event of the same year. During this period Ko≈°vanec exhibited not only in galleries in Prague, but in the whole Czechoslovakian country. = Portraiture = Ko≈°vanec was considered one of the finest portraitist, appreciated both for his technique and his unique style. He imposed a taste and generated a style, to which the Prague upper classes aspired. The rich bourgeois, the aristocracy, the elite, the businessmen, the intellectual and the illustrious men wanted a portrait to be immortalized. This privileged relation enabled the artist to paint portraits of the most important characters of the First Republic such as the President Edvard Bene≈°, democratic statesman and politician during the transition period between the end of Habsburg Empire (1918) and the Communist takeover of February 1948. Ko≈°vanec studio was located in Prague XII, in the district of Kr√°lovsky. In addition to portraits of celebrities, in these years the artist tried out figurative compositions set in bucolic, allegorical, mythical settings, putting emphasis on color, light and joie de vivre. Nature became one thing with female figures, and mythologized women were identified with nymphs or represented as a goddess. After many exhibitions from 1926 to 1937, a highly successful personal exhibition was held in Prague in November 1939. Mr. Oscar Kokoschka, who lived in Prague from 1934 to 1938, played an important role in these events. Ko≈°vanec's paintings were more \\"praguese\\" at that moment: women appeared elegant, stylish, half-naked, surrounded by a flowering nature over the hills of Petrin, \\"in the greenish shade of wide gardens and leafy trees\\" in the quiet Hradcany, and these nymphs revealed the secret charm of Mal√° Strana and of St. Nicholas Church. = The War = After the arrival of the Nazi troops in Prague, on March 15, 1939, the German protectorate began to enact a series of anti-Jewish measures. The extermination of Jewish people started then, and Czech Resistance was violently repressed. Ko≈°vanec gave his fur coat to German soldiers on the public square, during a fundraising for the German troops in Stalingrad in winter 1942‚Äì1943, when the Second World War broke out. This theatrical gesture, which was judged to be outrageous, caused a collaborationism accuse and the immediate expulsion from the Association of Czech artists (Blok cesk√Ωch v√Ωtvarn√≠ku) once the war finished. In 1947 Ko≈°vanec was put on trial. The artist was convicted, imprisoned and forced to pay a fine of 40,000 CZK. On September 29, 1949 his wife died, he fell into a deep depression]and suffered a total nervous breakdown that forced him to stay in a mental hospital. It seems that he was freed, thanks to the remission of the rest of the sentence, between 1949 and 1950. = Death = Vlastimil Ko≈°vanec painted illegally during the 1950s. The artist fell in love with a young Gypsy woman. He spent his last years in complete isolation until November 1961 when, at the age of 74, died forgotten by everybody and his body was buried in the cemetery of Ol≈°any in Prague.

Plot Four young offenders ‚Äì Tim, Sam, Dwight, Zeb ‚Äì and their caretakers ‚Äì Kate and Jeff ‚Äì travel to a Yorkshire village called Mortlake to do community service, staying in a little cottage. On their first day they decide to have a drink at the local pub where they meet Jim, the bartender. The next day they go salvage abandoned trains where Tim and Sam are attacked by three inbreds. Jeff tries to scare them away but falls on a metal shard, cutting open his femoral artery. They go back to the pub to get help, but Jim chops Jeff's head off with a cleaver and traps the others in the cellar. The inbreds take Zeb away and pin him to the ground in a barn. It turns out he's being used for a show for the Mortlakers. Zeb is then taunted and tortured by having asparagus stuck up his nose. They bring in a horse and have it walk around Zeb while the others pick the lock off the cellar door and escape. The horse then crushes Zeb's head, killing him. The others escape while Dwight attempts to defend them, but Dwight is unsuccessful and gets recaptured and used for another show. Dwight gets tied to a chair and has fecal matter pumped inside his body, popping his eyes out and blowing up his stomach. The others run back to the cottage in an attempt to find a map with directions, as well as their cellphones, which Jeff had confiscated and hid. Kate goes to check the shed but when she opens the door, Jim is standing there with a weapon and a group of inbreds. She locks the door but he shoots the lock and her fingers off. Later, Kate runs outside to distract them in an attempt to save Tim and Sam. She tries to run away but steps on a mantrap. One of the inbreds then amputates her leg with a chainsaw. She tries to crawl away but Jim shoots her dead. Tim checks the basement and finds a load of booze. He then lures the inbreds down into the basement while Sam runs away. They find Tim holding a molotov cocktail. He tries to light it but Jim tells him that the alcohol isn't strong enough to burn and the inbreds kill him. When they find Sam running away outside, they bet on how she'll die. She steps on a landmine and tries not to move, but a ferret crawls up her leg, so she is blown up. The film ends with the inbreds walking back to the pub for a pint. Cast Production Inbred was mainly shot in, and around Thirsk in North Yorkshire because co-writer Paul Shrimpton lives there. Locals did object to the film, leading to local councilor and mayor Derek Adamson to say, \\"We don't want that sort of publicity. ... It‚Äôs quite probable that people will think the characters in the film are like real Thirsk people and that is not a good impression.\\" He also expressed concerns based on Chandon's earlier movies: \\"If it‚Äôs anything like his previous work then I don't think he will be really welcome here\\". However, Chandon says Adamson's opinions changed later on: \\"Once he learned it was a comedy he got on board, but his little quote got us so much publicity worldwide. He was integral to the whole Inbred machine.\\" The bulk of the special effects were done physically with some CGI for things that were difficult to replicate. The company in charge of the production arrangements was Split Second Films.Split Second Films Release The film did the rounds of festivals, premi√®ring at FrightFest in August 2011, before going on general release around Britain in September 2012. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK in October 2012. XLrator Media released it on video-on-demand 22 August 2013 and on DVD 24 September 2013. Reception The Bay Horse in Rainton, used as The Dirty Hole The reviews from professional critics has been largely negative. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 18% of 11 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review. The Daily Telegraphs review was: \\"Patience-sappingly foul British horror film in which a brood of ravening yokels torment inner-city teens on a weekend retreat.\\" Mike McCahill reviewed the film for The Guardian and said that \\"both the comedy and horror rake over old ground. The warped variety show the kids stumble into ... owes too much to Python, The League of Gentlemen and Channel 4's late-night gem Focus North\\". Total Film concluded \\"All-out gore is the USP, but it‚Äôs served with such pernicious cynicism (is casting people with genuine disabilities as freaks OK?) and terrible dialogue ... only the persistent will stick around to count all The League Of Gentlemen steals.\\" The Radio Times flagged up \\"weaknesses in pacing, plot and characterisation\\" but, thanks to the enthusiastic acting and gory special effects, \\"[t]hese crowd- pleasing elements distract from a multitude of sins\\". However, other reviewers enjoyed the film. Ain't It Cool News picked it as one of their favourite horror films of the year with the recommendation that \\"[n]o self respecting gorehound should miss INBRED.\\" Diabolique magazine wrote that Inbred \\"offers viewers a genuinely weird and creepy story about redemption that benefits greatly from exceptional casting, spooky locations, and gruesome special makeup effects\\". Twitch Film concluded, \\"Awfully mean-spirited and often sickeningly gory, I would normally never recommend the likes of \\"Inbred\\". But the technical virtues of filmmaking on display here, coupled with a roster of well-played incredible characters, go far in redeeming the film. So if you have the stomach for it I do urge you to check this out.\\" Sky Movies recommended it saying \\"there's a joyous celebration of the depraved\\" and \\"unlike a lot of low-budget horror schlock, there's a decent cast delivering wry-if-cartoonish dialogue.\\" Dread Central warned that a potential viewer should not \\"go into Inbred looking for a genuinely horrific, or even particularly thrilling or tense, piece of work ‚Äì you won't find that here. What you will find, though, is an amusing (if you‚Äôre an appreciator of dark/broad humour), deliciously gory, occasionally shocking and decidedly vicious little film.\\" Paul Mount of Starburst declared that \\"Inbred may well be the grossest, sickest horror movie this reviewer has ever laid eyes on\\" and drew parallels with \\"The League of Gentlemen dialed up to eleven and mix in a bit of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Straw Dogs and maybe The Hills Have Eyes\\", concluding \\"this is pitch-black stuff and its humour is as dark as night - and as such it does what it sets out to do and is a triumph of its type.\\" Despite the possibly disrespectful take on its home county, The Yorkshire Post said the film \\"combines gruesome shocks with genuine humour\\", suggests it is \\"[f]rom the same genre as Simon Sprackling's deliriously demented Funny Man\\" and ends up by stating that Inbred \\"has to be seen to be believed... it proves that classic British horror is alive and twitching.\\" References External links Category:2011 films Category:2011 horror films Category:2010s exploitation films Category:2010s serial killer films Category:British exploitation films Category:British films Category:British horror films Category:British slasher films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Yorkshire Category:Films shot in Yorkshire Category:German films Category:German horror films Category:Splatter films Category:Films directed by Alex Chandon ","title":"Inbred (film)"},{"id":"33082428","title":"Molly Smitten-Downes"},{"id":"33082430","text":"The Citt√† della Scienza (\\"city of science\\") is a museum in Naples, in Campania in southern Italy.

He attended Blackburn High School known for its music. Biography Born to a classical soprano mother, and a folk loving father, Irwin was raised in the Dandenong Ranges in Victoria. Irwin's musical life was born at home. At age 9, he was welcomed into a Brady Bunch-esque step-family of brass players, pianists and conductors. Learning from his brother-in-law, Irwin showed early talent as an instrumentalist, and very quickly developed as a jazz trumpet player. Influenced by the greats like Miles Davis, Clifford Brown and Louis Armstrong. At age 15, Irwin was already working professionally as a jazz and commercial trumpeter, playing pubs, restaurants and clubs in his hometown Melbourne. Since those early days, Irwin has never looked back. Aside from his solo career, he has ended up working as a multi-instrumentalist and sideman with artists like Megan Washington, Brooke Fraser, Magnolia and Tinpan Orange. His involvement with seminal Australian bands The Cat Empire and The Bamboos, to his highly ambitious compositions and arrangements that have been performed by countless big bands and orchestras have cemented him in the Australian music industry. Most recently he has also added co-writer, arranger and producer credits to this list, for bands and artists like Lanu, Felix Riebl, The Cat Empire, and The Bamboos. Solo Project Having suffered a clean break of heart in 2009, Irwin retreated to the Canada mountain town of Nelson. After three weeks of late autumn cold, Irwin returned with a pocket full of songs, and soon after recorded 'The Hunting Road', with producer John Castle (The Bamboos, Megan Washington) at The Shed studio in Melbourne. His debut album,\\"The Hunting Road\\" was released through Vitamin Records on 5 September 2011. Irwin then went on to independently release his first EP 'Wasted' in 2013, again with producer John Castle. This time however it was recorded at the newly built Pick and Mix Studios in the Dandenong ranges with musician and producer Ben Edgar. The artwork for this release was created by Melbourne digital artist Kate Moon, the two collaborated and created a world of imagery inspired by his appreciation for the work of writers such as Kazuo Koike and Haruki Murakami. This art work is to be featured in the next 2 of Irwin's releases. He has toured the Australia playing his own solo shows and in support of some of Australia's great musical success stories such as Vance Joy, Ella Hooper, and Julia Stone.

Biography Walls was born in 1928 in New Milton, England. He studied theology at Exeter College, Oxford, receiving a first-class degree in 1948, and completed his graduate studies in the early Church in 1956 under the patristics scholar Frank Leslie Cross. He taught at Fourah Bay College, Sierra Leone (1957‚Äì62) and the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (1962‚Äì65). He was later appointed to a post in ecclesiastical history in the University of Aberdeen in 1966, before being the first head of the Department of Religious studies in the University of Aberdeen (1970). He would subsequently move to the University of Edinburgh in 1986. He is currently Professor of the History of Mission at Liverpool Hope University, Honorary Professor at the University of Edinburgh, Research Professor at Africa International University's Center for World Christianity, and Professor Emeritus at the Akrofi-Christaller Institute of Theology, Mission and Culture. Walls established the Journal of Religion in Africa in 1967 and Studies in World Christianity in 1995. He also founded the Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non-Western World (now known as the Centre for the Study of World Christianity), first at the University of Aberdeen in 1982, before moving it to the University of Edinburgh in 1987, a year after he moved to Edinburgh. With his late wife Doreen Harden, whom he married in 1953, they have two children, Christine and Andrew. After Doreen's death, he married Ingrid Reneau in 2012, a Research Fellow with the Presbyterian Mission Agency. On 26 November 2018, Walls received an honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from the University of Edinburgh in recognition of his scholarly contributions to the study of Christianity in Africa and the non-Western world. World Christianity Walls' most significant observations have concerned the geographical trends in Christianity in the 20th and 21st centuries, especially in terms of expansion in Africa, in what is generally termed World Christianity. Historian Lamin Sanneh commented that he was 'one of the few scholars who saw that African Christianity was not just an exotic, curious phenomenon in an obscure part of the world, but that African Christianity might be the shape of things to come'. His pioneering research led the magazine Christianity Today to describe him in 2007 as 'a historian ahead of his time' and 'the most important person you don't know'. Liverpool Hope University has a research centre named in honour of him, which encourages and supports research in the field of African and Asian Christianity. Religious studies Although he is more well known for his work in Christianity, Walls has also been a significant pioneer in shaping the field of religious studies as it is taught in universities of Scotland. When he first returned to Scotland, Walls taught Ecclesiastical History in the University of Aberdeen in 1966. However, he recognised that the Faculty of Divinity in Aberdeen did not allow for a sufficient global perspective of religion, and founded the Department of Religious studies outside the Faculty of Divinity in 1970. Significantly, Walls' work in Aberdeen would establish the first department of Religious Studies in Scotland. In the mid-1970s, the department would be known for emphasising work in the study of what was then called 'primal religions'. Moreover, his vision for a global perspective of religion allowed for Walls to attract a number of significant members of staff and students who were interested in religions of the non-Western world. It would also be in this new department that the original Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non- Western World was established, before eventually being relocated to the University of Edinburgh in 1987. It has been known as the Centre for the Study of World Christianity since 2009.

It also serves as the administrative center of Kichmengsky Selsoviet, one of the seventeen selsoviets into which the district is administratively divided. Municipally, it is the administrative center of Kichmengskoye Rural Settlement. Population: History Kichmengsky Gorodok is first mentioned in chronicles in 1468. At that time, the fortress of Kichmengsky Gorodok was dependent on Veliky Ustyug, and Tatars took it and set it to fire, together with all its population. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great the area was included into Archangelgorod Governorate. From 1719, Kichmengsky Gorodok was in Ustyug Province, one of the four provinces of Archangelgorod Governorate. In 1780, the governorate was abolished, and transformed into Vologda Viceroyalty. The latter was abolished in 1796, and Kichmengsky Gorodok became the center of Kichmengskaya Volost of Nikolsky Uyezd of Vologda Governorate. In 1918, the area was transferred to the newly established Northern Dvina Governorate with the administrative center located in Veliky Ustyug. In 1924 the uyezds were abolished in favor of the new divisions, the districts (raions). On June 10, 1924 Kichmengsko- Gorodetsky District was established, with the administrative center in Kichmengsky Gorodok. Economy The economy of Kichmengsky Gorodok is based on the timber industry and food industry. Kichmengsky Gorodok is located on the paved road which connects Kotlas and Veliky Ustyug in the north and Nikolsk and Manturovo to the south.

Lunna House is noted for having \\"the best historic designed landscape in Shetland\\". In the 20th century it was used as a base of the wartime Shetland Bus operation. The house is protected as a category B listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. History Lunna House dates from before 1663 and was built on the site of a medieval haa (hall), which itself was built on the site of a viking longhouse. The east side of the house (on the right in the picture) was built in the 1660s for Robert Hunter (d.1695). Robert was Chamberlain of the Lordship of Zetland, and a Commissioner of Supply. The house was extended in 1710, 1750, 1810, 1850 and finally between 1897 and 1910, when the south, north and west- sections of this cross-shaped house were built. The house is mainly constructed from stone and lime mortar, except for the newest section (1897-1910) which was made out of early cast concrete. The house was \\"harled\\" (covered in early concrete and pebble cladding ) around 1910 to hide the join between the concrete and thick stone sections of the house. The stones for the original construction of the house are believed to have come from the ruins of an iron age broch; the remains of which lie behind the original stone gateway of the house, south of the building. An armorial panel on the house commemorates the 1707 marriage of his son Thomas Hunter and Grisella Bruce, around which time this part of the house was added. In 1753, nearby Lunna Kirk was built by Robert Hunter (1710‚Äì1777), 3rd laird. Lunna Kirk is the oldest working Kirk (church) in Shetland. The formal landscape around the house was laid out during the 18th century, and augmented in the 19th century with Gothic ornaments, such as the beach cobble finials of the gates to the south- west of the house. On the hilltop beyond the gates is a small folly, known as Hunter's Monument, which terminates the axis, and was formerly used as a lookout by the lairds. The harbour was also constructed in the 19th century, along with a walled garden and a lime kiln. In 1845 Robina Hunter inherited the property. The following year she married Robert Bell, Sheriff at Lerwick, and a son of the surgeon Joseph Bell. Their son Robert Bell Hunter, 8th Laird of Lunna, sold the property in 1893 to John Bruce of Sumburgh. Bruce had the house extended in the 20th century. During the Second World War, Lunna House was requisitioned by the UK War Office and became one of the bases of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). Following the invasion of Norway in May 1940, the house became the original base for the Shetland Bus, a clandestine operation to transfer men and materials between Shetland and Nazi-occupied Norway. The sheltered harbour at Lunna, away from populated areas, was considered ideal. Lieutenant David Howarth set up the SOE base at Lunna House, which accommodated the Shetland Bus boat crews. The Shetland Bus operation moved to Scalloway in 1942, but the SOE base remained until the end of the war. The beaches below the house were used for testing one-man submarines and other equipment, as part of the SOE activities. By the end of the war, the house was in a poor condition. It was bought in the 1960s by the Lindsay family who rescued it from dereliction. Mains electricity reached the house in 1975. The Lindsays ran Lunna House as a B&B; from the mid 1960s until 1997, when Mrs Ruby Lindsay retired, aged 89. The house was listed in 1971, and in 1998 the Folly, West Gates, Gothick Cottage, and Walled Garden were also listed at category B, as integral parts of the designed landscape, and with a group value of category A. Since 2001, the property has been owned by a family with wartime links to the SOE, and it has undergone further extensive renovations; repairing and replacing much of the sections of the slate roof, and internally repairing and restoring the fabric of the building.

Modern equipment of Sputnik allows to process almost all coal extracted in mine Zarechnaya. The plant was originally built with a production capacity of 2.4 million tons of coal a year. After the modernization in 2008, which was held without cessation of the enrichment process, the efficiency of the complex reached 5 million tons of coal a year. In 2011 the production capacity was increased up to 6 million tons. The plant processes the coal of the mines Zarechnaya and Oktyabrskaya as well as of the third parties. =Mine Oktyabrskaya= Mine Oktyabrskaya (ex-Polysaevskaya-2) was put into operation in 1956 with estimated capacity of 1.2 million tons per year. In 2010 Oktyabrskaya was purchased by Coal Company Zarechnaya. The reserves account to 158.5 million tons of thermal coal. At the moment the modernization of purification and tunneling equipment is in progress. It is planned to increase the volume of coal production output gradually since 2012, reaching the production capacity of 4 million tons of coal by 2014. In 2011 mine site Oktyabrsky produced 2.5 million tons of coal. Within 9 months of 2012 mine site Oktyabrsky has produced 1.913 million tons of coal, which exceeds the results of the same period of last year by 160 thousand tons. The drift miners have prepared 8087 m of shafts, having exceeded the previous year's results by 587 m. =Mine Aleksiyevskaya= Mine Aleksievskaya (ex- Leninskoye mine), put into operation in 1964, was purchased by Zarechnayain 2007. Mine reconstruction allowed it to avoid being shut down and became the reason for coal production increase. The production capacity of the mine is 619.7 million tons of flame coal. Coal production doubled in 2011 and reached the level of 2 million tons. Having got the license for prospection and mining on the mine-site Blagodatny of Egozovo-Krasnoyarsky coal field, Alexievskaya increased its production stock by 110 million tons of coal. According to the plan, the volume of production will reach 2.3 million tons in 2012, and by 2015 it will have grown up to 5 million tons. A new washing plant will be built in 2018. Within 9 months of 2012 mine Aleksievskaya has produced 1.480 mln. tons of coal. The drift-miners have prepared a record length of shafts - 9808 m, which is 145% as much as within the same period last year. =Mine Karagaylinskoye= Mine Karagaylinskoye The mine was purchased in 2006 and now is under construction, that takes place on subsoil area, once belonged to company Mine Karagaylinskaya, closed as a result of total coal industry restructuring in 1990s. Total reserves are 110.7 million tons of coking coal. Construction project of the mine implies the start of the mining in 2012 with output of 500 thousand tons, with a gradual growth to estimated capacity of 2 million tons in 2015. The construction plan also implies building a washing plan for coking coal. In August 2011 the open-pit coal production started on the mine site Karagaylinskoye. By the end of the year 102.2 thousand tons of coal had been extracted. The output level in 2012 has reached 195 thousand tons of coal. The underground mine is being under construction now, and the drift miners have prepared 3695 m of mines. The first longwall-face in scheduled for production at the end of 2013. =Mine Sibirskaya= Mine Sibirskaya was purchased in 2010. It is situated on the coal deposit of the ex-mine Kuznetskaya.

Da grande is one of the coming-of-age comedies that were released in the late 1980s. It has been said to be the inspiration for Big, the 1988 international blockbuster directed by Penny Marshall and starring Tom Hanks.  Plot  Eight-year-old Marco Marinelli is a bedwetter, scolded by his mother (Ottavia Piccolo) and teased by his classmates. On his birthday he finds out that his father (Alessandro Haber), who is facing economic difficulties, hasn't brought him the Lego he was promised. He runs in tears to his room and puts all his heart into wishing he were big and not subject to these indignities. As a result, he bursts through his clothes in the guise of a forty-year-old man (Renato Pozzetto) and seeks refuge in the house of his schoolteacher Francesca (Giulia Boschi), who he's secretly in love with. Mentally, he is still eight years old, and it's a puzzle what to do with him, until someone discovers that he has an uncanny rapport with children. Then he becomes a full-time and highly requested babysitter, but shortly after he is suspected of abducting the by- now long-missing child Marco. He then runs out of money, and fakes the kidnapping of himself, but while chased by the police he eventually turns back into the eight-year-old boy. He leaves a letter to Francesca who, upon realising the boy and man were one, uses the magic to join him as a little girl.

Completed in 1908 and designed by Martin Nyrop, who has designed Copenhagen City Hall, it was the largest church to be built by the Copenhagen Church Foundation. History Detail from one of Nyrop's renderings Elijah's Church is one of the many new churches built by the Copenhagen Church Foundation to accommodate the fast-growing population of the new districts of the city around the turn of the 20th century. When St. Matthew's was separated from Frederiksberg Parish in 1880, it had a population of 25,000 inhabitants but by the end of the century it had almost tripled to about 70,000. On 28 March 1898 the Church Foundation acquired the site on Vesterbro Torv, until then the site of a factory which produced timing belts, and Martin Nyrop was commissioned to design the new church. He had previously designed the new Copenhagen City Hall which was under construction at the old haymarket not far away. Construction costs were expected to amount to DKK 200,000 which were to be collected locally. Nyrop's proposal was published on 31 January 1900. The foundation stone was set on 8 April 1906, Palm Sunday, and the church was topped out on 16 December that same year. The church was consecrated on 17 May 1908. It was the fifth church to be built in Vesterbro and it remained the largest church ever built by the Church Foundation. The final construction costs amounted to DKK 317,050, including DKK 81,000 for the site, and the collection which had been raised in time for the inauguration. The church became a stronghold for the Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark in the capital. Architecture Location on the square The church is built to a Neo-Romanesque design and integrated in the row of houses on the square. The twin towers which dominate the west-facing fa√ßade towards the square are inspired by Tveje Merl√∏se and Fjenneslev Churches. Dressed in split sandstone laid in an irregular bond, the church has a rough facade which marked the beginning of a new era in Danish architecture. The portal in the main entrance The portal is split in two by a trumeau as is often seen in French romanesque churches. The tympanum depicts the Ascension of Elijah. The portal is flanked by angels singing and playing musical instruments. All the decorations are the work of Rasmus Harboe. A broad steep flight of stairs leads to the main entrance. It contains a shed which was put at the disposal of the municipal park authority for wheelbarrows and other tools and materials. When Nyrop's design was first published, the City made a demand for DKK 700 in rent for the area of the square taken up by the stairs. The shed was a compromise. The stairs are clad in the same split sandstone from Nex√∏ which covers the fa√ßade. It is decorated with carved sheaves. Interior Interior Elijah's Church is a three nave church with a barrel vaulted choir which is raised eight steps up from the nave. The interior walls are dressed in a light coloured sandstone and the lateral naves are separated from the central nave by arcades. There is a gallery in front of the three large windows which faces the square. To provide the church with additional natural light, despite the lack of external walls, the central nave has a raised central section with a pitched skylight along its full length. Furnishings The altarpiece is painted by Frans Schwartz. Cultural references The church is used as a location in the 1952 film Avismanden.

Only one genus in this family has been described, Ampullavirus, which contains one species, Acidianus bottle-shaped virus. The name of the family and genus is derived from the Latin word for bottle, ampulla, due to the virions having the shape of a bottle. The family was first described during an investigation of the microbial flora of hot springs in Italy. Structure and genome Ampullaviruses have unique morphology, with the virions being bottle-shaped with one narrow end that smoothly expands into a wider end for an overall length of about 230 nm and width of about 75 nm at the broad end. The narrow end projects beyond the viral envelope and is likely used to inject the viral DNA into host cells. The broad end possesses about 20 thin filaments, each that are regularly distributed in a ring. Inside the envelope is a funnel-shaped protein coat that houses the viral DNA. The genome of ampullaviruses is linear, double-stranded DNA that is about 23.8 kilobases in length. The genome contains an estimated 56 or 57 open reading frames that encode for at least six structural proteins. Life cycle Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by virus attaches to host cell. Dna templated transcription is the method of transcription. Bacteria of the archaeal genus Acidianus serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are passive diffusion.

She was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, and raised in Donkin, Nova Scotia. Jewells began playing basketball at the age of seven. In 2003, at the age of fourteen, she was severely injured in a car accident, breaking several ribs and her T12-L1 vertebrae, forcing her to spend close to two years in the hospital. Her occupational therapist suggested to her wheelchair basketball to help her recovery. She had to take some time off from 2007 to 2009 due to health and school, and didn't return until 2010. When she did come back, she ended up withdrawing from the Marconi Campus of Nova Scotia Community College in Sydney, so she could focus on her training. She has played basketball in every province of Canada, the United States, Osaka, Japan, and in Quakenbr√ºck, Germany. In May 2011 she played in Manchester, England. She played in the 2012 Paralympic Games in London, England, and in 2013, was awarded a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.

Biography Miri Nishri was born in Colombia in 1950. She immigrated to Israel with her family when she was seven years old. She studied construction engineering at Ort Technicum, and art at Hamidrasha College for Arts (today a part of Beit Berl College). Artistic career Nishri teaches art at the Tel Aviv Museum Workshops. She is the winner of the 1988 Oscar Handler Prize for artists and the 1996 Award of the Israeli Minister of Education & Culture. Her works range between painting, photography, video art and installations, and were shown in exhibitions in galleries, museums and festivals around the world, including: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel Museum, Haifa Museum of Art, Ramat Gan Museum of Israeli Art, \\"Lule√• Summer Biennale\\" (Sweden), \\"Olympolis Project\\" (Greece), \\"Human Emotions Festival\\" (Rome, Italy), \\"Stuttgarter Filmwinter\\" (Germany) and Stenersen Museum (Oslo, Norway). Her visual artworks are characterized by a strong sense of corporeality, and she tends to use coffee, among other materials, as paint. As she put it: \\"You could say that all my work is derived from the materials. I relate to physical materials no less than I do to literary materials, they are full of meanings and associations. For me, texture has always determined the subject. Her video-arts and installations usually deal with the construction, deconstruction and reconstruction of a self identity, while bringing up questions about the nature of the artist and art. The collage nature of her art, endlessly moving from one subject, identity or genre to another, expresses her torn identity as a fatherless immigrant, daughter of a traumatized Holocaust survivor. In her videos documentary materials are often merged with stage materials, and the boundaries between reality and fiction are often blurred. Selected installations *Blue Blue (1981) Nisri's first video art, constructed of two television sets running simultaneously, deals with the boundaries of the artistic medium within the screen. The work uses simply shaped elements, various repetitions and duplications, fake \\"malfunctions\\" of the video equipment as well as \\"quotations\\" from literature, philosophical theoriy and musical notes. Ha'ir's art critic Ronnie Sher wrote: \\"The video reminded me of Jean-Luc Godard's \\"Number Two\\" in structure and performance [‚Ä¶] The common grounds between Godard and modern Avant-garde is the basic artistic concept: dealing weith the world through self-reflection, making a movie about making a movie.Ronni Sher, \\"Peaceful co-existence\\", Ha'ir, 30 October 1981 During the 1980s, this work was shown at the Tel Aviv Museum and Israel Museum, and twice at Haifa Museum almost twenty years later: in 2003 in the exhibition \\"Communication Interferences\\" which dealt with important art works by the first generation of video artists in Israel, and again in 2008 as part of the exhibition \\"Check Point\\" which summarized the 1980s in Israel's art world. *Leopards (1981) a series of drawings in mixed techniques, using the wood's natural texture to simulate the leopards rosettes, while integrating sculptural elements, synthetic materials such as polyester, glass fibers and acrylics and natural materials like dirt, clay and bones. Nishri said: \\"I'm interested in forcing sculptural elements onto the painting surface in a way of contrast. The painting surface is decorative and lean in contrast with the heavy and rough sculptural elements.from the catalog for the exhibition \\"Turning Point\\", shown at the Tel Aviv Museum, 1981. pg. 24 *Is this Baby Yours? (2000) a two year mail correspondence project. Nishri sent out 300 boxes, with an embryo painted inside each, to intellectuals, artists and men and women of power. The boxes sent to both men and women also contained the question \\"will you recognize your paternity over this baby?\\" The 120 responses she received from people around the world (including Yoko Ono, Avi Mograbi, the Dalai Lama and the Pope) were shown at an exhibition at Ha'Kibbutz Israeli Art Gallery. In 2003 she published a book documenting the project and responses. *Troubled Water (2006) a video installation documenting the crumbling consciousness of Gita, Nishri's mother. Gita, a Holocaust survivor in her last days, refuses to move to a home for the elderly, in fear that it is a mere euphemism for a Nazi death camp. Gita mixes her identity with that of the wife of a fireman killed on 9/11.The installation was shown at the Artist's House in Tel Aviv (2007), the Lulea Summer Biennale in Sweden (2007) and at the Stuttgarter Filmwinter in Germany (2010).

Life Member of the Vlach community, Matthew was born in the village Kleinovo (now part of Kalabaka), and he became Metropolitan of Ioannina. In early 1596 he was elected Ecumenical Patriarch, but the election was not recognized because the Holy Synod that elected him was not attended by all the members; thus, after twenty days Matthew was forced to resign and moved to Mount Athos. In April 1598 Matthew was elected again in April 1598. During this Patriarchate Matthew transferred the patriarchal see from the Church of St. Demetrius Xyloportas, used since 1597, to the unimpressive church of the women's monastery of St. George in the Phanar, where it remains until today as St. George's Cathedral. The Phanar district then became the recognised centre of Greek Christian life in the city. He remained on the throne until January 1602, when he returned to Mount Athos. Once again, he ascended to the throne in January 1603 and reigned for seventeen days, either until his death, or, according to other sources, until he retired to Mount Athos, where he died in the same year.

Founded and fronted by Eddie Solis, the band has released the three studio albums Buicregl (2002), Stop Listening to Bad Music (2004), and The New Los Angeles (2007) all on CD and LP. It's Casual has performed with groups such as Story of the Year, Fu Manchu, Mastodon, High on Fire, and Zeke.  History  =Early years= It's Casual was formed in 2001 in Los Angeles, starting with Eddie Solis on guitar, a bassist, drums, and a second guitar player. The name was inspired by a line in The Wild Life, Cameron Crowe's follow up to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Solis soon met W.C.E., the drummer for Co-Ed and realized they had similar interests, such as Black Flag, The Melvins, and arena rock like Kiss and AC/DC. W.C.E. pitched the idea of a two piece band and It's Casual reformed with W.C.E on drums. The band has a hardcore punk and doom metal sound, with Solis on vocals and guitar and W.C.E. on drums. =The New Los Angeles= After returning from a summer tour in 2006 the band began working with producer Sergio J. Chavez (Mot√∂rhead/Helmet) for a third album, The New Los Angeles. In January 2008 the band had supporting slots for Fu Manchu on their North American tour. The New Los Angeles LP was released in Fall of 2008. Mastodon handpicked It's Casual to open for them in Athens, Georgia in October 2008, and the band played in-store at Criminal Records the day before in Atlanta, Georgia. During this time Solis casually befriended the Los Angeles music video director Robert Schober, also known as Roboshobo. Schober has previously directed videos for Mastodon, Metallica, and The B-52s. He began listening to The New Los Angeles. Four months later he offered to film a music video for the album's title track. The video was released in June 2009, and first premiered at The Viper Room Lounge. The band has released a split 7\\" from Basement Records with the hardcore band Bullet Treatment, and has also announced production on a new album titled The New Los Angeles II: Less Violence More Violins, which is purportedly inspired by the California education budget deficit. =Shows= The band has performed with bands such as Story of the Year, Mastodon, High on Fire, Fireball Ministry, Zeke, 16, Visual Discrimination, and Mondo Generator. They regularly play at venues such as The Viper Room and The Relax Bar, which is booked and managed by Solis as a metal venue in Hollywood. Style The band has drawn favorable comparisons to Black Flag, Mot√∂rhead, and Discharge, and Solis has described the sound as \\"L.A. hardcore\\" and \\"L.A. skate rock.\\" Themes include \\"municipal outrage\\" at freeways in Los Angeles and daily incidents and observations from living in the city. Solis has also cited Kiss as one of the band's onstage influences, quoting \\"For me, Kiss plays very loud and they engage with the audience,\\" and similar to Kiss, they have a wall of amps behind them on stage as both a practical and visual part of the show.

His territory included the areas around Weilburg, Ottweiler and Lahr in the Black Forest. Like his father, Philip III of Nassau-Weilburg he was an advocate of the Reformation.  Life  Albert was the only son of Philip III of Nassau-Weilburg and his second wife Anna of Mansfield. His mother died in childbirth. On 16 June 1559, Albert married Anna of Nassau-Dillenburg, a daughter of the William \\"the Rich\\" of Nassau-Dillenburg and sister of William I of Orange. In the same year, on 4 October 1559, his father, Philip III died. Albert inherited part of the county of Nassau-Weilburg jointly with his younger half-brother, Philip IV. Albert initially ruled jointly with Philip IV. They had inherited a high debt, which hampered their ability to rule. They were however, able to slowly improve their financial position. On 15 May 1561, the brothers split their territory for the first time. Albert was given Schloss Weilburg and the district of Weilburg, Philip received castle and district of Neuweilnau. The largest part of the territory and their father's debts, however, remained the common property. Albert moved into the new Schloss Weilburg, which he continued to expand. In 1571, they split the rest of the territory. Apart from Weilburg, Albert received Gleiberg, Cleen, labor and Burgschwalbach. Albert and Philip concluded several treaties with Hesse, in which they gradually divided their shared possessions. Albert was a member of the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts. He often travelled to the Imperial Diet and to the Emperor Maximilian II as a representative of the Wetterau Association, to discuss freedom of religion for the Calvinist princes. From 1583 to 1588, Albert fought in the Cologne War on the side of the Wetterau Association. When Count John III Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken died in 1574 without a male heir, the Counties of Saarbr√ºcken, Saarwerden and Ottweiler fell to Albert and Philip. They divided them: Philip received Saarbr√ºcken and Saarland; Albert received Ottweiler, the districts Homburg and Kirchheim and the Lordships of Lahr and Mahlberg in the Black Forest. Albert built a new castle in Ottweiler, which became his residence. As the eldest member of the Walram line of the House of Nassau, Albert took up guardianship of John Louis of Nassau-Wiesbaden. As head of the house, he set guidelines for foreign policy. The Saarbr√ºcken inheritance was contested by various sides. Duke Charles of Lorraine claimed the county of Saarwerden. Albert, however, could prevail before the Reichskammergericht. Elector Palatine Frederick III also claimed some of the Nassau territories; Albert was able to settle this issue out of court. Albert and Frederick concluded several treaties, in which the exact rights and boundaries of the various territories were defined. After Frederick III died in 1576, Albert was the executor of his last will and testament. In 1579, Albert extended his influence in Rhenish Hesse by purchasing a share of Jugenheim. Albert died on 11 November 1593 at his castle in Ottweiler. After his death, his three sons jointly ruled his territory. However, two of them died shortly after their father so that the surviving son of Louis II ruled alone from 1602 onwards. = Reformation = In his childhood at Neuweilnau Castle, he was educated in the Protestant faith by Kasper Goltwurm. Via Goltwurm, Albert became acquainted with Philipp Melanchthon, with whom he had lively correspondence. Kasper Goltwurm was succeeded in 1560 by Jacob Charsisius, who worked in Nassau-Weilburg as Superintendent until his death. At the request of Charsisius, some Catholic customs, such a celebrating carnival and lighting a bonfire on St. John's Eve were made punishable offenses in the Nassau-Weilburg territories. Lorenz Stephani was appointed as superintendent in the areas administered jointly by Hesse and Nassau. He also succeeded as superintendent of Weilburg in 1572, and in Ottweiler in 1574. In Ottweiler, Albert and Lorenz Stephani took measures to enforce the Reformation. Catholic priests were converted to the new faith or removed from office; monasteries were dissolved; church property was confiscated; schools were set up and Jus patronatus was purchased. In 1567 and 1568, Albert met his brother-in-law William of Orange several times. Albert supported him in the Dutch War of Independence against the Iron Duke, Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. The invasion of the Netherlands in 1568, however failed. Albert vouched for the wages of the mercenaries William had hired. = Construction policy = Albert initiated several large construction projects. After the first division of the county, he began converting the castle at Weilburg into a palace. To this end, he commissioned the architect Ludwig Kempf. During this phase, the north wing and the so-called City Piper Tower were added. The alliance coat of arms of Albert and Anna is still attached to the tower. Around this time, he also founded a game park in Weilburg, which still exists. After he inherited Ottweiler, Albert commissioned the architect Christmann Strohmeyer to construct a Renaissance style castle at Ottweiler. This castle was abandoned in 1753 due to disrepair. Albert probably also initiated the expansion of Gleiberg Castle in the late 16th Century, after it had fallen entirely to the House of Nassau.

It was written by showrunner Paul Lieberstein and directed by Charles McDougall. The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 29, 2011. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, after Robert California (James Spader) challenges the Dunder Mifflin staffers to double their sales, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), taking matters into his own hands, creates an incentive program. Eventually, he promises to tattoo himself if the staff earn a certain number of points. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) strikes up an unlikely friendship with Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey), both of whom are pregnant. The episode introduces Sabre's Pyramid tablet, a device that serves as a parody of several tablet computers, specifically the Apple iPad. The device would be explored later on in the season. \\"The Incentive\\" received mixed reviews from critics with many mainly criticizing the episode for recycling stories. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was viewed by 6.7 million viewers and received a 3.5 rating/9 percent share among adult between the ages of 18 and 49, marking a drop in the ratings from the season premiere, \\"The List\\". Synopsis Robert California (James Spader) challenges office manager Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) to double sales after a rousing motivational speech. After Andy tries unsuccessfully to mine ideas from the office employees, he consults a book on management techniques and decides to try an incentives program. He presents a number of items catered to individual employees, which they can purchase with \\"points\\" earned by exceptional workplace performance. This idea garners mixed reactions from the employees, but when Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) jokingly asks Andy what prizes he will offer for inordinately large numbers of points, he offers to tattoo whatever his co-workers would like on his butt in exchange for 5,000 points, not anticipating that anyone will be able to even come close to this number. The entire staff agrees to pool their points towards Andy's butt tattoo, and the office suddenly becomes a hubbub of activity, with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) even giving up his nap-time to make sales calls for Sabre's new Pyramid tablet. Andy calls the management book's author for advice to \\"demotivate\\" his employees but is hung up on. To Andy's great dismay, they earn 5,000 points by the end of the day. When Andy and the crew go to the tattoo parlor, Andy backs down and admits to Jim that he is not sure why Robert made him manager. Jim reassures Andy that he managed to pick up sales, and that no one in the office expects him to go through with the tattoo idea. Pepped up by Jim's talk, Andy enthusiastically agrees to getting the tattoo, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) changes, without telling Andy, to an image of a dog that has \\"Nard\\" written on it, a reference to Andy's nickname \\"Nard Dog.\\" Upon seeing his completed tattoo in a mirror, Andy is pleased with the result. Robert then reveals to the cameras that he picked Andy because he is an uncomplicated choice which causes people to rally behind him, because \\"there's something about an underdog that really inspires the unexceptional.\\" Pam and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) become walking buddies at Angela's request, but after Angela says she's reported Pam to Social Services for drinking herbal tea out of coffee mugs while pregnant, a disgusted Pam tells Angela they should not have anything else to do with each other. Production \\"The Incentive\\" was written by Paul Lieberstein. The episode was written by executive producer and showrunner Paul Lieberstein, who also portrays Toby Flenderson on the series, his 15th writing credit for the series. It was directed by Charles McDougall, the sixth episode he has directed for the series. The episode also featured guest star James Spader as CEO Robert California, his third appearance in the series. He appeared in 15 episodes of the season, before leaving the show. The subplot wherein California listens to Kevin's ideas was crafted to make the character \\"connect with his employees\\". The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Erin trying to comfort Andy by giving him a gift, Andy describing his low key management style, and Andy seeking more advice on which tie combination to wear. Cultural references The episode marks the first appearance of Sabre's Pyramid tablet. The device serves as a parody of several tablet computers, specifically the Apple iPad. B. J. Novak described the device as \\"really the worst piece of technology that you've ever seen.\\" The device was created by Paul Lieberstein, who originally envisioned that the device only had the rights to the 1993 film Coneheads. Reception =Ratings= Upon its original American broadcast, \\"The Incentive\\" was viewed by an estimated 6.70 million viewers and received a 3.5 rating/9 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a 13-percent drop in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"The List\\". Despite this, it ranked as the highest-rated NBC show on Thursday. The episode ranked third in its timeslot beating Person of Interest which received a 2.7 rating/7 percent share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic and The Secret Circle which received a 1.0 rating/2 percent share, but was defeated by Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.6 rating/9 percent share and The X Factor which received a 3.9 rating/11 percent share. =Reviews= \\"The Incentive\\" received average reviews from critics with multiple critics criticizing the episode for recycling storylines. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt noted that the episode \\"wasn't a trainwreck by any means\\", but he was disappointed by the fact that the episode recycled storylines from the early seasons of The Office. He also criticized the series for low stakes writing that \\"While Andy's character might be reflecting on his management skills, and Pam and Angela might be pregnant, nothing about the eighth season\\" of the series suggested that the show would try anything other than what it had already established as the status quo. He ultimately gave the episode a \\"C\\". M. Giant from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a \\"B‚Äì\\". Cindy White from IGN gave the episode a mixed review, writing that it took a \\"step back\\" from the promise of the season premiere and resorted to \\"recycl[ing] familiar plot elements\\" for the sake of the plot. She did, however, compliment the fact that Andy went through on his promise in the end. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode three stars out of five and concluded that \\"allowing [Andy] to be the lead character of The Office is not off to a strong start.\\" Jonathan Teigland of Starpulse called the episode's dynamic \\"interesting\\" and stated that \\"The Incentive\\" ended on \\"a sweet note\\". The episode's cold opening received negative reviews from critics. White called it \\"dumb\\", and noted that the joke \\"became grating very quickly\\". Teigland called the subplot \\"stale\\" and argued that it \\"[fell] a little flat\\". McNutt was hoping that the cold opening would have attempted to explain Kevin's lower intelligence, instead of just using it as a crutch for a joke.

He also appears with D√≥nal Clancy (cousin), Dan Milner, and fiddler Rose Clancy. O'Connell has also toured and recorded with The Clancy Brothers, being their nephew. For over 20 years, he has conducted small cultural tours to Ireland with Celtica Music & Tours and, for more than ten years, WGBH Learning Tours. Married with four grown children, he now spends his time between Bristol, Rhode Island and Waterford. Early life Robbie O'Connell was born in 1950 in St. John's Parish, Waterford, Ireland, to Se√°n and C√°it (n√©e Clancy) O'Connell. His early years were spent on the Cork Road, Waterford. When he was 7, his family moved to his mother's home town of Carrick-on-Suir where they established a guesthouse, Mount Richard. When C√°it's brother Bobby returned from New York in the mid 1950s, he suggested that they should convert the cellar to a folk music venue where they could hold ballad and music sessions. Very soon, Mount Richard ‚Äî and later, Tinvane Hotel ‚Äî became a thriving venue that hosted the likes of Seamus Ennis, Dolly MacMahon, Leo Rowesome, Jean Ritchie and others. It was in this atmosphere that Robbie and his sister Alice began to play (guitar) and sing folk and traditional music. They formed a group called The Rotary Folk with Sean Rattigan and Noel Carroll, which went on to win the Kilkenny Beer Festival in the late 1960s. During his years at University College Dublin, he traveled to the United States during the summer to perform on the Irish music circuit. In 1972, he met singer Roxanne Vigeant. They performed together as \\"Robbie & Roxanne\\" and then as \\"The Munster Cloak\\" with bassist Tony Riordan. They were married in 1974, settling in Acton, Massachusetts. They moved to Ireland in 1976 following the death of his mother in a car accident in Wexford. Robbie formed The Bread & Beer Band with friends Tommy Keane, Paul Grant and Martin Murray. Two of their four children were born during this time. The ballad sessions continued at Tinvane Hotel with frequent appearances by Dermot Morgan (Father Ted), Paddy Glackin, Colum and Tommy Sands, and piper Tommy Kearney. Joining the Clancy Brothers A nephew of the Clancy Brothers, O'Connell began touring with Paddy, Tom, and Bobby Clancy in 1977, taking the place of Liam Clancy who was working with Tommy Makem as a part of Makem and Clancy. O'Connell sang, played guitar and, occasionally, mandolin. In 1979 he and his family moved to Franklin, Massachusetts. Beginning in 1977, the Clancy Brothers and Robbie O'Connell toured three months each year in March, August, and November in the United States. O'Connell, who had been a songwriter since his early teens, composed several songs that the group sang regularly, such as \\"Bobby's Britches,\\" \\"Ferrybank Piper,\\" and \\"You're Not Irish.\\" He also included songs written by others, such as \\"Dear Boss\\" and \\"Sister Josephine.\\" Reviews cited O'Connell as a fresh addition to the group and with his original compositions, the future of the group. With the release in 1982 of his first solo album, Close to the Bone, O'Connell emerged as an artist of major stature. He began touring with Mick Moloney and Jimmy Keane, and also with Eileen Ivers and S√©amus Egan in the Green Fields of America.Princeton Folk Music Society Moloney, O'Connell & Keane recorded two albums, both of which garnered critical acclaim. The first was There Were Roses released in 1985 with the title track, the song \\"There Were Roses\\", penned by Tommy Sands. Second was Kilkelly in 1987, containing the title track \\"Kilkelly\\". Both albums were released on the Green Linnet label. O'Connell continued to perform part-time with the Clancy brothers for nineteen years. In 1992 he performed at Carnegie Hall with them and also sang and played the guitar on the telecast of a live tribute to Bob Dylan at Madison Square Garden. In 1996 Liam Clancy and O'Connell left the Clancy Brothers and formed their own duo, called simply Liam Clancy and Robbie O'Connell. Before splitting, the Clancy Brothers and Robbie O'Connell gave a farewell tour of both Ireland and America in February and March 1996. The Irish tour in February was filmed near the Clancys' hometown, televised and later released to video and DVD as The Clancy Brothers and Robbie O'Connell: Farewell to Ireland. Career after the Clancy Brothers Liam Clancy and Robbie O'Connell toured for a while as a duo, but very soon added Liam's son D√≥nal Clancy to the group, forming the trio Clancy, O'Connell & Clancy. The trio released two albums, a self-titled debut album in 1997 and an album of sea songs in 1998, The Wild and Wasteful Ocean. O'Connell regards the self-titled Clancy, O'Connell and Clancy album as one of his favourite works. In 1999, with Liam in Ireland, O'Connell in Massachusetts and D√≥nal in New York, the trio decided to call it quits as a full-time group. They occasionally regrouped for concerts, but as Liam's health declined, these were infrequent. In 2000 the Milwaukee Irish Fest had its 20th anniversary, and in celebration the entire performing Clancy family sang together on one stage at the festival. This once-in-a-lifetime line-up included Robbie O'Connell, D√≥nal, Liam, Bobby, Finbarr, and Aoife Clancy, along with friend Eddie Dillon, a collaborator of Bobby's. In 2006 O'Connell began an ongoing collaboration with his cousins Aoife and D√≥nal Clancy. The Clancy Legacy. Their first CD together was released in 2010. In addition to his solo career, O'Connell also performs with Mick Moloney, The Green Fields of America, The Clancy Legacy, and occasionally with Dan Milner, Ed Miller, and Rose Clancy. In 1995, O'Connell began hosting \\"Heart of Ireland\\" cultural tours wherein he would escort small groups of people to Ireland, concentrating on the musical and cultural traditions of particular areas. In 2003, WGBH radio host Brian O'Donovan asked O'Connell if he would use his expertise to put together and participate in a 'GBH Learning Tour. Both tours continue to run annually.

He is best known for his travel memoirs: Iranian Rappers & Persian Porn: A Hitchhiker's Adventures in the New Iran (Skyhorse Publishing, 2009), Socialist Dreams & Beauty Queens: A Couchsurfer's Memoir of Venezuela (Skyhorse Publishing, 2011), and The Long Hitch Home, (Skyhorse Publishing, 2015). Books Maslin's first book, Iranian Rappers & Persian Porn: A Hitchhiker's Adventures in the New Iran, chronicled his journey hitchhiking from England to Iran and subsequent travels around the Islamic Republic. The book was controversial for its portrayal of some of the less than Islamic aspects of Iranian youth culture, which Maslin both witnessed and participated in. These included getting drunk on surgical spirit (96% ethanol), attending illegal parties where there wasn't a compulsory hejab headscarf in sight, and even viewing hardcore porn films with a group of anti establishment students. As a result, Maslin has been banned from re-entering the country. Maslin's second book, Socialist Dreams and Beauty Queens: A Couchsurfer's Memoir of Venezuela, is part travel memoir, part political thesis. The travelogue details Maslin's experiences using CouchSurfing in Venezuela. Politically, the book explores the policies of Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez and the impact organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have had on Venezuela and Latin America in general. Maslin's third book, The Long Hitch Home, details an eighteen thousand mile hitchhiking trip he made, travelling over land and sea, from Australia to England. The journey took him across three continents and through nineteen countries: Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, China, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria, Germany, France, and England. It took Maslin over 800 hitchhiking rides to complete his journey.

Emirates Golf Club located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates is a 36-hole golf course. It was built in 1988, with the clubhouse and facilities designed and delivered by Dubai architect BSBG, and is the first grass golf course in the Middle East. The idea of a totally grassed championship golf course in Dubai was brought about by American businessman Larry Trenary and British businessman George Atkinson, both living in Dubai on a full-time basis. The actual golf course design was provided by Trenary's close friend American architect Karl Litten, based in Boca Raton, Florida. Litten's first visit to Dubai was to evaluate and design a course for the property surrounding the Jebel Ali Beach Hotel, located well outside of Dubai. The hotel owner, Ahmed Baker was keen to develop the project but he needed permission from the Ruler of Dubai, HHS Rashid bin Maktoum Al Maktoum, who seemed to be in favor of the project going forward. Sheikh Rashid fell ill and was never able to give his legal support for the specific use of the land. With Sheikh Rashid's passing, the idea for a championship golf course in the Middle East was still just a dream. A few years later the project, along with another Litten design, which was much closer to the city, was presented to Sheikh Rashid's third son, HHS Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, by Steven Trutch, construction engineer to Sheikh Mohammed. During a hunting trip to Pakistan, Sheikh Mohammed ran the idea of a grass golf course by his host, President Zia-ul-Haq, who was an avid golfer. President Zia told him it would be a very good idea making Dubia a center for the oil companies and many other big companies with operations in the Middle East. Eventually Sheikh Mohammed, in order to get final approval, took the idea to his older brother, the new Ruler of Dubai, HHS Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Sheikh Maktoum gave his consent and Sheikh Mohammed immediately designated approximately of sand dunes for the proposed golf course, clubhouse, majlis and maintenance area set just a few miles out of the city center. The golf course complex was finished and open for business in 1988 and President Zia was there for the grand opening and was presented with a solid golf tee and a golf club with a gold shaft in order for him to hit the very first ball, for the club's grand opening, in front of a very large crowd. The drive was hit hard and traveled about straight down the middle of the driving range. The grand opening was one of the last personal appearances President Zia made, as he was assassinated that same year when his plane exploded on takeoff in Pakistan. The Dubai Desert Classic, a European Tour event with a 3 million purse is an annual event played at by the club. The Omega Dubai Ladies Classic, a Ladies European Tour event, is also played at the club. The first Dubai Desert Classic event took place in 1989. Lucas Herbert from Australia wins the final of the Omega Dubai Desert Classic at Emirates Golf Club on January 26, 2020.

Stockhausen was located in the medieval district of Lochtrop, which was part of the county of Werl. In 997 the county of Werl was ruled by Gerberga's son from her first marriage, Herman II of Werl. The counts of Werl had long-standing connections with this monastery.Leidinger, 'Die Grafen von Werl,' pp. 124f. Herman II's father, Herman I of Werl, was the advocate of Meschede. And one of his ancestors, also called Herman, likewise acted as advocate for Meschede in 913. Meschede may have been founded by Emhilids, one of Herman's ninth-century ancestors.

Indibilis was defeated at this battle and became a prisoner, along with the Carthaginian general Hanno. In 217 BC, Indibilis regained his freedom and, with his younger brother Mandonius, decided to harass neighbouring Iberian tribes who were friendly to, or in alliance with, Rome. This harassment was fended off by Scipio Calvus by counter measures that involved killing some of Indibilis' tribesmen, taking some prisoner, and disarming the others. When Hasdrubal Barca, who was in north-western Spain, heard of this, he came back to help out his Iberian allies south of the Ebro River. At this time, the tide of war took a turn because of unexpected intelligence received by Scipio Calvus from the Celtiberians. The Celtiberi were encouraged to collaborate with Scipio Calvus and invade New Carthage. On the way there, the combined armies took three fortified towns and fought two successful battles against Hasdrubal, Indibilis, and Mandonius. Scipio Calvus' combined armies killed 15,000 of the enemy and took 4,000 prisoners. As a result, Indibilis and Mandonius and their remaining tribesmen stayed out of the picture until 211 BC. At that time, they gathered 7,500 Suessetani and joined forces with Hasdrubal. Publius Cornelius Scipio, father to Scipio Africanus and younger brother of Scipio Calvus, decided to attack the Iberian chieftain brothers as they were moving across his line of retreat from his camp. Cornelius Scipio did not want to be trapped and surrounded by Carthaginians. He marched at midnight to meet them and skirmished with them at daybreak. Cornelius Scipio was speared with a lance and killed during the Battle of Castulo, part of the Battle of the Upper Baetis. Scipio Calvus was killed at the Battle of Ilorca, the other part of the battle of the Upper Baetis, a few days later. Even though the chieftains were generally pro-Carthaginian, for which they were rewarded by being given back their tribal territories after the death of the two Scipios in 211 BC, they soon changed their minds after the conduct of the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal Gisco. He demanded money from them for his own benefit. He also required that the wife of Mandonius and the daughters of Indibilis be held at New Carthage in pledge for their fathers' fidelity. The hostages were part of the booty when Scipio Africanus captured New Carthage in 209 BC.Ihne, p. 356 Africanus treated them with much dignity and returned them to their rightful places, which impressed the Iberians.Williams, p. 280 Polybius 9.11Livy 26.49 The two brothers soon abandoned the Carthaginians and sided with the Romans.Dio 16.8 (42) In 209 BC, they concluded a treaty of alliance with the Romans which involved most of the Iberian tribes. They then collaborated in a campaign against Hasdrubal Gisco which ended in a victory at the Battle of Baecula in 208 BC.Liddel, p. 53 Because of the presence of the Roman general Africanus, Indibilis and Mandonius maintained a friendly association with the Romans. However, when a rumour spread in 206 BC that Africanus was seriously ill and possibly dead, they started a rebellion aimed at getting the Romans to leave Iberia.Livy 28.24Acciaiuoli, p. 406 This rumour also started a mutiny at the military camp at the Sucro River, which involved some 8,000 soldiers.A history of Rome from the earliest times to the establishment of the empire, Volume 1, p. 406 Indibilis and Mandonius sided with the mutineers.To His Mutinous Troops Africanus recovered and returned to good health and ultimately defeated the mutiny with the thirty-five ringleaders beheaded. He then fought the armies of Indibilis and Mandonius and defeated them. Indibilis and Mandonius surrendered to Africanus asking for mercy.Appian vi.37Raleigh, p. 469 Indibilis and Mandonius were subsequently released by Scipio on favourable terms. The next year, Africanus left Spain in the hands of his generals L. Lentulus and L. Manlius and returned to Rome to prepare for an attack on Carthage. Since Africanus was the only Roman general of whom Indibilis and Mandonius were afraid, they roused the Iberian tribes and assembled an army of 30,000 foot soldiers and 4,000 cavalry and decided to rebel again.Appian, The Spanish Wars vi.38 In a battle with the Romans, the Iberians were all but destroyed. Indibilis was killed during the battle and Mandonius escaped with the remnants of his forces. As part of the peace terms dictated by Rome, he was given up by his tribesmen to the Romans; what became of him is unknown.Livy 29.1-3  Notes   Sources  = Primary Sources = * Appian, Roman History * Cassius Dio, Roman History * Livy, Ab urbe condita * Polybius, Histories = Secondary Sources = * Acciaiuoli, Donato, Plutarch's Lives of the noble Grecians and Romans, Translated by Sir Thomas North, D.

He has earned numerous accolades during his career including the World of Warcraft TCG 2007 World Championship and the Magic: The Gathering 2010 World Championship. Magic: The Gathering Guillaume Matignon started playing Magic: The Gathering in 1994. Guillaume claims to have received the 34th DCI number issued in France and to have played in France's very first sanctioned event. In 2002, Matignon would meet fellow French player Guillaume Wafo-Tapa at the European Championship. Later that year Matignon moved to Wafo-Tapa's hometown of Nantes to study for three years. From there the two built a strong friendship, often preparing for events together. Matignon credits this friendship as a major source of his later personal success and considers Wafo-Tapa to be his favorite player. Matignon's name first came to the attention of the Magic: The Gathering community as one of the men credited with designing Pierre Canali's Affinity deck, which he used to win Pro Tour Columbus 2005. In particular, Matignon was credited with the addition of to the deck, a card Canali said 'made all the difference'.2005 Pro Tour Columbus Top 8 Profiles At this point Matignon had not met Canali, with Wafo-Tapa being the one to pass the decklist on to Canali. Matignon's personal breakout performance came at the 2006 France National Championship where he made the Top 8, losing to Selim Creiche in the quarterfinals. Matignon claims that this result made him more serious about Magic and he started to attend every Pro Tour. Matignon would continue to have great success at the France National Championships going on to win the 2007 event, take 3rd place in the 2009 event, and take 2nd in the 2010 event. The French National teams that Guillaume has featured on in the Team World Championship have placed 43rd (2007), 8th (2009) and 6th (2010). =2010 Player of the Year Race= Matignon's greatest success came in 2010, in which he reached the finals of Pro Tour San Juan, and won the 2010 World Championship defeating long-time friend Guillaume Wafo-Tapa in the finals. These results combined with his 2nd place French Nationals finish and other strong finishes throughout the year resulted in Matignon coming in joint first place alongside Brad Nelson in the 2010 Player of the Year race. This led to an unprecedented Pro Player of the Year tie-breaker contest. The 2010 Player of the Year race was decided in a special Player of the Year Match held at Pro Tour Paris 2011. Brad Nelson won the match 4-2 and became the official 2010 Pro Player of the Year, leaving Matignon to take second place. =Suspension= On 28 April 2011, the Magic: The Gathering website reported that Guillaume Matignon and fellow professional Magic: The Gathering player Guillaume Wafo-Tapa, had admitted responsibility for the leak of all the cards that would be contained in the upcoming New Phyrexia set. Matignon was apologetic about the leak, revealing that it was caused when he shared the 'God Book' of all the cards in the set, which he had received in order to write an article on the set for French magazine Lotus Noir, with Wafo-Tapa.WotC Suspends Guillaume Matignon for New Phyrexia Leak As a result, Guillaume Matignon was suspended from the DCI for three years, but later reduced to one year. Guillaume Wafo-Tapa, Martial Moreau, and David Gauthier (the three other players involved in the leak) were also suspended until October 2012. =Accomplishments= World of Warcraft TCG Guillaume Matignon took part in the first ever World of Warcraft TCG World Championships in 2007.

It is on the main oil road leading south from Bentiu, and is close to the Thar Jath Central Processing Facility in the Block 5A oil concession. The village is in a Jagei Nuer region. A clinic operated by M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res was established in the village in 1989 by Dr. Jill Seaman to treat patients suffering from visceral leishmaniasis. The disease was spreading quickly, in part due to civil war, which was causing population movement, reducing resistance through malnutrition and hindering provision of control and treatment. On 27 June 1998 Duar was attacked by Paulino Matiep's SSUM militia. The Medecins Sans Frontieres compound was burned and destroyed, as were the school and the community offices. Paulino's forces raided cattle camps, killing the animals for food. About 25% of the population fled, some to islands in the Nile where they felt they would be safe. After the civil war, a divisional headquarters for the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army was constructed by Arkel International in Duar. The site was in a swamp near to the Nile, and had to be raised above flood level. 3,000 truck loads of fill material were brought in from two quarries about distant, a difficult task due to poor road quality and north/south political tensions.

Near the end of 1803, a number of people claimed to have seen and even been attacked by a ghost in the Hammersmith area of London, a ghost believed by locals to be the spirit of a suicide victim. On 3 January 1804, a member of one of the armed patrols set up in the wake of the reports shot and killed a bricklayer, Thomas Millwood, mistaking the white clothes of Millwood's trade for a ghostly apparition. The culprit, a 29-year-old excise officer named Francis Smith, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, commuted to one year's hard labour. The issues surrounding the case were not settled for 180 years, until a Court of Appeal decision in 1984. The ghost From November 1803, a number of people in the Hammersmith area claimed to have seen, and some to have been attacked by, a ghost. Local people said the ghost was of a man who had committed suicide the previous year, and had been buried in Hammersmith churchyard. The contemporary belief was that suicide victims should not be buried in consecrated ground, as their souls would not then be at rest. The apparition was described as being very tall and dressed all in white, but was also said to wear a calfskin garment with horns and large glass eyes at other times. Stories about the ghost soon began to circulate. Two women, one elderly and the other pregnant, were reported to have been seized by the ghost on separate occasions while walking near the churchyard; they were apparently so frightened they both died from shock a few days afterwards. A brewer's servant, Thomas Groom, later testified that, while walking through the churchyard with a companion one night, at close to 9:00 pm, something rose from behind a tombstone and seized him by the throat. Hearing the scuffle, his companion turned around, at which the ghost \\"gave me a twist round, and I saw nothing; I gave a bit of a push out with my fist, and felt something soft, like a great coat.\\" On 29 December, William Girdler, a night-watchman, saw the ghost while near Beaver Lane and gave chase; the apparition threw off its shroud and managed to escape. With London not having an organised police force at the time, and as \\"many people were very much frightened,\\" according to Girdler, several citizens formed armed patrols in hopes of apprehending the ghost. Death of Thomas Millwood At the corner of Beaver Lane, while making his rounds at around 10:30 pm on 3 January 1804, Girdler met one of the armed citizens patrolling the area, 29-year-old excise officer Francis Smith. Armed with a shotgun, Smith told Girdler he was going to look for the supposed ghost. Girdler agreed that he would join Smith after he had called the hour at 11:00 pm, and that they would \\"take [the ghost] if possible.\\" They then went their separate ways. Just past 11:00 pm, Smith encountered Thomas Millwood, a bricklayer who was wearing the normal white clothing of his trade: \\"linen trousers\\" entirely white, washed very clean, a waistcoat of flannel, apparently new, very white, and an apron, which he wore round him\\". Millwood had been heading home from a visit to his parents and sister, who lived in Black Lion Lane. According to Anne Millwood, the plasterer's sister, immediately after seeing her brother off, she heard Smith challenge him, saying \\"Damn you; who are you and what are you? Damn you, I'll shoot you.\\" after which Smith shot him in the left of the lower jaw and killed him. After hearing the shot, Girdler and Smith's neighbour, one John Locke, together with a George Stowe, met Smith, who \\"appeared very much agitated\\"; upon seeing Millwood's body, the others advised Smith to return home. Meanwhile, a constable arrived at the scene and took Smith into custody. Millwood's corpse was carried to an inn, where a surgeon, Mr. Flower, examined the body on 6 January and pronounced death to be the result of \\"a gunshot wound on the left side of the lower jaw with small shot, about size No. 4, one of which had penetrated the virtebre [sic] of the neck, and injured the spinal marrow.\\" Trial of Francis Smith Smith was tried for wilful murder. The deceased's wife, Mrs. Fulbrooke, stated that she had warned the deceased to cover his white clothing with a greatcoat, as he had already been mistaken for the ghost on a previous occasion. Millwood's sister testified that although Smith had called on her brother to stop or he would shoot, Smith discharged the gun almost immediately. Despite a number of declarations of Smith's good character, the chief judge, Lord Chief Baron Sir Archibald Macdonald, advised the jury that malice was not required of murder, merely an intent to kill: The Lord Chief Baron observed that Smith had neither acted in self-defence nor shot Millwood by accident; he had not been provoked by the supposed apparition, nor had he attempted to apprehend it. Millwood had not committed any offence to justify being shot, and even if the supposed ghost had been shot, it would not have been acceptable, as frightening people while pretending to be a ghost was not a serious felony, but a far less serious misdemeanour, meriting only a small fine. The judge closed his remarks by reminding the jury that the previous good character of the accused meant nothing in this case. Macdonald directed the jury to find the accused guilty of murder if they believed the facts presented by the witnesses. After considering for an hour the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter. Macdonald informed the jury that \\"the Court could not receive such a verdict\\", and that they must either find Smith guilty of murder, or acquit him; that Smith believed Millwood was a ghost was irrelevant. The jury then returned with a verdict of guilty. After passing the customary sentence of death Macdonald said that he intended to report the case to the King, who had the power to commute the sentence. The initial sentence of hanging and dissection was commuted to a year's hard labour. The huge publicity given to the case persuaded the true culprit to come forward: he was John Graham, an elderly shoemaker. He had been pretending to be a ghost by using a white sheet to frighten his apprentice, who had been scaring Graham's children with ghost stories. There is no record of Graham's ever being punished. Effect on UK law The question of whether acting on a mistaken belief was a sufficient defence to a criminal charge was debated for more than a century until it was clarified at the Court of Appeal in the case R. v Williams (Gladstone) (1984), concerning an appeal heard in November 1983. The appellant, Gladstone Williams, had seen a man dragging a younger man violently along the street while the latter shouted for help. Mistakenly believing that an assault was taking place, Williams intervened and injured the apparent assailant, who was actually attempting to apprehend a suspected thief. Williams was subsequently convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. At the appeal Lord Chief Justice Lane referred to the historical debate: Lane went on to clarify the problematic issue: The appeal was allowed, and the conviction quashed. The decision was approved by the Privy Council in Beckford v The Queen (1988) and was later written into law in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, Section 76.

His Japanese name is Kunihiko Ryo. Early life and beginnings Yang Bang-ean was born in Tokyo, Japan as a youngest son of five children from a Zainichi Korean family. His late father (born in Jeju-do, South Korea), worked as a doctor; his mother (born in Sinuiju, North Korea) worked as a nutritionist at a hospital her husband owned. Yang started his early education at the Ch≈çsen School (ÊúùÈÆÆÂ≠¶Ê†°, Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÌïôÍµê), where he finished his primary and secondary education. He then proceeded to a Japanese high school, where he first got interested in foreign pops and rock music while listening to radio, which led to him joining a band. He continued his study at Nippon Medical School. It was the time when he first started playing the keyboard. The band traveled around holding concerts and releasing an album. After his graduation from Nippon Medical, he was appointed as a plastic surgeon in a hospital in Tokyo, but quit shortly after to become a musician. Personal life His father named him Yang Bang-ean (ÏñëÎ∞©Ïñ∏, Ê¢ÅÈÇ¶ÂΩ¶, Japanese name: Kunihiko Ry≈ç), which has three meanings: Yang(Ê¢Å), the symbol of a family line; Bang (ÈÇ¶), representing many countries, simply his dad's wish him to interact with many people worldwide; and Ean (ÂΩ¶), a common letter in Japanese names to respect Japanese sentiment as the family was living in the country. At the one of interviews in 2007, he stated that the only thing he regretted when he became a successful artist was that his father had to pass away before his success as a musician. Yang Bang-ean had been living with his nationality of North Korea over 30 years. However, he had to give up his citizenship to North Korean in 1999 as it was difficult to work overseas while holding a North Korean citizenship. Yang Bang-ean first met his wife at a party she was throwing. He married her when he was in his mid-thirties after being in a relationship for approximately 10 years. He currently lives in Karuizawa, Nagano in order to relax from the busy city life and concentrate on music.
