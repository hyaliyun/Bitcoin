The population was 566 at the 2010 census. Home to the Weston Playhouse Theatre Company, it includes the villages of Weston and the Island. History View of Weston village in 1908 Weston was originally the western part of Andover called West Town. Because Markham and Terrible Mountain blocked travel between the town's halves, it was set off and incorporated on October 26, 1799, by the legislature. Set among the Green Mountains, the terrain is very rough and mountainous, but the intervales provided good soil for agriculture and pasturage. A second village grew at the canal cut to divert the West River to power watermills. Called the Island, it developed into a small mill town.Hayward's New England Gazetteer of 1839 By 1859, when Weston's population was 950, industries included ten sawmills, a gristmill, two tanneries, one wood-turning mill, one machine shop, one axe shop, one carding machine, in addition to shops for blacksmiths, carpenters, tinsmiths, wheelwrights and shoemakers.Austin J.

The population was 2,286 at the 2010 census, making it the largest community within the town of Hartford. The village includes the White River Junction Historic District, a historic district that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and whose boundaries were increased in 2002. The historic district reflects urban architecture of the area from the late 19th century and early 20th century. The district is bounded by the Central Vermont railroad tracks, Gates Street, and South Main Street. It includes at least 29 contributing and non-contributing buildings. Notable buildings include the Coolidge Hotel, the First National Bank building, a U.S. Post Office building, and the White River Junction Fire House, showing examples of Greek Revival, Colonial Revival, Richardsonian Romanesque, Italianate and Romanesque architecture. History The village has long had a role in transportation, primarily as a railroad junction. From the arrival of the first railroads in the late 1840s until rail diminished in importance in the 1960s due to the Interstate Highway System, White River Junction was the most important railroad community in Vermont.Preserve America Community: White River Junction, Vermont, Preserve America website, accessed July 21, 2009 Its original importance was due to its location at the confluence of the White River with the Connecticut River. In 1803 Elias Lyman built a bridge across the Connecticut from the north bank of the White River to West Lebanon, New Hampshire. The local population remained quite low until the arrival of the railroad in the 1840s. Five different railroad lines were laid through the village site between 1847 and 1863 (the Vermont Central Railway and Connecticut River Railroad in 1847, the Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad in 1848, the Northern New Hampshire Railroad in 1849, and the Woodstock Railroad in 1863), creating an eight-track crossing that was served by 50 passenger trains daily.Brief History - Town of Hartford Vermont . Hartford-vt.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-02. In 1849, the village's first railroad depot was built, and local farmer Samuel Nutt arranged to buy and dismantle a hotel in Enfield, New Hampshire, and move it to his farm on the other side of the railroad tracks from the depot. His hotel, named the Junction House, was the first of three hotels to occupy the site, which now is home to the Coolidge Hotel, built in 1924. White River Junction hosted the annual Vermont State Fair from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th century. A special rail spur carried visitors uphill from the station to the fairgrounds. Geography White River Junction is located at (43.64888, -72.319588).

It takes its name from the White River, which joins with the Connecticut River there. The village is only a five minute's drive from Hanover, NH which hosts Dartmouth College and nearly equidistant from major cities and towns such as Rutland, Montpelier, St. Johnsbury, Brattleboro, Keene, and Concord. All are about one hour's drive from the village. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 2,569 people, 1,169 households, and 648 families residing in the village.

Culture Lillian Gish in Way Down East North Main Street c. 1908 White River Junction in 1915 White River Junction served as the location for the filming of director D.W. Griffith's film Way Down East, in part filmed on the ice floes of the Connecticut and White rivers, starring Lillian Gish and Richard Barthelmess. While filming, both cast and crew lodged at the Hotel Coolidge (then the Junction House). After 1950, important murals were painted on the walls of this hotel by Peter Gish. One of these, saying simply \\"ROOM WITH BATH\\" and a large arrow, has become a bit of a landmark. S. Douglas Crockwell painted a mural, Vermont Industries, in the post office in 1937. Federally commissioned murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. Hotel Coolidge, renovated in 1997, now operates as a 30-room hotel and a 26-bed youth hostel by Hostelling International USA. The 1920s structure once served as a railway hotel. The hotel is said to be haunted by the ghost of Ezra \\"Wrench\\" Magoon, a farmer and known bootlegger who died in the Hotel Coolidge in the summer of 1918. White River Junction is home to the Center for Cartoon Studies, a 2-year art school focusing on sequential art. It is also home to the Tip Top Building, a renovated bakery that houses artists, creative businesses and a cafe. The renovation was orchestrated by Matt Bucy, a Yale-trained architect who formerly wrote software for New England Digital. The Main Street Museum, described by the Washington Post as \\"quirky and avant garde\\", is an eclectic display space for material culture and an experiment in a new taxonomy. It makes its home in White River Junction's former fire station on Bridge Street, next to the underpass. White River Junction is home to Northern Stage, a professional regional theatre. It is also home to The Writers' Center, which offers classes and workshops to the local writing community.

In his early life, Maximus was a civil servant, and an aide to the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius. He gave up this life in the political sphere to enter the monastic life. Maximus had studied diverse schools of philosophy, and certainly what was common for his time, the Platonic dialogues, the works of Aristotle, and numerous later Platonic commentators on Aristotle and Plato, like Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus. When one of his friends began espousing the Christological position known as Monothelitism, Maximus was drawn into the controversy, in which he supported an interpretation of the Chalcedonian formula on the basis of which it was asserted that Jesus had both a human and a divine will. Maximus is venerated in both the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches. He was eventually persecuted for his Christological positions; following a trial, his tongue and right hand were mutilated. He was then exiled and died on 13 August 662, in Tsageri in present-day Georgia. However, his theology was upheld by the Third Council of Constantinople and he was venerated as a saint soon after his death. It is highly uncommon among the saints that he has two feast days: 13 August and 21 January. His title of \\"Confessor\\" means that he suffered for the Christian faith, but was not directly martyred. Life=Early life Very little is known about the details of Maximus' life prior to his involvement in the theological and political conflicts of the Monothelite controversy.The following account is based on the lengthy tenth-century biography catalogued as BHG 1234 and printed in Migne's Patrologia Graeca (90, 68A1-109B9). In recent years, however, this account has been called into question on the basis of new scholarly research. The author, or rather compiler, of BHG 1234 turns out to have used one of the biographies of Theodore the Studite (BHG 1755) to fill the gaps in the information he had on Maximus (See W. Lackner, Zu Quellen und Datierung der Maximosvita (BHG3 1234), in Analecta Bollandiana 85 [1967], p. 285-316). The information the compiler of BHG 1234 did have he drew from the passions extant at the time, in which nothing is said about Maximus' early years (See B. Roosen, Maximi Confessoris Vitae et Passiones Graecae. The Development of a Hagiographic Dossier, in Byzantion 80 [2010], forthcoming). On the basis of mostly internal evidence from Maximus' writings, C. Boudignon advocates a Palestinian birth for Maximus instead (See C. Boudignon, Maxime le Confesseur √©tait-il constantinopolitain?, in B. Janssens ‚Äì B. Roosen ‚Äì P. Van Deun [ed.], Philomathestatos. Studies in Greek and Byzantine Texts Presented to Jacques Noret for his Sixty-Fifth Birthday [= Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta 137], Leuven ‚Äì Paris ‚Äì Dudley, MA, 2004, p. 11-43; and id., Le pouvoir de l'anath√®me ou Maxime le Confesseur et les moines palestiniens du VIIe si√®cle, in A. Camplani ‚Äì G. Filoramo, Foundations of Power and Conflicts of Authority in Late-Antique Monasticism. Proceedings of the International Seminar, Turin, 2‚Äì4 December 2004 [= Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta, 157], Leuven ‚Äì Paris ‚Äì Dudley, MA, 2007, p. 245-274). If this is true, it confirms the value of the Maronite biography, even though it is clearly anti-Maximian. Numerous Maximian scholars call substantial portions of the Maronite biography into question, including Maximus' birth in Palestine, which was a common seventh century trope to discredit an opponent. Moreover, the exceptional education Maximus evidently received could not have been had in any other part of the Byzantine Empire during that time except for Constantinople, and possibly Caesarea and Alexandria. It is also very unlikely that anyone of low social birth, as the Maronite biography describes Maximus, could have ascended by the age of thirty to be the Protoasecretis of the Emperor Heraclius, one of the most powerful positions in the Empire. It is more likely that Maximus was born of an aristocratic family and received an unparalleled education in philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, etc. It is true, however, that Maximus did not study rhetoric as he himself notes in the prologue to his Earlier Ambigua to John, to which his lack of high stylistic by Byzantine standards attests. Nevertheless, for reasons not explained in the few autobiographical details to be gleaned from his texts, Maximus left public life and took monastic vows at the monastery of Philippicus in Chrysopolis, a city across the Bosporus from Constantinople (later known as Scutari, the modern Turkish city of √úsk√ºdar). Maximus was elevated to the position of abbot of the monastery. \\"This great man was of a noble family of Constantinople.\\" When the Persians conquered Anatolia, Maximus was forced to flee to a monastery near Carthage. It was there that he came under the tutelage of Saint Sophronius, and began studying in detail with him the Christological writings of Gregory of Nazianzus and Dionysius the Areopagite. According to I P Sheldon Williams his achievement was to set these doctrines into a framework of Aristotelian logic, which both suited the temper of the times and made them less liable to misinterpretation.The Cambridge History of Later Greek and Early Medieval Philosophy. ed A H Armstrong Cambridge 1967. p 492 Maximus continued his career as a theological and spiritual writer during his lengthy stay in Carthage. Maximus was also held in high esteem by the exarch Gregory and the eparch George. Involvement in Monothelite controversy hexagramma showing Constans II with his son. Constans II supported Monothelitism, and had Maximus exiled for his refusal to agree to Monothelite teachings. While Maximus was in Carthage, a controversy broke out regarding how to understand the interaction between the human and divine natures within the person of Jesus. This Christological debate was the latest development in disagreements that began following the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and were intensified following the Council of Chalcedon in 451. The Monothelite position was developed as a compromise between the dyophysitists and the miaphysists, who believed dyophysitism is conceptually indistinguishable from Nestorianism. The Monothelites adhered to the Chalcedonian definition of the hypostatic union: that two natures, one divine and one human, were united in the person of Christ. However, they went on to say that Christ had only a divine will and no human will (Monothelite is derived from the Greek for \\"one will\\"). The Monothelite position was promulgated by Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople and by Maximus' friend and successor as the Abbot of Chrysopolis, Pyrrhus.: \\"The first action of St. Maximus that we know of in this affair is a letter sent by him to Pyrrhus, then an abbot at Chrysopolis ...\\" Following the death of Sergius in 638, Pyrrhus succeeded him as Patriarch, but was shortly deposed owing to political circumstances. During Pyrrhus' exile from Constantinople, Maximus and the deposed Patriarch held a public debate on the issue of Monothelitism. In the debate, which was held in the presence of many North African bishops, Maximus took the position that Jesus possessed both a human and a divine will. The result of the debate was that Pyrrhus admitted the error of the Monothelite position, and Maximus accompanied him to Rome in 645.Philip Schaff, History of the Christian Church, Volume IV: Mediaeval Christianity. A.D. 590‚Äì1073 (online edition)¬ß111, accessed 15 January 2007. Maximus may have remained in Rome, because he was present when the newly elected Pope Martin I convened the Lateran Council of 649 at the Lateran Basilica in Rome.\\"Maximus the Confessor\\", in The Westminster Dictionary of Church History, ed. Jerald Brauer (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1971) (). This is generally known as the First or Second Lateran Synod, and is not recognized as an Ecumenical Council. The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which some believe may have been written by Maximus.For example, Gerald Berthold, \\"Maximus Confessor\\" in Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, (New York:Garland, 1997) (). It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 under orders from Constans II, who supported the Monothelite doctrine. Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could be sent to the Imperial Capital.David Hughes Farmer, The Oxford Dictionary of the Saints (Oxford:Oxford University Press, 1987) () p.288. This made Martin the last Bishop of Rome to be venerated as a martyr. Trial and exile Maximus' refusal to accept Monothelitism caused him to be brought to the imperial capital of Constantinople to be tried as a heretic in 658. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial he was accused of aiding the Muslim conquests in Egypt and North Africa, which he rejected as slander. In 662, Maximus was placed on trial once more, and was once more convicted of heresy. Following the trial Maximus was tortured, having his tongue cut out, so he could no longer speak his rebellion, and his right hand cut off, so that he could no longer write letters.Gerald Berthold, \\"Maximus Confessor\\" in Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, (New York:Garland, 1997) (). Maximus was then exiled to the Lazica or Colchis region of modern-day Georgia and was cast in the fortress of Schemarum, perhaps Muris-Tsikhe near the modern town of Tsageri.George C. Berthold (1985), Maximus Confessor: Selected Writings, p. 31. Paulist Press, . He died soon thereafter, on 13 August 662.For example, see Catholic Forum . The injuries Maximus sustained while being tortured and the conditions of his exile both contributed to his death, causing Maximus to be considered a martyr by many. The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by Anastasius Bibliothecarius. Legacy Maximus the Confessor and His Miracles. An early 17th-century Stroganov school icon from Solvychegodsk. Along with Pope Martin I, Maximus was vindicated by the Third Council of Constantinople (the Sixth Ecumenical Council, 680‚Äì681), which declared that Christ possessed both a human and a divine will. With this declaration Monothelitism became heresy, and Maximus was posthumously declared innocent. Maximus is among those Christians who were venerated as saints shortly after their deaths. The vindication of Maximus' theological position made him extremely popular within a generation after his death, and his cause was aided by the accounts of miracles at his tomb.For example, from the biography provided by the Orthodox Church in America: \\"Three candles appeared over the grave of St Maximus and burned miraculously. This was a sign that St Maximus was a beacon of Orthodoxy during his lifetime, and continues to shine forth as an example of virtue for all. Many healings occurred at his tomb.\\" Maximus is one of the last men to be recognized by both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches as a Father of the Church. In the encyclical Spe Salvi (2007), Pope Benedict XVI called Maximus 'the great Greek doctor of the Church', although it is not clear if the Pontiff intended to nominate Maximus 'Doctor of the Church' or to say that he already was one.The Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints (Prot. Num. VAR. 7479/14) considers the Pope's declaration in Spe Salvi an informal one. Theology As a student of Pseudo-Dionysius, Maximus was one of many Christian theologians who preserved and interpreted the earlier Neo-Platonic philosophy, including the thought of such figures as Plotinus and Proclus. Maximus' work on Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite was continued by John Scotus Eriugena at the request of Charles the Bald. The Platonic influence on Maximus' thought can be seen most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus- reditus (exit and return), teaching that humanity was made in the image of God, and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity with God.\\"Maximos, St., Confessor\\" in the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, ed. F.L. Cross (London: Oxford Press, 1958) (). One sees this especially in Maximus' Mystagogy and Ambigua. This emphasis on divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.\\"Maximus the Confessor\\" in Michael O'Carroll, Trinitas: A Theological Encyclopedia of the Holy Trinity (Delaware:Michael Glazier, Inc, 1987) (). Christologically Maximus insisted on a strict dyophysitism, which can be seen as a corollary of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.\\"Maximos, St., Confessor\\" in the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, ed. F.L. Cross (London: Oxford Press, 1958) (). Furthermore, in his works Maximus the Confessor argued the unconditionality of the divine incarnation.Hieromonk Artemije Radosavljeviƒá, Œ§·Ω∏ ŒúœÖœÉœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒøŒΩ œÑ·øÜœÇ Œ£œâœÑŒ∑œÅŒØŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ·ºçŒ≥ŒπŒøŒΩ ŒúŒ¨ŒæŒπŒºŒøŒΩ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ·ΩâŒºŒøŒªŒøŒ≥Œ∑œÑŒÆŒΩ.

It is the location of the Wilder Dam on the Connecticut River. The population of the CDP was 1,690 at the 2010 census. The village center is an early example of a planned mill community, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Wilder Village Historic District in 1999. History The village, originally known as Olcott Falls, is unique as an early planned community developed in part by Charles Wilder, owner of a local paper mill in the 1880s.The Gateway of Vermont: Hartford and its Villages, c. 1904, reproduced by the Hartford Historical Society, 2004 One feature of Wilder's plan was an orderly street plan in which streets were laid out at right angles, with several of the streets named after trees. The village was renamed in honor of Charles Wilder in 1897. As of the earliest years of the 20th century, the local paper mill was operated by International Paper and Wilder boasted a railroad station, a post office, several retail stores, and electric street lighting. An iron bridge contributed by Charles Wilder spanned the Connecticut River at Wilder. The bridge, the paper mill, and the dam that supplied power to the mill were all demolished in 1950 for the construction of Wilder Dam. The Wilder Village Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The district covers and contains 203 contributing resources. It includes examples of Queen Anne and Colonial Revival style architecture with houses dating from the late 19th century to the 1950s. It encompasses the main surviving portions of Wilder's planned community, and is roughly bounded on the north by Chestnut Street, the east by Passumpsic Avenue, the south by Horseshoe Avenue, and the west by Hartford Avenue (United States Route 5).

As the \\"Birthplace of Vermont\\", the town is where the Constitution of Vermont was adopted in 1777, thus marking the founding of the Vermont Republic, a sovereign state until 1791, when Vermont joined the United States. Over much of its history, Windsor was home to a variety of manufacturing enterprises. Its population was 3,553 at the 2010 census. History One of the New Hampshire grants, Windsor was chartered as a town on July 6, 1761, by colonial governor Benning Wentworth. It was first settled in August 1764 by Captain Steele Smith and his family from Farmington, Connecticut.https://archive.org/stream/historyofwindsor00aldr/historyofwindsor00aldr_djvu.txt In 1777, the signers of the Constitution of the Vermont Republic met at Old Constitution House, a tavern at the time, to declare independence from the British Empire (the Vermont Republic would not become a state until 1791).http://www.windsorvt.org/history In 1820, it was the state's largest town, a thriving center for trade and agriculture. In 1835, the first dam was built across Mill Brook to provide water power. Factories made guns, machinery, tinware, furniture and harnesses. The community is named for Windsor, Connecticut. In 1846, Robbins and Lawrence received a government contract to manufacture firearms. Using advanced machine tools to produce interchangeable parts, they and their associates established factories in the Connecticut River valley and throughout New England. Two factories, now both closed, sustained the economy of Windsor: Cone Automatic Machine Company and a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant. Windsor village began development at the end of the 18th century and achieved importance in Vermont history as the location of the framing of the constitution of Vermont. It is known as the birthplace of Vermont, where the state constitution was signed, and acted as the first capital until 1805 when Montpelier became the official state capital. Commerce prospered due to the village's location on the banks of the Connecticut River where several smaller streams run into it. The economy improved in the mid-19th century when Windsor became the first town in the state to break ground for the railroad with the construction of a rail depot. Windsor Station connected the town to out-of-state markets. It was after the railroad went through that the area was discovered by tourists. Windsor's war memorial, the City Center Veterans Memorial, was created by sculptor Lawrence Nowlan.

The population was 519 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Accomack County.  History  Though Accomack County was established as one of Virginia's eight original shires in 1634, the government was situated in the southern part of the Eastern Shore near Eastville until the division of the shore into two counties (Northampton and Accomack) in 1663. During this era, religious diversity began in the area, as Presbyterian Francis Makemie received a plantation nearby which he used as a base for his mercantile and missionary journeys, and where he died at age 50 a few years after winning a New York court case brought against his preaching (as the Scots-Irish emigrant to Maryland's Eastern Shore counties produced a preaching license from Barbados). Early Baptist Elijah Baker (Baptist) also arrived near Accomac before the American Revolutionary War, and was likewise imprisoned for unauthorized preaching, but eventually also had that case dismissed. After the creation of the present-day Accomack County, the court convened alternatively at Pungoteague and Onancock until the 1690s when it shifted to the house of John Cole at the site that later became the town of Accomac, then known by the name Matompkin. A brick courthouse was built in 1756 and the surrounding settlement became known as Accomack Courthouse. On December 7, 1786, Richard Drummond, Gilbert Poiley, John McLean, Edward Kerr, Catherine Scott, Patience Robertson, and William Berkeley petitioned the Virginia House of Delegates for the creation of an incorporated town at Accomack Courthouse. Their petition was granted and the House of Delegates passed an \\"Act to establish a Town at the Courthouse of the county of Accomack...by the name of Drummond,\\" named in honor of the chief landholder in the new town. Many of the town's historic houses, churches, and other buildings were constructed between the last decade of the eighteenth century and first half of the nineteenth century, representing vernacular interpretations of late Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival architectural styles, as the town prospered as the terminus of a ferry across Chesapeake Bay. The modern ferry only travels between nearby Onancock, Virginia and Tangier Island. During the American Civil War, the Union Army occupied the Eastern Shore to cut supply lines to the south and prevent the Confederate Army from using the shore as a staging area to attack the north through Maryland. Union General Henry H. Lockwood commanded the occupying forces and established a headquarters in the rectory of St. James Episcopal Church (then home to town physician Dr. Peter F. Browne). Other than damages to the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches which were used by the army for stables and housing, Drummondtown escaped the war with little damage. The late nineteenth century brought slow but steady economic prosperity for the citizens of Drummondtown, fueled by the arrival of the railroad from the north, and several new homes were constructed in and around the older core of the town in the 1880s and 1890s. The coming of the railroad also presented a challenge for Drummondtown when residents of the newly established town of Parksley initiated a referendum to move the county seat to the new community. The referendum vote took place in 1895 after nearly a decade of debate, and the residents of Accomack County elected to keep the court where it had been located for the past two centuries. By this time, the town had been renamed \\"Accomac\\" by order of the United States Post Office Department dated August 9, 1893. The name Accomac is derived from a Native American word translated to mean \\"on the other side\\".

Geography Chincoteague is located at (37.934673, ‚àí75.367805). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 75.58%, is water. History Chincoteague was a barrier island until the mid-1800s, when Assateague extended so far south that it shielded Chincoteague from the ocean. The year of 1650 marks the first land grant issued on Chincoteague Island, for . Daniel Jenifer became the first English landowner.Kenney, Nathaniel T. \\"Watermen's Island Home\\", National Geographic, Index (January‚ÄìJune 1980), vol 157 (June 1980): 812. In 1671, settlers came to the island, and by 1672 there were large farms by Bishops, Bowdens, Jesters and Tarrs. By 1838, there were 36 houses on the island. In 1861, with the Civil War looming following the attack on Fort Sumter, the island voted 132-2 not to secede from the Union and against slavery. The town saw minor action in the war via the Battle of Cockle Creek, which was fought in the bay in 1861. The Native American name for the island is Gingoteague, and the name of the town \\"Chincoteague\\" first appeared in the Decisions of the United States Board on Geographical Names in 1943.Topping, Mary, comp., Approved Place Names in Virginia: An Index to Virginia Names Approved by the United States Board on Geographic Names through 1969 (Charlottesville, VA: University Press of Virginia, 1971), 32. In 1962, a major nor'easter winter storm, the Ash Wednesday Storm, struck the coast. The town was completely underwater, and went for days without electricity. The storm destroyed almost all structures on Assateague Island, where development was just beginning. Following this, most of the island was preserved from development as Assateague Island National Seashore in 1965. The Assateague Lighthouse and Captain Timothy Hill House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Chincoteague Ponies Legend has it that the feral ponies on Assateague are descendants of survivors of a Spanish galleon that sank on its way to Spain during a storm in 1750 off the east coast, but the likelihood is that they are actually descended from domesticated stock, brought to the island by Eastern Shore farmers in the 17th century to avoid fencing requirements and taxation. In the Pony Penning, which has been held annually since 1925, horses swim across the shallow water between the islands. At \\"slack tide\\" on the Wednesday before the last Thursday of every July, Chincoteague's \\"Saltwater Cowboys\\" herd the wild Chincoteague ponies from Assateague Island, across the Assateague Channel, to neighboring Chincoteague Island. If any animal is too small or weak to make the swim, it is placed on a barge and ferried over. All the horses are herded into large pens after running through the middle of town and down Main Street. Pony Penning takes place on the last consecutive Wednesday and Thursday in July. The actual swim occurs on Wednesday, the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company auctions that year's foals on Thursday, and on Friday the remaining ponies swim back to Assateague.

The island also features many restaurants, miniature golf courses and ice cream parlors, including Island Creamery. The island contains two museums: Beebe Ranch, and the Museum of Chincoteague Island. With the designation of the nearby Wallops Island Flight Facility as the launch site for the Antares rocket and Cygnus cargo module used to resupply the International Space Station, there are large influxes of tourists whenever an Antares launch occurs.

A courthouse was established some years after, and militia barracks established during the Revolution. Some thirteen months after Cornwallis' October 1781 surrender at Yorktown, Commodore Zedechiah Whaley sought aid from Onancock during a naval campaign against British barges of war that had been harassing the shores and farms of Chesapeake Bay. On November 28, 1782 he sailed up Onancock Creek and appealed to Lt. Colonel James Cropper, who rounded up 25 local men in support. They boarded Whaley's flagship, Protector, and continued his siege upon the British flotilla. In what became the Battle of Kedges Strait three of four of Whaley's barges turned back under heavy British fire, leaving the Protector alone to press the fight. Vastly outnumbered, ultimately 25 of its 65 men were killed or wounded, 29 captured, and only 11 escaped during a climactic action on November 30.

The population was recorded at 229 at the 2010 census. History Dusk in Painter, July 2018 From its earliest settlement, most villages and towns on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were located near the coasts at navigable ports where crops or livestock could be transported by boat. The coming of the New York, Pennsylvania, and Norfolk Railroad in the 1880s initiated a shift in population and commerce to the center of the shore and created the need for new towns, including the town of Painter. The Painter-Garrisons United Methodist Church was established in nearby Mappsburg, Virginia in 1784 when Bishop Francis Asbury made his first of six visits to the home of Jonathan Garrison. The congregation constructed a chapel by 1787, the first house of worship to be built by the Methodist Episcopal Church on the Eastern Shore. The present church was erected in 1855 and was the scene of the establishment of the Independent Convention of Accomack, a group of Methodist Churches that left the northern church in 1860 and, at the close of the war, joined the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. By the turn of the 20th century, as the population continued to shift from Mappsburg to Painter and other new towns, the church erected a second building in Painter in 1906. Twenty years later, the older church was moved to Painter and adjoined to the existing building at which time it took the name Painter-Garrisons Church. The 1855 building is today the second-oldest Methodist Church building on the Eastern Shore. Willowdale and Central High School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

History  The history of Parksley is directly tied to the arrival of the New York, Philadelphia, and Norfolk [NYP&N;] Railroad on Virginia‚Äôs Eastern Shore in the mid-1880s. When the rail line connecting the lower Delmarva Peninsula to the markets of the northeast was built in 1884, several new towns were created along its route which bypassed many of the shore‚Äôs older established communities. Parksley was the second such planned town on the Virginia shore (after Cape Charles at the railroad‚Äôs southern terminus in Northampton County) and was laid out in 1885 under the management of the Parksley Land Improvement Company. In 1898, town leaders made an unsuccessful attempt to relocate the county seat from Accomac to the Parksley. The town was incorporated in 1904. During the first-half of the 20th century, Parksley became an important shipping point for seafood and agricultural products harvested from the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean in Accomack County. During World War II, Parksley was the site of the Shore National Guard Armory and its airfield was utilized by the Civil Air Patrol, part of military reconnaissance activities guarding the east coast of the United States against possible German invasion. Parksley was home to the Parksley Spuds, a team which played in the Eastern Shore Baseball League.

The community that exists on the island began as a single farmstead. The community grew in size throughout the 1800s and was incorporated in 1959. From as early as 8000 BC through the period of European contact in the seventeenth century, prehistoric populations periodically visited Saxis Island, probably to procure plants, shellfish, and game from its rich marine and marsh environments. The earliest documentary related to Saxis occurs on Capt. John Smith's map of the Chesapeake Bay region and in his published description of an exploratory voyage in the summer of 1608. During a foray up the Pocomoke Sound, Smith and his party encountered a village inhabited by the Pocomoke Indians along the south shore of the sound. By the 1630s, though, fur traders based in Maryland and rival Virginia traders on Kent Island were active all along the bay side of the Eastern Shore. Due to its isolation‚Äîseparated from the Eastern Shore mainland by maritime tidal marsh and bounded by water on the north, south, and west‚Äîthe peninsula has been known as Saxis Island since European settlers and speculators claimed land there beginning in 1661. When land was first patented by European settlers in 1666, Saxis Island was divided into two sections; the north end, the 150-acre property of Robert Sikes was known as ‚ÄúSikes‚Äôs Island,‚Äù and the remaining 200-acre parcel to the south was owned by George Parker who called his land ‚ÄúSt. George‚Äôs Island.‚Äù The division is still partly visible by a drainage ditch along Saxis Road. By 1860, the population had risen to 169 residents, including 15 free blacks. Early in the Civil War, Pocomoke Sound became a center of smuggling supplies for Confederates through a Union blockade of the Chesapeake Bay. Marking the line between the Union (Maryland) and Confederacy (Virginia), smugglers could easily cross from one zone to another without detection. In response, a Union naval flotilla was sent to patrol the local waters and interrupt smuggling operations. On November 16, 1861, the Union Army quickly marched south from the Maryland line and occupied the Eastern Shore of Virginia unopposed. At the same time shore parties from three Union ships came ashore on Saxis to obtain supplies. After the Union gained control of the Eastern Shore, local tradition holds, at least two vessels from Saxis engaged in blockade running, carrying supplies to Confederate troops in Virginia on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Besides the unconfirmed oral tradition of local blockade runners, Saxis is mentioned in Union reports and correspondence as the site of capture of blockade running vessels based in other ports of the Eastern Shore. Fishing and oyster dredging prospered as commercial enterprises on the island beginning in the 1860s. In 1866, the extension of the Pennsylvania Railroad to nearby Crisfield, Maryland, helped to spur local growth of commercial oystering. The seafood industry on Saxis boomed at the beginning of the twentieth century, with the 1903 construction of an unconnected wharf 650 yards offshore at the edge of the shipping channel. After the Civil War, the steamers \\"Maggie\\" and \\"The Eastern Shore\\" carried the seafood products of Saxis to the Northern cities. The steamers also brought many visitors to Saxis at that time. Recreation The Saxis fishing pier was completed in 2002. The pier extends 200 feet into Saxis Harbor and terminates with a 100-foot T-head. The pier is often used for public fishing. It is handicapped accessible and ADA compliant.http://www.mrc.virginia.gov/vsrfdf/saxis.shtm The town abuts the 6,177 acre Saxis Wildlife Management Area, which is owned and managed by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries.https://www.co.accomack.va.us/home/showdocument?id=2154 The Saxis Wildlife Management Area is predominately tidal marshland, divided into three tracts totaling approximately 5,678 acres. All three tracts are peninsulas, bordered by the brackish waters of Beasley Bay, Pocomoke Sound or Messongo Creek, or several smaller fresh water creeks. Forested high ground, or hummocks, occupy portions of the area farthest inland. Maintained primarily in its natural state, there is little in the way of active management or development on the area. The town is also home to the Saxis Island Museum, a nonprofit created to \\" created to preserve the history of Saxis Island and to document the lives of the people that made a living in the waters of the Chesapeake Bay.\\" Geography Saxis is located at (37.925825, ‚àí75.723184). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.30%, is water. Although water does not completely surround Saxis Island, the name is appropriate because of the landform's geographic isolation. Separated from the mainland by the maritime tidal Freeschool Marsh on the east, Saxis is bounded by shallow waters on the south (Starling Creek), west (Pocomoke Sound), and north (Robin Hood Bay). Industry The harbor is a local hub of economic activity. The fisheries industry is based around the southern end of Saxis near the harbor. This area is classified as an Intensely Developed Area (IDA) according to the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act. It is also zoned commercial-waterfront (C-W). This area is intended to provide space for activities and services relating to the seafood industry. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 337 people, 148 households, and 100 families residing in the town. The population density was 1,020.8 people per square mile (394.3/km2). There were 193 housing units at an average density of 584.6 per square mile (225.8/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 97.63% White, 0.89% African American, 1.19% from other races, and 0.30% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.89% of the population. There were 148 households, out of which 19.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.7% were married couples living together, 11.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.8% were non-families. 26.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.28 and the average family size was 2.71. In the town, the population was spread out, with 16.6% under the age of 18, 5.3% from 18 to 24, 24.6% from 25 to 44, 27.3% from 45 to 64, and 26.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 47 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.5 males. The median income for a household in the town was $18,125, and the median income for a family was $23,333. Males had a median income of $26,750 versus $19,250 for females. The per capita income for the town was $13,404. About 17.9% of families and 19.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.1% of those under age 18 and 31.9% of those age 65 or over.

The population was 727 at the 2010 census. Since 1850, the island's landmass has been reduced by 67%. Under the mid-range sea level rise scenario, much of the remaining landmass is expected to be lost in the next 50 years and the town will likely need to be abandoned. The people who came to settle the island permanently arrived in the 1770s and were farmers. In the late 19th century, the islanders began to become more dependent on harvesting crabs and oysters from the Chesapeake Bay. As the waterman livelihood became more important and more lucrative, there were often conflicts among the oyster dredgers and oyster tongers in the bay, and between those living in Maryland and those living in Virginia. Many people who live on Tangier speak a distinctive dialect of American English, Various scholars have disputed over how much of the dialect is derived from British English lexicon and phonetics. Linguist David Shores has noted that, while it may sound like a British variety of English, the dialect is a distinct creation of its own time and place off the eastern shore of Virginia.Shores, David L., Tangier Island: Place, People and Talk (Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses, 2000), 1. The persistence of this dialectal variety is often attributed to the geographic isolation of the population from the mainland. Tangier Island is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  Prior to the arrival of colonists on Tangier Island, it was a retreat for the Pocomoke Indians for centuries. Although not much is known about these people, their existence is evidenced by the thousands of stone arrowheads that have been found all over the island. Almost any morning after gale-force winds have been blowing all night, new arrowheads can be found on the beach. The discovery of an ancient offshore oyster midden, thousands of years old and containing a huge pile of shells which could only have been deposited by humans, is further evidence that there was a regular population on Tangier, at least in the warm part of the year, long before it had an English name. The enormous numbers of arrowheads and spear points found here suggest the island was probably much larger than recorded history can verify and was home to many animal species. The first known European explorer of the island was John Smith in 1608. He named Tangier and the surrounding islands the \\"Russel Isles\\" after the doctor on board his ship. In 1670, Ambrose White received a patent for called \\"an Island in the Chesapeake Bay\\". The next year, White assigned his patent to Charles and John West. In 1673, William Walton was granted on the western island which was formerly patented by White. There is a similar entry in the patent book three years later, but Scarburgh and West were the recipients instead of Walton, and in 1678, a formal patent was issued to both of them. Charles Scarburgh (often now spelled Scarborough) left his interest to his wife Elizabeth in 1702, and John West's interest went to his eldest son a year later. In 1713, two patents were granted to Elizabeth Scarburgh and Anthony West for Tangier Islands. One was for , which included the original plus more found within its bounds. The other grant was for of new land south of Tangier called \\"Sandy Beach Island\\" which was probably the hook-shaped part that is now attached to the main of the island. This was the first time Tangier Islands was named in the records. Although Elizabeth Scarburgh left her interest to her daughters, the title went to her oldest son, Bennett. It then passed to Henry Scarburgh and then to a Charles Scarburgh. In 1762, Charles Scarburgh confirmed an undeeded sale of his half to Colonel Thomas Hall. The next year Hall sold this to William Andrews as . Today many of the inhabitants have the surname Crockett, which was the name of the first permanent Anglo- American settler in the late 18th century. Other common surnames on the island include Pruitt, Thomas, Marshall, Charnock, Dise, Shores, and Parks. By 1900 there were 1,064 inhabitants. The British used the island as a staging area in 1813‚Äì1814 under infamous Rear Admiral George Cockburn during the War of 1812, building Fort Albion when there were as many as 1,200 British troops recorded on the island at one time. Many slaves escaped to the British on Tangier and were given their freedom. Some joined the Corps of Colonial Marines. When a dozen British sailors were captured, their account of hardships encountered with shortages of food and water on the island, and the building of Fort Albion, were reported in a local newspaper. Tangier was used as the base for the attack on the American capital in the Redcoats' stunning victory at the Battle of Bladensburg and the subsequent Burning of Washington in August 1814. This was followed by the Battle of Baltimore, when a failed British naval bombardment and barge assault on Fort McHenry in Baltimore harbor and simultaneous land Battle of North Point southeast of the city on September 12-13-14th, 1814, influenced Francis Scott Key's writing of the poem that became \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", named the American national anthem in 1931. The original church on the island was called Lee's Bethel and burned down in the 19th century. A bench marking its location is in the graveyard in Canton. The present-day church on the island, Swain Memorial Methodist Church, was established in 1835. The other church is called the New Testament Congregation, established in 1946, a non-denominational Christian place of worship. For various reasons, both historical and practical, burials are sometimes located in the yards of houses. There are also churchyard cemeteries at each of the island's churches. A typical cemetery on the island, showing overcrowding Three 21st-century hurricanes, Isabel in 2003, Ernesto in 2006, and Sandy in 2012, caused much of the island to flood. A few houses were abandoned or torn down due to storm damage, while others have been elevated on new foundations. New buildings continue to be built on the island. In the 1960s, the US Army took over portions of Tangier Island by eminent domain, forcing some residents including Walter Crockett and Maggie Eskridge Crockett to move to the mainland (Exmore, Virginia), so the US Military could conduct missile testing. Many of Tangier's residents believe that these operations were part of the reason for current erosion problems.  Geography  Tangier is located on an island in the Chesapeake Bay. It is made up of sandy ridges divided by marshes and tidal streams. The islands are connected by bridges. The island has three ridges, called Main Ridge, Canton, and West Ridge. North of Tangier is an island which was abandoned after the stream between the two islands (Oyster Creek) became too wide to build a bridge over. This northernmost area is called Uppards, and originally had a neighborhood called Canaan. The only structures left on Uppards are duck hunting lodges from 1928. A few of the homes on Main Ridge were moved from Uppards before flooding became a major problem. Each of the ridges has neighborhoods. On the northern part of Main Ridge, the neighborhood is called Meat Soup. On the northern part of West Ridge, is one called Sheep's Hill. The southern part of Main Ridge has a ridge called Black Dye, and the one on the southern part of West Ridge is called Hog Ridge. Canton is in the most southeastern area of the island and is reached via a bridge. The bridges over the largest channel, called the Big Gut, are, to the north, Long Bridge, School Bridge, Wallace Bridge; and the farthest south is Heisten Bridge. Because of its distance from the mainland, Tangier is sometimes considered isolated. The closest inhabited areas, and those most frequently traveled to and from, are Crisfield, Maryland; Onancock, Virginia; Reedville, Virginia; and other islands such as Smith Island, Maryland. Tangier is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land. Reduction in land mass The island is at risk of disappearing due to erosion and rising sea levels caused by climate change; since 1850, the island's landmass has been reduced by 67%. Under a mid-range sea level rise scenario, much of the remaining landmass is expected to be lost in the next 50 years and the town will likely need to be abandoned. Many residents believe that erosion is the cause of the increasing incidence and severity of flooding. A 2015 study by Davide M. Schulte, Karin M. Dridge and Mark H. Hudgins, all members of the Army Corps of Engineers, concluded that Tangier has 25‚Äì50 years of habitability remaining and that the subsidence of the ridges is ongoing since at least the mid-19th century. The authors also conclude that the primary causes of the subsidence in the southern Chesapeake Bay region are sea-level rise due to the melting of the Laurentide ice sheet, groundwater extraction on mainland Virginia, and the remaining effects of the Chesapeake Bay impact crater near Cape Charles, Virginia 35.5 million years ago. The town has been talking with political representatives for decades to get protection for the island in the form of jetties or sea walls. The Town, the History Museum, and townspeople continue to raise money for their sea wall fund. In 2017, CNN aired a story about Tangier that featured the town's mayor, James W. Eskridge. President Donald Trump called the mayor personally to assure him that the town would survive but offered no concrete form of relief or financial aid. Marshes and waterfowl The marshes outside of town Tangier and nearby islands are valuable tidal salt marsh habitat for waterfowl, especially as there is a general absence of predators for ground-nesting birds and birds in general. Tangier marshes are home to many birds, including pelicans, blue herons, rails, egrets, several varieties of ducks and geese, and osprey. The group of islands is one of the \\"few remaining population strongholds for American Black Ducks in Virginia.\\" Including the surrounding marshes, Tangier Island totals less than , but only are high enough for habitation. The highest point of land is barely above sea level, and about of Tangier shoreline are estimated to erode into the Chesapeake each year. Local residents see their existence threatened from falling catches, state regulation of the waterman livelihood on the Bay, constant erosion, and increasingly frequent flooding. Transportation Typical transport on the island The modes of transportation off the island are boats and airplane. There is an airport, open from dawn to dusk. There are two boats that travel regularly from Crisfield, Maryland, across Tangier Sound to Tangier. Passengers and mail are carried on these boats. The mail boat, the Courtney Thomas, leaves Tangier at 8:00 am and leaves Crisfield at 12:30 pm. The Steven Thomas, a 300-passenger cruise boat, leaves Crisfield at 12:30 pm during the summer season from Memorial Day weekend through mid-October and departs Tangier at 4:00 pm. In the summer season, the Chesapeake Breeze travels daily from Reedville, Virginia, on the Western Shore, leaving Reedville at 10:00 am and leaving Tangier at 2:00 pm. The ferry service to and from Onancock, Virginia on the Joyce Marie II runs daily from the first weekend of May through the first weekend of October. Transportation on the island does not rely heavily on automobiles. Some residents outfit golf carts with passenger trailers to offer \\"historical tours\\" of the island for tourists. The roads on Tangier are wide enough for two golf carts. Tourists and islanders often use golf carts, boats, mopeds, and bikes, but some have trucks and cars.  Language  Many who live on Tangier speak a distinctive dialect of American English, which scholars have disputed as derived from 17th and 18th-century British English (Early Modern and Modern English) lexicon and phonetics. Historical linguist David Shores has noted that, while it may sound like a British variety of English, the dialect is a creation of its own time and place off the eastern shore of Virginia, preserving certain features of its British origins in part due to isolation, but not unchanged. The persistence of this dialectal variety is often attributed to the purported geographic isolation of the population from the mainland. Many non-scholarly sources (i.e. the popular media and press) report that they think the origin of the unique dialect came from early European settlers from Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom. As Shores documents and historian Kirk Mariner confirms, there is no historical- linguistic evidence to back up the idea that the dialect is somehow a \\"leftover\\" from British settlers in the area before the American Revolution. Shores argues that the Tangiers dialect, and other nearby coastal dialects, \\"like other varieties of American English, are derived ultimately from a wide spectrum of seventeenth-century British regional dialects\\", and though that of Tangiers has continued to evolve since the time of English settlement, its isolation has tended to preserve some older features from that period. BBC Travel made a short filmurl=http://www.bbc.com/travel/gallery/20180206-the- tiny-us-island-with-a-british-accent  title=The tiny US island with a British accent on the language. The local accent is sometimes compared to that of the \\"Hoi Toiders\\" of the Outer Banks of North Carolina. There are some similarities, but the dialects are distinct. Before bridges were built, the only form of transport between or off the ridges was by boat, allowing the islands to stay isolated from the mainland. Smith Island, Maryland, has dialect that is more similar in terms of phonetics and lexicon to that on Tangier. Flag The historic connection to Cornwall is the reason why Saint Piran's Flag is present in the upper left canton of the flag of the island.  Economy  The island has been referred to as one of the last waterman communities. Industry Today, the inhabitants of Tangier rely on crabbing to make a living. Tangier is often referred to as the \\"soft-shell crab capital of the world\\". Most fishermen catch and sell crabs and oysters. North of the island are many free-standing docks not connected to land which fishermen use to hold crabs while they moult. Once a major industry on the island, oystering has returned in recent years as a supplement to the more prominent crabbing business. In 2014, a new oyster-farming company, called Tangier Island Oyster Company, was founded by a group that includes a former attorney general of Virginia, Ken Cuccinelli. The island also has a long history of graduates joining the military and being called to become pastors. The primary industry on the island besides fishing is tourism. During the summer, several cruise ships come to the island each day, allowing passengers to explore and buy goods from the islanders. Two bed-and-breakfast inns can accommodate a limited number of overnight guests. There are several restaurants and gift shops for the tourist-trade. Activities Tangier's post office With all the means of transportation and regular telephone service, residents have regular ways of staying in touch with the mainland. The island also has cable television and internet service. There is a calm, peaceful atmosphere on the island. It has several restaurants, four gift shops and a hardware store. Violent crime is virtually nonexistent. There are two bed and breakfasts for overnight guests, and a wild beach without a boardwalk or concessions. There is a historical museum and interpretive cultural center. There is one ATM on the island. Most of the gift shops, eating establishments, and overnight accommodations accept credit and debit cards. Tangier is known for its seafood dishes, especially its soft-shell crab sandwiches. These can be found at its restaurants including the Fisherman's Corner. Children sometimes sell lemonade and Christmas decorations made from sea shells to tourists. In the evenings, children unwind at a playground near the school, or at the 1950s-style air conditioned ice-cream parlor on Main Ridge called Spanky's. The major new addition to the island has been the Tangier Island History Museum, which created the historical markers that line Tangier's streets and provide a \\"historical tour\\" of the island. Tour guides are also available to offer visitors a narrated ride around the island. The museum's artifacts are donated or loaned by local residents. The museum also operates a small community library, \\"Muddy Toes.\\" Visitors often rent kayaks to follow local \\"water trails.\\" These trails guide visitors around the watermen's crabbing shacks built on stilts in Tangier Harbor, to navigate the saltwater \\"guts\\" that separate the island, or to visit \\"the Uppards\\", a marshy island just to the north of Tangier that used to have a sizable community until it was abandoned in 1928. Immediately to the east of Tangier, also a kayak paddle away, is Port Isobel, a small island owned by the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which operates an environmental study and retreat center there; on nautical charts, this bit of land is called East Point Marsh. Port Isobel's hiking trails are open to the public. The low-lying marshland is ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes and biting flies, so bug repellent is strongly recommended for anyone visiting. Institutions and culture The Tangier Island Health Foundation runs the Nichols Health Center on Tangier, which is operated by the Riverside Health System, which also operates on the Eastern Shore of Virginia and in Hampton Roads. Historically, there were two cases of Tangier disease, a recessive genetic disorder which causes high blood cholesterol, which, following discovery, was named after the island. There are very few residents with this genetic anomaly who currently live on the island. The residents of Tangier enjoy regular cable television and Internet through a microwave tower installed in spring 2010. There are phone lines on the island. One physician assistant and a number of registered nurses live on the island. David Nichols treated residents for thirty years, piloting a Cessna 182 or Robinson helicopter for once a week visits. In January 2007, he was profiled by ABC World News Tonight as its Person of the Week. Nichols died at the age of 62 on December 30, 2010, after a battle with cancer. Four months earlier, a new clinic was christened in his name, as he and a few others had raised funds for its construction. Emergency patients travel by helicopter to Crisfield or Salisbury hospitals in Maryland. Although the island has one operational power plant, it is used mainly for emergencies. Power comes in from the Eastern Shore of Virginia through an underwater cable. Swain Memorial United Methodist Church Methodism has been and remains a very strong influence on Tangier, stemming from the charismatic preaching and revival camp meetings held there in the early 1800s by Joshua Thomas, the famed \\"parson of the islands.\\" Because of their ties to the Northern Methodist Church, Tangier residents in the 19th century did not support slavery and did not join Virginia in seceding from the Union during the Civil War. Religious values are very important to the community. A local ordinance prohibits the sale of alcohol, making the island \\"dry.\\" In 1999, the Tangier town council blocked Warner Brothers from using the island to film the Kevin Costner film Message in a Bottle, objecting to the script's drinking, profanity and sex. If visitors bring their own alcohol, they are advised to be discreet and not drink it in public.  Education  Accomack County Public Schools operates the Tangier Combined School, the sole comprehensive K‚Äì12 school in the State of Virginia. it had 60 students. Politics Over 87% of the residents voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Sports  According to the current mayor of Tangier, James \\"Ooker\\" Eskridge, many island inhabitants were concerned the way of life on the island would change as the result of getting high-speed Internet in spring 2010. However, he indicated the change was for the better as islanders \\"developed quite the appetite for streaming sports\\". Recognizing the impact of sports on the island community, and believing it may be a boost to the island's tourism, the Virginia Tourism Authority (VTA) declared Tangier Island the biggest sports town in America, per capita. The VTA presented the island with a plaque to commemorate the occasion. This phenomenon became the basis for a commercial for ESPN.  Demographics  As of 2020, the island had approximately 440 permanent residents.  2000 census  As of the census of 2000, there were 605 people, 244 households, and 181 families residing in the town.

The racial makeup of the town was 99.50% White and 0.50% African American. In 2006, there were four people from Eastern India, one African American, one Pacific Islander, and several people of American Indian extraction. Many people have familial ties with residents of the Eastern Shore of Virginia as well as places on the western shore, such as Reedville and Urbanna. There were 244 households, out of which 27.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61.1% were married couples living together, 9.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.8% were non-families. 25.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Bunting Place was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.3 square miles (0.7 km), all of it land. The Wachapreague Channel winds from the town, through the seaside marsh, out to the barrier islands. Between Cedar and Parramore Islands it reaches the Atlantic Ocean.

The population was 2,231 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Amherst County. Amherst is part of the Lynchburg Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Amherst was founded in 1807. Originally known as \\"The Oaks\\" and \\"Seven Oaks\\", it began as a mere stagecoach station on the Charlottesville-Lynchburg road. Once Nelson County was separated from Amherst County in 1807, the community became the seat of Amherst County. It was at this time that the village decided to rename itself in honor of French and Indian War hero Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst. Major-General Amherst had been the hero of the Battle of Ticonderoga and later served as the governor of the Colony of Virginia from 1763 to 1768. On April 15, 1910, Amherst was incorporated by the order of the Circuit Court. A charter was granted to the town by the General Assembly in 1950.{http://www.amherstva.gov/menu/about%20amherst/town%20facts/index.asp} The official town seal was created by Ward Cruea, a commercial artist from Dayton, Ohio. His original proposal featured the \\"sleeping giant\\" (the Blue Ridge Mountain ridgeline west of Amherst), but this was rejected since it represented an area outside the town's limits. According to town legend, while a group was in the Clerk's office in the town hall engaged in conversation on the topics of the day, and looking eastward along E. Court Street, it was suggested that the Amherst courthouse be used as a model for the official seal. During that era, a large letter \\"A\\" was attached to a radio antenna tower beside the telephone company building that was adjacent to the courthouse. This internally illuminated \\"A\\" was used as a visual navigation beacon by aircraft pilots. Approximately six months later Cruea returned to the town and delivered a framed original of a proposed seal. His proposal incorporated the courthouse, the \\"A\\" and the town's date of incorporation. Cruea's proposal was adopted soon thereafter and became Amherst's official seal. The original seal is located on the wall of the town council chambers. One of the main landmarks of Amherst is the roundabout located at the intersection of Main Street and U.S. Route 60. \\"The Circle,\\" as it is affectionately referred to by Amherst residents, is the oldest traffic circle in the VDOT system. The fountain and the landscaping at the circle were installed and are maintained by the Village Garden Club.http://www.virginia.org/Listings/HistoricSites/TrafficCircleinAmherst/ Another landmark of Amherst is the Amherst County courthouse.

The College is also the Faculty of Theology of Acadia University. The University awards all of the Acadia Divinity College degrees, upon recommendation from the ADC Senate and the Senate of Acadia University. The graduate degrees are fully accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada. ADC is also affiliated with the Facult√© de Th√©ologie √âvang√©lique in Quebec, Canada; Christ International Divinity College and Universal Gospel Divinity College, both in Nigeria; and Bethel Bible Seminary, in Hong Kong. The mission of Acadia Divinity College is to equip Christian leaders for full- time and volunteer ministry in Canada and the world. ADC shares facilities with Acadia University; the college's library is part of the university's 800,000 volume Vaughan Memorial Library collection. Also hosted at Acadia University are the Esther Clark Wright Archives, which includes an extensive collection of material relating to the Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada (CBAC). History As early as 1830, Baptists in Nova Scotia, Canada established a \\"department of pious scholars\\" at Horton Academy in Wolfville (founded 1828) for ministerial training. A decade later, Baptist Leaders resolved to establish a Baptist College, an institution of higher learning where all people would be free to work and study, regardless of religious persuasion. The decision to establish Queen's College, which would become Acadia University, was formally approved by the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society on November 15, 1838. Preparation for ministry was carried on under various formats until the School of Theology was put on a more formal footing in 1923. After Acadia University was reorganized in 1966, the Baptists of Atlantic Canada began to operate the School of Theology under the name Acadia Divinity College, and on June 1, 1968, the Acadia Divinity College was established by an act of the Nova Scotia Legislature.

The population was 1,733 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Appomattox County. Appomattox is part of the Lynchburg Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The Appomattox Visitor Center in July 2011 The town was named for the Appomattox River. The river was named after the Appomattoc Native American tribe, one of the Algonquian-speaking Powhatan Confederacy, historically based in the coastal area and encountered by the English before the tribes of the Piedmont. The Appamatuck historically lived somewhat to the east of the present town, around the area of present-day Petersburg. At the time of European encounter, the area of Appomattox County above the Fall Line was part of the territory of the Manahoac tribe, who spoke a Siouan language. The town is located three miles west of the restored historic village of Appomattox Court House, the site of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's surrender to Union General Ulysses S. Grant on April 9, 1865, essentially ending the American Civil War. The area is preserved as Appomattox Court House National Historical Park and is administered by the National Park Service. At the time of the Civil War, the present community of Appomattox was the site of a railroad depot on the line between Petersburg and Lynchburg, a stop on the Southside Railroad. The town was first named \\"Nebraska\\" in 1855. In 1895 it was renamed \\"West Appomattox\\". The first postmaster of \\"Nebraska, Virginia\\", was Samuel D. McDearmon. Near the end of the Civil War, Robert E. Lee made a last attempt to reach the depot, hoping to transport the Army of Northern Virginia south by railroad to meet Joseph E. Johnston's larger Army of Tennessee, then located in Greensboro, North Carolina. The arrival of Federal troops and their blocking Lee's army from the depot led to Lee's surrender in the home of Wilmer McLean, on April 9. Johnston later surrendered 98,270 Confederate troops (the largest surrender of the war), marking the end of the conflict on April 26, 1865. Small bands of soldiers continued fighting until June 1865. Though President Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, slaves in the southern states were not freed until the surrender at Appomattox Court House on April 9. Though the last of the slaves weren't freed until June 19, the surrender at Appomattox is the event that would hammer the final nail in slavery's coffin. Today, each April, the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park commemorates this event with a luminary ceremony, wherein a lantern is lit for each of the 4,600 slaves freed in Appomattox County alone. The railroad became the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad in 1870. The inconvenience of the railroad's location to the original Appomattox Court House in the village of Clover Hill led to the decline of the courthouse community. After fire destroyed the courthouse building in 1892, the county relocated the court to the depot area, which formally became the county seat in 1894. The railroad became a line in the Norfolk and Western Railway and then the Norfolk Southern Railway. In 1990, there were 11,971 residents reported for Appomattox County; the Town of Appomattox had 1703 residents. In addition to Appomattox Court House National Historical Park, the Appomattox River Bridge, Appomattox Historic District, Holiday Lake 4-H Educational Center, and Holliday Lake State Park are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The 2010 Appomattox shootings occurred from January 17 to 20 and left eight people dead. Geography Appomattox is located at (37.358973, ‚àí78.826438).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 3.1 square miles (8.0 km2), all of it land. History What put Crimora on the map was the open-pit Crimora Manganese Mine that started in 1866. The mineral manganese was used in the production of steel. Mining at Crimora continued intermittently under a series of owners until March 1946. The Crimora deposit is about 500 feet wide, 200 feet deep, and half a mile long and consists of clay with scattered lumps of manganese ore. It lies under a layer of clay and quartz fragments about 15 feet thick. The Crimora deposit produced more manganese than any other single deposit in the United States and, at one time, the mining operations there were among the largest in the world. The mines are located at the foothills of the mountains of the Shenandoah National Park. They are two miles east of Crimora Station on the Norfolk Southern Railway formerly known as the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. Crimora Station was located at milepost 136.9 but the station is no longer there. The remains of the mine consist of three adjoining man-made lakes that range from 20 to 100 feet deep, with underwater shafts connecting multiple water sources around the Crimora area. The Coiner House and Crimora School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Transportation Crimora is located roughly 5 miles north of Waynesboro, Virginia on U.S. Route 340, known as Eastside Highway. It is a U.S primary and has locally been called \\"The Bloody Highway\\" because of the above average crash statistics for Augusta county. Route 340 was widened to a 5-lane unlimited access highway in 2002 in Crimora's village center but it is only 0.6 miles in length. VDOT plans to eventually widen North 340 from Waynesboro to Grottoes, VA. Points of interest Turk Mountain is the prominent landmark of Crimora and has a giant boulder on the north end of its summit. The boulder is accessible by foot from the Shenandoah National Park and The Appalachian Trail; the overlook has views of Crimora and surrounding areas. Turk Mountain lane is a collector road that has a terminus directly below the Turk Mountain overlook and is the southern limit of Crimora's CDA (Community Development Area).90% of Crimora's newest housing stock has sprung up near Turk mountain lane in Northwood and Vesper View Subdivisions. The final phase of Vesper view is not yet built. Other landmarks include Davis Mountain and Wildcat ridge seen on the northern end of Crimora's Sampson area. The Crimora Overlook is an automobile friendly pull off that lies directly on the Shenandoah National Park and can be seen above Wildcat ridge on a summit further east. The Crimora Community Center is a historic landmark that was built as a school in 1920. Around 2005 Augusta County built a town park beside the Community center on the banks of the South River. A former landmark was the Purple Cow Drive-In, a former ice-cream stand currently unoccupied. The old Purple Cow sign‚Äîa cow head on a pole, painted in purple and white‚Äîstill exists.

The population was 9,106 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Lynchburg Metropolitan Statistical Area. Geography Forest is located at (37.370723, ‚àí79.266801). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.89%, is water. Community Forest is a suburban part of metropolitan Lynchburg, containing many subdivided properties carved from and around surrounding farms and woodlands. The Ivy Hill community is the largest development and is built around the Ivy Hill Golf Course. The community has been experiencing rapid growth and development over the past 10 years, especially after Rte 221/Forest Road was widened to 4 lanes in 2009. The growth of commercial businesses and housing which slowed briefly during the 2007-2010 recession, is expected to continue into the near future. The recent construction of shopping centers such as Cavalier Corner and the large Forest Square strip mall beside the post office, along with the addition of several restaurants, evidence this recent growth. Forest is home to Jefferson Forest High School (the Cavaliers, ~1400 students), Forest Middle School (the Knights, ~1100 students), Forest Elementary School, Thomas Jefferson Elementary School, Timberlake Christian School, and New London Academy. Forest has no real town center since the original one was torn down without a trace, but the area along U.S. Route 221 from the post office to the Forest Library is generally regarded as the central part of the community; however, technically the community extends all the way along Rt. 221 from the middle school to Graves Mill Shopping Center. The political attitudes of the majority of the population are conservative. There are a few older homes along a loop behind the library and two churches that would have been in close proximity to the former N&W; rail station, which was torn down in the late 2010s. This might have been considered the main stop for Forest prior to sub-urbanization and commercial development along Rte.221/Forest Road. Liberty University's Center for Engineering Research and Education (CERE) in the New London Business & Technology Center park on Hwy. 460 in New London is a small but increasingly significant engineering center developed with partnerships by private industry, regional governments, the Tobacco Commission, in addition to the University. Existing businesses in the park include Simplimatic Automation, NanoSeptic Technologies, and a new 40,000 SF shell building is available for sale or lease. With the expansion of Liberty University in the park and water and sewer infrastructure investments by Bedford County, the site is an attractive location for increased development. . A partnership with a subsidiary of Blue Ridge Towers and Bedford County to increase Broadband access throughout the entire county is also underway. Many residential properties in established neighborhoods in Forest already have access to broadband via cable service providers the county as a whole however is very large in land size and largely rural. The most popular attraction of the town is Poplar Forest, the summer home of Thomas Jefferson, which is open to the public for visitation and is the subject of ongoing archaeological studies. The home is also used for events. Nearby attractions include Point of Honor in Lynchburg, the National D-Day Memorial in Bedford, and the Peaks of Otter in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The nearest urban center is downtown Lynchburg, approximately northeast of town. Forest is accessed via Route 221 and U.S. Route 460. The nearest rail line is Amtrak's Crescent train at the Kemper Street station in Lynchburg. Amtrak Virginia also provides regional service with a Lynchburg stop between Roanoke and Northern VA/Washington, D.C. The nearest major airport is Lynchburg Regional Airport offering commercial service through US Airways Express to Charlotte, North Carolina. Private charter flights are available through Virginia Aviation. There is also a public general aviation (GA) airport, New London Airport, which is open for all GA pilots.

The population was 353 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Botetourt County. Fincastle is part of the Roanoke Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The town of Fincastle was originally settled by Scotch-Irish and German immigrants from Pennsylvania who arrived in the region in the mid-18th century. John Miller erected a sawmill which became the nucleus of the early village of Fincastle. In 1770, Botetourt County was separated from Augusta County, and Miller's home was selected as the meeting place for the court. Two years later, Israel Christian donated of land and laid out the streets and lots for the new town of Fincastle. The town's name was selected to honor George, Lord Fincastle, the eldest son of Virginia's Lieutenant Governor, Lord Dunmore. In 1773, the first log courthouse was built on the designated court square at the center of Fincastle. Around the same time, a brick church was constructed on land donated by Israel Christian to serve as the established (Anglican) house of worship for the town. The church closed after the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Virginia during the Revolutionary War and was later occupied by Presbyterians who rebuilt the structure to its present Greek Revival style. By the early-19th century, the village had grown into an important regional center of commerce, especially for the wool industry, aided by the construction of taverns, hotels, and shops. A second courthouse was erected in 1818 and replaced by a third, a larger brick structure of Greek Revival style in 1850. This courthouse continues to serve Botetourt County today, having been rebuilt after a disastrous fire in 1970.

The population was 1,105 at the 2000 census and 1,021 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Buchanan County. The town has two higher educational institutions Appalachian School of Law and Appalachian College of Pharmacy. Legislation establishing Buchanan County in 1858 designated a plat of land at the confluence of the Levisa Fork River and Slate Creek as the seat of government for the county and directed the erection of the county courthouse on the plat, which marked the beginnings of what would be Grundy. Although originally developed along the Levisa Fork River, which provided a transportation and power waterway, the town suffered from nine major floods since 1929 that caused extensive damage, the last in 1977. It is notable for having major businesses relocated in the 21st century to higher ground to prevent such damage in the future. A mountain opposite the historic town was blasted to provide a kind of plateau where much of the town was relocated and redeveloped. The federal project included construction of bridges and a flood wall, and relocation of some roadways. During the American Civil War, the town served as a stopover for Union troops on their way to the Battle of Saltville. History The town, founded in 1858 upon the formation of Buchanan County, was named for Felix Grundy (1777‚Äì1840), United States Attorney General (1838‚Äì1839) and United States Senator from Tennessee (1839‚Äì1840). It was incorporated in 1876. The present courthouse dates from 1905 and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1982. Since the late 19th century, this area depended on coal mining as the basis of its economy. The decline in mining resulted in a loss of jobs and population. Civil War events In October 1864, Union raiders under Brigadier General Stephen G. Burbridge passed through Grundy on their way to destroy the saltworks near Saltville in Smyth County. There they were met by Confederate troops commanded by Brigadier General Alfred E. Jackson at the Battle of Saltville. The Union troops were defeated in the battle, but returned later and succeeded in destroying the saltworks. Grundy flood control project Aerial view of flooding on the Levisa Fork River in Grundy, Virginia in 1984 Since 1929, Grundy suffered nine major floods of the adjoining Levisa Fork River. After the inundation of April 4, 1977, many businesses did not reopen, and owners abandoned the buildings that housed them. In 1984 many businesses flooded again. A 21st-century project to relocate much of the town to higher ground has been completed. The project started in 2001. The mountain on the other side of the Levisa Fork was blasted to create of relatively level land. After a few years of blasting, utilities were placed and new bridges were built across the river. A new downtown is planned to include a multi-level Wal-Mart with a parking deck. Buildings backing on the river have been demolished, and a new flood wall protects the county courthouse. U.S. Route 460 was relocated to the top of the flood wall. Businesses formerly located downtown were relocated to an industrial building located just outside town. State Route 83 will be rerouted to meet U.S. Route 460 down the street where U.S. Route 460 originally took a directional split to go through downtown Grundy. Additional work upriver is under study to reroute U.S. Route 460 inland from its current path. Base of a regional grocery store chain Grundy Town Center was built as part of a $200 million redevelopment which included a Walmart store built on top of a two-story parking garage, the only one of its kind in the United States. Grundy was the home of the predecessor to the Food City Stores, when Jack Smith opened a Piggly Wiggly franchise in 1955. The store was Smith's first and the chain has now grown to 107 stores, primarily located in Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The chain is known for sponsoring the Food City 500 NASCAR race at Bristol Motor Speedway. The Grundy store remained open one day short of 50 years. It closed in November 2005. A new store opened up just outside the town limits in Vansant. The Grundy store was re-opened on June 29, 2011, as one of the KVAT Food City Stores. It is a Super Dollar Discount Foods location. Education as a new sustaining industry Grundy is home to the Appalachian School of Law, which opened in 1997, and the Appalachian College of Pharmacy, which opened in 2005. Buchanan County chose Grundy as the site for the ASL to revitalize the town, which had been in a steady economic decline since the Flood of 1977. The ASL has generated $12 million for the local economy. Its presence has increased demand for construction of rental homes and stimulated the opening of additional businesses in the area. Additionally, ASL has successfully demonstrated the concept of creating institutions of higher education as an economic development tool. This success contributed to the founding of the Appalachian College of Pharmacy, located in Oakwood. Like the Appalachian School of Law, it was created as part of a continuing economic redevelopment effort in the region. ACP is forecast to add $20 million per year to the local economy. Appalachian School of Law shooting On January 16, 2002, Dean Anthony Sutin, Professor Thomas Blackwell, and 1L student Angela Dales were shot and killed on the campus of the Appalachian School of Law by Peter Odighizuwa, 43, of Nigeria, a student. At his trial, Odighizuwa was found to be mentally competent. He pleaded guilty to the murders to avoid the death penalty, and was sentenced to multiple life terms in prison.

The population was 3,450 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Lynchburg Metropolitan Statistical Area. History=A new town on a new railroad The town of Altavista was created in 1905 during the construction of the east- west Tidewater Railway between Giles County (on the border with West Virginia) and Sewell's Point in what was at the time Norfolk County. Planned by Campbell County native William Nelson Page and financier and industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, the Tidewater Railway was combined with the Deepwater Railway in West Virginia to form the new Virginian Railway in 1907. Although it was a common carrier and offered limited passenger service until 1956, the main purpose of the Virginian Railway was to haul bituminous coal from the mountains to coal piers on the ice-free harbor of Hampton Roads. Lane Brothers Construction Company was the contractor for constructing of the Tidewater Railway, including its crossing of the existing north-south Southern Railway in Campbell County. Three Lane brothers purchased of land near the point where the railroads would intersect, and had civil engineers lay out a new town with streets and lots, complete with water, sewer, telephone service, and electric lines. Settlement was encouraged by the awarding of free lots. Named for the Lane family farm in Albemarle County, the new town of Altavista was incorporated in 1912. The former Virginian Railway became part of the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1959, and it and the Southern Railway were combined in the early 1980s to form the current Norfolk Southern Railway. Now operated by the same company, both railroad lines are still very active in the Altavista area. The current mayor of Altavista is Mike Mattox, a former teacher and local businessman. Lane Home Furnishings In March 1912, John Lane had purchased a bankrupt box plant in Altavista for $500. His son Ed Lane, 21 at the time and with little manufacturing experience, was encouraged by his father to try his hand at starting a chest factory in the newly acquired plant. Since the Lanes did not know how successful their new venture was going to be, they chose not to put their name on it, instead incorporating the little company as the Standard Red Cedar Chest Company, with John Lane as president and Ed Lane as vice president and general manager. From cedar chests, Lane expanded to occasional tables in 1951, case goods in 1956, and accent pieces in 1965. In 1972, Lane bought a small reclining chair company in Tupelo, Mississippi, named Action Industries, which had been founded in 1970 by Bo Bland and Mickey Holliman. Action sustained tremendous growth through gains in market share and product diversification over the next 20 years, becoming a major force in the upholstered furniture industry. Today, the wood and upholstered divisions have become Lane Home Furnishings and a leading maker of Virginia furniture. Lane Furniture Industries was later owned by Heritage Home Group, which also owns other well-known brand name companies such as Broyhill, Thomasville, Drexel Heritage and Maitland Smith. It is being purchased by United Furniture Industries. Lane was most famous for their Lane cedar chests made at the original plant in Altavista. At the beginning of the 21st century the company headquarters were moved from Altavista and the plant there closed. Soon afterwards the last commemorative cedar chests were made as the plant shut down. The old plant now sits mostly vacant, but certain sections have become occupied by new companies, and Central Virginia Community College has moved into parts of the office building. A fire occurred in an empty section in early 2006. Historic sites The Avoca Museum and Altavista Downtown Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The population was 1,112 as of the 2010 census. It is part of the Lynchburg Metropolitan Statistical Area. History On January 14, 1802, \\"Brooke Neal\\" was established by the Commonwealth of Virginia in Chapter 65 of the Acts of Assembly. It was named after John Brooke and his wife, Sarah (n√©e Neal) Brooke, who established a tobacco warehouse which became known as \\"Brooke's Warehouse\\". It was located near the boat landing and ferry crossing on the Staunton River. The \\"Town of Brookneal\\" was incorporated and a charter issued in 1908. Later to become the smallest incorporated town in the Central Virginia region, Brookneal served as the closest center of commerce for portions of Campbell, Charlotte, and Halifax counties. As transportation modes developed, Brookneal's location offered proximity to waterways, roads and railroads. From the earliest days of settlement of the area by Europeans in the Colony of Virginia, through the Revolutionary War era, and extending through most of the first half of the 19th century in Virginia, waterways were a major transportation resource for commerce. Roads were primitive and poorly maintained. Upstream from the fall line, which marked the western reaches of the coastal plain of Virginia (and adjacent areas of North Carolina), canals and other improvements were constructed to aid navigation upriver by batteaux and other watercraft. In the later 19th century, railroads supplanted river transportation in the Piedmont region east of the mountains. Just south of Brookneal lies the Roanoke River (also known as the Staunton River), which flows east to its mouth at Plymouth, North Carolina, and the Atlantic Ocean via the sounds in eastern North Carolina. Through the efforts of the Roanoke Navigation Company, established with the assistance of both states in 1815, passage was made possible to as far west as Salem in Roanoke County. By 1828, boats were traversing of \\"tolerable good and safe navigation\\" of the Roanoke River between Brookneal and Salem.\\"Timeline\\" , Salem Museum Patrick Henry, the first Governor of Virginia after statehood, was an early advocate of the waterway. In 1794 he retired to the 520-acre Red Hill Plantation, located near Brookneal in rural Charlotte County. (The plantation is now operated as a historic museum known as the Red Hill Patrick Henry National Memorial). He established a ferry on the Staunton River to connect Red Hill Plantation with Campbell and Halifax counties on the other side. By the 1850s, the new technology of railroads was rapidly overtaking the canal systems in many areas; it provided access to additional places. In 1887 the construction of the Lynchburg and Durham Railroad began at Lynchburg, passing south through Brookneal. Just south of town, the railroad crossed the Staunton River into Halifax County. It was completed in 1892, and almost immediately was leased to the Norfolk and Western Railway, and merged into it in 1896. In 1904, the Tidewater Railway was formed by the industrialist financier Henry Huttleston Rogers, to transport bituminous coal from southern West Virginia to coal piers on the ice-free harbor of Hampton Roads. Planned by William Nelson Page of Campbell County, the right-of-way selected for favorable grades passed along the north bank of the river, crossing the L&D; track. In 1907, the Tidewater Railway was combined with the Deepwater Railway (initially a West Virginia short line railroad) to form the new Virginian Railway. By 1908, construction was nearing completion, and the new line officially began service on July 1, 1909. In 1959, the Virginia Railway was merged with the Norfolk and Western. Each later became part of the modern Norfolk Southern system in the early 1980s. In the late 19th century, Brookneal became the site of textile mills that used the water power of the river. These were important to the Piedmont economy for decades. The town of Brookneal suffered a series of disasters in 1912, culminating in a fire that destroyed much of the town. When residents rebuilt, they constructed substantial brick houses to replace many of the old wooden structures.\\"History\\" , Campbell County, US GenWeb Archives Soon, the small town resumed its growth. Served for many years by passenger trains and freight service on both railroad lines, and later by U.S. Highway 501 and State Route 40, Brookneal developed a diverse economy with manufacturing, agriculture, service firms and retail offerings. The proximity to the river enhanced its recreational opportunities for residents and visitors as well.\\"Brookneal Information\\" , Campbell County Brookneal has suffered an economic downturn due largely to the dissolution of the Virginia Tobacco Co- Op, which made tobacco warehouses defunct, and the late-20th century decline of the American textile industry, which resulted in the closing of the Dan River mill in Brookneal. The Dan River textile mill employed nearly 400 workers.

The population was 1,111 at the 2010 census. The county seat of Caroline County since 1803, Bowling Green is best known as the \\"cradle of American horse racing\\", the home of the second oldest Masonic Lodge, and the current location of the oldest continuously inhabited residence in Virginia. History The town of Bowling Green was earlier known as New Hope. One of the earliest stage roads in the colony ran through the area from Richmond to the Potomac River, where a ferry crossing was operated to Charles County, Maryland. One of the first stage lines in America to maintain a regular schedule operated along this road. New Hope Tavern was built along the road in the 18th century and the area around it became known as New Hope.History The town was renamed for \\"The Bowling Green\\" which was the plantation of town founder, Major John Thomas Hoomes, who donated the land and funds for a new courthouse when the community became the county seat in 1803. The origin of the plantation's name is not definitive but may be based on the green sward in front of the plantation house itself. The Bowling Green Estate was the site of one of the first tracks built to race horses in America.Acknowledgment For Codification The plantation house, pre-Georgian tidewater colonial in style, was built circa 1741. A prominent colonial landmark, it is one of the oldest houses in original condition in Virginia and is listed on both the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places. The present Caroline County Court House was built in 1835 and Bowling Green was incorporated as a town about 2 years later, in 1837. The town is best known as the \\"cradle of American horse racing\\" and as the home of the second-oldest Masonic Lodge. . The Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad (chartered in 1834) was built through nearby Milford (just west of town) and reached Fredericksburg by 1837. This important rail link between several major Northern railroads at Washington, DC and other major Southern railroads at Richmond was long partially owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and became part of CSX Transportation in the 1990s. It is a major freight railroad line for north-south traffic and the corridor also hosts many Amtrak trains. Although the closest Virginia Railway Express (VRE) commuter passenger rail service to Northern Virginia is currently accessed at Fredericksburg, future VRE extensions southward may include service at Milford which would be very convenient for Bowling Green and the surrounding area. In 1855, a gazetteer described the town as having \\"2 churches, 3 stores, 2 mills, and about 300 inhabitants\\". Today, Bowling Green is located along Virginia State Route 2, one of the two earlier highways between Richmond and Fredericksburg. In later years, U.S. Route 301 was built through the area, connecting Richmond with Baltimore, Maryland with what was effectively an eastern bypass of the Washington, DC area for north-south traffic along the U.S. east coast. A new road, Virginia State Route 207 was established from Bowling Green west to Carmel Church, where it intersects Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 1, major north-south highways. The musician Jason Manns is from Bowling Green. In 1941, the United States government acquired of Caroline County to the north and east of Bowling Green and established the A.P. Hill Military Reservation. Now known as Fort A.P. Hill, it was named for a Virginia military hero, U.S. Army and later Confederate General Ambrose Powell Hill, who was killed just prior to the end of the War in 1865.

The population was 126 at the 2010 census. Port Royal was established in the mid-17th century in the Colony of Virginia primarily as a port at the head of the navigable reach of the Rappahannock River for export of tobacco, Virginia's cash crop. The town was also set along an early stage road, which brought passengers and freight for embarkation upon the river there. It still remains a crossroads along the busy modern highways of U.S. Route 17 and U.S. Route 301. History=17th century origins Port Royal is one of the area's oldest towns. It was first established in 1652 as a port at the head of sea-going navigation on the Rappahannock River during an era when waterways were the fastest and easiest method of transportation of people and property in the British colony of Virginia. It was an important point for export of tobacco, Virginia's cash crop. Local tradition holds that Port Royal was named after the Roy family. Dorothy Roy and her husband John owned a warehouse chartered by the crown, a ferry service across the Rappahannock River to King George County, and a tavern. In the 21st century, the chimneys of the Roy house are preserved landmarks in the town.Welcome to Historic Port Royal, Inc Port Royal was incorporated as a town in 1744. The \\"town green\\", upon which stands today the Town Hall and the firehouse, was forever reserved \\"for public and civic use\\".Welcome to Historic Port Royal! Port Royal house. Photo shows dirt road leading to river; on left, house with stone 1st floor and wood 2nd floor. By Frances Benjamin Johnston, between 1927 and 1929 19th century Shipping of property from the port began to decline after completion of railroads which began in Virginia in the 1830s. The last scheduled passenger ship service ended in 1932, supplanted by highways. However, Port Royal was served by the new highways which became U.S. Route 17 and U.S. Route 301, with their crossroads at Port Royal. Probably Port Royal's most notable claim to fame is that John Wilkes Booth was killed about two miles outside town by Sgt. Boston Corbett, part of a contingent of federal troops, at the now obsolete Garrett farmstead on April 26, 1865, after Booth assassinated United States President Abraham Lincoln on the night of April 14, 1865 at Ford's Theatre in Washington, DC. Booth escaped through southern Maryland and across the Potomac River (twice ‚Äì as the tidal forces carried them back to Maryland on the first try) as well as the Rappahannock River before being cornered in a tobacco barn on the Garrett farm at sunrise. Shot through the neck and instantly paralyzed, Booth died on the porch of the Garrett house (carried there after falling in the barn). One of his accomplices in the murder who was with him and captured at the Garrett farm, David Herold, was tried, convicted and hanged on July 7, 1865, along with other conspirators. Poet Judith Lomax lived in Port Royal for some years. Geography Port Royal is located in northern Caroline County at (38.169799, ‚àí77.190763), on the south bank of the Rappahannock River.

Carroll County Courthouse shooting  On March 14, 1912, a gunfight broke out in the Carroll County Courthouse after the conviction of Floyd Allen, wealthy landowner and patriarch of the then- powerful Allen clan. The story made national headlines until it was eclipsed by the sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912. Floyd Allen was on trial for illegal rescue of prisoners, assault and battery, and interfering with deputies. The charges stemmed from an altercation during which he freed his nephews‚Äîwho had been arrested for brawling and disrupting a religious service, fled to North Carolina, but were recaptured and being taken to the Carroll county jail‚Äîand pistol-whipped a deputy sheriff with his own malfunctioning gun, leaving the officer unconscious. Arrogant and short-tempered, Floyd had vowed he would never spend a day in jail. He had previously avoided jail time for other crimes, including killing a black man in North Carolina, nearly killing the successful purchaser of a farm he wanted, and even attempting to kill his own brother. Prosecutor William Foster (who had won his elective office by defeating another Allen clan member) received death threats, but proceeded to trial beginning on March 12. However, the jury was deadlocked and therefore kept overnight in a local hotel. The next morning, after Floyd was convicted, Judge Thornton Massie refused to set aside the verdict (as had happened in an earlier case), and sentenced Floyd Allen to a year in jail and a $1000 fine, at which point Allen stood up and openly refused to go. Gunfire erupted between lawmen and Floyd and several Allen family members present at the trial who came to his \\"aid\\". Researchers continue to disagree as to who fired the first shot. An estimated fifty shots were exchanged before more than 100 witnesses; Judge Massie, prosecutor Foster, Sheriff Lewis Webb, and the jury foreman were shot dead, and a witness died of her wounds the following day. Floyd, his brother Sidna, the court clerk, a deputy, another juror and two spectators were wounded. Floyd and his family initially escaped. Because Virginia law at the time said deputies' law enforcement powers depended on their sheriff being alive, the assistant court clerk S. Floyd Landreth telegraphed Governor William Hodges Mann, who sent deputies employed by the Baldwin‚ÄìFelts Detective Agency by train from Roanoke. The wounded Floyd Allen and his son Victor had stayed in a Hillsville hotel overnight and were arrested the next morning. Other members of the Allen clan were soon captured. However, Sidna Allen and his cousin Wesley Edwards escaped, and were captured months later in Des Moines, Iowa. For their parts in the fatal melee, Floyd and Claude Allen eventually received the death penalty, and were electrocuted in late March 1913. Victor Allen was later acquitted: Governor Elbert Lee Trinkle pardoned two Allen cousins in 1922, and Governor Harry F. Byrd pardoned Sidna Allen and Wesley Edwards in 1926.

Revitalization efforts An optical fiber link between Farmville and Keysville was the first on the agenda in efforts by Governor Mark Warner to bring broadband internet access to rural areas of Virginia, funded by the Tobacco Indemnification fund. This was also accomplished to aid in developing the Southside Industrial Park by bringing mid-sized businesses the technological access needed in an effort to bring more industry to Charlotte County. The link is complete but has yet to be utilized.

The population was 16,366 at the 2010 census. The community is considered a suburb of the independent city of Richmond in the Richmond- Petersburg region and is a part of the Southside neighborhoods. Originally developed as a resort, a central portion of Bon Air has been designated as a National Historic District with many structures of Victorian design from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its name means \\"good air,\\" reflecting its role as a resort getaway that wealthy Richmonders enjoyed for its fresh air as opposed to the dirty air of Richmond's industrial downtown of the late 19th century. Definition and Boundaries Bon Air is located entirely within Chesterfield County, Virginia and mostly within the 23235 zip code. It is bounded to the north by Huguenot Road, to the east by the city of Richmond, to the south by Midlothian Turnpike, and to the southwest by Robious Road. History=Pre-resort settlement Prior to the advent of the 1877 resort in Bon Air, the area had some settlements. Brown Road and Belleau Drive each follow portions of the old Warwick Road that dates back to the 18th century Warwick plantation. The Bon Air area came to be known as Brown's Summit, probably named for the Brown family farm which was located near the southwest corner of present-day intersection of Jahnke Road and Brown Road. In the first half of the 18th century, Anderson Edwards owned a large plantation on the current site of Bon Air. He sold parts of it to Nathaniel and James Duval in 1840. The Duvals' two portions of Anderson Edwards' land would eventually comprise large parts of modern day Bon Air.http://ccpl- discover.chesterfield.gov/iii/cpro/ImageViewPage.external;jsessionid=F98E717BD4CE26160C0046752B45125B?lang=eng&sp;=2&sp;=1000681&sp;=F&suite;=def The R&D; railway came through the area around 1850, connecting Manchester to Robious and the Coal Mines.

Bon Air: the resort era In the 19th century, it was believed that the higher elevation and distance from the urban area of Richmond provided a more healthful atmosphere, particularly in the hot summer months in central Virginia. With its nearby location and greater elevation, Bon Air offered these features nearby, and was founded as a summer resort town about outside of Richmond by railroad. One of the founders was Colonel Algernon S. Buford, of Chatham, Virginia, who is best known for his presidency of the Richmond and Danville Railroad during its massive postwar expansion, which ended in 1894 with the formation of the Southern Railway System (now part of Norfolk Southern). Bon Air's connections with the railroad's leaders could possibly be evidenced by the fact that over many of the years until passenger service ended in 1957, the community simultaneously had three stops within of trackage. Colonel Buford was a graduate of the University of Virginia. He became a lawyer, and represented Pittsylvania County in the Virginia House of Delegates during 1853 and 1854. During the Civil War, Buford served the Confederacy in Richmond at Virginia Depot, although the title \\"Colonel\\" is believed to have been honorary, a southern custom common in the post-slavery years. With the support of Virginia Governor Francis H. Pierpont, on September 13, 1865, Buford became president of the Richmond and Danville Railroad (R&D;). Around 1875, Buford purchased portions of a large tract of land from Nathaniel and James Duval, a tract of land on the south side of the R&D; right-of-way known as the old Anderson Edwards plantation. He personally (as well as through the R&D; Railroad) helped in the development of Brown's Summit, which was renamed Grand Summit, then Bon Air, after the French expression for \\"good air\\". This choice may also have been related to the earlier settlement by French Huguenots, a group of religious refugees, slightly to the west. In 1877, Richmond Jeweler Lewis G. Jahnke bought the other 153 acre portion of the Edwards estate from the Duval brothers and two years later sold this farm it to his brother A. Franz Jahnke Sr. This 350 acre estate, at 7737 Jahnke Road, would be known as Shady Echo. The Jahnke family would be very involved in Bon Air life, from the fledgling Bon Air Presbyterian Church to the Bon Air Chautauqua Society founded by Reverend Hazen in 1885. 1882 map of Bon Air, showing the depot, hotel and annex, and dance pavilion, as well as the streets and undeveloped residential parcels In 1877, Buford was among the first investors and officers in the Bon Air Land and Improvement Company. Other R&D; officials involved in the development of Bon Air were General Thomas M. Logan, Andrew Talcott, and his son, Thomas Mann Randolph Talcott. In addition to these names, other early settlers contributed their names to the roads within the old Bon Air village. Col. Buford is honored by the naming of the thoroughfare Buford Road in Bon Air. Logan Street is named for General Logan. Polk Street is named for Bon Air resident Polk Miller, a pharmacist and highly acclaimed banjo player who founded what became Sergeant's Pet Care Products while creating treatments for his favorite hunting dog, Sergeant. Other prominent residents included Dr. Hunter McGuire who was affiliated with the Medical College of Virginia and several other important hospitals and medical schools (and for whom McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center in Richmond was named), his wife Mary Stuart McGuire, and their 10 children, many of whom also went into the field of medicine. The 1881‚Äì82 Stick style annex for the Bon Air Hotel, which survived the fire that destroyed the main hotel in 1889. In 1889, the tract (with an antebellum farmhouse which was earlier known as \\"The Old Burton Place\\") was purchased by J.R.F. Burroughs, a Confederate civil war veteran from Lynchburg, (then in Campbell County), and his wife Lucy. A childless couple, a few years later the Burroughs opened an orphanage which was originally called \\"The Home for Friendless Children\\", and was incorporated in 1898. Religiously devout, the couple never solicited for funds for the orphanage, but there are tales of the support they received anyway. When Mr. Burroughs died in 1915, he was buried at a site now surrounded by neighboring apartments, where his tombstone reads \\"Faithful unto Death\\". Burroughs Street in Bon Air was named for the couple. Rail continued to serve as the primary means of transportation to and from Bon Air until the automobile era. The original Southern Railway Station was a building brought to Bon Air from the International Cotton Exposition which had been held in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1881. (This station was replaced in 1917, and portions of the original station were used in an old home on the south side of the tracks, still existent in 2005). Other early stops in the Bon Air area include \\"The Steps\\", located on the north side of the tracks near the current Buford Road Bridge, a stop for the Bon Air Inn south of the Inn site on Burroughs Street, and a stop near the current subdivision of Woodmont for the Wherry Farm. This latter station was the only private station on this section of the railroad and was known as Lee Park. The early railroad alignment through Bon Air may have been to take advantage of a kaolin clay mine said to have been located on the south side of the tracks near the current Buford Road bridge. A plant built in Manchester to process the clay from Bon Air burned before it could go into production, ending the project. Village period Southern Railway about west of Manchester (which agreed to merge with the City of Richmond in 1909) and west of Granite in Chesterfield County, Virginia In the 20th century, as the residential area around Richmond grew, Bon Air evolved into a middle-class neighborhood, occupied year round versus just being a summer resort. The oldest lending Library in Chesterfield County was built in 1902 by the Bon Air Association as a Memorial to Dr. James K. Hazen, minister of Bon Air Presbyterian Church and a literary and educational leader of the community. In 1911, the new Westham Bridge crossed the James River between Henrico County and Chesterfield County about upstream from Richmond. Built as a toll bridge, it was named for the nearby Westham Station of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1911. The privately owned Westham Bridge was financed by a group headed by developer George Craghead Gregory, who resided at Granite Hall, an estate about a mile from Williams Dam, where he had a mansion erected which was faced with stone quarried nearby. Gregory was also involved with plans to extend a streetcar line from an existing line at Westhampton Park (now the University of Richmond) to Bon Air, which he saw as becoming a \\"bedroom community\\" of Richmond. Between the James River and Bon Air, Gregory controlled large land areas along the proposed rail line which he hoped to develop. However, despite his plans, aside from grading of right-of-way all the way from the Westham Bridge to Bon Air, Gregory's planned streetcar line did not materialize. This may have been due to weight issues at the Westham Bridge and/or right-of-way matters in Henrico County. However, portions of the planned and partially improved route can be seen in modern times with the gentle slopes found on present-day Southampton Road and along Mohawk Drive. After Burroughs died in 1915, the Bethany Home was taken over by others, including Bon Air Presbyterian Church, until the home closed for good during the 1940s. Over a thousand children had known the farm as \\"home\\", maintaining an average of 50 boys and girls at a time. After 1933, State Route 147 was routed across the Westham Bridge. It connected River Road and Westham Parkway in Henrico with Southampton Road and the new Huguenot Road in Chesterfield. In 1950, the Westham Bridge, which had been subject to flooding and was inadequate for traffic in the growing suburban area, was replaced by the new Huguenot Memorial Bridge (named in honor of the French Huguenot settlers who came to the area in the eighteenth century to escape religious persecution in France). The old bridge was dismantled, but the abutments were still visible at each end, and overhead power and telephone lines continued to mark the route for many years. Traces of the old streetcar right-of-way may be seen along gently sloped Southampton Road and Mohawk Drive near Forest Hill Avenue (which was formerly known as Granite Road), and on Logan Street and Hazen Street in Bon Air, where a washboard surface was long rumored by local lore to be the remnants of the streetcar project. Gregory's old mansion, Granite Hall, now located in the Cherokee Estates subdivision near Williams Dam, was still in use as a private residence in 2008. The C&O;'s Westham Station was relocated to a Richmond city park at Robin Hood Road and Hermitage Road in 1961. 1950s Suburban Development Boom  { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Southside Plaza (1958)\\", \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"-letter-see\\"}, \\"geometry\\": {\\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [-77.47655153274536, 37.50216800393298]} }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Cloverleaf Mall (1972)\\", \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"-letter-see\\"}, \\"geometry\\": {\\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [-77.52811431884766, 37.49896760729101]} }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Chesterfield Mall (1978)\\", \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"-letter-see\\"}, \\"geometry\\": {\\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [-77.60866641998291, 37.507853476646744]} }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Stony Point Fashion Park (2003)\\", \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"-letter-see\\"}, \\"geometry\\": {\\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [-77.56935596466064, 37.5499873691089]} }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Brandermill(1977)\\", \\"marker- symbol\\": \\"-letter-see\\"}, \\"geometry\\": {\\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [-77.65548706054686, 37.45714557062557]} }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {\\"title\\": \\"SR-288 bridge (2004)\\", \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"-letter-see\\"}, \\"geometry\\": {\\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [-77.6846694946289, 37.57750788488201]} }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Powhite Parkway extension (1988)\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"LineString\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ [-77.52777099609375, 37.52606450059144], [-77.56210327148436, 37.49447320172351], [-77.59265899658202, 37.46477609130588], [-77.63729095458984, 37.46096092829945] ]} } ]} By the mid-1950s, Bon Air experienced a suburban population boom. The Bon Air Shopping center was built at Buford and Forest Hill Ave, and subdivisions like Crestwood Farms, Highland Hills, Brighton Green, and Brookwood Estates welcomed new residents. The burgeoning population also resulted in infrastructure and civic amenities being built. Bon Air's elementary school was already in its second home, but most high school students had to travel to Manchester or Midlothian high schools. In the 1960s, a new high school and later a middle school were built by Chesterfield County Public Schools on part of the former Bethany home property. Huguenot High School opened on September 6, 1960. The first principal was G. H. (Gurney Holland) Reid, a longtime principal of Manchester High School, for whom G. H. Reid Elementary School in another section of the county had been named. A fourteen classroom addition was completed around 1964. G. H. Reid retired at the end of the 1968‚Äì69 school year, the last before the city annexed the land occupied by the school the following January 1. Also on the former Burroughs land, Fred D. Thompson Middle School, named for a long-time county educator, was completed in 1965, and was one of the first county schools feature central air conditioning. The Southern Railway ended commuter service to Richmond in 1957, and the Bon Air station was dismantled. In 1967 Chesterfield County began to operate the Hazen Library and moved the location in 1975, according to a plaque on the building. 1970 Richmond-Chesterfield annexation A portion of what was then considered Bon Air was annexed by the City of Richmond in 1970. In the Bon Air area, Huguenot High School, Thompson Middle School, and J.B. Fisher Elementary School (named for a Midlothian-area physician) were among approximately a dozen schools, support buildings, and future school sites conveyed to the City of Richmond along with of territory as the result of a compromise negotiated during the annexation suit by the City of Richmond against Chesterfield County in the late 1960s. The annexation became effective January 1, 1970. The original Bon Air Elementary School and the newer building and Bon Air Primary School were allowed to remain in the county.  1970s - present: Additional Suburbanization and Historic Preservation of Bon Air When Chippenham Parkway was built, construction severed the old Warwick Road route in the mid-1960s when it was built between present-day Jahnke Road and Midlothian Turnpike. As Bon Air became increasingly suburbanized, Mary Anne Claflin published a 144-page book documenting Bon Air called \\"Bon Air: A History\\" in 1977,https://www.amazon.com/Bon-Air-Mary-Anne-Claflin/dp/B0006WOP0S the Bon Air Historical Society was founded in 1978, and in 1988 the society assisted in generating an application for the Bon Air Historic District submitted to the National Register of Historic Places.https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/VLR_to_transfer/PDFNoms/020-5084_Bon_Air_Historic_District_1988_Final_Nomination.pdf In 1987, The traffic patterns changed when the Powhite Parkway Extension cut across southern Bon Air from Chippenham Parkway to Jahnke Road on Midlothian Turnpike. Further, when the Willey Bridge opened in 1988 near Bon Air, Southsiders had significantly improved ability to access the West End of Richmond. In 1985, the Stony Point Shopping Center opened, anchored by a Ukrops store. The 1990s, Arboretum and The Boulders office park developments popped up south of Bon Air, and the Shoppes at Bellgrade (northwest of Bon Air) opened in 1990. The Stony Point Fashion Park opened in 2004, which competed with other retail centers and malls (Chesterfield Town Center and Cloverleaf Mall) nearby to Bon Air. Bon Air In the 2000s The Bon Air \\"Hazen Memorial\\" Library was built 1902 to honor Rev. Hazen, an early intellectual and community leader in Bon Air. The library building was used until Chesterfield County built a new Bon Air library in 1975. The Hazen House decayed and saw little use until it was privately restored in the 2010s. It now operates as a private museum. While remnants of the 1916 village-era post office, 1902 Hazen Library, and Hotel Grounds (currently the Bon Air Community Association) still linger at the intersection of Rockaway and McRae Roads, current day \\"Old Town\\" Bon Air is generally not a tourism attraction. The privately owned and restored Hazen House Library contains artifacts from Bon Air's history but is open only by appointment. While one can drive by numerous 1880s era houses on Buford Road that show an architectural style signature of the Bon Air resort era, these are all private dwellings that do not regularly offer access to the public. The \\"historic\\" bridge built over the railroad tracks by the Bon Air Historical Society enable one to look out over existing railroad tracks and see where \\"the Steps\\" once disembarked train visitors to the Bon Air Hotel, but most actual evidence of the train era in Bon Air has all but disappeared. The Bon Air Historical Society and Chesterfield County Parks and Recreation Department do offer infrequent tours of the resort era houses, and once a year, Bon Air residents and cultural institutions celebrate Bon Air's resort era history by hosting a \\"Victorian Days\\" community parade and general celebration on the first weekend in May. Bon Air is largely a residential bedroom community surrounded by suburban shopping centers. In some cases, these shopping centers house independent businesses (butchers, coffee shops, restaurants) that are spinoffs from downtown Richmond's thriving independent business and restaurant scene. As families from the Fan District and other Richmond neighborhoods leave the city in search of a better school system and affordable housing, many settle in the inner suburb of Bon Air with 10-minute access to the city or the West End via the Powhite Parkway and/ or Chippenham Parkway. Geography Bon Air is located at (37.519947, ‚àí77.568768). The elevation is . The community is located in the Eastern Standard time zone.

Potential Closure  In the late 2010s, the Commonwealth of Virginia began a process of Juvenile Prison reform with expertise from the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The program involves closing youth prisons and using the savings to built and support more localized rehabilitative programs across the state.https://www.wvtf.org/post/juvenile-justice-reform-shows- progress-virginia The Central Admission and Placement (CAP) unit was established upon the closure of the Reception and Diagnostic Center (RDC), BAJCC is the last of the state youth prisons, and in 2018 Governor Northam's administration is attempting to close the state-owned 420-acre facility by building other regional facilities. This would eventually free the Bon Air property for development or conservation.https://ideastations.org/radio/news/state-recommends-five-sites- central-virginia-new-youth-prison the closure plan has been contingent upon identifying these smaller locations, but attempts to build a 60-bed facility in Chesapeake and near Isle of Wight County have met local resistance. In late March 2019, the Commonwealth of Virginia's negotiations with the Isle of Wight board of Supervisors over funding seemed to cast doubt on the plan to build in Isle of Wight. Soon after, Andrew K. Block Jr. (the architect of Virginia's Juvenile Justice Reform initiative) announced he would be stepping down effective April 19 to be replaced by Valerie Boykin (previously deputy director of community programs at the juvenile justice department). On April 5, 2019, DJJ and Isle of Wight reached an provisional agreement to split funding of several costs that had held up the deal. The Isle of Wight Board of Supervisors was to take a final up/down vote on the measure April 18 on whether to transfer 20 acres of farmland to the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice in order to construct the $13.5 million facility. On Thursday April 18, the Isle of Wight Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 to reject the plan, leaving the closure of Bon Air in limbo. RISE for Youth, a Richmond based advocacy organization, had also pushed heavily against the Isle of Wight project. as well as previous efforts to build a similar facility in Chesapeake, Virginia.

Because of this story, and a rowdy tavern nearby, the area was first given the informal name of \\"Battle Town\\". Hite sold the tract in 1765 to his son-in-law, Major Charles Smith. Smith named his estate \\"Battle Town\\", and on the site of the former tavern he built a clapboard homestead. This structure still stands on what is now Main Street and is now known as \\"The Nook\\". Daniel Morgan returned to the area after distinguishing himself in the Revolution, living at Saratoga, and briefly at Soldier's Rest. He was one of the frequent (and reputedly most quarrelsome) patrons of the new tavern (where now stands the Battletown Inn).

Town history =Incorporation The town of Boyce was incorporated by the Circuit Court for the County of Clarke on the 28th day of November, 1910, with a recorded population of 312. The first election for mayor and four councilmen was held on the 20 December 1910, at which W. M. Gaunt was elected Mayor and George W. Garvin, M. O. Simpson, J. T. Sprint and Geo. B. Harrison were elected Councilmen; and the Council duly organized on the 24th day of December, 1910, and elected Geo. B. Harrison, Recorder. Railroad Former Boyce Railroad Station The Norfolk & Western Railway passes through the center of the business portion of the town, which at the time of the building of the railroad in 1881 was dense woods. The Norfolk & Western Railway erected a large station in the town in 1912. The Shenandoah Valley Railroad (known as the Norfolk and Western for many years, now known as the Norfolk Southern) was constructed in Clarke County in 1879. It started in Hagerstown, Maryland, and went south to Roanoke, Virginia. The railroad opened from Hagerstown to Berryville on October 1, 1879. The town of Boyce, located southwest of Berryville, began in 1881 with the arrival of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. Located at the railroad crossing with the Millwood Turnpike, Boyce remains much as it was in the early 20th century. The town was named after Colonel Upton L. Boyce, who lived at the nearby Tuleyries estate and who was very influential in persuading the railroad to pass through Clarke County. Previous to the current railroad station, there was a much smaller one located on the same side of the tracks but right along the Millwood Turnpike. The railroad was apparently upgrading some of their railroad stations during the early 1910s and were going to replace the original station in Boyce. The new building was to be a small wooden one, and sit along the west side of the tracks at its intersection with the Millwood Turnpike. According to local tradition and some historical accounts, the citizens of Boyce (and neighboring Millwood) wanted a larger, more ornate building and also wanted it to be located on the east side of the tracks. They apparently raised money on their own and gave it to the Norfolk and Western to upgrade to a larger station. A December 11, 1912, article in The Clarke Courier entitled \\"New Depot for Boyce\\" states: \\"The public spirit of the citizens of Boyce has again scored a victory. Some time ago the N & W Railway Company announced that it would erect a new passenger station at Boyce. \\"The plans submitted by the railway company did not entirely suit the Boyce people, and they at once started a movement to secure a better piece of ground in order that a more pretentious station might be erected. \\"The old buildings have been removed from the Page-Manning lot, and work on a new and commodious passenger station, of concrete construction, will be started at once. \\"This is the spirit which builds cities. \\"The Boyce people are quick to go down in their pockets and contribute to any and every cause which will advance their town....\\" Boyce Railroad Station The train station was completed in late 1913. A November 26, 1913, article in The Clarke Courier states: \\"The new N & W station, with fine concrete platforms, and promenade, long train shed, electric-lighted throughout, with all modern conveniences for the comfort of patrons, is a great addition to the town.\\" In a December 23, 1914, article in The Clarke Courier, entitled \\"The Hustling Town of Boyce,\\" the railroad station is described: \\"...water is now piped to the magnificent railroad station. The handsome railroad station of tile and concrete construction with its of train shed, and of concrete platform, with its of grounds and tracks, is a noble response by the officials of the railway to the requests of our people, and furnishes ample railroad facilities.\\" In 1913, George B. Harrison, a town councilman, wrote about Boyce and described the train station in the following manner: \\"The Norfolk and Western Railway in kind response to the request of the community has erected a magnificent station of latest design and material with spacious grounds and facilities, fully equipped and provided with electric light and water.\\" Undeniably, the Boyce train station is a surprisingly large building for a community the size of Boyce. It was much bigger than the Berryville (county seat) station, constructed at about the same time. The reason for such an elegant station can probably be attributed to the wealth of many of the local citizens around Boyce and Millwood. Early in the twentieth century, Clarke County experienced an influx of wealthy settlers from the west and north. They were drawn to the county because of the presence of fox hunting, cheap land, and good climate. Many purchased older homes and restored them. Horsebreeding and cattle raising became very popular. The local citizenry of Boyce and Millwood wanted a more elegant train station than what the N & W initially proposed, and they wanted it larger because they were transporting thoroughbreds and cattle on it. The Boyce Railroad Station is thus an example of a rare instance where the citizens of the community wanted a larger and more pretentious facility than what the railroad company was willing to provide, and helped to fund the construction of the building themselves. It appears that the N&W; owned the building, although there is a metal sign on the central part of the station's polygonal bay that identifies its location as \\"H-461-A\\" and one that says \\"Not N&W;\\". According to oral tradition, this means that the N & W did not own the building. However, when Mr. Kenneth Gilpin, Jr., purchased the building in the 1950s, he bought it from the Norfolk and Western. Since then the building has conveyed through several owners. The land on which the building sits, however, is still owned by the railway and is only leased to the owner of the building. In recent years, several of the more substantial railroad stations on the Norfolk and Southern line in the Lower Shenandoah Valley have been demolished. The Boyce train station is thus one of a few surviving examples of a large and elegant station in this pan of Virginia. It is definitely the finest surviving one in Clarke County, as the Berryville station was demolished in the late 1980s. Not only is the Boyce train station a reminder of the influence of the railroad on this area, it is a testament to the hard work of the local citizens who partially paid for its construction.Maral S.

In addition to the public well, the town owns the electric plant and a lot on the railway in the centre of the town, and has added thereto an alternating current plant with ninety kilowatt dynamo, so as to meet any possible demand for light or power; a switch will bring the coal to the power-house. Churches In 1914, the town contained an Episcopal and a Methodist church, and a Baptist parsonage (the Episcopal church being electrically lighted); a brick high school with seven teachers and an enrollment of about two hundred scholars; a brick bank with a capital of $15,000; a hotel and two livery stables; one pinning mill and two lumber yards; two grain elevators; nine stores-one being a department store; a butcher shop; a harness shop; and a barber shop. Adjoining the town is a large cattle plant, and the town is a large stock-shipping station. Including the then-incorporated town of Millwood, the population of the two towns was computed to be about eight or nine hundred.History of Clarke County, Virginia - Its Connection with the War between the States - With Illustrations of Colonial Homes and of Confederate Officers.

History After establishing Culpeper County, Virginia in 1748, the Virginia House of Burgesses voted to establish the Town of Fairfax on February 22, 1759. The name honored Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1693‚Äì1781) who was proprietor of the Northern Neck peninsula, a vast domain north of the Rappahannock River; his territory was then defined as stretching from Chesapeake Bay to what is now Hampshire County, West Virginia. Culpeper Courthouse under the Confederate rule, August 1862 The original plan of the town called for ten blocks, which form the core of Culpeper's downtown area today. The original town was surveyed by a young George Washington, who at age 27 was a protege of the 6th Lord Fairfax. In 1795, the town received a U.S. Post Office under the name Culpeper Court House, although most maps continued to show the Fairfax name. The confusion resulting from the difference in official and postal names, coupled with the existence to the northeast of Fairfax Court House and Fairfax Station post offices in Fairfax County, was finally resolved when the Virginia General Assembly formally renamed the town as simply Culpeper in 1869 (Acts, 1869‚Äì1870, chapter 118, page 154). During the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), the Culpeper Minutemen, a pro- Independence militia, formed in the town of Culpeper Courthouse. They organized in what was then known as \\"Clayton's Old Field,\\" near today's Yowell Meadow Park. During the Civil War (1861-1865), Culpeper was a crossroads for a number of armies marching through central Virginia, with both Union and Confederate forces occupying the town by turn. In the heart of downtown, the childhood home of Confederate General A.P. Hill stands at the corner of Main and Davis streets. One block north on Main Street (present location of Piedmont Realty) was the frame house where \\"The Gallant Major\\" John Pelham died after sustaining a wound at the Battle of Kelly's Ford. In 1974, the town had a Choral Society, an Odd Fellows Hall, and an American Legion Hall. Culpeper began to grow dramatically in the 1980s, becoming a \\"bedroom community\\" of more densely populated Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. suburbs. A growing number of residents of the town and county of Culpeper once lived and continue to work in those areas. In 2011, East Davis Street in downtown Culpeper was named as a 2011 America's Great Place by the American Planning Association. Downtown Culpeper was one of the communities most affected by the August 23, 2011 Virginia earthquake. Several buildings along Main Street and East Davis Street suffered structural damage, and some were later condemned. The earthquake led to the temporary evacuation of the Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation, which at the time was hosting a town hall event for U.S. Senator Mark Warner.

The population was 498 at the 2010 census, up from 186 at the 2000 census, over which time period the town's area tripled. The pronunciation of the final syllable is that of \\"sigh\\". History Haysi is located at the confluence of Russell Prater Creek, the McClure River, and the Russell Fork river. The area where Haysi is located used to be known as \\"The Mouth of McClure\\". As late as 1911, Haysi was only sparsely populated and was often referred to as a laurel bed. The first store was constructed within the present town limits of Haysi by Paris Charles for workers of the Yellow Popular Lumber Company. Haysi began to grow with the construction of the Clinchfield Railroad between 1912 and 1915 as stores sprang up to serve the railroad workers. The railroad was constructed to export natural resources such as timber and coal from the area, and thus later growth of the town centered on workers for the coal mines which began operating around 1916. However, businesses in the town also accommodated travelers, as the rail system was a popular form of transportation at the time, and Haysi was located on a line of the Clinchfield that linked eastern Kentucky with northeast Tennessee, western North Carolina, and South Carolina. Notable early businesses included the McClure Bottling Company, Inc. (established 1914) and the Haysi Supply Company (established 1916). By 1920 Haysi businesses included a hotel, bank, hardware store, and various other retail merchants. By 1930 Main Street was lined with businesses, and the town was incorporated on February 17, 1936. Local folklore says that in the pioneer days, prior to the establishment of bridges, a ferry boat operator named Si (Silas) shuttled people across the water in that area. It is said that when one arrived at the river and found the ferry on the opposite bank, it was common to shout \\"Hey Si!\\" to capture his attention and request passage. Thus, the town which grew around the location of this ferry service became known as \\"Haysi\\". The myth concerning the town's origins is popular and widely accepted among area residents, but local historians dispute this explanation. The name Haysi is said to have originated from a post office established at a general store owned by Charles M. Hayter and Otis L. Sifers. The owners chose Haysi as a blend of their own surnames when it was necessary to provide a name to the U.S. Post Office. Geography Haysi is located in northeastern Dickenson County.

The population was 23,643 at the 2010 census. Bailey's Crossroads lies at the \\"crossroads\\" of State Route 7 (Leesburg Pike) and State Route 244 (Columbia Pike). Etymology Bailey's Crossroads draws its name from the Bailey family of circus fame, which has long been connected with the community. Hachaliah Bailey, one of America's first circus showmen, resided here. In 1808, while still in New York state, he purchased an Indian elephant which was one of the first such animals to reach the United States. Seeking a place to winter his circus animals, he moved to Virginia, and on December 19, 1837, he bought a tract of land on the outskirts of Falls Church including what is now the intersection of Leesburg Pike and Columbia Pike. On this tract he built a large house known as \\"Bailey's Mansion\\" or \\"Moray;\\" it was reputed to have contained 100 rooms. The mansion sat at a location now known as Durbin Place. It abutted Glenforest Drive, the oldest outlet road to Leesburg Pike. Circuses were part of the Bailey family business. Hachaliah's son Lewis Bailey (1795-1870) operated a travelling circus and pioneered the use of canvas circus tents before eventually settling in 1840 to farm land in Bailey's Crossroads. Hachaliah's nephew George F. Bailey managed several shows, too, designing a tank in which a hippopotamus could be moved from place to place. Another nephew, Fred Harrison Bailey, recognized a potential circus talent in James Anthony McGuiness, later James Anthony Bailey, who united the Cooper and Bailey with Phineas Taylor Barnum's circus to form the Barnum and Bailey Circus, which later joined with the Ringling Brothers Circus to form the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus. Perhaps the first of the Northerners to settle permanently in Fairfax County to farm was Lewis Bailey, an upstate New Yorker and the son of Hachaliah Bailey, who followed his father south. In 1837, the elder Bailey bought hundreds of acres of Fairfax land, much of it on the outskirts of present-day Arlington County in the area now known as Baileys Cross Roads. Shortly afterward, Lewis Bailey bought of land from his father for ten dollars an acre. Included in the purchase was \\"a good dwelling-house,\\" but there were \\"no other buildings of value, and little or no fence.\\" The farm itself, he wrote later, consisted of \\"cultivated worn-out lands, too poor to produce a crop of grass, or pay for cultivation without manure.\\" Some of Bailey's neighbors considered the farm the poorest in the vicinity. When he built his first small barn, twenty-four by thirty-six feet, they asked him if he \\"ever expected to fill it.\\" The question was scarcely a jest, for Bailey did not make enough hay the first year \\"to winter two horses.\\" Nevertheless, the purchase was a wise one. Within a decade Bailey had a fine herd of dairy cattle and had become one of the more prosperous farmers in the area.Fairfax County, Virginia A History The Baileys were prominent members of the Dulin Methodist Church, and intermarried with many Falls Church people  History  A historical marker in Bailey's Crossroads Hachaliah Bailey (the founder of one of America's earliest circuses, which in time evolved into the Bailey component of what became the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus) moved to Northern Virginia in 1837, bought the land surrounding the intersection of Leesburg Pike and Columbia Pike in Fairfax County, Virginia near Falls Church, Virginia, and gave Bailey's Crossroads his name. The Crossroads then became the winter quarters for his circus.‚ÄúSkyline House ‚Äî The History of Bailey's Crossroads (Adapted from a History by Susan Flinner)\\". Falls Church, Virginia: SHUOA: Skyline House Unit Owners Association. June 2, 2014. https://web.archive.org/web/20160323093719/http://www.shuoa.org/community/historybaileys.html Civil War The opening months of the American Civil War proved to be a disruptive and unforgettable episode in the history of Bailey's Crossroads. From the summer of 1861, when the area fell into an uncomfortable and poorly defined \\"no man's land\\" between the borders of two warring countries, until late November of that year, when the area hosted a massive troop review, anything akin to normalcy was in short supply. Virginia voted to secede from the Union on May 23, 1861. Fairfax County's northern-born residents‚Äîmany of whom were its most prominent and prosperous citizens‚Äînow felt very uncomfortable. Their southern neighbors looked upon them with suspicion. In July 1861 the Union Army met with catastrophic defeat during the First Battle of Manassas. The army retreated all the way to Washington, with the Confederate Army advancing quickly behind it. The Confederates occupied Falls Church and Munson's Hill, overlooking Bailey's Crossroads, and the crossroads' northern-born residents fled for the safety of Washington.Gernand, A Virginia Village Goes to War, pp. 16-17, 23, 68-69. Once Confederates established themselves atop Munson's Hill they built a crude fort there, and from these commanding heights turned Bailey's Crossroads into a \\"killing field\\". Southern sharpshooters killed numerous Union soldiers. Violence arose whenever Confederate and Union pickets, or scouts, engaged one another in firefights. It was now impossible to walk the Leesburg Pike without being shot and killed.Gernand, A Virginia Village Goes to War, p. 83. There was a minor engagement between the sides on Tuesday, September 3, 1861, with the Union suffering 8 casualties and the Confederates none. And further, the official reports on the 'War of the Rebellion' indicate that during August 28‚Äì30 of 1861 a series of skirmishes took place at a location scrawled as \\"Balley's Cross Roads\\". The local balance of power changed completely‚Äîand to everyone's surprise‚Äîon September 28, 1861 as the Confederate Army silently withdrew its forces from Munson's Hill, Upton's Hill and Falls Church to Manassas, which they fortified. Munson's Hill and Falls Church were located too far afield of reliable supply lines, and a concerted Union pincer movement could possibly choke off supplies, the Southern command believed. At Manassas they were adjacent to Virginia's interior, and had good railroad and road connections to it.Gernand, A Virginia Village Goes to War, pp. 98-101. After Confederate withdrawal the area quickly was reoccupied by Union troops. A significant troop review took place at Bailey's Crossroads on November 20, 1861. Thousands of Union troops marched in formation and paraded before President Abraham Lincoln, the northern press, and many onlookers from Washington. Army commanders selected Bailey's Crossroads as the site because of its nature as a large, unbroken plain. In order to prepare it for the day's activities the army merely needed to remove the split-rail fencing separating farms and fields.Gernand, A Virginia Village Goes to War, pp. 169-171. During recent years local historians have confused this review with another, smaller review held on nearby Upton's Hill, where events spurred the composition and publication of the Battle Hymn of the Republic. Modern era Bailey's Crossroads windmill After the Civil War Bailey's Crossroads returned to its pastoral pre-war pursuits. The area remained a rural farming community until the post-World War II years, when a massive wave of development occurred. Leesburg Pike is now a commercial corridor, with apartments and homes to its north and south. A strip shopping center called Culmore, in particular, has lent its name to the apartment development behind it, which is now home to several thousand Latino immigrants. \\"Culmore\\" is now an established place name within Bailey's Crossroads.\\"Preserving the Public Square--Hispanics Oppose Drug Store Proposal\\", Washington Times, December 7, 1999; \\"Falls Church's Image Problem\\", Falls Church News-Press, July 14, 2005. Close behind Culmore is Lake Barcroft, whose shore is lined with upscale middle-class homes. During the 1960s, as Washington's Metro system was being conceived, original plans called for a subway line to extend under Columbia Pike to and through Bailey's Crossroads. As a result of the plan a massive highrise complex was built on the former Washington-Virginia Airport in the heart of Bailey's Crossroads called Skyline City. Its location coincided with the planned locations of Metro stations. Plans for the Metro, however, changed. The western line was placed along the I-66 corridor instead. Geography Bailey's Crossroads is located at (38.849474, -77.129093). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 2.0 square miles (5.3 km2), all of it land. The area occupies a broad, flat plain, bounded on the west by Munson's Hill. This unbroken expanse of level ground caused the Union Army to select it as the site of a massive review of troops during the Civil War. The review, which took place on November 20, 1861 involved thousands of troops marching in formation and parading before President Abraham Lincoln.Bradley E. Gernand, A Virginia Village Goes to War--Falls Church During the Civil War. Virginia Beach: The Donning Company, 2002. Pages 139-141. Bailey's Crossroads is formed by the junction of State Route 7 connecting Alexandria, Virginia with the Shenandoah Valley and State Route 244 (Columbia Pike) connecting the Pentagon and Washington, D.C., with Annandale, Virginia. The most noticeable landmark at Bailey's Crossroads is Skyline Center, a towering group of 26-story apartment buildings and offices built in the 1970s. A branch of Northern Virginia Community College, and offices of the U.S. Department of Defense are nearby. The neighborhood has a large Hispanic population. The largest single store of the entire Giant Food supermarket chain is also there. While the closest Metrorail station is a few miles away, Metrobus service on the Columbia Pike corridor has recently been improved. The precise extent of Bailey's Crossroads has never been defined. As an unincorporated community without local government, it has never had the purview to do so. The United States Census Bureau observes one definition; and various parts of the Fairfax County government observe others. Economic development plans tend to include just the commercial corridors and associated areas. Current discussions among the Fairfax County government for revitalizing Bailey's Crossroads economically concern themselves with the Fairfax County border on the north and east‚Äîwhich generally includes all commercial and residential properties generally considered as belonging to the neighborhood‚Äîas well as Seminary Road and Carlin Spring Road. The plans include a narrow strip along Leesburg Pike to Glen Carlyn Road.\\"Blueprint for Baileys Crossroads is Revived\\", Washington Post, July 8, 2010, p. B4. As a general neighborhood, however, with all facets of life included, the geographic extent of Bailey's Crossroads must be considered to be larger. It abuts the clearly established Lake Barcroft neighborhood on the southwest, with Blair Road, Beachway Drive, Nevius Street and Mansfield Road marking its western proximity. North of Leesburg Pike its extent is generally defined by Glen Carlyn and Carlin Springs roads.  Governance  Fairfax County Public Schools operates public schools. Glen Forest Elementary School is the primary school attended by most children living in the area, and the local schools feed Justice High School. Fairfax County Public Library operates the Woodrow Wilson Library in the Culmore area. It has Spanish-language materials in addition to English-language ones.\\"Library Branches.\\" Fairfax County Public Library.

In 2010, the Bailey's Crossroads Volunteer Fire Department turned the land, the firehouse, and most of the equipment of Fire Station 10 over to the Fairfax County Fire & Rescue Department in exchange for a new facility. Since then, Fire Station 10 has been maintained and operated by the Fairfax County Fire & Rescue Department and is staffed 24/7 by full-time career firefighters and paramedics. The Bailey's Crossroads Volunteer firefighters still own the three medic units housed at the station - the two front line units are maintained and operated by Fairfax County Fire & Rescue, while the third unit is maintained and operated by the volunteers.http://www.bxrvfd.org/about-us.html Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 23,166 people, 8,547 households, and 4,965 families residing in the community.

Nearby CDPs are Huntington (northwest), Groveton (southwest) and Fort Hunt (south). The population of Belle Haven was 6,518 at the 2010 census. The CDP is located just south of Old Town Alexandria and bounded on the west by Richmond Highway (U.S. 1) and on the east by the Potomac River. It encompasses Belle Haven, a wealthy subdivision dating from the 1920s, and several adjoining neighborhoods. Some, particularly New Alexandria and Belle View, are among the lowest-lying residential areas of Fairfax County, and sustained extensive flood damage from storms including 2003's Hurricane Isabel and 1972's Hurricane Agnes. The Belleview branch of the Alexandria Post Office is located here, and serves the 22307 ZIP code in which the majority of the CDP falls. History The name \\"Belle Haven\\" derives from when Scottish pioneers settled along the Potomac River in the early 18th century. They named the settlement after their favorite countryman, the Earl of Belhaven. This early settlement thrived along the Potomac River as a port and was later renamed \\"Alexandria\\". The area later became part of the West Grove Plantation, which was built by Hugh West around 1748. It capitalized on its close and favorable position to the newly forming town of Alexandria.Belle Haven Country Club Historical files The West family was important in Virginia and Fairfax County politics in the 18th century. Hugh West himself was a burgess from Fairfax County, a vestryman, and a trustee of the town of Alexandria. His son, John, followed in his father's footsteps with continued public work until he died in 1777.The Alexandria Gazette. The George Washington Ball map, and various Edith Sprouse articles on local history. The home passed from the West family in 1814 to a Col. Augustine J. Smith, who bought the plantation from the last West, James, who died in 1814. Smith is known to have enlarged the original to over . This included the draining of the swamps along the Potomac River and building a dike. This increased his land holding considerably, but the embankments were cut after his death and never repaired. He is also known for his vast building spree where he had no less than thirteen new buildings built for the much enlarged plantation. These included larger slave quarters for the forty slaves he owned. Smith died in 1830, and after several years the plantation was sold to Dennis Johnston. He did little enlarging to the plantation, still known as West's Grove. He was probably kept busy repairing all of Smith's additions. Johnston died several years before the Civil War, and his widow ran the plantation in his place. In 1862 the 39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (Garibaldi Guard) occupied the plantation and later burned it to the ground, retaliating against the owner's sons for serving as officers on General Robert E. Lee's staff. No house occupied this land again until the first house was built in Belle Haven at 6041 Woodmont Road in 1928. The current Belle Haven residential community had its start in the 1920s when David Howell, a civil engineer from Alexandria, purchased the land from owners Mrs. Thomas Wilfred Robinson, Sr. and her brothers. Upon purchasing the land, Howell set up two corporations, one to construct a golf course and club, and the other to develop a residential subdivision. The golf course and club later became the Belle Haven Country Club, which still exists. Geography Belle Haven is located in eastern Fairfax County at (38.779013, ‚àí77.060721).

He, along with his partner and accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo (aged 17), a native of Kingston, Jamaica, carried out the D.C. sniper attacks of October 2002, killing 10 people. Muhammad and Malvo were arrested in connection with the attacks on October 24, 2002, following tips from alert citizens. Although the pair's actions were classified by the media as psychopathy attributable to serial killer characteristics, whether or not their psychopathy meets this classification or that of a spree killer is debated by researchers. Born as John Allen Williams, Muhammad joined the Nation of Islam in 1987 and later changed his surname to Muhammad. At Muhammad's trial, the prosecutor claimed that the rampage was part of a plot to kill his ex-wife and regain custody of his children, but the judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support this argument. His trial for one of the murders (that of Dean Harold Meyers in Prince William County, Virginia) began in October 2003, and the following month he was found guilty of capital murder. Four months later he was sentenced to death. While awaiting execution in Virginia, in August 2005, he was extradited to Maryland to face some of the charges there. He was convicted of six counts of first- degree murder on May 30, 2006. Upon completion of the trial activity in Maryland, Muhammad was returned to Virginia's death row pending an agreement with another state or the District of Columbia seeking to try him. He was not tried on additional charges in other Virginia jurisdictions and faced potential trials in three other states and the District of Columbia involving other murders and attempted murders. All appeals of his conviction for killing Meyers had been made and rejected. Appeals for Muhammad's other trials remained pending at the time of his execution. Muhammad was executed by lethal injection on November 10, 2009, at 9:06 p.m. EST at the Greensville Correctional Center near Jarratt, Virginia, and was pronounced dead at 9:11 p.m. EST. Muhammad declined to make a final statement. Early life Born John Allen Williams in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Ernest and Eva Williams, he and his family moved to New Orleans when his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer; she died when he was three years old. After his mother's death, his father left. Williams was mainly raised by his maternal grandfather and an aunt. In 1987, at the age of 27, he joined the Nation of Islam. As a member of the Nation of Islam, Muhammad helped provide security for the \\"Million Man March\\" in 1995. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan has publicly distanced himself and his organization from Muhammad's crimes. Muhammad kidnapped his children and took them to Antigua around 1999, apparently engaging in credit card and immigration document fraud. It was during this time that he became close with Lee Boyd Malvo, a Jamaican illegal immigrant who later acted as Muhammad's partner in the killings. Williams changed his name to John Allen Muhammad in October 2001. After his arrest, authorities also claimed that Muhammad admitted that he admired and modeled himself after Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda and approved of the September 11 attacks. Malvo testified that Muhammad had indoctrinated him into believing that the proceeds of an extortion attempt would be used to establish \\"a camp in Canada where homeless children would be trained as terrorists.\\" Muhammad was twice divorced; his second ex-wife, Mildred Muhammad, sought and was granted a restraining order, alleging abuse. Muhammad was arrested on federal charges of violating the restraining order by possessing a weapon. Under federal law, those with restraining orders are prohibited from purchasing or possessing guns, as per the Lautenberg Amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968. Defense attorneys in the Malvo trial and prosecutors in Muhammad's trial argued that the ultimate goal of the Beltway sniper murders was to kill Mildred in order to regain custody of his three children. Military service In August 1978, Muhammad enlisted in the Louisiana Army National Guard at Baton Rouge as a combat engineer. He transferred to the Regular Army on November 6, 1985 and was trained as a mechanic, truck driver and specialist metalworker. He qualified with the Army's standard rifle, the M16, earning the Expert Rifleman's Badge. This is the Army's highest of three levels of basic rifle marksmanship for a soldier. Muhammad's first tour was with the 15th Engineer Battalion at Fort Lewis in 1985. In 1991, he served in the Gulf War with a company that dismantled Iraqi chemical warfare rockets, service for which he received the Southwest Asia Service Medal, the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia) and the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait). In 1992, he was at Fort Ord, California, with the 13th Engineers and in 1993 was back at Fort Lewis with the 14th Engineer Battalion. Muhammad was honorably discharged from the Army with the rank of sergeant on April 24, 1994 after 17 years of service. He received the following awards: Army Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Overseas Ribbon, Noncommissioned Officers Professional Development Ribbon and Army Achievement Medal. Beltway sniper attacks Police followed a lead in which Muhammad or Malvo left a note at one of the shootings to tell the police to investigate a liquor store robbery-murder that had occurred in Montgomery, Alabama. Investigators responding to that crime scene found one of the suspects had dropped a magazine with his fingerprints on it; these were subsequently identified as belonging to Malvo, whose prints were on file with the INS and who was known to associate with Muhammad. They had lived together for around a year in Tacoma, Washington, where Malvo used the alias John Lee Malvo. Muhammad's identification led to the discovery that he had purchased a former police car, a blue Chevrolet Caprice, in New Jersey on September 11, 2002. A lookout broadcast to the public on that vehicle resulted in the arrest of Muhammad and Malvo when the car was spotted parked at an Interstate 70 rest stop in Myersville, Maryland. Criminal case On October 24, 2002, Muhammad was captured in Maryland, where most of the attacks and murders took place. Although Maryland sought to bring him to trial, United States attorney general John Ashcroft reassignedUnited States Department of Justice ‚Äì Statement Of The Attorney General of the United States in re: Jurisdictional Motions of the Several States Seeking Relief For Primary Jurisdiction; Awarding of Jurisdiction to the Commonwealth of Virginia, The Commonwealth's Attorney for Prince William County. the case to the jurisdiction of Paul Ebert, the Commonwealth‚Äôs Attorney for Prince William County, Virginia. Virginia was viewed as more likely to impose a death sentence, which was borne out by the Virginia and Maryland verdicts. Virginia also allowed the death penalty for juveniles. In October 2003, Muhammad went on trial for the murder of Dean Meyers. The crime had occurred in Prince William County, Virginia, near the city of Manassas, Virginia. The trial had been moved from Prince William County to Virginia Beach, approximately 200 miles away. Muhammad was granted the right to represent himself in his defense and dismissed his legal counsel, though he immediately switched back to having legal representation after his opening argument. He was charged with murder, terrorism, conspiracy and the illegal use of a firearm and faced a possible death sentence. Prosecutors said the shootings were part of a plot to extort $10 million from local and state governments. The prosecution said that they would make the case for 16 shootings allegedly involving Muhammad. The terrorism charge against Muhammad required prosecutors to prove he committed at least two shootings in a three- year period. The prosecution called more than 130 witnesses and introduced more than 400 pieces of evidence intended to prove that Muhammad undertook the murders and ordered Malvo to help carry it out. Evidence included a rifle found in Muhammad's car that was linked by ballistics tests to eight of the 10 killings in the Washington area and two others in Louisiana and Alabama; the car , which was modified so that a sniper could shoot from inside the trunk; and a laptop computer, also found in the car, that contained maps with icons pinpointing shooting scenes. Witness accounts put Muhammad across the street from one shooting and his car near the scene of several others. There was also a recorded phone call to a police hotline in which a man, his voice identified by a detective as Muhammad's, demanded money in exchange for stopping the shootings. Muhammad's defense asked the court to drop the capital murder charges because there was no direct evidence. Malvo's fingerprints were on the Bushmaster rifle found in Muhammad's car and DNA from Muhammad was discovered on the rifle, but the defense contended that Muhammad could not be put to death under Virginia's \\"trigger-man law\\" unless he actually pulled the trigger to kill Meyers, and nobody testified that they saw him do so. On November 17, 2003, Muhammad was convicted of all four counts in the indictment against him: capital murder for the shooting of Meyers; capital murder under Virginia's antiterrorism statute for homicide committed with an intent to terrorize the government or the public at large; conspiracy to commit murder; and the illegal use of a firearm. In the penalty phase of the trial, the jury, after five hours of deliberation over two days, unanimously recommended that Muhammad be sentenced to death. On March 9, 2004, a Virginia judge agreed with the jury's recommendation and sentenced John Allen Muhammad to death. On April 22, 2005, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed his death penalty, stating that Muhammad could be sentenced to death because the murder was part of an act of terrorism. The court also rejected an argument by defense lawyers that he could not be sentenced to death because he was not the triggerman in the killings. Virginia Supreme Court Justice Donald W. Lemons said at the time, \\"With calculation, extensive planning, premeditation and ruthless disregard for life, Muhammad carried out his cruel scheme of terror.\\" In May 2005, Maryland and Virginia reached an agreement to allow his extradition to face Maryland charges. He was held at the maximum security Sussex I State Prison near Waverly, Sussex County, Virginia, which houses Virginia's male death row inmates. In August 2005, while awaiting execution in Virginia, he was extradited to Montgomery County, Maryland to face charges there. On May 30, 2006, a Maryland jury found Muhammad guilty of six counts of murder. He was sentenced to six consecutive life terms without possibility of parole on June 1, 2006. Neither Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana nor Washington (state) moved to try Muhammad, given his death sentence for murder in Virginia. In 2006, Malvo confessed that the pair also killed 14 victims in California, Arizona, and Texas. On May 6, 2008, it was revealed that Muhammad asked prosecutors in a letter to help him end legal appeals of his conviction and death sentence \\"so that you can murder this innocent black man.\\" An appeal filed by Muhammad's defense lawyers in April 2008 cited evidence of brain damage that would render Muhammad incompetent to make legal decisions and that he should not have been allowed to represent himself at his Virginia trial. On September 16, 2009, Prince William County Circuit Court Judge Mary Grace O'Brien set Muhammad's execution date for November 10, 2009. On November 9, 2009, Muhammad's petition for review of his death sentence was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court. Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, wrote a separate opinion stating that Virginia's rush to set an execution date \\"highlights once again the perversity of executing inmates before their appeals process has been fully concluded\\" while noting that they concurred with the decision that the appeal ought not be heard. Civil case In 2003, Malvo and Muhammad were named in a civil lawsuit by the Legal Action Project of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence on behalf of two of their victims who were seriously wounded and the families of some of those murdered. Although Malvo and Muhammad were each believed to be indigent, co-defendants Bull's Eye Shooter Supply and Bushmaster Firearms, Inc. contributed to a landmark $2.5 million out-of-court settlement in late 2004. Testimony of Lee Boyd Malvo In Muhammad's May 2006 trial in Montgomery County, Maryland, Malvo, who was sentenced to a term of life without parole for his role in the shootings, confessed to a more detailed version of the pair's plans. After extensive psychological counseling, he admitted that he was lying at the earlier Virginia trial when he had admitted to being the trigger-man for every shooting. He claimed he had done this to try to save Muhammad from a potential death penalty sentence, as Malvo, being a minor, would not face the death penalty. In his two days of testimony, Malvo outlined detailed aspects of all the shootings. Part of his testimony concerned Muhammad's complete plan with three phases in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metro areas. Phase One consisted of meticulously planning, mapping and practicing their locations around the DC area so after each shooting they could quickly leave the area on a predetermined path and continue to the next location. Muhammad's goal in Phase One was to kill six white people a day for 30 days (180 per month). Malvo described how Phase One did not go as planned due to heavy traffic and the lack of a clear shot and/or getaway routes at different locations. Phase Two was meant to be undertaken in Baltimore, but was never carried out. It was to begin with the killing of a pregnant woman by a shot to the abdomen. The next step was to have been the killing of a Baltimore City police officer and, at the officer's funeral, to detonate several improvised explosive devices that contained shrapnel intending to kill a large number of police officers attending the funeral. Phase Three was to take place very shortly after, if not during, Phase Two. It was to extort several million dollars from the United States government. This money would be used to finance a larger plan to travel to Canada, stopping en route at YMCAs and orphanages to recruit impressionable young boys with no parents or guidance. Muhammad thought he could act as their father figure as he had with Malvo. Once he recruited a large number of young boys and arrived in Canada, Muhammad would train the boys with weapons and send them across the United States to carry out mass shootings in many different cities, just as he had done in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. Execution On November 10, 2009, hours before Muhammad's scheduled execution, pleas for clemency made by his attorneys were denied by Virginia Governor Tim Kaine. Under Virginia law, an inmate is allowed to choose the method by which he or she will be put to death, either lethal injection or electrocution. As Muhammad declined to select a method, by law the method of lethal injection was selected for him. He was offered a selection of a last meal, which he accepted. J. Wyndal Gordon, Muhammad's attorney, told the Associated Press that Muhammad's last meal consisted of \\"chicken and red sauce, and ... some cakes\\". Muhammad declined to make a final statement and his execution began at 9:00 p.m. EST at the Greensville Correctional Center, Greensville County, near Jarratt, Virginia. According to the official statement of the prison spokesperson, the actual lethal injection process started at 9:06 pm EST. Muhammad was pronounced dead at 9:11 p.m. EST.Commonwealth of Virginia, Department of Corrections Announcement Of Death Press Conference, as carried on CNN. Muhammad's body was cremated and the ashes given to his son in Louisiana. In film Muhammad is portrayed by Bobby Hosea in the 2003 film D.C. Sniper: 23 Days of Fear, by Ken Foree in the 2010 film D.C. Sniper and by Isaiah Washington in the 2013 film Blue Caprice.

Burke includes two census-designated places: The Burke CDP, population 41,055 in 2010 and the Burke Centre CDP, population 17,326. History Burke is named after Silas Burke (1796‚Äì1854), a 19th-century farmer, merchant, and local politician who built a house on a hill overlooking the valley of Pohick Creek in approximately 1824. The house still stands. When the Orange and Alexandria Railroad was constructed in the late 1840s, the railroad station at the base of that hill was named \\"Burke's Station\\" after Burke, who owned the land in the area and donated a right-of-way to the railroad company. The community that grew up around the railroad station acquired a post office branch in 1852. The railroad tracks located on the same historical line are owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway and form part of the Manassas line of the Virginia Railway Express commuter rail system, which has two stations (Rolling Road and Burke Centre) in the Burke area. The original Burke Station building can still be seen in the community, turned 90 degrees from its historical footprint. Strip mall in Burke During the Civil War, the railway station was garrisoned by Union troops. The Bog Wallow Ambush occurred nearby in 1861. On December 28, 1862, Confederate cavalry under General J.E.B. Stuart raided the station. Stuart seized supplies from the area, destroyed a nearby bridge, monitored Union messages passing over the telegraph lines, and then famously sent a telegram to Union Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs complaining of the poor quality of the mules he had captured. Further action was seen in the neighborhood in 1863. In 1903, Henry C. Copperthite, changed the name of the post office from Burke's Station to \\"Burke\\" after buying the Burke House and to build a racetrack for trotting and pacing horses. In 1914, his factory in Georgetown was producing 50,000 pies a day, earning him the nickname \\"King of Pie\\" and making him the largest non-government employer in Washington, D.C. He built four hotels, stables and expanded the general store in Burke. Burke became a popular summer destination where people could attend fairs, see horse races, foot races, motorcycle races, exhibition boxing and baseball games. Special trains ran to Burke from Union Station in D.C., Alexandria, Prince William and Loudoun counties and as far away as Richmond. Copperthite installed the first phones in Burke, and his stables housed the horses of President McKinley and Vice President Theodore Roosevelt. The site of the racetrack was marked by a historic marker erected by Fairfax County in 2016. The area remained predominantly rural well into the mid-20th century. After World War I, the population grew as federal government workers moved into the area, commuting by train to Washington. In 1951, the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration announced plans to condemn of land in Burke to construct a second airport to serve the Washington metropolitan area. After a lengthy lobbying campaign by area residents, the government in 1958 selected a different site near Chantilly, Virginia, which would become Washington Dulles International Airport. Land that had been purchased to build the airport was later developed into Burke Lake Park and the planned community of Burke Centre. The first large subdivision in the vicinity, Kings Park, was constructed beginning in 1960, and was followed by many others over the next two decades, converting Burke into a densely populated suburban community. A historic marker in Burke denotes the Huldah Coffer House, owned by a prominent resident of the county for many years. Another, privately erected, notes the site of the former Lee Chapel Methodist church, which was purposely burned in 1951 after having been abandoned for some years, but whose cemetery remains on the site.

The population was 71,135 at the 2010 census.U.S. Census website website at factfinder2.census.gov. Accessed 2011-09-09. Centreville is approximately west of Washington, D.C. History=Colonial period Beginning in the 1760s, the area was known as Newgate due to the popularity of the conveniently-located Newgate tavern. William Carr Lane operated the tavern and was co-proprietor of a nearby store with James Lane, Jr.William Carr Lane obtained an ordinary (tavern) license in 1768, Loudoun County Court Order Book of 1768. The Lanes sold convicted servants, which may explain why the tavern had the same name as a London prison.Virginia Gazette, Publisher: Rind, p.2, col.3, 1771-01-17 The small stream that passed near the tavern was named the River Thames, another London association.Town plat, Library of Virginia Another reason for it being named Newgate, was the fact that it was a \\"new gate\\" to the western territories. Federal period The town of Centerville (shortly thereafter spelled Centreville) was established in 1792 on the turnpike road at the village of Newgate by the Virginia General Assembly in response to petitions by local landowners.John Stuart Alexander, and Others, Legislative Petitions, Loudoun County, October 3, 1792, Reel 111, Box 142, Folder 39, Library of Virginia. (Second petition) The petitioners reasoned that a town on the turnpike road leading from the Northwest Territory and centrally located to Alexandria, Colchester, Dumfries, Middleburg, George Town (later Georgetown), Fauquier Court House (later Warrenton), and Leesburg would be convenient. The town acquired its name due to its central location. James Hardage Lane, one of the landowners, conceived the idea of the town as a way to provide financial support to his widow and their children.John Stuart Alexander, and Others, Legislative Petitions, Fairfax County, November 20, 1790, Reel 49, Box 69, Folder 36, Library of Virginia At the town's inception, it was within the boundary of Loudoun County, Virginia, and became part of Fairfax County, Virginia in 1798 when the boundary between the two counties shifted.Sweig, Donald (1992). Fairfax County Virginia: A History. Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, Fairfax, Virginia, p.45. Town development established a pattern of mixed residential and commercial use.

In the Civil War, several battles were fought nearby including the First Battle of Manassas, the Second Battle of Manassas, and the Battle of Chantilly. During the winter of 1861 and early 1862 the town was significantly fortified by the Confederacy and served as a supply depot for both sides at various points in the war, and is famous for being the site of the construction of the first railroad ever built exclusively for military use, the Centreville Military Railroad. Centreville was of significant strategic value due to its proximity to several important roads, while its position atop a high ridge provided a commanding view of the surrounding area. The town was frequently associated with Confederate Colonel John S. Mosby, whose partisan rangers used its hillsides and farms as a base of operations, leading to the sobriquet \\"Mosby's Confederacy\\". Modern In 1943, Centreville was a small town, on a map there were indications of each building in the town. The population growth occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to an influx of companies, businesses, and corporations. Centreville is a modernized city and densely populated.

Drivers heading north on SR 28 are able to exit onto Interstate 66 eastbound, but they must use a one-mile (1.6 km) stretch of US 29 to access the westbound side of the Interstate. Likewise, eastbound Interstate 66's Exit 53 only provides access to SR 28 northbound; one must use Exit 52 and the same stretch of US 29 to reach SR 28 south.Layla Wilder, Loudoun Times, Frey OKs Route 28 median 12 April 2007; accessed 13 October 2007 The area is served by several Fairfax Connector bus routes connecting to the Metrorail system: 640, 641, 642.

The population was 23,039 at the 2010 census. Chantilly is named after an early-19th-century mansion and farm, which in turn took the name of an 18th-century plantation that was located in Westmoreland County, Virginia. The name \\"Chantilly\\" originated in France with the Ch√¢teau de Chantilly,Hagemann, James A. (1988) The Heritage of Virginia: The Story of Place Names in the Old Dominion. The Donning Co., 297 p. about 25 miles north of Paris. Located in the Northern Virginia portion of the Washington metropolitan area, Chantilly sits approximately west of Washington, D.C., via Interstate 66 and U.S. Route 50. It is located between Centreville to the south, Herndon and Reston to the north and northeast, respectively, and Fairfax to the southeast. U.S. Route 50 and Virginia State Route 28 intersect in Chantilly, and these highways provide access to the Dulles/Reston/Tysons Corner technology corridor and other major employment centers in Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. History Chantilly was home to a number of colonial plantations in the 1700s, including the Sully Plantation (now the Sully Historic Site) built by Richard Bland Lee I. Other plantations included George Richard Lee Turberville's \\"Leeton Grove\\" (originally a 5,000+ acre plantation, the main house of which still stands at 4619 Walney Rd.), the John Hutchison Farm, and the Chantilly Plantation, after which Chantilly is named. Cornelia Lee Turberville Stuart, who was born at Leeton and was the daughter of George Richard Lee Turberville and Henrietta Lee, inherited a portion of Leeton in 1817 from her father. Stuart and her husband Charles Calvert Stuart, whom she had married in 1816, constructed the Chantilly Plantation and named it after the Westmoreland County plantation owned by her grandfather, Richard Henry Lee, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. During the Civil War, federal troops destroyed by fire the Chantilly Plantation manor house. One building remains, a stone house across Route 50 from the Greenbriar Shopping Center. While it is not clear what this stone house was used for, most historical evidence suggests it was probably a plantation overseer's quarters during the antebellum period, and a tavern or boarding house following the war. After the war, Cornelia Stuart, who had become deeply in debt, sold her Chantilly estate. The advertisement for the sale referenced several \\"tenements\\", one of which was the Stone House. The village grew during the 19th century, particularly following the construction of the Little River Turnpike to Winchester. The evolution of the Chantilly area into an outer suburb of Washington, D.C., gained momentum after 1980, as developers built residential subdivisions and commercial areas, filling in the farmland south of Dulles Airport. File:Chantilly VA Historical Marker.jpgHistoric marker commemorating Old Chantilly Farm House File:FallHouse.JPGalt=FallHouse.JPGSully Plantation (Sully Historic Site) Main House File:Chantilly VA Historic Building.jpgThe Stone House. The only building of the former Chantilly Plantation (not to be confused with the Sully Plantation) that still exists today. It is located on the north side of Route 50, across from the Greenbriar Shopping Center. Historical evidence strongly suggests the Stone House was an overseer's quarters before the Civil War, and became a tavern later. Civil War During the Civil War, Chantilly stretched to the intersection of West Ox Road and Monument Drive, shown in this original map of the Battle of Chantilly at the \\"GAP\\" between the two railroad grades to the immediate southeast of \\"A.P. Hill\\" During the American Civil War on September 1, 1862, the Battle of Chantilly (or Ox Hill) was fought nearby. Following his victory at the Second Battle of Bull Run (or Second Manassas), Confederate General Robert E. Lee directed Major General Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson to cross Bull Run on August 31 and sweep around the position of Major General John Pope's Union Army of Virginia at Centreville. Reaching the Little River Turnpike (now U.S. Route 50) northwest of Centreville, Jackson turned southeastward toward Fairfax Court House (now the city of Fairfax) to strike in rear of Pope's army. During September 1, Pope, apprised of Jackson's movement, began to withdraw toward Fairfax Court House. Late in the day, Jackson clashed with Union forces under Brigadier General Isaac Stevens and Major General Philip Kearny near Ox Hill, west of Fairfax. During the ensuing battle, which was fought amid a raging storm, both Union generals Stevens and Kearny were killed. The fighting ended at dusk, and Pope's army continued its withdrawal to Fairfax and subsequently to the Washington defenses. Although commercial and residential development now covers most of the Chantilly (Ox Hill) battlefield, the small Ox Hill Battlefield Park preserves a portion of the battle site.

Incorporated by the General Assembly on March 9, 1902, Clifton is one of only three towns in the county, the other two being the much more populous Vienna and Herndon. Clifton's history begins pre-colonially, when the area was used as hunting grounds by the local Dogue Native American tribe. A railroad siding was constructed here during the Civil War, and the area became titled as Devereux Station. A nearby neighborhood on the outskirts of the Clifton ZIP code has this name. Development of a village at the siding began in 1868 when a railroad depot, named \\"Clifton Station\\", was constructed. Unlike most areas in Northern Virginia, the land around Clifton is far less built up than nearby areas, especially to its east and southwest. This was out of the worry that overdevelopment near Bull Run and the Occoquan River would be environmentally damaging to the Occoquan Reservoir. Consequently, as development edged near the area in the late 1970s and early 1980s, an ordinance was enacted stating that only one building could be placed on parcels that have not already been divided. Today, the southern and eastern portions of the area are heavily forested, with single-family homes, while the northern area has become equestrian areas. History=Colonial era Before the arrival of European settlers, the present-day Clifton area was part of the hunting grounds used by Algonquin-speaking members of the Dogue tribe. The Dogue lived in villages and towns along the Potomac River and nearby Occoquan River. They carved bowls out of soapstone found in the area.Michael F. Johnson, American Indian Life in Fairfax County 10,000 B.B. to A.D. 1650, Heritage Resources Information Series: Number 3, Office of Comprehensive Planning, Fairfax County, Virginia European settlers composed of Scots merchants created the first nearby port settlement in the mid-1710s near the present-day Dumfries-Triangle area.Fairfax Harrison, Landmarks of Old Prince William, Volumes I & II, Gateway Press, Inc., Baltimore, 1987, pp. 371-396. Land in the Clifton area began to be settled in the early 18th century.Beth Mitchell, Beginning at a White Oak...Patents and Northern Neck Grants of Fairfax County, County of Fairfax, 1977. Civil War During the Civil War, the United States Military Railroad Construction Corps built a railroad siding here on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad in order to supply the Union Army with timber for railroad ties, bridge trusses, and firewood. The siding was named after John Henry Devereux, superintendent of military railroads that terminated in Alexandria. Wood from hundreds of acres was cut and hauled by wood choppers and teamsters, most of whom were escaped slaves, and transported by train to Alexandria. The laborers risked capture by working outside protected Union lines.Netherton, Nan and Wyckoff, Whitney Von Lake. Fairfax Station: All Aboard! 1995 In spring 1863, a wye was constructed at Devereux Siding to enable trains to turn around after the Union Army abandoned the Orange and Alexandria Railroad south of Bull Run. By June 1863 the entire railroad outside of the defenses of Washington was abandoned until the return of Major General George Meade's Army of the Potomac following their successful Gettysburg Campaign. New York infantry regiments were stationed at the siding in order to protect wood station operations and the railroad from Confederate attack.Netherton, Nan. Clifton: Brigadoon in Virginia. 1980 Devereux Siding was located between the station at Union Mills and Sangster's Station. Today, there are two neighborhoods outside of the town named after the Devereux and Sangster's stations. The Orange & Alexandria Railroad extended from Alexandria to Orange, Virginia. For a brief period near the close of the war, the siding became the sixth scheduled stop for passengers and freight and became known as \\"Devereux Station\\".Lynne Garvey- Hodge,Images of America: Clifton, Arcadia Publishing, Charleston SC, 2009, p.34. The O & A was the only railroad link between Alexandria and Richmond, Virginia. Village of Clifton William E. Beckwith bequeathed his land south of the railroad to his former slaves, some of whom were his children. Harriet Harris and the five children she had with William Harris were devised the land where the village of Clifton was initially developed. Harrison G. Otis, a New York realtor, purchased a large tract of land north of the railroad from the Beckwith estate and a small lot of land south of the railroad from William Harris, where he constructed a saw mill and train depot. The depot opened in November 1868 and was named \\"Clifton Station\\". The next year, an official U.S. post office opened at the depot, and Otis built the historic Clifton Hotel.Historic Clifton Hotel Harrison Otis and his brother J. Sanford Otis founded the Clifton Presbyterian Church, still in existence. The station no longer exists, but the town of Clifton is still standing along what used to be the O & A Railroad, now a part of the Norfolk Southern Railway. William Harris divided a portion of his family's land adjacent to the railroad into ten lots that were offered for sale in 1869. Homes and businesses were constructed on the lots, including a general merchandise store located on the western side of Main Street adjacent to the railroad. Harris expanded the village by selling additional lots along Main Street in the mid-1870s. Harrison Otis and his business partner Margaret Hetzel subdivided land on the eastern side of Main Street for development and several lots were sold in the 1870s; however, this development was not as successful as planned due to Harrison Otis's reduced mental health and Margaret Hetzel's financial difficulties. The village grew in the late 1800s when a number of homes and businesses were constructed, including additional merchandise stores and lumber yards. 20th century The town was incorporated by the General Assembly on March 9, 1902. It is currently one of only three towns in the Fairfax County, the other two being Vienna and Herndon. During the 1900s, the town was nearly the same size as it is now. The first schoolhouse in Clifton was in Susan Reviere Hetzel's home on Pendleton Avenue. She was also one of the founders of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The school was later moved to the side-yard area of what would later become the home of Mayors Swem Elgin and Jim Chesley. In 1912 a new schoolhouse (built for K-12) was built overlooking the town; it stood until 1952. A new elementary school, Clifton Elementary, was built on the same site in 1953 and served the community until 2010. On March 9, 1930, the Clifton General Store caught fire, and a few months later a new general store was built in its place. By the late 1960s, the town was in a state of decline. Many houses in the town were boarded up and abandoned. A number of new families and residents began much-needed gentrification of the town. Wayne Nickum, a former mayor, worked to ensure the entire town was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Some 63 Clifton buildings were added to the register at that time. Another resident, Jim Chesley, who would also serve as mayor of Clifton, worked tirelessly with national and state politicians and administrators to ensure the town maintained its historic integrity. In 1967, the town sponsored the first Clifton Day Festival as a way to attract the public to this historic town. This celebration continues each year as a town fair and music festival on the Sunday before Columbus Day in October. Towards the late 1970s and early 1980s suburban development was starting to edge near Clifton. Communities such as Burke Center and Little Rocky Run were constructed, raising concerns that the new construction might ruin the beauty of the Clifton area. In the 1980s, an ordinance was enacted stating that only one building could be placed on parcels that have not already been divided. Single-family homes were constructed in the southern and eastern parts of Clifton, while land to the north became equestrian areas. The town was declared a National Historic District by the US Department of the Interior in 1984. The opening scenes of Broadcast News were filmed in Clifton in 1986. Modern Clifton There are still many families moving into the area despite disputes with contractors and developers. Formation of the Occoquan Watershed in the 1970s limited development due to ecological concerns and required all houses in the area to have at least of land. This prevents nearly all development other than luxury single-family homes. In 2002, a new community was built on the edge of town called Frog Hill. Controversy arose about demolishing the abandoned Hetzel home on the corner of Chapel Road and Pendleton Avenue in 2006. The building and a replica home were finished in the winter of 2007. In 2000, then-mayor Jim Chesley started a Labor Day antique car show in Clifton sponsored by the Northern Virginia Custom Cruisers and Clifton Lions clubs to raise money for local charities. The ninth annual Labor Day Car Show in 2008 attracted more than 400 antique cars, an estimated two thousand visitors, and raised over $30,000. That year's featured charity was Life With Cancer, a Fairfax hospital-based program that provides family support and education. In the past five years alone, the event has raised nearly $120,000 for various local charities. Lynne Garvey Hodge and Jennifer Chesley co-chaired the annual Clifton Candlelight Homes Tour from 2002 to 2009. It has been held each year on the first Saturday in December. Chesley served solo in this capacity in 2010 and 2011. Included on the tour are five homes decorated for the holidays, the Caboose and live music in the churches. The Clifton Spring Homes Tour is run by the Clifton Community Woman's Club and is held on the third Thursday in May. The 100-member General Federation of Women's Club group raises money for local charities via home tours, silent auction, boutique, and local women's art show and sale. In 2020 the city made national headlines when a ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù banner was hung in the town‚Äôs Main Street. The banner was met with praise by many residents but condemnation by others including the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas who saw it as justifying controversial aspects of the BLM movement. https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia- politics/ginni-thomas-black-lives-matter- clifton/2020/07/09/c7b3bb98-c1f5-11ea-9fdd-b7ac6b051dc8_story.html Her comments lead to media attention on the banner.

The population was 18,245 at the 2010 census, down from 31,907 in 2000 due to the splitting off of part of it to form the Kingstowne CDP. Located just southwest of Alexandria, Franconia has existed as a community since the 1870s, when a station by that name opened on the RF&P; Railroad; however, like most of the surrounding area, it only began to develop into its present, suburban form in the 1950s. The CDP extends south to just north of the border of Fort Belvoir, encompassing neighborhoods such as Manchester Lakes and Windsor Estates. Street addresses have Alexandria ZIP Codes 22310 and 22315. It is near the Springfield Mall shopping area and the Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield Washington Metro station. Geography Franconia is located in southeastern Fairfax County at (38.763351, ‚àí77.150328). It is bordered to the west by Springfield, to the north by Lincolnia, to the northeast by Rose Hill, to the east by Kingstowne, and to the south by Newington. It is southwest of Washington, D.C. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Franconia CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.18%, is water. History Franconia Road once served as a rolling road to bring tobacco hogsheads to the port at Alexandria. The surrounding community derives its name from the \\"Frankhonia Farm\\", which sat on a portion of a tract of 191 acres purchased from Joseph Broders of Oak Grove Farm in 1859 by William Fowle, a merchant from Alexandria. Fowle's son, Robert Rollilns Fowle, sold 18 acres of the property to the Alexandria & Fredericksburg Railway Company in 1871 for the erection of a railway station, which took its name of the farm. The station was the site of the Garfield Post Office from 1881 until 1890, and again from 1898 until 1907. In 1903 it was relocated after a fire from its original site, near Fleet Drive, to the north side of Franconia Road. The railway station remained in regular service until around 1953. Today it is memorialized with a historic marker erected by the Fairfax County History Commission in 2000, located in front of the Franconia Governmental Center. For many years the center of the community was Wards Corner, at the intersection of Franconia Road and Old Rolling Road. Over twenty-five years the complex grew to include a gas station, grocery store, bar, movie theater, and dance hall; a 1959 fire destroyed everything at the site. Shops at the Festival at Manchester shopping plaza The Franconia area was the site of a skirmish in January, 1862, during the American Civil War. Colonel Wade Hampton III, having led a group of cavalrymen across the Occoquan River past Pohick Church, encountered a group of Union cavalry in the area and gave chase. Being warned by a Texas scout that he was soon to enter an ambush, Hampton stopped short and formed a squadron on top of Potter's Hill. The trap having failed, both sides began firing at each other; several soldiers were wounded, including one of Hampton's men who was shot in the face. The Confederates then retreated across the Occoquan. In later years Potter's Hill was the site of three schoolhouses, the last of them burning in 1932; more recently it was the site of a chicken farm and, later, a gravel quarry which provided material for the construction of the first Woodrow Wilson Bridge. Today the location is the site of the Hilltop Village Center. Members of the Potter family are buried at the Millan family cemetery, located nearby on the former grounds of the Millan family home, Dairy Lodge. The Franconia Volunteer Fire Department was organized in 1934; its first firehouse, completed in 1937, stood where the government center is located today. Today the department continues to serve the community from two locations in the vicinity. Franconia is also the site of the Laurel Grove Colored School and Church, organized as a congregation of former slaves in the 1880s. The school site was deeded to the Virginia School System in 1881 by Georgianna and William Jasper for $10.00; the school served the community until 1932. In 1884 the couple provided another half-acre for a church to be built next to the school. Laurel Grove Baptist Church stood until being destroyed by an electrical fire in December 2004. The church cemetery still exists, as does the school building, which was honored in 2008 with the erection of a historical marker by the Fairfax County History Commission. A number of other churches have existed in the neighborhood over the years, including Sharon Chapel, founded in 1848 and counting Phillips Brooks among its early seminarians, and Olivet Episcopal Church. Adjacent to Sharon Chapel is a cemetery, one of several in the area; another marks the former site of Oak Grove plantation, which was demolished in 1996 to make way for an assisted living facility. Other cemeteries can be found along Beulah Street. The Franconia area is represented in the Virginia House of Delegates by Democrat Mark D. Sickles. Other residents have included former South Carolina Congressman William Waters Boyce, who purchased the house Ashland, and 195 acres of farmland, after the Civil War. The history of the Franconia community and the surrounding area is preserved and interpreted by the Franconia Museum, located in the Franconia Governmental Center.

History The Mason family's Hollin Hall plantation, just south of Alexandria, had become the property of several owners, including Edward Curtis Gibbs and the Wilson family. Thomson Dairy had been founded on the land in the late 19th century, and lasted until Merle Thorpe purchased it in the early 20th century. The various dairy farms, such as Sherwood Farm, Hybla Valley Farm, and Popkins Farm were converted into suburban neighborhoods, while plans for the construction of the George Washington Air Junction and the Hybla Valley Airport began. The civilian airport was proposed to be the largest in the world, yet the land, which had once been dairy farm, was abandoned and is currently Huntley Meadows Park. During World War II, the famous Hollin Hills subdivision, to the east of U.S. Route 1 towards the Potomac River, was completed by designers Charles Goodman and Robert Davenport. Also during the war, the princess of Norway sought refuge from the conflict in Europe and wished to purchase the property of Hollin Hall; President Roosevelt personally inspected the land for her, yet his assistant, Thorpe, became its new owner in the end. The land surrounding it became a turkey farm, and was eventually bought by the Mount Vernon Unitarian Church. In 1978, the Mount Vernon Unitarian Church donated land within Hollin Hills to create the wealthy Mason Hill subdivision.

The population was 9,558 at the 2010 census. It is also the name of the privately owned lake‚Äîpart of the Cameron Run Watershed‚Äîaround which this population is located. The lake is named for Dr. John W. Barcroft, who owned and operated a mill on Holmes Run during the mid-19th century. History The masonry dam across alt=A high dam of irregular square black stone. The top of the dam is an orange primered spillway held in position by hydraulic jacks built into notches in the dam face. A spillway runs down both sides of the dam into a small rocky pond at the foot of the dam. The dam is in the forest and some trees intrude into the picture. In 1913, the Alexandria Water Company began construction of the Lake Barcroft Dam on Holmes Run to create a drinking water reservoir for the city of Alexandria. Construction of the dam was completed in 1915, putting a 620 million-gallon reservoir into service. In 1942, the company installed 24 gates at the top of the dam to raise the spillway elevation five feet, increasing the reservoir size to 800 million gallons. In 1949, the City of Alexandria began to draw its drinking water from the Occoquan Reservoir. A year later, Colonel Joseph Barger and Associates purchased the reservoir, dam, and 680 adjacent acres of land for $1 million from the Alexandria Water Company. A year later, Barger and Associates began developing the into a residential community. During the early 1950s, residents formed a homeowners association called the Lake Barcroft Community Association (LABARCA). In 1970, community residents purchased the lake, dam, and common grounds for $300,000, and established the Barcroft Lake Management Association (BARLAMA). In 1972, Hurricane Agnes passed over the area. The hurricane caused so much rain that the lake level rose above the top of the dam by . This resulted in the lake overflowing and eroding the western, earthen shoulder of the dam. The rush of water deepened the washout, but the slow erosion protected downstream interests from the wall of water that would have resulted from a total dam collapse. To restore the dam and lake, residents voted to establish the Lake Barcroft Watershed Improvement District (LBWID) to set up a taxing authority to fund repairs. The LBWID is a quasi- governmental entity headed by three state-appointed trustees who are residents of Lake Barcroft. The lake was dry for two years during the early 1970s while the damaged dam was rebuilt. A new gate improved the operation of the dam and is now fully automatic. The dam meets all Commonwealth dam safety requirements. The Lake Barcroft Association (LBA) came into being in 1992 when LABARCA and BARLAMA joined up into one private entity. Lake Barcroft has excellent fishing. Largemouth bass, catfish, sunfish and a rare (non-stinging) fresh water jellyfish all inhabit Lake Barcroft. Ospreys, fishing birds of prey, are now on the lake as well. Geography Lake Barcroft is located in eastern Fairfax County at (38.851412, ‚àí77.155654).

Management of the lake Lake Barcroft is privately owned, and managed by the Lake Barcroft Association (LBA); the current homeowners' association. Property owners on the lake and the immediate areas around the lake are bound by a restrictive covenant that also gives them rights to use the lake for recreation. For homeowners who do not own riparian land, there are five private sand beaches and a community park owned by LBA to permit access to the water. All common property is open to people living within the boundaries of the association and their authorized guests. The Lake Barcroft Association employs seasonal lifeguards to protect its beaches during the summer months. , The residents organize occasional aquatic festivals, most notably Independence Day fireworks every July 4. Fireworks are fired from one of the beaches, and residents crowd the water in their electric-powered or paddled boats to watch. The Labor Day games are held at two of its beaches to close the summer swimming season. Internal combustion engines are prohibited on the lake to prevent noise and pollution. Only the lifeguards have access to gas-powered motorboats. Most residents own a small sailboat, canoe, or an electrically powered boat. Ecology of the lake Lake Barcroft is home to many freshwater species of fish and invertebrate. Largemouth bass were introduced to the lake decades ago, and now the population is self-sustaining. Catfish and bluegill also live in the lake in large numbers. Bryozoa can be observed just below the surface on the edges and in the shallower areas of the lake. Semi-aquatic species such as muskrat, ducks, Canada geese and kingfishers are also common. As part of the Cameron Run Watershed, the lake receives large amounts of runoff from adjacent parts of suburban Fairfax County. These cause occasional algal blooms. The microbiology of the lake is monitored, and it is considered safe for fishing and swimming.

The population was 18,610 as of the 2010 census. History Lorton is named for a village in the Lake District National Park, Cumbria, in England. Joseph Plaskett of the Cumbrian village settled in southern Fairfax County, running a general store and opening the Lorton Valley Post Office on November 11, 1875. Before the identity of Lorton, the commercial center was Colchester, and the spiritual and historical center of the community around which the leading citizens of the time revolved was Pohick Church, where George Washington and George Mason were at times members of the vestry. From the early 20th century until November 2001, Lorton was the site of a District of Columbia correctional facility called the Lorton Reformatory which, among other things, detained approximately 168 women from the women's suffrage movement from the Washington, D.C. area from June to December 1917. For the 2010 census, the area around the former Lorton Reformatory was assigned to the Laurel Hill census-designated place, reducing the area and population of the Lorton CDP. A Nike missile site was built at Lorton in 1955, and remained until 1973. Lorton is one of the two stations that serve Amtrak's Auto Train which carries passengers and their vehicles non-stop to Sanford, Florida, in the Orlando area.

History The community of Newington derives its name from the second glebe house of Truro Parish, completed in 1760 and so named after becoming the private residence of Richard and Sarah McCarty Chichester sometime after 1767. The house itself was purchased by the family of William Nevitt, in 1828, along with 1000 acres of land; they occupied the building until it burned in 1875. The Alexandria and Fredericksburg Railroad opened a railway station on the property in April 1872. Originally known as the Long Branch Station and later renamed Accotink and then Newington, it was closed in 1971; it is remembered by a historic marker erected by the Fairfax County History Commission in 2005. Also in the Newington area are the remains of the Mount Air plantation, originally granted to Dennis McCarty in 1727. The house was destroyed by fire in 1992, but ruins remain; they, too, are denoted by a historic marker, erected in 2006, and are owned by the Fairfax County Park Authority, which interprets the site.

The population was 6,094 at the 2010 census. In practical terms, it is more of a neighborhood within a densely populated urban area than a traditional town. It is found within the triangle made by the intersection of three highways: Interstate 495 (the Capital Beltway), Interstate 66, and State Route 267 (the Dulles Toll Road). Within this triangle, the actual bounds of the neighborhood are Pimmit Run, Leesburg Pike (State Route 7), and Magarity Road. Although Pimmit Hills is politically part of Fairfax County, Pimmit Hills addresses use Falls Church as their mailing address. History Pimmit Alternative Learning Center and Senior Center The area that is now Pimmit Hills was primarily farm land until the sub-division was built beginning in 1950. The houses in Pimmit Hills were mostly built during the 1950s for World War II and Korean War veterans and their families. Most of the houses were originally built as three bedroom, one bath dwellings of 833 square feet. Their initial price in 1950 was $9,950. George Offutt began construction of the first 500 Pimmit Hills houses in 1950. His Offutt Construction Company completed the first two sections by 1954. Other builders completed sections 3-6, while Offutt built sections 7 & 8 under a different company. The subdivision was fully built out by 1957-58, with 1675 homes on 663 acres.name = houses are mostly single-family detached dwellings, with an average property size of 1/4 acre (1,000 m¬≤).

However, decades later the area is known for its population of large oaks, Tulip trees and other trees. Current real estate values mirror the rest of Northern Virginia, with extreme value appreciation within the last several years. Like most of the rest of Northern Virginia, the ethnic mix in the neighborhood is quite varied. Several attempts have been made by commercial developers to buy up Pimmit properties and convert them to higher- density housing such as condominiums or town houses, but so far these have been resisted by homeowners and the comprehensive redevelopment plans for the Tysons Corner area contemplates the preservation of the neighborhood as a community of single-family homes. Add-ons to the original houses such as second floors, basements, and same-floor expansions are common. The neighborhood is currently seeing many new homes built and on any given block one can find several tear downs and rebuilds. The trend on tear downs is expected to continue, although the vast majority of the homes remain older houses originally built in the mid-1950s with less than 1000 square feet.Participation, community, and public policy in a Virginia suburb: of our own making by Patricia Farrell Donahue Geography Pimmit Hills is located at (38.911644, ‚àí77.201321).

Founded in 1964, Reston was influenced by the Garden City movement that emphasized planned, self-contained communities that intermingled green space, residential neighborhoods, and commercial development.Tom Grubisich, ‚ÄúReston, Virginia,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Virginia, https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Reston_Virginia#start_entry, accessed 6 May 2018 The intent of Reston's founder, Robert E. Simon, was to build a town that would revolutionize post‚ÄìWorld War II concepts of land use and residential/corporate development in suburban America. In 2018, Reston was ranked as the Best Place to Live in Virginia by Money magazine for its expanses of parks, lakes, golf courses, and bridle paths as well as the numerous shopping and dining opportunities in Reston Town Center.Kerri Anne Renzulli and Sergei Khlebnikov, \\"This is the Best Place to Live in Every State,\\" Money Magazine, January 26, 2018, http://time.com/money/5108196/best- places-to-live-every-state-us/, accessed May 6, 2018. In 2018, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated Reston's population to be 60,335.  History  In the early days of Colonial America, the land on which Reston sits was part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a vast grant by King Charles II to Lord Thomas Fairfax that extended from the Potomac River to the Rappahannock. The property remained in the Fairfax family until they sold it in 1852.\\"A Brief History of Reston, Virginia,\\" Gulf Reston, January 1970, George Mason Archival Repository Service, retrieved April 2018, http://mars.gmu.edu/handle/1920/1268?show=full Carl A. Wiehle and William Dunn bought 6,449 acres in northern Fairfax County along the Washington & Old Dominion (W&OD;) Railroad line in 1886, later dividing the land between them, with Wiehle retaining the acreage north of the railroad line. Wiehle envisioned founding a town on the property, including a hotel, parks, and community center, but completed only a handful of homes before his death in 1901. Wiehle's heirs eventually sold the land, which changed hands several times before being purchased by the A. Smith Bowman family, who built a bourbon distillery on the site. By 1947, the Bowmans had acquired the former Dunn tract south of the railroad, for total holdings of over 7,000 acres. In 1961, Robert E. Simon used funds from his family's recent sale of Carnegie Hall to buy most of the land, except for 60 acres (240,000 m2) on which the Bowman distillery continued to operate until 1987. Conception and guiding principles whiskey distillery, long operated by the Bowman family The Midtown Reston Condominiums, a residential building at the Reston Town Center Simon officially launched Reston on April 10, 1964 (his 50th birthday) and named the community using his initials.[7] He laid out seven \\"guiding principles\\" that would stress quality of life and serve as the foundation for its future development. His goal was for Restonians to live, work, and play in their own community, with common grounds and scenic beauty shared equally regardless of income level, thereby building a stronger sense of community ties. The initial motto of the community, as articulated by Simon, was \\"Work, Play, Live\\" (or, as more often was memorialized onto Reston merchandise, \\"Live, Work, Play.\\") Simon's seven principles are: # The town should provide a variety of leisure opportunities, including a wide range of cultural and recreational facilities as well as an environment for privacy; # Residents would be able to remain in the community throughout their lives, with a range of housing meeting a variety of needs and incomes; # The focal point of all planning would be on the importance and dignity of the individual and would take precedence for large-scale concepts; # Reston residents would be able to live and work in the same community; # Commercial, cultural, and recreational facilities would be available to residents immediately, not years later; # Beauty, both structural and natural, is a necessity and should be fostered; and # Reston should be a financial success. Simon envisioned Reston as a model for clustered residential development, also known as conservation development, which puts a premium on the preservation of open space, landscapes, and wildlife habitats. Indeed, Reston was the first 20th-century private community in the U.S. to explicitly incorporate natural preservation in its planning (Greenbelt, Maryland, was a publicly supported community).  Early years (1964-1967)  Simon hired the architectural firm of Whittlesey, Conklin, & Rossant to design his new community.\\"Robert E. Simon, Jr./Reston, Virginia,\\" Historical Marker Database, marker provided by the American Institute of Certified Planners, https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=89538, accessed 15 May 2018. The plans for Reston were designed by architect James Rossant, who studied under Walter Gropius at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and his partner William J Conklin. From the outset, Rossant and Conklin's planning conceptualized the new community as a unified, cohesive, and balanced whole, including landscapes, recreational, cultural, and commercial facilities, and housing for what was envisioned to be a town of 75,000. For Lake Anne Plaza, the first of Reston's village centers, the architects combined a small shopping area with a mix of single-family houses, townhouses, and apartments next to a manmade lake featuring a large jet fountain. Close by were the cubist townhouses at Hickory Cluster, designed by noted modernist architect Charles M. Goodman in the International Style. Lake Anne also included an elementary school, a gasoline station, and two churches as well as an art gallery and several restaurants. The first section of a senior citizens' residence facility, the Lake Anne Fellowship House, was completed several years later. Reston welcomed its first residents in late 1964. During the community's first year, its continued development was covered in such major media publications as Newsweek, Time, Life Magazine, and the New York Times, which featured the new town in a front-page article extolling it as \\"one of the most striking communities\\" in the United States.  Gulf Reston (1967-1978)  From early in Reston's conception and development, Robert Simon ran into financial difficulties as sales in the new community flagged. To keep his project going, he accepted a loan of $15 million from Gulf Oil that allowed him to pay off his creditors. Even so, sales were sluggish as Simon's reluctance to compromise on his high standards for building designs and materials meant that a townhouse in Reston could cost as much as a single-family house elsewhere in Fairfax County. By 1967, Gulf Oil forced Simon out and formed Gulf Reston, Inc., to manage the community. Gulf retained many of Simon's employees and continued to adhere largely to the spirit of the original Reston master plan as envisioned by Simon. During the 1970s, Gulf built the Reston International Center near the intersection of Sunrise Valley and Reston Parkway, and added low- to moderate-income housing to the community's residential mix, including the Cedar Ridge, Laurel Glade, and Fox Mill apartment developments. Gulf also constructed housing for employees of the U.S. Geological Survey headquarters, located on Sunrise Valley Drive. Most notably, Gulf Reston put a premium on protecting Reston's open spaces and pedestrian-friendly landscape throughout its ownership. The corporation also transferred title for many Reston recreational facilities, including land, parks, lakes, and facilities, to the Reston Homeowners Association, thereby preserving them from overdevelopment.  Mobil Oil's Reston Land Corporation (1978-1996)  Within 10 years of buying Simon out, Gulf opted to begin pulling out of the real estate business and instead to focus exclusively on energy. It sold Reston's developed portions, including the three completed village centers (Lake Anne, Tall Oaks, and Hunters Woods), the Reston International Center, and Isaac Newton Square, to an investment firm. In 1978, the company finalized the sale of Reston's remaining 3,700 undeveloped acres to Mobil Oil, which pledged to continue respecting the ideals of Robert Simon. Mobil formed the Reston Land Corporation as a subsidiary to manage its holdings and began developing the remaining residential areas in what would become the South Lakes and North Point villages. Reston Land introduced a wider mix of housing choices, including more townhouses and smaller ‚Äústarter‚Äù homes, and completed the North County Government Center, which houses the Reston District police station and Fairfax County government offices, as well as a regional library and homeless shelter. Reston Land also broke ground on the 460-acre Reston Town Center which formed part of Simon's original master plan for Reston. The first four-block development of this multi-phase mixed-use project were opened in 1996 and included a hotel, several restaurants, a cinema, and office buildings.  Reston in the New Millennium (1996-present)  By 1996, Mobil had decided to follow Gulf Oil's steps and pull out of the land management business. It sold its entire Mobil Land Development subsidiary, including its Reston holdings, to Westbrook Partners, LLC, for $324 million. As Reston Town Center continued to develop, Boston Properties emerged as a leading player. The company became the sole owner of the core mixed-use tracts in Reston Town Center when it completed the purchase of the Fountain Square office/retail complex in 2012. Planning and zoning Lake Anne Plaza in Reston Reston is divided into three separate planning areas: the original Planned Residential Community (PRC) area that governs the majority of residential areas in the community; the Reston Town Center (RTC) District, which includes all of the high-density, high-rise portions of Town Center; and the Transit Station Area (TSA) on either side of the Dulles Toll Road.  Planned Residential Community (PRC)  From Reston's inception, planning and zoning in the PRC area has emphasized the inclusion and integration of common grounds, parks, large swaths of wooded areas with picturesque runs (streams), wildflower meadows, golf courses, public swimming pools, bridle paths, a bike path, four lakes, tennis courts, and extensive foot pathways. Reston was built in wooded areas of oak, maple, sycamore, and Virginia pine, and remains heavily wooded. Extensive canopy guidance protects tree cover throughout the PRC, and homeowners are prohibited from removing trees larger than 4 inches in diameter without written permission from Reston's Design Review Board. Total zoning density throughout the overall PRC area is currently capped at 13 persons per acre. This figure, however, does not include residents in Fairfax County workforce and affordable units (WDUs/ADUs), as well as the \\"bonus\\" units developers are allowed to add to their projects in compensation for having included ADUs in their proposals, Buildings in Reston Town Center USGS Headquarters Reston's five village centers are included in the PRC area. Simon envisioned a total of seven village centers, but only five were developed.Reston Village Centers, Reston Association, https://www.reston.org/AroundReston/RestonVillageCenters/tabid/155/Default.aspx, accessed 8 May 2018. The village centers and the town center are an important part of Reston. Each village center, all of which (save North Point) predate the Reston Town Center, was intended to be a short walk from most homes and incorporate the daily retail and community service needs of residents. Moderately denser developments, such as apartments and townhouse clusters, as well as some single-family homes, encircle each center. The first to be built was the critically acclaimed Lake Anne, followed by (in chronological order) Hunters Woods, Tall Oaks, South Lakes, and North Point. By 2015, however, Tall Oaks had become defunct as a village center and was purchased by a local development firm, Tall Oaks Development Company, with the intent of rezoning the 7.6-acre parcel and converting it to residential housing.  Reston Town Center District (RTCD)  During Mobil's ownership period, the corporation worked with Fairfax County to create a new Town Center District to govern planning and design for existing and new development in the core Town Center area and to remove it from the oversight of Reston Association's Design Review Board. Review and comment of all RTCD development proposals is limited to members of the RTC District Association, which is overseen by the 9-member Board of Directors, 7 of whom represent commercial property owners.  Transit Station Area (TSA)  The core portion of the Transit Station Area (TSA)‚Äîconsisting of the 12-lane Dulles Toll Road, Metro's heavy rail line, and the office parks on either side‚Äîcuts a half-mile wide swath through the community, with four north-south connections. A fifth crossover at Soapstone Drive has been proposed by Fairfax County transportation planners, though funding has not yet been identified. Zoning and planning for TSA development is governed by Fairfax County; as with the RTC District, no direct oversight from Reston Association is included, while input from and notification to PRC residents is limited. TSA zoning guidance explicits calls for this area to be designed as an urban center, with 30 million square feet of new and existing office development and 44,000 residential units. Accolades and coverage The growth and development of Reston has been monitored by newspaper articles, national magazines, and scholarly journals on architecture and land use. In 1967 the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Lyndon Johnson, visited Reston to take a walking tour along its pathways as part of her interest in beautification projects. Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin visited Reston elementary schools named for them. The Washington Post featured a road trip to Reston in January 2006, and the website \\"Beyond DC\\" has a page devoted to Reston with almost 150 photos. Reston and Robert Simon were recognized by the American Institute of Certified Planners for their significant contributions to town planning. The AICP further recognized Reston as a National Planning Landmark, praising Simon's vision for ensuring that fields and trees would be threaded throughout the residential and commercial portions of the community, and recognized it as \\"one of the finest examples of American 20th century conceptual new town planning.\\" In 2017, the Lake Anne Village Center's historic district was named to the U.S. Park Service's National Register of Historic Places, which serves as the official list of historic places worthy of preservation and protection. Reston is one of just a handful of communities in the U.S. that has been designated a Backyard Wildlife Habitat community. Reston generally follows \\"new urbanism\\" guidelines. The residential portion of the town was built with an extensive path system, and Fairfax County has constructed many sidewalks over the past decades. The downtown and original areas also incorporate mixed-use development, with more mixed-use development planned near Washington Metro stations. However, Reston differs from New Urbanism principles in several important ways. Many buildings in the PRC area are oriented away from main streets, and several major arteries lack complete sidewalk networks as a result of Fairfax County's control over Reston's transportation planning: until recently, the Fairfax County zoning code only required developers to build sidewalks in certain limited cases. The original inward orientation of the village centers was an intentional design element by Reston's early planners, who wished to avoid the commercial strip look that dominates many suburban developments.  Recreational and cultural activities  A special tax district within Fairfax County was created to fund various recreational, educational, and cultural activities in Reston. The Reston Community Center (RCC) is a core element, with its main building in south Reston at Hunters Woods Plaza and featuring a theater, indoor heated swimming pool with jacuzzi, ballroom, meeting rooms, and classroom space. A smaller RCC branch is at Lake Anne Plaza.  Parks and recreation  Building on Robert Simon's emphasis on preserving green space and providing recreational opportunities, Reston features over 55 miles of walking and hiking paths for residents, with currently about 250 acres of woodlands and open space. Reston is noted for its tree canopy, which currently covers about half of Reston's total area. It is one of only 8 American localities to be a member of the worldwide Biophilic Cities Organization, which promotes the importance of protecting and promoting nature within urban areas. The centerpiece of Reston's focus on nature is the Vernon J. Walker Nature Education Center. The Nature Center's of hardwood forest include a picnic pavilion, campfire ring, and other facilities that support its outreach programs. Its LEED gold-certified Nature House offers exhibits, an on-site naturalist, and various programs for children; it may also be rented for community or private meetings. Two golf courses are located in Reston. The 166-acre Reston National Golf Course in south Reston is certified by Audubon International as a Cooperative Cooperative Sanctuary on the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The Hidden Creek Country Club was purchased in 2017 by Wheelock Communities, a real estate development company. The Washington and Old Dominion (W&OD;) trail, which runs through Reston, is a pathway built solely for pedestrian and bicycle traffic along the former W&OD; train line. Lake Thoreau at sunset Reston contains four manmade lakes: Lake Anne, Lake Audubon, Lake Newport, and Lake Thoreau. Also within Reston's area is the Lake Fairfax Park, operated by Fairfax County and which features boat rentals, a large outdoor pool complex called \\"The Water Mine\\", overnight campground facilities, and picnic areas.

Governance  Reston is an unincorporated area in Fairfax County; its schools, roads, and law enforcement services are provided by Fairfax County. Parks, recreation facilities, and common grounds, as well as the extensive trail system, are overseen by the Reston Association under the provisions of the Reston Deed, the community's basic governing document. A standard assessment is levied on each apartment or lot (for townhouses and houses). The Deed also allows for reduced assessments for those who \\"qualify for real estate tax reduction by Fairfax County Ordinance; (ii) their units are subsidized by the federal or state government; or (iii) their units are designed and used primarily for elderly congregate care or assisted living facilities and occupied by low or moderate income residents.\\" Reston's individual clusters or neighborhoods have their own neighborhood associations which also levy assessments to cover grounds upkeep, snow removal, trash pick-up, and other maintenance. Each cluster has its own elected board of directors who report to the residents of that cluster. The majority of Reston lies within Virginia's 11th congressional district and is currently represented in Congress by Representative Gerry Connolly (D).Virginia's 8th District  Congressman Gerry Connolly: 11th District Retrieved October 9, 2015. A portion of Reston is in Virginia's 10th District and is represented by Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton (D). It is represented by Ken Plum (D) in the Virginia House of Delegates, and by Janet Howell (D) in the State Senate. While Reston has, from its inception, been an unincorporated area, several efforts have been made to achieve town status, primarily to gain more control over zoning and development decisions, which now are the purview of Fairfax County elected officials and staff. Robert Simon initially explored the option of incorporation as a town but was blocked by Fairfax County. Simon asserted to an interviewer that Fairfax officials informed him they would deny Reston access to Fairfax's water and sewer lines if he sought incorporation for his new community. In 1980, a group of Reston residents were successful in pushing for a referendum to incorporate Reston as a town, but the referendum failed in 1980 by a 2‚Äì1 margin. A similar initiative in 2005, which was publicly supported by Robert Simon, also failed.  Local media  Reston is served primarily by the Washington, D.C. media market. The community lies within the local distribution area for two national newspapers, the Washington Post and the Washington Times, as well as two local publications, the Fairfax Times and the Reston Connection. All four also offer digital subscriptions. A third local paper, the \\"Observer,\\" which covered Reston and nearby Herndon, closed in 2010 and transferred coverage to AOL's Patch service of local digital news sites, which launched a Reston site in August 2010. Website Reston Now provides daily local news coverage.Reston Now In addition, multiple television and radio stations in the Washington metropolitan area provide coverage of local developments.

The population was 20,226 at the 2010 census. Built in the mid-1950s, Rose Hill is the largest of the subdivisions that make up the CDP, which is just southwest of Alexandria; others include Wilton Woods, Burgundy Village, and Winslow Heights. Street addresses are in Alexandria ZIP codes 22310, 22303 and 22315. Geography Rose Hill is located in southeastern Fairfax County at (38.789263, ‚àí77.108971). It is bordered to the north by the city of Alexandria, to the east by Huntington, to the south by Groveton and Hayfield, to the southwest by Kingstowne, and to the west by Franconia. The CDP's borders follow the Capital Beltway and CSX rail line on the north, South Van Dorn Street and some smaller roads on the west, South Kings Highway on the south, and Shaffer Drive and Telegraph Road on the east. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Rose Hill CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.28%, is water. History The community of Rose Hill derives its name from an 18th-century plantation once located nearby; this was established by Daniel French, the first builder of Pohick Church, on land that had been part of the Gunston Hall estate. The house stood on high ground, and was described as having a fine view of the nearby valley and the Potomac River in the distance. The land had been purchased by Daniel French, Sr., in 1723, passing to his son, Daniel French, Jr., in 1736. At the latter's death, the property went first to his wife Penelope and then to Elizabeth Dulaney, their daughter. The Dulaneys sold the plantation early in the 1800s, and between 1810 and 1868 it passed through the hands of numerous owners. Rose Hill post office On September 28, 1863, during the American Civil War, the house was the site of a raid by John S. Mosby and his raiders. They had ridden into Alexandria in an attempt to capture Francis Harrison Pierpont, whom they expected to find at the City Hotel. Discovering that he had left, the raiders burned a railroad bridge before heading along Telegraph Road to Rose Hill Plantation, where they sought Pierpont's aide, Col. Daniel F. Dulaney; the colonel's son, French, was among Mosby's company. Neighbor Anne S. Frobel later wrote in her diary that a \\"party of Mosby‚Äôs boys came very unexpectedly to Rose Hill, and took off Col. Dulaney. One of them was his own son. ‚Ä¶This boy‚Äôs first greeting to his father when he rushed into the room where his father was in bed [was] ... ‚ÄòHow do Pa‚ÄîI‚Äôm very glad to see you,‚Äô and the father‚Äôs answer sitting up in bed, with proper dignity, ‚ÄòWell, sir, I‚Äôm d-sorry to see you.‚Äô But they took him down to Richmond nevertheless.\\" The colonel survived the war, but his son was killed in 1864. In the years after the conflict, the area around Rose Hill was the site of farming and gravel mining operations. The frame house burned in 1895. The last owner of the property was Robert L. May. What is today the community of Rose Hill was established in 1954; that same year the body of Daniel French, Jr., which had been buried at the plantation at his death in 1771, was moved to Pohick Church. Within four years a Safeway had been constructed, as had two swimming pools serving residents. An elementary school was opened in 1957, a year after the foundation of the Rose Hill Civic Association. In 1970 the Fairfax County Park Authority purchased 148 acres in the area for construction of a golf course; the Greendale Golf Course was dedicated on August 19, 1976. Today it is one of eight courses managed by the Park Authority. Its property line marks the boundary of the community. Today the history of Rose Hill is commemorated with a historic marker erected by the Fairfax County History Commission in 2000, located in front of the John Marshall Library. Another marker, erected as part of the Civil War Trails Program, tells the story of the 1863 raid. Also in the vicinity was the plantation Clermont, birthplace of Fitzhugh Lee. The site of the plantation is noted by a marker erected by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources in 2004; located in front of Mark Twain Middle School, it is south of the plantation's actual location. Landmarks in Rose Hill also included a pair of silos that were once part of a dairy farm in the vicinity, and which were later converted to serve as showers for the Rose Hill Swimming and Tennis Club. Attempts were made to list them on the Fairfax County Inventory of Historic Sites.

The population was 9,255 at the 2010 census. Seven Corners has a \\"Falls Church\\" mailing address but is not within Falls Church's city limits. The area got its name from the intersection of State Route 7 (Leesburg Pike and East Broad Street), U.S. Route 50 (Arlington Boulevard), State Route 613 (Sleepy Hollow Road), State Route 338 (Hillwood Avenue) and Wilson Boulevard (also part of State Route 613). The junction of these four roads once created seven corners. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 0.7 square miles (1.8 km2), all of it land. The Upper Long Branch of Four Mile Run passes through the northernmost low point of the CDP. The area is built on Munson's Hill, and overlooks adjacent Upton's Hill. The views to the south and west are unbroken, and offer scenic vistas in the directions of Annandale and Fairfax City.  History  Office towers in Seven Corners, major landmarks in the area Seven Corners was known as Fort Buffalo from the American Civil War until the 1950s. The area took its name from a fortification constructed in October 1862 by men of the 21st New York Infantry. Fort Buffalo stood on the southern side of the Leesburg Pike, at its current intersection with Sleepy Hollow Road. The story of the fort is described in a local history of the Civil War entitled A Virginia Village Goes to War--Falls Church During the Civil War. The fort was built at that location to take advantage of the excellent views to the east and south‚Äîthe direction from which Confederate Army troops were thought to possibly come. After the war the massive fortification of Fort Buffalo was dismantled but other earthworks remained and were easily visible through the 1930s.Bradley E. Gernand. A Virginia Village Goes to War--Falls Church During the Civil War. Virginia Beach: The Donning Company, 2002. Pages 112-113, 178-179, 236. The change of place name in the 1950s came about due to the construction of Lee Memorial Boulevard, now known as Arlington Boulevard (U.S. Route 50). The construction of Route 50 caused the formation of a seven cornered intersection‚Äîor did until the mouth of Wilson Boulevard was rerouted slightly to avoid all those roadways converging on a single point. With the advent of Route 50 the area quickly developed into an important commercial center with the opening in 1956 of Seven Corners Shopping Center, one of the first malls in the Washington region. The original center featured an iconic sign combined with a modernistic entry arch; this was later removed. The original Route 50, envisioned and built as a landscaped parkway linking Washington, D.C. with the Shenandoah Valley, has since evolved into a commercial corridor and its function as a link to the valley has been assumed by Interstate 66.Gernand, A Virginia Village Goes to War, pp. 235-236.

Management of traffic at the intersection The namesake \\"seven\\" corners has long since disappeared, having been replaced by somewhat more motorist-friendly intersections which well exceed the former seven. Motorists bound in any direction are subject to one or more stoplight signals. There is a pedestrian bridge over US 50\\\\. The roads themselves are not pedestrian-friendly. The County has a traffic management and commercial development plan in place, work has begun, and the land between Leesburg Pike and Wilson Boulevard adjacent Patrick Henry Drive is now largely owned by the County. The traffic is managed as follows from the following roads: *US Route 50 (US 50) is a highway that runs east‚Äìwest along Arlington Boulevard in the area. US 50 has a series of frontage roads that connect to the other roadways in the intersection. Through traffic can continue on the highway itself unimpeded by the local traffic in the intersection. *State Road 7 (SR 7) is a four- to six-lane roadway, separated by a median following East Broad Street to the northwest or Leesburg Pike to the southeast of the intersection. Motorists may access any of the other roads. *State Road 338 (SR 338) terminates in the intersection from the northwest. Traffic proceeding southeast defaults onto SR 7 east. *Sleepy Hollow Road terminates with northbound traffic defaulting to follow SR 7 to the southeast. Secondary State Route 613 follows Sleepy Hollow to the south and continues along Wilson Boulevard to the northeast. *Wilson Boulevard terminates at the intersection from the northeast. Southbound traffic defaults to follow the US 50 frontage road northwesterly which connects to SR 7 westbound. From this frontage road, traffic may access all other directions of the other roads in the intersection.

Located in Northern Virginia between the community of McLean and the town of Vienna along the Capital Beltway (I-495), it lies within the Washington Metropolitan Area. Tysons is home to two super-regional shopping malls‚ÄîTysons Corner Center and Tysons Galleria‚Äîand the corporate headquarters of numerous companies such as Intelsat, DXC Technology, Gannett, Hilton Worldwide, Freddie Mac, Capital One, and Booz Allen Hamilton. Tysons is Fairfax County's central business district and a regional commercial center. It has been characterized as a quintessential example of an edge city. The population was 19,627 as of the 2010 census. History Known originally as Peach Grove, the area received the designation Tysons Crossroads after the Civil War. William Tyson, a Maryland native from Cecil County, purchased a tract of land from A. Lawrence Foster. Tyson served as postmaster of the now discontinued Peach Grove Post Office from 1854‚Äì1866. The Peach Grove Post Office was established on April 22, 1851. As recently as the 1950s, Tysons was a quiet rural intersection flanked by a few small stores, and a fruit stand operated by Mr. Tyson, who sold apples and apple cider from the corner of his property. Big changes came in 1963 when the Tysons area moved from a country crossroads to a giant commercial urban area with the awarding of contracts at the interchange of Route 7 and Route 123. In 1962, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors approved the Tysons Corner Shopping Center (now Tysons Corner Center), which was planned to be within a triangle bordered by Chain Bridge Road, Leesburg Pike, and the Capital Beltway. Developers proclaimed it as the largest enclosed mall in the world when it opened July 25, 1968. A line for the opening of the world's first Apple Store at Tysons Corner Center in 2001 In recent years, the influx of technology companies into Northern Virginia has brought many new office buildings and hotels to the landscape. The rapid growth of Tysons (in comparison to other locations near the Capital Beltway) has been the topic of numerous studies. One factor was the aggressive promotion of Tysons by Earle Williams, for many years the CEO of the defense contracting firm Braddock Dunn & McDonald. Tysons serves as a \\"downtown\\" of Fairfax County, with one quarter of all office space and one eighth of all retail in the county. It is an auto-oriented edge city with severe traffic congestion, and it faces competition from the urban areas of Arlington and newer suburban edge cities such as Dulles. In 2008, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors unanimously voted to begin a 40-year plan to urbanize Tysons around the coming four stops of Washington Metro's Silver Line in the vein of neighboring Arlington County's Rosslyn-Ballston corridor. A preliminary estimate from the Fairfax County Department of Transportation suggested that $7.83 billion in transportation infrastructure projects will be necessary to transform Tysons Corner into a high-density urban center from 2010 to 2050, most of which will be allocated to both construction phases of the Silver Line. Existing plans call for construction of a grid layout for streets around the rail stations, projected to cost $742 million. An additional $1 billion will be spent on further transit and street grid projects from 2030 to 2050.Tysons will need $15 billion ‚Äì 'with a B' The Washington Post In November 2012, the county approved Arbor Row, a mixed-used development containing office and residential highrises, ground-floor retail, and underground parking near the Tysons Corner Station. In April 2013, the county approved Scotts Run Station South, a development containing 17 buildings, including six office and residential buildings, one hotel, and ground-floor retail near the McLean Station. This development alone will be larger than Reston Town Center. Ahead of the Washington Metro Silver Line opening in mid-2014, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and the Tysons Partnership, a nonprofit association that represents the area's stakeholders, began rebranding the area as simply \\"Tysons\\", dropping \\"Corner\\" from the name. The change started as a matter of convenience, but later took hold to market the change in the area's character, according to members of the board. The change was unofficial at the time, and either \\"Tysons\\" or \\"Tysons Corner\\" could be used in addresses. However, in November 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau announced the CDP's name would officially be changed to Tysons effective the following summer. Current developments Tysons is seen as a modern prototype of an edge city. Tysons in its brief 40-year history has been given substantial redevelopment offers for the next 20 to 30 years. This particular area has seen a growing amount of interest as plans to make it an urban center were already begun in 2010. Private-sector development within the United States in combination with political groups have begun the planning process behind the redevelopment of Tysons. There are two forces at work in the creation of an edge city as it can be beneficial to both parties. With the redevelopment process taking place there has been an aggressive push to bring in businesses to Tysons. Edge cities such as Tysons have specific regional accessibility that has been enhanced by major projects funded by federal and state governments. One of the bigger enhancements to transportation specifically to Tysons was the construction ‚Äú‚Ä¶of the Washington Dulles International Airport and an associated access road and the Capital Beltway but also expansions to state roads‚Äù. Location and transportation is important to the creation of edge cities, this city is an example of investments placed on the surrounding area. As for the future of Tysons, the plan remains to see the city become the downtown core of Fairfax County. There is a clear purpose to the investments and the future when investing into edge cities. To this point ‚Äú‚Ä¶eight districts have been delimited, with four centered on new metro stations being transit-oriented development districts‚Äù. Future plans to transportation around the area continue to be made, the accessibility of the area is on the rise with many forms of transportation being formed. ‚ÄúThe aims of the plan are for 75% of development to be within half a mile of metro stations, an urban center of 200,000 jobs and 100,000 residents, a jobs balance of 4.0 per household‚Äù. Many of these plans have been created in order to create a fully metropolitan city from a small town. The small edge cities progressively become larger with the creation of distinct plans. For many individuals the interest with edge cities lies in what they can show about new trends across city regions. Tysons is a prime example of the future of edge cities and what other small towns all around the world could become.

Demographics Tysons was one of the inspirations for, and figures prominently in, Joel Garreau's pioneering study of the edge city phenomenon.Joel Garreau, Edge City: Life on the New Frontier, (New York: Random House 1992) Among the reasons for calling Tysons an edge city is that, in contrast to typical \\"bedroom\\" suburbs, people commute into it in the morning and away from it at night, with a daytime population greater than 100,000 and a nighttime population of fewer than 20,000. Planners envision up to 200,000 jobs and 100,000 residents in coming decades. 2010 census As of the 2010 census, there were 19,627 people, 9,481 households, and 4,754 families residing in the community.

Following a referendum, Columbia was dissolved as an incorporated town - until that time the smallest in Virginia - on July 1, 2016.Fluvanna County Town of Columbia to Dissolve, WVIR-TV, 29 June 2016 As of the 2010 census, the town's population was 83, up from 49 at the 2000 census. Columbia is part of the Charlottesville Metropolitan Statistical Area. History In pre-colonial times, the site served as the location of a major Monacan village. The Monacan settlement was named Rassewek or Rassawek. As of 2020, its historic remains were under threat from a proposed water pumping station. The National Trust for Historic Preservation named it as one of America's most endangered historic places. English settlers who took over the land established a community called Point of Fork, in reference to the confluence of James and Rivanna rivers. During the Revolutionary War, a Patriot arsenal under the command of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben stood in Point of Fork. A detachment of the Queen's Rangers, composed of American Loyalists and commanded by Colonel John Graves Simcoe, were sent by Major General Charles Cornwallis to capture and confiscate the arsenal. Upon learning of Simcoe's approach, von Steuben ordered his troops to transport the arsenal's stores across the James; heavy artillery was dumped into the river to be recovered later. Simcoe captured the arsenal on June 5, 1781, and reported seizing a vast amount of Patriot supplies. However, von Steuben and General Lafayette reported that losses were negligible.\\"Fluvanna and the American Revolution\\", Fluvanna Chamber of Commerce, Retrieved 5 July 2016 Following the end of the war and the founding of the United States, the community changed its name to \\"Columbia\\" and became incorporated as a town in 1788. Columbia became a shipping point on the James River for Virginia's tobacco trade, establishing its own bateau freight line. The confluence of the rivers at Columbia linked Richmond to Lynchburg through the James River and to Charlottesville through the Rivanna.Justin Bergman, \\"Columbia: Will Fluvanna's historic burg be saved?\\", The Hook, 18 December 2002 In the mid-19th century, Columbia served as a point along the stagecoach route between Richmond and Staunton. The town entered an economic decline with the end of passenger railroad service in 1958, and saw many homes and businesses destroyed in floods caused by Hurricanes Camille in 1969 and Agnes in 1972. In the decades afterward, conditions in the town worsened as buildings along its main street either burned down or became abandoned. In May 2014, Columbia's mayor and town council proposed disincorporation, which would result in the town being governed solely by Fluvanna County in exchange for financial aid. Despite efforts by historic preservationists to raise money for the town's continued existence as an independent entity, residents voted to disincorporate in a referendum held on March 17, 2015. The Virginia General Assembly revoked Columbia's town charter on March 3, 2016, via HB14 during the 2016 session. The disincorporation took effect on July 1, 2016. Shrine of St. Katharine Drexel Columbia is home to St. Joseph's Church and Shrine of St. Katharine Drexel, a parish within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond. The church was built by William and Catherine Wakeham, English Catholic abolitionists who moved to Columbia in 1833. Because they were abolitionists, the hill on which their house was built came to be called Free Hill. After Catherine Wakeham's death in 1891, her sons Alfred and Richard, both Josephite Fathers were called away from Columbia for clerical duties. An elderly African-American man, Zack Kimbro, continued to maintain the chapel and place fresh flowers and clean linen on its altar. St. Katharine Drexel, S.B.S. (1858‚Äì1955), the founder of the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, visited the church while passing through Columbia in 1901 and noticed the reflection of sunlight on the chapel's cross. St. Katherine was eventually introduced to Kimbro, who told her he had prayed daily for over a decade that Mass would once more be celebrated in the chapel. St. Katharine contacted the Josephite Fathers and arranged for Mass to be celebrated in the church's chapel regularly. She also founded a small school adjacent to the chapel, which was one of Fluvanna County's only educational institutions available for black children. St. Joseph's and its school became the center of one of Virginia's only historically African-American Catholic communities. Because of its location on high ground, St. Joseph's was spared during the 20th Century floods that mostly destroyed Columbia's other buildings. The church is still an active parish, sharing a pastor with Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Palmyra. St. Joseph's also serves Catholic students at the nearby Fork Union Military Academy.

The town is part of the Roanoke Metropolitan Statistical Area, and had a population of 4,799 as of the 2010 census. It is located in the Roanoke Region of Virginia.Roanoke Region of Virginia History Franklin County courthouse, built 1909, Rocky Mount Although Robert Hill built a block house (fortified residence and trading post) in the 1740s, the first English colonists arrived here in 1760, and they named Rocky Mount for a steep cliff near the town. The area originally consisted of two adjacent villages, Rocky Mount and Mount Pleasant. Washington Iron Furnace was built by James Callaway and Jeremiah Early on what is now Main Street slightly outside what is now the historic district, and operated by Calloway's heirs and Peter Saunders until damaged by a flood in 1850, with rebuilding stopped by the Civil War. The first court session was held at Rocky Mount in 1786 following the Revolutionary War, in Callaway's home until he deeded land to the town on which to build the (log) courthouse. Rocky Mount had a post office in 1795. The town was divided into lots in 1804. Jeremiah's son John Early represented the county (part-time) in the Virginia House of Delegates and served as sheriff as well as operated a plantation nearby. The courthouse was replaced in 1831. By 1836 the iron furnace employed 100 people and the town had about 275 residents, included 30 homes and several businesses including 3 grocery stores and a newspaper/printing office. The oldest dwelling is \\"Mount Pleasant\\", built overlooking the courthouse in 1829 for Caleb Tate (the court clerk from 1797-1835); the detached brick kitchen built circa 1820 is the oldest building in town. The Rocky Mount Turnpike Company incorporated in 1846 and a bank shortly afterward, but neither prospered.Rocky Mount NRIS Section 7, pp. 3-4, 54-56 During the Civil War, numerous planter families from the Tidewater region sought refuge in Rocky Mount, and many brought substantial numbers of slaves with them. Among these were the immediate past governor, Henry A. Wise, who settled his family here before he became a Confederate general. Jubal Anderson Early, who became a Confederate general during the war, was born on a farm nearby, and served as one term in the Virginia House of Delegates representing the county (succeeded by his mentor Norborne Taliaferro, who later became a judge) and more than a decade as Commonwealth's attorney (prosecutor) before the war, then resumed his legal practice here and in Lynchburg, Virginia after the war's end (although the building which served as his law office was razed in 1937). The only building constructed in that era and surviving today was constructed for Dr. Thomas Greer in 1861. Two other buildings constructed in 1850-1854 and used as law offices still survive. The town's clerk, Robert A. Scott, issued scrip to assist families of Confederate soldiers during the Civil War, and the Confederate government also requisitioned slaves from various county landowners to work on Richmond's defenses. The town experienced no battles, although Union Gen. George Stoneman and troops passed through the county in the war's final days. In 1867, the Freedman's Bureau under William F. DeKnight opened a Sunday school in Rocky Mount, about a third of whose residents at the time were African American, but efforts to establish a day school didn't succeed until much later, which is one of the reasons Booker Taliaferro Washington, born enslaved in Franklin County, moved with his mother to West Virginia for his education, and later studied at the Hampton Institute at the other side of the state.NRIS pp. 57-58 The area's major cash crop both before and after the Civil War was tobacco. In 1873, Rocky Mount incorporated as a town and absorbed the smaller village of Mount Pleasant, creating its present boundaries. Former court clerk Robert Scott became the first mayor. Rocky Mount's population was about 400 people in 1870, 600 in 1897 and about 1100 in 1920. In 1880, the Franklin and Pittsylvania Railroad connected Rocky Mount to Danville and Lynchburg via Pittsylvania County, Virginia, but the more important railroad line would not arrive for another dozen years, until three years after most of Rocky Mount burned in 1889. Industrial and commercial development began as Rocky Mount became a stop on the twisty railroad line between Roanoke, Virginia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina (nicknamed the \\"Pumpkin Vine\\", which became the Norfolk and Western Railway after 1896). The Cannaday Mills (a gristmill and box factory) was built in 1898 . Schoolteacher turned merchant and entrepreneur Nathanial V. Angle built the Bald Knob furniture factory in 1903 (which became the Lane Furniture Company in 1957 and is currently the MW Manufacturing Company). By World War I, N.V. Angle owned a furniture and grocery stores, a lumberyard, tobacco house, agricultural implement store and the area's first Ford Dealership. Much of the historic architecture, both residential and commercial, dates from the first decades of the 20th century, although only one structure the Lodge Rooms (Colored) built in 1900, remains of what had been a thriving African American community on West Court Street. Workers needed housing, and more elaborate (including Victorian-style) dwellings were built for managers and professionals. Rocky Mount is roughly halfway between Roanoke and Martinsville, Virginia, which likewise developed furniture manufacturing and textile industries early in the 20th century. The present Franklin County courthouse was constructed in 1909 (two years after the Norfolk and Western freight and passenger station) and modeled on the Roanoke County courthouse in Salem, Virginia. Trinity Episcopal Church and its Rectory (both built in 1874, the church being moved back from Main Street in 1906) survived the 1889 fire, but the pre-1898 African Methodist Episcopal Church no longer exists. The Presbyterian Church (built by 1880) managed to reopen shortly after the fire; the Methodists rebuilt their church of brick, then replaced Scott Memorial Church again in 1925. The Baptist Church (colored) built in 1907 was later deconsecrated and became a business; the Bethel AME church built before World War I is still in active use. The town gained a Coca-Cola bottling plant circa 1920. The area's oldest car dealership (Chevrolet) dates from 1926 (although housed in a building from 1916); Ryland Goode also established a car dealership for Dodges and Hudsons that year. The current International Harvester dealership building dates from 1946; the John Deere dealership (built 1940) is now the county's Developmental Center. The Art-Deco style People's National Bank was built in 1928. The town also gained a Sealtest dairy bottling plant and Exchange Milling (an animal feed processing plant) around 1940.NRIS section 7 pp. 9-14, 18, 23, 33, 37-39, 51, 59-60 In 1915, Rocky Mount appropriated $2200 to build an eight-room brick school for white students, complete with central heating and indoor plumbing. The same year black residents built Rocky Mount Colored School and dormitory on Bald Knob outside the town limits. The town became a school district and built a high school for white students in 1924. By 1940 the town's white students had 16 teachers, and 7 African American teachers \\"struggled with the problems of their race in their own schools.\\"NRIS p. 62 quoting WPA writer Essie Smith Around that time, a foundation was established to mark Booker T. Washington's birthplace, and in 1952 it donated 6 acres of land to help build a modern four room school for black students. That opened shortly before the start of Massive Resistance and remained in use until 1966, when the U.S. Supreme Court found subsidies for segregated schools (much used by the county's white schoolchildren) unconstitutional, and is now an administrative building used by the National Park Service.Booker T. Washington Memorial NRIS, at p. ix, available at https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/bowa/hrs.pdf Rocky Mount's brick Municipal Building was built in 1929, and the Works Progress Administration built the Post Office in 1936. The county jail was built in the Art Moderne style in 1938. The town applied for funds to upgrade its sewer system as the Great Depression began in 1933, but the New Deal project with most impact may have been work on U.S. Route 220 and state route 40 near the town. The WPA and prominent local businessman N. V. Angle also drained a swamp and built Mary Elizabeth Park, named for Angle's wife and now maintained by the local Presbyterian church (although Angle was a Methodist philanthropist). Before World War II, Rocky Mount also had a silk mill and a door and sash window factory, in addition to Angle's furniture company. The library, constructed in 1940, was one of ten funded by an anonymous donor in rural Virginia counties in that era, and now also serves as administration building. The county's administration building, built in 1967, is further down the street and named for Virgil Goode Sr., former Virginia House delegate and Commonwealth's attorney. In 1990, local residents saved the former Norfolk and Western station, and have transformed it into a tourist information center.Rocky Mount NRIS section 7 pp. 16-17, 28-32, 49, 52, 61-62 The Booker T.

Named after prominent cotton mill owner, Francis Henry Fries, the town is noted as the former site of Washington Mill (1903-1989); as one of three end points of the New River Trail State Park and as the host of annual music festivals reflecting its strong bluegrass and country music traditions -- with its August Old-Time Fiddlers' and Bluegrass Convention and its September Festival by the New River.Fussell, pgs. 74 - 74 History Fries was named after North Carolina cotton mill owner Colonel Francis Henry Fries. Jim 'Pipe' Carico (of Stephens Creek, Virginia, the nearest incorporated town) contacted Fries in 1900 and proposed Bartlett Falls on New River as a site for a hydroelectric dam that could power a cotton mill. Fries purchased the surrounding rural farmland then hired a local labor force to build a dam, a cotton mill and a full-service company owned town. By 1901, the New River Train was extended to the mill site and Fries petitioned the Virginia State Legislature to incorporate the new town of Carico, VA in honor of Jim 'Pipe' Carico. For reasons that are not well documented, the town name was instead legislatively changed to Fries, Virginia and officially incorporated in 1902. Despite the heavy reliance on manual labor, mules and oxen, the town's construction progressed quickly and the open call for employment spurred migration to the town. Around 300 houses, a post office, a church and a company commissary were wedged into the surrounding hillside before the mill began operation in February 1903 -- with \\"the most sophisticated technology in the world.\\" After changing hands numerous times, the mill closed in 1989. At the time the mill closed, it employed 1,700 people. Fries High School also closed in 1989. The students from Fries, along with students from nearby Independence High School were combined to form Grayson County High School, located in Independence. The Stephen G. Bourne House, Fries Boarding Houses, and Spring Valley Rural Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Culture  Although the entire Appalachian region is known for its Bluegrass and traditional, or \\"old- timey\\" music and musicians, the region around Mount Airy, North Carolina is one of the few areas of the United States where this music has remained prominent, even among young people. The Old Fiddler's Convention, one of the most prominent traditional music contests in the United States, has been held annually in the nearby city of Galax since 1935. It has long attracted the best up-and-coming bluegrass musicians. The Blue Ridge Music Center with its amphitheater and music museum of old-time music is just a short distance away on the Blue Ridge Parkway at Milepost 213 (kilometer 342.8).

Recreation New River Trail State Park, a rail trail park has a 5.5 spur from Fries Junction on the main trail to Fries, Virginia -- giving Fries one of its three end points. The historic Fries Recreation Center is located in downtown Fries. In 1910 an increasing need was seen for a community center for the employees of the mill. A site was selected that would be central for the townspeople and construction was begun for the Fries Lyceum. The building provided reading rooms, and a skating rink became the gathering place for the young people of the town. In 1923, the Lyceum was renovated and reorganized as a Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). The building now contained the only gymnasium in the Carroll-Grayson area, along with a movie theatre. The need to expand was seen again in the late 1940s, and in 1948, a new lobby, bowling alley, kitchen and dining area, library, and additional game rooms were added. The swimming pool built in the front, facing new River, was the most popular addition. Through the years semi-professional baseball was sponsored by the \\"Y\\". It has housed meetings for the Fries Garden Club, organized in 1932, Fries Lions Club organized in 1938, and the Fries Women's Club organized in 1953.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 7,225, up from 6,619 at the 2000 census. Ashland is named after the Lexington, Kentucky estate of Hanover County native and statesman Henry Clay. It is the only incorporated town in Hanover County. Although comprising only one square mile when originally incorporated in 1858, today Ashland has grown through several annexations to a size of , one of Virginia's larger towns in terms of land area. History The Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad initially developed the town in the 1840s as a mineral springs resort with a racetrack. The town was named \\"Ashland\\" after native son Henry Clay's estate in Kentucky and was officially incorporated on February 19, 1858. The area had been known as \\"The Slashes\\", sometimes translated as \\"swamp\\", but which also reflected the small ravines that formed in the sandy clay soil after hard rains. Confederate troops trained on the former racetrack early in the American Civil War, but the war and its aftermath devastated Ashland. Randolph‚ÄìMacon College (founded 1830) moved to Ashland in 1868 and began using buildings of the bankrupt hotel as well as building additional structures. The railroad lines rebuilt and the town continued to expand. Even before the war, the railroad began offering monthly passes to Richmond to people buying lots and building houses in Ashland. When tycoon Jay Gould established a streetcar line between Ashland and Richmond in 1908, the town became an early streetcar suburb of Richmond. Construction of U.S. Route 1 on the former Washington (or Richmond) Road, and later I-95, further shaped the town character and development.Ashland station One of Virginia's oldest churches is southeast of Ashland: Slash Church, built as the Upper Church of St. Paul's Parish in 1729 remains a house of worship, though now used by the Disciples of Christ.Don W. and Sue Massey, Colonial Churches of Virginia (Charlottesville, Howell Press, 2003) at pp. 54-55 Ashland itself originally had a Free Church, shared by various Protestant denominations. Several denominations built churches shortly after the Civil War, but many have been torn down. The town's current Episcopal church is St. James the Less, on the other side of the railway line from Slash Church and whose congregation received monthly clergy visitations in the 1850s, and which in 1958 sold its 1866-consecrated and once-moved building as well as the old rectory (which still remains today, in private ownership) in order to build a larger one on the town's outskirts. The Disciples of Christ also had a historic church on Center Street (built 1900) that was replaced in 1985. Historic churches still within the town's (and historic district's) boundaries include Ashland Baptist Church (1860, now the Hanover Arts and Activities Center); Shiloh Baptist Church (1866, originally Freedmens Baptist Church), Duncan Memorial Chapel (Methodist, 1879), St. Ann's Catholic Church (built 1892, remodeled 1925) and Ashland Presbyterian Church (1875-1881). Gwathmey Baptist Church (1892) is a mile nearer Richmond and (like the former St. James the Less Church), within 50 feet of the railroad tracks.http://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1283&context;=honors- theses The town now also has an Eastern Orthodox congregation, St. Andrew's (2001), and a messianic Jewish congregation (Beth Shalom Ministries, 2004). Major Payne was filmed at the Ashland railroad station, which now acts as a tourist information office and no longer sells rail tickets.

The population was 36,348 during the 2010 census, up from 30,464 at the 2000 census. History Rural Plains, located on the grounds of the Richmond National Battlefield Park, Hanover County The area was settled by English colonists starting in the 17th century. Rural Plains, also known as Shelton House, is a structure built in 1670 and lived in by male Sheltons until 2006. Located in the northern part of the Mechanicsville CDP, it is now owned and operated by the National Park Service as one of the sites of the Richmond National Battlefield Park. In addition to Rural Plains, Clover Lea, Cold Harbor National Cemetery, Cool Well, Hanover Meeting House, Hanover Town, Immanuel Episcopal Church, Laurel Meadow, Locust Hill, Oak Forest, Oakley Hill, Selwyn, and Spring Green are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In downtown Mechanicsville stands a stone windmill, now a landmark in the area. The building was constructed as a Heritage Bank branch office in the 1970s. In 2007-2008, it was restored and enlarged by a new bank occupancy. The \\"windmill\\" is decorative and driven by an electric motor. American Civil War Mechanicsville, and the surrounding area, was the site of numerous battles during the American Civil War. The first was the Battle of Beaver Dam Creek, which began on June 26, 1862. Confederate General A.P. Hill launched a series of assaults against Union Major General Fitz John Porter's army positioned along Beaver Dam Creek, just east of Mechanicsville. Union forces repulsed the Confederate attacks and afterward withdrew to a new position along Boatswain Creek near Gaines' Mill. The Beaver Dam Creek engagement was the second in the series of Civil War battles known as the Seven Days Battles.

The population was 15,711 at the 2010 census.  History  Edmund Sewell Read founded the community of Highland Springs in the 1890s as a streetcar suburb of Richmond on the Seven Pines Railway Company's electric street railway line between the city and the Seven Pines National Cemetery. There, many Union dead were interred, primarily as a result of battles nearby during the Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), most notably during the Peninsula Campaign of 1862. The potential traffic of visiting families to the Richmond area from out-of-town needing transportation to and from the cemetery was a motivating factor for inception of the new street railway. Read came to the area from Boston in hopes of finding a suitable climate for his ailing wife. The natural springs in the area made it a suitable choice for the Read family, and apparently an inspiration for the new name. Approximately mid-way along the new streetcar route from Richmond through eastern Henrico County, Read bought a tract of land and divided it into lots. He laid out along the main street which was the pre-existing Nine Mile Road, new cross streets named in alphabetical order after plants, beginning from the west: Ash, Beech, Cedar, Daisy, Elm, Fern, Grove, Holly, Ivy, Juniper, Kalmia, Linden, Maple, Oak, Pine, Quince, Rose, and Spruce. One block south of and parallel to the Nine Mile Road, Read Street was named for its founder, Edmund Sewell Read. The Sewells' large brick home is situated on the south side of Nine Mile Road between Grove and Holly, with Read Street to its rear. Today it serves as a medical office complex. Like many neighborhoods in the south, Highland Springs has a street named after Robert E. Lee. The community also includes a Washington Street.

The population was 8,089 at the 2010 census. The town is most famous for the curing and production of the Smithfield ham. The Virginia General Assembly passed a statute defining \\"Smithfield ham\\" by law in 1926, with one of the requirements that it be processed within the town limits. Smithfield Foods, a Chinese Fortune 500 company that owns Smithfield Packing Company and others, is the world's largest pork processor and hog producer. The company, based in Smithfield, raises 12 million hogs and processes 20 million pounds of them annually. History and industry Smithfield, first colonized in 1634, is located on the Pagan River, south of Jamestown and on the south side of the James River. The Native Americans knew this area as Warascoyak, also spelled Warrosquoyacke, meaning \\"point of land.\\" The Virginia colony officially formed Warrosquyoake Shire (with numerous variant spellings, including Warrascoyack, Warrascocke and \\"Warwick Squeak\\") in 1634, but it had already been known as \\"Warascoyack County\\" before this. It was renamed as Isle of Wight County in 1637. In 1730, the Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730 established \\"Warricksqueak Bay, in Isle of Wight County\\" as the site of an official tobacco inspection house. The town was established as a seaport in 1752 by Arthur Smith IV. The original survey and plat of the Town of Smithfield was made by Jordan Thomas, County Surveyor, for Captain Arthur Smith in 1750.Isle of Wight County Clerk's Office As a river town, its life and growth were dependent on the river. \\"Wharf Hill\\" was the waterfront location of the beginning of the industries of Smithfield. They eventually included peanuts and the raising of pork as commodities, leading to the city claiming the titles of \\"Peanut Capital of the World\\" and \\"Ham Capital of the World.\\" George Purdie, a County Justice and Postmaster of Smithfield during his lifetime, in 1763 purchased Lots 4 and 5 of the original plat of the Town of Smithfield. Purdie's neighbor, Captain Mallory Todd, developed the business of curing and shipping the hams that has made Smithfield world-famous. The peanut industry continued until the fire of 1921, which destroyed the peanut warehouses. The peanut trade moved to the nearby railroad hub of Suffolk, Virginia. Military actions of both the Revolutionary and Civil War took place in and around the town, as it was considered strategic due to its proximity to the James River. Revolutionary Patriots used Wharf Hill as a safe harbor for receiving arms and supplies, and a vantage point for directing Federal cannon fire on Main Street. Its dock has welcomed the fictional drama of the real \\"Show Boat\\" (James Adams Floating Theatre). The Mansion on Main was the showplace home of a Victorian-era \\"Virginian of Virginians\\", Richard Samuel \\"R.S.\\" Thomas (1837‚Äì1915). It was restored by Sala Clark in the late 1990s. His 1889 \\"urban\\" Queen Ann-style mansion changed the face of Smithfield (which had been dominated by colonial and cottage styles). Thomas helped to preserve the 1632 St. Luke's Church, which in the late 20th century was recognized as a National Historic Landmark. Thomas literally \\"wrote the book\\" on St. Luke's Church, The Old Brick Church Near Smithfield, Virginia, specifically to champion recognition of its 1632 date of construction and legacy. He presented his work to the Virginia Historical Society on December 22, 1891. He wrote: \\"It is my object to prove that this Church was built in 1632, and I shall prove it, 1. By the existence at that early date, of such strong, religious sentiment, as demanded a house of worship to the living God; 2. By tradition; 3. By lately existing records; and ‚Äì 4.

During the first half of the 17th century, the Confederacy and the English colonists who established their first permanent settlement at Jamestown in 1607 were frequently in conflict. By mid-century, the Natives had been largely overcome, including the area of Cinquoteck, by the ever-expanding Colony of Virginia. By treaty, the colonial government established reservations for the Mattaponi and Pamunkey in this area. More than 350 years later, Pamunkey and Mattaponi tribal members continue to occupy the reservations, located a few miles north of modern-day West Point. Both are state-recognized tribes, which now number 11. In 1655, Port Richmond West Plantation, the home of John West, was developed to incorporate the former site of Cinquetock. West was a Governor of Virginia from 1635 to 1637. Houses in a residential section of West Point After the West family sold off parts of the plantation, a settlement started at what became called West Point, which had access to the York River. In 1691, the Virginia General Assembly directed that West Point be chartered as a port of entry on the York. In 1705 the House of Burgesses authorized the town to qualify as a \\"free borough\\", and renamed it \\"Delaware\\" in honor of former Royal Governor Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr. He was John West's elder brother, an early settler of Jamestown, and an earlier colonial governor. When the Richmond and York River Railroad was built and completed in 1861 to the port community, just before the onset of the American Civil War, the city took back its former name of \\"West Point\\". The railroad was a key strategic goal of Union General George B. McClellan's failed Peninsula Campaign in 1862 to capture Richmond. Massively damaged during the War, the railroad was later rebuilt. It became part of the Richmond and Danville Railroad system. In 1870, West Point became an incorporated town. Linked to Richmond by rail, it became a major shipping point for passenger and freight traffic. It was especially convenient for travel to Baltimore and points north via the York River and the Chesapeake Bay. Much of the Richmond and Danville Railroad (including the section between Richmond and West Point) became part of the Southern Railway in the 1890s during a financial reorganization. Until the early 20th century, West Point was a thriving commercial port and resort destination. However, the port status declined with the completion of more railroads to the ocean harbor area of Hampton Roads, notably including the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway at Newport News and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad at Portsmouth. Likewise, tourists began to frequent newer destinations closer to the ocean. After the decline of both shipping and tourism, a shipyard built in 1917 and a 1918 pulp paper mill are credited with bringing new jobs to the town. In the 1980s, the railroad was acquired by the Norfolk Southern Railway system in continued restructuring of the industry. It has continued to serve the town's paper mill into the early 21st century. Affectionately referred to by its residents as a Small River Town. Public schools West Point is one of two towns in Virginia to have a school division (terminology for a school district in Virginia) which is independent from the school division of the county in which it is located. (The other town with an independent school division is Colonial Beach, located in Westmoreland County in the Northern Neck region.) The West Point school systems are consistently recognized among the top rated public schools in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The High School boosts an athletic department with a rich history which has sent many former students on to play collegiate sports, such as, Duke Thorpe (Virginia Tech), Aaron Roone (University of Richmond, Pittsburgh Steelers), Johhny Payne (Virginia Tech), Joe Gedro (Virginia Military Institute), Lindsay Brizendine (William & Mary).

The population was 506 as of the 2010 census. Geography Hamilton is located 6 miles west of the county seat Leesburg at (39.133889, ‚àí77.664151), near the western base of Catoctin Mountain. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.2 square miles (0.6 km2), all of it land. History The present Town of Hamilton was once occupied by several native tribes. European settlers arrived in the 1730s. In 1768, George and Tabitha Roach Tavenner built the first house in the Hamilton area. Their son, Richard and his wife Ann Hatcher, built an estate called Harmony and the surrounding area was thereafter known as Harmony. The Leesburg and Snickers Gap Turnpike Company opened a road connecting Leesburg and Snickersville in 1831. Growth ensued and by 1833, the area had enough population to sustain Harmony Methodist Church, which was built on land donated by Richard and Ann Hatcher Tavenner. The town also became known as Hamilton Store after a store founded there by Charles Bennett Hamilton. In 1835, John Quincy Adams approved a post office located in Hamilton's store and the town's name was recorded as Hamilton. The last important Civil War action in Loudoun County, known as The Harmony Skirmish, took place on March 21, 1865 as confederate Colonel John S. Mosby and his troops surprised troops commanded by Colonel Marcus Reno. By 1868, a steam railroad from Alexandria had come to Hamilton along the future route of the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad. Many tourists came to the town seeking relief from the city's heat. There was a one and 1/2 mile boardwalk that traversed the town and a dance hall. By 1900, the Town of Hamilton was Loudoun County's second largest town. The booming businesses in Hamilton included two newspapers, a butcher shop, a men's clothing store, a broom factory, a milliner, a dentist, two hardware stores, a stove shop, a flat racecourse, a livery stable and boarding houses. The advent of the automobile led to a slow decline in tourism. In 1926, many of the town's central businesses were destroyed by fire and tourism thereafter declined sharply. Hamilton has since been known more as a residential community. The Hamilton Masonic Lodge, Janney House, William Smith House, Spring Hill Farm, and Sunnyside Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

History, culture and notes Hillsboro, originally spelled Hillsborough, lies in the Hillsboro Gap of the Short Hill Mountain, which is part of the Blue Ridge Mountains in northwestern Virginia. The town is about 55 miles northwest of downtown Washington, D.C. and 10 miles southeast of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Early settlement in this area was stimulated by the growth of population in Pennsylvania of Germans and Quakers seeking religious freedom. Looking south for new, fertile lands to farm, many Quaker families migrated to the Loudoun area and had a significant impact on its development. The first record of settlement in the Hillsboro area, when referred to as the Gap, is dated 1746. Records of twice monthly meetings of the Gap Quakers, held in one of the houses, date to 1755. \\"Although there were mills and houses in the Gap in the late 1700s, the town of Hillsboro (spelled Hillsborough until its 1880 incorporation) was not formally established until December 31, 1802 by an act passed by the Virginia General Assembly. The trustees of Hillsboro named in the act were Mahlon Hough, Samuel Purcell, Jr., Thomas Leslie, Josiah White, Jr., Edward Cunard, Mahlon Roach, and Thomas D. Stevens. By June 20, 1811, when Henry Griffin bought lot No. 12 on the town plat at auction for $88.50 paid to the trustees, he was required to build \\"a House thereon Twelve feet Square or equal thereto with a Stone or Brick Chimney to the same and a Shingle Roof on it within Four years of the Day of the Sale of the said lott.\\" Due to its favorable location on the Vestal's Gap Road, the town grew quickly and in the early 1800s was one of the leading trade centers of western Loudoun, along with Snickerville (Bluemont) and Woodgrove, which has since disappeared. Much of Hillsboro's activity was due to its mills, with as many as five operating at one time, all on Catoctin Creek or its nearby branches.\\" Hillsboro, Memories of a Mill Town A row of nineteenth century houses in Hillsboro During this period there typically were three or four doctors in town, five or six general stores, a large tanyard and cooper shop, two shoemakers and three taverns. Two blacksmiths, two saddle and harness makers, two wagon makers and a livery stable tended to the needs found in the horsepowered era. Seamstresses and tailors made clothes from the yarn goods produced by the Gaver woolen mill. However the newly constructed railroads and turnpikes bypassed Hillsboro, drawing trade and commerce away from the town. The Civil War events, including the Burning Raid of 1864, devastated the area. During the post-Civil War period, Hillsboro began its transformation from a busy commercial center to a primarily residential community. Homes formerly housing taverns, shops and stores gradually became residences. With the turn of the 20th century, virtually all of the currently existing structures within the town had been built and little has been altered in the majority of the structures since then. Until 2000 there were no street addresses for the buildings in town; the 60-odd buildings in Hillsboro were referred to by their owners' names or their purposes. Old Stone School in Hillsboro A central feature of the town is its affectionately named \\"Old Stone School.\\" Originally named Locust Grove Academy, the oldest part of the building, the east wing, was built in 1874. The Academy's first principal was Mrs. J.B. White. The Old Stone School, as it is referred to now, is situated astride the eastern entrance to the town on Route 9. The stone structure was completed in 1917 with the addition of more rooms on the west side. A junior high school was established there in 1918, and operated for 17 years, until 1935. The brick auditorium was added in 1929. Classes for Grades One through Seven were taught there until the spring of 1966, when Hillsboro Elementary opened. The school was the hub of the community in the early 1900s. Community plays were frequently held there with a local orchestra that played during intermission. Located next to the Old Stone School is Hillsboro Charter Academy, which opened in 2016 inside the former Hillsboro Elementary. The Hillsboro Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 7, 1979.

History Following the 1722 Treaty of St. Albans which established the Blue Ridge Mountains as the buffer between Native Americans and white settlers, German immigrants began arriving in the northern Loudoun Valley to farm the rich topsoil. They established several villages, many constructed of log and wooden buildings, and began to expand their land holdings. Lovettsville was then called The German Settlement.

The population was 7,727 according to the 2010 Census. Purcellville is the major population center for Western Loudoun and the Loudoun Valley. , many of the older structures remaining in Purcellville reflect the Victorian architecture popular during the early 20th century. Patrick Henry College is located in the town. History Although the first land grant in the area was issued by Lord Fairfax in 1740, it was not until 1764 that Purcellville's first known settler, James Dillon from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, arrived. The early ox cart track which wound westward from Leesburg towards the Blue Ridge, known later as the \\"Great Road,\\" served as the town's nucleus, although farms existed in the area, and Ketoctin Baptist Church had been founded nearby by 1752. The first recorded business, an ordinary (a combined store and inn), was established by Abraham Vickers in 1799. This was followed by a second ordinary, established by Stacey Taylor in 1804, and later by \\"Purcel's Store\\" and Post Office, established by Valentine Vernon Purcell (from whom the town's name is derived). A blacksmith's shop, established around 1848, was also among Purcellville's earliest businesses. On July 9, 1853 the village officially adopted the name Purcellville The Great Road became an authorized turnpike in 1785 and extended the turnpike system westward from Alexandria to Snickers Gap, and beyond to Berryville and Winchester. With the construction of this Turnpike in 1832, travel through Purcellville began to increase and the first stagecoach arrived in 1841. A railroad link on the Alexandria, Loudoun, and Hampshire line (forerunner to the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad) connecting the town to Leesburg and points east was built prior to the Civil War, and travel to points further west were continued by stagecoach through Purcellville. Although both Union and Confederate armies passed through Purcellville during the Civil War, the town witnessed limited fighting with the most notable action occurring at the skirmish of Heaton's Crossroads. The town and surrounding area were contained within the area known as Mosby's Confederacy, the main area of operations for Confederate partisan John S. Mosby, and the town was pillaged as part of The Burning Raid of 1864 in retribution for the area's support of Mosby's command. When the railroad was extended to Purcellville in 1874, the town took Leesburg's place as the beginning of the stage route until the railroad was extended to Round Hill in 1875. The Southern Railway constructed the still-existing Purcellville Train Station in 1891. The railroad ceased operation in 1968. Its right-of-way serves as the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park, which has its western terminus at the station. The first public school was built in 1883. On March 14, 1908 the town was incorporated by an act of Virginia's General Assembly. In the 20th century, a series of disastrous fires, the first in 1900 and then two more in 1914, virtually wiped out the business district, depriving the town of what remained of its earliest architectural heritage. The town's prominent location in the center of the Loudoun Valley and presence of the railroad helped the town to become the major agricultural center of Western Loudoun and led to redevelopment and expansion of the business district in the early and mid 20th century. In the latter 20th century, widening of Virginia State Route 7 has led to increased suburban development in and around the town and Purcellville's traditional dependence upon agriculture as its primary source of income has since diminished as more and more residents are employed outside of the community . In addition to the Purcellville Train Station, Locust Grove, the Purcellville Historic District, Rich Bottom Farm, and The Tabernacle-Fireman's Field are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The population was 1,725 at the 2010 census, which was down from the 1,821 reported in 2000.  History  Lunenburg County in the Southside region was established on May 1, 1746 in Great Britain's Virginia Colony from Brunswick County. The county is named for the former Duchy of Brunswick-Lunenburg in Germany, because one of the titles also carried by Britain's Hanoverian kings was Duke of Brunswick-Lunenburg. After statehood, Virginia grew as part of the original 13 United States. Beginning in 1816, the Virginia Board of Public Works began providing engineering and financial assistance to internal improvements around the state in transportation which continued during most of the 19th century. However, Lunenburg County had been largely passed by as canals, turnpikes, and railroads were built across much of Virginia. At the beginning of the 20th century, the area which was to become Victoria was mostly farmland (primarily cultivating tobacco) and woodlands.  Born as a railroad town  This aerial shot of Victoria was taken in 1954 looking west. It shows the turntable and roundhouse in the lower left, and the passenger station and Norfolk division offices to the right of the tracks Victoria was founded in 1906 as a planned community on what had been largely undeveloped land during the construction of the Tidewater Railway. This was a new east- west railroad chartered in 1904 with its right of way quietly secured in 1904 and 1905, so as to not alert the competition regarding plans to transport coal originated by its sister Deepwater Railway operating in southern West Virginia. The Tidewater Railway was chartered to cross Virginia from the West Virginia border near Glen Lyn, Virginia in Giles County by way of Roanoke and Suffolk to port at Sewell's Point on Hampton Roads near Norfolk, Virginia. Both railroads were planned and built by the team of mining manager and civil engineer William Nelson Page and industrialist and financier Henry Huttleston Rogers, and added a third Hampton Roads coal exporting railhead to the existing Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (with coal piers at Newport News) and the Norfolk and Western Railway's similar facilities at Norfolk's Lambert's Point. Queen Victoria of England was a favorite of Henry Rogers, and the new town was named in her honor. Victoria was the midpoint of the VGN's Norfolk Division, which extended from Sewell's Point to Roanoke. Designated to be a \\"division point\\" on the railroad (specifically a location for crew changes and servicing of the steam locomotives), Victoria became the location of a large equipment maintenance operation with roundhouse, turntable, coaling and water facilities for servicing steam locomotives, and a large yard. According to author H. Reid in his 1961 book The Virginian Railway, investors recalled the rapid growth of Roanoke between 1882 and 1884, which had been nicknamed the \\"Magic City\\" when the Norfolk and Western (N&W;) had established major facilities at the former bucolic location which had been earlier known as Big Lick. Comparisons were made when speculating about Victoria's future potential. They could also look to nearby Crewe on the N&W; (about 20 miles away from Victoria) to see what a substantial volume of activity and employment a division point on a steam railroad could bring. Predictably, land sales at Victoria were brisk, and buildings (and jobs) soon followed. In 1907, as they began nearing completion, the Tidewater and Deepwater Railways were combined to form the Virginian Railway (VGN). In March, the Tidewater Railway was formally rechartered by the Virginia State Corporation Commission as \\"The Virginian Railway Company\\" and William Nelson Page was elected president on April 15, 1907 at the first new board meeting in Norfolk. On April 22, the Deepwater Railway was acquired, formalizing the marriage of the two roads. Passenger service from Victoria to Norfolk began on June 17, 1907. The trip from Victoria took 12 hours, and operated once daily in each direction except Sundays, according to the first schedules published in the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot newspaper. That first summer and fall, in conjunction with the Norfolk and Southern Railway (a regional predecessor of the 21st century Norfolk Southern System), service was offered to the Jamestown Exposition being held in Norfolk County that same summer. At the Exposition, VGN president Page served as Chief of International Jury of Awards, Mines and Metallurgy. United States President Theodore Roosevelt, attending the Jamestown Exposition, was one of the VGN's earliest passengers, according to author Reid. Adjacent to the Jamestown Exposition site on Hampton Roads at Sewell's Point, a new coal pier was being built. Completion of the entire railroad took 2 additional years. The low gradient VGN was considered an engineering marvel of the time when it was completed in 1909. Soon, coal and other commodities began rolling through Victoria. The new Norfolk Division offices of the railroad were on located on a second floor which was added to the original Victoria passenger station a short time later. The Virginia General Assembly granted a charter and incorporated the Town of Victoria on March 11, 1916. Bechelbronn and Victoria High School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  End of steam, mergers, abandonment  Victoria's importance as a rail point declined sharply in the 1950s when the change to diesel-electric locomotives greatly reduced the labor and facilities needed. The last Virginian passenger train served Victoria in January, 1956. VGN steam operations ended completely in June, 1957. Then, on December 1, 1959, the Virginian Railway merged with the larger Norfolk and Western Railway. Under combined operations, the through coal traffic was shifted from Victoria to the bigger road's main line through Crewe, Virginia, within commuting distance for N&W;'s Victoria-based employees. Local customers on the former VGN line through Victoria and nearby Kenbridge were few, and the portion of the line through Victoria and Kenbridge was eventually abandoned in the 1980s. All tracks and virtually all structures were removed, and a portion of the land donated to the community by N&W.; Much like many other communities all across the United States, the end of steam railroading and the era of mergers and consolidation in the second half of the 20th century reduced rail- oriented employment opportunities and had a generally negative impact upon Victoria and the surrounding area. However, the community and Lunenburg County proved resilient, and by the late 1990s, transportation employment represented only a minimal portion of the area's economy. One of the biggest industries in Victoria is the prison industry. Located two miles from the center of town, the Lunenburg Correctional Center provides employment for many people living in and around Victoria.  Remembering Victoria's rail heritage  Early in the 21st century, work was begun to develop a rail heritage park and obtain a caboose to help present the town's rail heritage. After several years of work, one of the last C-10 cabooses built in-house by VGN employees at the company's massive shops complex in Princeton, West Virginia in the 1950s was located. Rail preservationist, historian, and photographer Kenneth Miller of Roanoke had purchased Caboose 342 in the 1980s, and working with his father, had carefully restored it over a period of years. Miller, a long-time VGN fan, agreed to let Victoria have what is considered by many to be the finest extant VGN caboose for the new rail heritage park. To prepare an appropriate display area for Caboose 342, a short stretch of roadbed was prepared, ballasted, and ties and rail were laid by volunteers in Victoria. The initials \\"H.H.R.\\" and \\"W.N.P.\\" were engraved as a lasting tribute to the founders of the Virginian Railway, industrialist and financier Henry Huttleston Rogers and coal mining manager and civil engineer William Nelson Page. Virginian Railway restored and fully equipped caboose # 342 placed on static display in the town of Victoria Late in 2004, Norfolk Southern carefully transported Caboose 342 from Roanoke to the NS rail yard at Crewe, Virginia by rail. From there, it traveled overland by truck and was placed on the new rails at Victoria on December 22, 2004. In Victoria, it has been placed on display fully equipped, and has become a popular attraction for school groups and retired railroaders alike.

History Boyd Tavern in Boydton, built 1790 and open for tours Mecklenburg County Courthouse in Boydton, completed in 1842 Boydton was founded in 1812 and is the original home of Randolph-Macon College, then very small, and which barely stayed in operation during the American Civil War as its focus abruptly changed from a Methodist seminary to military cadet training. In the difficult post-war Reconstruction years the trustees relocated the remote and struggling school to its present location in Ashland, Virginia, closer to railroad service. Boydton/Clarksville was the terminus of the 19th-century \\"Boydton and Petersburg Plank Road\\" leading to Petersburg. This 80-mile (130-km) Plank road was covered with wooden planks, making it superior to other roads which were just unpaved dirt and rutted. The Boyd's Tavern is an 18th-century structure originally operated by merchant Alexander Boyd, a Scottish immigrant, which in recent years has been restored by his descendants and opened to public tours. In 1952 the large Kerr Lake was created nearby, drawing many boaters, campers, and fishermen to the local area (see Clarksville, Virginia).

The population was 21,041 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Montgomery County. Christiansburg, Blacksburg and the city of Radford are the three principal municipalities of the Blacksburg‚ÄìChristiansburg Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses those municipalities, all of Montgomery County, and three other counties. History= European discovery, founding (1671-1792)  In 1671, the New River ‚Äì one of the world's oldest rivers ‚Äì was discovered by early settlers of German, French, Scot-Irish and English descent. Along the river, there were several Native American encampments, and conflicts were common between those tribes and the early settlers. As settlers began moving into present-day Christiansburg, they discovered that area was also inhabited by the Shawnee and other Native American tribes. In the late 1600s, Dutch priest Friar Hans arrived in the region; it was named Hans Meadow after him in the early 1700s. In the 18th century, the region was settled by pioneers from Pennsylvania and eastern Virginia. In 1776, Montgomery County was formed from part of Fincastle County. The City of Radford, as well as parts of Floyd, Giles and Pulaski counties, were all subsequently formed from Montgomery County land. The Town of \\"Christiansburgh\\" ‚Äì as it was originally spelled ‚Äì was named in honor of Colonel William Christian, who was an early settler in the region. He was one of the first justices of Fincastle County, a member of the Virginia Legislature, and brother-in-law of Patrick Henry. Theodore Roosevelt, in his history The Winning of the West, later wrote that Colonel Christian was a \\"noted Indian fighter\\" and a \\"very gallant and honorable man.\\" Developing from a concentration of taverns and rest stops along the Great Wilderness Road (present-day U.S. Route 11), the original 1.1-square mile Town was established on November 10, 1792, by an act passed by the Virginia General Assembly. The Town of Christiansburg was later incorporated on January 7, 1833.  Notable early settlers  George Washington was known to have visited Christiansburg during the early years of settlement. Frontiersman Daniel Boone resided in town for a time. Among records in the County Courthouse is a warrant dated 1774 for the arrest of Boone on a debt charge. The warrant was issued under King George's name but marked \\"Not executed ‚Äì Gone to Kentucky.\\" Boone later repaid the debt. Davy Crockett lived in Christiansburg and served as an apprentice to a local newspaper printer for a short time. Crockett also worked at John Snider's Hattery Shop, located on W. Main Street, for 18 months. William Clark, of the famous Lewis and Clark Expedition, resided in Christiansburg. He lived in downtown Christiansburg in the existing house at 109 E. Main Street, which is commonly known as the Montague home. Meriwether Lewis also visited Christiansburg on occasion.  Early years (1793-1860)  Christiansburg experienced significant growth in the early 1800s, and by 1840, the population had grown to 400. Most residential growth was confined to Main Street and Cross Street (now Franklin Street). Several industrial complexes developed around the Gardner Zink Mill west of Town and the Chrisman Mill along Crab Creek (on what is now State Route 661/Chrisman Mill Road). These two mills were responsible for the centralization of a number of area milling operations in the late 1700s. New streets were laid out during the early 1800s, and additional construction included a number of churches and a public well and pumps, which were placed just north of the Courthouse in 1826. Ten years later, a public privy was built near the public square, and a new courthouse was constructed in March 1836 in the east corner of the public square. The Christiansburg (Cambria) Depot in the community of Cambria was established on the Virginia Tennessee Railroad line in 1854. Downtown Christiansburg was the site of the Lewis-McHenry Duel on May 9, 1808. The rifle duel between Thomas Lewis and John McHenry, which killed both men, led to the passage of the Barbour Bill in 1810, outlawing dueling in Virginia. Former Town resident Dr. John Floyd was the attending surgeon at the Lewis- McHenry duel and later governor of Virginia, as well as a member of Congress. He was also the father of John Buchanan Floyd, who served as governor of Virginia from 1849 to 1852. Pennsylvanian artist Lewis Miller was fascinated with Montgomery County's scenery, and throughout the 1830s through the 1850s, he often stayed in Christiansburg to depict Town scenes. After the Civil War, Miller retired to Christiansburg and spent his last 20 years living with relatives and friends. The Montgomery Museum and Lewis Miller Regional Art Center, located at 300 Pepper Street SE, is named for him.  Civil War and Reconstruction (1861-1899)  Many men from the Christiansburg area served under General T.J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War. Christiansburg was invaded several times by Union Forces operating under W.W. Averell, and in 1864, the Union Army burned all of the Christiansburg Depot structures except the passenger station. Confederate forces were active within the Christiansburg area and occupied a number of buildings in and around the Town. The Lattimer Plantation, which once stood on the Christiansburg High School site, was used as a Confederate headquarters. The nearby Montgomery White Sulphur Springs resort in Ellett Valley was utilized as a hospital from 1861 to 1865. Near the end of the war, Union General George B. Stoneman and his men were in Christiansburg and had established headquarters in the Rice D. Montague home, which still stands at 109 E. Main Street. His men were stationed there when news came of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Following the Civil War, the population of Christiansburg experienced a decline that continued throughout the 19th century. In 1870, there were 864 people in the Town, and by 1900, there were only 659.  Christiansburg Institute  Captain Charles S. Schaeffer, an agent of the Freedmen's Bureau, founded the Christiansburg Normal Institute (renamed the Christiansburg Industrial Institute) in 1866. The school was formed as a private primary school for the education of black children and was located on Zion Hill, between the Town and the old Christiansburg (Cambria) Depot. Booker T. Washington served as superintendent of the Institute from 1896 until his death in 1915 and was instrumental in expanding the curriculum to include both classical instruction and practical instruction in industry and the trades. The school was relocated to Lattimer Plantation in 1898 and was significantly expanded in the following years, growing to 14 buildings and 185 acres. George Washington Carver and other members of the Tuskegee University staff visited CII, and prominent industrial engineer John Wines Lester lived on the CII campus. The Institute came under lease by the Montgomery County School System in 1935. The property was transferred to Montgomery County Schools in 1947, establishing it as a full- fledged public school. The Christiansburg Institute was the first black high school in southwestern Virginia and was also the first high school in Montgomery County to receive accreditation with the Virginia Public School System. It remained in operation as a segregated high school until 1966 when desegregation brought its closure.  Early 20th century (1900-1945)  By the early 1900s, Christiansburg had taken on many of the functions of a regional center, with a bank, newspaper, Temperance Hall and photographer. Telephone service was provided by the Montgomery Intelligence Company, which was incorporated in 1886. Agriculture played an important part in the local and regional economy, and livestock were regularly driven to market down Main Street or taken to the Christiansburg Depot. A fire following a temperance march in 1900 destroyed several buildings along West Main Street in the downtown area. Despite this fire, Christiansburg experienced vigorous growth in the first decade of the 20th century, growing from 659 persons in 1900 to 1,568 in 1910. The success of the Norfolk and Western Railroad's Christiansburg Depot, which served as the main shipping point for much of Montgomery County, contributed to much of this growth. Several new houses were built between the Town center and the Depot, and the Depot area community was eventually incorporated as the Town of Cambria in 1906. The completion of U.S. Route 11 ‚Äì the first interstate highway in America ‚Äì was celebrated in Christiansburg when the last link passing through downtown was hard surfaced in 1926. By 1929, Virginia Polytechnic Institute was providing employment for the area's citizens through academic positions and mining jobs related to the school's coal-operated power plant. The depression years were notable for Christiansburg for an unusual reason: Christiansburg's Post Office was one of approximately two dozen locations in Virginia to receive Mural American Artwork or sculptures, which were created through Roosevelt's Works Project Administration. Christiansburg's mural is entitled Great Road and was completed in 1939 by John DeGroot.  Post World War II (1946-1965)  Following World War II, Christiansburg rapidly industrialized. The Southern Dairies Plant (which later became a part of Sealtest) opened, and The Roberts' Motel ‚Äì the first of its kind in Southwestern Virginia ‚Äì also debuted after the war. Virginia Tech continued to expand, and by the mid-1950s, the school owned 2,000 acres in Montgomery County and employed more than 1,400 individuals. In 1953, the Starlite Drive-In opened and continues to operate as one of the few remaining drive-in theatres in the United States. The 1950s were most noted for the number of devastating fires that occurred in Town. In 1954, Roses' 5&10 and Cavalier Furniture were both destroyed. Catastrophe struck again in 1956, destroying most of the businesses on East Main Street. In a single fire, the Town lost the City Market, Royal Cafe, Smith & Jones, Jennings Barber Shop and Interiors by Richard. Fires in 1957 claimed Simmons Shoe Shop, the Blue Moon Lunch and the rebuilt Jennings Barber Shop. A major fire on Main Street (now Cambria Street, N.E.) in Cambria in 1959 destroyed many of the oldest and most historic buildings there. Having lost most of its taxpaying enterprises and faced with failing utilities, the Town of Cambria proposed and was accepted for consolidation with the Town of Christiansburg on December 31, 1965.  Modernization (1966 ‚Äì present)  The Town of Christiansburg continued to grow in the 1970s and 1980s, and two annexations added approximately 3,799 residents. A 1988 annexation incorporated Belmont Farms, the New River Valley Mall (which was under construction on the effective date), what had been the Virginia Tech Horticulture Farm (on the northern end of Town) and the Top of Christiansburg Mountain (on the eastern end of Town). The Town underwent two boundary adjustments in the 1990s, which incorporated the Falling Branch Industrial Park and a portion of the Marketplace shopping center and the Christiansburg Industrial Park. In 2000, the Spradlin Farms area began development, providing an additional retail space to the Town. In 2002, a large portion of both Blacksburg and Christiansburg, as well as a portion of Montgomery County, were designated as a part of an \\"urbanized area\\" based upon 2000 Census figures. In 2007, the New River Center was constructed just north of the New River Valley Mall, which added another large retail development to the Town. Also in 2007, the Town of Christiansburg and Montgomery County agreed to an adjustment, which brought 49.816 acres and approximately 66 persons into Town (with one single-family house and Wheatland Retirement Community accounting for the population). In a 2009 boundary adjustment, the Town added the area of the Christiansburg Middle School, Harkrader Sports Complex and former Harkrader Farm, which brought in 170.318 acres and approximately six residents. Geography Christiansburg is located at (37.141164, ‚àí80.407700). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 14.3 square miles. The Town is located at the crossroads of three major highways: Interstate 81, U.S. Route 460 and U.S. Route 11. I-81 forms the primary north-south thoroughfare from Maryland to Tennessee; U.S. Route 460 links Christiansburg with the Town of Blacksburg, approximately a half mile to the north; and U.S. Route 11 provides a direct connection with the City of Radford, approximately 10 miles to the west. U.S. Routes 11 and 460 dually connect Christiansburg to Roanoke to the northeast.

The population was 1,009 as of the 2010 U.S.Decennial Census. History Cape Charles, located close to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, on Virginia's Eastern Shore, was founded in 1884 as a planned community by railroad and ferry interests. In 1883, William Lawrence Scott became president of the New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad Company (NYP&N;), and purchased three plantations comprising approximately 2,509 acres from the heirs of former Virginia Governor Littleton Waller Tazewell. Of this land, 40 acres were ceded to the NYP&N;, and 136 acres went to create the Town of Cape Charles (technically known as the \\"Municipal Corporation of Cape Charles\\"). Some of this land, named Cape Charles for the geographical cape found on the Point and headland to the south, Scott sold to the Railroad Company to serve as the southern terminus of the line on the Delmarva Peninsula from the Northeast states. In that same year, construction of the railroad began. In Cape Charles, the Railroad Company built a harbor port to handle steamships and freighters from Cape Charles to Norfolk. The original Town was surveyed, platted, and laid out with approximately 136 acres divided into 644 equal lots. Seven wider avenues which run from east to west were named for Virginia statesmen and political leaders; the streets which run north and south were named for fruits. The original layout of the Town is still very visible today. Historian William G. Thomas writes, \\"At a cost of nearly $300,000, the New York, Pennsylvania, and Norfolk Railroad (N.Y.P. & N. R.R.) was dredging a new harbor out of a large fresh-water lagoon between King's and Old Plantation creeks in lower Northampton County, and Scott planned to develop a new town around it called Cape Charles City. The appellation \\"City\\" for any place on the Eastern Shore was romantic, a vision of the future that the railroad might make possible....In 1890, the United States Army Corps of Engineers dredged the harbor basin, its entrance, and a channel through Cherrystone Inlet and built stone jetties protecting the harbor outlet. By 1912 the Engineer Corps estimated that Cape Charles harbor handled 2,500,000 tons of freight a year.\\" Industrial landscape in Cape Charles Cape Charles was, for many years, the terminal for the Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry, providing passenger and car ferry service across the mouth of the Bay to Norfolk Portsmouth, Virginia Beach and Chesapeake on the SouthSide / Tidewater and across Hampton Roads harbor to Hampton - Newport News on the northern Virginia Peninsula. The last ferry left Cape Charles in 1963. Cape Charles served as a terminal for railway freight barges that carried rail cars from the former Eastern Shore Railroad which later became Bay Coast Railroad across the mouth of the Bay to Norfolk. The Bay Coast Railroad ceased operations in 2018. There is also a cement factory nearby. The town hosted the Northampton Red Sox in the old Eastern Shore Baseball League. The Cape Charles Historic District and Stratton Manor are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 1,134 people, 536 households, and 278 families residing in the town. The population density was 309.4 people per square mile (119.3/km2).

Geography Cape Charles is located at (37.267522, ‚àí76.014125). Cape Charles lies on a peninsula and is surrounded by water on three sides. The town is situated directly on the Chesapeake Bay, bordered by King's Creek to the north and Old Plantation Creek to the south. The land in town is low lying and relatively flat, with the highest point of elevation at 15 feet, and a slope of less than 1%. Most of the developed land in town is between 5 and 10 feet in elevation. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 4.4 square miles (11.3 km2), of which, 3.7 square miles (9.5 km2) of it is land and 0.7 square miles (1.8 km2) of it (16.06%) is water. The Chesapeake Bay impact crater formed about 35 million years ago during the late Eocene when a comet fragment or asteroid struck the U.S. Atlantic continental shelf in the area now occupied by the southern part of Chesapeake Bay and adjacent landmasses in the Virginia Coastal Plain. The resulting structure is an approximately circular, 53-mile-diameter crater centered near the town of Cape Charles. Recreation The town owns one of two public beaches on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, and the only public beach on the bayside of the Eastern Shore. The beach extends one-half mile along Bay Avenue with a paved walkway bordering the length of the beachfront. Residents and visitors of the town use the beach for swimming, sunbathing, and similar recreational pursuits. Public access onto the beachfront is provided by two wooden walkovers located near the end of Tazewell and Randolph Avenues, as well as the town's Fun Pier which also has a wooden walkover. The beach is stabilized with buried groins and a bulkhead. In 1987 the Army Corps of Engineers dredged the harbor and channel and deposited the sand along the beach area, which greatly expanded the width of the beach and improved the quality of sand along the beachfront. Beach erosion is an ongoing problem and will require sand replenishment on a periodic basis in order to maintain a sandy beachfront. Adjacent to the public beach is a municipal pier which extends across the stone jetty at the entrance of the harbor. The wooden pier, which is known as the Fun Pier, has a railed siding and several built-in benches, and is frequently utilized by Town residents and visitors for sightseeing. Cape Charles is also home to one of six public boat ramp sites in Northampton County, and one of only three sites on the County's Bayside. The nearby 29-acre Cape Charles Natural Area Preserve, owned by Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, has a long boardwalk that traverses several natural communities, including a Maritime Loblolly Pine Forest, and ends at a low bluff overlooking the Chesapeake Bay. The preserve provides habitat for the federally threatened northeastern beach tiger beetle and is part of the Lower Delmarva Important Bird Area. During fall bird migration, the forest abounds with migratory songbirds and raptors resting and feeding before continuing their journey across the Chesapeake Bay. Industry The Cape Charles Harbor serves local industry and commerce operations as well as tourists and recreational users. The harbor was originally developed to load and unload railroad cars on barges. The harbor includes extensive bulkheading, as well as commercial docking facilities for industrial uses. The Industrial land use in the Town is concentrated at the Cape Charles Harbor area, and includes the Eastern Shore Railroad, Bayshore Concrete, the commercial dock and the Sustainable Technology Park. Climate Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Cape Charles features a humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and chilly, but not very cold winters. Temperatures routinely exceed 90 ¬∞F in the summer and typically dips below the freezing point during the winter, though it is somewhat rare for temperatures to dip far below freezing. Cape Charles on average receives roughly 45 inches of precipitation annually.

History  The present town of Eastville is situated near the sites of the first English settlements made on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. In 1620, Thomas Savage, having been trained as an interpreter and working with the Virginia Company to secure land on the shore from the indigenous cultures there, settled on land that in time came to be known as ‚ÄúSavage Neck,‚Äù a few miles southwest of Eastville. By the last quarter of the 17th century, Henry Matthews had settled on the tract of land covering the present town. In 1677, Northampton County residents petitioned for the county court to be moved to a more central location, suggesting Matthew‚Äôs home. The first courthouse was completed in 1690 and a small community developed to serve the needs of the court called ‚ÄúThe Horns,‚Äù named for the several peninsulas of land which extended west into the Chesapeake Bay from the area. Not until almost a century later in 1773 was the town laid out and officially named Northampton Court House. The last decade of the 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th century saw significant growth and development, including the construction of a third courthouse in 1795, the building of a tavern adjacent to the court green, and several large homes which remain a core part of the town‚Äôs historic landscape today, including Cessford, Park Hall, and Ingleside, all examples of Georgian and Federal architecture. The town was known as Northampton Court House and Peachburg until the name Eastville was officially given to the community around 1800.

Infrastructure and attractions Nearby Fort Pickett was established by the U.S. Army in 1941 and was a very large training center during World War II. It was closed by the BRAC Commission in the 1990s and is now the headquarters for the Virginia National Guard. In May 2014 the U.S. Department of State selected Fort Pickett as the site of their Foreign Affairs Security Training Center, which will train 8,000 to 10,000 students a year, many of them diplomats. Details of the Center's construction are still being worked out. The 2-year Blackstone Female Institute / Blackstone College for Girls also operated in Blackstone for many years. The buildings and grounds were later used as the Virginia United Methodist Assembly Center (VUMAC), drawing 19,000 visitors a year before closing in 2016. The Blackstone shopping district (including a Wal-Mart, outpatient medical center, and livestock market) attracts customers from a large 3-county rural area. The town recently received a Main Street designation from the state, and a $1 million downtown revitalization project started in 2008. In 2009 the town opened the $4 million James Harris medical center. The Town of Blackstone also has regional bus terminal that serves 11 counties. The oldest building in town is Schwartz Tavern, built in stages from 1790 to 1840, now used as a museum. Bevell's Hardware, a local business, displays a giant 58' by 20' (17.7 by 6.1 meter) model railroad layout that attracts thousands of visitors each year from Thanksgiving weekend (end of November) through mid-January.

The population was 432 at the 2010 census. The source of the town name is disputed. The town is located on the crossroads of U.S. Routes 360 and 460. Businesses in the small town of Burkeville include a stone quarry, a Southern States Cooperative store, and a John Deere dealership. Bassett Furniture operated a veneer factory in Burkeville for many years but it has closed. The Nottoway Correctional Center is located in Burkeville as is the Piedmont Geriatric Hospital. There is also a camp retreat for the blind.  History  Burksville and Jennings Ordinary Area of Nottoway County, Virginia, 1864 The town was named either for a tavern or a Samuel Burke. It was formerly \\"Burke's Junction.\\" It formed at the junction of the Richmond and Danville Railroad and the Southside Railroad in the mid-nineteenth century. The Southside became the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad in 1870 and then a line in the Norfolk and Western Railway and the Norfolk Southern Railway. The rail line from Burkville to Pamplin City was converted by Virginia Department of Parks and Recreation into High Bridge Trail State Park. The last Civil War battle before the surrender at Appomattox was fought nearby at Sayler's Creek on April 6, 1865. Here were surrendered more men (without terms) than in any other battle on American soil. General Robert E. Lee's depleted forces lost over 7,000 men killed, wounded, or taken prisoner at either Sayler's Creek or at General Gordon's engagement the same day, a few miles west. This led Lee to surrender at Appomattox three days later. Ella Grahamn Agnew, in 1910 in Burkeville, was appointed the first State Agent for women by the United States Department of Agriculture and was the first woman to be appointed by the Department to represent it in the field. She had moved to the town as a baby and was later buried in the community's Sunset Cemetery. Polk Miller, renowned old time banjo-player, story-teller, veterinarian, and Confederate veteran, was born on a plantation just west of Burkeville in 1844. Though he moved to Richmond shortly before the Civil War, he paid homage to his Southside roots through his music and story-telling, in which he engaged himself professionally in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, sharing a stage on occasion with Mark Twain, and becoming the first known artist to record music with a mixed-race ensemble.

The population was 2,326 at the 2010 census. History Crewe was founded in 1888 as a central location to house steam locomotive repair shops for the Norfolk & Western Railroad (now called Norfolk Southern) which has a rail yard there for east-west trains carrying Appalachian coal to Hampton Roads for export abroad, and the street pattern was laid out at that time. It was named for the large railroad town of Crewe, England. The railroad repair facility's importance diminished sharply in the 1950s, as the switch to diesel-electric locomotives required less labor and equipment. Crewe has a small railroad museum.

History James Madison Museum Bank of America in Orange Post Office County Courthouse and Confederate monument Holladay House This area of the Piedmont was occupied by Siouan-speaking peoples at the time of European encounter. Tribes located in coastal areas generally spoke Algonquian languages. Pre-Civil War The present-day Town of Orange was known as the Town of Orange Court House prior to the late 19th century. Following the establishment of Culpeper County from a part of Orange County in 1749, the courthouse was relocated to Orange Court House from elsewhere in the county. The court convened in the house of a man named Timothy Crosthwait until 1752; after Crosthwait deeded the two acres to the county, it constructed a new courthouse on the property. The town at that time consisted of the courthouse and its related public buildings, a few houses and stores, a tavern and little else. The first U.S. Post Office was constructed in the town in 1796. In 1801‚Äì1804 the courthouse was replaced with a new building, clerk's office and, later, a new jail.\\"Orange Commercial Historic District.\\" National Register of Historic Places Registration Form.

Verdier divided the land into lots, which helped shape the town's pattern of development. His house, which he named Montpeliso, still stands on the land. Growth continued into the nineteenth century as new roadways were constructed through the town. Along with expanding agricultural markets, the roads helped transform Orange Court House into a regional center. In 1834 the Virginia General Assembly to pass an act allowing for the incorporation of the Town of Orange Court House. But, the act never had implementing legislation. Orange Court House continued growing, with several significant downtown buildings being constructed from this point up to the Civil War, including the Sparks Building (1829) the Holladay House (1830), and the St. Thomas Episcopal Church (1833). These buildings still stand as part of the Orange Commercial Historic District. In 1847 the Orange and Alexandria Railroad chose to route their new railway from Alexandria to Gordonsville through Orange. The county court granted the railroad right-of- way through the courthouse property, which required the courthouse to be moved to another location. The fourth and current courthouse was completed in 1859 in the Italian Villa architectural style and stands today on the corner of Madison Rd and Main St. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The General Assembly passed an act in 1855 which officially incorporated the Town of Orange Court House, but it did not take effect until a majority of citizens qualified to vote consented, which did not occur until after the Civil War.Acts of the General Assembly of Virginia: Passed in 1855‚Äì56, in the Eightieth Year of the Commonwealth.

Orange was a strategically important location during the American Civil War. Just north of town, the Rapidan River was effectively the northern border of the Confederacy from March 1862 to May 1864. Consequently, the area witnessed countless troop movements, patrols, skirmishes, and encampments. In addition, the town of Orange served as General Robert E. Lee's headquarters during that time. General Lee worshipped at the St. Thomas Episcopal Church on Caroline Street, which still stands. This church is also significant as it served as a hospital for Confederate wounded after the Battle of Chancellorsville and the Battle of the Wilderness. Lee passed by this church many times during his stay in Orange. Mort K√ºnstler, an artist of American historical subjects, immortalized this scene in his painting Soldier of Faith.Walker, Frank S.: \\"Remembering: A History of Orange County, Virginia.\\" Orange County Historical Society, 2004.Miller, Ann L.: \\"Antebellum Orange.\\" Moss Publications, 1988. County records dating back to its founding in 1734 were protected by a clerk of court removing them to \\"a place of safety\\" as Federal troops were moving through Orange and towards Richmond. Post-Civil War Numerous buildings constructed soon after the Civil War stand in the downtown historic district. Following Virginia's readmission to the Union in 1870, Orange Court House officially became a town in 1872 when the petition (required by the 1855 General Assembly act) for an election of town trustees was filed in the court. The first town council meeting was held on June 28, 1872. In 1890 the village changed its name officially to the current-day Town of Orange. The economy and population continued to grow up until the time of the 1909 fire, which destroyed most of the eastern portion of town. Like nearby Gordonsville, Orange's importance as a railroad hub began declining in the early twentieth century. Due to its location at the confluence of two major roadways and the establishment of the Orange Automobile Club in 1910, the town became a regional center for automobile sales and services. Its accessibility allowed it to maintain a relatively healthy economy through the Great Depression. A notable company in Orange during that period was American Silk Mills, Inc., which was established in 1929 and processed raw silk into a finished material. During World War II, the mill was awarded a presidential citation for its production of parachutes for Allied troops. Although much of the mid-20th- century industry moved to other locations, the population of Orange has grown steadily up through the 2010 census.

Located between the Garraf Massif and the sea, it is known for its beaches, nightspots, and historical sites. While the roots of Sitges' artistic reputation date back to the late 19th century, when painter Santiago Rusi√±ol took up residence there during the summer, the town became a centre for the 1960s counterculture in mainland Spain, in Francoist Spain, and became known as \\"Ibiza in miniature\\". Today, Sitges' economy is based on tourism and culture offering more than 4,500 hotel beds, half of them in four-star hotels. Almost 35% of the approximately 26,000 permanent inhabitants are from the Netherlands, the UK, France and Scandinavia, whose children attend international schools in the area. There are 17 beaches. Sitges was also the site of the annual Bilderberg conference held in June 2010. Sitges has been referred to as the Saint-Tropez of Spain, with property prices approaching those of the most expensive European cities, the main reason for this being the setting by the sea and the surrounding Parc Natural del Garraf. Proximity to Barcelona-El Prat Airport is also a major advantage. History Human presence in the area dates to at least the Neolithic era, and an Iberian settlement from the 4th century. In the 1st century BC it included two separated villages, later absorbed by the Romans. During the Middle Ages, a castle was built in Sitges, owned by the bishopric of Barcelona, which later ceded it to count Mir Geribert (1041). In the 12th century the town fell under the rule of the Sitges family. The latter held it until 1308, when Agnes of Sitges sold the town to Bernat de Fonollar, after whose death it went to the Pia Almoina, a charitable institution, to which it belonged until 1814. Sitges' economy was mostly based on the production of wine until the economic boom of the 1960s, after which it became a tourist resort. In 1958, the Liberals (see Liberalism in Colombia ) and Conservatives (see Conservatism in Colombia) both met in the city of Sitges and the nearby city of Benidorm to sign a peace treaty instituting Colombia's Consociationalist democracy in agreement called the National Front. Carnival For over a century, Sitges has celebrated Carnestoltes, or Carnival, between the months of February and March, according to the liturgical calendar. The festivities begin on Dijous Gras, or Fat Thursday, with King Carnestoltes‚Äô arrival. They continue until the burial of the sardine ‚Äî late afternoon on Ash Wednesday. Folk dances and xatonades (traditional local salad served with assorted omelets) are also characteristic carnival elements. The two most important moments are the Rua de la Disbauxa, or the Debauchery Parade, on Sunday night and the Rua de l'Extermini, or Extermination Parade, on Tuesday night. Around forty floats with more than 2,000 participants fill Sitges. It is one of people favorites times of year because of this celebration. Many people come from all around to see it. Gastronomy Xat√≥ is Sitges' most typical dish. Its first recorded mention is in local newspaper Eco de Sitges report on Maundy Thursday, published on 16 February 1896. The report refers to a meal that three days before had gathered together a selected group of Catalan artists and intellectuals, including Santiago Rusi√±ol, Miquel Utrillo and Gaiet√† Buigas. The name \\"xat√≥\\" comes from an expression pronounced years before by Canudas, a member of the Rusi√±ol's group. The main ingredients of xat√≥ are endive salad, cod, tuna, anchovies, aubergine and black olives. However, the essence of the dish is its sauce, made with scalded chillies, toasted almonds, garlic, olive oil, salt, vinegar and hot peppers. The complete xat√≥ meal consists of some different omelettes or fricand√≥ (a typical Catalan hot meal) and as a dessert, coca de lardons (typical Catalan cake, made from pork scratchings), served with a bottle of Pened√®s black wine. Sitges cuisine includes many Catalan sailors' dishes such as rice Sitges style, stewed sepia with potatoes and allioli (Catalan garlic sauce), bull de tonyina (made with tuna fish), fideuada (similar to paella, but with noodles and seafood) or stuffed peppers with cod. Malvasia is a delicate liquor wine served in Sitges, primarily with dessert. The name \\"malvasia\\" comes from the Peloponnesian port Monemvas√≠a. In Sitges, the Hospital Sant Joan Baptista continues producing and marketing malvasia according to the traditional method from its own vines and within its own cellars. The proceeds go to charity. The annual production is approximately 4,000 bottles.

A member of the Democratic Farmer-Labor Party, Wellstone was a leader of the progressive wing of the national Democratic Party. Born in Washington D.C., Wellstone attended high school in Arlington, Virginia, graduating from Yorktown High School. Wellstone then graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.A. and Ph.D. in Political Science. He was a professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, and a community organizer in Rice County prior to entering public office. In 1982, he ran an unsuccessful campaign for State Auditor against Republican Arne Carlson. Wellstone gained national attention after his upset victory over Republican incumbent Rudy Boschwitz in the 1990 US Senate election. Widely considered an underdog and outspent by a 7-to-1 margin, he was the only challenger in the country to defeat an incumbent senator in the 1990 cycle. In his 1996 reelection campaign, he defeated Boschwitz in a rematch. He won both Senate elections with 50.4% and 50.3% of the popular vote. In 1999, Wellstone formed an exploratory committee to run for President of the United States in the 2000 election. After campaigning in the early primary states, he announced he would not seek the presidency because of sustained physical limitations from a college wrestling injury. His condition was later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. As Senator, Wellstone authored the Wellstone Amendment for the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. His efforts toward campaign finance reform were overturned in 2010 by the U.S. Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Eleven days before the 2002 U.S. Senate election, Wellstone died in a plane crash in Eveleth, Minnesota. His wife, Sheila, and daughter, Marcia, also died on board. Wellstone's sons, David and Mark, were not on the flight, and until 2018 co-chaired the Wellstone Action nonprofit organization in honor of their parents. The organization was subsequently renamed Re:Power after their departure. Background and education Wellstone was born in Washington, D.C., the second son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants Leon and Minnie Wellstone. His father changed the family name from Wexelstein after encountering antisemitism during the 1930s. Raised in Arlington, Virginia, Wellstone attended Wakefield public schools and Yorktown High School, graduating in 1962. Wellstone attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) on a wrestling scholarship. In college he was an undefeated Atlantic Coast Conference wrestling champion. After his freshman year, he married Sheila Ison Wellstone. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1965, and was elected Phi Beta Kappa. In May 1969, Wellstone earned a Ph.D. in political science from UNC. His doctoral dissertation on the roots of black militancy was titled \\"Black Militants in the Ghetto: Why They Believe in Violence\\". Early career and activism In August 1969, Wellstone accepted a tenure-track position at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, where he taught political science until his election to the Senate in 1990. During the 1970s and 1980s, he also began community organizing, working with the working poor and other politically disenfranchised communities. He founded the Organization for a Better Rice County, a group consisting mainly of single parents on welfare. The organization advocated for public housing, affordable health care, improved public education, free school lunches, and a publicly funded day care center. In 1978, he published his first book, How the Rural Poor Got Power: Narrative of a Grassroots Organizer, chronicling his work with the organization. Wellstone was twice arrested during this period for civil disobedience.http://minnesota.publicradio.org/projects/2010/wellstone- files/feature/ The Federal Bureau of Investigation began a case file on him after his arrest in May 1970 for protesting against the Vietnam War at the Federal Office Building in Minneapolis. In 1984 Wellstone was arrested again, for trespassing during a foreclosure protest at a bank. Wellstone extended his activism to the Minnesota labor movement. In the summer of 1985, he walked the picket line with striking P-9ers during a labor dispute at the Hormel Meat Packing plant in Austin, Minnesota. The Minnesota National Guard was called in during the strike to ensure that Hormel could hire permanent replacement workers. The trustees of Carleton College briefly fired Wellstone in the late 1970s for his activism and lack of academic publications. After his students held a sit-in, the trustees agreed to rehire him and provide him with tenure. Wellstone remains the youngest tenured faculty member in Carleton's history.Lofy, Bill. Paul Wellstone: The Life of a Passionate Progressive. Ann Arbor, MI: The University of Michigan Press, 2005. Pgs. 36‚Äì37. Early political career Wellstone first sought public office in 1982. He received the Democratic nomination for Minnesota State Auditor after an impassioned speech at the state convention. In the general election he garnered 45% of the vote, losing to Republican incumbent, and future Minnesota Governor, Arne Carlson. Wellstone remained active in Democratic politics in the mid-1980s. He served as an elected committeeman for the Democratic National Committee in 1984, and in 1986 began a second campaign for State Auditor before dropping out to tend his mother's failing health. In 1988, Wellstone chaired Jesse Jackson's campaign for the presidency in Minnesota. After the primary, he co- chaired Michael Dukakis's campaign in the state. U.S. Senate campaigns (1990‚Äì2002) Earlier portrait of Wellstone In 1990, Wellstone ran for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Rudy Boschwitz, beginning the race as a serious underdog. He narrowly won the election despite being outspent by a 7-to-1 margin. Wellstone played off his underdog image with quirky, humorous ads created by political consultant Bill Hillsman, including \\"Fast Paul\\" and \\"Looking for Rudy\\", a pastiche of the 1989 Michael Moore documentary Roger & Me. Boschwitz was also hurt by a letter his supporters wrote, on campaign stationery, to members of the Minnesota Jewish community days before the election, accusing Wellstone of being a \\"bad Jew\\" for marrying a Gentile and not raising his children in the Jewish faith. (Boschwitz, like Wellstone, is Jewish.) Wellstone's reply, widely broadcast on Minnesota television, was \\"He has a problem with Christians, then.\\" Boschwitz was the only incumbent U.S. senator not to be re-elected that year. Wellstone defeated Boschwitz again in 1996. During that campaign, Boschwitz ran ads accusing Wellstone of being \\"embarrassingly liberal\\" and calling him \\"Senator Welfare\\". Boschwitz accused Wellstone of supporting flag burning, a move some believe backfired. Before that accusation, the race was closely contested, but Wellstone went on to beat Boschwitz by a nine-point margin despite again being significantly outspent. Reform Party candidate Dean Barkley received 7% of the vote. Wellstone's upset victory in 1990 and reelection in 1996 were also credited to a grassroots campaign which inspired college students, poor people, and minorities to get involved in politics, many for the first time. In 1990, the number of young people involved in the campaign was so notable that shortly after the election, Walter Mondale told Wellstone that \\"the kids won it for you\\". Wellstone also spent much of his Senate career working with the Hmong community in Minnesota, which had not previously been much involved in American politics, and with the veterans community‚Äîserving on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, successfully campaigning for atomic veterans to receive compensation from the federal government, and for increased spending on health care for veterans.OMB Approves Benefits for Vets Suffering from Radiogenic Cancers In 2002, Wellstone campaigned for reelection to a third term despite an earlier campaign pledge to serve only two. His Republican opponent was Norm Coleman, a two-term mayor of St. Paul and former Democrat, who had supported Wellstone in his 1996 campaign. Earlier that year Wellstone announced he had a mild form of multiple sclerosis, causing the limp he had believed was an old wrestling injury. Wellstone was in a line of center-left senators from the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). The first three, Hubert Humphrey, Eugene McCarthy, and Walter Mondale, were all prominent in the national Democratic Party. Shortly after joining the Senate, South Carolina Senator Fritz Hollings approached Wellstone and told him, \\"You remind me of Hubert Humphrey. You talk too much.\\" Policy views Wellstone was known for his work for peace, the environment, labor, and health care; he also joined his wife Sheila to support the rights of victims of domestic violence. He made the issue of mental illness a central focus in his career. He was a supporter of immigration to the U.S. He opposed the first Gulf War in 1991 and, in the months before his death, spoke out against the government's threats to go to war with Iraq again. He was strongly supported by groups such as Americans for Democratic Action, the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club, the American Civil Liberties Union, and People for the American Way. In 1996, he voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act. He later asked his supporters to educate him on the issue and by 2001, when he wrote his autobiography, Conscience of a Liberal, Wellstone admitted that he had made a mistake. Wellstone was one of only eight members of the Senate to vote against the repeal of the Glass- Steagall Act in 1999.Congressional roll-call: S.900 as reported by conferees: Financial Services Act of 1999, Record Vote No: 354, November 4, 1999, Clerk of the Senate.

The party's 2000 Vice-Presidential nominee, Winona LaDuke, described Wellstone as \\"a champion of the vast majority of our issues\\". The Green Party's decision to oppose Wellstone was criticized by some liberals. Wellstone was the author of the \\"Wellstone Amendment\\" added to the McCain- Feingold Bill for campaign finance reform, in what came to be known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. The law, including the Wellstone Amendment, was called unconstitutional by groups and individuals of various political perspectives, including the California Democratic Party, the National Rifle Association, and Republican Senator Mitch McConnell (Kentucky), the Senate Majority Whip. On December 10, 2003, the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 ruling upholding the key provisions of McCain-Feingold, including the Wellstone Amendment. Wellstone called McCain-Feingold's protection of \\"advocacy\\" groups a \\"loophole\\" allowing \\"special interests\\" to run last-minute election ads. Wellstone pushed an amendment to extend McCain-Feingold's ban on last-minute ads to nonprofits like \\"the NRA, the Sierra Club, the Christian Coalition, and others.\\" Under the Wellstone Amendment, these organizations could advertise using only money raised under strict \\"hard money\\" limits ‚Äî no more than $5,000 per individual.Kaus, Mickey. \\"Wellstone's Folly\\" Slate. April 4, 2002. In January 2010, in the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the McCain-Feingold Act and removed restrictions on the NRA and others' ability to campaign at election time. Presidential aspirations Shortly after his reelection to the Senate in 1996, Wellstone began contemplating a run for his party's nomination for President of the United States in 2000. In May 1997 he embarked on a cross- country speaking and listening tour dubbed \\"The Children's Tour.\\" It took him through rural areas of Mississippi and Appalachia and the inner cities of Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Baltimore. He intended to retrace the steps Robert F. Kennedy took during a similar tour in 1966, and to highlight the fact that conditions had improved slightly for African-Americans since the civil rights movement, but not much for poor whites despite their dependency on food stamps, government jobs (military) and the massive Federal Government investment in their regions, especially Appalachia. Wellstone's distinctive campaign bus. In 1998, Wellstone formed an exploratory committee and a leadership PAC, the Progressive Politics Network, that paid for his travels to Iowa and New Hampshire, two early primary states in the nomination process. He spoke before organized labor and local Democrats, using the slogan, \\"I represent the democratic wing of the Democratic Party.\\" Vermont governor Howard Dean later incorporated that phrase into his stump speech in the 2004 US presidential election. On January 9, 1999, Wellstone called a press conference at the Minnesota State Capitol. Despite expectations that he would announce his candidacy, he stated he could not muster the stamina necessary for a national campaign, citing chronic back problems he ascribed to an old wrestling injury. His pain was later diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. He thereafter endorsed the candidacy of former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, the only Democratic candidate to challenge Vice President Al Gore. Gulf War Wellstone voted against authorizing the use of force before the Persian Gulf War on January 12, 1991 (the vote was 52‚Äì47 in favor). He also voted against the use of force before the Iraq War on October 11, 2002 (the vote was 77‚Äì23 in favor). Wellstone was one of 11 senators to vote against both the 1991 and 2002 resolutions. The others were also all Democratic senators: Daniel Akaka of Hawaii; Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico; Robert Byrd of West Virginia; Kent Conrad of North Dakota; Daniel Inouye of Hawaii; Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts; Patrick Leahy of Vermont; Carl Levin of Michigan; Barbara Mikulski of Maryland; and Paul Sarbanes of Maryland. Other key military action votes Wellstone supported requests for military action by President Bill Clinton, including Operation Restore Hope in Somalia (1992), Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti (1994), Operation Deliberate Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1995), Operation Desert Fox in Iraq (1998), and Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia (1999). On July 1, 1994, during the 100-day Rwandan genocide from April 6 to mid-July 1994, Wellstone authored an amendment to the 1995 defense appropriations bill. Death On October 25, 2002, Wellstone, along with seven others, died in an airplane crash in northern Minnesota, at 10:22 a.m. He was 58 years old. The other victims were his wife, Sheila; one of his three children, Marcia; the two pilots, and campaign staffers Mary McEvoy, Tom Lapic and Will McLaughlin. The airplane was en route to Eveleth, where Wellstone was to attend the funeral of Martin Rukavina, a steelworker whose son Tom Rukavina served in the Minnesota House of Representatives. Wellstone decided to go to the funeral instead of a rally and fundraiser in Minneapolis attended by Mondale and fellow Senator Ted Kennedy. He was to debate Norm Coleman in Duluth, Minnesota, that same night. Paul and Sheila Wellstone memorial, Lakewood Cemetery, Minneapolis, Minnesota The Beechcraft King Air A100 airplane crashed into dense forest about two miles from the Eveleth airport, while operating under instrument flight rules. It had no flight data recorders. Autopsy toxicology results on both pilots were negative for drug or alcohol use. Icing, though widely reported on in following days, was considered and eventually rejected as a significant factor in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) judged that while cloud cover might have prevented the flight crew from seeing the airport, icing did not affect the airplane's performance during the descent. The FBI, which initially sent agents to help recover debris, investigated possible foul play in the crash. After a few days, the Bureau determined that the crash was accidental, but only after following several criminal leads involving death threats. Wellstone had been receiving death threats since he took office; the FBI tapped his phone to locate the callers. Documents about the FBI's involvement in investigating Wellstone's death were not publicly released until October 2010. Government documents also indicated that the FBI had been following Wellstone before he became a senator, and included records dating as far back as his arrest at a 1970 antiwar protest. The NTSB later determined that the likely cause of the accident was \\"the flight crew's failure to maintain adequate airspeed, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which they did not recover.\\" The final two radar readings detected the airplane traveling at or just below its predicted stall speed given conditions at the time of the accident. Aviation experts speculated the pilots might have lost situational awareness because they were lost and looking for the airport. They had been off course for several minutes and \\"clicked on\\" the runway lights, something not usually done in good visibility. There was a problem with the airport's VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigational beacon. According to Minnesota Public Radio: The Paul Wellstone Memorial and Historic Site near Eveleth, Minnesota. Other pilots at the charter company told NTSB that pilot Richard Conry and first officer (co-pilot) Michael Guess had both displayed below-average flying skills. Conry had a well-known tendency to allow copilots to take over all aircraft functions as if they were the sole pilot during flights. After the crash, 3 copilots told of occasions on which they had to take control of the aircraft away from Conry. After one of those incidents, only 3 days before the crash, the copilot (not Guess) had urged Conry to retire. In a post-accident interview, Conry's longtime friend and fellow aviator Timothy Cooney said that he had last spoken to Conry in June 2001 and had expressed concerns about difficulties he had flying King Airs as late as April of that year, 18 months before the accident.Interview Summaries, pp. 18, 21. Significant discrepancies were also found in the captain's flight logs in the course of the post-accident investigation, indicating he had probably greatly exaggerated his flying experience, most of which had been accrued before a 9‚Äì10 year hiatus from flying due to a fraud conviction and poor eyesight. He underwent Lasik surgery, but it had improved his vision to only 20/50 or 20/30Human Performance Specialist Report, p.10 and he was required by FAA regulations to wear corrective lenses,Human Performance Specialist Report, p. 8 but the pilot's wife and Cooney said Conry did not wear lenses after the surgery.Interview Summaries, pp. 19, 24 The coroner who examined his body was unable to determine whether Conry was wearing contact lenses at the time of the crash.Human Performance Specialist Report, p.26 Coworkers described Guess as having had to be consistently reminded to keep his hand on the throttle and maintain airspeed during approaches. He had two previous piloting jobs, one with Skydive Hutchinson as a pilot (1988‚Äì1989), and another with Northwest Airlines as a trainee instructor (1999), and was dismissed from both for lack of ability. Conry's widow told the NTSB that her husband told her \\"the other pilots thought Guess was not a good pilot.\\"Interview Summaries page 26 Aftermath Don Hazen, executive editor of Alternet, wrote of the death, \\"Progressives across the land are in shock as the person many think of as the conscience of the Senate is gone.\\" Wellstone died just 11 days before his potential re-election in a crucial race to maintain Democratic control of the Senate. Campaigning was halted by all sides. Minnesota law required that his name be stricken from the ballot, to be replaced by a candidate chosen by the party. The DFL selected former Vice President Walter Mondale to compete with Norm Coleman in the general election. The memorial service for Wellstone and the other victims of the crash was held in Williams Arena at the University of Minnesota and was broadcast live on national TV. The lengthy service was dotted with political speeches, open advocacy on political issues, and a giant beach ball batted around the crowd in the style of a beach party. Many high-profile politicians attended the memorial, including former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore, and more than half of the U.S. Senate. The White House offered to send Vice President Dick Cheney to the service, but the Wellstone family declined. Some criticized the service for having an inappropriate toneNoonan, Peggy. \\"'No Class': What Paul Wellstone might have thought of the memorial rally.\\" The Wall Street Journal November 1, 2002. and resembling a \\"pep rally\\" or \\"partisan foot-stomp\\". Wellstone campaign manager Jeff Blodgett noted after the event that it had not been scripted and apologized to people who were offended or surprised. In his book Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them, Al Franken wrote that \\"reasonable people of good will were genuinely offended\\" but argued that conservative media figures had exploited outrage at the event for political gain. At the time of writing Franken was a comedian and liberal commentator. In 2008, Franken would be elected to the Senate seat once held by Wellstone. Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, who had stated his preference to appoint a Democrat to serve out the remainder of Wellstone's term through January 2003, was \\"disgusted\\" by the event, walking out and later threatening to appoint \\"an ordinary citizen\\" instead. On November 4, the day before the election, Ventura appointed state planning commissioner Dean Barkley, founder and chair of Ventura's Independence Party of Minnesota, to complete the remaining two months of Wellstone's term; he had run against Wellstone in 1996.Sternberg, Bob von (October 27, 2008)Dean Barkley: As a 'viable alternative,' he's a force that matters StarTribune. \\"In the waning days of the administration, Ventura appointed Barkley to serve out the final weeks of Wellstone's Senate term after Wellstone died in a plane crash.\\" Coleman received 49.5 percent of the vote to defeat Mondale and win Wellstone's seat. In 2008, he was narrowly defeated (by 312 votes) in his bid for reelection by Franken, in a three-way race that included Barkley. Legacy Paul Wellstone marker Sheila Wellstone marker The AFL-CIO has created the AFL-CIO Senator Paul Wellstone Award for supporters of the rights of labor unions. Presidential candidate Howard Dean and California state senator John Burton both received the first award in January 2003. In 2004, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill dedicated the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Memorial Garden as a tribute to the couple, both graduates of the university. Also in 2004, Mason Jennings released \\"The Ballad of Paul and Sheila,\\" a song memorializing the Wellstones, on his album Use Your Voice. Near the site of his plane crash, a memorial to the Wellstones was dedicated on September 25, 2005. His distinctive green bus was present, as well as hundreds of supporters and loved ones. The Senator and his wife were buried at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis, the same cemetery in which Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey is interred. A memorial sculpture near Bde Maka Ska marks their gravesites. Visitors sometimes follow the Jewish custom of placing small stones on the boulder marking the family plot or on the individual markers. His legacy continues as Wellstone Action, a nonprofit, nonpartisan membership organization that trains citizens and potential candidates with a progressive agenda. In 2007, former First Lady Rosalynn Carter joined with David Wellstone to push Congress to pass legislation regarding mental health insurance. Wellstone and Carter worked to pass the \\"Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008\\" which requires equal coverage of mental and physical illnesses when policies include both types of coverage; both testified before a House subcommittee regarding the bill in July 2007. David said of his father, \\"Although he was passionate on many issues, there was not another issue that surpassed this in terms of his passion.\\" Because Paul Wellstone's brother had suffered from mental illness, Wellstone had fought for changes in mental health and insurance laws when he reached the Senate. On March 5, 2008, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007, by a vote of 268-148. It was sponsored by Representatives Patrick Kennedy (D-Rhode Island) and Representative Jim Ramstad (R-Minnesota), both of whom are recovering alcoholics. The narrower Senate bill S. 558, passed earlier, was introduced by Kennedy's father, Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Massachusetts), Pete Domenici (R-New Mexico), and Mike Enzi (R-Wyoming).

Civil War View westward of Luray and New Market Gap from Skyline Drive on the Blue Ridge. Luray is often cited as the location (as is Yager's Mill, on the north side of town, near Furnace Hill) of an engagement between Union and Confederate cavalry on September 24, 1864, though it actually took place approximately three miles north of the town, and even to the north of Yager's Mill. Following his victory at the Battle of Fisher's Hill Union general Philip Sheridan sent approximately 6,000 troopers under Brigadier General Alfred Torbert into the Luray Valley. Trobert's men engaged approximately 1,200 Confederate cavalry under Brigadier General Williams Wickham. Despite victory in this affair, and moving toward New Market Gap following the engagement, Torbert halted his command that night on the Page County side of the Massanutten, thereby missing an opportunity to cut off Confederate General Jubal Early's retreat from Fisher's Hill. Private Philip Baybutt of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry received the Medal of Honor for capturing a Confederate flag during the engagement.

The per capita income for the town was $16,030. About 9.0% of families and 12.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.0% of those under age 18 and 17.7% of those age 65 or over. History The town was founded in 1837 by two brothers, Daniel and Henry Forrer, who settled in the area to take advantage of the natural resources found in and around Shenandoah. The natural resources included extensive iron ore deposits, hardwood, high-grade limestone, and waterpower. The proximity to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River was also a great benefit and was later used by the Forrers to transport iron ore and other commodities produced by the Shenandoah Iron Works to broader markets down stream. On February 20, 1838, the Forrers established the first post office in Shenandoah under the name Shenandoah Iron Works with Henry Forrer being the postmaster. Development of the town ensued thereafter with houses, businesses, and industries developed astride of the Shenandoah River. The Shenandoah Iron Works, which was owned and operated by Daniel and Henry Forrer, was also located along the river banks. Ten houses were built facing the river in the Furnace Hollow section of town by a man named Mr. Pee Dee, hence, the name of this section of town today. Other historical structures were also built including Stephens Cottage, the South Fork House, Mt. Lebanon United Church at Comertown, and the Old Verbena Mill in Verbena, just south of town off Route 340. The Town of Shenandoah played an instrumental role in the Civil War. Three iron ore furnaces around Shenandoah smelted raw iron into pig iron. Unlike during the pre-war years when pig iron was shipped on flat boats on the Shenandoah River to Harpers Ferry, during the war, the pig iron was shipped by wagon to Gordonsville, and subsequently by rail to Richmond for use at the Tredegar Iron Works. In addition to the pig iron, cannonballs were manufactured at some of the local furnaces and shipped out, along with gunpowder from a local gunpowder plant, for use by the Confederacy. After the Civil War, two men, William Milnes, Jr. and Thomas Johns came to Shenandoah in 1866 and purchased including the Forrer's Shenandoah Iron Works. These men continued the iron works; however, they introduced modern tools and machinery that were patented in order to improve production. One of the major distinctions of the Town of Shenandoah is its flood prone nature due to its close proximity to the Shenandoah River. Time and time again, the town has been ravaged with floods. With all of the major development of the time occurring in or near the flood plain area, it was only a matter of time before a major flood wiped out the entire town. On September 28, and 29, 1870, the inevitable happened when flood waters decimated the entire developed portion of Shenandoah. Between 30 and 60 buildings were completely destroyed or washed away as the water of the South Fork of the Shenandoah River billowed its way through town. Despite the wrath of the flood, William Milnes was able to take charge of the town and rebuild with relative ease. At the time of the flood, the entire country was experiencing prosperity due to an industrial boom. Milnes took this opportunity to spearhead the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, which would begin in Roanoke, Virginia and wind through the Shenandoah Valley to Hagerstown, Maryland. Milnes' persistence led to the Shenandoah Valley Railroad being built along with the installation of a telegraph line. The town is now rich in railroad history. Through the work of William Milnes, Shenandoah became the midpoint between Roanoke, Virginia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and enabled town industries to ship out their goods through means other than the river. Milnes took advantage of the railroad's presence and erected the Big Gem Cast Iron Furnace. The Big Gem was completed in 1882 and produced 110 tons of iron ore per day. It became a popular tourist destination as well because of the sparks that could be viewed each night as red hot cinder was poured down the cinder bank. The Big Gem literally lit up the entire town. On June 27, 1882, the post office name was changed from Shenandoah Iron Works to Milnes in honor of William Milnes. The town also became incorporated on February 12, 1884 by an Act of the General Assembly. The town name was also changed to Milnes. The railroad tracks that were built paralleled the river flood plain and Front Street, which is now modern day First Street. The area in and around Front Street became the town's commercial hub as business were constructed facing the rail yard. Front Street became a thriving \\"Main St. Community,\\" as hundreds of people would come to the downtown to shop and watch the trains pass by. In 1957, however, Norfolk and Western Railroad closed its major maintenance and operations facilities along the Front Street corridor. Since this time, only a handful of businesses remain and buildings have deteriorated. The only thing that remains is the aura of the \\"good old days.\\" In 1890, the town name was changed from Milnes to Shenandoah City by an Act of the General Assembly. Since this time, the town has parted with the City portion of the name. The year of 1890 also was the year of another great \\"Boom\\" as Shenandoah experienced a period of rapid growth. The Shenandoah Land and Improvement Company bought land around town and surveyed the corporate limits. Streets were staked and a map of the town was produced. Many buildings were erected during this period of growth by the Shenandoah Land and Improvement Company. Most of the structures that were built by the Land and Improvement Company are no longer visible due to fires which are also a distinct feature of the town's history. 20th century Between 1890 and 1907 depression swept through the entire country. This depression affected Shenandoah as businesses closed and went bankrupt. Others, such as the luxurious town hotel, \\"The Shenandoah,\\" were destroyed by a fire in 1891. Floods in 1896 washed away the river bridge, and yet another fire destroyed the town bank. In 1907, the Big Gem Furnace discontinued operations and parts of the land were sold off. The Big Gem was dismantled in 1917 and the land passed ownership to the Lukens Steel Company who has just recently donated the land to the town. The land, , may be the site of a proposed historical and outdoor recreational park named after the Big Gem Furnace Since the railroad downgraded its facilities along First St. in 1957, the downtown has remained dormant. Most of the town's growth has occurred along the Route 340 corridor, which runs the entire length of Page County. Currently, the town has plans to revitalize Shenandoah, which like most other small, rural towns in America, suffered from the popularity of strip malls and the development of large shopping centers. The town would like to revive \\"Old Front Street,\\" develop the Big Gem Furnace tract, and play on its rich railroad history and proximity to such popular tourist destinations as Luray Caverns, Massanutten Resort, and the Shenandoah National Park. 21st century Shenandoah's downtown was hit by a fire on May 23, 2006. Two stores and one residential building were destroyed. The inferno raged for over 18 hours despite seven fire companies' efforts to battle the blaze. A second large fire struck the downtown area on March 27, 2007. Again, seven fire companies responded to the fire that burned for nearly ten hours. Three structures were destroyed and four were damaged. Shenandoah is the only town in Page County with wireless broadband. The Commonwealth of Virginia gave the town numerous grants for the beautification of its once-destroyed Main Street (First Street) area. The Shenandoah Historic District, Shenandoah Land and Improvement Company Office, Strickley-Louderback House, and Welfley-Shuler House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As of 2017 Norfolk Southern owns a large railyard across from First Street. On a typical day 10 to 15 trains can be seen in the yard. On the north end of the yard there is remains of the old Norfolk and Western shops. These shops were abandoned in the late due to the switch to diesel locomotives.

Spabrooke Station was named Patrick Springs post office in 1859. A second post office was operated on Route 680 just north of old Route 58 and was called Shuff post office.

Fort Lee also hosts two Army museums, the U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum and the U.S. Army Women's Museum. The equipment and other materiel associated with the Army's Ordnance Museum was moved to Fort Lee in 2009-2010 for use by the United States Army Ordnance Training and Heritage Center. The fort is named for US Army Colonel and Confederate States General in Chief, Robert E. Lee, one of ten U.S. Army bases named for former Confederate Generals. Fort Lee is also a census-designated place (CDP), with population of 3,393 at the 2010 census. History=Civil War At the start of the Civil War, a training camp was established west of Richmond (currently the area behind the Science Museum of Virginia) and was known as \\"Camp Lee\\" after the Confederate general. This military camp is unrelated to the latter Camp Lee. World War I Just 18 days after a state of war with Germany was declared, the first Camp Lee was selected as a state mobilization camp and later became a division training camp. In June 1917, building began and within sixty days some 14,000 men were on the installation. When construction work ended, there were accommodations for 60,335 men. On 15 July 1917, the War Department announced that the camp would be named after Colonel Robert E. Lee, a US Army Colonel who later served in the Confederacy during the Civil War. In 2015 Brigadier General Malcolm Frost said, \\"Every Army installation is named for a soldier who holds a place in our military history.\\" He further explained that the historic names chosen \\"represent individuals, not causes or ideologies,\\" and that it was done \\"in the spirit of reconciliation, not division.\\" After World War I, Camp Lee was taken over by the Commonwealth of Virginia and designated a game preserve. Later, portions of the land were incorporated into the Petersburg National Battlefield and the Federal Correctional Institution, Petersburg. In 1920 Camp Lee was still active, as the US 1920 Census showed many soldiers still stationed there. World War II In October 1940, the War Department ordered the construction of another Camp Lee on the site of the earlier installation. Built as rapidly as the first, construction was still ongoing when the Quartermaster Replacement Training Center (QMRTC) started operation in February 1941. Their number grew to 25,000 in 1942, and peaked at 35,000 in 1944. Camp Lee was also the home of a Medical Replacement Training Center (MRTC), but as the Quartermaster training increased, it was decided to relocate the MRTC at Camp Pickett. Later, the QMRTC was re-designated as an Army Services Forces Training Center, but it retained its basic mission of training Quartermaster personnel. While the QMRTC was getting underway, the Quartermaster School was transferred to Camp Lee. A full program of courses was conducted, including Officer Candidate School. By the end of 1941, Camp Lee was the center of both basic and advanced training of Quartermaster personnel and held this position throughout the war. Camp Lee to Fort Lee When World War II ended, the fate of Camp Lee was in question. In 1946, the War Department announced that Camp Lee would be retained as a center for Quartermaster training. Official recognition of its permanent status was obtained in 1950 and the post was redesignated as Fort Lee. Immediately troops began Quartermaster training for the Korean War and continued for the next three years. Fort Lee also had a Women's Army Corps (WAC) training center. After the Korean War, progress was made on an ambitious permanent building program. Under the twenty-year program, Fort Lee changed from an installation of temporary wooden structures to a modern Army post with permanent brick and cinder block buildings. The Quartermaster Training Center, created to supervise the training of Quartermaster personnel and troop units, brought an intensification of training activity within the Quartermaster Corps. As a result, the courses formerly taught at other locations were incorporated in the curriculum of the Quartermaster School. Profound changes were evident at Fort Lee during 1962. The post became a Class 1 military installation under Second United States Army. The Quartermaster School became a part of the Continental Army Command service school system and was also selected to serve as the home of the Quartermaster Corps and Corps Historian. The Second United States Army was inactivated at Fort Lee in 1966 until its reactivation at Fort Gillem, Georgia in 1983. In July 1973, Fort Lee came under the control of Training and Doctrine Command. Fort Lee is the country's first army post to host a 'full-size' statue commemorating the service of women in the Army. The statue was unveiled in 2013. In 2005 a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) law was passed by Congress. One of BRAC's requirements was the relocation of the U.S. Army Ordnance Center and School headquarters, the Ordnance Mechanical Maintenance School, the United States Army Ordnance Munitions and Electronic Maintenance School, and the Ordnance Museum to Fort Lee by the end 2011. The transfer of artifacts from Aberdeen to Fort Lee began in August 2009, with the former museum now designated the U.S. Army Ordnance Training and Heritage Center at Fort Lee.

It is an annex of Woodbridge, Virginia. As of 2017, the total population was 73,384. The community is roughly bounded by Hoadly Road to the northwest, Prince William Parkway to the north, Smoketown Road to the northeast, Gideon Drive to the east, and Cardinal Drive to the south.  History  Dale City was the idea of a real estate developer, Cecil Don Hylton, who chose the term because it aptly describes the \\"hills and dales\\" of the rolling Virginia Piedmont, where he developed the community. Hylton began his career as a \\"huckster\\", a young man who sold farm goods and produce at the farmers' market in Washington, DC. He later began a sod business after several requests from his regular clients. He ran several dozen trucks and pioneered new technologies in the industry. After the post-war housing boom, he moved into homebuilding. Throughout his career, he constructed apartments, commercial shopping centers, and over 22,000 homes. Along the way, he began his own sewer company, Dale Service Company, as well as the first cable television companies in Prince William County. His company, Hylton Enterprises, began Dale City approximately 1 mile east of Interstate 95 and continued to build west towards Hoadly Road (State Route 642). Several places in Dale City are named after Hylton, such as C.D. Hylton High School and the Hylton Memorial Chapel. More recently, the Hylton Foundation underwrote a major new addition to Potomac Hospital in nearby Woodbridge. Hylton's companies have branched into new markets, especially real estate of existing houses. Hylton Realty now sells property in and near Dale City. Hylton Enterprises manages commercial properties still controlled by the Hylton family, including several shopping centers, as well as several oddly-shaped parcels of unimproved land. These parcels were land that could not be built on or were proffered to the county; Andrew Leitch Park is one such parcel that has been given to the local Park Authority. Because Dale City was built before most of eastern Prince William County was developed, it has its own water and sewer systems, separate from the ones in Occoquan, Woodbridge, Dumfries, Triangle, and Lake Ridge. Water service is provided by Virginia-American Water Company, and since 2013, Virginia-American also provides sewer service to Dale City through their purchase of the Dale Service Corporation.

The population was 4,961 at the 2010 United States Census. Geography Dumfries is located at (38.567853, ‚àí77.324591). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.6 square miles (4.1 km2), all of it land. The town is situated 70 miles north of the state capital, Richmond. It is 30 miles south of central Washington, D.C. History Dumfries Cemetery The history of Dumfries began as early as 1690 when Richard Gibson erected a gristmill on Quantico Creek. A customhouse and warehouse followed in 1731, and many others cropped up along the estuary by 1732. The Town of Dumfries was formally established on of land at the head of the harbor of Quantico Creek, provided by John Graham. He named the town after his birthplace, Dumfries, Scotland. After much political maneuvering, the General Assembly established Dumfries as the first of seven townships in the county. Dumfries received its charter on May 11, 1749, making it the oldest continuously chartered town in Virginia. The Ceremonial Seal of the Town of Dumfries embodies elements of its heritage, from the period of 1651, when the first patents were issued to colonists, who following the Potomac recognized the value of a snug harbor in Quantico Creek. Thus the foundations for the establishment of a town, which in 1749 received its charter from the Colonial government in Williamsburg, Virginia. The elements of the seal are contained within the pattern formed by the outer frame of a hawser rope or cable, and the inner frame of an anchor chain, of a type employed in ships of the Colonial era. Within these frames are found items which are consistent with a town of maritime background. They are overlaid on a chart of the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River, with Dumfries indicated at the head of Quantico Creek. The navigational aids of the sextant and compass rose complete the maritime motif. The two water fowl relate to the wetlands of Quantico Creek. The dock with fishnet, pilings, ships block and line further the theme of a mercantile port of call. The thistle indicates the Scottish founders of the town, with the name of Dumfries, taken by John Graham, the founder, in honor of his home in Scotland. The supporters of the shield are, on the left, a Piscataway brave, of the Powhatan Confederacy, the predominant tribe along the Potomac, in this area. On the right, a Colonial militiaman of 1775, when Colonel Henry Lee was company Commander. The shield in its upper quadrant, displays a sailing vessel of the period, and below the tobacco leaf, the first commodity, overlaid with shafts of wheat, the later commodity that supported the town. When Dumfries became the second leading port in Colonial America receiving tobacco from the upland, it rivaled New York, Philadelphia and Boston. Dumfries peaked in size and importance in 1763. For about 15 years Dumfries was a thriving port when several factors brought about its demise: the Revolutionary War, erosion and siltation, and the shift in the main shipping commodity (from tobacco to wheat and sugar). The Dumfries Cemetery contains burials of some of the Dumfries pioneers. Alexander Henderson built a house known as the Henderson House which still stands on a hill in Dumfries, as well as owning various land in Prince William Forest Park. Alexander was a merchant when the ports were booming in Dumfries. Alexander is famous for his son, United States Marine Corps commandant Archibald Henderson. The Leesylvania Archeological Site (44PW7), Old Hotel, and Weems-Botts Museum are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Dumfries was combined with the community of Triangle, Virginia to form Dumfries-Triangle in the 1950 United States Census.

The population was 11,481 in the 2010 census.  History  Gainesville was once a changing point for stagecoach horses on the Fauquier & Alexandria Turnpike. In earlier times, the village that became known as ‚ÄúGainesville‚Äù actually had two other names, if only briefly. In colonial days, the region was known as the ‚ÄúMiddle Grounds,‚Äù in reference to its location between Broad Run and Bull Run. In the early 1800s, Samuel Love of Buckland Hall started work on the Warrenton-Alexandria Turnpike. In the hamlet where the turnpike passed through the Middle Grounds, a new stable was erected for stagecoach drivers to switch horses. Other businesses followed, and the settlement became known as New Stable. In 1846, a post office by that name was opened there in Richard Graham‚Äôs hotel and store. Mr. Graham also operated a large stable that catered to the drovers and stage drivers and other less pretentious travelers. The person responsible for bringing the railroad through the village was Thomas Brawner Gaines (1814-1856), who had begun buying up property in the area as early as 1835, and later became a major landowner. In 1850, Thomas Brawner Gaines (1814-1856) sold to the Manassas Gap Railroad a right-of-way through his land along the Warrenton Turnpike (US Route 29). After the railroad was completed to Strasburg, VA in 1854, Gaines conveyed additional land for a train depot with the condition that the rail stop take his name. By 1856, a small community with a post office flourished around the Gainesville depot.Prince William County Historical Commission, 2017 (Historical Marker) Gainesville became a shipping point for grain, timber, and cattle and remained a major cattle shipping point into the early 1960s.

The population was 1,782 at the 2010 census, a total that was estimated to have decreased to 1,715 in 2018. History Greek Revival and Victorian style to serve as both a schoolhouse and town hall, in 2001 it was adapted as the Haymarket Museum. This was a hunting ground of the western Iroquois nations, who came from the New York and Pennsylvania area around the Great Lakes. They used hunting paths through here until 1722, when they made a treaty with the colonies of Virginia and New York to move into the Blue Ridge Mountain region. Due to the hunting paths, this location, and later the town, were given the nickname The Crossroads. The town of Haymarket was developed here after the American Revolutionary War, formally founded in 1799 on the land of William Skinker. The Virginia General Assembly gave Skinker the rights to lay out the town, which he drew to consist of 13 streets and 140 lots. Shortly after, a clerk's office and jail were constructed in 1801, as the town had been selected as the site of what is now a district court. The town owed its early development to business and trade associated with the regular court sessions. In 1807, the Virginia General Assembly abolished the district court in favor of the circuit court system, which established a court at each county seat. Until 1830 the court house remained the focal point of the town, while serving multiple purposes. In 1830, the court house was converted into and deeded as an Episcopal church; in 1833 it was consecrated as St Paul's. During the Civil War, on November 4, 1862, Union troops invaded Haymarket and set the entire town on fire. Only four buildings survived: three small houses and St. Paul‚Äôs Church. For the remainder of the war, Haymarket remained mostly unpopulated. A skirmish took place on October 19, 1863, involving the Second Brigade, Second Division, Fifth Army Corp, and in June 1863. They both involved Union encounters with the Confederate cavalry. Following General Robert E. Lee's surrender, Haymarket began to recover. Slowly it regained its former prosperity and size. Post-Reconstruction era to present Haymarket was incorporated in 1882, the second town in Prince William County to do so. The first mayor elected was Garrett Hulfish and the first councilmen elected were T.A. Smith, Charles Jordan, and William W. Meade. In May 1882 during the council's second meeting, the rudimentary ordinances were drafted and adopted.Historical Information, Town of Haymarket, retrieved October 30, 2013. On March 19, 1892, two white men, Lee Heflin and Joseph Dye, were lynched in Haymarket. They had been convicted of the murder of a girl and sentenced to death, but the mob thought the legal system moved too slowly. The men were hanged from trees at the edge of woods; then the mob shot into their bodies. The Washington Post said, \\"mob law...is a dangerous thing to encourage. There is too much of it already throughout the country, and it spreads like a contagion so long as public sentiment tacitly approves it.\\"\\"Swifter than the Law,\\" Washington Post, March 19, 1892, p.1 It was unusual that white men were lynched; in Virginia and the rest of the South, usually black men were victims of lynching.W.

Linton's Ford was inherited by Sister Mary Baptista, John Linton's daughter, and upon her death the land was inherited by the Benedictine order for the purpose of educating poor boys and girls. The Benedictine monastery remains part of the school through the present day.History of Linton Hall, Linton Hall Military School Alumni Memories, http://lintonhallmilitaryschool.blogspot.com/search?q=history Over the last century the Benedictine nuns sold most of the school property, primarily to real estate developers, which created the Braemar subdivision, a series of upscale housing developments with a large homeowners association. The Linton family cemetery is located inside the Braemar subdivision. The site was surveyed by the Prince William County Archaeologist, Prince William County Historical Society and County Arborist for potential restoration in 2006. While it was the intent of the nuns at Linton Hall to maintain ownership of the cemetery, it was determined that, due to loss of land records for that space during the Civil War (attributed to the burning of the Brentsville Courthouse), the cemetery was \\"unowned\\" and remains in this status today, as do many others in Virginia.

Woodbridge is home to Potomac Mills Mall (managed by Simon Property Group), one of the largest shopping centers in northern Virginia. Woodbridge is a suburban city because many of its residents are employed in nearby Washington, D.C. Due in part to the I-95 and I-66 HOV waiver given to hybrid vehicles, many D.C. government workers have relocated to the area to take advantage of the lower-priced housing. However, in July 2006, the hybrid/HOV privilege was revoked. Vehicles registered prior to July 2006 were exempted from occupancy requirements in all (HOV) facilities in Virginia until July 1, 2009. Other cultural resources include Rippon Lodge, the oldest house in Prince William County, which was opened as a park and museum in October 2007. Recreation Woodbridge is the home of the Northern Virginia Royals soccer club and the Potomac Nationals minor league baseball club. The stadium is located within the city limits. Transportation Prince William Parkway serves as the cross-county connector. It links the community to I-95 and runs from Woodbridge westward to near Gainesville. Virginia Route 123 connects the I-95 corridor and U.S. 1 (Jefferson Davis Highway) to points west and north and ultimately terminates in McLean, Virginia. Marumsco has the Prince William Parkway (Virginia Route 294) as an east-west highway, and Neabsco is served by Rippon Boulevard and Cardinal Drive. The area is also served by the Virginia Railway Express Fredericksburg Line. U.S. 1 (Jefferson Davis Highway) is currently under major construction to widen the road to six lanes. It will also see a new interchange to redirect traffic from Virginia Route 123 to Belmont Bay Drive. There will also be a 10' shared use path, a 6' side walk, and a 28' median for future WMATA Metro expansion or Bus Rapid Transit. The Project is estimated to cost $259 Million, with completion by the end of 2018. The Woodbridge Amtrak station, at 1040 Express Way, is owned by Virginia Railway Express. Its 29,418 passengers (2014)http://www.amtrak.com/pdf/factsheets/VIRGINIA14.pdf are served by numerous VRE trains and Amtrak Virginia Regionals, as well as OmniRide Commuter buses. The station has free (taxpayer-subsidized) parking spaces for 738 vehicles, as well as bike racks. It is ADA compliant.

The town was incorporated in 1894 and was rechartered by the Virginia General Assembly in 1985.

At this time there were virtually no Native Americans in the area and the way was open to English settlement of the Piedmont region of Virginia.Maureen I. Harris, Washington, Virginia, a History, 1735-2018 (KDP Publishing, Amazon.com, 2019), pp. 9-11 In 1745, the Kennerlys divided their land into three parts. Thomas received the central part, adjacent to and south of the Rush River and containing the land that would become the town of Washington.Orange County Deed Book 10, p. 278 Thomas sold his land to Henry Gambill in 1753 and moved to South Carolina.Culpeper County Deed Book B, pp. 70-74 Gambill divided the land: in 1754 he sold the western part, which contained what became the western portion of the town of Washington, to John Minor; in 1761 he gave the eastern part, which contained what became the northeastern portion of the town, to his son William Gambill.Culpeper County Deed Book B, pp. 132-135, and Deed Book C, pp. 609-610 The border between these two parts would become part of the original road to Chesters Gap and, later, Gay Street when the town of Washington was established.

A new water system was constructed for the town in the mid-1930s through Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs Works Progress Administration, and a volunteer fire department was created at that time. In the later 1930s, caravans of tourists began visiting the town on their way to Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park. 260x260px A major event heralded the beginning of the second half of the 20th century with the election of seven women to serve as the Town Council of Washington, replacing the seven men who had comprised the Council. Nationwide publicity was given to the election and to the town (nicknamed ‚ÄúShe-town‚Äù temporarily). These women accomplished a great deal to improve the ambiance and governance of the town. Over the next 50 years, the town flourished because of the influx of tourism, with many new stores, art galleries, restaurants, and overnight lodging. The weekly Rappahannock News newspaper was begun. Two performance arts theaters and a public library were established in the town.

The Town Council established a Historic District Ordinance and Architectural Review Board to protect and preserve the historic nature of the town. In 2006, an amendment was made to the town‚Äôs historic district designation, extending the period of historic significance to 1945. Many of the homes and other structures from the earliest period of the town survive today. 240x240px One of the most important events in the modern history of the town is the opening of The Inn at Little Washington in 1978.

An important building in the town's history is the Jennings House. Built in 1840 by Dr. Samuel B. Jennings, the house was transformed into a hospital during the Civil War. The historic Jennings House was converted to house the local government. In the Summer of 2016, local government offices & the Elkton Police Department were moved out of the Jennings building in favor of the Elkton Area Community Center. The decision was made by Town Council & the Mayor. The Jennings House is currently vacant. The town Christmas tree can be found across the street from the house.

Elkton houses two public schools: Elkton Elementary School, and Elkton Middle School. Elkton Elementary School was built in 1938 on West B Street to house Elkton High School, but its role changed when a new school was built. Elkton Middle School was originally Elkton High School, built in 1957 primarily for grades eight through twelve. Eventually grade eight was moved from the elementary school to the high school. Additions were built to the high school in 1967, building a ten-room annex for more classes; and the elementary school in 1972, replacing part of the original building. In 1980, a new high school, Spotswood Senior High School (now Spotswood High School), was built for East Rockingham County, Virginia, combining Montevideo and Elkton High Schools. The new school, located in Penn Laird, Virginia and literally on the Massanutten Mountain, housed grades 10-12. Ninth grade was added for the 1984-85 school year. Elkton Elementary School then housed a new grade‚ÄîKindergarten‚Äîthrough fifth grade. Elkton Middle had grades 6-9. Over the years, Elkton Elementary added programs such as Head Start for preschoolers. In the 1990s a baseball field, used for Elkton softball teams, was built next to the middle school. In the late 1990s, renovations were done to Elkton Elementary School, as well as the addition of a new playground was built specifically for the lower grades. In 2001, more construction took place as the old playground, with original wooden trucks and sharp metal edges, were ripped out, replaced by softer and brighter rounded metallic structures. In 2005, more renovations were done to Elkton Middle School, such as changing the old band room into an addition to the cafeteria, building a new computer lab, and adding another gym separate from the main for public use, such as the Elkton Recreation League Basketball teams. In 2006 the fifth grade was moved from Elkton Elementary School to the middle school because of the extra space made by the renovations made in 2005. In 2010 the fifth grade was moved back to the elementary school. In 2010, the County Board of Education opened a new high school for the eastern Rockingham area, East Rockingham High School, located in Solsburg beside River Bend Elementary School.

History  The Rockingham Springs Hotel was the first resort developed at Massanutten. In 1875, Gerald. T. Hopkins, a farmer, created a health spa from the natural springs.Hopkins, E.B. Rockingham Virginia Springs. Brochure. Harrisonburg, VA: Spirit of the Valley Power Job Press, 1893. A three-story hotel was built in the vicinity of the family hunting cabin (Hunters Cabin), which still stands at the present-day Hopkins Park, near the intersection of Lanier Lane and Massanutten Drive. When the popularity of health resorts declined, the hotel was closed in 1915. Sidney Lanier, a well-known poet, visited Rockingham Springs before taking a teaching position in literature at Johns Hopkins University. Lanier Lane roughly follows the route to the site of Rockingham Springs. In the late 1960s the great grandson of G.T. Hopkins, John L. Hopkins, envisioned a ski resort at Massanutten.  Development and growth  In 1973, the Massanutten Development Corporation was chartered by John L. Hopkins III (President), the great grandson of G.T. Hopkins, Leland Leachman, (Vice President) Donald Litten, Len LaSala (Del Webb employee appointed Massanutten general manager). One and one-half million dollars was paid to individual property owners to assemble 5,300 acre at a price of $100-$300/acre. One piece was purchased for $1000/acre. Hopkins invited the Del Webb Corporation to enter the partnership. In 1974, an economic downturn caused the Webb Corp to become the major stockholder. In 1977, Dale Stancil, former owner of Bryce Resort, purchased the resort for $1.9 million and renamed the property Massanutten Village, Inc. In 1980, John Swaim of First Federal Corp. acquired the resort for $4.0 million. In 1984, the current owner, Great Eastern Resorts (C. Dice Hammer and Jim Lambert) acquired the resort for $3.0 million in a bankruptcy reorganization plan.Swallow, Wendy. \\"Massanutten is Denied More Time On Its $35million Bailout Plan.\\" The Washington Post Oct. 20, 1984.Swallow, W. \\"Bankrupt Massanutten Resort Sold\\".

History It was originally named Castle's Wood's, as the land in the immediate area had once belonged to Jacob Castle, a frontiersman in the likes of Daniel Boone. Castle purchased the land from the Shawnee Indians, for very little in trade. It is reported that the purchase was made with the Shawnee Indians for a \\"hound dog, a knife, and a shot of whiskey. As a \\"Long Hunter\\", he spent long periods of time in the wilderness on hunting expeditions. There he befriended the Indians that inhabited the land in the Castlewood area. He married a Shawnee woman by the name of Gliding Swan and they produced many children. It has been said that Castle himself showed Daniel Boone the Cumberland Gap and areas west, which led to Boone's expedition and settlement of said lands. Many descendants of Castle reside in Russell County, Virginia and the surrounding area. Castle's father, Peter Cassell was a German emigrant to Pennsylvania who was influential in the Dutch movement to America.

The population was 2,034 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Scott County. Gate City is part of the Kingsport-Bristol (TN)-Bristol (VA) Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City-Kingsport-Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area - commonly known as the \\"Tri-Cities\\" region. Some scenes from The River were shot here. History In 1771, Silas Engart received a land grant of 200 acres that included the location of the future town. By the time of Scott County's formation in 1815, landowner James Davidson, Sr. donated approximately 13 acres of his plantation for establishing the county seat. The location of the town was such that it would emerge as an important commercial center for people and goods traveling through Big Moccasin Gap and the North Fork of the Holston River. When the county seat was established in 1815, it was named Winfield in honor of War of 1812 hero Gen. Winfield Scott. The main street of the new town honored war hero and future president Andrew Jackson. In 1817, the town was renamed Estillville in honor of Benjamin Estill, a local judge instrumental in the formation of the new county. As a result of the county seat's location near Big Moccasin Gap and the North Fork of the Holston River, the town grew into a commercial center for people passing through on their way westward, for farmers hoping to sell goods, and businessmen in town for legal affairs. A regular wagon train and coach line service conveying people, mail, and commercial goods between Bedford and Estilville. Gate City received its present name in 1886, when Attorney General Rufus A. Ayers pointed out that proximity to Big Moccasin Gap marked the town as the \\"Gate Way to the West.\\" The town was incorporated in 1892. By the beginning of the twentieth-century, Gate City was one of several \\"boom towns\\" located in southwestern Virginia. Although the streets were little more than dirt byways in the town, the area was a vibrant commercial and transportation center. Up to six daily passenger trains passed through Gate City. The town also had a railroad log yard where logs from all over the county were stored and then loaded to be later transported by train. Iron ore from the Snowflake and Nickelsville areas as well as glass sand from the south of Clinch Mountain were manufactured and shipped from Gate City. In addition, the town had a thriving manufacturing center in the area of Water Street where wood pumps, staves, sleds, and harnesses were built. By 1915, the town supported two livery stables on Willow Street and a blacksmith shop on Jackson Street, as well as a dentist's office, an ice plant, a casket shop, and a furniture manufacturing business. By the 1930s, Gate City had three movie theaters, banks, and a hotel. The town also had two businesses that dealt with auto sales and repairs. By the 1950s and 1960s, the town's momentum was slowing. As industry in Kingsport, Tennessee (6 miles to the south) attracted Gate City residents, several local businesses and small manufacturing companies shut down. By 2010, many former commercial buildings stood vacant, but the Gate City Historic District was newly listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The population was 1,253 at the 2010 census, an increase from 986 at the 2000 census, when the CDP was known as Basye-Bryce Mountain. Bryce Resort Bryce Resort is the core of Basye, a resort with six ski slopes, a small lake with a man-made beach, an 18 hole par 71 golf course and a mountain bike trail. Bryce offers activities such as tubing and skiing in winter, and ziplining, swimming, tennis, bungee jumping, grass skiing, and rock climbing in the summer. The resort has opened a downhill mountain bike course. There is also a small aircraft landing strip on the site. Bryce Resort occupies 400 acres and was first opened in 1909, owned by William Brice who opened Bryce‚Äôs Hillside Cottages and Mineral Baths as a way to catch the overflow of guests from nearby historic Orkney Springs Hotel. The name of the resort included a \\"y\\" instead of \\"i\\" in Bryce since William Brice reportedly wanted the business to have a different spelling than his last name. The early resort was rustic with hillside cottages and a dining hall, with most of the food grown on the premises. People would come to escape the city heat and take in the black sulphur spring in Basye. William Brice's son Pete and his wife Julie (who both adopted the Bryce spelling for their last name) began running the resort in 1947. In the 1960s they transformed the resort adding a ski slope and other amenities, selling 2,776 lots for a woodland mountain retreat aimed for the Washington, DC vacation home market.  Lake Laura  Lake Laura is the small lake or 44 acre pond owned by Bryce Resort. Lake Laura is formed by a dam impoundment of the headwaters of Big Stony Creek, creating a rectangular-shaped pool with a maximum depth of thirty feet. It is open to public use and has a boat ramp for that purpose. The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries DGIF) began managing the fishery and stocking fish in the pond in 1991. The pond has one of the highest density largemouth bass populations found anywhere in Virginia. Lake Laura had a history of nuisance algal blooms and over-abundant aquatic vegetation caused by nutrient-rich sediment.  History  Basye was named after a local family that lived in the area and whose cemetery remains off one of the holes on the golf course.

For highway travelers passing by, Mount Jackson is easily identified from I-81 exit 273 by the water tower painted as a basket of apples, which was recently repainted. For those exploring off the highway, the town has history as a commercial and railroad hub in the region, with rich Civil War heritage and a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History in 1739, attracted by rich valley land and abundant water supply, Benjamin Allen purchased a 400-acre tract at the confluence of Mill Creek and the North Fork of the Shenandoah River and established a grist mill by 1746. Soon other settlers and small mills followed. The village was known as Mount Pleasant. On January 28, 1826, an act of the General Assembly of Virginia changed the name of the village in honor of General Andrew Jackson, the hero of the War of 1812.https://www.virginia.org/listings/HistoricSites/HistoricTownofMountJackson/ Mount Jackson became relatively wealthy because of its location, about halfway between Winchester and Staunton along the Valley Turnpike through the Shenandoah Valley, at a place where a tributary, Mill Creek, fed into the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. This provided power for milling enterprises to serve the local farms. Another major road, Howard's Lick Turnpike, was started in 1856, originating in town heading towards mountainous western Virginia.http://shenandoahstories.org/tours/show/3 Generating further development, Mt. Jackson was the original terminus of the spur of the Manassas Gap Railroad that extended from Strasburg, Virginia. This railroad was a key conduit for the crops and produce of the region to go to market further east. The connection to Mt. Jackson was completed in 1859, but the Civil War stopped further construction so the line remained a spur with Mt. Jackson the endpoint. It was not until 1868, after the Baltimore & Ohio bought the line and repaired it from war damage, that the rail line was completed through to Harrisonburg. Mt. Jackson became a small but significant rail entrepot for grain, apples, and livestock, continuing to prosper as a mill and railroad town during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Civil War Era  Company G of the 33rd Regiment of Virginia Infantry, part of the famous \\"Stonewall Brigade\\" under command of General Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, was largely recruited in Mt. Jackson and vicinity. The town saw conflict during in the Civil War, incurred damage and was occupied by soldiers of both armies at various times. During his Valley Campaign of 1862, General Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson made one of his headquarters just south of town at a manor on Rude's Hill, about 3 miles south of Mt. Jackson. As a highly defensible high ground position, commanding the Valley Pike, the North Fork of the Shenandoah River and Meem's Bottom and approaches south, Rude's Hill had a particularly active role in the Civil War, occupied, encamped on and contested by both armies from 1862-1865. On November 16-18, 1863 Col. William H. Boyd's Union cavalry reconnoitered from West Virginia to the area of the Valley Pike. The Federal troopers skirmished at Woodstock, Edinburg and Mt. Jackson.https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/digicolls/henkel/CivilWarShenandoah.pdf North of Mt. Jackson the Federals encountered Confederate cavalry under command of Maj. Robert White. White. The rebel troopers retreated through Mt. Jackson fighting, crossing the bridges through Meems Bottom and to the defensible position on Rude's Hill. Realizing that White's horse artillery could sweep the bridge from the hill, Boyd withdrew from the skirmish at Rude's Hill and withdrew to Woodstock, pursued by Confederate cavalry. Boyd's reconnaissance-in-force then returned to West Virginia. Losses from the Mount Jackson cavalry engagement were light on both sides.https://stonesentinels.com/less-known/mt-jackson/cavalry-engagement-a26/ The Union Army under General Fremont crossing the north fork of the Shenandoah at Mt. Jackson during the 1862 campaign Troop movements and engagements in and near the town were particularly active in May 1864, around the Battle of New Market, 7 miles from Mt. Jackson. On May 14 a delaying action was fought at Rude's Hill by the Confederate 18th Virginia Cavalry, under the overall command of Col. John Imboden. The Confederate cavalry slowed the Union advance, enabling Gen. John Breckinridge to gather the main body of his Confederate forces at New Market, about 4 miles away. After losing the battle on May 15, Union General Franz Sigel managed to organize a rearguard on Rude's Hill, with infantry east of the turnpike, some cavalry west of the road and the artillery behind the line. Due to the exhaustion of the men and low ammunition, Sigel decided to retreat across the Meems bottomland and the North Fork of the Shenandoah River to Mount Jackson. Breckinridge at the same time, concerned the Federals would make a stand on Rude's Hill, advanced his cavalry and artillery to the crest of Rude's Hill where they shelled and harassed Sigel‚Äôs retreating Federals in Meems Bottom. The Union army managed to cross Mill Creek at Mt. Jackson and burned the bridge that spanned the creek to Mt. Jackson before the Confederates could catch up. Rude‚Äôs Hill was also the site of a Confederate stand following their demoralizing and humiliating defeat on September 22, 1864 at the Battle of Fisher‚Äôs Hill, about 23 miles north of Mt. Jackson. Gen. Jubal Early rallied and deployed his remaining Confederate infantry in line across the top of the hill on November 22, 1864 to check the advance of two divisions of Union cavalry following them. The Union cavalry charged the Confederate line but were repulsed in a sharp action. Early then retreated from Rude's Hill to Harrisonburg, eventually retreating to the entrance of the Shenandoah Valley at Browns Gap in the Blue Ridge. In a predawn raid on 3 Oct. 1864, Confederate Captain John McNeill led approximately 50 Confederate rangers against roughly 100 Union troopers of the 8th Ohio Cavalry Regiment guarding a bridge from Meems Bottom, a strategic crossing of the Valley Turnpike over the North Fork of the Shenandoah River to Mt. Jackson. The attack lasted just fifteen minutes with most of the Union cavalry captured but McNeill, one the best-known and feared Confederate partisan raiders as leader of McNeill's Rangers, was mortally wounded. He was taken to the house on Rude's Hill, where his identity was later discovered by Union General Philip Sheridan's troops. He was later secreted away by a band of Confederates after the Federals had temporarily left, thinking him to sick to move. McNeill was taken by the Confederates to Harrisonburg where he died on November 10.http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh12-1.html In October 1864, as part of Union General Phil Sheridan's 1864 Valley Campaign aimed at destroying anything of potential military value, Mt. Jackson's mill was obliterated. Towards the end of the war, Rude's Hill was also the scene of a cavalry skirmish when Confederate Brigadier General Thomas Rosser's troopers attacked Union troops guarding Confederate prisoners on March 7, 1865.http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/a-chronology-of-armed-conflict-in-the- shenandoah-valley/ Outside of troop movements or significant engagements, Civil War skirmishes were recorded as happening at Mt. Jackson on March 25, 1862; June 3, 6 and 16, 1862; November 18, 1863; September 23-24, 1864; October 3, 1864; and March 7, 1865. As the southern terminus of a north/south railroad line connecting to Northern Virginia, Mt. Jackson was an ideal location for military hospitals and became a center for military medical treatment, ultimately used by both sides in the conflict. A Confederate hospital was built in Mt. Jackson along the Manassas Gap Railroad in 1861, to which wounded and sick were to be transported by rail from the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Dr. Andrew Russell Meem, a graduate of Princeton University and a native of Mt. Jackson, ran the hospital and the land was donated by Col. Levi Rinker, a large slaveowner and one of the wealthiest families in the valley. The hospital, intended as a wayside hospital for intermediate care not a permanent treatment facility for badly wounded, consisted of three two story buildings and could accommodate 500 patients, a mixture of wounded soldiers and those sick from disease. The hospital functioned nearly continuously throughout the war, attending to wounded from the battles of Antietam, Gettysburg as well as the Shenandoah Valley campaigns. In addition, with shifting control of the town some Union soldiers were treated at the hospital and at other makeshift hospitals in the town, including Union Church. A Confederate cemetery was established across from the hospital, directly along the tracks of the railroad. At the end of the war in 1865, Union troops tore down the hospital, using the lumber to build an federal occupation installation on Rude's Hill, 3 miles south of Mt. Jackson. This post was removed in 1875 when the Reconstruction era ended.https://shenandoahcivilwarhistory.blog/2018/11/25/confederate-e-r-and-r- i-p-at-mount-jackson/ The Confederate cemetery is all that visibily remains of the hospital today in the town of Mt.

Jackson, Virginia is the little red brick Union Church in the center of town, built circa 1825, one of the oldest structure in the town. In 1822 an early settler bequeathed to the town a lot to build a nondenominational church for the use of any Christian congregations in the area. A frame church was originally erected on the site, but was replaced by the present brick structure around 1825. The church was used by both sides during the Civil War, including use as a hospital, with etchings on the walls by passing soldiers. Daniel Grey, a Revolutionary War soldier, lays buried here. Many of the most prominent early citizens of the area lay at rest in the church yard.

Bowman Andros Products has a fruit processing factory in Mt. Jackson. A recent successful enterprise located in the town is Route 11 Potato Chips. Transportation I-81 in Mount Jackson The primary highway passing by Mount Jackson is Interstate 81, which continues south to southwestern Virginia and Tennessee, and north to West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York. Virginia State Route 292 connects I-81 to U.S. Route 11, the original and historic Valley Turnpike which now serves as the main local road passes through downtown Mount Jackson. Rt. 11, the historic route through the Shenandoah Valley, roughly parallels I-81 and offers access to it. Virginia State Route 263 named Orkney Springs Road extends westward from US 11 in Mount Jackson, connecting to Basye resort area and the historic Orkney Springs in the mountains of westernmost Shenandoah County. The out-of-service Norfolk Southern rail line in Mt. Jackson, Virginia was originally the terminus of the Manassas Gap Railroad. Norfolk Southern has a rail line extending through Mt. Jackson, originally part of the historic Manassas Gap Railroad, that it has put out of service, lacking industrial demand. The last train traveled south from Mt. Jackson in 2014. In 2016 Norfolk Southern announced that it would no longer be maintaining the railbed, and the rail line has become overgrown with weeds and brush. Pending formal abandonment by the Norfolk Southern, a consortium of public, private and non-profit organizations based in the counties of Shenandoah and Rockingham, Virginia have come together in an exploratory group called the Shenandoah Rail Trail Partnership to seek transformation of the 38.5 mile out-of-service rail corridor from Strasburg to Broadway (including Mt. Jackson as a historic hub) into a multi-use trail.https://shenandoahalliance.org/project/shenandoah-rail-trail- partnership/ Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 1,664 people, 667 households, and 440 families residing in the town.

It is the largest town by population in the county and is known for its grassroots art culture, pottery, antiques, and American Civil War history. Strasburg has blended the nostalgia of the past with the inspiration of the future. The population was 6,398 at the 2010 census. History=Early settlers German-speaking Pennsylvanians were among the first non-native settlers to arrive in the northern Shenandoah Valley and Strasburg area. The luscious greenery and fertile land were prime targets for immigrant farmers. On August 21, 1734 speculator Henry Willis was granted total of this land by William Gooch, Virginia's Lieutenant Governor and Commander in Chief. Gooch wished to settle the valley to create a buffer between Native American tribes and the rest of the Virginia colony. During the summer of 1735, Willis sold his entire property to Jacob Funk. Jacob in return, partitioned his new purchase, reselling a part of it to his brother John. In contrast to the English culture found east of the Blue Ridge, Strasburg was settled with family farms and towns rather than plantations; few slaves; and Germanic language, religions, architecture and decorative arts. The thriving agricultural community that developed in the fertile bottomland along the banks of the Shenandoah River boasted scenic views of the Massanutten and Allegheny Mountains. Later nicknamed ‚ÄúPot Town,‚Äù Strasburg also became a center for the production of both utilitarian and fancy earthenware and stoneware pottery. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many residents worked for the railroad industry and at limestone quarries; after WW II, other industries came to Strasburg, including paper and auto parts manufacture. Today Strasburg boasts a growing service economy, museums, eateries, numerous antique stores and other shops. Founder Peter Stover (Petrus Stauffer) is considered the founder of the town of Strasburg. Stover was born in 1715 to a German-Swiss father, Christian Stauffer I., in Mannheim, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. Stauffer took his family to America in 1718, to gain religious freedom, and settled in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania where he would live out his entire life. His son Peter migrated south to Virginia by 1730 and to the Shenandoah Valley as early as 1739. On May 2, 1749 Stover purchased of land from Jacob Funk, his future father-in-law. The purchase was divided into smaller plots for sale to other settlers and a village was informally established. Stover applied for a town charter in November 1761 giving the town the official name of Strasburg.William Waller Hening, editor, The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of all the Laws of Virginia, from the First Session of the Legislature in the year 1619, 13 vols. (Richmond: Franklin Press, 1820), vol. VII, page pp. 473-476, Chapter VII, \\"An Act for establishing the towns of Staunton, in the county of Augusta, and New London in the county of Bedford, and Strasburg in the county of Frederick,\\" November 1761, digital images, Google Books (http://google.com/books : 26 November 2014). The name was taken from Strasbourg, the capital of Alsace, France. Some called the area Staufferstadt, the German name for Stoverstown. Ten trustees were named; William Miller, Matthew Harrison, Jacob Bowman, Valentine Smith, Charles Buck, Peter Stover, Isaac Hite, Leonard Baltice, John Funk, and Philip Huffman (Hoffman). Peter eventually married Frainey Funk, before he died August 13, 1799 at the age of 84. He was survived by eight children. Being a philanthropist for most of his life, Stover's will left land and $10,000 to the community to establish schools. A monument resides in Strasburg's Riverview Cemetery honoring Peter Stover, but the whereabouts of his grave is unknown.

It has a population of 5,212 according to the 2017 census. Woodstock comprises 3.2 square miles of incorporated area of the town, and is located along the \\"Seven Bends\\" of the north fork of the Shenandoah River. While some tourism references list Woodstock as the fourth oldest town in Virginia, the area was sparsely settled and perhaps platted in 1752 or shortly thereafter, but the town was actually established by charter in 1761. While there are a number of Virginia towns closer to the eastern seaboard that claim earlier founding dates, Woodstock was one of the first towns west of the Blue Ridge. The Massanutten Military Academy is located in Woodstock, as is the national headquarters of Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority. Woodstock is also home to the River Bandits of the Valley Baseball League, the Shenandoah County Public School's Central campus, and the Shenandoah County Fairgrounds. History The town was established by charter in March 1761 as a part of what was then Frederick County. It was originally formed from a land grant from Lord Fairfax, and founded as Muellerstadt (Miller Town) in 1752 by founder Jacob Muller (or \\"Mueller\\"). The town's charter was sponsored by George Washington in Virginia's House of Burgesses. Woodstock has been the County Seat of Shenandoah County, since Shenandoah County's formation in 1772.  Colonial era  The Shenandoah Valley region around Woodstock was settled by Pennsylvania Germans who migrated south down the natural route of the Shenandoah Valley in the mid 1700s. The majority of these German settlers tended small farms that grew crops other than tobacco, were not slaveholders and had Protestant faiths different from the established Anglican church in Virginia. They thus had different culture and beliefs than the English society that was prevalent on the eastern side of the mountains. The Senedo people lived in the Shenandoah Valley around Woodstock, but they disappeared as a tribe prior to European settlement, possibly from attack by the Catawba to the south. By the time the German settlers arrived, few Native Americans lived in the Shenandoah Valley. Several later tribes hunted in the valley, among them the Shawnee, Occoneechee, Monocans and Piscataways and the powerful Iroquois Confederation, so while not inhabiting the area Indians were likely not an uncommon sight. The seven bends have locations associated with Indian mounds dating back to the Late Woodland Period (AD 900‚Äì1650) in the area of the river between Woodstock and Strasburg, Virginia. After 250 years of plowing by settlers, the mounds have largely disappeared from sight, though traces of them have been detected with aerial photography In the early days, relations between Indians and settlers were friendly.https://www.townofwoodstockva.com/DocumentCenter/View/234/1-History?bidId= In the 1750s settlers began to sense trouble when Indians moved further west, over the Allegheny Mountains, where they were under influence of the French. During the French and Indian War, the French encouraged Indian raiding parties against so-called \\"English settlers\\" though most settlers in the Woodstock area were likely peaceable Germans. In the 1760s, there was constant danger of Indian raids, with some atrocities and brutality. The last Indian raid in the area occurred in 1766, three years after the formal end of the French and Indian War, about two miles south of Woodstock. Route 11, which runs through Woodstock, was originally an Indian trail that served as a route between the Catawba in the south and the Delawares in the north, who were warring rivals. This came to be known as the Indian Road, and was the main route for settlement and travel through the Shenandoah Valley. With many improvements, Route 11 has largely followed this route, which was later called the Great Wagon Road and then the Valley Pike. Jacob Muller apparently used this old trail in laying out the plans for the main street of what would become Woodstock. Muellerstadt was the early name for Woodstock.  Establishment of the town  The new village was established by an act in 1761, sponsored by George Washington. The town was renamed Woodstock at that time. George Washington was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, representing Frederick County (the Woodstock area was then part of Frederick County and would remain so until 1772.) The act of the General Assembly gave full credit to Jacob Muller for initiating the idea. Muller came from Germany in 1749 and had temporarily settled in Pennsylvania. By 1752 he obtained 400 acres from Lord Fairfax for the area that would eventually be included in the town limits of Woodstock. Muller settled in Narrow Passage near Woodstock, and in the next few years his holdings grew to something between 1200 and 2000 acres, and he proceeded to lay out a plan for the town, Mullerstadt. A few white settlers had preceded Muller, as the 1761 act establishing the town noted \\"several persons are now living there\\". It is realistic to assume this meant a scattering of log buildings. However, Muller's town plan was that referred to in the 1761 General Assembly act that established Woodstock. There is no clear reason why the town's name was changed to Woodstock, though theories include it being renamed by Washington or perhaps for a wood stockade used by the community as shelter from Indian raids. Notwithstanding, Jacob Muller's town continued for many years to be known as Millerstown, or to German-language residents, Muellerstadt. During the years following the establishment of the town, Muller held a big land sale in which 40 parcels he plotted were purchased. Muller died in 1766, just four years after his land sales. Andrew Brewbaker, his son-in-law, became proprietor of his grant, supported by a board of trustees appointed by the General Assembly to govern the new town. This form of government continued until 1795, when the town was authorized to hold elections. Unfortunately, the Town Trustees appointed in 1761 left no records, so early history of Woodstock as a town cannot be determined with accuracy. There was also no local newspaper until 1817.  Revolutionary Era  In 1772, Woodstock became the county seat of Dunmore County (renamed Shenandoah County in 1777 during the Revolutionary War, shedding the name of the controversial last Royal governor of Virginia). Being named the county seat had significant impact for the development of the town. As a county seat, Woodstock necessitated the building of a courthouse and jail. By 1774, the county had erected a permanent courthouse. That original court house was replaced in 1795 with a limestone building designed by Thomas Jefferson, using native limestone. It was enlarged in 1871 and 1886. The Shenandoah County Courthouse, located on Main Street, is the oldest courthouse still in use west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, a native of Pennsylvania who was formerly a soldier in the British Army and German dragoons, accepted a call to become pastor to a Woodstock congregation in 1771. After theological training, he served both Lutherans and Episcopalians for four years in a wide-ranging pastorate in the Shenandoah Valley. During this time he was drawn to in politics, serving in the House of Burgesses in 1774 and as a delegate to the First Virginia Convention. Muhlenberg became famous for his impassioned speeches for the revolutionary cause, helping to raise a regiment in the Shenandoah Valley among its German and Scots-Irish frontier population. He would lead this regiment, the 8th Virginia, as its Colonel in the Continental Army. At the conclusion of his fiery farewell sermon in Woodstock on January 21, 1776, Muhlenberg famously threw off his clerical robes to reveal an officer's uniform beneath and proclaimed, (according to later reports), ‚Äúin the language of Holy Writ there is a time for all things, a time to preach and a time to pray, but those times have passed away. There is a time to fight, and that time has now come.‚Äù Muhlenberg went on to be promoted to a general in the Continental Army and led units in many battles, from Brandywine to Yorktown. Upon the end of the war in 1783, he did not return to live in Woodstock, but instead returned to his native Pennsylvania as a war hero, served in elected capacities and then was elected to the First Congress (1788-1789) and several successive Congresses. Elected to the Senate in 1801, he resigned to return to a revenue post in Philadelphia, where he died on October 1, 1807. While his statue in Congress' National Statuary Hall Collection was submitted by Pennsylvania in 1889, Muhlenberg has been revered in Woodstock for his fiery sermon and the unit he raised and inspired to fight for the nation's independence. The frontier- recruited 8th Virginia Regiment was drawn from Augusta, Berkeley, Culpeper, Dunmore (Shenandoah), Fincastle, Frederick Counties in the Shenandoah Valley, the district of West Augusta and Hampshire County which are in present-day West Virginia, and elsewhere along the Virginia frontier, which stretched from Kentucky to Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh, PA.) Two of the ten companies were raised from the Dunmore County area of Woodstock. It was led by Muhlenberg, Colonel of the regiment and Abraham Bowman, Lt. Colonel, both from Woodstock. The 8th Virginia was called \\"The German Regiment\\" though it also contained substantial numbers of Scots-Irish. Frequently separated and detached to other units, the men of this tough, frontier-bred regiment served with distinction in many theatres of the war: White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Short Hills, Cooch's Bridge, Brandywine, Saratoga, Germantown and Charleston. They suffered the hardships at Valley Forge, and were afterwards mustered out of service, with those who reenlisted merging into other Virginia units.  Railroads  The commercial importance of Woodstock was enhanced by the coming of the railroad, and the railroad has significant impact upon the Woodstock's development. The first railroad south of Strasburg was the Manassas Gap Railroad. On 2 March 1859 the line was extended to Mount Jackson. The Civil War interrupted the work however, and the line remained a long spur from Strasburg, with Mt Jackson as the terminus. In 1865 the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O;) acquired and reconstructed the line after extensive damage during the Civil War, merging it with the Orange & Alexandria to form the Orange, Alexandria and Manassas Railroad. They then extended the line to Harrisonburg in 1868. In 1872, the B&O; formed a separate subsidiary railroad on the line known as the Strasburg & Harrisonburg RR (S&H; RR). In 1873 the B&O; RR leased and operated the S&H; RR between Strasburg and Harrisonburg. But the B&O; encountered financial difficulties and sold the S&H; railroad subsidiary to the Southern Railway in 1896. In 1888 the B&O; built a passenger station in Woodstock, made with native limestone, noted as one of the more elaborate passenger depots in the region. Woodstock became a freight rail entrepot with outward bound shipments of grain, cattle and fruit and inward bound freight of manufactured goods, rail service that continued into the 1960s. Passenger service ended in 1948 and freight rail service began to decline in the 1950s, reflecting a nationwide shift to cars and trucks with the advent of the national highway system. While individual industries were still served, sometime before 1969 regular freight depot service ended and the Woodstock freight depot was demolished in the 1970s. The Southern Railway merged with the Norfolk & Western in 1982 to become the Norfolk Southern Railroad, which owns the line through Woodstock to this day. However, industrial need for the line ended, and the rail between Strasburg between Edinburg (through Woodstock) is out of service, though the track remains. In 1954 the B&O; sold the passenger station and it was torn down in 1954 by a local businessman despite protests of many locals, and its loss damaged Woodstock's historical character and heritage as a once-active railroad town.  Civil War Era  Confederate military units raised in Woodstock included Company F (the Muhlenberg Rifles) of the 10th Virginia Infantry (of whom 71% had German surnames) as well as Company C of the 33rd Virginia Infantry, part of the Stonewall Brigade led by Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson. While the area had an active Confederate population, it also was home to many reluctant secessionists, Unionists and families religiously opposed to slavery and war (Mennonites, German Dunkards.) In addition, traditional enmity between the slavery-based plantation society in eastern Virginia and the small farm populations over the rugged Blue Ridge and Allegheny mountains, where slavery was not as predominant an economic institution, meant that allegiances in the Shenandoah Valley and western Virginia were often divided. Many of German descent in the Shenandoah Valley were generally or religiously opposed to slavery, even as others with German ethnicity served in the Confederate Army. The Civil War left no serious visible scars on the town, although there was partisan activity and retaliation. A few buildings were destroyed, notably the railroad depot and some warehouses along with a locomotive and some rolling stock. No major battles were fought in the immediate vicinity of the town, although skirmishes and large troop movements were not uncommon. Recorded skirmishes in Woodstock were May 18 and 21, 1862; June 2, 1862; February 26, 1863; November 16, 1863; September 23, 1864; and March 14, 1865.http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/a-chronology-of-armed-conflict-in-the- shenandoah-valley/ Various homes were used from time to time as staff headquarters by both sides, and as the occasional military hospital. General Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson made Woodstock his headquarters during part of his Valley Campaign in spring 1962, using the small brick law office near the courthouse. Union General Phil Sheridan sent a famous telegraph message from Woodstock during his own Valley campaign in 1864, during which his army destroyed anything of military value to the Confederates, stating ‚ÄúI have destroyed over 2,000 barns filled with wheat, burned over 70 mills filled with grain and flour. I have made the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia so bare that a crow flying over it would have to carry its knapsack.‚Äùhttp://www.shenandoahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/view.php?history Prior to the Battle of Tom's Brook and the Woodstock Races, Gen. George Armstrong Custer rode in front of his cavalry and made a famous gesture of salute to Confederate enemy and West Point classmate, Maj Gen. Thomas L. Rosser. One small but significant cavalry battle occurred 4.5 miles north of Woodstock, at Tom's Brook on October 9, 1864. The Battle of Tom's Brook followed a Union victory at the Battle of Fisher's Hill. After Fisher's Hill, Sheridan's Union cavalry pursued Jubal Early's Confederates south to Staunton, after which the Federals withdrew, devastating anything of military benefit in their path, a campaign known in the Shenandoah as \\"The Burning.\\" Rebel cavalry harassed the withdrawal, until Union troopers under Wesley Merritt and George Armstrong Custer turned and routed the divided Confederate divisions of Rosser and Lomax at Tom's Brook, 5 miles south of Strasburg and 4.5 miles north of Woodstock. The Confederate cavalry's disorderly retreat from battle became known as the \\"Woodstock Races\\", because the routed Rebel troopers fled back in disarray through Woodstock all the way to Mt. Jackson. A total of 6,300 Federal troopers and 3,500 Confederates engaged in the battle, with Union casualties at 57 and Confederate losses at 350. With the victory, the Union cavalry attained superiority in the Valley. The Battle of Tom's Brook preceded by ten days the dramatic, large-scale and climactic battle at Cedar Creek (just north of Strasburg) between Early and Sheridan, which ended in a decisive Union victory that smashed any real threat of Confederate power in the Shenandoah or invasion of Washington DC via the Valley. The Battle of Tom's Brook, and the \\"Woodstock Races,\\" occurred in significant part along the Valley Pike, now Route 11. About 20 miles south of the town, the Battle of New Market also had Woodstock context. In conjunction with spring 1864 offensives, Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant ordered Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel to move down the Valley Pike from West Virginia to Lynchburg, to destroy its railroads and canal while denying the rich Shenandoah Valley to the Confederacy. Receiving intelligence on these movements, Confederate Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge scraped together all available troops, including cadets from Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington. Sigel's advance was slowed by Confederate cavalry and undermined by his own command jealousies and inept decisions, but on May 11 his cavalry captured a lightly defended Woodstock. The Confederates were forced out of Woodstock so fast that several telegrams between Breckinridge and his cavalry commander John D. Imboden fell into Union hands. These Woodstock dispatches revealed strength and location of Confederate forces as well as a rough time table for a cavalry rendezvous with the main Confederate force - potentially a game-changing intelligence coup. But rather than acting decisively, Sigel continued his cautious advance, allowing Confederates time to concentrate. Breckenridge decided to attack Sigel's army, which had advanced from Woodstock. The Battle of New Market occurred on morning of May 15. Threatened by cavalry on his flank and rear, Sigel withdrew and retreated through Woodstock all the way to Strasburg. Sigel's army outnumbered Breckinridge's by 6,275 to 4,087. Union losses were 841 while Confederate casualties were 531. The Valley remained in Confederate control until Sheridan's arrival.  Historic Structures  Lantz Hall, a structure at Massanutten Military Academy, and the Shenandoah County Courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Woodstock Historic District comprising the historic center of the town of Woodstock, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. It includes examples of early architecture in the town from its earliest years into the 1940s, having been little altered since then. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 3,952 people, 1,685 households, and 1,029 families residing in the town. The population density was 1,216.9 people per square mile (469.5/km2).

Geography Woodstock is located at (38.877075, ‚àí78.511521). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 3.2 square miles (8.4 km2), all of it land. The town is located 11.4 miles (18.3 km) southwest of Strasburg, 18 miles (29 km) southwest of Middletown, and 31.5 miles southwest of Winchester. Woodstock is located along the \\"Seven Bends\\" of the north fork of the Shenandoah River, which are seven significant meanders that are unusually sharp and tightly packed. In 48 miles (77 kilometers) of flow, the river travels only 16 miles (26 kilometers) as the crow flies.https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/84837/the-sinuous- shenandoah These large looping turns in the river were in earlier times a significant feature for which the town was known.  Climate  The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. July highs averaging 85.1F. Winters are cool, with January lows averaging 20.1F. Snowfall averages 23 inches per year, while rainfall per year averages 37 inches. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Woodstock has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps. The hardiness zone is 6b.Woodstock experiences a Humid Subtropical climate.  Recreation  Seven Bends State Park is located just outside of the Town of Woodstock with 1,066 acre area in total. The master plan for Seven Bends State Park was adopted on November 26, 2008, by the Department of Conservation and Recreation(DCR). The park is in the geographically unique \\"seven bends\\" area of the North Fork of the Shenandoah River and will provide access to the river's north fork. The park's eastern border is shared with the George Washington- Jefferson National Forest and the park's western boundary is the North Fork of the Shenandoah River with a four-mile long shoreline. Seven Bends State Park, just outside of Woodstock, is one of the newest additions to the Virginia state park system and was formally opened in 2019. The Woodstock Tower, built in 1935 by the Civilian Conservation Corps, is located on a 2000 ft mountain that overlooks the town. The tower is a popular sightseeing attraction, providing panoramic views of the valleys on either side and of the seven bends of the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. The road to the tower crumbled due to erosion in March 2019 and is closed for repairs. $350,000 worth of repairs are being made by Virginia Department of Transportation. The target date for the road re-opening was November 2019. The road re-opened again in November 2019. In the August to September time frame each year, Woodstock's Shenandoah County Fairgrounds plays host to the Shenandoah County Fair, which includes concerts, harness racing, craft and farm exhibitions. The Shenandoah County Fair has been held on these premises since 1917. In addition, the Fairgrounds host a horse harness racing season in September and October called Shenandoah Downs. Viticultural attractions The Shenandoah Valley's relatively dry climate, warm days and cool nights are conducive to producing good wine The climate allows grapes to attain higher acidity, which is generally positive for wine. Limestone soil, which is common to the Valley, has been long associated with great wine growing regions in Europe. The region is a designated American Viticultural Area (AVA), Virginia's first AVA, identified in 1982. The Shenandoah Valley is relatively dry, a \\"rain shadow\\" as storms soak the mountains on either side of the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains; The growing season in the valley is distinctly warmer and drier than in neighboring Virginia regions, which don't have the natural rain barrier from the nearby mountains and where, east of the Blue Ridge, vineyard soils are primarily clay and loam. The annual rainfall in the Valley is one half that of the Virginia average. These conditions are thus more favorable for Cabernet Franc, Chambourcin, Cabernet Sauvignon, Lemberger, Petit Manseng, Petit Verdot, Pinot Noir, and Riesling. The area around Woodstock has several wineries. Muse Vineyards is located in Woodstock, within the \\"Seven Bends\\" area of the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. Other nearby wineries include Cave Ridge Vineyard, about 14 miles southwest of Woodstock in the rural hills of Shenandoah County, and Shenandoah Vineyards, about 4.5 miles from Woodstock in Edinburg VA, reportedly the second oldest active winery in Virginia (founded in 1976). In addition to wineries, Woodstock also has a craft brewery, the Woodstock Brew House, founded in 2015, housed in a restored industrial-age facility that was formerly a Woodstock denim factory.  Economy  The largest employers in Woodstock as of 2016 were Shenandoah County School Board, Shenandoah County, Valley Health Care System, Wal-Mart, Food Lion and Lowes.  Transportation  View north along Interstate 81 from SR 42 in Woodstock Interstate 81 is the main highway providing access to Woodstock. I-81 extends south to Tennessee and north to West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York. Virginia State Route 42 extends southwest from Woodstock into rural southwestern Shenandoah County. SR 42 also connects I-81 to U.S. Route 11, which serves as a local service road for I-81 and is known as Main Street within Woodstock. Route 11 follows the historical route through the Shenandoah Valley, and was once known as the Indian Road and later the Great Wagon Road and the Valley Pike. Route 11 is now the principal local through road connecting towns in the Valley and is dotted with historical markers and scenic points. The Norfolk Southern railroad has a rail line that runs through town for which service has been discontinued, but Norfolk Southern has been unclear as to whether they will fully abandon the line. It is part of a roughly 17 mile stretch of discontinued railroad line from Edinburgh, VA to Strasburg, VA. Norfolk Southern announced in 2016 it was planning on no longer servicing the line. The rail bed is now increasingly overgrown with weeds and has not been maintained and putting it back into service would be costly and especially unlikely since there is no prospect of industry that needs rail service in volume that would be profitable for Norfolk Southern. There is discussion and ideas surrounding making 2.5 miles of the discontinued line in Woodstock into a rail trail, but the program's funding has not been determined, and neither have the intentions of Norfolk Southern regarding the rail line. As part of its fiscal 2018 budget, the Woodstock Town Council approved $40,000 in capital improvement funds to hire a designer to develop blueprints of the trail system, but no designer has been hired yet, as the program is still in the \\"exploratory phase\\". Shenandoah Valley Commuter Bus Service offers weekday commuter bus service from Northern Shenandoah Valley including Shenandoah County and Warren County to Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. including Arlington County and Fairfax County. Origination points in Shenandoah County include Woodstock. Origination points in Warren County include Front Royal and Linden.

As the Schaarbeek type cherries have become more difficult to find, some brewers have replaced these (partly or completely) with other varieties of sour cherries, sometimes imported. Etymology The name is derived from the Flemish word for this type of cherry (kriek). Brewing Traditionally, kriek is made by breweries in and around Brussels using lambic beer to which sour cherries (with the pits) are added. A lambic is a sour and dry Belgian beer, fermented spontaneously with airborne yeast said to be native to Brussels; the presence of cherries (or raspberries) predates the almost universal use of hops as a flavoring in beer. A traditional kriek made from a lambic base beer is sour and dry as well. The cherries are left in for a period of several months, causing a refermentation of the additional sugar. Typically no sugar will be left so there will be a fruit flavour without sweetness. There will be a further maturation process after the cherries are removed. More recently, some lambic brewers have added sugar to the final product of their fruit beers, in order to make them less intense and more approachable to a wider audience. They also use cherry juice rather than whole cherries and are matured for much shorter periods.Oliver, Garrett. (2011). The Oxford Companion to Beer. United Kingdom: Oxford University Press. p. 522. . Retrieved March 14, 2019. Framboise is a related, less traditional Belgian beer, fermented with raspberries instead of sour cherries. Kriek is also related to gueuze, which is not a fruit beer but is also based on refermented lambic beer. Some breweries, like Liefmans, make \\"kriek\\" beers based on oud bruin beer instead of lambic.

Sherwood Anderson (1876-1941), the well-known American author who strongly influenced the style of writing in the United States between World Wars I and II, was a Marion, Virginia resident for several years, and is buried in the town's Round Hill Cemetery. His writing greatly influenced and impacted other notable authors such as Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner, both of whom owe the first publication of their books directly to his efforts. Katherine Johnson (also known as Katherine Goble, August 26, 1918 ‚Äì February 24, 2020), an American NASA mathematician whose calculations were crucial to the success of US crewed spaceflights, began her distinguished career by accepting her first job as a teacher at a black public school (The Carnegie school) in Marion in 1937. Her many accolades included the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded to her by President Barack Obama in 2015, and the portrayal of her by Taraji P. Henson as a lead character in the 2016 film Hidden Figures. Marion is known for being the birthplace of the soft drink Mountain Dew, but the original drink was created in Knoxville, Tennessee. Although Mountain Dew was first marketed under that name in Knoxville, the original soft drink's formula changed drastically from Knoxville's formula to the syrup mixture that constitutes today's drink. In 1961, the rights to Mountain Dew were purchased by the Marion-based Tip Corporation. The Mountain Dew flavor was reworked by Marion resident William H. \\"Bill\\" Jones. Due to the success of the revised formulation, the Pepsi Corporation purchased the Tip Corporation in 1964. Marion also hosted the Mountain Dew Festival for more than 50 years.[Reprinted article by Glenna Elledge, Wednesday 7/27/94 issue of Smyth County News: ] In 1965, after graduating from Alvin High School, one of Major League Baseball's Hall of Famer pitchers, Nolan Ryan, signed a professional baseball contract with the New York Mets, and was assigned to a minor league team in the Appalachian League called the Marion Mets (1965‚Äì1976) in Marion, Virginia. Three years later Ryan pitched in the major leagues, debuting with the Mets in 1968. Another notable Major League Baseball pitcher, relief pitcher William E. \\"Billy\\" Wagner, has close ties to Marion. Billy Wagner was born in Marion, Virginia on July 25, 1971, spent the majority of his youth as a Marion resident, and continues to possess many relatives who reside in town. The seven time All-Star is one of only six relief pitchers in Major League Baseball history to accumulate a career (1995-2010) total of 400 or more saves.

The population was 564 at the 2010 census. History John Boykin acquired a tract to the south of what became the town on the road to Severn, North Carolina, which lay partly in Virginia and partly in North Carolina. In 1829 Boykin and his wife sold the land and moved to Alabama. In 1835, Edward Beaton, one of three brothers who were living in Isle of Wight County near the Blackwater River, came to Southampton County and acquired the tract of land that is now known as Boykins from Francis Rochelle. Beaton, who was a continuous resident of Boykins until his death in 1880, is given credit for the founding of the town.Boykins ‚Äì One Hundred and Twenty Years (1835-1955) by Norman S. Beaton. The Beaton-Powell House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Completed in 1857, this two story plantation house has a living area that exceeds four thousand square feet and has an additional five hundred square feet of porch space. This residence has classic Greek Revival characteristics: the front portico with its pediment-like roof line supported by four columns; its bilateral symmetry; the corner pilasters that shoulder a wide entablature; the two- and four-panel doors; the two-over-two double hung sash windows and the five-inch exposure clapboard. The large roof overhang supported by massive brackets illustrates the Italianate influence. The milled timber framing is supported by a continuous brick foundation. All eight fireplace surrounds, exposed heart pine floors and most of its plaster walls, ceilings, crown molding and medallions are a few of the interior features that remain undisturbed. The original kitchen, which predates the house, still exists but has been relocated nearby, off the property. A noncontributing building on the property was constructed to complement the house. The Beaton-Powell House has an abundance of Italianate embellishments but is primarily of the Greek Revival Style, alternately, in its antebellum heyday, called the National or Democratic and even the American Greek Revival Style.1 This two-story plantation house was built in 1857 on a 600-acre tract of land, known as Boykins Depot by the town's founder, Edward Beaton.2 The house is now located on a half-acre landscaped lot at the northwest corner of Main Street and Virginia Avenue in the Town of Boykins, Southampton County, Virginia.3 Three conspicuous diagonal braces link together four paired, seven- inch square chamfered columns that support the massive, elaborate two tiered central portico which is capped with a gable roof.

Situated on the north bank of the Rappahannock River at the falls, the community is north of and opposite the city of Fredericksburg. Recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place (CDP), Falmouth's population was 4,274 as of the 2010 census.  History  Founded in 1728 by the same act of the Virginia General Assembly that established neighboring Fredericksburg, Falmouth was created as a port town on the Rappahannock to serve inhabitants living north of the river within the vast Northern Neck holdings of Lord Fairfax. His agent, Robert \\"King\\" Carter, promoted the establishment of the town, and the Carter family played a dominant role in the town's development throughout much of the colonial period. Hunter's Ironworks, also known as Rappahannock Forge, was an iron furnace located near Falmouth. Thomas Jefferson made special provision to protect the ironworks during the American Revolution. The Falmouth Road was a colonial road that served as the main route connecting Winchester in the Shenandoah Valley to the port of Falmouth. This road follows a northwesterly route that was originally called the Shenandoah Hunting Path and crossed through the Piedmont counties of Stafford and Fauquier before passing over the Blue Ridge Mountains at Ashby's Gap. Modern day US Highway 17 follows much of this route. Originally located within King George County, Falmouth became part of Stafford when county lines were redrawn in 1776. It was a stop on the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad in the 19th century which was replaced by CSXT today. During the American Civil War, Falmouth was occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863, and Northern commanders located their headquarters southeast of the town during the Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville campaigns. In May 1864, Union wounded and Confederate prisoners from the Battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House were transported through the area to the wharves at Belle Plain on Potomac Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River, located east of Falmouth. Today Falmouth is a residential community and a suburb of Fredericksburg. Among the community's significant historic structures is Belmont, the home of American artist Gari Melchers, now a historic house museum administered by University of Mary Washington. Chatham Manor, the 1771 home of William Fitzhugh and a Union headquarters during the Civil War, is located downstream from Falmouth, opposite the historic district of Fredericksburg. It is administered by the National Park Service as part of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania County Battlefields Memorial National Military Park and now serves as park headquarters. In addition to Belmont, Carlton, Clearview, Conway House, Falmouth Historic District, Hunter's Ironworks, Union Church and Cemetery, and White Oak Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The population was 378 at the 2010 census. A granite marker stands as a memorial to the arrival of British settlers in the area. The town was incorporated in 1886, had a port on the James River, and gained railroad service as a terminus for a while before being abandoned. Claremont was home to the Temperance, Industrial, and Collegiate Institute, a school for African Americans founded by a former slave. The area includes a historical marker commemorating the institution.  History  A granite marker in a circle in the center of town commemorates the landing here on May 5, 1607, of English settlers. Beginning in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Claremont was a busy port town on the navigable portion of the James River, shipping many goods, but especially hogsheads of tobacco. After the Civil War, Willie Allen, who inherited Claremont Manor, moved to New York and sold the property. J. Frank Mancha, a Maryland real estate developer took on the project to develop, subdivide and colonize a new town there in 1879. Incorporated in 1886, the town of Claremont became the eastern terminus of the new Atlantic and Danville Railway (A&D;), a narrow gauge railroad, which was completed to a point near Emporia called James River Junction, where it connected with a standard gauge track towards Danville. Unfortunately for Claremont, the A&D; decided to connect its western leg with a new eastern terminus in West Norfolk on the harbor of Hampton Roads, and the line to Claremont, which was never standard- gauged, went into semi-abandonment. After some use for lumber transport as the Surry, Sussex and Southampton Railway, the rails were removed in the late 1930s. In the years since, the area has remained as a rural enclave, but some resort use developed along the bluffs and beaches of the James River. Many homes along the riverfront were badly damaged, and Claremont's Sunken Meadow section was destroyed in 2003 by Hurricane Isabel. In 2006, the old A&D; station at Claremont Beach (village, not the wharf) was still standing. Geography Claremont is located at (37.227291, -76.965458).

Sitchin attributed the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Anunnaki, which he stated was a race of extraterrestrials from a planet beyond Neptune called Nibiru. He asserted that Sumerian mythology suggests that this hypothetical planet of Nibiru is in an elongated, 3,600-year-long elliptical orbit around the sun. Sitchin's books have sold millions of copies worldwide and have been translated into more than 25 languages. Sitchin's ideas have been rejected by scientists and academics, who dismiss his work as pseudoscience and pseudohistory. His work has been criticized for flawed methodology and mistranslations of ancient texts as well as for incorrect astronomical and scientific claims. Early life Sitchin was born in Baku, the capital of then Soviet Azerbaijan, and raised in Mandatory Palestine. He received a degree in economics from the University of London, and was an editor and journalist in Mandatory Palestine (which in 1948 became the modern state of Israel), before moving to New York in 1952. While working as an executive for a shipping company, he taught himself Sumerian cuneiform and visited several archaeological sites. Ideas and works Similar to earlier authors such as Immanuel Velikovsky and Erich von D√§niken, Sitchin advocated hypotheses in which extraterrestrial events supposedly played a significant role in ancient human history. According to Sitchin's interpretation of Mesopotamian iconography and symbolism, outlined in his 1976 book The 12th Planet and its sequels, there is an undiscovered planet beyond Neptune that follows a long, elliptical orbit, reaching the inner solar system roughly every 3,600 years. This planet is called Nibiru (although Jupiter was the planet associated with the god Marduk in Babylonian cosmology).Jastrow, Jr., Morris (1911). Aspects of Religious Belief and Practice in Babylonia and Assyria, G.P. Putnam's Sons: New York and London. pp. 217-219. According to Sitchin, Nibiru (whose name was replaced with MARDUK in original legends by the Babylonian ruler of the same name in an attempt to co-opt the creation for himself, leading to some confusion among readers) collided catastrophically with Tiamat (a goddess in the Babylonian creation myth the En√ªma Eli≈°), which he considers to be another planet once located between Mars and Jupiter. This collision supposedly formed the planet Earth, the asteroid belt, and the comets. Sitchin states that when struck by one of planet Nibiru's moons, Tiamat split in two, and then on a second pass Nibiru itself struck the broken fragments and one half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt. The second half, struck again by one of Nibiru's moons, was pushed into a new orbit and became today's planet Earth. Sitchin also speculated that Pluto (which he identifies as both Gaga and Isimud) was originally a satellite of Saturn but Nibiru's gravity perturbed it, sending it to the outer Solar System and giving the body its peculiar orbital path, intersecting the orbit of Neptune.http://www.sitchin.com/Pluto.htm According to Sitchin, Nibiru (called \\"the twelfth planet\\" because, Sitchin claimed, the Sumerians' gods-given conception of the Solar System counted all eight planets, plus Pluto, the Sun and the Moon) was the home of a technologically advanced human-like extraterrestrial race called the Anunnaki in Sumerian myth, who Sitchin states are called the Nephilim in Genesis. He wrote that they evolved after Nibiru entered the solar system, and they first arrived on Earth probably 450,000 years ago, looking for minerals, especially gold, which they found and mined in Africa. Sitchin states that these \\"gods\\" were the rank-and-file workers of the colonial expedition to Earth from planet Nibiru. According to Sitchin, Enki (the Sumerian god of water and human culture) suggested that to relieve the Anunnaki, who had mutinied over their dissatisfaction with their working conditions, that primitive workers (Homo sapiens) be created by genetic engineering as slaves to replace them in the gold mines by crossing extraterrestrial genes with those of Homo erectus. According to Sitchin, ancient inscriptions report that the human civilization in Sumer, Mesopotamia, was set up under the guidance of these \\"gods\\", and human kingship was inaugurated to provide intermediaries between mankind and the Anunnaki (creating the \\"divine right of kings\\" doctrine). Sitchin believes that fallout from nuclear weapons, used during a war between factions of the extraterrestrials, is the \\"evil wind\\" described in the Lament for Ur that destroyed Ur around 2000 BC. Sitchin states the exact year is 2024 BC. Sitchin says that his research coincides with many biblical texts, and that biblical texts come originally from Sumerian writings. Influence Theatrical performance of ENKI by Lorin Morgan-Richards based on the writings of Zecharia Sitchin.Since the release of his first book The 12th Planet in 1976, Sitchin has written seven other books as part of his Earth Chronicles series, as well as six other companion books. Sitchin's books have sold millions of copies worldwide and have been published in more than 25 languages. New York Times reporter Corey Kilgannon has noted that despite academic dismissal of his work, Sitchin has \\"a devoted following of readers\\". Critic Michael S. Heiser has called Sitchin \\"arguably the most important proponent of the ancient astronaut hypothesis over the last several decades\\". Sitchin was a frequent guest on the Coast to Coast AM radio show, which in 2010 presented Sitchin with a lifetime achievement award.Coast to Coast AM - George Noory Presents Zecharia Sitchin with Award , retrieved 15 April 2010 Gods of the New Millennium author Alan F. Alford admits he initially became \\"infatuated\\" with Sitchin's hypotheses but later became a critic of Sitchin's interpretations of myth. According to some writers, Sitchin's ideas, along with those of Erich von D√§niken may have influenced the beliefs of the religious sect of Ra√´lism, and writer Mark Pilkington sees the mythology of Japan's Pana Wave religious group as rooted in Sitchin's The 12th Planet and its sequels. The 1994 movie Stargate, directed by Roland Emmerich, and the 2009 video game The Conduit drew some conceptual inspiration from Sitchin's ideas,Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, 2003, Stargate, Ultimate Edition, MGM DVD while screenwriter Roberto Orci says the villains of the film Cowboys & Aliens were inspired by Sitchin's conceptualization of the Anunnaki as gold-mining aliens. In 2000, Lorin Morgan-Richards' theatrical performance of ENKI, based on the writings of Zecharia Sitchin, premiered in Cleveland, Ohio under the choreography of Michael Medcalf. In 2016, Kazem Finjan, the Iraqi Minister of Transport, claimed at a press conference that Sumerians had built and used an airport in the Dhi Qar Governorate to launch spaceships 5000 years ago. He cited the work of Sitchin and others to support his assertion. Criticisms Criticism of Sitchin's work falls primarily into three categories: translations and interpretations of ancient texts, astronomical and scientific observations, and literalism of myth. Translations and interpretations When Sitchin wrote his books, only specialists could read the Sumerian language. However, sources such as the 2006 book Sumerian Lexicon have made the language more accessible to non-experts. American biblical scholar Michael S. Heiser states he has found many inaccuracies in Sitchin's translations and challenges interested parties to use this book to check their validity.Zechariah Sitchin , Mark Pilkington, Fortean Times, August 2003. Prof. Ronald H. Fritze, author of the book Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo- religions, mentions the example of Sitchin's claim that the Sumerian sign DIƒúIR means \\"pure ones of the blazing rockets\\", adding that \\"Sitchin's assignment of meanings to ancient words is tendentious and frequently strained.\\"Fritze, Ronald H,. (2009). Invented knowledge: false history, fake science and pseudo-religions. Reaktion Books. p. 214. Fritze also commented on Sitchin's methodology, writing that \\"When critics have checked Sitchin's references, they have found that he frequently quotes out of context or truncates his quotes in a way that distorts evidence in order to prove his contentions. Evidence is presented selectively and contradictory evidence is ignored.\\" Sitchin bases his arguments on his personal interpretations of pre- Nubian and Sumerian texts, and the seal VA 243. Sitchin wrote that these ancient civilizations knew of a twelfth planet, when in fact they only knew five. Hundreds of Sumerian astronomical seals and calendars have been decoded and recorded, and the total count of planets on each seal has been five. Seal VA 243 has 12 dots that Sitchin identifies as planets. When translated, seal VA 243 reads \\"You're his Servant\\" which is now thought to be a message from a nobleman to a servant. According to Heiser, the so-called sun on Seal VA 243 is not the Sumerian symbol for the sun but is a star, and the dots are also stars. The symbol on seal VA 243 has no resemblance to the hundreds of documented Sumerian sun symbols. In a 1979 review of The Twelfth Planet, Roger W. Wescott, Professor of Anthropology and Linguistics at Drew University, Madison, New Jersey, noted Sitchin's amateurishness with respect to the primacy of the Sumerian language: Astronomical and scientific observations Sitchin's \\"planetary collision\\" hypothesis does superficially resemble one suggested by modern astronomers‚Äîthe giant impact hypothesis of the Moon's formation about 4.5 billion years ago by a body impacting with the newly formed Earth. However, Sitchin's proposed series of rogue planetary collisions differ in both details and timing. As with Immanuel Velikovsky's earlier Worlds in Collision thesis, Sitchin states that he has found evidence of ancient human knowledge of rogue celestial motions in a variety of mythological accounts. In Velikovsky's case, these interplanetary collisions were supposed to have taken place within the span of human existence, whereas for Sitchin these occurred during the early stages of planetary formation, but entered the mythological account passed down via the alien race which purportedly evolved on Nibiru after these encounters. According to former Immanuel Velikovsky assistant turned prolific critic, C. Leroy Ellenberger, \\"[Sitchin states that] from an equal start, the Nephilim evolved on Nibiru 45 million years ahead of comparable development on Earth with its decidedly more favorable environment. Such an outcome is unlikely, to say the least, since Nibiru would spend over 99% of its time beyond Pluto. Sitchin's explanation that heat from radioactive decay and a thick atmosphere keep Nibiru warm is absurd and does not address the problem of darkness in deep space. Also unexplained is how the Nephilim, who evolved long after Nibiru arrived, knew what happened when Nibiru first entered the solar system.\\" The scenario outlined by Sitchin, with Nibiru returning to the inner solar system regularly every 3,600 years, > ... implies an orbit with a semi-major axis of 235 astronomical units, > extending from the asteroid belt to twelve times farther beyond the sun than > Pluto. Elementary perturbation theory indicates that, under the most > favorable circumstances of avoiding close encounters with other planets, no > body with such an eccentric orbit would keep the same period for two > consecutive passages.

Sitchin in \\"the case of Adam's alien genes\\" states that 223 genes found by the Human Genome Sequencing Consortium are without the required predecessors on the genomic evolutionary tree. Later researchers have argued that the conclusion from the Human Genome Sequencing Consortium cannot be drawn due to a lack of a comprehensive gene database for comparison. An analysis by Salzberg identified 40 potential genes laterally transferred into the genome from prokaryotic organisms.

The population was 297 at the 2000 census. Sculptor Leslie Garland Bolling was born in Dendron, as was mayor of Hopewell, Virginia, Curtis W. Harris. Geography Dendron is located at (37.044516, -76.934737). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 3.6 square miles (9.2 km), all of it land. History Dendron was originally a mill town, built and run by the Surry Lumber Company in to house employees of its sawmill. The village was known as Mussel Fork Village until 1896 when it was renamed \\"Dendron.\\" The name was derived from Œ¥Œ≠ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøŒΩ, the Greek word for tree. The years after 1896 saw rapid growth and expansion of the sawmill and the Town. More people moved to Dendron and additional Company housing built. By 1906, Dendron had a population of 1513 people, 298 dwellings, two hotels, eighteen Company stores and five churches. By 1928, Dendron's population had reached nearly 3,000 people. In addition to those establishments listed above, there was also a post office, two schools, a jail, two banks, two doctors, a skating rink, a movie theater, and a number of non-company owned businesses; such as a drug store, barber shops, garages, cleaning establishments, a pool room, a restaurant, bakery and an ice cream parlor. The company also operated a narrow gauge railroad known as Sussex, Surry and Southampton Railway that transported logs to its sawmill in Dendron, and lumber to its wharf on the James River. It also offered passenger service to Dendron and other small towns along its route. One of its steam locomotives built in 1891 was sold to Argent Lumber company in 1926. It was later bought by Midwest Central Railroad in 1960. Completely restored it is still in operation as Midwest Central Railroad's flagship locomotive. Production peaked in 1920, and the company did not replant after it cut trees. By 1925, most of the area's old growth timber was exhausted. The Surry Lumber Company shut its Dendron sawmills on October 27, 1927. With its major employer gone, the town lost population rapidly, as did nearby Sedley, Vicksville, and Central Hill. The following year, the company began dismantling and selling its equipment and buildings, leaving Dendron without its railroad, water system, nor electricity.Jack Huber, \\"The Surry Lumber Company\\", Virginia Forests available (Winter 2000) at http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~vaschs/SLCfinal.htm In February 1931 a fire swept through what was left of Dendron, destroying twenty-one buildings along Main Street and erasing much of what was left of the once prosperous town. A decade later, the rival Gray Lumber Company of Waverly, which had long replanted its land with pine seedlings, bought 15,000 acres from the nearly defunct Surry Lumber company, and three other companies soon bought most of the remaining acreage in other counties. The company's headquarters in Dendron was razed in 1970, and the former commissary, converted to a store, burned down in 1989. Demographics At the 2000 census there were 297 people, 106 households, and 75 families in the town. The population density was 83.3 people per square mile (32.1/km). There were 121 housing units at an average density of 33.9 per square mile (13.1/km). The racial makeup of the town was 48.82% White and 51.18% African American.

The population was 2,149 at the 2010 census. History Popular legend has it that William Mahone (1826‚Äì1895), builder of the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad (now Norfolk Southern), and his cultured wife, Otelia Butler Mahone (1837‚Äì1911), traveled along the newly completed Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad naming stations. Otelia was reading Ivanhoe, a book written by Sir Walter Scott. From his historical Scottish novels, Otelia chose the place names of Waverly, as well as Windsor and Wakefield. She tapped the Scottish Clan \\"McIvor\\" for the name of Ivor, a small town in neighboring Southampton County. When they could not agree, it is said that they invented a new name in honor of their dispute, which is how the tiny community of Disputanta a few miles west of Waverly was named. The N&P; railroad was completed in 1858. William Mahone became a Major General in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, and later, a Senator in the United States Congress. A large portion of U.S. Route 460 between Petersburg and Suffolk is named in his honor. Waverly is the second largest of the towns Gen. Mahone founded. Waverly has supplied the most state senators and delegate members to the Virginia General Assembly of any Virginia town under 3,000 people.

On February 24, 2016, an EF1 tornado touched down in Waverly, killing three, as verified by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. The storm also caused significant damage to the town. This was all part of a massive storm system that moved rapidly across the region. Lynching of James Jordan One of the last lynchings in Virginia happened in Waverly, on March 18, 1925. The victim, James Jordan, was a black employee at the Gray lumber mill, the town's largest employer, who after being identified by a foremen, had been arrested at the mill and jailed for allegedly attacking a married white woman and stealing a pistol belonging to her husband. Word of the alleged attack spread through Waverly and the surrounding countryside and an armed mob of approximately 500 people had descended on the jail and overcame the sheriff and his deputies, seized Jordan and marched him through the main street in Waverly to the railroad depot where he was strung up a tree and shot multiple times, before his corpse was set on fire in full view of passengers on a Norfolk and Western train that pulled into the station during the macabre proceeding. A coroner's jury convened the next morning only to learn that overnight the body had been stolen and dumped about 25 miles away near the town of Windsorhttp://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/memories-of- lynching-linger-in-waverly/article_fdd4a998-fee4-5339-8b4c-7790f0ce7e49.html The following day, Governor of Virginia, E. Lee Trinkle arrived in Waverly and admonished an assembled group of citizens to preserve order and said he deplored the fact that a mob had taken a human life in town without due process of law. A Richmond Times Dispatch report quoted Trinkle: ‚ÄúVirginia‚Äôs record has been virtually washed clean of mob actions, I exhort you that the name of the Commonwealth not be brought again into the limelight of such publicity as she has received from this occurrence,‚Äù added the governor. Despite the Governor's admonishment, the following week the Waverly newspaper ran an unapologetic editorial complaining about \\"an enormous amount of unfavorable publicity for Sussex County and the town of Waverly in particular, although it is likely that the same thing would have taken place in any other town or county in Virginia under similar provocation and circumstances.‚Äù It continued: ‚ÄúNow that the lynching has taken place and cannot be recalled, it should, and perhaps will, serve as an object lesson to the colored men of the ‚ÄòBlack Belt‚Äô.\\" The negative publicity surrounding the event and the lynching of another black man in the Southwest Virginia town of Wytheville in 1926 ultimately led to the passage of the Virginia Anti-Lynching Law of 1928 by the Virginia General Assembly. Among other provisions, the law gave the state the power to enforce stiff penalties against localities that didn't report vigilante murders. Signed into law by Virginia governor Harry Flood Byrd Sr. on March 14, 1928, this legislation was the first measure in the United States that defined lynching specifically as a state crime.https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Antilynching_Law_of_1928 Geography Waverly is located at (37.033914, ‚àí77.095355).

Later, after coal was discovered and a company was formed to build a railroad to the Pocahontas Coalfields, the community's name was changed again to \\"Graham\\" to honor Col. Thomas Graham, a Philadelphia capitalist. The town was first chartered by the Commonwealth of Virginia as the town of Graham in 1884. The Norfolk and Western railroad chose Bluefield, West Virginia over Graham as the place to build its regional headquarters and main docking yards for the Pocahontas region. As a result, Bluefield, West Virginia grew at a much faster rate than did Graham. Graham operated under that name until a referendum on June 10, 1924, voted to change its name to Bluefield, Virginia. The name change was celebrated in a mock marriage ceremony held in the city park between officials of Bluefield, Virginia, and Bluefield, West Virginia, to celebrate the renaming of Graham. Its community had borders then that are roughly the same as the downtown area alongside the railroad of today's Bluefield, Virginia. Graham continued to hope for development as a major city in the region; it tried to attract a steel refining industry alongside the railyards. The Great Depression of the 1930s caused development in the region to come to a halt. The current Bluefield did not start to expand beyond the downtown area until the 1950s, when it annexed the small town of West Graham, Virginia to the west. It also began to develop land in the more open rural foothills to the south of the city. As the largest town in Tazewell County, Virginia, Bluefield has expanded since the 1990s and the first decade of the new millennium. After a series of devastating floods in the early 21st century, the town has relocated its town council chambers and police department from the flood-prone historic downtown area to the southernmost point in the city at the foot of East River Mountain. The area has been developed with a Wal-Mart, the headquarters of First Community Bank, strip malls, and a medical center operating along U.S. Route 460. Bluefield's most prominent residents are Bill Dudley, an NFL Hall of Famer; New York Giants RB Ahmad Bradshaw; and the widow of actor Lorne Greene, who previously lived in a mansion atop a hill overlooking the Sanders house. This is considered one of the most significant historic homes in the city. The Walter McDonald Sanders House and Alexander St. Clair House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Representation in other media *The town was chosen by Hollywood film producers as the site for the 1994 remake of the classic movie, Lassie. *It has been mentioned by musicians in numerous songs, including Blessed Union of Souls' \\"Oh Virginia\\". Education Educational institutions include Graham High School and Bluefield College. Sports The Bluefield Blue Jays, a Minor League Baseball team, played their home games at Bowen Field, a stadium in the city park that serves both Bluefield and its neighbor of the same name in West Virginia. Although the park is operated by the West Virginia city, the stadium lies entirely within Virginia. In conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball beginning with the 2021 season, the Appalachian League was reorganized as a collegiate summer baseball league, and the Blue Jays were replaced by a new franchise in the revamped league designed for rising college freshman and sophomores. Bluefield College hosts many sports programs, including basketball, soccer, baseball, and now football. Graham High School's football team won the Virginia High School League's Class 2 State Football Championship in 2018. The G-Men defeated Goochland High School 31-9 on December 8 at Salem City Stadium for the state crown. Previous state football titles were won in 1962, 1989, and 1995.

The population was 14,440 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Warren County. Etymology Several theories regarding the origins of the name \\"Front Royal\\" have been suggested. A common theory is that the town was named for a giant oak tree ‚Äì the \\"Royal\\" Tree of England ‚Äì that stood in the public square during colonial days where Chester and Main Streets now join. It was there that the local militia were drilled. During drills, a frequent command given by the drill sergeant was, \\"front the Royal Oak!\\" The command was repeated and eventually shortened to simply \\"Front Royal\\". This theory is supported by a bulletin published by the United States Geological Survey in 1905, which states that the town was first known as Royal Oak, with the current name being derived from the commands of a confused colonel. A second account holds that when local militia were stationed around the town during the American Revolution, the sentry would call out \\"Front\\", to which the required entry password was to respond \\"Royal\\". Eventually their military post became known as \\"Camp Front Royal\\". A third version holds that, in early decades of European settlement, the area was referred to in French as \\"le front royal\\", meaning the British frontier. French settlers, trappers, and explorers in the Ohio Country of the mid-18th century were referring to the land grant made by King Charles II, then in control of Thomas, Lord Fairfax, Baron of Cameron. In English, \\"le front royal\\" is translated to the \\"Royal Frontier\\". The British themselves may have called the area \\"Front Royal\\" after 1763, when they set the so-called Proclamation Line along the spine of the Alleghenies to demarcate the settled portion of the colonies from the Indian Reserve in the interior.  History  The Battle of Front Royal was fought during the US Civil War The entire Shenandoah Valley including the area to become Front Royal was annexed and claimed for hunting by the Iroquois Confederation during the later Beaver Wars, by 1672. Some bands of the Shawnee settled in the area as client groups to the Iroquois and alternately to the Cherokee after 1721. The Iroquois formally sold their entire claim east of the Alleghenies to the Virginia Colony at the Treaty of Lancaster in 1744. Front Royal, originally settled in 1754 under the name LeHewtown, had been known to European explorers as early as the 1670s, and the nearby settlement of Chester's Ferry was in existence by 1736. The town also had a well-known nickname by the 1790s, \\"Helltown,\\" due to the many livestock wranglers and boatmen on the Shenandoah coming through the area, who came into town looking for alcohol. It was incorporated as \\"Front Royal\\" in 1788. Rail service was established in 1854 with the construction of the Alexandria, Orange and Manassas Gap Railroad between Manassas and Riverton. This line was soon extended to Strasburg in time to become a factor in the Battle of Front Royal on May 23, 1862 and throughout the Civil War. Lumber, agriculture, manufacturing and grain mills provided employment in the region for decades after the Civil War.

The population was 8,191 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Washington County. The town encompasses several historically significant sites and features a fine arts and crafts scene centered on the galleries and museums along Main Street.

History View of Abingdon Barter Theatre The region was long the territory of varying cultures of indigenous peoples, including the Chisca and Xualae. From the late 17th-century, it was occupied by the Cherokee Nation, whose territory extended from the present-day area of borders of Tennessee, Virginia, and Kentucky through the spine of North Carolina and later into Georgia. Between 1748 and 1750, Dr. Thomas Walker surveyed the land where the town of Abingdon is situated. It was on the Great Road that Colonel William Byrd III ordered cut through the wilderness on to Kingsport, Tennessee. In 1760, the famed frontiersman Daniel Boone named the area Wolf Hills, after his dogs were attacked by a pack of wolves during a hunting expedition. The site of the attack is on 'Courthouse Hill'. In the twenty-first century, the town sponsored a public art event, in which artists created 27 wolf sculptures, which were installed around the town. Most were later sold at an auction to raise money for Advance Abingdon. Between the years 1765 and 1770 James Douglas, Andrew Colville, George Blackburn, Joseph Black, Samuel Briggs and James Piper settled in and around present-day Abingdon under purchases from Dr. Thomas Walker. During Lord Dunmore's War, Joseph Black built Black's Fort in 1774 to protect local settlers in the region from attacks by the Cherokee of the Lower Towns. It consisted of a log stockade, with a few log cabins inside, where nearby settlers took refuge in event of attack. They retreated to the fort in 1776 when attacked by the war leader Dragging Canoe and his Chickamauga Cherokee forces. Hoping to push out the colonists, the Cherokee had allied with the British in the American Revolutionary War.Carrie Hunter Willis and Etta Belle Walker, 1937, Legends of the Skyline Drive and the Great Valley of Virginia, p. 118-119. The settlement was known as Black's Fort prior to being named Abingdon. Black, Briggs and Walker donated the 120 acres of land upon which the original town was laid out. It was at the intersection of two great Indian trails, which had followed ancient animal migration trails through the mountains. It was a prime location as a trade center and access point to the west and south. In 1776 the community of Black's Fort was made the county seat of the newly formed Washington county. In 1778, Black's Fort was incorporated as the town of Abingdon, said to be named for Abingdon-on-Thames the ancestral home of Martha Washington in Berkshire, England. Possible namesakes for the town include Jake Dore's home in Abington, Pennsylvania, or Lord Abingdon, friend of settler William Campbell.Tennis, Joe.

The population was 1,456 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Kingsport-Bristol (TN)-Bristol (VA) Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City-Kingsport-Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area - commonly known as the \\"Tri-Cities\\" region. History The original name of Glade Spring derives from the Indian word Passawatami which means \\"this is the place\\". According to early records, near the town is a field where Native American tribes held a type of Olympics in the fall, with athletic competitions, dancing and socializing. The Porterfield family, who arrived about 1760, were some of the earliest permanent settlers. During its first years, the town was called Glade Spring Depot to differentiate it from the community centered on Glade Spring Presbyterian Church, two miles to the southwest on the old stage road, now U.S. Route 11. The post office was moved from Old Glade to Glade Spring Depot in 1856 due to the arrival of the railroad. The Civil War slowed its growth, and local men made up a military unit called The Glade Spring Rifles. Federal and Confederate troops passed through the town several times, and cannon emplacements can still be seen just outside Glade Spring on the road to Saltville. Although a few new buildings were constructed before the Civil War, most of the town's growth occurred rapidly in the decade after the war. With the railroad access, Glade Spring turned into a prime shipping yard for produce, livestock and other local goods. An Abingdon newspaper first took note of the \\"stirring, thriving, wide- awake community\\" in 1870. By the time Glade Spring was incorporated in 1875, there were 31 houses (three were brick), six stores, two hotels, and a Masonic Hall. Virginia Intermont College was located in Glade from 1884 to 1892, before it moved to its location until its closure in Bristol. After the passenger train service discontinued, the town's growth slowed, although it still receives freight service from Norfolk Southern railway. The train tracks of the 8.91 \\"Saltville Branch\\", which connected to Saltville via a junction from the main line at Glade Spring, have been removed and replaced with a hiking and biking trail called the \\"Salt Trail\\".

Woods had been jailed in Kentucky for the murder of 29-year-old Herschel Deaton of Coeburn, Virginia, following an altercation on November 27. On the night of the lynching, a crowd estimated between 400-500 surrounded the Kentucky jail Woods was held in and demanded he be released to their custody.

At that time, it was home to about 500 residents. Lynching of Raymond Bird After the Reconstruction era, the majority-white community joined the rest of the state in reasserting white supremacy and Jim Crow rules, which lasted long into the 20th century. In 1926 the last lynching in Virginia took place here, when Raymond Bird, an African- American man, was taken from jail by a large group of white men, after being arrested for having sex with a white woman. He was shot, dragged miles behind a truck, and his dead body hanged from a tree on a county road. He had first been accused of raping Minnie Grubb, daughter of his employer, but she insisted their relationship was consensual and bore his daughter.J. Douglas Smith, Managing White Supremacy: Race, Politics, and Citizenship in Jim Crow Virginia, University of North Carolina Press, 2002 The community refused to tolerate this and killed him three weeks later. The event provoked outrage and national coverage by newspapers. Bird's death was a catalyst for Virginia's passing an anti-lynching law in 1928, largely because of a campaign led by Louis I. Jaff√©, editor of the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot. It was supported by Governor Harry Flood Byrd Sr., who linked the bill to his efforts to attract new businesses to the state.Sterling Giles, \\"Shameful chapter in Virginia history: Lynchings\\", News-Leader, May 16, 2016; Accessed March 15, 2018 Polio epidemic A few cases of polio during the summer of 1950 swelled into an epidemic of hundreds. It was known to cause infantile and even adult paralysis. Of the 5,513 inhabitants of the town,U.S. Department of Commerce, \\"Characteristics of the Population,\\" Census of Population: 1950, vol. 2, part 46 (Washington D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1953) 184 people contracted the disease, resulting in 17 fatalities.J. Robert Anderson, ed., Virginia Health Bulletin 3, no. 12, series 2 (Richmond, VA: Virginia State Department of Health, April 1951) From the beginning of June until the end of August, parents kept children inside, and large gatherings were cancelled to diminish the chance of infection. As the epidemic progressed, ambulances drove victims approximately to Memorial Crippled Children's Hospital in Roanoke, Virginia. Hearses from local funeral homes were used when ambulances were unavailable. African-American patients with polio were repeatedly denied admission to Roanoke's hospital and were forced to drive approximately to St. Philip's Hospital in Richmond, the closest hospital to serve blacks. The Town Council erected billboards at all five entrances to the county, warning potential visitors of the epidemic and urging tourists to return the following year. By the end of the summer, unknown assailants stole or demolished all five billboards. Though the Town Council offered a reward for information, no one came forward. Historic sites The Crockett's Cove Presbyterian Church, Haller-Gibboney Rock House, Loretto, St. John's Episcopal Church, St. John's Lutheran Church and Cemetery, Wythe County Poorhouse Farm, and Wytheville Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography Wytheville is located at (36.947679, ‚àí81.086955). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which (0.14%) is water. Wytheville is an important point on both I-77 and I-81 and lies amidst a wrong-way concurrency of I-77 and I-81. It is located about halfway between Bristol, Tennessee/Virginia and Roanoke. On the I-77 corridor, it is located about halfway between Charleston, West Virginia and Charlotte, North Carolina. The nearby community of Fort Chiswell is the control city for the northbound traffic on I-77 coming from Charlotte, Statesville, Elkin, and Mount Airy, North Carolina. In the near future, Interstate 74 will go through Wytheville in addition to the two other interstates. Wytheville's hot air balloon-themed water tower, inspired by the town's yearly Chautauqua Festival balloon launches, can be seen by I-81 travellers near the I-77 interchange. Due to the confluence of I-77, I-81 and several U.S. Highways, and its location in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Wytheville is known as \\"The Hub of Southwest Virginia\\" and \\"The Crossroads of the Blue Ridge\\".  Climate  Due to its elevation, the climate of Wytheville is either classified as mountain temperate or humid continental (K√∂ppen Cfb or Dfb, respectively), and the town straddles the border between USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 6B and 7A.

It is the county seat of York County, one of the eight original shires formed in colonial Virginia in 1682. Yorktown's population was 195 as of the 2010 census, while York County's population was 66,134 in the 2011 census estimate. The town is most famous as the site of the siege and subsequent surrender of General Charles Cornwallis to General George Washington and the French Fleet during the American Revolutionary War on October 19, 1781. Although the war would last for another year, this British defeat at Yorktown effectively ended the war. Yorktown also figured prominently in the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), serving as a major port to supply both northern and southern towns, depending upon who held Yorktown at the time. Today, Yorktown is one of three sites of the Historic Triangle, which also includes Jamestown and Williamsburg as important colonial-era settlements. It is the eastern terminus of the Colonial Parkway connecting these locations. Yorktown is also the eastern terminus of the TransAmerica Trail, a bicycle touring route created by the Adventure Cycling Association. One of Yorktown's historic sister cities is Zweibr√ºcken in Germany, based on participation of a unit from there during the American Revolutionary War. History Surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781. (Painting by John Trumbull) Yorktown was named for the ancient city of York in Yorkshire, Northern England. It was founded in 1691 as a port on the York River for English colonists to export tobacco to Europe. The lawyer Thomas Ballard was the principal founder of the city along with Joseph Ring.James Branch Cabell, The Majors and Their Marriages, pp. 58-59. It became the county seat in 1696, and although it never had more than about 200 houses its trade was considerable until the American Revolutionary War. It was called \\"York\\" until after the war, when the name \\"Yorktown\\" came into common use. The town reached the height of its development around 1750, when it had 250 to 300 buildings and a population of almost 2,000 people. It was the base of British General Charles Cornwallis during the 1781 siege, which was the last major battle of the American Revolutionary War. When waterways were critical to transportation, Yorktown was thought to occupy a strategic location controlling upstream portions of the York River and its tributaries and their access to the Chesapeake Bay. In his Notes on the State of Virginia published in 1781‚Äì82, Thomas Jefferson noted that the York River at Yorktown \\"affords the best harbour in the state for vessels of the largest size. The river there narrows to the width of a mile, and is contained within very high banks, close under which the vessels may ride.\\" Notes on the State of Virginia The population dropped in Yorktown and other areas of the mostly rural peninsula after the state's capital was relocated from Williamsburg to Richmond on the James River, attracting more development there. In addition, tobacco exhausted the soil, and planters shifted to mixed crops, which required less slave labor. Many generations of younger sons migrated out of the Tidewater area to new lands further west, into the Piedmont and beyond to Kentucky, Tennessee and what became the Northwest Territory. During the 1862 Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), the town was captured by the Union following the Siege and Battle of Yorktown. It was used as a base by the Union Army of the Potomac under General George B. McClellan to launch an attack on Richmond. One of Yorktown's sister cities is Zweibr√ºcken, Germany. During the American Revolutionary War, the Royal Deux- Ponts Regiment was commanded by Comte Christian de Forbach (son of Christian IV, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken, and the deputy commander was his brother Philippe Guillaume (later renamed to Wilhelm). This was one of the four regiments that arrived at Newport, Rhode Island with Rochambeau in 1780. It participated on the side of Americans in the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. The other Yorktown's sister city is Port-Vendres, France. It's from this small port on the Mediterranean coast of France that the French expeditionary force left Europe to go fight the British army in America During World War I, to support Atlantic defenses, the federal government in 1918 acquired about for development by the US Navy as Mine Depot, Yorktown. This large installation straddled York, Warwick and James City counties. It has since expanded and been developed as Naval Weapons Station Yorktown. Cheatham Annex, a facility which was developed over the former town of Penniman, is also included as part of the base. Training Center Yorktown serves as a training school for the United States Coast Guard. Also relatively close to Yorktown are Camp Peary (in York County), the Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News Shipbuilding yards and facilities, and Fort Eustis Army base (both in Newport News). Other major installations in the area are Naval Station Norfolk, located at Norfolk, and Langley Air Force Base in Hampton. Description The Somerwell House (c.1700) on Main Street. In the early 21st century, Yorktown is popular as a destination for heritage tourism. Yorktown has distinct areas. Yorktown Village or Historic Yorktown is located close to the York River, near the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge that spans the river to Gloucester Point. Historic Yorktown is comprised first of Water Street, a small strip along the beach of the river; it contains several small restaurants, a park, a hotel, a pier, and an antiques shop. In May 2005 a building was constructed with more shops and restaurants, enhancing what is known as the \\"Riverwalk\\" section on the waterfront. Next, Main Street is located on a bluff above the floodplain. Architecture in this area is almost exclusively original to the colonial era. Nine buildings, including the circa-1730 Nelson House and Somerwell House (see photo), survive from the pre-Revolutionary period. The old court house, several small shops, the Nelson House, and the Yorktown Monument are located along this road. Around the center of the town are residential streets. Grace Episcopal Church, situated on Church Street near the old courthouse, is noted for its architecture. Honors Monument at Yorktown, celebrating victory in the American Revolutionary War. Installed 1884. Yorktown and the nearby area are significant to the early history of the United States. Colonial National Historical Park, which contains and preserves Yorktown National Battlefield and Yorktown National Cemetery, is located on the outskirts of town. The battlefield has many of the earthworks dug by the besieging American and French forces. The Yorktown Victory Monument ‚Äì commemorating the victory, the alliance with France that brought it about, and the resulting peace with Great Britain after the war - is located just outside the current town. Designed by New York architect Richard Morris Hunt, the monument was installed in 1884 and topped by a figure of Liberty sculpted by John Quincy Adams Ward. That element was destroyed by lightning in 1942. It was replaced in 1957 by a figure of Victory by Oskar J. W. Hansen. A memorial to the French war dead of the Yorktown campaign is being planned for construction at the French cemetery on the site of the battle. Transportation U.S. Route 17, also known as George Washington Memorial Highway, is the primary thoroughfare of Yorktown. It carries traffic via the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge across the York River. York County has grown rapidly, and since the late 20th century, the stretch of U.S. 17 that passes through this area has become a heavily traveled route on which numerous strip malls and commercial areas have been developed. Many of the residential areas of York County branch off Route 17 or are near Interstate 64. Little of the recent residential or business development of York County has occurred close to Yorktown. It is being protected and managed as a historical colonial village, much like Williamsburg, under the guidance of the National Park Service. Yorktown is directly accessible via Colonial Parkway, a two-line, commercial vehicle-free highway that connects with Williamsburg, Jamestown, State Route 199, U.S. Route 60 and Interstate 64.

The population was 564 at the 2010 census, a 3.1% decrease over the preceding census. History Lind was first settled in 1888 on a relatively barren area along the Northern Pacific Railway's main line by the Neilson Brothers, James and Dugal. The site had previously been selected in 1881 for a station (an old boxcar) and section house and was named Lind by the railroad although the exact origin of that name has been lost.Phillips, James W. Washington State Place Names. 8th ed. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1971. One local story has it that the town was named after Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale, who came through the town on the train, but Jenny finished her American tour in 1852 and went to London that year, long before the trainline was built, and died in 1887. Print. In the autumn of 1888 the Neilson Brothers built the first Lind residence and two years later they built and stocked a store and resumed postal service which until then had been processed in Ritzville and tossed off in town by passing trains. James Neilson became the first postmaster. The first school opened in 1889 with six students in attendance. The Neilson Brothers platted the town site on June 7, 1890 which consisted of only four square blocks. The Panic of 1893 would stave off any further development of the town site until the turn of the century. By 1899 the panic was starting to wear off and the local wheat crop, of high quality, was growing in demand. Lind began to expand in size. A new post office and saloon were built and a lumber yard was started and by the end of the year, the population was nearing 100. By the end of 1901, several brick buildings were being constructed for a bank and other stores and hundreds of temporary dwellings were constructed by settlers. A new school and three churches were built. Between 1898 and 1903, Lind grew immensely to a population of about 600 and saw the opening of many more stores, restaurants, a second bank, real estate offices and a newspaper, The Lind Leader. Lind was incorporated on January 26, 1902. Dugal Neilson was elected mayor while his brother James was elected treasurer.An Illustrated History of The Big Bend Country, Embracing Lincoln, Douglas, Adams and Franklin Counties. Spokane, Washington: Western Historical Publishing Company, 1904. Print. The Milwaukee Road would later lay its tracks through the south side of town, which is now the John Wayne Pioneer Trail. When the Neilson brothers platted the town site of Lind, they named all of the north to south streets to eventually spell out their surname. The town only grew large enough to spell \\"Neilso\\". The local Jr./Sr. High School has changed mascots many times some of which are Lind Bulldogs, Lind-Kahlotus Blue Devils, Lind-Ritzville Broncos, and the current Lind-Ritzville-Sprague Broncos which is classified as a 2B school according to the WIAA. Old time rival the Rearden Indians has been kept, but due to the great success with the local football program it has been the very challenging Colfax Bulldogs. Also due to state funding the local high school will move to the nearby town of Ritzville,WA. The middle school will remained at Lind as same with Ritzville.

History The first white settlers in the area were two brothers, Ben and Sam Hutchinson, who built a cabin along the Crab Creek in 1884. An influx of homesteaders began after the start of the 20th century, and a post office was established in 1904. The post office was named Othello after a post office also called Othello in Roane County, Tennessee. The Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railroad ran a track through Adams County in 1907. In 1912, a hotel was built for the railroad workers. That hotel would be later known as the Old Hotel and Art Gallery. The railroad officially platted the town as a stop, with water to feed the boilers of steam trains. They kept the name Othello, and built a railyard and wooden roundhouse there. Although the roundhouse burned in 1919, it was replaced with a brick structure which lasted many years. Businesses and settlers continued to follow, and the town was incorporated May 31, 1910.http://www.othello- wa.us/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=47&Itemid;=77 At the time the railroad was the eastern terminus of the second electrified district of the Milwaukee Road's \\"Pacific Extension\\" route, which extended up to Tacoma, Washington. The Bureau of Reclamation located offices in Othello in 1947, which prevented the decline of this town with the decline of rail shipping after World War II. In the early 1950s, the Columbia Basin Project brought irrigation to the Othello area, increasing both agriculture and commerce. Prior to this, water came only from Crab Creek and from local wells. The water arrived via the Potholes East Canal between Billy Clapp Lake and Scootenay Reservoir in Franklin County. Once there was irrigation available, a land drawing was held in Othello. On May 31, 1952 42 names were drawn (of more than 7000 submitted) for the privilege of purchasing this newly-desirable acreage. From 1951 to 1973, the 637th Radar Squadron operated the Othello Radar Station near the town.http://www.othello- wa.us/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=42&Itemid;=71 In 1958, an ice plant was opened in town to service railroad cars moving produce.

The population was 1,673 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Adams County. The city is part of the Othello, WA Micropolitan Area, which comprises all of Adams County, and is part of the larger Moses Lake-Othello, WA Combined Statistical Area. History The first settler in what would become Ritzville was William McKay in 1880. The town would be named after Phillip Ritz, who had settled in the area two years earlier.Phillips, James W. Washington State Place Names. 8th ed. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1971. Print. By December 1880, Ritzville's town-site had been platted by John W. Sprague on behalf of his company, The Northern Pacific Railway. In 1881, McKay built the first house on the townsite. The Northern Pacific grade was under construction in the vicinity and McKay's home was used as a makeshift hotel for the workers and associated transients. With the railroad came a new wave of settlers to the area. In the summer of 1881, McKay erected the first store and the railroad built a depot nearby, which also served as a hotel, theater and meeting hall. At that time the fledgeling village had a population of around 50 and the school consisted of a lean-to against a house. The town's water supply was the railroad tank because it was not thought that water could be found in the ground. The first religious services were held in Adams County in Ritzville in April 1882 at the McKay Home and the First Congregational Church was soon organized, a church would be built in 1885. The post office was established in 1883 by J.L. Johnson of Walla Walla who also purchased McKay's store. Soon afterwards, many more businesses would set up shop in town. As the 1880s wore on, the town was beginning to realize its position as a major wheat shipping point in the Big Bend Country and it continued to grow. When the town's water supply from the railroad tank began to stretch thin, a search for underground water was initiated. At first, no water was found but a well was finally struck east of the town-site. Most of the land-owners in town agreed to move towards the well, with the exception of a large hotel which couldn't be moved. Water was eventually found at the site and the town was allowed to stay where it was. By 1887, Ritzville had three general merchandise stores, one drug store, one saloon, two blacksmith shops, two lumber yards, two livery stables, one harness shop, two hotels and a large, two-story wooden schoolhouse with an attendance of 100.An Illustrated History of The Big Bend Country, Embracing Lincoln, Douglas, Adams and Franklin Counties. Spokane, Washington: Western Historical Publishing Company, 1904. Print. On June 6, 1888, a fire caused by a defective flue wiped out nearly all of the business section of town. Ritzville had no fire department at the time and its citizens were unable to combat the flames effectively. Rebuilding went underway quickly resulting in the town's first brick building in 1889 built by the town's first mayor, N.H. Greene. It still stands and is currently part of the Ritzville Historic District. Hauling Wheat to Mill, Ritzville c. 1908 Grain elevator, 2014. Wheat remains the key to Ritzville's economy. Following the rebuilding from the fire, Ritzville was incorporated as a town in 1888 and was officially re-incorporated as a city on July 17, 1890 after Washington became a state. The first banking institution, The Adams County Bank (later First National Bank) would follow in April 1891. After another downtown fire in 1894, a waterworks system was installed at a cost of $20,000. The first permanent Adams County courthouse was also built in 1892. After the panic of 1893 had subsided in 1898, Ritzville was experiencing another boom, with demand for property rising and scores of buildings being built. Telephone service was established in August 1899. By the turn of the century, the population had exceeded 1,200. The town finally received a volunteer fire department in 1901, with equipment funded by the citizens. Also in 1901, Ritzville received the title of the greatest wheat shipping point in the world. Between August of that year and August 1902, approximately 1,967,725 bushels of wheat were received in Ritzville warehouses for shipment and 1,990 rail cars of wheat and flour were billed out. These numbers would only be exceeded in 1902. On January 17, 1902, Ritzville was electrified for the first time, run by a steam-powered dynamo. The Chamber of Commerce was formed in 1903 and the following year the courthouse was doubled in size. The city received a Carnegie Library in 1907, the only one in Adams County. It still serves as the town's library today. By the time of The Great Depression, growth had slowed and Ritzville settled in as a small town. In the 1960s Interstate 90 was constructed around the south-end of town, replacing U.S. Route 10 and re- routing US 395 (WA) and its traffic away from downtown. The town's arrested development from then on helped contribute to its charm, helping form The Ritzville Historic District in 1990.

George Bassett, an Iowan settler homesteaded the future site of Washtucna in 1878 with his wife Alice Lancaster Bassett. Their goal was to raise horses, and until 1900 their ranch was the site of an annual roundup of wild horses. In 1882, the first Post Office in Adams County was established with Bassett as postmaster. The post office was taken over by T.C. Martin in 1894 who then opened the first store in Washtucna. The first rail line into the area was completed by the Oregon Improvement Company in 1886, and shipped 30,000 bushels of wheat in its first five years. Several attempts at large-scale irrigation projects were attempted between 1892 and 1917, but all failed. Dry land wheat farming has persisted since that time. Washtucna was officially incorporated on October 27, 1903, with Charles T. Booth as the first mayor.

The population was 5,714 at the 2010 census. History Prosser was long home to Native Americans who lived and fished along the river. They called the area \\"Tap tut\\", meaning rapids. Colonel William Farrand Prosser first surveyed the area in 1879, then claimed homestead in 1882. The Northern Pacific Railroad laid tracks through the area two years later. A town plat was filed by Colonel Prosser in 1885, and in 1886 he was elected Yakima County Auditor. He moved to North Yakima to attend to these duties, and never returned to the town that he founded. Lewis Hinzerling built a flour mill at Prosser falls in 1887, encouraging further settlement of the area. The first irrigation canal was completed in 1893 by the Prosser Falls Land and Irrigation Company. Prosser was officially incorporated in 1899 with a population of 229 people. In 1905, Benton County was carved out of the eastern portions of Yakima and Klickitat Counties. The new town of Prosser was chosen as county seat. In 1907 a power plant was added and began delivering electricity to the town. The following year, a new high school was built, followed a year later by a telephone exchange. In 1910 the city received a grant from the Andrew Carnegie for a public library. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s various companies drilled in this area for oil and natural gas. There were no large findings and the Great Depression put an end to exploration. On November 5, 1912, Benton County voters held a referendum to move the county seat from Prosser to either Kennewick or Benton City. Intense rivalry and war of words between Benton City, Kennewick, and Prosser preceded the vote. Despite getting a majority of the vote, Kennewick did not receive 60 percent of the vote as required by law.http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=7744 To date, Prosser remains the county seat. In 1919, Washington State College (later WSU) established the Irrigation Experiment Station at Prosser. The program's mandate is to study the problems faced by farmers, orchardists, and ranchers in the dry central part of the state. The station originally employed scientists from the college in Pullman, who partnered with scientists from the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The station is still currently in use, and offers a number of agricultural education programs. Prosser at one point had three newspapers, which were consolidated in the 1920s into the Prosser Record-Bulletin, and a permanent courthouse was built in 1926. The Benton County Historical Museum was dedicated in 1968.About the Prosser Record- Bulletin In more recent years, Prosser's location on a major river (the Yakima) and highway access has encouraged a growing wine business and associated tourist industry.

The population was 11,811 at the 2010 census. The city is located within the Tri- Cities metropolitan area, which is centered around the cities of Richland, Kennewick, and Pasco (the Tri-Cities). History West Richland as seen across Yakima from Richland. The original people of the region were the Chemnapum Indians (closely related to the Wanapum tribe), living near the mouth of the Yakima River. Lewis and Clark passed through the area in 1805, and an expedition of the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers headed by Robert E Johnson mapped the Yakima Valley in 1841. In 1853, a road was authorized by Congress to pass through the Yakima valley, and passed through present-day West Richland - but settlement did not really begin until the late 1870s. The first schoolhouse was built in 1896 on the Van Horn Property just south of what is now Van Giesen Street. Benton County was created in 1905, Richland was incorporated in 1906, and the West Richland area was known as 'Lower Yakima'. An irrigation canal from the north side of Horn Rapids Dam was built in 1908 to bring water into Richland. The Yellowstone Trail, a national highway stretching from Albany, New York, to Seattle, was located through the Yakima Valley in 1917 and 1918. It crossed the Fallon Bridge between Richland and West Richland and then proceeded directly west to Kiona. During the 1940s, the city of Richland was built, run and maintained by the War Department for the duration of the Manhattan Project. A number of residents had chafed at the government's regulations, and as a result many of them had moved across the Yakima River, where it was possible to purchase land and own (rather than rent) a house. Carl Heminger purchased some in 1948, and laid out plans for a city. It was proposed that it be named Heminger City (presumably after himself), but in 1949 the townspeople chose the name Enterprise instead. Heminger moved a mile down the road in protest, and platted a small community there called Heminger City. This was eventually incorporated in the West Richland City limits. When the time came in 1955 to incorporate the town, it was decided to rename to West Richland, taking advantage of the already well- known status of nearby Richland. West Richland was officially incorporated on June 17, 1955, combining the two towns of Heminger City and Enterprise. In 2008 West Richland was the location of the speed test for the fastest production car in the world (Aero SSC TT) at over . Geography West Richland is located at (46.292085, -119.354417).

It is part of the Wenatchee-East Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 3,060 at the 2010 census. The population was 3,157 at the 2018 estimates. History=Early people The indigenous people of the area were the Wenatchi people, who were sustained by abundant game and anadromous fish. The Wenatchee River, which runs through Cashmere, was historically home to coho, chinook, and sockeye salmon, as well as steelhead. These wild stocks have been severely impacted by the dams on the Columbia River, although several runs still exist. The Wenatchi people were displaced to the Colville Indian Reservation by the federal government, but still claim some fishing rights in the area.* Marshall, Maureen E. Wenatchee's Dark Past. Wenatchee, Wash: The Wenatchee World, 2008. First Europeans and settlement The first European to enter the Mission Valley was Catholic missionary Father Respari, of the Oblate Fathers, in the 1850s. He lived among the Wenatchi people for twenty years teaching them his religion. He was succeeded in the 1870s by Jesuit missionary Father Urban Grassi who built the St. Francis Xavier Mission in 1873. After the missionaries' departure, the valley was next settled in the 1880s by ranchers and squatters. There were enough settlers in the area to necessitate the construction of a one-room schoolhouse in 1886. This sparse settlement was later known as Old Mission, after the Catholic missions of past. No true town existed until George Kline opened the first store further down the valley in 1888 to serve the burgeoning ranch population. A post office was soon established and Kline was appointed postmaster. The town was named \\"Mission\\" after the early missionaries.An Illustrated History of Stevens, Ferry, Okanogan and Chelan Counties, State of Washington. Spokane, Washington: Western Historical Publishing Company, 1904. Print. Railroad and irrigation In 1892, it was revealed that the Great Northern Railroad would be building its main line through the valley and Mission was platted between the right-of-way and the Wenatchee River in hopes of receiving a station stop on the new line. It did not receive a station at that time and no boom occurred when the railroad came. Not until 1900 did Cashmere become a flag stop and a small section house was built, manned by two employees. This small building was preserved and today exists on the property of the Cashmere Museum and Pioneer Village.\\"Pioneer Village \\" 2006. The Cashmere Museum and Pioneer Village. Retrieved May 13, 2010 The prosperity the railroads brought revived local interest to irrigate the arid valley. In 1892, a stock company was formed with a capital stock of $5000. Local men took out mile contracts to help dig the ditch. At a great personal expense to many involved, the Peshastin Ditch was completed within twelve years. Following its activation, the town as well as the entire area, blossomed. Through the 1900s, Mission grew in earnest. The town was becoming a shipping point for the growing fruit and agricultural industry in the valley. Within several years, better rail passenger service was demanded by citizens and a new, larger depot was built in 1903 and is also still standing in its original place. Renaming of Mission through 1920 By 1903 the town's population had reached over 200. Citing confusion of this town, with another in northern Okanogan County (that no longer exists), that same year, Mission and the entire valley were renamed for Kashmir, as local judge James H. Chase claimed it resembled the foothills of that region.\\"Town Wants New Name\\" Seattle Times 21 March 1904. Pg. 8. The spelling was changed to a more Americanized \\"Cashmere\\".Phillips, James W.

Cashmere was incorporated in 1904 and continued to prosper with the opening of the Mission Canal later that year which turned hundreds of acres of dry-unusable land into fertile farm land.

Nearly 400 people attended a 1924 meeting at the Cashmere Methodist Episcopal Church. A Cashmere band performed in a parade for the 1926 state convention in Wenatchee. In August 1931, a pow wow took place over the course of three days to call attention to the unfulfilled treaty agreements to the Wenatchi people, including the Wenatchupam Fishery, and boost the Cashmere economy. The encampment was composed of tipis on the land of Mary Felix, one of the few Wenatchi people remaining, in Yaksum canyon. It was estimated that nearly 700 Native Americans attended, including 250 Wenatchi who traveled from Colville and Yakama reservations. Notable guests included leaders from other tribes and Governor Roland H. Hartley. Proceeds went to restore the cemetery on the other side of Highway 2.Downtown Cashmere in the 1950s Industries and agriculture The Cashmere area has a rich history of tree fruit production, starting with the first pioneers. With the construction of the Peshastin irrigation ditch in the 1890s, ranches and sagebrush gave away to lush orchards climbing up the walls of the valley. While apples grow very well, the soils and climate are ideal for the production of pears. Bartlett and D'Anjou varieties are well represented. It is said that Cashmere might be the best place to grow pears in the US. Beginning in the 1910s, a number of orchards were opened in Cashmere to take advantage of the area's balmy climate. While many orchards have given way to development, the history of fruit production is still evident in the many orchards and historical fruit warehouses in the area. Overdevelopment is a real threat to the agricultural heritage of the area; the agreeable climate and outstanding scenery attract many people to the area. The history of the area is also tied to timber production. Cashmere was the home of a large sawmill. The first settlers found abundant ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir trees. These timbers were of the highest quality because of the arid climate, which causes the trees to grow very slowly, keeping a tight grain. Geography The Burbank Homestead Waterwheel at the Cashmere Museum is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as is the Blewett Arrastra (a drag-stone for pulverizing ore; not shown), also in the museum.

The population was 3,890 at the 2010 census. The population was 4,222 at 2018 Estimate from Office of Financial Management. It lies on the southeast tip of Lake Chelan, where the lake flows into the Chelan River. Chelan is part of the Wenatchee‚àíEast Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The Chelan area was home to Salish speaking Native Americans known as the Chelan tribe prior to white settlement in the late 1800s. But before the settlers arrived, a new beast, the horse, came and with it just as quickly were smallpox, measles and other deadly infectious diseases. These diseases wiped out an estimated 90% of the Indians before David Thompson, the very first explorer in the area, arrived on the Columbia in 1811. The horse and the culture of the horse so prevalent with Indians of the Plains also took over by the time explorers and settlers arrived, so it is difficult to know what the original inhabitants' lives were truly like and who the Indians were before these monumental changes to their way of life. A people of the horse, though, they quickly became, adopting Plains Indian dress, beadwork, and more, and with white settlers came far more changes. The Indians in the area were organized as small family groups who made decisions, not having a single chief who decided everything. But after white people came there was also a struggle for power: to maintain control of the lands that once were theirs, they needed one person to be able to speak for them. Though not a Chelan Indian himself, Chief Moses (a Shahaptin, not Salish speaker from the Columbia Basin and Okanagan) almost had a large section of land set aside for a reservation. However, with the low number of Indians and the ever-increasing number of miners looking for riches in the mountains, he found that defending his newly acquired territory was impossible and lost it all. During a period of unrest between settlers and Native Americans in the 1870s, Lt. Colonel Henry Clay Merriam of the United States Army established Camp Chelan at the foot of Lake Chelan to control and safeguard the Indian population on the Moses Columbia Reservation. His family was with him for the 1880 Federal Census. The lake was largely inaccessible because of its sheer cliffs on most sides, so a makeshift road was built from the fort to the Columbia River where a courier and mail service from Walla Walla were established. The fort operated for about a year and was abandoned in October 1880 when the troops relocated to Fort Spokane. The first European settlers in the area were William Sanders (one of main streets in Chelan is named after him) and Henry Dumpke, who arrived in 1886. After traversing several cliffs and streams and losing their horse, they safely arrived at the foot of the lake and were welcomed by the natives who encouraged them to stake claims. The presence of these settlers paved the way for more settlers to move to the valley. In 1888, L.H. Woodin of Minneapolis arrived in the valley and paddled up the lake in a skiff. Impressed by the area, Woodin constructed a sawmill at the foot of the lake. Chelan's main street is named for Woodin. At the same time, local ranchers were beginning to discover that orchards could be planted without the need of irrigation. The town was platted and lots sold quickly. A post office was established in 1890. A school was built in 1892 followed by the first resort hotel, taking advantage of the area's natural beauty. Following the Panic of 1893, hard times began in earnest but never affected Chelan completely. The first bank was established in 1893. Chelan was officially incorporated on May 7, 1902. In 1903, the city gained electric lights and water service via nearby Donaldson Springs. A permanent town hall was constructed in 1904 (but was destroyed by fire in 1927). The town continues to grow as an agricultural center and resort community which helps it thrive to this day. Geography Chelan is located at (47.842858, -120.021312). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Climate Chelan's climate is typical for Eastern Washington.

It is part of the Wenatchee‚àíEast Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,965 at the 2010 census. The entire town center is modeled on a Bavarian village as part of a civic initiative that began in the 1960s. The area is a major, four-season tourist destination with festivals nearly every month and a multitude of events year round. History The construction of the Great Northern Railway through Tumwater Canyon in 1892 brought settlers to a townsite that was named \\"Leavenworth\\". Lafayette Lamb arrived in 1903 from Clinton, Iowa, to build the second largest sawmill in Washington state. Leavenworth was officially incorporated on September 5, 1906. A small timber community, it became a regional office of the Great Northern Railway in the early 1900s. The railroad relocated to Wenatchee in 1925, greatly affecting Leavenworth's economy. The city's population declined well into the 1950s as the lumber mills closed and stores relocated. The city looked to tourism and recreation as a major economy as early as 1929, when they opened a ski jump. In 1962, the Project LIFE (Leavenworth Improvement For Everyone) Committee was formed in partnership with the University of Washington to investigate strategies to revitalize the struggling logging town. The theme town idea was created by two Seattle businessmen, Ted Price and Bob Rodgers, who had bought a failing cafe on Highway 2 in 1960. Price was chair of the Project LIFE tourism subcommittee, and in 1965 the pair led a trip to a Danish-themed town, Solvang, California, to build support for the idea. The first building to be remodeled in the Bavarian style was the Chikamin Hotel, which owner Jamie Peterson renamed the Edelweiss after the state flower of Bavaria. Leavenworth is home to the Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum, which opened in 1995 and contains more than 5,000 nutcrackers dating from prehistoric to modern. Leavenworth hosts an annual Oktoberfest celebration. Leavenworth's transformation into a theme town was inspired, and assisted, by Solvang, California. Later, the Washington town of Winthrop followed Leavenworth's example and adopted a Western town theme. In November 2007, Good Morning America went to Leavenworth for Holiday Gifts for the Globe where GMA helped light up the town for the Christmas Holiday. Leavenworth was named the Ultimate Holiday Town USA by A&E; Network. Geography Bavarian Ritz Hotel Downtown Leavenworth, below, as viewed from the adjacent Tumwater Mountain on an August afternoon According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Geology Leavenworth sits on the southeast side of the North Cascades collage, which is a group of terranes that accreted to North America all about the same time. Marine fossils indicate that the terranes were probably a group of islands originating in the South Pacific hundreds of million years ago. The terranes arrived at North America about 90 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous period. When they smashed into their new home, they were a puzzle of north‚Äìsouth slices. As accretion continued, they were cut into horizontal (east-west) slices. During the Eocene epoch, about 50 million years ago, the area was once again cut into vertical slices, creating among others, the Leavenworth fault and the Entiat fault. In between these two faults the Chiwaukum graben was created. This graben is about 12 miles wide and trends northwest from Wenatchee for about 50 miles. As the graben dropped, it began to fill with clastic sediment from the surrounding hills, creating the Chumstick formation. About 30 million years ago in the Oligocene epoch, the Chiwaukum graben underwent compressional deformation creating several folds in the region that are visible today. Leavenworth is on the western edge of the graben; in fact, the Leavenworth fault runs through the western edge of town. The area to the west and southwest of Leavenworth was created in the middle Cretaceous period with the uplift of the Mt. Stuart batholith, forming the granite rock seen today in Icicle Ridge and Tumwater Mountain. During the Pleistocene and into the Holocene epochs, an alpine glacier originating from the southwest in the Mount Stuart range made its way to where the town is today. Leavenworth sits on the terminal moraine of that glacier. The residential parts of town display many glacial erratics that originated 20 miles up the Icicle Valley near Mount Stuart. About 19,000 years ago, a large rock slide dammed the Columbia River near Rock Island, just south of Wenatchee. The temporary dam, in conjunction with one of the Lake Missoula floods, caused the water to flow back up the Wenatchee Valley, where it was stopped by the glacier at Leavenworth. As the leading edge of the glacier interacted with the flood, ice rafts formed carrying granite erratics from the Stuart batholith, which ended up in the town of Dryden about 15 miles down the valley from Leavenworth. As the glacier retreated, the south side of Leavenworth was a lake dammed up by the moraine. The bridge on the east side of town is a good vantage point to see where the Wenatchee River cuts through the moraine today. Climate Leavenworth has a continental Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen Dsb) with summers characterized by hot, sunny days and chilly nights, and cold, snowy winters. During the summer, the weather is typically anticyclonic due to the presence of the North Pacific anticyclone, with resultant clear skies and large diurnal temperature ranges. Rainfall is limited by the Cascade rain shadow as well as by the anticyclone, and all months from May to October have recorded zero precipitation on occasions, including 114 consecutive days without precipitation from June to October 2003. When a continental flow enters the Columbia Basin, the temperature can be very hot during the day, with the hottest temperature being during the heatwave of July 1941. However, on cooler, stiller days, summer nights can still be cold and frosts have been recorded as early as August 29 in 1980. The fall months have steady cooling and a gradual increase in the frequency of frontal storms producing rainfall, whilst winter weather is typically cold and snowy, with an annual mean snowfall of and a maximum monthly total of recorded in December 1996. The snowiest season has been from July 1968 to June 1969 with and the least snowy from July 1962 to June 1963 when just of snow fell. The lowest temperature recorded in Leavenworth was on December 30, 1968, but typically five mornings per year will fall at or below . The wettest \\"rain year\\" was recorded from July 1955 to June 1956 with a total of and the driest was from July 1929 to June 1930 with .

It involved a large-scale repression of wealthy peasants (kulaks); genocidal acts against ethnic minorities; a purge of the Communist Party, government officials, and the Red Army leadership; widespread police surveillance; suspicion of saboteurs; counter-revolutionaries; imprisonment; and arbitrary executions. Historians estimate the total number of deaths due to Stalinist repression in 1937‚Äì38 to be between 680,000 and 1,200,000. The \\"Kulak Operation\\" and the targeting of national minorities were the main components of the Great Terror. Together these two actions accounted for nine-tenths of the death sentences and three-fourths of Gulag prison camp sentences. Of the operations against national minorities, the Polish Operation of the NKVD was the largest one, second only to the \\"Kulak Operation\\" in terms of the number of victims. According to historian Timothy Snyder, ethnic Poles constituted the largest group of victims in the Great Terror, comprising less than 0.5% of the country's population but comprising 12.5% of those executed.Snyder, Timothy. 2010.

Conquest's title itself was an allusion to the period from the French Revolution known as the Reign of Terror (French: la Terreur, \\"the Terror\\"; from June to July 1794: la Grande Terreur, 'the Great Terror'). While Norman Naimark deemed Stalin's 1930s Polish policy \\"genocidal\\", he did not consider the entire Great Purge genocidal because it also targeted political opponents. Introduction Excerpt of NKVD Order No. 00447 Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, and Chubar. The term repression was officially used to describe the prosecution of people considered counter- revolutionaries and enemies of the people by the leader of the Soviet Union at the time, Joseph Stalin. Historians debate the causes of the purge, such as Stalin's paranoia, or his desire to remove dissenters from the Communist Party or to consolidate his authority. The purges began in the Red Army, and the techniques developed there were quickly adapted to purges in other sectors.Whitewood, Peter. 2015. \\"The Purge of the Red Army and the Soviet Mass Operations, 1937‚Äì38.\\" Slavonic & East European Review 93(2)) 286‚Äì314. Most public attention was focused on the purge of certain parts of the leadership of the Communist Party, as well as of government bureaucrats and leaders of the armed forces, most of whom were Party members. The campaigns also affected many other categories of the society: intelligentsia, peasants‚Äîespecially those lending out money or wealth (kulaks)‚Äîand professionals. A series of NKVD operations affected a number of national minorities, accused of being \\"fifth- column\\" communities. A number of purges were officially explained as an elimination of the possibilities of sabotage and espionage, by the Polish Military Organisation and, consequently, many victims of the purge were ordinary Soviet citizens of Polish origin. According to Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 speech, \\"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\\", and to historian Robert Conquest, a great number of accusations, notably those presented at the Moscow show trials, were based on forced confessions, often obtained through torture, and on loose interpretations of Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code, which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal process, as defined by Soviet law in force at the time, was often largely replaced with summary proceedings by NKVD troikas. Hundreds of thousands of victims were accused of various political crimes (espionage, wrecking, sabotage, anti-Soviet agitation, conspiracies to prepare uprisings and coups); they were quickly executed by shooting, or sent to the Gulag labor camps. Many died at the penal labor camps of starvation, disease, exposure, and overwork. Other methods of dispatching victims were used on an experimental basis. In Moscow, the use of gas vans used to kill the victims during their transportation to the Butovo firing range was documented.This information was published first in 1990 in a Komsomolskaya Pravda article (October 28, 1990, p. 2).

The Great Purge began under NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda, but reached its peak between September 1936 and August 1938 under the leadership of Nikolai Yezhov, hence the name Yezhovshchina. The campaigns were carried out according to the general line, often by direct orders of the Party Politburo headed by Stalin. Background From 1930 onwards, the Party and police officials feared the \\"social disorder\\" caused by the upheavals of forced collectivization of peasants and the resulting famine of 1932‚Äì1933, as well as the massive and uncontrolled migration of millions of peasants into cities. The threat of war heightened Stalin's perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. He began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical \\"fifth column of wreckers, terrorists and spies.\\"Hagenloh, Paul. 2000. \\"Socially Harmful Elements and the Great Terror.\\" Pp. 286‚Äì307 in Stalinism: New Directions, edited by S. Fitzpatrick. London: Routledge.Shearer, David. 2003. \\"Social Disorder, Mass Repression and the NKVD During the 1930s.\\" Pp. 85‚Äì117 in Stalin‚Äôs Terror: High Politics and Mass Repression in the Soviet Union, edited by B. McLaughlin and K. McDermott. Basingstoke: Palgrave MacMillan. Leon Trotsky, in 1929, shortly before being driven out of the Soviet Union. The term \\"purge\\" in Soviet political slang was an abbreviation of the expression purge of the Party ranks. In 1933, for example, the Party expelled some 400,000 people. But from 1936 until 1953, the term changed its meaning, because being expelled from the Party came to mean almost certain arrest, imprisonment, and often execution. The political purge was primarily an effort by Stalin to eliminate challenge from past and potential opposition groups, including the left and right wings led by Leon Trotsky and Nikolai Bukharin, respectively. Following the Civil War and reconstruction of the Soviet economy in the late 1920s, veteran Bolsheviks no longer thought necessary the \\"temporary\\" wartime dictatorship, which had passed from Lenin to Stalin. Stalin's opponents on both sides of the political spectrum chided him as undemocratic and lax on bureaucratic corruption. This opposition to current leadership may have accumulated substantial support among the working class by attacking the privileges and luxuries the state offered to its high-paid elite. The Ryutin Affair seemed to vindicate Stalin's suspicions. He enforced a ban on party factions and banned those party members who had opposed him, effectively ending democratic centralism. In the new form of Party organization, the Politburo, and Stalin in particular, were the sole dispensers of ideology. This required the elimination of all Marxists with different views, especially those among the prestigious \\"old guard\\" of revolutionaries. As the purges began, the government (through the NKVD) shot Bolshevik heroes, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky and B√©la Kun, as well as the majority of Lenin's Politburo, for disagreements in policy. The NKVD attacked the supporters, friends, and family of these \\"heretical\\" Marxists, whether they lived in Russia or not. The NKVD nearly annihilated Trotsky's family before killing him in Mexico; the NKVD agent Ram√≥n Mercader was part of an assassination task force put together by Special Agent Pavel Sudoplatov, under the personal orders of Stalin. Leningrad party leader Sergei Kirov with Stalin (and his daughter Svetlana) in 1934. In 1934, Stalin used the murder of Sergey Kirov as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, in which about a million people perished (see ). Some later historians came to believe that Stalin arranged the murder, or at least that there was sufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion. Kirov was a staunch Stalin loyalist, but Stalin may have viewed him as a potential rival because of his emerging popularity among the moderates. The 1934 Party Congress elected Kirov to the central committee with only three votes against, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received 292 votes against. After Kirov's assassination, the NKVD charged the former oppositionists, an ever-growing group according to their determination, with Kirov's murder as well as a growing list of other offences, including treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage. Another justification for the purge was to remove any possible \\"fifth column\\" in case of a war. Vyacheslav Molotov and Lazar Kaganovich, participants in the repression as members of the Politburo, maintained this justification throughout the purge; they each signed many death lists. Stalin believed war was imminent, threatened both by an explicitly hostile Germany and an expansionist Japan. The Soviet press portrayed the country as threatened from within by fascist spies. From the October Revolution onward,Robert Gellately, Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe, 2007, Knopf, 720 pages. Lenin had used repression against perceived enemies of the Bolsheviks as a systematic method of instilling fear and facilitating social control, especially during the campaign commonly referred to as the Red Terror. This policy continued and intensified under Stalin, periods of heightened repression including the deportation of kulaks who opposed collectivization, and a severe famine in Ukraine. Lev Kopelev wrote, \\"In Ukraine 1937 began in 1933,\\" referring to the comparatively early beginning of the Soviet crackdown in Ukraine. A distinctive feature of the Great Purge was that, for the first time, members of the ruling party were included on a massive scale as victims of the repression. Due to the scale of the terror, the substantial victims of the purges were Communist Party members and office-holders. The purge of the Party was accompanied by the purge of the whole society. The following events are used for the demarcation of the period. *1936, the first Moscow Trial. *1937, introduction of NKVD troikas for implementation of \\"revolutionary justice.\\" *1937, passage of Article 58-14 about \\"counter-revolutionary sabotage.\\" Moscow Trials=First and Second Moscow Trials Bolshevik revolutionaries Leon Trotsky, Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev Between 1936 and 1938, three very large Moscow Trials of former senior Communist Party leaders were held, in which they were accused of conspiring with fascist and capitalist powers to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the Soviet Union and restore capitalism. These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by the spectacle of Lenin's closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences. *The first trial was of 16 members of the so- called \\"Trotskyite-Kamenevite-Zinovievite-Leftist-Counter-Revolutionary Bloc,\\" held in August 1936,Rogovin (1998), pp. 17‚Äì18 at which the chief defendants were Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, two of the most prominent former party leaders. Among other accusations, they were incriminated with the assassination of Kirov and plotting to kill Stalin. After confessing to the charges, all were sentenced to death and executed.Rogovin (1998), pp. 36‚Äì38 *The second trial in January 1937 involved 17 lesser figures known as the \\"anti-Soviet Trotskyite-centre\\" which included Karl Radek, Yuri Piatakov and Grigory Sokolnikov, and were accused of plotting with Trotsky, who was said to be conspiring with Germany. Thirteen of the defendants were eventually executed by shooting. The rest received sentences in labor camps where they soon died. *There was also a secret trial before a military tribunal of a group of Red Army commanders, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky, in June 1937. Prosecutor General Andrey Vyshinsky (centre), reading the 1937 indictment against Karl Radek during the 2nd Moscow Trial Some Western observers who attended the trials said that they were fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established. They based this assessment on the confessions of the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or drugging. The British lawyer and Member of Parliament D.N. Pritt, for example, wrote: \\"Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties,\\" but \\"once again we can feel confident that when the smoke has rolled away from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted.\\" It is now known that the confessions were given only after great psychological pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former OGPU officer Alexander Orlov and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, Kamenev's teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion. Zinoviev and Kamenev demanded, as a condition for \\"confessing\\", a direct guarantee from the Politburo that their lives and that of their families and followers would be spared. This offer was accepted, but when they were taken to the alleged Politburo meeting, only Stalin, Kliment Voroshilov, and Yezhov were present. Stalin claimed that they were the \\"commission\\" authorized by the Politburo and gave assurances that death sentences would not be carried out. After the trial, Stalin not only broke his promise to spare the defendants, he had most of their relatives arrested and shot. =Dewey Commission= The chief executioner of the NKVD, Vasili Blokhin, carried out some of the high-profile executions during the purges.Snyder, Timothy. Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin. Basic Books, 2010. p. 137 In May 1937, the Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials, commonly known as the Dewey Commission, was set up in the United States by supporters of Trotsky, to establish the truth about the trials. The commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and educator John Dewey. Although the hearings were obviously conducted with a view to proving Trotsky's innocence, they brought to light evidence which established that some of the specific charges made at the trials could not be true. For example, Georgy Pyatakov testified that he had flown to Oslo in December 1935 to \\"receive terrorist instructions\\" from Trotsky. The Dewey Commission established that no such flight had taken place. Another defendant, Ivan Smirnov, confessed to taking part in the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, at a time when he had already been in prison for a year. The Dewey Commission later published its findings in a 422-page book titled Not Guilty. Its conclusions asserted the innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its summary, the commission wrote: The commission concluded: \\"We therefore find the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups.\\" =Implication of the Rightists= In the second trial, Karl Radek testified that there was a \\"third organization separate from the cadres which had passed through [Trotsky's] school,\\"British Embassy Report: Viscount Chilston to Mr. Eden, 6 February 1937 as well as \\"semi-Trotskyites, quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing with us, people who from liberalism, from a Fronde against the Party, gave us this help.\\" By the \\"third organization,\\" he meant the last remaining former opposition group called the Rightists, led by Bukharin, whom he implicated by saying: Third Moscow Trial NKVD chiefs responsible for conducting mass repressions (left to right): Yakov Agranov; Genrikh Yagoda; unknown; Stanislav Redens. All three were themselves eventually arrested and executed. The third and final trial, in March 1938, known as The Trial of the Twenty-One, is the most famous of the Soviet show trials, because of persons involved and the scope of charges which tied together all loose threads from earlier trials. Meant to be the culmination of previous trials, it included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the so-called \\"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\\", led by Nikolai Bukharin, the former chairman of the Communist International, former premier Alexei Rykov, Christian Rakovsky, Nikolai Krestinsky and Genrikh Yagoda, recently disgraced head of the NKVD. The fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed at which the purges were consuming their own. It was now alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder Maxim Gorky by poison, partition the U.S.S.R and hand her territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other preposterous charges. Even previously sympathetic observers who had stomached the earlier trials found it harder to swallow these new allegations as they became ever more absurd, and the purge expanded to include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin and Kalinin. No other crime of the Stalin years so captivated Western intellectuals as the trial and execution of Bukharin, who was a Marxist theorist of international standing.Corey Robin, \\"Fear\\", Page 96 For some prominent communists such as Bertram Wolfe, Jay Lovestone, Arthur Koestler, and Heinrich Brandler, the Bukharin trial marked their final break with communism, and even turned the first three into fervent anti-Communists eventually.Bertram David Wolfe, \\"Breaking with communism\\", p. 10 To them, Bukharin's confession symbolized the depredations of communism, which not only destroyed its sons but also conscripted them in self-destruction and individual abnegation. The preparation for this trial, which took over a year, was delayed in its early stages due to the reluctance of some party members to denounce their comrades. It was at this time that Stalin personally intervened to speed up the process and replaced Yagoda with Yezhov. =Bukharin's confession= Nikolai Bukharin, Russian Bolshevik revolutionary executed in 1938 On the first day of trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he repudiated his written confession and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after \\"special measures\\", which dislocated his left shoulder among other things. Anastas Mikoyan and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his interrogators were given the order \\"beating permitted\\", and were under great pressure to extract confession out of the \\"star\\" defendant. Bukharin initially held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with \\"methods of physical influence\\" wore him down. But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators. Bukharin's confession in particular became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler's acclaimed novel Darkness at Noon and philosophical essay by Maurice Merleau-Ponty in Humanism and Terror. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to \\"sum total of crimes\\", he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in written confession and refuse to go any further. The result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions (of being a \\"degenerate fascist\\" working for \\"restoration of capitalism\\") and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him, one observer noted that Bukharin \\"proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily demolish the whole case.\\"Report by Viscount Chilston (British ambassador) to Viscount Halifax, No.141, Moscow, 21 March 1938 He continued by saying that \\"the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence\\" in a trial that was solely based on confessions. He finished his last plea with the words:Tucker, Robert. \\"Block of Rights and Trotskyites.\\" Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet. pp. 667‚Äì68. > [T]he monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage > of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and > may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all. Romain Rolland and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed except Rakovsky and two others (who were killed in NKVD prisoner massacres in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin's wife, Anna Larina, was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband posthumously rehabilitated a half-century later by the Soviet state under Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988. \\"Ex-kulaks\\" and other \\"anti-Soviet elements\\" On 2 July 1937, Stalin sent a top-secret letter to all regional Party chiefs (with a copy to NKVD regional chiefs) ordering them to present, within five days, estimates of the number of kulaks and \\"criminals\\" that should be arrested, executed, or sent to camps. Produced in a matter of days, these figures roughly matched those of \\"suspect\\" individuals already under police surveillance, although the criteria used to distribute the \\"kulak and criminal elements\\" among the two categories are not clear. On 30 July 1937 the NKVD Order no. 00447 was issued, directed against \\"ex-kulaks\\" and other \\"anti-Soviet elements\\" (such as former officials of the Tsarist regime, former members of political parties other than the communist party, etc.). They were to be executed or sent to Gulag prison camps extrajudicially, under the decisions of NKVD troikas. The following categories appear to have been on index-cards, catalogues of suspects assembled over the years by the NKVD and were systematically tracked down: \\"ex-kulaks\\" previously deported to \\"special settlements\\" in inhospitable parts of the country (Siberia, Urals, Kazakhstan, Far North), former tsarist civil servants, former officers of the White Army, participants in peasant rebellions, members of the clergy, persons deprived of voting rights, former members of non-Bolshevik parties, ordinary criminals, like thieves, known to the police and various other \\"socially harmful elements\\". However, many were also arrested at random in police sweeps, or as a result of denunciations or simply because they happened to be relatives, friends or just acquaintances of people already arrested. Many railwaymen, workers, kolkhoz peasants, and engineers were arrested in the course of the \\"Kulak Operation\\" just because they had the misfortune of working in, or near, important strategic factories, railway or building sites, where, as a result of frantic rhythms and plans, many work accidents had occurred in previous years. In 1937‚Äì1938, the NKVD reopened these cases and systematically ascribed them to \\"sabotage\\" or \\"wrecking.\\"Werh, Nicolas. 2009. L‚Äôivrogne et la marchande de fleurs. Autopsie d‚Äôun meurtre de masse, 1937-1938. Paris: Tallandier. Yevgeny-Ludvig Karlovich Miller, one of the remaining leaders of the White movement, was kidnapped by the NKVD in 1937 and executed 19 months later. The Orthodox clergy, including active parishioners, was nearly annihilated: 85% of the 35,000 members of the clergy were arrested. Particularly vulnerable to repression were also the so-called \\"special settlers\\" (spetzpereselentsy) who were under permanent police surveillance and constituted a huge pool of potential \\"enemies\\" to draw on. At least 100,000 of them were arrested in the course of the Great Terror. Common criminals such as thieves, \\"violators of the passport regime\\", etc. were also dealt with in a summary way. In Moscow, for example, nearly one third of the 20,765 persons executed on the Butovo firing range were charged with a non- political criminal offence. As soon as the Kulak Operation was launched (5 August 1937), regional party and NKVD bosses, eager to show their zeal, demanded an increase in the quotas. Accordingly, the quotas were increased. But this was not only the result of demands from below. The largest new allowances were distributed by Stalin and Yezhov on their own initiative: on 15 October 1937, for example, the Politburo passed a secret resolution increasing the number of people \\"to be repressed\\" by 120,000 (63,000 \\"in the first category\\" and 57,000 \\"in the second category\\"); on 31 January 1938, Stalin ordered a further increase of 57,200, 48,000 of whom were to be executed. The police organized sweeps and round-ups of markets or railway stations where marginals and other social outcasts were likely to be found. To carry out a growing number of arrests, the State Security personnel of NKVD ‚Äì approximately 25,000 officers ‚Äì were supplemented by ordinary policemen, sometimes by civilian Party or Komsomol (Young Communist League) members. Every NKVD local unit had a \\"casework minimum\\" of arrests to perform, and also of confessions to extract to \\"unmask conspiracies\\". The NKVD used uninterrupted interrogation for days on end and merciless beatings to force prisoners to confess their alleged \\"counter-revolutionary\\" crimes. To speed up the procedure, prisoners were often even forced to sign blank pages of the pre-printed interrogation folios on which the interrogator later typed up the confession. After the interrogations the files were submitted to NKVD troikas, which pronounced the verdicts in the absence of the accused. During a half- day-long session a troika went through several hundred cases, delivering either a death sentence or a sentence to the Gulag labor camps. Death sentences were immediately enforceable. The executions were carried out at night, either in prisons or in secluded areas run by the NKVD and located as a rule on the outskirts of major cities.Nicolas WerthCase Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n¬∞ 00447 (August 1937 ‚Äì November 1938)Nicolas WerthCase Study:The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n¬∞ 00447 (August 1937 ‚Äì November 1938) The \\"Kulak Operation\\" was largest single campaign of repression in 1937‚Äì38, with 669,929 people arrested and 376,202 executed, more than half the total of known executions. Campaigns targeting nationalities Israil Pliner; (1896‚Äì1939) chief of Gulag NKVD (1937‚Äì1938), later arrested and executed A series of mass operations of the NKVD was carried out from 1937 through 1938 until the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 targeting specific nationalities within the Soviet Union, based on NKVD directives against the so-called diversionist element, according to the notion of the \\"hostile capitalist surrounding\\" as defined by Nikolai Yezhov. The Polish operation of the NKVD was the largest of this kind. The Polish operation claimed the largest number of the NKVD victims: 143,810 arrests and 111,091 executions according to records. Snyder estimates that at least eighty-five thousand of them were ethnic Poles. The remainder were 'suspected' of being Polish, without further inquiry. Poles comprised 12.5% of those who were killed during the Great Terror, while comprising only 0.4% of the population. Overall, national minorities targeted in these campaigns composed 36% of the victims of the Great Purge, despite being only 1.6% of the Soviet Union's population; 74% of ethnic minorities arrested during the Great Purge were executed while those sentenced during the Kulak Operation only had a 50% chance of being executed, (though this may have been due to the Gulag camp's lack of space in the late stages of The Purge rather than deliberate discrimination in sentencing.). The wives and children of those arrested and executed were dealt with by the NKVD Order No. 00486. The women were sentenced to forced labour for 5 or 10 years. Their minor children were put in orphanages. All possessions were confiscated. Extended families were purposely left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well, affecting up to 200,000‚Äì250,000 people of Polish background depending on the size of their families. The NKVD national operations were conducted on a quota system using album procedure. The officials were mandated to arrest and execute a specific number of so-called \\"counter-revolutionaries\\", compiled by administration using various statistics but also telephone books with names sounding non-Russian. The Polish operation served as a model for a series of similar NKVD secret decrees targeting a number of the Soviet Union's diaspora nationalities: the Finnish, Latvian, Estonian, Romanian, Greek, and Chinese. Concerning diaspora minorities, the vast majority of whom were Soviet citizens and whose ancestors had resided for decades and sometimes centuries in the Soviet Union and Russian Empire, \\"this designation absolutized their cross-border ethnicities as the only salient aspect of their identity, sufficient proof of their disloyalty and sufficient justification for their arrest and execution\\" (Martin, 2001: 338).The NKVD Mass Secret National Operations (August 1937 ‚Äì November 1938) Several historians have called the National Operations of the NKVD genocidal.The Crime of Genocide Committed against the Poles by the USSR before and during World War II:An International Legal Study by Karol Karski, Cas eWestern Reserve Journal of International Law, Vol. 45, 2013Martin, Terry. \\"The origins of Soviet ethnic cleansing.\\" The Journal of Modern History 70.4 (1998): 813-861.Genocide: A World History, Norman M. NaimarkNorman Naimark called Stalin's policy towards Poles in the 1930s \\"genocidal;\\" however he doesn't consider the Great Purge entirely genocidal because it also targeted political opponents. Purge of the army Marshals of the Soviet Union in November 1935. (l-r): Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Semyon Budyonny, Kliment Voroshilov, Vasily Blyukher, Aleksandr Yegorov. Only Voroshilov and Budyonny survived the Great Purge. The purge of the Red Army and Military Maritime Fleet removed three of five marshals (then equivalent to four-star generals), 13 of 15 army commanders (then equivalent to three-star generals), eight of nine admirals (the purge fell heavily on the Navy, who were suspected of exploiting their opportunities for foreign contacts), 50 of 57 army corps commanders, 154 out of 186 division commanders, 16 of 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars. At first it was thought 25‚Äì50% of Red Army officers had been purged; the true figure is now known to be in the area of 3.7‚Äì7.7%. This discrepancy was the result of a systematic underestimation of the true size of the Red Army officer corps, and it was overlooked that most of those purged were merely expelled from the Party. Thirty percent of officers purged in 1937‚Äì1939 were allowed to return to service.Stephen Lee, European Dictatorships 1918‚Äì1945, page 56. The purge of the army was claimed to be supported by German-forged documents (said to have been correspondence between Marshal Tukhachevsky and members of the German high command). The claim is unsupported by facts, as by the time the documents were supposedly created, two people from the eight in the Tukhachevsky group were already imprisoned, and by the time the document was said to reach Stalin the purging process was already underway. However the actual evidence introduced at trial was obtained from forced confessions. The wider purge Eventually almost all of the Bolsheviks who had played prominent roles during the Russian Revolution of 1917, or in Lenin's Soviet government, were executed. Out of six members of the original Politburo during the 1917 October Revolution who lived until the Great Purge, Stalin himself was the only one who remained in the Soviet Union, alive. Four of the other five were executed; the fifth, Leon Trotsky, had been forced into exile outside the Soviet Union in 1929, but was assassinated in Mexico by Soviet agent Ram√≥n Mercader in 1940. Of the seven members elected to the Politburo between the October Revolution and Lenin's death in 1924, four were executed, one (Tomsky) committed suicide, and two (Molotov and Kalinin) lived. However, the trials and executions of the former Bolshevik leaders, while being the most visible part, were only a minor aspect of the purges. A series of documents discovered in the Central Committee archives in 1992 by Vladimir Bukovsky demonstrate that there were quotas for arrests and executions as for all other activities in the planned economy. The victims were convicted in absentia and in camera by extrajudicial organs‚Äîthe NKVD troikas sentenced indigenous \\"enemies\\" under NKVD Order no. 00447 and the two- man dvoiki (NKVD Commissar Nikolai Yezhov and Main State Prosecutor Andrey Vyshinsky, or their deputies) those arrested along national lines. A characteristic of all the mass operations of the NKVD was flexibility: first, the numbers‚Äîthe so-called limit‚Äîcould be easily increased; second, it was left entirely to the NKVD officers whether a particular prisoner was to be shot or sent to the prison camps; third, the time-limits set for the completion of single operations were extended time and again. The victims were executed at night, either in prisons, in the cellars of NKVD headquarters, or in a secluded area, usually a forest. The NKVD officers shot prisoners in the head using pistols.The NKVD Mass Secret Operation n¬∞00447 (August 1937 - November 1938)Kurapaty (1937-1941): NKVD Mass Killings in Soviet Belarus Intelligentsia 1938 NKVD arrest photo of the poet Osip Mandelstam, who died in a labor camp.

In the 1920s and 1930s, 2,000 writers, intellectuals, and artists were imprisoned and 1,500 died in prisons and concentration camps. After sunspot development research was judged un-Marxist, twenty-seven astronomers disappeared between 1936 and 1938. The Meteorological Office was violently purged as early as 1933 for failing to predict weather harmful to the crops. However, the toll was especially high among writers. Those who perished during the Great Purge include: Pianist Khadija Gayibova, executed in 1938. Paleontologist and geologist Dmitrii Mushketov, executed in 1938. Western √©migr√© victims Victims of the terror included American immigrants to the Soviet Union who had emigrated at the height of the Great Depression to find work. At the height of the Terror, American immigrants besieged the US embassy, begging for passports so they could leave the Soviet Union. They were turned away by embassy officials, only to be arrested on the pavement outside by lurking NKVD agents. Many were subsequently shot dead at Butovo firing range.Tim Tzouliadis. \\"Nightmare in the workers paradise\\".

Mongolian Great Purge During the late 1930s, Stalin dispatched NKVD operatives to the Mongolian People's Republic, established a Mongolian version of the NKVD troika, and proceeded to execute tens of thousands of people accused of having ties to \\"pro-Japanese spy rings\\". Buddhist lamas made up the majority of victims, with 18,000 being killed in the terror. Other victims were nobility and political and academic figures, along with some ordinary workers and herders.Christopher Kaplonski, \\"Thirty thousand bullets\\", in: Historical Injustice and Democratic Transition in Eastern Asia and Northern Europe, London 2002, pp. 155‚Äì168 Mass graves containing hundreds of executed Buddhist monks and civilians have been discovered as recently as 2003.\\"Mass grave uncovered in Mongolia\\".

Rocket engineer Sergei Korolev shortly after his arrest, 1938 Timeline The Great Purge of 1936‚Äì1938 can be roughly divided into four periods:N.G. Okhotin, A.B. Roginsky \\"Great Terror\\": Brief Chronology Memorial, 2007 ; October 1936 ‚Äì February 1937:Reforming the security organizations, adopting official plans on purging the elites. ; March 1937 ‚Äì June 1937:Purging the elites; adopting plans for the mass repressions against the \\"social base\\" of the potential aggressors, starting of purging the \\"elites\\" from opposition. ; July 1937 ‚Äì October 1938:Mass repressions against \\"kulaks\\", \\"dangerous\\" ethnic minorities, family members of oppositionists, military officers, saboteurs in agriculture and industry. ; November 1938 ‚Äì 1939: Stopping of mass operations, abolishing of many organs of extrajudicial executions, repressions against some organizers of mass repressions. End In the summer of 1938 Yezhov was relieved from his post as head of the NKVD and was eventually tried and executed. Lavrentiy Beria, a fellow Georgian and Stalin confidant, succeeded him as head of NKVD. On 17 November 1938 a joint decree of Sovnarkom USSR and Central Committee of VKP(b) (Decree about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation) and the subsequent order of NKVD undersigned by Beria, cancelled most of the NKVD orders of systematic repression and suspended implementation of death sentences. The decree signaled the end of massive Soviet purges. Nevertheless, the practice of mass arrest and exile continued until Stalin's death in 1953. Political executions also continued, but, with the exception of Katyn and other NKVD massacres during World War II, on a vastly smaller scale. One notorious example is the \\"Night of the Murdered Poets\\", in which at least thirteen prominent Yiddish writers were executed on 12 August 1952. Historians such as Michael Parrish have argued that while the Great Terror ended in 1938, a lesser terror continued in the 1940s. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (a Soviet Army officer who became a prisoner for a decade in the Gulag system) presents in The Gulag Archipelago the most holistic view of the timeline of all the Leninist and Stalinist purges (1918‚Äì1956), in which the 1936‚Äì1938 purge may have been simply the one that got the most attention from people in a position to record its magnitude for posterity‚Äîthe intelligentsia‚Äîby directly targeting them, whereas several other waves of the ongoing flow of purges, such as the 1928‚Äì1933 collectivization and dekulakization, were just as huge and just as devoid of justice but were more successfully swallowed into oblivion in the popular memory of the (surviving) Soviet public. For example, in one such passage Solzhenitsyn mentions 1938 and says that 1948 was in some ways hardly better. In some cases, high military command arrested under Yezhov were later executed under Beria. Some examples include Marshal of the Soviet Union Alexander Yegorov, arrested in April 1938 and shot (or died from torture) in February 1939 (his wife, G. A. Yegorova, was shot in August 1938); Army Commander Ivan Fedko, arrested July 1938 and shot February 1939; Flagman , arrested May 1938 and shot February 1940; Komkor G. I. Bondar, arrested August 1938 and shot March 1939. All the aforementioned have been posthumously rehabilitated. Polish-born Soviet politician Stanislav Kosior, a contributor to the 1932‚Äì33 famine in Ukraine, was executed in 1939. When the relatives of those who had been executed in 1937‚Äì38 inquired about their fate, they were told by NKVD that their arrested relatives had been sentenced to \\"ten years without the right of correspondence\\" (–¥–µ—Å—è—Ç—å –ª–µ—Ç –±–µ–∑ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏). When these ten-year periods elapsed in 1947‚Äì48 but the arrested did not appear, the relatives asked MGB about their fate again and this time were told that the arrested died in imprisonment. Western reactions Although the trials of former Soviet leaders were widely publicized, the hundreds of thousands of other arrests and executions were not. These became known in the West only as a few former gulag inmates reached the West with their stories. Not only did foreign correspondents from the West fail to report on the purges, but in many Western nations (especially France), attempts were made to silence or discredit these witnesses; according to Robert Conquest, Jean-Paul Sartre took the position that evidence of the camps should be ignored so the French proletariat would not be discouraged. A series of legal actions ensued at which definitive evidence was presented that established the validity of the former labor camp inmates' testimony. According to Robert Conquest in his 1968 book The Great Terror: Stalin's Purge of the Thirties, with respect to the trials of former leaders, some Western observers were unintentionally or intentionally ignorant of the fraudulent nature of the charges and evidence, notably Walter Duranty of The New York Times, a Russian speaker; the American Ambassador, Joseph E. Davies, who reported, \\"proof ... beyond reasonable doubt to justify the verdict of treason\\"; and Beatrice and Sidney Webb, authors of Soviet Communism: A New Civilization. While \\"Communist Parties everywhere simply transmitted the Soviet line\\", some of the most critical reporting also came from the left, notably The Manchester Guardian. The American journalist H. R. Knickerbocker also reported on the executions. He called them in 1941 \\"the great purges\\", and described how over four years they affected \\"the top fourth or fifth, to estimate it conservatively, of the Party itself, of the Army, Navy, and Air Force leaders and then of the new Bolshevik intelligentsia, the foremost technicians, managers, supervisors, scientists\\". Knickerbocker also wrote about dekulakization: \\"It is a conservative estimate to say that some 5,000,000 [kulaks] ... died at once, or within a few years.\\" Evidence and the results of research began to appear after Stalin's death. This revealed the full enormity of the Purges. The first of these sources were the revelations of Nikita Khrushchev, which particularly affected the American editors of the Communist Party USA newspaper, the Daily Worker, who, following the lead of The New York Times, published the Secret Speech in full.On Leaving the Communist Party by Howard Fast, 16 November 1957 Rehabilitation Posthumously rehabilitated, Tukhachevsky on a 1963 postage stamp of the Soviet Union Monument to victims of the repressions in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia The Great Purge was denounced by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev following Stalin's death. In his secret speech to the 20th CPSU congress in February 1956 (which was made public a month later), Khrushchev referred to the purges as an \\"abuse of power\\" by Stalin which resulted in enormous harm to the country. In the same speech, he recognized that many of the victims were innocent and were convicted on the basis of false confessions extracted by torture. To take that position was politically useful to Khrushchev, as he was at that time engaged in a power struggle with rivals who had been associated with the Purge, the so-called Anti-Party Group. The new line on the Great Purges undermined their power, and helped propel him to the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. Starting from 1954, some of the convictions were overturned. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other generals convicted in the Trial of Red Army Generals were declared innocent (\\"rehabilitated\\") in 1957. The former Politburo members Yan Rudzutak and Stanislav Kosior and many lower-level victims were also declared innocent in the 1950s. Nikolai Bukharin and others convicted in the Moscow Trials were not rehabilitated until as late as 1988. Leon Trotsky, considered a major player in the Russian Revolution and a major contributor to Marxist theory, was never rehabilitated by the USSR. The book Rehabilitation: The Political Processes of the 1930s‚Äì50s (–†–µ–∞–±–∏–ª–∏—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—è. –ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å—ã 30-50-—Ö –≥–æ–¥–æ–≤) (1991) contains a large amount of newly presented original archive material: transcripts of interrogations, letters of convicts, and photos. The material demonstrates in detail how numerous show trials were fabricated. Number of people executed Official figures put the total number of documentable executions during the years 1937 and 1938 at 681,692, in addition to 136,520 deaths in the Gulag; whereas the total estimate of deaths brought about by Soviet repression during the Great Purge ranges from 950,000 to 1.2 million, which includes executions, deaths in detention and those who died shortly after being released from the Gulag, as a result of their treatment therein. This estimate summarises results of comparative analysis of various archival documents and, therefore, takes into account earlier arguments that official Soviet archival data may understate the actual number of deaths, be incomplete or unreliable.Communism: A History (Modern Library Chronicles) by Richard Pipes, pg 67Stalinism in Post-Communist Perspective: New Evidence on Killings, Forced Labour and Economic Growth in the 1930s by Steven Rosefielde, 1996.

In one instance, he told Yezhov \\"Isn't it time to squeeze this gentleman and force him to report on his dirty little business? Where is he: in a prison or a hotel?\\" In another, while reviewing one of Yezhov's lists, he added to M. I. Baranov's name, \\"beat, beat!\\"Marc Jansen, Nikita Vasil πevich Petrov.

Hoover Institution Press, 2002. p. 111 According to Stalin biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore, he never attended torture sessions or executions. In addition to authorizing torture, Stalin also signed 357 lists in 1937 and 1938 authorizing executions of some 40,000 people, and about 90% of these are confirmed to have been shot,Michael Ellman, Stalin and the Soviet Famine of 1932‚Äì33 Revisited Europe-Asia Studies, Routledge.

Press, c1999, p. 470 While reviewing one such list, Stalin reportedly muttered to no one in particular: \\"Who's going to remember all this riff-raff in ten or twenty years time? No one. Who remembers the names now of the boyars Ivan the Terrible got rid of? No one.\\"Quoted in Dmitri Volkogonov, Stalin: Triumph and Tragedy (New York, 1991), pg 210. Stalin's alleged remark may be compared with Hitler's famous admonition to his generals in 1939: \\"Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?\\" Stephen G. Wheatcroft posits that while the 'purposive deaths' caused by Hitler constitute 'murder', those caused by Stalin fall into the category of 'execution'. He elaborates: > Stalin undoubtedly caused many innocent people to be executed, but it seems > likely that he thought many of them guilty of crimes against the state and > felt that the execution of others would act as a deterrent to the guilty. He > signed the papers and insisted on documentation. Hitler, by contrast, wanted > to be rid of the Jews and communists simply because they were Jews and > communists. He was not concerned about making any pretence at legality. He > was careful not to sign anything on this matter and was equally insistent on > no documentation. Soviet investigation commissions Opening of monument to victims of political repressions, Moscow, 1990 At least two Soviet commissions investigated the show-trials after Stalin's death. The first was headed by Molotov and included Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Suslov, Furtseva, Shvernik, Aristov, Pospelov, and Rudenko. They were given the task to investigate the materials concerning Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and others. The commission worked in 1956‚Äì1957. While stating that the accusations against Tukhachevsky et al. should be abandoned, it failed to fully rehabilitate the victims of the three Moscow trials, although the final report does contain an admission that the accusations have not been proven during the trials and \\"evidence\\" had been produced by lies, blackmail, and \\"use of physical influence\\". Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, and others were still seen as political opponents, and though the charges against them were obviously false, they could not have been rehabilitated because \\"for many years they headed the anti-Soviet struggle against the building of socialism in USSR\\". The second commission largely worked from 1961 to 1963 and was headed by Shvernik (\\"Shvernik Commission\\"). It included Shelepin, Serdyuk, Mironov, Rudenko, and Semichastny. The hard work resulted in two massive reports, which detailed the mechanism of falsification of the show-trials against Bukharin, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and many others. The commission based its findings in large part on eyewitness testimonies of former NKVD workers and victims of repressions, and on many documents. The commission recommended rehabilitating every accused with the exceptions of Radek and Yagoda, because Radek's materials required some further checking, and Yagoda was a criminal and one of the falsifiers of the trials (though most of the charges against him had to be dropped too, he was not a \\"spy\\", etc.). The commission stated: > Stalin committed a very grave crime against the Communist party, the > socialist state, Soviet people and worldwide revolutionary > movement...Together with Stalin, the responsibility for the abuse of law, > mass unwarranted repressions and death of many thousands of wholly innocent > people also lies on Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov.... Molotov stated \\"We would have been complete idiots if we had taken the reports at their face value. We were not idiots.\\" and that \\"the cases were reviewed and some people were released\\"huev, Feliks. Molotov Remembers. Chicago: I. R. Dee, 1993, p. 276Chuev, Feliks. Molotov Remembers.

In 1988, for instance, the mass graves at Kurapaty in Belarus were the site of a clash between demonstrators and the police. In 1990, a boulder stone was brought from the former Solovki prison camp in the White Sea, and erected next to KGB headquarters in Moscow as a memorial to all \\"the victims of political repression\\" since 1917. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, many more mass graves filled with executed victims of the terror were discovered and turned into memorial sites.\\"Pictorial essay: Death trenches bear witness to Stalin's purges\\" CNN, 17 July 1997\\"Mass grave found at Ukrainian monastery\\", BBC, 12 July 2002\\"Wary of its past, Russia ignores mass grave site\\", by Fred Weir, The Christian Science Monitor, 10 October 2002Stalin-era mass grave yields tons of bones Reuters. 9 June 2010 Some, such as the killing fields Bykivnia near Kyiv, are said to contain up to 200,000 corpses.

According to one interpretation, Stalin's regime had to maintain its citizens in a state of fear and uncertainty to stay in power (Brzezinski, 1958). Robert Conquest emphasized Stalin's paranoia, focused on the Moscow show trial of \\"Old Bolsheviks\\", and analyzed the carefully planned and systematic destruction of the Communist Party. Some others view the Great Purge as a crucial moment, or rather the culmination, of a vast social engineering campaign started at the beginning of the 1930s (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003; Werth, 2003). According to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research pokes \\"rather large holes in the traditional story\\" weaved by Conquest and others. His findings, while not exonerating Stalin or the Soviet state, dispel the notion that the bloodletting was merely the result of Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an exaggerated fear of counterrevolution. > So what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot > more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late > 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that > the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders > hadn't adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary > reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same > mistake. Two major lines of interpretation have emerged among historians. One argues that the purges reflected Stalin's ambitions, his paranoia, and his inner drive to increase his power and eliminate potential rivals. Revisionist historians explain the purges by theorizing that rival factions exploited Stalin's paranoia and used terror to enhance their own position. Peter Whitewood examines the first purge, directed at the Army, and comes up with a third interpretation that, Stalin and other top leaders believing that they were always surrounded by capitalist enemies, always worried about the vulnerability and loyalty of the Red Army.James Harris, \\"Encircled by Enemies: Stalin‚Äôs Perceptions of the Capitalist World, 1918‚Äì1941,‚Äù Journal of Strategic Studies 30#3 [2007]: 513‚Äì545. It was not a ploy ‚Äì Stalin truly believed it. ‚ÄúStalin attacked the Red Army because he seriously misperceived a serious security threat‚Äù; thus ‚ÄúStalin seems to have genuinely believed that foreign‚Äêbacked enemies had infiltrated the ranks and managed to organize a conspiracy at the very heart of the Red Army.‚Äù The purge hit deeply from June 1937 and November 1938, removing 35,000; many were executed. Experience in carrying out the purge facilitated purging other key elements in the wider Soviet polity.Peter Whitewood, The Red Army and the Great Terror: Stalin‚Äôs Purge of the Soviet Military (2015) Quoting pp 12, 276.Ronald Grigor Suny, review, Historian (2018) 80#1:177-79.For a critique of Whitewood see Alexander Hill, review, American Historical Review (2017) 122#5 pp 1713-1714.

Reese, \\"Stalin Attacks the Red Army.\\" Military History Quarterly 27.1 (2014): 38-45. Robert W. Thurston reports that the purge was not intended to subdue the Soviet masses, many of whom helped enact the purge, but to deal with opposition to Stalin's rule among the Soviet elites.

The population was 3,558 at the 2010 census. At an 2018 estimate from the Office of Financial Management, the population was 3,862. It is named after the forks in the nearby Quillayute, Bogachiel, Calawah, and Sol Duc rivers. For many years, the city's economy was fueled by the local timber industry. More recently it has drawn tourism related to the novel series Twilight and films of the same name, set in Forks. With recent declines in the timber industry, Forks has relied on the nearby Clallam Bay Corrections Center and Olympic Corrections Center as sources of jobs. Forks is a popular destination for sport fishers who fish for salmon and rainbow trout in nearby rivers. It is also supported by visitors to Olympic National Park.  History = Territory of the Quileute Native Americans  Forks was once inhabited by the Quileute Native American tribe, before they ceded their territory. In 1889 a reservation was created near Forks the same year that Washington became a state. That same year the village was burnt down by settler Daniel Pullen. Forks is 12 miles from tribal burning areas that area tribes used to regenerate young ferns. The phrase \\"prairie upstream\\" from Quileute language was translated and became the name Forks Prairie.  Early settlement  Early settlers to Forks came via the rivers and trails from the Pacific and the Strait of Juan de Fuca due to the lack of overland options. In the 1860s, Men from Dungeness unsuccessfully attempted to convince the territorial legislature to create Quillehuyte County out of Clallam and Jefferson counties's western ends. In January 1878 in a mile east of Forks, Luther and Esther Ford arrived and laid claim to the 160-acre homestead (at the time there was already a few trappers living in the area). Ford set up the first dairy herd in the settlement in 1879. In 1884 a post office opened in Nelson's cabin. Since another Washington settlement already was named 'Ford's Prairie' the name 'Forks' was chosen as the name. The name 'Forks' was due to the prairie's location as a fork in the vicinity of three rivers. It was difficult to receive and sell products in Forks in its early days since the nearest market was in Port Townsend (over 55 miles away). The small supply boat that was provided in the summers wasn't large enough for cargo either. Due to these problems, hops would regularly rot awaiting transport. It wasn't until narrow roads were built in the 1880s and 1890s that the situation improved slightly. Eventually canoes and ferries were used to help alleviate these issues. In 1927 a single car sized road opened from Lake Crescent to Forks and the Olympic Loop Highway (U.S. 101) was built through Forks in 1931. The Mora post moved to Forks in the early 1890s which consisted of a general store, hardware store, and a hotel. In the early 1900s, hop growing declined and the Forks Cooperative Creamery was established which operated for 70 years. Timber was cleared by settlers and small-time loggers in the late 1800s. Booming logging camps were set up by Timber baron Michael Earles in the early 1900s which attracted a lot of workers in the area. In 1916, Merrill & Ring began to log in the Pysht River drainage northwest of the area. President Grover Cleveland placed individual claiming of timber volume off-limits in the Olympic Peninsula around this time which proved monumental for the area's future. The Olympic Forest Reserve was trimmed by 623,000 acres but it contained three-fourths of all timber by volume. The Olympic National Park took up the remaining parts of the reserve (it first became a monument in 1909). Isolation soon creeped into the area due to the 1907 national recession. Sitka Spruce in the West End was provided during the First World War due to urgent demand. The U.S. Army's Spruce Production Division used this spruce to build 36 miles of railroad track from Port Angeles to Lake Pleasant in six months. But before it could be completed, World War I ended and no spruce was hauled down the line. Settlers from the Hoh came gradually to Forks in its earlier days. In 1912 the town was laid out where the Whittier homestead stood and as late as the 1920s the town was just a block of buildings and prairie homesteads amongst looming forests. In 1930 the current newspaper, Forks Forum started publication 40 years after the original Forks newspaper was established. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Forks gained many amenities of modern towns at the time as new inhabitants increased its population. Nearly 20 percent of the forest around Forks was flattened as what locals described as a \\"hurricane roaring overhead\\" swept through the West End. Five years later a fire occurred on Main Street before another fire hit the town in 1951.  Modern history  Forks was officially incorporated on August 28, 1945, following an election of the constituents who would become its first town members. The city gained popularity for being a key setting in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series (2005 to 2008) and related film adaptations.

In late September, the Forks Chamber of Commerce partners with the Quileute Tribe and the City of Forks to host the Last Chance Fishing Derby at La Push; cash prizes are offered to those wanting to fish for salmon on the Pacific Ocean. The first week in October is when the community celebrates its heritage during Heritage Days. One of the more celebrated events during this week-long festival is the \\"Old Timers Round Table;\\" this is a moderated conversation broadcast live via the local radio station, featuring longtime residents of the region talking about days long past. The Forks City Council passed a resolution in 2007 celebrating Stephenie Meyer Day in honor of the Twilight young adult novels and film series, set for September 13, the day before the fictional Bella's birthday. In 2015 the event was still driving tourism, with visitor numbers peaking in 2010, then settling to 50% more than before the Twilight phenomenon. Stephanie Meyer Day has been replaced with the Forever Twilight in Forks Festival which is still celebrated annually on the week of September 13.http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/entertainment/twilight- fans-gather-in-forks-this- weekend/http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/news/collection-adds-more-to- upcoming-forever-twilight-in-forks-festival/ The festival includes activities such as a movie marathon, a blood drive, dance lessons, and more.

History Photograph of a Makah woman carrying wood along Neah Bay in 1908 by Asahel Curtis The name \\"Neah\\" refers to the Makah Chief Dee-ah, pronounced Neah in the Klallam language. The town is named for the water body Neah Bay, which acquired its name in the early 19th century. A number of names were used for the bay before it was established as Neah Bay. In August 1788 Captain Charles Duncan, a British trader, charted a bay at the location of Neah Bay, but did not give it a name. In 1790 Manuel Quimper took possession of the bay for Spain and named it \\"Bah√≠a de N√∫√±ez Gaona\\" in honor of Alonso N√∫√±ez de Haro y Peralta, viceroy of New Spain. In 1792 Salvador Fidalgo began to build a Spanish fort on Neah Bay, but the project failed within the year and the cannon and supplies were transported to the more northerly colony of Santa Cruz de Nuca. While Fidalgo was working on the fort George Vancouver charted but did not stop at the bay. American traders called Neah Bay \\"Poverty Cove\\". In 1841 the United States Exploring Expedition under Charles Wilkes mapped the region and named Neah Bay \\"Scarborough Harbour\\" in honor of Captain James Scarborough of the Hudson's Bay Company, who had provided assistance to the expedition. The Wilkes map contained the first use of the word \\"Neah\\", but for the bay's island, now called Waadah Island. The bay was first called Neah in 1847 by Captain Henry Kellett during his reorganization of the British Admiralty charts. Kellett spelled it \\"Neeah Bay\\". In 1929, the Neah Bay Dock Company, a subsidiary of the Puget Sound Navigation Company, owned a wharf and a hotel at Neah Bay.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats ‚Äì A Legend on Puget Sound, at page182. whalers stripping their prey at Neah Bay - 1910  Economy  The local economy is sustained mostly by fishing and tourism.

Ling cod fishing is good in spring and summer, while salmon fishing is good during summer runs. However ‚Äî Neah Bay is mostly known for the best halibut fishing in the lower 48 states. The United States halibut season generally lasts a handful of days in May and June, ending when a seasonal quota is attained. When the United States halibut season is closed, some fishermen obtain Canadian fishing licenses and launch from Neah Bay, running approximately to the portion of Swiftsure Bank that lies in Canadian waters. Popular spots for halibut include \\"The Garbage Dump\\", located just inside the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Swiftsure Bank ‚Äî a few miles out into the open ocean. Larger boats (including many of the commercial charter boats available) often travel or more into the open ocean, to such places as Blue Dot and 72-Square.  Tourism  Neah Bay's significant attraction is the Makah Museum. It houses and interprets artifacts from a Makah village partly buried by a mudslide around 1750Prehistoric Cultures of North Americas.

While camping, tourists spend time surfing and fishing.  Coast Guard  The United States Coast Guard maintains a base in Neah Bay on the Makah Indian reservation. The base is maintained for search and rescue, environmental protection and maritime law enforcement operations. The Coast Guard cutter stationed in Cleveland, Ohio is named the Neah Bay (WTGB-105).

With a population of 19,038 as of the 2010 census, it is the largest city in the county. The population was estimated at 20,229 in 2019 by the Office of Financial Management. The City's harbor was dubbed (Port of Our Lady of the Angels) by Spanish explorer in 1791. By the mid-19th century, after settlement by English speakers from the United States, the name was shortened and partially anglicized to its current form, Port Angeles Harbor. Port Angeles is home to Peninsula College. It is the birthplace of football hall of famer John Elway and residents include writers and artists. The city is served by William R. Fairchild International Airport. Ferry service is provided across the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Victoria, British Columbia, Canada on the MV Coho. History This area was long occupied by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples. In 1791, the harbor was entered by Spanish explorer , who named it (Port of Our Lady of the Angels), claiming it for Spain. He was on an expedition from southern California. This name was shortened to the current one of Port Angeles. The first Europeans to the area tended to trade with the Native Americans. It was not until the 19th century that European Americans began to settle here. A small whaling, fishing and shipping village developed, which traded with Victoria, British Columbia. In 1856‚Äì1857, the first settlers arrived and they were followed by the Cherbourg Land Company in 1859. Soon afterwards the site caught the attention of Victor Smith. Smith, a protege of Salmon Chase, was Collector of Customs for the Puget Sound District. He quickly gained approval to relocate the U.S. Customs Port of Entry for Washington Territory from Port Townsend to Port Angeles. With Chase's support, he also succeeded in getting President Abraham Lincoln to designate at Port Angeles as a federal reserve for lighthouse, military and naval purposes. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers platted a federal town site on the reserve land, laying out the street plan which still exists today. The fact that Washington, D.C., was the only other city officially laid out by the federal government led the U.S. Board of Trade in 1890 to dub Port Angeles the \\"Second National City.\\" Settlers soon followed slowly, but Smith's death in the sinking of the Brother Jonathen led to the loss of interest in the area. The Port of Entry was returned to Port Townsend and the area sank into obscurity until the 1880s. In 1884, a hotel was built and the trading post was expanded into the areas first general store. A wharf was soon built upon that site that the current ferry pier stands. A village of 300 in 1886, Port Angeles' population grew to 3,000 by 1890. Hundreds of its new residents were part of the Puget Sound Cooperative Colony, which was established in 1887 and built several of the settlement's first permanent civic facilities, including a sawmill, church, office building, and opera house. The town was incorporated on June 11, 1890, and was named the county seat of Clallam County later that year. A depression a few years later was weathered and the town continued to grow into the new century. In 1914, large- scale logging began with construction of a large mill and a railway connecting the hinterlands to the mill. Other mills were soon built and the lumber and pulp mills supported the economy of the area until well into the century. Tourism became increasingly important as the growing national affluence, and especially the 1961 opening of the Hood Canal Bridge that cut driving time from the populated central Puget Sound region, brought more visitors drawn by the mountains, rivers, and rainforest of Olympic National Park and by fishing and boating along the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The mills began to close in the 70s and 80s until only one pulp mill remained in operation. In August, 2003, a $275 million construction project known as the Graving Dock Project was started in Port Angeles near the water as part of the Hood Canal Bridge east- half replacement project. It was intended to construct an area for anchoring pontoons for the bridge.Review of Port Angeles Graving Dock Project , Report 06-8, June 30, 2006 During construction, human remains and artifacts were discovered. This site was found to be the \\"largest prehistoric Indian village and burial ground found in the United States,\\" according to a senior archaeologist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Seattle. The archeology site also included Native American burials of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Archeologists were called in to conduct a professional excavation. They found about 300 graves and 785 pieces of human bones, in addition to numerous ritual and ceremonial Indian artifacts of the former Tse-whit-zen village of the federally recognized Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. This site had been continuously occupied by indigenous cultures for thousands of years; some of the remains date back at least 8,000 years. Because of the significance of the site for Native American history, in December, 2004, the graving dock project was abandoned. Many of the graves uncovered appeared to hold entire families, who seemed to have died suddenly. Archeologists project that this was likely the result of pandemics of smallpox and other infectious illnesses brought by European immigrants to North America. These caused massive death tolls among Native American populations in 1780 and 1835, as they had no acquired immunity. Infectious diseases contracted from interactions with European fur traders are believed to have killed about 90 percent of the Indians living in the Northwest before European-American settlement of the area. In 2016, Port Angeles installed street signs in English and Klallam to revitalize and preserve the area's Klallam culture. Geography The coordinates of Port Angeles are 48¬∞06‚Ä≤47‚Ä≥N 123¬∞26‚Ä≤27‚Ä≥W (48.112969, -123.440713). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The city is situated on the northern edge of the Olympic Peninsula along the shore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Port Angeles features a long and narrow glacial morraine named Ediz Hook that projects north-easterly nearly three miles into the Strait. Ediz Hook creates a large, natural deep-water harbor shielded from the storms and swells that move predominantly eastward down the Strait from the Pacific Ocean. Coast Guard Air Station / Sector Field Office (SFO) Port Angeles is situated on the end of Ediz Hook. The harbor is deep enough to provide anchorage for large ocean-going ships such as tankers and cruise ships. The south shore of Vancouver Island and the city of Victoria, British Columbia are visible across the Strait to the north. Port Angeles is located in the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains, which means the city gets significantly less rain than other areas of western Washington. The average annual precipitation total is approximately 25 inches (640 mm), compared to Seattle's 38 inches (970 mm). Temperatures are moderated by the maritime location, with winter lows rarely below 25 degrees Fahrenheit (‚àí4 ¬∞C) and summer highs rarely above 80 degrees F (27 ¬∞C). However, in winter the city can be vulnerable to windstorms and Arctic cold fronts that sweep across the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Port Angeles receives about 4 inches (100 mm) of snow each year, but it rarely stays on the ground for long. Port Angeles is also the location of the headquarters of Olympic National Park, which encompasses most of the Olympic Mountains. This park was established in 1938 during the Great Depression by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. File:Port Angeles August 2007.jpgEarly morning photograph from the pier tower File:Crossroads in Port Angeles.jpgCrossroads in Port Angeles, Strait of Juan de Fuca and Vancouver Island in the background Climate Port Angeles has a mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen Csb). It is heavily moderated by the Pacific Ocean, resulting in cool summers and mild winters for its latitude. Summers are far cooler than in Seattle for example. Port Angeles is in the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains, resulting in much lower precipitation (only 25 inches per year) than locations to the west outside of the rain shadow (for example La Push, with 100 inches per year).

The 2010 census counted a population of 6,606. With the surrounding area, the population is about 28,000. The population served by the Sequim School District population was close to 29,000 in 2018. Sequim is located along the Dungeness River near the base of the Olympic Mountains. Sequim lies within the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains and receives on average less than of rain per year ‚Äì about the same as Los Angeles, California ‚Äì leading it to give itself the nickname of Sunny Sequim. However, the city is relatively close to some of the wettest temperate rainforests of the contiguous United States. This climate anomaly is sometimes called the \\"Blue Hole of Sequim\\". Fogs and cool breezes from the Juan de Fuca Strait make Sequim's climate more humid than would be expected from the low average annual precipitation. Some places have surprisingly luxuriant forests dominated by Douglas-fir and western red cedar. Black cottonwood, red alder, bigleaf maple, Pacific madrone, lodgepole pine, and Garry oak can also be large. Historically, much of the area was an open oak- studded prairie supported by somewhat excessively drained gravelly sandy loam soil, though agriculture and development of the Dungeness valley have changed this ecosystem. Most soils under Sequim have been placed in a series that is named after the city. This \\"Sequim series\\" is one of the few Mollisols in western Washington and its high base saturation, a characteristic of the Mollisol order, is attributed to the minimal leaching of bases caused by low annual rainfall. The city and the surrounding area are particularly known for the commercial cultivation of lavender, supported by the unique climate. It makes Sequim the \\"Lavender Capital of North America\\", rivaled only in France. The area is also known for its Dungeness crab. Sequim is pronounced as one syllable, with the e elided: \\"skwim\\". The name developed from the Klallam language.  History = Aboriginal inhabitants  Fossils discovered in the late 1970s at a dig near Sequim ‚Äì by Carl Gustafson, an archaeologist at Washington State University ‚Äì known as the Manis Mastodon Site included a mastodon bone with an embedded bone point, evidencing the presence of hunters in the area about 14,000 years ago. According to Michael R. Waters, an archaeologist at Texas A&M; University, this is the first hunting weapon found that dates to the pre-Clovis period. The S'Klallam tribe had inhabited the region prior to the arrival of the first Europeans. S'Klallam means \\"the strong people\\". The band of S'Klallam Indians disbanded into their own individual federally recognized tribes in the early 1900s. The local tribe is the Jamestown S'Klallam tribe, named after one of their early leaders, Lord James Balch. According to other tales, the town Sequim in S'Klallam means \\"a place for going to shoot\\", which represents the abundance of game and wildlife of the area.  Settlement  Manuel Quimper and George Vancouver explored the region's coast in the 1790s. The first European settlers arrived in the Dungeness Valley in the 1850s, settling nearby Dungeness, Washington. While the lands along the river became fertile farmlands, the remainder of the area remained arid prairie, known as \\"the desert\\". Irrigation canals first brought water to the prairie in the 1890s, allowing the expansion of farmlands. Sequim was officially incorporated on October 31, 1913. For many decades small farms, mostly dairy farms, dotted the area around the small town. Near the end of World War I, Sequim became a stop for a railway that passed through from Port Angeles to Port Townsend, built primarily to carry wood products from the forests of the western Olympic Peninsula. Culture Sequim holds an Irrigation Festival every May. , it is the longest continually running festival in the state and is in its 124th year.

The population was 17,571 at the 2010 census. Between 2000 and 2005, Battle Ground ranked fourth in the state for population growth, out of 279 eligible incorporated communities.OFM  April 1 official population estimates As of 2019, its population is 21,252. History=Name Battle Ground got its name from a standoff between a group of the Klickitat peoples and a military force from the Vancouver Barracks, which had recently transitioned to a U.S. Army post. In 1855, when this occurred, members of the Klickitat peoples had been imprisoned at the Vancouver Barracks. The hostile conditions of their detainment inspired some of the Klickitats to decamp. This group of Klickitat peoples headed North, led by Chief Umtuch ( or Umtux, according to some accounts). When the community at Fort Vancouver discovered this escape, they assembled an armed contingent led by Captain William Strong to pursue the Klickitats. After great difficulty, Captain Strong's party found the Klickitats near the present-day location of downtown Battle Ground. Details of the standoff that ensued vary. However, indisputably, Chief Umtuch and Captain Strong engaged in some sort of negotiations which resulted in the Klickitats' agreeing to return to the Barracks. After this decision though, at least one shot was fired that murdered Chief Umtuch, likely by one of Captain Strong's soldiers. The Klickitat asked Captain Strong to leave them alone so they could properly bury their chief. After some deliberation, Captain Strong agreed as long as the Klickitats promised to return to the Fort, which they did a couple of days later. As a result of this event, settlers at the fort began to refer to that site as \\"Strong's Battle Ground\\", which was later shortened to \\"Battle Ground\\". Two currently operating schools in Battle Ground are named after Captain Strong and Chief Umtuch. Early settlement Battle Ground was first settled in 1886, by Augustus H.

The east side of town borders the city of Washougal, Washington, and the west side of town borders Vancouver, Washington. Camas lies along the Washington side of the Columbia River, across from Troutdale, Oregon, and is part of the Portland metropolitan area. One of the major geographical features of the city is Prune Hill. Prune Hill is an extinct volcanic vent and is part of the Boring Lava Field of northwest Oregon and southwest Washington.Boring Lava Field, vulcan.wr.usgs.gov History Officially incorporated on June 18, 1906, the city is named after the camas lily, a plant with an onion-like bulb prized by Native Americans. At the west end of downtown Camas is a large Georgia-Pacific paper mill from which the high school teams get their name, \\"the Papermakers\\". A paper mill was first established in the city in 1883 with the support of Henry Pittock, a wealthy entrepreneur from England who had settled in Portland, Oregon, where he published The Oregonian. Pittock's LaCamas Colony bought 2,600 acres in 1883, forming the Columbia River Paper Company the following year to begin production in 1885, before merging with Oregon City's Crown Paper Company to form Crown Columbia Paper in 1905. Converting from steam to electricity in 1913, it then merged with Willamette Paper in 1914 and then again in 1928 with Zellerbach Paper to become the largest paper company on the west coast, Crown Zellerbach. Changing from newsprint to toilet tissue in 1930, it temporarily produced shipyard parts during the Second World War. In 1950 it was the first factory to produce folded paper napkins. \\"Crown Z\\" was the area's biggest employer in 1971, with 2,643 of approximately 3,700 Clark County paper-mill workers. Various other mergers took place, until Georgia-Pacific's mill was the sole property of Koch Industries. In 2018, Koch announced plans to lay off approximately 200‚Äì300 workers, shutting down all equipment related to communications paper, fine paper conversion and pulping operations. The city is about east of Portland. Historically, the commercial base of the city was almost solely the paper mill; however, the diversity of industries has been enhanced considerably in recent years by the influx of several white-collar, high-tech companies. These include Hewlett-Packard, Sharp Microelectronics, Linear Technology, WaferTech and Underwriters Labs. Annual events include the summer \\"Camas Days\\", as well as other festivals and celebrations.

The park features a network of trails which lead to the Camas Potholes and the Camas lily fields. A trail that loops around Round Lake starts and finishes near the parking lot. The park is a popular destination for geocachers, as it contains numerous caches scattered around the park. Young children may play in a small playground on the west side of the park.

The population was 3,745 at the 2010 census, up from 3,274 at the 2000 census. History The community was established as \\"Venner's Villas\\" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when a land entrepreneur named J. C. Lanerberg purchased land from various sources (the government, the railroad, and other landowners). He divided the land into lots, and marketed it in large urban areas throughout the United States, highlighting its resemblance to rural Sweden. The flyers were written in Swedish so, predictably, the first settlers who arrived in the early 1900s were mostly of Swedish ancestry. The growth of nearby Vancouver and Portland led to an influx of new residents in the 1960s. The land was originally heavily timbered. A number of farms and orchards were established in the early 20th century, some of which still exist. Some old farm orchards have old heirloom apple varieties including some rare ones. The community is still rural. There are only three non-residential buildings in town. The single commercial establishment, the Venersborg Store, reopened in 2008 but closed back up in 2013. The members of the Venersborg Community Club take care of the Venersborg Schoolhouse which was built in 1912. This one-room schoolhouse is on the National Register of Historic Places and the Washington State Heritage Register. It is the oldest continuously operating community building in the state of Washington. The schoolhouse is the location for many annual events: the Sweethearts' Dance in February, Spring Potluck, December Wreath Making party, Spring Seed Swap & Giveaway. All Venersborg residents are invited to these events and encouraged to volunteer. A Venersborg barn built in 1918 is on the Washington Heritage Barn Register and is a good example of local architecture. It is constructed of hand-hewn timbers and shingles from the land it sits on and was built in a community barn raising. It is located at Friendly Haven Rise Farm.

The population was 14,095 as of the 2010 Census. History Downtown Washougal facing north Washougal was officially incorporated on December 4, 1908. Its Mount Pleasant Grange Hall is the oldest continually used grange hall in Washington. This small community is located on the Washington side of the Columbia River, with its lowlands and famous prairie situated on the west entrance to the scenic Columbia River Gorge. Motorists who approach Washougal from the west on the Lewis & Clark Highway can see Mount Hood rising above the Cascade Mountains framed by the columnar cliffs that signal the gateway of the Gorge. It is home to Excelsior High School and Washougal High School. It can be accurately stated that Washougal is the \\"crossroads to discovery\\" in the Pacific Northwest. Shortly after Capt. Robert Gray, a Boston fur trader, entered the mouth of the Columbia River in May 1792, the famed British explorer George Vancouver traveled to the region to verify Gray's discovery. In October 1792, Vancouver directed a young Lieutenant named William Broughton to lead a party of men in a long boat up the Columbia to explore its head waters. Broughton came as far as present day Washougal and landed near the east end of Reed Island. He named Mount Hood after a British admiral and Point Vancouver after his commanding officer. Broughton incorrectly assumed the head waters of the Columbia originated from Mount Hood. In reality, the river originates some 1,000 miles to the north and east in Canada, but it would be 18 years later before the entire river was charted by another famed British explorer named David Thompson. Captain Gray's discovery of the Columbia opened trade between Europeans and Chinook Indians who lived along the lower Columbia between the Cascade region and the river's mouth. U.S., British, Spanish and Russian fur traders bartered for sea otter and beaver skins in the late 18th century. Then, another important group of explorers visited the region in 1805-1806, but this group came from the east, which marked the first cross-continental expedition. These famed explorers were Meriwether Lewis & William Clark. The Corps of Discovery was impressed with the fertile valley located near Washougal. In fact, when they finally reached the Pacific Coast and conducted their historic vote on selecting their winter camp site, the three viable options considered were the Clatsop area near Astoria (Oregon), the north bank near Chinook (Washington), and the fertile valley near the Sandy and Washougal Rivers. But, because the Corps had reached the Pacific in late November, they did not have much time to construct a winter fort before the cold weather set in, therefore choosing the Clatsop region because of the abundance of big game and its view of the Pacific‚Äîand they hoped to make contact with a fur trading ship to get word back to President Jefferson about the success of their mission. On their return to the east, the Corps of Discovery rowed hard against the current hoping to return to the Nez Perce in early spring. The Nez Perce were caring for their horses over the winter and they needed the horses to travel over the Rocky Mountains. They arrived at Washougal on Monday, March 31, 1806. Lewis wrote in his journals that they camped on the lower end of a handsome prairie two miles up from the mouth of Seal (Washougal) River and directly across from the upper Quicksand (Sandy) River channel. By triangulating these landmarks, it places their campsite close to present day Capt. William Clark Park at Cottonwood Beach. The Corps would eventually camp at this location for six days in order to kill big game, dry the meat, and sew leather sacks in which to store the meat. Natives descending the river told them of scarcity in provisions (food sources) east of the Cascades. So the handsome prairie in present-day Washougal turned into a provisioning camp which became their second longest campsite in present-day Washington State. So within a 13-year period Washougal would have famous travelers visit its banks from both the east and west‚Äîagain in 1811 another famed explorer (David Thompson) would camp near the same \\"handsome prairie\\" on his famous journey to chart the entire length of the Columbia River.The History of the City of Washougal-City of Washougal In 1825, the Hudson's Bay Fur Company established Fort Vancouver near present-day Vancouver, Washington. Fur trappers and loggers began to visit regions of the Columbia River and they also assigned names to familiar locations. Washougal became known as Washougally Camp, which is thought to be a derivative of an Indian word meaning \\"rushing water.\\" One of the first Europeans to settle in this area was a British seaman named Richard Ough (also spelled Howe) who arrived in 1838. While working at Ft. Vancouver, he met and fell in love with Betsy White Wing, a Native American Princess of the Cascades people. Her father, Chief Slyhorse Schluyhus, agreed to their marriage as a political alliance, but he stipulated as a condition that Richard must settle down. After their marriage in 1838, they stayed at Ft. Vancouver. Then in the 1840s, Richard bought a large swath of land near current downtown Washougal. He purchased it from a fellow settler for $45, a horse, a saddle, and a few loaves of bread. Washougal was founded on part of the Oughs' original claim. Among Washougal's first and foremost citizens, the Oughs were generous with food and money. The Oughs had ten children in all, Sarah, Grace, Richard, Benjamin, Elizabeth, Mary, Fredrick, Cecelia, Emma, and John Thomas. Both Richard and Betsy Ough lived long and fulfilling lives, eventually owning a dairy dying at the ages 90 and 96, respectively. Both are buried in the local Catholic Cemetery and they have descendants who still live in Washougal. Personal belongings of the Ough's‚Äîincluding clothing and Indian artifacts‚Äîcan be found in the Two Rivers Heritage Museum in Washougal.Washougal -- Thumbnail HistoryFairhurst, Richenda (2006). Images of America: Washougal, p.18-20. Arcadia Publishing. Just downstream from the handsome prairie where Lewis & Clark and David Thompson camped there was a natural boat landing that later became known as Parker's Landing and played an important role for settlers following the Oregon Trail. Many pioneers coming out west would arrive at the Dalles (Oregon), where they would make rafts to float down the Columbia River. Dr. John McLoughlin, the chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Fur Company at Ft. Vancouver, tried to dissuade American pioneers from settling on the north side of the Columbia River. He sent men to build barges and rafts to float pioneers to Ft. Vancouver, where they received food and clothing and were encouraged to settle in the Willamette Valley (Oregon). Those who did not want to settle in Oregon would float rafts to Parker's Landing, where a natural eddy would wash their barges and rafts up against the north bank. By arriving at Parker's Landing, they could travel to the interior of what would become Washington State, avoiding the British at Fort Vancouver who would try to persuade them to settle elsewhere. A well-known free African- American named George Washington Bush entered the state of Washington through Parker's Landing, and eventually traveled to the center of the state, where he founded the community of Tumwater. David C. Parker came out on a wagon train with Bush and both floated down the Columbia on rafts in 1845. In 1846, when the Oregon Territory land dispute was resolved between England and the United States and the northern boundary was moved to the 49th parallel, Parker was quick to file for a land grant, which included the popular beach landing that would later assume his name and become the marina for the Port of Camas- Washougal. In fact, Parker would apply to have a young, fledgling community incorporated in 1852, and the community would be called Parkersville. This is thought to be the oldest incorporated community in the state of Washington. But a new community was developed just one mile upriver from Parkersville, closer to the lowlands for dairy farming and logging. It is this community that eventually became Washougal.

Starbuck, the town was originally a junction on the main line of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company. The town was platted in 1894, and built its first bank ten years later. In 1886, the railroad completed a line eastward from Starbuck to Pomeroy and Pataha City in Garfield County (This line remained in operation until 1981). The town was officially incorporated on September 18, 1905. In 1910, a large brick school was built. In 1914 a bridge over the Snake River was completed downstream from Lyon's Ferry, which greatly diminished the railroad traffic through the town. The economy of the town turned to agriculture, but in 1929 the bank failed. The town's population dwindled steadily until the mid twentieth century. The High School shut down in 1956, and students had to bus to Dayton. In 1961, the railroad station was shut down as well. In 1968, the Snake River Bridge (originally built over the Columbia at Vantage in 1927, then disassembled in 1963) was re-assembled in the area, providing additional access over the Snake River. In 1970, the Little Goose Dam was completed about nine miles northeast of Starbuck. Today Starbuck is a quiet, agricultural town with a population of about 130.

The first white settler recorded was in 1853. That first settler was Ezra Meeker and his family. Only one year later, Meeker moved to north Puyallup, Washington, but he sold his Donation Land Claim to a Mr. Davenport, who, with a few others, permanently settled in the Kalama area. In early 1870, Northern Pacific Railway scouts came to Cowlitz County to find an ideal terminus along the Columbia River. After a failed negotiation for a Donation Land Claim in Martin's Bluff, four miles south of Kalama, Northern Pacific officials purchased 700 acres in Kalama for the terminus of the new railroad as well as a new headquarters.

Kalama was unofficially incorporated on November 29, 1871. It served as the county seat of Cowlitz County from 1872 to 1922. Kalama was the northern terminus of a railroad ferry operated by the Northern Pacific Railway from Goble, Oregon. This was a critical link in rail service between 1883 when the service began until 1909 when the major rail bridges in Portland were completed.http://www.brian894x4.com/LewisandClarkExplorer.html  Active Short lines in the Pacific Northwest Kalama originated with a stake driven by Gen. John W. Sprague of the Northern Pacific Railway who in March 1870 selected a spot near the mouth of the Kalama river to mark the beginning point of Northern Pacific's Pacific Division. From that stake, the Northern Pacific began building north to Puget Sound, ultimately reaching Commencement Bay at what was to become Tacoma before going bankrupt. Construction began in April 1871 with a crew of 800 men, with the official 'first spike' being driven in May 1871 Scheduled service from Tacoma to Kalama began on January 5, 1874. The Portland-Hunters line was completed about the same time that the ceremonial spike was driven west of Helena, Montana to mark the completion of the transcontinental Northern Pacific Railroad in the fall of 1883. The following year in October 1884, a 3 track, long railroad ferry marked the beginning of 25 years of ferry service across the Columbia River. Hunters was located near the south end of Sandy Island about a mile south of Goble. However the crossing times were excessive when the Tacoma had to work against the tide, and the ferry slip was soon moved to Goble at the north end of Sandy Island and directly across from Kalama. The ferry could handle 12 passenger cars or 27 freight cars. Historic buildings St. Joseph's Catholic Parish, Kalama St. Joseph's Catholic Parish was built in 1874, around the same time the railroad between Kalama and Tacoma first became operational. This was the first and only Catholic Parish in Kalama. Geography According to Cowlitz County GIS data, the total incorporated area for the city of Kalama is 3.5 sq. miles.

At the 2010 census, the population was 11,925. Kelso is part of the Longview, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area, which has a population of 102,410. Kelso shares its long western border with Longview. It is near Mount St. Helens. History The earliest known inhabitants of Kelso were Native Americans from the Cowlitz tribe. The Cowlitz people were separated into the Upper (or Taidnapam) and Lower (or Mountain) Cowlitz tribes, who were members of the Sahaptin and Salish language families, respectively. In 1855, European explorers noted that there numbered over 6000 individuals of the Cowlitz Tribe. Kelso was founded by Peter W. Crawford, a Scottish surveyor, who, in 1847, took up the first donation land claim on the Lower Cowlitz River. Crawford platted a townsite which he named after his home town of Kelso, Scotland. The original plat was dated and filed in October 1884. It became incorporated in 1889. In its early days, Kelso obtained the nickname \\"Little Chicago\\" as it became famous for its large number of taverns and brothels that catered to local loggers. On weekends, trainloads of loggers would come into town from the surrounding region looking for women, liquor, gambling and fights. The FBI finally forced the mayor to shut them down in the 1950s with the last tavern/brothel closing in the mid-1960s. The economy continues to be based largely on wood products. In the late 19th century and into the first part of the 20th century, Kelso was the center for commercial smelt fishing on the Cowlitz River. In 1910, according to the Oregonian Newspaper, 5,000 tons of fish were caught. The Kelso Chamber of Commerce created the slogan in 1956 and became known as the Smelt Capital of the World.Co.cowlitz.wa.us CBR.washington.edu The Cowlitz River has historically had heavy runs of smelt and were shipped to markets around the country. Smelt numbers have declined significantly in the past several decades possibly due to overharvesting, global climate change and habitat loss. Pieces of the mysterious 1947 Maury Island incident took place in Kelso. A military aircraft carrying suspicious slag-like material, supposedly from a UFO, crashed in southeast Kelso. On May 18, 1980, being only away, Kelso residents experienced the shock wave caused by the eruption of Mt. St. Helens. Called the largest volcanic eruption in historic times in the contiguous United States, Kelso received large amounts of volcanic ash through the air and from the massive mudflow caused by the eruption transported by the Toutle and Cowlitz Rivers. Many areas of the city, including the Three Rivers Golf Course are built on volcanic ash dredged from the Cowlitz River by inmates in state custody and volunteers. In March 1998, the Aldercrest-Banyon landslide began shifting the foundations of 64 homes and local infrastructure in the east Kelso neighborhood of Aldercrest. Eventually, 129 houses were destroyed by this slow moving landslide. Investigation showed that these houses had been built on top of an ancient active landslide area, and three straight years of higher than average rains set the earth into motion. In October 1998, President Bill Clinton declared this slide a federal disaster. It was the second worst landslide disaster (in cost) in the United States, following the 1956 Portuguese Bend Landslide on Palos Verdes Hills in Southern California. This disaster at Aldercrest led to stricter city zoning ordinances and oversight over geological surveys. The Cowlitz County Historical Museum provides many exhibits on the history of the local area.

The population at the 2010 census was 13,190, a 129.1% increase on the 2000 census. As of 2019, the Office of Financial Management estimates that the current population was 14,219. On November 10, 2002, East Wenatchee was designated a principal city of the Wenatchee‚àíEast Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area by the Office of Management and Budget. History At the turn of the 20th Century irrigation projects, including the Columbia Basin Project east of the region, fostered the development of intensive agriculture in the shrub-steppe native to the region. Fruit orchards become one of the area's leading industries. In 1908, the first highway bridge to span the Columbia River opened. The privately owned bridge carried people, horses, wagons, and automobiles; it also supported two large water pipelines along its sides. It connected Chelan County on the Wenatchee shore with Douglas County on East Wenatchee shore. The bridge opened East Wenatchee and the rest of Douglas County to apple orchard development. Still standing today, the bridge is a pin-connected steel cantilever bridge and cost $177,000 to build. It once carried Sunset Highway (State Highway 2) across the river. The bridge was the brainchild of W. T. Clark, one of the builders of the Highline Canal, a major irrigation project to water the apple orchards in the valley. It was financed in part by James J. Hill (1838‚Äì1916), of the Great Northern Railway (which arrived in Wenatchee in 1892). In its second year of operation the canal firm that owned it decided to start charging tolls. This prompted local leaders to hasten to the state legislature to persuade the state to purchase the bridge as part of the state highway system. The state purchased the bridge despite the state-employed consultant's opinion \\"that the ugliness of the structure is very apparent\\" (Dorpat), despite defects in the timber floor and concrete piers, and despite leaks in the waterpipes. The structure remained in full use until 1950 when the George Sellar bridge was built. Today, it remains as a footbridge and still has the old pipeline running across it. From its foundation in agriculture, the region's economy has diversified to include year-round tourism and a variety of other industries. Founding On February 28, 1935, citizens voted, 48 in favor and 46 against, to incorporate the town of East Wenatchee.East Wenatchee Order of Incorporation When the town was incorporated on March 11, 1935, the original town site was . Through subsequent annexations, the town has grown into a city. Today, East Wenatchee's boundaries encompass . Landing of first trans-pacific airplane flight On October 5, 1931, East Wenatchee became part of aviation history. Having taken off from Misawa, Japan, pilots Clyde Pangborn and Hugh Herndon Jr. safely belly-landed their Bellanca airplane, Miss Veedol, on a nearby airstrip known then as Fancher Field. After take off, the pilots intentionally jettisoned the landing gear to conserve fuel. This flight was the first nonstop flight across the Pacific Ocean. In honor of this pioneering flight, East Wenatchee's airport is called Pangborn Memorial Airport, the Pangborn- Herndon Memorial Site, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is nearby, and Miss Veedols propeller is displayed in the Wenatchee Valley Museum & Cultural Center. Clovis points discovery On May 27, 1987, East Wenatchee became part of archaeological history. On that date, while digging in an orchard just east of the city, farmworkers accidentally discovered a cache of 11,000-year-old Clovis points and other artifacts, left there by Pleistocene hunters. The East Wenatchee Clovis Site, explored in two subsequent archaeological digs in 1988 and 1990, was closed to science by the landowner after protests by local Native American tribes. The legal moratorium on new archaeological work at the site ended on June 1, 2007. Other On January 8, 2007, East Wenatchee had a devastating wind storm with 100 MPH plus winds. The storm caused thousands of dollars worth of damage to homes, businesses, and city parks and many people went without power for days and even weeks.

The series Misterogers debuted in Canada on October 15, 1962, on CBC Television.A Friend in a Zippered Cardigan In 1966, Rogers moved back to the United States creating Misterogers' Neighborhood (sometimes shown as MisteRogers' Neighborhood), later called Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, on the regional Eastern Educational Television Network (EETN, a forerunner of today's American Public Television). The US national debut of the show occurred on February 19, 1968. It aired on NET and its successor, PBS, until August 31, 2001. The series is aimed primarily at preschool children ages 2 to 5, but it was labelled by PBS as \\"appropriate for all ages\\". Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was produced by Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public broadcaster WQED and Rogers' non-profit production company Family Communications, Inc., previously known as Small World Enterprises prior to 1971; the company was renamed The Fred Rogers Company after Rogers' death (it has since been renamed again to Fred Rogers Productions as of 2019). In May 1997, the series surpassed Captain Kangaroo as the longest-running children's television series, a record the series held until June 2003, when Sesame Street beat Mister Rogers record. The series could be seen in reruns on most PBS stations until August 31, 2007, when it began to be removed by various PBS stations, and was then permanently removed from the daily syndicated schedule by PBS after August 29, 2008. Eleven years after Mister Rogers' Neighborhood concluded, PBS debuted an animated spin-off, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood. A 50th-anniversary tribute show, hosted by actor Michael Keaton (who got his start on the show), titled Mister Rogers: It's You I Like, premiered on PBS stations nationwide on March 6, 2018. History Neighborhood Trolley from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood set at WQED studios in Pittsburgh. The series had its genesis in 1953, when Rogers and Josie Carey joined the newly formed public television station WQED. On April 5, 1954, WQED debuted The Children's Corner, a program featuring Rogers as puppeteer and composer with Carey as host and lyricist, in an unscripted weekday afternoon live television program. It was this program where many of the puppets, characters and music used in the later series were developed, such as King Friday XIII, Daniel Tiger, and X the Owl. It was also the time when Rogers began wearing his famous sneakers, as he found them to be quieter than his work shoes while he was moving about behind the set. The show won a Sylvania AwardSylvania Award page 1952-1958. Uv201.com. for best children's show, and was briefly broadcast nationally on the NBC Television Network. CBC Television Rogers moved to Toronto, Ontario, in 1961 to work on a new series based on The Children's Corner, called Misterogers, a 15-minute program on CBC Television. Misterogers aired on CBC for about four years and a number of the set pieces that he would take with him back to the United States, such as the trolley and castle, were created for the Canadian program by CBC designers and in collaboration with producer Bruce Attridge. Most importantly, Rogers appeared on camera in the new show rather than only appearing through puppets or characters. Fred Rainsberry, head of Children's Programming at CBC, persuaded Rogers to appear on camera in the new show (which he named after Rogers) after seeing him interact with children.. Ernie Coombs, one of the Americans whom Rogers brought with him to help develop the CBC show, would remain with CBC after Rogers returned to the United States. Coombs first appeared as Mr. Dressup in the CBC program Butternut Square, conceived and produced by Attridge. Coombs then helped to develop what became Mr. Dressup which ran for nearly 30 years, ending in 1996. Move to WQED In 1966, Rogers acquired the rights to his program from CBC and moved the show to WQED in Pittsburgh, where he had worked on The Children's Corner. He renamed the show Misterogers' Neighborhood, which initially aired regionally in the northeastern US through EEN, including educational stations in Boston, Washington, D.C., and New York City. The 100 episodes of the half-hour show incorporated the \\"Neighborhood of Make-Believe\\" segments from the CBC episodes with additional reality-based opening and closing material produced in Pittsburgh. The series was cancelled in 1967 due to lack of funding, but an outpouring of public response prompted a search for new funding. In 1967, The Sears Roebuck Foundation provided funding for the program, which enabled it to be seen nationwide on National Educational Television; taping began on September 21, 1967https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10155564537999651&id;=24044159650&fs;=5 for the first national season. The first national broadcast of Misterogers' Neighborhood appeared on most NET stations on February 19, 1968. In 1970, when PBS replaced NET, it also inherited this program. Around the same time the show had a slight title change, to the more-familiar Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. The show was broadcast from February 19, 1968 to February 20, 1976, and again from August 20, 1979 to August 31, 2001. The final episode was taped on December 1, 2000. The studio at WQED in Pittsburgh where the series was taped was later renamed \\"The Fred Rogers Studio\\". Format Rogers on the set in the late 1960s. During each half-hour segment, Rogers speaks directly to the viewer about various topics, taking the viewer on tours of factories, demonstrating experiments, crafts, and music, and interacting with his friends. Rogers also made a point to simply behave naturally on camera rather than acting out a character, stating that \\"One of the greatest gifts you can give anybody is the gift of your honest self. I also believe that kids can spot a phony a mile away.\\" The half-hour episodes were punctuated by a puppet segment chronicling occurrences in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Another segment of the show consisted of Rogers going to different places around the neighborhood, where he interviews people to talk about their work and other contributions that focused on the episode's theme, such as Brockett's Bakery, Bob Trow's Workshop, and Negri's Music Shop. In one episode, Rogers took the show behind-the-scenes on the set of The Incredible Hulk, which aired on CBS from 1978 to 1982. At the start of each episode, the show's logo appears as the camera pans slowly over a model of the neighborhood, while the \\"Neighborhood Trolley\\" crosses several streets from left to right as the text reads \\"Mister Rogers Talks About...\\", as the camera goes from the neighborhood to inside the Rogers' television house. From 1979 to 1981, an alternate version of the opening sequence was used. Usually, the camera goes from the neighborhood to out on the porch of the Rogers' television house, where the viewers see Fred Rogers coming for a visit before he enters the house. This is the same model electric trolley that later in the program will transport viewers into the Neighborhood of Make-Believe.. Retrieved March 29, 2011. After the camera goes from the neighborhood to inside the Rogers' television house, Fred Rogers is seen coming home with his jacket on, singing \\"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\\". He goes into the closet, takes off his jacket, hangs it up, and grabs a cardigan zipper sweater to put on. After that, he takes his dress shoes off and grabs a pair of blue sneakers to put on. One of Rogers' sweaters now hangs in the Smithsonian Institution, a testament to the cultural influence of his simple daily ritual. At the end of each episode, Rogers sang \\"It's Such a Good Feeling\\" (a different song, \\"Tomorrow\\" was used from 1968‚Äì72) when he took off his sneakers as he says \\"You're alive\\" in a higher toned voice, and grabs his dress shoes to put back on, and then snaps his fingers two times. After that, Rogers goes into the closet, takes off his cardigan, hangs it up, and grabs his jacket to put back on. Before the closing credits, Rogers got ready to go out the door by reminding the viewers: \\"You always make each day a special day. You know how: By just your being you/yourself. There's only one person in the whole world that's like you, and that's you. And people can like you just/exactly the way you are. I'll be back next time. Bye-bye!\\". During the closing credits, which is complete with the show's logo and the episode number, the camera would perform a reversed version of the opening sequence's pan shot, while the \\"Neighborhood Trolley\\" crosses streets from right to left. Starting in 1979, episodes were grouped into week-long series, with each series focused on a particular topic. Rogers' monologues throughout the week explore various facets of the topic, and the ongoing story from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe serves as illustration. Rogers covered a broad range of topics over the years, and the series did not shy away from issues that other children's programming avoided. In fact, Rogers endeared himself to many when, on March 23, 1970, he dealt with the death of one of his pet goldfish. The series also dealt with competition, divorce, and war. Rogers returned to the topic of anger regularly and focused on peaceful ways of dealing with angry feelings. Beginning in the third season, Mister Rogers always made a clear distinction between the realistic world of his television neighborhood and the fantasy world of Make-Believe (prior to that, the line was blurred somewhat as he would often talk about it as if it were real and he had a direct line of contact with the characters in it). He often discussed what was going to happen in Make-Believe before the next fantasy segment was shown (\\"Let's pretend that Prince Tuesday has been having scary dreams...\\"), and sometimes acted out bits of Make-Believe with models on a table before the camera transitioned to the live-action puppet rendition. The miniature motorized trolley, which was known in character form as \\"Trolley\\", with its accompanying fast-paced piano theme music, was the only element that appeared regularly in both the realistic world and Make-Believe: it was used to transport viewers from one realm to the other. Rogers, however, was mentioned from time to time in Make-Believe, particularly by Mr. McFeely, who appeared occasionally in the Make-Believe segments and seemed to form a link between the two worlds. The idea of the trolley came from Rogers. When he was young, many trolleys operated in Pittsburgh, and he liked riding on them. This reality/fantasy distinction put Rogers' series in sharp contrast with other children's series, such as Sesame Street and Captain Kangaroo, which freely mixed realistic and fantastic elements. Trolley was a character in its own right. Often when it crossed into the Neighborhood of Make Believe, it would stop and have a \\"conversation\\" with King Friday XIII (by moving back and forth slightly and making bell noises to respond to Friday) then continue on. Trolley also truly showed the difference between the worlds during the week when the three youngest puppet characters (Daniel Striped Tiger, Prince Tuesday, and Ana Platypus) prepared for and went to school for the first time, as it played the school bus. When in Mister Rogers' house, it simply had two pieces of yellow construction paper shaped and drawn like the profile of a school bus stuck to its sides, but in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, it had a chassis on it that made it look like a school bus. The series featured \\"Picture Picture\\", a rear-projection motion picture and slide projector, whose screen is encased with a picture frame. In early episodes, Picture Picture would show various films or slides at Mister Rogers' command; after the material was presented, Mister Rogers would thank Picture Picture, to which it would return a \\"You're Welcome\\" on its screen. After 1970, Picture Picture no longer operated magically, becoming merely a projector; Mister Rogers would insert a film, slides or videotape through a slot on the side, then show the material using a wired remote control. When Picture Picture was not used, a different painting would be displayed on its screen. Often it would display the words \\"Hello\\" or \\"Hi\\" at the opening. The series was also notable for its use of jazz-inspired music, mostly arranged and performed by Johnny Costa, until Costa's death in 1996, when he was succeeded by Michael Moricz for the remainder of the series. The music was unique in its simplicity and flow that blended with the series' sketches and features. The music was usually played live during taping. Lyrics and melodies were written and sung by Rogers, who created more than 200 original songs.

Only Mr. McFeely, Mrs. McFeely, Officer Clemons, Scientist Adler, and Chef Brockett appeared substantially the same way in both Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood and the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Neighborhood of Make-Believe The \\"Neighborhood of Make-Believe\\" is the fictional kingdom visited by Mr. Rogers during the show. Characters in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe were portrayed by both hand puppets and actors. Fred Rogers was the puppeteer for a great number of the characters: * Collette * Cornflake S. Pecially * Daniel Strip√®d Tiger * Donkey Hodie * Edgar Cooke * Grandp√®re Tiger * Henrietta Pussycat * Ino A. Horse * King Friday XIII * Lady Elaine Fairchilde * Mrs. Frogg * Princess Margeret H. Lizard * Queen Sara Saturday * Tadpole Frogg * X the Owl Other characters and their performers or puppeteers: * Anna Platypus * Betty Okonak Templeton-Jones * Bob Dog * Cousin Mary Owl * Cousin Steven Owl * Dr. Duckbill Platypus * Elsie Jean Platypus * Harriett Elizabeth Cow * H.J. Elephant III * Hula Mouse * James Michael Jones * Prince Tuesday * Purple Panda * Robert Troll In addition to Bob Trow other regular puppeteers included Michael Horton, Lenny Meledandri (1980‚Äì2001), and Carole Switala. Michael Keaton made his first television role as a volunteer in 1975. He played an acrobat in a troupe called The Flying Zookeenies that performed for King Friday's birthday and was also in charge of running the Trolley. Operas Thirteen in-series \\"operas\\" took place during the course of the series within the Make-Believe segments. Many of them featured American baritone John Reardon as a main character. The operas would encompass the entire episode and would be seen after a brief introduction by Mr. Rogers. # Babysitter Opera (1968) # Campsite Opera (1968) # Teddy Bear/Whaling Ship Opera (1969) # \\"Pineapples and Tomatoes\\" (1970) # \\"Monkey's Uncle\\" (1971) # \\"Snow People and Warm Pussycat\\" (1972) # \\"Potato Bugs and Cows\\" (1973) # \\"All in the Laundry\\" (1974) # \\"Key to Otherland\\" (1975) # \\"Windstorm in Bubbleland\\" (1980) # \\"Spoon Mountain\\" (1982) # \\"A Granddad for Daniel\\" (1984) # \\"A Star for Kitty\\" (1986) Additionally, a play, Josephine The Short-Necked Giraffe, first aired in 1989 as a tribute to the late John Reardon. Guests Guests on the series ranged from cellist Yo-Yo Ma to actor and bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno of TV's The Incredible Hulk (in a 2001 piece where celebrities were asked about their heroes, Rogers cited Ma as one of his heroes). A 1968 visit by electronic music pioneer Bruce Haack resurfaced in the 2004 documentary Haack: King of Techno. Guests on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood were often surprised to find that although Rogers was just as gentle and patient in life as on television, he was nevertheless a perfectionist who did not allow \\"shoddy\\" ad-libbing; he believed that children were thoughtful people who deserved programming as good as anything produced for adults on television. Rogers appeared as a guest on some other series. On the children's animated cartoon series Arthur, for example, Rogers plays himself as an aardvark like Arthur. Later on, Arthur appears as a guest in hand-puppet form in a 1999 episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Bill Nye, host of a science- themed program, and Rogers also exchanged appearances on each other's series, as did Rogers and Captain Kangaroo. Rogers additionally appeared in an episode of Sesame Street, where he explains to Big Bird that even if one loses a running race such as the one Big Bird had run against his friend \\"Snuffy\\", no hard feelings threaten to break the two of them apart.Sesame Street, Episode #1575 Aired May 22, 1981 Big Bird himself also appeared in one episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe when he came to deliver his entry to the \\"Draw the Neighborhood\\" art contest. Funding Senate Subcommittee on Communications on May 1, 1969, explaining how his series was funded and convincing senators to further fund PBS. * N.E.T. affiliated stations children's program fund (1968‚Äì70) * The Sears-Roebuck Foundation (1968‚Äì76, 1979‚Äì92) * Corporation for Public Broadcasting (1971‚Äì76, 1991‚Äì2001) * Bureau of Education for the Handicapped (1975) * Ford Foundation (1975‚Äì76) * Johnson & Johnson (1975‚Äì76) * Office of Education (1974‚Äì75) * Public Television Stations (1975‚Äì76, 1979‚Äì2001) After the series When Fred Rogers died in 2003, PBS's website provided suggestions to parents on how to respond to children who ask about Rogers' death. Beginning September 3, 2007, some PBS affiliates began replacing the show with new programs such as Super Why!, WordGirl and WordWorld. In June 2008, PBS announced that, beginning in late 2008, it would stop broadcasting Mister Rogers' Neighborhood as part of its daily syndication lineup to member stations, instead airing the program only once a week over the weekend. Milwaukee PBS, for example, still carries the show once a week, on Sunday, over its primary HD/SD channel. Beginning on September 1, 2008, Mister Rogers was replaced by new programming such as Martha Speaks, Sid the Science Kid, and an update of The Electric Company. However, individual member stations have the option of airing Mister Rogers independently of the PBS syndicated feed, with series home WQED in particular continuing to air the series daily until 2010. There was a campaign in 2008 and 2009 to urge PBS and all member stations to bring the show back seven days a week. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the series' national premiere, PBS aired select episodes of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood for a week in February 2018. Animated spin-off In July 2011, during the annual Television Critics Association summer press tour, it was announced that a new animated spinoff series, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, was in production. The show debuted on most PBS stations on September 3, 2012. The series features Daniel Tiger, the four-year-old son of Daniel Striped Tiger, as a host of the series, which also features characters of the Neighborhood of Make-Believe all grown older, with the children now having families of their own. Music and regular songs=Regular songs The song \\"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\\" was written by Fred Rogers in 1967 and was used as the opening theme for each episode of the show. In the first three seasons of the show, during which new episodes were constantly being produced, each show ended with the song \\"Tomorrow\\", which was written by Rogers' former colleague, Josie Carey. Starting with Season 4 in 1971, \\"Tomorrow\\" was used only on Monday through Thursday episodes, and a new closing song, which is titled as \\"The Weekend Song\\", was used only on Friday episodes as the program would not return until Monday. Eventually, the \\"Tomorrow\\" song was removed entirely due to copyright issues, and by 1973, Rogers sang \\"It's Such a Good Feeling\\" at the end of each episode. Prior to 1973, the original version of \\"It's Such a Good Feeling\\" was used as part of Mister Rogers' general repertoire of songs. When \\"It's Such a Good Feeling\\" became the closing theme for Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in 1973, it used a rewrite of \\"The Weekend Song\\" at the end, using only the first four lines: \\"And I'll be back when the day is new, and I'll have more ideas for you. And you'll have things you'll want to talk about; I will too\\". This was only used on Monday through Thursday episodes. On Friday episodes, the lyric was changed to \\"week\\" instead of \\"day\\". On early episodes of this season, the line was originally written as \\"When tomorrow is new\\". Music Musical directors for the series include: *Johnny Costa (1968‚Äì96) *Michael Moricz, who took over as music director after Costa's death and served until the end of the series in 2001. In addition to arranging and directing the music heard on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Costa, along with other musicians, performed almost all the background music heard on the series, including the show's recognizable main theme, the trolley whistle, Mr. McFeeley's frenetic speedy delivery piano plonks, the vibraphone flute-toots (played on a synthesizer) as Fred fed his fish, dreamy celesta lines, incidental music, and Rogers' entrance and exit tunes. Each day an episode was taped, Costa and his ensemble played live in the studio for the filming. Musicians who played in this ensemble were: *Johnny Costa ‚Äì Piano, Celesta, Synthesizer, & Trolley Whistle *Joe Negri ‚Äì Guitar *Carl McVicker Jr. ‚Äì Double Bass *Bobby Rawsthorne ‚Äì Drums & PercussionPITTSBURGH JAZZ RECORDS AND BEYOND, 1950-1985. (PDF). Even after Costa's death in 1996, much of the music heard on the program continued to be Costa's and his name continued to be listed in the show's closing credits as one of its Musical Directors. Broadcast history The first broadcast of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was on the National Educational Television network on February 19, 1968; the color NET logo appeared on a model building at the beginning and end of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood from 1969 to 1970. When NET ceased operations, the series moved its successor network PBS, even though episodes up until the end of the fourth season in May 1971 were still copyrighted by and produced for NET.. Accessed 08-09-09. The series' first season (1968) consisted of 130 episodes, produced in black-and- white. For seasons 2‚Äì8 (1969‚Äì75), the show produced 65 new color episodes each year. By the end of season 8, this meant there was a library of 455 color episodes which could be repeated indefinitely. Rogers and the rest of the show's cast and crew began suffering burnout from taping 65 episodes a year and in 1975, Rogers made the decision to take a break from the series for a few years. As a consequence, season 9 (1976) consisted of only five episodes. These five new episodes (which aired the final week of original episodes of the so-called \\"first series\\") featured Mister Rogers in his workshop, watching scenes of past episodes of his series, which he recorded on videocassettes and kept on the shelf in his workshop. On the Friday episode of that week (February 20, 1976), he reminded viewers that they, too, could watch many of those old episodes beginning the following week. During the hiatus period, two primetime episodes were produced and aired as specials: a Christmas show in December 1977 and a \\"springtime\\"-themed show in June 1979. In 1978, production of the series resumed, with an eye towards \\"freshening up\\" the show by producing 15 new episodes per year. These \\"second series\\" episodes, which began airing in August 1979, would be mixed in with the already-airing cycle of repeats from the so-called \\"first series\\" (i.e., the color episodes of seasons 2‚Äì9, aired from 1969‚Äì76). The series aired 15 new episodes annually between 1979 and 1993. As well, there were occasional \\"Mister Rogers Talks with Parents About...\\" specials, which featured panelists discussing ways in which parents could talk to their children about the issues discussed on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. These specials were usually aired on weekends, just prior to the airing of a new batch of Monday-to-Friday episodes. Beginning in 1994, the production schedule was changed so that 10 new episodes a year were produced instead of 15. Shortly thereafter, as of August 11, 1995, the episodes from the \\"first series\\" (1968‚Äì76) were withdrawn from the repeat schedule, since there were over 200 \\"second series\\" episodes available for broadcast, and many of the first series episodes had become outdated. The show's final years varied the number of episodes produced per season: season 26 (1995‚Äì96) consisted of 20 episodes, season 27 (1997) produced 10 episodes, seasons 28 and 29 (1998‚Äì99) both contained 15 episodes, and season 30 (2000) reverted to 10 episodes. The final season, season 31 (2001), consisted of only 5 episodes, centering on the theme \\"Celebrate The Arts\\". A few episodes from the \\"first series\\" are available for viewing in the Paley Center for Media, including the first episode of the series and the first color episode. A complete collection of episodes, including more than 900 videotapes and scripts from the show along with other promotional materials produced by Rogers or his Family Communications Inc. production company, exists in the University of Pittsburgh's Mister Rogers' Neighborhood Archives located in the Elizabeth Nesbitt Room in the university's School of Information Sciences Building. Reruns When PBS began re-airing the first 460 color episodes of the series in 1976, some of the earliest color episodes from 1969 and 1970 were re-edited with new voice-overs or footage. For example, in one 1970 episode where Mister Rogers demonstrates the noise-proof ear protectors that airport workers use on the tarmac, the film footage used featured a worker directing a United Airlines jet with its stylized \\"U\\" logo‚Äîwhich was not introduced until 1974. All of the episodes revised from the first series also included an extra segment following the closing credits, mentioning the episode number and additional companies that provided funding since these episodes originally aired, even though they had not provided funding at the time of original production. The black and white episodes of the first season were last re-run on August 21, 1970, just before NET was replaced by PBS. , almost all of the 1979‚Äì2001 \\"second series\\" episodes are still in active rotation on a number of PBS stations.Mister Rogers' Neighborhood schedule on MPTV Retrieved October 14, 2013KET ‚Äì Mister Rogers' Neighborhood ‚Äì Series Information Retrieved October 14, 2013Mister Rogers Neighborhood ‚Äì TV ‚Äì Oregon Public Broadcasting Retrieved October 14, 2013 The only exception is the week- long \\"Conflict\\" series (episodes #1521‚Äì#1525), first aired during the week of November 7‚Äì11, 1983. The series/story arc covered the topics of war, bombs, and an arms race, and was created in response to the Invasion of Grenada, and the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. The \\"Conflict\\" series was last aired on PBS during the week of April 1‚Äì5, 1996. Only a few episodes of the series have been released to DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment, although some earlier compilation-based releases were issued on VHS by Playhouse Video during the mid-1980s. 100 episodes have subsequently been released as part of Amazon Video.''Amazon Video: Mister Rogers Neighborhood''. Amazon.com. A DVD set titled the It's a Beautiful Day Collection, containing 30 episodes from the second series, was released on March 27, 2018 by PBS. =Twitch marathons= On May 11, 2017, streaming video platform Twitch announced with The Fred Rogers Company that all 886 episodes of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood would be streamed live on the Internet over an 18-day period (although several episodes were skipped over during the marathon, most notably the 1983 \\"Conflict\\" episodes). The marathon began on May 15, 2017, at noon PT and ended on June 3, 2017. The marathon included many Mister Rogers episodes that had only aired once before. During the live stream, viewers were encouraged to support their local PBS station. Mister Rogers' Neighborhood joined other popular PBS shows, including The Joy of Painting and The French Chef, that have been streamed on the Twitch service. On March 20, 2018, Twitch began streaming a 90-episode marathon to commemorate Rogers' 90th birthday, followed by a repeat marathon of the series. EpisodesSpecials A prime time Christmas special, Christmastime with Mister Rogers, first aired in 1977. This special had Fran√ßois Clemmons introducing a storyteller and flutist friend to Rogers. They filmed several narrated segments of the stories Fran√ßois' friend told. The special also had the Neighborhood of Make-Believe segment which shows how they celebrated Christmas. The trolley had a banner on the roof that said \\"Merry Christmas\\" on one side, and \\"Happy Hannukah\\" on the other. This special was aired every Christmas season until 1982. This special's opening and close have Rogers walking through a real neighborhood while the titles roll rather than the model neighborhood used in the series. In 1994, Rogers created another one-time special for PBS called Fred Rogers' Heroes which consisted of documentary portraits of four real-life people whose work helped make their communities better. Rogers, uncharacteristically dressed in a suit and tie, hosted in wraparound segments that did not use the \\"Neighborhood\\" set. For a time Rogers produced specials for the parents as a precursor to the subject of the week on the Neighborhood called \\"Mister Rogers Talks To Parents About [topic]\\". Rogers did not host those specials, though; other people like Joan Lunden, who hosted the \\"Conflict\\" special, and other news announcers played MC duties in front of a gallery of parents while Rogers answered questions from them. These specials were made to prepare the parents for any questions the children might ask after watching the episodes on that topic of the week. Mister Rogers: It's You I Like On March 6, 2018, a primetime special commemorating the 50th anniversary of the series aired on PBS, hosted by actor Michael Keaton. The hour-long special also features interviews by musician Yo- Yo Ma, musician Itzhak Perlman, actress Sarah Silverman, actress Whoopi Goldberg, actor John Lithgow, screenwriter Judd Apatow, actor David Newell, producer Ellen Doherty, and spouse Joanne Byrd Rogers, as well as clips of memorable moments from the show, such as Rogers visiting Koko the gorilla, Margaret Hamilton dressing up as The Wizard of Oz's Wicked Witch of the West, and Jeff Erlanger in his wheelchair singing \\"It's You I Like\\" with Rogers. Earlier PBS specials include Our Neighbor, Fred Rogers in 1990 and Fred Rogers: America's Favorite Neighbor in 2003. A short special, Mister Rogers in Our Neighborhood by PBS station WUCF, described Fred Rogers's college years and family connections in Florida. Tributes Over the years, many television shows, exhibits and attractions have been named in tribute to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. After three years as a traveling exhibit, the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh had \\"Welcome to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\\" installed as a permanent exhibit in 2004. The planetarium show \\"The Sky Above Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\\" is a computer-animated adaptation of the television show for preschool-aged children. Idlewild and Soak Zone, an amusement park near Rogers' hometown of Latrobe, Pennsylvania has an attraction called \\"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood of Make-Believe\\" featuring a life-size trolley ride, designed by Rogers. This was shut down in 2014 to reopen as Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood in 2015.Idlewild and Soak Zone // In the Park A children's play area at Monroeville Mall in the Pittsburgh suburb of Monroeville was named for the television show. Many of the artifacts from the set of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, including the tree of X the owl, the make- believe neighborhood and the inside entrance to Mister Rogers' home is on display at the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh. Also included is a life- size figure of Mister Rogers and a sweater he wore on the show. A kiosk containing artifacts used during the series is located on Concourse C of Pittsburgh International Airport, near the children's play area.\\"Mister Rogers back at Pittsburgh Int‚Äôl Airport\\" Stuck at the Airport, published February 24, 2009. Retrieved March 17, 2012. The Mister Rogers' Neighborhood Archives at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Information Sciences is an academic resource and collection that contains correspondence, scripts, props, puppets, fan mail, 911 tapes including all but four episodes of the series on 3/4-inch production videotape; plus one on VHS (three other episodes are not in the collection) along with various videos of specials, interviews and scholarly articles that show the cultural impact of Fred Rogers' work. A statue of Fred Rogers exists on the North Shore of the Allegheny River near Heinz Field at the surviving footing of the Manchester Bridge. The original trolley from the shows is on display at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto, Ontario. A documentary feature film about the series, titled Won't You Be My Neighbor?, was released by Focus Features on June 8, 2018. Another documentary, Mister Rogers & Me, was shown at film festivals in 2010 and on PBS stations in 2012. An American drama film, titled A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood starring Tom Hanks as Rogers, was released on November 22, 2019 by TriStar Pictures. On September 21, 2018, a Google Doodle was created in honor of Mr. Rogers. Music The music of the show was interpreted by an eclectic mix of modern artists for the 2005 album Songs From the Neighborhood: The Music of Mister Rogers. The YouTube show Pittsburgh Dad uses a piano theme song inspired by the jazz music constantly heard on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. The musical project Symphony of Science, in association with PBS Digital Studios, created a music video called \\"Garden of Your Mind\\" from clips of the show, using Rogers' own pitch-corrected spoken words to create a song.

It is part of the Wenatchee-East Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 320 at the 2010 census. History R.E. Darling named Mansfield in 1905 after his hometown of Mansfield, Ohio. Mansfield's land was purchased and first developed in 1909 by the Great Northern Railway. Mansfield was officially incorporated on February 23, 1911.http://www.mansfieldwashington.org/history/ Official Town Website. Retrieved 2010-07-06 Fires By 1914, the town had grown substantially, and had acquired two hotels, a bank, a doctor's office, and many more amenities. What had started as a town based on agriculture and the railroad had grown into a popular resort destination. In June 1914, a fire broke out in Mansfield's Knox Store, known as \\"Mansfield's greatest store\\". The fire was pushed by the wind and spread over both sides of the first block Mansfield's Main Street. The fire caused roughly $200,000 US in damage. In November of the same year, fire destroyed the second block of Main Street. After the fires, town ordinace was passed requiring all new buildings within certain areas of the town to be built of fire-proof materials. In 1922, the Cross Hotel, owned by contractor Robert Cross, burned to the ground. The hotel was one of Mansfield's greatest attractions, and was considered to be one of the best hotels in all of North Central Washington. Though his hotel was lost, many of the houses built by Cross are still in use today. The Great Depression Mansfield's economy continued to grow throughout the years leading up to the Great Depression. The town's enormous amount of wheat production proved very lucrative, and the town continued to grow. In the mid-1920s, a terrible drought hit Mansfield and the surrounding area. That, along with the beginnings of the Great Depression, caused many people to leave Mansfield in search of work. After the Depression and Mansfield Today The town's crops and economy eventually recovered, but the damage had been done. Mansfield would never fully return to what it once was. The railroad eventually closed its service depot in Mansfield. In the 1950s, the train station was sold off and moved. Finally, in the 1980s, the railroad departed from Mansfield for the last time. The railroad was no longer able to serve the communities it passed through in Central Washington. The rails were dismantled, leaving Mansfield as \\"the town at the end of the rails\\". Today, Mansfield is still a town based on agriculture. The town's grain elevators process around 1.7 million bushels of wheat annually. Geography Mansfield is located at (47.812967, -119.640096).

It is part of the Wenatchee-East Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 788 at the 2010 census. History Rock Island was officially incorporated on November 3, 1930. The area of Rock Island was used by Native American tribes for fishing and crossing of the Columbia River due to the nearby Rock Island Rapids prior to settlement of the Washington Territory. The site had been previously settled in the late 19th century and was known as Hammond; early maps sometimes show the city as Hammond P.O. (Post Office) or Power City. In the teacup valley in which Rock Island is currently located, two men, Ingraham and McBride, opened a trading post in the early 1860s. Their patrons were local Native Americans, who often fished that stretch of the Columbia when the fish were running.* Marshall, Maureen E. Wenatchee's Dark Past. Wenatchee, Wash: The Wenatchee World, 2008. The two pioneering men would later move their post to the mouth of the Wenatchee River, leaving little trace of their stay. The most notable figure in Rock Island's founding is James E. Keane. As the first permanent settler to the Rock Island area, James Keane arrived with a crew of men in 1887. Keane planned to build a home and improve the land that he had acquired through the Homestead, Pre-emption, and Desert Acts. Four years later, the Great Northern Railroad made its first survey of the area and began construction toward the valley from the east. One half mile upriver from the well-known Rock Island Rapids, Mr. Keane platted a townsite he named Hammond.http://www.douglaspud.org/Community/TheCityofRockIsland.aspx Hammond was located nearly 2.5 miles south of the present site of the City of Rock Island due to changes in planning by the Great Northern Railway. Keane moved his townsite to this new area and named it Rock Island, named aptly for the rock islands in the Columbia River near the site. Between 1891 and 1893, Rock Island became a town of considerable importance for the railroad. The mammoth steel bridge that was built across the Columbia drew many laborers to the area, and the small town boomed. Several stores popped up to meet the needs of the workers, and the Rock Island Sun newspaper began publication. The site was thought to be the area where the large city of the area would develop as it was located near the Rock Island Rapids and near the bridge which spanned the Columbia River for the Great Northern Railway. Despite these strategic advantages, the large city in the area would become Wenatchee, just seven miles upriver from the site of present-day Rock Island. In 1893, however, the completion of that first bridge across the Columbia marked the downfall of Rock Island. With few jobs in town to entice them, the employees of the railroad moved away. In 1930, Rock Island boomed again when the Puget Sound Power and Light Company began construction of a dam just below the Rock Island Rapids. The project was estimated at 10 million dollars and the Rock Island Dam was to be the first dam on the Columbia River. On November 3, 1930, with the construction of the dam in full swing, Rock Island was officially incorporated as a Washington state town, with a population of 421 residents. The town boomed for a second time in its history as workers for the dam project created temporary villages near the town, but it could not last. When two of the dam's generators began producing power in 1931, and the final spillway was closed in 1932, Rock Island again faced a bust and a loss of residents. Many Native American pictographs were destroyed with the construction of the Rock Island Dam. A small sampling of pictographs saved prior to the construction of Rock Island Dam can be seen at the Wenatchee Valley Museum & Cultural Center in nearby Wenatchee. During World War II a silicon smelter would be built in the town of Rock Island, closing in 1999. Rock Island was also home to a nearby state park, appearing on maps until the late 1940s.

The population was 1,073 at the 2010 census, a 12.5% increase over the 2000 Census. It is the county seat of Ferry County. It was the largest mining camp in the Republic mining District, and home to the \\"Hot Air Line\\" railway. Geography Republic is located at (48.648159, ‚àí118.734947). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Republic is located near the source of the Sanpoil River in a long graben valley bordered by the Okanagan Highlands to the west and the Kettle mountain range to the east. Curlew Lake, long (Elev: ), provides fishing and boating to summer visitors northeast of Republic. Swan Lake is small mountain lake to the south of Republic and also serves to be a popular lake for local residents and tourists to visit. Republic is surrounded by the Colville National Forest and to the south is the Colville Indian Reservation. History Republic Mill Republic Mining District Republic was founded by gold prospectors in the late 19th century. Mining claims were first made along Eureka Creek on March 1, 1896, after the northern half of the Colville Indian Reservation was vacated on February 21. On March 5, 1896, the Republic claim was staked by Thomas Ryan and Philip Creasor along Granite Creek, another branch of the Sanpoil River. The resulting Republic Mine eventually became the highest producer of gold in the county. On April 18 1896, the Republic Mining District, originally called the Eureka Mining District, was established. The first ore mill for processing low grade ore in the district was constructed in May, 1898, while highest grade ores were hauled east to Marcus, Washington partway by cart and then via the Spokane Falls & Northern branch line for the remaining distance. Between 1899 and 1900 stamp mills were constructed at the Mountain Lion mine in the Northwest part of camp and the Republic Mine in the south resulting in a brief period where all of the districts ore was milled in the camp. The Mountain Lion Gold Mining company 100-ton mill used a combination of mercury plate amalgamation followed by MacArthur-Forrest cyanide leaching. However due to much lower gold and silver recovery rates, combined with the soon to arrive rail lines, the mill was soon shut down. The 200-ton Republic mill processed the ore by first roasting of the finely crushed ore, and then cyanide leaching, with the first loads of ore being processed in October 1900. In July 1901 the Republic mine and mill both shut down due to milling cost, and a lack of enough profitable ore being recovered. Ores in the Republic District were noted to have increasing percentages of silver concentration in the lower portions of the ore bodies, and the Republic mill did not provide more then a 50% return on assayed ore value, dooming the mill. The Republic mine remained inactive until 1902 when the arrival of railroads in the town made mining profitable again. From 1902 to 1909 ore was freighted north to British Columbia and then west to smelters on the coast for processing, with periods where shipments up to of ore a week were regular. The Republic mining District encompassing Republic and the surrounding areas, had no defined borders as of 1909 when the young geologist Joseph B. Umpleby visited, but included six townships with a center \\"a little west of the south end of Curlew Lake\\". At the time of the visit Republic was the most important mining camp in the county and the largest with an population of around 1,500. Eureka to Republic Eureka Gulch in 1910 with the Great Northern railbeds in the center and the \\"Hot Air Line\\" in the fore-ground In July 1897, Philip Creasor built a two-story hotel at the townsite, originally called Eureka. This town site was platted on April 29 1898, and the post office name changed to Republic, since there was already a post office named Eureka in the state of Washington. On May 8 1900, a special election was held which approved incorporation of Republic, and J.J. Sullivan was elected mayor. The town was then officially incorporated on May 22 1900, and had a population of about 1800. Two separate rail lines granted access to the area, Great Northern Railways Spokane Falls & Northern branch line and the locally owned Republic and Kettle Valley Railway, commonly called the \\"Hot air line\\" from Grand Forks, British Columbia. The \\"Hot Air Line\\" Schoepfia republicensis leaf fossil, Stonerose collections The Spokane and British Columbia Railway, originally the Republic and Kettle Valley Railway, was a short lived standard- gauge private rail company based out of Republic operating between Republic, Grand Forks and Lynch Creek British Columbia. The line was locally known as the \\"Hot Air line\\". The line began operation in 1902 as the Republic and Kettle Valley Railway, before being bought out in 1916. The company was initially incorporated in 1901 with J. Stratton as president, with construction of the line between Republic and danville, Washington at the United States-Canadian border being contracted to the Republic and Grand Forks Construction Company, itself owned by Stratton. The rail line paralleled the Great Northern spur line from Republic through Malo and Curlew, Washington to Danville. The northern line was initially surveyed by the Republic and Kettle River company, but they were forced to build on higher ground beyond the Great Northern land boundaries. On January 2, 1902 the railroad was also approved by the Secretary of the Interior to conduct surveying for a southern line though the Colville Indian Reservation along the Sanpoil River. Modern Library, Wild West Farm and Garden, and Catholic church in Republic Republic's prominence, initially brought on by the gold rush, started to fade as prospectors and those who supported the mining industry moved away. During the years between 1900 and 1910, the town lost over half its population. Despite this, mining has continued to be an important part of life in Republic, as gold is still mined for in the mountains surrounding the town. Mining is celebrated in the local Prospector's Days, held during the second weekend in June, where locals honor their prospector roots by competing in mining and logging competitions, panning for gold, and watching an old west gun fight. Today, the town of 1,100 is sustained mainly by those people in surrounding farms and ranches, miners who work at the local mine, and tourists looking for a quieter, slower pace of life. The town is the county seat of Ferry County. At the Ferry County Fairgrounds, located east of town on State Route 20, is the Ferry County Carousel originally built between 1895 and 1900. Republic is also home to the Stonerose Interpretive Center and Fossil Site, famous for the Eocene fossils found in a 49 mya Klondike Mountain Formation lake bed at the north end of Republic. Several extinct plants found in the lake beds have been named in honor of Republic, including Acer republicense a maple, Republica hickeyi and Schoepfia republicensis both extinct flowering plants, Rhus republicensis a sumac, and Ulteramus republicensis a sawfly. Economy Republic has many businesses that line Clark Ave (the main street through town) including Anderson's Grocery, which was established over a hundred years ago. Ferry County Memorial Hospital is the largest employer in the county. Climate Republic experiences a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb) with cold winters, warm summers and fairly even precipitation year-round, with a drying trend in summer, though there is a secondary uptick in rainfall from April thru June, unlike in much of the rest of the state.

The population was 1,092 at the 2010 census, up from 968 at the 2000 census. History The town of Basin City was laid out in the 1950s on land owned by dry-land farmer Loen Bailie. The town was established to support the local agricultural community which was being opened to irrigation through the Columbia Basin Project. The new settlers to the area consisted primarily of young farmers from Idaho and southwestern Oregon and World War II veterans, who received preferential status on the purchase of federal lands that were sold as part of the project. Early crops included sugar beets, alfalfa, corn, asparagus, wheat and barley. Later, potatoes, beans, carrots, and onions also became important, while sugar beet production stopped due to closure of a local sugar beet plant. A large number of orchards were planted, and the area is now a major supplier of the famous Washington apples. Cherries and other fruits are also produced locally. Geography Basin City is located in northwestern Franklin County at (46.591416, -119.149325). As the name implies, it lies in a basin. The land west of the town slopes gradually downward for about then rises abruptly by about at Basin Hill. Basin Hill extends about southwest of town to the Columbia River, where it forms the southern extent of the \\"White Bluffs\\" for which the town of White Bluffs was named. Basin Hill also extends to the north, where it is called Sage Hill and then rises a bit higher at Radar Hill, named for an old World War II radar base installed at the peak.

The population was 4,209 at the 2010 census. The Washington State Office of Financial Management's 2018 estimate placed the population at 5,566. History Prior to 1883 the area now known as Connell was used by ranchers as open range for cattle and horses. The community was established in 1883 as a junction between the Northern Pacific Railroad and the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company. The new town was called Palouse Junction by Jacob Cornelius Connell, a railroad official and resident. Palouse Junction was unique on the Ainsworth to Spokane run, in that it was not on a river. It was also the gateway to the Palouse via the OR&N;'s line to Washtucna. Water for trains and for the town was from public wells dug by the railroad. At some time between 1886 and 1900, the town was renamed to Connell. The Northern Pacific Railroad ceased service to the station in 1890,http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=7452 but the Union Pacific Railroad took over the station in 1901, and the town began to grow again. A school district was formed sometime between 1900 and 1904. In 1902 the Franklin County Bank was Incorporated in Connell, and the Connell Land and Improvement Company was established. Also in that year, the county allowed a franchisee to begin piping in water for the town (Although this was never very successful, and the following year a good well hit water at 268 feet). In 1903, lots on the west side of the tracks were sold, and a new commercial district began to grow, and a number of existing buildings were even moved to these new lots. By this time the town rivaled Pasco in importance in Franklin County. Unfortunately, much of the business district was destroyed by fire in July, 1905. The destroyed sections were quickly rebuilt using brick. Connell was officially incorporated on November 28, 1910. Dryland wheat farming was the lifeblood of Connell through most of the twentieth century. Today The primary industrial base is food processing, agricultural chemicals and a minimum and medium-security correctional facility that is capable of holding 2600 offenders. The community is also home to the North Franklin School District where there is a high school, junior high, grade school and administration offices. Both the state and county have transportation facilities in the community. The community has many well maintained parks. The city also has a pool which was recently remodeled. City athletic fields range from general purpose open space, to soccer and baseball fields. The city has purchased additional water rights and has water for future growth in residential, commercial and industrial activities. A new wastewater treatment facility was completed. New waterlines were installed to replace aging pipes. During the last ten years, the city has rebuilt Columbia Avenue, the main thoroughfare, and reconstructed its industrial streets, and received a grant award to reconstruct a portion of Clark Street. This roadway connects the downtown to Highway 260 on the west side of town, and serves the junior and senior high schools and administration buildings for the school district. The medium-security facility Coyote Ridge Corrections Center, was built near the city. Connell continues to struggle to find its \\"niche\\". Local businesses struggle to compete against the major business of the Tri-Cities and Othello. Several businesses have left (Akins Food, B&H; clothing, Tru- Value Hardware and Les Schwab Tire) and very few new businesses have been established.

The population was 193 at the 2010 census. The Washington State Office of Financial Management's 2015 estimate placed the population at 190. History The first organized settlement of Kahlotus was by German immigrants, imported by the railroads, in around 1880. Among these settlers were several locally recognized pioneer families, including Hans Harder, who first platted the town in 1902 under the name \\"Hardersburg\\". The town was later renamed Kahlotus. The meaning of the word \\"Kahlotus\\" is uncertain. It is believed by many that it is a Native American word meaning \\"Hole in the ground. A third possibility is that the town was named for a Palouse tribal chief and signer of the Yakima Treaty of 1855. His name appeared with various spellings, including Kohlotus, Quillatose (by future governor Isaac Stevens), Qalatos, and Kahlatoose. Harder's platting of the town coincided with the reinstatement of service on the Oregon & Washington Railroad & Navigation line between LaCrosse and Palouse Junction (now Connell), crossing the north end of town parallel to present-day Highway 260. Soon after, the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railroad began construction on a second railroad on the south shore of nearby Kahlotus lake, including tunnels through the basalt cliffs near the southeast corner of town. Kahlotus was officially incorporated on May 31, 1907. The town boomed during construction of the railroad, local legend claims that nearly 20 saloons, a bank, newspaper, brothels, and other businesses appeared to serve the rail crews. Dryland farming has historically constituted the majority of the local economy. Relatively little irrigated agriculture occurs in the area, supported by local wells. The Columbia Basin Irrigation Project does not deliver water to Kahlotus. In 1969, the initial phase of the Lower Monumental Dam was completed nearby, bringing more electricity and water for irrigation, but inundating the nearby Marmes Rockshelter. The dam also made the Snake River navigable, allowing grain to be barged downriver rather than being carried by train. Within a few years, the railroad through the north end of the valley was abandoned and removed. The Burlington Northern tracks along the south end of the lake bed and Devils Canyon were abandoned and removed in the late 1980s, and the right of way became part of the Columbia Plateau Trail State Park. Kahlotus lake, near the east edge of town, was a highly alkaline, spring fed lake and was once a popular fishing spot full of bass and crappie. Several times in the early 20th century, the lake swelled with runoff and flooded the lower-lying portions of town. However, the lake shrank rapidly through the 1990s, and by 2000 only a small marshy area remained at the east end of the lake bed, far from town. Most likely, the lake disappeared due to a combination of several consecutive years of below average rainfall and increases in irrigation withdrawals within the valley. Kahlotus School District The Kahlotus School District is located in Southeastern Washington, 45 miles NE of Pasco, Washington. The residents of the district are involved in cattle and wheat farming. A number of people in the district work for governmental agencies: Corps of Engineers at Lower Monumental Dam, Lyons Ferry Fish Hatchery, and Coyote Ridge Corrections Facility. There has never been a graduating class larger than 12 in the almost 100-year history of the district. The first schoolhouse was built in 1916 and was a two-story school house that housed every class from 1916‚Äì1954. The graduating class of 1955 enjoyed the new building completed in 1954 at its present site. Renovations have been completed over the years with extensive upgrades in the 1990s and 2000s.

It had a population of 59,781 at the 2010 census, and 75,432 as of the July 1, 2019 Census Bureau estimate. Pasco is one of three cities (the others being Kennewick and Richland) that make up Washington state's Tri- Cities region, a mid-sized metropolitan area of approximately 296,224 people. History On October 16, 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped in the Pasco area, at a site now commemorated by Sacajawea State Park. The area was frequented by fur trappers and gold traders. In the 1880s, the Northern Pacific Railway was built near the Columbia River, bringing many settlers to the area. Pasco was officially incorporated on September 3, 1891. It was named by Virgil Bogue, a construction engineer for the Northern Pacific Railway after Cerro de Pasco, a city in the Peruvian Andes, where he had helped build a railroad. In its early years Pasco was a small railroad town, but the completion of the Grand Coulee Dam in 1941 brought irrigation and agriculture to the area. The Franklin County courthouse in Pasco Due in large part to the presence of the Hanford Site (which made the plutonium for the Nagasaki atomic bomb), the entire Tri-Cities area grew rapidly from the 1940s through 1950s. However, most of the population influx resided in Richland and Kennewick, as Pasco remained primarily driven by the agricultural industry, and to a lesser degree the NP Pasco rail yards. After the end of World War II, the entire region went through several \\"boom\\" and \\"bust\\" periods, cycling approximately every 10 years and heavily based on available government funding for Hanford- related work. Farming continues to be the economic driver for most of the city's industrial tax base. Pasco was not a sundown town in the same way as Richland and Kennewick, however Jim Crow laws restricted African Americans to living only on the east side of the railroad tracks, which was largely underdeveloped without public water or garbage service. In the 1940s, Edward R. Dudley visited as an investigator from the NAACP and observed widespread discrimination from businesses and law enforcement. In a 1947 survey, Black residents listed water supply and service as the most significant problem for the area, and racial discrimination as second. White residents listed over- crowded schools as the most significant problem, and the presence of Blacks as second. In 1948, Hazel Scott was refused service at a Pasco restaurant and successfully sued the owners for discrimination, bringing national attention to racial segregation practices in the Tri-Cities. In the late 1990s, foreseeing another Hanford-related boom period, several developers purchased large farm circles in Pasco for residential and commercial development. Since that time, Pasco has undergone a transformation that has not only seen its population overtake the neighboring city of Richland, but also has resulted in growth in the city's retail and tourism industries. Recently incorporated land on the West side of the city has exploded into new housing tracts, apartments, and shopping centers. This area of the city has become referred to locally as \\"West Pasco\\", distinguishing it from the older area of town to the East. In addition to an influx of new residents to the region, many residents of the Tri-Cities have moved from Richland and Kennewick to West Pasco due to its central location and virtually all-new housing and business. In early 2018, plans were announced for 5,000 to 8,000 new residences in West Pasco, west of Road 100.Culverwell, Wendy. \\"Finally, a plan for west Pasco. Here's why it won‚Äôt be just another Road 68\\" Tri-City Herald. March 17, 2018. Geography and climate Pasco is located at (46.238507, ‚àí119.108534).

As Pasco is located in Southeastern Washington, the city lies in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range. As a result, the area is a windswept desert, receiving little precipitation throughout the year. Hot summers, warm springs, and cold winters provide a stark contrast to other areas of the state. The Columbia River borders the south side of the city, separating it from the neighboring cities of Richland and Kennewick.

Pomeroy was officially incorporated on February 3, 1886. The town has been the seat of Garfield County since 1882, despite fierce competition in the 1880s with neighboring towns Pataha and Asotin. The struggle to name a county seat would continue through both houses of the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1883, to Governor William A. Newell of the Washington Territory, and eventually reached the Congress in 1884. On July 18, 1900 (despite a city ordinance which mandated fire-proof materials for downtown buildings; there had been fires in 1890 and 1898 as well) fire destroyed half of the small town's business district.

The population was 7,664 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Grant County. History Ephrata was officially incorporated on June 21, 1909 and was given the county seat for the newly created Grant County.City of Ephrata website Historically, the settlement of Ephrata is quite recent. There was no known settlement until 1886, just three years before Washington gained statehood. The horse rancher Frank Beezley was the first to settle near the natural springs, thus the area was known as Beezley Springs. As the climate and topography were not promising to settlement, the entire region remained sparsely populated until several federal congressional actions, including the Northern Pacific Land Grant Act, the Homestead Act, and Desert Claims Act, encouraged the settlement of this semi-arid desert-like area. Originally, Douglas County spread over the entire territory of the Big Bend of the Columbia River. In 1909, the Washington State legislature divided it, creating Grant County. When the time came to present arguments to the state legislature regarding which town should be the county seat, someone apparently intentionally intoxicated the representative of a rival community, and Ephrata was chosen.http://www.ephrata.org/217.html It is generally believed that the city was named Ephrata by a man who worked for the Great Northern Railway. The name Ephrata is derived from a biblical description of an orchard in the middle of the desert. It is also the ancient name for the town of Bethlehem. The region was known at the turn of the century for the great herds of wild horses that roamed the land. Horse trading was an important element of the local economy, and Ephrata served as the staging area for the horse round-ups. The last \\"Grand Horse Round-up\\" was held in Ephrata in 1906. Ephrata then developed as a trade and service center for cattle and sheep ranches in the area until the construction of the Columbia Basin Reclamation Project. In 1939, one of the state's longest runways was built at Ephrata Municipal Airport and served the U.S. Army Air Corps until 1945, when the field was turned into a commercial airport. The airport and hangars were used in Steven Spielberg's 1989 film Always, the final movie to feature Audrey Hepburn. Ephrata was in the national spotlight in a segment on 60 Minutes II after the 2003 murder of Craig Sorger by Evan Savoie and Jake Eakin. The two accused were the youngest defendants in state history to be tried as adults. Grant County Public Utility District has its headquarters located in Ephrata. Columbia Basin Irrigation Project Beginning in July 1918, several prominent Ephrata residents started the promotion of a plan to redirect waters of the Columbia River in order to irrigate the dry but fertile soils of the Big Bend country. Labeled \\"The Dam University\\", Ephrata residents persistently lobbied at the local, state, and federal levels to gather support for the project. Initial funding for the Grand Coulee Dam was through the Public Works Administration created under Franklin Roosevelt's promise of a \\"New Deal\\" in 1933. However, the irrigation waters would not be released as the nation focused on ending World War II during the 1940s. During this era, Grand Coulee Dam's main mission was to produce electricity for the Hanford Reservation and for aluminum manufacturing, vital to military aircraft production. When the war ended, the Project returned to its original mission, to irrigate the desert. Population growth The construction of the Irrigation Project and the military activity increased the population of Ephrata by a factor of eight between 1940 and 1960. As the federal projects phased out, the town experienced a population decrease of 22% between 1960 and 1975. The population stabilized between 1975 and 1982, with a slight decrease between 1980 and 1990. The city has seen steady population growth since 1990. The present population is 7,110.

The population was 20,366 as of the 2010 census. Moses Lake is the largest city in Grant County. The city anchors the Moses Lake Micropolitan area, which includes all of Grant County and is part of the Moses Lake-Othello combined statistical area. Moses Lake, on which the city lies, is made up of three main arms over long and up to one mile (1.6 km) wide. It is the largest natural body of fresh water in Grant County and has over of shoreline covering . Before it was dammed in the early 1900s and then incorporated into the Columbia Basin Project, Moses Lake was a smaller shallow lake., USGS, GNIS To the south of the town is the Potholes Reservoir and the Columbia National Wildlife Refuge that has a number of seep lakes and vast amounts of migratory birds and other fauna natural to the area. right History Before the construction of Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in 1941 and Moses Lake Army Air Base in 1942 the area was largely barren. Native Americans knew the area as Houaph, which meant willow. Chief Moses was leader of the Sinkiuse tribe from 1859 to 1899, and was forced to negotiate with white settlers who began to settle in the area in the 1880s. Under pressure from the government, Chief Moses traded the Columbia Basin land for a reservation that stretched from Lake Chelan north to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. The government later traded again for what is now the Colville Indian Reservation. The new settlers named the lake in honor of Chief Moses. The city was originally named Neppel, after a town in Germany where one of the original settlers had lived. The first settlers established fisheries and farms ‚Äî some of the first exported items were carp, jackrabbits and fruit ‚Äî but irrigation attempts failed and settlers left at about the same rate as they came. When the town was incorporated and renamed Moses Lake in 1938, the population was estimated at 302 people. The arrival of the air base in 1942 and irrigation water pumped from Grand Coulee Dam in 1955 offered newcomers a reason and a way to settle in an area that previously had little to offer other than good fishing and a place to water sheep and cattle. Moses Lake was quickly transformed into a hub for a vast region where transportation, agriculture and recreation came together. The air base was built to train World War II pilots to fly the P-38 Lightning and B-17 Flying Fortress, two planes that were essential to the war effort. The base was closed after the war ended, but reopened in 1948 as a U.S. Air Force base and test area for Boeing's B-47 Stratojet and B-50 Superfortress. The B-47 tests led to development of modern commercial jetliners still used today. Fighter jets were stationed there to protect Grand Coulee Dam to the north and the Hanford site to the south. Boeing still uses the airport as a test and evaluation facility for its aircraft. Japan Airlines used the airport as a training area from November 1968 until March 2009. The old air base is now owned by the Port of Moses Lake and is home to Grant County International Airport, Big Bend Community College and several businesses. Farmers, meanwhile, had developed new methods to irrigate water from the lake and from the Columbia River and began planting expansive irrigated acreage. When the Columbia Basin Project was completed in the mid-1950s, farms expanded by thousands of acres, growing potatoes, corn, onions, carrots and sugar beets. In little more than a decade, Moses Lake's population grew from 300 to 2,679 in 1950. Today, the population is 21,419 (2014 estimate).

Activities The City of Quincy is located in Central Washington with close proximity to winter and summer activities. The area offers boating, water skiing, hunting, fishing, snow skiing, and concerts. The Gorge Amphitheatre brings a variety of people through the Quincy Valley. Quincy has several parks including an aqua park with a waterslide with 2 water fed half tubes, heated pools, and special areas for kids. The park is also home to a large field with a baseball diamond, playground, picnic area, and small skate- park. Every 2nd Saturday in September, Quincy celebrates Farmer-Consumer Awareness Day. For a month beforehand, the roads leading to town are decorated with signs showing local crops and products made with them. On the day of the celebration, floats created by local schools and farm equipment parade through town. Free agricultural and geology tours are offered, as well as a produce sale, tractor pull, Farm-to-Market fun run, and many other activities. Quincy celebrated its centennial in 2007. Quincy High School won the 2A State Baseball Championship in 1998 and the 1A State Soccer Championship in 2014. In 2005, the Boys Basketball team took second in state. Every year Quincy has an annual Dru Gimlin 3 on 3 basketball tournament. Economy=Farming Quincy has long had an agricultural economy, which was enhanced by irrigation made possible with the Grand Coulee Dam. Major crops include potatoes, wheat, and timothy grass. Orchards and vineyards are also displacing lower-value crops in the Quincy Valley. Washington State is a large grower of apples. Technology Technology companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo!, Dell and Intuit have located large data centers within the Quincy area since 2007. Microsoft's Columbia Data Center, built starting in 2006 and expanded several times, is said to be the world's largest data center. The centers, attracted to the area because of its abundant and cheap hydroelectricity, have been criticized for dodging fines from the Grant County Public Utility District for overusing electricity and for creating air pollution through their diesel backup generators. The data centers are incentivized by tax credits offered by the state of Washington to stimulate economic development in the city. Two additional electrical substations are being built to handle expected demand from current and future companies. Tourism Although George is the closest town to the Gorge Amphitheatre, Quincy is the closest town that offers services such as motels and a full grocery store. Quincy sees an uptick in population during concerts. Quincy was previously home to Tacos mi Pueblo, one of the most sought-after Mexican restaurants in the area. The semi-arid climate allows Quincy to go for weeks or months without rain during the summer. This makes nearby water recreation such as Crescent Bar a major draw. Quincy is the closest town with services to Crescent Bar.

The population was 1,514 at the 2010 census. History Soap Lake was officially incorporated on June 9, 1919. This came to a halt during the Depression when drought hit Soap Lake. Because of the lack of water and the lack of money, the tourist trade dwindled. But, when Grand Coulee Dam was built, the irrigation canals brought new life into the area. Soap Lake has been internationally known during the past century for its uniquely mineral- rich (23) waters and mud. Many people believe the water and mud to be successful in treatment of a variety of ailments. From the early 1900s to the mid-1940s, there were a number of sanitariums located on Soap Lake. These early versions of spas were used by visitors from all over the country and the world. When the sanitariums, hotels, and bath houses were full, people slept in tents, and even under their cars, in order to use the water of the lake. In 1933, the Veteran's Administration sent nine veterans, under a special project, to Soap Lake for treatment of Buerger's disease. In November 1938, McKay Hospital was completed. For a number of years, McKay was used as a research center for the study of the therapeutic effect of the water of the lake and the climate. City of Soap LakeSoap Lake is located in the center of the state of Washington, 20 miles north of Interstate 90 between Seattle and Spokane, sitting in a desert environment with nine inches or less of rainfall per year and 320 days of sun. The current population is approximately 1,740 people. Soap Lake is formed at the end of a chain of lakes running down the center of the Lower Grand Coulee. The Lower Grand Coulee is over a mile and a half wide in places with sheer basalt rock walls rising 900 feet over the coulee floor. State Highway 17, Coulee Corridor-National Scenic Byway, runs through Soap Lake and up the floor of the canyon heading towards Grand Coulee Dam and Canada. Of the five lakes existing along the Coulee Corridor, Soap Lake has the highest mineral content. The first layer of Soap Lake is made up of about 81 feet of mineral water; the second level is mud-like and consists of a stronger mineral composition with concentrations of unusual substances and microscopic life forms. The lake's two layers have not mixed in thousands of years. The scientific community refers to lakes with this rare condition as meromictic. With only 11 meromictic lakes in the United States, Soap Lake is likely the most radical of all. The scientific community is currently exploring the lake to document some of the unusual qualities. The mineral content of Soap Lake water has been analyzed many times . The concentration of different minerals has changed throughout this time. The most recent analysis was conducted in 2000. In 1950, Soap Lake became a city of Third Class. The population in 1952 was 2051, which grew to 2580 in 1955. At this time the lake was becoming increasingly diluted, due to the seepage of these same life- giving irrigation canals. The City Council petitioned the Department of the Interior to remedy this situation. The Bureau of Reclamation built several wells and pumps to intercept the seepage water, and the end of the 1950s diminished the dilution. Tourism The city is currently trying to attract tourism by attempting to revive the health aspect of the lake to attract the spa crowd. The minerals in the lake are said to have healing properties for Buerger's disease. Two older brick buildings along the main street northbound have been renovated to house an art museum and a coffee shop. Another tourism effort is to install a novel roadside attraction: a 52,000 pound (60 feet in height) lava lamp, formerly a Target advertisement in Times Square.Roadside America web site Soap Lake pins hope on giant lava lamp Seattle P-I, January 1, 2005Soap Lake to spend $100,000 to install lava lamp Seattle P-I, January 26, 2006 That effort was profiled in the 2010 documentary film, World's Largest.

The population was 2,692 at the 2010 census. History The Central Basin plateau was settled in the late 1800s by immigrants of Russian-German (Bessarabian) ancestry who homesteaded in the area and farmed dryland wheat. Prior to this the area had been inhabited by local Native American Salish tribes that had contact with the early Spanish and British traders. The Milwaukee Railroad arrived in the early 1900s and attracted additional settlers, including Doc Harris who established a drug and sundries store with physician services in Warden about 1905. The town's name of \\"Warden\\" comes from its Bessarabian German heritage and means \\"worthy\\" or \\"treasured\\" as may be noted in the Das Deutsche Woerterbuch von Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm. A local tradition attributes the name of the town to Doc Harris's son Ward. However, the area of the town was being referred to as \\"Warden\\" by its German settlers long before Doc Harris arrived, as may be noted in the Protokol, official church records in German of the original church which is today the Warden Community Church. Other nearby towns also carry Bessarabian German names such as Lind, Ruff, and Odessa. The Bessarabian German tradition of the town has long since vanished and has been mostly replaced with a mixed Anglo/Hispanic culture with a current population that is of roughly 72% Hispanic heritage. In regards to the history of the present-day Hispanic populace, some of the families can trace their heritage back to the days of the earliest Spanish contact in the area. This first group predates the influx of Bessarabian German settlers by decades. A large number of Hispanics came to work in the fields that opened to more diverse agriculture after the federal Columbia Basin Project brought irrigation to the area. This second group of Hispanics came up from Texas, but they had roots in the villages around the city of Monterey, Mexico. They claim a distinct Tejano culture and have been in the US for generations already. The third group are the most recent arrivals that seem to come mostly from the West Mexican States of Jalisco, Sinaloa, and Sonora. They have a culture that is distinct from the Tejanos in many regards, including language, music, and food. Many in this third group still may speak only Spanish; whereas the other groups may be bilingual or speak only English already. The Town of Warden was officially incorporated June 28, 1910. By 1917 the population of Warden reached 300. Electricity arrived in 1939, but the town's population declined through World War II. In 1945 the beginning of the Columbia Basin Project would bring irrigation water from Grand Coulee Dam to irrigate over of arid but fertile soil. In 1948 the federal government started selling government- owned farm units on the Columbia Basin Project to qualified applicants with preference to veterans. By 1954 the East Low Canal was finished. As a result of the project, the population of Warden grew from 322 in 1950 to 949 in 1960 to 1,639 in 1990 and has continued to grow to the current population of about 2,600.

The population was 16,896 at the 2010 census. The city is the economic center of Grays Harbor County, bordering the cities of Hoquiam and Cosmopolis. Aberdeen is occasionally referred to as the \\"Gateway to the Olympic Peninsula\\". History A tribute to Kurt Cobain was installed by the Kurt Cobain Memorial Committee. \\"Come as You Are\\" is a song by Nirvana. Aberdeen was named after a local salmon cannery to reflect its Scottish fishing port namesake Aberdeen, and because it, too, is situated at the mouth of two rivers (Aberdeen, Scotland is bordered by the River Don to the north and the River Dee to the south). Aberdeen was founded by Samuel Benn in 1884 and incorporated on May 12, 1890. Although it became the largest and best-known city in Grays Harbor, Aberdeen lagged behind nearby Hoquiam and Cosmopolis in its early years. When A.J. West built the town's first sawmill in 1894, the other two municipalities had been in business for several years. Aberdeen and its neighbors vied to be the terminus for Northern Pacific Railroad, but instead of ending at one of the established mill towns, the railroad skimmed through Cosmopolis and headed west for Ocosta. Hoquiam and Aberdeen citizens together built a spur; in 1895, the line connected Northern Pacific tracks to Aberdeen. Ellmore Packing Co. clam and salmon cannery in Aberdeen, 1915 By 1900, Aberdeen had become home to many saloons, whorehouses, and gambling establishments. It was nicknamed \\"The Hellhole of the Pacific\\", as well as \\"The Port of Missing Men\\" due to its high murder rate. One notable resident was Billy Gohl, known locally as Billy \\"Ghoul\\", who was rumored to have killed at least 140 men. Gohl was ultimately convicted of two murders. Aberdeen was hit hard during the Great Depression, which saw the number of major local sawmills reduce from 37 to 9. The timber industry continued to boom, but by the late 1970s most of this resource had been logged. Most of the mills had closed down by the 1970s and 1980s. Aberdeen is also the home port of the tall ship Lady Washington, a reproduction of a smaller vessel used by the explorer Captain Robert Gray, featured in the Pirates of the Caribbean film The Curse of the Black Pearl. Geography Aberdeen is at the eastern end of Grays Harbor, near the mouth of the Chehalis River and southwest of the Olympic Mountains. Grays Harbor is notable as the northernmost ria on North America's Pacific Coast because it has remained free of glaciers throughout the Quaternary due to unfavorable topography and warm temperatures. It is thought that, during glacial periods of the Quaternary, the Chehalis River was a major refugium for aquatic species, as was the west coast from the Olympic Peninsula southward for plants that later formed the northern part of the Pacific temperate rainforest in formerly glaciated areas. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Climate Aberdeen experiences a climate on the boundary between Mediterranean (K√∂ppen Csb) and oceanic (K√∂ppen Cfb). Although the rainfall is extremely high between October and March, July and August still have a distinct excess of evaporation over rainfall. Temperatures are generally very mild due to the proximity of the warm Pacific Ocean and the Kuroshio Current: snow is extremely rare although during December 1964 fell. Occasionally, southeasterly winds can cause very high temperatures. For example, in August 1981, the temperature in Aberdeen reached .

Industry Aberdeen and the rest of Grays Harbor remain dependent on timber, fishing, and tourism industries and as a regional service center for much of the Olympic Peninsula. Grays Harbor Community Hospital employees total more than 600 workers. Historically the area is dependent on harvesting and exporting natural resources. The Port of Grays Harbor is the largest coastal shipping port north of California. It is still a center for the export of logs on the west coast of the U.S.and has become one of the largest centers for the shipment of autos and grains to China and Korea. On December 19, 2005, Weyerhaeuser made plans to close the Aberdeen large-log sawmill and the Cosmopolis pulp mill, and the closures took effect in early 2006. This resulted in the loss of at least 342 jobs. In January 2009, Weyerhaeuser closed two additional plants in Aberdeen, resulting in another 221 lost jobs. In both cases many employees were not told by Weyerhaeuser management, but learned about the closures from local radio stations who received a press release prior to a scheduled press conference. Major employers in Grays Harbor include Westport Shipyard, Sierra Pacific Industries, The Simpson Door Company, Hoquiam Plywood, Pasha Automotive, Willis Enterprises, Ocean Gold Companies, Vaughn Company, and the Stafford Creek Corrections Center, a state prison which opened in 2000. Other significant employers include the cranberry-growing cooperative Ocean Spray, worldwide retailer Walmart, Sidhu & Sons Nursery USA, Inc. (AKA Briggs Nursery), Overstock.com, and Washington Crab Producers. In 2007, Imperium Renewables of Seattle invested $40 million in the construction of the biodiesel plant at the Port of Grays Harbor. It is estimated the plant will produce as much as of biodiesel fuel made from plants and vegetable material annually. In September 2010, the Weyerhaeuser Cosmopolis Pulp Mill was purchased by the Beverly Hills-based Gores Group and restarted as Cosmo Specialty Fibers, Inc. They started production of pulp on May 1, 2011. Education The Weatherwax building of Aberdeen High School burned down in 2002. The city's school district has two high schools: J. M. Weatherwax High School, or Aberdeen High School as it is now called; and Harbor High School, an alternative high school with an enrollment exceeding 200 students. Aberdeen High has a long-time school sports rivalry with nearby Hoquiam High School. In 2002, the Weatherwax building of Aberdeen High School, built in 1909, burned to the ground in an act of arson. The new building was completed in 2007 and held its grand opening on August 25, 2007.

The population was 676 at the 2010 census. History Brady was named in honor of John Brady, an early settler in the Chehalis Valley. Brady had a farm roughly a mile north of the present location of the Brady Food Mart. The Chehalis River valley south of Brady was the first part of this area to be settled, by the Smith, Twidwell and Foster families in the late 19th century. Andrew Jackson Smith settled his homestead beginning in 1851. The Smith, Foster and Twidwill families are all related. At that time the Chehalis River was the only means of transportation in and out of the area, so these homesteads were staked out on the riverfront. Subsequent road construction led in the 1930s to paving through Brady of a two-lane highway, at the time called Highway 410, connecting the Pacific coast with U.S. Highway 101 at Olympia. This road is now referred to as the Monte-Elma Road. A four- lane, divided freeway connecting Interstate 5 at Olympia to Aberdeen was built through the Brady area in the mid-1960s. The section passing through the Brady area is part of U.S. Route 12. The greater Brady area relates to the boundaries of the now-defunct Brady school district, bounded on the east by the Satsop River, on the north by the Grays Harbor County line, on the south by the Chehalis River, and on the west by the boundary with the Montesano School District at Camp Creek. Today, these boundaries roughly correspond to Grays Harbor Fire District No. 2, which is served by the Brady Volunteer Fire Department. The school at Brady, known as Olympic View School, was consolidated with the Montesano School District in 1968. Prior to this consolidation the school was the social hub of the community. The school house was sold to a private drug abuse rehabilitation charity called the Harvester Foundation. The school playshed, which had been converted to residential housing, burned in a case of suspected arson in the mid-1970s. Two children did not escape, and their bodies were later recovered from the ashes from beneath the remains of a completely incinerated bed. The schoolhouse was later demolished.

History Working at a Sea Beach Packing Works clam opening machine The Copalis Native Americans belong to the coastal division of the Salishan language family and historically occupied the area of Copalis River and the Pacific Coast between the mouth of Joe Creek and Grays Harbor. In 1805, Lewis and Clark estimated a population of 200 Copalis in 10 houses. The 5 individuals assigned to a \\"Chepalis\\" tribe in an enumeration given by Olson of the year 1888 probably refers to them. The first non-Native American people settled in Copalis Beach in the 1890s. Copalis, along with the beach of the same name, has become famed as the \\"Home of the razor clam.\\" The community sits near the northern end of probably the greatest razor clam bed in the world for the flavor renowned variety abounds, apparently only in the Pacific Northwest, and particularly on Copalis Beach. During the commercial season, Copalis' normal population of about 350 persons, leaped fourfold. Sea Beach Packing Works cannery in Copalis, 1915 During 1947 and 1948, commercial diggers took more than a million pounds of bivalves from Copalis Beach, earned themselves approximately $200,000.00 and brought huge additional sums to cannery men and workers.

It borders the city of Aberdeen at Myrtle Street, with Hoquiam to the west. The two cities share a common economic history in lumbering and exporting, but Hoquiam has maintained its independent identity. It shares a long rivalry with its more populated neighbor, especially in high school sports. Hoquiam (Ho'-kwee-um, or Ho-kwim, to natives) was incorporated on May 21, 1890. Its name comes from a Native-American word meaning \\"hungry for wood\\", from the great amount of driftwood at the mouth of the Hoquiam River. The population was 8,726 at the 2010 Census. History One of the first logging operations in Hoquiam was established by Ed Campbell in 1872.Van Syckle, Ed. A Brief Historical Sketch of Grays Harbor Washington. Chambers of Commerce of Hoquiam and Aberdeen, Washington, 1942. About 10 years later, Captain Asa M. Simpson, a Pacific Coast mariner and businessman in the lumber industry from San Francisco, provided the financing for the Northwestern Mill.Lawrence, Michael. Historic American Engineering Record: Hoquiam River Bridge, National Park Service, 1993. In 1881, Simpson sent his manager, George Emerson, to Hoquiam to establish a mill there, and Emerson purchased 300 acres for the new mill and lumber operation. By September 1882, the Simpson mill was producing its first lumber products.

Washington, West of the Cascades: Historical and Descriptive; the explorers, the Indians, the Pioneers, the Modern, Volume 3. S.J. Clarke publishing company, 1917 The extension of the railroad from Aberdeen to Hoquiam, beginning in 1898, contributed to the continued importance of logging and lumber in Hoquiam. The importance of logging and related products continued to be relevant to Hoquiam's economy, and in 1927, a pulp mill was established under the name of Grays Harbor Pulp Company. A year later, a Pennsylvania company- the Hammerhill Paper Company- became interested in Grays Harbor Pulp Company. When the Pennsylvania company bought stock in the Grays Harbor Pulp Company, the Grays Harbor pulp Company built a paper mill and became the Grays Harbor Pulp & Paper Company.

The population was 207 at the 2010 census. It is located near the mouth of the Moclips River. According to Edmond S. Meany, the word moclips comes from a Quinault word meaning a place where girls were sent as they were approaching puberty. However, according to William Bright, the name comes from the Quinault word meaning simply \\"large stream\\". History Moclips preserves a lot of its naturally wooded area in order to block high winds from the Pacific Ocean, making it home to several forest-dwelling fauna, such as deer. The indigenous inhabitants of the area were members of the Quinault tribe along the coast north of Grays Harbor and the Upper and Lower Chehalis tribes of the lower Chehalis River drainage. Other groups included the Copalis, Wynoochee, and Humptulips subtribes of the Upper Chehalis subtribe, and the Satsop subtribe of the Lower Chehalis. The Chehalis, Quinault, Cowlitz, and Queets spoke Coast Salish languages related to other Salishan language groups in the Northwest. The Quileute and Hoh spoke unrelated Chimakuan languages, while the Makah spoke a Wakashan language, also unrelated. To the south the Chinookan people spoke yet another family of unrelated languages, the Chinookan languages. All the tribes also used a trade pidgin called Chinook Jargon. The area's indigenous people lived in permanent villages along rivers and lakes. Water defined their economic and cultural lives. They harvested salmon as they swam upstream to spawn, as well as whales and seals along the coast. In the summers, hunters ranged inland and into the Olympic Mountains for game and to trade with other tribal groups. The Indians developed a high degree of skill with canoes carved from cedar trees in a variety of specialized designs adapted to swift-flowing rivers, broad estuaries, and the sea. The Quinaults' first recorded contact with Europeans, in 1775 near Grenville Point, ended in the deaths of seven Spaniards and as many as seven Indians. The Indians had traded peacefully with the explorers, but turned on them after the Spaniards landed, erected a cross, and claimed the land for the Spanish king. The reason for the sudden attack remains unexplained, but tribal historians have offered the possibility that the Europeans had violated a woman's safe haven. In 1792, Captain Robert Gray discovered Grays Harbor and entered the Columbia River, the first non- indigenous people to have done so. In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson sent the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the vast interior between the Missouri River and the Pacific Ocean. Although the expedition cemented American claims to Oregon Country, it failed to find a practical wagon route. It wasn't until the Oregon Trail began to be used by American settlers in the 1840s that British control of the Pacific Northwest, in the form of the Hudson's Bay Company, became challenged. Contact with Europeans and the frequent interaction between tribes accelerated the several epidemics that swept the region, beginning with smallpox in the 1770s and continuing with what was likely malaria in 1829, cholera in 1836, and smallpox again in 1853. The native population dropped from thousands to a few dozen. So many Chinooks died around Willapa Bay in the 1850s that the Chehalis moved in to take their place. In 1855, after the creation of Washington Territory, the Quinault Treaty was signed by Chief Taholah of the Quinault and Chief How-yat'l of the Quileute, along with many other tribal delegates. One result of the treaty was the creation of the roughly triangular shaped Quinault Indian Reservation between the Pacific Ocean and Lake Quinault. The first American settlers came to the North Beach area in the mid-19th century. Many homesteaded with of fine timber. Although settled earlier by homesteaders such as Steve Grover in 1862, Moclips was not incorporated until 1905 with the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway and the first Moclips Beach Hotel built by Dr. Edward Lycan. The hotel was a two-story, 150-room beachside resort. It burned down in 1905, just months after it was completed. Dr. Lycan then had a new, larger hotel built on the same site. It was three stories high, a block long, and loomed from the dunes. This Moclips Beach Hotel was completed in 1907 and advertised as having 270 \\"outside\\" rooms, with of covered veranda, and a perfect view of the Pacific Ocean, reported to be just from the hotel grounds. This close proximity to the ocean, however, would prove its undoing. Back then Moclips was publicized as a healthy getaway from the toil and trouble of city life. It was a health resort. The moist salt air and bathing in the surf was touted as very medicinal. A promotional pamphlet of the time purports Moclips' climate to be \\"simply perfect\\". Dr. Lycan believed that Moclips was the Mecca for health and pleasure of the Northwest. Moclips grew into a sizable town with restaurants, hotels, a candy store, theater, canneries, and the M.R. Smith Lumber and Shingle Mill. Many hotels, schools, canneries and shingle mills were quickly built. Four schools once taught children from Taholah to Ocean Shores.

The population was 3,976 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Grays Harbor County. History=Medcalf Prairie According to Edwin Van Syckle, a portion of the present-day town of Montesano was first platted in 1870 by Samuel Henry Williams, who purchased land in what was known as Medcalf Prairie, named after the early settler William Medcalf. At about the same time, surveyor Charles Newton Byles bought a farm from Walter King on the present-day site of Montesano on April 9, 1870, and later platted three blocks on the west side of Main Street.Edwin Van Syckle (1982). The River Pioneers- Early Days on Grays Harbor. Pacific Search Press. The town of Montesano was born, but it was not incorporated until November 26, 1883, by the Washington Territorial Legislature. A lumber company's locomotive, Montesano, c. 1921 South Montesano Prior to that time, the name Montesano was used to refer to the homestead of Isaiah Lancaster Scammon and his wife Lorinda. They filed a 640 Donation Land Claim on January 15, 1853, on the Chehalis River, opposite the mouth of the Wynoochee River, in the area now referred to as South Montesano. The Scammon home was often referred to as \\"Scammon's Landing\\" or \\"Scammon's Hotel\\", because it was an important stopping point along the Chehalis River for early pioneers, and the furthest up-river mooring point and railroad junction for seagoing ships. According to Edmond S. Meany, in 1860 the seat of what was then called Chehalis County was moved to \\"the place of J.L. Scammons\\". Mrs. Lorinda Scammon was very religious and wished to have the place named \\"Mount Zion\\". Another early settler, Samuel James, suggested \\"Montesano\\", which was derived from Spanish meaning \\"mountain of health\\"; it was said that this had a more pleasant sound and meant about the same. The suggestion was approved, and soon after, a post office was secured with the name \\"Montesano\\". The people of Chehalis County voted to move the county seat to the platted town of Montesano in 1886, and the Scammon home was then known as South Montesano. Recent In 2012, Michael Thomas, an inmate at the county jail, stabbed a judge and took a guard's gun and shot them. It then triggered a manhunt and he was found days later. Geography Montesano is located at (46.985865, -123.597726). It is on the north slope of the Chehalis River valley, near the confluence of the Wynoochee River and Chehalis River.

Climate This region experiences warm (but not hot) and relatively dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above and very wet autumns and springs due to the maritime winds. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Montesano is in a region of oceanic climate, abbreviated Cfb on climate maps due to frequent summer rainfall, even though there is a significant drying trend during that season. The summer highs are hotter than in Aberdeen courtesy of its inland position. This also renders frequent but most often minor frosts in winter, with the climate retaining a significant maritime influence.

It was incorporated in 1905, with booming lumber, railway, and farming industries creating the early foundation of the community. The population was 684 at the 2010 census. History In 1818, the United States and Great Britain agreed to a treaty of joint occupancy in the Oregon Country, which included the land that would eventually become Oakville, Washington. Over the next several decades, citizens of the United States began to settle in the area. As traveling by boat was easier than moving through the dense forests, many used the river system, entering from the port of Grays Harbor and canoeing inland via the Chehalis River. The British government gave full ownership of the area to the United States in 1846. Settlers at their homestead on the west side of Oakville, circa 1890. In 1850, the land now occupied by Oakville was mainly open prairie, was maintained by yearly fires started deliberately by local tribes, which kept the forest from encroaching and which encouraged the bloom of camas, a staple food, and other plants. This open land was attractive to settlers arriving in the area. The native people of the area were very helpful to the settlers, and towns began to be platted up and down the Chehalis River. In the 1870s, a party of several families relocated to the area from Crawford County, Illinois. The leader of the party, James Reed Harris, had purchased the donation claim for the area from John Hole for $1200. He applied for a post office, and after some discussion, it was decided to use the name \\"Oakville,\\" inspired by the Garry oak trees in the area; the post office opened on December 31, 1873. Logging and railroad construction soon brought other settlers to the area; the plat of the city site was filed on September 27, 1887. Around 1890, Northern Pacific Railway was laying tracks through the city. By the turn of the century, a Northern Pacific train station had been established in the city, and the area had several general stores, a new school, and a couple of hotels. Oakville was officially incorporated on December 18, 1905. In 1909, a report by the Railroad Commission of Washington described Oakville: > \\"Oakville is a town of about 400 inhabitants, located on the line of the > Northern Pacific trailer in the center of an important lumbering and taking > district. The timber resources of this section are of immense value and the > bottom lands are well adapted to general farming. Oakville is a growing town > and will develop more rapidly as the resources of the surrounding district > are more thoroughly exploited.\\" Track being laid for the railroad near Oakville, circa 1890. Lumber was a major industry in the early days of the city; in 1916, Oakville Lumber Company, Big Fir Lumber Company, Vance Lumber Company, and others were in operation, along with the Callow Mill. The city was \\"noted for large shipments of cascara bark.\\" Factories were also part of the city's economy, with the E.H. Hilton & Co. Oiled Clothes Factory in operation by 1915, and the Oakville Co-Operative Cheese Company incorporating a few years later. Other businesses in the early days of the city included a jewelry store, a shoe company, and a hardware store. The city's librarian Clara Trudgeon had been appointed by the State Traveling Library by 1908, making Oakville eligible to be a recipient of one of the 150 cases of books the state had in rotation. The weekly newspaper was The Oakville Cruiser. By 1919, the city had an active community center, and the high school had received accreditation as a four-year school. The historic bank was incorporated on August 14, 1909 by C.R. Harper and C.C. Scates; first called the Oakville State Bank, it changed names and ownership several times over the next century. It is said to be the last bank in Washington to be robbed by a rider on horseback. The city has commemorated this throughout the years by hosting reenactments of the robbery, with groups competing to give the best performance. On August 7, 1994, a resident reported that a translucent, gelatinous substance had rained down in the night; she expressed concern that it may have caused her and her mother to become ill, and speculated it may have been the reason her kitten died. When the substance appeared again, samples were collected and tested by a local doctor, who initially stated that the substance contained human blood cells. Further testing by the Department of Ecology refuted these results, as tests showed that there were no nuclei present. Several theories were given by residents, including wondering whether the substance might have been waste from a commercial plane toilet or whether it may have been particles of deceased jellyfish that had evaporated and been incorporated into a rain cloud. No theory was ever proven to be correct, but for a time, the incident received coverage in several media outlets, including The New York Times, and a segment was produced about it for an episode of Unsolved Mysteries.

The population was 5,569 at the 2010 census. History razor clams on the beach The City of Ocean Shores occupies the Point Brown peninsula on the Washington coast. Long before the arrival of European explorers and settlers, the peninsula was used by the various local tribes for trading and other purposes. The Chinook, Chehalis, and Quinault tribes used the area, as well as others that now make up the Quinault Indian Nation. On May 7, 1792, Captain Robert Gray sailed into the bay and named the area Bullfinch Harbor. Later, Captain George Vancouver renamed the area Grays Harbor after Captain Gray. The first established white settler on the Point was Matthew McGee, who settled in the early 1860s. He sold the southern portion of the peninsula to A.O. Damon in 1878 for a trading supply center whose dock extended into the Oyehut channel. A.O. Damon took over the entire peninsula from McGee, and the land was passed along to his grandson, Ralph Minard, who used the area as a cattle ranch from 1929 until he sold to the Ocean Shores Development Corporation in 1960 for $1,000,000. At the time the Washington State legislature was considering legalizing some forms of gambling. In expectation of a huge casino development, the Ocean Shores Development Corporation opened their sale of lots in a travel trailer parked in the dunes. Soon the word spread about the California-style development of the place called Ocean Shores. Lots began at $595 and were sold sight unseen from the first plat maps. As the numbers of lots sold rose, the prices rose. Property lots were staked and numbered only as the road construction crews began to lay out the massive road system. Even though the first roads were only in length, the downtown area had mercury vapor lights to show that this was a booming city. In the first year 25 homes were constructed and their owners had charter membership certificates in the Ocean Shores Community Club. As the development grew, the Ginny Simms Restaurant and Nightclub brought in the Hollywood set. In fact, on its opening night, chartered planes flew up a whole contingent of Hollywood stars, and 11,000 people turned out at Bowerman Basin to see the celebrities. By December 1960, of canals were planned, a six-hole golf course was drawing players, and the mall shopping area was ready for the 1961 Ocean Shores Estates construction boom. The mall, 100 motel units, three restaurants and an airstrip sprang up from the sandy ground, with the marina opening in 1963. The SS Catala was brought up from California to become a \\"boatel\\" and charter fleet office. Two years later a southwest winter storm drove her into the sand and for many years she was the most famous shipwreck on the Washington Coast. In 1966 the gates to the city were installed. Pat Boone became a local resident in 1967 as a stockholder in Ocean Shores Estates Incorporated, and promotion of the development was sped along by the Celebrity Golf tournaments hosted by Boone. By 1969, Ocean Shores was declared the \\"richest little city\\" per capita in the country, with an assessed valuation of $35 million and 900 permanent residents. The following year the city was incorporated and a planning commission was formed to zone the city and codify streets. The city's first school opened in 1971 and road paving began in earnest. During the 1970s, the town struggled through many setbacks brought on mainly by the state's economic recession. By the 1980s, the slump was over and construction of homes and businesses accelerated again.

At the time of the 2010 census the population was 2,045. The town received its name based on its origins as a socialist commune in the early 1900s: in the eyes of its founders, the land of the town was literally to be free for all people. Some of the first settlers were veterans of a prior experiment in socialism, the nearby Equality Colony.Charles Pierce LeWarne, Utopias on Puget Sound, 1885-1915, Seattle, University of Washington State Press, 1975; pp. 114‚Äì28. History Some Equality Colony dissidents, led by George Washington Daniels, incorporated the Free Land Association in 1900 and established the colony on land they purchased through James P. Gleason of the Fidelity Trust company. Members purchased dividend-paying shares in the association store fund and the machinery fund. The association store operated according to Rochdale Principles, and shares in the store were sold to non-residents as well as association members. Because members could pay for their land with dividends from their shares, the founders considered the land to be \\"free\\". By 1902, however, the colony announced that new settlers would have to purchase land outright, as the idealistic land-financing plan based on share dividends had not worked. Daniels platted five-acre tracts with wide streets to form the original townsite. Additional plats were added over the next several years. Freeland considered itself a cooperative profit-sharing association and rejected the rigid communal structure of other colonies on the island. They described themselves to the Whidby Islander as \\"simply a settlement of socialists co-operating on semi-capitalistic principles.\\" During its early years, Freeland had no local school, sending its children three miles across the island to Useless Bay. The lack of roads contributed to the isolation of the colony, although Daniels' son-in-law, John H. Prather, purchased several boats to provide freight and passenger service between Freeland and Everett, the nearest town on the mainland.

Prominent land features include: * Marrowstone Point, at the northern end of Marrowstone Island; * Kinney Point, at the southern end of the island; * Nodule Point, on the east side, mid island; * Mystery Bay, an inlet on the western side of Marrowstone Island; * Griffiths Point, on the western side of Mystery Bay; * East Beach, a sandy beach at the northern end of East Marrowstone Road; and * Scow Bay/Kilisut Harbor, which separates Marrowstone Island from its western neighbor, Indian Island, a Navy ammunition depot. A narrow causeway connects the southwestern end of Marrowstone Island with the southern end of Indian Island. A short bridge joins the western side of Indian Island to the mainland of Jefferson County. Fort Flagler, a Washington state park, is situated on 784 acres (314 hectares) at the northern end of Marrowstone Island. It overlooks Port Townsend Bay and Admiralty Inlet, the entrance to Puget Sound. Fort Flagler was one of three forts, along with Fort Worden (near Port Townsend) and Fort Casey (on Whidbey Island), that guarded the entrance to Puget Sound. Mystery Bay State Park is another state park on Marrowstone Island, located on 10 acres (4 hectares) of Mystery Bay shorefront about a half-mile north of the Nordland General Store. It is primarily for boaters. Kinney Point State Park comprises at the south end of the island. Accessible only by boat, it is part of the Cascadia Marine Trail. Flagler Road (SR 116) runs along the western edge of Marrowstone Island, which is primarily low-lying. East Marrowstone Road runs along the eastern edge of the island, which consists largely of sandy bluffs, with the exception of the area near East Beach. The Nordland General Store is Marrowstone's only source of groceries. It is arguably the focal point of Marrowstone; on maps the town of Nordland (the address of all Marrowstone residents) is usually located at the site of the Nordland General Store. It can be found just across Flagler Road from Mystery Bay, near the center of Marrowstone Island.

History of Irondale Rolling bars in Irondale The first iron-producing blast furnace in Washington Territory was completed in Irondale in 1881. About 1,200 tons of pig iron was produced during its first year of operation, with ore obtained from Chimacum Valley. The plant was closed in 1889. The initial hope was for Irondale to become a major iron and steel producer for the western United States. At first, it looked as though this dream was going to come true. After only two years of production, Irondale had several bars, boarding facilities for both men and horses, and homes and accommodations for over 200 workers. Before the local economy and the plant failed in 1889, there were over 400 men employed at the foundry. The town expanded and grew on the sandy bluffs that overlooked the waterside plant. There were several efforts made to rebuild the iron and steel plant in the following years, but all failed. Irondale today is a bedroom community for the surrounding towns of Port Hadlock, Port Townsend and further south to Silverdale.Irondale ‚Äì Washington Ghost Town History of Port Hadlock Samuel Hadlock, the founder of Port Hadlock, moved west in 1846, finally landing in the Port Hadlock area in 1870. He contracted with the Washington Mill Company to build a sawmill on a spit of land at the south end of Port Townsend Bay, on a low bank, but deep enough waters for tall ships to moor. Hadlock established a large lumber mill. Lumber from the mill was shipped to San Francisco, and as far away as Australia and Hawaii. Two of the remaining buildings of the Washington Mill Company are what is known today as the Northwest School of Wooden Boat Building, and the residence of Samuel Hadlock, presently known as the Ajax Cafe. On the waterfront near the mill were a general store, post office, barber shop, livery stable, laundry, two hotels and two saloons. The saloons were frequented by sailors from all over the world as well as local mill workers, longshoremen, and loggers. There was little law enforcement and it was life in the Wild West. In 1909 construction started on the alcohol plant. It was completed in 1910, when it began manufacturing wood alcohol from sawdust. The operational costs of this venture proved too costly, and the plant suspended operation about 1913. The alcohol plant was renovated into a resort, which included an inn, restaurant, marina and art gallery. The resort has since closed and is currently for sale. The residential section was in upper Hadlock. After the lumber mill burned, businesses began to move uptown. William Sehrs of Sehrs Shipyard built the Masonic Temple in 1911. Sehrs completed other projects such as the Nordland ferry and bridges across Chimacum Creek. The Tri-Area was a growing, viable community. Subsequent industries have included a boat building yard and a clam cannery. In 1946 Melvin Kivley established the first businesses at the Hadlock intersection - a secondhand store and a Signal Service Station.Port Hadlock History References Category:Census-designated places in Jefferson County, Washington Category:Census-designated places in Washington (state) Category:Superfund sites in Washington (state) Category:Populated places on Puget Sound ","title":"Port Hadlock-Irondale, Washington"},{"id":"137972","text":"Port Ludlow is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson County, Washington, United States. It is also the name of the marine inlet on which the community is located. The CDP's population was 2,603 at the 2010 census, up from 1,968 at the 2000 census. Originally a logging and sawmill community, its economy declined during the first half of the 20th century. Following the completion of the nearby Hood Canal Bridge in 1960, Port Ludlow became the site of resorts and planned communities, attracting more affluent residents who were retired, buying vacation homes, or needing a more convenient commute to the business centers on the west side of Puget Sound. Based on per capita income, Port Ludlow ranks 16th of 522 ranked areas in the state of Washington, and the highest rank achieved in Jefferson County. Port Ludlow's location and marina facilities make it a convenient and popular port for leisure craft sailing between Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands. History Sawmill at Port Ludlow, 1900. Tall ships are docked to load timber. The United States Exploring Expedition, under Charles Wilkes, entered Puget Sound in 1841. Wilkes bestowed many patriotically American place names; at the time the sovereignty of the Oregon Country was yet to be resolved between Britain and the United States. Many of Wilkes's names commemorated American heroes and victories during the War of 1812. Port Ludlow was one of these, honoring Augustus Ludlow, a War of 1812 American naval hero. Early explorers of the Pacific Northwest often named sheltered inlets with names beginning with \\"Port\\". Communities that subsequently developed often adopted their inlet's name. Today Port Ludlow is both the name of the inlet and the community on its shore. To avoid confusion the inlet is sometimes called Port Ludlow Bay. The first shipments of timber from the Puget Sound to San Francisco in 1851 stimulated interest in the business potential of building sawmills on Puget Sound. John R. Thorndike and W. P. Sayward sailed to Puget Sound in 1852 and found the environs of Port Ludlow promising. Thorndike filed a timber claim of , and they started building a mill there. The initial mill housed two sash saws capable of producing of lumber daily. The trees along the banks of the bay were logged first, and then oxen and horses were used to bring more distant logs to the mill. The mill was leased in 1858 to the Amos & Phinney Company, of which A. Phinney became the resident manager. The U.S. Federal Census of 1860 designated Port Ludlow as one of the three enumeration districts in Jefferson County, Washington Territory. The census tally portrays the make-up of a young logging and sawmill community: Of the 124 people counted, 117 (94%) were adults between the ages of 20 and 50, and the remaining 7 were children. Of the adult population 112 (96%) were men and only 5 women, of which 3 were residing with husbands. 53 (47%) of the men were listed as lumbermen and 14 (13%) as sawyers. Of the total population, 94 (76%) were born in the United States, and of those all were born in the eastern half of the nation but two -- a two-year-old born in California and a one-year-old born in Washington Territory. Of the 30 (24%) who were foreign-born, 8 were born in England, 8 in Ireland, 6 in Canada, 4 in Germany, 2 in Norway, and one each in Australia and Denmark.United States Federal Census of 1860, Heritage Quest Online, ProQuest Online Databases The indigenous peoples were not counted in the 1860 census.

The population was 9,113 at the 2010 United States Census and an estimated 9,704 in 2018. It is the county seat and only incorporated city of Jefferson County. In addition to its natural scenery at the northeast tip of the Olympic Peninsula, the city is known for the many Victorian buildings remaining from its late 19th-century heyday, numerous annual cultural events, and as a maritime center for independent boatbuilders and related industries and crafts. The Port Townsend Historic District is a U.S. National Historic Landmark District. It is also significantly drier than the surrounding region due to being in the rainshadow of the Olympic Mountains, receiving only of rain per year. History The bay was originally named \\"Port Townshend\\" by Captain George Vancouver in 1792, for his friend the Marquis of Townshend. It was immediately recognized as a good safe harbor, although strong south winds and poor holding ground often make small-craft anchorage problematic off the town's waterfront. The official European- American settlement of the city of the same name took place on April 24, 1851. American Indian tribes located in what is now Jefferson County in the mid-19th century included the Chimakum (or Chemakum), Hoh (a group of the Quileute), Klallam (or Clallam), Quinault, and Twana (the Kilcid band ‚Äî Anglicized as \\"Quilcene\\"). Port Townsend is called the \\"City of Dreams\\" because of the early speculation that the city would be the largest harbor on the west coast of the United States. Guarding the gate of Puget Sound, it would become known by its other nickname, the \\"Key City\\", a title that remains to this day. By the late 19th century, Port Townsend was a well-known seaport, very active and banking on the future. Many homes and buildings were built during that time, with most of the architecture ornate Victorian. During this period, in 1888, the Port Townsend Police Department was established. Klallam people at Port Townsend, 1859, by James G. Swan Railroads were built to reach more areas in the 1870-1890s, and Port Townsend was to be the northwest extension of the rail lines. Its port was large and frequented by overseas vessels, so shipping of goods and timber from the area was a major part of the economy. Many of the buildings were built on the speculation that Port Townsend would become a booming shipping port and major city. When the depression hit, those plans lost the capital to continue and rail lines ended on the east side of Puget Sound, mainly in Tumwater, Tacoma, and Seattle. With the other Puget Sound ports growing in size, Port Townsend saw a rapid decline in population when the Northern Pacific Railroad failed to connect the city to the eastern Puget Sound city of Tacoma. By the late 1890s, the boom was over. Without the railroad to spur economic growth, the town shrank and investors looked elsewhere to make a good return. (The Milwaukee Road built a short spur to the pulpmill and barged cars over from Anacortes.) Over the decades that followed, Port Townsend maintained its economic stability in a variety of ways, including the development of artillery fortifications at Fort Worden. Many people left the area, and many buildings were abandoned. Port Townsend's economy was very weak until the 1920s, when a paper mill was built on the edge of the town. The bay is now home to Naval Magazine Indian Island, the US Navy's primary munitions-handling dock on the Pacific coast. Since the 1970s new residents, including many retirees, have moved to town. The waterfront retail district has restaurants, services, and tourist destinations. Since 1999, the city has had an annual international film festival in September. Other cultural programming, some at Fort Worden, now a state park, includes a Wooden Boat Festival, writers' conference, and blues and jazz festivals, in addition to music, dance, and live theatre performances. The town has two independent movie theaters, both upgraded by 2014 to handle digital film. Recognition of historic status Because of the speed at which the economy declined in the 1890s and the lack of any industry to replace it, very few of the Victorian buildings were torn down or built over in the intervening period. They were essentially preserved for nearly 100 years, when the value of protecting them was appreciated and fostered. Unlike most cities in the Pacific Northwest that were ravaged by natural and man-made disasters such as fire and earthquakes, prominent examples of public, private and business buildings from nearly every period of Port Townsend's history have survived to the present day. The Port Townsend Historic District, an area including many Victorian-era buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977. Architecture Bartlett House, 1883 Port Townsend is noted for its Victorian houses and significant historical buildings. The city has more than a dozen large, well-preserved buildings, including the Port Townsend Public Library (a 1913 Carnegie Library), the Federal Building (now commonly known as the city's post office), the Rose Theatre, and the Elks Lodge, which now houses Silverwater Cafe. Fort Worden, now a state park, has retained some of its pre- World War I architecture built when it was a military facility. Buildings have been adapted for other uses, including the publicly available Olympic Youth Hostel, which closed in 2011. The Jefferson County Courthouse is in a Romanesque architectural style, as popularized by Henry Hobson Richardson, with a 125-foot bell tower. In 1976, the Downtown waterfront and parts of Uptown were designated a Registered Historic District. Later, Fort Worden (now part of Fort Worden State Park) and the City of Port Townsend were designated National Historic Landmarks. The city is one of three Victorian seaports on the National Register of Historic Places. Bell Tower The Bell Tower on the bluff above downtown is one of two known towers of this type in the United States. It was used from 1890 to the 1940s to call volunteer firefighters. It was restored in 2003 by the Jefferson County Historical Society.Notes from Jefferson County Historical Society The second bell tower is located in Helena, Montana, and was also used for fire alarms during the late 19th century.

As of the 2010 Census, Burien's population was 33,313, which is a 49.7% increase since incorporation in 1993. An annexation in 2010 increased the city's population significantly, and as of 2019 the population was an estimated 51,500. History Settlement in the Burien area dates to 1864, when George Ouellet (1831‚Äì1899), a French-Canadian born in Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce, Quebec, purchased his first of several land patents for homestead sites directly from a federal land office.Highline Historical Society, Gottlieb Burian and His Family History: From Hussinetz, Silesia to Sunnydale, Washington, downloaded 29 July 2012 Ouellet had first arrived in the Washington Territory at Port Madison on Bainbridge Island, off the Kitsap Peninsula, in 1858. Three years after purchasing his homestead in the Burien area, he married 14-year-old Elizabeth Cushner, who was born in the Washington Territory, and started a family. Several years later, the Ouellet family moved to the White River Valley, near Auburn. A popular local tale recounts that an early settler named Mike Kelly gave the community its first name after he emerged from the trees and said, \\"This is truly a sunny dale.\\" Today, a few long-time residents still refer to the Burien area as Sunnydale. In 1884, Gottlieb Burian (1837‚Äì1902) and his wife Emma (Wurm) Burian (1840‚Äì1905), German immigrants from Hussinetz, Lower Silesia, who owned two taverns in downtown Seattle, arrived in Sunnydale. The tiny community was without improved roads or commercial buildings and was reached primarily by trails. Burian built a cabin on the southeast corner of Lake Burien and reportedly formed the community into a town bearing his name (misspelled over the years). A real estate office was built and soon attracted large numbers of new residents to Burien. In the early 1900s, visitors from Seattle came by the Mosquito Fleet to Three Tree Point, just west of town, to sunbathe and swim. In 1915, the Lake Burien Railway was completed. It ran on what is today Ambaum Boulevard from Burien to White Center to Seattle. A small passenger train ran the tracks and was affectionately named by the residents the Toonerville Trolley. However, in the summer, squished caterpillars made the track slippery, and in the winter, the tracks iced over. Soon the Toonerville Trolley was removed. Incorporation Several proposals to incorporate the greater Burien area, an unincorporated portion of King County, were attempted but failed. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, citizens felt they needed a more responsive government to help address the looming threat of the Port of Seattle's airport runway expansion (known as the \\"Third Runway\\") at Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport to the west, so an effort was again made to incorporate as a city. Citizens also felt that multi-family apartments and dwellings had proliferated out of control in Burien and other unincorporated areas of King County, and that they had no local voice in government, other than the King County Council, that would hear their concerns. The city of Burien was incorporated on February 28, 1993, after voter approval. North Highline annexation Three Tree Point in Burien at sunset Late in 2004, the city assessed the possibility of annexing North Highline (which includes White Center and Boulevard Park), \\"one of the largest urban unincorporated areas of King County,\\" which would double the size of Burien. Many citizens spoke against the annexation and created picket signs and petitions to protest against it. Other citizens welcomed the expansion, as they felt parts of the so-called North Highline area should have been part of the original Burien incorporation, and the area in question is part of the larger Highline area. (The Highline area includes the cities of Burien, Seatac, Des Moines, Federal Way and an unincorporated area called North Highline.) In May 2008, the Burien City Council proposed an annexation of the southern portion of North Highline, comprising 14,000 residents. In late summer of 2008, the city of Burien prepared to submit their annexation proposal to King County's Boundary Review Board. However, after the city of Seattle protested Burien's proposal, Burien opted to withdraw their annexation plan and resubmit it after new countywide planning policies went into effect. In October 2008, the Burien City Council voted to resubmit their annexation plan to the county Boundary Review Board. However, the cities of Burien and Seattle, along with King County and other stakeholders, first participated and completed mediation to ensure the interests of all parties involved were met. Affected stakeholders would have agreed to a preliminary annexation framework that stipulated how annexation would play out between the cities of Burien and Seattle and with King County. However, the Seattle City Council voted against the agreement that February. It is not known if Seattle has any future plans for annexation of any part of the North Highline area. On April 16, 2009, the Boundary Review Board of King County approved Burien's proposal for annexation of the southern portion of the North Highline area: parts of the Riverton-Boulevard Park CDP. In early May 2009, both King County and the city of Burien passed resolutions to place an annexation proposition on the August 18 primary ballot. The annexation area voted on consisted of southern North Highline and had an area of about and approximately 14,000 citizens. The ballot issue was approved by a majority of southern North Highline residents, and on April 1, 2010, southern North Highline became part of Burien. After the annexation vote, a special census was conducted, and it was determined that the newly annexed area had 14,292 residents. This resulted in a new population total of 49,858, making Burien the 23rd largest city in Washington State. The Boundary Review Board approved a second proposal for Burien to annex northern North Highline (also known as Area Y) in February 2012, but this was rejected by Area Y residents in November 2012.

The Cascade area (approximately a population of 17,000), which included much of unincorporated Benson Hill north of SE 200 Street and west of 128th Avenue SE, voted to be annexed by the city of Renton in 2007, effective March 1, 2008. The remaining unincorporated area of King County, which is primarily the Fairwood community, has the option of annexing to the city of Renton or incorporating as a city. In February 2005, the Fairwood Task Force filed a Notice of Intent to Incorporation with King County, to establish a new City of Fairwood. This attempt to incorporate was narrowly defeated in the election held on September 19, 2006. In that election, 48.22% of the votes were for incorporation; a swing of only 136 votes in the election would have changed the result. The process to form a City of Fairwood was restarted by the Fairwood Municipal Initiative when it filed another Notice of Proposed Incorporation with King County, Washington on April 16, 2007.Fairwood Municipal Initiative As of October 2008, the incorporation effort is now under the jurisdiction of the King County Boundary Review Board (BRB) and a consulting firm hired by the BRB is conducting an economic feasibility study for the proposed city of Fairwood. On November 3, 2009 Proposition 1 to incorporate a city of Fairwood failed again, as it did in 2006. Efforts are also ongoing to annex the Fairwood area into the city of Renton. Additionally, the Red Mill area of the Fairwood PAA is presently undertaking a separate petition-method annexation.Red Mill Annexation Map On November 2, 2010, 57.6% of voters voted against a proposition to annex Fairwood to Renton.Results ‚Äì King County Elections  References  Category:Census-designated places in King County, Washington ","title":"Fairwood, King County, Washington"},{"id":"137985","text":"Rudolph George Perpich Sr. (June 27, 1928 September 21, 1995) was an American politician and the longest-serving governor of Minnesota, serving a total of just over 10 years. A member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, he served as the 34th and 36th Governor of Minnesota from December 29, 1976 to January 4, 1979 and again from January 3, 1983 to January 7, 1991. He was also the state's only Roman Catholic governor and the only one to serve non-consecutive terms. Before entering politics, he was a dentist.  Early life and education  Rudolph George Prpiƒá was born in Carson Lake, Minnesota, which is now part of Hibbing. His father, Anton Prpiƒá, was a miner who had immigrated from Croatia to Minnesota's Mesabi Iron Range, and his mother, Mary (Vukelich), was an American of Croatian descent. Perpich did not learn to speak English until at least the first grade of elementary school. At 14, he began working for the Great Northern Railway. He graduated from Hibbing High School in 1946 and served two years in the United States Army. He then attended Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and graduated from Marquette University Dental School in 1954, whereupon he returned to Hibbing to practice dentistry.  Entry into politics  Perpich first entered politics by serving on the Hibbing school board in 1955‚Äì56. The board gained notability for instituting equal pay for male and female workers. In 1962, he was elected to the Minnesota Senate, representing the old 63rd District, which included portions of Saint Louis County in the northeastern part of the state. He was reelected in 1966. In 1970, Perpich was elected the 39th lieutenant governor of Minnesota. He was reelected in 1974 on a ticket with Governor Wendell R. Anderson. (Before 1974, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected separately in Minnesota.) He became governor when Anderson resigned in 1976 to take the United States Senate seat vacated by Walter Mondale, who had been elected Vice President of the United States. Perpich was the first Iron Range resident to hold the office. Gubernatorial campaigns Nearly the entire DFL Party ticket was defeated in 1978; the defeated candidates included Perpich and the candidates for both U.S. Senate seats. Anderson's arrangement to have himself appointed to the Senate and Perpich's role in that appointment were deemed major factors in those defeats. Perpich worked at Control Data Corporation in New York and Austria for several years. In 1982, he challenged the DFL Party's endorsed candidate for governor, Warren Spannaus, in the primary election, and won. He then defeated Independent-Republican nominee Wheelock Whitney in the general election. Perpich served as the Chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association in 1984. Perpich was reelected in 1986, but lost to Arne Carlson in 1990, a bizarre campaign in which Carlson replaced the Independent-Republican Party's candidate Jon Grunseth, who had beaten Carlson in the primary. (After Carlson's surprise primary defeat, a bipartisan, grassroots group, Minnesotans for the WRITE Choice, launched a noisy, media-intensive campaign urging Carlson to re-challenge Grunseth.) Grunseth was forced to withdraw amid allegations of a sex scandal just two weeks before the election. Perpich was Minnesota's last DFL governor until Mark Dayton was elected in 2010. Colorful behavior and international goals Perpich had a reputation for colorful behavior. At one point while governor, he donated his $25,000 pay raise to help promote bocce.1978-04-26. Kinney requests bocce balls. Duluth News Tribune, 5B He also pitched an idea for a chopstick factory to be built in northern Minnesota, and proposed selling the governor's mansion in Saint Paul as a cost-saving measure. Newsweek brought Perpich national attention by bestowing on him the nickname \\"Governor Goofy\\", crystallizing the combination of affection and resentment his habits elicited.Newsweek ‚Äì June 17, 1990: \\"Bad Manners In Minnesota\\" During his last years in office, commentators wondered whether he would shoot to stardom as a presidential hopeful or, as governor, sour Minnesota voters on the DFL party with questionable public relations. But Perpich's activist vision of the governor's role was later cited as an important contribution to the Minnesota economy, even by such unlikely admirers as his 1990 rival and successor Arne Carlson, who said in 2005 that Perpich \\"was the first person that I was aware of to focus on the international role that states are going to have to play.\\" Perpich's legacy of projects in Minnesota include the Minnesota World Trade Center in Saint Paul, the Perpich Center for Arts Education in Golden Valley, the Center for Victims of Torture in Minneapolis, the University of Minnesota Duluth Natural Resources Research Institute, and the Mall of America in Bloomington. Additionally, he worked to promote Minnesota on the international stage by traveling to 17 countries in 1984, and bringing the foreign leaders Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and Dr. Franjo Tuƒëman of Croatia to the state in 1990. Perpich opposed the Reagan proxy war against Nicaragua in the 1980s and was one of several governors who objected to sending their National Guard units to train in U.S. bases in Honduras, where the U.S.-backed Contras were based. The Contras carried out atrocities in Nicaragua to topple the leftist government there. Perpich was the plaintiff in the 1990 U.S. Supreme Court case Perpich v. Department of Defense, which established that the U.S. Department of Defense could send state National Guard units overseas over the governor's objection.  Post-political life  After leaving office in 1991, Perpich went to Zagreb, Croatia, to assist its post-communist government. In 1992 he moved to Paris, France, for a business consulting position. He returned to Minnesota in 1993. In 1995, at the age of 67, Perpich died of colon cancer in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka. He is buried in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.

Harm reduction, or harm minimization, refers to a range of public health policies designed to lessen the negative social and/or physical consequences associated with various human behaviors, both legal and illegal. Harm reduction policies are used to manage behaviors such as recreational drug use and sexual activity in numerous settings that range from services through to geographical regions. Needle-exchange programmes reduce the likelihood of users of heroin and other drugs sharing the syringes and using them more than once. Syringe-sharing can lead to infections such as HIV or hepatitis C, which can spread from user to user through the reuse of syringes contaminated with infected blood. Needle and syringe programme (NSP) and Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) outlets in some settings offer basic primary health care. Supervised injection sites are legally sanctioned, medically supervised facilities designed to address public nuisance associated with drug use and provide a hygienic and stress-free environment for drug consumers. The facilities provide sterile injection equipment, information about drugs and basic health care, treatment referrals, and access to medical staff. Opioid replacement therapy (ORT), or opioid substitution therapy (OST), is the medical procedure of replacing an illegal opioid, such as heroin, with a longer acting but less euphoric opioid; methadone or buprenorphine are typically used and the drug is taken under medical supervision. Another approach is Heroin assisted treatment, in which medical prescriptions for pharmaceutical heroin (diacetylmorphine) are provided to heroin-dependent people. Toronto's Seaton House became the first homeless shelter in Canada to operate a \\"wet shelter\\" on a \\"managed alcohol\\" principle in which clients are served a glass of wine once an hour unless staff determine that they are too inebriated to continue. Previously, homeless alcoholics opted to stay on the streets often seeking alcohol from unsafe sources such as mouthwash, rubbing alcohol or industrial products which, in turn, resulted in frequent use of emergency medical facilities. To reduce the likelihood that street users will consume adulterated or misidentified drugs, such as MDMA, some agencies offer drug checking to reduce overdose risks. Media campaigns inform drivers of the dangers of driving drunk. Most alcohol users are now aware of these dangers and safe ride techniques like 'designated drivers' and free taxicab programmes are reducing the number of drunk-driving accidents. Many schools now provide safer sex education to teen and pre-teen students, who may engage in sexual activity. Since some adolescents are going to have sex, a harm-reductionist approach supports a sexual education which emphasizes the use of protective devices like condoms and dental dams to protect against unwanted pregnancy and the transmission of STIs. Since 1999 some countries have legalized prostitution, such as Germany (2002) and New Zealand (2003). Many street-level harm-reduction strategies have succeeded in reducing HIV transmission in injecting drug users and sex-workers. HIV education, HIV testing, condom use, and safer-sex negotiation greatly decreases the risk to the disease. Drug use US yearly overdose deaths from all drugs. In the case of recreational drug use, harm reduction is put forward as a useful perspective alongside the more conventional approaches of demand and supply reduction. Many advocates argue that prohibitionist laws criminalise people for suffering from a disease and cause harm; for example, by obliging drug addicts to obtain drugs of unknown purity from unreliable criminal sources at high prices, thereby increasing the risk of overdose and death. The website Erowid.org collects and publishes information and first-hand experience reports about all kinds of drugs to educate (potential) drug users. While the vast majority of harm reduction initiatives are educational campaigns or facilities that aim to reduce drug-related harm, a unique social enterprise was launched in Denmark in September 2013 to reduce the financial burden of illicit drug use for people with a drug dependence. Michael Lodberg Olsen, who was previously involved with the establishment of a drug consumption facility in Denmark, announced the founding of the Illegal magazine that will be sold by drug users in Copenhagen and the district of Vesterbro, who will be able to direct the profits from sales towards drug procurement. Olsen explained: \\"No one has solved the problem of drug addiction, so is it not better that people find the money to buy their drugs this way than through crime and prostitution?\\" DrugsDepressantsAlcohol Traditionally, homeless shelters ban alcohol. In 1997, as the result of an inquest into the deaths of two homeless alcoholics two years earlier, Toronto's Seaton House became the first homeless shelter in Canada to operate a \\"wet shelter\\" on a \\"managed alcohol\\" principle in which clients are served a glass of wine once an hour unless staff determine that they are too inebriated to continue. Previously, homeless alcoholics opted to stay on the streets often seeking alcohol from unsafe sources such as mouthwash, rubbing alcohol or industrial products which, in turn, resulted in frequent use of emergency medical facilities. The programme has been duplicated in other Canadian cities, and a study of Ottawa's \\"wet shelter\\" found that emergency room visit and police encounters by clients were cut by half. The study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal in 2006, found that serving chronic street alcoholics controlled doses of alcohol also reduced their overall alcohol consumption. Researchers found that programme participants cut their alcohol use from an average of 46 drinks a day when they entered the programme to an average of 8 drinks and that their visits to emergency rooms dropped from 13.5 to an average of 8 per month, while encounters with the police fall from 18.1 to an average of 8.8. Downtown Emergency Service Center (DESC), in Seattle, Washington, operates several Housing First programmes which utilize the harm reduction model. University of Washington researchers, partnering with DESC, found that providing housing and support services for homeless alcoholics costs taxpayers less than leaving them on the street, where taxpayer money goes towards police and emergency health care. Results of the study funded by the Substance Abuse Policy Research Program (SAPRP) of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association in April 2009. This first controlled assessment in the U.S. of the effectiveness of Housing First, specifically targeting chronically-homeless alcoholics, showed that the programme saved taxpayers more than $4 million over the first year of operation. During the first six months, the study reported an average cost-savings of 53 percent (even after considering the cost of administering the housing's 95 residents)‚Äînearly $2,500 per month per person in health and social services, compared to the per month costs of a wait-list control group of 39 homeless people. Further, despite the fact residents are not required to be abstinent or in treatment for alcohol use, stable housing also results in reduced drinking among homeless alcoholics. Alcohol-related programmes A high amount of media coverage exists informing users of the dangers of driving drunk. Most alcohol users are now aware of these dangers and safe ride techniques like 'designated drivers' and free taxicab programmes are reducing the number of drunk-driving accidents. Many cities have free- ride-home programmes during holidays involving high alcohol abuse, and some bars and clubs will provide a visibly drunk patron with a free cab ride. In New South Wales groups of licensees have formed local liquor accords and collectively developed, implemented and promoted a range of harm minimisation programmes including the aforementioned 'designated driver' and 'late night patron transport' schemes. Many of the transport schemes are free of charge to patrons, to encourage them to avoid drink-driving and at the same time reduce the impact of noisy patrons loitering around late night venues. Moderation Management is a programme which helps drinkers to cut back on their consumption of alcohol by encouraging safe drinking behaviour. The HAMS Harm Reduction Network is a programme which encourages any positive change with regard to the use of alcohol or other mood altering substances. HAMS encourages goals of safer drinking, reduced drinking, moderate drinking, or abstinence. The choice of the goal is up to the individual. Harm reduction in alcohol dependency could be instituted by use of naltrexone. Opioids=Heroin maintenance programmes (HAT) Timeline of total number of U.S. overdose deaths involving heroin. Providing medical prescriptions for pharmaceutical heroin (diacetylmorphine) to heroin-dependent people has been employed in some countries to address problems associated with the illicit use of the drug, as potential benefits exist for the individual and broader society. Evidence has indicated that this form of treatment can greatly improve the health and social circumstances of participants, while also reducing costs incurred by criminalisation, incarceration and health interventions. In Switzerland, heroin assisted treatment is an established programme of the national health system. Several dozen centres exist throughout the country and heroin-dependent people can administer heroin in a controlled environment at these locations. The Swiss heroin maintenance programme is generally regarded as a successful and valuable component of the country's overall approach to minimising the harms caused by illicit drug use. In a 2008 national referendum, a majority of 68 per cent voted in favour of continuing the Swiss programme. The Netherlands has studied medically supervised heroin maintenance.Results of two major clinical studies involving 547 heroin treatment patients are available from the CCBH (Central Committee on the Treatment of Heroin Addicts) website. A German study of long-term heroin addicts demonstrated that diamorphine was significantly more effective than methadone in keeping patients in treatment and in improving their health and social situation. Many participants were able to find employment, some even started a family after years of homelessness and delinquency. Since then, treatment had continued in the cities that participated in the pilot study, until heroin maintenance was permanently included into the national health system in May 2009. A heroin maintenance programme has existed in the United Kingdom (UK) since the 1920s, as drug addiction was seen as an individual health problem. Addiction to opiates was rare in the 1920s and was mostly limited to either middle-class people who had easy access due to their profession, or people who had become addicted as a side effect of medical treatment. In the 1950s and 1960s a small number of doctors contributed to an alarming increase in the number of drug-addicted people in the U.K. through excessive prescribing‚Äîthe U.K. switched to more restrictive drug legislation as a result.Rachel Lart BRITISH MEDICAL PERCEPTION FROM ROLLESTON TO BRAIN, CHANGING IMAGES OF THE ADDICT AND ADDICTION However, the British government is again moving towards a consideration of heroin prescription as a legitimate component of the National Health Service (NHS). Evidence has clearly shown that methadone maintenance is not appropriate for all opioid-dependent people and that heroin is a viable maintenance drug that has shown equal or better rates of success.Access a British report on heroin maintenance entitled Prescribing Heroin: what is the evidence? A committee appointed by the Norwegian government completed an evaluation of research reports on heroin maintenance treatment that were available internationally. In 2011 the committee concluded that the presence of numerous uncertainties and knowledge gaps regarding the effects of heroin treatment meant that it could not recommend the introduction of heroin maintenance treatment in Norway.Norges forskningsr√•d:For svakt grunnlag,01.09.2011 The first, and only, North American heroin maintenance project is being run in Vancouver, B.C. and Montreal, Quebec. Currently, over 80 long-term heroin addicts who have not been helped by available treatment options are taking part in the North American Opiate Medication Initiative (NAOMI) trials. However, critics have alleged that the control group gets unsustainably low doses of methadone, making them prone to fail and thus rigging the results in favor of heroin maintenance. Critics of heroin maintenance programmes object to the high costs of providing heroin to users. The British heroin study cost the British government ¬£15,000 per participant per year, roughly equivalent to average heroin user's expense of ¬£15,600 per year. 2009 Drug Free AustraliaDrug Free Australia p 3 contrast these ongoing maintenance costs with Sweden's investment in, and commitment to, a drug-free society where a policy of compulsory rehabilitation of drug addicts is integral, which has yielded the one of the lowest reported illicit drug use levels in the developed world,UNODC 2001 pp. 162‚Äì65 (see aggregated average for each OECD country in Harm Reduction Discussion page). a model in which successfully rehabilitated users present no further maintenance costs to their community, as well as reduced ongoing health care costs. A substantial part of the money for buying heroin is obtained through criminal activities, such as robbery or drug dealing. King's Health Partners notes that the cost of providing free heroin for a year is about one-third of the cost of placing the user in prison for a year. Naloxone distribution Naloxone is a drug used to counter an overdose from the effect of opioids; for example, a heroin or morphine overdose. Naloxone displaces the opioid molecules from the brain's receptors and reverses the respiratory depression caused by an overdose within two to eight minutes. The World Health Organization (WHO) includes naloxone on their \\"List of Essential Medicines\\", and recommends its availability and utilization for the reversal of opioid overdoses. Formal programs in which the opioid inverse agonist drug naloxone is distributed have been trialled and implemented. Established programs distribute naloxone, as per WHO's minimum standards, to drug users and their peers, family members, police, prisons, and others. These treatment programs and harm reduction centres operate in Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Norway, Russia, Spain, Tajikistan, the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), Vietnam, India, Thailand, Kyrgyzstan, Denmark and Estonia.EMCDDA event: 'Take home naloxone to reduce fatalities: scaling up a participatory intervention across Europe 14 October 2014, Lisbon. Opioid replacement therapy (ORT) Non-methadone synthetics is a category dominated by illegally acquired fentanyl, and has been excluded to more accurately reflect deaths from prescription opioids.Overdose Death Rates. By National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Opioid replacement therapy (ORT), or opioid substitution therapy (OST), is the medical procedure of replacing an illegal opioid, such as heroin, with a longer acting but less euphoric opioid; methadone or buprenorphine are typically used and the drug is taken under medical supervision.Richard P. Mattick et al.: National Evaluation of Pharmacotherapies for Opioid Dependence (NEPOD): Report of Results and Recommendation Some formulations of buprenorphine incorporate the opiate antagonist naloxone during the production of the pill form to prevent people from crushing the tablets and injecting them, instead of using the sublingual (under the tongue) route of administration. In some countries, such as Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, patients may be treated with slow-release morphine when methadone is deemed inappropriate due to the individual's circumstances. In Germany, dihydrocodeine has been used off-label in ORT for many years, however it is no longer frequently prescribed for this purpose. Extended-release dihydrocodeine is again in current use in Austria for this reason. Research into the usefulness of piritramide, extended-release hydromorphone (including polymer implants lasting up to 90 days), dihydroetorphine and other drugs for ORT is at various stages in a number of countries. The driving principle behind ORT is the program's capacity to facilitate a resumption of stability in the user's life, while they experience reduced symptoms of withdrawal symptoms and less intense drug cravings; however, a strong euphoric effect is not experienced as a result of the treatment drug. In some countries (not the US, UK, Canada, or Australia), regulations enforce a limited time period for people on ORT programs that conclude when a stable economic and psychosocial situation is achieved. (Patients suffering from HIV/AIDS or Hepatitis C are usually excluded from this requirement.) In practice, 40‚Äì65% of patients maintain complete abstinence from opioids while receiving opioid replacement therapy, and 70‚Äì95% are able to reduce their use significantly, while experiencing a concurrent elimination or reduction in medical (improper diluents, non-sterile injecting equipment), psychosocial (mental health, relationships), and legal (arrest and imprisonment) issues that can arise from the use of illicit opioids. Opioid substitution therapy (OST) NSP and opioid substitution therapy (OST) outlets in some settings also offer basic primary health care. These are known as 'targeted primary health care outlet'- as these outlets primarily target people who inject drugs and/or 'low-threshold health care outlet'- as these reduce common barriers clients often face when they try to access health care from the conventional health care outlets. For accessing sterile injecting equipment clients frequently visit NSP outlets, and for receiving pharmacotherapy (e.g. methadone, buprenorphine) they visit OST clinics; these frequent visits are used opportunistically to offer much needed health care. These targeted outlets have the potential to mitigate clients' perceived barriers to access to healthcare delivered in traditional settings. The provision of accessible, acceptable and opportunistic services which are responsive to the needs of this population is valuable, facilitating a reduced reliance on inappropriate and cost-ineffective emergency department care. =Psychedelics= The Zendo Project conducted by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies uses principles from psychedelic therapy to provide safe places and emotional support for people having difficult experiences on psychedelic drugs at select festivals such as Burning Man, Boom Festival, and Lightning in a Bottle without medical or law enforcement intervention. Drugs such as MDMA (commonly sold by the slang names \\"ecstasy\\" and \\"molly\\") are often adulterated. One harm reduction approach is drug checking, where people intending to use drugs can have their substances tested for content and purity so that they can then make more informed decisions about safer consumption. European organisations have offered drug checking services since 1992 and these services now operate in over twenty countries. As an example, the nonprofit organization DanceSafe offers on-site testing of the contents of pills and powders at various electronic music events around the US. They also sell kits for users to test the contents of drugs themselves. PillReports.com invites ecstasy users to send samples of drugs for laboratory testing and publishes the results online. Cannabis Specific harms associated with cannabis include increased accident-rate while driving under intoxication, dependence, psychosis, detrimental psychosocial outcomes for adolescent users and respiratory disease. Some safer cannabis usage campaigns including the UKCIA (United Kingdom Cannabis Internet Activists) encourage methods of consumption shown to cause less physical damage to a users body, including oral (eating) consumption, vaporization, the usage of bongs which cool and to some extent filters the smoke, and smoking the cannabis without mixing it with tobacco. The fact that cannabis possession carries prison sentences in most developed countries is also pointed out as a problem by European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), as the consequences of a conviction for otherwise law-abiding users arguably is more harmful than any harm from the drug itself. For example, by adversely affecting employment opportunities, impacting civil rights, and straining personal relationships. Some people like Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance have suggested that organized marijuana legalization would encourage safe use and reveal the factual adverse effects from exposure to this herb's individual chemicals. The way the laws concerning cannabis are enforced is also very selective, even discriminatory. Statistics show that the socially disadvantaged, immigrants and ethnic minorities have significantly higher arrest rates. Drug decriminalisation, such as allowing the possession of small amounts of cannabis and possibly its cultivation for personal use, would alleviate these harms. Where decriminalisation has been implemented, such as in several states in Australia and United States, as well as in Portugal and the Netherlands no, or only very small adverse effects have been shown on population cannabis usage rate. The lack of evidence of increased use indicates that such a policy shift does not have adverse effects on cannabis- related harm while, at the same time, decreasing enforcement costs. In the last few years certain strains of the cannabis plant with higher concentrations of THC and drug tourism have challenged the former policy in the Netherlands and led to a more restrictive approach; for example, a ban on selling cannabis to tourists in coffeeshops suggested to start late 2011. Sale and possession of cannabis is still illegal in PortugalEMCDDA:Drug policy profiles, Portugal, June 2011 and possession of cannabis is a federal crime in the United States. =StimulantsTobacco Tobacco harm reduction describes actions taken to lower the health risks associated with using tobacco, especially combustible forms, without abstaining completely from tobacco and nicotine. Some of these measures include switching to safer (lower tar) cigarettes, switching to snus or dipping tobacco, or using a non-tobacco nicotine delivery systems. In recent years, the growing use of electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation, whose long-term safety remains uncertain, has sparked an ongoing controversy among medical and public health between those who seek to restrict and discourage all use until more is known and those who see them as a useful approach for harm reduction, whose risks are most unlikely to equal those of smoking tobacco. \\"Their usefulness in tobacco harm reduction as a substitute for tobacco products is unclear, but in an effort to decrease tobacco related death and disease, they have a potential to be part of the strategy. It is widely acknowledged that discontinuation of all tobacco products confers the greatest lowering of risk. However, there is a considerable population of inveterate smokers who are unable or unwilling to achieve abstinence. Harm reduction may be of substantial benefit to these individuals. Routes of administrationNeedle exchange programmes (NEP)= bin allowing for safe disposal of needles in a public toilet in Caernarfon, Wales. The use of some illicit drugs can involve hypodermic needles. In some areas (notably in many parts of the US), these are available solely by prescription. Where availability is limited, users of heroin and other drugs frequently share the syringes and use them more than once. As a result, infections such as HIV or hepatitis C can spread from user to user through the reuse of syringes contaminated with infected blood. The principles of harm reduction propose that syringes should be easily available or at least available through a needle and syringe programmes (NSP). Where syringes are provided in sufficient quantities, rates of HIV are much lower than in places where supply is restricted. In many countries users are supplied equipment free of charge, others require payment or an exchange of dirty needles for clean ones, hence the name. A 2010 review found insufficient evidence that NSP prevents transmission of the hepatitis C virus, tentative evidence that it prevents transmission of HIV and sufficient evidence that it reduces self- reported injecting risk behaviour. It has been shown in the many evaluations of needle-exchange programmes that in areas where clean syringes are more available, illegal drug use is no higher than in other areas. Needle exchange programmes have reduced HIV incidence by 33% in New Haven and 70% in New York City. The Melbourne, Australia inner-city suburbs of Richmond and Abbotsford are locations in which the use and dealing of heroin has been concentrated for a protracted time period. Research organisation the Burnet Institute completed the 2013 'North Richmond Public Injecting Impact Study' in collaboration with the Yarra Drug and Health Forum, City of Yarra and North Richmond Community Health Centre and recommended 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment due to the ongoing \\"widespread, frequent and highly visible\\" nature of illicit drug use in the areas. During the period between 2010 and 2012 a four-fold increase in the levels of inappropriately discarded injecting equipment was documented for the two suburbs. In the local government area the City of Yarra, of which Richmond and Abbotsford are parts of, 1550 syringes were collected each month from public syringe disposal bins in 2012. Furthermore, ambulance callouts for heroin overdoses were 1.5 times higher than for other Melbourne areas in the period between 2011 and 2012 (a total of 336 overdoses), and drug-related arrests in North Richmond were also three times higher than the state average. The Burnet Institute's researchers interviewed health workers, residents and local traders, in addition to observing the drug scene in the most frequented North Richmond public injecting locations. On 28 May 2013, the Burnet Institute stated in the media that it recommends 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray after the area's drug culture continues to grow after more than ten years of intense law enforcement efforts. The Institute's research concluded that public injecting behaviour is frequent in the area and inappropriately discarding injecting paraphernalia has been found in carparks, parks, footpaths and drives. Furthermore, people who inject drugs have broken open syringe disposal bins to reuse discarded injecting equipment. The British public body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), introduced a new recommendation in early April 2014 due to an increase in the presentation of the number of young people who inject steroids at UK needle exchanges. NICE previously published needle exchange guidelines in 2009, in which needle and syringe services are not advised for people under the age of 18 years, but the organisation's director Professor Mike Kelly explained that a \\"completely different group\\" of people were presenting at programs. In the updated guidance, NICE recommended the provision of specialist services for \\"rapidly increasing numbers of steroid users\\", and that needles should be provided to people under the age of 18‚Äîa first for NICE‚Äîfollowing reports of 15-year-old steroid injectors seeking to develop their muscles. Supervised injection sites (SIS) A clandestine kit containing materials to inject illicit drugs (or legitimate ones illegitimately). Injection kit obtained from a needle-exchange programme. Supervised injection sites (SIS), or Drug consumption rooms (DCR), are legally sanctioned, medically supervised facilities designed to address public nuisance associated with drug use and provide a hygienic and stress-free environment for drug consumers. The facilities provide sterile injection equipment, information about drugs and basic health care, treatment referrals, and access to medical staff. Some offer counseling, hygienic and other services of use to itinerant and impoverished individuals. Most programmes prohibit the sale or purchase of illegal drugs. Many require identification cards. Some restrict access to local residents and apply other admission criteria, such as they have to be injection drug users, but generally in Europe they don't exclude addicts who consume by other means. The Netherlands had the first staffed injection room, although they did not operate under explicit legal support until 1996. Instead, the first center where it was legal to inject drug was in Berne, Switzerland, opened 1986. In 1994, Germany opened its first site. Although, as in the Netherlands they operated in a \\"gray area\\", supported by the local authorities and with consent from the police until the Bundestag provided a legal exemption in 2000. In Europe, Luxembourg, Spain and Norway have opened facilities after year 2000. As did the two existing facilities outside Europe, with Sydney's Medically Supervised Injecting Center (MSIC) established in May 2001 as a trial and Vancouver's Insite, opened in September 2003. In 2010, after a nine-year trial, the Sydney site was confirmed as a permanent public health facility. As of late 2009 there were a total of 92 professionally supervised injection facilities in 61 cities. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction's latest systematic review from April 2010 did not find any evidence to support concerns that DCR might \\"encourage drug use, delay treatment entry or aggravate problems of local drug markets.\\" J√ºrgen Rehm and Benedikt Fischer explained that while evidence show that DCR are successful, that \\"interpretation is limited by the weak designs applied in many evaluations, often represented by the lack of adequate control groups.\\" Concluding that this \\"leaves the door open for alternative interpretations of data produced and subsequent ideological debate.\\" The EMCDDA review noted that research into the effects of the facilities \\"faces methodological challenges in taking account of the effects of broader local policy or ecological changes\\", still they concluded \\"that the facilities reach their target population and provide immediate improvements through better hygiene and safety conditions for injectors.\\" Further that \\"the availability of safer injecting facilities does not increase levels of drug use or risky patterns of consumption, nor does it result in higher rates of local drug acquisition crime.\\" While its usage is \\"associated with self-reported reductions in injecting risk behaviour such as syringe sharing, and in public drug use\\" and \\"with increased uptake of detoxification and treatment services.\\" However, \\"a lack of studies, as well as methodological problems such as isolating the effect from other interventions or low coverage of the risk population, evidence regarding DCRs‚Äîwhile encouraging‚Äîis insufficient for drawing conclusions with regard to their effectiveness in reducing HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) incidence.\\" Concluding with that \\"there is suggestive evidence from modelling studies that they may contribute to reducing drug-related deaths at a city level where coverage is adequate, the review-level evidence of this effect is still insufficient.\\" Critics of this intervention, such as drug prevention advocacy organisations, Drug Free Australia and Real Women of Canada point to the most rigorous evaluations, those of Sydney and Vancouver. Two of the centers, in Sydney, Australia and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada cost $2.7 millionNCHECR, 2007 p. 35 and $3 million per annum to operate respectively,see 2008 yet Canadian mathematical modeling, where there was caution about validity, indicated just one life saved from fatal overdose per annum for Vancouver,see Executive Summary of 20082 June 2008 while the Drug Free Australia analysis demonstrates the Sydney facility statistically takes more than a year to save one life. pp. 26, 27 The Expert Advisory Committee of the Canadian Government studied claims by journal studies for reduced HIV transmission by Insite but \\"were not convinced that these assumptions were entirely valid.\\" The Sydney facility showed no improvement in public injecting and discarded needles beyond improvements caused by a coinciding heroin drought, pp. 31‚Äì34 while the Vancouver facility had an observable impact. Drug dealing and loitering around the facilities were evident in the Sydney evaluation,2003 MSIC Evaluation Committee 2003 p. 147 but not evident for the Vancouver facility. Sex=Safer sex programmes Many schools now provide safer sex education to teen and pre-teen students, who may engage in sexual activity. Since some adolescents are going to have sex, a harm- reductionist approach supports a sexual education which emphasizes the use of protective devices like condoms and dental dams to protect against unwanted pregnancy and the transmission of STIs. This runs contrary to abstinence-only sex education, which teaches that educating children about sex can encourage them to engage in it. These programmes have been found to decrease risky sexual behaviour and prevent sexually transmitted diseases. They also reduce rates of unwanted pregnancies. Abstinence only programmes do not appear to affect HIV risks in developed countries with no evidence available for other areas. Legalized prostitution Since 1999 some countries have legalized prostitution, such as Germany (2002) and New Zealand (2003). However, in most countries the practice is prohibited. Gathering accurate statistics on prostitution and human trafficking is extremely difficult. This has resulted in proponents of legalization claiming that it reduces organized crime rates while opponents claim exactly the converse. The Dutch prostitution policy, which is one of the most liberal in the world, has gone back and forth on the issue several times. In the period leading up to 2015 up to a third of officially sanctioned work places had been closed down again after reports of human trafficking. Prostitutes themselves are generally opposed to what they see as \\"theft of their livelihood\\" Sex work and HIV Despite the depth of knowledge of HIV/AIDS, rapid transmission has occurred globally in sex workers. The relationship between these two variables greatly increases the risk of transmission among these populations, and also to anyone associated with them, such as their sexual partners, their children, and eventually the population at large. Many street-level harm-reduction strategies have succeeded in reducing HIV transmission in injecting drug users and sex- workers. HIV education, HIV testing, condom use, and safer-sex negotiation greatly decreases the risk to the disease. Peer education as a harm reduction strategy has especially reduced the risk of HIV infection, such as in Chad, where this method was the most cost-effective per infection prevented. Decriminalisation The threat of criminal repercussions drives sex-workers and injecting drug users to the margins of society, often resulting in high- risk behaviour, increasing the rate of overdose, infectious disease transmission, and violence. Decriminalisation as a harm-reduction strategy gives the ability to treat drug abuse solely as a public health issue rather than a criminal activity. This enables other harm-reduction strategies to be employed, which results in a lower incidence of HIV infection. Psychiatric medications With the growing concern about psychiatric medication adverse effects and long-term dependency, peer-run mental health groups Freedom Center and The Icarus Project published the Harm Reduction Guide to Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs. The self-help guide provides patients with information to help assess risks and benefits, and to prepare to come off, reduce, or continue medications when their physicians are unfamiliar with or unable to provide this guidance. The guide is in circulation among mental health consumer groups and has been translated into ten languages. Criticism Critics, such as Drug Free America Foundation and other members of network International Task Force on Strategic Drug Policy, state that a risk posed by harm reduction is by creating the perception that certain behaviours can be partaken of safely, such as illicit drug use, that it may lead to an increase in that behaviour by people who would otherwise be deterred. The signatories of the drug prohibitionist network International Task Force on Strategic Drug Policy stated that they oppose drug use harm reduction \\"...strategies as endpoints that promote the false notion that there are safe or responsible ways to use drugs. That is, strategies in which the primary goal is to enable drug users to maintain addictive, destructive, and compulsive behavior by misleading users about some drug risks while ignoring others.\\" In 2008, the World Federation Against Drugs stated that while \\"...some organizations and local governments actively advocate the legalization of drugs and promote policies such as \\"harm reduction\\" that accept drug use and do not help drug users to become free from drug abuse. This undermines the international efforts to limit the supply of and demand for drugs.\\" The Federation states that harm reduction efforts often end up being \\"drug legalization or other inappropriate relaxation efforts, a policy approach that violates the UN Conventions.\\" Critics furthermore reject harm reduction measures for allegedly trying to establish certain forms of drug use as acceptable in society. The Drug Prevention Network of Canada states that harm reduction has \\"...come to represent a philosophy in which illicit substance use is seen as largely unpreventable, and increasingly, as a feasible and acceptable lifestyle as long as use is not 'problematic'\\", an approach which can increase \\"acceptance of drug use into the mainstream of society\\". They say harm reduction \\"...sends the wrong message to...children and youth\\" about drug use. In 2008, the Declaration of World Forum Against Drugs criticized harm reduction policies that \\"...accept drug use and do not help drug users to become free from drug abuse\\", which the group say undermines \\"...efforts to limit the supply of and demand for drugs.\\" They state that harm reduction should not lead to less efforts to reduce drug demand. Pope Benedict XVI criticised harm reduction policies with regards to HIV/AIDS, saying that it was \\"a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems\\". This position was in turn widely criticised for misrepresenting and oversimplifying the role of condoms in preventing infections. Neil Hunt's article entitled \\"A review of the evidence-base for harm reduction approaches to drug use\\" examines the criticisms of harm reduction, which include claims that it is not effective; that it prevents addicts from \\"hitting a rock bottom\\" thus trapping them in addiction; that it encourages drug use; that harm reduction is a Trojan horse strategy for \\"drug law reform\\", such as drug legalization.

It is part of the Eastside region, located to the east of Seattle, and is bordered by the cities and towns of Bellevue, Kirkland, Medina, Yarrow Point and Hunts Point. The population was 2,984 at the 2010 census. Based on per capita income, Clyde Hill ranks 4th of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked. In 2014, it was listed as the most affluent town in Washington State by Slate. Clyde Hill is also ranked 10th in the United States for most landscapers hired per square mile, at about 1,000 households per mile. The majority of Clyde Hill is zoned for single-family use with the exception of two commercially zoned areas: a gas station and a coffee shop. In addition to a small government zone, the City is home to four schools: two public schools - Clyde Hill Elementary and Chinook Middle School; and two private schools: Bellevue Christian School and Sacred Heart School. The City's minimum lot size is 20,000 square feet, although many smaller lots exist that pre-date the incorporation of the City. Geography Clyde Hill is located at (47.630171, -122.216559). The top elevation is close to 375 feet. There are approximately 21 miles of public roadway that make Clyde Hill very centrally located within the Seattle - Bellevue metro area. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. History Between 1946 and 1948, J. Gordon and Mary Schneidler subdivided and sold more than a dozen lots in a five-acre subdivision in Clyde Hill. Each deed of sale included the following restriction: \\"This property shall not be resold, leased, rented or occupied except to or by persons of the Aryan race.\\" Why the Schneidlers used the term \\"Aryan race\\" is unclear. That racial concept usually meant northern Europeans as distinct from Eastern and Southern Europeans. The Aryans-only restriction thus would have excluded Italians, Greeks, Poles, Russians, and many other European ancestries as well as Jews and all non Europeans. In response to the community's desire to control land use development such as lot size and commercial zoning, Clyde Hill was officially incorporated as a Town on March 31, 1953. On November 10, 1998, the Council voted to organize Clyde Hill as a non-charter Code City. In 1953 area residents voted to become an incorporated Town by a vote of 145 to 117. Ken Day defeated Don Clark for the first Clyde Hill Mayors position, 91 to 58. All initial Councilmembers were elected on write-in votes. The first elected Councilmembers were: F. Lee Campbell, - Robert W. Glueck, - P.A. Jacobsen, Leslie M. Rudy and A.C. Thompson Sr. John Woodin became the Town's first Treasurer. Ken Day appointed Priscilla Alden Townsend as Police Judge and Roger Bryan as Marshall. The 1975 Mayoral election in Clyde Hill brought with it suspense and the national media. The two candidates, the incumbent Liberino \\"Lib\\" Tufarolo and Miles Nelson finished the election in an even tie. The contest was ultimately decided by a coin toss, with Nelson unseating the incumbent as national and local media looked on. Politics Clyde Hill leans liberal in its politics, though less so than neighboring Bellevue. In the 2016 presidential election, of the 1,789 residents who voted, 56.18% voted for Hillary Clinton compared to 32.53% for Donald Trump.

The population was 17,575 at the time of the 2010 census. Prior to the 2010 census, Covington was counted as part of Covington-Sawyer-Wilderness CDP. History The area presently known as Covington was originally known as Jenkins Prairie. Between 1899 and 1900 the Northern Pacific Railway built a cut-off between Auburn and Kanaskat, improving the company's primary east-west route across Stampede Pass. Richard Covington, a surveyor for the Northern Pacific Railroad worked out of Fort Vancouver establishing the line through western Washington to complete the line from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Auburn. According to the NP's construction records at the University of Montana's K. Ross Toole Archives, the primary contractors were banker Horace C. Henry of Seattle, Washington, and long-time railroad contractor Nelson Bennett of Tacoma, Washington, the NP's prime contractor for Stampede Tunnel, which he completed in 1888. The project engineer in Auburn was George Allen Kyle. The NP's principal assistant engineer in Tacoma, overseeing both Kyle and Bennett's work, was Charles S. Bihler. In 1900, during the building of the Palmer Cut-Off from Kanaskat to Auburn, the Northern Pacific installed at 2,850-foot passing track, a 700-foot loading track, a second class section house (which broke down to $1,000 for construction, $100 for an outhouse, and $50 for furnishings), a 24-man bunkhouse, a box tank and standpipe for watering steam locomotives at Covington. By 1908 the tiny village was home to the Covington Lumber Company, which had set up a mill capable of cutting 85,000 board feet of timber a day. No photograph is known to exist of the station at this site, apparently built after the cut-off construction. It operated on and off until the Great Depression and was removed in 1941. A school district was established in 1937.A History of Covington, Washington Over the years the area grew as an unincorporated area of Kent. Covington was officially incorporated as a city on August 31, 1997. Government The city is governed by a council-manager government consisting of a seven-person city council. Members are elected at- large, (that is, each is elected by all citizens of the city, not by districts). Fire protection to most of the city is provided by the Kent Fire Department, while Maple Valley Fire and Life Safety provides fire protection to the remainder of the city. Public schools in the city are part of the Kent School District. Police Covington contracts with the King County Sheriff's Office for police services. Deputies assigned to Covington wear Covington uniforms and drive patrol cars marked with the city logo. There are currently 11 patrol officers, one traffic officer, one detective, and one chief assigned full-time to the city. Economy With its rapid population growth since the city's incorporation, much of the city's income depends on the retail industry. The city's retail core is located along the SR-516 corridor. In 2006, new Covington downtown businesses included a new Walmart, Kohl's, Carl's Jr (taking over the former Dairy Queen building), and an Applebee's. In 2008 brought the newly opened Red Robin, Costco, and The Home Depot in the new shopping center next to Jenkins Creek Elementary School. Fast growth is expected to continue in the area due to the continued widening and modifications done on State Route 18, a major thoroughfare connecting south King County with Interstate 90. In 2009 there are many more big businesses expected to open, including a The UPS Store and Bank of America branch within the Covington Esplande (Home Depot) lot. Covington is also a regional medical hub for southeast King County with MultiCare Health Systems and Valley Medical Center having a large presence in Covington, along with numerous professional service providers like dentists, chiropractors, specialty medicine, and more. In 2011, the city's medical services were expanded when MultiCare Health System built a standalone Emergency Department in the same campus as their Medical Center and Urgent Care off of State Route 516 and SE Wax Rd. In January 2018, Covington's first hospital (belonging to MultiCare) opened. Over the next five to ten years, Covington will see development taking place at the Lakepointe Urban Village property (off SE 256th at the former Lakeside gravel pit) and in the Town Center area (Wax Rd. just south of Kent Kangley/272nd). The Lakepointe project includes retail shops, restaurants, movie theater, apartments/condos, a hotel, a lake recreational area, and more. The Town Center project includes plans for a public plaza and the development of SoCo (South Covington) Park. Geography and climate Covington is located at (47.365780, -122.100213).

History Bridge crossing the Snoqualmie River on the Woodinville-Duvall Road as it enters the center of Duvall (2007). The area that became known as Duvall was historically the home of the Snoqualmie and other ancestral Tulalip Native American tribes. Following their relocation under the Treaty of Point Elliott, the area was homesteaded by veterans of the Civil War.Duvall -- Thumbnail History from the Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History The center of present-day town was located on a hillside homesteaded by Francis and James Duvall, loggers who arrived in 1871. An early milestone in the settlement of Duvall proper was the relocation of the town of Cherry Valley. Around 1909, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad agreed to move Cherry Valley homes and businesses to Duvall in order to continue the construction of a railroad line along the Snoqualmie River. The newly relocated town, briefly named Cosgrove after Samuel G. Cosgrove, underwent a real estate boom; streets and sidewalks were laid and a train depot was constructed. This was followed by construction of a movie house, a drug store, a new schoolhouse, and several hotels. By 1911, the Duvall Citizen began publishing regular editions of news events.Duvall Newspaper Index from the Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History On April 28, 1968, nearly 3,000 fans attended a rock concert at a farm in Duvall where an upright piano was dropped from a helicopter. Performances included Country Joe and the Fish. This concert is well known to locals as the Piano Drop.

In 2004, Democrat John Kerry received just under 60 percent of the area's vote, while Republican George W. Bush came in just short of 39 percent. Annexation initiative Eastgate has tried to get annexed by Bellevue several times in the past. In 1990, the area citizens voted to annex to the city of Bellevue and won by a majority. On the same ballot there was an additional vote for Eastgate accepting a portion of Bellevue's bonded indebtedness. The area's voters rejected that measure. As a result, Bellevue chose not to incorporate Eastgate at that time. Then in 2002, the state Supreme Court decision threw out the main method cities have used for decades to expand. In addition, budget implications further postponed annexation of Eastgate with hopes of trying again in a year or two. According to the 2004's Bellevue's Comprehensive plan, it is a policy to annex all land in the Potential Annexation Area expeditiously. Discussions with Bellevue have been aided by the county's agreement to give the city Coal Creek Park and the Surrey Downs district court property. The city projected an operating deficit of $300,000. Later in November of the same year, a budget was proposed to develop urban design and development alternatives for the Eastgate area and to conduct the first major update of the Eastgate Subarea Plan in 14 years. The Mayor of Bellevue suggested working toward annexation of the remaining unincorporated portion of the Eastgate area and making an effort to update the subarea plan. He also asked staff to develop a cost estimate for annexing Eastgate. The neighborhoods of Eastgate, Tamara Hills, and Horizon View were annexed by the City of Bellevue on June 1, 2012, adding \\"about 5,400 new residents, 1,850 residences and 700 acres\\" to Bellevue.

Since 2006 G√ºstrow has had the official suffix Barlachstadt. The town is known for its renaissance G√ºstrow Palace, the old town and its brick gothic cathedral with Barlach's Floating Angel sculpture.European Route of Brick Gothic G√ºstrow Cathedral Geography G√ºstrow is 45 kilometers south of Rostock at the Nebel, an arm of the Warnow. The B√ºtzow-G√ºstrow-Kanal (channel) is a navigable connection to the Warnow and used by water tourists. There are five lakes (Inselsee, Sumpfsee, Parumer See, Grundloser See and Gliner See [lake]) and several forests around G√ºstrow. History The name G√ºstrow comes from the Polabian Gu≈°ƒçerov and means lizard place.Ernst Eichler: St√§dtenamenbuch der DDR. Leipzig 1988, p. 125. In 1219 the Wendish castle G√ºstrowe was built where the renaissance palace stands now. G√ºstrow is said to be founded by Heinrich Borwin II, a grandson of Henry the Lion, between 1219 and 1226 and was first mentioned in 1228 in the deed of city rights of Schwerin, confirmed by the sons of Heinrich Borwin II, who donated the cathedral as collegiate church in 1226. G√ºstrow was a residence of the lords of Werle from 1229 until 1436. In 1441 the first privileged shooting society of G√ºstrow was founded. The host desecration-trial of 1330 ended with the burning of 23 Jews and the destruction of the synagogue. The Kapelle des heiligen Bluts (Chapel of the Holy Blood) was built on the site of the synagogue. In 1503, 1508 and in 1512 fires destroyed the town and in 1556 the palace burned down. After the division of Mecklenburg (1621) it became the capital of the small Duchy of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. (Albrecht von Wallenstein, the imperial general in the Thirty Years' War, was a duke of Mecklenburg- G√ºstrow.) In 1695 the last duke of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow died, and the duchy ceased to exist. G√ºstrow became a part of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The famous sculptor Ernst Barlach lived in G√ºstrow from 1910 to his death in 1938. Sights There are several notable sights in G√ºstrow: * The G√ºstrow Palace (or Schloss G√ºstrow in German), built in 1589 in Renaissance style, as a residence for the dukes of Mecklenburg. One of the most important works of this era in the Baltic Sea region. Between 1963 and 1981 major restoration work was carried out, and a Renaissance garden was added, modelled after descriptions appearing in old engravings. * G√ºstrow Cathedral, a Brick Gothic cathedral built between 1226 and 1335. Noteworthy are a late Gothic high altar (c. 1500), the tombs of Duke Ulrich III and his two wives (16th century), and the celebrated Schwebende Engel (\\"Hovering Angel\\"), the most famous work of the expressionist sculptor Ernst Barlach, created in 1926 as a tribute to the victims of World War I. * St. Mary's church - a Brick Gothic parish church, partly remodelled in the 19th century * Ernst Barlach's Atelierhaus (studio), that exhibits a large collection of his works. * The Townhall, originally built in the 13th century and rebuilt c. 1800 at the central market square.

Located east of Seattle, the community lies along the Snoqualmie River. The population was 1,993 at the 2010 census.  History  The first settlements in the area were two forts built in 1856 during the Puget Sound War to protect future settlers against possible uprisings by the native population. Fort Patterson, a few miles downstream, and Fort Tilton, a few miles upstream, were built with the help of Indians led by Chief Patkanim, and both were abandoned within two years after interactions with the local tribes remained peaceful. A historical marker can be found north of Fall City on the Fish Hatchery Road where Fort Tilton once stood. A trading post was established near the present-day location of the Last Frontier Saloon in 1869 and became a hub of the local economy. Fall City was known at the time as \\"The Landing\\", as shallow water and rapids upstream on the Snoqualmie were impassable to the large dugout canoes used for transporting goods. In the early 1870s the first local mill in the Snoqualmie Valley was opened at the mouth of Tokul Creek, just downstream from Snoqualmie Falls and just upstream from where Fall City would be. The Fall City post office opened June 10, 1872. The first small steamboats started ferrying supplies up the river in 1875. In the late 1880s, a group of Puget Sound businessmen founded and started building the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, including a line up into the upper Snoqualmie Valley, in an attempt to build a line over the Cascade Range. The land claim holder at the time, Jeremiah \\"Jerry\\" Borst, had Fall City surveyed and platted in anticipation of the people the railroad would bring, but was disappointed in 1889 when the railroad line was built a mile (1.6 km) away from the community. However, even a mile away the railroad, combined with the first bridge over the Snoqualmie River, greatly improved the business of the local lumber mills and farmers, and made the area and its scenic features (such as Snoqualmie Falls) accessible to tourists. Hundreds moved to the area over the next two decades. When the Sunset Highway connecting Seattle with eastern Washington through Fall City was improved in the early 1910s, it further accelerated the economic and residential development of the area. By the late 1920s, most of the population either worked in the burgeoning tourist trade or commuted to work west toward Issaquah and Seattle. The Great Depression, followed by gasoline rationing during World War II, hurt the tourist trade in Fall City. Tourism was further hampered after the war as U.S. Highway 10 (now Interstate 90) was rerouted south directly from Preston to North Bend, bypassing Fall City and Snoqualmie. The local economy suffered further impacts as the local logging mills started closing. Today, Fall City is a bedroom community to the high- tech industry of the Seattle metropolitan area, with large suburban estates just outside the community juxtaposed with the historical homes and farmsteads built in its heyday. Geography Fall City is located in central King County at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the Fall City CDP has a total area of , of which , or 1.52%, are water. Fall City sits at the confluence of the Snoqualmie River and the Raging River and is sometimes subject to flooding during the autumn and winter months.

The town is on a small peninsula surrounded by Lake Washington, and is near the suburbs of Medina (to the southwest), Clyde Hill (to the south), Yarrow Point (on another peninsula to the east), and Kirkland (to the northeast), as well as the city of Bellevue (to the east). As of the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 394. History Leigh S. J. Hunt, a resident of nearby Yarrow Point, purchased the yet-to-be-named property of Hunts Point on March 13, 1890. He wanted the property so that he could cut down the tall evergreen trees that grew out at the end, obstructing his view of Lake Washington. Around 1900, the property was taken over by Puget Sound National Bank and sold to a group of Seattle men who used it as a family retreat for Sunday picnics and summer camping. Before the creation of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and Interstate 90 floating bridges across Lake Washington, residents commuted to Seattle via the Gazelle, one of several ferries on Lake Washington. The Gazelle arrived at Cozy Cove (between Hunts Point and Yarrow Points) each morning at 7:15 a.m. A clubhouse was built in 1913 at what is now 3655 Hunts Point Road. It became the center of Hunts Point's social activity through the 1920s. That same year, the women of Hunts Point formed the charitable organization The Eastside Circle of the Seattle Fruit and Flower Mission (later called The Overlake Service League), which continues to this day. Hunts Point was incorporated as a city on August 22, 1955. The Fairweather Basin was developed from marshland into residential property in 1957. The city's first sewers were installed in 1960.

The population was 30,434 at the 2010 census and an estimated 39,509 in 2019. Located in a valley and bisected by Interstate 90, the city is bordered by the Sammamish Plateau to the north and the \\"Issaquah Alps\\" to the south. It is home to the headquarters of the multinational retail company Costco. History Coal miners' homes in Issaquah, 1913 \\"Issaquah\\" is an anglicized word for a local Native American name, meaning either \\"the sound of birds\\", \\"snake\\", or \\"little stream\\". \\"Squak Valley\\", an older name for the area, also derives from this same Native American name. In September 1885, the then- unincorporated area was the scene of an attack on Chinese laborers who had come to pick hops from local fields. Three of the laborers died from gunshot wounds, and none of the attackers were convicted of any wrongdoing. The city was officially incorporated on April 29, 1892. Initially a small mining town, the city has changed noticeably both in its appearance and economic focus. Issaquah was originally developed to service the mining industry (on the two nearby mountains that now lend their names to the Cougar/Squak Corridor Park), and began as the town of \\"Gilman\\". As the mining deposits neared depletion in the late 1890s, other companies started to realize Issaquah's potential to support a lucrative lumber business. These companies exported timber from Issaquah and other small, local towns to Seattle and larger, rapidly growing communities throughout western Washington. These early boom industries, however, faded into a period of relative quiet by the time of the Great Depression. The town remained fairly placid through the succeeding decades, with Boeing providing the majority of employment in the area. Microsoft and other technological industries moved into Redmond and other cities in the area, and later established operations in Issaquah itself. Both Boeing and Microsoft have significantly affected Issaquah's history, cultural development, and diverse population through their active community participation and attraction of outside residents. In June 1996, Costco moved its global headquarters to Issaquah from nearby Kirkland. Other Issaquah employers include Siemens Medical Solutions' Ultrasound Group, Overtime Technologies, Boehm's Candies, and Darigold. Geography Issaquah is located east-southeast of Seattle at the south end of Lake Sammamish. Its neighboring cities are Bellevue to the west and Sammamish to the north. Issaquah resides within the Mountains to Sound Greenway. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are water. Issaquah is surrounded on three sides by what are known locally as the Issaquah Alps: Cougar Mountain on the west, Squak Mountain to the south, and Tiger Mountain to the southeast. To the north of Issaquah is Lake Sammamish. Cougar and Squak Mountains are home to sizable neighborhoods on their lower slopes, though the bulk of all three mountains are preserved in public ownership as Squak Mountain State Park, Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park, West Tiger Mountain NRCA, and Tiger Mountain State Forest. Geologists have noted the chemical and geological content of these three mountains to be much different from that of the Cascade Range, because they are not volcanic in origin, while the entire Cascade Range is postulated to have formed from volcanic action. They believe that these three mountains are the remains of a much older mountain range long since eroded by earthquakes, volcanic action, and shifting plates. Climate Issaquah has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csb) with chilly, extremely wet winters and warm, moderately humid summers. Although there is no dry season in Issaquah, winters are many times wetter than the summers.

Transportation=Highways and roads Issaquah is bisected by Interstate 90, which runs from Seattle to Boston, and Washington State Route 900, which connects the city to neighboring Renton. There is a chronic traffic congestion problem on Front Street, which traverses the historic downtown. Proposals have been made to create a bypass, but opponents have argued that this will only result in more sprawl in the area beyond downtown and thus bring in more traffic and pollution. In 2008, the Issaquah City Council voted to cancel the 15-year-running SE Bypass project. In addition, King County has no funding in its seven-year capital plan to improve Issaquah-Hobart Road, the southern terminus of the proposed bypass. Public transportation Bus service in Issaquah is provided by King County Metro as well as regional Sound Transit routes to Seattle and Bellevue. There are two primary park-and-rides in the city, at Issaquah Transit Center and Issaquah Highlands Park & Ride, which have a total of 1,999 parking spaces. Since August 1995, the city and King County Metro provided a free circulator bus (route 200) between business districts and community centers in Issaquah as a form of traffic congestion relief. As part of the expansion of Sound Transit services, a Link light rail line to Issaquah from Bellevue is proposed to begin service by 2041. Local attractions Village Theatre's First Stage, Issaquah Issaquah Alps The Issaquah Alps are the highlands neighboring the city. They offer hiking trails and opportunities for outdoor activity across the three mountains surrounding Issaquah: Tiger Mountain, Cougar Mountain, and Squak Mountain. Issaquah Valley Trolley Issaquah Valley Trolley car crossing Front Street The Issaquah Valley Trolley is a project of the Issaquah Historical Society with the aim of starting a regular heritage trolley service on the remaining section of railroad track in downtown Issaquah. A trial operation took place in 2001‚Äì02, giving public rides in a trolley car borrowed from Yakima Valley Trolleys. By 2010, the Issaquah Historical Society had acquired three trolleys of its own, but the planned service had not yet begun operation, as two of the cars were narrow gauge, making them incompatible with the standard gauge rails left in Issaquah, and all three were not in operating condition. A federal transportation grant was obtained, providing funds for track evaluation and repairs, and in 2012 one of the two narrow gauge cars was sent to the Gomaco Trolley Company to be refurbished and regauged to standard gauge. The overhauled trolley car, ex-Lisbon 519, returned to Issaquah in August 2012, and regular public rides began in October 2012. Operation is expected to be seasonal and on weekends only. Some proponents of the Trolley Project hope to see trolley service extended to a northern re-extension of removed track to the southern tip of Lake Sammamish or beyond to downtown Redmond by reinstalling the track along the eastern shore of Lake Sammamish that the county removed several years ago. The opening of the East Lake Sammamish Trail in March 2006 along that proposed line ended the possibility of Issaquah- Redmond service.

Salmon Days Festival Issaquah Salmon Days is a two-day award-winning festival held in Issaquah on the first full weekend of October every year. It is initiated by a parade, celebrates the return of the salmon to their birth waters, and praises Issaquah's history, culture, and ethnic diversity. This free festival encompasses several arts and crafts conventions, attracting many Northwest artists; these artisans feature wood, glass, jewelry, paintings, pottery and metal artworks for sale in booths spread all across the downtown and historic area. There are four stages for entertainment such as live music. Sporting events include 5 km/10 km runs (and a 3 km run for children), a fencing invitational, bike rides, and a golf tournament. Memorial Field, adjacent to the city hall, hosts a \\"Field of Fun\\" providing free entertainment for children of all ages, thanks to the many festival sponsors. Visitors are encouraged to visit the newly restored Salmon Hatchery to view the returning salmon in close detail. In 2005, the register revealed over 400,000 people attended the Salmon Days Festival. Cougar Mountain Zoo View of Lake Sammamish from the zoo The Cougar Mountain Zoo is located on the north slope of Cougar Mountain, just to the west of Issaquah. This zoo offers a glimpse at many endangered species from across the globe, including many endangered birds from around the world and small lemurs from Madagascar. The highlight of the zoo for many observers is the cougar, named Nashi. Nashi is provided enrichment on a near-daily basis, which consists of a stimulant to keep him active mentally and physically. The zoo currently specializes in eight \\"worlds\\" of animals: cougars, lemurs, cranes, reindeer, macaws, wallabies, ratites, camelids. On June 16, 2007, another world was added to the list, when the zoo welcomed its newest members, two male tiger cubs. Named Taj and Almos, they are the only Bengal tigers in Washington state. The Zoo is open for general admission Wednesday through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (excluding the month of December). Each December the Zoo also offers a special Reindeer Festival, during which people may come view, and feed Santa's Reindeer, and visit the \\"big guy\\" in person. Issaquah Salmon Hatchery The Issaquah Salmon Hatchery was built in 1936 under the federal Works Project Administration. It is located on the Issaquah Creek within the city limits of Issaquah. The hatchery is owned and operated by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. It annually raises about 4 million Chinook (King) and Coho (Silver) salmon which then migrate from the Issaquah Creek to Puget sound and on to the North Pacific. Friends of the Issaquah Salmon Hatchery (FISH) is a non-profit organization that trains volunteer guides who lead free educational tours of the hatchery and advocates retaining and improving the historic hatchery. Local elementary schools often raise small numbers of salmon eggs that are spawned in the hatchery and release them into the creeks as part of their science curriculum on the salmon life cycle. The Issaquah Salmon Hatchery is located in the cultural and geographical heart of Issaquah and is the Department of Fish and Wildlife's most visited hatchery, with an estimated 350,000 visitors a year. Gilman Village XXX Root Beer restaurant, one of two remaining locations Gilman Village is a specialty shopping center created from rescued buildings dating back to the origins of the Issaquah community. Gilman Village was founded in 1972, when developers Marvin and Ruth Mohl started saving old, unwanted farming and mining buildings, as well as pioneer homes, from around Issaquah. They moved, renovated and combined them into an attractive retail area in a park-like setting. Their goal was to create a haven for independent shops and restaurants. In saving the buildings, the intent was to honor the character and ambiance of the old community rather than to create a museum. Still, the buildings that house the shops and restaurants of Gilman Village represent a significant portion of Issaquah's history. The 40-plus shops and restaurants that make up Gilman Village became one of Puget Sound's best known and most distinctive shopping destinations. In its initial decades, Gilman Village was a destination while Issaquah was still a somewhat rural area. Over time, Gilman Village began to compete with other local shopping centers for tenants serving the Issaquah population. Designers of Gilman Village have included the Baylis Architects, Richard Haag Associates and landscape architect Stephen G. Ray. Their combined efforts have won official recognition by the King County Board of Realtors in 1976 and the Issaquah Design Commission in 1977 for quality of design and landscaping. In 1985, The Bellevue Chamber of Commerce presented the Eastside Quality of Life Award to Gilman Village for \\"the pleasures it gives through its rich discoveries of space and forms\\".

It is a suburban bedroom community that is located at the mouth of the Sammamish River, approximately northeast of Seattle and west of Bothell. The city's population was 20,460 at the 2010 census. Kenmore is also home to the Kenmore Air Harbor, the largest seaplane- only passenger facility of its kind in the United States. The city is connected to nearby areas by State Route 522 and the Burke-Gilman Trail, which both run east‚Äìwest along the lakeshore. The city limits stretch north to the Snohomish County line and south to a border with Kirkland south of Saint Edward State Park and Bastyr University. Kenmore's official city flower is the dahlia, the official city bird is the great blue heron, and the official city evergreen is the rhododendron. History Founded in 1901, Kenmore's name comes third-hand from the Scottish village of Kenmore, via town founder home town of Kenmore, Ontario. John McMasters and his wife Annie arrived in Puget Sound circa 1889 from Canada, intending to establish themselves in the shingle-making trade. They opened a shingle mill on the northern shore of Lake Washington on land leased from Watson C. Squire. By 1903, Kenmore had established a school system and post office,\\"Kenmore Post Office opens on November 12, 1903.\\" HistoryLink. Essay 583.

Retrieved on March 24, 2007. Early 20th century Despite cargo railway service passing through the area as early as 1887 via the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, most access to the city in its early days was by boat, with regular ferry service to Seattle, Bothell, and Woodinville starting in 1906. The city later gained a passenger railroad stop. The first improved road connection to Seattle and Bothell--the Red Brick Road--opened between 1913 and 1914, with bus service following the laying of the bricks. As a result, Kenmore became a country retreat for weekend gardeners with local landowners selling off clear- cut \\"garden plots\\" to Seattlites with automobiles and green thumbs. It attracted at least two short-lived nudist camps during the 1920s. Far more striking, however, was the impact of Prohibition. Kenmore quickly became famous in Seattle for its fine country dining and, more importantly, its fine country drinking, as a substantial illegal alcohol industry developed to meet the demands of Jazz Age Seattle nightlife. Although relatively close to Seattle proper thanks to Bothell Way's status as one of the few improved roads then heading north from downtown it was nonetheless far enough out that Department of Revenue officers could, for the most part, ignore it. The Blind Pig, a roadhouse on Shuter's Landing at Lake Washington, was probably the most famous of the Kenmore speakeasys. At the lakeside, its illegal hooch could be dumped into the lake quickly and easily should it become necessary. Few people were fooled; the name itself was, in fact, a well-known slang term meaning \\"speakeasy\\". But despite its notoriety, the Pig was not even the city's most infamous saloon. Routine violence and fist-fights at the Inglewood Tavern earned that establishment an alternative name: the Bucket of Blood. This archipelago of dining and entertainment - over 30 different restaurants, dance halls, bars, and clubs in a three-block area - remained a major part of Kenmore's identity through the 1940s. Post-war redevelopment Once the Great Depression hit, Kenmore became home for a small settlement of workers under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Back to the Land program. Paid by the Works Progress Administration, a small number of workers settled in an area of northwestern Kenmore which became known as \\"Voucherville\\", after the vouchers the WPA paid in lieu of a cash salary. After the end of World War II, Kenmore became home to US Army Nike Hercules missile batteries as part of cold-war era defense plans. These nuclear-tipped anti-aircraft missiles were intended to protect Seattle and environs from Soviet bombers, should war break out. They were removed in 1974.\\"Seattle tests a super siren during the Cold War on February 27, 1952.\\" HistoryLink.org. Essay 3688. Retrieved on April 2, 2007. The post-war era largely transformed downtown. Kenmore Air Harbor, which today is one of the world's largest seaplane-only airports, opened not far from the old location of the Blind Pig; Kenmore Air itself today runs a fleet of seaplanes serving waterside destinations throughout Cascadia. At the same time, Kenmore's immediate proximity to Seattle--just two miles (3 km) north of modern Seattle city limits-- made it an early target of post-war housing development. The first plats in the new Uplake neighborhood were sold in 1954. Housing development continued throughout the Kenmore area for the next several decades, mostly following the postwar suburban model; industrial and commercial growth followed quickly behind, and within a few decades, most of the old Kenmore dining and drinking had vanished, replaced by shopping centers, industrial development, and housing. However, one part of this new development brought its own history along with it: the Jewel Box Building in downtown Kenmore is a Seattle World's Fair artifact, moved from Seattle Center to Kenmore after the end of the fair in October, 1962. The city gained its first college in 1996, with the relocation of Bastyr University from Seattle onto the grounds of the former St. Edward Seminary. Incorporation and downtown revitalization Kenmore residents considered incorporation many times since the town's founding; one such incorporation vote failed in 1954.Kenmore Heritage Society Timeline, Kenmore Heritage Society. Retrieved on April 15, 2007. The idea gained popular support through the 1990s, however, partly in response to the passage of the Washington State Growth Management Act of 1990. Formation of an exploration committee in 1995 led to a successful public vote shortly thereafter, and the city formally incorporated on August 31, 1998, 97 years after its original founding. Following incorporation, the new government set about devising a local set of zoning codes and a downtown development plan with the intent of reviving and rebuilding the traditional core areas of the city. A significant component of this plan involves extensive use of land now owned by the city, in the area known within the plan as the Northwest Quadrant. An open invitation was extended to all architects and developers to submit development plans for this newly available area in December, 2005. The City Council chose to negotiate primarily with Kenmore Partners LLC in April 2006.

Warehouse chain Costco previously had its headquarters in Kirkland. While Costco is now headquartered in Issaquah, the city is the namesake of its \\"Kirkland Signature\\" store brand. History The land around Lake Washington to the east of Seattle was first settled by Native Americans. English settlers arrived in the late 1860s, when the McGregor and Popham families built homesteads in what is now the Houghton neighborhood. to the north people also settled near what is now called Juanita Bay, a favored campsite of the Natives because a wild potato, \\"wapatos\\", thrived there. The Curtis family arrived in the area in the 1870s, followed by the French family in 1872. The Forbes family homesteaded what is now Juanita Beach Park in 1876, and settled on Rose Hill in 1877. Gradually, additional people settled in the area, and by the end of the 1880s a small number of logging, farming and boat-building communities were established. Kirkland in 1912, at the modern-day intersection of Fourth Avenue and First Street overlooking Lake Washington Map of Kirkland in 2006, prior to annexations In 1886, Peter Kirk, a British-born enterprising businessman seeking to expand the family's Moss Bay steel production company, moved to Washington after hearing that iron deposits had been discovered in the Cascade Range. Other necessary components such as limestone, needed in steel smelting, were readily available in the area. Further yet, a small number of coal mines (a required fuel source for steel mills) had recently been established nearby in Newcastle and train lines were already under construction. Plans were also underway to build the Lake Washington Ship Canal. Kirk realized that if a town were built near the water it would be a virtual freshwater port to the sea, as well as help support any prospective mill. At the time, however, Kirk was not a U.S. citizen and could not purchase any land. Leigh S. J. Hunt, then owner of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, offered to partner with Kirk and buy the necessary real estate. Under their new venture, the Kirkland Land and Development Company, Kirk and Hunt purchased thousands of acres of land in what is now Kirkland's downtown in July 1888. Kirk and his associates started the construction of a new steel mill soon after, named the Moss Bay Iron and Steel Company of America. After founding the city of Kirkland in 1888, officially one of the earliest on the Eastside at the time, Kirk's vision of a \\"Pittsburgh of the West\\" was beginning to take form. Construction soon commenced on several substantial brick homes and business blocks that would house and serve the steel mill employees. However, the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, which had recently been purchased by Tacoma-based Northern Pacific, had now refused to construct a rail line to the lake. This would, after all, have a negative impact on Tacoma, which was furiously competing with Seattle as the dominant Puget Sound seaport. The ensuing financial issues and numerous obstacles took a toll on Kirk, who was running out of investors. Hunt was also in debt from the purchase of land. Nevertheless, the plans continued and the steel mill was eventually completed in late 1892 on Rose Hill (a full from the lake's shore). Financial issues arose and due to the Panic of 1893 the mill subsequently closed without ever producing any steel. In spite of everything, Kirk was determined not to give up on his namesake town, and Kirkland was finally incorporated in 1905 with a population of approximately 532. A final attempt at a steel mill in Kirkland was planned by James A. Moore in 1906. His Northwestern Iron & Steel Company paid $250,000 in cash for a site, but the mill never materialized. This came at the heels of the Pacific Steel Company, incorporated earlier in 1906 by J.F. Duthie, William Calvert and L.S. Cragin. This company soon amounted to nothing. In 1900 the Curtis family made a living operating a ferry-construction business on Lake Washington. Along with Captain John Anderson, the Curtises were among the first to run ferries in the area. Leschi, first operated on December 27, 1913, was the original wooden ferry to transport automobiles and people between the Eastside and Madison Park until her retirement in 1950. The ferry operations ran nearly continuously for 18 hours each day. The construction of the first Lake Washington floating bridge in 1940, however, made ferry service unprofitable and eventually led to its cancellation. Subsequent years saw wool milling and warship building become the major industries. The first woolen mill in the state of Washington was built in Kirkland in 1892. The mill was the primary supplier of wool products for the Alaska Gold Rush prospectors and for the U.S. military during World War I. By 1917, after the completion of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, the construction of ocean-going vessels had become a major business. By 1940, the thriving Lake Washington Shipyard had constructed more than 25 warships during World War II for the U.S. Navy, on what is now Carillon Point. Annexations Since the incorporation of Kirkland in 1905, the city has grown to approximately 12 times its original geographic boundaries, nearly doubling in size during the 1940s and 1960s.Kirkland Historical Annexation Areas Map Kirkland consolidated with the neighboring town of Houghton on July 31, 1968, to form one city of 13,500. It annexed the neighborhood of Totem Lake in 1974, and the neighborhoods of South Juanita, North Rose Hill, and South Rose Hill in 1988, which were the largest annexations undertaken in Washington in nearly two decades. This added a further 16,119 people to Kirkland's population and was responsible for 76 percent of Kirkland's population increase between 1980 and 1990. On November 3, 2009, responding to a county initiative to encourage cities to annex or incorporate many of the unincorporated areas within the county, as well as a state sales tax incentive intended to ease the process, three previously unincorporated districts north of the city‚ÄîFinn Hill, Juanita, and Kingsgate‚Äîvoted on whether to annex to Kirkland. The measure failed by seven votes to reach the 60% margin, which was required because the measure included accepting a share of the city's voter- approved debt. However, since the affirmative vote was over 50%, the city council could and did vote to accept the annexation, without the assumption of debt. The annexation added 33,000 residents (combined total population of around 80,000)Nicole Tsong and Katherine Long, , Seattle Times, originally published November 3, 2009 at 9:48 PM, modified November 4, 2009 at 12:39 AM.

It was developed in the 20th century as a bedroom community with single-family housing on medium to large-sized lots. Less than 4% of the city's land is zoned commercial, largely concentrated in one location, and there are no industrial areas. The city is situated at the northwest end of Lake Washington along State Route 522, which provides connections to Seattle and Bothell. Lake Forest Park includes several parks and nature reserves, access to the Burke‚ÄìGilman Trail, and organized summer events. The population was 12,598 at the 2010 census. History Lake Forest Park was founded in 1912 by Ole Hanson as one of the Seattle area's first planned communities. Envisioned as a picturesque retreat for professionals, the developers planned roads and lots in strict consideration for natural landmarks.Stein, A., \\"Lake Forest Park -- Thumbnail History\\", HistoryLink.org, December 5, 1998. Online as of April 19, 2007. The original prospectus for lot sales declared: > ...the strict fiat has gone forth that all the natural beauty must be > preserved; that no tree must unwittingly be cut down; that the natural wild > flowers must remain; that the streams, the springs, the lake front, the > nodding willows, the stately cedar, the majestic fir, the quivering cypress > and the homelike maple and all the flora and fauna with which Nature has > blessed this lakeshore, must not be defiled by the hand of man.Alan J. Stein > transcribing Ole Hanson, \\"Lake Forest Park brochure\\", Seattle, Washington, > 1912, held by Shoreline Historical Museum, Shoreline, Washington, 1998. Until 1914 and completion of the Red Brick Road (now Bothell Way, part of State Route 522) to nearby Kenmore and Bothell, it also marked the literal end of improved roads heading north from Seattle, with the best access to points further north and east being by boat across Lake Washington or the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway. Lake Forest Park officially incorporated on June 20, 1961, in large part to help maintain its specific identity. The town remained small - under 5,000 in population - until the 1990s, when a series of annexations expanded city borders significantly and more than doubled the official population. The 3/4 acre Lyon Creek Park was created in the late 1990s on land purchased by the city in 1998. For the prior fifty years, the lot had belonged to Marcia and Robert Morris, who had built a modernist home and a horse stable on the property. Both buildings were torn down as part of the park conversion, which also included replanting the park with 5,000 native shrubs and plants. The replanting portion of the project involved the labor of hundreds of citizen volunteers.Informational signs in Lyon Creek Park, City of Lake Forest Park, March 2007. Lake Forest Park Town Center, the city's commercial core, was built in 1964 and hugs Bothell Way, not far from the lakeshore. In late 2005, city government began holding public meetings to discuss the future of the town center. The decision was made to renovate Lake Forest Park Town Center and it now spans 18 acres and offers many shopping and dining options along with entertainment. Lake Forest Park Town Center is also home to a branch of the King County Library System, Third Place Books, and Third Place Commons community center.Madison Marquette, http://www.madisonmarquette.com/portfolio/property/property:69 , Retrieved December 1, 2010.

The Town Center was also home to Shoreline Community College's Lake Forest Park satellite campus but it is now closed. Residential neighborhoods include: * Horizon View, in the northeast corner of the city, is characterized by its proximity to Horizon View Park, the highest point in Lake Forest Park. The park sits atop a small plateau, approached by several steep hills. Half of the \\"train park\\", as some local youth refer to it, is the park, which was improved between 2001 and 2003, also in early 2013 with a trail extension, field upgrades and a new playset. The other half is a reservoir. They hold recreational sports in the park. * Sheridan Beach/Heights, in the southeast corner of the city, is characterized by its proximity to the Sheridan Beach Club, to which its residents have access for a fee.

It was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was also once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. In March 2006, Telewest merged with fellow cable telecom company NTL, and created \\"NTL:Telewest\\", which then also merged with Virgin Mobile and Virgin.net in June 2006, creating the United Kingdom's first \\"quadruple play\\" telecom provider, offering television, internet, landline phone and mobile phone services. In February 2007, NTL:Telewest was rebranded as Virgin Media.  History  Telewest originated in Croydon in 1984 under the name \\"Croydon Cable\\". United Cable, of Denver, acquired Croydon Cable in 1988. Franchises extended the company scope into Edinburgh and the southwest and southeast of England. In 1989, United Cable merged with United Artists Cable International. In May 1991, United Artists announced a merged deal with its largest shareholder Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), to form the largest cable operator in the United States; the deal was valued at $142.5m, and by June the deal was improved. The deal was finalised a week later on 8 June 1991, with TCI acquiring the remaining 46% of United Artists, to allow full control. TCI and US West announced a joint venture, and in 1992, the joint venture company became Telewest Communications, a combination of the names of both founding companies. In June 1995, Telewest merged with SBC Communications, adding franchises in the Midlands and North West serving 1.3 million homes. During this time Telewest founded a consortium called Cable Internet. This consisted of the major cable companies in the United Kingdom working together a provide national Internet access service. In March 1998, Telewest announced a merger with General Cable, and acquired the outstanding interest in Birmingham Cable, adding a further 1.7 million franchise homes in Yorkshire, west London and Birmingham. Telewest purchased the remaining 50% stake in Cable London from NTL in August 1999, adding 0.4 million franchise homes in North London. Telewest merged with Flextech in April 2000, and in November, extended its cable network with the acquisition of Eurobell, taking the total number of homes passed to 4.9 million. The company later became known as \\"Telewest Broadband\\" in a rebrand during 2001. Telewest experienced many financial problems in subsequent years, owing to huge debts incurred as a result of constructing its cable network and of acquiring other cable companies and assets. Notably, the Eurobell acquisition had been funded by an equity based deal, with a cash option; the poor performance of the company's stock meant that the cash option was favourable, and the company was not able to cover the call. In September 2003, Telewest restructured itself, by swapping its unsecured debt for 98.5% of its shares. The London Stock Exchange then delisted the consolidated shares. Major Telewest shareholders included Huff and Liberty Media (run by cable tycoon John Malone). Afterwards the company emerged from financial restructuring, and completed the merger with NTL in October 2005. Nickelodeon dispute In late 2004, negotiations for renewed carriage of the Nickelodeon channels broke down; Telewest was unwilling to pay extra to keep the channels and preferred to drop them. Other Viacom-owned channels remained, such as MTV and, the now former, Paramount Comedy 1. The reaction to this by customers was fairly large and many left the provider to rival Sky. Other customers were retained by Telewest offering them a free upgrade to the Disney Channel for periods of between one and three months, while others were reportedly offered upgrades to Sky Movies packages in an attempt to keep them from leaving. The Nickelodeon channels returned to the Telewest platform on 12 February 2005 following successful renegotiation in Nickelodeon's favour. Marketing Strategies Telewest has tried a number of marketing strategies over the years, with a solid corporate identity not coming out until the end of 2005, to coincide with a \\"three for ¬£30\\" offer. Until 2007, the company used the mascot Ellie West to promote its services. In November 2004, when The Incredibles was released, Telewest promoted Blueyonder internet services with branding from the film, including television adverts starring characters from the film.  Operations  Vauxhall Vivaro van in Plymouth, Devon (2006) Telewest provided several residential services on its cable network, including:  Television  The majority of Telewest's television was digital. There were, however, areas that received an analogue service (Slough, Windsor and some areas in west London). Late in its independent existence, Telewest was in the process of converting the remaining analogue areas to digital, and it was expected that the analogue service would cease in 2007. The digital television service offered a number of different products including true video on demand, a PVR, and HDTV. * On Demand (formerly known as Teleport) was the brand name for Telewest's video on demand (VOD) service. The on Demand service launched in 2005. In contrast to Sky Digital which, due to technical limitations, is only able to provide near VOD services, Teleport is a true VOD system. Users could search through a large library of programmes and watch them when they want to as part of their subscription. This library included a free seven day watch again feature for television programmes produced by the BBC, Channel 4 and Virgin Media Television (formerly known as Flextech). On Demand also offered movies that could be purchased and watched as many times as desired within a twenty four hour period. On Demand also offered HD content that worked in conjunction with the Telewest PVR (now renamed the V+). * HDTV Telewest was the first United Kingdom broadcaster to offer HDTV. Telewest's HDTV service launched several months earlier than that of their chief competitor, Sky Digital. Telewest's HD service initially comprised around 10‚Äì30 hours per week of video on demand content, with no linear high definition television channels available, although the early trial services of BBC HD and ITV HD were carried for a brief time. In January 2006, Telewest started to broadcast HD documentaries such as The Blue Planet, Planet Earth and Pride through their Teleport service, and later broadcast some movies in HD. Telewest had an agreement with both ITV and the BBC, and claimed to be the only provider in the United Kingdom to offer all the 2006 FIFA World Cup matches in HD. In reality, however, half of the final group stage matches were not available in HD. Telewest's HD service was provided exclusively through their TV Drive box. Sky launched their HD service in May 2006, initially charging a ¬£300 setup fee and an additional ¬£10/month for several subscription HD channels, including HD versions of Sky One, Sky Movies and Sky Sports. Telewest charged a ¬£75 setup fee and ¬£10/month, although no subscription HD channels were offered. Telewest's fees however included the TV Drive recording service, equivalent to the recording features of the Sky+ service. * TV Drive was the name of Telewest's Digital video recorder (PVR) service. The product incorporated a 160 gigabyte hard drive as standard, meaning it was able to store around 80 hours of recorded programmes. This was in contrast to BSkyB's Sky+ service which offered only 80 gigabytes (40 hours). Similarly, Telewest's product incorporated three tuners while Sky's incorporated only two, meaning that Telewest's service could record two channels at the same time while watching a third. A few days ahead of the rebranding to Virgin Media, TV Drive was renamed V+.  Internet  Telewest's internet service called Blueyonder, formerly branded as Cable Internet, ran on the cable internet architecture and offered speeds of 2 Mbit/s, 4 Mbit/s and 10 Mbit/s downstream. The broadband service was 'uncapped', meaning that its use was unlimited and no extra charges were payable related to the amount of data downloaded. On 21 November 2006, after the merger with NTL, The Register reported that Subscriber Traffic Management was being trialled in areas of northern England, and would be rolled out nationwide.

The population was 22,684 at the 2010 census, and is estimated to be 27,202 as of 2019. The city functions as a commuter town for residents, though there is an increasing amount of commercial activity in the area. History The area was settled in 1879 by three men who were improving a trail and brought their families in. When a name for a future community was proposed, the names Vine Maple Valley and Maple Ridge were suggested. A vote was taken by writing the names on slips of paper and placing them in a hat. Vine Maple Valley won by 2/3, but the word \\"Vine\\" was later cut by the post office because it made the name too long. The town's early history mainly had to do with coal, lumber milling to build homes, and a railroad that ran through town. Coal was brought in from Black Diamond to the south, but the town itself also mined coal from Cedar Mountain. The mine was used as late as 1947. Rail workers for lines like the Northern Pacific Railroad and the Cedar River Watershed, closed off by the City of Seattle, meant more workers for those things. More residents meant more lumber milling. More lumber milling meant more workers. Suquamish tribe chairperson Martha George was born near Maple Valley in Sheridan in 1892, at a logging camp where her mother and grandmother worked as cooks.\\" The town grew inward. Blacksmith shops, hotels, saloons and stores took up the town in the 1910s and 1920s. Schools went up as well. Early schools were shacks at best. A two-room school went up in 1910, and a larger high school was built in 1929 as the first school in the Tahoma School District.http://www.tahomasd.us/pages/Tahoma_School_District_409/About_Us/District_Overview The school, after extensive renovations, still stands today as an elementary school. Much of this early development actually did not take place in the modern-day city, but rather in Hobart, northeast of incorporated Maple Valley. More residents meant farming and fishing became staples in the area, with milk, poultry and berry farming becoming the main grown food staples in the area. Fishing out of the Cedar River also became popular. Maple Valley also saw resorts beginning in the 1920s. Lake Wilderness, once the site of a county lumber mill, quickly became a resort lake with the opening of Gaffney's Grove, which opened with a ballroom, restaurant and roller rink. Later, the resort grew to include an airstrip, lodge, rental cabins, a nine-hole golf course and a bowling alley. It remained in operation until 1964. Increasing automobile use in the area gave rise to new roads being built. In the early 1960s, the construction of State Route 18 between Auburn and North Bend ran through the city, requiring many landmarks to be either demolished or moved. The Maple Valley Historical Society keeps records on the city's past, with two historical museums holding artifacts such as the city's first fire engine and photographs of old places in and around the city like Gaffney's Grove. Incorporation and recent development The city of Maple Valley was officially incorporated on August 31, 1997. The Green to Cedar River trail runs through the city, along SR 169 and Witte Road while passing through the former Gaffney's Grove site, now the Lake Wilderness City Park. The park includes a swimming beach and sprawling grass fields, and sees the annual Maple Valley Days Parade each year in June. The Lake Wilderness Arboretum is also located here. Due to the urban growth boundaries of King County, the city is uniquely split into different sectors along Maple Valley Highway (SR 169), the main thoroughfare through the city. At the northern and southern boundaries of the city lie two large commercial areas, while central Maple Valley is predominantly residential.https://www5.kingcounty.gov/sdc/Metadata.aspx?Layer=urban_growth The south side's Four Corners district is the main commercial area of the city. It is located along Maple Valley Highway and is bisected by Kent-Kangley Road (SR 516) to create four distinct areas of development. The northwestern corner underwent massive reconstruction in the early 2010s and now features several large retailers, apartments, and a strip mall. The northeastern corner was completely constructed in the 2010s; it formerly was a large lumberyard and is now home to several retailers. The southern corners feature strip malls, retailers, an apartment complex, and a housing development. The city is entirely served by the Tahoma School District, which at one point had its high school in neighboring Covington. In 2015, a bond measure was passed to build a new and more centralized high school for the district. It was to be built in a small unincorporated area southeast of Four Corners that was completely surrounded by Maple Valley, known informally as the ‚ÄòDonut Hole‚Äô. The area was annexed into Maple Valley and the new three-story Tahoma High School was completed in 2017. Geography Maple Valley is located at (47.366160, -122.044692). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The main bodies of water in the city limits are Lake Wilderness, Lake Lucerne, Rock Creek, and part of Pipe Lake.

The city is on a peninsula in Lake Washington, on the opposite shore from Seattle, bordered by Clyde Hill and Hunts Point to the east and water on all other sides. The city's population was 2,969 at the 2010 census. Billionaire Bill Gates, along with a number of Microsoft executives, or other associates of Gates, have homes in Medina. History The eastern shore of Lake Washington between Meydenbauer Bay and Evergreen Point was a sparsely- populated area that was cleared for its timber in the 1870s. Seattle businessman Thomas Dabney established a claim on the south side of modern-day Medina in 1886, becoming the area's first permanent white settler. Dabney built a ferry dock in 1890, naming it Dabney's Landing, while the surrounding area was turned into berry farms and fruit orchards. Other settlers arrived at Dabney's Landing, which was briefly named Flordeline by its founder until objections were raised by a group of women who proposed the Arabic name \\"Medina\\" in 1891. After a series of debates and sign-switching incidents, Medina won and was adopted as the name of the town. Medina was platted in 1914 and officially incorporated on August 19, 1955.History of Medina from the city's official Website. Retrieved September 17, 2009. The town's first mansions were built in the 1920s by wealthy Seattle businessmen, encouraged by the arrival of direct ferry service, and led to the nickname of Washington's \\"Gold Coast\\". The area's farmers, mostly of Japanese descent, were evicted during the 1940s internment and their farms were turned over for redevelopment. Surveillance In 2009, Medina, with the \\"wide support of residents\\", installed cameras at intersections along roads entering the city. The cameras are used to capture the license plate number of every car, and a security system automatically notifies local police if the captured number is recorded in a database.Cameras keep track of all cars entering Medina , a September 16, 2009 article from The Seattle Times Travelers are notified of the presence of the system with signs that read \\"You Are Entering a 24 Hour Video Surveillance Area\\"; according to Medina's police chief, all captured information is stored for 60 days even if nothing negative is found in the database, allowing police to mine data if a crime occurs later. One of the city's council members said the system was motivated by the belief that the need for crime prevention \\"outweighs concern over privacy\\". The system was inspired by that used in adjacent Hunts Point, a town of about 500 residents which has not had a break-in for more than three years after installing their system. Tree Code Designated as a Tree City USA by the Arbor Day Foundation since 2006, Medina has always been a leader in urban tree codes. Since 1972, the City of Medina has codified the value that trees bring to a community, and the Tree Code ordinances have consistently been modified throughout the years. Major revisions in 2000, 2003 and 2006 have improved the code such that it is one of the most extensive in the region. The current code (2006 edition) protects large trees and requires significant mitigation if they are removed. In 2011, the City Council directed the Planning Commission to update the existing tree code. Dividing the task into two phases, the Planning Commission brought Phase I, which were largely administrative changes, to Council in 2014, where it was passed into law. Phase II changes have been underway since then, with much work and input from the community, an ad hoc tree committee, the Planning Commission and City Council. It is anticipated that the new code will be adopted in mid-2015. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Medina is connected to Seattle, on the western shore of Lake Washington, by State Route 520 on the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, the longest floating bridge in the world. Climate This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 ¬∞F. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Medina has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csb\\" on climate maps. Government and politics The City of Medina is a non-charter code city with a council‚Äìmanager government. The city council is composed of seven members elected in non-partisan, at-large elections to four-year terms. The council elects a ceremonial mayor and deputy mayor from its members, serving a two-year term, and appoint a city manager to execute its legislative policies and oversee the government. The current city manager is Michael Sauerwein. Despite its wealthy residents, the city government had a budget shortfall of 8 percent forecast for 2020. A property tax increase was approved by a narrow margin in the November 2019 elections. Medina has traditionally been a Republican stronghold at the local and national levels. However, like neighboring communities, it has become more competitive between the two major parties in recent elections.  State level  Medina is part of the 48th Legislative District, and its current legislators in the Washington State Legislature are: * Senator Patty Kuderer * Representative Joan McBride * Representative Vandana Slatter The 48th district also includes the more Democratic leaning area of adjacent Bellevue.

Accessed December 10, 2008. with Seattle to its west and Bellevue to its east. Mercer Island is connected to the mainland on both sides by bridges carrying Interstate 90. The Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and the parallel Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge are floating bridges that span Lake Washington and carry, respectively, eastbound and westbound lanes of Interstate 90 and connect Mercer Island to the northern portion of Seattle's South End. I-90 traverses the northern portion of Mercer Island and is then carried from the island to Bellevue over the East Channel of Lake Washington by the East Channel Bridge. Mercer Island is located closer to Bellevue than it is to Seattle, and is therefore often considered to be part of King County's Eastside. The population was 22,699 at the 2010 census and an estimated 25,894 in 2019. Mercer Island is the most populated island in a lake within the United States. The ZIP code 98040 is unique to Mercer Island. Mercer Island has the fifth highest per-capita income in the state of Washington and is one of the 100 richest ZIP codes in the USA according to the IRS figures for Adjusted Gross Income.http://wealth.mongabay.com/tables/100_income_zip_codes-10000.html History The western side of the island was home to two Snoqualmie villages prior to white settlement in the Puget Sound region. Mercer Island, named for the Mercer family of Seattle, was first settled between 1870 and 1880. The Mercer brothers often rowed between the island and Seattle to pick berries, hunt, and fish. Those brothers, Thomas Mercer and Asa Mercer, were members of the Mercer family of Virginia. The first large settlement, East Seattle, was toward the northwest side of the island‚Äînear the McGilvara neighborhood. During 1889, a C C Calkins built a large and gilded resort, the Calkins Hotel. The hotel was reached via steamboat between Madison Park, Leschi Park, and the Eastside. Guests included President Benjamin Harrison, of 1901, amongst other well-to-do dignitaries from Seattle to the East Coast of the United States. Burned by a mysterious fire, the hotel was razed during 1908. The Calkins Landing continued service and presumably aided the establishment of a more permanent population. A denser urban community with business district developed toward the central northern island between the McGilvra neighborhood and Luther Burbank Park. This community now composes the majority of the island's crest through the Middle Island neighborhood. In 1923, the East Channel Bridge was built to connect the island with Bellevue. In 1930, George W. Lightfoot requested a bridge between Mercer Island and Seattle. The Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge, currently the second longest floating bridge in the world, was built and opened in 1940. In 1989, a second bridge, the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, was built parallel to the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge. The East Channel Bridge, Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge, and Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, carry Interstate 90 from Seattle, across Mercer Island, and into Bellevue. The City of Mercer Island was incorporated from East Seattle on July 5, 1960, and comprised all the island minus the business district. Just over one month later, August 9, the Town of Mercer Island was incorporated from that business district. The two aforementioned municipalities merged as the City of Mercer Island on May 19, 1970.

The population was 6,335 at the 2010 census. Based on per capita income, Normandy Park ranks 31st of 614 areas in the state of Washington. History Normandy Park was officially incorporated on June 8, 1953. The city is located in King County and is bordered on the north by the City of Burien and by the City of Des Moines to the south. The Seattle-Tacoma Land Company was organized in the mid-1920s for the purpose of developing of land on the shores of Puget Sound between Seattle and Tacoma. The development was to be known as Normandy Park, a planned residential community with strict building codes and numerous restrictions. It was to be a community of distinctive architecture in the French Normandy style, and there was to be a yacht club, two community beaches and a golf course. By 1929, the entire area had been platted. Good gravel roads were built and a water system installed that was fed from deep wells in the area. An elegant clubhouse was built on what is now known as \\"Lot A,\\" and promotional efforts such as free refreshments and band concerts were offered there to promote Normandy Park. Building started with a distinctive brick house on Lot 1, Block 20, built by C. S. Hughett. This house was considered to be the first built according to the plans of the developers. The house is located at 17999 Normandy Terrace SW. A few other houses in the French Normandy style were built soon after, as well as two Prudence Penny Budget houses. The depression brought a halt to all development activities of Normandy Park and the Seattle-Tacoma Land Company abandoned the project.

History The Ravensdale Market Ravensdale was originally called \\"Leary\\", after the Leary Coal Company, in turn, named for John Leary, a Seattle pioneer. The latter name came from the flocks of ravens that fed on grain spilled from the boxcars on the Northern Pacific Railroad tracks that ran through the town. Underground coal mining commenced around 1899 by the Seattle and San Francisco Railway and Navigation Company, although coal had been mined in nearby Danville and Landsburg a few years earlier. The coal mines were later acquired by the Northwest Improvement Company (NWI), a subsidiary of Northern Pacific. In 1907, Ravensdale was a coal mining town with a population of about 1,000 residents, most of whom worked for the mining company. Ravensdale was officially incorporated on August 15, 1913. On November 16, 1915, at 1:25 p.m. an explosion occurred at the mine, killing 31 men, one of the worst coal mining accidents in Washington state history. The NWI mine was closed permanently and many of the immigrant miners left town seeking work elsewhere. A number of coal miners from Ravensdale moved to Ray, Arizona, to mine copper. The town was disincorporated in the 1920s. Over the decades, coal mining continued to fuel Ravensdale's economy as new mines were developed operating on the Danville, Landsburg, and McKay coal seams. The Dale Coal Company became one of the more successful from about 1924‚Äì1941, followed by the Continental Coal Company from 1942‚Äì1944, the Anderson Coal Company from 1943‚Äì1948; and Palmer Coking Coal Company from 1937‚Äì1975. On January 29, 1955, four miners were lost in the Landsburg mine when a cave-in filled the mine with water, mud and debris. On December 17, 1975, at 2:30 p.m., the Rogers No. 3 mine was dynamited shut by Palmer Coking Coal Company. This was the last underground coal mine in the state of Washington.
