Markham, ON: Penguin, 1986. () Canadian folk music has a long history, dating from the 16th and 17th century, mostly derived from the music of early settlers; much earlier for the music of indigenous people. Folk music thus differentiates between traditional and contemporary. Many of Canada's most influential folk artists emerged in the contemporary folk music era, notably Bruce Cockburn, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Ferron, Gordon Lightfoot, Joni Mitchell, Kate & Anna McGarrigle, Leonard Cohen, Murray McLauchlan, Stan Rogers, Valdy, Penny Lang, The Rankin Family and Wade Hemsworth. In the 1970s, chansonniers grew steadily less popular with the encroachment of popular rock bands and other artists, and many of the folk clubs, such as the Montreal Folk Workshop, and groups such as The Raftsmen, the Mountain City Four and, eventually, The Travellers, that had served to foster the mid-20th century revival closed down. Some new performers did emerge, however, including Jacques Michel, Claude Dubois, and Robert Charlebois. The Canadian Folk Music Awards are presented annually to musicians carrying on in the tradition.  Elements of Canadian Folk Music  Most genres of music have their known instruments that are played to compose a song. The principal instrument for Canadian folk music is known to be the fiddle. The first record of a fiddle in Canada is in 1645 at a wedding in Quebec on the 27th of November. After this account it seems that reports of fiddles are rare for the next 100 years. However, despite this hiatus in reports, the fiddle remains a well known instrument among folk musicians and music.

The plot follows ski jumper Nono Nonomiya, the daughter of a disgraced Olympian who aims to reclaim her family's honor. However, since only men are eligible to compete in the Olympics in ski jumping, Nono cross dresses and assumes her twin brother's identity. Her brother, Y≈´ta Nonomiya, whose name she takes, perished in a fire. It was serialized in Shueisha's seinen manga magazine Weekly Young Jump from October 2007 to December 2010. Shueisha published the series into 13 tank≈çbon volumes  Plot  Nono Nonomiya is a girl with exceptional skill in ski jumping who is hoping to fulfill her father's and her brother's dreams of winning the gold medal at the Olympics. However, since Woman's Ski Jumping isn't a recognized Olympic category, Nono must cross-dress and disguise herself as her twin brother, Yuuta Nonomiya, in order to be eligible to compete. After being admitted into Okushin High School in Nagano, famous for its winter sports clubs, and entering the ski jumping club, her struggle to enter the Olympics and win the gold medal for Japan truly begins.  Characters  = Major characters = ; :Nono Nonomiya is the protagonist of the series, better known as Yuuta Nonomiya. She was originally from Hokkaido, but moved after her brother's death. Ever since she was young, she displayed a lot of talent in ski jumping. Before high school, she was in three competitions, all while she was in her third year of elementary school. The first two were elementary school competitions that she easily won. In the third competition, she was put in the middle school division, facing boys up to six years her senior, but she still ended up placing first. She hoped to make her father, a former Olympic ski jumper, proud of her but she didn't realize that women can't enter the Olympics. Her talent and her brother's lack of talent resulted in her father resenting her and her brother envying her. Once she realized that she couldn't earn an Olympic medal, she decided to quit ski jumping even though she loved the sport. However, when her brother committed suicide in a fire, he left a note for Nono, telling her to throw away her real identity to pretend to be him. :Nono wears a corset in order to hide her breasts. Despite posing as a man and trying her best to act manly, she has a liking for feminine and cute things. She is very intelligent and has the top grades of her year. This combined with her bishounen aspect caused her to be the target of Mikage early in the story. She, however, has feelings for a fellow member of the ski jumping club, Akira Amatsu. Nono occasionally sees a vision of her brother before she jumps and considers this as a sign that the jump will go poorly. ; :Akira was born into a family of ski jumping medalists, a fact which he is very proud of. However, his father and grandfather only managed to obtain silver medals in the Olympics, giving the family the nickname \\"silver medal collectors\\". Akira will easily forgive anyone who talks badly about him, but does not stand anyone insulting his family. Since he wanted to be recognized by his talent rather than his family name, he decided to make everyone acknowledge him by never losing. His father stated that Akira will prioritize winning over his own life. As a result of his hard work and his lineage, his talent was noticed at an early age. He got a joint development with a Northern European ski manufacturers when he was 15 years old. :Akira has an odd allergy to women, and will break out into hives whenever he's close to one. The only females he can be close to without reacting to are those he likes. = Secondary characters = ; :Mikage is a famous figure skater, well known for having won an international championship. She is a feminine and cute girl, and many students like her. She, however, fell in love with Nono, whom she believes is male, during the opening ceremony of the school. She immediately confessed, which resulted in her being rejected. Later that day, she walked in on Nono dressing and saw Nono wearing panties. However, she thought that Nono just liked wearing women's underwear. Nono admitted this in order not to get caught, and Mikage thus stated that Nono should be her slave if she did not want her to tell everyone about this. :In spite of her manipulative and playful nature, she really likes Nono and cares a lot about her. This is shown when she offers Nono to live at her place after Nono was almost raped by her roommate in the male dorms and when she tried to cheer the Nono up whenever she's feeling down. She notices Nono's liking towards Akira, and takes a disliking to him as a result. Since her sport involves resistance rather than strength, her endurance is greater than that of the ski club's member's. Even though she is often described as a genius, in reality she's a hard-working girl who will train endlessly in order to improve and become a better skater. ; :Yoda is a sports magazine editor and is often seen around ski jumping events. His goal is to bring more attention to the sport. He was once a ski jumper himself, but quit after realizing he had no talent. He claims to be able to tell the level of a person's talent with one glance by seeing the aura they give off. Wanting to stir up things in the skiing world, he lied to Akira to get him to compete against Nono. He once stated that Nono and Akira would be the ones who would change the Japan's future in ski jumping. Yoda was also the first person in the story to discover that Nono is actually a girl pretending to be her brother. ; :Yuuta is Nono's twin brother. He committed suicide before the start of the story, however all the official records state that Nono was the one who died. Due to his father failing to win a gold medal at the Olympics, Yuuta spent a lot of time daily training in ski jumping. However, due to lack of talent and his father forcing him to use older techniques rather than modern ones, Yuuta did poorly in the sport. Even in middle school, he couldn't beat the 67 meter mark that Nono set at a competition when they were in third grade. In his final year of competition in middle school, Yuuta placed 85th out of 89 people in the Hokkaido regional tournament. Since he was never even able to get to the second jump at regionals, he was nicknamed \\"regional dropout\\". His father would occasionally beat him in anger and disappointment and once threatened to kill him if he didn't do well enough. He envied Nono for her talent but he also felt guilty because it was due to his lack of talent that Nono felt compelled to quit ski jumping. Besides ski jumping, Yuuta worked part time in construction and spent his free time painting. He had a lot of talent in painting but he refused to acknowledge it because he felt he had to ski jump. He won a national art competition but he died before he heard the results. After his father's attempted suicide, Yuuta decided to commit suicide himself. He stole Nono's clothes and set fire to the shed he was in. He left a note for Nono, telling her to become him and win the gold medal. :Nono will occasionally see a vision of him before she jumps and considers this as an indication that the jump will go poorly. ; :Yuusuke is the father of Nono and Yuuta. He used to represent Japan internationally in ski jumping and was celebrated nationally. However the last competition he did was the team event at the Olympics. Japan was in first place and all Yuusuke had to do was a regular jump for Japan to win. However, due to pressure and a preexisting knee injury, Yuusuke fell causing Japan to go into fourth place. This caused all of Japan to hate Yuusuke and by extension his family. The situation was so bad, that Nono's and Yuuta's last names were changed from Yura to Nonomiya, their mother's maiden name. :Since Yuusuke was no longer able to compete, he wished for his son to earn the gold medal at the Olympics in his stead. However, Yuuta had no talent in ski jumping while his sister Nono had an abundance of talent. Since women can't compete in the Olympics, this resulted in Yuusuke resenting his daughter and beating his son. After the Yuuta's final Hokkaido regional tournament, Yuusuke gave up on his son. He attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself but Yuuta and Nono found him. Yuusuke was gotten to the hospital in enough time to save his life but remains in a coma. ; :Kiyoshi is a high school senior in Okushin High and leader of the Nordic Skiing squad. Even though the leadership of the ski club is switched between the Alpine and Nordic squad leaders, the Alpine leader took the seat for two years in a row due to Kiyoshi's twisted nature. Due to this, Kiyoshi forces everyone to call him \\"Emperor\\". He dislikes his own surname, since it literally means \\"Anal Shop\\", and will react violently if he is referred by it. He is a veteran jumper and placed third at the inter high competition in his junior year. This, together with holding the best records in the club, make him the ace of the team. Kiyoshi is in love with Mikage and tries to blackmail Nono into taking pictures of her breasts. ; :Hiroki is a high school freshman in Okushin High and is a member of the ski jumping club. He's been friends with Akira since middle school and quickly becomes good friends with Nono. He used to attend elementary school with Kiyoshi, and thus knows of his terrible personality. He believes that Shiriya once killed a jumper who was better than him and thus is terrified of Kiyoshi.

The cotton mill was built in 1900 by the Merrimack Manufacturing Company, reaching a peak of 1,600 employees by 1955. The mill was sold in 1946, and became known as the Huntsville Manufacturing Company. It operated until 1989 and was torn down in 1992. Houses in the adjoining mill village were built between 1900 and 1937, and encompass many mill house styles not commonly seen outside New England. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History In 1898 the Merrimack Manufacturing Company, based in Lowell, Massachusetts, began to look for a location to build a cotton spinning mill in the Southern United States. Tracy W. Pratt, a Huntsville businessman who owned the West Huntsville Cotton Mill and would later be instrumental in building Lowe Mill, convinced the company to choose a site southwest of Huntsville. The company broke ground on 1,385 acres (560 ha) near Brahan Spring the following year, and the mill opened in 1900. The mill produced grey cloth which was finished in Rock Hill, South Carolina. When it opened, the mill employed about 500‚Äì750 people, operating 1,800 looms and 25,000 spindles. The mill was powered by steam from a coal boiler until it was converted to electricity in 1920. A village of about 60 houses was built to house the workers. The village also contained a dry goods store, operated by the W. L. Halsey Company, which also had space for community organization meetings. See also: Soon after opening, Merrimack announced the construction of a second mill, which would be completed in 1904. The new mill brought the capacity up to 90,000 spindles and 2,900 looms. Joseph J. Bradley, Sr., became the mill's agent in 1905; he began improving services for those in the village. The first hospital opened in one of the village houses in 1913 and was replaced by a larger, dedicated facility in 1916. The first school also opened in 1913, followed by a four-room schoolhouse in 1914 and a larger brick building in 1919, which was later named in Bradley's honor. Several new houses were also built in the 1910s. Buoyed by profits from high production during World War I, the mill expanded in 1920, adding 30,000 square feet (2,800 sq. m.) to Mill No. 1. The mill store was greatly expanded the same year, incorporating the old frame structure and adding a gymnasium, theater, two community rooms, and other amenities. Beginning in 1922, the village houses were wired for electricity, and sidewalks and a sanitary sewer system were added. Further houses were built, bringing the total to 279 by 1925. During the 1920s and the Great Depression, the company fell into financial trouble. Merrimack reached 1400 employees in 1925, but just two years later, employment had fallen to 850. To raise capital, the mill began selling the village houses, first to employees and then to investors, although they continued to build new houses until 1937. Labor unions also became a presence among the workforce. From July 17 until September 22, 1934, a strike by the United Textile Workers of America brought violence to Huntsville, as part of a nationwide effort to improve working conditions in textile mills; another strike at Merrimack and Dallas Mill followed in 1937. Business rebounded during World War II, but soon after, facing aging equipment and soft prices due to overseas competition, Merrimack sold the mill to M. Lowenstein and Co. of New York City. At the time of the sale, the mill employed about 800 and had 110,000 spindles and 2,500 looms. Lowenstein invested $1.7 million in modernizing equipment, and expanded to a 24-hour production day. Beginning in 1949, 269 more houses were sold to employees. Two years later, the school was donated to the Madison County School District and Brahan Springs, behind the mill, was donated to the city. By 1955, the two mill buildings were connected, and the entire mill was air conditioned, bringing the mill to its peak of 1,600 employees, 145,896 spindles, and 3,437 looms. Lowenstein sold the mill to Springs Industries in 1988, who operated it for one year before closing it completely. The mills were demolished in 1992, and the land today is used as a public park. Architecture Merrimack Hall served as the mill's store and community center The mill buildings, completed in 1900 and 1904, were designed by preeminent mill architects Lockwood, Greene & Co. Mill No. 1 was three stories and Mill No. 2 was five stories, both of brick with arched lintels and stone sills. Mill No. 1 had the carding, drawing, and picking areas plus a repair shop on the first floor; weaving on the second floor; and spooling, warping, and spinning on the third. The village is laid out along a grid pattern broken by a Y-shaped street which led to the mill and contained the superintendent's house in the Y. This design is identical to that of Merrimack's mill village in Massachusetts, platted in 1820. The houses followed several basic plans: Type A, a one-story, duplex shotgun house; Type B, a rectangular duplex with double central entry doors and a shed roof porch; Type J, a two-story I-house, usually with a shed roof rear addition; Type L, a two-story, cross-gable duplex with side entrances covered by shallow-pitched gable porches; and Type M, a one-story, hipped roof duplex with a shed roofed front porch. The 96 Type L houses, most of which were constructed in the first wave of construction before 1910, represent the largest collection of the type in the South.

Pretail allows new product ideas/prototypes to be mass produced only when they have reached an initial threshold of buy-in from investors/consumers. Hartley, Scott. \\"Pre- Tail, E-Tail, to Retail: The New Commerce Pipeline\\", Forbes, September 7th, 2012. Pretail includes pre-sale commerce, pre-order retailers, pre-launch marketing services, incubation marketplaces, crowdfunding communities, and demand chain management systems. Pretail results in: marketing efficiency, margin efficiency (cutting down on the middlemen like physical retailers or distributors), and product efficiency (getting direct feedback from potential customers fosters innovation and eliminates guesswork). Retailers today are increasingly pretailing to test, promote, and monetize consumer demand in the initial phase of the new commerce pipeline as first introduced in a 2012 Forbes article. Some examples are: Tesla‚Äôs model 3 pre-order or VR gaming headset Oculus Rift funded through Kickstarter. Consumers engaging in pretail are known as an early adopter, fan, backer, supporter, or presumer (pre-launch consumer). Growth Pretail demand is growing in consumer retail: electronics, movies, music, video games, books, fashion, software apps, connected devices, cars, toys, cosmetics, art, events, etc.Trend briefing report, \\"Pretail: Why consumers now love to shop at the concept stage\\", Trendwatching.com, June 2013 This trend is being driven by companies to enhance new product development, better organize product releases, lower market risk, and increase early fan adoption.Gansky, Lisa. \\"The Rise of Pre- Commerce: The sharing economy and crowdfunding have fundamentally altered the way we develop products\\", FastCompany, April 25th, 2013 Large companies such as Amazon and Apple are pre-tailing new products to measure demand, manage supply chain market dynamics, and monetize fandom anticipation. Entrepreneurs and small companies are embracing crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo before product realization to fund manufacturing, test product- market fit, test market demand, pricing and take pre-orders to build a demand and fandom community. Consumer involvement with products and services pre- launch is becoming mainstream according to industry experts on consumer behavior trends.Trend briefing report, \\"Presumers: The product, the story, the status: why consumer involvement with products and services pre-launch is set to go mainstream\\", Trendwatching.com, November 2013 = Differencies with other forms of commerce = Pretail is related to a wide variety of business areas: from product innovation (concept & ideation) and supply chain management to marketing and sales. The aim of pretail is to build customer awareness and get sufficient financing to start product development. Pretail is future-oriented and is usually implemented using crowdfunding platforms, controlled media channels, mass media, and social networks.  Pretail as a competitive advantage  = Evolution of consumer preferences = The tendency of consumers to increasingly value the experience associated with a process of purchasing gives rise to experiential buying - creating a memorable buying experience. Pretail provides a sense of belongingness that customers perceive as important. Crowdfunding platforms make consumers feel that they are part of a community that consists of people who are interested in the particular product or service. Consumers thus consider the product as \\"the first\\", \\"the newest\\", \\"the one that I helped launch\\". Pretail is gaining popularity as it satisfies the demand for novel products which are of high consumers\` interest nowadays. = Market evaluation tool = Pretail allows innovators to test their product-market fit with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) equivalent. Thanks to pretailing risks associated with launching a product - financing and manufacturing are thus reduced. In addition to this, more people can participate in the project as investors or salesmen. By testing the demand for the project entrepreneurs can lower perceived and actual risks associated with launching a product and starting a company. By using pretail model companies can match supply and demand trends before they actually start producing a product. It is the framework that serves for connecting increasingly demanding consumers and entrepreneurs. However, using pretial model for launching does not guarantee success of the product or enterprise, not all pretailers become e-tailers. Some services and products never take off, while others receive strong indications of market demand, receive large volumes of pre-orders, and raise the capital needed for starting manufacturing. Those kinds of services or products are the ones that succeed to become e-tailers. = Supply chain and finance = Product development costs are pushed down, more and more people can start their own business, create goods, and provide services to broader audiences. By being able to measure demand before mass production is started allows companies to forecast financing needed and develop inventory policy more accurately.  Successful examples  = Opal Nugget Ice Maker = Opal Nugget Ice Maker is a specialized ice maker which collected more than $2.7 million on the Indiegogo. This ice maker freezes water in a special way. Rather than freezing the water directly, the ice maker scrapes flakes away from the cylinder, and trough that process creates a lot of chewable ice nuggets. This type of ice making is often used in upscale cocktail bars or fast-food chains. However, machines used there are usually big and expensive. That is the reason why this project collected such a substantial amount of money. = Oculus Virtual Reality Headset = Oculus Headset is a virtual reality set that was initially started by Palmer Luckey as a side project. In 2014 the company was acquired by Facebook for $2 billion. One of the reasons for this acquisition was the apparent public interest in this type of technology which was shown two years earlier when the campaign on Kickstarter managed to raise a total of $2.4 million when the project was still in the prototype stage. = Glowforge Laser Marker, Engraver and Cutter = Glowforge laser marker, engraver and laser cutter has a successful and unique pretail story. Unlike many other projects, it attracted a substantial amount of capital without big platforms such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo. With a team of only 14 people, the company went from an unknown startup to a popular enterprise that raised $28 million during its self-run campaign. Glowforge has been awarded three Make Editor‚Äôs Choice Awards at the World Maker Faire event in New York.

He is known for bringing modern standards of scholarship to the study of Chinese classical writings, for editing the Harvard-Yenching Index Series, and for his biography of Du Fu, Tu Fu: China's Greatest Poet, which is considered a classic in the English world on the studies of Du Fu.L. Carrington Goodrich (1953). Review of Tu Fu, China's Greatest Poet, by William Hung. The Far Eastern Quarterly, Vol. 12, No. 2 (Feb., 1953), pp. 214-217' He became a Christian while a student at the Anglo-Chinese College in Fuzhou, then went to Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware, Ohio, Columbia University, and Union Theological Seminary. On his return to China, he became Professor and Dean of Yenching University, where he was instrumental in establishing the Harvard-Yenching Institute.Who's Who in China, 3rd ed. Shanghai: The China Weekly Review. 1925. He came to Harvard in 1946 and spent the rest of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts, teaching and mentoring students. William Hung was the oldest of six children. His father gave him the \\"school name\\" Hong Ye (\\"Great Enterprise\\"), and then when he left for the United States he took the given name William. He married Rhoda Kong in 1919, and the couple had three children, Ruth, Gertrude, and Agnes. Family and education William Hung was born on 27 October 1893 in Fuzhou. In 1901 Hung traveled with his family from Fuzhou to Shandong, where Hung's father was a county magistrate for the Qing government. He began his Confucian studies there at the age of four, but soon also began to read traditional novels. He entered the Shandong Teachers College after scoring number one on the entrance exam. He was awarded a monthly stipend of two taels of silver, but was forced to transfer to a Resident Guest School because the local Shandong students taunted him for his southern accent and resented the advantage of his head start in Confucian learning. On his return to Fuzhou, he entered the Anglo- Chinese College, a Christian school run by Methodist missionaries. Christianity, however, had little initial appeal. Hung set out to persuade his fellow students this foreign doctrine was inferior to Confucian teachings by publicly comparing the \\"worst parts\\" of Christianity to the \\"best parts\\" of the Chinese classics. He escaped expulsion only when the principal's wife, Elizabeth Gowdy, came to his defense. In response to Hung's request to return and help defend Confucianism against the foreigners, Hung's father returned to Fuzhou. When he visited the cemetery to pay respects to the family graves, he caught pneumonia and died. Hung was devastated. Mrs. Gowdy won him to Christianity when she explained she did not believe the concept popular among some Christians, namely good heathen men such as Hung's father would go to hell, or, for that matter, she was not sure there was such a place. The Bible, she argued, was like a feast at which you would choose which food that was healthy and attractive and which was not; in reading the Bible you should pay attention to the parts you found beneficial, not the contradictions and mistakes that had also accumulated over the centuries. Hung, who had also heard the liberal Sherwood Eddy preach, was converted to this liberal interpretation of the Christian message. After graduating in 1916, Hung's knowledge of English and German gave him the choice of several jobs in government agencies dealing with foreigners, but a wealthy American wrote from St. Louis offering to pay for his study in the United States. The Fuzhou Methodist Bishop James Bashford recommended Hung enroll at the Ohio Wesleyan University, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1917. In 1919, Hung obtained a master's degree from Columbia University, where he studied under James Harvey Robinson, leader of the New History, and in 1920, a degree from Union Theological Seminary in New York. In 1919, Hung, through their common work with the Chinese Students' Association and the Intercollegiate YMCA, met Rhoda Kong, who had left China at an early age and grown up in Hawaii. They soon married, and their two children, Gertrude and Ruth, were born in 1919 and 1921. From 1921 to 1922, Hung served as Chinese Secretary for the Board of Foreign Missions of Methodist Episcopal Church giving more than one hundred lectures throughout the United States. Once, when he had finished his talk, a member of the audience told him that his speech was so exciting that should take this as a career. Hung was personable, funny and succinct and soon became a popular figure on the lecture circuit. In 1922, Hung taught at DePauw University, in Indiana as Horizon Lecturer, and In 1923 he became the Acting Head of the History Department of Yenching University.ÂåÖ‰∏ΩÊïèÔºåÊ¥™‰∏öÔºöË¶ÅËøõÊ≠•ÂÖàË¶ÅÂæÄÂêéËµ∞Ôºå‰∫∫Ê∞ëÁΩëÔºå2006Âπ¥01Êúà18Êó• While in the United States, Hung became a member of the New York City Civic Club, the Clergy Club, the China Institute, and Phi Beta Kappa. He also joined the American Historical Association and the Berlin Gesellschaft Fur Kirchengeschichte (Church History Society). Career at Yenching and the Harvard-Yenching Institute Yenching University, which had opened in 1919, under the leadership of President John Leighton Stuart set out to become the leading Christian university in China. Hung was one of the first scholars trained in the West Stuart recruited. Hung joined Yenching in 1922 as a part-time lecturer in history, also serving as the Chinese pastor in a Methodist mission for students from Fujian in Peking. As he became a full-time instructor, then head of the department, and then Dean of the college his strong ambition was to make the History Department known for combining knowledge of classical Chinese sources with up to date training in western scholarship. He announced his ambition to raise Yenching's academic quality and to \\"make it the peer of Peita\\" (Peking University). The establishment of the Harvard-Yenching Institute was a major project for Hung and President Stuart. An American industrialist had bequeathed a substantial endowment for the support of Christian higher education in Asia, but Harvard had moved to use it to establish Chinese studies on its own campus, with a supporting program in Peking. Stuart and Hung were determined to make Yenching the home for the Chinese side of the new development though Harvard leaders were leaning toward Peking University on the assumption a Christian missionary university would be second rate. In the end, Harvard agreed to make Yenching their partner, but not before Hung helped to overcome a possible stumbling block. In 1925, a Yenching student named Wang came to Hung's campus residence late at night to report a matter of patriotic concern. The previous year Wang had acted as interpreter for Langdon Warner, a Harvard professor of art history who had been travelling on an exploratory trip to the cave libraries at Dunhuang. Wang had accidentally come across Warner experimenting with cheesecloth and glycerin to remove unique murals, and now Wang reported Warner had returned with a large supply of those materials. Knowing Warner was a key negotiator for Harvard and he was in secret talks with nearby Peking University, Hung instructed Wang to act as if nothing had happened, but also arranged with a colleague in the Ministry of Education to instruct every local official along the route Warner was to be warmly welcomed, but never left alone at any historic site. By 1927 Hung felt he could brag Yenching no longer had to \\"share the disgrace of inferior Chinese courses, a charge so frequently made against missionary education institutions.\\" Yet, he resigned as Dean at the height of the Nationalist Party's drive to unite the country, partly because he came to feel he did not have enough time to know the students or faculty, and partly some students felt his methods were too rigid and Americanized. He suspected even President Stuart felt his discipline alienated students who were strong nationalists or communists, perhaps egged on by the older teachers of Chinese. In 1928, as part of the new Institute's activities, Harvard University invited Hung to Cambridge, where he offered \\"The Far East Since 1793.\\" Though it was taught in the Department of Far Eastern Languages, not the Department of History, it the first survey course of Chinese history to be taught at Harvard.Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations Harvard University The following year he returned to Yenching to resume his leadership of the Department of History and the Institute of Chinese Studies, and was in charge of Harvard-Yenching Institute grants. Sinology and teaching in the 1930s In the 1930s, Hung put his energies into training students and publishing his research. He often met with students at his campus home, which was built to his specifications with an entrance directly into his study, so as not to disturb his family. His bibliography lists more than forty publications after he left the Yenching administration. During his stay at Harvard, Hung had found the lack of bibliographies and indexes an obstacle to training students in Sinology. He determined to use scientific methods to establish reliable texts and create indexes to the most important classical works. Hung wrote introductions to the indexes which were in many cases the most thorough studies on the subject. The series eventually totaled sixty-four volumes. Hung won the 1937 Prix Stanislas Julien for the preface to the Liji index, becoming the second Chinese to receive this award. An even more ambitious project was the preface to the concordance for the Spring and Autumn Annals, a work which Confucius had been credited with editing centuries after its composition. By showing solar eclipses in the text corresponded to modern calculations, Hung demonstrated the work was a true record of its time, not a later text. Hung finished work on the volume while Japanese war planes dropped their bombs only a few hundred yards from the Yenching campus. Among the students Hung trained at Yenching in these years were many who went on to teach at American universities, including Kenneth K.S. Chen, Fang Chao-ying, Tu Lien-chieh, James T.C. Liu, and Teng Ssu-yu. After the Japanese Army captured Peking in July 1937, Hung continued his sinological research under increasingly difficult circumstances. In 1940, at the age of 47, Hung published Index to Du Fu's Poetry. In 1940 Hung returned to Ohio Wesleyan to accept an honorary doctorate. In 1941, the Japanese Army occupied the Yenching campus. Hung and his colleagues secretly worked at the Sino-French University (‰∏≠Ê≥ïÂ§ßÂ≠¶, l'Universit√© Franco-Chinoise) to publish several further volumes in the index series. When war with the United States was declared in December 1941, the Japanese army arrested 12 Yenching University professors, including Hung. They were roughly interrogated, beaten, kept in unheated cells, and fed little. Although they were eventually released, they were not allowed to return to campus. Hung refused to cooperate with the Japanese. After the war After the Allied victory in August 1945, Hung returned to the devastated Yenching campus. He thought of going to the United States, first to catch up with scholarly developments and secondly to seek support for Yenching. Harvard University invited him to lecture and Hung left China in April 1946. The University of Hawaii hired him in the spring of 1947 as visiting professor. While he still intended to return to China, Civil War had broken out and the economy deteriorated sharply. That summer, he decided to move back to the Harvard‚ÄìYenching Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts and, with the outbreak of the Korean War, Hung completely abandoned the idea of returning to China. The decision to give up home and Yenching University made him miserable but he felt his will has been exhausted. At the age of fifty, he had to find the courage to meet the challenges of an unknown world. In 1948, the Harvard- Yenching Institute made him a Fellow but did not give him a formal teaching position. Hung and his wife bought a house close by the university, and rented out rooms and collected meager social benefits to survive. While living abroad, Hung still longed for his homeland. He often told friends \\"I love America, I love the motherland, the motherland of my parents.\\" In 1952 Harvard University Press published his Tu Fu: China's Greatest Poet He became Nanyang University of Singapore Board member in 1958. Hung offered Du Fu classes or lectures at Harvard, Yale University, the University of Pittsburgh, University of Hawaii. Among the scholars he influenced with his teaching and attention were David Nivison and Joseph Fletcher. Francis Cleaves, whom he had met in China before the war, became a close friend in Cambridge. Every afternoon at three, the two would meet and have tea. Cleaves, a specialist in Mongolian, introduced Hung to The Secret History of the Mongols. Cleaves disagreed with the conclusions in Hung's article on the transmission of the text, but out of a sense of respect did not publish his own translation until after Hung's death. Old age Hung Ye lived in Cambridge and was actively involved in a prayer fellowship in New York. He also informally assisted Harvard East Asian Studies.Living abroad, he said looking back at his life: \\"In my life of scholarship, my method was the scientific method and I am completely confident that it was not wrong.\\" At the age of 86, when he mounted the podium to lecture for the last time, he said \\"Now the 'Gang of Four' has been overthrown, there can be academic engagement with tradition.\\" In March 1980, Hung fell during his morning exercises, resulting in a fractured elbow, then physical deterioration. The night of December 16, Hung suffered sudden confusion, talking with the people around him in the Fuzhou dialect. On December 22, 1980, Hung died at the age of 87.

The estate a Tasmanian historically important property and dates back to 1828. Quamby was the home of Sir Richard Dry, a premier of Tasmania and the first native-born premier and knight in any Australian colony. The property is now a commercial luxury lodge. The estate features a white Anglo-Indian designed main homestead referred to as Tasmania's Government House of the North, a function pavilion and a golf course. It is situated near the historic township of Hagley. History Quamby Estate was the home of Sir Richard Dry and during his time as premier, Quamby Homestead became known as the \\"Government House of the North\\". Sir Richard Dry was born at Elphin Farm, Launceston, on 7 September 1815. His father, Richard Dry Senior had been transported to Tasmania as a political prisoner for his part in the Irish rebellion of 1804, but was granted his freedom in 1818. When Dry (Senior) died in 1843 he left the Quamby Estate's to his son. Portions of the land have been sold off over time; by 1963 the estate was reduced to . Quamby Estate's main house is a 33-room building in the American Colonial style, that was built over 10 years from 1828. In adulthood Richard Jnr. married Clara Meredith. His parliamentary career began in 1845, when he was nominated to the non-elected Legislative Council by the governor, Sir John Eardley-Wilmot. In 1846, following a clash with the governor, Richard Dry and five other Legislative Councillors resigned their seats as a protest against what they considered the unconstitutional conduct of the governor. They were later reinstated by Queen Victoria. In 1858, on a two-year visit to England, Queen Victoria bestowed on him a knighthood in honour of his outstanding service to the colony of Tasmania. Sir Richard Dry had no heirs and just prior to his death in 1868 he had begun to shed the vast acreage of Quamby Estate. Sir Richard was buried beneath the chancery in the Church he founded, St Mary's at Hagley. Soon after Lady Dry sold Quamby and sailed for England. At the time it was one of the most important land sales ever held in Tasmania. Recognition Quamby Estate is listed on both the now-defunct Register of the National Estate and the Tasmanian Heritage Register. Current usage Current owners and Virgin Australia founders Brett Godfrey and Rob Sherrard purchased Quamby Estate in 2010. They have also invested in several other tourism assets including the Tasmanian Walking Company, Lake House and Low Head in Tasmania. Brett Godfrey co owns Makepeace Island in Queensland with Sir Richard Branson. In 2011 Quamby Estate was fully restored to a lodge housing 10 guest rooms. Quamby Estate is also the base for Tasmanian Walking Companies' Bay of Fires and Cradle Mountain Huts Guided Walks In the early 1990s, the lodge added a golf course, whose 8th hole is the longest par 5 in Tasmania at 576 metres.

Van Wesel and Kannewasser worked together at the De Bijenkorf department store. In 1934 they were discovered while they were playing during a company party with the quartet The Bijko Rhythm Stompers. Two years later they quit their jobs and began performing under the name Johnny & Jones. Their biggest hit was \\"Mijnheer Dinges weet niet wat swing is\\" (\\"Mister Dingus doesn't know what swing is\\"). They made jazz music accompanied by the guitar, and their lyrics, invariably pronounced with an American accent, were characterized by humorous, topical parodies. Beginning in 1937 they were regularly played on the VARA- radio and became immensely popular. Because they were Jews, during the German occupation, Johnny & Jones could only play for Jewish audiences, and after 1941 were not allowed to play at all. In 1943 they and their wives were arrested and sent to the Westerbork transit camp. In the camp they performed once under the name Jonny und Jones since in the revue only the German language was allowed. In 1944 they were sent on a day's work assignment from Westerbork to Amsterdam, during which they managed to clandestinely record the song \\"Westerbork Serenade\\". In the camp their job was to dismantle crashed warplanes.

It was formed in 1901 by United Gas Improvement Company of Philadelphia to manage the streetcar operations of the Connecticut Light and Power Company, which at the time included Central Railway and Electric Company, Norwalk Street Railway, and the Waterbury Traction Company. The newly formed Connecticut Railway and Lighting acquired Bridgeport Traction Company, Derby Street Railway, Milford Street Railway, Shelton Street Railway, Meriden, Southington and Compounce Tramway Company, and the Cheshire Street Railway. Connecticut Railway and Lighting was leased to the Consolidated Railway and in turn the Connecticut Company between 1906 and 1936. Streetcar operations were discontinued in 1937 when all lines were converted to bus. Transit operations continued until 1972, when all remaining bus operations were suspended and taken over by Connecticut Transit, except in Bridgeport- by the Greater Bridgeport Transit District in 1975. Early History (1895-1906) Founded in 1895 was the Gas Supply Company, it was authorized by legislature to manufacture and distribute gas fuel throughout Fairfield County, Connecticut. The name of the Gas Supply Company was changed in 1899 to Connecticut Lighting and Power Company, and its authority expanded to generating and distributing electricity. In 1901, the name was changed to Connecticut Railway and Lighting Company. A number of streetcar and electric utility companies were acquired during the intervening years, building up a large system in the Naugatuck Valley and surrounding region. All of the property controlled by CR&L; was leased to the Consolidated Railway in 1906, which in turn was leased to the Connecticut Company. Connecticut Company control (1906-1936) In 1906 the CR&L; streetcar lines were leased to the Connecticut Company, a subsidiary of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad created to control and operate the majority of electric trolley lines across the state. When the New Haven entered receivership, the Connecticut Company leases were cancelled in 1936 for lack of payment.Hartford Courant, Conn. Co. Will Quit Leased Lines Monday, November 14, 1936, p. 1 CR&L; Lines (1936-1972) Connecticut Railway and Lighting Company resumed independent operation of its lines in 1936, but worked quickly to convert the remaining streetcar lines to bus operation by 1937.New York Times, Buses for Bridgeport, February 10, 1937, p. 5 Stockholders wished to get out of the transit business, and so those operations were sold off in 1943. A number of under- performing bus routes were discontinued over the years until all service was suspended in 1972. The transit franchises were succeeded by Connecticut Transit, except in Bridgeport by the Greater Bridgeport Transportation Authority after its formation in 1975. Between 1972‚Äì1975, remaining local bus routes in Bridgeport were taken over fully or in part by CR&L;'s competing smaller bus companies: Gray Line, Chestnut Hill, Bridgeport Auto Transit, and Stratford Bus Line. A former Milford CT school and charter bus company- Cross Country Coach, purchased a few of CR & L's older buses to operate a regional route between Norwalk, Bridgeport, and New Haven. This was a restoration of two former CR & L routes, which commenced in 1973 and continued until Cross Country Coach ceased operations in the early 1980s.

The hymn illustrates the personality of Kala Bhairava of Kashi (also known as Bhairava), the God of Death(kala). It consists of eight stanzas, characteristic of an Ashtakam. Description Kala Bhairava is described as black, naked body entwined with snakes, fangs, garland of skulls, three eyes, weapons for punishment in four hands, with shining golden bells attached to his waist-belt. His dreadful laughter that shatters the entire creation - that has sprung out from the womb of the Creator, control over ghosts and goblins, The TƒÅ·πá·∏çava dance that is associated with the annihilation of the world, liberation of Souls from bodies- all pointing out to the fact that he is the God of Death. Those who study these 8 verses on Kala Bhairava, which are enticing and which are a source of knowledge and liberation, which increase the righteousness of a person and destroy greed, attachment, depression, anger and heat and enable us to move towards the proximity of feet of Shiva (Kala Bhairava) positively. Summary The first stanza is a salutations to Sri Kala Bhairava the supreme lord of Kasi. His Lotus feet are served by Indra, The king of the devas and the great one who wears snake as his sacrificial thread (a cord worn by the Dvija's hanging from their left shoulder and goes below the right shoulder) and a moon on his head. He is extremely compassionate and is praised by Sage Narada and other Yogis, who also is a Digambara (remains naked). The second stanza is a salutations to Sri Kala Bharaiva who is the supreme Lord of the city of Kasi, who has the brilliance of a million suns, who rescues us from the ocean of worldly existence and who is Supreme, Who has a blue throat, who bestows us with worldly prosperities, which we wish for, and who has three eyes, who is death unto death itself, whose eyes are like a pair of lotus flowers, whose spear supports the three worlds like an axle ( axis) around which they rotate, and who is imperishable. The third stanza is a salutations to Lord Kala Bhairava the Lord of Kasi, who holds a spear, a noose, a club and punishment in his four hands, whose body is dark, who is the primordial Lord, who is imperishable, who is beyond the diseases of the world, who is the lord with terrific powers and who loves the strange vigorous Tandava Dance. ( the dance made by Lord Siva when he is terribly angry and preparing for destruction of the cities or worlds). The fourth stanza is Salutations to Kala Bhairava who is the Lord of Kasi, who is the giver of worldly prosperities as well as liberation and who has an auspicious and pleasing form, who is kind and loving to his devotees, who stands firm as the deity of all the lokas (worlds), who wears a belt containing shining golden bells around his waist- that jingle when he walks or dances creating a variety of pleasing sounds. The fifth stanza is a salutations to Lord Kala Bhairava who is the supreme lord of Kasi, who guards the established institution of the eternal dharma by leading the devotees towards the same, who is the lord that frees us from the fetters of Karma (the results of sins committed by us in our previous births), thereby giving us (great joy of possessing a sinless, free soul), who is embellished with golden coloured serpents entwining his body. The sixth stanza is a salutations to Kala Bhairava whose charming beautiful pair of feet are decked with sandals are decked with studded gems, who is the eternal, non dual Ishta devata (the God whom we cherish), who destroys the pride of death (manifested as fear within us), and whose large terrible serpentine fangs liberate us. The seventh stanza is Salutations to Kala Bhairava Whose loud and terrific laughter shatters the offspring produced by the ovaries of the creator (Lord Brahma), who is the powerful ruler who gives the eight powers( Siddhis), who wears a garland of skulls (like his counterpart Maha Kalika), whose terrific glance destroys the cob-webs, produced in our minds by the mighty rule of Sin. The final stanza is a Salutation to Kala Bhairava the ruler of Kasi, who is the leader of ghosts and spirits, who showers glory on his devotees, who absolves people dwelling in Kasi from their sins as well as the fruits of their righteous deeds - thus making their souls devoid of any connection with the mortal world, who is splendour, who is the lord, efficient in guiding us on the path of righteousness, who is eternally old, and who is the Lord of the universe.

Plot In 1934, in a little village on a canal in Burgundy, a laconic young stranger called Jean is walking along the road when an older woman in black gets off a bus with a heavy load. He helps her carry it to her farm, where she offers him work and a room. He accepts, and soon she is in his bed. She is the widow Couderc, running the farm single- handed with her infirm father-in-law. Across the canal live her sister-in-law and ineffectual husband, who are trying to evict the widow and gain the property. They have a 16-year-old daughter, F√©licie, who has already managed to have a baby, father uncertain. Jean enjoys helping on the farm, but will reveal little of his past. His father was rich, he says, and he wanted to become a doctor but killed a man, ending up in jail from which he has escaped. The widow accepts his story, but her trust is strained when he can't resist sleeping with the alluring F√©licie as well.

F√©licie is free with her favours, but has a baby to look after full-time. *Property is key. Jean has nothing, while all the widow has is the farm. All her sister-in-law wants is to evict the widow and gain the farm. *Class is its own barrier. Jean, an educated man, is reduced to the life of a peasant. The peasants he has landed among have no ambition beyond working the land. *Family is a battleground. Jean, a murderer on the run, is completely estranged from his family. The widow is in daily war with her in-laws across the canal. Reception The film opened at number one at the box office in Paris with a first week gross of $163,000.

A descendant of the important Genoese family of Zaccaria, he was the son of Manuele Zaccaria and Clarisia Fieschi. His father was the brother of Benedetto I Zaccaria, the founder of Zaccaria fortunes in Byzantium and Latin Greece. He was appointed governor of Phocaea by his uncle Benedetto I and remained in office after his death, when he became governor of the Lordship of Chios. In 1306 Tedisio campaigned in Thasos, where he captured the castle and made the island his fief. In 1307 Benedetto II Zaccaria decided to replace to Tedisio with a new governor. The new governor, Andriolo Cattaneo, sent his son Domenico against Tedisio, and took over Phocaea. Tedisio then fled to Gallipoli where he sought the support of the Catalan Company. In 1307 he campaigned against Phocaea. After a siege he captured the city, but he was unable to keep it under control, and was forced to retreat to Thasos to defend his fief. The Catalan historian Ramon Muntaner refers in his Chronicle that the raid into the castle of Phokaia allowed Zaccaria to take with him the relics of the Holy Cross, a white shirt made by the Virgin Mary, and a codex with the Apocalypsis, all of them taken after the Turkish conquest into Pholaia from the tomb of Saint John, the author of the Gospel, in Ephesos. The fragments of the Holy Cross were given to the same Muntaner, as he was the Chancellor of the Catalan Company, while Zaccaria retained the other relics. Zaccaria remained lord of Thasos until 1313, when the island was reconquered by the Byzantines.

The event is hosted one weekend per year in the Greater Tokyo Area. The event is held at the Makuhari Messe convention center in Chiba. JAEPO is one of the largest amusement-machine trade fairs in the world. It is organised by the combined efforts of the Japan Amusement Machine and Marketing Association (JAMMA) and the Amusement Machine Operators' Union (AOU). Before 2012, these organisations each produced separate trade fairs in Greater Tokyo: the Amusement Machine Show and the AOU Show, respectively. History The Amusement Machine Show, or AM Show, was sponsored by the Japan Amusement Machinery Manufacturers Association (JAMMA) and the Japan Amusement Park Equipment Association (JAPEA). In 2012, JAMMA and JAPEA merged and reincorporated as the Japan Amusement Machine and Marketing Association. They partnered with the Amusement Machine Operators' Union to promote a single event. The AM Show was scheduled for one weekend in either September, October, or November; the AOU Show occurred in February. When the events merged, the organisers retained the AOU Show's February schedule. The 49th Amusement Machine Show was held on 15‚Äì17 September 2011 at Makuhari Messe (which remains the venue for JAEPO). The first two days of the expo were for industry invitees only, and the final day was open to the public. The final AOU Show was the weekend of 18 February 2012; it, too, was held at Makuhari Messe.

The party was founded in Bucharest on 15 July 1928, as a leftist splinter group of the Social Democratic Party, formed by a minority that opposed the cooperation with the National Peasants' Party. Background Following the decision of the May 1922 Congress of the Socialist Party of Romania (PSR) to unconditionally affiliate to the Third International (Comintern), the Romanian authorities arrested en masse its leadership, accused of conspiracy against state security. The supporters of the unconditional affiliation reformed themselves as the Socialist Communist Party, with PSR members which had only supported an affiliation preserving party autonomy either leaving or being expelled at the request of the Comintern. The latter group, known as \\"unitarian\\", created a new Socialist Party of Romania (PS) in early 1922, after some of its leaders were freed from detention. While initially adopting the radical 1919 program of the PSR, the party toned down its rhetoric after joining the minor Social Democratic Party in August 1922, to constitute the Romanian Old Kingdom section of the Federation of Romanian Socialist Parties (FPSR). The Federation had been constituted in June 1921 by the reformist groups that had left the original PSR in early February, dissatisfied with the growing strength of the communist faction. Unlike the Transylvanian and Bukovina sections of the FPSR, the Socialist Party of the Old Kingdom maintained a more leftist orientation, being more open to cooperation with the Communist Party of Romania (PCdR). Thus, the Bucharest section successfully ran in the 1925 local elections on a common list with the Peasant Workers' Bloc, a front organization of the PCdR ‚Äì the latter having been banned by the Romanian government in 1924. The transformation of the FPSR into the Social Democratic Party of Romania (PSDR) in 1927 however meant the loss of PS‚Äôs autonomy, with decisions on electoral alliances falling within the competence of the national leadership. Foundation During early 1928, the PSDR decision to run on a common platform with the centre-left National Peasants' Party (PN≈¢) against the ruling National Liberal Party (PNL), and its ban on local collaboration with communist-influenced organisations, resulted in tensions between the central leadership and the Bucharest section. After calls to subordination issued in March‚ÄìApril were ignored, the direct confrontation that took place in May between Lothar RƒÉdƒÉceanu, Ilie Moscovici, and Ioan Fluera≈ü, representing the Executive Committee, on one side, and the local leaders , ≈ûtefan Voitec, Vasile Anagnoste, and , on the other side, only served to heighten the conflict. Consequently, the Executive Committee dissolved the leadership of the Bucharest section at the end of May. Furthermore, Ghelerter, himself a member of the Executive Committee, was expelled from the PSDR in July, accused of criticising the alliance with the Peasants' Party as well as protecting and encouraging communist elements within his section. On July 15, 1928, a day after the PSDR appointed a new leadership for its Bucharest section, Ghelerter called on a meeting of his supporters. In the presence of a large number of former members of the section, as well as representatives from major industrial centres from the Old Kingdom, the meeting adopted a manifesto authored by Ghelerter, Voitec and Petre Zissu. The manifesto announced the creation of the Socialist Workers' Party as a party dedicated to social revolution, opposed to any collaboration with bourgeois parties, seen as supporters of the class-based society. Affirming its commitment to class struggle, it called on the peasantry to follow the lead of the working class in its struggle with capitalism, whose foremost representative in Romania was considered the National Liberal Party. The document further condemned PSDR's collaboration with the Peasants' Party, and criticised its position asserting social revolution would be possible in Romania only after the success of socialism in Western Europe. At the same meeting, a Committee of the Bucharest section was elected and tasked to work with militants from Ploie≈üti, Gala≈£i, C√¢mpina, and Boto≈üani towards calling a country-wide Congress. Activities Expressing its adherence to Marxist doctrines, the PSMR called for peace between Romania and the Soviet Union. As the world financial crisis of 1929 wreaked havoc, the party argued that the time was ripe for revolution. It also called for end to censorship and repression and advocated salary increases, collective bargaining agreements and the 8 hour working day. Moreover, it favoured land reform, expropriating lands from large landowners without compensation. The party slowly expanded its territorial base, already at the end of July 1928 enrolling the support of groups of workers from Gala≈£i, Ia≈üi and Ploie≈üti. Nevertheless, it was never able to establish a significant presence in the territories incorporated in Romania in the aftermath of World War I. For most of its existence, its main strongholds were Bucharest and the Prahova Valley, an important industrial region in southern Romania. Soon after foundation, the PSMR was also joined by other important figures from the PSDR, the Peasant Workers' Bloc and the local trade unions, such as Constantin MƒÉnescu, Dumitru GƒÉnescu or Iancu Iliescu. The party was led by a Central Executive Committee. Litman Ghelerter served as the chairman of the party. »òtefan Voitec was the secretary of the party. Other key leaders of the party included Zaharia TƒÉnase, Vasile Anagnoste, C. MƒÉnescu and Mihail Moraru. Geographically the party was divided in county-level federations, each consisting of a number of local sections. The party organized a number of independent trade unions. In 1929 the party joined the Paris-based International Bureau of Revolutionary Socialist Parties. The central organ of the party was the newspaper Proletarul, which began publishing on July 29, 1928. In preparation for the 1928 general election, the PSM extended an official invitation for cooperation to the Peasant Workers' Bloc, calling for the creation of a united front. Some of the party's leaders were ready to accept the Bloc's programme, however the latter required that they publicly repudiate the PSM as \\"centrist\\" and \\"social democratic\\". Despite its claimed independence, the decision of the communist-dominated Bloc to forego an alliance with the socialists mirrored the Comintern ban on collaboration with social-democrats imposed on the French and English communist parties, instituted in February 1928. Nevertheless, the PSM decided not to designate candidates, and called on supporters to vote for the Bloc's list. During the campaign, the party called for unification of the trade union movement. With its campaigning severely curtailed by the PN≈¢-led government, the socialists- supported Bloc was only able to obtain 1.4% of the national vote. In contrast, the PN≈¢ in alliance with the PSDR obtained 77.76%, resulting in 9 MP seats for the Social-Democrats. After the Bloc refused another alliance offer, the PSMR, unable to raise sufficient funds, decided not to participate in the local elections of 1930, calling the workers to cancel their vote by writing \\"Down with the terror! Long live Bujor! Long live Socialism!\\" on their ballot. PSMR held a conference in C√¢mpina September 26‚Äì27, 1931, at which the name of the party was changed to the Independent Socialist Party of Romania (P.S.I.R). On August 24, 1933 PSIR merged with the Socialist Party of Romania (C. Popovici), a splinter group of Social Democratic Party, forming the United Socialist Party.

Chinese lineage associations, also kinship or ancestral associations ( or ), are a type of social relationship institutions found in Han Chinese ethnic groups and the fundamental unit of Chinese ancestral religion. They gather people who share the same surname belonging to the same kin, who often have the same geographical origin (ancestral home), and therefore the same patron deities. They aren't seen as distinct from the Chinese kin itself, but rather as its corporate form. These institutions and their corporeal manifestations are also known as lineage churches or kinship churches (ÂÆóÊóèÂ†Ç z≈çngz√∫ t√°ng), or, mostly on the scholarly level, as Confucian churches,Scholar of Chinese traditional religion Liyong Dai uses the term \\"Confucclesia\\", \\"Confucian church\\". although this term has principally other different meanings. They provide guanxi (social network) to members and they build and manage ancestral shrines or temples dedicated to the worship of the progenitors of the kins as their congregational centers, where they perform rites of unity.Watson, 1982. pp. 595-597 A lineage is a corporation, in the sense that members feel to belong to the same body, are highly conscious of their group identity, and derive benefits from jointly owned property and shared resources.Watson, 1982. p. 594 Benefit derives from the surplus income of ancestral shrines and homes, which is reinvested by the managers or shared out in yearly dividends.Watson, 1982. p. 600 Benefit of belonging to a lineage can also be measured in terms of protection and patronage. Ancestral temples also support local schools and engage in charitable work.Watson, 1982. pp. 601-602 Different lineages may develop through the opposite processes of fusion and segmentation.Watson, 1982. pp. 604-609 They can also be dispersed and fragmented into \\"multi- lineage areas\\" or concentrated in one place, or \\"single-lineage area\\".

Three female Ahmadis were killed, including an eight-month-old and a seven-year-old girl. The attack was sparked by a Facebook post. Background The Ahmadiyya movement was started in 1889 and follows the teachings of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who they believe was sent by God as a prophet and the Promised Messiah and Imam Mehdi prophesied in Islam \\"to end religious wars, condemn bloodshed and re-institute morality, justice and peace.\\" It is estimated there are between 3 and 4 million Ahmadis in Pakistan. The Ahmadiyya Muslims have previously been targeted by Sunni groups, while they have also suffered discrimination in Pakistan in the past, most significantly during the Lahore riots of 1953. They were declared non- Muslim in Pakistan in 1973 by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and were legally banned from identifying themselves as such in 1984 during General Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization as per Ordinance XX, despite Ahmadis calling themselves Muslim and following the rituals of Islam. Incident On 27 July 2014, extremists gathered outside a number of Ahmadi Muslim homes in Gujranwala in order to protest after an Ahmadi Muslim was falsely accused of posting blasphemous material of the Ka'ba on the social networking site Facebook. Soon the protest took the shape of violence and the homes of Ahmadi Muslims were burnt, ransacked and looted. At the same time, the extremists obstructed the fire brigades and ambulances. Eight homes belonging to the Ahmadi Muslims were burnt down. In total three female Ahmadi Muslims including an eight-month and a seven-year-old girl died due to suffocation. Another seventh month pregnant woman suffered a miscarriage. Moreover, eight Ahmadi Muslims suffered injuries and were treated for burns at a nearby hospital. Although the police were present, they did little to stop the violence.

Life Hymers was born 20 July 1803 at Ormesby in Yorkshire; his father was a farmer, and his mother was daughter of John Parrington, rector of Skelton in Cleveland. After attending school at Witton-le-Wear, Durham, and Sedbergh School, he gained a sizarship at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1822. Graduating B.A. in 1826 as second wrangler, he was elected fellow in 1827. Hymers was for some years successful with private pupils, and became assistant tutor of his college in 1829, tutor in 1832, senior fellow in 1838, president in 1848. He was moderator in the mathematical tripos 1833‚Äì4, and Lady Margaret preacher in 1841. He proceeded to BD in 1836 and DD in 1841, and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society 31 May 1838. Hymers had a portrait of William Wordsworth, to whom he was distantly related, painted by Henry William Pickersgill for his college. He later presented to its library some of the poet's manuscripts, including a sonnet addressed to the picture. Hymers never married. In 1852 he was presented by his college to the rectory of Brandesburton in Holderness, East Yorkshire, and spent there the last 35 years of his life. He was appointed Justice of the Peace for the East Riding in 1857, and enjoyed good health until his death on 7 April 1887. He is buried in a clearly identified plot near the south-west gate of the churchyard at Brandesburton. Legacy - The Foundation of Hymers College By his will of 24 August 1885, Hymers bequeathed all his property to the mayor and corporation of Kingston upon Hull as a foundation for a grammar school \\"to train intelligence in whatever rank it may be found amongst the population of the town and port\\". An infelicity in the wording of the will rendered the bequest invalid under the successor Acts to the mediaeval Statute of Mortmain, but his brother Robert, the heir-at-law, offered the corporation a sum of ¬£40,000 (subsequently increased to ¬£50,000) to fulfil his brother's purpose.F.W.Scott, A. Sutton & N.J.King (edd.) Hymers College: The First Hundred years (Beverley 1992): 11-16 Hymers College opened a few years later, in 1893. Works Hymers's books, with one exception, were mathematical, and were influenced by the mathematics of continental Europe. The major ones were: * Treatise on the Analytical Geometry of Three Dimensions, and of Curves of Double Curvature, 1830. * Integral Calculus which in the second edition (1835) introduced the subject of elliptic functions. * Treatise on Conic Sections and the Theory of Plane Curves, introducing the new Method of Abridged Notation, 1837, which became a standard text-book. * Theory of Equations, 1837; third edition, 1858. * Differential Equations and the Calculus of Finite Differences, Cambridge, 1839. * Treatise on Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, 1847. Hymers issued a revised edition of Watkin Maddy's Treatise on Astronomy. He also reprinted John Fisher's funeral sermon on Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, and founder of St John's College, Cambridge and Christ's College, Cambridge, with notes to illustrate \\"her munificent patronage of religion and learning\\", and published catalogues of the Lady Margaret professors and preachers at Cambridge and Oxford.

She made her international debut at the 1993 World Championships in Athletics, failing to progress beyond the heats. On September 8, 1993, while still a 17-year-old, she set the world youth best in the 800 metres at 1:57.18 minutes while qualifying for the final at the Chinese national games. That meet has been an anomaly amongst athletics records due to the freakish string of records set by Chinese women during the meet. The following day, Wang ran 1:58.16 to finish fifth in the final behind the still standing Asian record 1:55.54 set by Liu Dong (who had won the World Championship a month earlier). Two days after that, Wang ran in the 1500 metres final, finishing in seventh place, but again her time of 3:59.81 was another world youth best, bettering the record of 4:01.79 she had set in qualifying. In two races, Wang took more than six seconds out of the previous record. That race was won by Qu Yunxia (who had won the 3000 metres at the world championships a month earlier), in a world record of 3:50.46 that lasted almost 22 years. Ahead of her in that race was also Wang Junxia (the world champion at 10,000 metres a month earlier) running the second fastest time to that point in time. Wang Junxia also set world records in the 3000 and 10000 at that meet. In all, eleven Asian records were set in that one meet by the Chinese women, three of them were world records. The records survived over two decades later, six Asian records survive and one of the world records. For the records that were surpassed and the closest challenge to the ones who survived came at the same meet four years later. Yet none of the athletes from the 1993 meeting repeated in 1997. Even though most of the women were in their teens or early 20s, only Wang Junxia made it to the 1996 Olympics (where she picked up a gold and silver medal). Wang and virtually all the others disappeared and never produced notable results after 1994. Most of the distance runners were coached by Ma Junren who was suspected of doping his athletes. While charges were never brought against Ma, Wang Junxia dropped him as her coach before she went to the Olympics. Six of his athletes failed blood tests. But it was Ma Junren's group of women who in 1997 produced Jiang Bo setting the world record in the 5000 metres and just missing Qu Yunxia's world record in the 1500, Dong Yanmei chasing Bo to the record, Li Jing setting the still standing Youth best at 400 metres and Lang Yinglai setting the still standing world junior record in the 1500. Just behind Yinglai was Zhang Ling who took more than four seconds off Wang's record in qualifying and another in the final to take the record to 3:54.52. Also in 1997, Lin Na equalled Wang's 1:58.16 as the second best performance ever, but Wang's Youth best still stands, and Lin was the only girl to come within two seconds of the mark.

Banyumasan region is a mixture of Javanese and Sundanese culture. At approximately ¬±15 million people, they are concentrated in Banyumas, Majenang, Cilacap, Gombong, Kebumen, Banjarnegara, Purbalingga, Purwokerto, Bumiayu, Slawi, Pemalang, Tegal, and Brebes regencies. The Banyumasan speak Banyumasan language, a dialect which is often called \\"basa ngapak-ngapak\\". History = Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms era = In the first era of Hindu-Buddhist in Indonesia, Banyumasan region divided into Tarumanagara Kingdom's influence in the west and Kalingga Kingdom's influence in the east with Cipamali river or \\"Kali Brebes\\" as natural borders. The other Hindu-Buddhist Kingdoms that influenced this region is Galuh Kingdom, Medang Kingdom, Kediri Kingdom, Singhasari Kingdom and Majapahit Empire. After the decline of Majapahit, Banyumasan region become part of Demak Sultanate. = End of Demak Sultanate until rise of Mataram = In Demak Sultanate era (1478‚Äì1546), Banyumasan region divided into several Kadipaten, which is Pasirluhur with its Adipati (Duke) Banyak Belanak, also Kadipaten Wirasaba with its Adipati Wargo Utomo I. Due to the territories extent of Demak Sultanate that make Sultan Trenggono (Third Sultan of Demak) consider that a strong military was needed, for that he divided Demak territories militarily into the area of military command. For Western region, Sultan Trenggono choose Adipati Banyak Belanak as a western territory military commander which includes region of Kerawang to Sumbing mountain (Wonosobo). As a military commander of Demak Sultanate, Adipati Pasirluhur was given a title Pangeran Senopati Mangkubumi I while his younger brother named Wirakencana became a Patih (General). After the death of Sultan Trenggono, Demak Sultanate split into 3 sections, one of them is Pajang that ruled by Joko Tingkir with his title Sultan Adiwijaya (1546‚Äì1587). In this era, most of Banyumasan region become part of Pajang territory. Following his predecessor's rule, Sultan Adiwijaya also choose Adipati Pasirluhur which at that time being held by Wirakencana, became Senopati Pajang with the title Pangeran Mangkubumi II. Meanwhile, the Adipati of Kadipaten Wirasaba, Wargo Utomo I died and one of his sons named R. Joko Kaiman was chosen by Sultan Adiwijaya became Adipati of Wirasaba with the title Wargo Utomo II, he became 7th Adipati of Wirasaba. At the end of Pajang Kingdom's golden era and rise of Mataram Kingdom (1587), Adipati Wargo Utomo II gives his territory of Kadipaten Wirasaba to his brothers, meanwhile he himself created a new Kadipaten and named it Kadipaten Banyumas then he became first Adipati with the title Adipati Marapat. And then, this Kadipaten of Banyumas growing rapidly, even after the center of this Kadipaten were transferred to Sudagaran - Banyumas, due to its influences, other Kadipatens became smaller. Along with the growing of Mataram Sultanate, Many Kadipatens in Banyumasan became under Mataram rule. Mataram rule over Kadipatens in Banyumasan region did not automatically annexed Banyumasan region into \\"inner circle\\" of Mataram power which makes Kadipatens in Banyumasan region still have autonomy and Mataram people also considered Banyumasan region as M√•nc√•n√™g√•r√• Kul√≤n region, and the people are often called W√≤ng (m)Banyumasan.

Banyumasan people speak Banyumasan language, a dialect (or variety?) of Javanese. The language were still retaining some of Old Javanese loanwords. Banyumasan did not replace the word \\"a\\" with \\"o\\" just like standard Javanese do. It is notable for its great number of nearly ubiquitous Sanskrit loans, found especially in literary Javanese.

In a public poll held circa-1990, approximately 12% of Javanese used Indonesian, around 18% used both Javanese and Indonesian, and the rest used Javanese exclusively. In some areas especially in northern Cilacap and southern Brebes, Banyumasan people are able to speak Sundanese, due to the historical influence from the neighboring eastern Priangan region and the influx of Sundanese people migrated eastward and married the local people.

Best known for their 50-tonne \\"Spider\\", they rework ex military machinery and industrial components into installations and 360 degree arenas, following a transformational and environmental ethos. History Arcadia was founded by Pip Rush (who previously worked alongside his brother, artist Joe Rush, at the Mutoid Waste Company) and Bert Cole, formerly master of the world‚Äôs largest tent, the Valhalla. Their first collaboration, the Afterburner, debuted at the Glastonbury Festival in 2007 after being built in a cowshed. Subsequent years saw the Afterburner's refinement until 2010 when 3 Customs and Excise scanning units were attached as \\"legs\\". This first incarnation of the ‚ÄòSpider‚Äô led to two more years of adjustments until they became separate installations in permanent form. Arcadia's installations are built from recycled materials and military equipment Arcadia have developed a series of mechanical landscapes and performance-based shows between 2007 and the present, collaborated with New Zealander Carlos van Camp to form the Lords of Lightning and built the mobile Bug Stage which appeared at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Paralympics. In 2014, Arcadia were given a permanent area at the Glastonbury Festival and Arcadia perform with the Spider in Bangkok, Thailand. The Afterburner traveled to New Zealand for New Year's Eve at the Rhythm and Vines Festival before travelling to Miami's Ultra Music Festival in March 2015 as part of its new \\"Resistance\\" area. In September 2015, Arcadia performed to 24,000 people over 2 nights in Bristol's Queen Square. This event that also celebrated Bristol's year as European Green Capital featured the world's first pyrotechnic flame system run entirely on recycled biofuel. In March 2016, Arcadia returned to Ultra's Resistance area with the Spider, and autumn 2016 saw city shows in Seoul, Taipei and Perth where they collaborated with the Noongar tribe of Western Australia. In 2018, they registered an Instagram account, and successfully obtained the deletion of another user account of the same name which had been registered since 2010. In 2019, Arcadia launched Pangea at the Glastonbury festival, a new area centered around a re-purposed 140 ton dock crane previously installed at Avonmouth port in Bristol. The crane's ultimate purpose is the development of a new hemispherical stage concept to 'take over the sky' above audiences. Areas and performances Pangea - Pangea is a 360 degree hemispherical stage that will evolve over five years at the Glastonbury festival with a re-purposed 140 tonne dock crane at its heart The Spider The Spider is a 360 degree structure built from recycled materials. Its ‚Äòlegs‚Äô are Customs and Excise scanning units, its ‚Äòeyes‚Äô are spy plane engines, its ‚Äòclaws‚Äô are log grabbers, its ‚Äòbody‚Äô is built from helicopter tails and its DJ booth from jet engine blades. The DJ booth is suspended above the dancefloor. The Spider has several built in flame cannons, able to shoot 50 foot flames and is rigged across its ‚Äòbody‚Äô with lights and lasers. Its ‚Äòarms‚Äô fire jets of C02, it is often given a ‚Äòskin‚Äô by video mapping and it is surrounded by a 360 degree ‚Äòsoundfield‚Äô of PA speakers, often in a circle designated by flaming Victorian lampposts. Metamorphosis Show The Metamorphosis Show is anchored in themes of transformation and incorporated both into the architecture of the Spider and across the arena with podiums in the midst of the crowd and a ring of external towers. The show features aerial performances, 7 meter mini spiders on zip wires above the crowd, lighting played as a musical instrument, new LED mapping technology, pyrotechnics, hydraulics, robotics, engineering and video mapping to tell a story of metamorphosis. The Afterburner The Afterburner is a 360 degree structure built from recycled materials. Its central focus is a flaming spire with multi level, radial platforms extending to a 360 degree inward facing sound system. The Bug The Bug is a 6 wheeled, amphibious stage built from submarine moulds and an Alvis Stalwart. Lords of Lightning A collaboration with New Zealander Carlos van Camp, a specialist in Tesla electricity. The Lords of Lightning features two performance artists atop podiums containing Tesla coils that generate 4 million volts of electricity. The new Metamorphosis show has seen an evolution of the technology synchronise lightning bolts to musical notes. Flaming Lampposts A series of Victorian style lampposts entwined with recycled vehicle exhausts that give a treelike appearance. The lampposts are rigged with flame canons that emit jets of fire which are often synchronized with musical beats.

Early life Lionel Fraser was born in London, the second of four children of Scotsman Harry Fraser and Alice Barnard. Harry Fraser was butler to Harry Gordon Selfridge, the founder of the Selfridges department store chain. Lionel Fraser attended St Mary Abbots higher grade church school in Kensington, London, but he also attended other schools from time to time, as his parents moved around the UK for work. Aged thirteen, Fraser received a scholarship to attend Pitman's School, which was where he received intensive training in French, German, Spanish, as well as in shorthand, typing, and accounts. Career In June 1911 at the age of sixteen, Fraser joined Bonn & Co, a small bank specializing in foreign exchange transactions. There he was responsible for correspondence and bookkeeping. Fraser's business career was interrupted when his territorial regiment mobilized on the outbreak of war in 1914. Although commissioned as an officer in 1915, Fraser had to leave his regiment due to an injury suffered in a football match. During the remainder of the war Fraser worked in naval intelligence. By the time World War II started, Fraser had worked his way up to numerous business leadership roles on a national scale. During the war, he traded foreign currency while serving as an advisor to the UK Treasury. He became a director of Thomas Tilling, Tube Investments and Babcock, and chairman of the merchant bank Herbert Wagg. Other titles included Chelsea Borough Councillor, Trustee of the Tate Gallery, Liveryman of the Fishmongers' Company, and member of White's. In 1963, he published his memoirs, All to the Good. Personal life In 1931, he married Cynthia Elizabeth Walter. They had two sons and a daughter. Both sons went to Eton: the elder Nicholas Fraser, who went on to a very successful career in the City, and the younger, Robert Fraser. As an adult, Robert became known as \\"Groovy Bob\\" because he was so well-connected to the leading figures in Swinging London in the 1960s. Their daughter, Janet, along with her fianc√©, Richard Proby, was killed in a car accident on 14 March 1960. Fraser was a devout Christian Scientist. He died on 2 January 1965 of bronchial pneumonia and cancer at his home, 30 Charles Street, London. His memorial service was held on 19 January 1965 at the Church of St Botolph without Bishopsgate in the City of London.

He is the founder and chief promoter of Melam Group Of Companies and the Melam Foundation. He may be the only personality in India who ventured into business to raise funds to provide free medical treatment to poor and needy patients. With his own generated funds, he has already provided free medical treatment to over 1,54,000 poor patients through 1050 hospitals He was honoured by the Government of India, in 2010, for his services to the social cause, with the fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri. Background Kurian John Melamparambil was born on 14 May 1954 as the second son of Late M.V John (Kunju Kunju) and Leelamma into the 'Melamparambil', a traditional business family of Tiruvalla, a central Kerala town in Pathanamthitta. His early childhood and schooling days, both primary and senior level, were at M.G.M High School, Tiruvalla where he spent time with the family members and imbibed great values from the family elders. After schooling, he joined Pre-degree course in Mar Thoma College(1970‚Äì72) and from Mar Ivanios College, Thiruvananthapuram he completed his Graduation and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree majoring in Economics (1972‚Äì75).He then moved to the Indore School of Social Work, Indore and completed his Post Graduate Degreein social work (MSW)in 1978. After his Post Graduation, he joined as the Head of personnel & Administration division in the Cochin unit of Malayala Manorama the largest Malayalam daily. Kurian John Melamparambil's father, M.V. John's death due to a Cardiac Arrest made him stop, think and realize the value of life. As it was a Sunday, his family could not give his father the kind of treatment, which could have perhaps saved him. On May 28, 1978, in the prime of his youth, the sudden and shocking demise of his father shook his life. His father died soon after he had the attack. The dying man's last words were, \\"Oh God free me from this pain\\". These last words of his father made a lasting impression on his son, Kurian John Melamparambil.. These last words of his father made a lasting impression on his son, Kurian John Melamparambil. The loss of a father, friend and guiding figure for him was the beginning of the thought process that led to his humanitarian activities. His helplessness in not being able to do anything that could stop his father's untimely death made him think of ways by which he could help in preventing others from suffering a similar fate or loss. This idea that was born in that tragic moment lingered in his thoughts and laid the foundation for the starting of a noble venture. On 10 September 1986, Kurian John Melamparambil formally started the Melamparambil Varghese John Memorial Charities (M.V.J.M. Charities) named after his father, late Sri. M.V.

He may be the only humanitarian cum industrialist who sits along with his wife and two daughters to personally meet each and every patient/relatives, however large the turnout is.

McCammon. It was first published on May 13, 1983 through Holt, Rinehart & Winston and follows Billy Creekmore, a young boy capable of seeing and exorcising spirits.  Plot  The Mystery Walk, the voyage through life to determine your place and purpose, is something we all undertake. For Billy Creekmore, it is something more for he is gifted with the power to help distressed souls pass into the afterlife. He must learn how to use his gift. Billy learns early in life that he is something special. A fire rips through the home of one of his friends when he is a young kid. He learns that his friend and his whole family were murdered by the father. Billy is drawn to the home to discover his friend's body, secretly hidden under a coal pile in the basement. His friend's soul begs him to let people know where he is. Billy lives in rural Hawthorne, Alabama with his devoutly Christian father and a mother who is a Choctaw Indian. His mother and grandmother before him are gifted with this power and have found ways to use it. His father hates it and hates that his son has it. But, he loves his wife and son the best he can. Billy will not be without adversaries on his Mystery Walk. There is Little Wayne Falconer, the son and heir apparent to the south's most popular tent evangelist who hates the Creekmore's and the powers he regards as evil. There is also a serpent-like apparition that haunts Billy and inspires others to evil ‚Äì including the father of his friend who murdered his family. Wayne Falconer has his own Mystery Walk to undertake. He is the same age as Billy and his father has brought him into his ministry. As a young child, Wayne brought back from death his beloved dog by laying hands on him. Convinced that his son has the healing gift, JJ Falconer takes Wayne on the road to heal the faithful. But Wayne has his doubts. One evening the Falconer Crusade stops in Hawthorne and the Creekmore family attends. Billy and his mother see Little Wayne Falconer healing the sick. Billy and his mother notice the black clouds that portend death hover over the sick who approach Falconer and do not dissipate when Wayne ‚Äúheals‚Äù them. Billy's mother stands up and protests and the Creekmore family is thrown out of the revival. This is when the Creekmore family shows up on JJ Falconer's radar and his need to destroy them develops. The story then follows Billy and Wayne through their lives into their teens. Billy is called upon by the owner of a local saw mill to dispel the spirit of a man who died horribly in an accident with a saw. He does the task. But instead of earning the appreciation of the owner and community, Billy earns scorn and derision from the local Christians. Meanwhile, Wayne finds himself increasingly the star attraction of his father's growing ministry. Both desire something resembling a normal life and both make a single effort that shows how that will be impossible. Billy attends a high school dance at his local school where he is shunned. At a bonfire, someone has stuffed hundreds of fireworks in the stack of wood. It explodes and some kids are killed; others are badly injured. Billy, who is injured goes to the hospital where he and his family are shunned. The Falconers show up and are greeted with pleas from the parents to have Wayne heal their injured children. Ramona Creekmore intervenes and asks Wayne, ‚ÄúSon, do you even know what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù The Creekmores are run out of the hospital. Wayne attends a party one evening where teenagers are drinking and partying. He meets a girl who is obviously desperate to have sex with him. Wayne battles between his natural lust and his acquired faith with his faith ultimately winning. When he spurns the girl, she gets upset and mocks him. He picks up a stick and strikes her in the head. She falls into the water and disappears. One evening, shortly after the fireworks incident, things come to a head in Hawthorne for the Creekmores. The Ku Klux Klan ‚Äì of whom Billy's father is a member ‚Äì shows up and tells John Creekmore that he is still welcome to stay in Hawthorne, but his wife and son would have to leave. A fight ensues and several Klansmen and Billy's father are injured. The Klan flees. But things will never be the same for the Creekmore family. John Creekmore has suffered brain injury and is mentally reduced. Income on their farm has all but ceased. Opportunity presents itself in the form of a carnival operator who offers Billy a job in his ‚ÄúDeath Show.‚Äù He will pay Billy well and Billy will be able to send money home from the road. Wayne's life is also dramatically changed when his father suffers a heart attack and dies. Wayne, still in his teens, is now the head of a multimillion-dollar television and multi-media evangelical operation. Unable to cope, he tries to heal his father's death at the funeral home unsuccessfully. Later, he is visited by his father's spirit (actually the serpent shape changer of Billy's nightmares) who encourages Wayne to take calmative drugs and to take the advice of the men who helped JJ. While out with the carnival, Billy encounters the shape shifter who has taken the shape of a dilapidated carnival ride that has injured many. A couple carnival workers are drawn irresistibly to this ride. One of them is the carnival's snake handler who lusts for the women with whom Billy has fallen in love with. He tries to kill Billy's girlfriend with a poisonous snake and is nearly successful. Billy finds the man and shoots him. He then finds the man who owns the mysterious ride and challenges him to a ride. Billy gets on and finds the souls of those injured and killed while riding it, setting them free, defeating the shape changer who leaves. Billy returns home after his father dies. His mother encourages him to visit an institute in Chicago that investigates paranormal activity. Billy travels to Chicago and moves into the institute. After intensive study, the institute's head says she believes Billy has powers, but that she cannot document them and therefore Billy is of no use to her. He must leave. As Billy is preparing to leave, there is a horrible fire at a Chicago flop house that kills several residents. He travels to the worst part of Chicago's south side to the hotel and invites the terrified souls still trapped in the hotel to come into him and set themselves free. As the ghosts rush at Billy, there is a television news crew nearby to capture the whole event on camera. Meanwhile, Wayne has attracted the attention of a west coast gangster who is a major germaphobe and an organized crime head. The man is eager to gain control of one of the ministry's record studios as well as gaining control of Wayne's healing powers to help with hypochondriac tendencies. Wayne's father comes to him in his sleep and tells him he must trust help from these people who will help Wayne build a new ministry in California and Mexico. Wayne becomes quite comfortable living in the California mansion. Meanwhile, his associates are worried about the fate of the ministry that is suffering from inattention. One of Wayne's associates leaves in disgust. The other is subjected to a test where his throat is cut and Wayne is forced to use his power to save him. The mobster, now convinced that Wayne can keep him safe from disease and injury, asks Wayne what it is he wants in exchange. Wayne says he wants the Creekmore woman and her son dead. Romona, now old and living alone, is taken out easily. But one day, one of JJ's old associates brings to California with him Wayne's mother who tells him that Wayne was not really JJ's son. JJ was unable to sire a child of his own and purchased one from a man in Hawthorne. Wayne knows that Billy is that other boy. Billy is kidnapped and taken to Mexico where he meets Wayne Falconer once again. While on a plane trip back from Mexico, the evil being takes over Wayne's body and forces the plane to crash. Wayne, Billy, and the evil gangster survive. The evil shapeshifter takes over the gangster's body and pursues them across the desert. They are able to escape it and the ultimate showdown between good, evil, and the misused finally convenes.

South African pride parades were historically used for political advocacy protesting against legal discrimination against LGBT people, and for the celebration of equality before the law after the apartheid era. They are increasingly used for political advocacy against LGBT hate crimes, such as the so-called corrective rape of lesbians in townships, and to remember victims thereof. Johannesburg Simon Nkoli speaking at the first pride parade in 1990 Soweto Pride 2012 participants protest against violence against lesbians with a \\"Dying for Justice\\" banner and T-shirts which read \\"Solidarity with women who speak out\\". Soweto Pride 2012 participants remember two lesbians who were raped and murdered. The Gay and Lesbian Organisation of the Witwatersrand (GLOW) was founded by gay anti-apartheid activist Simon Nkoli in 1988. The first South African pride parade was held towards the end of the apartheid era in Johannesburg on 13 October 1990, the first such event on the African continent. The first event attended by 800 people was initiated and organised by GLOW, and the crowd was addressed by Nkoli, Donn√© Rundle, Beverly Ditsie, Edwin Cameron and gay Dutch Reformed Church minister Hendrik Pretorius. In his speech, Nkoli said: Section Nine of the country's 1996 Constitution provides for equality and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation among other factors. Over time, the celebration factor came to overshadow the protest factor despite ongoing social issues. The 2012 parade was marred by a clash between activist participants and members of the Joburg Pride organising body, and the organising body disbanded in April 2013 due to internal conflict about whether the event should continue to be used for political advocacy. Two new committees were formed around May 2013. One of them was called \\"Johannesburg Pride\\" and would carry on the history of the oldest and largest LGBTQIA Pride in South Africa & (Africa), The other committee would organise a \\"Johannesburg People's Pride\\", which is \\"envisioned as an inclusive and explicitly political movement for social justice\\". As of June 2019, Johannesburg Pride is the largest Pride event in Africa.

Information Bulletin 99-1, September 1999. p. 31  Background  Cheeves was born in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, Scotland on May 16, 1820, son of James Cheves, a stonemason, and Elizabeth (Morrison) Cheves. Due to the poverty of his father and the ill health of his mother, Cheves was sent at an early age to live with his grandmother, and remained there until the age of eight; spent six more years with one uncle working on the farm and as a herdboy and occasionally attending the local schools; then two more years with another uncle, a farmer and small merchant. He left home for Aberdeen, and after many tribulations found employment in a counting house. Returning home, he was welcomed by the family he'd fled, but eventually resolved to emigrate to the United States. Having met one William Smith, a native Scotsman now resident in Pike Grove, Kenosha County, in the Wisconsin Territory who was home visiting friends and family, Cheves accepted Smith's offer of passage money to America, and a job once he arrived there. He traveled in company with three others: Margaret, a sister of William Smith; James Smith, his nephew; and James Duguid, a kinsman of Cheves. They sailed from Liverpool in April 1840, landed in New York City, and proceeded by land and lakeboat, arriving in Southport (now Kenosha) in the Wisconsin Territory, on June 1 of 1840. He worked for Smith until his debt was paid, and then briefly worked on the Illinois and Michigan Canal. In 1842 he move on to the lead mining district flourishing at and around Mineral Point, Wisconsin. There he worked in a brewery during the winters, while in the summers he worked washing copper ore. While working in the mining country, he became involved in the spontaneous defense of two British-born abolitionist speakers from a rowdy crowd, and developed a lifelong antipathy to slavery. The winter of 1844-45 he worked in a sawmill near Racine. In the spring of 1845 he purchased eighty acres of land in what was then the Town of Yorkville, where he took up the profession of farming. In June 1845, he married Elizabeth Smith of Pike Grove in Kenosha County, like himself a native of Scotland (born February 10, 1822).I do not know whether she was related to his benefactor and fellow countryman, William Smith They eventually had six children, two of whom died in infancy.  Public office and private business  In 1847 the town Yorkville was divided, and the Town of Norway (named after the homeland of many of its settlers) was split off from it. The new town had only nine legal voters, none of whom had previously held public office, and Cheves found himself elected town clerk, an office he held for three years. He was subsequently elected to the town board, holding office for three years, and chairman of the town board, thus ex officio a member of the county Board of Supervisors. Cheves had been known as a Free Soiler, and was elected to the legislature in the fall of 1855, from Racine County's 4th Assembly district, as a Republican Party succeeding fellow Republican Ebenezer Adams. He served one term, and was succeeded the following year by James Catton, another Republican. In the autumn of 1856 he was elected by the new party as clerk of the board of supervisors of Racine County, a position he held for two years. In the autumn of 1856 his barn, which contained all his crops and farming implements, burnt down with all its contents. During his term of office he speculated in personal loans, often to his profit; but also sustained reverses in that business, and in several years of expensive and vexatious litigation. In 1863 he was once again elected clerk of the board, a position which he held for four years more. He then purchased a soap and candle factory in Racine, which he conducted successfully for several years, as well as engaging in other branches of business (and continued to operate his rebuilt farm).\\"Patrick G.

It contains memorials to the South Africa (2nd Boer) War and Victoria Cross recipients as well as a commemorative plaque for the first recorded building in St Kilda. History In the early 1800s, the area was known as Custom House Reserve: Vol.1, P.24 or \\"Custom Reserve\\". In 1861, a bowling green was in use within the reserve, and a tall flagstaff where the council flew the British flag on \\"every high day, and holiday\\".: Vol.2, P.144 The forthcoming visit to Australia in 1868 of Prince Alfred, second son and fourth child of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha motivated the renaming of many sites including this square park in his honour. In 1867, St. Kilda Council accepted the offer from two local residents to erect \\"a flagstaff 100 feet high with gaff stays etc.\\": Vol.1, P.317 in the Custom House Reserve, to be called the Prince Alfred Flagstaff. Council also agreed to their request to rename the area as the \\"Alfred Reserve\\". The Prince's first set foot on Victorian soil at St. Kilda and the flagpole was dressed with St. George's Cross at the main, and ensign at gaff. In July 1868, the Victorian Lands and Survey authorities proclaimed a Crown Grant of \\"1 acre, 3 roods, 18 perches\\" \\"reserved for public purposes\\".: Vol.1, P.27 The park was thereafter called Prince Albert Square and often shortened to \\"Alfred Square\\".: Vol.1, P.60 In 1873, the Planting Committee of the St. Kilda Council recommended \\"that Alfred Square, occupying as it does such a commanding position on the Esplanade, be enclosed by a dwarf wall, surrounded by handsome iron palings, furnished with suitable gates, and that it be levelled, laid out, and planted.\\" The estimated cost of ¬£1,000 was too much for the council, and the work was not done. South Africa (2nd Boer) War Memorial South African Memorial In 1900, residents of St. Kilda held a \\"God's Speed\\" gathering in the St. Kilda Town Hall for the 77: Vol.2, P.238 young soldiers of St. Kilda who had enlisted in the Victorian Bushmen's Corps for service in the Second Boer War: Vol.2, P.237 fought in South Africa from 1899 to 1902. In 1905, St. Kilda Mayor called for a city memorial and ¬£250 was raised through fetes, subscriptions, and entertainments. The memorial was designed by Arthur Peck for no fee and Mitcham Tesselated Tile Co. won the tender to construct. The memorial is built in brick covered by faience work. The supporting angles are formed to represent the trunks of gum-trees, branching out into leaves and cones under the main cornice, and the roots are shown on a bold projection above the base. Above the main cornice is a cross of a deep golden colour, which stands out clearly from the green tone of the general mass of work. One panel shows the names of the seven soldiers from St. Kilda who died. Two other panels record the names of the 58 who fought the Empire's battles and returned. On the fourth panel is the figure of a soldier, dressed in Australian khaki, and facing the sea. Above the main column is a wrought-iron pillar, supported by brackets, enriched with shields ; and under the golden cross rests a finely executed wreath on each panel. The memorial was unveiled on 12 March 1905, by the Victorian Governor, Major-General Hon. Sir Reginald Arthur James Talbot, K.C.B. The Sixth Australian Regiment provided a guard of honour of 280 men and the St. Kilda Boys' Naval Brigade played \\"The Death of Nelson,\\" and the united choirs of All Saints, Holy Trinity and Christ Churches sang the \\"Old Hundredth,\\" and \\"God Save the King.\\" After the Governor's speech, he unloosened the Union Jack furled around the Memorial, and the eight buglers of the A.I.R. blew the \\"Last Post,\\" the soldiers' \\"Good Night! Good Night!\\".: Vol.2, P.239 Victoria Cross Monument Victoria Cross Monument In 1985, a monument named as the Victoria Cross Monument was erected and dedicated \\"In memory of all Australians who died in war so that we may have peace\\". The monument depicts a white sculpted figure of a soldier bearing a rifle above his head and was designed by Peter Schipperheyn. It lists Victoria Cross recipients from St Kilda including Albert Jacka on the right side and the titles of conflicts with numbers of St Kilda dead on the left side. Site or First Building in St. Kilda Site of First Building To the north of the square is a plaque embedded into volcanic rock erected by the City of St Kilda to commemorate the site of the first recorded building in St Kilda which it states to be a \\"stockman's hut erected circa 1840 by Captain Benjamin Baxter\\". In 1842, the first Government plan of the village of St. Kilda showed a hut at the south west corner of the reserve. This hut, the first recorded dwelling in St. Kilda, was likely to have been occupied by a stockman employed by George Thomas and John Enscoe, of the shipping agents, Thomas, Enscoe & James, who had a business at the corner of Flinders and Williams Street, Melbourne. The hut is likely to have been first built during Baxter's lease.

Description and history The Stelljes House stands in a rural area of southern Goshen, on the east side of NH 31. It is a -story wooden structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A brick chimney rises slightly off-center from the roof ridge. The main facade is asymmetrical, with a slightly off-center entrance, two sash windows to its left, and a three-section modern picture window to the right. A gable dormer projects from the rear roof face. An ell extends from the southern portion of the rear of the main block, with a porch in the corner joining the two blocks. The house was built about 1800, and is one of the oldest of Goshen's cluster of plank-frame houses. The framing is three-inch planking attached vertically to sills, which rests on a rubble and granite stone foundation. Dowels are attached horizontally to give this framing lateral stability. The front facade was probably originally five bays across.

KGaA is a German multinational manufacturer of pumps, valves with headquarters in Frankenthal (Pfalz), Germany. The KSB Group has sales and marketing organisations, manufacturing facilities, and service operations on all continents.  1896-1945  The mechanical engineer, Johannes Klein, received a patent in 1871 on the boiler feed apparatus he invented, and founded Frankenthaler Maschinen- & Armatur-Fabrik Klein, Schanzlin & Becker with Friedrich Schanzlin and Jakob Becker. From 1887 the company operated as an Aktiengesellschaft (public limited company) with Johannes Klein at its head. KSB‚Äôs first subsidiary outside Germany was founded in Great Britain in 1896, managed by Jacob Klein, the younger brother of Johannes Klein. Between 1924 and 1934 KSB acquired further plants in Germany and set up European subsidiaries. KSB Compa√±√≠a Sudamericana de Bombas in Argentina was KSB's first subsidiary in the Americas and commenced operations in 1941.

The companies of Pumpen AG (Homburg), Kleinschanzlin- Bestenbostel (Bremen) and AMAG-Hilpert-Pegnitzh√ºtte AG (Nuremberg/Pegnitz) were amalgamated into Klein, Schanzlin & Becker AG. In 1960 the KSB-Stiftung (KSB Foundation) was set up with stated aims of encouraging research in the natural sciences and supporting education in technology, natural science and economics. Otto Klein-K√ºhborth transferred a qualified majority holding of the company's share capital to the KSB-Stiftung (KSB Foundation) in 1964. KSB took over French pump manufacturer, Paris-based Pompes Guinard S.A., in 1986 and acquired the world‚Äôs second-largest butterfly valve manufacturer, Paris-based Amri S.A., Paris, in 1989. In 1988 KSB entered the slurry pumps market with the acquisition of GIW Industries, Inc., Grovetown, USA. In 1990 KSB consolidated the eastern German Hallesche Pumpenwerke GmbH as part of the overall AG. The joint venture KSB Shanghai Pumps Co. Ltd. was founded in 1994. MIL Controls Ltd., Mala (Kerala), India, producer of ANSI valves and control valves, was acquired years later. In 2003 KSB took over Dutch pump supplier DP industries B.V., producer of pumps made of deep-drawn stainless sheet steel for building services and industrial applications. In the same year, KSB acquired a majority interest in Bombas ITUR, S.A. of Zarautz, Spain, with sales in industry, building services and marine applications . KSB establishes Dalian KSB AMRI Valves Co. Ltd. in the Chinese foreign trade zone in 2004, specialising in the manufacture and assembly of butterfly valves for industrial and building services applications. One year later, KSB acquired the valve business of IVC S/A Ind√∫stria de V√°lvulas e Controles, a Brazilian company whose products are primarily employed in the oil and gas industry, in power stations, paper mills and other industrial applications. In 2006 KSB received an order for valves to the value of roughly ‚Ç¨17 million, its largest valves contract. In December 2006, the 60,000th Eta pump leaves the factory. In 2007 the Supervisory Board approves a large investment to construct of new halls and modern production and test facilities at the Frankenthal and Halle sites. KSB‚Äôs Microchem is the first centrifugal pump for handling the very small quantities in micro-process engineering applications. In 2008 KSB establishes joint ventures with two Asian companies. The German-Japanese cooperation Nikkiso-KSB GmbH develops and sells canned motor pumps for the European and Middle Eastern markets. The German-Chinese joint venture company Shanghai Electric-KSB Nuclear Pumps and Valves Co. manufactures safety- relevant pumps and valves for the Chinese nuclear power station market. The German-Chinese joint venture SEC-KSB Nuclear Pumps and Valves Co. Ltd. starts constructing a factory construction in Lingang, near Shanghai, in 2009. 125 employees produce pumps, and later valves, for Chinese nuclear power stations. In 2010 KSB acquired an 80 percent interest in ITACO s.r.l., an Italian drive specialist, producer of a new kind of energy-efficient motor. The South Korean company Seil Seres Co. Ltd. makes valves for marine applications.

These pumps, as well as valves, are sold to engineering contractors, OEMs and end users or, in some cases, distributed via dealers. The same applies to control and monitoring systems, and to package units with pumps and valves. The best developed sales market for these products is Europe, where KSB operates its main manufacturing facilities in Germany and France. KSB AG‚Äôs main plant in Frankenthal is its largest in Europe, ahead of the production sites in Pegnitz (Bavaria) and Halle (Saxony-Anhalt) in Germany, and La Roche- Chalais in France. The second-largest market for KSB products is the Region Asia, followed by the Region Americas/Oceania and the Region Middle East/Africa. Outside Europe, KSB‚Äôs biggest manufacturing plants are in Brazil, China, India and the USA. KSB manufactures products and components in a total of 16 countries; they are sold through the Group‚Äôs own companies or agencies in more than 100 countries. With their products, the Group companies serve customers in industry including the chemical and petrochemical industries, customers in the energy and construction/building services sectors, transport equipment manufacturers and operators (e.g. ships, rail vehicles), water and waste water utilities, and mining companies. Once again in 2015, the top- selling markets for our products were the industrial and energy supply sectors.

His debut solo album Folk Singer, Vol. I, was released in May 2014; its follow-up Folksinger, Vol. 2 was released September 15, 2017 on Acony Records. He has appeared at the Newport Folk Festival and other major music festivals. He currently resides in the Woodland Hills district of Los Angeles. Watson appears as The Kid in Joel and Ethan Coen's 2018 film The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, also performing on the soundtrack. Biography =Early= William Currie Watson was born in Watkins Glen, New York (Schuyler County), and raised there, in Upstate New York, around Ithaca. Growing up in the ‚Äò80s and ‚Äò90s, Watson listened to music on the radio ‚Äì from Michael Jackson to Nirvana ‚Äì but also his father's record albums, including The Rolling Stones and Neil Young. He recalls: He first met Ben Gould in high school and they began playing music together. Around Ithaca and next-door Tompkins County \\"a lot of old-time fiddle music\\" was being played, some of it by banjo player Richie Stearns and the group Donna The Buffalo. Watson was exposed to old-time music firsthand at a weekly old-time jam. Both Watson and Gould dropped out of school and formed the band The Funnest Game, which like Richie Stearns' group The Horse Flies had \\"clawhammer banjo, electric guitar, drums.\\" Their brand of electric/old-time was heavily influenced by the old- time scene prominent in Tompkins and Schuyler County, New York, including The Horse Flies and The Highwoods Stringband. Performing locally, the young band earned the respect of local musicians and gained a following, appearing weekly at the Rongovian Embassy with Richie Stearns and annually at the Finger Lakes GrassRoots Festival of Music and Dance in Trumansburg, New York. Future bandmate Ketch Secor described it as a \\"young folksy kind of jam element acoustic band that was really popular in the southern tier region of New York State.\\" Watson, he says, \\"was playing shows statewide by the time he was sixteen\\" with \\"this group that had some congas and some clawhammer banjo.\\" =Old Crow Medicine Show= Playing guitar with Old Crow Medicine Show at Golden Plains music festival in Australia March 8, 2009. Watson met future co- founder of Old Crow Medicine Show Ketch Secor after the latter finished high school in New Hampshire, his band broke up in Virginia, and he enrolled in Ithaca College. Secor brought friend and former bandmate Chris \\"Critter\\" Fuqua up to New York State from Virginia. Watson dissolved The Funnest Game while the three assembled musicians around Ithaca, New York \\"where there is a very lively old-time music scene.\\" According to Mac Benford, Ithaca had for 40 years \\"been a center of old time music, nationally,\\" including Kevin Hayes They recorded Trans:mission, a cassette of ten songs they could sell on the road. The group left Ithaca for their Trans:mission tour in October 1998, busking west across Canada. They circled back east in Spring of 1999 and moved into a farmhouse on Beech Mountain, near Boone, North Carolina. They were embraced by the Appalachian community, and their repertoire of old-time songs grew as they played with local musicians.\\" After being discovered busking in Boone, North Carolina by Doc Watson‚Äîwhile \\"playing on Doc's old corner\\" where he'd \\"started playing in the 1950s\\" on King Street ‚Äîthe famed folk-country legend said, \\"Boys, that was some of the most authentic old-time music I've heard in a long while. You almost got me crying.\\" Doc invited the band to participate in his annual MerleFest music festival, founded in 1988 in memory of Doc's son Eddy Merle Watson, who died in a farm tractor accident in 1985, as a fundraiser for Wilkes Community College and to celebrate \\"traditional plus\\" music. There they met Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings who introduced them to the Nashville music scene, where they promptly relocated. Watson performed with the group, writing and singing many of their more notable songs. He left to embark on a solo career in the autumn of 2011, a couple months before Fuqua rejoined the group, citing time on the road, new parenthood, and direction the band was headed as reasons for the split. =Solo career= Watson's transition to solo appearances began slowly with an invitation from siblings Sean and Sara Watkins to join them on a Cayamo cruise‚Äîa \\"singer-songwriter, folk, rootsy festival on a ship around the Bahamas.\\" Sean \\"took the liberty\\" of putting Watson on the performance schedule. He subsequently would \\"go pretty often and ... sing a few songs\\" at \\"this little revue called the Watkins Family Hour at Largo\\" where the Watkins would encourage him to try appearing solo. In 2012‚Äì2013 Watson began appearing in venues in and around Venice Beach, California, making appearances with the John C. Reilly band and John Prine, and opening for acts such as Punch Brothers, Sarah Jarosz, and Dawes. Initially he was performing original music, then realized he got more out of performing the old songs‚Äîand his audience seemed to enjoy them more. As he explains: In 2014, he performed at SXSW in Austin, Stagecoach Music Festival in Indio, California, Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island, Pickathon Music Festival in Oregon, Fayetteville Roots Festival in Arkansas, and Steelfest in Missouri. A tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland takes him to Bristol, Glasgow, Manchester, Sheffield, London, and Dublin. He appears at the Americana Music Festival in Nashville during September. Of his transition to a solo career, Watson says: In 2018, Willie made his film debut as \\"The Kid\\" in the Coen brothers film The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, and performed \\"When A Cowboy Trades His Spurs For Wings\\" on the film's soundtrack with Tim Blake Nelson. Folk Singer Vol. 1 Watson's debut solo album, Folk Singer Vol. 1, was released May 6, 2014 by Acony records. It was produced by David Rawlings, producer of Old Crow Medicine Show albums. The release features ten songs, from folk standards to \\"obscure gems.\\" As Watson himself describes it, Tour stops to promote the album release included dates at Nashville area's Music City Roots at the Loveless Caf√©, New York City's Mercury Lounge, Philadelphia's World Caf√© Live, and Berkeley's Freight & Salvage. Rolling Stone named the album one of The 26 Albums of 2014 You Probably Didn't But Really Should Hear, stating, \\"Watson's voice carries the weight of generations past, but on Folk Singer, it's still appropriate for the one we live in, right now.\\" Rawlings, who produced the album, said: \\"Willie is the only one of his generation who can make me forget these songs were ever sung before.\\"  Folk Singer Vol. 2  While at work on the second volume of Folk Singer, Watson stated: \\"Volume two will be a continuation of Volume one, and consist of old songs.\\" Released September 15, 2017, Folk Singer Vol. 2 was produced by David Rawlings and featured collaborations with Gillian Welch, The Fairfield Four, Morgan Jahnig of Old Crow Medicine Show, and Paul Kowert of Punch Brothers. In its review of the new album, The Guardian states nobody makes \\"the old songs sound fresher\\" than Watson, \\"thanks to a voice that's young but weathered, strong but eerie, and comes backed by intricate banjo and guitar picking.\\" = _Tracks_ = # Samson and Delilah (w/ The Fairfield Four) # Gallows Pole # When My Baby Left Me # Dry Bones # Walking Boss # On The Road Again (w/ The Fairfield Four) # The Cuckoo Bird # Always Lift Him Up And Never Knock Him Down # John Henry # Leavin' Blues # Take This Hammer (w/ The Fairfield Four) Watson says of \\"Samson and Delilah\\" by Reverend Gary Davis:  Films  Watson appeared as The Kid in the Coen brothers' The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018), performing in \\"When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings.\\" Written by his personal friends and professional colleagues Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, the song came about in an interesting way, as Welch explains: Coen also said, \\"They have to be able to sing it together. They have to be able to sing it once [the other character] has been shot and is dead and is floating up to heaven.\\" So it was meant to be a duet between singing cowboys, one of whom is dead. Watson performed on \\"Lazy Old Moon\\" for another Coen film, Hail, Caesar!, from 2016. He performed in \\"We'll Understand It Better By and By\\" for the Ben Affleck film Live by Night (2016).  Tours  Watson regularly tours solo and with other acts. In Summer 2016, he toured Australia with Josh Hedley for \\"a string of joint-headline shows throughout the east coast\\" of that country, including the Bello Winter Music Festival in Bellingen. The tour included stops in the major cities of Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney where regional \\"support\\" acts opened for them‚Äîe.g., Imogen Clark, Matt Walker, Freya Josephine Hollick, and Elwood Myre. In Fall of 2016, Watson toured with Aiofe O'Donovan, \\"captivating\\" lead singer of Boston progressive string band Crooked Still‚Äîwith stops in Ohio, North Carolina, and Virginia. Featured vocalist on The Goat Rodeo Sessions‚Äîa Grammy-winning album by Yo-Yo Ma, et al. ‚Äì O'Donovan released her debut solo album Fossils in 2013. Influences Watson started with his father's record collection, which included artists like Bob Dylan and Neil Young, as well as Lead Belly. He later discovered Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music ‚Äì which helped trigger the folk music revival in the 1950s and 1960s. The Ithaca-Tompkins County area played host to a number of old-time musicians, including banjo player Richie Stearns whose group The Horse Flies mixed old-time fiddle music with 1980s pop. Nirvana's Unplugged includes a take on Lead Belly songs \\"In the Pines/Where Did You Sleep Last Night.\\" Knowing his father had a Lead Belly record in the basement, Watson went and got it out. He says: \\"Really, that changed everything for me right there. It was all coming together at the same time.\\" After which followed the \\"alternative scene\\", like the Pixies and They Might Be Giants. Vocally, his first influence was Roy Orbison ‚Äì when he \\"was, like, 9\\" ‚Äì when Orbison had the comeback with \\"You Got It\\" and joined the Traveling Wilburys. And he was really into Neil Young, sitting up in his room singing Young songs in \\"that higher register.\\" When he eventually started listening to old-time and \\"mountain music,\\" he found that \\"singing up there, that high lonesome sound, sort of put a little more volume behind it.\\" All of these influences informed the style and substance he brings to traditional and old-time music. As Watson himself says of his songs:  Instruments  Watson performs on a Larriv√©e guitar and Gibson five-string banjo.

A member of the Petrashevsky Circle and later the leader of his own underground group of intellectuals, Durov was arrested in 1849, spent 8 months in the Petropavloskaya Fortress, followed by 4 years in Omsk prison. In 1857 Durov returned from Siberia, and the ban on his literary activity was lifted in 1862. But, broken physically by his long ordeal, he fell critically ill soon after and died at the age of 54. Biography Sergey Fyodorovich Durov was born in the Oryol Governorate in the family of a minor nobleman. His father, an army colonel, died in 1834 penniless and the boy's education in the Nobility Boarding school at the Saint Petersburg University (1828-1833) was paid by his uncle on mother side Nikolai Khmelnitsky, a well-known playwright of his time. In 1833-1847 Durov worked as a civil servant, then retired and made literature his profession. Most of Durov's works - poems, short stories and novellas, - were published in 1843-1849, before the arrest, mostly in almanacs, magazines and newspapers. In the late 1847 Durov started to attend regularly Petrashevsky's Fridays. Dissatisfied with what he saw as the chaotic nature of these meetings, he - along with Alexander Palm and A.D.Shchelkov - in the spring of 1849 organised his own underground circle, including brothers Fyodor and Mikhail Dostoyevsky, Aleksey Pleshcheyev, Nikolay Speshnev, Nikolai Grigoriev, P.N.Filippov, V.A. Golovinsky and F.N.Lvov. The social and economical situation in Russia was taken as the main issue. Among the documents read there was the banned Belinsky's Letter to Gogol, as well as \\"The Soldier Talk\\" (Soldatskaya beseda), the first ever document propagating the revolutionary ideas in the Russian army. Four of the circle members, Speshnev, Dostoyevsky, Filippov and Lvov, decided to organize the underground lithography. Durov disliked the idea and in April 1849 declared his 'evenings' closed. On April 23, 1849, Durov was arrested and spent 8 months in a single camera in the Petropavlovskaya Fortress. Along with the other Petrashevtsy he was taken to the parade ground of the Semionovsky Regiment in Saint Petersburg, and lined up for execution. At the last moment the execution was stopped and it was revealed that his sentence had been commuted to katorga. Durov was sent to Omsk in chains with Fyodor Dostoyevsky where they were to spend 8 years in a convict colony and the rest of his life as a soldier in Siberia. That sentence was reduced to 4 years as a Prisoner by Nicholas I. The sentence only commenced when the convicts entered the Prison at Omsk. Dostoyevsky wrote about his experience as a convict in Omsk in his novel Notes from the House of the Dead. After Durov's release he spent one year serving in the army as a soldier, then retired due to ill health and settled in Omsk. Having received the permission to leave Siberia, he went to Odessa and stayed at his friend Palm's house. There he died in 1869, after long illness. Legacy As a poet, Durov was noticed by Vissarion Belinsky who reviewed his \\"Molodik\\" poem (1844) positively, yet opined that the author was \\"notable more for his earnestness than talent.\\" Influenced by Lermontov, Baratynsky and Tyutchev, Durov, according to biographer O.Bogdanova, still left several \\"really exciting pieces, marked by fine sparseness, energy and tightness.\\" Durov translated many poems by Victor Hugo, Andr√© Marie de Ch√©nier, Lord Byron, Adam Mickiewicz and is credited with \\"being the first and, arguably, the best\\" Russian translator of Henri Auguste Barbier. As a short story writer, Durov was very much a \\"natural school\\" component, his sketches (with the exception of \\"The Auntie\\" and \\"Khalatnik\\") and novellas (\\"Somebody Else‚Äôs Child\\", \\"A Novel in Notes\\") were hardly original, according to biographer Bogdanova. While Sergey Durov's literary legacy is lean, the strength of his personality has made a deep impression upon the people who knew him, first and foremost Petrashevsky's cohorts (Pleshcheev, N.Grigoriev, A.P.Milyukov) and members of his own circle (Ch.Valikhanov, G.N.Potanin, Viktor Burenin and others). He became the prototype of Rudkovsky (in Alexander Palm's novel Alexey Slobodin), and Sornev (Pavel Kovalevsky's Life‚Äôs Summary). Several poets, including Pleshcheev dedicated poems to Sergey Durov.

She serves as one of the main characters throughout the first season, until her death at the hands of Oswald Cobblepot in the final episode of the season. Fish is resurrected in season 2 by Hugo Strange. As a result of the methods Strange used to bring Fish back to life, she has the ability to control people by touching them and is thus a metahuman, an ability she later sacrifices to continue living.  Development  Pinkett-Smith drew inspiration from various different individuals for taking on the role: the fictional character Norma Desmond from the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard, played by Gloria Swanson; and Griselda Blanco, a real-life drug lord of the Medell√≠n Cartel. Fictional character biography =Season 1= Fish Mooney is mob boss Carmine Falcone's most trusted lieutenant. Unbeknownst to Falcone, Fish is plotting to usurp his criminal empire, and employs a young woman named Liza, who resembles Falcone's late mother, to distract the lonely, aging mafia chieftain while Fish undermines his control of Gotham City. She has good relations with the Gotham City Police Department, and decides to help detective Harvey Bullock in investigating the murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne in return for him leaving her alone. When her underling Oswald Cobblepot informs on her to the GCPD, she hobbles him - giving him his trademark \\"penguin walk\\" - and orders him killed along with Bullock and his new partner, Jim Gordon. Falcone intervenes, however, and spares their lives. Cobblepot gradually works his way up the ladder of Gotham's underworld to become the right-hand man of both Falcone and his rival Sal Maroni, and gets revenge on Fish by revealing her treachery to Falcone. Hurt and angered by Fish's betrayal, Falcone has her and Butch tortured, however Butch escapes custody and frees Fish. Wanting revenge against Penguin, she goes to her former club to find him there and proceeds to beat him. Before she can do much harm she and Butch are pursued by Zsasz and his crew. Butch helps her escape while staying behind to fend them off to buy her time. Harvey meets up with her later that night and helps her flee from Gotham City. Exiled to the outskirts of Gotham, Fish takes control of another criminal gang that is being preyed upon by Francis Dulmacher, a mad scientist who is creating human monsters out of his victims' body parts. When Dulmacher captures her, she gouges out her own eye with a spoon so he can't use it in his experiments. By sacrificing some of the detainees, she uses the ensuing chaos to escape with the rest. In the last episode of the first season, \\"All Happy Families Are Alike\\", Fish recruits the young Selina Kyle into her gang, and makes an alliance with Maroni in order to get rid of Falcone. Fish captures Falcone, Cobblepot, Gordon and Bullock. Fish reveals Cobblepot's treachery to Maroni in exchange for an agreement to divide the city between them. When Maroni reveals that he intends to rule the city with Fish as his lieutenant and treats her with sexist condescension, Fish loses her temper and shoots him in the head. An all-out gang war ensues between Fish and Maroni's forces, during which Cobblepot fights her on a rooftop and pushes her into the river below. =Season 2= During the second season we see that Fish's corpse has been sent to Indian Hill, a scientific division of Wayne Enterprises run by Hugo Strange, who brings her back to life augmented with cuttlefish DNA. The side- effects of the revival gives Fish the ability to take control of anyone who comes in contact with her. She escapes and runs across Cobblepot, who since her death has taken over Gotham's criminal underworld as \\"The Penguin\\". Shocked, he passes out. = Season 3 = Soon after her rebirth, Fish starts going into rapid physical decline, and raids every pharmacy in Gotham for drugs to keep herself alive. She forms a new gang with her fellow Indian Hill escapees. She interrogates Strange's assistant Ethel Peabody, who tells her that her body is rejecting the cells Strange implanted in her, and that only Strange can save her. Fish has her fellow escapee Marv, who can accelerate or slow a person's metabolism, deplete the energy from Peabody's cells, literally stealing her life. Fish frees Strange, intent on making him create more mutants to do her bidding. By then, however, Cobblepot has amassed an angry mob of Gothamites bent on killing the mutants. When Cobblepot has her at his mercy, Fish says she is proud of having transformed him into \\"The Penguin\\". Moved, Cobblepot tells her to leave Gotham and never come back. Later, when Gotham is in chaos from the effects of a homicidal mania-inducing virus, Fish joins forces with Cobblepot and Strange to create an antidote and hold the city to ransom. An infected Gordon shows up and attacks Mooney, accidentally impaling her with a sword and destroying the antidote. With her dying breath, Fish tells Cobblepot to either take Gotham for his own or burn it to the ground. Powers and abilities After her resurrection by Hugo Strange near the end of season 2 of Gotham, Mooney develops the ability to control people with just a touch of her hand.

Description and history The Williamson House is located in a rural setting in northern Goshen, on the north side of a bend in Messer Road, about east of Nutting Road. It is a -story wooden house, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It is distinct in Goshen's cluster of plank-frame houses in its use of two-inch planking instead of the more typical three inches. The walls are further likely to be load-bearing, as the house lacks corner posts, and are pinned to the frame rather than the more typical mortise-and-tenon method seen in other such houses. The main block is five bays wide and four deep, with an attached ell that is four bays by three. The main facade has five irregularly spaced sash windows, with the main entrance located in the front of the ell, which is sheltered by a shed-roof porch. The house was built about 1850, probably for Isaac Messer, who is known to have lived here by 1860. The property remained in the Messer family until the 1940s.

Most of the workers, she notices, are unskilled Portuguese men who do not seem healthy, as they are prone to fainting.

Afterwards, while he is asleep, she roots through his files and discovers what she suspected. Attempting to leave, she finds her car sabotaged and the phone lines not working. Breaking into the laboratory, she finds Manoel's corpse partly harvested for serum.

This is allegedly why many news updates were released only after the TV teams left Gaza strip. NDTV published news that Hamas had fired from civilian areas. The reporter Gallagher Fenwick from FRANCE 24, used exclusive footage of a Hamas rocket to prove the militant group has been firing from populated areas. Israel's Channel 10 was hacked by Hamas with a message \\"Prepare for a drawn- out stay in bomb shelters\\", showing pictures of wounded civilians in Gaza.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4543596,00.htm Thousands of editors requested on Yonit Levi's Facebook page that she should be fired after she reported on, the deaths and casualties in Gaza, on Israel's Channel 2 Prime Time News. Many threats were so abusive that police had to conduct an investigation of them. In the Knesset Yariv Levin called for Gideon Levy, who had been the subject of numerous death threats, which required him to be protected by bodyguards, to be indicted for treason because his articles displayed empathy with Palestinians and were vocal in opposing the war. Eldad Yaniv on Facebook wrote \\"The late Gideon Levy: get used to it.\\" Friends recommended that he should leave the country for his own safety. Israeli-Arab Knesset member Haneen Zoabi controversially said that those who had murdered the three kidnapped Israeli teenagers were not terrorists but responding to the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Later she also became the victim of a death threat campaign and was confined to her home on security grounds. Criticism of coverage =Purported pro-Israel bias= In The Guardian, Owen Jones called the BBC's headline \\"Israel under renewed Hamas attack\\" [as] \\"perverse as Mike Tyson punching a toddler, followed by a headline claiming that the child spat at him\\", and that \\"the macabre truth is that Israeli life is deemed by the Western media to be worth more than a Palestinian life.\\" In London, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow, protesting demonstrators accused the BBC of \\"pro-Israeli bias\\" in its coverage of the ongoing conflict. It claimed that news coverage was \\"entirely devoid of context or background\\". An open letter to BBC director signed by 45,000 people including Noam Chomsky, John Pilger, Ken Loach, Brian Eno and Jeremy Hardy said it would \\"like to remind the BBC that Gaza is under Israeli occupation and siege [and] that Israel is bombing a refugee population\\". (Israel ended its occupation of Gaza in September 2005.) The BBC has defended its coverage. Building on research by the Glasgow University Media Group that examined the media coverage of recent Israeli attacks on Lebanon and Gaza, Greg Philo, research director of the university's media unit, described how senior BBC journalists have spoken to him about being unable to get the Palestinian viewpoint across. The organization, through a spokesperson, has said in response to criticism, \\"We cover stories based on how newsworthy they are, and what else is happening.\\" ABC News received criticism when Diane Sawyer misidentified photos of rubble in Gaza as being in Israel. The media criticism organization FAIR said that the mistake reflected the worldview in American media and a \\"false balance\\" between the two sides of the conflict, when in fact many more Palestinians have suffered than Israelis. Sawyer later apologized on-air for the error. British politician George Galloway said that \\"300 Palestinians are completely ignored by the same newspapers, by the same television stations and by the same political leaders who are threatening sanctions and war against Russia.... Why the double standard? Why is the blood in Ukraine so much more noteworthy than the blood in Gaza?\\" NBC News was criticized for ordering its correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin out of Gaza after witnessing the killing of four Palestinian children. He was later reinstated. NBC News stated that their deployments are constantly reassessed, but did not officially give a reason for his removal or reinstatement. =Purported anti- Israel bias= CAMERA, a pro-Israel media advocacy and lobbying body and its affiliates (including BBC Watch), criticized British and American news outlets, including The New York Times, CNN, The Guardian, Associated Press, The Washington Post, and the BBC, for an anti-Israel bias. It alleged factual errors, omissions, biased wording and anti-Semitism that led to Israel being portrayed in what it construed as an overly-negative light. Investigative reporter Judith Miller criticized US media, and her former employer The New York Times in particular, for being unsympathetic to Israel and downplaying the context of the kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers. Diplomat Dore Gold and his Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs think tank have been highly critical of international media coverage of the conflict, saying \\"The real truth about what transpired during the war was superseded by a highly subjective presentation that suited the Hamas interest, and which it skillfully sold to international opinion-makers.\\" In June 2015 the Israeli Foreign Ministry released a controversial cartoon video that mocked international media coverage of the conflict, claiming it was heavily biased against Israel. The Foreign Press Association in Jerusalem released a statement officially rebuking the video. Social media The ubiquity of social media in this conflict has in its immediacy changed how people understand war, given how it short circuits the traditional editorial process. There are more journalists on the ground than during the 2009 conflict, and what once could have been a remark made to a friend in bar can now be sent out on Twitter. In the eight days leading up to Operation Protective Edge, the social media site Twitter hashtag #GazaUnderAttack was used over 375,000 times. Often the hashtag was used on tweets using photos that claimed to show how people were suffering due to Israeli attacks. A BBC study showed that in some cases these photos were from previous Israeli attacks, or from wars in Syria and Iraq, with some images being recycled from as long ago as 2007. A false report was circulated on social media and via SMS that a rocket from Gaza had hit a petrochemical plant in Haifa. These reports cited Haaretz as their source but turned out to be false. Haaretz denied issuing such warnings. A photograph published by Danish journalist Allan S√∏rensen on Twitter caused uproar online, gathering more than 8,500 retweets. It showed Israelis in Sderot gathered on top of a hill to celebrate and cheer as they watched Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. People reportedly brought chairs, sofas, popcorn, and hookahs with them. The scene was described as \\"something resembling a party\\". Similarly, according to The Jerusalem Post, Palestinians in Hebron cheered as Gazan rockets were fired at Tel Aviv. People reportedly stood at rooftops chanting \\"Allahu Akbar!\\" [\\"God is greatest!\\"] at the sight. When four Palestinian children were killed by Israeli fire while playing on a beach in Gaza, the Israeli newssite Walla!'s talkback received comments ranging from \\"There isn't a more beautiful picture than those of dead Arab children,\\" and \\"Really, these are great pictures. They make me so happy, I want to look at them again and again,\\" to \\"As many children as possible should die.\\"Gideon Levy, Images from Gaza should trouble every Israeli, Haaretz 24 July 2014. After 13 soldiers were killed in Gaza on 20 July, many families found out about their family member's death via WhatsApp hours before officially being told by the IDF,Soldiers arrested for leaking news of fellow soldiers' deaths on social media, timesofisrael/com; accessed 23 July 2014. which eventually led to the arrest of three soldiers for leaking the news.Three soldiers arrested for news leaks, Cleveland Jewish News; accessed 23 July 2014. Many foreign journalists inside Gaza have Tweeted that they were witnessing Hamas using human shields by launching rockets from within civilian areas including hospitals and the hotels the journalists were staying, as well as Hamas members allegedly dressing up as civilians while hiding weapons. Pro- Palestinian Tweeters responded by making threats and calling the journalists Israeli spies. =YouTube= Shock Israel's Security is a propaganda song produced by Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades in 2012, advocating shocking the security of Israel by terrorist attacks. It removed from YouTube because it violated its policy prohibiting hate speech. Many Israeli cover songs had been uploaded to YouTube as comments for the song, such as \\"in this way, we will do Herew attacks\\" (ÿ™ŸÅÿπŸÑ ÿ∞ŸÑŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸáÿ¨ŸÖÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ®ÿ±Ÿä), showing that Israel defends itself from rockets, tunnels, attacks, etc., and opposed to Hamas propaganda. After many performances were canceled, ŒüŒΩ 15 July, Yoav Yahav released a YouTube video with a message for Hamas. Supposedly Hamas were warned by the crazy fans of Blackstreet to stop firing rockets towards Israel. On 16 July, reserve soldiers resented Netanyahu for not letting them into Gaza after nine days on the border, having left their wives and work. Mordechai Yitzhar of Battalion 630 uploaded to YouTube a song with the Hebrew title \\"The Protective Edge Anthem\\" (◊¶◊ï◊ß ◊ê◊ô◊™◊ü - ◊î◊û◊†◊ï◊ü ◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ú◊ô ◊¶◊î\\"◊ú ◊û◊®◊ì◊õ◊ô ◊ô◊¶◊î◊®). It reported that soldiers are worried that they have abandoned their private lives in vain if Israel gives up the ground incursion into the Gaza Strip.http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=1069428 nana10 During the last week of the operation, many citizens, in a parody of the Ice Bucket Challenge uploaded to YouTube under the hashtag \\"RubbleBucketChallenge\\" or \\"GazaBucketChallenge\\". Instead of emptying a bucket of iced water over their heads, participants used a bucket of dust and rubble to raise awareness of the situation in Gaza. Ethnix's song, \\"Tomorrow I will return home\\" (◊û◊ó◊® ◊ê◊†◊ô ◊ë◊ë◊ô◊™), became one of the most famous songs after operations. It was sung by the band to Israeli soldiers in the middle of the ground offensive. Advert ban The Israel Broadcasting Authority banned a 1-minute, 25-second radio advert, produced by the Israeli human rights' group B'Tselem, which listed the names and ages of some Palestinian children killed in the conflict in Hebrew; the grounds given were that the advert was \\"politically controversial\\". B'Tselem appealed the decision, which it said was a \\"far-reaching statement\\" that amounted to censorship, and the organization asked: \\"Is it controversial that the children [aren't] alive? That they're children? That those are their names? These are facts that we wish to bring to the public's knowledge.\\" Their appeal was declined. They plan to petition the Supreme Court of Israel. Publication of antisemitic material The Sydney Morning Herald apologized for running an antisemitic cartoon after Australian Attorney-General George Brandis denounced it as \\"deplorable\\". Questions on civilian deaths The BBC reviewing the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights figures, stated the 725 civilian men killed outnumbered the 214 women by 3.5 to 1. Additionally 216 confirmed Hamas members makes the disparity larger. The New York Times presented statistics questioning that 72% were civilians. They stated that men ages 20‚Äì29, the most common for Hamas militants, made up 34% of the death toll despite making up 9% of the Gaza population. Additionally women and children made up just 33% of the deaths, despite making up 71% of the population. Hamas claims during the fighting During the fighting media sources affiliated with Hamas were reported as claiming to have killed a large number of Israeli soldiers; taken soldiers captive; shot down an F16 plane, destroyed at least two Merkava tanks and flying UAVs over Tel Aviv and taking pictures of the IDF HQ.

The tunnel system branches beneath many Gazan towns and cities, such as Khan Yunis, Jabalia and the Shati refugee camp. The internal tunnels, running some dozens of kilometres within the Gaza Strip, have several functions. Hamas uses the tunnels to hide its arsenal of rocketry underground, to facilitate communication, to permit munition stocks to be hidden and to conceal militants, making detection from the air difficult.Jim Michaels,'Extent of tunnels under Gaza takes Israel by surprise,' USA Today 31 July 2014. Hamas leader Khalid Meshal has said in an interview with Vanity Fair that their tunnel system is a defensive structure designed to place obstacles against Israel's powerful military arsenal, to protect its people, and engage in counter-strikes against the IDF when Gaza is attacked, and that it has never caused the death of civilians, being safer than their system of unguidable missiles which are not intended to threaten civilians but strike indiscriminately.Adam Ciralsky, 'Hamas‚Äôs Khalid Mishal on the Gaza War, Tunnels, and ISIS,' Vanity Fair 21 October 2014. The cross-border tunnels were used in the capture of Gilad Shalit in 2006, and multiple times during the 2014 conflict.Gal Perl Finkel, The IDF vs subterranean warfare, The Jerusalem Post, 16 August 2016. Destroying the tunnels was a primary objective of Israeli forces in the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict2014 conflict. The IDF reported that it \\"neutralized\\" 32 tunnels, fourteen of which crossed into Israel. On at least four occasions during the conflict, Palestinian militants crossing the border through the tunnels engaged in combat with Israeli soldiers. In practice, only Israeli military targets have successfully been attacked through them.: \\"A senior military official estimated tonight (Thursday) in a conversation with Army Radio that the IDF can complete the task of destroying the tunnels within 48 hours. The military official said: 'all the tunnels were aimed at military targets and not at the Gaza-vicinity communities'...\\" The UNHRC Commission of Inquiry on the Gaza Conflict found \\"the tunnels were only used to conduct attacks directed at IDF positions in Israel in the vicinity of the Green Line, which are legitimate military targets.\\" Israeli officials condemned the UNHRC report. The UN Commission of Inquiry found the tunnels \\"caused great anxiety among Israelis that the tunnels might be used to attack civilians.\\" Ihab al-Ghussein, spokesman for the Hamas-run interior ministry, describes the tunnels as an exercise of Gaza's \\"right to protect itself.\\" Israeli officials reported four \\"incidents in which members of Palestinian armed groups emerged from tunnel exits located between 1.1 and 4.7 km from civilian homes.\\" \\"Official Israeli sources describe ‚Äòcross-border tunnel attacks‚Äô as one of ‚Äòtwo primary means to target Israeli civilians,‚Äô explaining that, ‚ÄòHamas placed tunnel openings close to residential communities in Israel‚Äô.\\" The Israeli government refers to cross-border tunnels as \\"attack tunnels\\" or \\"terror tunnels.\\" According to Israel, the tunnels enabled the launch of rockets by remote control,William Booth,'Here's what really happened in the Gaza war according to the Israelis,' Washington Post 3 September 2014. Retrieved 15 October 2014 and were intended to facilitate hostage-taking and mass-casualty attacks., citing Origins and construction Photograph of a tunnel in Gaza discovered in 2014 The tunnel construction employed in the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict has its origins in the tunnels into Egypt that were constructed to overcome Egyptian and Israeli economic blockade on the coastal enclave which has been in effect since 2007. The tunnels into Israel were constructed using the expertise of the Rafah families who have specialized in digging tunnels into Egypt for commerce and smuggling, and have been described by former Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya as representative of \\"a new strategy in confronting the occupation and in the conflict with the enemy from underground and from above the ground.\\" According to Eado Hecht, an Israeli defence analyst specialising in underground warfare, \\"[T]hese underground complexes are fairly similar in concept to the Viet Cong tunnels dug beneath the jungles of South Vietnam, though the quality of finishing is better, with concrete walls and roofs, electricity and other required amenities for lengthy sojourn.\\" The Israeli military has provided estimates that Hamas spent around $30 to $90 million, and poured 600,000 tons of concrete, in order to build three dozen tunnels.Fitch, Asa, Rory Jones and Adam Entous. \\"Early Failure to Detect Gaza Tunnel Network Triggers Recriminations in Israel: Israel Estimates Gaza Tunnels Cost Hamas $90 Million to Build.\\" The Wall Street Journal. 10 August 2014. Some tunnels were estimated to have cost $3 million to construct. The Mako network published a description of the working conditions on the tunnels, citing an unnamed Israeli informant who said he worked on them, including the following details: Workers spent 8‚Äì12 hours a day on construction under precarious conditions and received a monthly wage of $150‚Äì$300. Hamas used electric or pneumatic jackhammers for digging tunnels. Tunnels were dug 18‚Äì25 meters (60‚Äì82 feet) underground at the rate of 4‚Äì5 meters a day. Tunnels were usually dug through sandy soil requiring their roof to be supported by a more durable level of clay. Tunnels were also reinforced by concrete panels manufactured in workshops adjacent to each tunnel. Construction and use of the tunnels is associated with mortal danger due to accidental detonation of explosives and tunnel collapses. Hamas reported that 22 members of its armed wing died in tunnel accidents in 2017; another militant was killed on 22 April 2018. Strategic objectives According to Eado Hecht, an Israeli defence analyst specialising in underground warfare, \\"Three different kinds of tunnels existed beneath Gaza, smuggling tunnels between Gaza and Egypt; defensive tunnels inside Gaza, used for command centres and weapons storage; and ‚Äìconnected to the defensive tunnels ‚Äìoffensive tunnels used for cross-border attacks on Israel\\", including the capture of Israeli soldiers. Palestinian military personnel in Gaza explained to news Web site al-Monitor that the purpose of a cross-border tunnel was to conduct operations behind enemy lines in the event of an Israeli operation against Gaza. A Palestinian militia document obtained by al-Monitor and also published in the Washington Post described the objectives of the under-border tunnels: > The tunnel war is one of the most important and most dangerous military > tactics in the face of the Israeli army because it features a qualitative > and strategic dimension, because of its human and moral effects, and because > of its serious threat and unprecedented challenge to the Israeli military > machine, which is heavily armed and follows security doctrines involving > protection measures and preemption. ... [The tactic is] to surprise the > enemy and strike it a deadly blow that doesn't allow a chance for survival > or escape or allow him a chance to confront and defend itself. A separate Al-Monitor report describes tunnels within Gaza and away from the border that serve two purposes: storing and shielding weapons including rockets and launchers, and providing security and mobility to Hamas militants. The report states the latter function occurs in a set of \\"security tunnels\\": \\"Every single leader of Hamas, from its lowest ranking bureaucrats to its most senior leaders, is intimately familiar with the route to the security tunnel assigned to him and his family.\\" Twenty-three militants in the Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, survived Israeli shelling on 17 July and remained alive but trapped in a tunnel until the early August ceasefire. A tour of a Palestinian attack tunnel. The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, an Israeli security think tank, describes tunnel warfare as a shifting of the balance of power: \\"Tunnel warfare provided armies facing a technologically superior adversary with an effective means for countering its air superiority.\\" According to the center, tunnels conceal missile launchers, facilitate attacks on strategic targets like Ben-Gurion Airport, and allow cross-border access to Israeli territory. The Israeli government has called the tunnels \\"terror tunnels,\\" stating that they have a potential to target civilians and soldiers in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the aim was to abduct and kill civilians. An IDF spokesman said the goal is \\"to abduct or kill civilians but will make do with a soldier, too.\\" The Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv reported that, according to unnamed Israeli security sources, the tunnels were to be utilized in a mass casualty terror attack planned to take place on the Jewish high holy day of Rosh Hashanah, 24 September 2014. The plan was described to reporter Ariel Kahane by the sources, and reportedly revealed to the Israeli security Cabinet by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. The alleged plot entailed a planned assault in which two hundred of heavily armed Hamas fighters would have emerged at night from more than a dozen tunnels and infiltrate Israeli territory, killing and/or abducting Israeli citizens. An unnamed \\"senior intelligence source\\" told The Times of Israel on 28 July that of the nine cross-border tunnels detected, none stretched into a civilian community, and that in the five infiltrations to that time Hamas had targeted soldiers rather than civilians. On 31 July IDF Army Radio quoted an unnamed \\"senior military official\\" as saying \\"all the tunnels were aimed at military targets and not at the Gaza- vicinity communities\\". A column in the Wall Street Journal cited Yigal Carmon, head of the Middle East Media Research Institute who claimed that it was the tunnels, and not the 2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers that was the immediate cause of war in the summer of 2014. According to Carmon's reading of the situation, the tunnels gave Hamas the ability to stake a mass- casualty attack on the scale of the 2008 Islamist terror attack on the Taj Hotel in Mumbai that killed 164 people. A 5 July Israeli airstrike damaged a tunnel near Kibbutz Kerem Shalom, and a group of Hamas military inspectors were killed in an explosion at the tunnel on 6 July. According to Carmon, this may have persuaded Hamas that Israel was becoming aware of the scale of the capacity for militants to infiltrate Israel via tunnels, making a successful surprise mass-casualty attack less likely, and convincing the Hamas leadership to go to war immediately before more of the tunnels could be discovered and destroyed. Alan Dershowitz argued that the goal of the tunnels was to facilitate \\"mass casualties and kidnappings\\", citing the proximity of tunnel exits to civilian targets such as Israeli kindergartens as well as the 17 July \\"attempted mass casualty attack\\" that preceded Israel's ground incursion. Dershowitz stated: \\"No country should have to tolerate this breach of its sovereignty and this danger to the lives of its civilians.\\" An editorial in the Washington Post described the tunnels as \\"using tons of concrete desperately needed for civilian housing\\" and also as endangering civilians because they were constructed under civilian homes in the \\"heavily populated Shijaiyah district\\" and underneath the al-Wafa Hospital. =Kidnapping= Israel describes kidnapping Israeli civilians or taking Israeli soldiers hostage as one of the primary goals of tunnel construction. The Wall Street Journal described an attack tunnel inspected by one of its reporters as, \\"designed for launching murder and kidnapping raids. The 3-mile-long tunnel was reinforced with concrete, lined with telephone wires, and included cabins unnecessary for infiltration operations but useful for holding hostages.\\" In October 2013, according to the newspaper Haaretz, \\"The IDF's working assumption (wa)s that such tunnels will be made operative whenever there is an escalation in the area, whether initiated by Hamas or by Israel, and will be used for attacks and abduction attempts. If Hamas initiates such an escalation while holding several Israeli citizens or soldiers, it would be in a much stronger position.\\" According to the New York Times, one tunnel contained \\"a kidnapping kit of tranquilizers and plastic handcuffs\\" to facilitate kidnapping. Hamas leader Khalid Mishal denies that the tunnels were ever to be used to attack civilians: \\"Have any of the tunnels been used to kill any civilian or any of the residents of such towns? No. Never! . . . [Hamas] used them either to strike beyond the back lines of the Israeli army or to raid some military sites . . . This proves that Hamas is only defending itself.\\" Israel's countermeasures According to Israel, between January and October 2013, three tunnels under the border were identified, two of which were packed with explosives. On 11 August 2014 the IDF announced they had successfully tested a system that could be used to detect these tunnels. This new system uses a combination of sensors and special transmitters to locate tunnels. The IDF expects development to cost up to NIS 1.5 billion, and could be deployed within the year. In the summer of 2017, Israel began the construction of a border wall which stretched several meters underground to counter tunnel assaults.The structure is equipped with sensors to detect future tunnel construction. Concrete for the structure was produced using five concrete factories dedicated to the project and about 10 meters was completed daily. The structure was placed entirely on Israeli land. Palestinian tunnel that was uncovered on 10 December 2017, in Israeli side of the border between kibbitz Kissufim and Kibbutz Nirim (but over 1 km from either community). On 30 October 2017 Israeli forces destroyed a tunnel that crossed the Gaza border into Israeli territory.Israel destroys tunnel from Gaza, killing seven Palestinians, Guardian, 30 October 2017 Twelve Palestinians, including ten members of Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine and two Hamas militants, were killed in the blast and subsequent rescue efforts.ISRAEL SAYS IT'S HOLDING BODIES OF GAZA TERRORISTS KILLED IN TUNNEL BLAST, JPost, 5 November 2017 The most senior person killed was Brigade Commander Arafat Marshood of Islamic Jihad's al-Quds Brigades. On 10 December 2017 Israeli forces destroyed an additional tunnel that crossed the border.[https://www.reuters.com/article/us- israel-palestinians-tunnel/israel-says-it-has-destroyed-hamas-attack-tunnel- from-gaza-idUSKBN1E40BR Israel says it has destroyed Hamas attack tunnel from Gaza ], Reuters, 10 December 2017 In January 2018, following the destruction of an attack tunnel from Gaza that crossed into Egypt and Israel,Israel says it destroyed Gaza attack tunnel under Egyptian border, Reuters, 14 January 2018 IDF Major General Yoav Mordechai, speaking in Arabic, said, \\"I want to send a message to everyone who is digging or gets too close to the tunnels: As you‚Äôve seen in the past two months, these tunnels bring only death,\\" referring to Hamas tunnels that had recently been destroyed by Israel. Major General Eyal Zamir stated that more Hamas tunnels into Israel would be destroyed as the construction of a barrier around the Gaza will soon be completed. In April 2018, the Israeli military announced it had disabled a tunnel that stretched kilometers into Gaza, near Jabalia, and reached several meters into Israel, towards Nahal Oz. No exit had yet been built on the Israeli side. For the first time, an Israeli airstrike destroyed a naval tunnel belonging to Hamas in June 2018. In August the Israeli Ministry of Defense released the first pictures of an underwater barrier with Gaza designed to prevent Hamas infiltrations by sea. Construction of the barrier started two months before and is expected to be completed by the end of the year, stretching two hundred meters into the Mediterranean. Use in attacks In the 2006 Gaza cross- border raid, Palestinian militants used a tunnel to abduct Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. On 17 July 2014, Hamas militants crossed the Israeli border through a tunnel about a mile away from the farming village of Sufa but were stopped by Israeli Defense Forces. The Israeli military reported that thirteen armed men had exited the tunnel, and shared video footage of them being hit by the explosion of an airstrike. Israeli authorities claimed the purpose had been to attack civilians. Residents also expressed fears that the purpose of the incursion was to commit a massacre. On 21 July 2014, two squads of armed Palestinian militants crossed the Israeli border through a tunnel near Kibbutz Nir Am. The first squad of ten was killed by an Israeli air strike. A second squad killed four Israeli soldiers using an anti-tank weapon. The Jerusalem Post reported that the attackers sought to infiltrate Kibbutz Nir Am, but a senior intelligence source told the Times of Israel that \\"the Hamas gunmen were not in motion or en route to a kibbutz but rather had camouflaged themselves in the field, laying an ambush for an army patrol.\\" On 28 July Hamas militants attacked an Israeli military outpost near Nahal Oz using a tunnel, killing five Israeli soldiers. One attacker was also killed. On 1 August 2014, Hamas militants emerging from a tunnel attacked an Israeli patrol in Rafah, thus violating a humanitarian ceasefire, killing two Israeli soldiers. Israel at first believed that the militants had abducted Lieutenant Hadar Goldin and were holding him, but Israel later determined that Goldin had also been killed.

Early Life and Politics Shalini Phalke was born in 1931 in a relatively poor family. Her father believed in female education. Shalini married Shyamrao Jadhav in the 1950s. She had four children with him and earned a law degree whilst married to him. Shalini entered politics when her children were young. Her first public position was as a member on Satara Zilla Parishad ( County Council). Later she was appointed as president of the women's wing of the MPCC (Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee) Shyamrao died in 1964 and shortly after his death, Shalini married maratha politician Vasantdada Patil. Political career She held ministerial positions in the Congress party Governments of Maharashtra during the 1980s. In 1981, she was instrumental in getting the then chief minister A. R. Antulay to resign. Shalinitai became active in Maharashtra politics after marrying Vasantdada Patil. Later she represented Sangli constituency in the Indian parliament (Lok Sabha) during a period in the 1980s. She represented the constituency of Koregaon, Satara in the Maharashtra state legislative assembly, the (Vidhan Sabha) from 1999 to 2009. Prior to that she unsuccessfully contested the seat in 1990 and 1995 for the Janata dal and as an independent respectively. During the 1970s, she founded a charity called Rajmata Jijau Pratishthan to raise funds for hospitals for the poor and women related activities. The charity was in the news for controversial granting of or purchase of land by the government for the charity. Mrs. Patil was well known for speaking her mind, particularly about rights for the Maratha community. During her career, she has campaigned for more seats for women in elected bodies. She has also criticized the Indian Central Government's move to extend 27.5 per cent reservation to OBCs in the central academic institutes such as IITs and IIMs. Since her then party, the Nationalist Congress Party led by Sharad Pawar supported this policy, Shalinitai was expelled from that party in 2006. In 2009, she launched a new party called Krantisena Maharashtra. The party did not attract much support and soon Shalinitai joined the Congress party.

Biography Veziliƒá was born in a Serbian village called Stari Ker, today's Zmajevo, situated in the Vrbas municipality, in the South Baƒçka District, Vojvodina province, then part of the Austrian Military Frontier, on 17 July 1753. He completed his early schooling in Novi Sad and Segedin, and studied Latin and German at the universities of Buda and Pest. Upon graduation in 1780, he went to Vienna and enrolled in the newly established √âcole Normale (which in time became the College of Pedagogy of the University of Vienna), then under the guidance of professor Stevan Vujanovski. Founded in Vienna, the √âcole Normale trained teachers and supervisors of all the reformed schools. In 1782 he became a professor at a teacher's college in Karlovci. In 1785 he entered the University of Vienna to read law, and two years later, he taught Latin and German in Karlovci. In 1790 he was offered the post of regent of Serbian and Romanian Orthodox schools in what was then called the Velikovardar and Eger districts in Hungary. He was for the better part of his life ostensibly headed for the Church, but not until 1790. After a brief period of study, he was ordained that year at Rakovac monastery in Fruska Gora. Two years later he died on 12 January 1792 at Novi Sad. He was 39. How seriously he took himself as a poet is clear from the classical form in which he began his career. He produced in turn a book -- Kratkoje socinenije o privatnih i publicnih delah (1775) -- containing four odes, while another of his works -- Kratkoje napisenije o spokojnoj zizni (1788) -- represented the first collection of verses in modern Serbian literature. Also, he wrote a Serbian-German Dictionary entitled Reƒçnik malyj nemecko-serbsij, published posthumously in Vienna in 1793. His legacy As an intellectual, Veziliƒá condemned magic and superstition. He belongs to the race of poetical reformers who appeared in all countries of Europe at the end of the eighteenth century; but it is interesting to observe that in point of time he preceded all of them. He was born four years earlier than Rigas Feraios, six years before Friedrich Schiller, nine years before Andre Chenier, and seventeen and nineteen years earlier than William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge respectively, but he did for Serbia what each of these poets did for his own country. Veziliƒá found Serbian literature given to too much religiosity, rhetoric and with little art and vigor. He was the first to introduce classicism, vivacity of style, freshness and brevity of form, and an imaginative study of nature which was then unprecedented. But perhaps his greatest claim to notice is the fact that he was among the earliest intellectuals (Pavle Julinac, Jovan Rajiƒá, Zaharije Orfelin, Dositej Obradoviƒá, Jovan Mu≈°katiroviƒá) to call the attention of his people to the treasuries of their rich, ancient history and mythology, and to suggest the use of these in imaginative writing. Veziliƒá was the founder of classicism in Serbian literature, but it was the work of Lukijan Mu≈°icki which, according to Jovan Skerliƒá, brought it to its apogee. The Serbian-Russian general Semyon Zorich was also remembered in a special way, in poems published in Vienna and Buda, by Aleksije Veziliƒá.

Two of Wilcox's uncles were also physicians, and one of Wilcox' brothers would also pursue that profession. In 1837, Wilcox's family moved to Lacon, Illinois. Wilcox attended public school there and later attended private schooling at Mount Morris Academy. Wilcox's father died young, so Wilcox studied medicine under one of his uncles, R. B.

The first six issues were drawn by Nate Bellegarde, colored by Jordie Bellaire, lettered by Fonografix (Steven Finch), and published by Image Comics. As of issue 7, Dave Taylor has replaced Nate Bellegarde, who no longer is part of the creative team. Emi Lenox also joined up, providing short comics about Monica Strange, one of the characters of Nowhere Men. The series centers on a fictional world where a group of four scientists, long since gone their own ways, have had huge cultural influences in a way similar to that of The Beatles in our world. It's loosely based on the story of the British Invasion, especially how The Beatles stood out. The promotional tagline, \\"Science is the new Rock-N-Roll\\", exemplifies this. The name is derived primarily from the fact that things just seem to come out of nowhere for the scientists, although there are other plot points that the name is based on as well. It was also influenced by the Beatles song \\"Nowhere Man\\". Nowhere Men was nominated for four Eisner Awards in 2014, of which it won one: Jordie Bellaire won the award for Best Colorist for her work on several titles, including Nowhere Men. As of September 2019, eleven issues have been published, the first six of which form the completed first arc. The seventh through eleventh issues are part of the second arc, which started in January 2016 after a two-year delay.  Publication history  = Arc 1 = The first arc of Nowhere Men consists of six issues, published between November 2012 and October 2013 and collected in November 2013 in a collected edition with the title Nowhere Men, Vol. 1: Fates Worse Than Death TP. = Arc 2 = The second arc was originally scheduled to start with the release of issue 7 in January 2014, but this release did not happen. Around the same time, Image Comics pulled the webpages on issues 7, 8 and 9, which resulted in speculation on the series' possible cancellation. In May 2014, a tweet by Image Comics confirmed the series was still being worked on. Nate Bellegarde attributed the delays in Nowhere Men to himself in a long Google document he posted on his Tumblr in July 2014. While it did not give a predicted date of publishing, it confirmed that the series was still being worked on. On November 2, 2015, Image Comics announced the return of Nowhere Men. David Taylor replaced Nate Bellegarde. Jordie Bellaire and Fonografiks continued working on the series alongside Stephenson. Emi Lenox provides small comics about the Nowhere Men character Monica Strange. Issue 7 was released on January 20, 2016, starting the second story arc which hasn't completed as of September 2020..

Together, the four form World Corp., a research and development firm that becomes the most influential business in the entire world; but their differences, including a dispute over how to handle a secret experiment gone wrong, drive them apart. According to Stephenson, inspiration was drawn not just from The Beatles, but also from the story of Apple and their war with Microsoft and how he thought the leaders of the two rivals would work if they were teammates. Sometime after the scientists leave, World Corp. workers aboard the International Space Station begin suffering from a virus that affects each of them differently. Due to the secrecy of the mission, only some higher-ups in World Corp. know that the workers are there; and they're unwilling to bring the workers back to Earth.

Eichler and others, Namenforschung, 3 vols., 1995 and more specifically of anthroponomastics, the study of names of persons. There are hundreds of thousands and even millions of Greek names on record, making them an important resource for any general study of naming, as well as for the study of ancient Greece itself. The names are found in literary texts, on coins and stamped amphora handles, on potsherds used in ostracisms, and, much more abundantly, in inscriptions and (in Egypt) on papyri. This article will concentrate on Greek naming from the 8th century BC, when the evidence begins, to the end of the 6th century AD.O. Masson, 'Les noms propres d'homme en grec ancien', in E. Eichler and others, Namenforschung, vol. I (1995), 706-710  Single names and names within families  ostrakon: a pot shard bearing the name of a politician proposed for ostracism (exile). The individual name Aristides and patronym Lysimachos together mean \\"Aristides, son of Lysimachos\\" Ancient Greeks usually had one name, but another element was often added in semi-official contexts or to aid identification: a father's name (patronym) in the genitive case, or in some regions as an adjectival formulation. A third element might be added, indicating the individual's membership in a particular kinship or other grouping, or city of origin (when the person in question was away from that city). Thus the orator Demosthenes, while proposing decrees in the Athenian assembly, was known as \\"Demosthenes, son of Demosthenes of Paiania\\"; Paiania was the deme or regional sub-unit of Attica to which he belonged by birth. If Americans used that system, Abraham Lincoln would have been called \\"Abraham, son of Thomas of Kentucky\\" (where he was born). In some rare occasions, if a person was illegitimate or fathered by a non-citizen, they might use their mother's name (metronym) instead of their father's. Ten days after a birth, relatives on both sides were invited to a sacrifice and feast called dek√°tƒì (), \\"tenth day\\"; on this occasion the father formally named the child.N. Dunbar, Aristophanes, Birds (1995), 339. Demosthenes was unusual in bearing the same name as his own father; it was more common for names to alternate between generations or between lines of a family. Thus it was common to name a first son after his paternal grandfather, and the second after the maternal grandfather, great-uncle, or great-aunt. A speaker in a Greek court case explained that he had named his four children after, respectively, his own father, the father of his wife, a relative of his wife, and the father of his own mother.Speech against Makartatos, ascribed to Demosthenes, sect. 74 (translated by A. T. Murray) Perseus Digital Library Alternatively, family members might adopt variants of the same name, as for instance \\"Demippos, son of Demotimos\\". The practice of naming children after their grandparents is still widely practiced in Greece today.  Naming women  In many contexts, etiquette required that respectable women be spoken of as the wife or daughter of X rather than by their own names. On gravestones or dedications, however, they had to be identified by name. Here, the patronymic formula \\"son of X\\" used for men might be replaced by \\"wife of X\\", or supplemented as \\"daughter of X, wife of Y\\". Many women bore forms of standard masculine names, with a feminine ending substituted for the masculine. Many standard names related to specific masculine achievements had a common feminine equivalent; the counterpart of Nikomachos, \\"victorious in battle\\", would be Nikomachƒì. The taste mentioned above for giving family members related names was one motive for the creation of such feminine forms. There were also feminine names with no masculine equivalent, such as Glykera \\"sweet one\\"; Hedistƒì \\"most delightful\\". Another distinctive way of forming feminine names was the neuter diminutive suffix -ion (-ŒπŒøŒΩ, while the masculine corresponding suffix was -ŒπœâŒΩ), suggesting the idea of a \\"little thing\\": e.g., Aristion from aristos \\"best\\"; Mikrion from mikros \\"small\\". Perhaps by extension of this usage, women's names were sometimes formed from men's by a change to a neuter ending without the diminutive sense: Hilaron from hilaros, \\"cheerful\\".  Formation of names  There were five main personal name types in Greece:For analysis http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/names/LGPN-Ling.html = Compound names = Demosthenes is compounded from two ordinary Greek roots (a structure at least as old as proto-Indo-European): demos \\"people\\" and sthenos \\"strength\\". A vast number of Greek names have this form, being compounded from two clearly recognizable (though sometimes shortened) elements: Nikomachos from nike \\"victory\\" and mache \\"battle\\", Sophokles from sophos \\"wise, skilled\\" and kleos \\"glory\\", Polykrates from poly \\"much\\" and kratos \\"power\\". The elements used in these compounds are typically positive and of good omen, stressing such ideas as beauty, strength, bravery, victory, glory, and horsemanship. The order of the elements was often reversible: aristos and kleos give both Aristokles and Klearistos. Such compounds have a more or less clear meaning. But as was already noted by Aristotle,Aristotle, Poetics 1457a 12-14 (translated by W. H. Fyfe) Perseus Digital Library two elements could be brought together in illogical ways. Thus the immensely productive hippos \\"horse\\" yielded, among hundreds of compounds, not only meaningful ones such as Philippos \\"lover of horses\\" and Hippodamas \\"horse-tamer\\", but also Xenippos \\"stranger horse\\" and Andrippos \\"man horse\\". There were, in turn, numerous other names beginning with Xen- and Andr-. These \\"irrational\\" compounds arose through a combination of common elements.O. Masson, Onomastica Graeca Selecta, ed. C. Dobias and L. Dubois (1990), 88 and 404. One motive was a tendency for members of the same family to receive names that echoed one another without being identical. Thus we meet Demippos, son of Demotimos, where the son's name is irrational (\\"people horse\\") and the father's name meaningful (\\"people honour\\", i.e., honored among the people). = Shortened names = A second major category of names was shortened versions (\\"hypocoristics,\\" or in German Kosenamen) of the compounded names. Thus alongside the many names beginning with Kall- \\"beauty\\" such as Kallinikos \\"of fair victory\\", there are shortened Kallias and Kallon (masculine) or Kallis (feminine). Alongside victory names such as Nikostratos \\"victory army\\", there are Nikias and Nikon (masculine) or Niko (feminine). Such shortenings were variously formed and very numerous: more than 250 shortenings of names in Phil(l)- (\\"love\\") and related roots have been counted. = Simple names = Ordinary nouns and adjectives of the most diverse types were used as names, either unadjusted or with the addition of a wide variety of suffixes. For instance, some twenty different names are formed from aischros \\"ugly\\", including that of the poet we know as Aeschylus, the Latin spelling of Aischylos. Among the many different categories of nouns and adjectives from which the most common names derive are colors (Xanthos \\"yellow'), animals (Moschos \\"heifer\\", and Dorkas \\"roe deer\\"), physical characteristics (Simos \\"snub nose\\"), parts of the body (Kephalos, from kephale \\"head\\", and many from various slang terms for genitalia). Few of these simple names are as common as the most common compound names, but they are extraordinarily numerous and varied. Identifying their origins often taxes the knowledge of the outer reaches of Greek vocabulary.J. Curbera, 'Simple Names in Ionia', in R. Parker (ed.), Personal Names in Ancient Anatolia (2013), 107-144. Here the quest for dignity seen in the compound names largely disappears. Some, to our ears, sound positively disrespectful: Gastron \\"pot belly\\", Batrachos \\"frog\\", Kopreus \\"shitty\\", but these are probably by origin affectionate nicknames, in many cases applied to small children, and subsequently carried on within families. = Theophoric (\\"god-carrying\\") names = Very many Greeks bore names derived from those of gods. Though it was not normal before the Roman period for Greeks to bear exactly the same names as gods, the two most common Greek names (Dionysios and Demetrios; feminine Dionysia and Demetria) were simple adjectival formations from the divine names Dionysos and Demeter. There were also compound theophoric names, formed with a wide variety of suffixes, of which the most common were -doros \\"gift of\\" (e.g. Dionysodoros \\"gift of Dionysos\\") or -dotos \\"given by\\" (Apollodotos). Many names were also based on cult titles of gods: Pythodoros, from Pythios \\"Apollo\\". Also common were names formed from the simple theos \\"god\\", such as Theodotos/Theodora. All the major gods except the god of war, Ares, and gods associated with the underworld (Persephone, Hades, Plouton [= Latin Pluto]) generated theophoric names, as did some lesser gods (rivers in particular) and heroes. When new gods rose to prominence (Asklepios) or entered Greece from outside (Isis, Sarapis), they too generated theophoric names formed in the normal ways (e.g. Asklepiodotos, Isidoros, Sarapias).R. Parker, 'Theophoric Names and the History of Greek Religion', in S. Hornblower and E. Matthews (eds.), Greek Personal Names. Their Value as Evidence (2000) Proceedings of the British Academy, Volume 104, pp. 53-80 = Lallnamen = This is the German word used for names that derived not from other words but from the sounds made by little children addressing their relatives. Typically, they involve repeated consonants or syllables (like English Dada, Nana)‚Äîexamples are Nanna and Papas. They grew hugely in frequency from a low base in the Roman period, probably through the influence of other naming traditions such as Phrygian, in which such names were very common.  A brief history of Greek naming  The main broad characteristics of Greek name formation listed above are found in other Indo-European languages (the Indo-Iranian, Germanic, Celtic, Baltic, and Slavic subgroups); they look like an ancient inheritance within Greek.R. Schmitt, 'Morphologie der Namen: Vollnamen und Kurznamen bzw Kosenamen im Indogermanischen' and 'Entwicklung der Namen in √§lteren indogermanischen Sprachen', in E. Eichler and others, Namenforschung, vol. I (1995), 419-427 and 616-636. The naming practices of the Mycenaeans in the 14th/13th centuries BC, insofar as they can be reconstructed from the early Greek known as Linear B, seem already to display most of the characteristics of the system visible when literacy resumed in the 8th century BC, though non- Greek names were also present. This is true also of the epic poetry of Homer, where many heroes have compound names of familiar types (Alexandros, Alkinoos, Amphimakhos). But the names of several of the greatest heroes (e.g. Achilleus, Odysseus, Agamemnon, Priamos) cannot be interpreted in those terms and were seldom borne by mortals again until a taste for \\"heroic\\" names developed under the Roman empire; they have a different, unexplained origin. The system described above underwent few changes before the Roman period, though the rise of Macedonia to power earned names of that region such as Ptolemaios, Berenike, and Arsinoe new popularity. Alternative names (\\"X also known as Y\\") started to appear in documents in the 2nd century BC but had been occasionally mentioned in literary sources much earlier. A different phenomenon, that of individuals bearing two names (e.g., Hermogenes Theodotos), emerged among families of high social standing‚Äîparticularly in Asia Minor in the Roman imperial period, possibly under the influence of Roman naming patterns. The influence of Rome is certainly visible both in the adoption of Roman names by Greeks and in the drastic transformation of names by Greeks who acquired Roman citizenship, a status marked by possession of not one but three names. Such Greeks often took the praenomen and nomen of the authors or sponsors of their citizenship, but retained their Greek name as cognomen to give such forms as Titus Flavius Alkibiades. Various mixed forms also emerged. The Latin suffix ‚Äìianus, originally indicating the birth family of a Roman adopted into another family, was taken over to mean initially \\"son of\\" (e.g. Asklepiodotianos = son of Asklepiodotos), then later as a source of independent new names. Another impulse came with the spread of Christianity, which brought new popularity to names from the New Testament, names of saints and martyrs, and existing Greek names such as Theodosios \\"gift of god\\", which could be reinterpreted in Christian terms. But non-Christian names, even theophoric names such as Dionysios or Sarapion, continued to be borne by Christians ‚Äî a reminder that a theophoric name could become a name like any other, its original meaning forgotten. Another phenomenon of late antiquity (5th‚Äì6th centuries) was a gradual shift away from the use of the father's name in the genitive as an identifier. A tendency emerged instead to indicate a person's profession or status within the Christian church: carpenter, deacon, etc.R. Parker, 'Introduction. New trends in Greek naming', in R. Parker (ed.), Personal Names in Ancient Anatolia (2013), 11-14, for all the developments in this paragraph. Many Greek names have come down by various routes into modern English, some easily recognisable such as Helen or Alexander, some modified such as Denis (from Dionysios). Suffixes Many Greeks names used distinctive suffixes that conveyed additional meaning. The suffix -ides (idas in Doric areas such as Sparta) indicates patrilineal descent, e.g. Leonidas (\\"son of the lion\\"). The diminutive suffix -ion was also common, e.g. Hephaestion (\\"little Hephaestus\\").  Names as history  The French epigraphist Louis Robert declared that what is needed in the study of names is not \\"catalogues of names but the history of names and even history by means of names (l'histoire par les noms).\\"L. Robert, Opera Minora Selecta, 2 (1970), 987. Names are a neglected but in some areas crucial historical source.R. Parker, 'Introduction', in R. Parker (ed.) Personal Names in Ancient Anatolia (2013), 1-10. Many names are characteristic of particular cities or regions. It is seldom safe to use an individual's name to assign him to a particular place, as the factors that determine individual choices of name are very various. But where a good cluster of names are present, it will usually be possible to identify with much plausibility where the group in question derives from. By such means, the origins of, say, bands of mercenaries or groups of colonists named in inscriptions without indication of their homeland can often be determined. Names are particularly important in situations of cultural contact: they may answer the question whether a particular city is Greek or non-Greek, and document the shifts and complexities in ethnic self- identification even within individual families. They also, through theophoric names, provide crucial evidence for the diffusion of new cults, and later of Christianity. Two other once-popular ways of exploiting names for social history, by contrast, have fallen out of favor. Certain names and classes of name were often borne by slaves, since their names were given or changed at will by their owners, who may not have liked to allow them dignified names.Plato, Cratylus, section 384d (translated by Harold N. Fowler) Perseus Digital Library But no names or very few were so borne exclusively, and many slaves had names indistinguishable from those of the free; one can never identify a slave by name alone.E. Matthews, article 'Names, Personal, Greek', in S. Hornblower and A. Spawforth (eds), The Oxford Classical Dictionary ed. 4 (2012), 996. Similar arguments apply to so-called \\"courtesans‚Äô names\\".  The study of Greek names  Jean Antoine Letronne Jean Antoine Letronne (1851) Reprinted in his Oeuvres choisies III. 2, 1ff was the pioneer work stressing the importance of the subject. Pape and Benseler (1863‚Äì1870) was for long the central work of reference but has now been replaced. Bechtel (1917) is still the main work that seeks to explain the formation and meaning of Greek names, although the studies of O. Masson et al. collected in Onomastica Graeca Selecta (1990‚Äì2000) have constantly to be consulted. L. Robert, Noms indig√®nes dans l‚ÄôAsie Mineure gr√©co-romaine (1963), is, despite its title, largely a successful attempt to show that many names attested in Asia Minor and supposed to be indigenous are in fact Greek; it is a dazzling demonstration of the resources of Greek naming. The fundamental starting point is now the multi- volume A Lexicon of Greek Personal Names, founded by P.M. Fraser and still being extended with the collaboration of many scholars. This work lists, region by region, not only every name attested in the region but every bearer of that name (thus popularity of the name can be measured). The huge numbers of Greek names attested in Egypt are accessible at Trismegistos People. Several volumes of studies have been published that build on the new foundation created by these comprehensive collections: S. Hornblower and E. Matthews (2000); E. Matthews (2007); R. W. V. Catling and F. Marchand (2010); R. Parker (2013).

The institute provides a range of courses, and offers a BA in Visual Arts and an MA in Fine arts in association with the Universidad de Guanajuato. Its courses and degrees are recognized by most North American universities. It has been popular with American and Canadian students and artists since it opened in 1950, and the town now has a large expatriate community from the USA and Canada. Location View of the town The town of San Miguel de Allende is about four hours drive north of Mexico City. It is named after General Ignacio Allende, a hero of the Mexican War of Independence. It is at altitude of and has a temperate climate. The town was founded in 1542. It was flourishing by the 17th century, but in the late 18th century suffered from a severe economic crisis. The wealthy inhabitants moved elsewhere, and the town stagnated. The institute brought new life to the town, which is now relatively prosperous. San Miguel has cobblestone streets and old stone buildings, and has been designated a national historical monument. The institute is a few blocks southwest of the town center. It is housed in a massive building that was originally erected as a country residence for the wealthy Canal family. The family of the Conde de Canal began building on the site in 1735. In 1809 it was sold to the Discalced Carmelite sisters. They may have had the tunnel built that once connected it to the Parroquia. The art college occupies the rear of the complex and its gardens. The front has a commercial plaza with a caf√© and several galleries. The Galer√≠a P√©rgola, opened in 1951 as an exhibition space for the Institute, has a large collection of works by Mexican artists in different styles and media. The Feria de Lana y Lat√≥n, a large crafts fair with vendors from across the country, is held every few months in the central plaza of the Institute. Background Convento de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Concepci√≥n, home of the Escuela Universitaria de Bellas Artes In 1927 the Peruvian diplomat and artist Felipe Coss√≠o del Pomar visited the town and was enchanted by the quality of light. More than ten years later he founded the Escuela Universitaria de Bellas Artes (University School of Fine arts) in a former convent that had been used as a barracks. The influx of students brought new prosperity to the town. Coss√≠o del Pomar returned to Peru when the Peruvian government granted amnesty to exiles. He sold his holdings, which included a ranch as well as the school, to the Mexico City lawyer Alfredo Campanella. When World War II ended in 1945, the G.I. Bill provided free education for veterans. Campanella saw an opportunity to make money when the school was approved for GI students. Stirling Dickinson, an artist in charge of promoting the school, was persuaded to over-state the quality of the teaching. Many took the opportunity to study art in San Miguel, where the cost of living was very low. The school had hired the muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros as a lecturer, a noted communist. He had a dispute over funding with Campanella. Most of the students supported Siqueiros, and in the end most of them walked out. The school was forced to close in 1949. The former convent of the Immaculate Conception is now home to the government-run Centro Cultural Ignacio Ram√≠rez. History View of the town center Coss√≠o returned, discovered the earlier school had been ruined, and founded a new school with the help of the former governor of Guanajuato Enrique Fern√°ndez Mart√≠nez, and Fern√°ndez's wife Nell Harris. Cossio and Fern√°ndez bought the ruined 18th century Renaissance palace that the Count of Canal had built during the silver boom, with its large grounds. They renovated the building, and also opened several cottages and a hotel for visitors. In September-October 1950, before the official opening, the Institute gave an exhibition of the work of local artists. The painter Frank Leonard Brooks and his wife, the photographer Reva Brooks, were both included in this show. Stirling Dickinson left a school he had opened in the town and became art director of the newly opened Instituto Allende. The Instituto Allende was able to grant a Master of Arts degree from its beginning by arrangement with the Universidad de Guanajuato. It was therefore recognized by several universities in the United States, which attracted students since they could earn credits in Mexico. The Italian- American painter Rico Lebrun was brought to the school as a star teacher. By 1960 the expanded institute began to offer undergraduate courses. North Americans who had studied in the Institute often returned to live in San Miguel, making the town increasingly prosperous. During the period from the 1950s to the 1970s the Instituto Allende attracted hundreds of students from the United States. Beat Generation writers including Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady spent time in the town. The New York Herald Tribune published an article that praised the institute, the low cost of living and the diversity of the students, making a point of saying \\"there is nothing Bohemian about the Instituto's group.\\" Dickinson continued to work at the Instituto Allende until retiring in 1983. By 2010 almost one tenth of the population of San Miguel, or 8,000 people, came from the United States. Program The Instituto Allende is an independent, private, non-profit organization. The faculty and office staff all speak both English and Spanish. Students may take Spanish language classes. Practical courses are given in painting, drawing, sculpture, ceramics, weaving, jewelry, photography, batik, lithography, paper making, etching, monotype printing, and silkscreen. The institute also gives classes on the history of art. Students may earn a Bachelor's degree in Visual Arts and a Master's degree in Fine arts, both recognized by many universities in North America.

She was the half- sister of Sultans Murad V, Abdul Hamid II, Mehmed V, and Mehmed VI. Early life Seniha Sultan was born on 5 December 1851 in the Old √áƒ±raƒüan Palace. Her father was Sultan Abdulmejid I and her mother was Nalandil Hanƒ±m, the daughter of Prince Natƒ±khu Bey √áƒ±pakue. She was the seventeenth daughter of her father and eldest child of her mother. She had a younger brother ≈ûehzade Mehmed Abd√ºssamed, one year younger then her and a younger sister ≈ûehime Sultan three years younger then her. Both of her parents died when she was a child. Marriage In 1876, her brother Sultan Abdul Hamid II betrothed her to Asaf Mahmud Celaleddin Pasha, a man who was two years her junior and who had a promising future, and the son of Grand Admiral Damat G√ºrc√º Halil Rifat Pasha. Her dowry was prepared with her half-sisters Behice Sultan, Mediha Sultan and Naile Sultan. The marriage contract was concluded on 5 December 1876 at the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace. However, the wedding was delayed because of the death of her elder sister Behice Sultan. The wedding finally took place on 10 February 1877. In 1878, she gave birth to her first son Sultanzade Sabahaddin Bey, and a year later to her second son Sultanzade Ahmed L√ºtfull√¢h Bey. Seniha hadn't been on good terms with Abdul Hamid for unknown reasons, and so in 1878, she and her husband, and her siblings including her brothers Prince Ahmed Kemaleddin, and Prince Selim Suleiman, and sister Princess Fatma, were all involved in the Ali Suavi incident with the objective of restoring Murad to the throne. In October 1898, she met with the German Empress Augusta Victoria in the harem of the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace, when the latter visited Istanbul for a second time with her husband Emperor Wilhelm II. Seniha Sultan's husband was very critical of her brother Abdul Hamid's governance, never missing an occasion to speak out. Eventually he had had enough of being followed and spied on, so in 1899, he took both of his sons fled to Europe, where four years later he died in Belgium and was buried in Paris. Her sons were able to return to Istanbul only in 1908, after the declaration of the second constitution. For this reason she was not particularly welcome at the palace. Character Seniha was described a woman who was political minded, and in many ways a woman ahead of her time. She used to wear dresses of the most superb cloth, with her tiara on her head on formal occasions, and she also wore gowns with long trains in the European fashion spreading out behind her. In manner, she was entirely unconstrained. Often, as did her half-sister Mediha Sultan, she would burst into laughter, and she spoke rapidly and in a deep voice. When these two sisters were together chatting with their brother Abdul Hamid, they would both laugh and try to amuse him and get him to smile as though they were in competition with one another. Seniha Sultan is known to have had performers of religious music at her palace. According to Nesli≈üah Sultan, she always dressed in black, she was thin, in fact really skinny, and had a dry skin, her niece Sabiha Sultan was really upset and sad that her aunt lives in a miserable way, whenever she visited her she kissed her hand and showed her huge respect. Exile and death At the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, Seniha was the oldest living Ottoman princess, age seventy-three. She had no money of her own, and her sons were too busy with their affairs to care of her, so she went to exile alone. Her half-brother, the deposed Sultan Mehmed VI, who went to live in San Remo gave her refuge in his home, the Villa Magnolia, where she lived until his death in 1926. After the death of Mehmed, she didn‚Äôt have enough money on her own to rent a house, and so slept in the public gardens of Cimiez, Nice, somehow her younger son L√ºtfullah figured out about his mothers way of living, he came to Nice, and took his mother to Abdulmejid II's Villa, who gave her a room in the attic. Where she lived in a miserable way. Seniha Sultan died at the Villa Carabacel on 15 September 1931 at age seventy-nine in Nice, France the last surviving child of Abdulmejid, and was buried at the Selimiye Mosque in Damascus.

Although he gave notice of resignation in August 1962, during a dispute over internal policy matters, he was persuaded to withdraw it, and continued as General Secretary until his eventual retirement in 1971.

The season runs for approximately 80 races from April through to October, with highlights including Cowes Classics Week and Cowes Week in June and August. The Daring Class Association manages the class rules carefully to ensure affordability, uniformity and close racing. The class is not often raced against other designs of yachts, as the class racing is usually competitive and well attended, however occasionally pursuit races are competed with other classes of yacht in the Solent. The Class Association has a number of strong affiliations, including with the International One Design fleet. This provides for the winner of Cowes Week each year to compete at Bermuda International Invitational Race Week in IODs. Further the class has links with foreign yacht clubs which will annually compete a team racing challenge in home or foreign waters.

They were intended to be \\"picture pieces\\", essentially \\"musical evocations of external visual stimuli\\". But Rachmaninoff did not disclose what inspired each one, stating: \\"I do not believe in the artist that discloses too much of his images. Let [the listener] paint for themselves what it most suggests.\\" However, he willingly shared sources for a few of these √©tudes with the Italian composer Ottorino Respighi when Respighi orchestrated them in 1930.  History  Rachmaninoff composed the Op. 33 √âtudes-Tableaux at his Ivanovka estate in Tambov, Russia between August and September 1911, the year after completing his second set of preludes, Op. 32. While the Op. 33 √âtudes-Tableaux share some stylistic points with the preludes, they are actually not very similar. Rachmaninoff concentrates on establishing well-defined moods and developing musical themes in the preludes. There is also an academic facet to the preludes, as he wrote 24 of them, one in each of the 24 major and minor keys. Rachmaninoff biographer Max Harrison calls the √âtudes-Tableaux \\"studies in [musical] composition\\"; while they explore a variety of themes, they \\"investigate the transformation of rather specific climates of feeling via piano textures and sonorities. They are thus less predictable than the preludes and compositionally mark an advance\\" in technique. Rachmaninoff initially wrote nine pieces for Op. 33 but published only six in 1914. One √©tude, in A minor, was subsequently revised and used in the Op. 39 set; the other two appeared posthumously and are now usually played with the other six. Performing these eight √©tudes together could be considered to run against the composer's intent, as the six originally published are unified through \\"melodic-cellular connections\\" in much the same way as in Robert Schumann's Symphonic Studies. Differing from the simplicity of the first four √©tudes, Nos. 5‚Äì8 are more virtuosic in their approach to keyboard writing, calling for unconventional hand positions, wide leaps for the fingers and considerable technical strength from the performer. Also, \\"the individual mood and passionate character of each piece\\" pose musical problems that preclude performance by those lacking strong physical technique. Numbering and character Rachmaninoff wrote nine √©tudes-tableaux at his Ivanovka estate in 1911. Six of them, the original Nos. 1‚Äì2 and 6‚Äì9, were published that year. The original No. 4 is lost; the piece was revised and published as Op. 39, No. 6. The original Nos. 3 and 5 were published posthumously within Op. 33. Probably best identified by their tempo markings and keys, the 1911 pieces are numbered by the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP) as follows,\\"Etudes-tableaux, Op.33 (Rachmaninoff, Sergei)\\", IMSLP Petrucci Music Library. leaving aside the piece that is now part of Op. 39: * Allegro non troppo in F minor ‚Äî No. 1 This study has a martial character. Rachmaninov admired the music of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, and there are often parallels between the music of the two composers. This study recalls the √âtude Op. 25, No. 4 of Chopin. * Allegro in C major ‚Äî No. 2 This study is characterized by a marked lyricism and a very expressive melody. Notice the similarity to Rachmaninoff's Prelude op. 32 no. 12, which was composed the year before, in 1910. * Grave in C minor ‚Äî No. 3 (published posthumously) This study was re-used in the Largo of Rachmaninov's Fourth Concerto, which was completed in 1926. * Moderato in D minor ‚Äî No. 4 (published posthumously, originally No. 5) This study is similar to the Prelude op. 23 No. 3 composed by Rachmaninoff in 1903, both in tone and character. It is a simple march that grows into a thing of striking contrapuntal complexity. * Non allegro‚ÄîPresto in E minor ‚Äî No. 5 (published as No. 3, originally No. 6) This study ranks among the most difficult of the opus, to play. The right hand runs constantly throughout the whole keyboard with numerous octave leaps and chromatic scales. Note some similarity to the Prelude op. 28 No. 16 and the Op. Study 25 No. 6 by Chopin. In Russia, this piece is nicknamed The Snow Storm. * Allegro con fuoco in E major ‚Äî No. 6 (published as No. 4, originally No. 7) This study has primarily a military aspect. The study concludes with a particularly virtuosic coda. Its joyous, exuberant character earned it the nickname of \\"The Fair\\", according to Rachmaninoff in his correspondence with Ottorino Resphigi. * Moderato in G minor ‚Äî No. 7 (published as No. 5, originally No. 8) This study parallels the finale of the First Ballade in G minor by Chopin. * Grave in C minor ‚Äî No. 8 (published as No. 6, originally No. 9) This study is a thundering piece with violent wavering between minor and major, as well as a bravura display at the end featuring harmonic dips and turns, chromatic runs, huge left-hand leaps, and a countermelody that emerges apparently out of nowhere. This study was one of the three in this opus that were recorded in the Melodiya studios by Sviatoslav Richter, the other two being Moderato in D minor and Non allegro‚ÄîPresto in E minor.  Arrangements  In 1929, conductor and music publisher Serge Koussevitzky asked whether Rachmaninoff would select a group of √©tudes-tableaux for Italian composer Ottorino Respighi to orchestrate. The commissioned orchestrations would be published by Koussevitzky's firm and Koussevitzky would conduct their premiere with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Rachmaninoff agreed and selected five √©tudes from Op. 33 and Op. 39. Respighi rearranged the order of √©tudes, but was otherwise faithful to the composer's intent. He gave each √©tude a distinct title from the programmatic clues Rachmaninoff had given him: # La foire (The Fair) ‚Äì (Op. 33, No. 6(7)) # La mer et les mouettes (The Sea and the Seagulls) ‚Äì (Op. 39, No. 2) # La chaperon rouge et le loup (Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf) ‚Äì (Op. 39, No. 6) # Marche fun√®bre (Funeral March) ‚Äì (Op. 39, No. 7) # Marche (March) ‚Äì (Op. 39, No. 9)  Recordings  * Complete √âtudes-Tableaux by Michael Ponti, ƒ∞dil Biret (1997), Rustem Hayroudinoff (2007), Nikolai Lugansky (1992) and Vladimir Ashkenazy * There is a popular recording that includes the originally excised numbers of Op. 33, by Vladimir Ovchinnikov on the EMI Classics label. * BBC Radio 3 chose the recording by Rustem Hayroudinoff (Chandos Records) as the finest version of the Complete √âtudes-Tableaux, in its programme Building a Library. * Jes√∫s L√≥pez-Cobos and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra recorded the Respighi orchestrations for the Telarc label. * Rachmaninoff himself recorded Op. 33, Nos. 2 and 7 (6) (electrical recording).

Biography  B√°nyai was born in 1824 to a poor salt miner in the town of V√≠zakna (now Ocna Sibiului) in Transylvania (today part of Romania) and became an equestrian in the circus. She married the lawyer and human rights activist Gyula S√°rossy, but he died a few months after the wedding from an illness. = Military years = In 1848, B√°nyai dressed in a man's uniform and enlisted in the Hungarian forces using her late husband's papers as well as his name Gyula S√°rossy. Soon she was moved to Nagyv√°rad (now Oradea), stationed with the 27th Battalion and was later promoted to sergeant. With several fellow soldiers, she helped capture 12 wagons of food in Zalatna (Zlatna), that was supposed to replenish the Austrians‚Äô food supply. For this feat she received a special commendation. Other exploits followed. > At the siege of Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (Alba Iulia), with the aid of two others, she > eavesdropped on and captured an imperial officer who came to spy on the > Hungarian camp. There was a rescue attempt on the prisoner by the Austrians, > and J√∫lia B√°nyai suffered two bayonet stab wounds in the chest during the > clash.

With her return to duty in the summer of 1849, the enemy had changed from the Austrians to the Russians. As a commander of a team she was responsible with overseeing the retreat of the Hungarian armed forces. Now known as a woman, she still engaged in combat. According to records from that time, ‚ÄúLieutenant S√°rossy‚Äù killed a Cossack in close combat, and detained several others.\\" For some assignments, she dress in women‚Äôs clothing, disguised as a French dancer to spy on the Russians, for other she posed as a soap vendor to gather news behind enemy lines. B√°nyai obtained so much valuable information that her commanding general, J√≥zef Bem, personally honored her and promoted to the rank of captain. = Turkey years = After the defeat by Austria, she emigrated to Turkey. There she married Captain Eduard Matta in 1850 and together they traveled around the Ottoman Empire. Records show they visited Istanbul, Crimea and Cyprus. In 1851-1852, B√°nyai returned to Transylvania, as a woman and using another pseudonym, to participate in the uprising there against the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She distributed leaflets and proclamations, but her group was exposed by an imperial spy. Most of her compatriots were captured and many executed, but B√°nyai managed to escape allowing her to return safely to Turkey. = Egypt years = With the collapse of their Hungarian community in Turkey, she moved with her husband to Egypt and settled in Cairo. There they opened a Hungarian restaurant and boarding house, which became a favorite of European travelers who were quizzed for fresh news of their Hungarian homeland. In 1866, B√°nyai briefly returned to Hungary so her daughter could be introduced to her homeland. B√°nyai died In Cairo at age 59, after which her husband permanently returned to Hungary. \\"The former equestrienne, who took up arms to serve her country, still rests somewhere in Egypt today.\\" References  External sources  * Magyar Nagylexikon.
