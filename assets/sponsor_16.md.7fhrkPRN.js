The school opened in 2002Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD Historic Timeline as part of the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District (CFBISD), and remains the newest high school in the district. Ranchview serves students in Irving (including portions of Las Colinas and Valley Ranch), Coppell, and Farmers Branch.Ranchview High School Attendance Area Prior to Ranchview's opening, all students living west of Interstate 35E attended R.L. Turner High School. In 2017, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency, with a 4-Star Distinction for Academic Achievements in ELA/Reading, Mathematics, Science, and Post-Secondary Readiness.TEA 2017 Accountability Reports Overview Ranchview High School is a part of CFBISD, although it is located in Valley Ranch within the city limits of Irving. The campus has a site located between Valley Ranch Parkway South, Valley Ranch Parkway East and Ranchview Drive. Ranchview started with 8th and 9th grades only when it opened in 2002. High schools in CFB-ISD do not traditionally include 8th grade, so the following year the 8th grade class became the freshman class, and 8th grade classes were moved back to Barbara Bush Middle School. The school continued its second year with 9th and 10th grades, and added a grade each year thereafter until reaching full high school status (9‚Äì12th grades) in the 2005-2006 school year. To meet the needs of a growing student population, a new classroom wing was opened in early 2016, along with a band hall, auditorium, and an expanded fine arts wing. Ranchview has an average class size of 22 students, and an approximate student-to-staff ratio of 10-to-1. Students at RHS are encouraged to become involved in extracurricular clubs and activities and join arts groups and athletic teams. The level of instructional challenge is seen in the array of Pre-Diploma, IB, and AP courses offered at Ranchview. These include Physics, Biology, Visual Art, Statistics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Calculus, History of the Americas, English, French, Spanish, and the unique IB Theory of Knowledge course. Additionally, partnerships with Northlake and Brookhaven Colleges, Texas Tech University, and The University of Texas allow students to earn college credits while still enrolled in high school. In addition to this tuition savings, the third graduating class of 150 students received over $1.2 million in scholarships. In the performing arts, students produce numerous concerts, plays, dance recitals, and art exhibitions each year. Each of the performing groups includes members who are also active in highly competitive city and regional level choirs, bands, dance and theater troupes, and orchestras. The school is also home to various athletic teams. Accreditation Ranchview High School is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Accreditation was extended through 2012 as a result of the school administration's self study and a site visit conducted in the second semester of 2006-2007. The peer review team recognized school as exemplary in quality assurance and dedication to continuous improvement. Additionally, the peer review team determined that RHS met every standard for accreditation at the highest level. Ranchview is the only high school in Carrollton-Farmers Branch to be authorized by the International Baccalaureate Organization to offer the IB Diploma Programme.

Although it lasted only a few years, the Watauga Association provided a basis for what later developed into the state of Tennessee and likely influenced other western frontier governments in the trans-Appalachian region. North Carolina annexed the Watauga settlement area, by then known as the Washington District, in November 1776. Within a year, the area was placed under a county government, becoming Washington County, North Carolina, in November 1777.Samuel Cole Williams, William Tatham, Wataugan (Johnson City, Tenn.: The Watauga Press, 1947), pp. 11‚Äì28. This area covers the present day Washington County, Carter County, and other areas now located in the northeast part of the state of Tennessee. While there is no evidence that the Watauga Association ever claimed to be outside the sovereign territory of the British Crown, historians have often cited the Association as the earliest attempt by American-born colonists to form an independent democratic government. In 1774, Virginia governor Lord Dunmore called the Watauga Association a \\"dangerous example\\" of Americans forming a government \\"distinct from and independent of his majesty's authority.\\"Samuel Cole Williams, \\"The Admission of Tennessee Into the Union.\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly Vol. IV, no. 4 (December 1945), p. 291. President Theodore Roosevelt later wrote that the Watauga settlers were the \\"first men of American birth to establish a free and independent community on the continent.\\"Paul Fink, \\"Some Phases of the History of the State of Franklin.\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly Vol. XVI, no. 3 (1957), p. 195. While no copy of the settlers' compact, known as the Articles of the Watauga Association, has ever been found, related documents tend to imply that the Watauga settlers still considered themselves British subjects, even after the initial hostilities of the American Revolution had commenced. History European settlers began arriving in the Watauga, Nolichucky, and Holston river valleys in the late 1760s and early 1770s, most migrating from Virginia via the Great Valley, although a few were believed to have been Regulators fleeing North Carolina after their defeat at the Battle of Alamance. These settlers mistakenly believed (or at least claimed to have believed) the Watauga and Nolichucky valleys were part of lands ceded to Virginia by the Cherokee in the 1770 Treaty of Lochaber, but a subsequent survey by Colonel John Donelson confirmed that these lands were still part of the Cherokee domain. As settlement on lands west of colonial boundaries violated the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Watauga and Nolichucky settlers were ordered to leave.John Finger, Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2001), pp. 43‚Äì64. In May 1772, the Watauga and Nolichucky settlers negotiated a 10-year lease directly with the Cherokee, and being outside the claims of any colony, established the Watauga Association to provide basic government functions. The lease and the subsequent purchase of these lands in 1775 were considered illegal by the British Crown, and were vehemently opposed by a growing faction of the Cherokee led by the young chief Dragging Canoe. With the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War (April 1775), the settlers organized themselves into the \\"Washington District,\\" loyal to the \\"united colonies,\\" and formed a Committee of Safety to govern it, marking the end of the so-called \\"Watauga Republic\\". In Spring of 1776, the Washington District Committee of Safety drafted a petition asking the colony of Virginia to annex the district. After Virginia refused, the Committee drafted a similar petition (dated July 5, 1776) asking the North Carolina Assembly to annex the district. In November of that year, North Carolina granted the petition and formally annexed the area. The Washington District was finally admitted to North Carolina as Washington County in November 1777. The Cherokee, who were aligned with the British, launched an all-out invasion against the settlements in July 1776, but were soundly defeated. In 1777, the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Long Island, ceding control of the Watauga and Nolichucky valleys to the American colonies.Finger, pp. 66‚Äì71. Structure Since no copy of the Articles of the Watauga Association has ever been found, most of what is known about it comes from other sources, primarily the 1776 Petition of the Inhabitants of the Washington District, commonly called the \\"Watauga Petition,\\" in which the Wataugans requested annexation by North Carolina. According to the Petition, the Articles were fashioned after the laws of Virginia and were enacted by unanimous consent of the settlers. The primary reason given for the establishment of the Watauga Association was to prevent the Watauga and Nolichucky regions from becoming a haven for debtors and felons, and for conducting \\"public business\\" such as the recording of deeds and wills. Other sources, such as the later writings of Washington District Committee of Safety clerk pro tem William Tatham (1752-1819) and documents collected by historian J. G. M. Ramsey in the mid-19th century, reveal that the Articles established a five-member court (the members of which were elected), and that the Wataugans erected a courthouse and jail at Sycamore Shoals.Samuel Cole Williams, Dawn of Tennessee Valley and Tennessee History (Johnson City, Tenn.: Watauga Press, 1937), pp. 370‚Äì377. Historians disagree over the first five magistrates of the court, although most agree that it included John Carter, James Robertson, Charles Robertson, and Zachariah Isbell. The fifth member was probably Jacob Brown. Later court members included Andrew Greer, John Roddye, and John Sevier. James Smith was probably the court's first clerk, replaced by Sevier in 1775. When Sevier was elected to the court, Felix Walker took over as clerk, with Tatham serving in his absence. Military affairs Wataugan militiamen were present at multiple engagements on the frontier and throughout the American Revolution. A company of 20 Wataugans took part in the Battle of Point Pleasant in 1774 during Lord Dunmore's War, and another contingent aided in the defense of Boonesborough and Harrodsburg later in the decade.Finger, pp. 48, 71. The Washington District Committee of Safety, created in 1775, consisted of John Carter, Zachariah Isbell, Jacob Brown, John Sevier, James Smith, James and Charles Robertson, William Bean, John Jones, George Russell, and Robert Lucas. The Committee acquired arms and oversaw the construction of Fort Watauga (initially named Fort Caswell and located at present day Elizabethton, Tennessee), where they thwarted one wing of the Cherokee invasion of July 1776. Wataugans took part in William Christian's punitive expedition and the Rutherford Light Horse expedition against the Overhill towns in the latter half of 1776. Even at the height of the Cherokee threat in the Spring and Summer of 1776, the Wataugans heeded a call to arms and dispatched a company of riflemen under Felix Walker to aide in the defense of Charleston in South Carolina. In August 1780, a small contingent led by Col. Isaac Shelby fought in the American Patriot victory at the Battle of Musgrove Mill near present-day Clinton, South Carolina. In late September 1780, the Overmountain Men--the frontier militia that crossed the Appalachian Mountains and defeated an army of British loyalists at the Battle of Kings Mountain-- mustered at Sycamore Shoals, and included 240 Wataugans under the command of Cols. John Sevier and Isaac Shelby.Pat Alderman, Overmountain Men (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 1970), pp. 81‚Äì96. After the battle, Sevier led a second punitive expedition against the Cherokee in which he destroyed the Chickamauga Cherokee villages near modern Chattanooga. At least one Wataugan, William Tatham, was present at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. Legacy The Articles of the Watauga Association likely influenced the Cumberland Compact (drafted in 1780), the main link between the two pacts being James Robertson, who in 1779 led a group of colonists into what is now the Nashville area. The Clarksville Compact, drafted for the Clarksville settlement in 1785, may have also been inspired by the Watauga Association (the Clarksville Compact even adopted the laws of Virginia, even though the settlement was clearly within the territory of North Carolina). In the mid-1780s, some former Wataugans (especially John Sevier) played a key role in the establishment of the failed State of Franklin.Samuel Cole Williams, \\"The Clarksville Compact.\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly Vol. 3, no. 3 (1944), pp. 237‚Äì247. Numerous historians in the 19th and early 20th centuries romanticized the Watauga Association as the first democratic or constitutional government formed by American-born colonists. Historian Andrew C. McLaughlin, in his first major work on the history of the U.S. Constitution, wrote of the Wataugans, \\"one can find no more striking fact in American history, nor one more typical, than the simple ease with which those frontiersmen ... formed an association and extended the rights and privileges of self-government.\\"Samuel Cole Williams, Dawn of Tennessee Valley, p. 370n. Williams cites McLaughlin's Confederation and the Constitution, p. 132. McLaughlin's colleague Claude Van Tyne wrote of the Wataugans, \\"like the Pilgrim Fathers they were without formal laws and institutions, and they made them.\\"Samuel Cole Williams, Dawn of Tennessee Valley, p. 370n. Williams cites Van Tyne's The New West, p. 274. In The Winning of the West, Theodore Roosevelt treated the Watauga Association as a microcosm of the subsequent American Revolution, writing, \\"the Watauga settlers outlined in advance the nation's work. They tamed the rugged and shaggy wilderness, they bid defiance to outside foes, and they successfully solved the difficult problem of self-government.\\"Samuel Cole Williams, Dawn of Tennessee Valley, p. 370n. Williams cites Roosevelt's The Winning of the West Vol. 1, passim. Recent historians point out that while the Watauga Association was one of the first constitutional governments west of the Appalachians, it was not intended as a government separate from the English colonies.W.

Early life  Murray Langston was born in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada and left home at the age of 15 because his parents‚Äîdisabled and financially strapped‚Äîcould not afford to raise him and his younger siblings. He lived in Montreal (Park-EX) before he emigrated to the United States by joining the United States Navy, serving as a sailor during the Vietnam War but never saw combat.

Early in his career, Langston had invested in a nightclub restaurant called \\"SHOW-BIZ.\\" Several now-famous people worked there as servers, including Debra Winger, Michael Keaton (then known as Michael Douglas), David Letterman, Gallagher, Tim Reid and Freddie Prinze; however, the club closed within two years, exhausting Langston's savings. Strapped for cash, he accepted an offer to appear on The Gong Show. He was reportedly embarrassed about appearing on the show, so‚Äîwith the director's permission‚Äîhe put a paper bag over his head with holes for his eyes and mouth, memorized a few old jokes and burst onto the show as \\"The Unknown Comic.\\" The character, a frenetic speed-jokester in smarmy attire, was a hit, and developed a cult following. \\"The Unknown Comic\\" appeared on more than 150 episodes of the Gong Show and also entertained as a celebrity judge on several other television shows. He also wrote for The Gong Show for a short time as well as appearing regularly in Las Vegas and making the rounds of many popular talk and variety shows. In the early 1980s, Langston revealed himself as \\"The Unknown Comic\\" on an episode of Real People in which the show's hosts pulled off the bag on his head. He also revealed his true identity at the conclusion of a match on the celebrity edition of the game show Bullseye. Langston later produced The Unknown Comedy Hour for Playboy TV, followed by The Sex and Violence Family Hour which starred a very young Jim Carrey. He also wrote the screenplays for the films Night Patrol (1984), which he also acted in, Up Your Alley (1988) and Wishful Thinking (1997) as well as being the co-host of The NEW Truth or Consequences (1987). He also had a role in the children's TV series E.M.U-TV (1989) as \\"Murray the Technical Director.\\" Langston reappeared as \\"The Unknown Comic\\" in the film Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002). He wrote, directed and performed in Dirty Jokes: The Movie and inspired by the hit stage show The Vagina Monologues he created and performed \\"one man's response\\" to the show, which he called The Weenie Man-o-logs.  Personal life  Twice divorced by the early 1990s, Langston went into semi-retirement from show business to concentrate on raising his daughters as a single father. His elder daughter, Myah Marie, became a singer-songwriter who had written and published more than 50 songs by the time she reached the age of 19; she was known to have recorded with notable pop stars including Britney Spears. His younger daughter Mary continued to live with Langston on their hillside ranch near the mountain town of Tehachapi, California. Since 2000, Langston occasionally appeared as a stand-up comic in Las Vegas and wrote a memoir, Journey Thru The Unknown... As of 2015, Langston was making his residence in Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada.

K√π (, variant graph ), usually referred to as D√¨ K√π (), also known as Gaoxin or GƒÅoxƒ´n Sh√¨ (), was a descendant of Huangdi, the Yellow Emperor. He went by the name Gaoxin until receiving imperial authority, when he took the name Ku and the title Di, thus being known as Di Ku. He is considered the ancestor of the ruling families of certain subsequent dynasties. Some sources treat Ku as a semi-historical figure, while others make fantastic mythological or religious claims about him. Besides varying in their degree of historicizing Ku, the various sources also differ in what specific stories about him they focus on, so that putting together the various elements of what is known regarding Ku results in a multifaceted story. Di Ku was (according to many versions of the list) one of the Five Emperors of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors of Chinese mythology. Ku, or Gaoxin, is also known as the \\"White Emperor\\".  Birth  Ku's lineage is derived from descent from the legendary Yellow Emperor, then through the line of Shaohao (as opposed to the line through Changyi, which led to Zhuanxu). He was the son of Qiaoji (), and thus grandson to Shaohao, and great-grandson to Yellow Emperor.Sima Qian, Records of the Grand Historian First ScrollCaption of the Han dynasty mural rubbing shown above: According to speculative dates calculated after 100 BC by Liu Xin, he is supposed to have ruled from c. 2436 BC to c. 2366 BC, though other dates are also mentioned.  As emperor  When he became emperor, Ku added the title Di, meaning \\"God-emperor\\", in front of his name. After achieving the imperial title, Ku was said to travel seasonally by riding a dragon in spring and summer, and a horse in autumn and winter. Among other things, Ku was said to be an inventor of musical instruments and composer of songs. According to the L√ºshi Chunqiu, drums, bells, chimes, pipes, ocarinas, and flutes were all invented, on the orders of Ku, by his subordinate Yourui; Ku's lyrics had musical scores composed by his assistant Xianhei; and by a further imperial command, a dance accompaniment was provided by a phoenix. Although Ku held the title Di, it is unclear what territory, if any, his empire might have consisted of. The same title Di was later assumed by the King of Qin, upon conquering his neighboring kingdoms and forging them into the first historically-known empire of China.  Wives and Descendants  Ku had several wives. The best-known of his consorts are four ladies: Jiang Yuan, Jiandi, Changyi, and Qingdu. Once each of these ladies had given birth to a son (Houji, Xie, Zhi, and Yao, respectively) Ku had a diviner foretell for him which of the sons was destined to rule the empire, and he received the answer that all four would. Another source mentions a lady with whom he had eight sons, each one born after she had dreamed of swallowing the sun; although her name is uncertain, she was said to be from Zoutu. Shiji also recorded the lineage names of Zhi's mother as Juzi () and Yao's mother as Chenfeng (). According to some traditions, each of these four sons inherited Ku's empire or was ancestral founder of a Chinese dynasty. The first of Ku's sons to rule the kingdom was Emperor Zhi, who was the son of Changyi. Another of his sons later became the Emperor Yao. Ku's son Xie, born miraculously to Jiandi after she swallowed the egg of a black bird, became the predynastic founder of the ruling family of the Shang dynasty. Ku's son Houji, born miraculously to Jiang Yuan after she stepped in the footprint of a god, became the predynastic founder of the lineage of the Zhou dynasty. According to Samguk Sagi, the kings of Goguryeo regarded themselves as a descendant of Chinese heroes because he called his surname \\"Go\\" (Hanja: ) as they were the descendant of Gao Yang (Hanja: ) who was a grandchild of the Yellow Emperor and Gaoxin (Hanja: ) who was a great-grandchild of Yellow Emperor.p30  Bamboo Annals  In the Bamboo Annals, one of the earliest sources, it is mentioned that when Emperor Zhuanxu died, a descendant of Shennong named Shuqi raised a disturbance, but was destroyed a descendant of Huangdi, Ku (of the Gaoxin lineage) the Prince of Xin; Ku then ascended to the throne. It also states that Ku \\"was born with double rows of teeth, and had the wisdom of a sage\\", and that he \\"made blind men beat drums, and strike bells and sounding stones, at which phoenixes flapped their wings and gambolled\\". The Annals further record that in the 16th year of his reign, he sent his general Chong to defeat the state of Yukwai. In the 45th year, Ku designated the prince of Tang (his son Yao) as his successor, however upon his death in the 63rd year, his elder son Zhi then took the throne instead, ruling 9 years before being deposed and replaced by Yao.Bamboo Annals in English  See also  *Di Jun *Dog (Chinese mythology)  Notes   References  - Category:25th-century BC rulers Category:24th-century BC rulers Category:Chinese mythology Category:Legendary rulers ","title":"Emperor Ku"},{"id":"3928471","text":"Matthew Gunn is an American writer and actor from St. Louis, Missouri.

It was one of several thrillers Raft made in the late 1940s. Plot Bookkeeper Nick Cherney is sent to jail for embezzling from Johnny Torno's trucking company. In a California prison, he sees a newsreel showing Johnny welcoming home his brother Jess, a heroic Catholic chaplain just returned from a World War II prisoner-of-war camp. Just before his release four years later (and to give himself a clever alibi), Nick hires Rocky, an inmate who has just finished his sentence, to murder Jess. Jess is staying in a local hotel room, about to depart for his first parish in another city. The brothers meet with a local priest, Father Redmond. It is during that meeting that Johnny finds out Jess is moving away. Johnny arrives at his brother's hotel room not long after Jess is shot by Rocky. Knowing that he is about to die, Jess vaguely indicates that a clue to his murderer can be found within the covers of the room's Bible. Johnny takes this to mean that the name of the killer himself is inscribed somewhere therein. However, the book is not there. For some unexplained reason, the police don't investigate the crime, deciding to instead harass Johnny of going at it alone. He tracks down and questions several strangers who occupied the same room, among them Carla North. He believes that one of them has the Bible. Once he satisfies himself that Carla is not a suspect, he hires her to help in the search, inviting her to stay at his luxury apartment, while he moves to his office. Although a bit suspicious of Johnny's motives, Carla agrees. While Johnny is questioning another hotel guest, he notices Rocky watching him. Setting a trap, he lets Rocky see him buying a book from the former guest and wrapping it up, then leaves it lying around while he gets his shoes shined. When Rocky steals the book, Johnny catches him and reveals that it is just a cookbook. Rocky manages to escape, though Johnny wounds him slightly with his gun. Later, aboard a train back to town, Rocky tells Nick that he is through, and that he intends to blackmail Nick. Nick sucker punches him, causing him to fall off the rear of a moving train. Then, Nick goes to Torno's office to witness the search of the Gideon Bible found earlier by Carla. When Johnny finally locates the missing Gideon Bible, he finds written within not information about the killer's identity, but a plea from his brother not to seek revenge. Nick thinks he is off the hook. Relieved, he turns to leave. However, when he gets to the head of the stairs, he spots Rocky on the floor below. In a shootout, Nick fatally wounds Rocky, but before he dies, Rocky identifies Nick as the mastermind behind Jess's murder. Johnny pursues Nick to the roof, out in a rainstorm. Nick accidentally steps on the main power supply to Torno's huge neon sign and is electrocuted.

Roy Del Ruth and his associate Joe Kaufman brought the film rights in May 1946 from writer Donald Barry and Producer Lou Rock. The originally announced wanting Frank Sinatra to play the lead. Roy Del Ruth set up his production company at Monogram Pictures, who were trying to expand into more prestigious product. Del Ruth made It Happened on Fifth Avenue for them, one of Monogram's most expensive pictures to date. He was meant to follow it with Mr Gideon but the project was delayed. The story was retitled Red Light after a survey. Del Ruth started doing background filming in San Francisco in June 1947. However it was a while before filming of the actual movie began. Monogram formed a subsidiary, Allied Artists, who would distribute their more prestigious movies. Del Ruth made The Babe Ruth Story for Allied Artists and they announced they would finance Red Light. Del Ruth wanted Edward G. Robinson, William Bendix and Charles Bickford for the main roles. He thought the budget would be around $1.25 to 1.5 million. In September 1948 Joseph Kaufman, who worked for Del Ruth, said they were trying to get Robert Ryan to play the lead. In January 1949 it was announced that Monogram and United Artists had signed a deal whereby United Artists would distribute Red Light and another movie Gun Crazy. The films would be financed by Pioneer Pictures, a new company which Monogram half owned, the other half being owned by Eastern investors. George Raft was announced as star. Virginia Mayo was borrowed to play the female lead. Raft was paid $65,000 for his role. He signed in February 1949 and filming started in March. The production manager, Joe Gilpin, died of a heart attack during filming. Reception =Critical response= The Los Angeles Times said the film \\"generates suspense and promises to emerge as a taut, exciting melodrama\\" but that it was let down by its \\"religious reform theme\\". The New York Times said the film was \\"in the main, a contest familiar to Raft's retinue of fans, complete with hard, laconic characters, a search for a culprit, a few fireworks and with the Word in the Good Book as its sole, extraordinary twist.\\" Film critic Dennis Schwartz said of the film, \\"Roy Del Ruth directs a routine film noir infused with themes of revenge and religion, as it veers more towards a regular crime drama except for photographic flashes that reveal the film's dark undertones. The film's classic noir shot is of the villainous Raymond Burr smoking and smiling as his frightened victim is being crushed to death while hiding under a trailer, as Burr has just kicked out the jack holding it up ... The film held my interest mainly because this was a perfect part for Raft and it was well-crafted.\\"Schwartz, Dennis. Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, March 21, 2004.

The goal of hyperspectral imaging is to obtain the spectrum for each pixel in the image of a scene, with the purpose of finding objects, identifying materials, or detecting processes. There are three general branches of spectral imagers. There are push broom scanners and the related whisk broom scanners (spatial scanning), which read images over time, band sequential scanners (spectral scanning), which acquire images of an area at different wavelengths, and snapshot hyperspectral imaging, which uses a staring array to generate an image in an instant. Whereas the human eye sees color of visible light in mostly three bands (long wavelengths - perceived as red, medium wavelengths - perceived as green, and short wavelengths - perceived as blue), spectral imaging divides the spectrum into many more bands. This technique of dividing images into bands can be extended beyond the visible. In hyperspectral imaging, the recorded spectra have fine wavelength resolution and cover a wide range of wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging measures continuous spectral bands, as opposed to multispectral imaging which measures spaced spectral bands. Engineers build hyperspectral sensors and processing systems for applications in astronomy, agriculture, molecular biology, biomedical imaging, geosciences, physics, and surveillance. Hyperspectral sensors look at objects using a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Certain objects leave unique 'fingerprints' in the electromagnetic spectrum. Known as spectral signatures, these 'fingerprints' enable identification of the materials that make up a scanned object. For example, a spectral signature for oil helps geologists find new oil fields.  Hyperspectral image sensors  Figuratively speaking, hyperspectral sensors collect information as a set of 'images'. Each image represents a narrow wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum, also known as a spectral band. These 'images' are combined to form a three-dimensional (x,y,Œª) hyperspectral data cube for processing and analysis, where x and y represent two spatial dimensions of the scene, and Œª represents the spectral dimension (comprising a range of wavelengths). Technically speaking, there are four ways for sensors to sample the hyperspectral cube: Spatial scanning, spectral scanning, snapshot imaging,http://www.bodkindesign.com/wp- content/uploads/2012/09/Hyperspectral-1011.pdf and spatio-spectral scanning. Hyperspectral cubes are generated from airborne sensors like the NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), or from satellites like NASA's EO-1 with its hyperspectral instrument Hyperion.Schurmer, J.H., (Dec 2003), Air Force Research Laboratories Technology Horizons However, for many development and validation studies, handheld sensors are used.Ellis, J., (Jan 2001) Searching for oil seeps and oil-impacted soil with hyperspectral imagery , Earth Observation Magazine. The precision of these sensors is typically measured in spectral resolution, which is the width of each band of the spectrum that is captured. If the scanner detects a large number of fairly narrow frequency bands, it is possible to identify objects even if they are only captured in a handful of pixels. However, spatial resolution is a factor in addition to spectral resolution. If the pixels are too large, then multiple objects are captured in the same pixel and become difficult to identify. If the pixels are too small, then the energy captured by each sensor cell is low, and the decreased signal-to-noise ratio reduces the reliability of measured features. The acquisition and processing of hyperspectral images is also referred to as imaging spectroscopy or, with reference to the hyperspectral cube, as 3D spectroscopy.  Technologies for hyperspectral data acquisition  Photos illustrating individual sensor outputs for the four hyperspectral imaging techniques. From left to right: Slit spectrum; monochromatic spatial map; 'perspective projection' of hyperspectral cube; wavelength-coded spatial map. There are four basic techniques for acquiring the three-dimensional (x,y,Œª) dataset of a hyperspectral cube. The choice of technique depends on the specific application, seeing that each technique has context-dependent advantages and disadvantages. = Spatial scanning = Acquisition techniques for hyperspectral imaging, visualized as sections of the hyperspectral datacube with its two spatial dimensions (x,y) and one spectral dimension (lambda). In spatial scanning, each two-dimensional (2-D) sensor output represents a full slit spectrum (x,Œª). Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) devices for spatial scanning obtain slit spectra by projecting a strip of the scene onto a slit and dispersing the slit image with a prism or a grating. These systems have the drawback of having the image analyzed per lines (with a push broom scanner) and also having some mechanical parts integrated into the optical train. With these line-scan systems, the spatial dimension is collected through platform movement or scanning. This requires stabilized mounts or accurate pointing information to ‚Äòreconstruct‚Äô the image. Nonetheless, line- scan systems are particularly common in remote sensing, where it is sensible to use mobile platforms. Line-scan systems are also used to scan materials moving by on a conveyor belt. A special case of line scanning is point scanning (with a whisk broom scanner), where a point-like aperture is used instead of a slit, and the sensor is essentially one-dimensional instead of 2-D. = Spectral scanning = In spectral scanning, each 2-D sensor output represents a monochromatic ('single-colored'), spatial (x,y) map of the scene. HSI devices for spectral scanning are typically based on optical band-pass filters (either tunable or fixed). The scene is spectrally scanned by exchanging one filter after another while the platform remains stationary. In such 'staring', wavelength scanning systems, spectral smearing can occur if there is movement within the scene, invalidating spectral correlation/detection. Nonetheless, there is the advantage of being able to pick and choose spectral bands, and having a direct representation of the two spatial dimensions of the scene. If the imaging system is used on a moving platform, such as an airplane, acquired images at different wavelengths corresponds to different areas of the scene. The spatial features on each of the images may be used to realign the pixels. = Non-scanning = In non- scanning, a single 2-D sensor output contains all spatial (x,y) and spectral (Œª) data. HSI devices for non-scanning yield the full datacube at once, without any scanning. Figuratively speaking, a single snapshot represents a perspective projection of the datacube, from which its three-dimensional structure can be reconstructed. The most prominent benefits of these snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems are the snapshot advantage (higher light throughput) and shorter acquisition time. A number of systems have been designed, including computed tomographic imaging spectrometry (CTIS), fiber- reformatting imaging spectrometry (FRIS), integral field spectroscopy with lenslet arrays (IFS-L), multi-aperture integral field spectrometer (Hyperpixel Array), integral field spectroscopy with image slicing mirrors (IFS-S), image- replicating imaging spectrometry (IRIS), filter stack spectral decomposition (FSSD), coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI), image mapping spectrometry (IMS), and multispectral Sagnac interferometry (MSI). However, computational effort and manufacturing costs are high. In an effort to reduce the computational demands and potentially the high cost of non-scanning hyperspectral instrumentation, prototype devices based on Multivariate Optical Computing have been demonstrated. These devices have been based on the Multivariate Optical Element spectral calculation engine or the Spatial Light Modulator spectral calculation engine. In these platforms, chemical information is calculated in the optical domain prior to imaging such that the chemical image relies on conventional camera systems with no further computing. As a disadvantage of these systems, no spectral information is ever acquired, i.e. only the chemical information, such that post processing or reanalysis is not possible. = Spatiospectral scanning = In spatiospectral scanning, each 2-D sensor output represents a wavelength-coded ('rainbow- colored', Œª=Œª(y)), spatial (x,y) map of the scene. A prototype for this technique, introduced in 2014, consists of a camera at some non-zero distance behind a basic slit spectroscope (slit + dispersive element). Advanced spatiospectral scanning systems can be obtained by placing a dispersive element before a spatial scanning system. Scanning can be achieved by moving the whole system relative to the scene, by moving the camera alone, or by moving the slit alone. Spatiospectral scanning unites some advantages of spatial and spectral scanning, thereby alleviating some of their disadvantages.  Distinguishing hyperspectral from multispectral imaging  Multispectral and hyperspectral differences Hyperspectral imaging is part of a class of techniques commonly referred to as spectral imaging or spectral analysis. Hyperspectral imaging is related to multispectral imaging. The distinction between hyper- and multi-spectral is sometimes based incorrectly on an arbitrary \\"number of bands\\" or on the type of measurement. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) uses continuous and contiguous ranges of wavelengths (e.g. 400 - 1100 nm in steps of 1 nm) whilst multispectral imaging (MSI) uses a subset of targeted wavelengths at chosen locations (e.g. 400 - 1100 nm in steps of 20 nm). Multispectral imaging deals with several images at discrete and somewhat narrow bands. Being \\"discrete and somewhat narrow\\" is what distinguishes multispectral imaging in the visible wavelength from color photography. A multispectral sensor may have many bands covering the spectrum from the visible to the longwave infrared. Multispectral images do not produce the \\"spectrum\\" of an object. Landsat is an excellent example of multispectral imaging. Hyperspectral deals with imaging narrow spectral bands over a continuous spectral range, producing the spectra of all pixels in the scene. A sensor with only 20 bands can also be hyperspectral when it covers the range from 500 to 700 nm with 20 bands each 10 nm wide. (While a sensor with 20 discrete bands covering the visible, near, short wave, medium wave and long wave infrared would be considered multispectral.) Ultraspectral could be reserved for interferometer type imaging sensors with a very fine spectral resolution. These sensors often have (but not necessarily) a low spatial resolution of several pixels only, a restriction imposed by the high data rate.  Applications  Hyperspectral remote sensing is used in a wide array of applications. Although originally developed for mining and geology (the ability of hyperspectral imaging to identify various minerals makes it ideal for the mining and oil industries, where it can be used to look for ore and oil),Smith, R.B. (July 14, 2006), Introduction to hyperspectral imaging with TMIPS , MicroImages Tutorial Web site it has now spread into fields as widespread as ecology and surveillance, as well as historical manuscript research, such as the imaging of the Archimedes Palimpsest. This technology is continually becoming more available to the public. Organizations such as NASA and the USGS have catalogues of various minerals and their spectral signatures, and have posted them online to make them readily available for researchers. On a smaller scale, NIR hyperspectral imaging can be used to rapidly monitor the application of pesticides to individual seeds for quality control of the optimum dose and homogeneous coverage. = Agriculture = Hyperspectral camera embedded on OnyxStar HYDRA-12 UAV from AltiGator Although the cost of acquiring hyperspectral images is typically high, for specific crops and in specific climates, hyperspectral remote sensing use is increasing for monitoring the development and health of crops. In Australia, work is under way to use imaging spectrometers to detect grape variety and develop an early warning system for disease outbreaks. Furthermore, work is underway to use hyperspectral data to detect the chemical composition of plants,Ferwerda, J.G. (2005), Charting the quality of forage: measuring and mapping the variation of chemical components in foliage with hyperspectral remote sensing, Wageningen University, ITC Dissertation 126, 166p. which can be used to detect the nutrient and water status of wheat in irrigated systems.Tilling, A.K., et al., (2006) Remote sensing to detect nitrogen and water stress in wheat, The Australian Society of Agronomy On a smaller scale, NIR hyperspectral imaging can be used to rapidly monitor the application of pesticides to individual seeds for quality control of the optimum dose and homogeneous coverage. Another application in agriculture is the detection of animal proteins in compound feeds to avoid bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad-cow disease. Different studies have been done to propose alternative tools to the reference method of detection, (classical microscopy). One of the first alternatives is near infrared microscopy (NIR), which combines the advantages of microscopy and NIR. In 2004, the first study relating this problem with hyperspectral imaging was published.Fern√°ndez Pierna, J.A., et al., 'Combination of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Near Infrared (NIR) imaging spectroscopy for the detection of meat and bone meat (MBM) in compound feeds' Journal of Chemometrics 18 (2004) 341-349 Hyperspectral libraries that are representative of the diversity of ingredients usually present in the preparation of compound feeds were constructed. These libraries can be used together with chemometric tools to investigate the limit of detection, specificity and reproducibility of the NIR hyperspectral imaging method for the detection and quantification of animal ingredients in feed. = Eye care = Researchers at the Universit√© de Montr√©al are working with Photon etc. and Optina Diagnostics to test the use of hyperspectral photography in the diagnosis of retinopathy and macular edema before damage to the eye occurs. The metabolic hyperspectral camera will detect a drop in oxygen consumption in the retina, which indicates potential disease. An ophthalmologist will then be able to treat the retina with injections to prevent any potential damage. = Food processing = A line scan push-broom system was used to scan the cheeses and images were acquired using a Hg-Cd-Te array (386x288) equipped linescan camera with halogen light as a radiation source. In the food processing industry, hyperspectral imaging, combined with intelligent software, enables digital sorters (also called optical sorters) to identify and remove defects and foreign material (FM) that are invisible to traditional camera and laser sorters. By improving the accuracy of defect and FM removal, the food processor‚Äôs objective is to enhance product quality and increase yields. Adopting hyperspectral imaging on digital sorters achieves non-destructive, 100 percent inspection in-line at full production volumes. The sorter‚Äôs software compares the hyperspectral images collected to user-defined accept/reject thresholds, and the ejection system automatically removes defects and foreign material. Hyperspectral image of \\"sugar end\\" potato strips shows invisible defects The recent commercial adoption of hyperspectral sensor-based food sorters is most advanced in the nut industry where installed systems maximize the removal of stones, shells and other foreign material (FM) and extraneous vegetable matter (EVM) from walnuts, pecans, almonds, pistachios, peanuts and other nuts. Here, improved product quality, low false reject rates and the ability to handle high incoming defect loads often justify the cost of the technology. Commercial adoption of hyperspectral sorters is also advancing at a fast pace in the potato processing industry where the technology promises to solve a number of outstanding product quality problems. Work is underway to use hyperspectral imaging to detect ‚Äúsugar ends,‚Äù ‚Äúhollow heart‚Äù and ‚Äúcommon scab,‚Äù conditions that plague potato processors. = Mineralogy = A set of stones is scanned with a Specim LWIR-C imager in the thermal infrared range from 7.7 Œºm to 12.4 Œºm. The quartz and feldspar spectra are clearly recognizable. Geological samples, such as drill cores, can be rapidly mapped for nearly all minerals of commercial interest with hyperspectral imaging. Fusion of SWIR and LWIR spectral imaging is standard for the detection of minerals in the feldspar, silica, calcite, garnet, and olivine groups, as these minerals have their most distinctive and strongest spectral signature in the LWIR regions.Holma, H., (May 2011), Thermische Hyperspektralbildgebung im langwelligen Infrarot , Photonik Hyperspectral remote sensing of minerals is well developed. Many minerals can be identified from airborne images, and their relation to the presence of valuable minerals, such as gold and diamonds, is well understood. Currently, progress is towards understanding the relationship between oil and gas leakages from pipelines and natural wells, and their effects on the vegetation and the spectral signatures. Recent work includes the PhD dissertations of WerffWerff H. (2006), Knowledge based remote sensing of complex objects: recognition of spectral and spatial patterns resulting from natural hydrocarbon seepages, Utrecht University, ITC Dissertation 131, 138p. and Noomen.Noomen, M.F.

The infrared spectra of the different objects such as the watch glass have clearly distinctive characteristics. The contrast level indicates the temperature of the object. This image was produced with a Specim LWIR hyperspectral imager. Hyperspectral surveillance is the implementation of hyperspectral scanning technology for surveillance purposes. Hyperspectral imaging is particularly useful in military surveillance because of countermeasures that military entities now take to avoid airborne surveillance. The idea that drives hyperspectral surveillance is that hyperspectral scanning draws information from such a large portion of the light spectrum that any given object should have a unique spectral signature in at least a few of the many bands that are scanned. The SEALs from NSWDG who killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011 used this technology while conducting the raid (Operation Neptune's Spear) on Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Hyperspectral imaging has also shown potential to be used in facial recognition purposes. Facial recognition algorithms using hyperspectral imaging have been shown to perform better than algorithms using traditional imaging. Traditionally, commercially available thermal infrared hyperspectral imaging systems have needed liquid nitrogen or helium cooling, which has made them impractical for most surveillance applications. In 2010, Specim introduced a thermal infrared hyperspectral camera that can be used for outdoor surveillance and UAV applications without an external light source such as the sun or the moon.Frost&Sullivan;, Technical Insights, Aerospace&Defence; (Feb 2011): World First Thermal Hyperspectral Camera for Unmanned Aerial VehiclesSpecim's Owl sees an invisible object and identifies its materials even in a pitch-dark night . = Astronomy = In astronomy, hyperspectral imaging is used to determine a spatially-resolved spectral image. Since a spectrum is an important diagnostic, having a spectrum for each pixel allows more science cases to be addressed. In astronomy, this technique is commonly referred to as integral field spectroscopy, and examples of this technique include FLAMES and SINFONI on the Very Large Telescope, but also the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer on Chandra X-ray Observatory uses this technique.

The translucent gray rectangle indicates the position of the stack. The horizontal line at row 12 between columns 64-128 indicate the pixels used to estimate the background spectrum. Measurements made with the Telops Hyper-Cam. Most countries require continuous monitoring of emissions produced by coal and oil-fired power plants, municipal and hazardous waste incinerators, cement plants, as well as many other types of industrial sources. This monitoring is usually performed using extractive sampling systems coupled with infrared spectroscopy techniques. Some recent standoff measurements performed allowed the evaluation of the air quality but not many remote independent methods allow for low uncertainty measurements.  Data Compression  In February 2019, an organization founded by the world's major space industries, the Consultative Committee for Space Data Standards (CCSDS), approved a standard for both lossless and near-lossless compression of multispectral and hyperspectral images (CCSDS 123). Based on NASA's fast-lossless algorithm, it requires very low memory and computational resources compared to alternatives, such as JPEG 2000. Commercial implementations of CCSDS 123 include: * The European Space Agency's SHyLoC IP core, for lossless compression of up to 1 Gpbs. * Metaspectral for both lossless and near-lossless compression, achieving throughputs of over 14 Gbps.  Advantages and disadvantages  The primary advantage to hyperspectral imaging is that, because an entire spectrum is acquired at each point, the operator needs no prior knowledge of the sample, and postprocessing allows all available information from the dataset to be mined. Hyperspectral imaging can also take advantage of the spatial relationships among the different spectra in a neighbourhood, allowing more elaborate spectral-spatial models for a more accurate segmentation and classification of the image.A. Picon, O. Ghita, P.F. Whelan, P. Iriondo (2009), Spectral and Spatial Feature Integration for Classification of Non- ferrous Materials in Hyper-spectral Data, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS, VOL. 5, NO. 4, NOVEMBER 2009 The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity. Fast computers, sensitive detectors, and large data storage capacities are needed for analyzing hyperspectral data. Significant data storage capacity is necessary since uncompressed hyperspectral cubes are large, multidimensional datasets, potentially exceeding hundreds of megabytes. All of these factors greatly increase the cost of acquiring and processing hyperspectral data. Also, one of the hurdles researchers have had to face is finding ways to program hyperspectral satellites to sort through data on their own and transmit only the most important images, as both transmission and storage of that much data could prove difficult and costly. As a relatively new analytical technique, the full potential of hyperspectral imaging has not yet been realized.

As Sakai was the only member who stayed in the group while others joined and left regularly, Zard and Sakai may be referred to interchangeably. She was the best-selling female recording artist of the 1990s and has sold over 37 million copies of sales, making her one of the best- selling music artists in Japan of all time.  Biography  Born in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa, Sakai grew up in Hadano, Kanagawa. Her father was a driving instructor, and she had a younger brother and younger sister. After her death, a neighbor recalled how popular and beautiful Sakai had been in elementary school. She was also athletic, joining the track and field team in junior high and playing tennis in high school. Graduating from Shoin Women's College (now Shoin University) in Atsugi City, Kanagawa, Sakai worked in a real estate company office for two years before being scouted by Stardust Promotion. Throughout her life, Sakai remained with her family, living modestly and mostly out of the public eye. Upon achieving career success, she helped pay for her parents home renovation. Acquaintances say that she commuted by subway every day, often wore T-shirts and minimal makeup. She did not wear any makeup in all seven of the television appearances she made in her lifetime. In promoting her third single, \\"M≈ç Sagasanai,\\" and first album, Good-bye My Loneliness on February 6, 1991, she wore glasses in the television interview, citing the fact she had not slept the night before. She also indicated that she often slept in the morning rather than the evening. Sakai had a well- rounded personality. She began playing the piano at age four and aspired to be a musician at a very young age. She visited galleries, attended theater productions, made dry flowers, and painted in oil in her spare time. She also stated that one reason she did not like to travel was that she was not accustomed to eating sashimi and preferred cooked food. Because she was hardly ever seen in public, there were widespread conspiracy theories in Japan that works by Zard were not produced by the woman pictured (Sakai): She was referred to as an urban legend. Sakai appears to have been shy. In her first appearance on Music Station, she was asked what took Zard so long to appear on camera. She replied that she wanted to make sure that the Zard project would in fact succeed first. In the other six interviews, Sakai expresses shyness on camera. In fact, a staff member revealed that when Sakai saw so many people lining up for her concert tour in 2004, she was taken aback and hid herself. After some effort, she was able to walk up to the crowd and thank them for coming. However, her shyness did not reflect an inability to work well with others. It has been noted that after she had gone home early one day she arranged for food to be sent to her staff at her office who were working late into the evening. = Professional career = For the next two years following her scouting, she was a Toei \\"karaoke queen\\" and a promotional model appearing in television commercials for Japan Air System. The following year Sakai was a Nissin race queen. In 1990, Daiko Nagato, a music producer for Being Corporation, noted her potential as a singer-songwriter. Through this connection, she created a Being subsidiary called Sensui (same Kanji characters as Izumi) and started her career taking the name Izumi Sakai. In addition to taking a new name, Sakai revised her year of birth from 1967 to 1969. In 1991, Sakai joined the five-member pop group Zard as lead vocalist. The group name did not have any particular meaning except Sakai felt that word Zard sounded like a rock group. She also took the name as derived from words such as \\"blizzard\\" and \\"wizard.\\" The group's name very quickly became synonymous with Sakai herself, and Sakai wrote the lyrics to all of Zard's songs except Onna de Itai and Koionna no Yuuutsu, both of which were written by Daria Kawashima. By 1993, the four male band members left the group but Sakai chose to keep the Zard name throughout her career. Izumi Sakai was Zard's sole member at the time of the band's debut, although between late 1991 and early 1993 four other members were introduced. The melodies of early Zard hits were written by prominent Japanese composers, most notably Seiichir≈ç Kuribayashi and Tetsur≈ç Oda. Izumi Sakai wrote nearly all of the lyrics to Zard songs, totalling over one hundred fifty. A veteran recording producer described that while most artists communicate through the transparent glass in the recording studio, Sakai preferred covering the glass with a curtain. Her 1991 first single, \\"Good-bye My Loneliness,\\" sold very well, but her next two faltered. The Good-bye My Loneliness promotion video depicts a youthful and energetic Sakai. A decade after her debut, she listed this song as one of her most memorable pieces, especially because she had to sing it over a hundred times to get the recording right.Pre-recorded statement, NHK Music Square, February 2001 . Retrieved October 23, 2007. Her fourth single, \\"Nemurenai Yoru o Daite\\" (Hold me through the sleepless night) was extremely successful, leading to four television appearances. And her best was still to come. On January 27, 1993, Izumi Sakai released her sixth single \\"Makenaide\\", which appealed to the Japanese public. Released at a time that is now seen as the beginning of Japan's post economic bubble era when the Nikkei 225 Index had shrunk in value by a third in only three years, \\"Makenaide\\" (Don't Give Up) became known as the theme song of the country's Lost Decade.\\" While Sakai commented on the television show Music Station that it would be a song to encourage men taking college and company employment examinations, many people said this song helped them cope with difficult issues such as school bullying. What is notable about \\"Makenaide\\" is that Zard fans' favorite phrase, \\"Run through Until the End\\" was originally \\"Do Not Give Up until the End\\". \\"Makenaide\\" has been used as a theme song for the Nippon Television program 24-hour TV, an annual charity program hosted live by celebrities for a whole day. Sakai said that she was honored and looked forward to watching 24-hour TV. Overall, \\"Makenaide\\" sold nearly 2 million copies. Sakai produced 42 singles as well as 11 albums and 5 compilations in her lifetime. In addition to \\"Makenaide,\\" she produced two other singles that sold over a million copies. Six of her albums as well as her first three compilations also surpassed the one-million mark. Sakai's CD sales had been in decline since 2000, but her death triggered an increase in CD sales. = Television appearances = * Music Station (TV Asahi), \\"Nemurenai Yoru o Daite,\\" August 7, 1992 * Music Station (TV Asahi), \\"Nemurenai Yoru o Daite,\\" August 28, 1992 * Sound Arena (Fuji TV), \\"Nemurenai Yoru o Daite,\\" September 1992 * Music Station (TV Asahi), \\"Nemurenai Yoru o Daite,\\" September 18, 1992 * MJ-Music Journal (Fuji TV), \\"In My Arms Tonight,\\" October 1992 * Music Station (TV Asahi), \\"In My Arms Tonight,\\" October 6, 1992 * Music Station (TV Asahi), \\"Makenaide,\\" February 5, 1993 = Significance = The NHK program Close Up Gendai reported on June 18, 2007, that the secret to Sakai's success was that she hardly was seen in public, which created a mystic aura. = Death = Despite her healthy lifestyle, which included abstaining from tobacco and alcohol, Sakai was seriously ill at times. According to the Kitto Wasurenai Official book, she had to stop her career temporarily due to various uterus- related illnesses in 2001, and did not begin working full-time until 2003. In June 2006, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, for which she immediately underwent treatment. She appeared to have healed, but discovered that her cancer had spread to her lungs, indicating a Stage 4 cancer. She began undergoing treatment at Keio University Hospital in April 2007 but she never fully recovered. However, Sakai was neither discouraged nor thought she was dying. After her death, the Japanese weekly magazine Friday ran an interview in which said Sakai thought that modern treatments would enable her to live long. Her mother said that she greeted her visitors cheerfully and did not seem to show the effects of her illness. A fellow patient later said that they walked together at times and Sakai sang \\"Makenaide\\" for her when she could not walk. Finally, Sakai sent an e-mail to her staff saying that she was anxious to go back to producing music and was looking forward to another concert in late 2007. Sakai died on May 27, 2007. Police judged her death accidental, the result of a fall from the landing of an emergency-exit slope at Keio University Hospital, where she was undergoing chemotherapy. The slope appeared to be very slippery due to rain the day before. According to police, the fall took place during a walk on the morning of May 26, 2007, from a height of about 3 meters (about 9 feet and 10 inches). Sakai was discovered unconscious at around 5:40 a.m. by a passer-by and taken to the emergency room, where she died the following afternoon of head injuries. Due to the unusual and unlikely nature of her death, police investigated for possibility of suicide, but concluded that it was indeed an accident. In the Friday article, her mother said that she took walks in rehabilitation and the location where she fell was her favorite place to meditate. Sakai had been planning to release a new album in fall 2007, as well as launch her first live tour in three years. She was 40. Her family was at her side, but it was reported that she never regained consciousness. Epilogue: After Sakai's death The sudden news of Sakai's death caused an uproar in the Japanese music industry and began to dominate headlines and the \\"what's new\\" spaces on many major music websites. Music Station, a TV program, did a four-minute tribute to her during its June 1, 2007 broadcast. Due to viewer request, another tribute was aired a week later. The was released on August 15, 2007. This book contains tracks of 16 years by \\"Izumi Sakai's poetry\\" and \\"Comments of the staff who have helped ZARD\\". The book records that she was informed two days before she died, and that Sakai was encouraged by the news that she was selected. Furthermore, the day before she died, Sakai told a producer who had been with her for 16 years that she was looking forward to have a recording machine at her home so she could start working upon discharge from hospital. = Public and private memorial services = A closed memorial service was held on June 26 at a funeral hall in Aoyama, Tokyo for members of the entertainment industry. This was attended by celebrities such as Maki Ohguro (another female vocalist who, like Sakai, rarely appears in public and writes most of her own material, but started off being Sakai's phantom singer). Almost as if to illustrate Sakai's impact on the Japanese music scene and the depth of her presence, singers Tak Matsumoto and Koshi Inaba, members of the popular B'z group, pop-singer Mai Kuraki, and even baseball giant Shigeo Nagashima all left moving messages of their encounters with Sakai. Singers Hikaru Utada and Nanase Aikawa, though not personally acquainted with Sakai, also issued memorial statements on their official web pages, describing how Sakai's death had shocked them. A public memorial service for Sakai was held the next day and was attended by some 40,000 people from all over Japan. = What a Beautiful Memory concert tours = A series of memorial concerts were held at Osaka's Festival on September 6 and 7, as well as September 14 in Tokyo's Nippon Budokan, called What a Beautiful Memory. Tickets sold out immediately and 15,000 people gathered for the Tokyo event. Sakai's favorite microphone was placed center-stage, and a recording of Sakai's comments about her thoughts toward the lyrics from 2004 was played. Over 20 members of Sakai's band, who had come together again just for this occasion, began playing \\"Yureru Omoi\\". During the intermezzo, video images of the dressing room were shown, showing how staff had set it up in the same way Sakai used it during her What a Beautiful Moment concert tour. The door was labeled \\"Ms. Sakai Izumi\\" and the room had a clipboard displaying the day's schedule; lunch boxes were also prepared and laid out on a coffee table. The band went on to perform 34 songs, ending with \\"Makenaide.\\" When \\"Makenaide\\" ended, Sakai's recorded voice was played back to the sold-out crowd: \\"Thank you for coming today. I look forward to seeing you all again!\\" A portion of the proceeds from the concerts were donated to help fund cervical cancer research. On the stage, nine giant screens showed more previously unreleased off-screen footage of Sakai, excerpts from 10,000 VHS tape recordings of Sakai in off-screen footage that her staff discovered after her death. In the encore of the memorial concerts, the music staff displayed some 300 songs in notebooks hand-written by Sakai that were found after she died. = Posthumous single: \\"Glorious Mind\\" = \\"Glorious Mind\\" was released as a posthumous CD single on December 12, 2007. The song was used as the theme song of Detective Conan, Sakai's favorite Japanese anime. The song was broadcast with the episode airing on October 15. = What a Beautiful Memory Concert Tour 2008 = Sakai's office announced that there will be a nationwide tour to follow the What a Beautiful Memory tour. Announced on November 16, 2007, through Zard's official website, it will consist of 15 concerts at 13 locations in early 2008. The first concert will be at Kobe's International Forum on January 19 and the final one will commemorate the first anniversary of Sakai's death at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium in Yoyogi on May 27. None of the concerts will take place at the Tokyo International Forum, where the \\"What a Beautiful Moment\\" DVD was mainly recorded, or at Nippon Budokan. Additional previously unreleased footage of Sakai will be shown throughout the tour.

It was to fill Dodge's product offer in the mid-price full-size market segment, as well as to help fill the void in Chrysler's lineup left by the discontinuation of DeSoto in 1961. Origins The Custom 880 was developed to fill consumer demand for a full-size Dodge passenger car during the 1962 model year. The 1962 Dodges introduced in the fall of 1961 had their origins in a rumor heard by a Chrysler executive that Chevrolet was planning to downsize their full-sized automobiles for the 1962 model year. Not wanting Chrysler to play catch-up, and wanting to beat Chevrolet at its own game, Plymouth and Dodge designs were placed in an emergency downsizing program that took the previously approved full-size designs and shrank them to smaller vehicles that would compete head-to-head with the rumored smaller Chevrolet. But to Chrysler's shock and dismay, Chevrolet's 1962 full-size lineup emerged slightly larger than the 1961 models, with the mid-range Chevrolet Bel Air (on a wheelbase) growing a longer in its body, although the car weighed less than its 1961 predecessor. The rumored \\"small Chevrolet\\" turned out to be the new GM \\"X\\" body Chevy II compact, which was intended to bolster Chevy's position where the Corvair had faltered in that segment of the market. The \\"full-size\\" Dodge Polara and Dart that emerged for 1962 were built on a shorter () wheelbase and were shorter overall than the comparable Chevrolet, placing Dodge in the precarious position with consumers of not offering a true full-sized automobile. Ford also brought their new intermediate- or mid-size Ford Fairlane and Mercury Meteor to market for 1962 with a wheelbase ( on all Meteors but wagons). They were roughly the same size as the new standard-size Dodges, which made the new Mopars intermediates by default. The AMC Rambler was also similarly sized and was introduced to North America in 1961. Compounding the size issue were the designs themselves, which did not translate well from their full-size origins to what amounted to intermediate size. The proposed curved side glass was deleted in favor of flat glass, which did not match the curve of the body sides. They also reduced the total glass area, which made the cars look smaller. An unpopular design for the second year in a row, the 1961 models had awkward-looking \\"reversed\\" tailfins and a pinched grille, among other unusual features. This combined with the cars' smaller overall size threatened Dodge's viability enough that Chrysler was forced to move immediately to stem Dodge's financial and market share losses. Model years =1962= 1962 Dodge Custom 880 Without lead time sufficient to develop an all new full-sized Dodge, Chrysler approved the sharing of the full-size body used by the Chrysler Newport and the non-letter 300 series. The models were differentiated by mating a modified 1961 Dodge Polara front clip to the Newport's defined rear quarter panels and passenger compartment. This body sharing allowed Dodge to launch the car in January 1962. It was fitted with a V8 engine from the B family; there were no optional engines. The only visible cue at the front of the car that was different from the 1961 Dodge was the addition of Dodge‚Äôs new three-pointed \\"Fratzog\\" emblem in place of the stylized star bar from the 1961 Polara. From the rear, the 1962 Custom 880 was identical to the Chrysler Newport except for Dodge badging. The model name Custom 880 was derived from Dodge‚Äôs numerical sub-model naming structure that was also used on the Dart and sportier models of the Polara, although the model designation was not physically present on the car. Only \\"Dodge\\" badges on the rear quarter panels and decklid of the car were applied. A six-way power seat was optional. For the short 1962 run, the Custom 880 was available as a four-door sedan, two- or four-door hardtop, a two-door convertible, as well as in six- or nine- passenger station wagons that featured the Chrysler hardtop (no center or B-pillar) body design. Custom 880 production totaled 17,500 for the 1962 model year. =1963= 1963 Dodge 880 station wagon For 1963, the Custom 880 series included a new base model, simply named the 880, available only as a pillared four-door sedan or a station wagon. Chrysler-branded cars were redesigned for 1963, leaving the 880's body unique to Dodge, although the car was still produced alongside the now totally different Chrysler. There was also an optional engine, the two-barrel V8. In what must have been near-record time, Dodge designers created an entirely new look for the car ahead of the cowl, fronted by a new convex grille in the shape of a very long oval, which shared visual similarities with the AMC Rambler. Straighter front fenders flanked a hood with a depressed central section featuring the Dodge name in block letters above the grille. Designers cleverly integrated the new Chrysler's front bumper into the design as well. At the rear there was less change, although the car received restyled taillights. Set in heavy chromed housings, they were mounted to the carryover quarter panels and imparted a Dodge familial appearance to the rear, as one of Dodge's styling hallmarks of the time was round taillights. The new base-model 880 station wagons utilized the pillared body in both six- and nine-passenger models, while the Custom-series wagons featured the pillarless hardtop design. With Chrysler no longer using the body and its interior trim elements, Custom 880s were better appointed than they had been during the 1962 model year. A total of 28,200 vehicles were produced for 1963, of which 5,600 were station wagons. =1964= 1964 Dodge Custom 880 Convertible The 880 and Custom 880 received their most significant and final redesign of the 1960 body for 1964. This time, the rear body contours were squared up somewhat, with new decklids, wraparound rectangular taillights, and new quarter panels. Four-door models received a new roofline, although this was actually the same as had been used on the Chrysler New Yorker until 1962. Regardless, it did impart a fresh appearance. The grille was also updated, this time featuring a concave design with a central horizontal break spanning the distance between the headlights. Custom 880s received stainless steel rocker panel trim, foam-padded seats, and a grooved stainless steel panel that spanned the distance between the taillights. The Customs, as the top of the 880 line, also received better interior appointments than the base models. The engines remained as they had been in 1963. Because of tooling expenses, station wagon bodies ‚Äî which were also shared with Chrysler models ‚Äî did not receive all of the changes applied to non-wagon models. Most notably, wagons continued to feature the heavy rear horizontal blade stamping first seen on the 1961 Plymouth wagons. The station wagons continued in both pillared (880) and hardtop (Custom 880) models, although this would be the final year for the hardtop wagon ‚Äî Dodge and Chrysler being the last American automotive brands to offer the style. Station wagons also received rectangular taillights that wrapped around the sides of the vehicle. All 880s and Custom 880s received a revised instrument cluster layout, replacing the previous design which had been in use with little change since 1961. An oil pressure gauge was standard. Front leg room was 41.9 inches. The 880 and Custom 880 received favorable press reviews, especially for their redesign. Sales for 1964 totaled 31,800 vehicles, a record for the model. =1965= The 1965 model year cars were the first that fully incorporated Elwood Engel's influence on Chrysler's corporate overall design themes, although he had joined the company in 1961. Gone were the relatively extreme curves and angles that were a legacy from the final Virgil Exner- styled cars. Engel's design philosophy, which was encouraged by Chrysler chairman Lynn Townsend, took Chrysler's products in the direction of rectilinear geometric angles; rectangular and trapezoidal shapes dominated Dodge's fullsize designs for the year. The introductions of the 1965 models also allowed Chrysler to rectify its 1962 mistake and reintroduced a full- sized Dodge Polara to the public. The \\"new\\" Polara took the position formerly held by the 880, with the Custom 880 taking the top trim level. The luxurious new Dodge Monaco, which was available only as a two-door hardtop, was the top- of-the-line model produced by Dodge in 1965 and was designed to compete against the Ford Galaxie 500 LTD and Chevrolet Caprice, both new top-line luxury models for 1965. An AM/FM radio and a 7-position tilt steering wheel were optional. All big Dodges, 880, Monaco, and Polara, now featured the same body and styling. Gone was the 1961 Chrysler design. All Custom 880s came with the standard features found in the Polara and added foam-padded seats and stainless steel window frames on station wagons and sedans. Hardtops and convertibles featured all-vinyl interiors. Custom 880s also featured a pillared six-window \\"town sedan\\" body that was unavailable in the Polara series. The series also featured the first Dodge-brand \\"wood\\" trimmed station wagon since the early 1950s, a look achieved through the use of DI-NOC appliqu√© framed in stainless steel trim. A total of 23,700 Custom 880s, all with V8 engines, were built during the model year. The 361 V8 was replaced by a version of the 383. The more powerful version of the 383 received a four- barrel carburetor for . There was also an optional RB V8, and at the top of the line the Wedge V8, also available with a four-speed manual transmission. End of the line Dodge discontinued the Custom 880 nameplate at the end of the 1965 model year in the United States. In an effort to move its top full- size series upscale for 1966, the division adopted the Monaco name for all of the former Custom 880 models, with the exception of the six-window sedan, which was discontinued. The original Monaco hardtop added the 500 label for 1966, and was still promoted as a competitor to the Pontiac Grand Prix.

A member of the Republican Party, Ashley served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio during the American Civil War, where he became a leader of the Radical Republicans and pushed for passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, ending slavery in the United States. After the war, he served as Governor of the Montana Territory and president of the Ann Arbor Railroad. Early and family life Ashley was born in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, to John Ashley, a bookbinder and Campbellite preacher who evangelized in Kentucky and West Virginia, and his wife Mary A. (Kilpatrick) Ashley of Kentucky. As a boy in the Ohio River valley, Ashley saw coffles of chained slaves being walked to the Deep South, boys his own age being sold, and even white men who refused to let their cattle drink from a stream in which his father had baptized slaves. He grew to hate the \\"peculiar institution\\" (which he considered a violation of Christian principles) and the oligarchy that supported it. Ashley was mostly self-taught in elementary subjects, although his father wanted him to follow family tradition and become a Baptist minister. Rather than attend a seminary, the 14 year old ran away to become a cabin boy on Ohio and Mississippi River boats, and later worked as a clerk on those boats. He had begun helping slaves to escape as early as 1839, and late in his life Ashley relished telling stories of the families he had saved as a 17 year old.He told the story later in life, which came down through the family that, when he left the home at 14, the last words his father said to him as he went off was: \\"You're on the straight road to Hell, boy!\\" Twenty years later, when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, his first act, when he sat down in his office in Washington, D.C., was to pen his father, to whom he had not spoken in twenty years, a letter on the Congressional stationary: \\"Dear Father, I have just arrived!\\" He married Emma Jane Smith in 1851 and together they had four children. He is the great-grandfather of U.S. Representative Thomas W. L. Ashley and a number of other descendants, including James Ashley IV, a portraitist living in Chicago. Political career In 1848, the burly six-foot tall youth settled in Portsmouth, Ohio, where he became a journalist‚Äîfirst at the Portsmouth Dispatch and later editor of the Portsmouth Democrat. The following year, 1849, he was admitted to the Ohio Bar but did not practice. Instead, by 1851, abolitionist activities caused Ashley and his wife to flee north to Toledo, Ohio to avoid prosecution under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. There, Ashley opened a drug store (which was soon burned down) and also became involved in the new Republican Party, campaigning for its presidential candidate John C. Fremont and congressman Richard Mott. James Ashley was an active abolitionist who traveled with John Brown's wife to Brown's execution in December, 1859, and reported the event in the still-extant local newspaper, the Toledo Blade. In 1858, he led the Ohio Republican Party. As the year ended, Ashley was elected to U.S. House of Representatives of the 36th United States Congress, and took office the following year. While in Congress (the 37th through 40th sessions), Ashley served as the Chairman of the Committee on Territories, and was instrumental to the creation (naming and borders) of the territories of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and Washington. He also authored the Arizona Organic Act. However, he opposed The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and especially polygamy, and limited Utah's boundaries to reduce Mormon influence. During the American Civil War, Ashley took an active role in supporting the recruitment of troops for the Union Army. He also became a leader among the Radical Republicans, writing a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia in 1862. In 1863 he introduced the first bill which ultimately (with Ashley as House Majority floor manager) became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by a 2/3 margin of 2 votes on January 31, 1865, formally abolishing slavery. Ashley suspected President Andrew Johnson of complicity in President Lincoln's assassination, and criticized the successor president for attempting to veto extensions of the Freedmen's Bureau, the Civil Rights Bill and the Reconstruction Acts. He suspected Johnson's ties with southern oligarchs. In January 1867, Ashley initiated impeachment proceedings against Johnson, and the following February the House formally charged Johnson with \\"usurpation of power and violation of law by corruptly using the appointing, pardoning, and veto powers, by disposing corruptly of the property of the United States, and by interfering in elections.\\" However, Johnson was acquitted by the Senate in May 1868. Ashley's radical views, particularly on race, as well as his support for educational qualifications, did not endear him to voters. Democrat Truman Hoag defeated him by less than 1000 votes in the 1868 election, which nearly bankrupted Ashley. However, President Grant appointed Ashley Territorial Governor of Democratic-leaning Montana Territory, where he served fifteen months until 1870, when he was removed by President Grant. His political appointments, and support for public education, including of Chinese immigrants, proved unpopular in the Democratic-leaning territory. Ashley then returned to Toledo and became involved in the railroad business, linking that city with northern Michigan as well as the Ann Arbor/Detroit area. Ashley helped build the Ann Arbor Railroad and served as its president from 1877 (when he moved to Ann Arbor while two of his sons were enrolled at the University of Michigan Law School) until 1890, when his sons took over. However, the railroad went bankrupt in the financial crisis of 1893. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1890 and 1892. Death and legacy Ashley suffered from diabetes since at least 1863. He died of heart failure after a fishing trip on September 16, 1896, in Alma, Michigan (known for its sanitoriums), and was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery (Toledo, Ohio). A eulogy at the Unitarian Church in Ann Arbor, Michigan mentioned his large size, \\"intellectually, physically and morally. There was nothing petty, small or mean about him.\\" Three years before his death, his efforts on behalf of racial equality were recognized by the Afro-American League of Tennessee, and he donated the proceeds of a book of his speeches to build schools. His great-great grandson Thomas William Ludlow Ashley, was later elected a U.S. Representative from Ohio. Ann Arbor, Michigan named a street leading to its railroad depot after Ashley. His descendant James Ashley IV recently completed a portrait of his great- grandfather, which is installed in the LaValley Law Library at the University of Toledo College of Law. In early 2010, the Ohio Historical Society proposed Ashley as a finalist in a statewide vote for inclusion in Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol.

Football career Recruited from Golden Square in the Bendigo Football League, Nixon played four games for the Carlton Football Club between 1983 and 1985, for one goal, amid limited opportunities (he was an emergency 13 times in their 1982 premiership year). The half-back flanker then moved to St Kilda, where he played 51 games including one final, with 32 goals, between 1986 and 1991, but Nixon was never really able to establish himself with the club. A contractual dispute with the Saints in March 1992 saw him move to the Hawthorn Football Club, where he played eight games, including one final, for six goals, before his retirement in 1993. Sports agent career Possibly the most high-profile sports agent in Australia, Nixon established his sports management company, Flying Start, in 1994 after eight years of teaching physical education at Carey Grammar. The company grew considerably to become one of the leading sports management companies in Australia. Nixon was a pioneer of group marketing of prominent athletes in Australia with his Club 10 team of AFL players, which included Gary Ablett, Sr., Wayne Carey, Jason Dunstall, Tony Lockett and Garry Lyon. He is widely acknowledged as a major leader in the innovative marketing of athletes and has been rated by The Age newspaper as the fourth most influential person of the past decade in the AFL. Flying Start's players included Matthew Richardson, Ben Cousins, Nick Riewoldt and Tom Hawkins. Nixon started a fitness club at Docklands Stadium, where he also co-owned the Locker Room Bar and Cougars Sports Bar with Michael Gudinski. He also commentated AFL on radio station Triple M and has been awarded the Australia Day Sports Medal for services to sport by the prime minister. He has since entered the education business with Flying Start providing online courses, including \\"How to be a Sports Agent\\". In 2008 Nixon began a well-publicised campaign to escalate the Irish experiment and set up a formal system for recruiting promising young Irish Gaelic footballers for AFL teams. The plan was criticised by many Gaelic football officials and players, including Sydney's Tadhg Kennelly. Some consider that the campaign, which included screening camps in Ireland in August 2008, will result in a talent drain from Ireland to Australia, something that Nixon refutes. Controversies On 19 February 2011, it was claimed by a number of press agencies that Nixon had an inappropriate relationship with a 17-year-old girl. The girl had previously been embroiled in a series of controversies involving players from the St Kilda Football Club, including one of Nixon's major clients, Nick Riewoldt. Nixon admitted to visiting the girl at her hotel room on at least three occasions ‚Äì including Valentine's Day ‚Äì and providing her with alcohol. The girl characterised the relationship as an \\"affair\\" and indicated that she was unaware at the time that Nixon was married. The controversy follows Nixon's drink driving charge in 2009 when he left the scene of an accident that he was involved in. He was given a two-year suspension by the AFL Players' Association Accreditation Board, on 18 March 2011. In July 2012 Nixon was charged with five offences following an alleged assault. In March 2013 Nixon pleaded guilty to charges of assault against his former fianc√©e and attempting to flee the police. He was sentenced to 200 hours of community service. In May 2013 Nixon was pulled over by police for speaking on his mobile phone while driving; he was found to also be driving while intoxicated and with a suspended licence. Post Sports Agent Career In January 2019, Nixon, along with his son's Lewis and Mitchell, started a charity known as Kicking for Cancer. It holds a charity football match every year to raise money to go towards kids with cancer.http://www.kickingforcancer.com.au In July, he started a new business, Vital Health Checks.

In the background, the sculpture of a reclining man is Catafalque by Sean Henry. Looking north on Golden Square Golden Square, in Soho, the City of Westminster, London, is a mainly hardscaped garden square planted with a few mature trees and raised borders in Central London flanked by classical office buildings. Its four approach ways are north and south but it is centred 125 metres east of Regent Street and double that NNE of Piccadilly Circus. A small block south is retail/leisure street Brewer Street. The square and its buildings have featured in many works of literature and host many media, advertising and public relations companies that characterise its neighbourhood within Soho.  History  Originally the site of a plague pit https://www.historic- uk.com/HistoryMagazine/DestinationsUK/LondonPlaguePits/, this west London square was brought into being from the 1670s onwards. The square was possibly laid down by Sir Christopher Wren; the plan bears Wren's signature, but the patent does not state whether it was submitted by the petitioners or whether it originated in Wren's office. It very rapidly became the political and ambassadorial district of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, housing the Portuguese embassy among others. The town house of the first Viscount Bolingbroke, much favoured by Queen Anne graced the square. The statue of George II sculpted by John Nost in 1724 came from Cannons House in March 1753.Dictionary of British Sculptors, 1660-1851, Rupert Gunnis William Pitt the Elder was born in the Square in 1708. Confusion surrounds whether the statue represents King George II of Great Britain, or King Charles II, as noted on the signage in Golden Square. Oral history recounts that the statue was accidentally won at auction, when the winning bidder raised his hand to greet a friend; the purchase price so low that he decided not to contest and gave the statue as a gift to the people of Golden Square.

History It was first defined by Henri Poincar√© in 1885, in relation to the precession of the perihelion of a planetary orbit. Poincar√© later proved a theorem characterizing the existence of periodic orbits in terms of rationality of the rotation number.  Definition  Suppose that f: S1 ‚Üí S1 is an orientation preserving homeomorphism of the circle S1 = R/Z. Then f may be lifted to a homeomorphism F: R ‚Üí R of the real line, satisfying : F(x + m) = F(x) +m for every real number x and every integer m. The rotation number of f is defined in terms of the iterates of F: :\\\\omega(f)=\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{F^n(x)-x}{n}. Henri Poincar√© proved that the limit exists and is independent of the choice of the starting point x. The lift F is unique modulo integers, therefore the rotation number is a well- defined element of R/Z. Intuitively, it measures the average rotation angle along the orbits of f.  Example  If f is a rotation by 2œÄŒ∏ (where 0‚â§Œ∏<1), then : F(x)=x+\\\\theta, then its rotation number is Œ∏ (cf Irrational rotation).  Properties  The rotation number is invariant under topological conjugacy, and even monotone topological semiconjugacy: if f and g are two homeomorphisms of the circle and : h\\\\circ f = g\\\\circ h for a monotone continuous map h of the circle into itself (not necessarily homeomorphic) then f and g have the same rotation numbers. It was used by Poincar√© and Arnaud Denjoy for topological classification of homeomorphisms of the circle. There are two distinct possibilities. * The rotation number of f is a rational number p/q (in the lowest terms). Then f has a periodic orbit, every periodic orbit has period q, and the order of the points on each such orbit coincides with the order of the points for a rotation by p/q. Moreover, every forward orbit of f converges to a periodic orbit. The same is true for backward orbits, corresponding to iterations of f‚àí1, but the limiting periodic orbits in forward and backward directions may be different. * The rotation number of f is an irrational number Œ∏. Then f has no periodic orbits (this follows immediately by considering a periodic point x of f). There are two subcases. :# There exists a dense orbit. In this case f is topologically conjugate to the irrational rotation by the angle Œ∏ and all orbits are dense. Denjoy proved that this possibility is always realized when f is twice continuously differentiable. :# There exists a Cantor set C invariant under f. Then C is a unique minimal set and the orbits of all points both in forward and backward direction converge to C. In this case, f is semiconjugate to the irrational rotation by Œ∏, and the semiconjugating map h of degree 1 is constant on components of the complement of C. The rotation number is continuous when viewed as a map from the group of homeomorphisms (with C^0 topology) of the circle into the circle.

National Register of Historic Places. Egyptian-style theatres are based on the traditional and historic design elements of Ancient Egypt. The first Egyptian Theatre to be constructed in the US ‚Äì which inspired many of the identically- named theatres that followed it ‚Äì was Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, California. For several years, Hollywood developer Charles E. Toberman attempted to convince Sid Grauman to locate in Hollywood. During a meeting, Sid told Mr. Toberman of his desire to build a theatre of Egyptian design. Mr. Toberman then secured a piece of property on Hollywood Boulevard, just east of McCadden Place. The architectural firm of Meyer & Holler were hired to design the theatre. The result was Grauman's Egyptian Theatre with a seating of 1770. The approach to the theatre was through a courtyard in an ornate style evoking ancient Egypt, while inside, the stage was flanked by carved columns and models of the Sphinx. The theatre was opened on October 19, 1922 with the grand premiere of \\"Robin Hood\\" starring Douglas Fairbanks. In a 1983 article in Hollywood Studio Magazine, Mike Hughes wrote of the Egyptian: \\"A survivor of the decay that unfortunately characterizes the Hollywood Boulevard of today, the Egyptian is a reminder of the glamour that once made the Boulevard famous. Perhaps through the dedicated efforts of such citizens as Bruce Torrence, author of Hollywood: The First 100 Years and grandson of Mr. Charles Toberman, who built the Egyptian, the Hollywood Boulevard of yesteryear will reappear some great day in the future. When that happens, the Egyptian Theatre, jewel that it is, will be there to herald in the new age of film town.\\"\\" United Artists was the last owner of the Egyptian Theatre before it closed in 1992. The American Cinematheque purchased the theatre from the city for $1 with the provision \\"that this historical landmark would be restored to its original grandeur and re-opened as a movie theatre showcasing the organization's celebrated public programming.\\" The Eldorado Theatre located in Eldorado Amusement Park, Weehawken, New Jersey opened in 1891 and featured 'Egypt Through Centuries' each evening. The creators of the park, Palisades Amusement and Exhibition Company, published a book titled \\"Egypt Through the Centuries\\" in 1892. Many of the other theatres that copied Grauman's Egyptian Theatre were part of the wave of Egyptian Revival architecture that occurred after the November 1922 discovery of King Tut's tomb by Howard Carter. Unlike the many theatres that followed in its wake, Grauman's Egyptian Theatre was designed, built, named and opened before the 1922 discovery of King Tut's tomb. The news of the tomb's discovery reached the US a few weeks after the theatre opened. Early in the 20th century, it is estimated that up to 100 of these theatre types were constructed across the US. Many of them no longer exist, but there are many fine examples of this style still in use today. Conrad Schmitt Studios has played a big part in the restoration of these atmospheric theatres, including Egyptian Theatres in Park City, Utah, Ogden, Utah, Boise, Idaho, Delta, Colorado, and DeKalb, Illinois.

He is part of Darkseid's Elite on the planet Apokolips. His name comes from the Bethlem Royal Hospital insane asylum, and is a reference to his madness-inducing \\"paranoid pill\\". Publication history Doctor Bedlam first appeared in Mister Miracle #2 (May‚ÄìJune 1971) and was created by Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Doctor Bedlam's early life is unknown, save that he once possessed a physical body that was somehow transformed into pure psionic energy. His primary foe is Mister Miracle whom he has never defeated. Following the destruction of Apokolips and New Genesis, Doctor Bedlam relocates to Earth, where he attracts the new Mister Miracle's attention by becoming an escape artist under the name Baron Bedlam. He wears a costume which is a negative copy of the new Mister Miracle's outfit. He is not, in fact, a good escape artist, but does not need to be; one android body is destroyed by the traps, and he relocates to another one, which then appears from backstage. Bedlam is a featured character in Underworld Unleashed: Apokolips - Dark Uprising #1 (1995). With Darkseid missing, the various factions of Apokolips form plans; Granny Goodness sends several of her students to kill Bedlam. They seemingly succeed but again, he has transferred his mind to another body just in time. =Seven Soldiers= Grant Morrison revamped Baron Bedlam in Seven Soldiers: Mister Miracle as a rival escape-artist stealing Shilo's fame. In this incarnation, the Baron's bodies are blonde, Caucasian males whose suit is an inversion of Shilo's. The Baron performed inescapable death traps, destroying the body he was currently using and inhabiting a replacement, via the Bedlam Beat, stashed nearby to make it seem like he escaped unharmed. His popularity grew to a point that he had his own cult following of Plastic People, fans whose bodies were transformed in a surgical process involving enamel. However, most of the events in this story were revealed to take place in an alternative timeline, so there is a possibility that it did not happen. =Death of the New Gods= Doctor Bedlam appears in the first issue of the Death of the New Gods limited series. When New Gods are being hunted down across the galaxy, one of Bedlam's android forms is found damaged. Bedlam's consciousness cannot be located, hence it is assumed that Bedlam has become the victim of the Infinity-Man who had been responsible for killing numerous other New Gods. =The New 52= In The New 52, Doctor Bedlam is reintroduced on Earth-2 as a member of Steppenwolf's Hunger Dogs.Earth 2 Vol 1 #15 (October 2013) Powers and abilities Doctor Bedlam exists as a being of pure psionic energy and is typically invisible but can make himself appear in the form of the face he once had in his physical form. Doctor Bedlam psionically commands powerful androids known as animates. These animates have superhuman strength, are able to break steel with their hands, and possess incredible durability. He can control multiple animates at once, even enough to form an army. He can also project himself into one of the animates to temporarily attain physical form. If it is possible to kill him, it would be extremely difficult since he can abandon any of his android bodies that are harmed. Doctor Bedlam is a master scientist who specializes in devising means of inducing terror in the minds of his victims through his powers of mental manipulation and paranoia. One of his most infamous tools is a \\"paranoid pill\\" which releases a gas that can drive anyone exposed to it temporarily insane with fear and hatred. In other media Dr. Bedlam has appeared as a background character in Darkseid's elite in the DC Animated Universe.

His repertoire extended from Viennese classics through French composers to 20th century works. Although much of his career was spent in France, he was the first French conductor at Bayreuth in 1955; he also conducted The Ring and Parsifal at La Scala.Andr√© Cluytens. In: The New Grove Dictionary of Music. Macmillan, London and New York, 2001. Life and career =Belgium= Cluytens was born in Antwerp into a musical family: his paternal grandfather, father and uncles were all professional musicians. His mother was a soprano at the opera, and after she died in 1906 his father married another singer. He entered the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp at the age of 9, graduating at 16 with first prizes in harmony and counterpoint, and piano.Sanders A. Liner notes to Andre Cluytens ‚Äì A French Collection CDs. London, Testament, 2002. His father Alphonse, conductor of the Th√©√¢tre Royal Fran√ßais Opera House, engaged his son as a chorusmaster and coach. He joined his father at the Opera, conducting productions there, making his debut on 14 December 1926 with Les p√™cheurs de perles. In January 1927 he married Germaine Gilson, a soprano soloist in the troupe of the Th√©√¢tre Royal Fran√ßais; they had one son, Michel (1943‚Äì69). Promoted to house conductor for the 1927‚Äì28 season, over the next five years Cluytens built up a broad opera (and ballet) repertoire in Antwerp: Mireille, Madama Butterfly, La traviata, La fille du r√©giment, La Basoche, Ma m√®re l'oye, Manon, La poup√©e de Nuremberg, Resurrection, Lucia di Lammermoor, Werther, Jeux, Le domino noir, Le voyage en Chine, Les Huguenots, Schwanda the Bagpiper, Salome and Ang√©lique. =France= In 1932, he became the principal conductor at the Th√©√¢tre du Capitole of Toulouse, adding further to his repertoire, including operas such as Boris Godunov, Lohengrin, Ernani, Tannh√§user, Otello, Die Walk√ºre and The Marriage of Figaro as well as several operettas. In 1935 he moved to the Op√©ra National de Lyon as principal conductor, adding more Wagner to his repertoire (Das Rheingold and Siegfried) and became the musical director there in 1942. Cluytens volunteered to serve in the French army in September 1939 and following a medical examination was engaged as a French combatant, although he never saw action; he became a French citizen on 14 May 1940. Following the liberation of France, complaints from Bordeaux concerning his alleged collaboration with Nazi authorities in that city led to him being sentenced as part of the √©puration; after appeal, on 24 May 1946 his sentence was revoked. In 1947, he was appointed musical director at the Op√©ra-Comique, where he conducted 40 works between 1947‚Äì1953, including premieres of La carosse du Saint Sacrement, Marion and Le Oui des jeunes filles. His well-regarded work at the Op√©ra-Comique included a successful renewal of The Tales of Hoffmann in a fresh production in April 1948;Wolff, St√©phane.

Also notable was the revival after 180 years of Blaise le savetier (which was brought into the Salle Favart repertoire as a curtain- raiser for La boheme, Werther and La traviata), and the French premiere of The Rake's Progress in June 1953. His revival of Manon was highly praised ‚Äì and representative of what Paris critics saw as a successful tenure at the Op√©ra- Comique; he also oversaw many all-Ravel evenings. Cluytens resigned from the Op√©ra-Comique in December 1953 and conducted his last performance there (Manon) on 30 September 1954. He became a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1953. Having made his debut with the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra on 20 December 1942, he succeeded Charles Munch in 1949 as principal conductor, which post he held until 1960. His contract required him to conduct half of the orchestra's concerts each season; he also led them on foreign tours. Cluytens was due to conduct the first concert to be given by Alfred Cortot in Paris after his disgrace for Vichy activities, in 1947; in the event the concerto was dropped and Cluytens refused to acknowledge Cortot as he and the orchestra left the stage for Cortot to play solo.Spotts F.

His other work at Bayreuth up to 1965 consisted of Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg (1956, 1957, 1958), Parsifal (1957, 1965) and Lohengrin (1958), returning for Tannh√§user in 1965.

In April 2005, the group had begun writing material for the album. Two months later, they signed with Warner Bros. Records and contributed a song to the Fantastic Four soundtrack. Soon afterwards, the group rented a room in Manhattan where they composed songs for Louder Now. They came up with 20 songs, discarding half of them and recording demos of the remainder. The group began recording Louder Now with Eric Valentine in September 2005 at Barefoot Studios in Los Angeles, California. After Warner Bros. told them they did not need to rush, they recorded new demos. Recording ended on New Year's Day, 2006, and was followed by a tour of the UK, Australia and the U.S. Louder Now was released on April 25, 2006 on Warner Bros. Records. Several weeks later, \\"MakeDamnSure\\" was released as a single; this was followed by a tour with Angels & Airwaves. A music video was released for \\"Twenty-Twenty Surgery,\\" and the single was released a month later. A video for \\"Liar (It Takes One to Know One)\\" was released in September, before the single's release in November. Taking Back Sunday then began a two-month stint as part of the Taste of Chaos tour. A video album, The Louder Now DVD: PartOne, was released in December. The album included videos of the recording process, tour footage and music videos. \\"What's It Feel Like to Be a Ghost?\\" was released as a single on New Year's Eve. In early 2007 the group toured North America, followed by the release of \\"My Blue Heaven\\" as a single in April. After a tour with Linkin Park, guitarist Fred Mascherino left the group and was replaced by Matthew Fazzi. Louder Now received generally favorable reviews from critics, and was voted Kerrang!s album of the year. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 158,000 copies in its first week after release, reached the top 10 of several Billboard charts and the top 20 in Canada, Australia and the UK. Two months after its release, Louder Now was certified gold by the RIAA for sales of 500,000 copies and was later certified silver by the BPI for sales of 60,000 copies. As of May 2009, the album has sold 674,000 copies in the U.S. Background and writing In July 2004, Taking Back Sunday released Where You Want to Be on independent label Victory Records. The album became a bestselling independent rock album within a year, selling 634,000 copies, and was certified gold by the RIAA. The band toured frequently for eight months before beginning to compose material for their next album. Vocalist Adam Lazzara said in April 2005 that the band was in \\"the early stages\\" of writing new songs. In April and May the group went on a co-headlining tour with Jimmy Eat World, introducing \\"Error: Operator\\" and \\"What's It Feel Like to Be a Ghost?.\\" On June 10, it was announced that the band had signed with major label Warner Bros. Records and would begin recording their third album later in 2005. That month, the group contributed \\"Error: Operator\\" (which differs from the final album version) to the video-game adaption of Fantastic Four. Activision, the game's developers, wanted the track written from the viewpoint of Mister Fantastic. The group was hesitant, according to Lazzara, since the character is an \\"extremely rich, extremely smart guy ... And I'm not very smart, and I'm not rich at all, so I couldn't really relate.\\" The song was also included on the film's soundtrack. Taking Back Sunday rented a room in Manhattan, sharing it with the Sleeping and writing songs with laptops and guitars. Typically, they arrived at about 10 am; some evenings, Lazzara showed up after the band to write melodies. The group wrote 20 songs before discarding half, and recorded 14 or 15 demos in their home studio. According to bassist Matt Rubano, Fred Mascherino and Adam Lazzara's lyrics \\"are coming into a golden age. The tracks are really more rocking and we're trying some new things, but it's still us.\\" For Where You Want to Be the group \\"didn't spend as much time playing together,\\" but for Louder Now \\"we know each other's playing. We know what we want and don't want.\\" Recording On September 21, 2005, it was announced that Taking Back Sunday had begun recording their third album with Eric Valentine. The group chose Valentine because he had produced Queens of the Stone Age's Songs for the Deaf (2002) and Third Eye Blind's self-titled album (1997). Although they met with Howard Benson and Rob Cavallo, the band's \\"love of Eric's work kind of trumped any other meeting we had.\\" Unlike their previous records, the group worked in a large studio (Barefoot Studios in Los Angeles, California). Warner Bros. told them, \\"Take your time and it's done when you're done with it,\\" and the band re-recorded the demos. According to Mascherino, the group \\"knew how it was going to come out ... [Demoing again] was a thorough way to do it.\\" Working in a big studio, according to Lazzara, gave the band the opportunity to \\"have more than two guitar sounds.\\" According to Rubano, the group wished to make a rock-oriented album‚Äînot in compositional style, but \\"maybe in the recording and the tones of the instruments.\\" They brought out \\"a really unique character\\" in all the songs. During the recording, guitarist Ed Reyes used Orange and Burman amplifiers. Most of his guitar tracks were recorded with an Epiphone Casino guitar, and he also used an Epiphone Crestwood guitar. Frequently using a tape delay effect, Reyes did not use distortion pedals since the Orange amp \\"had a perfect gain sound in itself.\\" Mascherino used his Gibson SG Special guitar during recording, which he said had \\"an amazing sound which is really warm and gives me my own sound.\\" He channeled it through a Marshall JCM800 amplifier, and also used a Gibson Firebird guitar when the group needed \\"a really tight sound.\\" The drums were recorded in three days. After positioning four microphones around (and inside) the bass drum, Valentine placed Mark O'Connell in a room \\"he calls the torture chamber.\\" According to the drummer, the room's acoustics made the drums sound \\"insane.\\" By November the rhythm guitar, bass and drums were done, leaving the vocals and lead guitar to be finished. Recording wrapped up on New Year's Day, 2006. The songs were recorded with Pro Tools and transferred to analog tape for mixing, which was done by Valentine. Matt Radosevich engineered the recordings, assisted by Chris Roach. The band recorded 14 songs, with 11 planned to make the final track listing. The strings on \\"My Blue Heaven,\\" arranged by Anton Patzner, were performed by Judgement Day. Patzner played violin and viola, and his brother Lewis played cello. Elena Mascherino contributed backing vocals to \\"I'll Let You Live,\\" and Brian Gardner mastered the recordings at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood, California. The group released behind-the-scenes studio clips, often with snippets of new songs. Music and lyrics Lazzara said that Taking Back Sunday was \\"starting to grow up,\\" no longer writing songs about being in high school and realizing that they \\"have to be an adult about some things.\\" According to Mascherino, the group wanted to create something \\"timeless\\" to stand out from their peers; they \\"didn‚Äôt want to just do the formula,\\" and used piano, xylophone and strings. Alternative Press noted that Louder Now had a \\"much more full sound, much more tight\\" than Where You Want to Be. MTV called the album \\"a big, ballsy, monster of a rock record,\\" and its title affirms that it is a rock record. The album's sound has been described as alternative rock, emo pop and pop punk. \\"What's It Feel Like to Be a Ghost?\\" is, according to Lazzara, about a \\"pre-pre-midlife crisis.\\" Mascherino said that the song \\"charges forward,\\" never letting \\"up and fully rocks the entire time.\\" Rubano called the opening guitar riff \\"not quite 'Paradise City', but it's a guitar riff where when we first came up with it, we were like, 'Whoa! Rock! He thought that \\"Liar (It Takes One to Know One)\\" sounded like a modern equivalent of the Police. Lazzara called the song \\"110 miles- per-hour, very hard to play and totally rocking,\\" and Mascherino considered it and \\"Spin\\" the group's fastest songs ever. \\"MakeDamnSure\\" has a phone message in the bridge; Lazzara and his girlfriend were arguing at the time, and she left him a message. Lazzara showed it to Valentine, wanting to include it in the song. According to Mascherino, \\"MakeDamnSure\\" received the greatest group effort of the album's songs. \\"Up Against (Blackout)\\", a track with a time signature of 6/8, was compared to Mascherino's former band Breaking Pangaea. The intro to \\"My Blue Heaven\\" was reminiscent of \\"Wounded\\" by Third Eye Blind; the lyrics during the chorus were taken from \\"Wedding Dress\\" by Breaking Pangaea. For \\"Twenty-Twenty Surgery\\" Lazzara had several lyrics and melodies, \\"but nothing was working and it was the most frustrating thing\\"; its chorus was the album's final composition. Mascherino called \\"Spin\\" \\"this album's 'The Union', but on steroids\\", drawing a comparison to Circa Survive. The acoustic ballad \\"Divine Intervention\\" recalled the quieter work of Brand New, and included a lyrical reference to \\"My Favorite Things\\" from The Sound of Music. Mascherino soloed on \\"Miami,\\" encouraged by Lazzara when the band was recording its demo. Lazzara later called the solo \\"funny and great.\\" According to Mascherino, the group wanted the song \\"to sound as much like the Cure as possible, so it‚Äôs all clean guitars.\\" He said that the drums on \\"I'll Let You Live\\" were recorded at a faster tempo, sounding \\"totally deeper\\" when played back; the song evoked Breaking Pangaea's 11 minute song \\"Turning\\". \\"Sleep\\" was the band's attempt at a Motown-inspired bass sound. \\"Brooklyn (If You See Something, Say Something)\\" contains a \\"real floaty, airy pre-chorus and then it's upbeat but dark,\\" according to Lazzara. He did not regret dropping \\"Sleep\\" and \\"Brooklyn\\" from the final track listing \\"because when you listen to everything down, they just didn't really feel like they fit.\\" Release Taking Back Sunday on the Projekt Revolution tour, August 19, 2007 In late January 2006, Taking Back Sunday toured the UK. On February 16, the upcoming release of Louder Now was announced. The album's artwork, a photograph by Joel Meyerowitz edited by Brad Filip, was introduced the following day. On February 28 \\"MakeDamnSure\\" became available for streaming, and in early March the band filmed its music video. The video was filmed in Los Angeles with director Marc Klasfeld; according to Rubano, the band chose Klasfeld because his script for the video suited the song. MTV called it \\"a powerful montage of violent images, all shot in arty slow motion,\\" combined with footage of the band performing in a wind tunnel. \\"MakeDamnSure\\" was released to radio on March 14. The group then toured Australia, returning for a U.S. tour from late March to mid-May with support from Tokyo Rose and Suicide City. On April 6, the \\"MakeDamnSure\\" video was released. The group played at the Give it a Name festival in the UK before headlining the Bamboozle festival in the U.S. Louder Now, scheduled for a spring release, was released April 25 on Warner Bros. Records. \\"MakeDamnSure\\" was released as a single on May 15, with \\"Sleep\\" its B-side. In June and July, the band toured with Angels & Airwaves. On July 23 the music video for \\"Twenty-Twenty Surgery\\" was released, directed by Jay Martin, and on August 28 it was released as a single with \\"Brooklyn (If You See Something, Say Something)\\" its B-side. \\"Liar (It Takes One to Know One)\\" was released to radio on September 19. A music video for the song, directed by Tony Petrossian, was released on September 29. In October and November the group was part of the 2006 Taste of Chaos tour, visiting New Zealand and Europe. \\"Liar (It Takes One to Know One)\\" was released as a single on November 6, with a live version of \\"Spin\\" its B-side. On December 12 the band released a DVD entitled The Louder Now DVD: PartOne, with over 60 minutes of footage documenting the making of the album, their world tour, live and behind-the- scenes footage of a show at the Long Beach Arena and the music videos for \\"MakeDamnSure\\" and \\"Liar (It Takes One to Know One).\\" On New Year's Eve, \\"What's It Feel Like to Be a Ghost?\\" was released as a single. In late February and early March 2007, the band headlined a North American with support from Underoath and Armor for Sleep. On April 2, \\"My Blue Heaven\\" was released as a single and released to radio a week later. From late July to early September, the band participated in the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour with Linkin Park. On August 3 it was announced that O'Connell had injured his back, and he was replaced by Matchbook Romance drummer Aaron Stern for the remainder of the tour. Shortly after the tour Mascherino left the band, although his departure was not announced until early October. He said, \\"It was getting to the point where I felt I had taken the road as long as I possibly could,\\" and his compositions were \\"more pop than anyone else [in the band] wanted to go.\\" Mascherino had written over 45 songs, most intended for Louder Now but turned down by the band. He began a solo project, the Color Fred. Reception =Critical reception= Louder Now received a score of 64 out of 100 from Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" AbsolutePunk founder Jason Tate considered the album \\"closer to Northstar's Pollyanna\\" than to Where You Want to Be, and said that the music wasn't \\"anything mind- blowing. I don't get knocked on my ass like I did the first time I heard TAYF, but the catchy repetitiveness is all there.\\" AllMusic reviewer Corey Apar called the album's name \\"an apt title for a super-tight, aggressive album that falls somewhere between their last two, tapping the heartfelt vigor of Tell All Your Friends in order to give Where You Want to Be a swift, square kick in the pants.\\" Scott Heisel wrote for Alternative Press that the band \\"[is] spot- on when they floor it or put it in park; it's the sputtering along in-between that hurts the record.\\" Despite not mastering \\"the art of the middle ground,\\" they take \\"immense leaps forward musically on their third album.\\" According to Heisel, the band should be \\"commended, not for just choosing not to rehash their older work, but for truly trying to branch out artistically‚Äîand succeeding most of the time.\\" Kyle Ryan of the A.V. Club called Taking Back Sunday's sound on their debut album \\"fresh and raw\\" and their approach to Louder Now \\"formulaic.\\" According to Ryan, Lazzara \\"changed his style a bit\\" and \\"occasionally sound[ed] like his jaw is wired shut.\\" Entertainment Weekly reviewer Clark Collis wrote that the album's title \\"justifies its name thanks to a chunkier array of riffs and choruses\\" compared to Where You Want to Be. Sarah Dean wrote on FasterLouder that Louder Now differs from the band's past records; it has \\"a darker mood, bigger choruses and perhaps even catchier melodies,\\" with the \\"emo-pop punk flavour Taking Back Sunday are renowned for.\\" Gigwise contributor Lee Glynn wrote that the album had \\"no standout tracks\\" other than \\"MakeDamnSure.\\" Apart from the latter, \\"there is nothing on this album that reaffirms them as a band full of malice and bite.\\" Spence D. of IGN gave the album a score of 6.7 out of 10: \\"It's a safe bet to say that TBS diehards will soak up the 11 tracks with a sponge-like vengeance. Newcomers may wonder what all the bells and whistles are about, though. But tracks like 'My Blue Heaven', 'Spin', 'Divine Intervention' and 'I'll Let You Live' promise even greater things to come from this band, who are only now hinting at their growing sonic maturity.\\" NME gave the album a score of six out of ten: \\"It tails off towards the end, and TBS never quite shake the feeling that other people are doing this sort of thing far more thrillingly elsewhere.\\" Now reviewer Evan Davies wrote that although the group's fans and label had expectations, it \\"doesn't mean you have to put out the exact same fucking album twice in a row.\\" According to Davies, Taking Back Sunday writes two kinds of songs: \\"energetic pop rock with whiny vocals, and midtempo power rock, again with whiny vocals.\\" Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone wrote that the group \\"amped up their sound,\\" with Valentine \\"delivering a turbocharged attack spiked with dark, catchy melodies and giant choruses.\\" Hoard called most of the album's songs \\"skull-rattling slasher[s] with enough pop smarts to keep the heartbroken agony from becoming too much to handle.\\" For Stylus Magazine, Ian Cohen wrote that the album \\"tables the discussion\\" of whether Taking Back Sunday \\"embrace their arena destiny or disappear into the basement for cred that never really existed.\\" Cohen concluded, \\"As was the case with pop-metal, 'albums' weren't the objective, so much as a few ace singles and album tracks that hold serve, which is Louder Now in a nutshell.\\" =Commercial performance= Louder Now was expected to sell 185,000 copies.Mayfield 2006 (18), p. 39 It sold 158,000 copies in its first week, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200.Mayfield 2006 (19), p. 51 The album had lower first-week sales than Where You Want to Be, which had sold 164,000 copies.

By May 2009, the album had sold 674,000 copies.Wood 2009, p. 43 =Accolades and legacy= It was one of Alternative Press most-anticipated albums of the year, and topped Kerrang!s album-of-the-year poll. The music video for \\"MakeDamnSure\\" was nominated for an MTV2 Viewer's Choice award. TJ Horansky of Alternative Press wrote that with Louder Now, the group \\"started firing on all cylinders.\\" Mascherino's \\"unique fluid and gruff vocals perfectly complement\\" Lazzara's \\"maniacal and effusive delivery,\\" and Horansky called the vocals \\"much more natural\\" than Taking Back Sunday's previous albums. Fuse.tv's Jason Lipshutz called Louder Now his second-favorite Taking Back Sunday album. According to Lipshutz, it \\"was a mainstream mission statement, with ferocious guitar work and choruses aimed squarely at arenas.\\" With moments of \\"true grace and contemplation,\\" the album was \\"thrilling and complex.\\" Rock Sound ranked it at number 55 on the list of best albums in their lifetime, stating that \\"nothing else in their back-catalogue boasts the huge songs, slick polish and, arguably, the heart of their major label debut.\\"Napier ed. 2019, p. 64 It has appeared on best-of emo album lists by The Daily Dot and Loudwire. The album was re-pressed on vinyl in June 2017, which charted at number 16 on the Vinyl Albums chart. Throughout 2019, the band performed Louder Now in its entirety for their 20th anniversary world tour. For cities in the US that had two shows back-to-back, the band would flip a coin to play either Louder Now or Where You Want to Be (2004) on the first night and the other album on the second night. To help promote the tour, a career-spanning compilation Twenty (2019) was released, which included \\"Liar (It Takes One to Know One)\\", \\"MakeDamnSure\\", \\"What's It Feel Like to Be a Ghost?\\" and \\"My Blue Heaven\\" from Louder Now.

After a long and successful minor league career, Baxes finally made his major league debut April 11, 1959, for the Dodgers. He played in 11 games for Los Angeles, mostly at third base, and hit .303 with a .515 slugging percentage. When the Dodgers removed Baxes from their roster on cut-down day, he considered the idea of quitting baseball. Then, on May 22, Baxes was traded to Cleveland for $10,000 cash and a player. Baxes played in 77 games for the Indians in 1959 ‚Äì 48 at second base and 22 at third. He hit .239 for the Tribe and belted 15 home runs. Baxes finished with season and career totals of 17 home runs and a .246 batting average and was selected to the Topps All-Star Rookie Roster. However, it was his only major league season, as he was back in the minor leagues in 1960. After the 1961 campaign, he retired from organized baseball. On April 15, 1959, he hit his first major league home run off future Hall of Famer Bob Gibson. Gibson had not previously pitched to any batter in the majors. Baxes would collect 16 more that year, while Gibson would surrender just three more in his rookie campaign. Jim was the older brother of fellow former major leaguer Mike Baxes. Jim and his wife Jeanne Yvonne Baxes (1927‚Äì2002) are buried together in Magnolia Memorial Park in Garden Grove, California.

After activism supporting refugees and women in Winnipeg, she moved to Toronto and continued to support causes such as women's suffrage, becoming president of the Equal Franchise League of Toronto. She was elected for a one-year term on the Toronto City Council in the 1920 elections, becoming the first female member of Toronto City Council and the first woman in Ontario to hold elected office at either the federal, provincial, or municipal level. After two terms she resigned to continue her work campaigning for immigrant settlement and refugee issues, and for equal rights. In 1979, the Toronto city council established the Constance E. Hamilton Award on the Status of Women. Early life and education She was born in Yorkshire, England in 1862 to Dr George Fowler Bodington (1829-1902) and Caroline Mary Eaton (1825-1873). Early she studied with private tutors. Fluent in German, she attended the Conservatory of Music in Leipzig, Germany and became a skilled pianist. She also worked as a part-time farmer for parts of her early life. Hamilton immigrated to Canada with her family in 1887 and settled in Vancouver. The following year she met and married Lauchlan Hamilton, an older businessman. Career =Civic activities in Winnipeg and Toronto= In 1888 she and her husband moved to Winnipeg, when her husband was transferred there as senior Canadian Pacific Railway land commissioner. During her time in Winnipeg, she was one of the six women who founded the Women's Musical Club of Winnipeg, and served as the first president when it was formally organized in 1899. She also used her German to assist new immigrants to the city. She and her husband moved to Toronto, Ontario in 1899, when the city's population was 200,000. A supporter of women's suffrage, she became president of the Equal Franchise League of Toronto and also the National Suffrage Organization. With a passion described as focusing on the broad themes of \\"Bach, agriculture and politics,\\" she chaired the Toronto branch of the National Refugee Committee and would lead the National Council of Women's agriculture committee. She founded Toronto's Bach Society. She was a volunteer for Big Sisters and YWCA, and a writer, arts patron, linguist, and social advocate. =Elected office in Toronto in 1920= In 1919, women obtained the right to run for elected office in Ontario. Previously married women had been barred, by law, from doing so. The elective office of public school trustee was open to Ontario widows and unmarried women who owned property from about 1884, although the first female trustees to be elected in Toronto were in 1892. Hamilton ran for Toronto city council for a one-year term in 1920, in the first year that women over 21 could vote. Hamilton fought the race over eight other male opponents, for one of three spots in Ward 3, \\"a long, narrow downtown ward, stretching from the waterfront north almost to St. Clair Ave., and taking in King, Front, Church, Yonge and Bay streets.\\" Her platform was a mix of social and practical concerns, including a stronger police force and more library funding. When she won the race, she became the first woman in Ontario to hold elected office at either the federal, provincial, or municipal level. Her swearing in ceremony received little press. In office, she championed issues such as a raise in minimum wage, health initiatives, for more women judges, and urged reforms for hiring of domestic workers, also championing a maximum 10-hour workday. =Second term and retirement= She was re-elected for another one-year term in 1921. After two terms in office she resigned for reasons that \\"remain a mystery.\\" According to the city of Toronto, she resigned so that she could continue to campaign for immigrant settlement and refugee issues, and for equal rights. After politics, much of her time went into finding employment for new refugees in Toronto, and she also served on the board of Woman's Century, a magazine. Personal life and legacy Hamilton married Canadian Pacific Railway land commissioner and civil engineer Lauchlan Alexander Hamilton (1852-1941), who was also Vancouver City Alderman and designed the Coat of arms of Vancouver. They did not have any children, but Lauchlan had a daughter (Isabella) from his marriage to Isabella Hamilton (1858?-1888). Her husband died in 1941 and she died in 1945. She and her husband lived in Toronto at 30 Saint Joseph Street, in a \\"sparsely furnished old house just north of Wellesley Street\\" with a \\"scruffy, homey and lived-in look.\\" The Bach Society met in the drawing room, and friend later said that Hamilton \\"filled the rackety old house with a succession of lame dogs and tame cats; refugee cellists from Austria; Englishmen with a gift of the gab who were down on their luck; unemployed Italian waiters; poverty stricken painters; young clergymen whose faith had been shaken.\\" It also became a \\"magnet\\" for those in the literary, cultural, and radio broadcasting worlds of Toronto. She also maintained a summer home at Lorne Park west of Toronto for \\"indigent artists and musicians\\" with a dozen \\"ramshackle\\" cottages on a large property with pine trees. She would cook for the collection of artists herself, never charging money for the meals. In 1979, city council established the Constance E. Hamilton Award on the Status of Women, to be awarded to a resident of Toronto whose actions have \\"had a significant impact on securing equitable treatment for women in Toronto, either socially, economically or culturally.\\" The women members of Toronto City Council select the recipient, or multiple recipients.

Pre-Mercury development  The suit was designed by Russell Colley (who designed and built the high-altitude pressure suit worn by aviator Wiley Post) as a means of providing an Earth-like atmosphere in the unpressurized high- altitude fighter jets developed by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy after the Korean War. The Mark IV suit was first introduced in the late 1950s. Prior to the development of the Mark IV suit, the Navy developed different types of the Mark-series full-pressure suits, but all the suits before the Mark IV had problems with both mobility and weight. The Mark IV suit solved the mobility problems with the use of elastic cord which arrested the \\"ballooning\\" of the suit, and at 22 lb., was the lightest pressure suit developed for military use. The most severe test of the suit occurred during the record-setting balloon flight of Malcolm Ross and Victor Prather in the Strato-Lab V unpressurized gondola to on May 4, 1961. With the advent of pressurized cockpits, and the David Clark Company's contract with the U.S. Air Force and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (later NASA) for a full pressure suit for the X-15 rocket plane, the suit fell out of use.  Project Mercury  John Glenn in Mercury suit with helmet When NASA began the Mercury Project in 1958, one of the first needs was a \\"space suit\\": a pressure suit to protect the astronaut in the event of a sudden depressurization of the cabin in the vacuum of space. NASA tested both the Navy Mark IV suit and the X-15 high-altitude suit, and chose the Mark IV because it was less bulky than the David Clark suit, and could be easily modified for the new space role. The Mercury suit incorporated several changes from the Navy Mark IV: * Replacement of the \\"open loop\\" breathing system with a \\"closed loop\\" system, eliminating the rubber diaphragm around the wearer's face. Oxygen entered the suit through a hose connected at the wearer's waist, circulated through the suit to provide cooling, and exited through a hose on the right side of the helmet, or through the face opening depending on whether the faceplate was closed or open. A small pressure bottle connected by a small hose to a connector next to the astronaut's left jaw was used to pressurize a pneumatic seal when the faceplate was closed. * Replacement of the dark gray nylon outer shell with one made of aluminum-coated nylon, for thermal control purposes * Replacement of the black leather safety boots with ones made first from white coated leather, later aluminumized nylon-coated leather, again for thermal control. * Introduction of straps and zippers to provide a snug fit, along with refinements in the shoulder, elbow, and knee retaining cords * Special gloves with four curved fingers for grasping the controls, with the middle finger made straight for pushing buttons and flipping toggle switches. (In the book We Seven, the astronauts pointed out that the special design of the gloves allowed them to avoid the use of a \\"swizzle stick\\" for the buttons and switches.) * A \\"biomed\\" flap on the right thigh for the connection of biomedical connections to the spacecraft's telemetry systems. Each astronaut had three pressure suits: one for training, one for flight, and one for a backup. All three suits cost US$20,000 total and unlike the military Mark IV suits, had to be individually tailored to each astronaut. No Mercury pressure suit ever failed during launch. No manned Mercury capsule ever lost pressure during a mission, so the suits never needed to be inflated after launch. The only suit-related incident was an uncapped ventilation inlet valve which almost led to the drowning of astronaut Gus Grissom: at the end of the MR-4 mission the hatch cover blew off while in the Atlantic Ocean and the capsule began to fill with water, forcing Grissom to make an emergency exit without securing his suit for the recovery operations. The most frequent suit complaints of the astronauts were discomfort due to poor temperature control, and inability to turn the head within the pressurized suit.  Specifications  Mercury astronauts *Name:: Mercury Spacesuit *Derived from: Navy Mark IV *Manufacturer: B.F. Goodrich Company *Missions: MR-3 to MA-9 *Function: Intra- vehicular activity (IVA) *Pressure type: Full *Operating pressure: *Suit Weight: 22 lb (10 kg) *Primary life support: Vehicle provided *Backup life support: Vehicle provided  Later modifications  After the MR-3 flight in May 1961, the Mercury pressure suit underwent several changes to incorporate improvements, mainly for comfort and mobility. These changes included: * Incorporation of wrist bearings and ring locks on the sleeves starting with Grissom's MR-4 suit. Alan Shepard's MR-3 suit had gloves that were zippered onto the suit itself, preventing the astronaut from easily rotating his wrists to control the spacecraft's controllers. * Incorporation of a urine collection device (UCD) starting with the MR-4 suit. Shepard, going through long countdown delays, had had to urinate into the heavy cotton underwear in his suit; the engineers had felt a UCD was not needed because the flight itself was to last only 15 minutes. * Incorporation of a convex mirror, dubbed the \\"Hero Medal,\\" on the chest of the astronauts so that the same onboard camera used to record the astronaut could also cover the instrument panel, eliminating the weight of a separate camera which had been used for this purpose on MR-3. This was eliminated beginning with MA-8. * After the near drowning of astronaut Gus Grissom during recovery operations after the MR-4 a small inflatable life vest was worn on the astronaut's chest. In preparation for the final Mercury mission, flown by Gordon Cooper, the suit underwent the most modifications, most notably the replacement of the leather boots with ones incorporated directly into the suit. Other changes were made in the shoulder construction, along with the pressure helmet. A new mechanical seal for the faceplate eliminated the need for the small pressure bottle and hose, and incorporated new microphones and an oral thermometer; the latter eliminated the rectal thermometer used on prior flights. Cooper wore neither the convex mirror or the life vest. Shepard, who was Cooper's backup, had an identical flight and backup suit for the mission, and was to wear the modified suit for the cancelled MA-10 flight. MA-9 was the last flight of the Mercury pressure suit.  Later use  After Mercury, the pressure suit was used for the early development phases for the Gemini program, but because of the success of the X-15 high altitude pressure suit, the bigger room on the Gemini spacecraft, and the need to develop a suit for Extra-vehicular activity (EVA) outside the spacecraft, the Mercury suit was phased out of NASA service and was replaced with the basic G3C version of the X-15 suit. Since then, NASA has used either the David Clark Company, ILC Dover, Hamilton Sundstrand, or Oceaneering International for all pressure and spacesuit needs. B.F. Goodrich would only be used after Mercury for the production of the landing gear tires for the Space Shuttle, but this has since been done by Michelin.

It was founded in the 3rd century BC by Pyrrhus of Epirus, who named it after one of his wives, Antigone, daughter of Berenice I and step-daughter of Ptolemy I of Egypt. History \\"The straits near Antigoneia\\" were mentioned in 230 BC, when a force of Illyrians under Scerdilaidas passed the city to join an invading army further south. In 198 BC, during the Second Macedonian War, the Romans marched against the Macedonian armies of Philip V. His general, Athenagoras, was able to occupy one of the nearby passes, leading to the Romans being held back. Initially the Romans were going to negotiate peace, however, several treasonous sheperds led the Romans to be able to surround and destroy the Macedonian army of 2000 men. The inhabitants of Antigoneia had sided with the Macedonians and so when the Romans were victorious over the Macedonians in 167BC. Thus, the Romans decided to punish those who had fought against them. Consul Aemilius Paullus ordered for 70 towns in Epirus to be lit on fire. This included Antigoneia, which was never rebuilt. Antigonia is mentioned by the ancient authors Polybius, Livy, Pliny the Elder, and Ptolemy. A newly discovered church, on the floor of which there is a mosaic of Saint Christopher and a Greek emblem, testifying to the city‚Äôs existence in the palaeo-Christian period. However it seemed to be the last building constructed in ancient Antigonea, the church was destroyed during Slav assaults in the 6th century AD. Finds such as a bronze sphinx and a statue of Poseidon, which are exhibited in Tirana. There has also been evidence of pottery found across the hill in which the city was built, attesting to the size of the city at its peak. Its ruins are located just south of the village of Saraqinisht in the Antigon√´ municipal unit, Gjirokast√´r County, Albania. Now that area has been declared a National Archaeological Park by the Albanian Government. The ruins are accessible from Gjirokast√´r by car or by nature trail.Antigonea Archaeological Park website The Archaeological Park is also known for having organized since 2007 a yearly Festival of the Pagan Rites and the Popular Games (). Recently, the village has hosted an annual culinary exhibition showcasing the best of local organic production and traditional specialties. Central area of the ancient town of Antigonea in Epirus The ancient town was identified and excavated by the Albanian archaeologist Dhimosten Budina. More recently an Albanian-Greek team of archaeologists has been working on the site.Zacho, K.L, 'The Antigonea Project: Preliminary report on the first season' in Bejko and Hodges, 'New Directions in Albanian Archaeology' ICAA 2006  Description of the City  Ruins of Epirote house with peristyle The most impressive feature of the city are its walls, demolished by the Romans, which completely encircled the hill, which towered at 600 meters above sea level. The most visible gate in the walls is at the south-western portion of the city. In the city center, an entire ancient street is exposed. In the southern end of the city there is also the most well preserved portion of the city walls. The wall section terminates at the small early Christian church of triconch form, whose mosaic floor is decorated with a depiction of a strange illustration of a human with an animal head, resembling the Egyptian god Anubis or Saint Christopher.

USA. The school serves students in grades 9 through 12, with an enrollment of roughly 1,200. Constructed in 1923, Lincoln High School was designed by the Chicago-based firm of Perkins, Fellows, & Hamilton and its campus plan was designed by Jens Jensen. It is located on Roeff's Hill, along scenic Lake Michigan. The gothic-style building occupies on the south side of the city. School colors are red and white. The school's official team name is the \\"Shipbuilders\\", however, \\"Ships\\" is most often used. History The original building was finished in 1923, making Lincoln High School the oldest standing public high school in the state of Wisconsin. Since its completion, there have been eight renovations or additions to the school. The first was in 1930, with the addition of a pool. The west wing and third floor were added in 1942, followed by a first-floor library wing, a music wing, and a cafeteria wing in 1955. In 1956 the auditorium underwent its first major renovation. Built in 1961 was the John F. Kennedy Physical Education Center with a new girls' locker room. The original technology education wing was added in 1983. From 1996 to 2000, construction of a $16.5 million renovation and addition took place. These improvements included the addition of a new gymnasium and a new swimming pool to the J.F.K. Center, a new science lab wing, and an overhaul of the auditorium. This expansion added nearly to the school. In 2010, the floors, walls and bleachers in the J.F.K. Fieldhouse were renovated.

The squadron, known as the \\"Purple Foxes\\", is based at Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton, California and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 39 (MAG-39) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). Mission Provide utility combat helicopter support to the landing force in the ship to shore movement and in subsequent operations ashore. History =Early years= Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 364 was originally commissioned as Marine Light Helicopter Squadron 364 (HML-364) on September 1, 1961 at Marine Corps Air Facility Santa Ana, California. In November 1961, it received its first Sikorsky H-34 helicopter and in February 1962, the designation of the squadron was changed to its present title. In the spring of 1962, the squadron participated in Mid-Pacific operations to assist in recovering instruments that had been used in the atomic test program. =Vietnam War= In November 1963, the squadron deployed to Okinawa and subsequently to Da Nang Air Base, Republic of Vietnam. The squadron served in Vietnam until July 1964. Eight months later the squadron was back in South Vietnam, this time conducting operations, including operations with the Special Landing Force of the Seventh Fleet. HMM-364 remained in Vietnam until September 1966. The squadron was then placed in cadre status at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California and consisted of three officers and 12 enlisted Marines. In March 1967, the squadron was reorganized and began receiving the new Boeing CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters. In October of that year, HMM-364 re-deployed to the Republic of Vietnam, initially at Phu Bai and eventually at Marble Mountain. During this tour HMM-364 participated in operations Osceola, Kentucky, Mameluke Thrust, and Hue City and finally in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon. For almost half of its short 10-year existence, HMM-364 served in the Republic of Vietnam. During its three tours there, the squadron's pilots and crewmen flew almost 70,000 hours in combat and combat support missions and the squadron was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for meritorious conduct in the performance of duty. During this time period the squadron adopted the \\"Purple Fox\\" name from a cartoon purple fox mascot called Swifty. On March 22, 1971, the squadron folded its colors and was decommissioned. =The 1990s= On September 28, 1984, HMM-364 was reactivated at Marine Aircraft Group 24, 1st Marine Brigade, Fleet Marine Force, Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. On October 12, 1984, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. P. X. Kelley, publicly reactivated the squadron by presenting the unit colors to the Commanding Officer. In February 1990, the Purple Foxes deployed to Okinawa, Japan. From August 1990 to March 1991, HMM-364 was placed in reserve during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm becoming the sole supporting squadron for 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade. In June 1991, the Purple Foxes once again deployed to Okinawa. During the deployment, the squadron supported Marine Air Ground Task Force 4-90 in the Republic of the Philippines before, during and after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and resulting devastation. Continuing into 1992, the Purple Foxes would find themselves on the island Kauai, for Operation Garden Isle, performing humanitarian relief due to the devastation left by Hurricane Iniki. In February 1996, the Purple Foxes provided executive transport for President Clinton and other dignitaries while they toured flood damaged Portland, Oregon. This marked the first time in history that a U.S. President had flown in a Fleet Marine Force helicopter. On December 5, 1998, the squadron embarked aboard the USS Boxer (LHD-4) participating in Operation Southern Watch and various split-ARG operations off the Horn of Africa. In June 1999 the Purple Foxes returned off deployment and moved into their new home at Marine Aircraft Group 39 aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. The Purple Foxes began training to their new core competency of being part of 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing's \\"Fly In\\" Echelon for contingency operations. =Global War on Terror= In 2003, HMM-364 was tasked with preparing for a possible deployment to Kuwait in support of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force and Operation Iraqi Freedom. By the end of February, the squadron was off loaded, and all twelve CH-46E helicopters flown to Ali Al Salem Air Base. In conjunction with MAG-39 and its augments, HMM-364 began mission planning and rehearsals for combat operations against Iraq. An HMM-364 CH-46 over southern Iraq in 2003 Operation Iraqi Freedom commenced on the evening of March 20, 2003, following preliminary strikes by coalition forces and Ground to Ground Missile attacks by Iraqi forces on Ali Al Salem Air Base. HMM-364 was involved from the first night, supporting attacks by the 1st Marine Division's Regimental Combat Team 7, as well as the Royal Marines's 42 Commando. Squadron aircrews conducted Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) missions in direct support of RCT-7 Headquarters for the duration of the war, traveling with the 1st Marine Division from Basra to downtown Baghdad. HMM-364 aircraft also flew Logistical Support throughout the theater, flying over 640 hours in combat and direct combat support per month for both March and April. With the end of combat operations in Iraq on April 17, HMM-364 continued to fly CASEVAC and Logistical Support for the Marine Corps humanitarian aid work underway on the behalf of the Iraqi people. HMM-364 returned to MCB Camp Pendleton in October 2003. During this deployment, one of the squadron's aircraft was lost during a resupply mission crashing into a canal. All four aircrew were lost and one Marine not affiliated with the squadron drowned in an attempted rescue. The squadron deployed again to Iraq in the early months of 2005. Their third deployment to Iraq came in the summer of 2006 and they returned home in early 2007. During this deployment one of the squadron's aircraft was shot down during a CASEVAC mission resulting in the death of four squadron members, a Marine from another unit and two navy corpsmen.http://www.usmc.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/main5/D6CEC4FC18F0DBAF852572AE005DAB21?opendocument Marine Corps News The squadron's fourth deployment to Iraq occurred from early spring of 2008 until the fall of the same year. The squadron's fifth and final deployment to Iraq came in late 2009. They returned safety in early 2010 having successfully completed their mission.http://www.hmm-364.org/PF%20Newsletter%20-%20End%20of%20Mission.pdf On October 9, 2014, HMM-364 transitioned to the MV-22B Osprey and thus was redesignated as VMM-364.http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/oct/09/marine- helicopter-ch46-osprey-hmm364/ =Notable former members= * Eugene R.

It was the first privately owned daily in Serbia after more than 50 years of across-the-board public ownership under communism. Founded and owned by Slavko ƒÜuruvija, published in tabloid format with content that catered to the middle-market, Dnevni telegraf maintained high prominence and readership all throughout its run. History The newspaper benefited from its owner's personal relationship and access to Mirjana Markoviƒá, wife of Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. By getting a constant stream of relevant information from such a top source, the newspaper built up a sizable readership and a steady source of revenue. This ƒÜuruvija-Markoviƒá relationship was described as \\"non-aggression pact rather than friendship\\" by Aleksandar Tijaniƒá (ƒÜuruvija's friend and colleague, who had previously in 1996 for a short period performed the Information Minister role in the first cabinet of Milo≈°eviƒá's loyalist Mirko Marjanoviƒá, and later in 2004, three and a half years after Milo≈°eviƒá got overthrown, became RTS General-Director) in Kad re≈æim strelja commemorative documentary that premiered on 1 February 2006 on RTS. In the same documentary, ƒÜuruvija's common-law wife Branka Prpa added that her significant other's agreement with Markoviƒá had to do with the ruling couple's request for the paper to refrain from writing about the activities of their two grown children ‚Äî Marko and Marija. ƒÜuruvija was reportedly happy to grant them the wish in return for relevant day-to-day political info. Tijaniƒá also said the information from this highly informed source allowed ƒÜuruvija and Dnevni telegraf to put together hundreds of front pages over the years, developing a big staff and loyal readership in the process. Prpa went on to say: \\"Their relationship was centered around one-on-one conversations that Slavko probably engaged in, like other journalists at the time, hoping to provoke and maybe manipulate her into revealing more than she originally planned, but as time went on I think they became the ones being manipulated\\". =Problems start= The troubles for Dnevni telegraf started in October 1998 when the Serbian government led by prime minister Mirko Marjanoviƒá introduced a decree (uredba) outlining special measures in the wake of the NATO bombing threat. Using the decree, on 14 October 1998 the government's Ministry of Information headed by Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá decided to ban the publishing of Dnevni telegraf, Danas and Na≈°a borba dailies. In the case of Dnevni telegraf, the reason for this radical measure was listed to be the paper's supposed \\"spreading of defeatism by running subversive article headlines\\". Following the protests and pressure by domestic NGOs and foreign governments, the ban was lifted on 20 October 1998, only to be replaced by the infamous new Information Law that was passed on the same day. Obviously, the \\"non- aggression pact\\" between Mira Markoviƒá and Slavko ƒÜuruvija was off. At a time when NATO threatened with airstrikes, the regime was becoming more radicalized by the second. The real reason for its sudden attitude shift when it came to independent media, at least in Curuvija's case, probably lay in the fact that both Dnevni telegraf and its sister bi-weekly Evropljanin (published by the same umbrella company) reported very openly about the deteriorating situation in the Serbian southern province of Kosovo all throughout the summer and fall of 1998. The newspaper was also very critical of the regime's severe University Law that effectively took away the academic autonomy from the higher learning institutions in Serbia. Ruling coalition made up of SPS, SRS and Yugoslav Left was getting ready to pass another draconian piece of legislation - new Information Law that would give it enormous powers when it came to fining and disciplining the media. Following an unpleasant exchange with Mira Markoviƒá during the week when Dnevni telegraf was banned - their last ever conversation - ƒÜuruvija took Aleksandar Tijaniƒá's suggestion (he also wrote for Evropljanin at the time), and the two put together a strongly worded open letter to Milo≈°eviƒá entitled 'What's Next, Slobo?' signed by both of them. It was published in Evropljanin issue that came out on 19 October 1998, one day before the Information Law got urgently passed in the National Assembly. Regime's response was swift. The staff was served with a late-night court-summoning notice on a charge pressed by the Patriotic Alliance (Patriotski savez), a phantom organization with no prior history of existence - an obvious attempt at disguising the fact Yugoslav Left and Mira Markoviƒá were behind it all. After a 1-day trial on 23 October 1998, an YUM2.4 million (~DM350,000) fine was leveled at Evropljanin by the presiding judge Mirko ƒêorƒëeviƒá under the new Law for \\"endangering constitutional order\\", even if the incriminating issue appeared a full day before the law had been passed. Poster that appeared all over Belgrade on 14 November 1998 in the wake of Dnevni telegraf's exile On Sunday night, 25 October 1998, police entered the Dnevni telegraf and Evropljanin shared offices, located at the Borba building's 5th floor, and confiscated the entire next day's print of Dnevni telegraf. Since they found only 2 dinars on DT Press' bank account (ƒÜuruvija's company, publisher of both papers), the police started confiscating their business property, which covered about YUM60,000 of the amount owed. This also meant neither publication could go on. Furthermore, the police also entered the apartment of Ivan Tadiƒá, DT Press executive director and confiscated his furniture, which they appraised to be worth around DM1,100. They also attempted to enter apartments of company owner Slavko ƒÜuruvija as well as Dragan Bujo≈°eviƒá, Evropljanin editor-in-chief, but decided against it, probably fearing bigger media backlash. After two weeks of forced hiatus, the next issue of Dnevni telegraf came out on Saturday, 7 November 1998, featuring Otpor!'s clenched fist logo on the front page along with the movement's ad urging peaceful resistance to authorities. Regime reacted immediately. After forcing Politika AD to stop distributing Dnevni telegraf and Borba to revoke its printing privileges, it also pressed another private citation (prekr≈°ajna prijava). This time by one Bratislava Buba Morina of the \\"Yugoslav Women Association\\" (Savez ≈æena Jugoslavije), yet another phantom organization. Ms. Morina alleged Dnevni telegraf \\"attempted to violently destroy the constitutional order of Yugoslavia\\" by running an ad that \\"endangered women and children of Yugoslavia\\". In another quickie trial on 8 November 1998, the paper was slapped with a YUM1.2 million (US$120,000) fine. This would prove to be the final nail in its coffin as far as continuing to publish in Serbia went. Around 10 p.m., on 9 November 1998, twenty employees of Serbian public revenue service seized the entire circulation of Dnevni telegraf which was to be distributed the next day. =Move to Podgorica= ƒÜuruvija decided to move the production to Podgorica where the next issue rolled off the presses on November 17, 1998. The problem now became transporting the paper back into Serbia every day. Since Dnevni telegraf was officially banned for failing to pay the large fines, it had to be smuggled in and sold clandestinely. Most of the run was regularly impounded, but certain numbers of copies would usually make it through. Since he was now engaged in a draining open conflict with the regime, financially strapped ƒÜuruvija for the first time turned to American organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy for funding. Also, through contacts, he arranged to speak before the United States Congress' Helsinki Commission in early December 1998. Back home, Dnevni telegraf continued to be printed in Montenegro and smuggled into Serbia, with a constant threat of financial charges being turned into criminal ones. On December 5, 1998, an article about a murdered surgeon Aleksandar Popoviƒá appeared in the paper, claiming the deceased criticized Minister of Health Milovan Bojiƒá. Minister responded by pressing charges on grounds of \\"smeared honour and reputation\\" under the new information law. That resulted in another 450,000 dinar fine for the paper. Few months later, in March, public prosecutor pressed criminal charges in Bojiƒá case against ƒÜuruvija as well as two Dnevni telegraf journalists, Srƒëan Jankoviƒá and Zoran Lukoviƒá, for \\"disseminating false information\\". That led to one more quickie trial on March 8, 1999 and a 5-month jail sentence for the trio. In late March 1999, as it became certain NATO would soon commence its air campaign against Serbia, ƒÜuruvija decided he did not want to continue publishing in such circumstances. He announced the decision at what turned out to be the last staff meeting, while also adding he hoped to see everyone back once the air strikes end. The newspaper stopped publishing on Wednesday, March 24, 1999 - the first day of the air strikes. The screaming headline on the front page of the last issue was \\"Spreƒçite rat\\" (Avert the war). That would never happen, unfortunately, since on Easter Sunday April 11, 1999 in the middle of NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia, Slavko ƒÜuruvija was murdered in a professional hit style execution. This also marked the end of Dnevni telegraf.

She was commissioned 24 April 1986. Matagorda was one of eight of the 110-foot cutters to be modified under the Integrated Deepwater System Program aka. \\"Deepwater\\" to 123-foot. She was taken out of service about December 2006 due to problems with the Deepwater conversion. Conversion The United States Coast Guard Cutter Matagorda (WPB-1303) was part of the 110-foot Island-class patrol boat cutters. The vessel's design was based on highly accredited patrol boats from Great Britain, the Vosper Thornycroft patrol boat. It replaced the older 95-foot Cape-class cutter with these U.S. island-named cutters. Matagorda was built by Bollinger Shipyard on April 24, 1986, in Lockport, Louisiana. In 2004, as part of a program called Deepwater, the Coast Guard wanted to extend the life of the 110 foot Island- class cutters, stationed in Key West, Florida. The eight cutters being modified were the USCGC Matagorda (WPB-1303), , , , , , and the .Alpert, B. (August 18, 2011). \\"Feds Sue Bollinger Shipyards Over 'Unseaworthy' Coast Guard Ships\\". New Orleans Business News. Retrieved March 28, 2012. They were scheduled to go through a refit, which included adding 13 feet to the stern to make a high-speed launching ramp for a smaller patrol boat.Mitchell-Jones, M. (N.D.) \\"Matagorda to be Modernized\\". Deepwater. Vol. 1 Sec. 1 Retrieved April 2, 2012. This renovation was to also replace the original superstructure to accommodate mixed-gender crews while also adding new electronics, berthing reconfigurations, galley upgrades, and communication equipment. With these new additions and extension, this vessel was transformed from an Island-class ship to a blue-water vessel. Sea trials In September 2004, after all eight ships were introduced to the refurbishment plan and the first four had been delivered, sea trials were begun to determine how effective the 15-year life extension program was. During the sea trials, the lead ship Matagorda was forced to conduct a high speed transit to avoid Hurricane Ivan. At one point, she was running at approximately in Sea State Five conditions, which involve eight to twelve foot seas. Upon arrival at her home port in Key West, Florida, the crew discovered buckling of the side and main deck on the starboard side near midships. Once spotted, the Coast Guard ordered inspections on the remainder of the fleet. Similar cracking problems subsequently occurred on the next three vessels coming off the water. Upon further assessments on the remaining ships, cracks were found in all eight ships and were getting worse. These cracks got so severe, pinhole breaches were found in the hulls. The shipyard wasted no time trying to repair and strengthen the hulls, but the converted cutters continued to crack at high speed in rough seas. Efforts to repair the Matagorda and the other vessels in the fleet were unsuccessful. The cutters were reported unseaworthy and were taken out of service. Sea trial results Integrated Support Command New Orleans, Louisiana, on 27 March 2004. Matagorda made a brief stop in New Orleans on the way to her home port in Key West, Florida. The refit added about 15 tons to the vessel's displacement, and reduced its maximum speed by approximately one knot. This added length and weight caused unexpected flexing on the ships' decks, causing cracks. At least one cutter had warping so severe; its engines were no longer fully seated, while another ship's fuel tanks were deformed to the point of leakage. Another problem these cutters faced after their intended improvement was their steering. The steering system was mangled so badly, they had problems maintaining course, even at speeds slower than ten knots. The propeller shaft design was flawed also, growing steadily misaligned with the engines once the cracking of the hulls began. The maritime waste disposal systems were also damaged to the point of being below specification. There was poor welding and sloppy workmanship throughout the ships that also attributed to the failing of these vessel' hulls. The communications system was a complete fiasco too, barely functional and completely unsecure. All of the work done by Bollinger for the Deepwater System Program was done insufficiently and all contributed to the failing of these ships. Legal liability In January 2008, the United States Coast Guard made an unusual move of demanding a partial refund of $96.1 million, but the request was withdrawn later in the year due to possible criminal charges that could be faced, enforced by the Department of Justice.Anonymous. (September 8, 2011). \\"Suit filed against Bollinger Shipyards\\". Marine Log. Retrieved April 20, 2012 from ABI/Inform. In addition to the Coast Guard, the Justice department also sued Bollinger Shipyards for damages towards the Coast Guard Cutter Matagorda and seven other boats in that fleet.Anton, J. (May 18, 2007) \\"Coast Guard Deepwater Program\\". Congressional Quarterly. Retrieved April 2, 2012 from LexisNexis. The Coast Guard paid hundreds of millions of dollars towards Bollinger for this refit, and has tried to file for reimbursement 65 times once the Matagorda had displayed the six inch crack in its hull. The suit was dismissed. Conclusion In late 2005, sea state restrictions were given to the cutters requiring better workmanship and quality for construction in the future. At the same time, these refits were halted with only eight out of the intended 49 cutters actually being worked on. On November 30, 2006, Admiral Thad Allen, Coast Guard Commandant, personally gave a direct order to immediately decommission all eight converted ships. The crews were dispersed to other cutters in the United States Coast Guard Seventh District and the ships were towed to the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland, where they remain in a \\"mothballed\\" state as of February 2014, pending likely scrapping. The 110-foot patrol boats proved to be an effective addition to the drug and immigration enforcement, search and rescue, and fishery law enforcement. The Island-class cutter design is approaching a period of time where the remaining 110 foot cutters are aging and will either not be maintained adequately or will not be replaced by something newer. A Coast Guard committee found this situation unacceptable and wanted immediate action to avoid any loss in the Coast Guard's operational readiness or national maritime security. The Coast Guard ended the Deepwater Conversion plan early enough to save upwards of $80,000,000 originally planned to be spent altering these vessels. While the Coast Guard has sped up the development associated with the Fast Response Cutter and Sentinel-class cutter, with the 123-foot conversion program idled, there are fewer small patrol craft due to the absence of the converted patrol boats being taken out of service. The fact that six 110-foot cutters are absent due to supporting the Global War on Terror is further complicating the ability of the Coast Guard to have adequate underway patrol coverage domestically. The six deployed cutters have no expected date of return from overseas duty.Obey, R & Sabo, M. (2006) Committee Reports. \\"Department Of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill\\". Retrieved April 20, 2012. The Coast Guard sued Bollinger, in 2003, and Bollinger paid a $8.5 million settlement in December 2015.

This colourless gas has a strong ammonia-like odor. It condenses just below room temperature to a liquid miscible with virtually all solvents. It is a nucleophilic base, as is typical for amines. Ethylamine is widely used in chemical industry and organic synthesis. Synthesis Ethylamine is produced on a large scale by two processes. Most commonly ethanol and ammonia are combined in the presence of an oxide catalyst: :CH3CH2OH + NH3 ‚Üí CH3CH2NH2 \\\\+ H2O In this reaction, ethylamine is coproduced together with diethylamine and triethylamine. In aggregate, approximately 80M kilograms/year of these three amines are produced industrially.Karsten Eller, Erhard Henkes, Roland Rossbacher, Hartmut H√∂ke, \\"Amines, Aliphatic\\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. It is also produced by reductive amination of acetaldehyde. :CH3CHO + NH3 \\\\+ H2 ‚Üí CH3CH2NH2 \\\\+ H2O Ethylamine can be prepared by several other routes, but these are not economical. Ethylene and ammonia combine to give ethylamine in the presence of a sodium amide or related basic catalysts.Ulrich Steinbrenner, Frank Funke, Ralf B√∂hling, Method and device for producing ethylamine and butylamine , United States Patent 7161039. :H2C=CH2 \\\\+ NH3 ‚Üí CH3CH2NH2 Hydrogenation of acetonitrile, acetamide, and nitroethane affords ethylamine. These reactions can be effected stoichiometrically using lithium aluminium hydride. In another route, ethylamine can be synthesized via nucleophilic substitution of a haloethane (such as chloroethane or bromoethane) with ammonia, utilizing a strong base such as potassium hydroxide. This method affords significant amounts of byproducts, including diethylamine and triethylamine.Nucleophilic substitution, Chloroethane & Ammonia , St Peter's School :CH3CH2Cl + NH3 \\\\+ KOH ‚Üí CH3CH2NH2 \\\\+ KCl + H2O Ethylamine is also produced naturally in the cosmos; it is a component of interstellar gases.NRAO, \\"Discoveries Suggest Icy Cosmic Start for Amino Acids and DNA Ingredients\\", Feb 28 2013 Reactions Like other simple aliphatic amines, ethylamine is a weak base: the pKa of [CH3CH2NH3]+ has been determined to be 10.8Wilson and Gisvold's Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, 9th Ed.

Azoethane , Organic Syntheses, Collected Volume 6, p.78 (1988) Ethylamine may be oxidized using a strong oxidizer such as potassium permanganate to form acetaldehyde. Ethylamine like some other small primary amines is a good solvent for lithium metal, giving the ion [Li(amine)4]+ and the solvated electron. Such solutions are used for the reduction of unsaturated organic compounds, such as naphthalenesKaiser, E. M.; Benkeser R. A. Œî9,10-Octalin , Organic Syntheses, Collected Volume 6, p.852 (1988) and alkynes. Applications Ethylamine is a precursor to many herbicides including atrazine and simazine. It is found in rubber products as well. Ethylamine is used as a precursor chemical along with benzonitrile (as opposed to o-chlorobenzonitrile and methylamine in ketamine synthesis) in the clandestine synthesis of cyclidine dissociative anesthetic agents (the analogue of ketamine which is missing the 2-chloro group on the phenyl ring, and its N-ethyl analog) which are closely related to the well known anesthetic agent ketamine and the recreational drug phencyclidine and have been detected on the black market, being marketed for use as a recreational hallucinogen and tranquilizer. This produces a cyclidine with the same mechanism of action as ketamine (NMDA receptor antagonism) but with a much greater potency at the PCP binding site, a longer half-life, and significantly more prominent parasympathomimetic effects.

Eastwood maintains Houston‚Äôs largest intact collection of Craftsman, Arts & Crafts, Foursquare and Mission style architecture. History =Early development= Eastwood was one of Houston‚Äôs first master-planned subdivisions. It was designed and developed in 1911 by William A. Wilson, who also developed Eastwood's sister neighborhood, Woodland Heights. The first lots went on sale in June 1912 and Eastwood officially opened in September 1913. A few of the homes were built between 1900 and 1909, prior to the official platting of the neighborhood. The development was planned with shelled streets that were sixty to eighty feet in width, cement curbs and sidewalks, city water, gas, electricity, telephones and sanitary sewerage, as well as terraced lots designed for natural drainage. One of the unique features of the neighborhood is the symmetrically planned placement of live oak and sycamore trees. Wilson envisioned Eastwood to be a more upscale counterpart to the Woodland Heights subdivision, which he previously developed in Houston. Utility service connections were placed at the rear of the lots to avoid marring the landscape of the community streets. A boulevard driveway was built through the center of the neighborhood, which skirted a natural ravine that provided lush greenery and a drainage route for surplus water to empty into Brays Bayou. The ravine was later filled and planted with cypress trees; it is currently the esplanade dividing Park Drive. By October 1913, Eastwood was hailed by The Houston Daily Post as a ‚Äúmodel suburb, one of the most convenient, attractive and beautiful homesite additions in the city of Houston.\\" =Notable early residents= The first residents were young entrepreneurs in the city, primarily business owners and management personnel. Its reputation as one of Houston's rising preeminent suburban neighborhoods attracted wealthy and notable residents, including: *Howard Tellepsen, former president of Tellepsen Builders *Charles L. Bering, owner of Bering's Hardware *Ira G. Bond *March Culmore, President of the Sam Houston Trust Co. Howard Hughes is believed to have lived for a brief period with his aunt on McKinney Street while he was building an airplane in a garage on nearby Eastwood Street, in addition to his oil-drilling machinery manufacturing business, the Hughes Tool Company, which moved to 5425 Polk Street in the 1940s. =Architectural style= The homes built in Eastwood were custom homes reflecting the early 20th century fondness for Craftsman, Arts & Crafts, American Foursquare and Mission styles of architecture. Today, Eastwood remains Houston‚Äôs largest intact collections of Craftsman, Arts & Crafts, and Mission-style homes. Influences from the Prairie-style of architecture, which branched from the Arts and Crafts movement, can be seen in some houses. Cityscape Eastwood is in proximity to Minute Maid Park (formerly Enron Field and Astros Field) and Downtown Houston. YuShan Chang, author of Newcomer's Handbook Neighborhood Guide: Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Austin, said that Eastwood is in proximity to \\"the city's major sports venues, fine arts district, and nightlife.\\"Chang, p. 129. At a later point, Eastwood was \\"characterized by graffiti, abandoned buildings, and blight\\". In 1997, Lori Rodriguez of the Houston Chronicle said that it is \\"considered a forerunner of today's planned communities.\\".Rodriguez, Lori. \\"NEIGHBORLY NEEDS/Help for homeless touches raw nerve in the East End.\\" Houston Chronicle. Sunday March 16, 1997. A1. Retrieved on November 4, 2011. However, it wasn't until 1998 that a revitalization of the area commenced. Gentrification (1998‚Äì2017) Between 1998 and 2013 the price per square foot of the Eastwood subdivision more than doubled‚Äîjumping from $55.75 per square foot in 1998 to $117.46 in 2013. The average price per square foot has continued to increase year-over-year: $132.81 in 2014, $143.63 in 2015, $152.31 in 2016, $169.14 in 2017 and $181.88 in 2018. It continues to evolve into a \\"lovely neighborhood that is aesthetically on par with some of Houston's esteemed residential areas\\" that is attracting young families, single professionals, and couples who restored the older houses. Many people who find houses in the Houston Heights and Montrose unaffordable opt to buy in Eastwood. Chang said that Eastwood was \\"a good option for those desiring to live in a close-knit neighborhood with the grace, history, and character of the Heights, but without the price tag\\". However, with high demand and sale prices on the rise, Eastwood has been developing a reputation as \\"the new Heights\\". Landmarks * The Tellepsen home at 4518 Park Drive was built in 1916 by Tom and Ingeborg Tellepsen, of Tellepsen Builders. The style of the house is an architecturally distinct \\"airplane bungalow\\", also known as a \\"hangar craftsman.\\" The home features large windows and deep eaves, characteristic of the Craftsman style homes. * Church of the Redeemer (Houston, Texas) * The former Maxwell House coffee factory on Harrisburg Boulevard has been a prominent fixture in Houston‚Äôs East End for more than five decades. The factory was once the site of a Ford Motor Company Model T plant at the turn of the century. General Foods purchased the old Ford assembly plant in 1947 and opened the Maxwell House Coffee manufacturing facility in its place. Kraft Foods purchased the factory in 1988. The factory continues to produce coffee today. With its soaring tower and intricate neon sign in a perpetual face-off with downtown structures, the factory hints at one of the most interesting but little-known facets of East End commerce: three of America‚Äôs largest coffee roasters and distributors call the East End home. Maxwell House, Cadeco Industries, Inc. and Sara Lee Coffee & Tea. The plant is now operated by Atlantic Coffee Solutions. A massive mural made entirely from coffee beans was built in 1959 and is still preserved at the plant today. * Eastwood is home to Tlaquepaque Plaza, a shopping center originally named the Eastwood Shopping Center.

At that time, the facility was operated predominantly by female factory workers to remanufacture 2,200 green U.S. Army Jeeps and 4,000 Sherman tank engines. The facility is believed to have previously been built in the 1920s for use as a wagon factory. * The former Hughes Tool Company headquarters were located at 5425 Polk in the 1940s.

This brief work shares the style, humor, and underlying cultural commentary of Robbins' better-known novels. It is recognized as a response to 9/11 and as a commentary on the Vietnam War. Characters Villa Incognito begins with the story of Tanuki, an ancient Japanese badger-like creature who possesses the ability to shapeshift and a penchant for sake and women. Tanuki is a \\"semi- god\\" with an unusually large scrotum and is portrayed alongside a beautiful young female character, who continues Tanuki's lineage with the use of a chrysanthemum seed embedded in the roof of her mouth, three American MIAs who deliberately remain in Laos long after US involvement in the Vietnam War has ended, and two sisters, who are related to one of the missing American soldiers. Plot The novel is set in the present day. Its title refers to a house ins Laos inhabited by three American Air Force pilots who have been missing since the Vietnam War. Following the arrest of one of the MIAs, for trafficking drugs while dressed as a priest, the novel depicts American life in a post-9/11 context through the involvement of the two sisters.

He lived in Manhattan, New York. He was born in Katowice, Poland and lived there until the dual Nazi and Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. He was affiliated with Congregation B‚Äônai Israel Chaim in New York. He was a member of Radomsk Chassidic movement. His original family name, Koszycki, was changed by his father while the family still lived in Poland. His father, a successful businessman, and close associate of the Radomsker Rebbe, moved to pre-war Palestine. After Rabbi Besser escaped Poland and Europe in 1939, he was reunited with his family in Tel Aviv. He came to the United States in 1949, together with members of his family. He is the subject of a book written by Warren Kozak called The Rabbi of 84th Street. He appeared in the television program The Jews of New York talking about the experience of Jews in pre-World War II Germany. Rabbi Besser was the principal spiritual leader of the renewal of Polish Jewish life, and traveled there frequently to teach until not long before the end of his life. He helped to find Jews and rebuild Jewish life in Poland towards the end of the communist era, partnering with Ronald S. Lauder. This partnership established Rabbi Besser as the Director of the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation for Poland. He found Rabbi Michael Schudrich, currently Chief Rabbi of Poland, to move Poland to establish Jewish communal life, on behalf of the Lauder Foundation. In addition to his work to restore Jewish communal life, he also helped restore many Jewish holy sites in Poland, negotiating with the Polish government on preserving the legacy of Polish Jewry before the war. One of those Jewish cemeteries is in O≈õwiƒôcim, where his maternal grandparents are buried. Among his children are Rabbi Shlomo Besser, a Rabbi and teacher active for the cemeteries of Eastern Europe and Aliza Grund, President of the women's division of the Agudah. His two other children are Mrs. Debbie Rosenberg of London, England and Rabbi Naftali Besser of Brooklyn, New York. Yisroel Besser, author of Warmed By Their Fire, is his grandson. Rabbi Yonah Bookstein, former Director of The Ronald S. Lauder Foundation in Poland, and currently a rabbi of Pico Shul, is one of his students. In 1992, Besser sent Bookstein to Poland to work at the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation Summer Camp with Rabbi Schudrich.

It was a diesel powered locomotive in the pre-TOPS period built by Hudswell Clarke with a Gardner engine. The mechanical transmission, using a scoop control fluid coupling and four-speed Power-flow SSS (synchro-self- shifting) gearbox,Durham Mining Museum - Colliery Engineering was a Hudswell Clarke speciality. The D2/12 was mechanically similar to the earlier British Rail Class D2/7 but was of more modern appearance. The engine casing was lower, giving much better all-round visibility. After British Rail D2519 was employed at NCB Hatfield Main, Doncaster, South Yorkshire as a shunter. It was located there until at least 1984. D2511 is preserved at the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway.Marshall, A.

They quickly proved their effectiveness, and although they were not immediately replicated due to the advent of the Second World War, the class were the basis for a larger class of similar locomotives introduced by Oliver Bulleid in 1949. Background and Construction Once the UK economy began to improve in the mid 1930s, the Southern Railway had further need for heavy shunting locomotives in its marshalling yards around London. The Z class steam locomotives had proved successful for this task but Maunsell wanted to compare their performance with diesel-electric alternatives. He therefore sought authorisation for the construction of three experimental locomotives for use in the busy Norwood marshalling yard where there was a continuous need for such locomotives. No private manufacturer was in a position to build the new locomotives and so they were jointly constructed by the Southern Railway's Ashford works, who constructed the framing, cabs and bodywork, and English Electric Ltd of Preston, who fitted the traction motors. The three locomotives were also provided with duplicate controls to enable them to be driven by one man from either side of the cab. They were delivered during September and October 1937. Operation After a few teething problems, the class quickly proved the advantages of diesel electric shunters in terms of effectiveness, cost-saving, and driver comfort. Although at ¬£7,275 they cost ¬£1,100 more to build than a Z class steam locomotive, each one saved about ¬£1,700 per year in operating costs. They could be used continually day and night for six days each week at Norwood without any service requirement beyond refuelling. They were however found to be too slow for their secondary task of freight transfers around the congested passenger lines in the London area, although perfectly well suited to this traffic on rural lines. As a result of these experiments Maunsell's successor, Oliver Bulleid, received authorisation to build a further eight members of the class in July 1939 but this order was quickly cancelled as a result of the outbreak of the Second World War. Between 1941 and 1945 the locomotives were commandeered by the War Department for use on the Martin Mill military railway to haul cross-channel gun installations and ammunition. (Diesel locomotives were required for this task as they would not give away their position to enemy gunners.) They were returned to the Southern Railway in 1945. Following the formation of British Railways in 1948, twenty-six similar, but lighter locomotives were constructed to Bulleid's design. These later became British Rail Class 12. The three original locomotives continued their traditional work around London. Two of the locomotives were however loaned to the Western Region between 1951 and 1953 for use at the Acton marshalling yard. After replacement at Norwood by more modern locomotives they worked as shunters at Hither Green marshalling yard, at Eastleigh and Ashford works. One was also tried out at Lancing Carriage Works in 1961 as a replacement for the aged \\"Stroudley Terrier\\" but was found to be too slow. Although they were still in good operating condition, the locomotives were withdrawn in November and December 1964, as by then the Southern Region had many modern replacements. None have been preserved. Numbering The original intention was to number the locomotives 958 to 960, following on from the steam locomotives of the Z class, but as delivered they were numbered 1 to 3 in a separate list from the SR's steam locomotives. They were later renumbered by British Railways 15201‚Äì15203.

He is currently under contract as the youth coach of Lazio. C√©sar won 2 Serie A titles with Inter and 2 Coppa Italia titles, one with Inter and the other with Lazio; he represented Brazil on 2 occasions, both in 2001. Playing career Born in S√£o Paulo, C√©sar started his career at CA Juventus, a small S√£o Paulo team at the time. In 1994 his team was promoted to the top division of the state and the team was awarded an amount of money for the success; however this money was stolen, and C√©sar was discovered to be involved, giving information about the delivery, and sentenced to 5 years and 4 months of jail. In 1998, he was released, and returned to football, thanks to the intervention of S√£o Caetano, a team which had signed him one year before being arrested, and loaned to Uni√£o Barbarense, a satellite club. When back to S√£o Caetano, C√©sar immediately became a key player, even becoming the team captain. He then led his team from minor leagues up to the National Brazilian championship finals in 2000. After being tracked by Lazio for some time, in the summer of 2001 C√©sar joined the Italian Serie A team, becoming an important player for the Roman club. In January 2006, after a long courtship, Inter Milan loaned C√©sar, giving him the opportunity to play in one of the leading teams of Italy. At the summer of 2006, the contract with Lazio ended. Cesar joined Inter, signed a long term contract. But C√©sar was transferred to major Brazilian S√©rie A team Corinthians on loan. However, on December 2006, the end of Brazilian season, C√©sar declared his willingness to return to play in Italy; he signed by Livorno on loan on 25 January 2007, to replace the left of C√©sar Prates. On 11 February 2007, he played his first Serie A match for Livorno against Inter He started the 2007‚Äì08 season in good form with Internazionale linking up well with Maxwell down the left flank even managing to get a goal. However, since then, he has been dropped from the squad again, and only featured against Torino, for 45 minutes, during which he disappointed many Inter fans, and was taken off at half time for Luis Jim√©nez, due to the large number of injuries the Inter squad had suffered. The summer of 2008 saw C√©sar clubless, after his contract with Inter expired. Cesar did not sign for a club in the 2008 summer transfer season, leaving him clubless for the first half of the 2008-09 season. On 18 November 2008, C√©sar signed for Bologna, coached by his former Inter assistant coach, Sini≈°a Mihajloviƒá.Cesar signs for Bologna Goal.com accessed 18 November 2008.

The mall was officially opened for business on March 7, 1968, and demolished in 1999. It once was largest covered shopping centre west of the Mississippi River.Englewood City Council, Colorado History of Cinderella City Mall Retrieved 24 May 2010 Layout The mall featured four sections: Rose Mall, Gold Mall, Shamrock Mall, and Cinder Alley. Cinder Alley, one of the two basement corridors in the mall, simulated a New York City street, complete with outdoor-esque facades and streetlamps. The ceiling tiles were painted black to simulate a sort of \\"night on the town\\" effect. The Shamrock Mall and Cinder Alley were not linked. To go from one mall to the other, one had to go up to the fountain area to cross over. While inconvenient on the one hand it allowed for an automobile underpass, thus allowing Cinderella City patrons to search for parking spaces without having to drive around the mall's massive exterior. The Center Court area was known as the Blue Mall. The names and large head and shoulder shadow profiles of those responsible for the building of Cinderella City were memorialized on the floor of the Blue Mall. The original southwest anchor of the mall was Cinderella City Cinema. The cinema had no interior mall entrance, only its own exterior entrance. The entrance was marked by two-story arches that mimicked those in the center fountain area. The cinema also had a novel and unique feature: all the toilet stalls in the restrooms had their own sinks and vanity areas. History = Construction = In the early 1960s, developer Gerri Von Frellick proposed to build a new shopping center on what was then the KLZ (560 AM) radio tower property in Denver. Neighboring residents around the proposed property were asked for their opinion on the new shopping center, and fearing a disruption in their community, rejected the idea,Englewood City Council, Colorado History of Cinderella City Mall Retrieved 24 May 2010 and in turn the zoning board did the same. After being rejected in Denver, Von Frellick approached Englewood in an attempt to buy a park spanning more than to build his mall. The park sat directly opposite the Englewood City Hall and the Englewood Public Library. The zoning board accepted his proposal, the task of designing and building the mall remained. The newly purchased area was rectangular in that it was longer east/west than it was north/south. Von Frellick would not let the area restrict the mall's size, so he designed it with an unorthodox shape. Looking at an aerial photograph, the mall appeared to be a large \\"M\\". Each leg of the \\"M\\" shape would have a code name. On the second floor, the western wing of the mall was named Rose Mall, and the eastern wing was named Gold Mall. On the bottom floor, the corridors were Shamrock Mall and Sunflower Mall, respectively. The original plans called for a structure with a one block cylindrical center court, four anchors, and surrounded in parking garages. As the plan was eventually refined, the \\"M\\" shape remained, although minor changes were made to other components. During refining, Sunflower Mall became Cinder Alley. Von Frellick's original name for the creation was \\"Cinderella City,\\" which Englewood city officials did not support. After months of debating, the name, a combination of Von Frellick's original idea, and ideas from the community, was officially \\"New Englewood: The Cinderella City.\\" The name was shortened to \\"Cinderella City\\" just months after its opening. Construction of the structure was difficult due to the sheer size of the project, but was also complicated by the fact that the land was a landfill prior to being a park. The landfill deteriorated the soil, and installing the massive concrete pillars was a daunting task because the soil was so far eroded, it shifted horribly. On March 7, 1968, the mall officially opened. On the east end, however, construction was still progressing. The east anchor, along with adjacent stores and corridors, was still under construction. Pedestrian and vehicular traffic was routed around the areas still under construction. Dedication and official opening of the mall was marked by Von Frellick's wife turning on the fountain in the center court. Over 20,000 people attended the first grand opening. A few weeks later, after the east end of the mall was finished, a second grand opening was held to officially dedicate the rest of the stores. = 1970s = Through the early 1970s, business was spectacular at Cinderella City. It was said that over 15,000 people visited the mall daily. Management received hundreds of applications from potential tenants, although all spaces were filled. For the first few years, the mall's 14,000 parking spacesCinderella City: the Rise and Fall of a Memorable Mall, Part 2 were filled to capacity and some visitors had to park in blocks surrounding the mall. Guy \\"Yug\\" London, a professional artist, painted surrealistic work in a public area in the mall. He initially sold these paintings in the center court, and later moved to Cinder Alley. Originally designed as a single large screen theater the cinema was unable to compete with the areas growing multi-plex cinemas. It closed for renovation and reopened as a two screen multi-plex. This however was not enough to stave off the competition of theaters with more screens, eventually the cinema closed and was bulldozed, leaving Neusteter's as the southwest anchor. During a routine structural inspection, workers found cracking on a pillar in the JCPenney store on the mall's north side. Fearing a structural failure, they checked other places for similar fractures, and found the massive parking deck was also becoming unsafe. The mall closed for over two months for structural repairs. = 1980s = Rose Mall following the 1981-1984 renovation. As other shopping center competition popped up, Cinderella City management, now in the hands of KRAVCO, decided to embark on an enormous renovation project for the mall that would last three years, 1981 to 1984. The renovation plan changed almost everything except for the basic layout of the mall. The original concrete floors were replaced with parquetry. Skylights and square holes were added in some concourses, allowing shoppers on the first floor to view the basement shoppers, as well as allowing more light into the basement areas. However, the light did not reach Cinder Alley. One of the largest aspects of the renovation was removing the fountain along with its massive plumbing from the center court. A section of parking garage under the center court was replaced with a food court. Additionally, the floor of the center court was modified to integrate the new food court with the remainder of the mall, by way of large squares cut into the floor to allow light to pass through. A large tree was also installed, which grew from the food court level through to the center court above. This modification of the original design also took away the automobile underpass that allowed drivers to avoid driving all the way around the mall to find a parking space. In addition to interior changes, another change concerned the southwest anchor, Colorado-based store, Neusteter's. This building was demolished and became the top-scale Broadway Southwest store, which later became May D&F; and subsequently Foley's. In the mid 1980s, new shopping malls around Colorado began opening, posing threats to Cinderella City's financial status and reputation, including Southwest Plaza, which opened in 1983 (the May D&F; anchor opened in time for Christmas 1982), and Cherry Creek Mall, which underwent a renovation and reopened in August 1990 with many upscale anchors and boutiques. Each brought new designs and new tenants, causing Cinderella City to appear dated. Cinder Alley's collection of oddball stores and head shops were forced out during renovations, leaving it empty except for two arcades. = 1990s = One of the main entrances of the deserted Cinderella City Mall during its vacant days. Although the newly renovated mall rejuvenated foot traffic and sales, continued competition, as well as more physical problems with the mall structure itself, caused tenants to begin leaving the mall in the early 1990s. Gated storefronts became more and more prevalent as time wore on, until, in the mid 1990s, entire anchors began to close. Foley's, at the west end of the mall, was the first to leave in early 1994. JCPenney closed their store a few months later. With their demise, the Gold Mall and Cinder Alley corridors were eventually closed to the public. Following this trend, the remaining 100 or so tenants that occupied the facility also began to leave. Joslins, anchoring the east wing of the mall, closed in 1995 to relocate to nearby Southglenn Mall. The last remaining anchor, Montgomery Ward, remained in the semi-abandoned mall until December 1997, when it was forced to end its lease so the property could be redeveloped. This officially marked the operational end for Cinderella City.  Redevelopment  During the following years, the City of Englewood would create, revise, and reject in excess of 30 plans to redevelop the Cinderella City site. Plans ranged from complete demolition and turning the land into a park, to keeping the structure and converting it to an art museum. Ideas came and went, but Cinderella City sat empty and decaying for two years. In 1998, a final plan was adopted to rehabilitate the area with transit-oriented development. Catalyzed by a future Regional Transportation District (RTD) light rail station, Englewood planned on remaking the former mall site as a \\"downtown\\", complete with luxury apartments, mixed-use retail and residential buildings, and \\"big box\\" stores such as Walmart, Office Depot, and The Sports Authority. Beginning in late 1998, the demolition process began. Due to the presence of asbestos and lead-based paint in the mall, as well as oil and gas hazards at the JCPenney Auto Center, Englewood actually had to form a whole new committee for large-scale environmental cleanups. During the long asbestos abatement process, immigrant workers were caught engaging in misconduct inside of the mall, reportedly throwing hazardous materials at each other. An inspector reported the incident, and requested that the abatement process come to a halt. During the abatement, progress was slow due to lack of funds and labor, but following the city's decision to terminate the asbestos abatement phase, the demolition was quickly carried out. To demolish the structure, the team used large bulldozers and literally drove through the mall, demolishing everything except for the structural members themselves. When asbestos was a problem, a specialized demolition robot was used. The east end, last to be completed in 1968 during the original construction, was the first to be demolished, with the exception of the JCPenney Auto Center. The demolition crew worked from east to west, and as one part of the structure was completely removed, construction on replacement structures began. The only original structure left in the redevelopment was the former Foley's building, which was renovated to house the new Englewood Public Library and City Hall.

The host system can quickly verify the validity of the proof, and it can compare the conclusions of the proof to its own security policy to determine whether the application is safe to execute. This can be particularly useful in ensuring memory safety (i.e. preventing issues like buffer overflows). Proof-carrying code was originally described in 1996 by George Necula and Peter Lee. Packet filter example The original publication on proof-carrying code in 1996Necula, G. C. and Lee, P. 1996. Safe kernel extensions without run-time checking. SIGOPS Operating Systems Review 30, SI (Oct. 1996), 229‚Äì243. used packet filters as an example: a user-mode application hands a function written in machine code to the kernel that determines whether or not an application is interested in processing a particular network packet. Because the packet filter runs in kernel mode, it could compromise the integrity of the system if it contains malicious code that writes to kernel data structures. Traditional approaches to this problem include interpreting a domain specific language for packet filtering, inserting checks on each memory access (software fault isolation), and writing the filter in a high-level language which is compiled by the kernel before it is run. These approaches have performance disadvantages for code as frequently run as a packet filter, except for the in-kernel compilation approach, which only compiles the code when it is loaded, not every time it is executed. With proof-carrying code, the kernel publishes a security policy specifying properties that any packet filter must obey: for example, will not access memory outside of the packet and its scratch memory area. A theorem prover is used to show that the machine code satisfies this policy. The steps of this proof are recorded and attached to the machine code which is given to the kernel program loader. The program loader can then rapidly validate the proof, allowing it to thereafter run the machine code without any additional checks. If a malicious party modifies either the machine code or the proof, the resulting proof-carrying code is either invalid or harmless (still satisfies the security policy).

He served as Minister of Finance and deputy head of government from February to April 1919. From October 1919 to March 1920, he was again deputy head of government and Minister of Justice. In 1921, he once more became Minister of Justice. Schiffer was co-founder of two liberal parties, the German Democratic Party (DDP) in 1918 and 1919 during the Weimar republic as well as the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD) of East Germany in 1946. Early life Eugen Schiffer was born in Breslau in the Prussian Province of Silesia on 14 February 1860 as the son of Bernhard Schiffer (1830‚Äì1900, a merchant) and his wife Mathilde (1832‚Äì88, n√©e Kassel). Schiffer graduated from the Elisabeth-Gymnasium in Breslau with the Abitur and went on to study law at Breslau, Leipzig and T√ºbingen. He entered the Prussian judicial service in 1880 and after positions in Zabrze (Upper Silesia) and Magdeburg became Kammergerichtsrat in Berlin in 1906. In 1910, Schiffer was promoted to Oberverwaltungsgerichtsrat. In 1888, Schiffer married Bertha (1858-1919, n√©e Buttermilch). They had two daughters (Mathilde, born in 1889, married Waldemar Koch in 1933) and a son. In 1896, the Jewish Schiffer converted to Protestantism. Political career =German Empire= During the First World War, Schiffer was an adviser to General Wilhelm Groener and was in charge of the law department at the War Ministry. In October 1917, he became Unterstaatssekret√§r (Undersecretary) at the Reichsschatzamt (Treasury). At the same time, Schiffer was a delegate to the lower chamber of the Prussian diet for the National Liberal Party (1903-1918) and a member of the Reichstag from 1912 to 1917. His oratory skills, support from big industry and his ambitious nature made him a well known deputy. He was in favor of strengthening the power of the parliament but as a monarchist opposed the revolution. =Weimar Republic= Nevertheless, after the German Revolution he became Staatssekret√§r at the Treasury in November 1918. From 1918 to 1919, Schiffer was a founder-member of the German Democratic Party (DDP) and was a member and leader of the DDP parliamentary group in both the Weimar National Assembly (1919‚Äì20) and the Reichstag (1920‚Äì1924). He also remained a delegate to the Landtag of Prussia until 1924. From February 1919 until his resignation in April 1919, Schiffer was deputy to Ministerpr√§sident Philipp Scheidemann and Minister of Finance in the first democratically elected German government. During his time in office, Schiffer developed a temporary tax regime that provided the basis for what later became known as Erzbergersche Finanzreformen (named after Matthias Erzberger). Schiffer asked Scheidemann for his dismissal from the cabinet on 28 March 1919, giving \\"personal reasons\\". He also named disagreement about the creation and filling of several public sector positions as an issue. After the Scheidemann cabinet resigned in June 1919 over the Treaty of Versailles, the DDP initially refused to become part of the Bauer cabinet, but in early October, the Democrats rejoined SPD and Zentrum in government. As a result Schiffer became Minister of Justice and, once again, deputy to the head of government, now with the title of Vice-Chancellor. He opposed plans to socialize industries and worked towards a fundamental reform of the civil service. However, in March 1920, during the Kapp-L√ºttwitz-Putsch Schiffer did not flee the capital with the majority of the cabinet. His role over the days of the putsch was controversial. Since he negotiated with the putschists without a formal mandate from the government, made promises in the name of president Friedrich Ebert and offered those responsible for the putsch amnesty, Schiffer was forced to resign by the SPD after the end of the putsch. From May to October 1921, Schiffer once again was Minister of Justice in the first cabinet of Joseph Wirth. In 1921-22, Schiffer was head of the German delegation at the negotiations with the Allies on Upper Silesia in Geneva that led to the treaty of 15 May 1922 securing trading rights and minority rights in the region. In 1922-23, he was the German representative at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. In 1924, Schiffer supported the acceptance of the Dawes Plan. In 1925, he resigned from the DDP and retired from active politics after an attempt to merge the parties of the political centre in a single Liberale Vereinigung. Later life After retiring from politics, Schiffer focused on heading the Berliner Verwaltungsakademie, the first institution of higher learning for the German civil service, which he had help found in 1921. He also practiced law, served as an adviser to the bank \\"Bankhaus Mendelssohn & Co.\\" and was chairman of the board at Anhaltischen Kohlenwerke AG. In 1928, his book Die Deutsche Justiz launched a public debate over a judicial reform. After having been initially left mostly alone by the Nazis due to the influence of highly placed advocates (, Johannes Popitz and Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk), in 1943 he was forced, along with his daughter Marie, to move to a Jewish ghetto in Berlin. After the end of the Second World War, together with his son-in-law Waldemar Koch and Wilhelm K√ºlz, Schiffer founded the Liberaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (LDPD) in the Soviet-occupied sector of Berlin. For three years after August 1945, Schiffer headed the central administration of Justice (Justizverwaltung) under the Soviet military government. He then moved to West-Berlin. Eugen Schiffer died in Berlin-Charlottenburg on 5 September 1954.

Native Americans had not lived in the area in the century before a frontier post of Fort Nashborough was built here in 1779 by pioneers from North Carolina. In 1784 it was incorporated as a town by the North Carolina legislature; it became a city in 1806. In 1843 it became the state capital. In the Civil War Nashville was seized by Federal troops in 1862 and became a major Union military base. Confederate General J. B. Hood was decisively defeated in the Battle of Nashville in 1864. The city became the political, transportation, business and cultural center of the Middle Tennessee region. Besides the state government, it is best known for its educational, musical and religious establishments. In 1963 Nashville and Davidson County were consolidated under a single charter and are administered by a mayor and a council. Prehistory The Mississippian culture was a mound-building Native American culture that flourished in the United States before the arrival of Europeans. The first known settlers in the area of modern Nashville were Native Americans who arrived in the region by at least 13,000 BC during the Paleoindian period of regional prehistory. For millennia the descendants of these first Tennesseans continued to live along the river terraces and uplands overlooking the Cumberland River, leaving behind a dense archaeological record spanning the Paleoindian, Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian periods. The final prehistoric Native American culture to inhabit what would become Nashville was a regional manifestation of the Mississippian Culture known as Middle Cumberland Mississippian, identified by archaeologists based on the specific combination of burial practices, artistic style, and ceramic styles. Recent studies suggest that Middle Cumberland Mississippian culture may be the result of interactions between local populations and outsiders from the American Bottom who moved into the western portion of the Nashville Basin around AD 1000, settling at the site of Mound Bottom. The archaeological footprint of the Middle Cumberland Mississippian culture appears throughout Nashville as the many platform mounds, extensive stone box cemeteries, palisaded villages, and small prehistoric farmsteads that have been destroyed by antiquarian scholars, relic hunters, and urban development. All archaeological evidence for Mississippian culture appears to vanish from the Nashville area by around AD 1475‚Äì1500. Archaeologists believe this regional collapse may have been the result of extreme pressures brought on by rapid population growth and dwindling resource availability following prolonged droughts leading to increased occurrences of disease, nutritional deficiencies, and warfare. Early history There is no reliable historical or archaeological evidence for Native American presence in the Nashville area from 1500 through the late 1600s. The region between the Ohio and Tennessee Rivers was a hunting ground for many tribes, and while the Shawnee occupied the area in the later part of the 17th century, by 1700 they were being challenged by the Cherokee and Chickasaw. The first Europeans to enter what would become Tennessee were part of the expedition led by Hernando de Soto in the 16th century. Although the exact route of the Desoto expedition is unclear, they do not appear to have reached Middle Tennessee or the Nashville area. Instead, the earliest Europeans in what would become Nashville were French fur traders such as Martin Chartier, who established a trading post in 1689 on the Cumberland River, near the present-day site of the city.Robert Trail, \\"Livingston County, Kentucky: Stepping Stone to Illinois,\\" The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society, Vol. 69, No. 3 (July, 1971), pp. 239-272.Chartier Family Association family tree Martin Chartier Historical MarkerSherman Day, Historical Collections of the State of Pennsylvania: Containing a Copious Selection of the Most Interesting Facts, Traditions, Biographical Sketches, Anecdotes, Etc., Relating to Its History and Antiquities, Both General and Local, with Topographical Descriptions of Pennsylvania county and regional histories, G. W. Gorton, 1843; p. 391.Martin Chartier, Nashville's First White Person Jean du Charleville (aka Charles Charleville) established a trading post in 1710 at a natural sulfur and saline spring near what is now Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park. The natural salt lick attracted animals, which in turn attracted Native American hunters with whom the French could trade, and the area became known as \\"French Lick.\\" This same portion of Nashville would later be known as Sulphur Spring Bottom and Sulphur Dell. In 1769, French-Canadian hunter Timothy DeMonbreun began a series of trips up the Cumberland to Nashville and built a cabin near the lick to use as a base of operations for fur trapping during his visits to the area. DeMonbreun settled in Nashville permanently in 1788, and ran a tavern and mercantile business. Fort Nashborough Artist's depiction of Donelson's flatboats descending the Cumberland River in 1784John Buchanan Sr., born in either Scotland or Ireland, migrated with his family from their home in Cumberland Co., Pennsylvania, to the Watauga Valley, Washington District of North Carolina. Afterward, they took a long horseback trek to Kentucky, left their women and traveled down to the Cumberland Settlements in late 1778, building a station on the southern side of the Cumberland River above the French Lick, on the high ground where Nashville now stands, in the early spring of 1779. His son, Major John Buchanan, known for the siege of Buchanan's Station, is considered to be one of the founders of Nashville, Tennessee.Flowering of the Cumberland, Harriette Simpson Arnow, pp. 10-1 Another settlement arrived when James Robertson left the Watauga settlement in northwestern North Carolina, traveled overland for two months, and arrived on the banks of the Cumberland River near the center of present downtown Nashville on Christmas Day, 1779. They cleared the land and built a log stockade they called the Bluff station. Richard Henderson had planned to call the settlement Nashborough in honor of General Francis Nash, who won acclaim in the American Revolution. For a brief time, court records did use the Nashborough designation but there is no evidence that any of the settlers did. Robertson's friend and fellow Watauga settler John Donelson, along with some 60 families, including women and children, came in 30 flatboats and several pirogues down the Tennessee River and up the Cumberland, arriving April 23, 1780. They founded a new community that was then a part of the state of North Carolina. The town was officially created and named Nashville in 1784, by an act of the North Carolina legislature. As the northern terminus of the Natchez Trace, the town quickly developed as a cotton center and river port and later as a railroad hub. It soon became the commercial center of the entire Middle Tennessee region.Creighton, Wilbur (1969). Building of Nashville. By 1800, the city had 345 residents, including 136 enslaved Blacks and 14 free Blacks. Early statehood Map of Nashville, Tennessee in 1804, published in 1880After the failed experiment of the State of Franklin, North Carolina ceded its land from the Allegheny Mountains to the Mississippi River to the federal government. In 1796, that territory was admitted to the union as the state of Tennessee. Nashville at that time was still a small settlement in a vast wilderness, but its central location and status as the state capital made it the political, commercial, financial and religious center of the state. In 1806, Nashville was chartered as a city. The city's first debt and first large-scale public works project was the building of the Nashville Water Works, centered around the reservoir located on a bluff south of the city, now known as Rolling Mill Hill. The money was loaned by Philadelphia businessmen, and part of the amount was used to purchase around 12 enslaved Black men in Virginia to work on the project. The $50,000 loan was insufficient to cover the $55,000 cost of construction, but the rising value of the slaves purchased by the city covered the difference when all but one or two were sold at the end of the project. Water from the Cumberland River is pumped by steam engine into the reservoir, which remains in use today. =Andrew Jackson= In the War of 1812, General Andrew Jackson, a Nashville lawyer and politician, defeated the Creekhttp://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/54horseshoe/54horseshoe.htm Indians at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend and the British invasion army at the Battle of New Orleans, becoming a national hero, thanks in large part to the fighting skills of the Tennessee militia. Jackson became a western hero, and building on his militia connections,Charles Grier Sellers, Jr. \\"Jackson Men with Feet of Clay,\\" American Historical Review Vol. 62, No. 3 (Apr., 1957), pp. 537‚Äì551 Jackson built a strong political base and in 1828, Jackson was elected President.Robert V. Remini, Andrew Jackson (1999) Capital of Tennessee More than 30 years after receiving its charter, Nashville was selected as the permanent capital of Tennessee on October 7, 1843. Several towns across Tennessee were nominated; all received votes, but Nashville and Charlotte were the top contenders. Nashville won by only one vote. Previously, the cities of Kingston (for one day) and Knoxville in Eastern Tennessee, and Murfreesboro, like Nashville located in Middle Tennessee, had each served as the temporary capital. The Tennessee State Capitol building was constructed over a period of fourteen years from 1845 to 1859.tnmuseum.org It was designed by Philadelphia architect William Strickland, who modeled it after a Greek Ionic temple. Commercial, convict, and slave labor were used in the project. Fifteen enslaved Black men worked on carving the Capitol's limestone cellar from 1845 to 1847; Nashville stonemason A.G. Payne was paid $18 a month for their labor. It is believed to be \\"the most significant project where the [Tennessee] state government rented slave labor.\\" It houses the Tennessee legislature and the Governor's office. For years Nashville was considered one of the wealthiest southern capitals and a large portion of its prominence was from the iron business. Nashville led the south for iron production. Civil War Map of Nashville during the Civil War Tennessee was the last state to join the Confederacy on June 24, 1861, when Governor Isham G. Harris proclaimed \\"all connections by the State of Tennessee with the Federal Union dissolved, and that Tennessee is a free, independent government, free from all obligations to or connection with the Federal Government of the United States of America.\\"Biography of Isham Green Harris Nashville was an immediate target of Union forces. The city's significance as a shipping port on the Cumberland River and its symbolic importance as the capital of Tennessee made it a desirable prize. The General Assembly was in session at Nashville when Fort Donelson fell on February 16, 1862. Soon after at the end of the month, Nashville became the first state capital to fall to Union troops, under the command of Don Carlos Buell. Prior to that, Nashville was evacuated and Governor made a speech recommending the citizens burn their private property; retreating troops destroyed bridges crossing the Cumberland River. Governor Harris issued a call for the legislature to assemble at Memphis, and the executive office was moved to that city. In the meantime, President Lincoln appointed future President Andrew Johnson Military Governor of Tennessee. He set up offices in the capital at Nashville. Confederate uprisings and guerrilla attacks continued sporadically in the city. On December 2, 1864, the Confederate Army of Tennessee (not to be confused with the rival Union Army of the Tennessee) arrived south of the city and set up fortifications facing the Union Army. After a lengthy stand-off, the Union forces attacked on December 15, starting the Battle of Nashville. The outnumbered Confederate forces were badly defeated and retreated south to the Tennessee River. Refugees poured into Nashville during the war, because jobs were plentiful in the depots, warehouses and hospitals serving the war effort, and furthermore the city was much safer place than the countryside. Unionists and Confederate sympathizers both flooded in, as did free blacks and escaped slaves, and businessmen from the North.Durham, Walter T. (1985). Nashville: The Occupied City, 1862‚Äì1863 Durham, Walter T. (1987). Reluctant Partners: Nashville and the Union, 1863‚Äì1865 Nashville, with its very large transient population, had flourishing red light districts. Union wartime regulations forced prostitutes to purchase licenses and pass medical exams, primarily to protect soldiers from venereal disease. Their trade was deregulated once military control ended.Jeannine Cole, \\"'Upon the Stage of Disorder:' Legalized Prostitution in Memphis and Nashville, 1863‚Äì1865\\", Tennessee Historical Quarterly, Spring 2009, Vol. 68 Issue 1, pp 40‚Äì65 A secret Confederate underground operated in the city, smuggling arms, medicines and information to the Confederacy, helping prisoners escape, and giving information to Confederate spies.Stanley F. Horn, \\"Dr. John Rolfe Hudson and the Confederate Underground in Nashville\\", Tennessee Historical Quarterly, Winter 2010, Vol. 69 Issue 4, pp 330‚Äì349 After the Civil War The Nashville Wharf, photographed shortly after the American Civil War After the Civil War, Nashville quickly grew into an important trade center. Its population rose from 16,988 in 1860 to 80,865 by 1900.U.S. Census Bureau data for 50 largest cities, 1850 to 1990 African- Americans increased from being 23 to 38 percent of the population between 1860 and 1870. Meanwhile, the Nashville chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was established by Confederate veteran John W. Morton, who initiated General Nathan Bedford Forrest. When the Union army left, the Fisk Free Colored School took over the Fort Gillem grounds, near where the free blacks lived before the civil war and north of downtown, and was renamed as Fisk University in 1872, it became a leading institution of African-American higher education. A black business district grew up along the fort's wagon road, renamed Jefferson Street. Just across the Cumberland River downtown, several other large African-American districts developed around former camps in East and North Nashville. In the late 1880s, its African-American and poor white populations were affected by changes to laws by the state legislature, which made voter registration and voting more difficult by requirements including imposition of a poll tax in 1889. The effect was to disenfranchise most blacks and many poor whites, after Tennessee had been one of the most competitive states politically after the Civil War. About one-third of the state's citizens were thus shut out of the political process, a status that lasted for decades, until after passage of legislation during the mid-1960s as a result of the civil rights movement. In 1897, Nashville hosted the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition, a World's Fair celebrating the 100th anniversary of Tennessee's entry into the Union. A replica of the Parthenon was built for the event. The Parthenon replica is now the centerpiece of Centennial Park. An interesting sidenote occurred during the administration of Theodore Roosevelt. President Roosevelt visited Nashville and took his lodging at the Maxwell House Hotel. Joel Cheek, proprietor thereof, had served a special blend of coffee at the hotel's restaurant, and after drinking a cup of this coffee, Roosevelt proclaimed it \\"good to the last drop!\\" Cheek subsequently sold the blend to General Foods and to this day, Maxwell House coffee is enjoyed by millions. In 1913 Nashville was the last of several major cities in Tennessee to adopt a commission form of government, with all members of a small commission elected at-large. Compared to single-member districts, this change resulted in further limiting the political power of any African Americans who were able to vote, as their candidates were unable to gain support by the majority of the city, which was white. Other cities that adopted this form of government in this period were Clarksville in 1907, Chattanooga and Knoxville in 1911, and Jackson in 1915. As a result of legal challenges beginning in the late 1970s, all these cities have adopted new systems, most by 1990. These established council or commissions with more numerous members, most of whom are elected from single-member districts, when enables minorities to elect one or more candidates of their choice. On March 22, 1916, a fire in East Nashville erupted, destroying more than 500 homes. The fire was exacerbated by unusually high wind gusts, allowing it to spread quickly before firefighters could suppress it. This became known as the Great Fire of 1916. Though there were few injuries and only one fatality, the fire significantly damaged the economy of East Nashville for decades. The Great train wreck of 1918 occurred on July 9, 1918, in Nashville when an inbound local train collided with an outbound express, killing 101 people. This was one of the most deadly rail accidents in U.S. history. Tennessee was the state that put the 19th Amendment, allowing women to vote, over the top, and the ratification struggle convulsed the city in August 1920. On March 1, 1941, W47NV began operations in Nashville, as the first fully licensed commercial FM radio station in the United States. Recent history (post-World War II) In 1949, the city administration claimed 96 acres in Hell's Half Acre, a black neighborhood northwest of the state capital that housed the poorest African-Americans in the city. The city administration justified it by saying they would rid the city of vice, as the place was then known for saloons, prostitution, and other vices but also housed some of the city's oldest African-American churches and schools. The neighborhood was replaced with the State Library and Archives, a large office building, a six-lane parkway, terraced parking lots and green space, with few provisions for the people who lost their homes. Map of the Nashville area in 1960, prior to consolidation Music entrepreneurs such as Roy Acuff (1903‚Äì1992) made Nashville the country music capital after World War II. Acuff joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1938, and although his popularity as a musician waned in the late 1940s, he remained one of the Opry's key figures and promoters for nearly four decades. In 1942, he co-founded the first major Nashville-based country music publishing company‚ÄîAcuff-Rose Music.John Rumble. \\"Roy Acuff\\".

From Sunday, January 28 to Tuesday, January 30, an ice storm produced an inch of sleet and freezing rain, gridlocking the city and cutting off the power supply to many neighborhoods. On the afternoon of Wednesday, January 31, a blizzard swept through the city with wind gusts in excess of 50 mph and visibility down to zero. Eight inches of snow were recorded, and commute around the city was virtually impossible. On the night of February 2, low temperatures reached -13 degrees Fahrenheit, causing pipelines to burst. Many Nashville residents lacked both electricity and water. Due to the severity of the ice storm and the blizzard that followed afterward, this is known as the worst episode of winter weather in Nashville's history. The blizzard of 1951 holds third place for the most snow recorded in Nashville from a single storm system, behind the blizzard of 1892 and Winter Storm Jonas in 2016. Nashville was a center of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1957, public schools began to be desegregated using the \\"stair-step\\" plan as proposed by Dan May; people protested integration and, at Hattie Cotton Elementary School, a bomb was detonated. No one was killed, and after that the desegregation plan went on without violence.John Egerton, \\"Walking into History: The Beginning of School Desegregation in Nashville \\", Southern Spaces, 4 May 2009 The school board gerrymandered the school districts so that only nine black first-graders enrolled out of about 100 that were eligible. Seven years later, fewer than 800 black students were in formerly all-white schools while black teachers and principals faced demotions or layoffs as the city consolidated the system. On February 13, 1960, hundreds of college students involved in the Nashville Student Movement launched a sit-in campaign to desegregate lunch counters throughout the city. Inspired by students in Greensboro, North Carolina, students from Fisk, the American Baptist Theological Seminary, and Tennessee A&I; had similar sit-in protests and boycotts in Nashville. Although initially met with violence and arrests, the protesters were eventually successful in pressuring local businesses to end the practice of racial segregation. Many of the activists involved in the Nashville sit-ins‚Äîincluding James Bevel, Diane Nash, Bernard Lafayette, John Lewis and others‚Äîwent on to organize the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which emerged as one of the most influential organizations of the civil rights movement. The first movement credited to SNCC was the 1961 Nashville Open Theater Movement, directed and strategized by James Bevel, which desegregated the city's theaters. Inspired by their example, Nashville has had a consolidated city-county government (also known as a \\"metropolitan government\\") since 1963. Although a similar proposal had failed in 1958, Davidson County voters approved consolidation in a referendum on June 28, 1962. On April 16, 1998, an F3 tornado struck the downtown area at around 3:30 p.m., causing serious damage and blowing out hundreds of windows from skyscrapers, raining shattered glass on the streets and closing the business district for nearly four days. Over 300 homes were damaged, and three cranes at the then incomplete Adelphia Coliseum were toppled. Though only one person was killed, it was one of the most costly urban tornadoes on record in the U.S. The expansion of the National Hockey League brought the Nashville Predators to Nashville in 1998. They currently play at Bridgestone Arena, located in downtown Nashville. The franchise has performed exceptionally well in Nashville, valued at $270 million in 2016. Shortly after the NHL expansion in 1998, the Tennessee Oilers moved from Memphis to Nashville in 1999, beginning its inaugural season as the Tennessee Titans. In two years, Nashville witnessed the expansion of two professional sports organizations. These franchises tremendously invigorated the revitalization of the downtown area. In 2000, Nashville native Bill Frist rose to national political prominence when he became majority leader of the U.S. Senate. Frist was formerly a transplant surgeon at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. In 2006, commuter rail service from Nashville to Lebanon opened to the public. Further plans to expand Music City Star were halted during the Great Recession of 2008‚Äì09; however, plans to expand commuter rail service are once again an objective for the city. On April 30 through May 7 in 2010, significant flooding impacted Nashville and its suburbs. Many areas in the Nashville MSA received more than 18 inches of rainfall in less than 48 hours. This caused significant damage to the downtown area, and three dozen lives were lost in the city. Due to the rarity of the amount of rainfall, meteorologists dubbed it a \\"thousand year event.\\" On January 22, 2016, Winter Storm Jonas brought blizzard conditions to Nashville, producing more than eight inches of snow. The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning that morning. On January 22, Nashville set a record for snowfall received in a 24-hour period. The blizzard proceeded to the East Coast by January 23. In 2016, Nashville experienced a growth of 82 residents per day. In 2017, Nashville surpassed Memphis as Tennessee's most populous city. Despite the Great Recession, Nashville has posted strong economic growth during the 21st Century and boasts one of the lowest unemployment rates in Tennessee. From April 25‚Äì27, 2019, Nashville hosted the 2019 NFL Draft. It broke draft attendance records with 600,000 people attending and is currently the most watched draft in NFL history with 47.5 million TV views. In the early hours of March 3, 2020, Nashville was once again struck by a deadly tornado. This high- end EF-3 tornado killed two people in East Nashville and continued on into Wilson County where it killed an additional three people. Recent economic development On January 8, 2013, The New York Times magazine declared Nashville \\"It\\" city in a publication titled \\"Nashville's Latest Hit Could Be the City Itself\\".https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/us/nashville-takes-its- turn-in-the-spotlight.html This article is widely thought to have spurred new growth and construction in Nashville, ultimately leading to Nashville being declared the 5th fastest growing city in America by the end of 2013. On May 28, 2013, the newly anticipated Music City Center opened its doors in the SoBro District of Downtown Nashville. This new convention center marked a major milestone by replacing the rapidly aging Nashville Convention Center, and also adding an 800-room Omni Hotel along with an expansion of the Country Music Hall of Fame's facilities. This construction project sparked a number of new construction projects in both the SoBro district and other parts of the city, and has continued to spur development up into 2015. In November 2014, Bridgestone announced that they would be keeping their North American Headquarters in Nashville, and would invest $200 million to build a new 35 story skyscraper that would bring 1,700 jobs to downtown Nashville.http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/Bridgestone-Headquarters- to-Tower-Over-Nashville/25780/ On January 26, 2015, Google announced that it was bringing its Fiber service to the Nashville Area, bringing with it super fast internet using fiber optic cables in the ground. This announcement was seen as a major plus for the up-and-coming tech scene in Nashville, along with other companies that either have a presence here or looking to relocate to the Nashville Area. On April 17, 2015 First Tennessee Park opened in the Germantown district of Nashville, which provided a new home for the AAA Baseball team the Nashville Sounds. As a whole, at least 123 projects are planned for or under construction in Davidson County, many of which have begun recently.

The flight is expected to contribute $100 million to Nashville's economy and promote business connections and leisure travel to the city.https://www.reuters.com/article/us- iag-britishairways-nashville-idUSKBN1AO1QD In May 2018, The New York financial firm AllianceBernstein announced it would relocate its corporate headquarters to downtown Nashville in the Fifth and Broadway development, bringing at least 1000 new corporate jobs. Shortly after in June 2018 Nashville was named the host of the 2019 NFL Draft. On November 12, 2018, Nashville was announced as the East coast operations hub for Amazon's logistics and retail department, bringing at least 5000 new corporate jobs downtown to the Nashville Yards development and becoming the largest jobs announcement in the history of the state of Tennessee. In addition, within the same day the 'Big Four' accounting firm Ernst & Young announced it would be opening a 'tech' IT hub on Nashville's Music Row, bringing a further 600 jobs to the Nashville region.

It was built in 1882 and named for its high iron content. Originally water naturally flowed from the pressurized aquifer below. The original hand pump is now replaced with an electric pump. It was designated a Milwaukee landmark in 1980 for its significance as the last remaining public well in the city.  Background  Drilling began in October 1882 as a public works project by the Village of Bay View, but progressed slowly due to the dense glacial drift below. The final depth of 1500 feet was achieved later in January, at which point water pressure was enough to provide a constant supply of water to a planned network of satellite wells and fire hydrants.Historic Designation Study Report. Pryor Avenue Iron Well, Milwaukee Historic Preservation Commission, 1987. Once completed, the original wellhead consisted of nothing more than an exposed pipe with water spigots for public use. Some time in the 1920s the current concrete monolith was added. It stands roughly five feet tall and has a pipe on either side, from which water continuously flows out of and into ground level drainage basins. Potted plants and benches provided by the Bay View Garden and Yard Society now flank the structure.Sense of community: Bay View's flows like Pryor St. well, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, August 13, 2004. Many area residents still visit the Iron Well to fill up on drinking water. It became a popular alternative to the municipal water supply, which draws from Lake Michigan, during the Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak that occurred in April 1993.The Waterworks Flu, Time Magazine, April 19, 1993. Despite both water sources being physically close to each other, they remain independent and separated by geological strata. Water quality tests are performed regularly by the health department and DNR to ensure safety. Tests in 2014 and 2015 found exceedingly high levels of strontium, a naturally occurring element, in the well's water, though city health officials noted it should only be an issue of consideration for \\"sensitive populations over a lifetime of exposure.\\"Strontium Levels in Pryor Avenue Well Water, Milwaukee Water Works, April 2015.

Its capital city is Tobruk. In the north, Butnan has a shoreline on the Mediterranean Sea. To the east, it borders Egypt's Matruh Governorate, along with a small border on the Al Wadi al Jadid Governorate in the far southeast. Domestically, it borders Derna in the northwest and Al Wahat in west and south. The most important settlements are Tobruk, Jaghbub and Bardia. Per the census of 2012, the total population in the region was 157,747 with 150,353 Libyans. The average size of the household in the district was 6.9, while the average household size of non-Libyans being 3.7. There were totally 22,713 in the district and the population density of the district was 1.86 persons per sq. km. Per 2006 census, there were totally 50,154 economically active people in the district. History Traditionally part of Marmarica, and later part of the province of Cyrenaica in Italian Libya, with the division of Libya into ten governorates in 1963, Al Butnan became part of the Darnah Governorate. In 1983 the Darnah Governorate was divided into a number of baladiyat (districts), with what is now Butnan being included in the Tobruk baladiyah and others. Butnan District was created in 1988 as one of the twenty-five reorganized baladiyat. In 1995, Butnan was one of the thirteen new shabiyah, and Butnan retained its status through the reorganizations of 1998, 2001 and 2007. Geography Libya has mostly a flat undulating plain and occasional plateau, with an average elevation of around . Around 91 per cent of the land is covered by desert, with only 8.8 per cent agricultural land (with only 1% arable lands) and 0.1 per cent of forests. The major resources are petroleum, gypsum and natural gas. Along the coastal regions, the climate is Mediterranean in coastal areas, while it is desert climate in all other parts. Dust storms lasting four to eight days is pretty common during Spring. Triplotania is the northwest region, while it is Cyrenacia in the east and Fezzen in southwest. Cyrenacia is the largest region in Libya, which is mostly semi arid in nature. The region receives an annual rainfall of . There are no perennial rivers in the region, but the region is abundant with groundwater aquifers. Demographics Per the census of 2012, the total population in the region was 157,747 with 150,353 Libyans. The average size of the household in the country was 6.9, while the average household size of non-Libyans being 3.7. There were totally 22,713 in the district, with 20,907 Libyan ones. The population density of the district was 1.86 persons per sq. km. Per 2006 census, there were totally 50,154 economically active people in the district. There were 27,263 government employees, 5,788 employers, 20,033 first level workers and 179 second level workers. There were 13,156 workers in state administration, 1,798 in agriculture, animal husbandry and forestry, 2,019 in agriculture & hunting, 10,900 in education, 3,879 in private enterprises, 2,889 in health & social work, 2,232 in production, 12,311 in technical work and 393 service workers. The total enrollment in schools was 53,441 and the number of people above secondary stage and less than graduation was 3,311. As per the report from World Health Organization (WHO), there were 1 communicable disease centres, 2 dental clinics, 1 general clinics, 1 in-patient clinics, 7 out-patient clinics, 38 pharmacies, 65 PHC centres, 1 polyclinics, 2 rural clinics and 0 specialized clinics. Islam is the state and major religion of the country. Administration The same district between 2001 and 2007 In 2007 the formerly autonomous city of Jaghbub became part of Butnan District. Libya became independent in 1951 from the colonial empire and generally known for its oil rich resources. All the powers rested centrally with the President Gaddafi for 42 years till the 2011 armed rebellion which topple him. As per the constitution, Libya is the most decentralized Arab nation, but practically all powers are vested on central government on account of control over the oil revenues. Local governmental institutions manage the administration of education, industry, and communities. As a part of decentralization in 2012, the country is administratively split into 13 regions from the original 25 municipalities, which were further divided in 1,500 communes. Since 2015, the chief of the state is a Chairman of Presidential Council, while the Prime Minister is the head of the state. The House of Representatives is an elected body that is elected on universal suffrage and popular vote. As of 2016, there were 22 administrative divisions in the country in the form of districts.

Like them and the similar publications of Warren Publishing, these were mature-audience magazines not covered by comic books' Comics Code Authority. Its cover price was 60¬¢, typical for that format and time, during which standard comic books sold for 15¬¢. Publication history =Main feature= Lasting two 64-page issues, Hell-Rider (cover-dated Aug. & Oct. 1971)Hell-Rider at the Grand Comics Database starred the titular vigilante motorcyclist, a Vietnam War veteran, lawyer, and black belt martial artist named Brick Reese. With his customized, flamethrower-equipped motorcycle, and temporary super-strength courtesy of the experimental drug Q-47, the Los Angeles, California-based Hell-Rider battled the Claw, a masked, heroin-smuggling, secret society leader in issue #1, and a bestial rampager called the Ripper in issue #2. The stories featured scantily clad rock starlets, nightclub waitresses, and groovy, pot-smoking ' 70s chicks all quickly losing what little clothing they wore. The series was created by Gary Friedrich, who would go on to co-create the better-known, Marvel Comics supernatural motorcyclist Ghost Rider, and illustrated by the veteran team of penciler Ross Andru and inker Mike Esposito. Skywald partners Sol Brodsky and Israel Waldman are listed as publishers, with Brodsky additionally credited as editor. Gary Friedrich is listed as \\"script editor\\", while Golden Age great Bill Everett, creator of the Sub-Mariner in 1939, has an unexplained credit for \\"special effects\\", which Al Hewetson, an editor of other Skywald titles, said in 2004 \\"probably refers to art corrections, assists and/or character designs.\\" Panel from Hell-Rider #1, art by Ross Andru and Mike Esposito. The blood-spewing violence was graphic for the time. The title character's name is sometimes spelled \\"Hell Rider\\", without a hyphen, in the stories. A house ad for the never-published Hell-Rider #3, with cover art by Gray Morrow for a story titled \\"The Zodiac Killers\\", appeared as the back cover of Skywald's Psycho #5 (Nov. 1971). =Backup features= The magazine's backup features, whose stories were interrelated with those of the main feature, were \\"The Butterfly\\" and \\"The Wild Bunch\\", both written by Friedrich. The former starred African-American singer/superheroine Marian Michaels, whose costume is equipped with bright lights to blind adversaries, a jet pack for flying, and suction cups for climbing. The latter starred a rough but basically goodhearted biker gang that Reese had encountered, consisting of leader Animal; Afro-haired Deke; weaselly Slinker; tall, blond Curly; and blond biker-babe Ruby. Art credits for the first issue's backups are disputed, with sources suggesting either John Celardo and Rich Buckler as the \\"Butterfly\\" penciler, and either Dick Ayers or Syd Shores as the \\"Wild Bunch\\" penciler.

It may or may not be related to specific hunger, the drive to consume particular nutrients that is well-studied in animals. In studies of food cravings, chocolate and chocolate confectioneries almost always top the list of foods people say they crave; this craving is referred to as chocoholism. The craving of non-food items as food is called pica.  Causes  There is no single explanation for food cravings, and explanations range from low serotonin levels affecting the brain centers for appetite to production of endorphins as a result of consuming fats and carbohydrates. Foods with high levels of sugar glucose, such as chocolate, are more frequently craved than foods with lower sugar glucose, such as broccoli, because when glucose interacts with the opioid receptor system in the brain an addictive triggering effect occurs. The consumer of the glucose feels the urge to consume more glucose, much like an alcoholic, because the brain has become conditioned to release \\"happy hormones\\" every time glucose is present. The cravings for certain types of food are linked to their ingredients. Chocolate for example, contains the neurotransmitter phenylethylamine, which is important for the regulation of the body‚Äôs release of endorphins.  Pregnancy  Women will often experience cravings for seemingly random foods during pregnancy. The reason that these cravings occur is not definitively known. It's been theorized that these cravings might be in order to replace nutrients lost during morning sickness. However, there is substantial evidence that pregnancy cravings serve a social function, rather than a nutritional one. Because popular pregnancy cravings differ in their nutritional make-up from culture to culture, it can be inferred that there is no set of nutritional needs that these cravings are filling. Instead, it may be that strange cravings help pregnant women signal that they are pregnant and recruit help from the people around them. Some decent evidence for this is the fact that women often crave rare, hard to obtain foods and reject common- place, everyday ones. Providing pregnant relations with food may have been common among the human ancestor Homo erectus, which provides a possible explanation for the evolution of this behavior. Different cultures have different popular pregnancy cravings. One of the treatments for morning sickness consists of accommodating food cravings and aversions. Depending from the historical period and the culture there are different traditions regarding pregnancy cravings. Some examples are: *During pregnancy Hmong women would follow their food cravings to guarantee that their child would not be born with a deformity.Fadiman, Anne. The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux 1997:5 *In Malta, a pregnant woman is encouraged to satisfy her cravings for specific foods, out of fear that her unborn child will bear a representational birthmark (Maltese: xewqa, literally \\"desire\\" or \\"craving\\"). *In the Babylonian Talmud, folio 82a of Tractate Yoma mentions pregnancy cravings for non-kosher food (the passage discusses a pregnant woman who craves pork on Yom Kippur) as the paradigmatic example of a presumed life-threatening situation where a person is allowed to eat non- kosher food (and is permitted to eat it on Yom Kippur). *In the Philippines, the condition is traditionally known as lihi, and it is believed that traits of a food that a pregnant woman craves and consumes is imparted to the child. This also extends to objects or people that a woman would find pleasurable to see during her pregnancy. *In Thailand a woman who starts craving sour foods after her period has stopped is deemed to be pregnant. \\"Chocolate craving\\" Chocolate is seen as a sweet that is desired more by women than by men. Studies conducted in the UK and US and Canada have concluded that women indeed crave chocolate more than men. Also this chocolate craving seems to occur more perimenstrually. However a biological explanation has not been scientifically proven. It seems to have a cultural cause instead of a biological cause. Spanish women experience perimenstrual chocolate craving far less than American women (24% versus 60%) although they should not differ much physiologically. Spanish females crave chocolate more after dinner. The times males crave chocolate also differs between both cultures but was the same as the craving for chocolate of females in their culture (except perimenstrual). For treating small chocolate cravings, the smell of jasmine has been known to work.

However, he was only titular and suffered defeat and was killed at the orders of his victorious brother Shah Jahan. Early years Shahryar was born a few months before his grandfather, Emperor Akbar's death in 1605. His mother was a concubine. In the 16th year of Jahangir's reign, Shahryar married Mihr-un-nissa Begum, the daughter of his step-mother Nur Jahan by her first marriage to Sher Afghan.

Ascension After the death of his father Jahangir on 28 October 1627, Shahryar, as Nur Jahan desired, ascended to the Mughal throne, but for only three months. Since he was in Lahore at the time, he immediately took over the imperial treasury and distributed over 70 lakh rupees among old and new noblemen to secure his throne... Meanwhile, on the death of the Emperor, Mirza Baisinghar, son of the late Prince Daniyal, fled to Lahore and joined Shahryar. Soon, near Lahore, Shahryar's forces met those of Asaf Khan, (father of Mumtaz Mahal), who wanted his son-in-law Shah Jahan to ascend the throne, and had already proclaimed Dawar as Emperor near Agra, as a stop-gap arrangement to save the throne for Shah Jahan. Shahryar lost the battle and fled into the fort, where the next morning he was presented in front of Dawar Baksh, who placed him in confinement and two to three days later had him blinded by Asaf Khan, thus bringing his short reign to a tragic end. It is said that Shahryar also had a form of leprosy due to which he had lost all his hair including his eyebrows and eyelashes.Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, By Asiatic Society of Bengal, Asiatic Society (Calcutta, India).

It is a form of meningoencephalitis. GME is likely second only to encephalitis caused by canine distemper virus as the most common cause of inflammatory disease of the canine CNS. The disease is more common in female dogs of young and middle age. It has a rapid onset. The lesions of GME exist mainly in the white matter of the cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The cause is only known to be noninfectious and is considered at this time to be idiopathic. Because lesions resemble those seen in allergic meningoencephalitis, GME is thought to have an immune-mediated cause, but it is also thought that the disease may be based on an abnormal response to an infectious agent. One study searched for viral DNA from canine herpesvirus, canine adenovirus, and canine parvovirus in brain tissue from dogs with GME, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, and necrotizing leukoencephalitis (see below for the latter two conditions), but failed to find any. Types of GME *Disseminated ‚Äì This is a diffuse disease throughout the CNS. It was previously known as inflammatory reticulosis. There is an accumulation of mononuclear cells and neutrophils around the blood vessels (perivascular) of the CNS. Meningitis is seen with this form of GME and causes fever and neck pain. It has an acute progression over a few weeks. Symptoms include incoordination, nystagmus, head tilt, seizures, and depression. *Focal ‚Äì The disease presents as a granuloma, which mimics a tumor. It usually is found in the cerebrum or cerebellopontine angle. Symptoms may be acute or develop slowly over several months and depend on the location of the lesion. *Ocular ‚Äì This is an uncommon form of GME and is characterized by sudden blindness caused by optic neuritis. The disease is bilateral. Ocular GME is considered to be an extension of CNS disease. The blood vessels of the posterior segment of the eye and anterior uvea have the same infiltrates of inflammatory cells as the intracranial vessels. Uveitis, retinal detachment, and secondary glaucoma may be seen. Diagnosis and treatment Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows a large number of white blood cells. Typically small mature lymphocytes are the majority of cells seen, with monocytes and neutrophils making up the rest. Definitive diagnosis is based on histopathology, either a brain biopsy or post-mortem evaluation (necropsy). A CT scan or MRI will show patchy, diffuse, or multifocal lesions. For a number of years, the basic treatment was some type of corticosteroid in combination with one or more immunosuppressive drugs, typically cytosine arabinoside and/or cyclosporine or other medications such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or procarbazine, of which were usually added one at a time to the corticosteroid until a successful combination was found. There is evidence that treatment with radiation therapy for focal GME provides the longest periods of remission.  Pug dog encephalitis  Pug dog encephalitis (PDE) is an idiopathic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the prosencephalon (forebrain and thalamus). It is also known as necrotizing meningoencephalitis. The disease may be inherited in Pugs and Maltese and has been diagnosed in other breeds as well (Yorkies, Chihuahuas). The prevalence of PDE in pugs is about 1%. It differs in pathology from GME by more tissue breakdown and increased eosinophils (white blood cells). CSF analysis is also unique among inflammatory CNS diseases in dogs in that the cells are predominantly lymphocytes, instead of a mixed population of mononuclear cells. In Maltese and Pugs, there is extensive necrosis and inflammation of the gray matter of the cerebrum and subcortical white matter. The most common early symptoms are related to forebrain disease and include seizures and dementia, and later circling, head tilt, and blindness with normal pupillary light reflexes may be seen. PDE has a poor prognosis. Necrotizing leukoencephalitis In Yorkshire Terriers there can be severe mononuclear inflammation of the brainstem and periventricular cerebral white matter. Because the condition in this breed frequently affects only the white matter, it has been called necrotizing leukoencephalitis. Symptoms of brainstem and central vestibular disease predominate. Other types of noninfectious meningoencephalitis *Steroid-responsive meningoencephalitis is any noninfectious meningoencephalitis that responds well to corticosteroids and usually has an excellent prognosis. This could represent mild forms of GME or PDE, but there are two separate conditions recognized also. **Steroid- responsive meningitis/arteritis, also known as necrotizing vasculitis, is seen most commonly in Beagles, Boxers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, and German Shorthaired Pointers younger than two years of age. Many cases have fever, loss of appetite, and severe neck pain without other neurologic symptoms, although long-term cases may have incoordination and limb weakness or paralysis. CSF analysis shows predominantly neutrophils. In Beagles this condition is also known as Beagle pain syndrome. **Eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis is seen mainly in Golden Retrievers. CSF analysis shows predominantly eosinophils. *An acute progressive pyogranulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis is seen in mature Pointer dogs. There is monocytic and neutrophilic infiltration of the leptomeninges. Symptoms include incoordination, reluctance to move, and neck rigidity.

Facilities  Carnival Glory has two pools, six whirlpools, and a water slide.  Refits  Carnival Glory was first drydocked in November 2012 for refurbishment. In February and March 2017, she received a new \\"WaterWorks\\" feature, along with renovations of additional areas aboard the ship. Areas of operation In November 2009, Carnival Glory was redeployed to Miami. Later in June 2010, Carnival Glory began conducting summer cruises out of New York City, undertaking Canadian-bound cruises. Carnival Glory also has cruised out of Norfolk, Virginia. In 2014, Carnival Glory operated eastern and western Caribbean cruises departing out of Miami. In January 2018, Carnival Glory was the first of Carnival's ship which returned to St. Thomas since hurricanes in September 2017. Carnival Glorys home port is New Orleans. Incidents On March 16, 2007, a 35-year-old male passenger jumped through a window and fell into the water east of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He was rescued 8 hours later. On March 8, 2015, 21-year- old Virginia Tech student, Cameron Smook, fell overboard from a 6th deck balcony. Surveillance video showed Smook climb over the balcony's railing before falling into the water. A search was conducted south of Abaco Island, Bahamas. The United States Coast Guard along with other area vessels conducted a search, but Smook's body was not recovered. The cruise had departed Miami on Saturday, March 7, 2015. On August 19, 2015, around 16:00, or about 45 minutes after leaving Roat√°n in Honduras, a 65-year-old female passenger, from San Jose, California, fell or jumped overboard from the 9th or 11th deck. Two hours later her body was found from Roat√°n. On October 14, 2017, at 8:15, while passengers were disembarking in Miami, 8-year-old Zion Smith, from the Bahamas, fell from the 5th floor to the 3rd floor of the Old Glory Atrium.

B. Crocker Art Gallery, founded in 1885, is the oldest art museum west of the Mississippi River.Brandye Alexander, \\"Crocker Art Museum has enriched Sacramentans for more than a century,\\" Sacramento Bee, Nov. 20, 2002. Located in Sacramento, California, the Museum holds one of the state's premier collections of Californian art. The museum contains American works dating from the Gold Rush to the present, European paintings and master drawings, one of the largest international ceramics collections in the U.S., and collections of Asian, African, and Oceanic art.http://www.crockerartmuseum.org History Edwin B. Crocker (1818‚Äì1875), a wealthy California lawyer and judge, and his wife, Margaret Crocker (1822‚Äì1901), began to assemble a significant collection of paintings and drawings during an extended trip to Europe, from 1869 to 1871. Upon their return to Sacramento, they set about creating an art gallery in part of their grand home at the corner of Third and O streets. The gallery became of the hub of social activity in Sacramento, hosting benefits for local organizations and welcoming prominent visitors including the Hawaiian queen, Liliuokalani (1878), President Ulysses S. Grant (1879), and Oscar Wilde (1882). Marble commemorative plaque at the Crocker Art Museum E.B. Crocker died in 1875. In 1885, his widow, Margaret, created a public art museum when she presented the E. B. Crocker Art Gallery and collection to the City of Sacramento and the California Museum Association, \\"in trust for the public,\\" the contents of which were valued at the time at more than $500,000.Appletons' Annual Cyclopaedia And Register of Important Events of the Year 1901, p. 418 (obituary of Margaret Crocker). In 1978, the Crocker Art Gallery was renamed the Crocker Art Museum. In 2002, to accommodate a burgeoning collection and the needs of the growing population of Sacramento and California's Central Valley region, the museum commissioned the firm of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates to design a major addition. The greatly expanded Crocker Art Museum opened on October 10, 2010. Permanent collections Charles Christian Nahl, Sunday Morning in the Mines (1872) =Californian art and American art= The Californian art collection includes works dating from statehood to the present. The core collection of early Californian art was assembled by Judge E. B. and Margaret Crocker in the early 1870s. Prominent in their collection are works by the German-American artist Charles Christian Nahl, who brought the large scale and copious detail of European history painting to works depicting the California Gold Rush. The Crockers commissioned five major works from Nahl, including Sunday Morning in the Mines (1872). The Californian collection continued to expand, and now contains 150 years of painting, sculpture, and craft media covering genres that include Impressionism, Abstract Expressionism, and Pop Art, and features artists including early Sacramento painter Amanda Austin, Norton Bush, William Keith, Thomas Hill, Granville Redmond, Edwin Deakin, Guy Rose, Gottardo Piazzoni, Joan Brown, Elmer Bischoff, Roland Petersen, David Park, Jess, Richard Diebenkorn, Mel Ramos, and Wayne Thiebaud. The collection also includes American art from the late 19th century to the present. American impressionists and modernists are a particular strength, with artists including Childe Hassam, Robert Henri, Georgia O'Keeffe, Maynard Dixon, Marsden Hartley, Hans Hofmann, and Luis Cruz Azaceta. Gerrit van Honthorst's Allegory of Painting (1648). =European art= Original collection The collection of European art began with the Crocker family's trip to Europe, from 1869 to 1871. It was not a Grand Tour. The Crockers rented lodgings in Dresden for over a year, and traveled mostly in Germany. As a later director of the museum would write, \\"Mr. Crocker was a novice and completely susceptible to a kind of fraud in his anxiety to become the possessor of a large collection of masterpieces. He acquired in his wholesale search a collection of more than 700 paintings,\\" most of them \\"not by the few famous names given him by the dealers in Munich and Dresden.\\"Frank. W.

However, among Crocker's purchases were a number of genuinely rare works by a broader array of artists than he realized, and for a brief time the Crockers possessed the largest private art collection in the United States.Richard V. West, \\"The Crockers and Their Collection: A Brief History,\\" Crocker Art Museum Handbook of Paintings, 1979. Oedipus and Antigone by German painter Franz Dietrich was among the works collected by E.B.and Margaret Crocker.Along with paintings, the Crockers also acquired 1344 Old Master drawingsWilliam Breazeale, PhD, \\"European Art,\\" The Crocker Art Museum Collection: Unveiled, edited by Scott A.

Of more certain provenance were the numerous German and Central European paintings Crocker purchased, many by artists who were alive and working at the time. These 19th-century paintings would form the core of the European collection, along with a number of 17th-century Flemish and Dutch Golden Age still lifes and genre scenes, as well as French and Italian works of the 17th and 18th centuries. Artists represented in Crocker's original collection include Maarten van Heemskerck, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Klaes Molenaer, Pieter Quast, Antonio Joli, Francesco Solimena, Paolo de Matteis, Claude-Joseph Vernet, Jacques-Louis David, Andreas Achenbach, and Karl von Piloty. Salome (1626-1627) by Simon Vouet. Later acquisitions Recent gifts by philanthropist Alan Templeton have expanded the scope of the European collection to include works by Italian artists Guercino, il Morazzone, and Bernardo Strozzi, the Swedish portrait painter Alexander Roslin, and French artists Simon Vouet, Philippe de Champaigne, Charles Po√´rson, Pierre-Alexandre Wille, Louis-Jean-Fran√ßois Lagren√©e, and Robert Lef√®vre, as well as English portraitist Sir Thomas Lawrence, Austrian painter Josef Danhauser, and Dutch artist Abraham Hondius. Gifts and promised gifts by the Beekhuis family of 67 19th-century Dutch landscapes are presented in the Beekhuis Foundation Gallery, including works by Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek and his descendants, and various painters of the Hague School. The Crocker's holdings of European art after 1900 are small, but include one of Northern California's most significant collections of works by Renoir, in part due to gifts from the artist's grandson, Alain Renoir, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. These include three small bronzes, two terra cotta relief sculptures, a Cagnes landscape painting, and works on paper, and also a ceramic vase by Jean Renoir. Works after 1900 also include two portraits of Crocker family members by Giovanni Boldini. =Works on paper= The collection of approximately 1,500 Old Master drawings include examples from the major European schools. Collection strengths include European drawings from the 17th and 18th centuries. Major drawings by artists such as Albrecht D√ºrer, Fra Bartolommeo, Fran√ßois Boucher, and Jean-Honor√© Fragonard are represented. American photography and modern and contemporary California prints are also strengths of the works on paper collection.Gilt bronze Vasudhara from Nepal, 12th century. =Asian Art= The collection began with a gift of Korean ceramics by Judge E.B. and Margaret Crocker's daughter Jennie Crocker Fassett in the 1920s. The collection of Asian art is noted for its holdings of Chinese tomb furnishings and trade ceramics, and Japanese armor and tea ware. South and Southeast Asia are well represented through the William and Edith Cleary gift of more than 600 Indian and Persian miniature paintings and drawings, as well as Buddhist art from the region between Pakistan and Southeast Asia. =Ceramics= Since midcentury, the Museum has followed the development of notable Californian, American, and international ceramists such as Hamada Shoji and Lucie Rie. The history of ceramics is also explored through a collection of 18th-century Meissen porcelain tableware and in the works of ancient cultures dating to the Neolithic period. =African and Oceanic art= The collection of African and Oceanic art features a variety of objects created for daily life and traditional ceremonies. The art of the Asmat of New Guinea is strikingly evidenced in the towering memorials to ancestors, called bis poles. The Crocker-Kingsley Exhibitions A biennial exhibition has been held by the museum in cooperation with the Kingsley Art Club since 1927, and juried since 1940. Artists whose works have appeared include Robert Arneson, Elmer Bischoff, David Gilhooly, Ralph Goings, Roland Petersen, Mel Ramos, Fritz Scholder, and Wayne Thiebaud. Crocker Museum's Crocker-Kingsley exhibition web page Kingsley Art Club's Crocker- Kingsley exhibition web page Museum buildings File:Crocker vintage image.jpgthumb =Crocker family mansion and art gallery= The Crocker family mansion, now part of the museum In 1868, Judge Edwin B. Crocker purchased the property and existing buildings on the corner of Third and O Streets. He then commissioned Seth Babson (1830‚Äì1908), a local architect, to redesign and renovate the home into a grander, Italianate mansion. (Babson had previously designed the home now known as the Leland Stanford Mansion in Sacramento.) In addition, Crocker asked Babson to design an elaborate gallery building that would sit adjacent to the mansion and display the family's growing art collection. The historic Art Gallery building Babson saw the home and gallery as an integrated complex, unique in design and demanding the finest materials. The gallery building included a bowling alley, skating rink and billiards room on the ground floor; a natural history museum and a library on the first floor; and gallery space on the second floor. Completed in 1872, the Crocker family mansion and art gallery are considered the masterpieces of Babson's career. The family mansion went through several uses and reconstructions until a 1989 renovation restored the historic fa√ßade and created a modern gallery interior. =2010 expansion= On October 10, 2010 the Crocker Art Museum opened a new building designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects founded by architect Charles Gwathmey of group The New York Five. The custom facade system was designed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd., Hong Kong. The new building, named the Teel Family Pavilion, is attached to the museum's historic structures. The expansion more than tripled the Crocker's size, from , adding four times the space for traveling exhibitions and three times the space for the Museum to showcase its permanent collection. The original museum accommodated only 4 percent of the museum's collection; 15 percent was displayed at the opening of the new section.<> The expanded Museum includes a new education center with four studio art classrooms, an art education resource room for teachers and docents, an expanded library, and student and community exhibition galleries, as well as an auditorium and public gathering places.

It was originally identified and recorded in the 1960s in pure breed pugs, with which this disease is nowadays mostly associated with, occurring essentially in small breed dogs ranging from six months to seven years of age. It causes intense necrotizing inflammatory lesions in the brain stem and Cerebellum. The etiopathology is still unclear. The pathogen that triggers the disease and contributes to its development has not yet been identified. It is presumed to have a multifactorial, heritable, autoimmune etiology. The process is rapidly progressive, culminating in status epilepticus and ending fatally for the dog. Although the pattern of inflammation is similar to other neuropathological conditions, resembling CNS inflammatory diseases which produces lesions alike to those that occur in NME, a definitive diagnosis can be made solely based on by histopathological examination through a necropsy. Signs and symptoms First signs of this immune dysregulation can show through lethargy and the reluctance to walk. Behavioral changes and an abnormal mentation might occur. After a short amount of time vestibulo-cerebellar symptoms will rapidly progress, leaving the animal in a state of depressed consciousness having seizures, amaurosis and ataxia. Despite seizures being a promoting factor of necrosis in primary inflammation diseases, it's not proven that the necrosis is extending to the white matter due to these convulsions. Diagnostics An antemortem diagnosis is often intricate considering the similarities of general neuro diagnostic profiles. To achieve a presumptive diagnosis on the live animal a multimodal approach is needed. Including the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computer tomography (CT), cerebrospinal liquid (CFS) analysis and immunological test. Since only the CNS is affected by the pathology, there won‚Äôt be any characteristic changes in organ systems other than the nervous system. Despite clinical examination methods, the specific diagnosis of NME depends on a postmortem, histopathological examination of the brain biopsy tissue or a necropsy. Histopathological features When examining the transversal sections, the non-suppurative (lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic) inflammation of both the meninges and encephalitis have characteristic histopathologic changes of necrotizing nature in the corona radiata (white matter), the thalamus and the cerebrocortical area. The meninges itself is focally thickened by dense aggregations of lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages infiltrating due to the reinforced immune answer (perivascular cuffing). Several multifocal encephalic lesions in corona radiata are erasing the border in the cerebral hemispheres between white and grey matter, exposing an asymmetrical ventricular enlargement. These lesions are selective with a predilection for the cerebral hemisphere. They can be divided into three phases: * Acute - mild inflammatory cell infiltration * Subacute ‚Äì intense inflammatory reactions * Chronic ‚Äì increase of perivascular cuffing, extensive necrosis Additionally you can observe temporal lobes with dense mononuclear cells infiltrating the meninges, and cerebellar herniation through the foramen magnum, which leads to neurological symptoms like continuous circling or stroke like seizures. Attempts at proving a viral etiology have been unsuccessful. Treatment In several studies the animals were given immunosuppressive drugs, such as cytarabin, prednisolone and dexamethasone on the behalf that the cause of NME is autoimmune related. Corticosteroids inhibit T-and B-Cells and slow down the production of cytokines, which restrain the immune system from attacking its own cells but also enfeeble its natural protection ‚Äì the immune answer. However, since the etiopathogenesis is still not totally understood, the inflammatory reactions are only partly reacting to the corticosteroids, such as the malacic or granulomatous changes. Prognosis Even after several years of research, the complete pathogenesis of this disease is still not understood. Immunosuppressive and anticonvulsant drugs have extended the lives of several dogs for up to 7 months after the outbreak of the symptoms, although a complete recovery was not possible till now.

It is an important supplier of liquid crystal used for LCDs, but is best known for its role in the 34-year-long pollution of the water supply in Minamata, Japan that led to thousands of deaths and victims of disease. Between 1932 and 1968, Chisso's chemical factory in Minamata released large quantities of industrial wastewater that was contaminated with highly toxic methylmercury.Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld, by David E. Kaplan & Alec Dubro This poison water bioaccumulated in local sea life that was then consumed by the immediate population. As a result of this contamination, 2,265 individuals in the area were inflicted with what is now known as Minamata disease. 1,784 of those victims died as a result of the poisoning and/or the disease.Official government figure as of March 2001. See \\"Minamata Disease: The History and Measures, ch2\\" Those who were afflicted with the disease developed skeletomuscular deformities and lost the ability to perform motor functions such as walking. Many also lost significant amounts of vision, as well as hearing and speech capabilities. Severe cases presented with insanity, paralysis, coma and then death within weeks of the onset of symptoms. As of March 2001, over 10,000 individuals had received financial remuneration from Chisso to compensate them for the harm caused by the chemical release.See \\"Minamata Disease Archives\\" , Frequently asked questions, Question 6 By 2004, Chisso Corporation had paid $86 million in compensation, and, in the same year, the company was ordered to clean up its contamination.Jane Hightower (2008). Diagnosis Mercury: Money, Politics and Poison, Island Press, p. 77. However, the incident remains controversial for not only the poisoning itself but also for the tactics that the company used to suppress the negative aftermath.Japan Focus: Minamata at 50: The Tragedy Deepens Chisso is a member of the Mizuho keiretsu.  History  = Foundation = In 1906, Shitagau Noguchi, an electrical engineering graduate of Tokyo Imperial University, founded the which operated a hydroelectric power station in ≈åkuchi, Kagoshima Prefecture. The power station supplied electricity for the gold mines in ≈åkuchi but had overcapacity. To make use of the surplus power, in 1908, Noguchi founded the which operated a carbide factory in the coastal town of Minamata, Kumamoto Prefecture, about 30 km northwest of ≈åkuchi. In the same year he merged the two companies to form the - usually referred to as Nichitsu. = Expansion = In 1909, Noguchi purchased the rights to the Frank-Caro process, whereby atmospheric nitrogen was combined with calcium carbide (a key product of the young company) to produce calcium cyanamide, a chemical fertilizer. Nitrogenous fertilizers were key to boosting agricultural production in Japan at the time, due to its lack of arable land and the small- scale nature of its farms, so the company found a ready market for its product. Nichitsu also branched out into other products produced from calcium carbide, beginning production of acetic acid, ammonia, explosives and butanol. Production of ammonium sulfate (another chemical fertilizer) started in 1914 at a plant in Kagami, Kumamoto Prefecture, using a nitrogen fixation process - a Japan first. Sales of ammonium sulfate were increasing year-on-year as were market prices. A new plant was opened at the Minamata factory in 1918 where it was able to produce ammonium sulfate for 70 yen per ton and sell it for five and a half times the cost. These massive profits enabled Nichitsu to survive the subsequent drop in prices after the return of foreign competition into the Japanese market after the end of World War I in Europe in September 1918. After the war, Noguchi visited Europe and decided Nichitsu should pioneer an alternative synthesis of ammonium sulfate in Japan. In 1924, the Nichitsu plant at Nobeoka began production using the Casale ammonia synthesis which required the use of extremely high temperatures and pressures. Once the process was proved a success, the Minamata plant was converted to the process and began mass production. Nichitsu grew steadily, invested its profits in new technology and expanded production into new areas and slowly became a large conglomerate of many different companies.George, Timothy S. (2001). Minamata: Pollution and the Struggle for Democracy in Postwar Japan. Harvard University Asia Center. . = Nichitsu in Korea = In 1924, Shitagau Noguchi decided to expand Nichitsu into Korea. In those days, Korea was a colony of Japan. In 1926, he established two companies in Korea as subsidiaries of Nichitsu, mirroring the foundation of the parent company: and . Noguchi wanted to repeat his success in ≈åkuchi and Minamata, but on an even greater scale in Korea. The power company constructed hydroelectric power plants one after another along rivers draining into the Yalu River. In 1927, the fertilizer subsidiary built a huge chemical complex in Hungnam. The hydroelectric power plants supplied electricity for the chemical plant, in the same way as the ≈åkuchi power plant had done so for the Minamata chemical factory. Nichitsu invested Korea more aggressively than any other Japanese company. It and its subsidiaries grew rapidly in Korea, and came to be recognized as an emerging zaibatsu. The difference between Nichitsu's zaibatsu and established zaibatsu like Mitsubishi and Mitsui was that Nichitsu did not have its own bank and insurance company. Nichitsu therefore relied on government-controlled banks. = Dissolution and reorganization = As Japan lost the Second World War in 1945, Nichitsu and its zaibatsu collapsed and was forced to abandon all properties and interests in Korea. Furthermore, the US-controlled Allied occupation of Japan ordered the dismissal of the company, regarding it as a company that adhered to the militarism government. In 1950, the , usually referred to as Shin Nichitsu, was founded as a successor of the old company. Other successor companies include Asahi Kasei and Sekisui Chemical. = Minamata disease = Nichitsu had started production of acetaldehyde using a mercury catalyst at its Minamata plant in May 1932, and Shin Nichitsu continued production after the war. The plant discharged wastewater from its acetaldehyde plant into Minamata Bay via Hyakken Harbour. The wastewater contained many pollutants and poisonous substances including methylmercury, a highly toxic chemical. This chemical was absorbed by fish and shellfish and bioaccumulated up the food chain. People who unknowingly ate the fish over many years suffered from severe mercury poisoning. Hajime Hosokawa, a doctor at a Shin Nichitsu's company hospital, officially reported on May 1, 1956 an \\"epidemic of an unknown disease of the central nervous system\\", marking the official discovery of Minamata disease. In 1963, doctors at Kumamoto University concluded that the cause of Minamata disease was mercury emitted by Shin Nihon Chisso Hiryo. In 1965, the company changed its name to . In May 1968, Chisso finally stopped using a mercury catalyst in the production of acetaldehyde. In 1969, patients sued Chisso for compensation. Many lawsuits were filed against Chisso after 1969, and some of them go on even now. Chisso president, later chairman Yutaka Egashira (later maternal grandfather of Masako, Empress of Japan) used yakuza in order to threaten and silence patients and their supporters. Patients and their supporters started the \\"single shareholder\\" movement by buying one share of Chisso each, which was aimed at accusing the executives of Chisso in its general meeting. A thousand of the single shareholders participating in the movement gathered in front of a hall in Osaka to attend the general meeting called on November 28, 1970, but the company prevented them from entering the hall by asking yakuza to become shareholders and occupy the hall. The meeting ended in five minutes with all the bills submitted by the board approved.David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro. Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld. University of California Press, 2003. . In addition, Chisso had American photographer and photo-journalist W. Eugene Smith beaten by yakuza goons after Smith published a highly regarded photo- essay showing the caustic injuries and birth defects Chisso had caused the Minamata population. The centerpiece of the work, titled \\"Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath\\", depicted the severe deformation of a child in her mother's arms after the child was exposed to the effects of Chisso's contamination of the water supply. In response to Chisso's beating of W. Eugene Smith for dissemination of the photographs, Smith was awarded the Robert Capa Gold Medal in 1974 for \\"best published photographic reporting from abroad requiring exceptional courage and enterprise\\". The company's \\"historical overview\\" in its current website makes no mention of their role in the mass contamination of Minamata and the dreadful aftermath, although a separate section of the website, accessed from the same list as the overview, is devoted to the subject. This section, however, is absent from the English version of the website. Additionally, their 2004 Annual Report reports an equivalent of about US$50 million (5,820 million yen) in \\"Minamata Disease Compensation Liabilities\\". From 2000 to 2003, the company also reported total compensation liabilities of over US$170 million. Their 2000 accounts also show that the Japanese and Kumamoto prefectural governments waived an enormous US$560 million in related liabilities. Their FY2004 and FY2005 reports refer to Minamata disease as \\"Mad Hatter's Disease\\", a term coined from the mercury poisoning experienced by hat-makers of the last few centuries (cf Mad Hatter).FY2004 and FY2005 financial results.

Early career  Luis Mar√≠a Fr√≥meta Pereira was born in Pimentel, Duarte Province, Dominican Republic, on November 15, 1915. He would move with his family to San Francisco de Macor√≠s some years later. The school he attended there had compulsory music lessons, so he learned much of his musical training there. In 1930, at the age of 15, he founded and was the resident conductor of the Banda del Cuerpo de Bomberos de Ciudad Trujillo (Ciudad Trujillo's Fire Brigade's Band). He also founded the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de Santo Domingo during this time. In 1933, he moved back to Santo Domingo. During these years, he would meet and work with some of his closest friends and associates: Freddy Coronado, Ernesto Chapuseaux and Sim√≥ Damir√≥n, whom he already knew from school . The Conjunto Tropical and the Santo Domingo Jazz Band were formed then, as well. Fr√≥meta then began studying Pre-Medicine in the Universidad de Santo Domingo and had to abandon all musical activity during this time. However, he eventually dropped out on his third year to dedicate himself fully to music. Duet photo  Career in Venezuela  Fr√≥meta and his orchestra arrived in Venezuela in December 1937 with his orchestra to play regularly in a dance club in Caracas, the Roof Garden. The Santo Domingo Jazz Band did well, but the club owners didn't think the name would stick- so they had Fr√≥meta change it to something more marketable. Fr√≥meta went along, which got him barred from ever returning to his native Dominican Republic as Trujillo considered the change- \\"Billo's Caracas Boys\\"- an insult. Billo, Grandes √âxitos, a compilation album of the most famous songs of the Billo's Caracas Boys, was released in 1996. Fr√≥meta continued to play in Venezuela until the fall of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez in 1958. Accused of being a supporter of the regime, he was barred by the Asociaci√≥n Musical del D.F y Estado Miranda from ever playing in Venezuela again. Following this, he moved to Cuba to play with a Cuban band there. In 1960, a special session of the National Assembly was convened in Caracas. The purpose was to lift the ban passed on Billo in 1958, which was by then considered to have been unfair. That very same year, Fr√≥meta returned to Venezuela.  Last years  On April 27, 1988, he suffered a stroke while rehearsing with the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra for a concert- tribute in his honour that would occur the very next day: just after he finished conducting the practice run for \\"Un Cubano en Caracas\\", he collapsed on the ground as the orchestra was applauding his performance. Fr√≥meta died the following week on May 5, 1988.

It applies to copyrighted work that is neither a free/open source item nor in the public domain. Concept Most modern music consists of two distinct copyright elements. One is the composition itself, which consists of both the musical composition and the lyrics, each which may have separate copyrights. The second is the sound recording, which covers both tangible copies (\\"phonorecord\\") of the performance of the work (such as vinyl albums, cassette tapes, CDs, and digital formats like MP3s) and public performances of the recording (such as over the radio). The copyright between the composition and the sound recording is frequently held by different parties. A mechanical license is a license provided by the holder of the copyright of the composition or musical work to another party to cover, reproduce, or sample specific parts of the original composition. Within copyright law within the United states, such mechanical licenses are compulsory; any party may obtain a license without permission of the license holder by paying a set license fee, that as of 2018, was set at 9.1 cents per composition or 1.75 cents per minute of composition which are to go to the composition copyright holder. These fees are paid to agencies like the Harry Fox Agency, who either already represent the composition copyright holders, or are able to direct the funds to the right party. Mechanical licenses do not apply the sound recording portion of the composition, and instead a separate non-mechanical license must be sought from the copyright holder of the sound recording (typically, the musical performer or their agency representing them). For example: Puff Daddy wants to sample the opening riff from ‚ÄúEvery Breath You Take‚Äù by The Police. He contacts the copyright holder of the underlying musical work and gets a mechanical license to use all or part of The Police‚Äôs song in his composition. He now has the right to reproduce all or part of ‚ÄúEvery Breath You Take‚Äù in his new song. He cannot, however, purchase The Police‚Äôs Greatest Hits, take the CD (or MP3 from iTunes) into the studio, pull the track off of the phonorecord, and sample the riff into his new song. For Puff Daddy to sample from the phonorecord of The Police‚Äôs music, he must get both a mechanical license from the copyright holder of the underlying musical work, and a license from the copyright holder of the phonorecord from which he copies the sample. He is free to hire musicians to reproduce the Police's sound, but he cannot copy from any phonorecord with only a mechanical license. A mechanical license can only be used after the original copyright holder has exercised their exclusive right of first publishing, or permission is negotiated. In American law, US Code Title 17, Chapter 1, Section 115(a)(2) states: \\"A compulsory license includes the privilege of making a musical arrangement of the work to the extent necessary to conform it to the style or manner of interpretation of the performance involved, but the arrangement shall not change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work ...\\" thus preventing mechanical licenses being used to make substantially derivative works of a piece of music. Musicians often use this license for self- promotion. For instance, a cellist who performed a musical work on a recording may obtain a mechanical license so he can distribute copies of the recording to others as an example of his cello playing. Recording artists also use this when they record cover versions of songs. This is common among artists who don't usually write their own songs. In the United States, this is required by copyright law regardless whether or not the copies are for commercial sale. The musician must serve the copyright owner a Notice of Intent (NOI) to obtain a compulsory license to distribute non-digital mediums of the recording. A mechanical license is not required for artists who record and distribute completely original work. History The idea of mechanical licenses came about the turn of the 19th century, with the popularity of player pianos, with the ability to play songs encoded on a roll of paper. The sheet music industry then believed that the recreation of their songs was violation of copyright, and initiated legal action that resulted in the Supreme Court of the United States case, White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co. (209 U.S. 1) in 1908. The Supreme Court ruled that the piano rolls were not copies of the plaintiff's music, but instead part of the machine that created music, and thus player piano and piano roll makers did not have to pay royalties to the sheet music composers. Songwriters lobbied to the United States Congress following the ruling, and succeeded in establishing the nature of mechanical licenses in the Copyright Act of 1909. Since then, the nature of copyright law with respect to mechanical licenses have been continually updated to include new types of phonorecords mediums and recordings. For example, in October 2006 the Register of Copyright ruled that ring tones are subject to compulsory licensing. The Music Modernization Act passed in 2018 implemented processes for digital streaming services to pay for the compulsory mechanical license through a new non-profit organization created by the law, known as the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC). The Music Modernization Act changes the process of filing Notices of Intent (NOI) to obtain a compulsory license. Whereas a potential licensee intending to make digital reproductions of the work could previously submit a NOI to the copyright office when the name and/or address of the copyright owner could not be found, under the new law, the Copyright Office no longer accepts notices of intention to obtain a mechanical license for digital phonorecord deliveries of a work. The Office continues to accept notices of intention for non-digital phonorecord deliveries (e.g., for CDs, vinyl records, tapes, and other physical media).

Bowden, The Waters of Lake Huron and Lake Superior: pt. A. Lake Huron, Georgian Bay, and the North Channel. International Joint Commission Upper Lakes Reference Group, 1977. It stretches approximately 160 nautical miles and is bordered on the east by Georgian Bay, on the west by the St. Marys River, to the north by the eastern Algoma District and part of the Sudbury District, and to the south by the islands of Manitoulin, Cockburn, Drummond and St. Joseph. At its widest point it is over 30 km (20 miles) wide.Boating Georgian Bay In addition to Georgian Bay, the North Channel is connected to the main body of Lake Huron by the False Detour Channel and the Mississagi Strait, which separate the above-noted islands. The channel is recognized as one of the best freshwater cruising grounds in the world. There are full-service marinas in various small communities along the shore providing sufficient provisions. A large section of the north shore is bordered by La Cloche Provincial Park providing for a scenic environment.The North Channel Little Current as seen across the North Channel The only road crossings of the North Channel are at the Little Current Swing Bridge, which carries Highway 6 between Manitoulin Island and the mainland of Northern Ontario, and the Bernt Gilbertson Bridge, which carries Highway 548 from the mainland onto St. Joseph Island. The bridges are located at two of the narrowest points along the entire channel. The North Channel lies under the jurisdiction of the Georgian Bay Land Trust. The Georgian Bay Land Trust is an organization which seeks to preserve land of ecological, geological, and historical importance. The communities on the mainland side of the North Channel, between the townships of Tarbutt and Nairn and Hyman, are commonly grouped as the North Shore region. This designation does not generally include the communities on St. Joseph or Manitoulin islands.

In Spanish sources, they are termed parcialidades or barrios.Carrasco, Pedro. \\"Calpulli.\\" In Dav√≠d Carrasco (ed). The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures. Vol 1. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. A Nahua city-state was divided into a number of calpullis, whose inhabitants were collectively responsible for different organizational and religious tasks in relation to the larger altepetl. Calpullis controlled land which was available for calpulli members to cultivate and also operated the Tƒìlpochcalli schools for young men of commoner descent. In Aztec culture, as in most other civilizations, the family unit was very important. There were several levels of organization in Aztec family life beginning with the base family unit. The base family unit consisted of two parents and their unmarried children. The main functions of the base family unit were education of the children and food preparation. Many base family units, however, banded together to form extended families. The households of extended families were usually composed of several brothers and their families. The primary functions of the extended families were to coordinate land use and food production (such as growing crops). In most cases, extended families contained just a few base family units. In large cities, however, they often grew to many more. Although extended families farmed the land, they usually did not own it. They were allowed to use it by the calpulli to which they belonged. Calpulli were groups of families that controlled the use of the land and performed other territorial functions, as well as social ones. The majority of calpulli had a telpuchcalli, a school for young men. Another function of the calpulli was a taxation unit. The empire collected taxes from each calpulli, which in turn collected taxes from its member families. Most rural calpulli were based on lineage. In other words, the members of a rural calpulli believed that they were descended from a common ancestor. In the cities, the calpulli were based more on geographical, political, and occupational similarities than lineage. In both cases, calpulli were tightly knit and sometimes were even somewhat isolated from other calpulli, both politically and physically. The nature of the interrelatedness between the members of the calpulli is a matter of debate. Traditionally it has been argued that the calpulli was firstly a family unit in which the inhabitants were related through blood and intermarriage. Other scholars such as Van Zantwijk (1985) deny that this was necessarily the case. Van Zantwijk demonstrates that at least in some altepetl the family-based nature of the calpulli was replaced with a hierarchical structure based on wealth and prestige. Newcomers from other altepetl were allowed to settle down and become part of the calpulli. Michael Smith (2003) shows that in some Nahua cities, notably Otumba, each calpulli specialised in a trade and took almost the form of a trade guild. Calpullis of Tenochtitlan The wards of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, were also known as calpulli. The exact number of calpullis within the city is not known but Van Zantwijk (1985) based his calculations on a wide array of ethnohistorical sources. Van Zantwijk reached a number of 20 calpullis, 7 of which represented the original founding groups of Tenochtitlan and the remaining 13 being composed by groups coming to the city at later points in its development.

Attempts by the New Jersey Legislature to reform local government and the school systems led to the breakup of most of Bergen County's townships into small boroughs, communities that still balkanize the state's political map. This occurred following the development of commuter suburbs in New Jersey, residents of which wanted more government services than did the long- time rural population. In the late 19th century, much of New Jersey was divided into large townships. In Bergen County, several of these townships contained multiple commuter suburbs, often formed around railroad stations. Political disputes arose between the growing number of commuters, who wanted more government services for the new developments near railroad lines, and long-time residents such as farmers, who feared higher taxes. A previously little-used law permitted small segments of existing townships to vote by referendum to form independent boroughs. In late 1893, Republicans, backed by commuters, captured control of the legislature and the following year passed legislation allowing boroughs that were formed from parts of two or more townships to elect a representative to the county Board of Chosen Freeholders. This 1894 act, in combination with a second one the same year that consolidated school districts into one per municipality, made it easy and attractive for dissatisfied communities to break away and become boroughs, in order to gain a seat on the county board or to keep control of the local school. Forty new boroughs were formed in 1894 and 1895, with the bulk in Bergen County, where townships were broken up or greatly reduced in size; there are few there today. Feeling that the 1894 laws had allowed the formation of an excessive number of municipalities, the legislature scuttled the right to elect a freeholder in 1895, and ended the formation of boroughs by referendum the following year. Municipalities continued to be created by the legislature into the 20th century, and although there have been efforts at consolidation in recent years to lower the cost of government, their number has been only slightly reduced.  Background  Bergen County (and neighboring Passaic County) in 1872 At the time of the union of East Jersey and West Jersey into the Province of New Jersey in 1702, there were about 24 townships; more were added under British government by letters patent, court decrees, or legislative action. Following the American Revolutionary War, the New Jersey Legislature confirmed all municipal charters, and granted new ones; by 1798, the state had 104 townships. Increased economic activity in Essex, Morris and Sussex counties, and the formation of Warren County, raised the number to 125 by 1834. Most of the townships had low taxes and little government; the roads (mostly of dirt) were maintained by farmers in lieu of taxes. Township meetings occurred each February; the citizens would discuss concerns, seek solutions, and collectively appoint agents to carry out their will. Voters in each township elected members of the county governing body, the Board of Chosen Freeholders. The railroad brought major changes to New Jersey beginning in the mid-19th century. The state was mostly agricultural, and the new lines made it easier for farmers to get their crops to market. But they also made it easier for those employed in New York City or Philadelphia to live outside the urban core and yet go to work each day. Even before the Civil War, the Brick Church station, in Orange, Essex County, about from New York City, became the center of the nation's first commuter suburb. New Jersey's townships acquired a new population, of commuters, who formed communities near railroad stations, and who wanted good well-lit streets and roads, quality schools, and a stake in the government. They were bitterly opposed on each issue by the rural, agricultural population (or \\"punkin dusters\\"), who feared that their taxes would be raised to pay for services they did not want or expect to utilize. Schools and school districts caused angry debate between commuters and long-time residents. School district lines were independent of those of townships, for every school formed its own school district. Accordingly, townships could contain a number of school districts: Bergen County's Franklin Township in the early 1890s contained eleven school districts serving 774 students. Bergen County was sparsely populated when the railroad lines went through in the 1850s, making for a different pattern of development than other suburban counties, such as Union and Camden, which saw more planned development around railroad stations. Bergen's pattern of development was unique in New Jersey, with, until 1894, several commuter suburbs in a single township, something rare elsewhere in the state. The town- meeting style of government then prescribed for townships proved ill-suited to those changing times. The New Jersey Constitution gave the state government in Trenton relatively weak powers over the townships, but from time to time the legislature attempted reform. The townships were divided into road districts, with residents appointed to see that maintenance was done; in 1859, the state allowed residents of each district to elect a road commissioner, who saw to it their road taxes were spent effectively. Many of these districts later became individual municipalities, with the road commissioner often the first mayor.  Legislation  Monmouth County, New Jersey displays a number of \\"doughnut holes\\" where boroughs have seceded from the townships around them. Until 1875, municipalities had been created or modified only by special acts of the legislature, but a state constitutional amendment that year abolished special laws for individual municipalities. Thereafter, lawmakers passed general laws regarding municipalities, and left incorporation of new ones to referenda in areas wanting redress, and to the courts. In 1878, the legislature passed the Borough Act, allowing landowners in an area less than and with fewer than 1,000 people to seek a referendum on secession from the township to become a borough. This referendum could take place on petition of the owners of 10 percent of the land, as measured by value, in the area in question, and 10 days notice of the vote was required. In 1882, the legislature expanded this measure to allow areas of less than to become borough commissions with some autonomy within the township. Another impetus towards more municipalities developed in the 1870s, with the New Jersey public soured on the railroads because of the Panic of 1873. The newly Democratic legislature passed laws that ended tax exemptions on railroad-owned lands. Much of the land, generally near stations, was sold off, and was transformed into communities that in the following years would secede from the township in which they lay, creating some of the \\"doughnut holes\\", with boroughs surrounded by the townships they were formerly part of, that mark the New Jersey municipal landscape today. In the 1893 elections, Republicans recaptured control of the New Jersey Legislature. This was due in part to another economic depression, the Panic of 1893, which had occurred with Democrat Grover Cleveland in the White House, and in part because some Democrats, like Republicans before them, had proven corrupt. The increasing commuter population also played a role; Bergen County contained (and still does) many commuter communities because of its proximity to New York City. These new residents were strongly Republican, as contrasted with the Democratic farmers. According to Bergen County historian Kevin Wright, \\"Having gained sufficient numbers by 1893 to challenge Punkin Dusters at the polls, the Commuters of Bergen County led a political revolution in Home Rule that finally toppled the ancien r√©gime.\\" Legal disputes about control of the New Jersey Senate and the Republican desire to undo many Democratic policies occupied the legislature in the early part of its 1894 session. Nevertheless, interest groups such as local landowners pushed the legislature for permissive policies on municipal incorporation, hoping to gain power in the new governments. The New Jersey State House in Trenton, where the 1894 acts were passed As the legislature sat, the townships of Bergen County fractured. The provision of the Borough Act allowing separation had been little used prior to 1893. A year-long legal battle in Palisades Township, along the Hudson River, led to a referendum that saw Tenafly break away in January 1894. Some communities seceded in early 1894 because of disputes about how to pay for macadamized roads, which were first paved through much of Bergen County in the first half of the 1890s. The Hackensack Republican reported on March 1, \\"the chief reason why Delford [later Oradell], Westwood, Hillsdale and Park Ridge want to become boroughs is that they may avoid what is feared will be heavy macadam tax\\". The proposed borough of Delford would take land from multiple townships, uniting communities on both sides of the Hackensack River that shared a school, but incorporation was put on hold because of legal uncertainty as to whether a borough could be formed from parts of more than one township. In April, the Republican majority in Trenton let it be known they were working on a bill to solve Delford's problem by allowing boroughs to be formed from portions of two or more townships, and this became the Act of May 9, 1894. The act also granted such boroughs a seat on the county Board of Chosen Freeholders. According to Wright, \\"the consequences of casting special legislation under guise of a general law soon became patent\\". Since 1885, new boroughs had not gotten their own freeholder, with borough voters instead joining with those in the township they were formerly part of to elect one. Partisans saw the political possibilities of the 1894 law, and contested control of the Bergen County government through the formation of boroughs that would elect freeholders of their party. The energetic legislators finally reached school reform with Chapter CCCXXXV of the Public Laws of 1894. That act, passed on May 25, provided that \\"the several school districts in each township shall be consolidated into one school district\\". The legislature's intent was to equalize funding between wealthier districts and poorer ones. Had the legislature done no more, according to former New Jersey General Assembly Speaker Alan Karcher, \\"New Jersey might have had fewer than 500 municipalities today\\". However, the legislature further enacted in the bill, \\"that each city, borough, and incorporated town, shall be a school district, separate and distinct from the township school district\\". Thus, if a community seceded from its township to form a borough, it would keep control of its school. The new township school districts would be responsible for the debts of their predecessors, meaning that some communities faced the prospect of paying off, in part, the debts of others, and seeing some of their tax dollars going to fund others' schools. Under the law, by becoming an incorporated borough, they could avoid these things. The school legislation greatly fueled the borough craze in Bergen County. Wealthy communities that had had their own school districts now faced the prospect of sharing their school tax revenues with poorer areas, or of being divided up piecemeal in borough referenda. Allendale broke away, principally from Franklin Township, because of such fears. At 650 people, Allendale was one of the more populous boroughs formed in 1894. In such commuter communities as Park Ridge, those new residents often led the borough drives against the opposition of the old inhabitants who feared the improvements would not benefit them and that the new borough would quickly incur debt through issuance of municipal bonds. Another new borough created by the residents to keep local school control was Woodcliff, which was formed around the settlement of Pascack from parts of Harrington Township and Orvil Township, and which in 1910 became Woodcliff Lake. Rural Upper Saddle River broke away from Orvil Township and Hohokus Township, taking one of Orvil Township's six schoolhouses‚Äîthe press noted that the nascent borough would most likely go Democratic as only 16 Republicans could be found. Ridgewood, then a township, avoided further depredations by Midland Park and Glen Rock by incorporating as a village. The borough of Wood-Ridge was formed after the boundary lines were carefully drawn with an eye to the referendum, to exclude the home of a family of prominent landowners who were opposed to the incorporation‚Äîthough not excluding their farmland. Once Wood-Ridge was successfully established, the farmhouse was annexed by borough ordinance. Of the 40 boroughs created in 1894 and 1895, 26 were in Bergen County. The ones elsewhere included Roselle and Mountainside, in Union County. In September 1894, state Senator Henry D. Winton warned that the legislature at its next session was likely to amend if not gut the Borough Act because of the craze in Bergen County. Nine new members had been added to the Board of Chosen Freeholders from the previous sixteen, Winton noted, with a proportionate increase in the cost of government, which would be further inflated by the multiplicity of boroughs. The signal that the law might change did not slow the incorporations: Wood-Ridge, Carlstadt, Edgewater, Old Tappan and other boroughs trace their geneses to late 1894. There were some fistfights and hard feelings over the borough formations, and Russell Jones, whose house was on the newly drawn line between Teaneck and Bogota, saw it burn down as firefighters argued about who had jurisdiction.  Aftermath and legacy  The wave of incorporations continued into 1895, with Cliffside Park gaining borough status in January. That month, Bergen County's school superintendent, John Terhune, wrote a report to Trenton, decrying that the law allowed borough petitioners to set the proposed lines to exclude opponents of incorporation, \\"The idea of allowing a bare majority the power to accept or reject a few that have dared to oppose the new fad, and for this simple expression of their rights to cut them from all school facilities is radically wrong and gross injustice. There is no defense for the injured, but they must meekly accept the situation. It is inconsistent with liberty, a term so dear to us all\\". Superintendent Terhune wrote that \\"until the boroughing is done\\", it would not be possible to assess the many problems that the rapid subdivision had caused: \\"I would not attempt to estimate, let alone approximate, the changes caused by the boroughs. It is simply inconceivable\\". The Act of February 18, 1895 amended the previous year's borough bill to raise the requirement for incorporation petitions from owners of 10 percent of the land value to 50 percent. The rush was also slowed by the legislature deciding that no borough created thereafter could maintain a separate school system unless there were at least 400 children living within its limits. With the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders by then at 28 members, divided evenly between the parties, the legislature passed a bill setting the number of members of such boards in third-class counties (including Bergen) at 9, with the freeholders elected from the Delford-style boroughs to go out of office on May 8. Nevertheless, on May 9, electors in what became the borough of Englewood Cliffs voted to secede from Englewood, 34‚Äì1. The Woodcliff School, Woodcliff Lake, Bergen County. The schoolhouse built for the new borough in 1895 is still part of its middle school. North Arlington was incorporated as a borough by a referendum held on March 26, 1896, the day the state legislature passed a bill providing that, \\"no borough or village shall hereafter be incorporated in this state except by special act of the legislature.\\" The following year, the legislature undertook a thorough revision of the laws relating to boroughs, and forbade incorporations, dissolutions, or boundary changes without its leave. This simply moved the venue for conflicts over schools from local referenda to the corridors of the State House in Trenton. Boroughs continued to be incorporated by legislative act, with a major burst in the 1920s. These 20th century increases in the number of boroughs were sometimes caused by conflicts over road funds, causing Caldwell Township, Essex County, to divide into six municipalities by 1908, and with Clementon Township, Camden County fracturing into nine between 1915 and 1929. By the 1920s, the number of municipalities in Bergen County had reached 70, where it still stands. After the 1920s, the legislature did not create many new municipalities, but local officials used zoning to affect land use, making annexation less attractive. Because of boroughitis, the township as a form of government all but disappeared from Bergen County. One that remains is South Hackensack, the remnants of Lodi Township that no seceding borough wanted. Its three pieces are separated from each other by several miles. A number of boroughs became townships in the early 1980s, though they did not necessarily change their form of government, as until 1986, more federal aid was available to municipalities called townships than to those styled boroughs. As of 2014, New Jersey has 565 municipalities, more than eight other states combined, and the highest number of municipalities per capita of any state. Its boroughs include Teterboro in Bergen County, site of an airport, industrial buildings, and the homes of fewer than a hundred residents, and Pine Valley and Tavistock in Camden County, each consisting primarily of a country club. Governor Chris Christie urged consolidation to lower the cost of government, and a number of municipalities have studied it, but the only significant recent merger has been that of Princeton Borough with Princeton Township (2012). Karcher, both while Speaker and afterwards, promoted consolidation, but saw it fall victim to home rule advocates. He discussed the long-term effect of the boroughitis craze:  References   Sources    Category:1890s in New Jersey Category:1894 in New Jersey Category:Bergen County, New Jersey Category:History of New Jersey Category:Local government in New Jersey ","title":"Boroughitis"},{"id":"3929613","text":"Carnival Legend is a operated by Carnival Cruise Line. Built by Kv√¶rner Masa-Yards at its Helsinki New Shipyard in Helsinki, Finland, she was floated out on December 17, 2001, and christened by English actress and author Dame Judi Dench in Harwich, Essex, UK, on August 21, 2002. Her maiden voyage, Carnival's first cruise in Europe, was a three-night journey from Harwich to Amsterdam and return. Eighty percent of Carnival Legends staterooms have ocean views and eighty percent of those have private balconies. She was the first Carnival ship to offer alternative dining options and an onboard wedding chapel.  Ports of call  In 2013, Carnival Legend offered a series of Baltic and Mediterranean cruises from April to November. The ship then offered 7-day cruises to the Western Caribbean from Tampa, Florida. Following the success of the Carnival Spirit, Carnival Legend underwent a major dry-dock refurbishment in February 2014. In August 2014, she departed Tampa and made her way through the Panama Canal to reposition to Australia. From 2014 to 2019, Carnival Legend sailed seasonally from Sydney on 8-day/12-day cruises to the Pacific Islands from September to April and cruised around Alaska from Seattle in the summer seasons. Accidents and incidents = Bottle smashing issue= On August 21, 2002, during the christening ceremony, Judi Dench took three attempts to smash the bottle against the ship's hull, aided by ship's captain Claudio Cupisti. The third attempt successfully smashed the bottle but Dench was sprayed with champagne as a result. = Listing = On July 13, 2005, Carnival Legend departed Tortola and was heading back to New York City. At 5:10 PM, the ship suddenly listed to the port side while making a hard starboard turn, resulting in some minor injuries. The crew announced afterwards that there had been a computer glitch. The ship's promenade had to be closed for several hours due to broken glass. On August 29, 2016 at approximately 6:15 pm PT while sailing to Victoria, British Columbia, the turning valve in one of the ship's four engines failed, causing the ship to make a hard port side turn and list to the port side. Captain Giuseppe Gazzano had manually controlled the ship towards Victoria as safety precaution. There were no reported serious injuries but the ship arrived at Victoria two hours behind schedule. = Engine room overheating = On August 3, 2005, around 22:00, heavy smoke was seen coming from the lower levels towards the bow of the ship. Passengers were requested to move to the upper, open decks. The cruise director announced that \\"there was a problem in the engine room and that something had overheated\\". Passengers remained in the open air until the issue was corrected. = Passenger death = During a May 20, 2006 cruise, a 35-year-old passenger from Plumstead, Pennsylvania, was presumed dead after jumping off the Carnival Legend at 1 am on Saturday, May 27, 2006. He was reported to have jumped out of his balcony room after an argument with his wife in front of his children, 450 miles northeast of Florida. The ship remained in the vicinity for eleven hours, delaying the Legend's arrival back to New York City the following day until 8 pm. Coast Guard officials were sent out to aid in the search, but his body was never located. =Collision with Enchantment of the Seas = On September 30, 2009, as Carnival Legend was leaving the berth in Cozumel, heavy winds pushed the ship against the side of Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines . Carnival Legend sustained damage to her open deck areas, as well as broken glass. Both ships were able to leave for their next scheduled port after being cleared by port authorities. = Mechanical issue = On February 13, 2010, Carnival Legend had to reduce speed and return to her home port due to a mechanical problem that drastically reduced the ship's speed. Passengers reported hearing grinding noises and vibrations coming from the engine room. The ship made it back to its home port of Tampa several hours late. The next voyage resulted in a late departure and a schedule change of Cozumel instead of Grand Cayman. = Azipod failure = On March 13, 2013, a technical issue with one of the ship's Azipods affected the ship's sailing speed. As a result, Carnival Legend failed to reach her next scheduled port call in Belize City, Belize. She instead stopped in Costa Maya, Mexico, then proceeded to her next scheduled port call in Roatan, Honduras on March 14, 2013. Her visit to Grand Cayman scheduled for March 15, 2013 was cancelled shortly after the ship departed from Roatan. Further technical issues affected the itineraries of the subsequent sailings on March 17, 2013 and March 24, 2013. The U.S. Coast Guard announced an investigation of the incident. =Brawl= In February 2018, violent brawls erupted during a 10-day journey in the South Pacific. Police removed six men and three teenage boys from the ship during an unscheduled stop in Eden, New South Wales. Other passengers reported that they had locked themselves in their cabins for safety and that a large family group had been picking fights during the cruise. Up to 30 people were injured. Video footage showed security guards and other staff kicking a passenger on the ground. =Collision with Carnival Glory= On December 20, 2019 Carnival Legend was struck by Carnival Glory in Cozumel, while Glory was maneuvering to dock alongside it. One passenger on board the Carnival Glory sustained a minor injury.

Coutts, NZ Herald, 2 July 2004. was a New Zealand inventor who revolutionised the science of brewing beer. He is best known for the continuous fermentation method. History Coutts' German grandfather, Frederick Joseph K√ºhtze, began brewing beer in Otago, New Zealand in the late 19th century. In 1900 he moved to Palmerston North and set up the family brewery. The brewery was inherited by William Joseph K√ºhtze, who changed the family name to Coutts during World War I to sound more British. When William K√ºhtze became seriously ill as a result of the Spanish flu in 1918, Morton Coutts took over the brewery at age 15 with the aid of his mentor, Conor W. Cary. Continuous fermentation method In the 1930s, Coutts investigated the nature of yeast which is the most important ingredient in any brewing. Coutts speculated: ...that yeast could be properly controlled if you looked on it as a human being with a brain. It has so many enzyme mechanisms to call upon to react to whatever is necessary for its survival. Instead of looking on the final product I always took notice of the yeast as an organism that produced whatever you ended up with. This led him to create the wort stabilisation process, which resulted in a clearer and consistent wort. He then separated the fermentation into stages. In the first stage the yeast grew and in the second the fermentation began. The yeast was thus encouraged to either grow or produce alcohol. As a result, Coutts created a continuous flow between the two fermentation processes. In the 1983 Queen's Birthday Honours, Coutts was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the brewing industry. Other work Apart from his several patents for the brewing of beer, Coutts was also the first person in New Zealand to broadcast television signals, and the first to send a shortwave radio message to Britain. Note: Obituary is incorrect with regards to the shortwave message to Britain. The first NZ to Britain radio contact was on 18 October 1924 between Frank D. Bell, Z4AA and Cecil W. Goyder, G2SZ and this was the first ever trans-world two-way radio contact.

It is a lengthy, loosely defined (jam-based) protest of the Vietnam War, and perhaps a broader comment on conflict of any kind. At a performance in Berkeley, California, Hendrix introduced the song: Hendrix's 12-minute performance of \\"Machine Gun\\" for the Band of Gypsys is often lauded as his greatest, and is considered a stunning display of guitar virtuosity. Hendrix's long guitar solos and percussive riffs combine with controlled feedback to simulate the sounds of a battlefield, such as helicopters, dropping bombs, explosions, machine guns, and the screams and cries of those wounded or grieving. Although a proper studio recording was never realized, several other live recordings exist. Origins Hendrix debuted \\"Machine Gun\\" in September 1969 in a performance on The Dick Cavett Show. He was backed by drummer Mitch Mitchell, bassist Cox, and conga player Juma Sultan, who along with Larry Lee and Jerry Velez, performed at Woodstock as \\"Gypsy Sun and Rainbows\\". At about two and a half minutes, it is the shortest known performance of the song. Later releases vary from ten to twenty minutes. The improvisatory material revolves around a core descending riff and bassline: the song opens with a Uni-Vibe-based guitar riff intended to mimic the sound of a firing machine gun. The bass and drum patterns then commence. The rather sparse lyrics, which differ in every performance, relate the point of view of a soldier fighting in war: With the Band of Gypsys, Hendrix's vocals are accompanied by drummer Miles's vocals. \\"Machine Gun\\" is a prime example of Hendrix's use of guitar effects, as most recordings use a wah-wah pedal, an Arbiter Fuzz Face, a Univibe pedal, and an Octavia pedal, as well as heavy feedback. Two additional performances of the song appear on the expanded Band of Gypsys' album Live at the Fillmore East released in 1999. A fourth is included on Machine Gun: The Fillmore East First Show (2016). Later performances with Mitchell and Cox are included on Live at Berkeley (2003) and Blue Wild Angel: Live at the Isle of Wight (2002). Midnight Lightning version During the writing and recording of (what would have been) Hendrix's fourth studio album, Hendrix began a studio version of \\"Machine Gun\\", which was later heavily edited by Alan Douglas and released on the 1975 posthumous album Midnight Lightning. This version, which was edited to 7:30 (actual length was about 12:56), was not well received among fans, as Douglas had brought in session musicians to overdub drum, bass and even guitar parts, which had been lacking due to either poor recording quality or damage to the tapes. Although the Hendrix estate gained control of his recordings in 1995 and re-released what are presumed to be authentic recordings of some of the songs that Douglas had overdubbed, an unaltered studio version of \\"Machine Gun\\" has yet to be issued. Other renditions Drawing upon the protest theme, The Isley Brothers recorded a medley of the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's song \\"Ohio\\" and Hendrix's \\"Machine Gun\\" (titled \\"Ohio\\" / \\"Machine Gun\\") on their 1971 album Givin' It Back.

Career Koppe made his big league debut on August 9, 1958, for the Braves. He appeared in 16 games for Milwaukee in the later part of the season, but did not make an appearance when the Braves won the National League pennant and went to the World Series. Just prior to the season, Koppe was traded to the Phillies as part of a six-player deal. Koppe came into his own in his first season in Philadelphia. He saw action in 126 games (113 at shortstop), in his true rookie season. Koppe put up a respectable offensive season, hitting .261, with 18 doubles, seven triples, and seven home runs, while scoring 68 runs. His seven triples placed 8th in the National League (NL). Koppe injured his wrist in and missed all but 58 games. He played just 9 more games with the Phillies in and was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers, who traded him again ‚Äî just 12 days later ‚Äî to the St. Louis Cardinals, in May, 1961. Koppe saw no playing time for the Cardinals and did not see any MLB action for a full month. He was purchased by the Angels on June 19, 1961. As an Angel, Koppe made a serious effort to return to the performance level of his rookie season. He never saw more than 375 at-bats in any season for the Angels and finished his career with the team a .236 hitter. Koppe was primarily a middle infielder, however, and was always able to contribute defensively. Death Koppe died on September 27, 2006, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, after a seven-year battle with cancer.

Prior to the show's cancellation after the 2016 election, the show was hosted by the television journalist and political commentator, Brit Hume, following Van Susteren's departure from Fox News on September 6, 2016. The show was named On the Record with Greta Van Susteren and On the Record with Brit Hume during each host's respective runs. The program featured news stories of the day, following the latest information from correspondents on location and officials related to the issue. Like most networks, the program also consisted of analysis from legal analysts of the network and the host on the stories it was following. Additionally, the program also derailed from criminal stories to follow breaking news of the day, as do other programs on the network.  History  From its debut on February 4, 2002, to October 4, 2013, the program broadcast live out of Fox News's Washington studio each weekday at 10:00 p.m. ET and replayed at 1:00 a.m. ET.

The camps operate in the United States, Canada, and Israel. All Ramah camps serve kosher food and are Shabbat-observant. History During the 1940s, the Jewish Theological Seminary established Camp Ramah as a tool for furthering Jewish education. The founders, including Rabbi Ralph Simon of Chicago, envisioned an informal camp setting where Jewish youth would reconnect with the synagogue and Jewish tradition, and a new cadre of American-born Jewish leadership could be cultivated. The founders of Ramah camps were inspired by Camp Massad and Camp Cejwin. The first camp opened in Conover, Wisconsin in 1947. The program was drawn up by Moshe Davis and Sylvia Ettenberg of the JTS Teachers' Institute. In October 2007, Ettenberg was awarded Pras Ramah (the Ramah Prize) as part of Ramah's 60th anniversary celebrations. Many of the early staff were ex-Camp Massad people and JTS students. In 1950, the second Ramah camp opened in the Poconos and in 1953, the third Ramah camp opened in Connecticut (this camp was later moved to Massachusetts). In addition to typical summer camp activities, Ramah camps offer an educational program focusing on Judaism, Zionism, and Hebrew-language instruction on different levels. Camp Ramah offers sleep-away camps with an option to stay for either two, four, or eigh weeks, day camps with busing, an Israel summer tour program for teenagers, a day camp in Jerusalem for American and Israeli children, and a variety of high school programs in Israel. In addition to its university-aged American counselors, specialists and educators, the staff of each camp is joined by a corps of emissaries from Israel known as the \\"mishlachat/◊û◊ô◊©◊ú◊ó◊™\\". Educational impact A Trinity College researcher, Ariella Keysar, documented a significant impact of Ramah on college students: She found that Ramah graduates were three times more likely to date only Jews, four times more likely to attend synagogue services, and three times as likely as the general Jewish population to spend significant time in Israel. According to the Jewish Agency for Israel, Camp Ramah \\"is not just a camp, it‚Äôs a lifestyle.\\" Among North American olim, one finds communities of former Americans who attended Camp Ramah and reconnected later in life. Many spiritual leaders, social justice advocates, educators, and community board members in North America trace their strong Jewish values and commitment to Judaism to their summers at Ramah. An educational initiative by Camp Ramah produced Siddur Lev Yisrael,\\"Remarks at Cantors' Assembly Convention\\" , Rabbi Sheldon Dorph (National Ramah Director), 2001-05-08.

Regret is the emotion of wishing one had made a different decision in the past, because the consequences of the decision were unfavorable. Regret is related to perceived opportunity. Its intensity varies over time after the decision, in regard to action versus inaction, and in regard to self-control at a particular age. The self-recrimination which comes with regret is thought to spur corrective action and adaptation. In Western societies adults have the highest regrets regarding choices of their education. Definition Regret has been defined by psychologists in the late 1990s as a \\"negative emotion predicated on an upward, self-focused, counterfactual inference\\". Another definition is \\"an aversive emotional state elicited by a discrepancy in the outcome values of chosen vs. unchosen actions\\".Zeelenberg M, Pieters R. A theory of regret regulation 1.0. J Consum Psychol. 2007;17(1):3‚Äì18. Regret differs from remorse in that people can regret things beyond their control, but remorse indicates a sense of responsibility for the situation. For example, a person can feel regret that people die during natural disasters, but cannot feel remorse for that situation. However, a person who intentionally harms someone should feel remorse for those actions. Agent regret is the idea that a person could be involved in a situation, and regret their involvement even if those actions were innocent, unintentional, or involuntary. For example, if someone decides to die by stepping in front of a moving vehicle, the death is not the fault of the driver, but the driver may still regret that the person died. Regret is distinct from disappointment. Both are negative emotional experiences relating to a loss outcome, and both have similar neuronal correlates. However, they differ in regard to feedback about the outcome, comparing the difference between outcomes for the chosen vs. unchosen action; In regret, full feedback occurs and with disappointment partial feedback. They also differ in regard to agency (self in regret versus external in disappointment).  Models There are conceptual models of regret in regret (decision theory) mostly in theoretical economics and finance under a field called behavioral economics. Anticipated regret, or how much regret one thinks one will feel in the future, appears to be overestimated for actions and choices. This appears to be, in part, due to a tendency to underestimate the extent to which people attribute bad outcomes to external factors rather than to internal factors (i.e., themselves). It can lead to inaction or inertia and omission bias. Existential regret has been specifically defined as \\"a profound desire to go back and change a past experience in which one has failed to choose consciously or has made a choice that did not follow one‚Äôs beliefs, values, or growth needs\\". Instruments to measure regret in people having to make medical decisions have failed to address current concepts of regret and failed to differentiate regret from disappointment. They have also not looked for positive impacts of regret. Process regret may occur, if a person does not consider information about all available choices before making a decision. Life domains A 2005 meta- analysis of 9 studies (7 US, one Germany, one Finland) about what adults regret most concluded, that overall adults regret choices regarding their education the most. Subsequent rankings included decisions about career, romance, and parenting. Education has been the forerunner of regret in the U.S. per Gallup surveys in 1949, 1953, and 1965. Education was the forerunner of regret because it is seen as something where circumstances could be changed: \\"In contemporary society, education is open to continual modification throughout life. With the rise of community colleges and student aid programs in recent decades, education of some sort is accessible to nearly all socioeconomic groups.\\"This finding can be attributed to the principle of perceived opportunity. \\"People¬¥s biggest regrets are a reflection of where in life they see their largest opportunities; that is, where they see tangible prospects for change, growth, and renewal. In other cultures, regrets may be ranked differently depending on the perceived opportunity in a particular society. =In health care decisions= A 2016 review of past studies found risk factors for people to develop \\"decision regret\\" regarding their health care were: higher decisional conflict, lower satisfaction with the decision, adverse outcomes in physical health, and greater anxiety levels. =Deathbed regrets= A 2018 study found that people were more likely to express \\"ideal- related regrets\\", such as failing to follow their dreams and live up to their full potential. This was found to correlate with the anecdotal accounts of palliative care nurse Bronnie Ware about the most common regrets she had heard expressed by those nearing death, which included: # \\"I wish I‚Äôd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.\\" # \\"I wish I hadn‚Äôt worked so hard.\\" # \\"I wish I‚Äôd had the courage to express my feelings.\\" # \\"I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.\\" # \\"I wish that I had let myself be happier.\\" Determinants of intensity =Action versus inaction= There is an interplay between action versus inaction and time. Regrets of an action are more intense in the short term, whereas regrets of inaction are more intense over the long term. =Age= In a 2001 study, high intensity of regret and intrusive thoughts in older adults was related to self-control, and low internal control was expected to be self-protective and help to decrease regret. In younger adults, internal-control facilitated active change and was associated with low intensity of regret. =Opportunity= People's biggest regrets occur where they perceive the greatest and most important opportunity for corrective action. When no opportunity exists to improve conditions, thought processes mitigate the cognitive dissonance caused by regret, e.g. by rationalization, and reconstrual. Regret pushes people toward revised decision making and corrective action as part of learning that may bring improvement in life circumstances. A 1999 study measured regret in accordance to negative reviews with service providers. Regret was an accurate predictor of who switched providers. As more intense regret is experienced, the likelihood of initiating change is increased. Consequently, the more opportunity of corrective action available, the larger the regret felt and the more likely corrective action is achieved. Feeling regret spurs future action to make sure other opportunities are taken so that regret will not be experienced again. People learn from their mistakes. =Lost opportunity principle= With a lost opportunity regret should intensify, not diminish, when people feel that they could have made better choices in the past but now perceive limited opportunities to take corrective action in the future. \\"People who habitually consider future consequences (and how they may avoid future negative outcomes) experience less, rather than more, intense regret after a negative outcome.\\" This principle offers another reason as to why education is the most regretted aspect in life. Education becomes a more limited opportunity as time passes. Aspects such as making friends, becoming more spiritual, and community involvement tend to be less regrettable which makes sense because these are also aspects in life that do not become limited opportunities. As the opportunity to remedy a situation passes, feelings of hopelessness may increase. An explanation of the lost opportunity principle can be seen as a lack of closure: Low closure makes past occurrences feel unresolved. Low closure is associated with \\"reductions in self-esteem and persistent negative affect over time\\" and with the realization and regret of lost opportunity. High closure is associated with acceptance of lost opportunity. The lost opportunity principle suggests, that regret does not serve as a corrective motive (which the opportunity principle suggests). Instead, regret serves as a more general reminder to seize the day. Regret lingers where opportunity existed, with the self-blame of remorse being a core element to ultimately spur corrective action in decision-making. Neuroscience Research upon brain injury and fMRI have linked the orbitofrontal cortex to the processing of regret. Completeness of feedback about the outcomes after making a decision determined whether persons experienced regret (outcomes from both the choice and the alternative) vs. disappointment (partial-feedback, seeing only the outcome from the choice) in a magnetoencephalography study. Another factor was the type of agency: With personal decision making the neural correlates of regret could be seen, with external agency (computer choice) those of disappointment. Feedback regret showed greater brain activity in the right anterior and posterior regions, with agency regret producing greater activity in the left anterior region. Both regret and disappointment activated anterior insula and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex but only with regret the lateral orbitofrontal cortex was activated. Psychopathic individuals do not show regret and remorse. This was thought to be due to an inability to generate this emotion in response to negative outcomes. However, in 2016, people with antisocial personality disorder and dissocial personality disorder were found to experience regret, but did not use the regret to guide their choice in behavior. There was no lack of regret but a problem to think through a range of potential actions and estimating the outcome values. In other species A study published in 2014 by neuroscientists based at the University of Minnesota suggested that rats are capable of feeling regret about their actions. This emotion had never previously been found in any other mammals apart from humans. Researchers set up situations to induce regret, and rats expressed regret through both their behavior and specific neural patterns in brain activity.

H. Stancombe, 'Wedge, John Helder (1793 - 1872)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition John Helder Wedge Wedge was the second son of Charles Wedge of Shudy Camps, of Cambridgeshire, England. John Wedge learned the basics of surveying from his father. Due to financial losses during the post-war depression in agriculture, Wedge and his brother Edward decided to migrate to Van Diemen's Land; before leaving London Wedge had obtained an appointment in the colony as assistant surveyor. Van Diemens Land The brothers arrived in Van Diemen's Land aboard the Heroine on the morning of 15 April 1824. Wedge led several expeditions through heavily timbered and mountainous country in the north-east and central highlands of the island. On one of these journeys Wedge found a camp of the bushrangers led by Matthew Brady. For Wedge's efforts in their capture he was rewarded with a land grant in 1826; later he applied for another grant for the capture of five absconders. Wedge was sent to the far north-west in 1828 to examine the lands of the Van Diemen's Land Company. Wedge reported much rich soil in the heavily timbered area but the Company wanted pasture land immediately available and disputed the accuracy of Wedge's map. Part of Wedge's work included investigating grants surveyed earlier by George Evans and Thomas Scott who were both accused of receiving bribes for measuring more than the authorized area to settlers. Wedge proved that the accusations were well founded. A large expedition was organized by the surveyor-general, George Frankland, in February 1835 to explore the country lying between the Derwent, Gordon and Huon Rivers. Wedge, as leader of one of the parties, proved a resourceful and intelligent bushman, covering much difficult territory. Wedge won Frankland's praise for his efforts in the Survey Department whose staff was overworked. Wedge was keen for promotion and came to believe that his hopes were being frustrated by nepotism at the Colonial Office. In his survey work Wedge had often visited John Batman at Kingston, and together they planned an expedition across Bass Strait. Port Phillip District When Batman returned from his first visit in 1835 Wedge resigned from the Survey Department and crossed to Port Phillip, arriving on 7 August 1835 where he explored along the Barwon River and surveyed the 'acquired' by Batman's Port Phillip Association from the Indigenous Australians. Wedge arrived the site of Melbourne on 2 September 1835, where he discovered members of a party organized by John Pascoe Fawkner. Wedge was against the forceful removal of Fawkner's party by its rivals, and played an important part in the founding of the settlement of Melbourne. Wedge named the Yarra River on 13 September 1835. Wedge was one of the first to bring over sheep from Tasmania, to his station at Werribee. Wedge also reported to Lieutenant-Governor Arthur on the wild white man, William Buckley, whose pardon he recommended, and on outrages against the Aboriginals. Wedge himself committed murder and other atrocities against Aboriginals. While surveying for the government in 1828 Wedge and his men saw an Aboriginal boy watching them from a distance. They pursued him and came across his family of 16 men, women and children. Wedge's men shot one without warning or without any threat. In the panic to get away, the 8-year-old boy fled into a raging sea and was drowned. When the boys body washed ashore, Wedge revived him. Instead of allowing the exhausted and crying child return to his parents, Wedge forced him to go with him. The child got free at one stage and ran, but Wedge pursued him, tied his hands behind his back and took the boy to Launceston. The boy never saw his parents again. Wedge also had a female Aboriginal child in 1831 but she kept running away. In 1847, Wedge led a campaign of prejudice against a government proposal to return Aborigines to mainland Tasmania from the prison camp at Flinders Island. His 'Narrative of an excursion amongst the natives of Port Phillip' and a 'Description of the country around Port Phillip' were among the expedition papers published as a Tasmanian parliamentary paper (1885). The Journal of the Royal Geographical Society (1836) printed Wedge's paper 'On the country around Port Phillip, South Australia'. The diaries of his explorations and survey work were sent to his father in England; the Royal Society of Tasmania published them in 1962. From 1838-43 Wedge visited England; on the death of his father he returned to Tasmania to find his finances reduced by economic depression. In 1843 Wedge married Maria Medland Wills, who had been governess to Bishop Francis Russell Nixon's children, but within a year she died in childbirth. Wedge was then appointed by Nixon from 1846‚Äì51 to manage the farms which formed the endowment of Christ's College at Bishopsbourne. In 1855 Wedge was elected to the district of Morven in Tasmanian Legislative Council. Wedge held office in the short-lived ministry of Thomas Gregson in 1857, as member for North Esk, and initiated the inquiry into the convict department under its comptroller, Stephen Hampton. Wedge was an active Anglican; one of his last acts before withdrawing from parliament in 1868 was to support the commutation bill that granted ¬£100,000 to religious denominations in place of annual state aid. Wedge died on 22 November 1872 at his home Medlands which he had built on the Forth River in 1865. Leighland In or soon after 1824, Wedge was granted a 1500-acre property which he called Leighland,Rebe Taylor, 'The Wedge Collection and the Conundrum of Humane Colonisation', Meanjin (Summer 2017), 34-55 (p. 36).The Diaries of John Helder Wedge, 1824-1835, ed. by Justice Crawford, W.

He subsequently developed the property into a large sheep farm, building a house which was completed between 1830 and 1833. Leighland passed on the death of John Helder Wedge to his nephew Thomas Wedge, and on his death in 1880 eventually went out of the Wedge family, and, following its acquisition by Alfred Youl, has since been in the Youl family.G.

The next season they were promoted another division. On day 1 of championships they received a bronze medal, making the top 15 overall, marking Fallbrook's first time performing in finals in the Scholastic 2A division in the Bren Events Center at UC Irvine. They placed 10th at this event. The Winter Drumline took home gold medals in the Novice division at ADLA Championships in 2015. This school also has three awards winning choirs: The Madrigals, Advanced Vocal Ensemble, and the Warrior Choir. There ratings go from Good to Superior. They have also won judges choice awards. This school also has a drama program that has put on such plays as Shrek the Musical and The Great Gatsby History The school was first opened in 1893 for 20 students. In 1911, the Fallbrook High School board voted for a $20,000 20-year bond for construction of a new high school. In the 1930s, the Public Works Administration Project approved a grant of $34,000, 45% of the cost of a new auditorium-gymnasium-cafeteria, a pool and grading of a sports field. In 1934‚Äì1938, the student body voted on the school colors of red and white. The athletic teams were named \\"The Warriors\\" in honor of the large number of Native-Americans in the student body. In 1939, Fallbrook Union High School was rated the most outstanding high school in the country by Chicago Farm Foundation. In 1946, the State Department of Education rated Fallbrook to be the best small high school in California. In 1948, the State of California declared that the main part of the school building did not meet earthquake standards and was condemned. A new building was built the following year. In 1953, a $325,000 bond was passed to move the school to a site south of town. The 46,000-square-foot project was delayed due to county-wide strikes by brick masons and an unusually rainy year. In 1967, a $900,000 bond was passed to add a cafeteria, classrooms and bus-loading facilities. In 1994, a $23 million bond to improve the facilities and to ease the overcrowding problem was approved by Fallbrook voters. The project included a new gym, performing arts center, agriculture center, media center and vocational arts buildings. Dr. Robert Thomas also retired in 1994 and Joe Diminicantanio was appointed superintendent. Enrollment had reached an all-time record of 2,300 students. Construction began during summer 1996 on the five new buildings. Included are a $3.3 million, 27,000-square-foot gymnasium; $5 million performing arts center; $834,000 agricultural center; $4.5 million media center and a $2 million vocational arts building. The project took almost 6 years to complete with the last building opening in the fall of 2000. The impressive Bob Burton Center for the Performing Arts is a joint community- school facility and is named after Bob Burton, the Student Activities Director of thirty years. In 1997, Diminicantanio retired and Thomas Anthony was appointed as superintendent. As of 2007, the Fallbrook High School campus is home to a wide range of comprehensive high school offerings and is also home to Oasis and Ivy High School. Collectively the campus provides educational facilities for more than 3,000 students. In 2016, district residents approved issuing $45 million in bonds for upgrading classrooms and facilities and improving school security. The initiative was passed by 64.75% of voters. =Student population= * 1893: 20 students * 1934‚Äì1938: 160 students * 1950: 244 students * 1953: 539 students * 1958: 750 students * 1978: 1875 students * 1994: 2300 students * 2007: more than 3000 * 2015‚Äì2016: 2071 studentshttp://www.fuhsd.net/files/user/217/file/SARC%20FHS.pdf  Alma mater  On a group of rolling foothills Stands a building we adore.

Its leading members included Robert Kurz, Roswitha Scholz, Ernst Lohoff, Norbert Trenkle and Claus-Peter Ortlieb. The group published the theoretical journal Krisis : Contribution to a Critique of Commodity Society, and the review Marxist Critique. The Krisis Group also organized seminars and debates, and published articles in different European and South American reviews. Theory and ideology In its magazine, the group proposes a critique of contemporary capitalist society based on a fundamental reinterpretation of Marx's analysis of labor, the commodity, value, and money in Das Kapital. Krisis argues that a distinction exists between an ¬´ exoteric ¬ª and ¬´ esoteric ¬ª analysis of capitalism in Marx‚Äôs writings. Marx‚Äôs \\"exoteric\\" analysis (associated with his early works) is a critique of capitalism from the point of view of labor or the working-class, a point of view which leads inevitably to an emphasis on the struggle between capitalists and laborers, and redistribution of wealth, as the aim of class struggle. Marx‚Äôs \\"esoteric\\" analysis of capitalism, on the other hand, is a critique of the historically specific form that labor and wealth assume in capitalism ‚Äì abstract labor and value. Moreover, it identifies domination in capitalism with these historically determinant forms, rather than with the classes or individuals who appropriate surplus labor and wealth from the laboring classes. In the Manifesto Against Labour, Manifesto against Labour. Krisis- Group, 31 December 1999. Krisis argues against the traditional Marxist notion of class struggle as the motor of history. According to Krisis, there is no class-subject. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is not a struggle between a revolutionary class and its oppressor, but rather a struggle between two opposed interests that are integral to capitalism and form a single \\"labor camp\\". Contrary to traditional Marxism, then, Krisis asserts that the struggle against capitalism is not the struggle for the liberation of labor, but rather a struggle for liberation from labor.https://www.exit-online.org/pdf/manifest_danish.pdf Exit Online, Manifest] Krisis division In 2004 the Krisis Group split, and the members Robert Kurz and Roswitha Scholz together with several members of the editorial staff formed the Exit! group.

The scheme includes four dams and two weirs, and a gravity-fed canal system that feeds into a large storage reservoir to provide water to the Macarthur and Illawarra regions, the Wollondilly Shire, and metropolitan Sydney. The four dams and associated infrastructure are individually listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.  History  By 1867, Sydney was outgrowing the water supply available from Botany Swamps and the Governor (Sir John Young) appointed a Commission to recommend a future water supply. In 1869, the Commission recommended the Upper Nepean Scheme. This comprised weirs on the Cataract and Nepean rivers, a storage reservoir at Prospect and of pipelines, tunnels, canals and aqueducts to bring water from the catchment area to Sydney. Work on the Scheme began in 1880 and was completed in 1888. The Scheme was a significant feat of engineering at the time of construction. In June 1885 Sydney was in the grip of a severe drought and the Upper Nepean Scheme was incomplete. The Government accepted an offer from Hudson Brothers to bridge the gaps and deliver of water per day into Botany Swamps. Duplicating the entire length of the half built permanent scheme this became known as Hudsons' Temporary Scheme and was turned into the swamps on 30 January 1886. This emergency work was dismantled as the main scheme was completed. As originally built, the Upper Nepean Scheme was capable of supporting an estimated population of 540,000. By 1902, Sydney had a population of 523,000 and was again in the grip of a severe drought. A Royal Commission appointed to report on Sydney's water supply recommended a dam on the Cataract River and construction commenced in the same year. Dams were subsequently built on each of the Cordeaux, Avon and Nepean rivers, with the last being completed in 1935. Each dam includes a public picnic area. In total, the four dams hold and can safely provide per day. The Scheme is now managed by the Sydney Catchment Authority. Further supplementary water supply is provided by a feed from the Shoalhaven Scheme through various pumps, pipes, cuts and diversions. Associated dams =Cataract Dam= The Cataract Dam is a heritage-listed gravity dam with an unlined side spillway extending from the left abutment. It is tall, long and holds of water. Cataract Dam was the first dam built in the Upper Nepean Scheme, it was also first dam in Australia to use pre-cast moulded concrete blocks for the upstream face of the dam. The core of the dam consists of large sandstone blocks, quarried onsite and cemented together. The downstream face is of mass poured basalt concrete, with a basalt facing. A readily accessible source of suitable rock was located some distance away at Sherbrooke, also known as Ferndale, situated near the top of Bulli Pass. To transport the basalt from the quarry to the dam construction site, a gauge steam tramway, long, was constructed. Dam construction began in 1902 and was completed in 1907, and the spillway was widened in 1915. Ernest Macartney de Burgh was the supervising engineer for the project from 1904. Poet Banjo Paterson wrote a satirical ballad \\"The Dam that Keele Built\\" about the politics behind the construction of Cataract Dam. =Cordeaux Dam= The Cordeaux Dam is a heritage-listed arch dam across the Cordeaux River with an unlined side spillway on the left abutment. It is high, long and creates a reservoir which holds . Construction began in 1918 and was completed in 1926 at a cost of A¬£945,000. The wall consists of large sandstone blocks, quarried onsite and cemented together, faced with a combination of bluestone and sandstone concrete. The dam featured a number of improvements in design and construction on the earlier-completed Cataract Dam. These included contraction joints between units of construction placed at intervals of ; inspection galleries at upper and lower levels, together with piping for registering any ground water pressure. The blue metal used in the construction of the dam was supplied from the Government Quarries at Kiama and brought by rail to Douglas Park. From here it was conveyed by aerial ropeway across the Nepean Gorge to an interchange on the eastern side where the material was transferred to a gauge steam tramway to a point adjacent to the dam site. =Avon Dam= The Avon Dam is a heritage-listed arch dam across the Avon River; it is tall, long and its reservoir holds . It has the largest capacity of all the dams in the Scheme. Construction of the heritage-listed dam wall began in 1921 and was completed in 1927 at a cost of A¬£1,047,000. The dam construction and materials are the same as Cordeaux. All materials for construction were transported from Bargo railway station on a specially built road, all the other dams in the scheme used rail transport. There were some light tramways constructed at the dam site, however it would appear that no locomotives were employed; skips and other items being moved by winch, horse or manpower. =Nepean Dam= The Nepean Dam is a heritage-listed arch dam across the Nepean River; it is tall and long. Construction on the Dam began in 1926, construction was delayed for two years during the Depression, it was finally completed in 1935. The capacity is listed variously as . The Nepean Reservoir has a small storage capacity in relation to its large catchment area of . While its capacity is much the same as that of Cataract and Cordeaux Reservoirs, its catchment basin is two and a half times as extensive as Cataract and three and a half times as extensive as Cordeaux. The Nepean Reservoir therefore fills more rapidly and, under normal conditions, is drawn upon more freely than the other reservoirs. The dam is located at an elevation of above sea level and the construction cost was A¬£2,062,000. Railway sidings were established on the Main Southern railway line at a point between Bargo and Yerrinbool. Transport to the dam site was again by light railway, on this occasion of standard gauge. This avoided transhipment from the Government vehicles bringing materials from large commercial quarries, effectively making the line an extended privately owned siding. The line was long through gentle countryside. Trains were worked by a variety of locomotives, including a former Sydney Steam Tram Motor. Additionally, there was a system of narrow () gauge lines in use at the dam construction site. Additional work was carried out on the spillway between 1943 and 1947 to prevent scouring of the dam foundations.

It seeks valid, reliable understanding of how we as humans have interacted with the environment and how these intricate relationships have been sustained over time. The \\"ethno\\" (see ethnology) prefix in ethnoecology indicates a localized study of a people, and in conjunction with ecology, signifies people's understanding and experience of environments around them. Ecology is the study of the interactions between living organisms and their environment; enthnoecology applies a human focused approach to this subject. The development of the field lies in applying indigenous knowledge of botany and placing it in a global context.  History  Ethnoecology began with some of the early works of Dr. Hugh Popenoe, an agronomist and tropical soil scientist who has worked with the University of Florida, the National Science Foundation, and the National Research Council. Popenoe has also worked with Dr Harold Conklin, a cognitive anthropologist who did extensive linguistic and ethnoecological research in Southeast Asia. [citation needed] In his 1954 dissertation \\"The Relation of the Hanunoo Culture to the Plant World\\", Harold Conklin coined the term ethnoecology when he described his approach as \\"ethnoecological\\". After earning his PhD, he began teaching at Columbia University while continuing his research among the Hanunoo. In 1955, Conklin published one of his first ethnoecological studies. His \\"Hanunoo Color Categories\\" study helped scholars understand the relationship between classification systems and conceptualization of the world within cultures. In this experiment, Conklin discovered that people in various cultures recognize colors differently due to their unique classification system. Within his results he found that the Hanunoo uses two levels of colors. The first level consists of four basic terms of colors:; darkness, lightness, redness, and greenness. While, the second level was more abstract and consisted of hundreds of color classifications such as: texture, shininess, and moisture of objects also were used to classify objects. Other anthropologists had a hard time understanding this color classification system because they often applied their own idea of color criteria to those of the Hanunoo. Conklin's studies were not only the breakthrough of ethnoecology, but they also helped develop the idea that other cultures conceptualize the world in their own terms, which helped to reduce ethnocentric views of those in western cultures. Other scholars such as Berlin, Breedlove, and Raven endeavored to learn more about other systems of environment classifications and to compare them to Western scientific taxonomies. Principles Ethnoscience emphasizes the importance of how societies make sense of their own reality. In order to understand how cultures perceive the world around them, like the classification and organization of the environment, ethnoecology borrows methods from linguistics and cultural anthropology. Ethnoecology is a major part of an anthropologist‚Äôs toolkit; it helps researchers understand how the society conceptualizes their surrounding environment i and that it can determine what the society considers \\"worth attending to\\" in their ecological system. This information can ultimately be useful for other approaches used in environmental anthropology. Ethnoecology is a field of environmental anthropology, and has derived much of its characteristics from classic as well as more modern theorists. Franz Boas was one of the first anthropologists to question unilineal evolution, the belief that all societies follow the same, unavoidable path towards Western civilization. Boas strongly urged anthropologists to gather detailed ethnographic data from an emic standpoint in order to understand different cultures. Julian Steward was another anthropologist whose ideas and theories influenced the use of ethnoecology. Steward coined the term cultural ecology, the study of human adaptations to social and physical environments, and focused on how evolutionary paths in similar societies result in different trajectories instead of the classic global trends in evolution. This new perspective on cultural evolution was later named multilineal evolution. Both Boas and Steward believed that a researcher must use an emic standpoint and that cultural adaptation to an environment is not the same for each society. Furthermore, Steward's cultural ecology provides an important theoretical antecedent for ethnoecology. Another contributor to the framework of ethnoecology was anthropologist Leslie White. White emphasized the interpretation of cultures as systems and laid the foundations for interpreting the intersection of cultural systems with ecosystems as well as their integration into a coherent whole. Altogether, these anthropologists, established the foundations of ethnoecology we see today.  Traditional ecological knowledge  Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), also known as Indigenous Knowledge, \\"refers to the evolving knowledge acquired by indigenous and local peoples over hundreds or thousands of years through direct contact with the environment.\\" It involves the accumulated knowledge, beliefs, and practices widely held by a specific community through their relationship with the environment. In this context, TEK consists of a community‚Äôs shared ideas when considering subjects such as the acceptable uses of plants and animals, the best approach to maximizing the potential uses of land, the social institutions in which members of society are expected to navigate, and holistically, their worldview. The study of TEK frequently includes critiques of the theoretical division between cultural systems and ecosystems, interpreting humans as an integral part of the whole. Humans, for example, can represent a keystone species in a given ecosystem and can play critical roles in creating, maintaining, and sustaining it . They can contribute to processes such as pedogenesis, seed dispersal, and fluctuations in biodiversity. They can also modify and condition animal behavior in either wild or domesticated species. Traditional Ecological Knowledge has traditionally focused on what Western science can learn from these communities and how closely their cultural knowledge mirrors scientific structures. It has been argued that this previous understanding of ecological adaptation could have major influences on our ecological actions in the future. Local knowledge in western society Within the discipline of Ethnoecology, there is a clear emphasis on those societies that are deemed \\"indigenous,\\" \\"traditional,\\" or \\"savage,\\" a common trend in anthropological pursuits through the 20th century. However, societies exist within a wide range of biomes, and have needs to know and understand clear and present dangers beyond those of harmful plants or how to get the best crop. Cruikshank contends that this may because many see Traditional Ecological Knowledge as a \\"static, timeless, and hermetically sealed\\" notion. Locked within time and space, there is no opportunity to innovate, and is therefore not found within the very new structures of a post-industrial society, such as that of the United States. In this way, ethnoecologies may exist without the bounded notion of the other. For example, social scientists have attempted to understand the markers inner-city youth use to identify a threat to their livelihood, including the wearing of gang colors, tattoos, or protrusions through clothes that may represent or be a weapon. Likewise, concepts are spread about the health and needs of the community as they are related to the area around them. Instilled with recognizing dangers at an early age, and who these threats come from, a set of beliefs are held by the members of the society on how to live in their country, city, or neighborhood. This broadening of the discipline (bordering on human ecology) is important because it identifies the environment as not just the plants and animals, but also the humans and technologies a group of people have access to. Similarly, social scientists have begun to use ethnoecological surveys in ethnographic studies in attempts to understand and address topics relevant in Western society as well as prevalent around the world. This includes researching the ways in which people view their choices and abilities in manipulating the world around them, especially in their ability to subsist.  Traditional Medicine  Traditional societies often treat medical issues through the utilization of their local environment. For example, in Chinese herbal medicine people consider how to utilize native plants for healing. Almost 80% of the world‚Äôs population utilizes ethnobotanical methods as a main source of treatment for illnesses, according to WHO. In the face of modern climate change, many traditional medicinal practices have been promoted for their environmental sustainability, such as Ayurveda from India. Epistemological concerns According to Dove and Carpenter, \\"environmental anthropology sits astride the dichotomy between nature and culture, a conceptual separation between categories of nature, like wilderness and parks, and those of culture, like farms and cities.\\". It is inherent in this ideology that humans are a polluting factor violating a previously pristine locale. This is especially relevant due to the role in which scientists have long understood how humans have worked for and against their environmental surroundings as a whole. In this way, the idea of a corresponding, but not adversarial, relationship between society and culture was once in itself baffling and defiant to the generally accepted modes of understanding in the earlier half of the twentieth century. As time went on, the understood dichotomy of nature and culture continued to be challenged by ethnographers such as Darrell A. Posey, John Eddins, Peter Macbeth and Debbie Myers. Also present in the recognition of indigenous knowledge in the intersection of Western science is the way in which it is incorporated, if at all. Dove and Carpenter contend that some anthropologists have sought to reconcile the two through a \\"translation,\\" bringing the ethnological understandings and framing them in a modern dialogue. In opposition to this paradigm is an attribution to the linguistic and ideological distinctiveness found in the nomenclature and epistemologies. This alone has created a subfield, mostly in recognition of the philosophies in ethnotaxonomy. To define ethnotaxonomy as new or different though, is inaccurate. It is simply placing a different understanding of a long-held tradition in ethnology, discovering the terms in which different peoples use to describe their world and worldviews. It is worth noting that those who seek to use and understand this knowledge have actively worked to both enfranchise and disenfranchise the societies in which the information was held. Haenn has noted that in several instances of working with conservationists and developers, there was a concerted effort to change the ideas of environment and ecology held by the native groups to the land, while plundering any and all texts and information on the resources found there, therefore enabling a resettlement of the land and redistribution of the knowledge, favoring the outsiders.

It is one of four dams and weirs in the catchment of the Upper Nepean Scheme. Completed in 1907 under the supervision of Ernest Macartney de Burgh, the dam is currently owned by Water NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The dam was listed on the NSW State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999. Structural details A gravity dam with an unlined side spillway extending from the left abutment, it is tall; long; and it holds of water. Cataract Dam was the first dam built in the Upper Nepean Scheme. It was also first dam in Australia to use pre-cast moulded concrete blocks for the upstream face of the dam. The downstream face is of mass poured basalt concrete, with a basalt facing. A readily accessible source of suitable rock was located at Sherbrooke, situated near the top of Bulli Pass. To transport the basalt from the quarry to the dam construction site, a gauge steam tramway, long, was constructed. The dam is built of cyclopean masonry, composed of sandstone blocks weighing from . These were quarried at the site and bedded in cement mortar. The vertical joints were filled with basalt or sandstone concrete. The upstream face consisted of basalt concrete moulded blocks set in a cement mortar. The downstream face was of basalt concrete, thick in the lower section and thick in the upper section. There were two lines of diameter pipes which passed through the dam and discharged water into the Nepean River. The flow is controlled by a Larner Johnson needle valve. The dam wall was given a decorative finish. The upstream parapet was castellated with sandstone blocks while the top of the downstream wall was corbelled in concrete. In approximately the midsection of the dam stands the valve house. This is finished in quarried sandstone blocks with ashlar coursing. It features a steeply pitched slate-covered pipped roof topped with finials and gables at either side. Dam construction began in 1902 and was completed in 1907, and the spillway was widened in 1915. E. M. de Burgh was the supervising engineer for the project from 1904. History The Upper Nepean Scheme was commenced in 1880 after it was realised that the Botany Swamps scheme was insufficient to meet Sydney's water supply needs. The Nepean project consisted of the construction of a weir across the Nepean River to divert of the rivers Cataract, Cordeaux, Avon and Nepean, to the Prospect Reservoir. The design and construction of Cataract Dam was undertaken by the Water Supply and Sewerage Branch and Harbour and Rivers Branch of the New South Wales Public Works Department. The construction of the dam necessitated the knowledge and experience of a number of engineers employed in the branches at the time including Cecil Darley (NSW Inspecting Engineer in London), Leslie Wade (Principal Engineer, Water Supply and Sewerage Branch), Henry Dare and Ernest M. de Burgh (Supervising Engineers). The successful completion of the dam and its continuation of use as a water supply dam are a lasting testament to the professional capabilities of the late Victorian/Edwardian era generation of engineers of the Public Works Department. The association of Thomas Keele with the initial dam proposal, and the subsequent problems associated with the cost and the ongoing Royal Commissions into the project was immortalised through Banjo Paterson's satirical ballad The Dam that Keele Built. =Appin= Appin town's name came about, despite that most local settlers came from Irish stock, due to Governor Macquarie's arrival in the colony in 1810. At the time, Government House was in Parramatta and one of Macquarie's first intentions was to travel into the nearby country to discover the best land from which the colony could be provided with food. It was already known that the most productive area for that purpose was the Hawkesbury River country, but these districts had proven precarious because of severe flooding which caused great losses in crops and stock.Percival, 1992, 7 The land Macquarie intended to study lay between the Nepean and Georges Rivers. There had been no identification of the land which ran as far south as the Cataract River and was bounded on the west by the Nepean River and on the east by the Georges River. On completion of his survey, this area reminded him so much of his own (home) district in Scotland that he called it the Airds district. Some time later he named the section south, including Mount Gilead, Appin. One of the earliest buildings in the town, still standing, is the Anglican school, where the first generation of children born in Appin received their education. This was erected about 1815. Macquarie gave many grants of land in order to develop the land. The first was granted to Sydney magistrate and acting commissary-general, William Broughton. There were several other grants of smaller amounts, made on condition that after five years, unless sufficient progress had been made in cropping and stocking, the land would revert to the Crown. The district became a great supplier of wheat, corn and barley, carried to Sydney by wagons pulled by teams of bullocks or horses.Percival, 1992, 8 The northern boundary of the Appin district is the property known as Mount Gilead, which was granted to Reuben Uther. Some years later it was purchased by a Sydney businessman, Thomas Rose, who was credited with building the first dam for water conservation in the colony (here). This was carried out very thoroughly and with great expense. He was generous with the water conserved and allowed his neighbours to water their stock in very dry times. He applied to the Governor for some reimbursement, but was refused. This dam was built in 1824. In 1836 Rose built the huge stone windmill, one of the largest of its kind which gave great service for many years grinding wheat of the surrounding areas. In those early years, in a good season, yields in some areas were as high as 45 bushels to the acre. The windmill is still standing; that is the four-storey tower which has long been converted to a water tank; but the top hammer and sails have long-since disappeared.Percival, 1992, 27 On the southern side, Mount Gilead was joined by the Hume (family) properties, Beulan and Meadowvale (formerly Rockwood). These and others such as Fairview, Blossom Lodge, Mount Carlon and the big poultry farm conducted by Ingham enterprises are all on the western side of the Appin Road. Opposite the last property is one known as Kildare, one of the pioneer homes of the Irish Dwyer family. Further west was Lesson's Green, an grant to William Crowe, the northern boundary of which joined a grant to John Dwyer, which in turn joined Macquarie Dale, a second grant of made to William Broughton in 1816, which ran as far (west) as the Nepean River. South of this is the property of Elladale, of granted to Alexander Riley in 1812, the boundary to Macquarie Dale (of which) is Elladale Creek. This was later greatly reduced in size by subdivisions and sales. By about 1840, when purchased by Rev. Sparling, the first incumbent at St. Mark's Anglican Church in Appin, it had shrunk to .Percival, 1992, 9 On its southern boundary, it was joined by Broughton's Lachlan Vale (the first land grant in the areaPercival, 1992, 12). That property in turn joined John Kennedy's original grant, that he named Teston. In later years, different owners added to it, growing the property to over . This acreage on the south side joined the area known as Mount Brittain of , a grant to William Sykes. With further grants it became over .Percival, 1992, 10 Further south, Mount Brittain joined a grant to James Jordan, the southern boundary being the Cataract River and here was the place known as Jordan's Crossing, where the road from Mount Keira (now Picton Road) crossed the river. There were a number of small grants on the way back to Appin such as those of John Firth, Edward McGee, John Trotter, Nicholas Bryan and Matthew Pearce () and several others. Laurence D'Arcy was also granted joining Jordan's and named it Spring Valley. Other grantees were James Byrne () and Andrew Byrne who had a grant between what is now Ingham enterprises and John Anderson's property that he named Ousedale, the creek that ran through it still bearing this name. A number of the small grants were brought together by purchase and the well-known property of Windmill Hill came into being, owned by William Larkin. This name was given to it because Larkin built a timber windmill on the highest part of it (about the mid-1840s) and it gave great service for many years. The farm later became the property of the Winton family who ran it as a dairy farm until recent years.Percival, 1992, 10-11 Appin has two solidly-built stone churches, St. Bede's Roman Catholic and St. Mark's Anglican. Both were built about the same time, 1840‚Äì41 and have stood the test of time. Both are equipped with very good bells.Percival, 1992, 26 The population of Appin was quite large: in 1825 the number was 562. A large number of farmers were engaged in wheat, barley, corn and vegetable growing for the Sydney market. =Upper Nepean Scheme= The Upper Nepean Scheme was commenced in 1880 after it was realised that the Botany scheme was insufficient to meet Sydney's water supply needs. The scheme was estimated to be capable of supplying the needs of a population up to 540,000. In 1902, a severe drought caused the water in Prospect Reservoir to fall below gravitational flow to the Lower Canal, resulting in a serious water shortage for Sydney's 523,000 inhabitants. The seriousness of the position led the NSW Government, in March 1902, to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into and report upon the Sydney water supply system. The main recommendation of the Commission was that a storage dam be constructed at a point below the junction of Cataract Creek with the Cataract River. The site was selected as a result of a joint investigation and survey by the staff of the Public Works Department and the Water Board. The survey reports proposed the construction of a dam capable of impounding approximately 7000 million gallons of water, with the option of raising the walls at some future time to allow for the catchment of up to . The Act authorising the construction of the dam was passed in 1902 and provided for a wall of with a storage capacity of . By June 1903, much of the area to be submerged had been cleared of timber, with excavations for the foundations having begun by the end of the year. The contract for the work was let to Messrs Lane and Peters and, by 1905, was well underway with a completion date expected within two years. The contract was for a dam high from the natural flow of the river, which would store up to . During construction, the Minister for Public Works, in a measure of economy, directed that the dam wall be reduced in height by thereby reducing the storage capacity from . The Board however, acting on advice of its President, urged the Minister to have the dam built to its original dimensions. This request was then forwarded to a Royal Commission which, after a full investigation, recommended that the dam be built to its full height and capacity. The work proceeded on this basis and was completed toward the end of 1907 for a total cost of $658,272 and was transferred to the Board on 10 June 1908. The reservoir was filled to capacity for the first time on 13 January 1911, at which time it became obvious that the spillway should be widened to avoid any risk of flood waters overtopping the wall. This work was completed in 1915. In December 2016 the state government gave approval for the controversial South 32 Dendrobium coal mine, in the Metropolitan Special Area, created to protect the waters of Cataract, Cordeaux, Avon and Nepean Reservoirs.Hannam, 2016, 14  Description  The Cataract Dam is built of cyclopean masonry composed of sandstone blocks, weighing from , quarried at the site and bedded in a cement mortar. The vertical joints were filled with basalt or sandstone concrete. The upstream face consisted of basalt concrete moulded blocks set in a cement mortar. The downstream face was of basalt concrete, thick in the lower section and thick in the upper levels. There were two lines of diameter pipes which passed through the dam and discharged water into the river. The flow is now controlled by an AGE Ring Faulkner valve. There is also a Ring Faulkner Gate Valve and a Fixed Crane Dispersion Valve. The dam wall was given a decorative finish. The upstream parapet was castellated with sandstone blocks, whilst the top of the downstream wall was corbelled in concrete. Near the centre of the dam wall stands the valve house, finished in sandstone ashlar masonry. It has a slate clad, hipped roof featuring ridgecap finials and with parapet gable ends on the north and south sides and segmental arched parapets on the east and west sides. Specifications for Cataract Dam: *Date of construction: 1902 - 1907. *Masonry in wall and spillway: . *Length of dam: . *Length of bywash: . *Width at base: . *Width at crest: . *Greatest depth of water: . *Full supply level: . *Area of lake: . *Capacity: . The water from Cataract Dam is discharged as required into the Cataract River downstream to Broughton's Pass. There it is diverted by another weir into Cataract Tunnel, long, (the first structure of the Upper Canal) by which it is conveyed to Prospect Reservoir. Associated with the Dam is the Cataract Dam Official Quarters, situated close to the dam wall at the northern end. This single-storey, Federation Queen Anne style house was built in 1910 for the use of Water Board staff during construction of the dam. It is built of ashlar sandstone masonry quarried on the site and features a verandah at the front with elaborate timber posts with curved quadrant brackets, a vertical slatted balustrade and pediment gable over the main entrance way. When built, the house contained a board room, offices, four bedrooms and a kitchen. Over the years, it has provided accommodation for inspecting officers and important visitors. It is still used by SCA and can now provide sleeping accommodation for twelve people. It is open to the public for holiday rental. The gardens around the house are landscaped lawns with garden beds edged with sandstone. Also made of sandstone is a detached garage, refurbished and converted to a conference hall. There are two amenity blocks, also of sandstone masonry featuring castellated parapets and a tennis court stands at the rear of the lawn. Surrounding the garden is a castellated sandstone fence with decorative entrance posts. A further three sandstone cottages are located to the east of the Dam. These staff cottages were built to identical designs with minor detail differences and have corrugated-iron clad, multi-gabled roofs. There is a substantial brick house dating from the 1950s/60s located between the cottages and the Official Quarters, which is single-storied with a terracotta tiled hipped and gabled roof. It is a simple bungalow form with timber casement and sash windows and has a separate garage with attached living quarters at the rear of the main building. The public area surrounding the dam is maintained and a large picnic area, shelter sheds, fireplaces and playground area are provided amongst attractive gardens. The site contains many intact elements of the early 20th century landscape design scheme (1910s-1920s?): walling; ornamental gardens (layout and plantings - including Cryptomeria, Stenocarpus, Cupressus, Pinus, Podocarpus, Liquidamber, Jacaranda and Phoenix); structures, especially those echoing aspects of the dam wall parapet construction (e.g. castellated walling elsewhere on site and gate piers); various residences & associated gardens; garden structures such as the cement faux-log bridge near the dam wall; various sculpted cement grottoes; and propagation structures doubling as bushhouses and/or greenhouses. In the broader landscape context, the visual catchment associated with the site is extensive and scenically impressive. The Conservation Management Plan outlines the key elements and their individual significance assessments. = Condition = As at 21 January 2009, the condition of the dam is good. The Cataract Dam has a very high level of integrity, with most of its original staff residential cottages and the Official Residence. Many elements of the original landscaping of the site are still apparent however the richness and detail of the original garden plantings have been lost over the last few decades. = Modifications and dates = *1940 - Torpedo Booms were installed. *1962 - The Upper Valve House was rebuilt. *1987 - Wall strengthened by installation of post-tensioned anchors. *The original Larner Johnson Needle Valve has been replaced with an AGE Ring Faulkner Valve. *Spillway and dam upgraded for dam safety purposes in 1981 and 1989. = Further information = Cataract Dam is located in Wollondilly and Wollongong LGAs. Heritage listing As at 21 January 2009, Cataract Dam was the first of the four water supply dams built as part of the development of the Upper Nepean Water Supply Scheme, one of the most important engineering works and items of public infrastructure in Australia. Cataract Dam was designed by engineers of the Public Works Department under direction of two of Australia's leading water supply engineers, L.A.B. Wade, Chief Engineer for Water Supply and Sewerage and E.M. De Burgh, who was Supervising Engineer. The completion of Cataract Dam was a significant step in the continuing process of providing a reliable water supply for Sydney and surrounding areas and was part of a process of development of the Upper Nepean Scheme which was envisaged when that Scheme was designed in the 1880s. Cataract Dam was the largest dam constructed in NSW at the time and was considered to be a significant work of engineering in its day. It continues to play an important role as a major source of water supply for the Sydney area. Additionally, the Cataract Dam is a handsome, well proportioned structure with strong Tudor style architectural character which complements the monumental nature of the structure and its attractive natural surroundings. Cataract Dam includes a range of ancillary structures which form components of the overall site, including a set of handsome sandstone masonry residential cottages for operational staff (which appear to date from the construction of the dam). They are representative of their age and type. The Official Quarters is a particularly fine example of a Federation Queen Anne Bungalow, with matching outbuildings and landscaped gardens and is associated with the accommodation of both the senior engineers of the Public Works Department and the Governor of NSW at the opening of the Dam. The Residential Engineers Cottage is also a fine quality building dating from the 1960s. The Dam surrounds include remnants of its early 20th century gardens, evidence of a high level of landscape design awareness through its planning and detailing, and extensive areas of bushland. Individual components of its remnant gardens, such as its main (upper level) grotto shelter and ornamental follies, are rare in NSW on account of their imaginative conception and quality of craftsmanship. The extensive scale of the remnant area of public parklands is notable and that they continue to attract regular visitation since their opening indicates that the place is highly regarded. The immediate environment around the dam wall - including the key engineering structures and associated architecture, the upstream body of water, the downstream gorge and surrounding vegetation - forms a localised cultural landscape of scenic distinction. Cataract Dam was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Cataract Dam is located within the Upper Nepean Catchment Area which has developed with the completion of the Cataract and Nepean tunnels in 1888 as the fourth source of water supply for Sydney. The potential of the Upper Nepean Catchment Area to supply water was fully developed through the construction of four major dams between 1903 and 1936. Cataract Dam is the first of these dams to have been completed. The Upper Nepean Catchment Area continues to supply the regions of Sydney and the Illawarra, with Cataract Dam providing a supply to the Sydney Region. Cataract Dam was the first of the major water supply dams constructed in NSW. The completion of the dam necessitated the introduction of methods of construction hitherto unseen in NSW in regard to dam engineering. The practices of construction developed at Cataract Dam set the pattern for the completion of all subsequent dams in NSW up to the late 1940s. Up until the completion of Cordeaux Dam in 1926, the impounded water of Cataract Dam provided the main reserve source of water for domestic and industrial consumption in metropolitan Sydney, the largest city in NSW. In providing water for metropolitan Sydney during this era the dam, in ensuring security of supply, contributed to the extensive residential, commercial and industrial development of Sydney during the first decades of the twentieth century. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The design and construction of Cataract Dam was undertaken by the Water Supply and Sewerage Branch and Harbour and Rivers Branch of the NSW Public Works Department. The construction of the dam necessitated the dedication of the knowledge and experience of a number of the engineers employed in the branches at the time including Cecil W. Darley (NSW inspecting engineer in London), Leslie A.B. Wade (principal engineer - Water Supply and Sewerage Branch), Henry H. Dare and Ernest de Burgh (supervising engineers). The successful completion of the dam and its continuation of use as a water supply dam are lasting testament to the professional capabilities of the late Victorian/Edwardian era generation of engineers in the Public Works Department. The association of Thomas W. Keele with the initial dam proposal, and the subsequent problems associated with the cost and the ongoing Royal Commissions into the project was immortalised through Banjo Patterson's poem \\"The Dam that Keele Built\\". The Manor was purpose built in 1910 as the quasi-private domain of the Board members of the Water Board. The building and its grounds have particular associations with past identities of the Board. The island and the inlets of Lake Cataract are associated with past identities of the Water Board through memorialisation of their surnames. A well known example is Keele Island named after Thomas William Keele, the president of the former Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage at the time of the dam's construction. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The wall of Cataract Dam is an engineering work imbued with a sense of high aesthetic values expressed through a well proportioned high and straight wall set within the gorge of the Cataract River. The design and finishes of the crest house, albeit substantially reconstructed c.1953, parapet and abutments were undertaken by the Government's Architect Branch of the Department of Public Works, at the time under Walter Liberty Vernon. It exhibits stylistic traits which evoke the era of its construction and impart a park-like appearance to the dam. The Manor, completed in 1910, is dramatically set within the platform of the cableway and quarry used in the construction of the dam. The sense of elevation and axial relationship to the wall is accentuated by the adjoining drive which is flanked by an avenueof Phoenix palms and Jacranda and the flight of concrete and stone steps which provide the principal means of access to the wall. There is a high level of design awareness in the planning of the grounds and the association with the Botanic Gardens in the layout and selection of species is of considerable note. The Manor, which is constructed in stone and finished internally to a very high standard, is complemented by four near contemporary stone workmen's family cottages and a 1920s brick resident officer's residence which are equally designed and finished to a high quality. The dam is set within the valley of the Cataract River: upstream of the dam wall there is a substantial area of native bushland characterised by the broad expanse of the pool of water bordered by the crests of the valley sides and Keele Island. Downstream of the dam wall the setting is characterised by the steeper inclines that graduate into the gorge created by the river's flow over time. The topography in times of high water level imparts a picturesque scene viewed from selective vantage points above and on the dam wall. The adjoining hill of approach to the dam is laid-out with a plantation of Monterey Pines, which in juxtaposition with the paths, drives, culverts, steps and cottages impart a parklike setting. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The dam and grounds are recognised by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) as being a place which is part of the cultural environment of Australia, which has aesthetic, historical, architectural, archaeological, scientific and social significance for future generations, as well as for the present community of NSW. The dam and grounds are recognised by the Heritage Council of NSW as a place which is of significance to NSW in relation to its historical, scientific, cultural, social, archeological, natural and aesthetic values. The dam wall is recognised as an engineering feat of national significance by the Institute of the Engineers of Australia. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The grounds of the dam contain a yard of valves removed from Cataract and Woronora Dams, and items of plant and machinery used during the construction and maintenance of the Upper Canal. The hillside overlooking the dam was the site of the original construction village and retains steps and engravings cut within the rock outcrops dating from this era. The cyclopean masonry of the dam is a unique example of this type of gravity dam construction and demonstrates the principal characteristics of this technology. The lower valve house completed in 1907and extended in 1913 is a unique early example of its type and demonstrates the principal characteristics of the design of such structures. The water supply system completed in 1907 retains it gallery and rising main chamber in the dam wall, which demonstrate the principal characteristics of the design of such a delivery system. The grounds of the dam retain numerous tree plantings undertaken from the time of the completion of the dam and Manor in 1910. Collectively the diversity of these trees are an invaluable record of past horticultural practices. Terraces and platforms adjoining the dam abutments demarcate the location of plant used in the construction of the dam, in particular the location of the cableway head tower. The submerged basin of the reservoir is likely to retain remnant plant and equipment used in the construction of the dam, such as cuttings and terraces of the tramway. The site of the dam retains a number of known archeological sites which are associated with dam construction and later upgrading of the spillway. These sites include a large curved masonry dam on a tributary of Cataract Creek of the Appin/Bulli Road, a potential stone quarry, the formation of a roadway adjacent to the road of access, powder magazines on Keele Island and on the adjoining west abutment of the dam wall, and fireplaces, horse yard drains and powder magazines on the abutment adjoining the spillway. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Cataract Dam was the first major dam situated within a large water supply catchment area constructed in NSW. Cataract Dam is the oldest large cyclopean masonry dam constructed in Australia, and is believed to have been the largest works of its kind at the time of completion in the Southern Hemisphere. The straight cyclopean masonry wall is unique within the context of other large cyclopean masonry dams constructed in NSW. The lower valve house (completed in stages up to 1915) is the earliest and largest structure of its type constructed in NSW. The screen tower (completed in 1907) is the earliest structure of its type constructed in NSW, and includes unique water intake system. The crest house and valve tower retain unique penstock gate and operating gear (capstan, connecting shafts and gate) unique examples of this type of machinery of NSW. The terraces used in construction of the dam represent the first of their type in NSW and are associated with a number of technological innovations such as the first cableway used in NSW. The plant and equipment used in the construction was electrically driven, which was unique in NSW in regard to the date, extent of the installation and remoteness. The dam retains items of ironwork which are part of the original water delivery system, which are unique in NSW in regard to this date. The building of the dam represents a unique episode in the history of NSW in being the subject of a number of Royal Commissions made into the building and cost of the project. The Commissions are likely to have influenced the method of construction of later dams. The latter stages of the construction of Cataract Dam was completed by the contractors Lane and Peters. Cataract Dam is the only cyclopean masonry dam designed by the Public Works Department but completed under contract. Cataract Dam is arguably the most decorative of all the major dams constructed in NSW in regards to its high standard of rusticated stone finishes on the crest wall, abutments and crest house, the ashlar pattern imparted by the precast concrete blocks on the straight upstream face of the wall, the unadorned functionality of the concrete facing to the inclined downstream face and lower valve house, and the setting of the high straight wall within the landscape of the Cataract River gorge. The crest house and complementary elements such as the articulated arches on the crest wall, in their innate sense of scale and composition, rank with the best of all public works in NSW undertaken in the Federation era. The site of the construction township situated within the grounds of the picnic area and maintenance men's cottages was the first large temporary camp established for the construction of a dam in NSW. The Board's former official quarters and surrounds are unique within the context of dams on NSW and rare within the context of other government institutions of the federation era. The four stone workmen's cottages constructed in 1912, and the 1929 brick officer-in-charge's residence, consciously sited on the hillside overlooking the dam wall, impart a village-like appearance which is unique within the context of dams in NSW. The four stone maintenance men cottages are likely to be rare, within the context of a non-urban environment, Federation era example of model working men's houses. The grounds of the dam contain an early 36 inch (0.9) diameter gate valve (manufacture not known) which was used to regulate the outlet flow of water which is considered the only extant example of such a valve in NSW. The upgrading works to the spillway and dam between 1981 and 1989 to make the dam meet modern day safety requirements were undertaken in consideration of the unique heritage significance of the dam in NSW ensuring no visual impact on the dam, a milestone in remedial engineering works on this scale. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Cataract Dam is representative of a type of dam (cyclopean masonry gravity dam) constructed in NSW by the Water Supply and Sewerage Branch of the Public Works Department during the first half of the twentieth century. Key representative attributes of the dam's design and construction include the use of cyclopean masonry bedded in sandstone concrete, use of blue metal concrete facing, use of a spillway offset from the gravity wall, valve crest house attractively designed and finished to a high standard. The upgrading of the valves within the dam wall and ancillary monitoring and operating equipment is representative of the modern day safe operating practice. The construction technologies used at Cataract Dam came to be the norm for all subsequent dams constructed in NSW well into the twentieth century. Key representative attributes of the dam's construction techniques include the use of cableways, the building of temporary camps to house labourers and tradesman, building of semi permanent cottages to house salaried staff, the construction of terraced platforms to house plant and machinery, mechanisation of concrete production, the use of a purpose built tramway to transport raw materials from their source to the construction site, the construction of a purpose built road of access to transport men, supplies and materials from the nearest railhead to the construction site, the building of permanent infrastructure such as water supply for plant and residences, the use of electricity to power plant and equipment. The rehabilitation of tracts of land scarred in the construction process employed at Cataract Dam through beautification works, is representative of practices undertaken at other dams throughout NSW. Key representative attributes of this practice include utilising the former camp as a picnic area, utilising the former terraced construction platforms as picnic areas and lookouts, and utilising the former construction roads for vehicular access to the dam site and wall. The practice of ongoing maintenance of the Cataract Dam wall after by resident staff and workshop facilitates is representative of procedures that were undertaken at other dams and weirs constructed prior and after Cataract.

It provides water to the Macarthur and Illawarra regions, the Wollondilly Shire, and metropolitan Sydney. It is one of four dams and weirs in the catchment of the Upper Nepean Scheme. Completed in 1926 under the supervision of Ernest Macartney de Burgh, the dam is owned by Water NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999. Structural details The heritage-listed arch dam across the Cordeaux River with an unlined side spillway on the left abutment is high, long and creates a reservoir which holds . Construction began in 1918 and was completed in 1926 at a cost of A¬£945,000. The wall consists of large sandstone blocks, quarried onsite and cemented together, faced with a combination of bluestone and sandstone concrete. The dam featured a number of improvements in design and construction on the earlier-completed Cataract Dam. These included contraction joints between units of construction placed at intervals of ; inspection galleries at upper and lower levels, together with piping for registering any ground water pressure. The blue metal used in the construction of the dam was supplied from the Government Quarries at Kiama and brought by rail to Douglas Park. From here it was conveyed by aerial ropeway across the Nepean Gorge to an interchange on the eastern side where the material was transferred to a gauge steam tramway to a point adjacent to the dam site. History The Upper Nepean Scheme was commenced in 1880 after it was realised that the Botany Swamps scheme was insufficient to meet Sydney's water supply needs. The Nepean project consisted of the construction of a weir across the Nepean River to divert of the rivers Cataract, Cordeaux, Avon and Nepean, to the Prospect Reservoir. The design and construction of Cordeaux Dam was undertaken by the Water Supply and Sewerage Branch and Harbour and Rivers Branch of the New South Wales Public Works Department. The construction of the dam necessitated the knowledge and experience of a number of engineers employed in the branches at the time including Cecil Darley (NSW Inspecting Engineer in London), Leslie Wade (Principal Engineer, Water Supply and Sewerage Branch), Henry Dare and Ernest M. de Burgh (Supervising Engineers). The successful completion of the dam and its continuation of use as a water supply dam are a lasting testament to the professional capabilities of the late Victorian/Edwardian era generation of engineers of the Public Works Department.  Description  Cordeaux Dam is a cyclopean masonry dam composed of sandstone blocks, weighing from two to four and a half tons, quarried at the site and bedded in a cement mortar. The roughly rectangular blocks were bedded on and packed with sandstone concrete, with cement mortar only being used where considered necessary. The concrete is made with crushed Hawkesbury sandstone. Concrete made of hard basaltic stone (instead of the softer sandstone) is used for the upstream face, thick, which merges into sandstone concrete thick at lower levels and thick at higher levels. The dam wall is curved in plan and has a bywash spillway as a continuation of its southern end. Each end of the dam wall is flanked by massive Egyptian style pylons complete with decorative lotus columns. These pylons differ from those at Avon Dam by having heavy fluting to the lotus columns. Two valve houses along the dam wall are square, flat-roofed concrete buildings with strong Egyptian stylisation in the tapered wall profiles, circular beading to corners and overhanging eaves. These contain discharge outlets, with the Upper Outlet consisting of two pipes with FCD valves and Ring Faulkner gate valves. The two lower valve houses at the downstream foot of the dam wall are very similar in appearance and which contain discharge pipes with Ring Faulkner gate valves and scour valves as outlets. The dam featured a number of improvements in design and construction on the earlier-completed Cataract Dam. These included contraction joints between units of construction placed at intervals of ; inspection galleries at upper and lower levels, together with piping for registering any ground water pressure. Specifications for Cordeaux Dam: *Total capacity: . *Greatest depth of water: . *Greatest height of wall: (above foundations). *Length of crest including pylons: . *Area of lake: (when full). *Top water level . *Completed in 1926. *Cost: A¬£945,000 ($1,908,000). *Concrete in wall: . *Length of spillway weir: . *Width of crest: . *Width of base: . Cordeaux Dam storage is discharged to the Cordeaux River downstream, flowing to Pheasants Nest Weir on the Nepean River where it is diverted through a tunnel long to the Cataract River at Broughton's Pass. From here it is diverted by another weir to the Cataract Tunnel, long, emerging into the Upper Canal by which it is conveyed to Prospect Reservoir. There are three cottages associated with the Dam, two of brick and one of weatherboard. The brick cottages are both very similar single-storey brick bungalows with terracotta-tiled hipped-gable roofs, dating from the 1960s. The weatherboard cottage appears to date from the construction of the Dam and is reputed to have been the Resident Engineers residence. It is a single-storey, weatherboard clad building on sandstone piers with a hipped and gabled roof clad in corrugated-iron. The building features little decoration but has a front verandah which wraps around the building for half the length of the sides. This has chamfered square timber posts, a slatted timber balustrade and sandstone steps with sandstone masonry balustrades. The Cordeaux Dam site is a popular tourist attraction. The public area is maintained with picnic grounds, landscaped gardens, shelter sheds and pathways. The grounds associated with the main public areas of the dam contain many intact landscape elements from the s (and possibly late 1920s). Remnant landscape features include stone retaining walls; gardens (layout and plantings); a robust and imaginative cement-sculpted grotto/picnic shelter sited between a large Monterey Pine and a very large Eucalypt; a broad stone flagged surface drain in the upper picnic area; a lower picnic area with a series of grassed terraces accessible by a narrow crazy-paved path in stone; and a Monterey Pine (Pinus radiata) avenue to the lower dam road with gums beyond. The upper park area is characterised by mature pines while an interwar cottage and nearby propagating structure include older plantings of Magnolia grandiflora and Lagerstroemia indica which are probably contemporary with the cottage. A distinctive feature of the site is stands of autochthonous Cypress Pine (Callitris sp.). The Conservation Management Plan outlines the key elements and their individual significance assessments. = Condition = As at 21 January 2009, the condition of the dam was good. The fabric of Cordeaux Dam retains a high level of integrity. = Modifications and dates = *1960's - Two brick cottages were built, probably as replacements for earlier weatherboard cottages. *1988 - Upgraded with a system of drains in the wall and foundations. = Further information = Cordeaux Dam is located in three Council areas: Wollondilly, Wingecarribee and Wollongong.  Heritage listing  As at 21 January 2009, Cordeaux Dam was the second of the four water supply dams built as part of the development of the Upper Nepean Water Supply Scheme, one of the most important engineering works and items of public infrastructure in Australia, and still has the longest wall of all the NSW water supply dams. It was designed by the NSW Public Works Department under the direction of one of Australia's leading water supply engineers, E.M. De Burgh. The completion of the Cordeaux Dam was a significant step in the continuing process of providing a reliable water supply for Sydney and surrounding areas as part of the Upper Nepean Scheme. Even by the international standards of the time, Cordeaux was a large dam and was a significant work of engineering in its day. It continues to play an important role as a major source of supply for the Sydney region. Cordeaux Dam is a handsome, well proportioned structure with strong Egyptian style architectural character which complements the monumental nature of the structure and its attractive natural surroundings. Cordeaux Dam includes a range of ancillary structures which form components of the overall site, including residential cottages of various ages for operational staff, one of which appears to date from the construction of the dam. This latter is associated with the Residential Engineer for construction and operation of the dam and is a fine example of a late Federation Bungalow style building. The other residences are representative of their age and type. The public picnic grounds and gardens attached to the Cordeaux Dam contain a cultural landscape resource - including remnants of its interwar period plantings, layout and detailing, and extensive areas of bushland. There is evidence in the landscape design, particularly in the use of palms and tree ferns and battered stonework retaining walls, of an intention to continue the Egyptian Revival references apparent in the design of the main dam structures. Cordeaux Dam was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Cordeaux Dam is constructed within the Upper Nepean catchment area which was developed with the completion of the Cataract and Nepean tunnels in 1888, as the fourth source of water supply for Sydney. The potential of the Upper Nepean Catchment Area to supply water was fully developed through the construction of four major dams between 1903 and 1936. Cordeaux Dam is the second of these dams to have been completed. The Upper Nepean Catchment Area continues to supply the regions of Sydney and Illawarra. Cordeaux Dam was the fourth of the major water supply dams constructed in NSW during the first half of the twentieth century. The design and technologies used in the construction of the dam are representativethe methods developed by the Public Works Department of NSW at the time. In conjunction with the completion of Avon Dam in 1927, the impounded water of the Cordeaux catchment area provided one of the major sources of water for domestic and industrial consumption in metropolitan Sydney, the largest city in New South Wales. In providing water for metropolitan Sydney during this era the dam, in ensuring security of supply, contributed to the extensive residential, commercial and industrial development of Sydney during the 1920s and 1930s. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The design and construction of Cordeaux Dam was undertaken by the Water Supply and Sewerage Branch of the NSW Public Works Department. The construction of the dam drew upon the knowledge and experience of a number of engineers employed in the Branch at the time, including Ernest M. de Burgh (Chief Engineer). The successful completion of the dam and its continuation of use as a water supply dam are a lasting testament to the professional capabilities of the Federation/Inner War era generation of engineers of the Public Works Department. The tract of Eucalyptus bordering the encircling road of the upper picnic area was planted out by Board members of the former Water Board in 1928. The trees have particular memorial associations with past identities of the Board. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The wall of Cordeaux Dam is an engineering work imbued with a sense of aesthetic values expressed through the long curved wall set within the valley of the Cordeaux River. The design and finishes of the crest houses, entry pylons and lower valve houses in the Inter Egyptian style were undertaken by the Government Architect's branch of the Public Works Department at the time headed by George McCrae. The architectural detailing evokes a romanticised version of the Ancient Near East at a time when many Australians had first hand experience of the area through military service, and through knowledge of archeological finds reported in the popular press. The dam is set within the valley of the Cordeaux River. Upstream of the dam wall this setting is characterised by the broad expanse of the pool of water bordered by the crests of the valley sides. Downstream of the dam wall the setting is characterised by the steeper inclines that graduate into the gorge created by the river's flow over time. Collectively this topography at times of high water imparts a picturesque scene when viewed from selective vantage points above and on the dam wall. The former resident officer's cottage erected at the time of the dam's construction to house the resident engineer, is an excellent and intact example of the high standard of accommodation provided for Public Works Department senior staff. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The dam and grounds are recognised by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) as being a place which is part of the cultural environment of Australia, which has aesthetic, historical, architectural, archaeological, scientific and social significance for future generations, as well as for the present community of NSW. The dam and grounds are recognised by the Heritage Council of NSW as a place which is of significance to NSW in relation to its historical, scientific, cultural, social, archaeological, natural and aesthetic values. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The cyclopean masonry of the dam is an excellent early example of gravity dam construction in the Inter War era. It incorporates inspection galleries, contraction joints, and foundation drainage systems which collectively demonstrate the advanced state of this technology at the time. Terraces and platforms adjoining the dam abutments demarcate the location of plant and equipment used in the construction of the dam, in particular the location of the cableway head towers, and concrete batching plant. The plateau of the upper picnic area was the site of the original construction township and retains a road formation, culverts and drainage lines and tennis court from that era. The grounds of the dam retain numerous tree plantings undertaken for the opening of the dam in 1927. Collectively the diversity of these trees present a good record of past horticultural practices. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The wall of the Cordeaux Dam is the longest of all the dams constructed in the Upper Nepean Catchment Area. Cordeaux Dam is one of three dams in NSW which incorporate extensive inter War Egyptian architectural detailing. Cordeaux Dam is one of two extant dams in NSW which incorporate pedestrian and vehicular entry pavilions to the crest wall. The crest and valve houses and inlet works retain original ironwork and machinery such as roller gates, penstocks and penstock opening sysyem which represent a substantial repository of water supply delivery technology for the era in NSW. The dam incorporates the first instance of multiple level water discharges and valve houses, and emergency roller gates in NSW. The ensemble of plant buildings either associated with the construction or completion of the dam, such as weatherboard machine shed (adapted to double garage) and the corrugated iron blacksmiths, are unique in situ examples within the broader context of the four Metropolitan Dams. The dam incorporates cyclopean masonry which is a construction technique unique to the Metropolitan Dams in Australia. The dam incorporates the first instance of internal inspection galleries and connecting pipework and V notch weirs in a dam in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Cordeaux Dam is representative of a type of dam (cyclopean masonry gravity dam) constructed in NSW by the Department of Public Works during the first half of the twentieth century. Key representative attributes of the dam design and construction include the use of cyclopean masonry bedded in sandstone concrete, use of blue metal concrete in facing the upstream face, the use of sandstone concrete in facing the downstream wall, use of a spillway that is an extension of the gravity wall, upper and lower valve/crest houses attractively designed and finished to a high standard, the use of an array of upstream intakes to regulate the quality of water supply, the internal inspection galleries, the foundation grouting system, the contraction joints, and the internal drainage system. The upgrading of the valves within the dam wall and ancillary monitoring and operating equipment is representative of modern-day safe operating practice. The construction technologies used at Cordeaux Dam are representative of dams constructed in NSW through the first half of the twentieth century. Key representative attributes include the use of cableways, the building of temporary townships to house labourers and tradesman, building of semi-permanent cottages to house salaried staff, the construction of terrace platforms for plant and machinery, mechanisation of concrete production, the construction of a purpose built road of access and tramway to transport men, supplies and materials from the nearest railhead to the construction site, the building of permanent infrastructure such as water supply for plant, men and horses and the use of electricity to power plant and equipment. The rehabilitation of tracts of land scarred in the construction processes employed at Cordeaux Dam through beautification works is representative of practices undertaken at other dams throughout NSW. Key representative attributes of this practice include utilising the former township as a picnic area, utilising the former terraced construction areas as picnic areas and lookouts, and utilising the former construction roads and tramway for vehicular access to the dam wall. The practice of ongoing maintenance of the wall after completion through surveillance provided by resident staff and workshop facilities is representative of procedures undertaken at other dams in NSW. The provision of public amenity at the dam site is representative of the use of large water supply and irrigation dams in NSW as places for recreation by the greater community.

The reservoir created by the dam spreads across Avon, Bargo and also Yerrinbool in Wingecarribee Shire. The Nepean Dam is one of four dams and weirs in the catchment of the Upper Nepean Scheme, in New South Wales, Australia, and provides water to the Macarthur and Illawarra regions, the Wollondilly Shire, and metropolitan Sydney. Completed in 1935 under the supervision of Ernest Macartney de Burgh, the dam is currently managed by the Sydney Catchment Authority and is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. History The Upper Nepean Scheme was commenced in 1880 after it was realised that the Botany Swamps scheme was insufficient to meet Sydney's water supply needs. The Nepean project consisted of the construction of a weir across the Nepean River to divert of the rivers Cataract, Cordeaux, Avon and Nepean, to the Prospect Reservoir. By 1902, however, the water supply was found to be inadequate and a Royal Commission was held which recommended impounding the waters of the Cataract River by means of a major storage dam. The Cataract Dam was completed in 1907. In November 1918, a Board of Experts was appointed by the Government to draw up recommendations for the amplification of the Sydney water supply. It was upon the recommendations of this body, as approved by the Public Works Committee of the NSW Parliament, that not only Cordeaux, but also Avon and Nepean Dams were built. The Cordeaux Dam was completed in 1926 and the Avon Dam in 1927, on the Cordeaux and Avon Rivers respectively. As Cordeaux and Avon Dams were approaching completion, a fourth dam, Nepean Dam, was commenced in 1925. The site chosen was on the Nepean River, about above the point where the Cordeaux River joins the main stream at Pheasants Nest Pass and about by road southeast of Bargo railway station. The dam was designed by engineers of the Public Works Department under the direction of the Chief Engineer for Water Supply and Sewerage, EM de Burgh. Construction of the dam was undertaken by the Public Works Department until 1 September 1928, at which time the Department was re-organised and the majority of the staff associated with water supply were transferred to the Board of Water Supply and Sewerage, who continued the work on the dam. At that date, excavation for the foundations of the wall was complete and placing of concrete about to begin. Most of the plant and equipment used for the construction of Avon Dam was dismantled and re-erected at the Nepean Dam site, including the cableways and timber towers. A suspension bridge was constructed across the Nepean River which was later used at Warragamba Dam. Railway sidings were established on the Main Southern railway line at a point between Bargo and Yerrinbool. Transport to the dam site was again by light railway, on this occasion of standard gauge. This avoided transhipment from the Government vehicles bringing materials from large commercial quarries, effectively making the line an extended privately owned siding. The line was long through gentle countryside. Trains were worked by a variety of locomotives, including a former Sydney Steam Tram Motor. Additionally, there was a system of narrow () gauge lines in use at the dam construction site. A township for workers was constructed of timber obtained from the clearing of the catchment for the Avon Dam. This township provided four and five-roomed cottages for the married men and had metalled roads with concrete kerbing. A typical working man's accommodation consisted of a simple timber hut with a galvanised roof. Later, a barracks was constructed for single men. A Public School and recreation halls were also provided, as were full-time medical staff and facilities. Shortly after construction of the dam was transferred from the Public Works Department to the Water Board, it was decided upon the recommendation of the Chief Engineer of the Board, Gerald Haskins, that the height of the dam wall be increased by 25 ft (7.6m). This added nearly 50% to the storage capacity of the dam. Work on the dam continued until March 1930, when the depression compelled the Board first to curtail and then suspend work completely. The work recommenced on 12 June 1933 and continued without interruption until completion of the dam in 1935. Although the dam was ready to store water by September, 1935, there was little rainfall on its catchment during the ensuing three years; however, by October 1938 the dam was overflowing. At this time it was realised that scouring at the toe of the foundations of the dam required an alteration to the direction of the flow of floodwaters discharged over the spillway weir. This was done by constructing a concrete channel approximately 2,000 feet (609.7m) long, 120 feet (36.6m) wide, widening to 432 feet (131.7m) at the discharge weir. Construction of the channel commenced in July 1943, and was completed in November 1947. In the late 1960s, as part of a plan to interconnect the various water supply systems for Sydney Wollongong and Sutherland, a tunnel was constructed between the Nepean Dam and the Avon Dam (which now supplies the Wollongong area). This allows water to be transferred in either direction, as required. In the 1980s, work was undertaken on Nepean Dam to alleviate uplift pressure on, and leakage through, the foundations of the dam wall, in accordance with modern design criteria. The downstream face of the wall was supported with an embankment of quarried sandstone blocks and sandstone fill, the latter being compacted by grid and vibratory rollers. It was similar to the work undertaken at the same time for Avon Dam. Description The Nepean Dam is a large cyclopean masonry dam. This consists of large blocks of sandstone quarried at the site, embedded in and surrounded by sandstone concrete. To ensure water-tightness, all construction joints are grouted. The upstream face consists of blue metal concrete 5 feet (1.3m) thick while the downstream face is of similar material 3 feet (0.9m) thick. Both of the facing concrete sections are merged progressively into the central sandstone masonry concrete. All the latest improvements in dam design and construction of the day were embodied in the work, building upon the experience gained from the construction of the previous three Upper Nepean Scheme dams. Inspection galleries are provided, with pressure and drainage pipes from the foundations, and rubble drains lead into them. Provision is made for any leakage of water past the copper seals in the contraction joints to be conducted into the galleries and thence drained away. To facilitate the work of maintenance staff, an electric lift was provided in the wall. The water is discharged through two 36 inch (92 cm) diameter outlet pipes controlled by Ring Falkner gate valves and FCD valves. After construction was complete and the dam had filled, the spillway weir was altered by the construction on the western side of the stream of a concrete channel approximately 2,000 feet (609.7m) long and 120 feet (36.6m) wide, widening to 432 feet (131.7m) at the discharge weir. The Nepean Reservoir has a small storage capacity in relation to its large catchment area. While its capacity is much the same as that of Cataract and Cordeaux Reservoirs, its catchment basin is two and a half times as extensive as Cataract and three and a half times as extensive as Cordeaux. The Nepean Reservoir therefore fills more rapidly and, under normal conditions, is drawn upon more freely than the other reservoirs. Specifications of Nepean Dam: * Total capacity: 17,898 million gallons (81,400 million litres). * Years of construction: 1926-1935. * Cost: ¬£2,062,000 ($4,124,000). * Crest level above sea level: 1,066 feet (325m). * Amount of concrete in the wall: 300,218 cu yards (229,600 cu metres). * Length of crest including pylons: 710 feet (216.4m). * Length of spillway weir: 436 feet (132.9m). * Width at crest: 20 feet (6.1m). * Width at base: 225 feet (68.6m). * Full supply level above sea level: 1,051 feet (320.3m). * Greatest depth of water: 225 feet (68.6m). * Area of lake: 881 acres (356.5 hectares). * Area of catchment: 123 sq miles (319km2). * Average annual rainfall: 42.3 inches (1074mm). * Average annual yield: 23,515 million gallons (106,993 million litres). * Average annual evaporation: 38.5 inches (978mm). The Nepean Dam continues to supply Sydney with water. It is discharged as required into the river bed below the dam and flows to Pheasant's Nest where it is diverted by a weir to the Nepean Tunnel, 4¬Ω miles (7.2 km) long, discharging into the Cataract Tunnel, 2 miles (3.2 km) long, emerging into the Upper Canal, by which it is conveyed to Prospect Reservoir. The Nepean Dam is now also cross- connected to the Avon Dam, which supplies the Wollongong area, to provide additional water supply to that district. If necessary, it can also receive additional water from the Shoalhaven Scheme. Water is supplied to the Picton and Bargo districts from Nepean Dam, with this water treated and filtered in the Nepean Water Filtration Plant, a treatment facility added to the dam to improve the water quality to this district, which is now supplied directly from Nepean Dam. The Nepean Dam includes within its area three brick residential staff cottages, two apparently dating from the 1960s and one from the 1980s, and two older weatherboard cottages, one of which, utilised by the Filtration Plant staff, is the original Resident Engineer's Cottage. Just north of the entrance to the Dam picnic area are the former Catchment workshops, a series of small corrugated iron and weatherboard utilitarian buildings which were formerly the central maintenance facility for the Upper Nepean Catchment area. They remain in use at a low scale by the Sydney Catchment Authority and include a weatherboard residential cottage similar to the second of the weatherboard residences at the Dam. The area of the former construction village for the Dam remains undeveloped and heavily overgrown, with remnant road borders and evidence of buildings visible on the ground. The public area has been maintained by the Water Board and its successors, with picnic grounds, landscaped gardens and a children's playground. Remnants of the interwar period landscape at the Nepean Dam site are mainly concentrated in two areas - around a small park, with cement faux rockwork bedding edges, to the east of the dam wall, including a long line of Roman Cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) along the spillway alignment; and in a park-like picnic area along a terrace above the dam. Features of the latter area include pleasant plantings of mixed deciduous and evergreen exotic trees and Australian trees enclosing a long raised shelf, which is the remnant railway platform from the temporary construction railway, with a series of small timber picnic shelters with a somewhat log cabin-style character. Nearby a considerable line of dry- packed sandstone walling has been used and drystone walling is used generally to control access. The main entry road includes the remains of an old Cypress avenue and an ornamental gum avenue.  Heritage listing  Nepean Dam was the fourth of the four water supply dams built as part of the development of the Upper Nepean Water Supply Scheme, one of the most important engineering works and items of public infrastructure in Australia, and had the highest wall of all the NSW water supply dams at the time of its construction. It was designed by the NSW Public Works Department under the direction of one of Australia's leading water supply engineers, E.M. de Burgh. The completion of the Nepean Dam was a significant step in the continuing process of providing a reliable water supply for Sydney and surrounding areas as part of the Upper Nepean Scheme. Even by the international standards of the time, Nepean was a large dam and was a significant work of engineering in its day. It continues to play an important role as a major source of water supply for the Sydney region. Additionally, the Nepean Dam is a handsome, well proportioned structure with strong Stripped Classical style architectural character which complements the monumental nature of the structure and its attractive natural surroundings. Nepean Dam includes a range of ancillary structures which form components of the overall site, including residential cottages of various ages for operational staff and are representative of their age and type. The former Resident Engineer's cottage is an attractive example of a vernacular cottage of the early twentieth century. The public picnic grounds include a former construction railway platform now housing picnic shelters, and the site of the original construction village remains undeveloped and is now an overgrown archaeological site. The Nepean Dam picnic areas and gardens contain a cultural landscape resource - including remnants of its interwar period plantings, layout and detailing, and extensive areas of bushland - of regional value. The finely detailed dam structures of large-scaled concrete in Art Deco-style sit within a broader landscape setting of outstanding scenic quality. Nepean Dam was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Nepean Dam is located within the Upper Nepean Catchment Area which was developed with the completion of the Cataract and Nepean Tunnels in 1888, as the fourth source of water supply for Sydney. The potential of the Upper Nepean Catchment Area to supply water was fully developed through the construction of four major dams between 1903 and 1936. Nepean Dam is the last of these dams to have been completed. The Upper Nepean Catchment Area continues to supply the regions of Sydney and Illawarra, with the Nepean Dam providing a supply to Sydney, Macarthur, Bargo and Illawarra (through the Avon/Nepean Tunnel) regions. Nepean Dam was the fifth of the major water supply/irrigation dams constructed in NSW during the first half of the twentieth century. Whilst the dam was designed by the Public Works Department of NSW, the technologies used in the dam are representative of methods developed by that authority, the planning and scale of the construction techniques are more representative of the Water Board. In conjunction with other Metropolitan Dams and Woronora Dam built in 1941, the impounded water of Nepean Dam provided one of the major sources of water for domestic and industrial consumption in metropolitan Sydney, the largest city in NSW. In providing water for metropolitan Sydney during this era the dam, in ensuring security of supply, contributed to the extensive residential, commercial and industrial development of Sydney during the 1930s and 1950s. Nepean Dam was constructed over a period of ten years between 1926 and 1936, a protracted construction period which is directly related to the Great Depression and a period of Government financial stringency. The completion of the dam during this period was one of the major public works projects undertaken in the State. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The design and construction of Nepean Dam was initially undertaken by the Water Supply and Sewerage Branch of the NSW Public Works Department, and later developed by the Construction Branch of the Water Board. The construction of the dam drew upon the knowledge and experience of a number of engineers employed in the branches including E.M. de Burgh (Chief Engineer), and Gerald Haskins (the first engineer-in-chief of the former Water Board). The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The wall of Nepean Dam is an engineering work imbued with a sense of high aesthetic value expressed through the short curved high wall set with the steeply sided valley of the Nepean River. The design and finishes of the crest house and lower valve house in the Inter War Stripped Classical style were prepared by the engineers of the Water Board. The architectural detailing evokes a sense of monumentalism that is ideally suited to the context of the dam. The dam is set within the valley of the Nepean River. Upstream of the dam wall this setting is characterised by the broad expanse of the pool of water bordered by the crests of the valley sides. Downstream of the dam wall the setting is characterised by the steeper inclines that graduate into the gorge created by the river's flow over time. Collectively this topography at time of high water level imparts a picturesque scene when viewed from select vantage points above and on the dam wall. The former resident officer's cottage erected at the time of the dam's construction to house the resident engineer is an excellent and intact example of the high standard of accommodation provided for resident Public Works Department Senior staff. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The dam and grounds are recognised by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) as being a place which is part of the cultural environment of Australia, which has aesthetic, historical, architectural, archaeological, scientific and social significance for future generations, as well as for the present community of NSW. The dam and grounds are recognised by the Heritage Council of NSW as a place which is of significance to NSW in relation to its historical, scientific, cultural, social, archeological, natural and aesthetic values. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The cyclopean masonry of the dam is an excellent late example of this type of gravity dam construction in the Inter War era incorporating inspection galleries, contraction joints, and ground surface drainage system which demonstrate the principal characteristics of this technology at this time. Terraces and platforms adjoining the dam abutments demarcate the location of plant and equipment used in the construction of the dam, in particular the location of the cableway headtowers, the railway terraces and concrete mixing plant platform. The hillside near the upper picnic area was the site of the original construction township and retains an intact road formation, kerbing and guttering and tennis courts from that era. The integrity is such that collectively these features may potentially provide further insight into the lifestyles of the employees that constructed the dam. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The wall of the Nepean Dam is the highest of all the dams constructed in the Upper Nepean Catchment Area. Nepean Dam is one of three dams in NSW which incorporate extensive Inter War Stripped Classical architectural detailing. The crest and valve houses and inlet works retain original ironwork which represent a substantial repository of water supply delivery technology of the era. The use of an electronic lift in the wall (albeit now decommissioned) is a first for NSW. The completion of the dam necessitated the construction of a standard gauge (1835mm) railway line from Bargo which is unique in context of dam construction in NSW. The extent of foresight in planning the execution and design of the construction township is likely to be a first ion NSW in regard to dam construction, setting a practice which was further developed at Woronora Dam, and came to be exemplified at Warragamba Dam. The remnant platforms and terraces of the construction area are the largest in scale and most intact in regard to finishes and planning of all four of the Metropolitan Dams. The means of delivering stores and raw material through the network of railway lines and raised platforms, and the system of suspension footbridge and aerial stone ropeway to provide access and material over the gorge were particularly sophisticated for the time and foretells later developments at Warragamba Dam. The reservoir of the Nepean Dam is the second largest source of water in the whole of the network administered by SCA for the supply of metropolitan Sydney. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Nepean Dam is representative of a type of dam (cyclopean masonry gravity dam) constructed in NSW by the Water Supply and Sewerage Branch of the Public Works Department during the first half of the twentieth century. Key representative e attributes of the dam's design and construction include the use of cyclopean masonry bedded in sandstone concrete, use of blue metal concrete in the wall facings, use of a spillway set away from the gravity wall, valve and crest houses attractively designed and finished to a high standard, the use of an array of upstream intakes to regulate the quality of water supply, the internal inspection gallery, the foundation drainage system, the contraction joints, and the internal drainage system. The upgrading works to the spillway and dam wall in the 1980s, with the rock embankment to make the dam meet modern safety requirements are representative of modern-day safe operating practice. The construction technologies used at Nepean Dam are representative of dams constructed in NSW through the first half of the twentieth century. Key representative attributes include the use of cableways, the building of temporary camps to house labourers and tradesman, building of semi-permanent cottages to house salaried staff, the construction of terraced platforms for plant and machinery, mechanisation of concrete production, the construction of a purpose built road of access and tramway to transport men, supplies and materials from the nearest railhead to the construction site, the building of permanent infrastructure such as water supply for plant and men and horses, and the use of electricity to power plant and equipment. The rehabilitation of tracts of land scarred in the construction process employed at Nepean Dam through beautification works is representative of practices undertaken at other dams throughout NSW. Key representative attributes of this practice include utilising the former terraced construction platforms as picnic areas and lookouts, and utilising the former construction roads and tramway for vehicular access to the dam site and dam wall. The practice of ongoing maintenance of the Nepean Dam wall after completion through the surveillance of resident staff and workshop facilities is representative of procedures undertaken at other dams and weirs constructed in NSW. The provision of public amenity at the dam site is representative of the use of large water supply and irrigation dams in NSW as places for recreation by the greater community.

It is one of four dams and weirs in the catchment of the Upper Nepean Scheme, providing water to the Macarthur and Illawarra regions, the Wollondilly Shire, and metropolitan Sydney. The arch dam across the Avon River was completed in 1927 under the supervision of Ernest Macartney de Burgh, the dam is currently managed by the Sydney Catchment Authority and is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. History The Upper Nepean Scheme was commenced in 1880 after it was realised that the Botany Swamps scheme was insufficient to meet Sydney's water supply needs. The Nepean project consisted of the construction of a weir across the Nepean River to divert the rivers Cataract, Cordeaux, Avon and Nepean, to the Prospect Reservoir. By 1902 the original Nepean scheme was found also to be inadequate, after a severe drought had again depleted the water supply. A Royal Commission was appointed in 1902 to report on the water supply situation and in that same year, it recommended the construction of the Cataract Dam, to impound the waters of the Cataract River at a site upstream of Broughton's Pass. Construction of the dam was completed about the end of 1907. From 1907, rainfall on the catchment area was very low and it was not until January 1911 that Cataract Dam first filled to capacity. This, together with the greatly increased rate of consumption of water, stressed the need for additional water storage. The Nepean River watershed, from a topographical standpoint, was found to be very favourable for the construction of large water storage works at moderate cost. Rivers such as the Cordeaux, Avon and Nepean, located in narrow gorges, provided very suitable dam sites, with solid rock foundations at a shallow depth. Sandstone could easily be quarried into rough rectangular blocks and used for the construction. These features led to the recommendation that more dams be built. A site for a second storage dam, Cordeaux, to be built on the Cordeaux River, was selected by the Water Board in the latter part of the 1911 and a gauging weir was constructed. Preliminary plans and estimates were prepared and the foundations tested. Following this, further investigations were carried out by the Public Works Department. Good rainfall occurred throughout the succeeding years (except for a dry period in 1915-1916) and, because of this and the intervention of World War I, construction on the Cordeaux Dam was not commenced until 1918. In November of that year a Special Board of Experts consisting of engineers from the Public Authorities was appointed by the Government to draw up recommendations for the amplification of the Sydney water supply. This body not only endorsed the construction of the Cordeaux Dam but recommended the construction of the Avon and Nepean Dams as well. In 1921, three years after the Cordeaux Dam was commenced and five years before it was completed, the Public Works Department commenced work on a third and much higher dam at a site selected on the Avon River, a tributary of the upper Nepean. The Avon Dam was also designed and constructed by the Public Works engineers under the direction of the Chief Engineer for Water Supply and Sewerage, E.M. De Burgh. As with the previous dams, Cataract and Cordeaux, Avon Dam was built using cyclopean masonry. This consisted of sandstone blocks, quarried from the site, which were fitted into an irregular pattern and packed with sandstone concrete. However, in this case the rock was quarried to make a deep cut through a ridge to a neighbouring creek to provide the spillway for the dam. Like its predecessors, Avon also had the upstream face of the dam sheathed with a layer of basaltic concrete (2 feet thick) for watertightness and to resist wave and other erosion forces. The concrete was all manufactured on the site in special metal-crushing, concrete mixing plants. These included Jacques roll-jaw crushers, pulverising mills and Mullimix drum-type batchmixers. From the mixers, the concrete was discharged into concrete skips especially designed to facilitate the distribution of the concrete on the dam wall. All the plant was electrically operated and the current obtained from the State Power Station at Port Kembla by transmission lines 19 miles (30.9 km) in length. A road 6 miles (9.6 km) in length was constructed from Bargo railway station to transport all the materials. Other plant used on the site included two Lidgerwood cableways, three locomotive cranes and four stiff-leg type derrick cranes. All of these were designed and constructed in Australia. The water storage area for the dam was cleared of all timber and brush except for stumps 3 feet (0.9m) high. Any hardwood timber of commercial value was cut into sleepers, fencing posts and rails and used in the construction of the works railway to the Nepean Dam then under construction. An extensive area of Coachwood timber (Ceratopetalum apetalum) was found in the storage basin. This was cut at a special sawmill erected at the Dam and a fleet of punts and launches transported the logs down the river to the mill. About 1 million superficial feet (3,540 m3) of sawn and dressed timber was produced. It was used in the construction of buildings in the Nepean Dam township, for wall forms for both the Avon and Nepean Dams and the remainder was sold. Accommodation for workmen was provided near the construction site in a single-storey barracks for single men. Land was placed at the disposal of the married men who were assisted in constructing temporary houses for themselves and their families. Avon Dam was completed in 1927 and handed over to the Water Board on 20 January 1928. It was built at the cost of AU¬£1,047,000. The Dam served the Sydney area until the completion of Warragamba Dam in 1960, after which, in 1963, its storage was reserved to meet the increased water supply needs of the Wollongong area. An electrical pumping station located in Flying Fox Creek, at the end of the stored water remote from the wall, pumps water over the Divide to Wollongong and Port Kembla. In 1973, as part of a plan to interconnect the various water supply systems for Sydney, Wollongong and Sutherland, a tunnel was constructed between the Nepean Dam and the Avon Dam. This allows water to be transferred in either direction, as required.  Description  The Avon Dam was the third and largest of the four dams constructed to develop the Upper Nepean catchment area, in order to meet Sydney's ever increasing demand for water. It was built using cyclopean masonry. This consisted of sandstone blocks, quarried from the site, which were fitted into an irregular pattern and packed with sandstone concrete. However, in this case the rock was quarried to make a deep cut through a ridge to a neighbouring creek to provide the spillway for the dam. Like its predecessors, Avon also had the upstream face of the dam sheathed with a layer of basaltic concrete (2 feet thick) for watertightness and to resist wave and other erosion forces. The dam wall is curved in plan and has a spillway channel constructed as an open cut through a ridge between the reservoir and a watercourse, which discharges into the Avon River half a mile (0.8 km) below the dam. Each end of the dam wall is flanked by massive Egyptian style pylons complete with decorative lotus columns. It is fitted with outlet valves on two levels. The upper level water draw-off consists of two 3 feet (0.9m) diameter pipes each fitted with needle valves 30 inches (76.2 cm) in diameter, situated 80 feet (24.4m) below full supply level. The lower draw-offs, which were used for passing the stream flow during construction work, consist of two 4 feet (1.2m) diameter pipes fitted with 36 inch (0.9m) diameter needle valves at the level of the river bed. Specifications for Avon Dam: * Capacity: 47,153 million gallons (214,500 megalitres) (now 146,700 megalitres).. * Greatest depth of water: 210 feet (64m). * Greatest height of wall above foundations: 237 feet (72m). * Area of lake at full supply level: 2,609 acres (1,057 hectares). * Cost: ¬£1,047,000. * Concrete in wall: 219,515 cubic yards (167,929 cu metres). * Length at crest including pylons: 725 feet (221m). * Length at spillway weir: 437 feet (133m). * Width at base: 200 feet (61m). * Width at crest: 20 feet (6m). * Area of lake catchment: 55 sq miles (142km2). The Dam today has a well-developed picnic area on its eastern side, approximately in the area formerly occupied by the construction village. This picnic area features landscaped gardens within picturesque retaining walls, large areas of lawn and modern amenities and shelter facilities. There is a large rivetted steel (possibly cast-iron) elevated water tank within the picnic area, carried on rivetted plate-web girders and cast steel (or iron) posts. There is only one early residential building remaining, believed to be the former Resident Engineers residence. It is a single-storey weatherboard building with terracotta tiled hipped roof which also has a breakfront gabled wing. It is simply detailed with carved timber brackets to a projecting rectangular window frame and roughcast render to the chimney. One other house dates from the 1960s and two from the 1970s/80s and are all single-storey brick cottages. The earlier cottage is of red brick and has terracotta tiles to a hipped and gabled roof. The two later cottages appear to have been built to the same design and feature concrete tiled, gable roofs and utilise large- dimension mottled bricks. The works office and the picnic area amenities buildings are single storey brick buildings, recent in origin, with either profiled steel skillion roofs or gable roofs clad in concrete tiles. After the immediate dam environment of the Cataract Dam, that of the Avon Dam is perhaps the most scenically impressive landscape. Near the dam wall there are several distinct gardens that function as individual picnic areas. These include a series of grotto-like shelters along the sandstone cliff that defines the western edge of the area; a discrete palm-planted area with ornamental pools; and a larger park-like area extending to the south along the edge of the dam. The cliffline landscape includes shelters with stone and cement-rendered seating, some cement faux rockwork walling, plantings of Wisteria, palms, Cordyline sp., Cyathea sp. and various ferns. The pool garden is dominated by four large circular ponds, with small intermediate ponds, made from rendered cement. The larger ponds even have their own planters attached to the sides. The ponds are surrounded by an array of palm and Cordyline plantings in order to engender the ambience of an Egyptian oasis. Nearby, the main gardens are contained within the elongated park-like area to the south. The entry features a pair of stone piers incorporating the words AVON DAM in quartz pebbles and a central path that leads to various picnic tables. There are plantings of Swamp Cypress (Taxodium distichum), Hoop Pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), Syzygium, Podocarpus, Acer, Camellia, Flowering Cherry and Liquidambar. Other features include rustic picnic structures, birdbath, [Chinese] lantern and propagating structure. On the ridge above these gardens are several interwar cottages with contemporary plantings of Monterey Pinus (Pinus radiata), Cypress, Crepe Myrtle, Viburnum and Photinia. To the northeast of the cottages are the remains of a propagating structure - further testifying to the importance attached to the establishment and maintenance of this landscape. Nearby is a very large Scribbly Gum which, as part of the indigenous vegetation, long predates any use of the site for Sydney's water supply. The loop road, giving access to the area along the ridge, is edged by a low stone retaining wall that also dates to the late 1920s-1930s period. Along the main entry road to the dam site near an old gate are clumps of Agave americana and Flax which may indicate the earlier presence of a cottage now demolished.  Heritage listing  The Avon Dam was the third and the largest of the four water supply dams built as part of the development of the Upper Nepean Water Supply Scheme, one of the most important engineering works and items of public infrastructure in Australia, and is still the second largest of all the NSW water supply dams in terms of storage capacity. It was designed by the NSW Public Works Department under the direction of one of Australia's leading water supply engineers, E.M. De Burgh. The completion of the Avon Dam was a significant step in the continuing process of providing a reliable water supply for Sydney and surrounding areas as part of the Upper Nepean Scheme. Even by the international standards of the time, Avon was a high dam with a large impoundment of water and was a significant work of engineering in its day. It continues to play an important role as the major source of supply for the Wollongong, Port Kembla and surrounding towns and areas. Additionally, the Avon Dam is a handsome, well proportioned structure with strong Egyptian style architectural character which complements the monumental nature of the structure and its attractive natural surroundings. The roadway was constructed prior to the Dam between 1918 and 1921, and was used to transport all materials, stores and labour and significantly provided the sole route of transportation, other dam sites relying on a combination of road, tram or ropeway, and continues to be used as the main access to the present time. The Avon Dam includes a range of ancillary structures which form components of the overall site. One building is believed to be the original Residential Engineers residence and is a fine example of an Interwar Bungalow. The other residential buildings associated with the dam are relatively modern replacements for the original set of houses, but are representative of their type. The grounds associated with the Avon Dam are of considerable aesthetic and social value. They contain an important, substantially intact interwar landscape design - including ornamental ponds, grottoes and rustic picnic structures - particularly incorporating various Egyptian Revival references to complement the thematic treatment of the architecture associated with the main dam structures. The immediate dam area is of distinction as a scenic landscape. Avon Dam was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Avon Dam is constructed within the Upper Nepean Catchment Area which was developed with the completion of the Cataract and Nepean tunnels in 1888 as the fourth source of water supply for Sydney. The potential of the Upper Nepean Catchment Area to supply water was fully developed through the construction of four major dams between 1903 and 1936. Avon Dam is the third of these dams to have been completed. The Upper Nepean Catchment Area continues to supply the regions of Sydney and the Illawarra, with Avon Dam providing a supply to the Illawarra region through the Upper Avon water pumping station. Avon Dam was the fifth of the major water supply/irrigation dams constructed in NSW during the first half of the twentieth century. The design and technologies used in the construction of the dam are representative of methods developed by the Public Works Department of NSW at the time. In conjunction with the completion of Cordeaux Dam in 1926, the impounded water of the Avon Catchment Area provided one of the major sources of water for domestic and industrial consumption in metropolitan Sydney, the largest city in NSW. In providing water for metropolitan Sydney during this era the dam, in ensuring security of supply, contributed to the extensive residential, commercial and industrial development of Sydney during the 1920s and 1930s. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The design and construction of Avon Dam was undertaken by the Water Supply and Sewerage Branch of the NSW Public Works Department. The construction of the dam drew upon the knowledge and experience of a number of the engineers employed in the Branch at the time including Ernest M. De Burgh (engineer in chief), the successful completion of the dam and its continuation of use as a water supply dam are a lasting testament to the professional capabilities of the Federation/Inter War era generation of engineers of the Public Works Department. The former official quarters at Avon Dam, has provided for a number of generations, a holiday type residence for the board members of the Water Board. The buildings and grounds have some associations with past identities of the board, which was until comparatively recently one of the major government departments in NSW in regard to its economic and political influence. The tract of West Australian gum trees situated to the north west of the former official quarters was planted out by board members of the Water Board in 1928. The trees have particular memorial associations with past identities of the Board. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The wall of Avon Dam is an engineering work imbued with a sense of high aesthetic value expressed through the long curved wall set within the steep valley of the Avon River. The design and finishes of the crest house, entry pylons and lower valve house in the Inter War Egyptian style were undertaken by the Government Architects Branch of the Public Works Department at that time headed by George McCrae. The architectural detailing of the superstructures evokes a romanticised vision of the \\"Ancient Near East\\" at a time when many Australians had first hand experience of the area through military service, and through knowledge of archaeological finds reported in the popular press. The dam is set within the valley of the Avon River. Upstream of the dam wall this setting is characterised by the broad expanse of the pool of water bordered by the crests of the valley sides. Downstream of the dam wall the setting is characterised by the steeper inclines that graduate into the river gorge. The topography, at times of high water level, imparts a picturesque scene when viewed from selective vantage points above and on the dam wall. The former resident officer's cottage erected at the time of construction is an excellent, albeit much modified, example of the high standard of accommodation provided for resident Public Works Department for its senior staff. The landscaping of its lower picnic grounds exhibit a high level of design awareness through its planning, evolution and association with the Botanic Gardens on the original layout and selection of species. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The dam and grounds are recognised by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) as being a place which is part of the cultural environment of Australia which has aesthetic, historical, architectural, archeological, scientific and social significance for future generations, as well as for the present community of NSW. The dam and grounds are recognised by the Heritage Council of NSW as a place which is of significance to NSW in relation to its historical, scientific, cultural, social, archeological, natural and aesthetic values. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The cyclopean masonry of the dam is an excellent and early example of gravity dam construction in the Inter War era incorporating inspection galleries, contraction, joints and foundation drainage system which collectively demonstrate the principal characteristics of the state development of this technology at the time. The double level discharge, penstock gates and roller gates collectively demonstrate the principal characteristics of the state development of this technology at the time. The terraces and platforms adjoining the dam abutments demarcate the location of plant and equipment used to in the construction of the dam, in particular the location of the cableway head towers, the quarry railway terrace, the motor vehicle garage, and the electricity substation. The grounds of the dam retain numerous tree plantings undertaken from the time of the completion of the dam in 1928. Collectively the diversity of these trees present a good record of past horticultural practices. The catchment area in being relatively untouched bushland in close proximity to a major urban area has a high potential for further research into natural ecosystems. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The basin of the reservoir of Avon Dam is the area of the largest impoundment within the Upper Nepean Catchment Area. Avon Dam is one of three dams in NSW which incorporate extensive Inter War Egyptian Architectural detailing. Avon Dam is however unique in always retaining remnant landscape features that continues to evoke the imagery of an Egyptian revival landscape. Avon Dam is one of two dams in NSW which incorporate pedestrian and vehicular entry pavilions to the crest wall. The crest and valve houses and inlet works retain original ironwork and machinery such as the roller gates and penstock gates and operating mechanism which represent a substantial repository of water supply delivery technology of the era. The spillway channel was the largest in terms of the depth and width constructed up to that date within the Sydney metropolitan area. The purpose built road of access to the dam wall from the railhead at Bargo is unique within the context of the four metropolitan Dams in being the principal means by which the general supplies, men and raw materials were transported during the construction process. The dam wall retains evidence for a scour outlet operating system which was unique to Avon Dam. The dam incorporates cyclopean masonry which is a construction technique unique to the Metropolitan Dams in Australia. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Avon Dam is representative of a type of dam (cyclopean masonry gravity dam) constructed in NSW by the Water Supply and sewerage Branch of the Public Works department during the first half of the twentieth century. Key representative attributes of the dam's design and construction include the use of cyclopean masonry bedded in sandstone concrete, use of blue metal concrete in facing the upstream face, use of sandstone concrete in the facing of the downstream face, use of a spillway set away from the gravity wall, lower valve/crest house attractively designed and finished to a high standard, the use of an array of upstream intakes to regulate the quality of water supply, the internal inspection galleries, the foundation drainage system, the contraction joints, and the internal drainage system. The upgrading works to the spillway and dam wall with the compacted rock embankment and spill weir redesign, competed in 1971 to make the dam meet modern safety requirements, are representative of engineering practice of the day. The upgrading of the valves within the dam wall and ancillary monitoring and operating equipment is representative of modern dam safe operating practice. The construction technologies used at Avon Dam are representative of dams constructed in NSW through the first half of the twentieth century by the Public Works Department. Key representative attributes of the dam's construction techniques include the use of cableways, the building of temporary camps to house labourers and tradesmen, building of permanent cottages to house salaried staff, the construction of terrace platforms to house plant and machinery, mechanisation of concrete production, the construction of a purpose built road of access to transport men, supplies and materials from the nearest railhead to the construction sites, the building of permanent infrastructure such as water supply for plant and men and houses, the use of electricity to power plant and equipment. The rehabilitation of tracts of scarred in the construction process employed at Avon Dam through beautification works is representative of practices undertaken at other dams throughout NSW. Key representative attributes of this practice include utilising the former camp as a picnic area, utilising the former terraced construction platforms as picnic areas and lookouts, and utilising the former construction roads for vehicular access to the dam site ands dam wall. The practice of ongoing maintenance of the wall after completion through resident staff and workshop facilities is representative of procedures undertaken at other dams and weirs constructed in NSW.

A number of different conditions of the cervical (neck) spinal column cause similar clinical signs. These conditions may include malformation of the vertebrae, intervertebral disc protrusion, and disease of the interspinal ligaments, ligamenta flava, and articular facets of the vertebrae. Wobbler disease is also known as cervical vertebral instability, cervical spondylomyelopathy (CSM), and cervical vertebral malformation (CVM). In dogs, the disease is most common in large breeds, especially Great Danes and Doberman Pinschers. In horses, it is not linked to a particular breed, though it is most often seen in tall, race-bred horses of Thoroughbred or Standardbred ancestry. It is most likely inherited to at least some extent in dogs and horses. Wobbler disease in dogs X-ray of wobbler disease in a dog Wobbler disease is probably inherited in the Borzoi, Great Dane, Doberman, and Basset Hound. Instability of the vertebrae of the neck (usually the caudal neck) causes spinal cord compression. In younger dogs such as Great Danes less than two years of age, wobbler disease is caused by stenosis (narrowing) of the vertebral canal related to degeneration of the dorsal articular facets and subsequent thickening of the associated joint capsules and ligaments. A high- protein diet may contribute to its development. In middle-aged and older dogs such as Dobermans, intervertebral disc disease leads to bulging of the disc or herniation of the disc contents, and the spinal cord is compressed. In Great Danes, the C4 to C6 vertebrae are most commonly affected; in Dobermans, the C5 to C7 vertebrae are affected. MRI of wobbler disease in the neck of a dog The disease tends to be gradually progressive. Symptoms such as weakness, ataxia, and dragging of the toes start in the rear legs. Dogs often have a crouching stance with a downward flexed neck. The disease progresses to the front legs, but the symptoms are less severe. Neck pain is sometimes seen. Symptoms are usually gradual in onset, but may progress rapidly following trauma. X-rays may show misaligned vertebrae and narrow disk spaces, but it is not as effective as a myelogram, which reveals stenosis of the vertebral canal. Magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be more effective at showing the location, nature, and severity of spinal cord compression than a myelogram. Treatment is either medical to control the symptoms, usually with corticosteroids and cage rest, or surgical to correct the spinal cord compression. The prognosis is guarded in either case. Surgery may fully correct the problem, but it is technically difficult and relapses may occur. Types of surgery include ventral decompression of the spinal cord (ventral slot technique), dorsal decompression, and vertebral stabilization. One study showed no significant advantage to any of the common spinal cord decompression procedures. Another study showed that electroacupuncture may be a successful treatment for Wobbler disease. A new surgical treatment using a proprietary medical device has been developed for dogs with disc-associated wobbler disease.

The owner reported it had been two years since the dog was able to hold its neck in an elevated position. Wobbler disease in horses Wobbler disease or wobbler's syndrome is a broad category of cervical disorders in the horse, including the conditions listed above, as well as equine wobbles anemia and cervical vertebral myelopathy, spinal cord compression (sometimes referred to colloquially among horse owners as \\"cervical arthritis\\" due to the arthritis that accumulates in facets). Within the horse community, any neurological problem that causes limb proprioception issues or decreased performance in the horse that is suspected to be rooted in the neck is considered a type of wobbler disease. Most forms of wobbler disease have a root cause in cervical vertebral myelopathy (CVM), which causes inflammation and arthritis in the joint and is painful to affected horses. At this time it is believed to possibly be a congenital condition. Mounting evidence is growing that points to CVM and other cervical and vertebral disorders (like Kissing Spine) as hereditary and found in populations of specific families. http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/ceh/local_resources/pdfs/pubs-HR29-2-bkm- sec.pdf. Other forms, such as cervical arthritis and equine wobbles anemia, are concentrated in certain breeds and demonstrate possible hereditary factors. Horses with wobbler disease often exhibit ataxia (implying dysfunction of parts of the nervous system), show weakness in the hindquarters, or may knuckle over in their fetlocks, particularly in the rear. They also may show overall stiffness especially in the neck and back and may not move fluidly. A common ataxic symptom is the horse will list to one side behind. They also may demonstrate uneven strides with one leg intermittently shorter in step. Horses with wobbler disease or cervical anomalies can demonstrate difficult to diagnose lamenesses that come and go, and often are not resolved by veterinary blocks to the limbs. With advanced stages of the disease, affected horses are prone to falling due to extreme listing behind and often demonstrate difficulty getting up from lying down, or reluctance to lie down at all. While some cases are successfully treated with nutritional and medical management, surgery is also used. One method is the use of titanium baskets, placed to fuse the vertebrae, thereby preventing compression of the spinal cord. Some horses are able to return to work, with a few able to reach competitive levels. No complete cure for the condition is known. Famous horses known to have completed basket surgery include Seattle Slew. Seattle Slew underwent two basket surgeries and has sired multiple offspring that have cervical arthritis. He is one of many Thoroughbred stallions to have undergone basket surgery and still be used for stud. Because wobbler disease is the best known of the neurological conditions that affect horses, other, unrelated conditions, such as kissing spine, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis and cerebellar abiotrophy, are sometimes misdiagnosed as wobbler disease, though the causes and symptoms differ. =Clinical Presentation= Including the symptoms listed above, clinical presentations of \\"wobblers\\" can also include neck pain and stiffness, difficulty tracking up or gait abnormalities, decreased performance, intermittent or swapping lameness particularly in diagonal pairs, forelimb lameness, abnormal head and neck posture, defensiveness or change in behavior, and abnormal sweat patterns. =Diagnosis= Wobbler disease is definitively diagnosed by x-ray, nuclear scintography or bone scan. X-rays will show channel widening or filling the easiest and are often most cost effective to horse owners. X-rays will also show any structural anomaly, arthritis, facet remodeling, or bone spurs present. Preliminary diagnosis can be made by ultrasound but x-rays are needed to measure the true depth of facet involvement. For extent of damage to associated structures, veterinarians may opt to have the horse undergo a bone scan or nuclear scintography. =Commonly affected horse breeds= *Warmbloodhttps://www.colovma.org/wp- content/uploads/sites/8/2016/09/Story_CervicalDisorders.pdf *Standardbred *American Quarter Horse *American Paint Horse *Thoroughbred References External links *Video of a dog with wobbler syndrome treated with the artificial disc replacement Category:Dog diseases Category:Horse diseases ","title":"Wobbler disease"},{"id":"3929996","text":"Self-Portrait Lee Greene Richards (July 27, 1878 ‚Äì February 20, 1950) was a famous Utah portrait artist.

It contains three CDs, which are named individually Live, Rare and Remix. The live, rare, and remix tracks in question are essentially the collected B-sides from all five singles taken from the band's hugely successful 1991 album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Background Despite the world-wide success of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, guitarist John Frusciante's 1992 departure from the band left them struggling through a string of guitarists until they recruited former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro in 1993. Although the band recorded the instrumental tracks for their then forthcoming One Hot Minute album in 1994, singer Anthony Kiedis relapsed into drug use in late 1993 which delayed his recording of the vocal tracks until 1995, when the album was finally released. As a result of such delays, it is likely that the Live Rare Remix Box release was used as a stop-gap to appease fans until the band finally finished and released One Hot Minute after a four-year recording gap. In addition, it contains \\"Soul to Squeeze\\", which had been a successful single but did not appear on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. This set is particularly notable for including all the remixes from the rare \\"If You Have to Ask\\" single. It does not, however, include every remix of \\"Give It Away\\" or radio edits of any song. The set nevertheless remains a concise alternative to purchasing every single from the period and is therefore popular with fans. The same year, The Plasma Shaft was released in Australia and Japan, which features a smaller selection of rarities including two radio edits. The box set was part of a series of Warner Bros. box sets of rarities taken from a specific album, a series which also included R.E.M.'s The Automatic Box.

Thiruchendur Co-operative Spinning Mills Limited, Nazareth which was the only spinning mill and was the livelihood for many people in that area for close to a century, was closed a decade ago in 2002-03 period due to financial crunch and lack of modernization. Earlier Nazareth was part of the Tirunelveli CSI diocese and in 2003 Thoothukudi - Nazareth Diocese was formed after bifurcation from Tirunelveli Diocese.Thoothukudi - Nazareth Diocese of the Church of South India As the history of the church, a small village by name ‚ÄúShanpathu‚Äù with 8 families became Christians in the year 1803 through Rev. Sathyanathan. Its revenue extent is 7 sq. miles. The first church a thatched building with palmyrah leaves was built in 1803 named St. John's church at Nazareth. In 20/11/1830 the 2nd church was built by Rev. Adaikalam. It was decided to build a new church. In June 1920 this church was demolished and the foundation was laid for a new church on 5/7/1920 by Rt. Rev. E.H.M. Waller, Bishop in Tirunelvelli. A temporary church was built in front of the present church. In 26/5/1924 Rev.C.S.Stapley the then Presbyter and missionary was transferred and handed over charge to Rev. Canon Diraviam .Koilpillai, who took charge in 26/5/1924 and the present church was built by him. The church was dedicated by Rt. Rev. Norman Canon Margoschis' contribution towards Nazareth Many eminent Missionaries rendered significant services not only to the growth of Christianity but also to solidify British occupation. the development of Nazareth in manifold dimensions. Of whom, the contribution of Canon A. Margoschis to the many-sided growth of this village is notable. The development of Nazareth with the educational institutions, the orphanage and Art Industrial School, the hospital and the church is principally due to the result of the efforts of the great missionary Canon A. Margoschis. During decades of the 19th century, Nazareth was identified as a small hamlet situated near Valaiyadi or Vahuthankuppam and the people of Nazareth had to get things from the shops or the neighbouring villages crossing the sandy soil clustered with the bush and trees. Such a backward un-recognised hamlet has become a recognized and developed place with all facilities owing to the work done by canon Margoschis,. St. Luke's Hospital, Nazareth: Though it was founded in 1870 by Dr J.M. Strachan, the monumental growth was under the able stewardship of Canon A. Margoschis. As he had the knowledge of medicine, he could do marvellous medical service, helping thousands of sick flocking even from 20 to 30 miles away. This service was rendered freely to all irrespective of caste and creed. There was a dire need to provide more facilities to the swelling number of sick in the hospital with wards, compounding room etc., To meet the requirements, the main building of the hospital was built by him in 1892 and the hospital was Christened ‚ÄúSt. Luke‚Äôs Hospital‚Äù by him on the day of St. Luke's (18 October) in 1892. Orphanage and art industrial school: Canon Margoschis built a small hut hundred yards away from his bungalow for the orphans in 1877. As the number of orphans increased, he took efforts to put up a building for them and the same was built in 1878 in the place where the Art Industrial School is now. He was made aware of his responsibilities and obligations towards the less-privileged and was very anxious to introduce teaching for them on industrial courses. Hence he founded the Art Industrial School in the orphanage itself on 14-11-1878. Carpentry, Black-smithy and sewing courses were started and then weaving section was introduced. In 1884, the first sewing machine was bought and the art of tailoring was introduced. The lower Secondary Training was provided and in 1900, Upper Secondary Training was transferred from Tuticorin to Nazareth. He was the manager of the school until his death. In those days the Art Industrial School, the brain- child of Canon Margoschis, was praised as the only one of its kind in the district and the oldest in the Presidency of Madras. Girls' high school Canon Margoschis was made superintendent of the school 1876 itself. He founded Teachers Training School in 1877. He also stressed the need for good education to women and started kindergarten school. In 1886, he made a historic achievement of upgrading the normal school to a high school. The school became a full-fledged high school in 1888 and the first set of women in the Presidency of Madras to pass the Matriculation Examination was from this school. The Standard of the school was very much appreciated by the Director of Public Instruction in 1890. This school is the first high school for women in south India. Boys' high school: Canon Margoschis founded a middle school for boys in 1882 in the name ‚ÄúAnglo ‚Äì Vernacular School‚Äù. In 1885; this school was awarded ‚Äú The Best School‚Äù title in the Presidency of Madras, He made a successful venture of upgrading it as \\"high school\\" in 1889 in spite of the stiff opposition from the then Bishop Rt. Rev. Caldwell. This infuriated the Bishop, who closed down the high school section in 1892. Theological seminary: Another brainchild of Canon Margoschis was the theological seminary. It was founded by him in 1890 with eight students. It had grown from strength to strength in the following years. Other developments and benefits: Canon Margoschis adopted Nazareth as his ‚ÄúChild‚Äù, and with the help of the orphans and hired labourers, he laid the metal road from Nazareth to Valaiyadi and planted trees on both sides. Telegraphic office was opened on 25-12-1894, as a result of the initiative taken by him. He showed interest in town planning also and the 5th street was formed by him. As a result of his efforts, the original plan to lay the railway line from Tirunelveli to Tiruchendur via. Thenthiruperai was changed and it was decided to lay it via Nazareth. This work, was put into operation a few years after his death. The people of Nazareth celebrated the 100th death centenary of Canon Arthur Margoschis at Nazareth from 23 April to 27 April 2008.

When Canon Arthur Margoschis was the Missionary at Nazareth, the Higher Grade Middle School became an \\"Anglo-vernacular School\\". In 1885, this school was selected for the Award of the \\"Best School of the Madras Presidency\\" and in the very same year, it was upgraded into a High school. But in 1890, the high school classes were taken away from this high school and attached to the Caldwell High School, Thoothukudi. So the school at Nazareth was reverted into a Higher Grade Middle School. From 1890 to 1912, it served as a model school for the Higher Grade Teacher Trainees. In 1909, it became a recognized Middle school and in that capacity, it continued to function till 1932. The school attained the status of a high school again on 23 October 1932.

Dexter Southfield was founded in 1926 as the Dexter School. In 2013 the Dexter School merged with the sister school Southfield School to form Dexter Southfield with which it had shared its campus since 1992.Statement and School History  History  The Dexter School was founded in 1926 in response to the closure of the Noble & Greenough Lower School and lack of educational opportunities for boys in the Brookline area. The Dexter School opened on Freeman Street in the affluent Cottage Farm neighborhood educating boys through ninth grade. The school developed a strong bond with many of Boston‚Äôs leading families with ties to the leading preparatory and Ivy League schools. In 1966, Dexter sold its campus on Freeman Street and moved to their present location on a hill on Newton Street on the South Brookline/Jamaica Plain line. The school bought the property from the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America who had resided on the site since 1945. The property was the former estate of Richard and Anna Sears, who had built a Mediterranean Revival Style villa on the site in 1928. As Dexter expanded, the school continued the style of the white stucco fa√ßade and red terra-cotta roof of the Sears House. Today, the original house remains the central structure on campus and houses the Senior Lounge, Business Office and Admissions Office. In preparation for the school‚Äôs move in 1968, the A building, Fisk Hall, and pool and gymnasium were built to the west of the Sears House. The Thorndike Hockey rink was added to the campus in 1973. From its long tradition as a boy‚Äôs lower school, Dexter has undergone a vast transformation over the last 25 years. In the 1990s, further additions were made to the campus including the construction of the Mid-Rise and original lower school building. In 1992, the Southfield School was established on the same campus to expand Dexter‚Äôs educational philosophy to young girls. In 2002, the Upper School was established to enable both the Dexter and Southfield schools to continue the school‚Äôs mission into the competitive secondary school market. The Clay Center was also constructed to the east of the Sears House greatly altering the school campus. The new center included a new auditorium, dining hall and fifth floor observatory. In 2011 Mr. and Mrs. William Phinney, who had led the school since 1964, and oversaw its move and expansion, retired after 47 years at the school. In 2013, the school was rededicated as the Dexter Southfield School, after received formal accreditation from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) Today, Dexter Southfield students offers single-sex classrooms in Pre-K through 8 and co-education in grades 9 through 12.  Campus  The 36-acre campus on the Boston-Brookline border included buildings such as Fiske Hall and the Sears Building grace the campus. Of particular note is the Clay Center for Science and Technology which provided students with classroom opportunities as well as an astronomical observatory.  Academics  Dexter Southfield School's curriculum includes arts as painting, wood shop, choir, and much more. Beginning in Kindergarten 2, each homeroom does one public speaking event per year. Starting in sixth grade, every student takes Latin through eighth grade. When in seventh grade, each student takes Latin and a modern language. Every student in the 7th and 8th grades is required to take a language and all students take six classes in grade 8. In the high school, there are approximately fifteen AP courses offering anything from AP Physics to AP European History to AP Latin. There are also honors and normal level classes for most courses. There were many upper class electives in history, English, and science. Dexter Southfield's Sears House  Athletics  Dexter's Varsity Tennis in 2012 was in NEPSAC Class A and beat teams like Phillips Andover and Phillips Exeter and advanced to the semifinals of the Class A tournament. The Varsity Hockey team is year after year one of the strongest in New England competing against teams like Cushing, Nobles, Exeter, KUA, and St. Pauls. The Varsity Hockey, Lacrosse, Tennis, Football, and Baseball teams have all had many athletes continue their careers at the Division 1 level of NCAA sports.

Also, Dexter Day is held during October is essentially the schools homecoming as both the varsity football and soccer teams have home games where many students, faculty, alumni, and fans come out on a Saturday to support the school. Field Day was held in May where students K‚Äì8 compete in track and field events such as cross country, sprints, long jump, high jump, relay races, and many more. Also, every boy in grades 3‚Äì6 are assigned to either the Massasoit or Mohawk team for intramural sports. Prize Day was the last day of the school year for students K‚Äì8. In the high school, traditions such as the Fall Pep Rally before Dexter Day and Senior Prank Day have brought much fun to the community. Every Wednesday morning, each student in grades 6‚Äì12 met in Fiske Hall for a chapel procedure. Grades 1‚Äì5 met on Friday mornings for the chapel procedure. There are Bible readings, an inspirational story was told by a student, and the school prayers. Each student would sings along with song cards. Notable alumni * John F.

In March 1918 the U.S. Navy acquired her from the Pacific Steamship Company of Seattle, Washington, placing her in commission later in that month as USS Yale (ID-1672). USS Yale served between March 1918 and September 1919. During World War I, the ship made 31 round-trip voyages transporting troops between Britain and France. Yale was decommissioned in early September 1919 and, in June 1920, sold for commercial operation along the Pacific Coast between San Francisco and Los Angeles.  World War II  After 15 years of fast passenger service along the West Coast, Yale was laid up in 1935; in 1940 the national emergency resulting from the outbreak of World War II in Europe brought her back into use. She was used this time as a dormitory ship in Alaskan waters. The United States Navy again acquired her in April 1943 and in August she was commissioned as USS Greyhound (IX-106) on 8 August 1943 with Lieutenant Commander W. N. VanDenburgh in command. She was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the greyhound, a breed of tall, slender, swift hound with a narrow pointed head. After brief service Greyhound decommissioned on 31 March 1944, and began duty as a floating barracks for personnel at various Puget Sound training schools. She was placed out of service on 9 March 1948 and her name was struck 18 June 1948. She was turned over to the Maritime Commission 12 November 1948 and placed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Olympia, Washington until 5 June 1949 when she was sold for scrapping. She departed Olympia on 13 July 1949, towed by the Red Stack tug Hercules, bound for the Walter W. Johnson Company scrap yard at Stockton, California, where she was due to arrive 18 July.

The Dams are managed by the Sydney Catchment Authority. Water in this scheme may be supplemented from the Fish River Scheme. Cascade Dams There are three dams built on the Cascade Creek, near Katoomba, known as Cascade numbers 1, 2 and 3. The Middle Dam was first, completed in 1908. It is tall; long; and holds . The Lower Cascade Dam is an earthfill embankment dam with a central concrete core which was completed in 1926. It is high; long; and holds . The Upper Cascade Dam is another earthfill embankment dam, built in 1938. It is high; long; and it holds . Middle Cascade Dam is a \\"Darley-Wade\\" dam named after the series of dams designed by L.A.B Wade, a prominent dam engineer of the era and CW Darley who designed the first constant radius thin-arch dam in Australia (Lithgow 1). It was originally constructed in 1908 as a buttress section before being raised to a constant radius arch dam to satisfy the increasing water demand of the area. Stage 1, known originally as \\"Katoomba Dam\\" was a curved buttress dam built to a height of 7.6m. The dam was built with every intent for future raising. The dam was raised by filling in the spaces of the buttresses with concrete. The right abutment consists of a gravity section to increase the effectiveness of the arch action and due to unsuitable foundations for an arch abutment. Lake Medlow and Greaves Creek Dams The heritage-listed Lake Medlow and Greaves Creek Dams were built on the Adams and Greaves Creeks respectively. Lake Medlow Dam was the first concrete thin arch, high stress dam built in New South Wales, and is one of the thinnest dams in the world. It is high; long; and holds .Sydney Catchment Authority.

Sydney Water decommissioned the Greaves Creek Treatment Plant. Woodford Creek Dam Woodford Creek Dam is a concrete arch dam which was built on the junction of Woodford Creek and Bulls Creek and completed in 1928. It was subsequently raised several times. It is high and long. Sydney Water no longer draws water from Woodford Dam. In late 2009 Woodford Dam surrounds were opened up to walkers and mountain bikers. Access to the dam wall and lake is still prohibited. Originally envisaged to supply steam trains, Woodford Dam is one of six dams constructed to supply water to the Blue Mountains area. Two raisings have occurred with the latest in 1947. Due to the closure of the Linden Water filtration Plant in circa 2000, the storage is no longer used for water supply and the outlet raw water pipework has been disconnected and capped. The first stage was constructed by NSW Railways between 1928 and 1929. Stage two raised the storage by 2.44m in 1935. The final third stage increased the storage by an additional 3.05m in 1947. Although rare, the storage has been used for rural firefighting by helicopters. The dam wall is an arch/gravity structure with keyed vertical contraction joints and copper waterstops.

The apostles were designated as such by Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion in the earlier half of the 20th century, and the list was included in The Bah√° º√≠ World, Vol. III (pp. 80‚Äì81). These individuals played a vital role in the development of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's Faith, consolidating its adherents and bringing its teachings around the world. To Bah√° º√≠s, they filled a similar role as the sons of Jacob, the apostles of Jesus, Muhammad's companions, or the B√°b's Letters of the Living. List of Apostles Many of the stories of the Apostles are well known to Bah√° º√≠s. The names of the apostles were: *M√≠rz√° M√∫s√° - The brother of Bah√° ºu'll√°h *Bad√≠ ª - The 17-year-old who delivered Bah√° ºu'll√°h's tablet to Nassiru'd-Din Shah and was subsequently killed. *Sult√°nu'sh-Shuhad√° º - The 'King of Martyrs' of Isfahan who was beheaded with his brother. *M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl - The famous scholar who travelled as far as America and wrote several notable books about the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. *Varq√° - The father of R√∫hu'll√°h. The two were killed at the same time for their adherence. *Nab√≠l-i- Akbar - Famous teacher, and recipient of several tablets from Bah√° ºu'll√°h. *Nab√≠l-i-A ªzam - The author of the historical narrative called The Dawn- breakers. *Mishk√≠n-Qalam - Noteworthy calligrapher of his time and designer of the Greatest Name. *Zaynu'l-Muqarrab√≠n - Doctor of Islamic law. He is the one who submitted questions to Bah√° ºu'll√°h regarding the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas, the Bah√° º√≠ book of laws, which have been published in an appendix to the book. *K√°zim-i- Samandar- The favourite Apostle of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. He travelled teaching the religion in Persia, the Lawh-i-Fu'√°d is addressed to him.Adib Taherzadeh, The Revelation of Baha'u'llah v 3, p. 88 *H√°j√≠ Am√≠n - Eminent follower of Bah√° ºu'll√°h who served as the trustee of Huq√∫qu'll√°h. *Ibn-i-Abhar - He traveled and taught about the religion in countries and regions of Iran, Caucasus, Turkmenistan and India. *Haj√≠ √Åkh√∫nd - He was given the task of transferring the remains of the B√°b from various secret locations to  ªAkk√°. He was responsible for much of the Bah√° º√≠ activity in Iran until his death. *Ad√≠b - After the passing of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, he became instrumental in dealing with the activities of Covenant-breakers in Iran. He later participated in the meetings that evolved into the Central Spiritual Assembly of Tihr√°n, which later became the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran, of which he was the chairman. He travelled to India and Burma to help spread the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in those areas. *M√≠rz√° Mustaf√° - Served the Baha'is travelling to Akk√° while living in Beirut on instructions of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. He also met some of the Bab's Letters of the Living. *Shaykh Muhammad-'Al√≠ - Nephew of Nab√≠l-i-Akbar. Traveled to India and later Haifa and taught about the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. He was later sent to Ishq√°b√°d by Abdu'l-Bah√° to take care of the education of children there. Along with other followers he helped in completing the unfinished writings of M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl. *Ibn-i-Asdaq - He was addressed by Bah√° ºu'll√°h as Shah√≠d Ibn-i- Shah√≠d (Martyr, son of the Martyr). He was the son of Mull√° S√°diq, a distinguished martyr of the B√°b√≠ movement. Along with Ahmad Yazdani, brought the Tablet to The Hague from  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° to the Central Organisation for Durable Peace in The Hague. He was one of the few Apostles to live into the time of Shoghi Effendi as the Guardian. *M√≠rz√° Mahm√∫d - He was a well known teacher of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, often dedicating himself to the welfare of the youth. *Vak√≠lu'd-Dawlih - He was an Afn√°n, a cousin of the B√°b and the chief builder of the first Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Ishq√°b√°d which was initiated by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in or about 1902. Tablets of the Divine Plan  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° addresses the Bah√° º√≠s of the United States and Canada in the Tablets of the Divine Plan with the phrase: \\"O ye Apostles of Bah√° ºu'll√°h!\\" He goes on to encourage them to \\"strive ye with heart and soul so that ye may reach this lofty and exalted position\\". He outlines certain conditions for this attainment, namely firmness in the Covenant of God, fellowship and love amongst the believers, and continually travelling to all parts of the continent, \\"nay, rather, to all parts of the world\\". Shoghi Effendi referred to Martha Root as \\"that unique and great-hearted apostle of Bah√° ºu'll√°h\\", but she is not considered one of the nineteen Apostles designated as such by Shoghi Effendi.

Biography = Early life= Born of Armenian parents on April 14, 1911, in K√ºtahya, Western Anatolia, Ottoman Empire, Zorthian escaped through Europe with the remnants of his family after two waves of political massacres, and arrived in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1923. He earned a Master of Fine Arts at Yale University (where he had a \\"full college scholarship to the Yale School of fine arts\\")Zorthian Ranch - History and studied art in Italy in the 1930s. Returning to the United States during the Great Depression, he painted several massive murals, including 11 for the Tennessee State Capitol in 1938 which earned him the honorary title of \\"Colonel\\". In 1940, he painted the mural at the United States Post Office in St. Johnsville, New York titled \\"Early St. Johnsville Pioneers.\\" =World War II= During World War II, he served stateside in army intelligence and painted what he came to consider his masterpiece‚Äîa mural he titled The Phantasmagoria of Military Intelligence Training. His first marriage, to shaving cream heiress Betty Williams, ended in divorce but he gained the first acres of the Altadena ranch where he lived from 1945 until his death. =Friendship with Richard Feynman= Zorthian is known among physicists for his friendship with Richard Phillips Feynman, Nobel Prize winning physicist. They met at a party where Feynman played bongos: Zorthian removed his shirt and made funny designs on his own chest with available materials. Zorthian and Feynman's attempts to teach each other physics and art respectively are described in Feynman's autobiography Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!. Zorthian's work Zorthian, who earned his own kaleidoscopic descriptives as the last bohemian, a rustic latter-day Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec or an ongoing work of performance art, died on January 6, 2004 of congestive heart failure. The nonagenarian's paintings, primarily of nude women that he said expressed \\"every man's fantasy,\\" sold for tens of thousands of dollars. But Zorthian was perhaps better known in Southern California art circles for his free-form lifestyle than for his prodigious art. Each spring during the last decade of his life he threw a primavera birthday party, dubbing himself Zor-Bacchus, wearing a toga over long red underwear, and nibbling grapes from the hands of nude, garlanded nymphs (many of which were his artist models). Zorthian joined the nymphs in dancing to the pipes of a cavorting Pan garbed in furry goat leggings. Alcohol flowed freely and a roasted pig fed hundreds of guests who could include scientists, movie stars, internationally known artists, writers and musicians and ordinary people. July 15, 1952, Zorthian hosted a legendary party on his ranch, where Charlie Parker played, a woman performed a strip tease atop a rocking horse, and other riled-up guests tore their clothes off. The diminutive Armenian-American was friends with jazzman Charlie Parker, artist Andy Warhol and Nobel-winning physicist Richard Feynman. The ranch served as a haven of bohemian life and a backdrop for items of Zorthian's artistic expression‚Äîsalvaged wood, bed springs, rusted vehicles, broken concrete, beer bottles, old shoes and other junk he could recycle into various sculptures and architecture. Zorthian called the ranch The Center for Research and Development with an Emphasis on Aesthetics, and fashioned rental houses out of discarded items including telephone poles and railroad ties. He also built rock walls, towers, inlaid bridges and walkways. He painted in a studio and bred horses for his horse ring. Zorthian and his wife, Dabney (March 21, 1933 ‚Äì May 10, 2006), lived in a small pseudo-brick house on the ranch, well loved by friends as welcoming although very cluttered. The couple often preferred to sleep outdoors. They slaughtered their own livestock and made their own sausage, milked their own goats and made cheese, raised their own vegetables and gathered eggs from their chickens. As a young immigrant, Zorthian had been startled by how wasteful Americans seemed and vowed to recycle everything he could and to create his own self-sufficient environment, a trait he shared with rival/fellow castle-builder Michael Rubel. Proudly, Zorthian offered his own down-to-earth appraisal of his art ranch for the Los Angeles Times in 1990: \\"This entire property has sort of been sculpted with a skip-loader. I have 40 more years of work. I don't have time to die. ... A lot of people my age have given up being curious or vital. Can you imagine me in a retirement home playing shuffleboard?\\" Zorthian was equally at home attending posh art events in a tuxedo as in digging through restaurant trash cans for recyclable objects. He chaired the Pasadena Art Fair in 1954 and 1955 and staged a show of his work at what was then the Pasadena Art Museum in 1953.

Kerner received a Bachelor of Laws from Lake Forest College in 1905. He was in private practice of law in Chicago from 1905 to 1915. In 1911, Kerner was one of incorporators of the Bohemian Lawyers Association of Chicago. From 1915 to 1927, Kerner was a master in chancery of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. In 1927, he became a Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County and in 1931 he became a Judge of the Illinois Appellate Court. In 1932, Kerner became Attorney General of Illinois, a position he held until 1938. He was a member of the Democratic Party. =Legal opinions in regards to the repeal of prohibition= As Illinois Attorney General, Kerner clarified the confusion as to whether liquor could be legally sold in Illinois following the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, and subsequent repeal of Prohibition, in December 1933. Kerner opined that the state statute governing the sale of 3.2 percent beer had nothing to do with the sale of liquor and other beverages of more than 3.2 percent after Repeal. As a result of Kerner's opinion, local breweries in Chicago announced that ales, stouts, and porters as strong as 4 and 5 percent would be placed on sale.

He served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, rising to the rank of major general. He was present at the Battle of Fort Sumter. He commanded the Union troops at the Battle of Olustee, the only major Civil War battle fought in Florida. Early life and career Seymour was born in Burlington, Vermont. The son of a Methodist minister, he attended Norwich University, beginning in 1840. After spending two years at Norwich, Seymour received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He graduated in 1846, ranked nineteenth in a class of fifty- nine graduates. West Point's Class of 1846 stands as one of the most illustrious in the academy's storied history with George McClellan, Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, Jesse Lee Reno, Darius Couch, George Stoneman, Samuel Sturgis, David Rumph Jones, and George Pickett among its members. After graduating, Seymour was assigned to the 1st U.S. Artillery. He immediately began his military service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. During that war, he was brevetted captain for his performance in the battles of Contreras and Churubusco and was promoted to first lieutenant six days later. After returning to the United States following the war, he became an assistant professor of drawing at West Point from 1850 to 1853 and fought against the Seminoles in Florida from 1856 to 1858. He was promoted to captain on November 22, 1860. Robert Walter Weir, Portrait of Truman Seymour, ca 1852 Civil War In the months that led up to the Civil War Seymour served under Col. John L. Gardner at Fort Moultrie getting it prepared for the imminent war. When the Civil War began in 1861, Seymour commanded an artillery company in the defense against the Confederate assault on Fort Sumter, after which he received the brevet of major. Major Seymour commanded the 5th Regiment of Artillery and the U.S. Camp of Instruction at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, from December 1861 to March 1862. He was Chief of Artillery for General George A. McCall's division of Pennsylvania Reserves from March 6, 1862, until July 25, 1862. On April 5, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Seymour for appointment to the grade of brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from April 28, 1862, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on that date.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 727. The appointment was made official on April 30, 1862. Seymour served in the Army of the Potomac's V Corps during the Peninsula Campaign of April-July 1862. He commanded the left wing of the Reserves at Mechanicsville on June 26, Gaines' Mill on June 27, Glendale on June 30 and led the division at Malvern Hill on July 1 after McCall was captured at the Battle of Glendale. After the Peninsula Campaign, the Pennsylvania Reserves joined the III Corps of the Army of Virginia, later I Corps in the Army of the Potomac. Seymour performed well at the battles of Second Bull Run, South Mountain, and Antietam in the latter half of 1862, especially in his brigade's capture of Frosttown Gap, Maryland, on September 14. Seymour took command of the Reserves after Brig. Gen. George G. Meade became acting corps commander. He received the brevet from the regular army of lieutenant colonel after South Mountain and that of colonel after Antietam. After November 18, 1862, General Seymour was sent to the Department of the South where he served as chief of staff to the commanding general from January 8 to April 23, 1863. He led a division on Folly Island, South Carolina, on July 4, participated in the attack on Morris Island on July 10, and commanded the unsuccessful attack on Fort Wagner on July 18. Seymour gained notoriety for this controversial attack. He had placed the famous 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the black regiment about which the 1989 film \\"Glory\\" was made, in the vanguard of what most thought would be a feckless attack. He was also seriously wounded by grapeshot there and saw little field duty for the rest of 1863. =The Battle of Olustee= Maj. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore, commanding general of the Department of the South, placed Seymour in charge of the newly created District of Florida. The division made an expedition to Florida in February 1864, landing at and taking possession of Jacksonville. Subsequently, Gillmore returned to South Carolina and left Seymour in tactical command. On February 20, Seymour's force of about 5,500 men met a Confederate force of about 5,000, commanded by Brigadier General Joseph Finegan. The battle took place near the town of Olustee, about 40 miles west of Jacksonville. The ensuing battle produced some of the heaviest losses, by percentage, of any major battle of the war. Although Seymour's division inflicted nearly 1,000 casualties, it received nearly 2,000 in return. General Seymour's force returned, defeated, to Jacksonville, where Union troops retained control until the war ended. =The last year of the war= After Olustee, General Seymour retained command of the District of Florida until March 28, 1864. He then returned to Virginia and led Robert H. Milroy's former brigade as part of the Third Division of VI Corps in the Battle of the Wilderness that May. He was captured there in a flank attack by Brig. Gen. John B. Gordon, as was Brig. Gen. Alexander Shaler. After his exchange on August 9, Seymour took command of the Third Division of VI Corps, after James B. Ricketts was wounded, in the last stages of the Shenandoah Valley and the final battles of Petersburg, the Sayler's Creek, and the Appomattox Campaign. He was present at General Robert E. Lee's surrender on April 9, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Seymour for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865 and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 714. On April 10, 1866, President Johnson nominated Seymour for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general United States Army (Regular Army (United States)), to rank from March 13, 1865, and the Senate confirmed the appointment on May 4, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 737. Postbellum career Seymour was mustered out of the volunteers on August 24, 1865 but stayed in the Regular United States Army. He served again in the 5th Artillery, and later commanded forts in Florida; Fort Warren, Massachusetts (1869‚Äì70); and Fort Preble, Maine (1870‚Äì75). He retired from the army on November 1, 1876. He received the degree of A.M. from Williams College in 1865. Seymour spent his retirement in Europe and died while living in Florence, Italy. He was buried there in the Cimitero Evangelico degli Allori. Seymour was also a watercolor painter, and his painting became prolific in Europe during his retirement. Although he is believed to have never sold his paintings, his body of work survives in museums and private collections.

The Roman de Fergus is an Arthurian romance written in Old French probably at the very beginning of the 13th century, by a very well educated author who named himself Guillaume le Clerc (William the Clerk). The main character is Fergus, the son of Soumilloit (a name corresponding to Sorley or Somerled; ), a rich but old-fashioned farmer and a noble Arthurian woman who rises to become the best knight of King Arthur. Historical background If the Roman is based upon a historical figure, it is probably Fergus of Galloway. The Roman has been upheld by many modern critics for its highly sophisticated use of parody, parody directed at the whole genre of Arthurian romance. It had been suggested by earlier scholars such as Dominicia Legge that the work was produced under the patronage of Alan, Lord of Galloway, but this idea is now rejected by most scholars, for a variety of reasons, including the Roman's satirisation of Fergus (Alan's great-grandfather). Recently, it has been proposed by D.D.R. Owen that it was written for the entertainment of the Scottish court of William I, and that the author was none other than William Malveisin, a royal clerk who rose to hold both the Bishopric of Glasgow and St Andrews. Also noted by scholars is the Roman's extensive knowledge of the geography of southern Scotland, which is in general depicted in an exceedingly accurate manner. This is in contrast to most other works of the genre, in which geography is vague and unrealistic. Some scholars hold that the Roman satirises native Scottish society. Soumilloit is wealthy enough to own a fortress, but he is low-born and the fortress is made only of wood. Moreover, his son Fergus works on the farm. Fergus' character is stumbling. Although valiant, he frequently transgresses the etiquette that the Francophone aristocratic society took for granted. The Roman could be the first piece of non-Celtic vernacular literature to have survived from Scotland, an honour often thought to belong to the Brus of John Barbour, written one and a half centuries later in Middle English. It has been neglected in Scotland mainly because it did not come to the attention of scholars until relatively recently, being preserved only in Continental Europe. The other reason for neglect is probably that it was written in French, a linguistic-literary tradition which died out by the later Middle Ages. The Roman de Fergus however shows that, despite its future, French- culture flourished in Scotland during the High Middle Ages. Plot The story begins with a stag hunt. Beginning in Carlisle, King Arthur and his knights chase a great white stag, which eludes them until Percival finally captures it in Galloway. At this point, Fergus, working the land in the service of his father, spots the knights and is inspired by them. Fergus persuades his father to give him a suit of armour, so that he can follow after the knights and join them. Fergus makes his way to Carlisle, killing two bandits on the way, whose heads he brings to the king. Arriving at court, he is mocked by Kay, the seneschal. Kay challenges Fergus to prove his worth by, among other things, defeating the king's bitter enemy, the Black Knight; Fergus accepts. After being taught knightly arts by the daughter of the royal Chamberlain, he is knighted by Arthur and receives encouragement and a sword from Percival and Gawain. Dunnottar Castle in the Mearns occupies one of the finest fort- locations in Great Britain. The site is one of the most important locations in the Roman de Fergus. Following his introduction to chivalry, Fergus makes his way to Liddel Castle, where he first encounters Galiene, the niece of the castellan. She declares her love for him, but he only promises to return after he has fulfilled his quest. Having vanquished the Black Knight, Fergus returns, only to find that Galiene has disappeared. At this point, the magic of love hits Fergus. He searches for her in vain for a year, until he meets a dwarf who tells him that he will retrieve his lost love if he can obtain a shield from a hag in Dunnottar Castle. With renewed hope, Fergus makes his way to Queensferry, to cross from \\"England\\" into \\"Scotland\\"; however, he gets into a dispute with the boatmen, dispatches them all, and is forced to sail himself over. Upon reaching Dunnotar, Fergus slays the guardian of the shield, and returns to Lothian. It is then that he is told that Galiene is the new ruler of Lothian, but is besieged in Roxburgh by a neighbouring king. On the way to Roxburgh, he is waylaid at Melrose by the husband of the hag-dragon he dispatched at Dunnottar. Emerging victorious, Fergus takes up residence in Melrose, and from there wreaks havoc on the army. He defeats some of its greatest knights, but this is not enough to lift the siege. After a while, the king sends his nephew Arthofilaus to demand that Galiene surrender the castle. She refuses, but they agree that if she can find a suitable knight, they will settle the dispute by single combat. Galiene soon regrets the deal, as she is unable to find a willing candidate among her men. She therefore sends her attendant, Arondele, to request a knight from Arthur at Carlisle. However, Arthur is unable to provide one because all of his knights are out searching for Fergus. Dejected, Arondele heads back to her mistress. On the way, she passes Melrose and relates the story to Fergus, before returning to Roxburgh. News of the attendant's failure brings Galiene to grief, because the combat must take place the following day. When the time arrives, Galiene prepares to throw herself from the castle tower. However, she catches sight of a shining shield in the distance. The mysterious knight slays Arthofilaus, and the king gives up his claim to Lothian. It is then that Galiene learns the identity of the knight, her lost love Fergus. By then, however, he had already departed. Back at Carlisle, King Arthur learns of the events and pardons the defeated king. Arthur decides personally to set out in search of Fergus, but Gawain counsels that he has a better chance of finding him if he hosts a tournament. The tournament is arranged at Jedburgh, and the prize is Queen Galiene and her kingdom. During the week-long tournament, Fergus remains invincible, defeating, among others, Kay, Lancelot and the Black Knight. It is after this that Fergus and Galiene are united in marriage, and Fergus becomes King of Lothian. Roman van Ferguut In the middle of the thirteenth century, the Roman was translated and adapted into Middle Dutch as the Roman van Ferguut. The first part of the Roman was translated from French fairly accurately, but the second part, possibly the work of another author, was much more loosely derived. The Ferguut today has wide fame as a Dutch classic, certainly more fame than the Roman de Fergus possesses in either Scotland or France. It has recently been translated into English by an American scholar. References * Guillaume le Clerc, Fergus of Galloway, tr. D.D.R. Owen, (London, 1991). * Legge, M.

He was created by Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza. Gideon was a member of the Externals, a unique type of immortal mutant, and an adversary of the X-Men spin-off group X-Force. He first appeared in New Mutants #98 (Feb 1991).  Fictional character biography  Before Gideon's mutant powers emerged, he was a sailor with the Spanish armada sailing for the Americas several hundred years ago. On one journey, he succumbed to scurvy and was buried when the ship reached land. He awoke a few hours later, discovering his immortality. Over several centuries, Gideon was able to amass a vast personal wealth. He also encountered and allied himself with several other Externals. He became the owner and CEO of Ophrah Industries in Denver, Colorado. At the end of the 20th century, the group began seeking out their newest member, whom Gideon erroneously believed to be Roberto da Costa, a young mutant who had joined the New Mutants, the junior division of the X-Men, and taken the codename Sunspot. Gideon had known Roberto from a young age, having business relations with his father, a wealthy Brazilian businessman. Gideon had his servant Eve poison Roberto's father Emmanuel, and Gideon approached the boy, telling him he needed to take over his family's business. He took the young boy in under his wing and began to mentor him.New Mutants #98-99 Gideon later had AIM recreate Proteus.New Mutants Annual #7; New Warriors Annual #1; Uncanny X-Men Annual #15; X-Factor Annual #6 (1991) Gideon and Sunspot were later held captive by Arianna Jankos, Black Tom Cassidy, and Juggernaut.X-Force #1; Spider-Man #16 Gideon then publicly declared Cable and X-Force to be criminals.X-Force #5 When the young superheroes known as the New Warriors broke into his home while he was taking a bath in his Jacuzzi, Gideon defeated them in an impromptu skirmish with their combined abilities. He then brutally tortured them to discover their agenda and to vent his frustration over their impetuousness.New Warriors #19 Gideon mentored Sunspot for a short while, until it was discovered that not Sunspot but his New Mutants teammate and best friend, Samuel Guthrie (a.k.a. Cannonball) was the new External they had been seeking. Gideon met with the other Externals, and proposed to send Crule to capture Cannonball.X-Force #10 He contacted Crule, and then gave Sunspot over to one of his scientific labs, where they experimented on him and augmented his powers (at the great risk of killing him). Gideon forced Cannonball to promise not to interfere with External affairs in return for Sunspot's life.X-Force #12-13, 15 Gideon attempted a hostile takeover of Genetech and the Taylor Foundation, but was thwarted by Night Thrasher and was defeated by him in physical combat.Night Thrasher: Four Control #3 Gideon witnessed the External Nicodemus's death.X-Force #20 Gideon was then offered a position with HYDRA, but refused and battled a HYDRA strike force. He was aided in defeating them by Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD Vol. 2 #46-47 Gideon was attacked and captured by X-Force, who then rescued Boomer, Siryn, and Warpath.X-Force #23 All of the Externals were eventually killed (except for Cannonball); Gideon was not spared and was killed by the energy vampire, Selene.X-Force #52 Gideon mysteriously appeared alive and well in the not too distant future, working beside Ahab against fellow External Cannonball (who was briefly killed by Ahab in the same issue).Cable #71 Later while investigating a disturbance in the timestream caused by the premature death of Candra, Cable travels back in time and discovers that Selene's attack on the other Externals did not work as they thought, and that they were actually alive but being targeted by some unknown assailant. Cable travels to Gideon's location and learns that he is still in stasis, recovering from Selene's attack. Cable is confronted by the mysterious murderer, a time travelling Gideon himself, who reveals that he spent 3,000 years in stasis and when he woke up, humanity had changed considerably. Deciding to prevent this outcome, Gideon traveled back in time to kill his fellow companions.Cable #152  Powers and abilities Gideon is a mutant who has the ability of Super Human Enhancement Assimilation: the power to temporarily endow himself with the super powers of any beings in his proximity, whether they are a superhuman, android, or mechanical battlesuit. He scans and replicates his target's energy signatures and genetic templates, granting him a full understanding of the potential applications of the powers he acquires and enabling him to overwhelm an opponent with a superior mastery of their own powers. Gideon was an External, meaning his aging process is greatly slowed and that he can apparently regenerate injured or missing cells from even near-fatal injuries. He was granted with limited immortality, only ended by an extremely mortal wound such as losing the limbs, by the Legacy Virus (two Externals died by this method) or, in the case of his death, by a draining of the life energies. Gideon is an extraordinary business strategist. He wears body armor, and has access to androids, advanced vehicles, and other advanced technology developed by Ophrah Industries. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= In the alternate reality known as the Age of Apocalypse, Gideon was drafted to be one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. Gideon, alongside Sabretooth, Candra, Death and War, planned to fire nuclear missiles at Cape Citadel. Gideon was selected to hack the computer system and fire the missiles. He was interrupted by Magneto, who he nearly defeated, until Magneto drew upon the Earth's magnetic field to overload Gideon's powers, apparently killing him.X-Men Chronicles #1 (1995) References External links *Gideon at the Marvel Universe *UncannyXmen.net Character Profile on Gideon Category:Characters created by Fabian Nicieza Category:Characters created by Rob Liefeld Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991 Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional Spanish people Category:Marvel Comics mutants Category:Marvel Comics supervillains ","title":"Gideon (comics)"},{"id":"3930251","text":"Westside Neighborhood School is a private independent school serving preschool through eighth grade, located in the west side of Los Angeles, California.

It was developed by Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment (CME) in association with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and would have been published by FireSky for Microsoft Windows. The game's setting was based on the military science fiction series Stargate SG-1. The game was to focus on a premise set around an ancient device called the \\"Stargate\\". In 2006, both CME and MGM announced the release of a video game set in the Stargate Universe. In 2008, FireSky announced its participation in the process of releasing Stargate Worlds. On March 25, 2010, FireSky announced on their website that CME/CMG had entered receivership. As a result, production on the game ceased. The estimated release date was never revealed before cancellation. The license agreement between CME and MGM expired on November 16, 2010, and the Stargate: Resistance servers shut down on January 15, 2011. In 2012 it was reported that development was canceled with at least two investor lawsuits filed against the former chairman and CEO of CME, Gary Whiting, and other former executives. Development CME and MGM announced in February 2006 that work had begun on a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). CME released several concept art images from Stargate Worlds in late 2006 along with announcing the use of Unreal Engine 3.0. This was also the first public release on the Stargate Worlds computer-generated art. In November, 2006 CME announced that Stargate Worlds had moved from pre-production to enter the production phase of the games development. To celebrate this, they released new images for the game. The showrunners of Stargate SG-1 have been closely connected with the Stargate Worlds project including co-creator Brad Wright serving as a games creative consultant. Developer Chris Klug in an interview said that creating a game out of the Stargate Universe was easy because of the \\"breadth of content.\\" Development progress for the game was reported to have slowed down drastically because of the Great Recession of 2007. FireSky had struck a deal with Convergys Corporation (CVG), which is a corporation leading in global relationship management. The company would provide the state-of-the- art customer support services for Stargate Worlds, to give the gamers their \\"best\\" gaming experience \\"ever\\". In 2009, in an interview with GateWorld, Wright said he had doubts if the game would be released at all. Marketing manager from FireSky announced that the game was still in development, even if people said otherwise. He further stated that they were arranging deals to cover their financial responsibilities and fund the remainder of development of the video game. Registrations were accepted for a closed beta version, with participants to be drawn randomly from the pool of registrants. Registration was limited to those aged 18 and over. On February 12, 2010, CME filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with development on hold. The Stargate Worlds project was cancelled. Setting Stargate Worlds was based on the popular science fiction show Stargate SG-1. The game was to take place in the earlier seasons of the show, before the Atlantis expedition and before the Ori story arc. At release, the game would have revolved around the Milky Way Galaxy during the storyline of the ongoing conflict between the Tau'ri and the Goa'uld. Playable races were shown to include Tau'ri, Goa'uld, Jaffa, and the Asgard. The combat was designed to incorporate some elements that are familiar to players of first person shooters, with players using an array of ranged weaponry of both earth and alien origin. Combat would have emphasized tactics to defeat opponents both AI and human controlled. The AI was being designed to provide players with a significant challenge, to the praise of many critics. =Archetypes= The archetypes in the game were designed to fit with the modern ranged-weapon combat system of the game. According to the developers there would be no specific healer class in the game, and all archetypes would have the ability to be a medic, although some archetypes would be better than others at healing and reviving. Specialization within the different archetypes would lead to more flexibility within a group. A robust tech tree would make each archetype that much more customizable and replayable. The archetypes of Stargate Worlds, would according to the developers be \\"flexible\\" in their abilities and usage. Each archetype would have three specialization trees which would define a particular play style over time, although players would be able to mix and match skills from these. No end game instance would need a particular class to be successful. With the game unreleased, major development was still being worked on with different archetypes that would be a subject to change. Both the scientist and the archaeologist would have specialized in non-combat gameplay with various types of puzzles to solve and gain access to new advances. In addition, there were likely to be quests specifically for those and other archetypes. Each archetype would have its own starting area. In addition to learning how to play the archetype, this starting zone would also give the player a backstory that comes from the first six seasons of Stargate SG-1. *Archaeologists (Daniel Jackson archetype) would specialize in ancient cultures and languages. They would be able to 'blend in with the locals' to gather intelligence or ambush the enemy. This 'blending in' uses Asgard holographic technology to assume the appearance of others. It was assumed that the archaeologist would also be able to engage in diplomacy, something discussed by the developers previously. Archaeologists could also be quite adept in aggro management, perhaps by being superb negotiators or good at hiding, making them good solo characters, in addition to their ability to solve puzzles. *Asgard would be physically frail, but would be masters of technology and would have a strong science ability. They depend on clone technology to survive and thrive. By calling upon different types of drones to attack, defend, heal, or analyze, the Asgard would be a true jack-of-all- trades. When faced with dire circumstances, the Asgard could also bring in their mighty starships to devastate the enemy with orbital bombardments in the form of a special attack. By being able to fit into a number of different roles, it was assumed the Asgard would choose their 'class' by specializing in a different type of drone technology. The Asgard would be a faction-specific class, thus there would not be any \\"evil\\" Asgard until the Atlantis Expansion was released. *Goa'uld would gain much of their power from their servants. With the ability to command several different types of minions, the Goa'uld could become almost as versatile as the Asgard. These minions would include Jaffa and possibly human servants.An Audio Podcast: Developer Q&A; Part 1 ‚Äì June 29, 2007 In addition to their minions, Goa'ulds also have access to poisons that can be used to cripple enemies. They can also specialize in Ashrak technologies, such as phase cloaking, becoming masters of stealthy attacks. As the evil counterparts to the Asgard, the Goa'uld may be able to call in their Ha'tak bombers to bombard the enemy as a special attack. The Goa'uld character would be the symbiote and would at times and at a \\"cost\\" be able to choose to enter a new host. However player Goa'uld would not be able to take over other players' hosts. *Jaffa (Teal'c archetype) in the game were much like the Jaffa in the show. In addition to its devastating ranged attack, the Jaffa staff weapon could also be used in melee combat. Displaying solidarity and teamwork, Jaffa could use their oaths to strengthen their allies, especially other Jaffa. With their physical strength, Jaffa were assumed to be highly resistant to special attacks and could continue fighting even when injured. *Scientists (Samantha \\"Sam\\" Carter archetype) would be a combination of pure scientist and engineer. Scientists could specialize in analyzing, repairing, and using technologies. They could also use new technologies to craft personal upgrades. Their battlefield utility came from the ability to construct devices such as gun turrets, shields, and target inhibitors. They could also specialize in healing and resurrection technology. Like the archaeologist, the scientist could also solve puzzles, but of a technological nature. These puzzles would be in the form of minigames. *Soldiers (Jonathan \\"Jack\\" O'Neill archetype) is valuable for protection when stepping through the stargate. With the ability to specialize in a variety of weapons, including grenades, automatic weapons, machine guns, mortars, and rocket launchers, their job was to unleash firepower on enemies. With additional training, they could also learn basic healing, how to use alien weaponry, and lead teams. *Commando class would give up access to the variety of weapons a soldier class uses, a commando class gaining access to stealth, demolitions, and the sniper rifle. The commando could disrupt, confuse, and neutralize enemies. In addition to ability with stealth, commandos would also have technology to detect stealthed enemies. The commando would be at least one of the archetypes able to deploy and detect traps.  Appearances in other media  Footage from the game was used in the opening sequence of the 2008 film WarGames: The Dead Code. Game footage is shown in the pilot episode of Stargate Universe when Eli enters the Ancient code in the online game Prometheis.

They come in many forms, most commonly associated with children's school work assignments, tax forms, and accounting or other business environments. Software is increasingly taking over the paper-based worksheet. It can be a printed page that a child completes with a writing instrument. No other materials are needed. It is \\"a sheet of paper on which work schedules, working time, special instructions, etc. are recorded. A piece or scrap of paper on which problems, ideas, or the like, are set down in tentative form.\\" In education, a worksheet may have questions for students and places to record answers. In accounting, a worksheet is, or was, a sheet of ruled paper with rows and columns on which an accountant could record information or perform calculations. These are often called columnar pads, and typically green-tinted. In computing, spreadsheet software presents, on a computer monitor, a user interface that resembles one or more paper accounting worksheets. Microsoft Excel, a popular spreadsheet program, refers to a single spreadsheet (more technically, a two-dimensional matrix or array) as a worksheet, and it refers to a collection of worksheets as a workbook.  Education  In the classroom setting, worksheets usually refer to a loose sheet of paper with questions or exercises for students to complete and record answers. They are used, to some degree, in most subjects, and have widespread use in the math curriculum where there are two major types. The first type of math worksheet contains a collection of similar math problems or exercises. These are intended to help a student become proficient in a particular mathematical skill that was taught to them in class. They are commonly given to students as homework. The second type of math worksheet is intended to introduce new topics, and are often completed in the classroom. They are made up of a progressive set of questions that leads to an understanding of the topic to be learned. Worksheets are important because those are individual activities and parents also need it. They (parents) get to know what the child is doing in the school. With evolving curricula, parents may not have the necessary education to guide their students through homework or provide additional support at home. Having a worksheet template easily accessible can help with furthering learning at home. Overall, research in early childhood education shows that worksheets are recommended mainly for assessment purposes. Worksheets should not be used for teaching as this is not developmentally appropriate for the education of young students. As an assessment tool, worksheets can be used by teachers to understand students‚Äô previous knowledge, outcome of learning, and the process of learning; at the same time, they can be used to enable students to monitor the progress of their own learning. Worksheet generators are often used to develop the type of worksheets that contain a collection of similar problems. A worksheet generator is a software program that quickly generates a collection of problems, particularly in mathematics or numeracy. Such software is often used by teachers to make classroom materials and tests. Worksheet generators may be loaded on local computers or accessed via a website. There are also many worksheet generators that are available online. However, original worksheets can be made on applications such as word or powerpoint.  Accounting  In accounting, a worksheet often refers to a loose leaf piece of stationery from a columnar pad, as opposed to one that has been bound into a physical ledger book. From this, the term was extended to designate a single, two-dimensional array of data within a computerized spreadsheet program. Common types of worksheets used in business include financial statements, such as profit and loss reports. Analysts, investors, and accountants track a company's financial statements, balance sheets, and other data on worksheets. In spreadsheet programs like Microsoft's Excel or the open source LibreOffice Calc, a single document is known as a 'workbook' and may have by default three arrays or 'worksheets'. One advantage of such programs is that they can contain formulae so that if one cell value is changed, the entire document is automatically updated, based on those formulae.  Taxes  Many tax forms require complex calculations and table references to calculate a key value, or may require supplemental information that is only relevant in some cases. Rather than incorporating the calculations into the main form, they are often offloaded on a separate worksheet. The worksheet may be incorporated into the filing package, or may only be a tool for the filer to figure out the value, but without requiring the worksheet to be filed. As an example, in the United States, income tax is withheld from the payments made by employers to employees. If taxes are significantly underwithheld, there is a penalty to the employee at the end of the year, and if they are overwitheld, the employee gets a refund for the overpayment of taxes. There is a basic formula for estimating the taxes that need to be paid, but various tax factors may cause it to be wrong, such as dependents, tax deductions, or income from other sources. The W-4 form allows the employee to pick an exemption level to reduce the tax factoring (to avoid overpayment), or specify an extra amount above the standard number (to avoid underpayment). The form comes with two worksheets, one to calculate exemptions, and another to calculate the effects of other income (second job, spouse's job). The bottom number in each worksheet is used to fill out two if the lines in the main W4 form. The main form is filed with the employer, and the worksheets are discarded or held by the employee.

DeBartolo.http://ech.case.edu/ech- cgi/article.pl?id=DDSI The stores continued to operate under the Higbee name until 1992, when DeBartolo sold his shares to his partners and the chain was re-branded as Dillard's.Remembering Great American Department Stores, www.dshistory.com History Higbee's was founded by Edwin Converse Higbee and John G. Hower on September 10, 1860 as Higbee & Hower Dry Goods. The first day of business saw $100 in sales. It was reorganized as The Higbee Co. in 1902 after the death of Mr. Hower and relocated from its original Public Square location to a new five-story Playhouse Square Center store, directly across from its sworn arch-rival Halle Brothers Co. In 1929 it was acquired by the Van Sweringen brothers, who moved the store to their new $179 million Terminal Tower complex on Public Square, partly in response to pleas from women who wished to occupy homes in their new suburb of Shaker Heights and ride the Vans' new railroads into the city for quality shopping. The store subsequently went bankrupt in 1935 as the Van Sweringen empire collapsed in the Great Depression, but thanks to store executives Charles P. Bradley and John Murphy, the company was reorganized and flourished under their guidance for many years. The 1960s and 1970s saw the addition of several stores in suburbs as well as expansion to Akron and Canton, all under the watch of president Herbert Strawbridge, who also saw the value of giving new life to The Flats district in Downtown Cleveland. In 1984, Industrial Equity Ltd, a subsidiary of Brierly Investments Ltd, New Zealand, acquired Higbee's, selling it three years later to a joint venture of Dillard's and Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. who planned to combine Higbee's with an intended acquisition of Horne's. The deal was cancelled abruptly, resulting in several years of litigation. In 1992 Dillard's bought out DeBartolo's shares and rebadged Higbee's and five of the Northern Ohio Horne's stores with its name.

It shares the same zinc finger 2 and zinc finger 3 of Zif268, but differs in the sequence of finger 1. It also shares the same DNA target, 5'-GCGTGGGCG-3'. The shared sequences in single letter amino acid codes of fingers 2 and 3 are RSD-H-LTT and RAD-E-RKR (positions -1 through 6 in the alpha helix). Zinc finger 1 has the sequence KSA-D-LKR which provides a 13-fold increase in affinity to the target sequence of the entire ZFP over that of Zif268. It is used in zinc finger investigations in which the amino acid sequence of finger 2 is changed in order to determine the appropriate sequence to target a given three- nucleotide target site. A variation of C7, C7.GAT is preferred since it lacks the aspartic acid residue present in finger 3 of C7 and known to cause a phenomenon called 'target site overlap'. In this case the target site overlap is a result of the aspartic acid residue forming a hydrogen bond with the N4 of the cytosine (in the opposite strand) base-paired to the guanine in the finger 2 subsite. It can also form the same hydrogen bond with an adenine base paired to a thymine. This target site overlap would dictate that either a cytosine or adenine residue be present as the 3' nucleotide in the finger 2 subsite which is unacceptable when looking to target sequences containing another nucleotide at this position.

Early life Born in Lausanne, Switzerland, M√©traux spent much of his childhood in Argentina where his father was a well-known surgeon resident in Mendoza. His mother was a Georgian from Tbilisi. He received his secondary and university education in Europe, at the Classical Gymnasium of Lausanne, the √âcole nationale des chartes in Paris, the √âcole nationale des langues Orientales (Diplome, 1925). The √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes (Dipl√¥me, 1927) and the Sorbonne (Docteur √®s lettres, 1928). He also studied in Sweden, in Gothenburg's University and did research at the well-equipped local anthropological museum. Among his teachers were Marcel Mauss, Paul Rivet, and Erland Nordenski√∂ld. While he was still a student he entered into correspondence with Father John Cooper who introduced him to the American school of cultural anthropology. It is said that Father Cooper did not realize at first that his scholarly correspondent was only 19 and 20 years old. They actually met much later, when M√©traux came to the United States; but Father Cooper seems to have had considerable influence on Alfred M√©traux's thought. M√©traux combined in his work the best of both the European and the American tradition of historical anthropology. Early career M√©traux's professional career was equally cosmopolitan. His interest for anthropology and original languages, began early in his life when his father a medical doctor took an overseas appointment, relocating his family from Lausanne Switzerland to Mendoza Argentina. During his research years in Argentina, his work was centred in the study and interpretation of native languages, allowing him to create an extensive record of Argentine native ethnic groups, including: Calchaqu√≠, Guaran√≠, Chiriguano, Toba & Wich√≠s, and the Uros-Chipaya. While working on this research, he was invited to collaborate in the writing of the Handbook of South American Indians. Eventually, he founded and became the first director (1928 ‚Äì 1934) of the Institute of Ethnology at the University of Tucuman, in Argentina. During this period, he also published an article for the Universidad Nacional De la Plata Museo of Argentina called \\"Mitos y cuentos de los Indios Chiriguano\\" Myths and Stories of the Chiriguano Indians. In 1934-35, he led a French expedition to Easter Island, and in 1936 ‚Äì38, he was a Fellow of the Bishop Museum in Honolulu. In 1939, he returned to Argentina and Bolivia for field research on a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1940, upon his return to the United States from South America, he was in residence at Yale University with a renewal of his Guggenheim Fellowship. That next year, he worked with the Cross Cultural Survey (now the Human Relations Area Files) on South American data and was associated with such people as John Dollard, Leonard Bloomfield, and others of the Institute of Human Relations. In 1941, he joined the staff of the Bureau of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution. There, from 1941 to 1945, he played an important role in producing the monumental Handbook of South American Indians. Perhaps no other writer contributed as many pages to this work. As the editor, Julian Steward, acknowledges, \\"The extent of his (M√©traux's) contribution is by no means indicated by the large number of articles appearing under his name. With an unsurpassed knowledge of South American ethnology and ever generous of his time, his advice and help to the editor and contributors alike have been a major factor in the successful completion of the work.\\" (Vol. I, p. 9). In addition, M√©traux taught briefly at University of California, Berkeley (1938), the Escuela Nacional de Antropolog√≠a, Mexico (1943), the Colegio de Mexico (1943), and the Faculdad Latino-Americana de Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile (1959‚Äì60). UNESCO In the early spring of 1945, M√©traux went to Europe as a member of the United States Bombing Survey and he saw the physical and moral desolation of Europe. Although he had by then become a citizen of the United States, this experience seems to have reaffirmed, in a way, his traditional ties with Europe. It also strengthened his belief in the necessity for European unity and for the need of a firm basis for international, inter-cultural, and inter-racial understanding. His early view of war devastated Europe was important in his decision in 1946 to take a post on the secretariat of the United Nations. Thus, from 1946 until 1962, he worked for his ideals of international and inter-cultural understanding within the framework of international organization with only occasional excursions into academic life and into anthropological field research. In 1946 and 1947, he was a member of the Department of Social Affairs of the United Nations, but in 1947 he was assigned to UNESCO, and finally, in 1950, he became a permanent member of UNESCO's Department of Social Science. As an international civil servant, he served the world and his profession well. He took part in the Hylean Amazon project in 1947-1948, led the UNESCO Marbial Valley (Haiti) anthropological survey from 1948 to 1950 with personnel from the international Labor Office, and studied the internal migrations of the Aymara and Quechua Indians in Peru and Bolivia (1954). He edited the series of pamphlets on The Race Question and Modern Thought and The Race Question and Modern Science, published by UNESCO since 1950. He also organized the research that led to a series of volumes on race relations in Brazil, such as \\"As rela√ß√µes raciais entre negros a brancos em S√£o Paulo,\\" edited by Roger Bastide and Florestan Fernandes (S√£o Paulo, 1955), Race and Class in Rural Brazil, edited by Charles Wagley (UNESCO, Paris, 1952), and others. At UNESCO, he was responsible for the participation of anthropologists in many important projects around the world, and he consistently emphasized the anthropological point of view in all of the many programs with which he was associated. Anthropology lost not only a productive scholar, but an effective translator of anthropological theory and knowledge into action. Ethnography M√©traux valued field ethnography more than theory. He let the facts speak for themselves, and many of his facts modified anthropological theory. Yet, one felt that he was too restless and too eager to be on his way to produce detailed and lengthy field reports such as those of Curt Nimuendaj√∫ on the Brazilian G√™. He was a sensitive field worker with many years of experience, and his articles on the Argentine Chaco and his book on Haitian Vodun indicate that he gathered careful and objective data in the field. He liked to think of himself as a field ethnologist. Any evening with him led to stories of nights around a fire with Argentine gauchos, his last stay with the semi-pacified Kayapo of Brazil, his period of residence on Easter Island, a Haitian voodoo ceremony, or a Candombl√© ceremony in Bahia which he had attended with his friend Pierre Verger. Accomplishments M√©traux published landmark studies of South American Indians including the Incas, Haitian voodoo and the ancient cultures of Easter Island. He participated in the framing of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and later as director of the Dept. of Social Sciences at [UNESCO], he presided over a series of studies which resulted in several publications aiming to prove the absence of scientific foundation to theories of racial superiority. The 1951 UNESCO Statement on the Nature of Race and Race Differences enshrined these findings. A dedicated anthropologist and humanitarian, he brought the brilliance of South American Indian cultures to light, solved the mysteries of Easter Island, taught the world about Voodoo, and defined the United Nations' stand against racism. His books include Voodoo, The History of the Incas and Easter Island. Alfred M√©traux took his own life by an overdose of barbiturates.KronoBase On 20 April 1963, Alfred M√©traux's corpse was discovered near the Chateaux de la Madeleine in the Vallee de Chevreuse about 30 km outside of Paris.Steven R. Fischer - Rongorongo: The Easter Island Script : History, Traditions, Texts At the time of his death, he was Professor of South American Anthropology at the √âcole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Paris. Personal life M√©traux was married three times. Each of his wives was in a different way a scientific collaborator. His first wife, Eva Spiro M√©traux, translated anthropological materials from English to French. His second wife, Rhoda Bubendey M√©traux did research with him in Mexico, Argentina, and Haiti and was a well known anthropologist.

Noam Chomsky describes himself as an anarcho-syndicalist and libertarian socialist, and is considered to be a key intellectual figure within the left wing of politics of the United States.  Political views  Chomsky speaking with Bolivian Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera Chomsky is often described as one of the best-known figures of the American left, although he doesn't agree with the usage of the term. He has described himself as a \\"fellow traveller\\" to the anarchist tradition, and refers to himself as a libertarian socialist, a political philosophy he summarizes as challenging all forms of authority and attempting to eliminate them if they are unjustified for which the burden of proof is solely upon those who attempt to exert power. He identifies with the labor-oriented anarcho-syndicalist current of anarchism in particular cases, and is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. He also exhibits some favor for the libertarian socialist vision of participatory economics,'Suggested Reading from Noam Chomsky Retrieved 2012-3-31 himself being a member of the Interim Committee for the International Organization for a Participatory Society.'International Organization for a Participatory Society ‚Äì Interim Committee Retrieved 2012-3-31 He believes that libertarian socialist values exemplify the rational and morally consistent extension of original unreconstructed classical liberal and radical humanist ideas in an industrial context. Chomsky has further defined himself as having held Zionist beliefs, although he notes that his definition of Zionism would be considered by most as anti-Zionism these days, the result of what he perceives to have been a shift (since the 1940s) in the meaning of Zionism (Chomsky Reader). Chomsky is considered \\"one of the most influential left-wing critics of American foreign policy\\" by the Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers. = Freedom of speech = Chomsky has taken strong stands against censorship and for freedom of speech, even for views he personally condemns. He has stated that \\"with regard to freedom of speech there are basically two positions: you defend it vigorously for views you hate, or you reject it and prefer Stalinist/fascist standards\\". = On terrorism = In response to US declarations of a \\"War on Terrorism\\" in 1981 and the redeclaration in 2001, Chomsky has argued that the major sources of international terrorism are the world's major powers, led by the United States government. He uses a definition of terrorism from a US army manual, which defines it as \\"the calculated use of violence or threat of violence to attain goals that are political, religious, or ideological in nature. This is done through intimidation, coercion, or instilling fear.\\"US Army Operational Concept for Terrorism Counteraction_ (TRADOC Pamphlet No. 525-37), 1984. In relation to the US invasion of Afghanistan he stated: On the efficacy of terrorism: As regards support for condemnation of terrorism, Chomsky opines that terrorism (and violence/authority in general) is generally bad and can only be justified in those cases where it is clear that greater terrorism (or violence, or abuse of authority) is thus avoided. In a debate on the legitimacy of political violence in 1967, Chomsky argued that the \\"terror\\" of the Vietnam National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) was not justified, but that terror could in theory be justified under certain circumstances: Chomsky believes that acts he considers terrorism carried out by the US government do not pass this test, and condemnation of United States foreign policy is one of the main thrusts of his writings which he has explained is because he lives in the United States, and thus holds a responsibility for his country's actions. = Criticism of United States government = Chomsky has been a consistent and outspoken critic of the United States government, and criticism of the foreign policy of the United States has formed the basis of much of his political writing. Chomsky gives reasons for directing his activist efforts to the state of which he is a citizen. He believes that his work can have more impact when directed at his own government, and that he holds a responsibility as a member of a particular country of origin to work to stop that country from committing crimes. He expresses this idea often with a comparison of other countries holding that every country has flexibility to address crimes by unfavored countries, but is always unwilling to deal with their own. Speaking in Nicaragua in 1986, Chomsky was asked \\"We feel that through what you say and write you are our friend but at the same time you talk about North American imperialism and Russian imperialism in the same breath. I ask you how you can use the same arguments as reactionaries?\\" to which Chomsky responded, He also contends that the United States, as the world's remaining superpower, acts in the same offensive ways as all superpowers. One of the key things superpowers do, Chomsky argues, is try to organize the world according to the interests of their establishment, using military and economic means. Chomsky has repeatedly emphasized that the overall framework of US foreign policy can be explained by the domestic dominance of US business interests and a drive to secure the state capitalist system. Those interests set the political agenda and the economic goals that aim primarily at US economic dominance. His conclusion is that a consistent part of the United States' foreign policy is based on stemming the \\"threat of a good example.\\" This 'threat' refers to the possibility that a country could successfully develop outside the US-managed global system, thus presenting a model for other countries, including countries in which the United States has strong economic interests. This, Chomsky says, has prompted the United States to repeatedly intervene to quell \\"independent development, regardless of ideology\\" in regions of the world where it has little economic or safety interests. In one of his works, What Uncle Sam Really Wants, Chomsky argues that this particular explanation accounts in part for the United States' interventions in Guatemala, Laos, Nicaragua, and Grenada, countries that pose no military threat to the US and have economic resources that are not important to the US establishment. Chomsky claims that the US government's Cold War policies were not primarily shaped by anti-Soviet paranoia, but rather toward preserving the United States' ideological and economic dominance in the world. In his book Deterring Democracy he argues that the conventional understanding of the Cold War as a confrontation of two superpowers is an \\"ideological construct.\\" He insists that to truly understand the Cold War one must examine the underlying motives of the major powers. Those underlying motives can only be discovered by analyzing the domestic politics, especially the goals of the domestic elites in each country: Chomsky says the US economic system is primarily a state capitalist system, in which public funds are used to research and develop pioneering technology (the computer, the internet, radar, the jet plane etc.) largely in the form of defense spending, and once developed and mature these technologies are turned over to the corporate sector where civilian uses are developed for private control and profit.Z Magazine February 1993, \\"The Pentagon System\\" Chomsky often expresses his admiration for the civil liberties enjoyed by US citizens. According to Chomsky, other Western democracies such as France and Canada are less liberal in their defense of controversial speech than the US. However, he does not credit the American government for these freedoms but rather mass social movements in the United States that fought for them. The movements he most often credits are the abolitionist movement, the movements for workers' rights and trade union organization, and the fight for African-American civil rights. Chomsky is often sharply critical of other governments who suppress free speech, most controversially in the Faurisson affair but also of the suppression of free speech in Turkey. At the fifth annual Edward W. Said Memorial Lecture hosted by the Heyman Center for the Humanities in December 2009, Chomsky began his speech on \\"The Unipolar Moment and the Culture of Imperialism\\" by applauding Edward Said for calling attention to America's \\"culture of imperialism\\". When the US establishment celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 2009, Chomsky said this commemoration ignored a forgotten human rights violation that occurred only one week after that event. On November 16, 1989, the US-armed Atlacatl Battalion in El Salvador assassinated six leading Latin American Jesuit priests, he explained. He contrasted the US' \\"self-congratulation\\" of the Berlin Wall destruction with the \\"resounding silence\\" that surrounds the assassination of these priests, contending that the US sacrifices democratic principles for its own self-interest, and without any self-criticism it tends to \\"focus a laser light on the crimes of enemies, but crucially we make sure to never look at ourselves.\\"Claire Luchette \\"Chomsky speaks on U.S. imperialism ‚Äì Noam Chomsky delivered the Edward W. Said Memorial Lecture to a packed crowd on Thursday\\" The Columbia Spectator, December 4, 2009Noam Chomsky discusses religion and terrorism, April 23, 2010 =Criticism of United States democracy= Chomsky maintains that a nation is only democratic to the degree that government policy reflects informed public opinion. He notes that the US does have formal democratic structures, but they are dysfunctional. He argues that presidential elections are funded by concentrations of private power and orchestrated by the public relations industry, focusing discussion primarily on the qualities and the image of a candidate rather than on issues. Chomsky makes reference to several studies of public opinion by pollsters such as Gallup and Zogby and by academic sources such as the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland (PIPA). Quoting polls taken near the 2004 election, Chomsky points out that only a small minority of voters said they voted because of the candidate's \\"agendas/ideas/platforms/goals.\\" Furthermore, studies show that the majority of Americans have a stance on domestic issues such as guaranteed health care that is not represented by either major party. Chomsky has contrasted US elections with elections in countries such as Spain, Bolivia, and Brazil, where he claims people are far better informed on important issues. = Views on tactical voting in the United States = Since the 2000 election, with regards to third-party voting, Chomsky has maintained \\"if it's a swing state, keep the worst guys out. If it's another state, do what you feel like.\\" When asked if he voted in the 2008 election, he responded:  Views on Trump and Biden in 2020  In an interview for The Intercept, Mehdi Hasan asked Chomsky \\"What do you make of the 'Never Biden' movement?\\" Chomsky answered = Views on globalization = Chomsky made early efforts to critically analyze globalization. He summarized the process with the phrase \\"old wine, new bottles\\", maintaining that the motive of the elites is the same as always: they seek to isolate the general population from important decision-making processes, the difference being that the centers of power are now transnational corporations and supranational banks. Chomsky argues that transnational corporate power is \\"developing its own governing institutions\\" reflective of their global reach.Old Wine, New Bottles According to Chomsky, a primary ploy has been the co-opting of the global economic institutions established at the end of World War II, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which have increasingly adhered to the \\"Washington Consensus\\", requiring developing countries to adhere to limits on spending and make structural adjustments that often involve cutbacks in social and welfare programs. IMF aid and loans are normally contingent upon such reforms. Chomsky claims that the construction of global institutions and agreements such as the World Trade Organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the Multilateral Agreement on Investment constitute new ways of securing √©lite privileges while undermining democracy.Notes of NAFTA: The Masters of Man Chomsky believes that these austere and neoliberal measures ensure that poorer countries merely fulfill a service role by providing cheap labor, raw materials and investment opportunities for the developed world. Additionally, this means that corporations can threaten to relocate to poorer countries, and Chomsky sees this as a powerful weapon to keep workers in richer countries in line. Chomsky takes issue with the terms used in discourse on globalization, beginning with the term \\"globalization\\" itself, which he maintains refers to a corporate- sponsored economic integration rather than being a general term for things becoming international. He dislikes the term anti-globalization being used to describe what he regards as a movement for globalization of social and environmental justice. Chomsky understands what is popularly called \\"free trade\\" as a \\"mixture of liberalization and protection designed by the principal architects of policy in the service of their interests, which happen to be whatever they are in any particular period.\\" In his writings, Chomsky has drawn attention to globalization resistance movements. He described Zapatista defiance of NAFTA in his essay \\"The Zapatista Uprising.\\" He also criticized the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, and reported on the activist efforts that led to its defeat. Chomsky's voice was an important part of the critics who provided the theoretical backbone for the disparate groups who united for the demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in Seattle in November 1999. = Views on socialism and communism = Chomsky is deeply critical of what he calls the \\"corporate state capitalism\\" that he believes is practiced by the United States and other Western states. He supports many of Mikhail Bakunin's anarchist (or libertarian socialist) ideas. Chomsky has identified Bakunin's comments regarding the totalitarian state as predictions for the brutal Soviet police state that would come in essays like The Soviet Union Versus Socialism. He has also defined Soviet communism as \\"fake socialism\\", particularly because any socialism worthy of the name requires authentic democratic control of production and resources as well as public ownership. He has said that contrary to what many in America claim, the collapse of the Soviet Union should be regarded as \\"a small victory for socialism\\", not capitalism.Soviet Union Versus Socialism Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Chomsky explicitly condemned Soviet imperialism; for example in 1986 during a question/answer following a lecture he gave at Universidad Centroamericana in Nicaragua, when challenged by an audience member about how he could \\"talk about North American imperialism and Russian imperialism in the same breath\\", Chomsky responded: \\"One of the truths about the world is that there are two superpowers, one a huge power which happens to have its boot on your neck, another, a smaller power which happens to have its boot on other people's necks. And I think that anyone in the Third World would be making a grave error if they succumbed to illusions about these matters.\\" Chomsky was also impressed with socialism as practiced in Vietnam. In a speech given in Hanoi on April 13, 1970, and broadcast by Radio Hanoi the next day, Chomsky spoke of his \\"admiration for the people of Vietnam who have been able to defend themselves against the ferocious attack, and at the same time take great strides forward toward the socialist society.\\" Chomsky praised the North Vietnamese for their efforts in building material prosperity, social justice, and cultural progress. He also went on to discuss and support the political writing of L√™ Du·∫©n.-Pacific Daily Report of the U.S. government's Foreign Broadcast Information Service, April 16, 1970, pages K2-K3 In his 1973 book For Reasons of State, Chomsky argues that instead of a capitalist system in which people are \\"wage slaves\\" or an authoritarian system in which decisions are made by a centralized committee, a society could function with no paid labor. He argues that a nation's populace should be free to pursue jobs of their choosing. People will be free to do as they like, and the work they voluntarily choose will be both \\"rewarding in itself\\" and \\"socially useful.\\" Society would be run under a system of peaceful anarchism, with no state or other authoritarian institutions. Work that was fundamentally distasteful to all, if any existed, would be distributed equally among everyone.Chomsky explains anarchism (5 parts): 1 2 3 4 5 Chomsky was always critical of the Soviet Union. In a 2016 interview he said that Mao's revolution in China was responsible for \\"a huge death toll, in the tens of millions\\" during the Great Leap Forward; but he also gave the revolution credit for saving 100 million lives between 1949 and 1979 through rural health and development programs.Truth-out.org interview with C.J.Polychroniou, 17/7/16 In 1960s, Chomsky noted what he considered to be grassroots elements within both Chinese and Vietnamese communism. In December 1967, during a forum in New York, Chomsky responded to criticisms of the Chinese revolution as follows, \\"I don't feel that they deserve a blanket condemnation at all. There are many things to object to in any society. But take China, modern China; one also finds many things that are really quite admirable.\\" Chomsky continued: \\"There are even better examples than China. But I do think that China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting positive things happened at the local level, in which a good deal of the collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step.\\" He said of Vietnam: \\"Although there appears to be a high degree of democratic participation at the village and regional levels, still major planning is highly centralized in the hands of the state authorities.\\" In the context of remarks on the topic of peak oil in April 2005, Chomsky stated: \\"China is probably the most polluted country in the world ‚Äì you can't see. It's kind of a totalitarian state, so they kind of force it on people, but the level of pollution is awful, and India too. Still in per-capita terms, the U.S. is way above anybody else, and we don't do anything about it.\\" =Views on Marxism= Chomsky is critical of Marxism's dogmatic strains, and the idea of Marxism itself, but still appreciates Marx's contributions to political thought. Unlike some anarchists, Chomsky does not consider Bolshevism \\"Marxism in practice\\", but he does recognize that Marx was a complicated figure who had conflicting ideas; while he acknowledges the latent authoritarianism in Marx he also points to the libertarian strains which developed into the council communism of Rosa Luxemburg and Pannekoek. His commitment to libertarian socialism however has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings. =Views on anarchism= In practice Chomsky has tended to emphasize the philosophical tendency of anarchism to criticize all forms of illegitimate authority. He has been reticent about theorizing an anarchist society in detail, although he has outlined its likely value systems and institutional framework in broad terms. According to Chomsky, the variety of anarchism which he favors is: On the question of the government of political and economic institutions, Chomsky has consistently emphasized the importance of grassroots democratic forms. Accordingly, current Anglo-American institutions of representative democracy \\"would be criticized by an anarchist of this school on two grounds. First of all because there is a monopoly of power centralized in the state, and secondly ‚Äì and critically ‚Äì because the representative democracy is limited to the political sphere and in no serious way encroaches on the economic sphere.\\"\\"The Relevance of Anarcho-syndicalism\\", Noam Chomsky interviewed by Peter Jay, The Jay Interview, July 25, 1976. Chomsky believes anarchism is a direct descendant of liberalism, perfecting the ideals of personal liberty and minimal government of the Enlightenment.Chomsky on Anarchism, AK Press, 2005. He views libertarian socialism thus as the logical conclusion of liberalism, extending its democratic ideals into the economy, making anarchism an inherently socialist philosophy. =Views on American libertarianism= Noam Chomsky has described libertarianism, as it is understood in the United States, as, \\"extreme advocation of total tyranny\\" and \\"the extreme opposite of what's been called libertarian in every other part of the world since the Enlightenment.\\", Noam Chomsky speech, February 5, 2008. =Views on the welfare state= Chomsky is scathing in his opposition to the view that anarchism is inconsistent with support for \\"welfare state\\" measures, stating in part that = Mass media analysis = Another focus of Chomsky's political work has been an analysis of mainstream mass media (especially in the United States), which he accuses of maintaining constraints on dialogue so as to promote the interests of corporations and the government. Edward S. Herman and Chomsky's book Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media explores this topic and presents their \\"propaganda model\\" hypothesis as a basis to understand the news media with several case studies to support it. According to their propaganda model, more democratic societies like the U.S. use subtle, non-violent means of control, unlike totalitarian societies, where physical force can readily be used to coerce the general population. Chomsky asserts that \\"propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state\\" (Media Control). The model attempts to explain such a systemic bias in terms of structural economic causes rather than a conspiracy of people. It argues the bias derives from five \\"filters\\" that all published news must pass through which combine to systematically distort news coverage. # The first filter, ownership, notes that most major media outlets are owned by large corporations. # The second, funding, notes that the outlets derive the majority of their funding from advertising, not readers. Thus, since they are profit-oriented businesses selling a product ‚Äì readers and audiences ‚Äì to other businesses (advertisers), the model would expect them to publish news which would reflect the desires and values of those businesses. # In addition, the news media are dependent on government institutions and major businesses with strong biases as sources (the third filter) for much of their information. # Flak, the fourth filter, refers to the various pressure groups which go after the media for supposed bias and so on when they go out of line. # Norms, the fifth filter, refer to the common conceptions shared by those in the profession of journalism.In the original text, published in 1988, the fifth filter was \\"anticommunism\\". However, with the fall of the Soviet Union, it has been broadened to allow for shifts in public opinion. The model therefore attempts to describe how the media form a decentralized and non- conspiratorial but nonetheless very powerful propaganda system that is able to mobilize an \\"√©lite\\" consensus, frame public debate within \\"√©lite\\" perspectives and at the same time give the appearance of democratic consent. = Views on the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn = In May 2017, Chomsky endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the forthcoming UK general election saying, \\"If I were a voter in Britain, I would vote for him [Jeremy Corbyn].\\" He claimed that Corbyn would be doing better in opinion polls if it was not for the \\"bitter\\" hostility of the mainstream media, he said, \\"If he had a fair treatment from the media ‚Äì that would make a big difference.\\" In November 2019, along with other public figures, Chomsky signed a letter supporting Corbyn describing him as \\"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\\" and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that \\"Labour's election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.\\" = Chomsky and the Middle East = Chomsky \\"grew up ... in the Jewish-Zionist cultural tradition\\" (Peck, p.11). His father was one of the foremost scholars of the Hebrew language and taught at a religious school. Chomsky has also had a long fascination with and involvement in Zionist politics. As he described: He is highly critical of the policies of Israel towards the Palestinians and its Arab neighbors. His book The Fateful Triangle is considered one of the premier texts on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict among those who oppose Israel's policies in regard to the Palestinians as well as American support for the state of Israel. He has also accused Israel of \\"guiding state terrorism\\" for selling weapons to apartheid South Africa and Latin American countries that he characterizes as U.S. puppet states, e.g. Guatemala in the 1980s, as well as U.S.-backed paramilitaries (or, according to Chomsky, terrorists) such as the Nicaraguan Contras. (What Uncle Sam Really Wants, Chapter 2.4) Chomsky characterizes Israel as a \\"mercenary state\\", \\"an Israeli Sparta\\", and a militarized dependency within a U.S. system of hegemony. He has also fiercely criticized sectors of the American Jewish community for their role in obtaining U.S. support, stating that \\"they should more properly be called 'supporters of the moral degeneration and ultimate destruction of Israel'\\" (Fateful Triangle, p. 4). He says of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL): In a 2004 interview with Jennifer Bleyer published The Ugly Planet, issue twopublish.nyc.indymedia.org  Noam Chomsky Interview and in Heeb magazine,Heeb: The Guilt Issue: Weapons of Mass Delusion Chomsky stated: In May 2013, Chomsky, along with other professors such as Malcolm Levitt, advised Stephen Hawking to boycott an Israeli conference. As a result of his views on the Middle East, Chomsky has been banned from entering Israel since 2010.Noam Chomsky Denied Entry To Israel AP, Posted: May 17, 2010 7:00 am EDT =Views on the Iraq War= Chomsky opposed the Iraq War for what he saw as its consequences for the international system, namely that the war perpetuated a system in which power and force trump diplomacy and law. He summarised this view in Hegemony or Survival, writing: = Views on antisemitism = In a 2004 interview with Jennifer Bleyer published in Ugly Planet, issue two and in Heeb Magazine, Chomsky engaged in the following exchange: =Views on the Cuban embargo= In February 2009, Chomsky described the publicly stated U.S. goal of bringing \\"democracy to the Cuban people\\" as \\"unusually vulgar propaganda\\". In Chomsky's view, the U.S. embargo of Cuba has actually achieved its stated purpose. The goal of the embargo according to Chomsky has been to implement \\"intensive U.S. terror operations\\" and \\"harsh economic warfare\\" in order to cause \\"rising discomfort among hungry Cubans\\" in the hope that out of desperation they would overthrow the regime. In lieu of this goal, Chomsky believes that \\"U.S. policy has achieved its actual goals\\" in causing \\"bitter suffering among Cubans, impeding economic development, and undermining moves towards more internal democracy.\\" In Chomsky's view, the real \\"threat of Cuba\\" is that successful independent development on the island might stimulate others who suffer from similar problems to follow the same course, thus causing the \\"system of U.S. domination\\" to unravel. =Turkish oppression of Kurds= Chomsky has been very critical of Turkey's policies in regards to their Kurdish population, while also denouncing the military aid given to the Turkish government by the United States. Such aid Chomsky states allowed Turkey during the 1990s to conduct \\"US-backed terrorist campaigns\\" in southeast Turkey, which Chomsky believes \\"rank among the most terrible crimes of the grisly 1990s\\", featuring \\"tens of thousands dead\\" and \\"every imaginable form of barbaric torture.\\"Human Rights Week 2002 by Noam Chomsky, ZNet, December 28, 2002 In 2016 he was one of the signatories of a petition of the Academics for Peace called ‚ÄúWe will not be a party to this crime!‚Äù demanding a peaceful solution for the Kurdish Turkish conflict. = Criticism of intellectual communities = Chomsky has at times been outspokenly critical of scholars and other public intellectuals; while his views sometimes place him at odds with individuals on particular points, he has also denounced intellectual sub-communities for what he sees as systemic failings. Chomsky sees two broad problems with academic intellectuals generally: # They largely function as a distinct class, and so distinguish themselves by using language inaccessible to people outside the academy, with more or less deliberately exclusionary effects. In Chomsky's view there is little reason to believe that academics are more inclined to engage in profound thought than other members of society and that the designation \\"intellectual\\" obscures the truth of the intellectual division of labour: \\"These are funny words actually, I mean being an 'intellectual' has almost nothing to do with working with your mind; these are two different things. My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more intellectual work as people in the universities. There are plenty of areas in academia where what's called 'scholarly' work is just clerical work, and I don't think clerical work's more challenging than fixing an automobile engine ‚Äì in fact, I think the opposite. ... So if by 'intellectual' you mean people who are using their minds, then it's all over society\\" (Understanding Power, p. 96). # The corollary of this argument is that the privileges enjoyed by intellectuals make them more ideologised and obedient than the rest of society: \\"If by 'intellectual' you mean people who are a special class who are in the business of imposing thoughts, and framing ideas for people in power, and telling everyone what they should believe, and so on, well, yeah, that's different. These people are called 'intellectuals' ‚Äì but they're really more a kind of secular priesthood, whose task is to uphold the doctrinal truths of the society. And the population should be anti-intellectual in that respect, I think that's a healthy reaction\\" (ibid, p. 96; this statement continues the previous quotation). Chomsky is elsewhere asked what \\"theoretical\\" tools he feels can be produced to provide a strong intellectual basis for challenging hegemonic power, and he replies: \\"if there is a body of theory, well tested and verified, that applies to the conduct of foreign affairs or the resolution of domestic or international conflict, its existence has been kept a well- guarded secret\\", despite much \\"pseudo-scientific posturing.\\" Chomsky's general preference is, therefore, to use plain language in speaking with a non-elite audience. The American Intellectual climate is the focus of \\"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\\", the essay which established Chomsky as one of the leading political philosophers in the second half of the 20th century. Chomsky's extensive criticisms of a new type of post-WW2 intellectual he saw arising in the United States were the focus of his book American Power and the New Mandarins. There he described what he saw as the betrayal of the duties of an intellectual to challenge received opinion. The \\"new Mandarins\\", who he saw as responsible in part for the Vietnam War, were apologists for United States as an imperial power; he wrote that their ideology demonstrated Chomsky has shown cynicism towards the credibility of postmodernism and poststructuralism. In particular he has criticised the Parisian intellectual community; the following disclaimer may be taken as indicative: \\"I wouldn't say this if I hadn't been explicitly asked for my opinion ‚Äì and if asked to back it up, I'm going to respond that I don't think it merits the time to do so\\" (ibid). Chomsky's lack of interest arises from what he sees as a combination of difficult language and limited intellectual or \\"real world\\" value, especially in Parisian academe: \\"Sometimes it gets kind of comical, say in post-modern discourse. Especially around Paris, it has become a comic strip, I mean it's all gibberish ... they try to decode it and see what is the actual meaning behind it, things that you could explain to an eight-year old child. There's nothing there.\\" (Chomsky on Anarchism, pg. 216). This is exacerbated, in his view, by the attention paid to academics by the French press: \\"in France if you're part of the intellectual elite and you cough, there's a front-page story in Le Monde. That's one of the reasons why French intellectual culture is so farcical ‚Äì it's like Hollywood\\" (Understanding Power, pg. 96). Chomsky made a 1971 appearance on Dutch television with Michel Foucault, the full text of which can be found in Foucault and his Interlocutors, Arnold Davidson (ed.), 1997 (). Of Foucault, Chomsky wrote that: =Views on the Sri Lanka conflict= Chomsky supports the Tamils' right to self-determination in Tamil Eelam, their homeland in the North and East of Sri Lanka. In a February 2009 interview, he said of the Tamil Eelam struggle: \\"Parts of Europe, for example, are moving towards more federal arrangements. In Spain, for example, Catalonia by now has a high degree of autonomy within the Spanish state. The Basque Country also has a high degree of autonomy. In England, Wales and Scotland in the United Kingdom are moving towards a form of autonomy and self- determination and I think there are similar developments throughout Europe. Though they're mixed with a lot of pros and cons, but by and large I think it is a generally healthy development. I mean, the people have different interests, different cultural backgrounds, different concerns, and there should be special arrangements to allow them to pursue their special interests and concerns in harmony with others.\\" In a September 2009 submitted Sri Lankan Crisis Statement, Chomsky was one of several signatories calling for full access to internment camps holding Tamils, the respect of international law concerning prisoners of war and media freedom, the condemnation of discrimination against Tamils by the state since independence from Britain, and to urge the international community to support and facilitate a political solution that addresses the self-determination aspirations of Tamils and protection of the human rights of all Sri Lankans. A major offensive against the Tamils in the Vanni region of their homeland in 2009 resulted in the deaths of at least 20,000 Tamil civilians in 5 months, amid widespread concerns war crimes were committed against the Tamil population. At a United Nations forum on R2P, the Responsibility to Protect doctrine established by the UN in 2005, Chomsky said: Chomsky was responding to a question that referred to Jan Egeland, former head of the UN's Humanitarian Affairs' earlier statement that R2P was a failure in Sri Lanka. =Views on the death penalty= Chomsky is a vocal advocate against the use of the death penalty. When asked his opinion on capital punishment in Secrets, Lies, and Democracy, he stated: He has commented on the use of the death penalty in Texas as well as other states. On August 26, 2011 he spoke out against the execution of Steven Woods in Texas. = Views on copyright and patents = Chomsky has criticized copyright laws as well as patent laws. On copyright he argued in a 2009 interview: On patents, he stated: = Views on MIT, military research and student protests = The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a major research center for US military technology. As Chomsky says: \\"[MIT] was a Pentagon-based university. And I was at a military-funded lab.\\"Noam Chomsky (1996). Class Warfare: Interviews with David Barsamian. Pluto Press. p. 102. Chomsky says, referring to the 1960s, that MIT was \\"about 90% Pentagon funded at that time. And I personally was right in the middle of it. I was in a military lab. If you take a look at my early publications, they all say something about Air Force, Navy, and so on, because I was in a military lab, the Research Lab for Electronics.\\" G.D. White (2000). Campus Inc.: Corporate power in the ivory tower. Prometheus Books. pp. 445-6. Having kept quiet about his anti-militarist views in the early years of his career at MIT, Chomsky became more vocal as the war in Vietnam intensified. For example, in 1968, he supported an attempt by MIT's students to give an army deserter sanctuary on campus.Michael Albert (2006). Remembering Tomorrow: From the politics of opposition to what we are for. Seven Stories Press. pp. 41-2. ; Robert F. Barsky (1998). Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent. MIT Press. p. 121. . He also gave lectures on radical politics. Throughout this period, MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam.Albert 2006, pp. 97-99 Jerome Wiesner, the military scientist who had initially employed Chomsky at MIT, also organised a group of researchers from MIT and elsewhere to devise a barrier of mines and cluster bombs between North and South Vietnam.N.Chomsky, Reflections on Language, p. 133; S.Bridger, Scientists at War. By his own account, back in the 1950s, Wiesner had \\"helped get the United States ballistic missile program established in the face of strong opposition\\". He then brought nuclear missile research to MIT ‚Äì work which, as Chomsky says \\"was developed right on the MIT campus.\\"Chicago Tribune, 29 June 1969, p. 24; D.Ball, Politics and Force Levels, The Strategic Missile Program of the Kennedy Administration, pp. 86, 110; J.Wiesner, 'War and Peace in the Nuclear Age; Bigger Bang for the Buck, A; Interview with Jerome Wiesner, [1]', WGBH Media Library & Archives. 2 mins; C.P. Otero (1988). Noam Chomsky: Language and politics. Black Rose. p. 247. Until 1965, much of this work was supervised by a Vice-President at MIT, General James McCormack, who had earlier played a significant role supervising the creation of the US's nuclear arsenal.The Tech, 21 October 1958, p. 2 and 20 October 1965, p. 1; Hewlett, R.G. and F. Duncan. 1972. Atomic Shield: A History of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Vol.2, 1947/1952. Washington: AEC., pp. 65, 172, 408-9, 548. Meanwhile, Professor Wiesner played an important advisory role in organising the US's nuclear command and control systems.Rebecca Slayton, Arguments that Count: Physics, Computing and Missile Defense, 1949-2012 (MIT Press 2013), pp. 47, 55-8, 66, 156, citing Jerome Wiesner, Warning and Defense in the Missile Age, June 1959 and ‚ÄòThe Gaither Report‚Äô, November 1957; Howard Murphy, The Early History of the MITRE Corporation: Its Background, Inception, and First Five Years, Vol.1, 1972, pp. 180-1, 199 and Ch. 7. Chomsky has rarely talked about the military research done at his own lab but the situation has been made clear elsewhere. In 1971, the US Army's Office of the Chief of Research and Development published a list of what it called just a \\"few examples\\" of the \\"many RLE research contributions that have had military applications\\". This list included: \\"helical antennas\\", \\"microwave filters\\", \\"missile guidance\\", \\"atomic clocks\\" and \\"communication theory\\".Army Research and Development News Magazine, Vol.12 no.4, July-August 1971, p. 68. Chomsky never produced anything that actually worked for the military. However, by 1963 he had become a \\"consultant\\" for the US Air Force's MITRE Corporation who were using his linguistic theories to support \\"the design and development of U.S. Air Force-supplied command and control systems.\\"Current Research and Development in Scientific Documentation, No. 10, 1962, pp. 301-2. The MITRE documents that refer to this consultancy work are quite clear that they intended to use Chomsky's theories in order to establish natural languages such as English \\"as an operational language for command and control\\".A. Zwicky and S. Isard, 'Some Aspects of Tree Theory', Working Paper W-6674, The MITRE Corporation, Bedford, MA, 1963, Foreword, last page; A. Newell in G. Bugliarello (ed.), Bioengineering: An Engineering View, 1968, p271. According to one of his students, Barbara Partee, who also worked on this project, the military justification for this was: \\"that in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program.\\"'When Chomsky Worked on Weapons Systems for the Pentagon'- by Chris Knight Chomsky's complicated attitude to MIT's military role was expressed in two letters published in the New York Review Books in 1967. In the first, he wrote that he had \\"given a good bit of thought to ... resigning from MIT, which is, more than any other university associated with the activities of the Department of 'Defense'.\\" He also stated that MIT's \\"involvement in the [Vietnam] war effort is tragic and indefensible.\\" Then, in the second letter written to clarify the first, Chomsky said that \\"MIT as an institution has no involvement in the war effort. Individuals at MIT, as elsewhere, have direct involvement and that is what I had in mind.\\"Chris Knight (2016). Decoding Chomsky; Science and revolutionary politics. Yale University Press. p. 37; The New York Review of Books, March 1967 and April 1967. Retrieved 2016-10-7.. By 1969, MIT's student activists were actively campaigning \\"to stop the war research\\" at MIT.Stephen Shalom, 'Review of Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent, by Robert F. Barsky' , New Politics, Vol.6(3), Issue 23. Retrieved 2016-10-7. Chomsky was sympathetic to the students but disagreed with their immediate aims. In opposition to the radical students, he argued that it was best to keep military research on campus rather than having it moved away. Against the students' campaign to close down all war-related research, he argued for restricting such research to \\"systems of a purely defensive and deterrent character\\".Barsky 1997, pp. 121-2, 140-1; Albert 2006, p. 98; Knight 2016, p. 34. MIT's student president at this time, Michael Albert, has described this position as, in effect, \\"preserving war research with modest amendments\\".Albert 2006, p. 98. During this period, MIT had six students sentenced to prison terms, prompting Chomsky to say that MIT's students suffered things that \\"should not have happened\\". Despite this, he has described MIT as \\"the freest and the most honest and has the best relations between faculty and students than at any other ... [with] quite a good record on civil liberties.\\"Albert 2006, pp. 107-8; Knight 2016, pp. 36-8, 249. Chomsky's differences with student activists at this time led to what he has called \\"considerable conflict\\". He described the rebellions across US campuses as \\"largely misguided\\" and he was unimpressed by the student uprising of May 1968 in Paris, saying, \\"I paid virtually no attention to what was going on in Paris as you can see from what I ‚Äì rightly, I think.\\"Barsky 1997, pp. 121-2, 131. On the other hand, Chomsky was also very grateful to the students for raising the issue of the war in Vietnam. Chomsky's particular interpretation of academic freedom led him to give support to some of MIT's more militaristic academics, even though he disagreed with their actions. For example, in 1969, when he heard that Walt Rostow, a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at the university, Chomsky threatened \\"to protest publicly\\" if Rostow was \\"denied a position at MIT.\\" In 1989, Chomsky then gave support to a long-standing Pentagon adviser, John Deutch, by backing his candidacy for President of MIT. Deutch was an influential advocate of both chemical and nuclear weapons and later became head of the CIA.Chemical and Engineering News, 60(1), February 1982, pp. 24‚Äì25; Scowcroft, B. 1983.

The New York Times quoted Chomsky as saying, \\"He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met in academic life, or any other life. ...

Chomsky's influence as a political activist  = Opposition to the Vietnam War = Chomsky became one of the most prominent opponents of the Vietnam War in February 1967, with the publication of his essay \\"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\\" in the New York Review of Books. Allen J. Matusow, \\"The Vietnam War, the Liberals, and the Overthrow of LBJ\\" (1984): A contemporary reaction came from New York University Professor of Philosophy Emeritus Raziel Abielson: Chomsky also participated in \\"resistance\\" activities, which he described in subsequent essays and letters published in the New York Review of Books: withholding half of his income tax, taking part in the 1967 march on the Pentagon, and spending a night in jail. In the spring of 1972, Chomsky testified on the origins of the war before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by J. William Fulbright. Chomsky's view of the war is different from orthodox anti-war opinion which holds the war as a tragic mistake. He argues that the war was a success from the US point of view. According to Chomsky's view the main aim of US policy was the destruction of the nationalist movements in the Vietnamese peasantry. In particular he argues that US attacks were not a defense of South Vietnam against the North but began directly in the early 1960s (covert US intervention from the 1950s) and at that time were mostly aimed at South Vietnam. He agrees with the view of orthodox historians that the US government was concerned about the possibility of a \\"domino effect\\" in South-East Asia. At this point Chomsky diverts from orthodox opinion ‚Äì he holds that the US government was not so concerned with the spread of state Communism and authoritarianism but rather of nationalist movements that would not be sufficiently subservient to US economic interests. =Doubting genocide in Cambodia= The Khmer Rouge (KR) communists took power in Cambodia in April 1975 and expelled all citizens of Western countries. The only sources of information about the country were a few thousand refugees who escaped to Thailand and the official pronouncements of the KR government. The refugees told stories of mass murders perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge and widespread starvation. Many leftist academics praised the Khmer Rouge and discounted the stories of the refugees. In July 1978, Chomsky and his collaborator, Edward S. Herman jumped into the controversy. Chomsky and Herman reviewed three books about Cambodia. Two of the books by John Barron (and Anthony Paul) and Fran√ßois Ponchaud were based on interviews with Cambodian refugees and concluded that the Khmer Rouge had killed or been responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians. The third book, by scholars Gareth Porter and George Hildebrand, described the KR in highly favorable terms. Chomsky and Herman called Barron and Paul's book \\"third rate propaganda\\" and part of a \\"vast and unprecedented propaganda campaign\\" against the KR. He said Ponchaud was \\"worth reading\\" but unreliable. Chomsky said that refugee stories of KR atrocities should be treated with great \\"care and caution\\" as no independent verification was available. By contrast, Chomsky was highly favorable toward the book by Porter and Hildebrand, which portrayed Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge as a \\"bucolic idyll.\\" Chomsky also opined that the documentation of Gareth Porter's book was superior to that of Ponchaud's, despite almost all of the references cited by Porter coming from Khmer Rouge documents while Ponchaud's came from speaking to Cambodian refugees.\\"An Exchange on Cambodia\\" New York Review of Books, July 20, 1978, http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1978/jul/20/an-exchange-on- cambodia/?pagination=false, accessed 25 May 2013 Chomsky and Herman later co- authored a book about Cambodia titled After the Cataclysm (1979), which appeared after the Khmer Rouge regime had been deposed. The book was described by Cambodian scholar Sophal Ear as \\"one of the most supportive books of the Khmer revolution\\" in which they \\"perform what amounts to a defense of the Khmer Rouge cloaked in an attack on the media\\".Sophal Ear \\"The Kymer Rouge Canon 1975-1979: The Standard Total Academic View on Cambodia\\" , Undergraduate Political Science Honor Thesis, Department of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley, May 1995, p.42, 63 In the book, Chomsky and Herman acknowledged that \\"The record of atrocities in Cambodia is substantial and often gruesome\\", but questioned their scale, which may have been inflated \\"by a factor of 100\\". Khmer Rouge agricultural policies reportedly produced \\"spectacular\\" results.\\"Chomsky and Herman (1979), After the Cataclysm, South End Press, pp. 136, 138-9, 160, 287, 158, 152. Contrary to Chomsky and Herman, the reports of massive Khmer Rouge atrocities and starvation in Cambodia proved to be accurate and uninflated. Many deniers or doubters of the Cambodian genocide recanted their previous opinions, but Chomsky continued to insist that his analysis of Cambodia was without error based on the information available to him at the time.Sharp, Bruce \\"Averaging Wrong Answers: Noam Chomsky and the Cambodian Controversy\\" http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/chomsky.htm#chx, accessed 25 May 2013 Herman addressed critics in 2001: \\"Chomsky and I found that the very asking of questions about ... the victims in the anti-Khmer Rouge propaganda campaign of 1975‚Äì1979 was unacceptable, and was treated almost without exception as 'apologetics for Pol Pot'.\\"Edward S. Herman \\"Propaganda System Number One: From Diem and Arbenz to Milosevic\\" , Z magazine (Z communications website), September 2001 Chomsky's biographers look at this issue in different ways. In Noam Chomsky: A life of dissent, Robert Barsky focuses on Steven Lukes' critique of Chomsky in The Times Higher Education Supplement. Barsky cites Lukes' claim that, obsessed by his opposition to the United States' role in Indochina, Chomsky had \\"lost all sense of perspective\\" when it came to Pol Pot's Cambodia. Barsky then cites a response by Chomsky in which he says that, by making no mention of this, Lukes is demonstrating himself to be an apologist for the crimes in Timor and adds on this subject, \\"\\"Let us say that someone in the US or UK... did deny Pol Pot atrocities. That person would be a positive saint as compared to Lukes, who denies comparable atrocities for which he himself shares responsibility and know how to bring to an end, if he chose.\\". Barsky concludes that the vigor of Chomsky's remarks \\"reflects the contempt that he feels\\" for all such arguments.'Robert Barsky, (1997). Noam Chomsky: A life of dissent. MIT Press. pp. 187-8. In Decoding Chomsky, Chris Knight takes a rather different approach. He claims that because Chomsky never felt comfortable about working in a military-funded laboratory at MIT, he was reluctant to be too critical of any regime that was being targeted by that same military. Knight writes that \\"while Chomsky has denounced the Russian Bolsheviks of 1917, he has been less hostile towards the so-called communist regimes which later took power in Asia. ... He also seemed reluctant to acknowledge the full horror of the 'communist' regime in Cambodia. The explanation I favour is that it pained Chomsky's conscience to denounce people anywhere who were being threatened by the very war machine that was funding his research.\\"Chris Knight (2016). Decoding Chomsky; Science and revolutionary politics. Yale University Press. pp. 261. Scholar and former Cambodia refugee, Sophal Ear, has reacted personally to Chomsky's views about Cambodia. \\"While my family worked and died in rice fields,\\" Ear said, \\"Chomsky sharpened his theories and amended his arguments while seated in his armchair in Cambridge, Massachusetts ... the peasants of Indochina, will write no memoirs and will be forgotten ... For decades, Chomsky has vilified his critics as only a world class linguist can. However, for me and the surviving members of my family, questions about life under the Khmer Rouge are not intellectual parlour games.\\" = East Timor activism = In 1975, the Indonesian army, under the command of President Suharto, invaded East Timor, occupying it until 1999, which resulted in between 80,000 and 200,000 East Timorese deaths. A detailed statistical report prepared for the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor cited a lower range of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974‚Äì1999, namely, approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness. The former figure is considered \\"proportionately comparable\\" to the Cambodian genocide though the total deaths in the latter were incomparably more. Chomsky argued that decisive military, financial and diplomatic support was provided to Suharto's regime, by successive U.S. administrations; beginning with Gerald Ford who, with Henry Kissinger as Secretary of State, provided a 'green light' to the invasion. Prior to the invasion, the U.S. had supplied the Indonesian army with 90% of its arms, and \\"by 1977 Indonesia found itself short of weapons, an indication of the scale of its attack. The Carter Administration accelerated the arms flow. Britain joined in as atrocities peaked in 1978, while France announced that it would sell arms to Indonesia and protect it from any public \\"embarrassment\\". Others, too, sought to gain what profit they could from the slaughter and torture of Timorese.\\" This humanitarian catastrophe went virtually unnoticed by the international community.Michael Gordon Jackson; International Journal of Politics and Ethics, Vol. 1, 2001 Noam Chomsky attempted to raise consciousness about the crisis at a very early stage.Karol Soltan of the University of Maryland, includes Chomsky among \\"the few isolated voices in the West\\" who provided help to the Timorese cause. In November 1978 and October 1979, Chomsky delivered statements to the Fourth Committee of the U.N. General Assembly about the East Timor tragedy and the lack of media coverage.Chomsky, Noam. Radical Priorities, ed. C.P. Otero. pp.84 In 1999, when it became clear that the majority of Timorese people were poised to vote in favour of their national independence in U.N. sponsored elections, Indonesian armed forces and paramilitary groups reacted by attempting to terrorize the population. At this time Chomsky chose to remind Americans of the three principal reasons why he felt they should care about East Timor: Weeks later, following the independence vote, the Indonesian military drove \\"hundreds of thousands from their homes and destroying most of the country. For the first time the atrocities were well publicized in the United States.\\"Chomsky, Noam. Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Dominance, 54 Australian historian Clinton Fernandes, writes that \\"When Indonesia invaded East Timor with US support in 1975, Chomsky joined other activists in a tireless campaign of international solidarity. His speeches and publications on this topic were prodigious and widely read, but his financial support is less well known. When the US media were refusing to interview Timorese refugees, claiming that they had no access to them, Chomsky personally paid for the airfares of several refugees, bringing them from Lisbon to the US, where he tried to get them into the editorial offices of The New York Times and other outlets. Most of his financial commitment to such causes has ‚Äì because of his own reticence ‚Äì gone unnoticed. A Timorese activist says, \\"we learnt that the Chomsky factor and East Timor were a deadly combination\\" and \\"proved to be too powerful for those who tried to defeat us\\".overland home page Standing before The UN Independent Special Commission of Inquiry for Timor-Leste whose major report was released in 2006. Arnold Kohen a U.S activist vitally important to the raising of Western consciousness of the catastrophe since 1975, testified that, When Jos√© Ramos-Horta and Bishop Carlos Belo of East Timor were honored with the Nobel Peace Prize, Chomsky responded \\"That was great, a wonderful thing. I ran into Jos√© Ramos- Horta in S√£o Paulo. I haven't seen his official speech yet, but certainly he was saying in public that the prize should have been given to Xanana Gusm√£o, who is the leader of the resistance to Indonesian aggression. He's in an Indonesian jail. But the recognition of the struggle is a very important thing, or will be an important thing if we can turn it into something.\\"Part III of an interview with Noam Chomsky =Chomsky and his publishers against the Turkish Courts= In 2002 the Turkish state indicted a Turkish publisher, Fatih Tas, for distributing a collection of Chomsky's essays under the title \\"American Intervention\\". The state charged that the book \\"promoted separatism\\" violating Article 8 of the Turkish Anti-Terror Law. One essay in the book was a reprint of a speech that Chomsky had made in Toledo, Ohio containing material claiming that the Turkish state had brutally repressed its Kurdish population. Prosecutors cited the following passages as particularly offensive: At the request of Turkish activists, Chomsky petitioned the Turkish courts to name him as a co-defendant. He testified at the court trial in Istanbul in 2002. Fatih Tas was acquitted. After the trial the BBC reported Tas as saying, \\"If Chomsky hadn't been here we wouldn't have expected such a verdict.\\" While Chomsky was in Turkey for the trial he traveled to the southern city of Diyarbakƒ±r, the unofficial capital of the Kurdish population in Turkey, where he delivered a controversial speech, urging the Kurds to form an autonomous, self-governing community.ZNet  Foreign Policy  CHOMSKY'S D√É?YARBAKIR SPEECH Police handed recorded cassettes and translations of the speech over to Turkish courts for investigation a few days later.Bulten In June 2006, Turkish publisher Tas was again prosecuted, along with two editors and a translator, for publishing a Turkish translation of Manufacturing Consent, authored by Chomsky and Edward S. Herman. The defendants were accused under articles 216 and 301 of the Turkish Penal Code for \\"publicly denigrating Turkishness, the Republic and the Parliament\\" and \\"inciting hatred and enmity among the people\\". The courts disallowed the authors from testifying on behalf of the defendants. In December 2006, the four defendants were acquitted by Turkish courts. Tas still has several cases pending for the publishing of other books. In 2003, in the New Humanist, Chomsky wrote about repression of free speech in Turkey and \\"the courage and dedication of the leading artists, writers, academics, journalists, publishers and others who carry on the daily struggle for freedom of speech and human rights, not just with statements but also with regular acts of civil disobedience. Some have spent a good part of their lives in Turkish prisons because of their insistence on recording the true history of the miserably oppressed Kurdish population.\\" = Marginalization in the mainstream media = Chomsky has, rarely, appeared in popular media outlets in the United States such as CNN, Time magazine, Foreign Policy, and others. However, his recorded lectures are regularly replayed by NPR stations in the United States that carry the broadcasts of Alternative Radio, a syndicator of progressive lectures. Critics of Chomsky have argued his mainstream media coverage is adequate, and not unusual considering the fact that academics in general often receive low priority in the American media. When CNN presenter Jeff Greenfield was asked why Chomsky was never on his show, he claimed that Chomsky might \\"be one of the leading intellectuals who can't talk on television. ... If you['ve] got a 22-minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up, ... he's out\\".\\"He may be one of the leading intellectuals who can't talk on television. You know, that's a standard that's very important to us. If you've got a 22 minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up ‚Äì now I don't know whether Chomsky does or not ‚Äì he's out. One of the reasons why Nightline has the \\"usual suspects\\" is that one of the things you have to do when you book a show is know that the person can make the point within the framework of television. And if people don't like that, they should understand that it's about as sensible to book somebody who will take eight minutes to give an answer as it is to book somebody who doesn't speak English.\\" Greenfield described this need to \\"say things between two commercials\\" as the media's requirement for \\"concision\\". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that \\"the beauty of [concision] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If you repeat conventional thoughts, you require zero evidence, like saying Osama Bin Laden is a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, if you say something that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, and a whole lot of it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence which is one of the reasons concision is critical.\\" He's continued that if the media were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they \\"would sound like they were from Neptune.\\" For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium. Since his book 9-11 became a bestseller in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Chomsky has attracted more attention from the mainstream American media. For example, The New York Times published an article in May 2002 describing the popularity of 9-11.Surprise Bestseller Blames the U.S In January 2004, the Times published a highly critical review of Chomsky's Hegemony or Survival by Samantha Power, and in February, the Times published an op-ed by Chomsky himself, criticizing the Israeli West Bank Barrier for taking Palestinian land. =Views on 9/11 conspiracy theories= Chomsky has dismissed 9/11 conspiracy theories, stating that there is no credible evidence to support the claim that the United States government was responsible for the attacks. In addition, Chomsky said he would not be surprised if the conspiracy theory movement is being fueled by the government establishment to distract the public from more pressing matters. = Worldwide audience = Chomsky in Paris (2010-05-29) Despite his marginalization in the mainstream US media, Chomsky is one of the most globally famous figures of the left, especially among academics and university students, and frequently travels across the United States, Europe, and the Third World. He has a very large following of supporters worldwide as well as a dense speaking schedule, drawing large crowds wherever he goes. He is often booked up to two years in advance. He was one of the main speakers at the 2002 World Social Forum. He is interviewed at length in alternative media. The 1992 film Manufacturing Consent, was shown widely on college campuses and broadcast on PBS. It is the highest-grossing Canadian-made documentary film in history.Montreal Mirror : Where Are They Now? : Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick Many of his books are bestsellers, including 9-11, which was published in 26 countries and translated into 23 languages;9-11 it was a bestseller in at least five countries, including Canada and Japan. Chomsky's views are often given coverage on public broadcasting networks around the world ‚Äì in marked contrast to his rare appearances in the US media. In the UK, for example, he appears periodically on the BBC. Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez was known to be an admirer of Chomsky's books. He held up Chomsky's book Hegemony or Survival during his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2006.

He was General Secretary of the French Communist Party (PCF) from 1964 to 1972. Early life and career The son of a cobbler, Rochet was named in honor of politician Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau. After completing his service in the army, he worked in market gardening. In 1923, he joined the youth wing of the French Communist Party (PCF), and the following year the Party itself. He was sent over to the Soviet Union, in order to receive political training at Moscow's International Lenin School. Rochet was local Party secretary in Lyon, then joined the central leadership in Paris; from 1936 to 1940, he was a communist representative in the lower chamber (the Third Republic equivalent of today's French National Assembly), elected in Colombes-Nanterre. During those years, Waldeck Rochet founded and edited the periodical La Terre. Charged by Party leader Maurice Thorez with agricultural matters and reporting to the Politburo, he took steps to ensure that divisions between peasants and urban dwellers were not to be encouraged within the Party structure. In 1939, he refused to condemn the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (as did the entire Party leadership), placing himself outside French law. He was detained in the French colony of Algeria, passing into the custody of Vichy France after the German invasion of France (1940), being set free by the Allies on the wake of the North African Campaign. In 1943, after joining the Free French Forces, he represented the communists in London and was elected to the provisional legislative body in Algiers. In late 1944, after the Liberation of Paris, Waldeck Rochet regained the French capital, where he carried on as representative. After World War II In 1945, he became a member of the Politburo, and was elected deputy for Sa√¥ne-et-Loire in the two successive Constituent Assemblies; in 1946, he was a representative to the National Assembly ‚Äì serving until 1958, the first year of the French Fifth Republic. From that moment on, Rochet was elected in other constituencies: Seine, then Seine-Saint-Denis (for Aubervilliers), until 1973. He was head of the Assembly's agriculture commission, as well as president of the communist parliamentary group. During those years, Rochet rose to the third most important position within the Party, after Thorez and Jacques Duclos. A deputy general secretary in 1961, he became the PCF leader in 1964. Favorable to left-wing cooperation, Rochet directed the PCF votes towards Fran√ßois Mitterrand in the presidential elections of 1965. The problem he faced as general secretary was the balance between a needed rejuvenation of the PCF structure and maintaining an orthodox Marxist-Leninist ideology. In consequence, he publicly stated his disregard for the leftist movement of May 1968, while later in the same year he had to deal with the Soviet crushing of the Prague Spring (when he tended to be favorable to the latter). The considerable stress of dealing with the latter event took a great toll on Rochet's nervous health. In 1970, as Rochet had become too ill to attend to his duties, Georges Marchais became the de facto Party leader, while Rochet remained National Secretary until 1972, then honorary president until 1979. During the last portion of his life, Waldeck Rochet turned towards Roman Catholicism, publicly displaying devotion for The Virgin, an attitude which led several of his comrades to consider that he had become insane. He died in Paris.

The restaurant closed in 1988 and Liew went on to teach cookery at Regency Park, Adelaide. In 1995, Liew took the reins at The Grange restaurant at the Hilton Hotel in Adelaide. At The Grange, Liew came up his \\"signature dish\\", titled \\"Four Dancers of the Sea\\", featuring \\"four varieties of seafood cooked in four distinct national styles\\". In 2009, after some 14 years, Cheong left The Grange; the restaurant closed at the end of the year. Awards and honours Described as \\"one of the indisputable fathers of Australian cooking\\" by Stephen Downes in To Die For (2006), Liew was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in the 1999 Queen's Birthday Honours \\"for service to the food and restaurant industry through involvement in developing and influencing the style of contemporary Australian cuisine. In 2017, Liew was honoured as \\"one of the ten hottest chefs alive\\" by the American publication Food & Wine Magazine, and inducted into the Hall of Fame in the World Food Media Awards.

Aerosanis were used by the Soviet Red Army during the Winter War and World War II. The first aerosanis may have been built in 1903-05 by Sergei Nezhdanovsky. In 1909‚Äì10, young Igor Sikorsky tested a self-designed aerosani, before he built multi-engine airplanes and helicopters. They were very light plywood vehicles on skis, propelled by otherwise-disused vintage aircraft engines and propellers.  Military usage The RF-8, a smaller World War II model, powered by an inexpensive automotive engine Finnish military snowmobile Military use of the aerosani goes back to at least the 1910s. During World War I, aerosanis were used for reconnaissance, communicating, and light raiding in northern areas. During the 1939‚Äì40 Winter War against Finland some were equipped with a machine gun ring mount on the roof. They could carry four or five men and tow four more on skis. The aerosanis were initially used for transport, liaison, and medical evacuation in deep snow, mostly in open country and on frozen lakes and rivers because of their poor hill-climbing ability and limited maneuverability on winding forest roads. During World War II aerosanis were used for reconnaissance, communication, and light raiding in northern areas thanks to their high mobility in deep snow (25‚Äì35 km/h, where many vehicles could not move at all). Responsibility for aerosanis was transferred to the Soviet Armoured Forces (GABTU) and orders were submitted for design and fabrication of lightly armoured versions, protected by ten millimetres of steel plate on the front. They were organized into transport or combat battalions of 45 vehicles, in three companies, often employed in cooperation with ski infantry. Troops were usually carried or towed by transport aerosanis, while fire support was provided by the heavier machine gun-armed, armoured models. Aerosanis were not used for direct assault because of their vulnerability to explosives such as mortar rounds. The ANT-I through ANT-V were a successful series of aerosanis of the 1920s and ‚Äô30s, designed by aircraft engineer Andrei Tupolev. A claim exists that in 1924 the Soviets obtained plans and specifications for 'air sleighs' from Chester B. Wing, an aviator, automobile dealer and former mayor of St. Ignace, Michigan, U.S.A. He had built practical aerosleds to aid transportation across the ice between St. Ignace and Mackinac Island, and for use by fishermen. The Spring 1943 issue of the magazine Science and Mechanics states that \\"from his aerosleds the Russians developed their present battle sled.\\" The claim though has to be viewed in the context of a pre-World War I picture of an Igor Sikorsky machine in Kiev. The first military aerosanis used in Finland, the KM-5 and OSGA-6 (later called NKL-6), were initially built at the Narkomles Factory in Moscow. During World War II, improved NKL-16/41 and NKL-16/42 models were built, and production started at the ZiS and GAZ car factories, and at smaller industries such as the Stalingrad Bekietovskiy Wood Works. In 1941 the armoured NKL-26, designed by M. Andreyev, started production at Narkomles. The following year, Gorki Narkorechflota developed the smaller, unarmoured GAZ-98, or RF-8, powered by a GAZ-M1 truck engine and a durable metal propeller. There was also an ASD-400 heavy assault sled used in World War II. Note that in western sources they are often referred to as 'aero-sleds'.

The creek was buried alongside the construction of Leaside High School. Eglinton was a small farming village located at what is today the intersection of Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue in York County, Ontario, Canada. It was first settled in the early 19th century and became the agricultural hub for the area just north of the city of Toronto. During the early 19th century, the area was part of the largest cattle-grazing region in Upper Canada (now the southern region of Ontario). The region was the first in North America to extend the use of cowbells to all cattle. Prior to this, it had been standard practice for a cowbell to be attached only to the best and leading animal in a group of livestock.\\"A Brief History of Toronto\\", Maclean's Magazine, Dec. 1991, p43 To honour this proud and storied heritage, the City of Toronto named a local street Cowbell Lane. The village was also an important stop on Yonge Street, the main road north from Toronto. One of the first settlers was John Montgomery, who founded a tavern catering to travelers. He likely named the village after the Earls of Eglinton, who had the family name Montgomerie and with whom he believed he had some connection. The name of the village would later be given to the east-west trail running through it, which would become Eglinton Avenue. In 1837 Montgomery's Tavern served as the base of William Lyon Mackenzie's rebels and was the site of the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern. A successful village of 700 people, the area's character changed in 1884 when the Metropolitan Street Railway began running a horse-drawn streetcar up Yonge Street to the village. Rapid housing development soon followed. As the population grew, the settlement was in 1890 incorporated with the smaller Davisville Village into the town of North Toronto. North Toronto was annexed to Toronto two decades later. References *F. R. Berchem. Opportunity Road: Yonge Street 1860-1939 Dundurn, 1996.

Those who chose to serve the government were obliged to assist the king in governing the nation properly, and once out of office, lead a quiet life in the countryside, teaching and leading the people in the right direction. Today, Seonbi is a figurative word for a learned man who does not covet wealth but values righteousness and principles. It is also used as a metaphor for a well-behaved and gloomy person. Also, to modern-day Koreans who do not have a high opinion of Joseon Dynasty and Confucianism use the word Seonbi synonymous to 'geezer'. Philosophy The seonbi followed a strict code of conduct and believed they had the moral duty to lead society in the right direction. Seonbi were to live life in modesty and perpetual learning in order to attain perfection of character, not only through knowledge but also by adhering to the rightful path. The goal of the seonbi was to achieve social justice. Seonbi were expected to possess the Confucian virtues of filial piety and loyalty to the king, disdain power, wealth and private interest, and be ready to lay down their life in order to remain faithful to their principles and maintain their integrity. They venerated scholars such as Jeong Mong-ju (who died for his fidelity to Goryeo), the six martyred ministers (who refused to accept Sejo's usurpation of the throne), and Jo Gwang-jo (a reformer who died trying to transform Joseon into an ideal Confucian society) as embodiments of the seonbi spirit and as examples to follow. Education was of great importance and referred to as \\"enlightenment\\", and seonbi gathered and studied at seowon institutions. Seonbi masculinity denotes mental attainment rather than physical performance, and is still valued by many South Koreans and considered by some scholars to be the ideal model of Korean masculinity. The seonbi had deep sympathy for the hardships of the common class. In their pursuit of social justice, the seonbi submitted blunt petitions to the king despite the dangerous consequences and suffered many purges as a result. Due to their reputation for integrity and incorruptibility, the seonbi were idealized and romanticized in popular imagination as men of honor in contrast to the ruling yangban class, even though seonbi came from the same class. The seonbi was a common figure in traditional Korean depictions of the Joseon period. For instance, a seonbi appears as one of the characters in the traditional mask dance preserved at the Hahoe Folk Village, where he competes with a yangban character, often depicted as corrupt and greedy. Modern depictions Modern depictions of seonbi in popular media are ubiquitous, with some examples being: * Lee Joon-gi in the Korean drama The Scholar Who Walks the Night * Kim Soo-hyun in the Korean drama My Love from the Star * Bae Yong-joon in the Korean film Untold Scandal * the seonbi mascot in the game Crossy Road * Cho Jae-hyun in the Korean drama Jeong Do-jeon Famous seonbi * Choi Ik-hyun * Heo Gyun * Jo Sik * Jeong Cheol * Jeong Do-jeon * Jeong Mong-ju * Jeong Yak- yong * Jo Gwang-jo * Kim Jeong-hui * Kim Su-hang * Park Ji-won * Seo Gyeong- deok * Seong Hon * Song Ik-pil * Song Jun-gil * Song Si-yeol * Yi Gi * Yi Hang-ro * Yi Hwang * Yi I * Yi Su-gwang * Yun Seon-do See also *Korean culture *Korean Confucianism *Silhak *Neo-Confucianism *Yangban  References  External links Category:Joseon dynasty Category:Korean words and phrases Category:Korean Confucianism ","title":"Seonbi"},{"id":"3930440","text":"The C7.GAT protein is a zinc finger protein based on the C7 protein (itself based on the murine Zif268).

It was formerly published seven days a week and at one point had a circulation of 67,000 (a figure that included five zoned editions which no longer exist). The Daily News is distributed in red newspaper racks and in stores, coffee shops, restaurants, schools and major workplaces. As of April 7, 2009 the paper ceased to be published as The Palo Alto Daily News and was consolidated with other San Francisco Peninsula Daily News titles; it published five days a week, Tuesday through Saturday. Weekday editions were delivered to selected homes. While continuing to publish daily online, The Daily News cut its print edition back to three days a week in 2013, and one day a week in 2015. Format and content Originally, the Daily News had a distinctive format with pages that were 16 inches long and 10.75 inches wide, dimensions which were thought to make the Daily News easier to hold than traditional broadsheet papers, but allow more stories to be published per page than a typical tabloid. On May 5, 2009, the paper went to a smaller page size (11-1/4 by 11-3/8 inches) to save money. \\"The change also brands our newspaper as different than the local competition, and makes it easier for our on-the-go readers to carry around,\\" an announcement to readers said. They now have a larger version than their original one, with different sections, like add-ins or inserts. The newspaper prints a combination of local stories and news from a number of wire services including The Associated Press, Bay City News, The New York Times and McClatchy-Tribune (the former Knight-Ridder Tribune). Local columnists include John Angell Grant, Larry Magid and John Reid. Syndicated opinion columns include those by Bob Herbert, Thomas Friedman and Maureen Dowd. History The Palo Alto Daily News debuted on December 7, 1995 with an initial circulation of 3,000. Within nine months, the paper was in the black. The paper generates all of its revenue from advertising. The original publishers, Jim Pavelich and Dave Price, understood that the advertising would reach more potential customers if the paper were free and thus widely available. The newspaper's press run is determined by consumer demand; by 1997, the circulation had nearly tripled to 10,000 copies a day. On August 9, 2000, the newspaper expanded into San Mateo County by opening three dailies, the San Mateo Daily News, Redwood City Daily News and Burlingame Daily News. These became the first free daily newspapers in San Mateo County, although within two years, other free dailies started in that area, replicating the format of the Daily News. On May 15, 2002, the Daily News launched the Los Gatos Daily News. In addition to Los Gatos, it served Saratoga, Campbell, Cupertino and western San Jose. In the first quarter of 2003, the combined circulation of the Daily News reached 55,000 per day, and on March 23 a home-delivered Sunday edition was added. An \\"Extra\\" was published minutes after a jury convicted Scott Peterson in Redwood City.On November 12, 2004, the Daily News beat the competition by putting out an \\"extra\\" minutes after a jury in Redwood City convicted Scott Peterson of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son. Editors put the \\"Redwood City Daily News\\" flag at the top of the Extra because the trial was taking place in that city, but it was distributed in all of the communities served by the Daily News, including Palo Alto. Redwood City residents grab copies of the \\"Extra\\" with the Peterson verdict. On February 15, 2005, Knight Ridder, then the nation's second-largest newspaper publisher, bought the Palo Alto Daily News and its four sister papers for $25 million. Price and Pavelich, the publishers, were asked to stay on during the transition, but they left by the end of the year. In May 2005, the Daily News launched the East Bay Daily News, which served Berkeley, Emeryville, Piedmont, Albany and the Oakland neighborhood of Rockridge. In January 2006, Shareef Dajani, formerly general manager of the Knight Ridder-owned Hills Newspapers, a group of weeklies in Alameda County, was named publisher. In March, Dajani fired editor Diana Diamond, a long-time Palo Altan who was also a columnist. Her dismissal triggered numerous letters-to-the-editor and the competing Palo Alto Weekly picked up her column. Dajani replaced Diamond with Lucinda Ryan, who had worked with him at the Hills Newspapers. In March 2006, Knight Ridder agreed to be purchased by The McClatchy Company, owner of the Sacramento Bee among other papers. McClatchy later announced it would sell 12 of the 32 Knight Ridder dailies, including the San Jose Mercury News and two other regional papers, The Monterey County Herald and the Contra Costa Times. The Palo Alto Daily News, along with other papers, was included in the Mercury News' 'bundle,' to be sold as one entity. MediaNews Group, which already owned several area papers, agreed to acquire The Mercury News, Contra Costa Times, Monterey County Herald and the St. Paul Pioneer Press of Minnesota for $1 billion, with $263 million of that coming from the Hearst Corporation, owner of the San Francisco Chronicle. The two deals ‚Äî the sale of Knight Ridder to McClatchy, and McClatchy's sale to MediaNews ‚Äî closed in August 2006. However, a lawsuit filed by San Francisco real estate developer Clint Reilly challenged the sale on anti-trust grounds. The suit was settled with Hearst and MediaNews agreeing not to work together on national advertising or distribution. In January 2007, Dajani was replaced by Carole Leigh Hutton, former editor and publisher of the Detroit Free Press when it was owned by Knight Ridder. When Knight Ridder sold the Free Press to Gannett on August 3, 2005, Hutton was named Knight Ridder's vice president of news, a position she held until the company folded in 2006. In March 2007, former Oakland Tribune editor Mario Dianda replaced Lucinda Ryan as executive editor. In May 2008, Daily News founders Dave Price and Jim Pavelich announced that they were reviving the original paper, in its original headquarters at 324 High St., under the name Palo Alto Daily Post.http://www.paloaltodailynews.com/article/2008-5-25-pa- phantom, http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/story.php?story_id=8605 In June 2008, the Daily News laid off five newsroom workers and eliminated its Monday edition in Palo Alto and its Tuesday edition in San Mateo, Redwood City and Burlingame. Those three cities had lost their Monday edition two years earlier.

He is one of the few Apostles of Bah√° ºu'll√°h who never actually met Bah√° ºu'll√°h. His given name was Muhammad, and he chose the alias Abu'l-Fa·∏çl (progenitor of virtue) for himself, but  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° frequently addressed him as Abu'l-Fada'il (progenitor of virtues). Early life M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl was born in a village near Gulpaygan, Iran, sometime in the months of June or July 1844. His family were prominent religious scholars in the village; his father, Mirza Muhammad Rida Shari ªatmadar, was a religious leader, and his mother, Sharafu'n-Nisa, was related to the prayer leader of the town. Abu'l-Fa·∏çl completed his preliminary education in Gulpaygan, and then successively went to Arak, Karbala and Najaf to continue his education. In 1868 he left to Isfahan to study Islamic sciences at one of the religious colleges in the city; he was given a room by one of the prayer leaders, Imam-Jum ªih, Sayyid Muhammad Sultanu'l- ªUlama, who was a friend of his father's. Abu'l-Fa·∏çl remained at the college for three years, becoming well versed in several branches of knowledge. Abu'l-Fa·∏çl's father died in the winter of 1871, and after his death, Abu'l-Fa·∏çl's brothers schemed against him and took all their father's inheritance. In October 1873, M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl was invited to Tehran to teach Kalam, or speculative theology, at the Madrasih Hakim Hashim, one of the religious colleges in the city. During the time he was at the religious college, he was able to continue learning about philosophy and mystical philosophy, or Irfan, by attending the lectures of M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Hasan Jilvih, one of the leading figures on the subject. Furthermore, during his time at Madrasih Hakim Hashim, he also discussed the history of religion with two Buddhist scholars who were in Tehran at the same time, and attended science classes at the √©lite school of Dar ol-Fonoon, founded by Amir Kabir, the grand vizier to Nasereddin Shah. After a short time at the Madrasih Hakim Hashim, he was selected to be the head of the religious college. Conversion to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and arrests M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl's first encounters with Bah√° º√≠s was in the beginning of 1876 during his time in Tehran. Abu'l-Fa·∏çl, at one point, met an uneducated cloth-seller, named Aqa  ªAbdu'l-Karim, with whom he would have discussions over difficult religious questions. Over time Abu'l-Fa·∏çl came to appreciate  ªAbdu'l-Karim's keenness and moral qualities, but when eventually he learnt that  ªAbdu'l-Karim was a Bah√° º√≠ and that the points he was making were predominantly derived from Bah√° º√≠ scripture, Abu'l-Fa·∏çl was saddened. Abu'l-Fa·∏çl, however, became curious about the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and asked to meet other Bah√° º√≠s. There is a famous story of M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl's meeting with a Bah√° º√≠ blacksmith: :\\"It so happened that on the way out one of the donkeys lost a shoe, so the party called at the nearest blacksmith for help. Noticing the long beard and large turban of Mirza Abu'l-Fa·∏çl -- indications of his vast knowledge -- the blacksmith Ustad Husayn-i-Na'l-Band (shoeing smith), who was illiterate, was tempted to enter into conversation with the learned man. He said to Mirza that since he had honoured him with his presence, it would be a great privilege for him if he could be allowed to ask a question which had perplexed his mind for some time. When permission was granted he said, 'Is it true that in the Traditions of Sh√≠'ah Islam it is stated that each drop of rain is accompanied by an angel from heaven? And that this angel brings down the rain to the ground?' 'This is true,' Mirza Abu'l-Fa·∏çl responded. After a pause, the blacksmith begged to be allowed to ask another question to which Mirza gave his assent. 'Is it true', the blacksmith asked, 'that if there is a dog in a house no angel will ever visit that house?' Before thinking of the connection between the two questions, Mirza Abu'l-Fa·∏çl responded in the affirmative. 'In that case', commented the blacksmith, 'no rain should ever fall in a house where a dog is kept.' Mirza Abu'l-Fa·∏çl, the noted learned man of Islam, was now confounded by an illiterate blacksmith. His rage knew no bounds, and his companions noticed that he was filled with shame. They whispered to him, 'This blacksmith is a Bah√° º√≠!'\\" In the next several months, Abu'l-Fa·∏çl met with some of the leading Bah√° º√≠s including Nab√≠l-i-Akbar, Mirza Isma ªil Dhabih and Aqa Mirza Haydar  ªAli Ardistani. While he was at Mirza Isma ªil Dhabih's house, he read two of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's tablets, the Lawh-i-Ra'√≠s (Tablet of the Chief) and the Lawh-i- Fu'√°d (Tablet of Fu'ad Pasha), which contain prophecies both of the fall of the Ottoman Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz and vizier  ªAli P√°sh√° and of the loss of Adrianople from the Sultan. He determined that if the events portrayed in those tablets came to pass, he would believe in Bah√° ºu'll√°h. A few months later, when precisely the events foretold in the tablets occurred, M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl accepted the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and became a Bah√° º√≠ on 20 September 1876. As soon as he became a Bah√° º√≠, Abu'l-Fa·∏çl began to teach the new religion to others, and when news spread of his conversion away from Islam, he was removed from the religious college. He found a new position as a teacher at a school for Zoroastrian children that was established by M√°nikcÕühi S√°hib, an Indian Parsi. During his time at the school, a number of Zoroastrians converted to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith including Ustad Javanmard and Mulla Bahram Akhtar-Khavari. He continued to teach the Bah√° º√≠ Faith during the next ten years that he spent in Tehran, and helped M√≠rz√° Husayn Hamadani produce an account of the history of the B√°b√≠ and Bah√° º√≠ religions, the Tarikh-i-Jadid (The New History), which was commissioned by M√°nikcÕühi S√°hib. In Tehran, he was also imprisoned on three occasions. He was first imprisoned in December 1876 when it was found that he had converted to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith; he was released after five months. He was next imprisoned in 1882-83 for nineteen months, with fifty or so other Bah√° º√≠s in Tehran, when the governor of the city, Kamran Mirza, ordered their arrests at the instigation of Sayyid Sadiq Sanglaji, a religious leader in the city. Then, in October 1885 he was imprisoned for another six months, once again, due to orders from Kamran Mirza. Travels After his 1882 imprisonment, he began extensive travels throughout the Persian Empire, especially after he received letters from Bah√° ºu'll√°h in 1886 asking him to travel to teach the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. It was principally through his writings that the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was presented to the Jews of Iran in such a way as to bring a large number of them into accepting Bah√° ºu'll√°h. During his travels in Iran he visited Kashan, Isfahan, Yazd and Tabriz. In 1888 and the three years thereafter he travelled to Ashgabat, Samarkand, and Bukhara. During his time in Ashgabat, Haji Muhammad Rida Isfahani, a prominent Bah√° º√≠ was assassinated; Abu'l-Fa·∏çl acted as the spokesman on behalf of the Bah√° º√≠ at the trial of the murders, and helped establish the independence of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith from Islam for the Russian government. In Samarkand, his teaching efforts allowed for the conversion of the first Afghan Bah√° º√≠, Dr.  ªAta'u'llah Khan. In 1894 Abu'l-Fa·∏çl spent ten months with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in 'Akk√°, then in 1894 went to Cairo, where he settled for several years. In Egypt, he was successful in converting some thirty of the students of Al-Azhar University, the foremost institution of learning in the Sunni Muslim world. Abu'l-Fa·∏çl also became friends with writers and magazine publishers, and many articles that he authored appeared in the Egyptian press. In 1896, when Nasiru'd-Din Shah was assassinated in Iran, an enemy of the Bah√° º√≠s, Za ªimu'd-Dawlih, used the rumour that the assassination had been performed by Bah√° º√≠s, to cause a massacre of the Bah√° º√≠s in Egypt. When Abu'l-Fa·∏çl, stood up in defence for the Bah√° º√≠s and stated that he himself was a Bah√° º√≠, his allegiance became public; then when his two books Fara'id and Al-Duraru'l-Bahiyyih were published in 1897-1900 the al-Azhar University decreed that Abu'l-Fa·∏çl was an infidel. Between 1900 and 1904 he travelled to Paris and the United States, by request of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, where his talks and writings enabled the fledgling Bah√° º√≠ communities to gain confidence and a clear understanding of the religion. During his travels, he was accompanied by Laura Clifford Barney, an American Bah√° º√≠. In Paris, his talks were translated by Anton Haddad, and over thirty people became Bah√° º√≠s. Then in the autumn of 1901 travelled to the United States, and specifically to Chicago, where the largest Bah√° º√≠ community was, and gave a large number of talks. Then in December 1901, Abu'l-Fa·∏çl travelled to Washington D.C. and gave talks to both Bah√° º√≠s and the general population. During this time, he also continuously worked on an introductory book on the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Abu'l-Fa·∏çl then travelled to the Green Acre Bah√° º√≠ School in Eliot, Maine where he stayed during the months of July and August 1903 and lectured to a Bah√° º√≠ audience. In 1904,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° asked that Abu'l-Fa·∏çl return to the Middle East, and the Bah√° º√≠s held a large farewell gathering for him in New York City on 29 November 1904. Later years M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl lived most of his later years in Cairo until his death on 21 January 1914. During his final years, he also visited Beirut and Haifa. Abu'l-Fa·∏çl was in Egypt when  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° visited Egypt in August 1910, and he stayed near  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in Alexandria in mid 1911. Near the end of 1912, Abu'l-Fa·∏çl started to become ill, and Aqa Muhammad-Taqi Isfahani was able to move Abu'l-Fa·∏çl to his house in Cairo, where he remained until his death on 21 January 1914. After his death,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° gave a eulogy which can be found in Bah√° º√≠ Proofs. Moojan Momen, a historian of Bah√° º√≠ studies, states that Abu'l-Fa·∏çl possessed a critical mind, and had a complete devotion to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Momen states that Abu'l-Fa·∏çl's writings \\"show a keen understanding of modern currents of thought remarkable in a man who only knew oriental languages.\\" and was able to apply the Bah√° º√≠ teachings to a wide range of different issues. As an author M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl wrote on a wide range of Bah√° º√≠ subjects, including extensive amounts of material about the proofs of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's mission. He was consistently praised by the central figures of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and Shoghi Effendi. His papers and letters include a wide range of presentations of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith for those of Christian and Jewish backgrounds, and his concepts in the presentation of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith continue to be important today. After his death, his papers, including several unfinished works, were taken to Ashqabat, where his nephew lived; many of these papers were, however, lost during the Russian Revolution.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° once wrote, referring to The Brilliant Proof: :\\"His Honour M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fa·∏çl has written a treatise answering the criticisms of a London preacher. Each one of you should have a copy. Read, memorize and reflect upon it. Then, when accusations and criticisms are advanced by those unfavourable to the Cause, you will be well armed.\\" Publications *Fara'id (The Peerless Gems): A book written in 1898 in reply to an attack on the Kit√°b-i-√çq√°n and published in Cairo.

Since it was written in Arabic, it was responsible for making the Bah√° º√≠s known in Egypt. It has been translated by Juan Cole as Miracles and Metaphors () * Burhan-i-Lami ª (The Brilliant Proof): Published, along with an English translation, in Chicago in 1912, the paper responds to a Christian clergyman's questions. Republished as *Sharh-i-Ayat-i- Mu'arrakhih (In Explanation of Massacre Verses that Prophesy Dates): Written in 1888, the work discusses the date of the prophecies concerning the coming of the Promised One in the scriptures of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism. *Risalih Ayyubiyyih (Treatise addressed to Ayyub): Written in 1887, concerning prophecies relating to the Promised One in the Torah. *Faslu'l-Khitab (The Decisive Utterance): A large book written in Samarqand in 1892; among its subjects, it discusses the traditions in Shia Islam regarding the persecution of the Promised One. The book was written in reply to an attack by an Adharbayjan Shia cleric. No known copy of the work exists. *Risaliyyih Iskandaraniyyih: Published along with Al-Duraru'l-Bahiyyih, the paper provides proofs for Muhammad's prophethood from Christian and Jewish scripture. It also explains the verse from the Qur ºan \\"Then it is ours to explain it.\\" * The Kitab-i-Ibrar (Book of Justification): While no manuscript of this book currently exists, it was referred to in Abu'l-Fa·∏çl's other works and seems to have dealt with the Covenant. * Al-Hujaju'l-Bah√° º√≠yyih (The Bah√° º√≠ Proofs): A book written while in the United States, which explains and defends the Bah√° º√≠ Faith from a Christian point of view. * Kashfu'l-Ghita (The Uncovering of Error): After E.G. Browne published the Nuqtatu'l-Kaf, which was hostile to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, Abu'l-Fa·∏çl began working on refutations of that book. When he learned that other Bah√° º√≠ scholars had also started working on refutations that had reached an advanced stage, he suspended his writing. He never completed the book, and when his papers were sent to his cousin in Ashkhabad, his cousin worked on completing the book, of which 132 of 438 pages are written by Abu'l-Fa·∏çl. =Letters= In addition to the books that Abu'l-Fa·∏çl wrote, he also wrote a number of shorter works in response to questions addressed to him; some of these letters have been published in a number of compilations: * Majmu ªiy-i-Rasa ºil-i-Hadrat-i-Abi'l-Fa·∏çl: Published in Cairo in 1920 and contains 16 letters and treatises. * Rasa'il wa Raqa'im: Published in Persian in Tehran in 1977, and contains 23 treatises and 59 letters. Some of the treatises from this work have been translated by Juan Cole into English in Letters & Essays including: ** Two treatises on the Covenant: Published in 1911 in Cairo consisting of two treatises written in 1899 and 1896 which deal with proofs from the Bible and the Qur ºan, and about the actions of Covenant-breakers. ** Risalih Iskandariyyih (Treatise of Alexander): Written in response to a request by E.G. Browne to write about the life of Bah√° ºu'll√°h among other things. The letter was named in honour of Alexander Tumansky, who had also requested information about Bah√° ºu'll√°h. ** Al-Bab wa'l-Babiyyih (The B√°b and B√°b√≠sm): A brief history of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith commissioned by the editor of the Egyptian magazine Al-Muqtataf after the assassination of Nasser al-Din Shah. * A treatise regarding Bah√° ºu'll√°h's ancestry which traces it to the last Sasanian king, Yazdgerd III.

Oracle Corporation includes RAC with the Enterprise Edition, provided the nodes are clustered using Oracle Clusterware.Oracle Database Editions Functionality Oracle RAC allows multiple computers to run Oracle RDBMS software simultaneously while accessing a single database, thus providing clustering. In a non-RAC Oracle database, a single instance accesses a single database. The database consists of a collection of data files, control files, and redo logs located on disk. The instance comprises the collection of Oracle-related memory and background processes that run on a computer system. In an Oracle RAC environment, 2 or more instances concurrently access a single database. This allows an application or user to connect to either computer and have access to a single coordinated set of data. The instances are connected with each other through an \\"Interconnect\\" which enables all the instances to be in sync in accessing the data. Aims The main aim of Oracle RAC is to implement a clustered database to provide performance, scalability and resilience & high availability of data at instance level. Implementation Oracle RAC depends on the infrastructure component Oracle Clusterware to coordinate multiple servers and their sharing of data storage.Introduction to Oracle Real Application Clusters The FAN (Fast Application Notification) technology detects down-states. RAC administrators can use the \`srvctl\` tool to manage RAC configurations, =Cache Fusion= Prior to Oracle 9, network- clustered Oracle databases used a storage device as the data-transfer medium (meaning that one node would write a data block to disk and another node would read that data from the same disk), which had the inherent disadvantage of lackluster performance. Oracle 9i addressed this issue: RAC uses a dedicated network connection for communications internal to the cluster. Since all computers/instances in a RAC access the same database, the overall system must guarantee the coordination of data changes on different computers such that whenever a computer queries data, it receives the current version ‚Äî even if another computer recently modified that data. Oracle RAC refers to this functionality as Cache Fusion. Cache Fusion involves the ability of Oracle RAC to \\"fuse\\" the in-memory data cached physically separately on each computer into a single, global cache. = Networking = The Oracle Grid Naming Service (GNS) handles name resolution in the cluster registry. = Diagnostics = The Trace File Analyzer (TFA) aids in collecting RAC diagnostic data. Versions * Oracle Real Application Clusters 12c Release 1 Enterprise Edition. * Oracle Real Application Clusters One Node (RAC One Node) applies RAC to single-node installations running Oracle Database 11g Release 2 Enterprise Edition. Evolution Relative to the single-instance Oracle database, Oracle RAC adds additional complexity. While database automation makes sense for single- instance databases, it becomes even more necessary for clustered databases because of their increased complexity. Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC), introduced with Oracle 9i in 2001, supersedes the Oracle Parallel Server (OPS) database option. Whereas Oracle9i required an external clusterware (known as vendor clusterware like TruCluster Veritas Cluster Server or Sun Cluster) for most of the Unix flavors (except for Linux and Windows where Oracle provided free clusterware called Cluster Ready Services or CRS), as of Oracle 10g, Oracle's clusterware product was available for all operating systems. With the release of Oracle Database 10g Release 2 (10.2), Cluster Ready Services was renamed to Oracle Clusterware. When using Oracle 10g or higher, Oracle Clusterware is the only clusterware that you need for most platforms on which Oracle RAC operates (except for Tru cluster, in which case you need vendor clusterware). You can still use clusterware from other vendors, if the clusterware is certified for Oracle RAC. In RAC, the write-transaction must take ownership of the relevant area of the database: typically, this involves a request across the cluster interconnection (local IP network) to transfer the data-block ownership from another node to the one wishing to do the write. This takes a relatively long time (from a few to tens of milliseconds) compared to single database-node using in-memory operations. For many types of applications, the time spent coordinating block access across systems is low relative to the many operations on the system, and RAC will scale comparably to a single system. Moreover, high read-transactional databases (such as data- warehousing applications) work very well under RAC, as no need for ownership- transfer exists. (Oracle 11g has made many enhancements in this area and performs a lot better than earlier versions for read-only workloads.) The overhead on the resource mastering (or ownership-transfer) is minimal for fewer than three nodes, as the request for any resource in the cluster can be obtained in a maximum of three hops (owner-master-requestor). This makes Oracle RAC horizontally scalable with many nodes. Application vendors (such as SAP) use Oracle RAC to demonstrate the scalability of their application. Most of the biggest OLTP benchmarks are on Oracle RAC. Oracle RAC 11g supports up to 100 nodes. For some applications, RAC may require careful application partitioning to enhance performance. An application that scales linearly on an SMP machine may scale linearly under RAC. However, if the application cannot scale linearly on SMP, it will not scale when ported to RAC. In short, the application scalability is based on how well the application scales in a single instance. Competitive context Shared-nothing and shared-everything architectures each have advantages over the other. DBMS vendors and industry analysts regularly debate the matter; for example, Microsoft touts a comparison of its SQL Server 2005 with Oracle 10g RAC. Oracle Corporation offered a Shared Nothing architecture RDBMS with the advent of the IBM SP and SP2 with the release of 7.x MPP editions, in which virtual shared drives (VSD) were used to create a Shared Everything implementation on a Shared Nothing architecture. =Shared-Everything= Shared-everything architectures share both data on disk and data in memory between nodes in the cluster. This is in contrast to \\"shared-nothing\\" architectures that share none of them. Some commercially available databases offer a \\"shared-everything\\" architecture. IBM DB2 for z/OS (the IBM mainframe operating-system) has provided a high- performance data-sharing option since the mid-1990s when IBM released its mainframe hardware and software-clustering infrastructure. In late 2009, IBM announced DB2 pureScale, a shared-disk clustering scheme for DB2 9.8 on AIX that mimics the parallel sysplex implementation behind DB2 data sharing on the mainframe. In February 2008, Sybase released its Adaptive Server Enterprise, Cluster Edition. It resembles Oracle RAC in its shared-everything design. Although technically not shared-everything, Sybase also provides a column- based relational database focused on analytic and datawarehouse applications called Sybase IQ that can be configured to run in a shared disk mode. Cloud Native Databases, such as Aurora of AWS and POLARDB of Alibaba Cloud, are implemented with \\"shared-everything\\" architecture on top of cloud-based distributed file systemhttps://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.StorageReliability.html. =Shared-nothing= Shared-nothing architectures share neither the data on disk nor the data in memory between nodes in the cluster. This is in contrast to \\"shared-everything\\" architectures, which share both. Competitive products offering shared-nothing architectures include: *MySQL Cluster (Oracle Corporation has owned MySQL since 2009) *ScaleBasehttp://www.scalebase.com/products/product-architecture/ *Clustrix *HP NonStop *IBM InfoSphere Warehouse editions that include the Database Partitioning Feature (formerly known as DB2 Extended Enterprise Edition) *MarkLogic *Greenplum *Oracle NoSQL Database *Paraccel *Netezza (aka.

The original series, which aired in the late 1960s, has since spawned nine successor series and thirteen movies , merchandise, and a multibillion-dollar industry collectively known as the Star Trek franchise. The franchise is owned by CBS Television Studios, which now owns television properties previously held by Paramount Pictures, the studio that produced Star Trek for many decades. CBS Paramount continues to hold DVD rights to the TV series, and the rights to produce feature films. Two films, Galaxy Quest (1999) and Free Enterprise (1999), and a television series, The Orville, have been inspired by the cultural influence of Star Trek. Star Trek: The Original Series Gene Roddenberry sold Star Trek in 1964 to NBC as a classic adventure drama, calling it a \\"Wagon Train to the Stars\\". But Roddenberry wanted to tell more sophisticated stories, using futuristic situations as analogies for current problems on Earth and showing how they could be rectified through humanism and optimism. The series' writers frequently addressed moral and social issues such as slavery, warfare, and discrimination. The opening line \\"to boldly go where no man has gone before\\" is almost verbatim from a U.S. White House booklet on space produced after the Sputnik flight in October 1957.

At a time when there were few non-white or foreign roles in American television dramas, Roddenberry created a multi-ethnic crew for the Enterprise, including an African woman (Uhura), a Scotsman (Montgomery Scott), an Asian man (Hikaru Sulu), and‚Äîmost notably‚Äîan alien, the half-Vulcan Spock. In the second season, reflecting the contemporaneous Cold War, Roddenberry added a Russian crew member, Pavel Chekov (played by Walter Koenig).

Also, the spy series I Spy featured a scripted, unedited interracial kiss between Robert Culp (white) and France Nuyen (Vietnamese) in the episode \\"The Tiger\\"; a kiss that would not gain the controversy or attention as the Star Trek kiss did. Star Treks contributions to television history include giving women jobs of respect, most notably through the casting of Nichelle Nichols, a black actress, as Uhura, the ship's communications officer. Black actresses at that time on television were almost always cast as servants. In fact, Whoopi Goldberg recalled that the first time she saw Uhura, she excitedly told her mother: \\"Mama, there's a black woman on television and she ain't no maid!\\" In an interview, Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told there was a big fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said, > I thought it was a Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I looked across the room, > and there was Dr. Martin Luther King walking towards me with this big grin > on his face.

Women's crew uniforms, which consisted of miniskirts, high heeled boots, and heavy makeup, have been pointed-to as degrading to women for highlighting their frequent role as sexual objects. Researchers have pointed out that this was not necessarily the way the wardrobe, or the overall femininity of female characters in the series, was viewed by contemporary female viewers. Cited are the concerns of women of the time period with the perceived upsetting of traditional gender roles for women of the future, with the women of the show's feminine behavior acting to reaffirm that women's sexuality and traditional femininity would not be lost. This fear was manifested by the media's criticisms of Valentina Tereshkova, the first female astronaut to go to space, as masculine and \\"mannish\\". The uniform's usage of the miniskirt was also considered progressive by some at the time, as the miniskirt, at that time, was a symbol of the modern woman's economic and sexual independence.Vettel- Becker, Patricia. \\"Space and the Single Girl: Star Trek, Aesthetics, and 1960s Femininity.\\" Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, vol. 35 no. 2, 2014, pp. 143-178.

Despite a restricted budget, the series' special effects were superior to contemporary TV series, its stories were often written by prominent science fiction authors (though often re-written by the series' regular writers),The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Gen Ed Peter Nichols, Granada 1979, Page570 and many of its production values‚Äîsuch as costuming and set design‚Äîwere of high caliber for the series' low budget. Some of the production staff of The Outer Limits worked on Star Trek and often made creative re-use of props from the earlier series. During its network run from 1966 to 1969, TOS ratings were mediocre. A letter-writing campaign by fans, unprecedented in size, contributed to NBC's decision to renew the series for a third season, but the network put the series in a disadvantageous timeslot, and TOS was finally canceled after its third season. Cancellation and aftermath In 1976, a letter-writing campaign compelled NASA to name the inaugural (and test) space shuttle Enterprise after the fictional starship. In this image, Enterprise is rolled out of the Palmdale manufacturing facilities with Star Trek television cast members and creator Gene Roddenberry in attendance. After its cancellation, through reruns Star Trek became more popular and reached a much wider audience than when it had originally aired. Known as \\"trekkies\\" or \\"trekkers\\", the series' fans formed clubs and organized conventions. In 1976, following another fan-organized letter-writing campaign, NASA named its first space shuttle orbiter, Enterprise (OV-101), after the fictional starship. NASA also employed actress Nichelle Nichols, who played Uhura, to help recruiting African-Americans and women to become astronauts. Film reception In the mid-1970s, encouraged by the burgeoning fan base for the series, Roddenberry sought to start a second television series (Star Trek: Phase II); this abortive attempt morphed into Star Trek: The Motion Picture in 1979. The movie did sufficiently well at the box office, grossing more than $80 million in the United States and $139 million worldwide, to spawn several more movies during the 1980s. In 1987, Roddenberry created a second television series, Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG), which was set aboard the fifth starship USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) more than seventy years after events in the earlier series and related movies. Unlike TOS‚Äîwhich often reflected a bold, interventionist American philosophy‚ÄîTNG had a less aggressive and more socially liberal message. Unlike its progenitor, this series entered syndicated, rather than a nationwide network, from the beginning, and was sold to individual local television stations. It became the number one syndicated television, lasting seven seasons, spawned two sequels, a prequel, four movies, and a vast marketing franchise. Star Trek and its spin-offs have proved highly popular in television repeats, shown repeatedly on television stations in the United States and throughout the world. The Star Trek franchise is similarly prolific. Only Star Wars has had as significant an influence as a science fiction and popular culture phenomenon.

This is partially borne out by review aggregator statistics. For example, prior to the release of the 13th film the odd-numbered entries averaged 57% on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes while the even-numbered entries averaged 79%. However, this perceived difference in quality is not reflected in box-office performance with the odd and even numbered entries having a virtually identical attendance in the United States and Canada on average. The tenth film, Nemesis, was considered the even film that defied the curse. Its failure and the subsequent success of Star Trek (2009) were considered to have broken the trend. The curse has been mentioned often in popular culture. One of the best known examples occurred in a 1999 episode of the Channel 4 sitcom Spaced, where it was referenced by Tim Bisley, played by Simon Pegg; Pegg, quite conscious of the irony, played Scotty in the eleventh and subsequent films. Fandom Star Trek conventions have been popular, but are waning and are now often meshed with conventions of other genres. Fans coined the terms \\"Trekkies\\" and \\"Trekkers\\" to describe themselves, and produce an abundance of material like fanzines with fiction, art and songs. The series cultural influence goes far beyond its longevity and profitability.

A broad consensus amongst fans is that the Star Trek franchise became formulaic and mediocre in the 1990s on account of over-exploitation of the franchise by Paramount and production of multiple spin-offs and movies, though fans do not necessarily agree as to when this began (some adult viewers of TOS felt it also could be formulaic and repetitive).

Michael Giacchino has written a well-received distinctive new fanfare for the reboot Star Trek movie and its sequels, Star Trek Into Darkness and Star Trek Beyond. Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine received their own distinctive opening fanfares. In a departure from the tradition of sweeping classical themes symbolizing the various incarnations of Star Trek, the opening theme to Star Trek: Enterprise is the (pre-existing) pop song \\"Faith of the Heart\\", by Diane Warren (Star Trek: Enterprise episodes close with the orchestral \\"Archer's Theme\\" epilogue, a piece which is more similar to the preceding Star Trek themes than \\"Faith of the Heart\\"). Some of the most prominent composers of 20th- and 21st-century film music have written film scores and television scores for Star Trek. These include Jay Chattaway, Cliff Eidelman, Michael Giacchino, Jerry Goldsmith, James Horner, Dennis McCarthy and Leonard Rosenman. A subgenre of Star Trek fandom has developed, specifically for the music of Star Trek, which includes music lovers who are not otherwise interested in Star Trek fandom. Dozens of commercially produced musical recordings of performances of Star Trek music exist‚Äîunrelated to the performance of screen Star Trek itself‚Äîevidencing the intrinsic cultural value and influence of the music of Star Trek. A concert series, Star Trek: The Music, by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, played in several U.S. and Canadian cities between 2007 and 2010. Science fiction, fantasy and television The first television series with comparable storyline and set-up to Star Trek (aside from the genre rival Doctor Who) was the 1990s series Babylon 5. When pitching the series, the producer J. Michael Straczynski had hoped that television executives would think Trek had opened up the market for science-fiction on television. However, he was told that Star Trek only created a market for more Star Trek and that the prospects for non-Trek related science fiction were seen as bleak. Eventually, Babylon 5 was greenlit. Three script writers who had worked for the original Trek series were to write for Babylon 5 (including D. C. Fontana who had written for three different Trek series), and Star Trek actor Walter Koenig was cast in a recurring role. All this, and the strong similarities of the series' premise to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine invited comparison to Star Trek. In addition, Babylon 5 was the first television series since Star Trek to get nominated for or win the Hugo award for best science fiction drama, which had only recognized feature films in the media category since Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry's widow and Star Trek actress, Majel Barrett-Roddenberry, publicly stated that her decision to do a guest star appearance on Babylon 5 was to stop the feuding and bickering among hardline fans of the two series, which broke out occasionally at science fiction conventions. Ultimately, the series ran for its intended length of five seasons, making it the longest running American space oriented futuristic television series outside of the Star Trek franchise. =Star Trek fandom in fiction= Some television series feature major or supporting characters whose love of Star Trek affects the storyline of the series. \\"The Replacement\\", a Season 5 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, features two versions of the character Xander, a Star Trek fan, which is a simultaneous tribute to the Star Trek episode \\"The Enemy Within\\", in which there are two Captain Kirks. In crossover casting, two other television series have cast actors from Star Trek in series in which other characters are Star Trek fans who frequently refer to Trek moments or cite Trek storylines. The character Hiro Nakamura on NBC's Heroes likes to describe his ability to teleport as \\"like Star Trek\\", and has often performed Mr. Spock's Vulcan salute. His father is played by original Star Trek cast member George Takei (Sulu). Additionally, Nichelle Nichols, who portrayed Uhura on The Original Series also appears on the series. Over a dozen actors from various Star Trek series have made guest appearances on one or the other of the Stargate series. In those series, Colonel Jack O'Neill makes unsuccessful pitches to name new space vessels after the Enterprise, and also gives the Vulcan salute in tribute to Trek. In an earlier episode of Stargate: SG-1, O'Neill travels back in time to the 1960s and during an interrogation by an Air Force officer he refers to himself as \\"James T. Kirk, captain of the federation starship Enterprise\\". Another Trek reference is made when a character questions whether or not another team member can be \\"beamed up\\". The response is \\"What am I, Scotty\\"? Later on the series, advanced alien technology allows team members to \\"beam\\" up and down in manner similar to that seen on Star Trek. In the Cold War submarine film Crimson Tide (1995), in a moment of crisis, the USS Alabamas executive officer (played by Denzel Washington) gives a pep talk to his young radioman, urging him to repair the ship's radio by referring to Kirk's telling Scotty they need \\"more power\\". The Trek fandom of Noel, a recurring character on the sitcom Frasier, plays a role in several episodes, including \\"Star Mitzvah\\", in which he deceives Frasier into believing a speech is written in Hebrew when it is really in the Klingon language. The main characters from the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, especially Sheldon Cooper, make various references to and are big fans of Star Trek, with Sheldon even citing Starfleet regulations during an argument in one episode and the main characters dressing up as Data, Worf, Captain Picard and a Borg drone, respectively, in another. Also the series features Wil Wheaton in a recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself plus guest appearances from Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton, and a voice-only cameo from Leonard Nimoy, who voices a Mr. Spock action figure talking to Sheldon in his dreams. There was also an appearance of a Gorn in one episode. The Gorn captain's fight to the death with Captain Kirk in the original Star Trek episode, \\"Arena\\", was the subject of an episode of the television series MythBusters, in which the viability of Kirk's improvised bamboo cannon was put to the test. Parodies and tributes Star Trek has been the subject of a large number of parodies and tributes. Prominent among film parodies is Galaxy Quest, as it parodied the original Star Trek series, elements of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the whole Trekkie phenomenon. On television, the animated series Futurama makes frequent references to Star Trek and parodies some of its better known plot elements on a regular basis, including the character Zapp Brannigan who is based on a combination of Captain Kirk and William Shatner, and cast members of the original series have taken part in one episode.Cook, Lucius (April 26, 2004). Hey Sexy Mama, Wanna Kill All Humans?: Looking Backwards at Futurama, The Greatest SF Show You've Never Seen. Locus Online. Retrieved on July 2, 2007. Prominent examples in other television series include multiple episodes of The Simpsons and Family Guy. The children's series The Backyardigans has an episode titled \\"Garbage Trek\\" that is an homage to the original series. Joss Whedon has cited Star Trek as being the father of his cult series Firefly and its film Serenity (2005). The direct-to-video series VeggieTales features two Star Trek parodies, including \\"The Gourds Must Be Crazy\\" (from Are You My Neighbor?) and Veggies in Space: The Fennel Frontier which serves as a sequel to the other. The character Scooter is based on Montgomery Scott. There are many other parodies in comic strips, music and computer games, such as Eminem's song \\"We Made You\\". In the music video, Eminem was dressed as Mr. Spock and Dr. Dre as Captain Kirk. In 1995, MTV's animated series Beavis and Butt-Head parodied the series with Beavis as Captain Picard and Butt-Head as Commander Riker. An entire Finnish parody series Star Wreck was produced starting in 1992, culminating with Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning in 2005, all available as legal downloads on the web . Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning is a fan-made parody of both Star Trek and Babylon 5. NASA and other institutions have paid explicit tribute to the series in the use of names of ships and characters from the series. Subtle acknowledgments in media and real life include the use of Star Trek ships' registry numbers, especially the Enterprise's NCC-1701. Two episodes of Eek! The Cat parodied Star Trek (with the main character as a Captain Kirk-esque character; one episode featured William Shatner voicing the villain Captain Berserk). In August 2010, the members of the Internal Revenue Service created a six-minute Star Trek themed training video for an agency conference. The video featured a mock set of the Enterprise in one of the agency's studios. The project cost 62 hours of staff time and cost $3,100. Revealed to the public in 2013, the spoof along with parodies of other media franchises was cited as an example of the misuse of taxpayer funds and \\"insulting the beloved sci-fi TV show\\". Animaniacs has made an obvious parody of Star Trek, calling it Star Truck. Another Star Trek band, Warp 11, has released several studio albums. =The Orville= Locations =Canada= A limited number of Famous Players theatres in Canada house large replicas of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A). They can be found in the cities of Thunder Bay, Windsor, Ottawa, Winnipeg, and Richmond. In the Greater Toronto Area, replicas can be seen in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre, and in the SilverCity in Richmond Hill. In addition, a replica of the Sovereign-class USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E) can be found in Laser Planet in Oakville, Ontario as well as in the Colossus theatres, in Langley, British Columbia and Laval, Qu√©bec. The coincidentally-named Vulcan, Alberta hosts Trek-related memorabilia and events. =United States= Plaque honoring the future birthplace of Captain James T. Kirk in Riverside, Iowa. Exit sign for Warp Drive in Dulles, Virginia, one of many Trek-inspired roads in the United States. Riverside, Iowa has proclaimed itself the future birthplace of Captain James T. Kirk. Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, asserts in the book The Making of Star Trek by Stephen Whitfield, that the character of Kirk had been born in the state of Iowa. In March 1985, when the town was looking for a theme for its annual town festival, Steve Miller, a member of the Riverside City Council who had read Roddenberry's book, suggested to the council that Riverside should proclaim itself to be the future birthplace of Kirk. Miller's motion passed unanimously. The council later wrote to Roddenberry for his permission to be designated as the official birthplace of Kirk, and Roddenberry agreed. In the 2009 Star Trek reboot, Riverside is depicted as having a Starfleet shipyard on its outskirts, where the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) was built. The city of Garland, Texas is the first city known to have an official place name based on the television series: \\"Star Trek Lane\\", located off of Apollo Road and east of North Jupiter Road (). The city of Birmingham, Alabama also boasts a \\"Star Trek Lane\\" and \\"Star Trek Circle\\", in the Sunrise East subdivision of its Roebuck neighborhood. The unincorporated Sky Parkway area of South Sacramento has a number of space-themed street names, including Klingon Court and Romulan Court. An unincorporated area near the Las Vegas Strip contains a residential street named \\"Roddenberry Avenue\\". While the mailing address lists the avenue as being located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the physical address is an unincorporated township called \\"Enterprise\\". There is no indication that the township's name has any connection with the Star Trek series, and it is unknown whether or not the street name is a deliberate tribute to the Star Trek creator.Google Maps: Roddenberry Ave. Google.com (1970-01-01). Retrieved on 2011-06-15. Turlock, California has a subdivision with several Trek-themed road names including Picard Lane, Warp Drive, Impulse Lane, Crusher Avenue, and Federation Court. Northern Virginia has a few Star Trek-inspired locations including Warp Drive at the headquarters of local space company Orbital ATK, named such at the request of the company; and the Intelligence and Security Command's Information Dominance Center, whose interior was designed to mimic the bridge of the Enterprise by a Hollywood set designer. The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex of the National Air and Space Museum occasionally hosts set pieces and movie screenings. Star Trek and space exploration The series greatly influenced public interest in the U.S. Space Program and in education on the topic of space exploration. Star Trek: The Original Series ran from 1966 to 1969 benefited from the popularity of the televised Apollo 11 moon landing. The association between Star Trek and NASA grew stronger over time - the first NASA orbiter shuttle, Space Shuttle Enterprise, was named after the USS Enterprise of Star Trek fame.Dumoulin, J. (1994, March 18). Enterprise(OV-101). Retrieved March 10, 2015, from http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/resources/orbiters/enterprise.html The IXS Enterprise, NASA's conceptual design for a superluminal spacecraft, was similarly named after the USS Enterprise in 2014. This connection remained solid throughout the 1990s, when many of the cast members began narrating documentaries about the franchise's content and space exploration. Some of these documentaries were produced in cooperation with NASA itself, most notably the IMAX title Destiny in Space (1994), narrated by Leonard Nimoy. In 2013, NASA produced a 30-second ad to accompany the theatrical release of Star Trek Into Darkness in an effort to bolster support for its space program.Spaleta, S. (n.d.).

Retrieved March 10, 2015, from http://www.space.com/20456-nasa- ad-to-play-before-new-star-trek-movie-video.html In addition, NASA has named a number of asteroids after people or elements connected to the Star Trek franchise: * 2309 Mr. Spock * 4659 Roddenberry * 7307 Takei * 9777 Enterprise * 26733 Nanavisitor * 26734 Terryfarrell * 68410 Nichols * 155142 Tenagra Star Trek and government activities In addition to space exploration, other government activities have been influenced by Star Trek. In 2020 the US effort to develop a vaccine to protect against COVID-19 was named Operation Warp Speed, which is the brainchild of a Star Trek fan, Dr. Peter Marks. Dr. Peters leads the unit at the Food and Drug Administration which approves vaccines and therapies.

She collaborated with Alfred M√©traux on mutual studies of Haitian voodoo. She also studied the Iatmul people of the middle Sepik River in Papua New Guinea, making three fieldwork trips to Tambunum village of 6-7 months each in 1967-1968, 1971, and 1972-1973, focusing on music.See \\"Music in Tambunum,\\" in Sepik Heritage: Tradition and Change in Papua New Guinea, 1990, N.

During World War II, M√©traux headed the section on German morale for the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS). M√©traux was also an important professional and personal partner of Margaret Mead (1901-1978). Together with Mead, she wrote several books and many articles on major issues from the 1950s to the late 1970s. As a contributing editor to Redbook magazine for well over a decade, both wrote many articles on contemporary issues - which largely appeared under Mead's name - that later formed the basis of a number of books including A Way of Seeing. Mead and M√©traux were a close-knit professional team although Mead was intellectual force and gained the most public renown.Hilary Lapsley, 2001, Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict: The Kinship of Women, University of Massachusetts Press, p. 309.

Born at the family seat of Ballymoyer, Synnot settled in the colonies in 1836 with his father Captain Walter Synnot and brothers. A year later two elder sons crossed to Port Phillip, followed in 1838 by the next two, Albert and the 12-year-old Monckton. They brought sheep with them and became pioneer landholders at Little River near Geelong, where they remained in various partnerships for about ten years. By 1852 they had scattered and Monckton, after a brief sortie with Albert to the Californian and Victorian goldfields, was the only one left in the Little River district, as sole owner of the 26,500-acre (10,724 ha) Mowyong, later called Bareacres. In 1852 he assisted in the rescue of the survivors of the flood at the Wedge‚Äôs Werribee Station and rescued the granddaughter Annie Emily Lawrence (daughter of Robert William Lawrence and Anne Wedge). On 25 February 1853 at St Kilda, Melbourne, he married Annie Emily Lawrence. He later bought the South Brighton sheep station in the Wimmera where, in 1862, he was a member of the first Horsham District Roads Board, and a councillor in 1862-63. The prize-winning superfine merino wools of the Western District had been extolled by the Thomas Shaws, C. H. MacKnight, J. L. Currie and others, but in the mid-1860s Synnot's letters to the papers queried their real value and gave rise to a drawn-out and sometimes bitter battle of words. Selling South Brighton in 1868, he bought the large Terrick Terrick station near the Murray River, and for a few years had some share with his brothers Albert, George and Nugent in Gunbar and Cowl Cowl in the Riverina. In 1873 he moved to Melbourne, living in Ballyreen, a mansion on Brighton Road, St Kilda. He bought large central city premises from the merchants and flour-millers, William Degraves & Co., and set up the Flinders Wool Warehouse in Flinders Lane: in this he followed the lead of his elder brother George who, opening in Geelong as a stock and station agent, had held one of the first auction sales of wool there in November 1858. Synnot entered Melbourne wool-broking in prosperous and expansive times, when many firms were offering warehouse services, selling wool by auction or privately, or arranging and often financing its shipping for sale overseas. A pioneer of the wool trade with the East, he visited China, sent a consignment of woollen yarns to Hong Kong and arranged for silk and cotton weavers at Ning-Po to produce samples of woollen cloth, which were exhibited throughout Australia and New Zealand and at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. His efforts failed at first, but later that year when the first Japanese Trade Commission visited Australia his ideas bore some fruit. Synnot died on 23 April 1879 at Elsternwick, aged 52, and was buried in St Kilda general cemetery. The eldest of his seven sons, Monckton Davey Synnot, and three of the younger ones carried on as wool-brokers. Both fathers and his son, Monckton, were tall, handsome, genial and convivial, with the Irish tendency to enjoy a brisk argument, but the senior Monckton was the only one to take any part in public affairs.

It was extensively used towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty (25‚Äì220 CE) when the warlord Cao Cao was the de facto head of the Han central government. Background While the tuntian system was made famous by Cao Cao's administration ( 196‚Äì220 CE), Cao Cao's writings show that the system had been instituted as early as the Western Han dynasty during the reign of Emperor Wu ( 141‚Äì87 BCE), where soldiers on distant expeditions were set to work converting and farming the conquered land, both to provide food for the army and to convert the conquered land into agricultural land. After the death of Emperor Wu, however, the system was only used sporadically and therefore less effectively. The final years of the Eastern Han dynasty ( 189‚Äì220 CE) witnessed great economic disruption and widespread devastation, particularly through the Yellow Turban Rebellion of 184 CE; agricultural production in particular was severely disrupted, and population movements from war-ravaged areas led to massive flows of refugees. It was under these circumstances that Cao Cao's use of the tuntian system made its impact on the economic revival of China after the damage suffered previously. Method The mechanism of the 'civilian tuntian' system as implemented by Cao Cao had its basis in government organisation, encouragement and, to some extent, coercion. Peasants without land, refugees and soldiers were assigned to plots of land which they were to farm, while the implements required (such as ploughs and oxen) were provided by the government at a low price. In exchange for this, the peasant was to give over half of his harvest to the government. The tuntian system had its origins in the military, and for much of the Han dynasty the land in question was farmed by soldiers on orders of the military authorities; in this case all of the crop harvested was to be kept by the military for supply uses, following the example set by Emperor Wu. Cao Cao's innovation was the introduction of the 'civilian tuntian' on a large scale both for common people and for soldiers during peacetime, whereby he successfully solved two great economic problems facing his administration: the large number of unemployed refugees, and the great tracts of land abandoned by big proprietors in the preceding chaos. Impact The tuntian system was to have far-reaching effects, both for Cao Cao himself and for the overall economy of China. Once the scheme had proven successful initially, Cao Cao wasted no time in extending the scheme to all areas under his control; as a result the positive effects of this organised farming was soon felt all over northern China, which he reunified. In the short-term, meanwhile, the tuntian system was also instrumental to the success of Cao Cao's campaigns, many of which were long-range offensives across the plains of northern China; with a massive and efficient agriculture to support his army, he was able to sustain these offensives and gain victory. Overall, the tuntian system, along with the repair of irrigation works, were among the foremost contributions of Cao Cao to the economy of the Han dynasty, and contributed to the enduring strength of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. Other countries The South Vietnamese and Communist Vietnamese colonisation of the Central Highlands have been compared to the historic Nam ti·∫øn of previous Vietnamese rulers. During the Nam ti·∫øn (March to the South), Khmer and Cham territory was seized and militarily colonised (ƒë·ªìn ƒëi·ªÅn) by the Vietnamese which was repeated by the state sponsored colonisation of Northern Vietnamese Catholic refugees on Montagnard land by the South Vietnamese leader Diem and the introduction to the Central Highlands of \\"New Economic Zones\\" by the now Communist Vietnamese government.

The Scheme was built as a joint project between the Electricity Commission of NSW and the NSW Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board. Management has subsequently passed to Origin Energy and the Sydney Catchment Authority. Water supply Water in the scheme is stored in three principal dams and their associated reservoirs: Tallowa Dam, Fitzroy Falls Dam and Wingecarribee Dam. Wingecarribee River is a tributary of Warragamba River, so water pumped into Wingecarribee Reservoir can be released into Warragamba Dam and hence the Sydney water supply. Water can also be released into Nepean Dam via a system of rock cuttings and tunnels known as Glenquarry Cut. Water from the Nepean Dam can be transferred to Sydney, or to Wollongong via Avon Dam. Power generation In addition to its water supply capabilities which supplements water supplies to the Sydney area, the Shoalhaven Scheme also comprises two hydro-power facilities, with total generating capacity of .

It is a white crystalline solid that is insoluble in water and petroleum ether, but well soluble in ethanol, diethyl ether, and benzene. In strongly acidic solutions, it produces an intensely yellow color, due to the formation of a stable \\"trityl\\" carbocation. Many derivatives of triphenylmethanol are important dyes.  History  After the German chemist August Kekul√© and his Belgian student Antoine Paul Nicolas Franchimont (1844‚Äì1919) first synthesized triphenylmethane in 1872,Aug. Kekul√© and A. Franchimont (1872) \\"Ueber das Triphenylmethan\\" (On triphenylmethane), Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft, 5 : 906-908. the Russian doctoral student Walerius Hemilian (1851‚Äì1914) first synthesized triphenylmethanol in 1874 by reacting triphenylmethyl bromide with water as well as by oxidizing triphenylmethane.W. Hemilian (1874) \\"Synthese des Triphenylmethans und des Methyl-phenyl-diphenylmethans\\" (Synthesis of triphenylmethane and of methyl- phenyl-diphenylmethane), Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft, 7 : 1203‚Äì1210 ; see pp. 1206‚Äì1207. Structure and properties Triphenylmethanol contains three phenyl rings and an alcohol group bound to a central tetrahedral carbon atom. All three C‚ÄìPh bonds are typical of sp3-sp2 carbon- carbon bonds with lengths of approximately 1.47 √Ö, while the C‚ÄìO bond length is approximately 1.42 √Ö.Guidebook to Mechanism in Organic Chemistry, Sixth Edition, 1996, Peter Sykes, The presence of three adjacent phenyl groups confers special properties manifested in the reactivity of the alcohol. For example it reacts with acetyl chloride, not to give the ester, but triphenylmethyl chloride: :Ph3COH + MeCOCl ‚Üí Ph3CCl + MeCO2H The three phenyl groups also offer steric protection. Reaction with hydrogen peroxide gives an unusually stable hydroperoxide, Ph3COOH.Bryant E. Rossiter and Michael O. Frederick \\"Triphenylmethyl Hydroperoxide\\" E-EROS Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, 2013. =Acid-base properties= As a derivative of methanol, triphenylmethanol is expected to have a pKa in the range of 16-19. Typical of alcohols, resonance offers no stabilization of the conjugate base due to being bonded to a saturated carbon atom. Stabilization of the anion by solvation forces is largely ineffective due to the steric influence of the three phenyl groups. On the other hand, the basicity of triphenylmethanol is enhanced due to the formation of a resonance-stabilized carbocation upon breaking of the C‚ÄìO bond. After protonation of the oxygen under strongly acidic conditions, triphenylmethanol loses water to form the triphenylmethyl (\\"trityl\\") cation. The trityl cation is one of the easier to isolate carbocations, although it quickly reacts with water. Synthesis The preparation of triphenylmethanol from methyl benzoate or benzophenone and phenylmagnesium bromide is a common laboratory experiment for illustrating the Grignard reaction. An alternative starting material is diethyl carbonate. :Synthesis of triphenylmethanol Applications Although not of major industrial importance, triphenylmethanol is a useful reagent in the research laboratory. Substituted derivatives of triphenylmethanol are intermediates in the production of the commercially useful triarylmethane dyes.

The train departed Union Station in St. Louis, Missouri, at 11:30 p.m. nightly and arrived at Union Station in Chicago, Illinois, at 7 a.m. the following day. In the heyday of overnight travel, from 1920 through the end of World War II, the Midnight Specials were all Pullman Co. trains carrying no coaches and as many as 12 sleeping cars. On December 29/30, 1968, the Midnight Special carried 19 passengers on the last Pullman sleeping car trip between Chicago, Illinois, and St. Louis, Missouri. Operations of the Pullman Company sleeper cars ceased and all leases were terminated on December 31, 1968. On January 1, 1969, the Pullman Company was dissolved and all assets were liquidated. (The most visible result on many railroads, including Union Pacific, was that the Pullman name was removed from the letterboard of all Pullman-owned cars.) An auction of all Pullman remaining assets was held at the Pullman plant in Chicago in early 1970. The Pullman, Inc., company remained in place until 1981 or 1982 to close out all remaining liabilities and claims, operating from an office in Denver. The Midnight Special made its final run on April 30, 1971, although Amtrak continued several other passenger trains over the same route traversed by the Midnight Special.

His name is sometimes given as Alois von Beckh-Widmannst√§tten or Aloys Beck, Edler von Widmannst√§tten. Working life During his youth, he was trained in the printing art by his father. His family owned exclusive printing rights in the Steiermark province, but this was lost in 1784 and Alois sold the business in 1807. In 1804, he ran a spinning mill in Pottendorf, Austria. Starting in 1807, he was placed in charge of the Fabriksproduktenkabinett, a private collection of technology owned by the Emperor. In 1808, he was the director of the Imperial Porcelain works in Vienna. Widmanst√§tten pattern appears when an iron meteorite is sliced, polished and etched with nitric acid  Widmanst√§tten pattern  In 1808, he independently discovered some metallographic patterns in iron meteorites, that came to be called Widmanst√§tten patterns,In a letter of 22 June 1812, German physicist Ernst Chladni told N.A. Neumann, a professor of chemistry in Prague, that Widmanst√§tten had observed patterns in the surface of a meteorite that had been etched with nitric acid.

When, at Schreibers' urging, he wanted to test how a polished slice of the Hraschina [meteorite] behaved during strong heating, [it] didn't attain a uniform color during warming; rather, [there appeared] parts with different colors during warming, which were regularly ordered and yielded fine patterns of lines. ‚Ä¶ Soon thereafter he produced the surface oxidation by treatment with nitric acid instead of heat; he investigated in this way a series of other iron [meteorites] ([from] Mexico, Elbogen [now: Loket, Czech Republic], Lenarto [now in Slovakia]) and used such polished and etched slices to reproduce [impressions of the Widmanst√§tten patterns] directly by printing [i.e., by applying ink to the etched slices] ‚Ä¶.

Loki does this to strike back at his adopted brother Thor, and due to his bitterness that he inadvertently caused the formation of the Avengers.Avengers #1 (Sep. 1963). Marvel Comics The supervillain team consists of Doctor Doom, the Kingpin, Magneto, the Mandarin, the Red Skull, and the Wizard. Loki also attempts to recruit Apocalypse, Cobra, and the Mad Thinker, but they all decline. Loki also approaches Namor, but he rejects the offer stating he is not a villain anymore. To assist the master villains, Loki engineers a jailbreak at the Vault. The lesser villains are then directed against heroes (mainly the Avengers and Spider-Man) who have never fought them before, the theory being that the unfamiliarity will act in the villains' favor. While they did manage to give many of the heroes unusual fights, the plan eventually fails as the master villains fail to cooperate and bicker with each other. An example of this is where Magneto, a mutant and a Jewish Holocaust survivor, attacks the Red Skull, whose Nazi beliefs include a prejudice against mutants, and imprisons him in a buried crypt. The supervillain pawns are defeated by the heroes. A frustrated Loki reveals himself and imprisons the Kingpin, the Mandarin and the Wizard while Doctor Doom is revealed to have been using a Doombot and Magneto is not present. The Avengers track the group and defeat the villains, with Thor forcing Loki to flee back to their native home of Asgard.Avengers West Coast #55 (Feb. 1990). Marvel Comics Loki commits one last act of villainy and fuses three Sentinels to form the robot Tri-Sentinel, so that it can destroy New York City. The Tri- Sentinel is stopped by Spider-Man, who at the time possessed the powers of Captain Universe.Michelinie, David (w), Larsen, Erik (a). The Amazing Spider- Man #329 (Feb. 1990).

History Seal of the Priory of Whithorn. The priory was founded about the middle of the 12th century by Fergus, the Lord of Galloway, (died 1161) during the reign of King David I of Scotland (died 1153), initially for a community of Augustinian monks. Around 1175, the monks were replaced by Premonstratensian canons regular, referred to colloquially in Britain as the White Canons.Hunter-Blair, Oswald. \\"Whithorn Priory.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 21 January 2019] Some time before 1161, the Premonstratensians had been established at Soulseat Abbey.\\"Premonstratensian Cathedral\\", Whithorn Trust The canons of Whithorn formed the cathedral chapter of the Diocese of Galloway, which was re-established about the same time, also by Fergus, the old succession of bishops having died out in the 8th or 9th centuries. The prior stood next in rank to the bishop, as can be seen from the order of signatories to an episcopal charter early in the 13th century; and the community enjoyed the right of electing the bishop, although this right was occasionally overruled in favour of the secular clergy by the Archbishop of York, of which see Galloway was a suffragan see for several centuries. The full list of priors has not been preserved; among them were: Maurice, who swore fealty to King Edward I of England in 1296; Gavin Dunbar (1514), who rose to be Archbishop of Glasgow; and James Beaton, successively Archbishop of Glasgow and of St. Andrews, and chancellor of the kingdom. Whithorn was long a noted place of pilgrimage, owing to its connection with the venerated memory of Saint Ninian. Many Scottish sovereigns, among them Margaret (queen of James III), James IV, and James V, made repeated pilgrimages to the saint's shrine, and left rich offerings behind them. The monastery, thus endowed, became opulent, and its income at its dissolution under the Scottish Reformation was estimated at over ¬£1000. Possibly as a result, the priory was put under the rule of a commendatory prior in 1516. The last Catholic prior, Malcolm Fleming (d. 1568), was committed to prison in 1563 for the crime of saying Mass. The whole property of the priory was vested in the Crown by the annexation act of 1587, and was granted in 1606 by King James VI to the occupant of the See of Galloway when he established Episcopalianism in Scotland in that same year. Dissolution The monastery lands continued to belong to the bishopric until the Revolution of 1688, at which date that see was the richest in the kingdom next to St. Andrews and Glasgow. The priory church, which served also as the cathedral of the diocese, had a long nave without aisles, a choir of about the same length, and a lady chapel beyond. Thomas Sydserf, Bishop of Galloway 1635-8, undertook an ambitious remodelling of the nave. In 1684 the nave and western tower were still intact; but the existing remains consist only of the roofless nave and the extensive vaulted crypts constructed under the eastern end of the church. Such restoration as was possible has been carefully carried out by the third Marquis of Bute. The complex is now a scheduled monument. Excavation The Cathedral was subject to a major excavation and restoration 1n 1886/7 by William Galloway at the expense of John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute.http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=201483 Burials *Walter of Whithorn *Henry of Holyrood *Simon de Wedale *Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus (heart buried at Douglas, South Lanarkshire) Gallery Image:St. Ninian's Priory, from Bruce Street, Whitehorn..jpgSt. Ninian's Priory from Bruce Street Image:Stninianschapel.jpgSaint Ninian's Chapel See also * Church of Scotland * Scottish Episcopal Church * Roman Catholic Church in Scotland * Prior of Whithorn, for a list of priors and commendators * Isle of Whithorn References External links * Archaeological and Historical Collections relating to Ayrshire and Galloway (1894), vol.VII. pp. 53‚Äì55 Category:Medieval cathedrals in Scotland Category:History of Galloway Category:Premonstratensian monasteries in Scotland Category:Former cathedrals in Scotland Category:Historic Environment Scotland properties Category:Christian monasteries established in the 12th century Category:Monasteries dissolved under the Scottish Reformation Category:Historic Scotland properties in Dumfries and Galloway Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Dumfries and Galloway Category:Former Christian monasteries in Scotland Category:Whithorn ","title":"Whithorn Priory"},{"id":"3930663","text":"Crystal LaTresa Robinson (born January 22, 1974) is an American basketball coach and former player who is currently an assistant coach for the Dallas Wings. She grew up in Atoka, Oklahoma, and first garnered national recognition during her collegiate career at Southeastern Oklahoma State University. Professionally, Robinson played for the Colorado Xplosion of the ABL before playing in the WNBA for the New York Liberty and Washington Mystics. After retiring from playing basketball, Robinson first became an assistant coach for the Washington Mystics in 2007, then became head coach at McAlester High School in 2009, leading the Lady Buffaloes to a 5A state championship, and at the junior college level at Murray State College in Oklahoma in 2010. Robinson moved to the Division I ranks in 2013 as an assistant coach at Utah State in 2013‚Äì14 and TCU in 2014‚Äì15 before returning to her alma mater to coach girls' basketball at Atoka High School. High school Robinson was raised in Atoka, Oklahoma and attended Atoka High School, where she was named a High School All-American by the WBCA. She participated in the inaugural WBCA High School All-America Game in 1992, scoring a game-high twenty-five points, and earning MVP honors. College Considered by most to be the best player to ever come out of Oklahoma, Robinson signed with NCAA power Louisiana Tech out of Atoka High School but later decided she wanted to be closer to home and transferred to Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant, OK before playing a single game in Louisiana. Robinson went on to earn her bachelor's degree in health, physical education and recreation. She averaged 26.9 ppg, 10.4 rpg and six apg during her collegiate career and is the all-time Southeastern leader in points, rebounds, assists, and steals. She scored a career-high 60 points against rival East Central in her senior year, which remains the most point scored in a game in the history of Oklahoma women's basketball. Robinson was a three-time NAIA first-team All-American who led the nation in scoring in 1994 and '95 and was named the NAIA Women's Basketball National Player of the Year in 1996 after leading Southeastern to NAIA runner-up finishes in 1995 and '96, dropping a pair of one-point decisions in back-to-back championship games to Southern Nazarene. Despite losing in the NAIA championship game in 1995 and '96, both years Robinson was named the NAIA Women's Basketball National Tournament MVP and still holds the NAIA career national tournament record for points score with 177. C-Rob rewrote the Southeastern record book in her three seasons in a Savages uniform from 1993‚Äì96, ranking in the top ten in all but one statistical category (Field Goal Percentage in a season). Robinson is SE's all-time career leader in points (3,023), rebounds (1,165), assists (547), and steals (376), while ranking second in career blocks (162). Robinson is also the school's all-time leader for points in a season (1,032), scoring average in a season (30.4), field goals made (377) in a season, three-point field goals made in a season (116), rebounds (420) in a season, assists in a season (191), steals in a season (130). Robinson also hit one of the more amazing shots ever, in the 1995 national semifinal game against Lipscomb (Tenn.), banking in a game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer while parallel to the floor and draped by three defenders. Crystal Robinson has been inducted into the Southeastern Athletic Hall of Fame, NAIA Hall of Fame (joining Kelly Litsch of Southwestern Oklahoma State University and Jo Metzger of Western Washington University and becoming just the third women's basketball player inducted into the NAIA Hall of Fame), and the Jim Thorpe Oklahoma Hall of Fame. She was also chosen to The Daily Oklahoman All-Century First Team for both Oklahoma high schools and Oklahoma universities. Professional career Robinson began her professional career in 1996‚Äì97 playing for the Colorado Xplosion in the American Basketball League. She was named the ABL Rookie of the Year, which she says is the award in her playing career she is most proud, and an ABL All- Star in 1997. After the ABL abruptly folded in December 1998, Robinson was selected 6th overall in the 1999 WNBA draft by the New York Liberty. She played seven years for the franchise and - alongside WNBA great Teresa Weatherspoon and all-stars Tari Phillips, Sue Wicks and Becky Hammon - and helped the Liberty to four-straight WNBA Playoff berths and three WNBA Finals. Robinson averaged 10.2 ppg, 2.7 rpg and 1.1 spg over 30.1 mpg during her eight-year WNBA career. In her first WNBA season, C-Rob led the WNBA in three- pointers made with 76 while her .437 shooting percentage from beyond the arc ranked her fourth in the league. She led the team in scoring eight times and recorded three 20+ scoring games leading the Liberty past the Charlotte Sting in the Eastern Conference Finals (2‚Äì1) before falling to the Houston Comets (2‚Äì1) in the 1999 WNBA Finals. In 2000, Robinson was top scoring threat both as a starter and off the bench as she helped lead the Liberty to the top seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. She hit double figures in scoring 13 times, including five consecutive games from June 23 to July 1. That year the Liberty swept the fourth-seeded Washington Mystics in the first round of the playoffs and defeated the second-seeded Cleveland Rockers (2‚Äì1) in the Conference Finals before falling in the 2000 WNBA Finals to the Houston Comets. In 2001, Robinson turned in another solid campaign starting all 32 games and authored 19 double-figure scoring games. She averaged 11.5 ppg in the playoffs that season (16th on WNBA Playoff leader board) leading the team to an opening round sweep of Miami before being eliminated by the Charlotte Rockers in the Eastern Conference Finals (2‚Äì1). In 2002, Robinson started all 32 games and helped the Liberty back to the championship series for the third time in four seasons where they fell to the Los Angeles Sparks in the 2002 WNBA Finals. She recorded her 1,000th career point on June 2 vs. Miami, scored in double-figures 21 times, led team in scoring nine times, and hit at least one shot from downtown in 27 of 32 games. In 2003, Robinson had a career-high in points per game (12.0) while starting 33 of the Liberty's 34 games. She recorded 1,500th career point on July 15 vs. Washington and led team in scoring 10 times, ranking second on team in steals (40), and fourth in assists (63). C-Rob scored in double figures 21 times, including four consecutive 10-or-more point games and four 20+ point games. But the Liberty (16‚Äì18) finished sixth in the east and failed to make the playoffs for only the second time in franchise history that year. In 2004, Robinson started all but one of the Liberty's 28 games and finished with 12.1 points and 3.1 rebounds per game on .437 shooting from the floor and .930 from the free throw line. She recorded 2,000th career point vs. Connecticut on September 10 as the Liberty finished the regular season (18‚Äì16) in a tie for first place in the conference standings with the Connecticut Sun who they would eventually fall to in the Eastern Conference Finals. Robinson's shooting percentage (30.3%) and scoring (7.3 ppg) dropped to career lows in her final season with the Liberty in 2005 as Robinson battled some nagging injuries. She recorded 500th career rebound on May 26 versus Indiana and the Liberty earned the three-seed in the 2005 WNBA season but were swept by Indiana Fever in the opening round of the playoffs. In the 2005‚Äì06 Euroleague season, Robinson played for Spartak Moscow of the Russian Women's Basketball Premier League. Averaging 9.5 points and 3.2 rebounds, Robinson helped Spartak Moscow earn the FIBA EuroCup title. On February 8, 2006, Robinson signed with the Washington Mystics and played her final two seasons of professional basketball in our nation's capital. She appeared in 29 games in 2006 and 2007 before her retirement. After appearing in just two games during the 2007 season, she became an assistant coach for the Washington Mystics. Coaching career Robinson announced her retirement on June 1, 2007, to become an assistant coach with the Washington Mystics. After coaching with the Washington Mystics, she went back to Oklahoma to coach high school girls basketball for the McAlester High School Lady Buffaloes for a single season, where she guided the Lady Buffs to a 5A Oklahoma State title in her only season as head coach. On December 23, 2009, she became the women's basketball head coach at Murray State College, a junior college in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, effective in the 2010‚Äì11 season. The Murray State Lady Aggies had an overall record of 79‚Äì37 under her watch. In May 2013, Robinson joined Jerry Finkbeiner's staff at Utah State where she stayed for one season. The following season, Robinson was an assistant at TCU under Raegan Pebley. In January 2018, she was hired as an assistant coach for the Seattle Storm, and went on to win the 2018 WNBA championship with the team. In February 2019, she was hired as an assistant coach with the Dallas Wings under coach Brian Agler.

He is a deadly bow-wielding assassin and contract killer who serves as the archenemy of Green Arrow, though writers have developed him over the years as an adversary of other superheroes in the DC Universe as well, such as Batman and Black Canary. In 2012, the character made his live-action debut on The CW's television series Arrow, portrayed by actor John Barrowman under the name Malcolm Merlyn. Publication history Created by Mike Friedrich, Neal Adams, and Dick Dillin, Merlyn made his debut in Justice League of America #94 in November 1971. In 2012, The CW's live-action TV show Arrow introduced Malcolm Merlyn as the first season's main antagonist, and his son Tommy Merlyn as Oliver Queen's best friend, a concept that would later be integrated into the comics. John Barrowman, who portrays Malcolm Merlyn in the series, and with his sister Carole, has written the digital comic Arrow: The Dark Archer, which is centered on the character. The present day narrative takes place between the third and fourth seasons of the show, while flashbacks detail Malcolm's past as Arthur King. Fictional character biography Long before becoming the vigilante Green Arrow, Oliver Queen was inspired to take up archery after hearing of the exploits of Arthur King, otherwise known as \\"Merlyn the Magician\\", a master archer with acute accuracy. Years later, Merlyn challenged the Green Arrow to a public archery duel and defeated Oliver. With that victory under his belt, Merlyn vanished for years before resurfacing as a member of the League of Assassins. During his time with the League of Assassins, Merlyn took part in the highly abusive training of David Cain's daughter Cassandra Cain, unknowingly being behind the girl's skills as Batgirl. He and Green Arrow faced each other again when Merlyn attempted to assassinate Batman; Green Arrow managed to intercept Merlyn's arrow with one of his own, saving Batman's life. Merlyn admitted that Green Arrow had improved since their last encounter, but escaped before he could be captured.

Now a deadly assassin known as the Dark Archer, Malcolm is contracted by Cyrus Broderick, a director of the Ninth Circle criminal organization, to frame the Green Arrow (Oliver Queen) for murder after he destroyed the Inferno, their base of operations that hosted their \\"bank\\" and resources.Green Arrow Vol. 6 #12 (February 2017).

The digital comic Arrow: The Dark Archer reveals that his birth name is Arthur King. * The character is introduced on Arrow as the wealthy CEO of Merlyn Global Group. Fueled by his wife's murder in the Glades (a crime-infested area of Starling City), Malcolm left his son Tommy Merlyn, and trained with the League of Assassins in Nanda Parbat, where he took the name The Magician (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿßÿ≠ÿ± Al Sa-Her). After several years, Malcolm returned to Starling City to plot an \\"undertaking\\" that would destroy the Glades with an earthquake-generating device. When Robert Queen tried to extradite himself from the plan, Malcolm arranged for the bombing of Robert's yacht, marooning Oliver on the island of Lian Yu.

In season four, Merlyn resurrects Sara with the Lazarus Pit to appease Thea and Laurel Lance. Later, Nyssa al Ghul leads a rebel faction of the League of Assassins against Malcolm. Malcolm chooses to maintain power rather than hand leadership to Nyssa in exchange for a cure to save Thea's life (from deteriorating Lazarus Pit exposure and blood lust).

As of the 2017/2018 season there are eight clubs based in Paris (2 teams), Bordeaux, Perpignan, Toulouse, Blagnac, Lyon, and Cergy-Pontoise that compete in the national league. The Commission Nationale de Football Australien (CNFA) is the official governing body for Australian Football in France. In addition to the teams that compete in the national league, there are a number of other teams either in formation or playing in friendly and cup matches, these teams are located in Strasbourg, Bayonne, Montpellier, Lille and Antony. There are four tournaments held annually, the national league known as the French National Championship (\\"Championnat National\\") and three cup competitions; the French Cup (\\"Coupe de France\\"), North Cup (\\"Coupe du Nord\\") and South Cup (\\"Coupe du Sud\\"). History Australian rules football was played by Australian armed forces at Poperinge in 1916.http://www.pictureaustralia.org/apps/pictureaustralia?action=PADisplay&mode;=display&rs;=resultset-781993&no;=290 P00046.050 Australian War Memorial A match was also recorded as being played in Le Havre.Australian War Memorial H85.55/160/134 Australian football was first shown in France on Canal+ television in the 1980s. Aussie Rules had been played sporadically in the 1990s by clubs in Paris and Normandy, with the formation of the first club, Houquetot in Normandy. With the support of the Australian embassy, the club became the Montivilliers in 1998 and was nicknamed \\"Tasmania\\" in reference to the Australian state. The first game was played against Australians in 1998, but the club disappeared the following year. it wasn't until 2003-04 when the first stable teams began to appear, the first two being the primarily Australian-expat based Paris Cockerels and the mainly French Strasbourg Kangaroos. The first footy match on record between two 100% French teams was played in Strasbourg on 3 December 2005, with the hometown Kangaroos defeating the Senlis Razorbacks 91-17. A promotional match was played in March 2006 between English club Reading Kangaroos and a French national side in front of between 500 and 700 spectators in Perpignan, including a sizeable media presence.World Footy News - French almost pull off an upset against the Reading Roos Owing to the long distances between clubs, there was no national league as such prior to the inaugural 2009 season. Strasbourg competed in the Australian Football League Germany for 2006, with the Saint Esteve Saints considering joining the Catalan AFL for their 2007 season before going into recess. The first French Cup was held in Paris in 2008, with Paris, Strasbourg, Montpellier and Bordeaux taking part. Further expansion saw the first French National Championship held in 2009 formed by the same 4 teams, and continued growth with the introduction of the Perpignan Tigers and Andorra Crows to the league in 2009/2010 alongside a change to the winter season format with the season generally lasting from October to June with a winter break over Christmas that continues today. Montpellier fell out of the league after the 2009/2010 season and were replaced by the Marseille Dockers. In order to reduce travelling costs and challenges, the league was split into a North and South division and for the first time a final series was held to determine the league champion. With an aim to increasing the competitiveness of the competition the league format was changed again for the 2011/2012 season with the introduction of a developmental league and a super league. The development league contained Perpignan alongside Montpellier and the re-branded Aix-Marseille Dockers, whilst the Paris Cockerels, Bordeaux Bombers, Toulouse Hawks and Strasbourg Kangaroos competed in the super league. Perpignan left the development league the following season (2012/2013), replaced by the newly formed Cergy-Pontoise Coyotes. A period of structural change occurred in advance of the 2013/2014 season. Due to lack of numbers the Perpignan Tigers and Aix-Marseille Dockers left the league however the first team from Lyon, the ALFA Lions, were created and entered the league. The league also returned to its original format, with all teams competing against each-other in one league, a structure that continues today. Currently, the league is experiencing strong growth and can lay claims to being one of the largest competitions in mainland Europe. Growth and participation are strongly focused on local players, given there are few Australian expatriates playing in the league outside of the Paris-based teams. Strong local participation has seen the introduction in 2015 of a second team from the Paris Cockerels club, the Paris Cockatoos, as well as a second team from the Toulouse Hawks in 2016, the Blagnac Aviators. The Brittany Griffons also made their debut in the 2016 Coupe du Nord (North Cup). The French champions have also participated in the European Champions league (a cup competition for the champion teams of each league in Europe) in 2015 and 2016 finishing 4th and 5th in the first two occurrences of the competition. The national team also had the opportunity play an exhibition match in April 2016 at the Stade Velodrome before a Toulon Top 14 rugby union match. Each year since 2009 a match has been played at Villers-Bretonneux between an Australian and French football side to commemorate ANZAC Day. This event has increased in stature every year with approximately 8,000 people attending the Dawn service at the Australian memorial. National team The first French national Aussie Rules team appeared at the 2005 EU Cup in London. In September 2007 the French national Aussie Rules team competed in the 2007 EU Cup in Hamburg, finishing 7th overall with a record of 3 wins from 6 matches and have competed in each following Euro Cup, hosting the competition in Bordeaux in 2013 where they achieved their best finish, 2nd place. The \\"Coqs\\" first participated in the Australian Football International Cup in 2011, finishing second in second division and gaining a creditable 14th place out of 18 participants and gaining plenty of local support. In the 2014 event, the French team improved their performance further by qualifying for division 1, finishing 11th of the 12 division 1 teams, and 11th of 18 overall. At the 2017 cup the French team finished 10th out of 18 teams. Current clubs =Paris Cockerels= The Paris Cockerels are the oldest French Australian football club still in activity.

The principal purpose of the dam is for potable water supply for Sydney's southern suburbs and the northern suburbs of the Illawarra region. The impounded reservoir is also called Woronora Dam and is sometimes incorrectly called Lake Woronora. The dam was designed by G. E. Haskins, Chief Engineer and the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board of NSW (MWS&DB;) and built from 1927 to 1941 by the MWS&DB.; The property is owned by the Sydney Catchment Authority, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999. History Water was first supplied to the Sutherland Shire in 1911 when a pipe was laid from Penshurst Reservoir across Georges River at Tom Ugly's Point to Miranda. In 1920 a scheme to supply water from the Woronora River to Sutherland and Cronulla was rejected. It was resurrected five years later when the then Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board became the sole constructing authority for water supply works in the metropolitan area. The scheme involved the construction of a dam, which could be increased in size if necessary, on the Woronora River, about upstream of its junction with the Georges River. Construction of the dam began in 1927, the fifth dam built as part of Sydney's water supply. As forecast, the size of the dam wall had to be increased two years later. Workers' accommodation was spartan but functional with small bungalows built of fibrolite and placed on brick or concrete piers on the sloping ground. In 1930 The Depression intervened, suspending work on the dam. The men were forced to look for work further afield, even interstate, often leaving their families behind to live on the Woronora site. Some families had strong ties to the history of Sydney's dams, moving from the Nepean Dam project to Woronora, and then onto Warragamba. Other workers on Woronora Dam were former coal miners from nearby Helensburgh. Late in 1931 the Unemployment Relief Account released funds to build a weir to provide water to the Sutherland-Cronulla area and four years later, work resumed on the dam itself. Woronora Dam was completed in 1941 at a cost of about 13 million. The dam is the only one of Sydney's water supply dams which is not part of the Upper Nepean/Warragamba/Shoalhaven interconnected system. The dam was built with the objective of supplementing Sydney's water supply whilst the much larger Warragamba Dam was constructed. Six of the cottages were retained for on-site maintenance staff housing while the rest of Woronora township site was turned into picnic and recreational areas. Features and location Woronora Dam is curved in appearance and is a mass gravity dam, remaining in position under its own weight. The dam wall has a height of and a length of . Its lower levels are built of cyclopean masonry - massive sandstone blocks that were quarried on site. The main wall is made from blue metal and gravel concrete and there are two inspection galleries located inside. The dam has a separate, serpentine overflow spillway that discharges floodwater at the rate of through a concrete lined cutting into the river downstream of the dam. In 1988 Woronora Dam was upgraded at a cost of A$2.9 million by a system of wall and foundation drains to meet international dam safety standards. The catchment area together with the facilities at the dam are managed by the Sydney Catchment Authority. While there are no towns in the catchment area, parts of the Princes Highway, Heathcote Road and the Illawarra railway line pass through the area and the urban areas of Sutherland and are nearby. Raw water from Woronora Dam is pumped to the adjacent Woronora Water Filtration Plant. This plant is one of nine in Sydney either operated by Sydney Water or privately owned and operated under contract to Sydney Water. The dam and water filtration plant supply water to the areas south of the Georges River including Sutherland, Helensburgh, Otford, Stanwell Tops, Stanwell Park, Coalcliff, Lucas Heights and Bundeena. The Maritime Operations Division within the Department of Defence use the Woronora Dam reservoir to test its sonar facilities. The testing station is on a pontoon in the middle of the reservoir. The dam can be viewed by the public, and has a walking trail across the dam wall, and a picnic area including a carpark. Woronora Dam Road leads from the Princes Highway for seven kilometres to the dam. Popular culture The building of the Woronora Dam became part of the backdrop of the comedy drama Dad Rudd MP. The film featured several construction scenes and employed many workers and their families as 'extras'.  Heritage listing  As at 10 September 2009, the Woronora Dam, constructed between 1927 and 1941, was the fifth and last of the water supply dams constructed prior to the Second World War to provide a secure water supply to satisfy the demands of industrial, commercial and residential development of metropolitan Sydney up to . The Woronora Dam was specifically built to service metropolitan areas south of the Georges River. The foundation and wall drainage systems, and the Stripped Classical architectural expression of the crest and valve houses, collectively continue to be integral elements of an Inter-war (s) era high, curved, gravity dam in New South Wales. The scale of the use of mass concrete in the upper portions of the dam wall is unique in New South Wales for the period. The design of the spillway incorporating the zig zag weir wall and diversion channels are likely to represent an early and notable technological advancement in the design of such structures. The Woronora Dam is part of a group (in conjunction with the Metropolitan Dams) of like structures which are the State's largest and most intact ensemble of large dams completed prior to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electricity Scheme within a well defined geographical area. The Dam contains in-situ items of Inter-war era water delivery technologies developed by the Water Board, such as lengths of iron discharge pipes, emergency roller gate, stopboards and penstocks which in consideration of their scale and integrity are rare examples of their types. The welded mild steel delivery pipeline (of which only a small section is included in the heritage curtilage) similarly represents a notable advance in construction technology for the period. The site of the Woronora Dam contains remnants of the construction platforms, roadways blasted out of the hillside for plant and machinery, and the sites of the township specifically established for the construction of the Dam that collectively continue to evoke the era of the dam's construction, which in consideration of the scale and permanent nature of the works represent a notable achievement in civil engineering practice. The dam is a regional landmark that has engendered beautification works undertaken from the 1950s for the general visiting public. The picnic areas in particular have strong associations with past management practices of the Water Board. The grounds of the dam are associated with the local and regional community of Sydney as a longstanding place of passive recreation. Woronora Dam was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. In providing water for southern suburbs of metropolitan Sydney the Woronora Dam, in ensuring security of supply, contributed to the extensive residential and commercial development of Sutherland from the 1930s. Woronora Dam was constructed over a period of ten years between 1927 and 1941, a protracted construction period which is directly related to the Great Depression and a period of government financial stringency. The completion of the Dam during this period was one of the major public works projects undertaken in the State. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The design and construction of Woronora Dam was undertaken by the Construction Branch of the Water Board. The construction of the Dam drew upon the knowledge and experience of a number of the engineers including Gerald Haskins (the first engineer-in-chief of the former Water Board), Stanley T. Farnsworth and (Sir) William Hudson (best known for his role in the Snowy Mountains Hydro Electricity Scheme). The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The wall of Woronora Dam is an engineering work imbued with a sense of high aesthetic value expressed through the long curved high wall set with the wide valley of the Woronora River. Upstream of the dam wall this setting is characterised by the broad expanse of the pool of water bordered by the crests of the valley sides. Downstream of the dam wall the setting is characterised by forested hillsides. Collectively this topography at times of high water level imparts a picturesque scene when viewed from select vantage points above and on the dam wall. The design and finishes of the crest house and lower valve house in the Inter War Stripped Classical style were prepared by the engineers of the Water Board. The architectural detailing evokes a sense of monumentalism that is ideally suited to the context of a dam, and is not exhibited elsewhere on this scale. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The dam wall and spillway is recognised by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) as being a place which is part of the cultural environment of Australia, which has aesthetic, historical, architectural, archaeological, scientific, social significance for future generations, as well as for the present community of New South Wales. The Woronora Dam is recognised by the Heritage Council of N.S.W. as a place which is of significance to New South Wales in relation to its historical, scientific, cultural, social, archaeological, natural and aesthetic values. The grounds of the Dam are likely to be associated by members of the community with the construction township, in particular for the period of the Great Depression when considerable numbers of families who resided at the place during those turbulent years. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The dam wall is an excellent late example of gravity dam construction in the Inter-war era in incorporating inspection galleries, contraction joints, and ground surface drainage system which demonstrate the principal characteristics of this technology at the time. The use of mass concrete in the upper section of the wall is likely to represent a major innovation in terms of dam construction technology at the time. The terraces and platforms adjoining the dam wall abutments demarcate the location of plant and equipment used in the construction of the Dam, in particular the location of the cableway head towers, and concrete mixing plant, which may potentially provide further insight into Inter-war era construction practices. The hillside near the upper picnic area and area alongside the road of access were the sites of the original construction township. These areas retain a road formation, drainage lines, concrete platforms and dry packed walls from that era. The integrity is such that collectively these features may potentially provide further insight into the lifestyles of the employees that constructed the Dam. The catchment area in being relatively untouched bushland in close proximity to a major urban area has a high potential for further research into natural ecosystems. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The construction technique of mass concrete in the upper sections of the dam wall is a first in New South Wales in dam construction on this scale. It was a technique that came to be exemplified in the construction of the Captain Cook Graving Dock and Warragamba Dam. The size of the dam is unusual given the primary reason behind its construction was the supply of the suburban areas south of the Georges River. Other comparable sized dams are located in the adjoining Metropolitan Catchment which service the greater metropolitan area of Sydney. The design of the spillway weir with its zig zag wall and diversion channels is likely to be unique in New South Wales for the time of construction. The use of a welded mild steel pipeline (the majority of the length of the pipeline is outside the scope of this report) to delivery the water to Penshurst is a first in New South Wales. The Dam is one of two extant dams in New South Wales that incorporate extensive Inter War Stripped Classical architectural detailing in the crest wall and superstructures of the valve and crest house. The crest and valve houses and inlet works retain original ironwork which represent a substantial repository of water supply delivery technology for the era. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Woronora Dam is representative of a type of gravity dam constructed in New South Wales by the Water Supply and Sewerage Branch of the NSW Public Works Department and Water Board during the first half of the twentieth century. Key representative attributes of the Dam's design and construction include the use of cyclopean masonry bedded in sandstone concrete in the lower section of wall, use of blue metal concrete in the wall facings, use of a spillway set way from the gravity wall, valve and crest houses attractively designed and finished to a high standard, the use of an array of upstream intakes to regulate the quality of water supply, the internal inspection gallery, the foundation drainage system, the contraction joints, and the drainage system. The upgrading of the valves and ancillary monitoring and operating equipment is representative of modern-day safe operating practice. The construction technologies used at Woronora Dam are representative of dams constructed in New South Wales through the first half of the twentieth century. Key representative attributes include the use of cableways, the building of temporary camps to house labourers and tradesmen, building of semi-permanent cottages to house salaried staff, the construction of terraced platforms to for plant and machinery, mechanisation of concrete production, the construction of a purpose built road of access to transport men, supplies and materials from the nearest railhead to the construction site, the building of permanent infrastructure such as water supply for construction plant, men and horses, and the use of electricity to power plant and equipment. The rehabilitation of tracts of land scarred in the construction processes employed at Woronora Dam through beautification works is representative of practices undertaken at other dams throughout New South Wales. Key representative attributes of this practice include utilising the former terraced construction platforms as picnic areas and lookouts, and utilising the former construction roads and tramway for vehicular access to the dam site and dam wall. The practice of ongoing maintenance of the dam wall and pipeline after completion through surveillance provided by resident staff is representative of procedures undertaken at other dams and weirs constructed in New South Wales. The provision of public amenity at the Dam is representative of the use of large water supply and irrigation dams in New South Wales as places for recreation by the greater community.

The airfield is an operational base, but is leased by the Wagga Wagga City Council on a 30-year lease from the Australian Department of Defence, with RAAF Base Wagga being a ground training base. The airfield is still used by military aircraft, mostly transport aircraft transporting freight or passengers. Regional Express maintains its fleet of Saab 340 passenger and freight aircraft at Wagga Wagga Airport.  History  QantasLink Bombardier Dash 8 (DHC-8 402) aircraft at Wagga Wagga Airport Regional Express Saab 340B During 1939, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) were looking to establish an inland training base. Pursuing this, Group Captain A. H. \\"Harry\\" Cobby (top scoring World War I ace) contacted Wagga resident Hughie Condon and asked him to suggest possible sites suitable for the establishment of an RAAF station. Condon was well suited to the task, being regional Examiner of Airmen with the Department of Defence. He recommended a site at the village of Forest Hill, this being situated about five nautical miles east of Wagga. The site was situated above the Murrumbidgee flood plain and was of suitable dimension. It was already serviced by rail, offered frontage to the Sturt Highway, and was sufficiently distant from the town of Wagga Wagga. Cobby flew to inspect the site, arriving in an RAAF Avro Anson. He agreed with Condon's assessment and the go-ahead was soon given. The identified land was resumed from the Brunskill and Lyons families in the first half of 1939 and before long, a Fearnes bus was shuttling workers to the site. It is of note that this was planned as a permanent base and preceded the Empire Air Training Scheme. At this time the Wagga Wagga Council (not yet a city) operated a civilian aerodrome. This was located on Hammond Avenue, East Wagga Wagga. Many other councils had hoped to host the new base. The Mayor of Junee, H.G. Weaver, claimed that Junee was a better choice, claiming it was less susceptible to fog, had flatter surrounding terrain and could offer railway workshops (the roundhouse) for aircraft repair. The mayor of Narromine was unhappy that his suggested site was not even inspected. The building layout was carefully designed so as to enable the aircraft landing area to have potential for 'all over' operations. Aircraft could potentially touch down anywhere, in any direction, according to the pilots' operational needs. RAAF Forest Hill became operational on 29 July 1940 and initially was home to 2SFTS. Service Flying Training Schools conducted advanced training of graduates of the Elementary Flying Training Schools. At the close of World War II, civilian flying recommenced. A decision was made to accommodate civilian flying operations at Forest Hill. A Bellman hangar was allocated for civilian use and Mobil/Vacuum installed an aircraft refuelling facility. At this time the council aerodrome on Hammond Avenue fell into disuse. With new transport aircraft, such as the Convair Metropolitan, coming into widespread use, it was decided to construct a bitumen runway. This was timed so as to be completed for Queen Elizabeth IIs visit to Wagga in 1954.Transcript of interview with grandson of H.Condon by F.Burke.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/australi/cobby.phpSydney Morning Herald Sat. 11 March 1939http://www.waggabiketyres.comhttp://www.wwdhs.org.au/wp- content/uploads/2012/07/raaf-base-history-20120723.pdf Royal Australian Air Force Boeing 737-BBJ at Wagga Wagga Airport On 28 January 1992 the Wagga Wagga City Council secured a 30-year lease from the Commonwealth of Australia which included a $2 million to upgrade the airport's runway to allow it to handle Boeing 737s. In June 2009, Wagga Wagga Airport was listed third for the world's strangest sounding airports. In December 2009, a $2.2 million upgrade to increase its capacity for future growth and to improve the security at the airport was completed. On 27 May 2010, Anthony Albanese announced that the federal government would provide funding worth A$1.05 million, as part of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, to the Wagga Wagga City Council for the installation of the A$1.63 million Instrument Landing System (ILS), which were only found in all of Australia's capital cities.

On 27 May 2010, AAPA campus at Wagga Wagga Airport was officially opened by Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Anthony Albanese.  Future  Wagga Wagga City Council publicly released the Wagga Wagga Airport draft master plan in April 2010, which is to establish direction for future development at the airport over a 20-year period. Part of the master plan includes blueprints for a new airport terminal, capability to accommodate jets and business ventures. In April 2011, a joint tender for security upgrades for baggage and passenger screening was called for Wagga Wagga, Tamworth and Dubbo Airports, which is to be completed by July 2012. Wagga Wagga City Council will receive A$650,000 from the federal government to purchase the baggage and passenger screening equipment, with the council funding A$162,000 to install the equipment. In the 2011-12 financial year, Wagga Wagga City Council will develop a commercial aviation precinct at a cost of A$6.8 million, to attract aviation industries to the airport. Council will also allocate A$1.5 million for construction of 29 hangars for general aviation. The airport improvements funding will be partly paid by the introduction of parking fees at the airport's carpark. In September 2011, it was announced that Douglas Aerospace would be centralising its operations at the airport by April 2012, which will see the council's construction of two hangars speeded up.

Written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and directed by John T. Kretchmer, the episode premiered on UPN on October 12, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter) at the request of her stepson, Cassidy \\"Beaver\\" Casablancas (Kyle Gallner) and eventually finds some important information about Logan (Jason Dohring). Meanwhile, Veronica tries to help Wallace (Percy Daggs III) get a date with Jackie Cook (Tessa Thompson).  Synopsis  Veronica attends a Future Business Leaders of America meeting to build up her r√©sum√©, headed by Dick Casablancas, Sr. (David Starzyk). After class, Beaver talks to Veronica about his step-mother's cheating and pays her $1,000 for the case. After finding \\"Veronica Mars\\" written on a dead body's palm, Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) takes Veronica in for questioning. The man is David \\"Curly\\" Moran, whom Veronica met at the site of the bus crash. Sheriff Lamb threatens Veronica. Keith asks Alicia (Erica Gimpel) to a romantic getaway in Chicago, and she accepts. Veronica researches Kendall and her possible relationship to Curly Moran. Veronica asks Keith (Enrico Colantoni) whether he is going to propose to Alicia, and he says no. Veronica tracks Kendall, and she talks to an unspecified man. They go to a cheap motel, and Veronica takes a picture. Jackie comes and sits at Veronica and Wallace's table. Veronica, in order to help Wallace out, invites him and Jackie on a double date to watch the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Beaver is not satisfied with the pictures, and Veronica requests more money for the \\"money shot.\\" Veronica goes to Curly's place of work, where she finds Curly's possessions, including a picture of Curly with Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin). In another FBLA class, Logan makes a snide remark to Duncan (Teddy Dunn), and they end up fighting. Veronica, Duncan, Wallace, and Jackie go on their double date, and Jackie is dominating the conversation irritatingly. However, Duncan and Wallace both find her interesting. At the gym, Veronica talks to Kendall. She tracks Kendall to the beach, where she is meeting the same man at the Sandpiper, which Mr. Casablancas advertised as a resort. Veronica talks to the business teacher about real estate fraud and informs him that Mr. Casablancas is inflating his company's stock value. Keith and Alicia enjoy their date, but a police officer asks for Keith and Alicia's names and where they are staying. Jackie walks into the coffee shop with another man, but Jackie says nothing the next day with Wallace. Veronica sets up a camera which takes pictures every 15 seconds in Kendall's room, and Logan is shirtless in several. Veronica shows Beaver the pictures, and when Veronica is away for a second, Beaver suddenly disappears and leaves the pictures on the screen, and Veronica finds out about Logan and Kendall's affair. Neither Beaver or Logan comes to school the next day. The police officer finds Alicia's name in the phone book. Veronica visits Logan's bedroom and tells him about the pictures, but he seems unafraid. Veronica notices that Curly Moran did the stunts on an Aaron Echolls film. Beaver tells Mr. Casablancas that he hired a private investigator to find Kendall, but he immediately tells his staff to shred all papers and flies away in a helicopter before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gets there. With her newfound knowledge, Veronica tells Duncan that she believes that the bus crash was meant to kill her.  Cultural references  A variety of cultural references are made in the episode: *Veronica uses the phrase \\"Excellent,\\" referencing the catchphrase used by Mr. Burns in The Simpsons. *When Sheriff Lamb questions Veronica about her relationship with David \\"Curly\\" Moran, she jokes that they met while he was a roadie for Whitesnake and she was a backup singer for Boyz II Men. *Veronica references the Infinite monkey theorem. *Keith woos Alicia by paraphrasing \\"Fog\\". *Keith mentions Kenny G. *Veronica compares Kendall to a Barbie doll. *Veronica jokes that Kendall has broken her Atkins diet. *Veronica's place of work is called \\"Java the Hut,\\" a play on the character Jabba the Hutt. *The episode frequently references Pride and Prejudice. *The business teacher references Warren Buffett. *Logan sarcastically refers to Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and the film of the same name. *Logan's inspirational quote of the day is from William Makepeace Thackeray. *Logan uses a catchphrase from I Love Lucy.  Music  The following music can be heard in the episode: *\\"I Turn My Camera On\\" by Spoon *\\"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\\" by Stephen Foster *\\"Love Hurts\\" by The Everly Brothers (Nazareth version) *\\"Smoke It\\" by The Dandy Warhols  Arc significance  *In Chicago, a man sees Alicia and calls her \\"Cher\\" and \\"Cheri.\\" *The body on the beach was David \\"Curly\\" Moran. He was a mechanic who had been the stunt coordinator on Aaron Echolls' first big movie, The Long Haul. *Beaver gets pictures of Logan and Kendall together and shows them to his dad, Dick Casablancas Sr., but his dad isn't concerned with it. Instead, Big Dick tells his employees to shred everything and leaves in a helicopter before the SEC arrive.  Production  The Dandy Warhols lead singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor (pictured) made a cameo appearance in \\"Cheatty Cheatty Bang Bang\\". The episode was written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and directed by John Kretchmer, marking Klemmer's fifth directing credit, Enbom's fourth writing credit, and Kretchmer's fifth directing credit. The episode's title is a tongue-in-cheek reference to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The episode also features a cameo appearance by The Dandy Warhols lead singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor, who sung a karaoke song in the episode. The singer also sings the series' theme song.

It allows a group of users (or peers) that are collaborating to share a given file to do so more swiftly and efficiently. In the original design of the BitTorrent file sharing protocol, peers (users) in a file sharing group (known as a \\"swarm\\") relied upon a central computer server called a tracker to find each other and to maintain the swarm. PEX greatly reduces the reliance of peers on a tracker by allowing each peer to directly update others in the swarm as to which peers are currently in the swarm. By reducing dependency on a centralized tracker, PEX increases the speed, efficiency, and robustness of the BitTorrent protocol. Description Users wishing to obtain a copy of a file typically first download a torrent file that describes the file(s) to be shared, as well as the URLs of one or more central computers called trackers that maintain a list of peers currently sharing the file(s) described in the .torrent file. In the original BitTorrent design, peers then depended on this central tracker to find each other and maintain the swarm. Later development of distributed hash tables (DHTs) meant that partial lists of peers could be held by other computers in the swarm and the load on the central tracker computer could be reduced. PEX allows peers in a swarm to exchange information about the swarm directly without asking (polling) a tracker computer or a DHT. By doing so, PEX leverages the knowledge of peers that a user is connected to by asking them for the addresses of peers that they are connected to. This is faster and more efficient than relying solely on one tracker and reduces the processing load on the tracker. It also keep swarms together when the tracker is down.http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Peer_Exchange Peer exchange cannot be used on its own to introduce a new peer to a swarm. To make initial contact with a swarm, each peer must either connect to a tracker using a \\".torrent\\" file, or else use a router computer called a bootstrap node to find a distributed hash table (DHT) which describes a swarm's list of peers. For most BitTorrent users, DHT and PEX will start to work automatically after the user launches a BitTorrent client and opens a .torrent file. A notable exception is \\"private torrents\\" which are not freely available; these will commonly disable DHT. =Peer Exchange Conventions= Extensions to BitTorrent such as PEX are typically implemented using one of two common extension protocols, AZMP or LTEP. Both types of peer exchange send messages containing a group of peers to be added to the swarm and a group of peers to be removed. It was agreed between the Azureus and ŒºTorrent developers that any clients which implement either of the mechanisms above try to obey the following limits when sending PEX messages: * There should be no more than 50 added peers and 50 removed peers sent in any given PEX message. * A peer exchange message should not be sent more frequently than once a minute. Some clients may choose to enforce these limits and drop connections from clients that ignore them. =DHT= To create a PEX protocol providing a uniformly-distributed peer selection, one could form a small distributed hash table (DHT) local to a torrent. For each desired new peer one would look up a (uniformly) random key, and use the node responsible for the key as a new peer. This is conceptually simple but would require quite some overhead. For \\"trackerless\\" torrents, it is not clear if PEX provides any value since the mainline DHT can distribute load as necessary. Each DHT node acting as a tracker may store only a subset of the peers, but these are maximal subsets constrained only by DHT node load rather than by a single peer's view. Private torrents commonly disable the DHT, and for this case, PEX might be useful provided the peer obtains enough peers from the tracker. Versions There are three incompatible PEX implementations (making distinct \\"networks\\" in swarm) * Vuze ‚Äì introduced in Azureus * BitComet ‚Äì proprietary ‚Äì introduced in BitComet * MainLine ‚Äì introduced in ŒºTorrent Clients supporting peer exchange Most BitTorrent clients use PEX to gather peers in addition to trackers and DHT. With the 3.0.5.0 release of Vuze, all major BitTorrent clients now have compatible peer exchange. Each of these clients implement some version of peer exchange: *Ares Galaxy *aria2, ŒºTorrent PEX support *Vuze, formerly Azureus, and clients based on it (The Vuze PEX is only compatible with the Transmission client. PEX with other clients has been implemented into Vuze and into Azureus from 3.0.4.3 onwards) *BitComet supports PEX using a proprietary protocol in its older versions. Starting with v.1.19 it also added support for the ŒºTorrent/Mainline implementation of PEX, based on the Extension Protocol. *Bitflu *BitTorrentBitTorrent User Manual - Appendix A: The BitTorrent Interface - Miscellaneous - Torrent Properties - General - Other Settings - Peer Exchange *KTorrent has implemented full ŒºTorrent PEX support as of 2.1 RC1 *libtorrent and clients based on it (Deluge, qBittorrent, MooPolice) compatible with ŒºTorrent *Tixati *ŒºTorrent *Opera 9.5, ŒºTorrent PEX support *qBittorrent, ŒºTorrent PEX support *rTorrent *Transmission (compatible with both the ŒºTorrent and Vuze implementations) *XTorrent being based on Transmission source code, equally fully supports the Vuze and ŒºTorrent implementations as of version 1.0 (v40)Xtorrent P2P (for Mac OS X) References External links *Description on the official Azureus wiki Category:BitTorrent ","title":"Peer exchange"},{"id":"3930805","text":"Disodium glutamate, abbreviated DSG, (Na2C5H7NO4) is a sodium salt of glutamic acid.

In the , Kandanga had a population of 665 people.  Geography  The town is located on the Mary Valley Road (State Route 51) north of the state capital, Brisbane and south west of Gympie, on the banks of Kandanga Creek, a tributary of the Mary River. This river forms the eastern and north-eastern boundaries of the locality. Kandanga is one of a chain of towns in the Mary Valley also including Imbil, Amamoor and Dagun. In 2006 the Beattie state government announced plans to construct a new dam at Traveston Crossing on the upper Mary River. The proposed dam, designed to provide water to the growing Sunshine Coast, was to have flooded fertile farmland, including Kandanga. However, the dam did not proceed on environmental grounds, but not before much of the land required was bought up and the original owners moved on.Queensland Government Ministerial Statement 5 July 2006 - Retrieved 31 October 2006 Kandanga is well known for its prime farmland, although because of the proposed dam many farmers had to walk out on their farms. A reconstruction plan was implemented following the Traveston Crossing Dam debacle, with farm land subdivided and offered to new owners who have introduced new crops to the Mary Valley. Kandanga suffered a further blow when its popular hotel burnt down. Just like the valley itself, it is being rebuilt with the determination of locals.

Dworkin is often said to argue that \\"all heterosexual sex is rape\\", based on the line from the book that says \\"violation is a synonym for intercourse.\\" However, Dworkin has denied this interpretation, stating, \\"What I think is that sex must not put women in a subordinate position. It must be reciprocal and not an act of aggression from a man looking only to satisfy himself. That's my point.\\"  Thesis  In Intercourse, Dworkin extended her earlier analysis of pornography to a discussion of heterosexual intercourse itself. In works such as Woman Hating and Pornography: Men Possessing Women, Dworkin had argued that pornography and erotic literature in patriarchal societies consistently eroticized women's sexual subordination to men, and often overt acts of exploitation or violence. In Intercourse, she went on to argue that that sort of sexual subordination was central to men's and women's experiences of sexual intercourse in a male supremacist society, and reinforced throughout mainstream culture, including not only pornography but also in classic works of male-centric literature. Extensively discussing works such as The Kreutzer Sonata, Madame Bovary, and Dracula (and citing from religious texts, legal commentary, and pornography), Dworkin argued that the depictions of intercourse in mainstream art and culture consistently emphasized heterosexual intercourse as the only or the most genuine form of \\"real\\" sex; that they portrayed intercourse in violent or invasive terms; that they portrayed the violence or invasiveness as central to its eroticism; and that they often united it with male contempt for, revulsion towards, or even murder of, the \\"carnal\\" woman. She argued that this kind of depiction enforced a male-centric and coercive view of sexuality, and that, when the cultural attitudes combine with the material conditions of women's lives in a sexist society, the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's subordination of women, experienced as a form of \\"occupation\\" that is nevertheless expected to be pleasurable for women and to define their very status as women. In the 1998 book, Without Apology: Andrea Dworkin's Art and Politics, in chapter 6, titled \\"Intercourse: An Institution of Male Power,\\" author Cindy Jenefsky states: \\"As in her analysis of pornography's sexual subordination, the key to understanding Dworkin's analysis of sexual intercourse rests on recognizing how she integrates the individual act of sexual intercourse within its larger social context. She produces a materialist analysis that examines sexual intercourse as an institutionalized practice.\\" (emphasis hers)  Controversy  Such descriptions are often cited by Dworkin's critics, claiming that Intercourse argued that \\"All heterosexual intercourse is rape.\\" That statement, however, is not directly made in the book, and her comparisons of intercourse to \\"occupation,\\" \\"possession,\\" \\"collaboration,\\" etc. are made in the context of discussions of the way in which intercourse is depicted \\"the discourse of male truth--literature, science, philosophy, pornography\\", and the enforcement of those terms through men's social power over women. Dworkin rejected the interpretation that \\"All heterosexual intercourse is rape\\" as a grave misunderstanding of her work. She also addressed this directly in an interview with editor, critic, and writer, Michael Moorcock for the New Statesman & Society, an eight-year incarnation of the New Statesman. From the interview, Dworkin responds to the claim: \\"In Intercourse I decided to approach the subject as a social practice, material reality. This may be my history, but I think the social explanation of the 'all sex is rape' slander is different and probably simple. Most men and a good number of women experience sexual pleasure in inequality. Since the paradigm for sex has been one of conquest, possession, and violation, I think many men believe they need an unfair advantage, which at its extreme would be called rape. I don't think they need it. I think both intercourse and sexual pleasure can and will survive equality.\\" Journalist Cathy Young wrote that she found Dworkin's explanation hard to square with what Young described as Dworkin's frequent willingness to criticize ordinary heterosexual practices as violent or coercive. Young wrote, \\"whatever her defenders say, Dworkin was anti-sex.\\" Following Dworkin's death in 2005, Katherine Viner interviewed art critic, writer, and painter, John Berger. This piece for The Guardian was titled \\"'She Never Hated Men'\\": > \\"John Berger once called Dworkin 'the most misrepresented writer in the > western world'. She has always been seen as the woman who said that all men > are rapists, and that all sex is rape. In fact, she said neither of these > things. Here's what she told me in 1997: 'If you believe that what people > call normal sex is an act of dominance, where a man desires a woman so much > that he will use force against her to express his desire, if you believe > that's romantic, that's the truth about sexual desire, then if someone > denounces force in sex it sounds like they're denouncing sex.

Written by Dayna Lynne North and directed by Jason Bloom, the episode premiered on UPN on October 19, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica helps a woman named Julie (Laura Bell Bundy) find out whether her boyfriend, Collin (Michael E. Rodgers), is cheating on her. Meanwhile, Nathan Woods (Cress Williams) shows up in Neptune and gives some new information regarding Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel).  Synopsis  Veronica calls the hospital to see whether or not Meg Manning (Alona Tal) has been removed from the ICU. Afterwards, a woman, Julie, comes in and says that she needs Keith (Enrico Colantoni) to investigate whether or not her boyfriend, Collin, is cheating. As she is leaving, Keith comes in and tells Veronica that he can't take on another case due to his Sheriff run. At his request, Veronica pretends to call Julie and cancel the case, although she decides to take it on herself, hoping to get a few thousand dollars. Veronica contacts Julie, who says that she's been noticing signs of cheating. Jackie invites Wallace to help her with trigonometry. The police officer from the previous episode, Nathan Woods, pulls up to Alicia's house. Alicia tells Keith about her problem with Nathan, and he agrees to help. Wallace and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) are being very flirtatious in school. Nathan tries to break into Alicia's house until Keith shows up. Keith thinks that he is a criminal named Carl Morgan, although he's not. Veronica attempts to visit Meg in the hospital and finds Duncan (Teddy Dunn) waiting there. Meg's parents angrily tell both of them to leave. Collin goes into a woman's house, and Veronica takes pictures and sends them to Julie. After investigating further, Veronica finds out that Collin is actually just seeing a rabbi and tackles Julie before she can barge into the house. Julie requests more surveillance on Collin for an extra $1,000. Keith comes into Sheriff Lamb's office and tells him about \\"Carl Morgan.\\" Veronica notices that an earring that she previously saw in an evidence bag surrounding the death of David \\"Curly\\" Moran belonged to Weevil. Weevil got an anonymous call saying that Curly was behind the bus crash. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) goes to help Veronica, leaving Jackie by herself, leading Jackie to feel jealous. Veronica, disguised as a sorority girl, investigates Collin by going to his house, pretending to have a flat tire, and attempting to seduce him while Wallace films. Veronica tells Wallace about the guy she saw with Jackie the other night. Veronica, pretending to need a computer, goes into Collin's house. Veronica tries to seduce him once again, but he denies her advances. On the computer, Veronica copies all of Collin's files onto a hard drive, and Collin tells her that this is not his house‚Äîhe is house-sitting for Nicolas Cage. Veronica sends Wallace to distract Collin while the files download. Veronica and Duncan share a romantic dinner, but it is ruined when Veronica brings up Meg. Later, Veronica looks at Collin's files and finds out that he has been researching Julie's wealthy family. That night, Meg's sister, Lizzie (Anastasia Baranova), shows up at Duncan's door. Lizzie tells Duncan to remove any private information from Meg's computer before her parents see it. Lizzie finds Veronica, and Veronica decides to call Mac (Tina Majorino) for help. Mac successfully stores all Meg's information onto a hard drive. Julie calls Veronica, and she tells her that he was being completely faithful. Veronica almost looks at Meg's files before thinking better of it. Sheriff Lamb calls Keith and tells him that \\"Carl Morgan\\" is actually a police officer named Nathan Woods. Veronica tells Julie that his supposed house and car are not actually his and that he was researching her family. Keith walks in and scolds Veronica for taking on the case. Julie informs Veronica that she broke up with Collin. Veronica sends Julie a package saying that it was a mistake for them to break up with each other. Keith apologizes to Veronica. Veronica investigates Weevil's story and eventually connects it to Logan (Jason Dohring). Logan denies the accusations but says that he threw a party on the night of the bus crash and that Weevil crashed it. Keith digs further into Alicia's backstory, and Nathan tells Wallace that he is Wallace's father.

This ballet was created in 1927 as the first Soviet ballet with a modern revolutionary theme. Possibly the most famous dance from this ballet is the Sailors Dance, sometimes referred to as the \\"Russian Sailors Dance\\" (although it is described as \\"Dance of the Sailors from the Soviet Ship\\" in the score and libretto). It is this musical selection for which Gli√®re is perhaps best known. There have been four main versions of The Red Poppy.

The orchestra was led by Yuri Fayer. The ballet's 100th performance in Moscow occurred on 23 December 1928. This production was staged in 1928 and 1930 in Sverdlovsk, and in 1928, 1949, and 1958 in Saratov. The Leningradsky Theatre of opera and ballet staged the ballet in 1929 in Leningrad, adding several dances to the production. The original version was performed in 1941 and 1950 in Gorki; in 1946 in Baku by the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre; and in 1949 and 1958 by the Kirov Ballet.

Ships carrying sailors from many lands, including the Soviet Union, are docked in a Chinese seaport. The Captain of the Soviet Ship notices a group of half-starved, overworked coolies being brutally driven to work even harder by their cruel harbormaster. One night while dancing for the sailors aboard the ship, the beautiful Ta√Ø-Choa (Pinyin: Taohua) notices the Soviet Captain trying to rescue the poor Coolies from the Harbormaster. Impressed by the captain's act of kindness she gives him a red poppy as a symbol of her love. When Ta√Ø-Choa's fianc√©, the adventurer Li-Chan- Fou learns of this, he is jealous and orders her to kill the captain. She refuses, and is later killed when a riot breaks out on the dock ‚Äî thus sacrificing her life for the captain. As she dies, she gives another red poppy flower to a young Chinese girl as a sign of love and freedom.

The Kingdom, having a strong trade system between Korea, Japan, China and other Southeast Asian countries in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, utilised fabric decoration techniques originating in these countries to create an independent style of dyework featuring nature-inspired designs reflecting the Islands. The abundant flora and fauna gave the resulting fabric a strong natural influence, resulting in the development of the designs typically seen in today. In 1609, Japan invaded the Kingdom, and trade with foreign countries was prohibited.

The goods produced for the Japanese by the people were also judged by an exacting and high standard set by the royal authorities, resulting in the exported goods reaching a high level of craftsmanship that generated a strong desire for crafts and goods.

There are ten labour-intensive steps to producing : # Stencil Cutting #: Mulberry papers are coated with persimmon tannin and sealed together to form a firm sheet. A design is drawn onto the paper directly or traced from another source. The details are cut with a small blade and afterwards it is coated again to keep it from bending. # Stencil Resist Painting #: A special rice-paste made from boiled rice, rice bran and water is scraped across the top of the stencil on the cloth. # Freehand Resist Painting #: If a large area is needed to be painted, a freehand technique is used to apply the rice-paste resist onto the fabric. The paste is put into a bag and squeezed onto the fabric. # Painting #: Prepared paints are painted onto the fabric starting from lighter to darker colours. One design can use from 9 to 18 different colours. # Re-Painting #: To achieve a more vibrant colour the paints are added once more and this time rubbed into the cloth with a stiff brush made out of human hair. # Details #: Details around the edges of each object are added to emphasise the image. Next the fabric is steamed so the colours will set into the fabric and then it is washed. # Background Resist #: To paint the background a separate colour, the rice-paste resist is now placed on all the previously painted areas. # Background Painting #: The entire background of the fabric is painted with a wide brush or dipped in a dye bath. # Colour Setting #: The fabric is set in a steamer for an hour to let the colours set. # Washing #: The fabric is washed and dried.

Zanazziite also shares many physical properties with roscherite. Geologic occurrence The roscherite analog zanazziite was found in Lavar da Ilha deposits in Minas Gerais, Brazil.Rastsvetaeva, R.K., Barinova, A.V., Chukanov, N.V., and Pietraszko, A.(2004) Crystal structure of a magnesium-rich triclinic analogue of greifensteinite. Dok. Akad. Nauk. Russia., 398, 492‚Äì497. Zanazziite grows usually along the surface of quartz minerals. It occurs in pegmatite in beds of the Jequitinhonha river valley. The pegmatite consists of a wall zone rich in feldspar and muscovite, and a quartz core. The core margin has small pockets and crevices which contain quartz crystals and a number of phosphate minerals (on which the roscherite minerals accumulate). This is special to quartz and phosphate due to the rich locality of Minas Gerais. Minas Gerais contains the world's most diverse concentration of complex granitic pegmatites. This region is responsible for the production of gem beryl, chrysoberyl, topaz, tourmaline, and kunzite.Atencio, D., Coutinho, J.M.V., and Menezes Filho, L.A.D.(2005) Roscherite group minerals from Brazil.

A friend of Andrew Carnegie, with whom he was often compared, at the end of the 19th century he controlled an effective monopoly on steel and iron resources within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and had by the 1890s acquired one of the largest fortunes in the world. He was also the father of concert pianist Paul Wittgenstein, philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and of philanthropist Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein.  Family background and origins  The eleven sons and daughters of Hermann and Fanny Wittgenstein, Karl second from left 186x186pxThe grandfather of Karl Wittgenstein was an estate manager named Moses Meyer, who came from Laasphe in the former Wittgenstein kreis (county).See Schloss Wittgenstein. Various sources spell Meier's name Maier and Meyer. He moved to Korbach before 1802, where he was a merchant. Around 1808, Moses Meyer named himself Wittgenstein, after his birthplace Siegen-Wittgenstein and thereafter was known as Moses Meyer Wittgenstein.Bartley, pp. 199‚Äì200. At first, Wittgenstein's business became the biggest and most successful enterprise in the city of Korbach, but also shortly thereafter began to decline. He had a son, Hermann Christian (b. September 12, 1802 in Korbach; d. 1878 in Vienna) who moved the business to Gohlis at the end of the 1830s. From there, the family continued to prosper financially. In 1938, to escape Nazi racial laws and to be reclassified as half Jewish, his descendants claimed that Herman Christian was not the son of Moses Meyer Wittgenstein but rather the illegitimate offspring of a prince of the House of Waldeck. After Hermann Christian converted to Protestantism, he married Fanny Figdor in 1839. She came from one of the most important business families in Vienna.Monk, pp. 4‚Äì5. Karl, born in 1847, was the sixth of eleven children of Hermann and Fanny. Three years later the family moved to V√∂sendorf (M√∂dling district) in Austria, where his four younger siblings were born. One of his brothers, Paul Wittgenstein (1842‚Äì1928), was the father of Dr Karl Paul Wittgenstein who married Hilde K√∂chert, daughter of renowned Viennese jeweller Heinrich K√∂chert: their son Paul Wittgenstein (1907‚Äì1979) was \\"Wittgenstein's Nephew\\", the central character of a book by his friend Thomas Bernhard.  Biography  = Early life and career = Side portrait of Karl Wittgenstein, 1910Karl had resisted in his youth the classical teaching methods which were imposed upon the children of Viennese bourgeoisie. Karl ran away from home at the age of eleven and at the age of seventeen had been expelled from school for an essay he wrote in which he denied the \\"immortality of the soul\\". His father, Hermann, continued in his desire to educate his son by hiring private tutors to ensure Karl passed his exams but Karl, again, ran away, staying in Vienna for a couple of months before fleeing to New York with little money and his violin. Monk writes, \\"He managed nevertheless to maintain himself for over two years by working as a waiter, a saloon musician, a bartender and a teacher (of the violin, the horn, mathematics, German and anything else he could think of).\\" He returned to Vienna in 1867 and pursued his interest in engineering. After a year of education and an apprenticeship, Karl took the job of a draughtsman on the construction of a rolling mill in Bohemia, a post offered to him by Paul Kupelwieser, the brother of his brother-in-law. Karl rapidly rose through the company eventually taking over Kupelweiser as Managing Director within the space of five years. By the end of the nineteenth century, Karl Wittgenstein had become one of the wealthiest men in Europe and a leading figure in the iron and steel industry. In 1898, he retired from his posts and transferred much of his wealth to foreign equities, principally in the United States which protected the Wittgenstein family from the inflation in Vienna after the first world war. = Children = Karl married Leopoldine Maria Josefa Kalmus, known among friends as Poldi, in 1873. She was the only spouse of any of Hermann Christian's children who had a Jewish background; her father was a Bohemian Jew and her mother was Austrian-Slovene Catholic.Ranjit Chatterjee, Wittgenstein and Judaism: A Triumph of Concealment, 2005, p. 178.A Nervous Splendor : The New YorkerB.

Previously they were known under the name Secotan.Karen Ordahl Kupperman, Roanoke: The Abandoned Colony They were a group who had migrated south from the Algonquian peoples of the Powhatan Confederacy in present-day Virginia. They are now extinct as a separate tribe. They spoke an Algonquian language and historically occupied a coastal area of northeastern North Carolina. History Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived along the waterways throughout the South. Over time they gave rise to the historical tribes known at the time of European encounter. Other peoples migrated into the area as well. The early 20th-century ethnographer Frank Speck believed that the historical Machapunga and other Algonquian tribes in North Carolina had probably been earlier connected to the larger population based in coastal Virginia. He believed the tribes in North Carolina were part of an early and large Algonquian migration in a southerly direction in historical times. He noted the presence of Algonquian-speaking tribes on the Northeast coast and in eastern and central Canada.Frank G. Speck, \\"REMNANTS OF THE MACHAPUNGA INDIANS OF NORTH CAROLINA\\", American Anthropologist 18 (1916): pp. 271‚Äì276, Carolina Algonkian Project, Rootsweb, permission by American Anthropologist, accessed Apr 22, 2010 One of a number of small, Algonquian-speaking tribes in coastal North Carolina, the Machapunga (meaning \\"bad dust\\" or \\"much dirt,\\" which sounds like an exonym given by a competing tribe, rather than an autonym they would identify with) lived in the Pungo River area. Many lived in a village called Mattamuskeet on the shore of Lake Mattamuskeet in present-day Hyde County. In 1701 English colonists described the tribe as containing roughly 100 members. In 1711 they participated in the Tuscarora War against the colonists. By 1715, the remaining members of the Coree, who lived to the south, had been merged into the Machapunga and lived together with them in Mattamuskeet. John Squires was the Chief of the Tribe. His mother was Ethelia, married to an Englishman named Jonathan Squires. Ethelia's father was the Chief of the Nanticoke in Dorchester County Maryland, but her mother was Machapunga, thus having made John the Chief of the Machapunga. John owned and operated a Trading Post, with another Indian named Long Tom off of the Old Indian Trail on the Chesapeake Bay. They were summoned many times by the English Colonists to interpret for them, and helped settle many indifferences between the Colonists and the Indians. John's parents, Jonathan and Ethelia continued to reside on the Nanticoke Nation Land in Dorchester County Maryland. John Squires was one of the most well documented Indians of the Machapunga Tribe. He has many Squire descendants of both Nanticoke, and Machapunga blood. Because of colonial concerns about slavery and racial control, officials organized society in a binary way, classifying people as white and colored (the latter category essentially covered all non-whites). Living conditions and arrangements were often more fluid than the record keeping. When the United States starting keeping census records in 1790, it had no category for Indian and did not establish a separate one until late in the 19th century. Those not living on reservations were included among \\"Free blacks,\\" \\"Other free,\\" or \\"Mulatto\\", which were different categories used to classify free non-whites. Before that time, the surviving Native Americans in the states were generally classified as mulatto, free people of color or black, if of identifiably African descent. In Maryland, Catholic churches kept parish records that continued to indicate families and individuals who identified as Indian, regardless of whether they were of mixed race, but the states did not. Descendants of the Machapunga tribe reside in the Inner Banks of eastern North Carolina. Some of the Machapunga descendants traditionally had the surnames Squires, Mackey, sometimes spelled Mackee, Mackie or Macky. Other known surnames among the people were Barber, Chance, Clark, Collins, Elks, Morris, and King. Survivors intermarried with other ethnic peoples, and their children and grandchildren carry all their ancestry. Ethnographers and anthropologists such as Speck studied the peoples of the Southeast in the early 20th century, trying to determine if Native American cultures had survived. Speck found little evidence of the Machapunga and other Algonquian cultures. He did note that people had continued fishing with their traditional nets, and the women wove baskets according to traditional skills and styles.

Jim Lucy had been a coach and Administrator with Takapuna AFL in Auckland, but wanted to grow the game in the Waikato where he was based. So in 2004 he created an article in the Waikato Times newspaper. A number of sportsman were interested in the sport and came along to see what it was all about. That first year saw 15-20 men meet at Eliott Park to learn the skills and game of Australian Rules Football. In 2005 the numbers grew until around 30 men met each Sunday. With numbers too small to form a competition, players learnt the skills and played \\"scratch\\" matches amongst themselves using a rugby field. Ambitiously they joined the AFLNZ in a weekend tournament to compete against the 3 established provinces; Auckland, Wellington and Canterbury. The NPC has been held around the Labour Weekend period but in a current restructuring will be moving to early December in 2013. The Waikato representative side team took on the name, Waikato Thunder AFL (WTAFL) to distinguish themselves from Wellington AFL (WAFL) who had formed years prior. Since entering their inaugural National Provincial Competition the Waikato Thunder have continued to grow. They now have 2 full-time teams Hamilton Mavericks, Hamilton Tuis) that compete each week and are on their way to forming a permanent 3rd Hamilton based team (Redbacks). The WTAFL season runs from mid August through to late October/early November. Games are currently held at Derek Heather Park in Western Heights, Hamilton on Saturdays at 1pm. Finding a permanent location for the sport is difficult due to the size of the field required - and oval 150m long by 110m wide. A permanent base is being sought within the Hamilton area.

Briscoe's father was the proprietor of Lawlor Briscoe, a furniture factory on Ormond Quay which made, refurbished, imported, exported and sold furniture, trading all over Ireland and abroad. Abraham Briscoe ‚Äì known universally as Pappa ‚Äì had arrived in Ireland penniless, and made his fortune through hard work and his charm as a salesman, first as a brush salesman, then of imported tea. He married Ida Yoedicke, daughter of a successful family in Frankfurt, who had left Lithuania and the racist Russian laws limiting Jews from success and a decent life, to live in the more liberal Germany.For the Life of Me by Robert Briscoe Robert and his wife Lily had seven children; only two of their sons, Ben and Joe, remained in Dublin. One of Robert Briscoe's daughters Miriam converted to the Catholic faith and became a Carmelite nun.Briscoe's daughter now a nun Ben followed his father into politics, while Joe joined the army at age of 15 (claiming to be 18) in 1945; he retired in 1993 with the rank of commandant.  War of Independence  Briscoe was active in the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Sinn F√©in during the Irish War of Independence and accompanied √âamon de Valera to America. He spoke for the Sinn F√©in cause at public meetings there and was adamant that being a \\"Hebrew\\" did not lessen his Irishness. Briscoe was sent by Michael Collins to Germany in 1919 to be the chief agent for procuring arms for the IRA. Eamon Martin, former Chief of Staff of Fianna √âireann, was best man at Briscoe's wedding. They had been close friends during the Irish War of Independence.  Irish Civil War  In June 1922 during the Irish Civil War, Briscoe was involved in an incident with fellow anti-treaty IRA members who attacked pro-treaty politician Darrell Figgis at his home. They entered the house and assaulted Darrell Figgis, cutting off his well-prized beard in the process. This traumatised Figgis' wife Millie, who had been under the impression Briscoe and his fellow assistants had been coming to kill Darrell.https://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-short-and-tragic-life-of-an- irish-dandy-26823069.html In November 1924 Millie would commit suicide, expressing in a suicide note that she was suffering from depression as a result of the 1922 attack.Irish Times, 20 November 1924\\"Shot in a Taxi-Cab\\", Freeman's Journal, 20 November 1924, p. 5; Darrell Figgis himself committed suicide in 1926. In his biography, he recalls an incident of being recognised by a pro-Treaty opponent during the Civil War. Briscoe merely turned and walked away, confident that his enemy would not shoot him in the back.  D√°il √âireann  Elected to the D√°il in the newly independent Ireland, Briscoe worked with Patrick Little to bring through a law limiting the interest that could be charged by moneylenders ‚Äì and also, as he wrote, \\"made it illegal for a married woman to borrow money without the knowledge and consent of her husband, for these foolish ones are always the easiest prey of the moneylenders\\".The Time of My Life by Robert Briscoe  Jewish refugees and Irish neutrality  During the Second World War, Briscoe, at this time a member of D√°il √âireann, came under close scrutiny from the Irish security services. His support for Zionism and his lobbying on behalf of refugees was considered potentially damaging to the interests of the state by officials from the Department of Justice. Briscoe was an admirer and friend of Ze'ev Jabotinsky and his campaign to liberate the Jews.Robert Briscoe Between 1939 and 1940, Robert Briscoe along with John Henry Patterson, a former commander of both the Zion Mule Corps and later the 38th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers (also known as the Jewish Legion),Jewish Virtual Library, The Zion Muleteers of Gallipoli were involved in fund raising for the Irgun in the USA.Zionism and Israel ‚Äì Biographies, John Henry Patterson Jabotinsky while head of Irgun visited Dublin to receive training in guerrilla warfare tactics against the British under the instruction of Briscoe.Dreams of Zion, Tablet Magazine During the period Briscoe described himself as the \\"Chair of Subversive Activity against England\\".Free Stater, A story of Dev, Bob Briscoe and Israel/Palestine He wished for Ireland to give asylum to Jews fleeing Nazi Germany, but did so discreetly in order not to be accused of compromising the neutrality policy of the Fianna F√°il government.O'halpin, Eunan Defending Ireland: The Irish State and Its Enemies Since 1922 : 2000 pp220-222 Briscoe notably had a spat with Irish trade envoy to Germany Charles Bewley, who tried to thwart his effort of helping Jewish refugees gaining visas for Ireland during the war. After the Second World War Briscoe acted as a special advisor to Menachem Begin in the transformation of Irgun from a paramilitary group to a parliamentary political movement in the form of Herut in the new Israeli state; the party later became Likud. Briscoe had already been a key figure in the formation in his own Fianna F√°il party out of the Anti-treaty IRA post Irish independence but not before a bitter Civil War, he prompted Menachem Begin to make the transition immediately after the Altalena Affair in order to avoid a similar civil conflict.Dictionary of Irish Biography  Political career  He served in D√°il √âireann for 38 years and was elected 12 times in the Dublin South and from 1948, Dublin South-West constituencies ‚Äì from the 6th D√°il to the 17th D√°il. He retired at the 1965 election being succeeded by his son, Ben who served for a further 37 years. In 1956, Briscoe became the first Jewish Lord Mayor of Dublin,Keogh, Dermot Jews in Twentieth-century Ireland p7. although he was not the first Jewish Mayor in Ireland. That title belongs to William Annyas, who was elected Mayor of Youghal, County Cork in 1555. Briscoe was Dublin's first Jewish Lord Mayor, although Lewis Wormser Harris was elected Lord Mayor in 1876, but died before assuming office.Benson p12 Briscoe served a one-year term and was re-elected in 1961. After learning of a Jewish Lord Mayor from Dublin, Yogi Berra allegedly said, \\"Only in America!\\" His son Ben Briscoe was also a Fianna F√°il TD, and he too served as Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1988‚Äì1989. His memoir, For the Life of Me, was published in 1958. The Emerald Isle Immigration Center in New York has devoted a special award in his name called the Robert Briscoe award. The group celebrates the close relationship between Jewish and Irish communities in New York and honours Jewish New Yorkers who have helped support immigration in the United States. The 2016 Award Winners were Queens Borough President Melinda Katz and Deborah King, director of SEIU 1199's training and employment funds. Previous winners have included former New York Mayor Ed Koch, former Gov. Eliot Spitzer and U.S. Senator Charles Schumer.

Plua is a port of the programming language Lua 5.0.3, along with a small IDE, for the Palm Computing platform. Lua is a programming language designed at TeCGraf, the Computer Graphics Technology Group of PUC-Rio, Brazil. Plua includes some extensions to Lua to better support the Palm platform. Development has ceased on Plua, and the latest stable version of Plua 2.0 can only be downloaded from a discussion board.Yahoo Groups: plua The prior version, Plua 1.1, is a port of Lua 4.0. The extensions differ somewhat between versions. The new version is thus sometimes called Plua 2 to avoid confusion.  Language resources  Plua has some special functions, or extensions, to support the Palm platform, including: * Graphical user interface (GUI) components, defined by position: buttons, checkboxes, etc. * Direct plotting of graphics based on vertex information: lines, circles, etc. * Can work with streams, databases or computer files on memory cards. * Supports communication via infrared and serial ports. * Rudimentary sprite engine.  Sample code, Plua 1  The compiler and interpreter is approximately 150 KB, and the compiled helloworldApp.prc shown below is approximately 2 KB. The classic hello world program (in the old version) can be written as follows: \\\\-- HelloWorld.lua ptitle(\\"Hello World\\") print (\\"Hello, world!\\") pevent() This text will be saved as a normal memo in the Palm, and executed by tapping the \\"Run\\" button in the IDE. Alternatively, the program can be compiled into a PRC (Palm OS Program File, which is executable on any Palm Platform, provided that the runtime program is present) from the same IDE. A breakdown of the program: * Line #1: *: The double dashes define the above line as a comment. All Plua memo files must be defined as such before it can be run or compiled in Plua. * Line #2: *: Defines the title at the top of the page. * Line #3: *: Prints the message \\"Hello, world!\\" onscreen under the title bar. * Line #4: *: The above command pauses the execution of the programs and waits for any interaction from the user. These include button taps, character input, or the push of a hard button.  Sample code, Plua 2  The equivalent program with the new extensions can be written as follows: \\\\-- HelloWorld.lua gui.title 'Hello world' print 'Hello world!' gui.event(ioPending) A breakdown of the program: The first line comment is the same as before, but the rest is a little different. * Line #2: *: The \`gui.title\` function defines the title at the top of the page. Parentheses are optional for a Lua function call with a single string argument (and also for a single table constructor). String literals may be either single-quoted or double-quoted. * Line #3: *: Prints the message \\"Hello, world!\\" onscreen under the title bar. If the optional parentheses and double quotes had been used (and they could have been), this line would be identical to the first version. * Line #4: *: The above command pauses the execution of the programs and waits for any interaction from the user.

Auckland Regional Council, press release. 27 February 2005.  Establishment and dissolution ARTA was established through the Local Government (Auckland) Amendment Act 2004 to take on the transport functions of the ARC along with new roles in transport planning and the prioritisation of transport funding. The establishment of ARTA was one of a set of changes announced on 12 December 2003 in the Investing for Growth transport package. The package also announced significant new funding measures including a $900m Crown contribution to Auckland transport over 10 years. Governance and funding of transport in Auckland was complex. The Royal Commission on Auckland Governance, set up in 2007, described then arrangements for transport in Auckland as: > A number of entities are involved in transport infrastructure in Auckland > (road, rail, public transport). Central government agencies involved in > planning and funding road and rail infrastructure include the Ministry of > Transport (transport policy), Land Transport New Zealand (funding and safety > management), Transit New Zealand (management and development of State > highways), and ONTRACK (management and development of the rail network). > Land Transport New Zealand and Transit will be replaced by the New Zealand > Transport Agency from 1 July 2008. Regional entities involved in transport > planning and public transport include the ARC, the Regional Land Transport > Committee, and the Auckland Regional Transport Authority. In addition local > councils own, build, and manage local roads (all roads that are not State > highways). On 1 November 2010, ARTA was superseded by Auckland Transport, a council- controlled organisation established to focus on delivering transport projects and services for the newly formed Auckland Council. Auckland Transport is responsible for local authority transport delivery functions inherited from the eight Auckland local authorities and ARTA including local roads and public transport.  Planning and funding  The Auckland Regional Land Transport StrategyAuckland Regional Land Transport Strategy (ARLTS), prepared by the Auckland Regional Council, set out a vision for Auckland‚Äôs transport system, and a 10-year framework for working towards this vision. ARTA was required to give effect to the ARLTS, both through its own actions and by setting priorities for the funding of land transport activities in the Region. ARTA achieved this by preparing the Auckland Transport Plan, and detailed implementation plans. Each year, ARTA prepared a Land Transport Programme setting out its recommendations for the funding of transport projects (excluding below-track rail infrastructure) in the Auckland region. Rail projects West Harbour KiwiRail undertook Project DARTProject Dart website (Developing Auckland's Rail Transport network) in association with ARTA (now Auckland Transport) to upgrade Auckland's rail network, signalling and train station platforms and buildings. The budget for the project was $600 million,Rail newsletter issue 29 (from the ARTA website, 2006) and included: * Double-tracking the Western line as far as Swanson * Redeveloping Newmarket station and the associated junction * Improving signalling on all routes to allow more frequent services * Building the Manukau Branch linking Manukau City Centre to the rail network * Reopening the Onehunga Branch line\\"Onehunga rail upgrade gets green light\\" . The Beehive. 13 March 2007.

He is known for having introduced Trotskyism to Sri Lanka, where he is a National Hero for his role in the Sri Lankan independence movement, and is known as 'the Father of Socialism' and as 'the Lion of Boralugoda'. He was a long-time member of parliament and had served as Minister of Industries and Fisheries in Dudley Senanayake National Government Cabinet of Ceylon, as well as Minister of Agriculture and food under S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike from 1956-1959. Early life and education Don Philip Rupasinghe Gunawardena, popularly known as Philip, was born on 11 January 1901, to a well-to-do family in Boralugoda, Avissawella, in Sri Lanka. He attended the local village school 'Boralugoga Siddhartha Primary School' for his primary education and went on to the Prince of Wales' College, Moratuwa. He attended Ananda College in Colombo and then University College, Colombo. He joined the Ceylon National Congress, but was drawn towards the activities of the Young Lanka League. At the age of 21, he moved to the United States where he studied Economics at the University of Illinois in Urbana- Champaign. He became radical minded and associated himself actively in the mass struggles which stormed the United States at the time. Two years later, he moved to the more radical University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he met Jayaprakash Narayan. The two were introduced by Avrom Landy to the Communist Party of the United States.Charles Wesley Ervin, Tomorrow is Ours:the Trotskyist Movement in India and Ceylon, 1935‚Äì48, Colombo: Social Scientists Association, 2006 Woodward has recorded that Gunawardena received his training in Marxism from Scott Nearing (1883‚Äì1983). He completed bachelor of science & master of science degrees in Agricultural Economics. In 1925, he joined Columbia University for post-graduate (doctoral) work. Early political career in the US and Europe In 1927 Gunawardena joined the League Against Imperialism in New York, where he worked with Jos√© Vasconcelos of Mexico, gaining a working knowledge of Spanish. In 1929 he went to London, where he participated in mass agitations and anti-colonial movements, excelling as a brilliant orator, trade unionist, and political columnist. Shri Jawaharlal Nehru and Krishna Menon of India, Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, Tan Malaka of Indonesia, and Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam of Mauritius were some of his contemporary colleagues who later played prominent roles in their motherlands. He joined the staff of the new Daily Worker and took over the Workers' Welfare League of India, an organisation founded by Shapurji Saklatvala. He later crossed the channel to Europe and worked alongside socialist groups in France and Germany. ='T-Group'= In the midst of the Comintern's 'Left Turn', Gunawardena surreptitiously joined the Marxian Propaganda League of FA Ridley and Hansraj Aggarwala, who opposed the Stalinists' characterisation of the Social Democratic parties as social fascist. When Ridley and Aggarwala broke with Leon Trotsky, Gunawardena sided with the latter. In 1932 he travelled on the Orient Express to meet Trotsky at Prinkipo, but was stopped at Sofia by police. At the British conference of the League Against Imperialism, in May 1932, Gunawardena introduced a counter-resolution on India against those moved by Harry Pollitt. As a result, the Communist Party of Great Britain expelled him for Trotskyism. = Lanka Sama Samaja Party = However, he had gathered around him several like-minded Sri Lankans, including NM Perera, Colvin R de Silva and Leslie Goonewardene. They came to be known as the 'T-Group' ‚Äì later forming the nucleus of the Trotskyist faction of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. Scotland Yard, under orders from the India Office, thwarted him from his aim of going to India to build a new Communist Party there. He set out for the continent, meeting members of the Left Opposition in Paris. He then hiked over the Pyrenees to Barcelona, where he had a rare opportunity to meet the Trotskyists of Spainwho were soon to undergo a civil war. Early political career in Sri Lanka and India Soon after his return to Sri Lanka in November 1932, he plunged into active politics organising rural peasants, plantation workers and urban workers. He pioneered the founding of Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) in 1935. In 1936 he was elected to the State Council from Avissawella electorate where he continued his struggle for the betterment of workers and peasants. When World War II broke out Philip Gunawardena was detained on Governor's orders. However, in July 1942 he escaped to India and participated in the independence struggle there. In 1943 he was rearrested and detained in Mumbai, and after many months deported to Sri Lanka to be imprisoned till the end of war. Post-war political career On his release in 1945 he again started political and trade union activities. At the General Election in 1947 he was elected to the first Parliament to represent Avissawella seat, but soon he was unseated on his involvement in the General Strike in 1947, and lost his civic rights for seven years. He led the Viplavakari Lanka Sama Samaja Party (VLSSP) since 1951 and as a constituent party formed the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP, Peoples' United Front) in 1956 under the leadership of Mr.SWRD Bandaranaike to form the first people's government in 1956 General Election. At that election, in 1956, he won the Avissawella seat with a large majority and served as a key member of the Cabinet of SWRD Bandaranaike as the Minister of Agriculture, Food, & Co- operatives. He is remembered as the architect of the Paddy Lands Bills which brought relief to the tenant cultivator and spearheaded the Port & Bus nationalisation, introduction of Multipurpose Co-operatives movement and establishing of the People's Bank, those brought tremendous change to society in Sri Lanka. In 1965, having won Avissawella from the MEP, Philip Gunawardena served in the National Government led by Dudley Senanayake, 1965‚Äì1970, as the Cabinet Minister of Industries and Fisheries. He established the Industrial Development Board, strengthened & expanded state industrial corporations and national private sector industries, and planned the development of the Fisheries sector.

Later, especially after the failure of the Hasmonean Kingdom (37 BCE) and the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars (66‚Äì135 CE), the figure of the Jewish messiah was one who would deliver the Jews from oppression and usher in an Olam HaBa (\\"world to come\\") or Messianic Age. Some people were looking forward to a military leader who would defeat the Seleucid or Roman enemies and establish an independent Jewish kingdom. Others, like the author of the Psalms of Solomon, stated that the messiah was a charismatic teacher who would give the correct interpretation of Mosaic law, restore Israel, and judge mankind.Messiah (overview) on livius.org List of Jewish messiah claimants This is a list of notable people who have been said to be a messiah, either by themselves or by their followers. The list is divided into categories, which are sorted according to date of birth (where known). =1st century= A stained-glass image of Jesus Christ from the 1930s * Jesus of Nazareth (ca. 4 BCE‚Äì30/33 CE), in Galilee and the Roman province of Judea. Jews who believed him to be the Messiah were the first Christians, also known as Jewish Christians. It is estimated that there are 2.5 billion Christians in the world today, making Jesus of Nazareth the most widely followed, and most famous, Messiah claimant. Muslims also believe Jesus was the Messiah, but not the Son of God. (see also: Judaism's view of Jesus) * Theudas (?- c. 46 CE), led an unsuccessful lived revolt against Rome somewhere between 44 and 46 CE. Mentioned by Josephus. * Simon of Peraea (?- died c. 5 BCE -15 CE), former slave of Herod the Great (74/73 BCE - c. 4 BCE), led a Jewish revolt. Mentioned by Josephus. *Athronges, leader of a Jewish insurrection against Herod Archelaus (23 BCE - c 18 CE). =2nd century= With the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, the appearance of messiahs ceased for a time. Sixty years later a politico-Messianic movement of large proportions took place. * Simon bar Kokhba (also: Bar Kosiba) (?‚Äì died c. 135), led a revolt against Rome circa 132‚Äì135 CE. Bar Kokhba was hailed as Messiah-king by Rabbi Akiva, who referred to him using Numbers xxiv. 17: \\"There shall come forth a star out of Jacob, and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite through the corners of Moab,\\" and Hag. ii. 21, 22: \\"I will shake the heavens and the earth and I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms....\\" (Talmud tractate Sanhedrin 97b). His messiahship was doubted by some, but bar Kokhba led a rebellion and founded a short-lived Jewish state. He was killed in the siege of Betar, which was the final battle of the Third Jewish‚ÄìRoman War that devastated Judea. =5th century= * Moses of Crete. The unsuccessful conclusion of the Bar Kokba war put an end for a while to Messianic movements, but Messianic hopes were nonetheless cherished. In accordance with computations found in the Talmud, the Messiah was expected to appear in the years 440 (Sanh. 97b) or 471 ('Ab. Zarah 9b). This expectation in connection with the disturbances in the Roman empire attendant upon invasions may have raised up hopes of the Messiah. Moses of Crete appeared about this time and won over many Jews to his movement. He promised to lead the people, like the ancient Moses, dry-shod through the sea back to Israel. In about 440‚Äì470, his followers, convinced by him, left their possessions and waited for the promised day, when at his command many cast themselves into the sea to return to Israel, many found death while others were rescued. The putative Messiah himself disappeared.(Socrates, \\"Historia Ecclesiastica,\\" vii. 38; Gr√§tz, \\"Gesch.\\" 3d ed., iv. 354‚Äì355) Socrates of Constantinople states that Moses of Crete fled, while the Chronicle of John of Niki√ª claims that he perished in the sea. While he called himself Moses, the Chronicle gives his actual name as 'Fiskis'.(John of Nikiu, \\"Chronicle,\\" LXXXVI.1‚Äì11) =7th century= The Khuzistan Chronicle records an otherwise-unknown Messianic claimant who arose alongside the Muslim conquest of Khuzistan. This Messiah led the Jews in destroying numerous Christian churches in Iraq and coastal Iran.Robert Hoyland, Seeing Islam as Others Saw It (Princeton: Darwin Press, 1997), 28Khuzistan Chronicle =8th century= The claimants that followed played their roles in the Orient, and were at the same time religious reformers whose work influenced Karaism.

Known as Abu Isa, he claimed to be the last of the five forerunners of the Messiah and that God had chosen him to free Israel. Having gathered a large number of followers he rebelled against the caliph in Persia.Hoyland, ibid. He was defeated and killed at Rai. His followers claimed that he was inspired, offering as proof the fact that he wrote books - even though he was illiterate. He founded the first sect that arose in Judaism after the destruction of the Temple, the 'Isawiyya. * Yudghan, called \\"Al-Ra'i\\" (\\"the shepherd of the flock of his people\\"), who lived and taught in Persia in the first half of the 8th century. He was disciple of Abu Isa who continued the faith after Isa was slain.. He declared himself to be a prophet, and was regarded by his disciples as the Messiah. He came from Hamadan, and taught doctrines he claimed to have received through prophecy. According to Shahristani, he opposed anthropomorphism, taught the doctrine of free will, and held that the Torah had an allegorical meaning in addition to its literal one. He admonished his followers to lead an ascetic life, to abstain from meat and wine, and to pray and fast often, following in this his master Abu 'Isa. He held that the observance of the Sabbath and festivals was merely a matter of memorial. After his death his followers formed a sect, the Yudghanites, who believed he had not died but would return at a future date. * Serene (his name is given variously in the sources as Sherini, Sheria, Serenus, Zonoria, Sa√ºra, Severus) the Syrian was born a Christian. He preached in the district of Mardin between 720 and 723. Those Christian sources dependent on Theophilus's history report that \\"Severus\\" proclaimed himself Messiah;Hoyland, 654. Also Theophanes, trans. Harry Turtledove (U. of Penn. Press, 1982), 93 but without naming him. the Zuqnin Chronicle reports that he proclaimed himself Moses \\"sent again for the salvation of Israel\\".Hoyland, 28; on the publications of this Chronicle up to 1997: Hoyland, 739. Serene promised \\"to lead you into the desert in order to introduce you then to the inheritance of the Promised Land which you shall possess as before\\";Zuqnin Chronicle apud Hoyland. more as a \\"prophet like Moses\\" than as a Davidic \\"anointed one\\" as such. The immediate occasion for his appearance may have been the restriction of the liberties of the Jews by the caliph Omar II (717‚Äì720) and his proselytizing efforts.Jewish Encyclopedia 1901‚Äì1905. Hoyland cites instead Leo III's forced baptism of Jews, but if that were the case then Serene should have been agitating against Constantinople rather than against the Muslim amirate. Serene had followers even in Spain, where the Jews were suffering under the oppressive taxation of the new Arab rulers they had enthusiastically welcomed, and many left their homes for the new Moses.Jewish Encyclopedia These Jews paid instead a tithe to Serene.Hoyland, citing Theophilus. This must be from the synopsis between Agapius, the 1234 Chronicle, and Michael the Syrian. Theophanes says only that he \\"deceived\\" them. Like Abu 'Isa and Yudghan, Serene also was a religious reformer. According to Natronai b. Nehemiah, gaon of Pumbedita (719‚Äì730), Serene was hostile to rabbinic Judaism laws. His followers disregarded the dietary laws, the rabbinically instituted prayers, and the prohibition against the \\"wine of libation\\"; they worked on the second day of the festivals; they did not write marriage and divorce documents according to Talmudic prescriptions, and did not accept the Talmudic prohibition against the marriage of near relatives.Heinrich Gr√§tz, Geschichte der Juden, l.c. note 14. This is the source of the 1901-6 Jewish Encyclopedia;, Gr√§tz had this information from Natronai's Gaonic Responsa [Moda'i] Serene was arrested. Brought before Caliph Yazid II, he declared that he had acted only in jest, whereupon he was handed over to the Jews for punishment.Theophilus in Hoyland, 654, just says that Yazid had him executed. Natronai laid down the criteria by which Serene's followers might rejoin the synagogue; most of said followers then presumably did so.Hoyland 28 n. 59 cites Gaonic Responsa 3.V.10. =12th century= Under the influence of the Crusades the number of Messiahs increased, and the 12th century records many of them; * One appeared in France (c. 1087) and was slain by the French.Jewish Messiah, By Dan Cohn-Sherbok * Another appeared in the province of C√≥rdoba (c. 1117). * Moses al-Dar'i, a Moroccan teacher, gained a large following. He was convinced that the Messiah would free the Jews in the Almoravid countries at Passover 1127.Moses al-Dar'i (c.1127) on livius.org * David Alroy or Alrui, who was born in Amadiya, appeared in Persia about 1160 declaring himself a Messiah. Taking advantage of his personal popularity, the disturbed and weakened condition of the caliphate, and the discontent of the Jews, who were burdened with a heavy poll tax, he set out upon his political schemes, asserting that he had been sent by God to free the Jews from the Muslim yoke and to lead them back to Jerusalem. For this purpose he summoned the warlike Jews of northern Persia and his coreligionists of Mosul and Baghdad to come armed to his aid and to assist in the capture of Amadia. From this point his career is enveloped in legend. His movement failed, and he is said to have been assassinated, while asleep, by his own father-in-law. A heavy fine was exacted from the Jews for this uprising. After his death Alroy had many followers in Khoy, Salmas, Tabriz, and Maragheh, and these formed a sect called the Menahemists, from the Messianic name \\"Menahem,\\" assumed by their founder. Benjamin Disraeli wrote the novel Alroy based on this man's life. * The Yemenite Messiah, was an anonymous alleged forerunner of the Messiah from Yemen, who appeared in Fez. Just as the Muslims were making determined efforts to convert the Jews living there. He declared the misfortunes of the time to be prognostications of the coming Messianic kingdom, and called upon the Jews to divide their property with the poor, preaching repentance that those who gave their worldly possessions to the poor would gain a treasure in heaven. This anonymous Messiah candidate was the subject of Maimonides' Iggeret Teman. He continued his activity for a year, when he was arrested by the Muslim authorities and beheaded at his own suggestion, it is said, in order that he might prove the truth of his mission by returning to life.The Yemenite Messiah (c.1172) on livius.org Nothing is known beyond the mention of him in Maimonides' \\"Iggeret Teman\\" (The Yemen Epistle). =13th century= * Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia (b. 1240-after 1291), the cabalist, began the series of putative Messiahs whose activity is deeply influenced by their cabalistic speculations. Because of his mystic studies, Abulafia came to believe first that he was a prophet; and in a prophetic book, which he published in Urbino (1279), he declared that God had spoken to him. It is thought, though not proven, that in Messina, on the island of Sicily, where he was well received, and won disciples, he declared himself the Messiah and announced 1290 as the year for the Messianic era to begin. Solomon ben Adret, who was appealed to with regard to Abulafia's claims, condemned him, and some congregations declared against him. Persecuted in Sicily, he went to the island of Comino, near Malta (c. 1288), still asserting in his writings his mission. His end is unknown. Two of his disciples, Joseph Gikatilla and Samuel, both from Medinaceli, later claimed to be prophets and miracle-workers. The latter foretold in mystic language at Ayllon in Segovia the advent of the Messiah. Abulafia gained much modern notoriety as the name for the computer of a character in Umberto Eco's novel Foucault's Pendulum. * Nissim ben Abraham (?), another individual making claims of prophethood, active in Avila around 1295. His followers told of him that, although ignorant, he had been suddenly endowed, by an angel, with the power to write a mystic work, The Wonder of Wisdom, with a commentary thereon. Again an appeal was made to Solomon ben Adret, who doubted Nissim's prophetic pretension and urged careful investigation. The prophet continued his activity, nevertheless, and even fixed the last day of the fourth month, Tammuz, 1295, as the date for the Messiah's coming. The credulous prepared for the event by fasting and almsgiving, and came together on the appointed day. Instead of finding the Messiah, some saw on their garments little crosses, perhaps pinned on by unbelievers to ridicule the movement. In their disappointment some of Nissim's followers are said to have gone over to Christianity. =15th century= * Moses Botarel of Cisneros (?), active around 1413. After the lapse of a century another claimant came forward with Messianic pretensions. According to H. Gr√§tz (l.c. viii. 404), identified as Moses Botarel. He claimed to be a sorcerer able to combine the names of God. =16th century= * Asher Lammlein, Asher Kay (K√§ei) (?), a German proclaiming himself a forerunner of the Messiah, appeared in Istria, near Venice in 1502, and announced that if the Jews would be penitent and practice charity the Messiah would come within half a year, and a pillar of cloud and of smoke would precede the Jews on their return to Jerusalem. He found believers in Italy and Germany, even among some Christians. In obedience to his preaching, people fasted and prayed and gave alms to prepare for the coming of the Messiah, so that the year came to be known as the \\"year of penitence.\\" However, by the end of the year of penitence Lammlein had either died or disappeared. * David Reubeni (1490-1541?) and Solomon Molcho (1500‚Äì1532): Reubeni was an adventurer who travelled in Portugal, Italy, and Turkey. He pretended to be the ambassador and brother of the King of Khaibar, a town and former district of Arabia, in which the descendants of the \\"lost tribes\\" of Reuben and Gad were supposed to dwell. He claimed he was sent to the Pope and the powers of Europe to secure cannon and firearms for war against the Muslims, who prevented the union of the Jews living on the two sides of the Red Sea. He denied expressly that he was a Messiah or a prophet (comp. Fuenn, Keneset Yisrael, p. 256), claiming that he was merely a warrior. The credence which he found at the papal court in 1524, the reception accorded to him in 1525 at the Portuguese court (whither he came at the invitation of John III, and where he at first received the promise of help), and the temporary cessation of persecution of the Marrano;all gave the Portuguese and Spanish Marranos reason to believe that Reuveni was a forerunner of the Messiah. Selaya, inquisitor of Badajoz, complained to the King of Portugal that a Jew who had come from the Orient (referring to Reuveni) had filled the Spanish Marranos with the hope that the Messiah would come and lead Israel from all lands back to Israel, and that he had even emboldened them to overt acts (comp. H. Gr√§tz, l.c. ix. 532). Reuveni met Rabbi Solomon Molcho, a former Spanish Christian who had reverted to Judaism. Reuveni and Molcho were arrested in Regensburg on the orders of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Spain. He was taken to Mantua, in Italy where, having been baptized a Catholic, he was convicted of heresy and burned at the stake in November, 1532. A spirit of expectancy was aroused by Reuveni's stay in Portugal. In Herrera del Duque, close to Puebla de Alcocer (Badajoz, Extremadura), a Jewish girl of 15 described ecstatic visions in which she spoke with the Messiah, who took her to heaven, where she saw those who had been burned seated on thrones of gold, and who assured her of his imminent return. She (known only as the Maiden of Herrera) was enthusiastically proclaimed a prophetess, and such was the commotion caused by her alleged visions that the Toledo Inquisition had her promptly arrested. =17th century= Shabbatai Tzvi in 1665 * Sabbatai Zevi (alternative spellings: Shabbetai, Sabbetai, Shabbesai; Zvi, Tzvi) (b. at Smyrna 1626; d. at Dulcigno (present day Ulcinj) 1676), an Ottoman Jew who claimed to be the Messiah, but then converted to Islam. He still has followers today in the D√∂nmeh. One of the most important messianic movements, and whose influence was widespread throughout Jewry. His influence is felt even today. After his death, Sabbatai was followed by a line of putative followers who declared themselves Messiahs and are sometimes grouped as the \\"Sabbethaian Messiahs\\".Gershom Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi: The Mystical Messiah: 1626-1676, Routledge Kegan Paul, London, 1973 , American Edition, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1973 (hardcover edn.); Gershom Scholem, \\"Shabbetai Zevi,\\" in Encyclopaedia Judaica, Second Edition, Farmington Hills, Michigan, 2007, vol. 18, pp. 340‚Äì359. . ** Barukhia Russo (1695-1740; Osman Baba), successor of Sabbatai Zevi. ** Mordecai Mokia (1650‚Äì1729), (\\"the Rebuker\\") of Eisenstadt, another follower of Shabbethai who remained faithful to him, Mordecai Mokia·∏• (\\"the Rebuker\\") of Eisenstadt, also pretended to be a Messiah. His period of activity was from 1678 to 1682 or 1683. He preached at first that Shabbethai was the true Messiah, that his conversion was for mystic reasons necessary, that he did not die but would reveal himself within three years after his supposed death, and pointed to the persecution of the Jews in Oran (by Spain), in Austria, and in France, and to the pestilence in Germany as prognostications of his coming. He found a following among Hungarian, Moravian, and Bohemian Jews. Going a step further, he declared that he was the Davidic Messiah. Shabbethai, according to him, was only the Ephraitic Messiah and was furthermore rich, and therefore could not accomplish the redemption of Israel. He (Mordecai), being poor, was the real Messiah and at the same time the incarnation of the soul of the Ephraitic Messiah. Italian Jews heard of him and invited him to Italy. He went there about 1680, and received a warm welcome in Reggio and Modena. He spoke of Messianic preparations, which he had to make in Rome, and hinted at having perhaps to adopt Christianity outwardly. Denounced to the Inquisition, or advised to leave Italy, he returned to Bohemia, and then went to Poland, where he is said to have become insane. From his time a sect began to form there, which still existed at the beginning of the Mendelssohnian era. ** Jacob Querido (died 1690), son of Joseph Filosof, and brother of the fourth wife of Sabbatai, became the head of the Shabbethaians in Salonica, being regarded by them as the new incarnation of Shabbethai. He pretended to be Shabbethai's son and adopted the name Jacob Tzvi. With 400 followers converted to Islam about 1687, forming a sect called the D√∂nmeh. He himself even made a pilgrimage to Mecca (c. 1690). After his death during the pilgrimage his son Berechiah or Berokia succeeded him (c. 1695-1740). ** Miguel (Abraham) Cardoso (1630-1706), born of Marano parents, may have been initiated into the Shabbethaian movement by Moses Pinheiro in Leghorn. He became a prophet of the Messiah, and when the latter embraced Islam he justified this treason, saying that it was necessary for the Messiah to be reckoned among the sinners in order to atone for Israel's idolatry. He applied Isa. liii. to Shabbethai, and sent out epistles to prove that Shabbethai was the true Messiah, and he even suffered persecution for advocating his cause. Later he considered himself as the Ephraitic Messiah, asserting that he had marks on his body, which were proof of this. He preached and wrote of the speedy coming of the Messiah, fixing different dates until his death (see Cardoso, Miguel). ** L√∂bele Prossnitz (Joseph ben Jacob) (?-1750), (early 18th century). He taught that God had given dominion of the world to the \\"pious one,\\" i.e., the one who had entered into the depths of Kabbalah. Such a representative of God had been Shabbethai, whose soul had passed into other \\"pious\\" men, into Jonathan Eybesch√ºtz and into himself. Another, Isaiah Hasid (a brother-in-law of the Shabbethaian Judah Hasid), who lived in Mannheim, secretly claimed to be the resurrected Messiah, although publicly he had abjured Shabbethaian beliefs. He was a proven fraud who nevertheless attained some following amongst former followers of Sabbatai, calling himself the \\"Messiah ben Joseph.\\" =18th century= * Jacob Joseph Frank (born 1726 in Podolia; died 1791), founder of the Frankist movement, also claimed to be the messiah. In his youth he made contact with the D√∂nmeh. He taught that he was a reincarnation of King David and the Patriarch Joseph. Having secured a following among some Turkish and Wallachian Jews, he came in 1755 to Podolia, where the Shabbethaians were in need of a leader, and revealed himself to them as the reincarnation of the soul of Berechiah. He laid stress on the idea of the \\"holy king\\" who was at the same time Messiah, and he accordingly called himself santo se√±or (\\"holy lord\\"). His followers claimed he performed miracles; and they even prayed to him. His purpose, as well as that of his sect, was to uproot rabbinic Judaism. He was forced to leave Podolia; and his followers were persecuted. Returning in 1759, he advised his followers to embrace Christianity, and about 1,000 converted and became Polish gentry of Jewish origins. He himself converted in Warsaw in November 1759. But he ran afoul of the Catholic Church and for a time was imprisoned for heresy. However, even in prison he remained the head of his sect. * Eve Frank (1754‚Äì1816/1817), was the daughter of Jacob Frank. In 1770 Eve was declared to be the incarnation of the Shekinah, the female aspect of God, as well as the reincarnation of the Virgin Mary and thus became the object of a devotional subcult herself in Czƒôstochowa, with some followers keeping small statues of her in their homes. Historian Jerry Rabow sees her as the only woman to have been declared a Jewish messiah. =19th century= * Shukr Kuhayl I, 19th-century Yemenite Messiah candidate. * Judah ben Shalom (Shukr Kuhayl II), 19th-century Yemenite Messiah candidate. =20th century= * Moses Guibbory (1899‚Äì1985) * Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn (1880 ‚Äì 1950), sixth rebbe (spiritual leader) of Chabad Lubavitch, claimed to be \\"Atzmus u'mehus alein vi er hat zich areingeshtalt in a guf\\" (Yiddish and English for: \\"Essence and Existence [of God] which has placed itself in a body\\"),Likutei Sichos, Vol 2, pp. 510-511. and to be the Messiah. *Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902‚Äì1994);Chabad messianism during his lifetime the belief that Schneerson was the messiah received an equivocal response.

This grew in size after his death and by some estimates most of the Chabad movement today has been taken over by the \\"Messiah Schneerson\\" movement, including many of the rabbis. Some of his followers believe Schneerson never died. While Schneerson remained vague about such assertions, many of his followers do believe he was the messiah.

For a true handstand, the exercise is performed free-standing, held in the air. To prepare the strength until one has built adequate balance, the feet are often placed against a wall, held by a partner, or secured in some other way from falling. Handstand pushups require significant strength, as well as balance and control if performed free-standing. Similar exercises The movement can be considered a bodyweight exercise similar to the military press, while the regular push-up is similar to the bench press. Muscles Handstand pushups increase the load on the triceps brachii muscles significantly over regular pushups, having the arms hold almost 100% of the body's weight rather than an average of 60 to 70% during normal pushups. Load is also shifted from the Pectoralis major muscle to the Anterior deltoids and Lateral deltoids due to the shoulders exerting in abduction while externally rotated, rather than transverse flexion. The upper fibres of the trapezius are also involved in elevating the shoulders. In free-standing handstand pushups, the core muscles and hand muscles are both used to keep the body balanced, from falling over back, forward, or to either side, and to maintain posture. This makes it a much stronger exercise for the wrist flexors, core and legs compared to regular pushups. Training Standard push-ups require only a very basic level of fitness, while handstand push-ups are among the most challenging of bodyweight exercises Due to the difficulty of the exercise, it is common to begin training with simpler, related movements. Methods of preparing without equipment (bodyweight exercise) include holding a static handstand position, performing the movement with a reduced range of motion, or performing only the eccentric portion of the movement. Preparing with weight- lifting (overhead press) is also common for strengthening the muscles involved, for those who lack adequate balance or who cannot support their bodyweight on their hands. When one can press their bodyweight, they have developed sufficient strength to do a handstand push up and then need to learn how to balance and exert themselves while inverted. Exercise 1 - The basic pushup The most basic exercise to start developing headstand push-up (as a true handstand push-up requires the head to go past the palms until the base of the neck is inline with the palms: this is a much harder feat of strength) strength hereafter referred to as hspu is the basic pushup. When doing the pushup care must be taken to ensure perfect form during each rep and full engagement of the scapulae at the top of the pushup. The focus is never on the number of reps but rather the quality of each rep. One quality rep will always be better than 5 poor reps. Exercise 2 - The pike pushup After developing sufficient strength and conditioning in the upper body through the basic pushup the next variation would be the pike pushup. The pike pushup starts of in the plank pushup plank position and involves walking the feet to as close as humanly possible to the hands. The movement is initiated by leaning forwards and loading the deltoids and triceps. As with all pushup exercises care must be taken to tuck the elbows as if attempting to have them track along the torso during the movement. A good hand placement is shoulder width apart but as a start 1 or 2 inches wider than shoulder width will make the movement easier. After the lean, bend the arms and aim to make a triangle with three points being the head and your two palms. Bad practice involves lowering the head inline with the palms. This movement is harder than the pushup and you requires practice to get the body accustomed to it. Exercise 3 - Elevated pike pushup This is a harder variation of the pike pushup and involves elevating the feet and following all the cues detailed for the pike pushup. A good guide with all pushups is to be able to do 5 sets of 10 reps before you start to think of moving on to the next progression Exercise 4 - Debatable At this point it must be understood clearly that although one has gotten considerably stronger, the gap between elevated pike pushups and wall supported handstand pushup is immense and will take a great amount of time to bridge. Different people make use of different exercises at this point to try and bridge the gap and it is up to the athlete to see what exercise would be most beneficial for them. A few of these are a. Floating pike pushups b. Back facing the wall handstand pushups c. Weighted pike pushups Points if Note 1\\\\. A solid handstand is a basic requirement 2\\\\. Negatives will help bridge the gap if carefully used 3\\\\. Consistency with one or two exercises (one hard and the other easy e.g. pike pushups followed by basic pushups) should be your goal as compared to trying out several different exercises all at the same time. Choose a staple, master it and move on after which it becomes the easy exercise. 4\\\\. Supplementary exercises can be anything that engages the upper body in a pushing manner e.g dips and military/dumbbell presses 5\\\\. Take care of your shoulders and elbows through proper joint preparation as this will increase your ability to train harder Modifications The range of motion of a handstand pushup can be increased by placing the hands on objects elevated from the floor, such as boxes or chairs, parallettes, or for the greatest difficulty, gymnastic rings. This allows the head to be lowered below the level of the palms, greatly increasing the difficulty of the movement. Difficulty can also be increased by adding further resistance, either in the form of weights attached to the torso; such as a weighted vest, attached to the legs, or resistance bands.  Risk  Caution should be taken not to have one's body suspended in an upside-down position for very long periods of time, since the human body lacks a design for forcing back blood that's running to the head (something intended by force of gravity to take care of itself). While small bouts of hanging upside down have not proven to be dangerous, people with pre-existing conditions for example could make matters worse and potentially increase the risk of, among others, stroke and pulmonary oedema.

Established in 1995, it aims to provide an environment for trading that is characterized by equity, transparency and competence, serving and maintaining the interest of investors. As of December 2012 there are 48 listed companies on PEX with a total market capitalization of about $3 billion in five main areas: financial services, insurance, investments, industry, and services. Most of the listed companies are profitable and trade in Jordanian Dinar, while others trade in US Dollars. In 2015 the CEO of the Palestine exchange was Mr. Ahmed Aweidah. They are characterised by being the only Arab exchange to have been regarded as a private entity since its founding. As of 2013, only stocks are traded on the exchange, however PEX is open to including other securities in the future. In 2009, the PEX ranked thirty third amongst the worldwide security markets, and regionally comes in second in terms of investor protection. About half of PEX's investment comes from Palestine, with the other half coming from overseas. History The Palestine Exchange or PEX, was incorporated as a private shareholding company in early 1995, with the Palestine Development & Investment Company (PADICO) as its major investor. The PEX was fully automated upon establishment - a first amongst the Arab Stock Exchanges. The PEX became a public shareholding company in February 2010 and was listed on April 4, 2011 responding to principles of transparency and good governance. The PEX operates under the supervision of the Palestinian Capital Market Authority. After the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) approved a PADICO-sponsored design and work plan in July 1995, a project team was put together by the PEX and entrusted to establish a fully electronic exchange and depository. EFA Software Services, a Canadian company, provided both the trading and settlement & clearing systems. By August 1996 the Exchange was fully operational, and on November 7 of that year the PEX signed an operating agreement with the PNA, allowing for the licensing and qualification of brokerage firms to take place. On February 18, 1997, the PEX conducted its first trading session. The PEX is very appealing in terms of market capitalization, it is financially sound, and well capitalized to maintain a steady business in a volatile world, as it passed with the minimum level of impact of the global financial crisis compared to other MENA Exchanges. The Exchange launched an e-trading portal on April 24, 2007. The Palestine Exchange is a member of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges.  Regulatory framework  In 2005, with the development of the legal structure of the securities sector in Palestine, particularly the issuance of the Securities Law No. (12) of 2004 and the Capital Market Authority Law No. (13) of 2004, the Palestine Capital Market Authority (CMA) took over the responsibility of supervising the PEX and issuing securities by the public shareholding companies. The PEX operates in accordance with the Securities Law No. (12) of 2004, and the bylaws that stemmed from it in a manner that does not contravene with the CMA directives. The PEX works also in accordance with modern regulations. These regulations include: listing regulation, trading regulation, disclosure regulation, membership regulation, dispute resolution regulation and the regulation of professional conduct.

President Iskander Mirza laid the foundation-stone of Guddu Barrage on 2 February 1957. The barrage was completed in 1962 at a cost of 474.8 million rupees and inaugurated by Field Marshal Ayub Khan in 1962. Guddu Barrage is used to control water flow in the River Indus for irrigation and flood control purposes. It has a discharge capacity of 1.2 million cubic feet per second (34,000 m¬≥/s). It is a gate-controlled weir type barrage with a navigation lock. The barrage has 64 bays, each 60 feet (18 m) wide. The maximum flood level height of Guddu Barrage is 26 feet (8 m). It controls irrigation supplies to 2.9 million acres (12,000 km¬≤) of agricultural land in the Kashmore, Jacobabad, Larkana and Sukkur districts of Sindh province and the Naseerabad district of Balochistan province. It feeds Ghotki Feeder, Begari Feeder, Desert and Pat Feeder canals. Rehabilitation of Guddu Barrage Bidding process for the Guddu barrage rehabilitation and modernization project has been finalized with the lowest bid offered by Descon engineering that was handed over to technical team for evaluation. Spokesperson of Sindh Irrigation Development Authority (SIDA) informed APP on Saturday that an umbrella project - Sindh Barrage Improvement Project (SBIP)- was being implemented for improving the reliability and safety of the barrages situated on river Indus in Sindh province besides strengthening Sindh Irrigation Department's capacity to operate and manage the barrage. The ECNEC approved the project worth Rs 20,241 million on March 13, 2015. Under the project rehabilitation and modernization of Guddu Barrage to be carried out in first phase with estimated cost of Rs. 1979 million and the date of completion was set June 2020. The project also includes Foreign Project Assistance (FPA) of around Rs.1780 million through International Development Association- development arm of the World Bank. According to sources at irrigation department, the bidding process for construction works of the project was held the other day in which Descon engineering of Pakistan, China Harbor Guangxi Hydro electric and Cinotech Xejiang JV offered their bids and Descon was selected for offering the lowest bid in presence of concerned officials and representative of Transparency International. The bid would be evaluated by the technical team and then its report and bid documents would be forwarded to financing partner IDA for further evaluation. The Descon already undertook mega projects like Taunsa Barrage rehabilitation and modernization, Sukkur Barrage rehabilitation and modernization, Kacchi canal, Rainee canal and Mangla Dam raising projects. SIDA spokesman informed that primary function of the Guddu Barrage was to provide irrigation water to over one million hectares of agricultural lands in the Jacobabad, Larkana, Sukkur and the Naseerabad districts, by feeding the Ghotki Feeder and Rainee canals on the left (east) side and the Begari Sindh (BS) Feeder and Desert Pat Feeder canals on the right (west) side. The Guddu Barrage has a span of 1,400 meters. It consists of 64 gates of 18 meters each and one navigation lock with a span of 15 meters. The barrage is also used for river control and flood management. It has been designed to pass a super-flood discharge of up to 33,980 cubic metres per seconds (m3/sec). The barrage is also an important transport link across the River Indus and provides cooling water for the thermal power station at Guddu while two major gas lines cross the barrage. The barrage was commissioned in 1962 and has now seen over 50 years of active service. Sindh Barrages Improvement Project (SBIP) under which the Guddu Barrage rehabilitation will be carried out is needed due to natural ageing of the infrastructure. The rehabilitation work will eliminate possible sources of failure and potentially give the structure another 50 years of life. The SBIP will support the gate replacement works to improve the regulation and the flow of the barrage, the replacement of 64 main barrage steel gates, 25 main canal head regulator gates, and hoist gears including all mechanical and electrical equipment. This project will also finance the independent Panel of Experts, who will review, monitor, evaluate, and help guide the rehabilitation process with regards to the safety of the barrage. The primary beneficiaries include over 2.6 million people, across three million acres of irrigated land in Kashmore, Ghotki, Jacobabad, Sukkur, and Shikarpur districts of Sindh, and Nasirabad and Jafarabad districts of Balochistan, who will receive reliable supply of water while local communities in flood-vulnerable areas who will benefit from improvement in flood management and reduction in risks of embankment breaches; since the capacity of the barrage to pass flood waters will improve as well.

The neighborhood derives its name from Temescal Creek, a significant watercourse in the city. Geography The neighborhood's boundaries have changed substantially over time and have often been considered different by different groups of people. The modern neighborhood's western bound is generally considered to be the Grove-Shafter Freeway (State Route 24,), due to the visual divide of the elevated freeway. However, some consider Martin Luther King Jr. Way to be the western border. The eastern bound is generally considered to be Broadway. The northern bound historically is considered to end at Alcatraz Avenue & Shattuck (at the South Berkeley border), and the southern bound to be either 36th or 40th Street. Demographics Temescal is primarily a residential neighborhood. Most of the houses in Temescal are early twentieth century bungalows along tree-lined streets. There are also many multi-family homes and mid-size apartment complexes interspersed throughout the neighborhood. Temescal was an Italian- American neighborhood until the late 1960s. Temescal saw many changes in demographics in the past 10 years as new developments and upscale shopping and restaurants entered the neighborhood. Large numbers of young couples with children moved to Temescal as the real estate prices in nearby Rockridge grew too expensive for middle-class families. People of different racial and economic backgrounds live side by side in the neighborhood. Temescal is a diverse neighborhood with concentrations of Ethiopian and Eritrean immigrants. Public life The commercial heart of Temescal is Telegraph Avenue, between the MacArthur BART Station and 51st Street. This area is known locally as the home to popular restaurants, such as North Light, Tara's Organic Ice Cream, Roses' Tap Room, Cholita Linda, Aunt Mary's, Bakesale Betty, and Burma Superstar. Another commercial zone runs along 40th St, between Broadway and Telegraph. This area includes a mixture of food service and retail. Restaurants along this stretch of 40th ave include Magpie serving gourmet pizza alongside 39 taps of craft beer, cider & wine, Bierhaus with a great selection of about a dozen German beers and bites, Homeroom mac-n-cheese, Subrosa Coffee, Oakland Yard Wine Bar and Tacos Oscar. There are many Ethiopian restaurants here, especially on Telegraph north of 51st St. There are also many Korean establishments along Telegraph Ave. Temescal Farmers' Market, begun in 2006, is held on Sundays in the parking lot of the Department of Motor Vehicles facility on Claremont Ave. Mama's Royal Cafe, locally famous for breakfast, and Clove & Hoof are located on Broadway, near the border of Temescal and the Piedmont Avenue neighborhood. Studio One, located on 45th Street, is home to art classes and workshops. Counter Culture Labs is a public laboratory and hackerspace located in the Temescal neighborhood. Royal Nonesuch Gallery is an artist run art and event space located on Telegraph and 43rd. Temescal Pool, located next door, is open to the public. The neighborhood is also home to several public and private schools, including Park Day School and the architectural landmark Oakland Technical High School on Broadway. History Temescal was originally a separate village that had built up around the estate of Vicente Peralta, which was located near the modern intersections of Telegraph Avenue and Claremont Boulevard. (Vicente's estate was part of the larger Peralta Grant that spanned 44,800 acres of land in the East Bay.) A post office opened in North Temescal in 1877, the name was changed to Alden in 1899. The name commemorated S.E. Alden, farmer and landowner. In 1908 the Alden post office was designated as Station E of the Oakland post office.The location indicated by the GNIS coordinates for the former Alden post office is now in the shopping village in the neighborhood of Montclair, Oakland, California, which is the current location of the Station E post office. A July 8, 1916 San Francisco Call newspaper article states that the Station E post office was at 49th St. and Telegraph Avenue for 30 years. In 1897, the residents of Temescal voted to join the City of Oakland in an effort to gain access to higher quality public schools and police services. At the time that the City of Oakland annexed Temescal, Temescal was considered to consist of all land north of 36th Street (the northern bound of the City of Oakland at the time) between the Emeryville city limit to the west and Broadway to the east. The word temescal derives from the word temescalli, which means \\"sweat house\\" in the Nahuatl language of the Mexica (\\"Aztec\\") people of Mexico. It is surmised that the Peraltas or perhaps one of their ranch hands (vaqueros) had seen local indigenous (Ohlone) structures along the creek similar to those in other parts of New Spain which were called temescalli. Temescal has long been an important junction of several principal thoroughfares: Telegraph, Claremont, and Shattuck Avenues, and 51st Street.The Temescal Pool on 45th St. in Oakland The earliest telegraph wire from Oakland to Sacramento went through the area, up Claremont Avenue and over the hills at Claremont Canyon. Temescal was the site of agriculture, cattle grazing and greenhouses when, in the 1890s, an opera house was built in parkland north of the creek crossing at 51st street. The area grew and was developed into Idora Park, the earliest \\"trolley park\\" in the East Bay. In 1929 the amusement park was closed and was razed in 1930. A plan to build mid-rise apartment blocks called the Midtown District fell through, and a tract of storybook houses was built on the site between 1930 and 1934. It is reported to be the first development in the American west with underground utilities. Until the early 20th century, a wide wooden bridge spanned Temescal Creek, carrying both road (Telegraph Avenue) and railroad tracks. The horsecar line to the University of California along today's Telegraph Avenue (then called Humboldt Avenue in Oakland and Choate in Berkeley) operated out of a horse barn at 51st and Telegraph. When the horsecar was replaced by electric streetcars, the horse barn was replaced by a carbarn. The carbarn became the Western Carhouse of the Key System's streetcar division, the East Bay Street Railways. When the streetcars ceased operation in November of 1947, the car barn was remodeled to become Vern's market. Vern's closed in the 1970s and the building sat vacant for years. Eventually it was demolished and replaced by a strip mall, including a Walgreens store. The Kingfish Cafe and Pub, a popular bar in Temescal Temescal Tool Lending Library Temescal is home to one of the few tool-lending libraries in the Bay Area‚Äîindeed, in the U.S. (The Berkeley Public Library also has a tool-lending library at their nearby South Branch.) The Temescal branch of the Oakland Public Library operates this facility, which lends tools, free of charge, to library patrons for repairs and home- improvement projects.

Farr (January 9, 1895 ‚Äì April 16, 1983) was an American botanist known for her discovery of the mechanism by which cellulose is formed in the walls of plant cells. Early life Wanda Farr (n√©e Kirkbride) was born near New Matamoras, Ohio on January 9, 1895, to parents Frederick Alonzo Kirkbride and Clara M Nicolaus. When she was four years old, her father died and she and her mother went to live with Wanda's grandparents in New Matamoras. Her great grandfather, Dr. Samuel Richardson, was a physician who lived in the same town. He helped cultivate her interest in science, in particular in plants and growing things. Education and research Wanda Farr at table with microscope Wanda K. Farr received a bachelor's degree in biology from Ohio University at Athens in 1915 and a master's degree studying Botany at Columbia university in 1918. After graduating from Columbia, she taught at Kansas State University and Texas A&M; University. Around 1928, after marrying botanist Clifford Farr, Wanda Farr postponed enrolling in a Ph.D. program in order to move with her husband to Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. There, she began working as a researcher under Dr. Montrose Burrows at the Barnard Skin and Cancer Clinic, and her husband began working as an assistant professor in botany at the same university. Farr performed microscopy on live animal and plant cell cultures. In February 1928, Clifford Farr died and the University asked Farr to teach his classes. She began research related to her late husband's work studying the growth of root hairs in plants. Within a few years, Wanda Farr was hired by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a cotton technologist on the strength of her previous root hair research. She moved to the Boyce Thompson Institute laboratory in Yonkers, New York. After approximately ten years of research, she was appointed as Director of the Cellulose Laboratory of the Chemical Foundation at the same institute, until she was called to the laboratories of the American Cyanimide Company to do World War II war-related research. In 1956, she started her own research firm, Farr Cyochemical Laboratories. The Royal Microscopical Society elected her a fellow. She was also a member of the Botanical Society of America and the Torrey Botanical Club. Notable scientific discovery Wanda Margarite Kirkbride (1895-1983) Farr answered a question that had puzzled researchers for a hundred years. Cellulose, a primary component of cell walls, was known to be constructed from cellulose granules. These granules had appeared to microscopists prior to this time to emerge fully formed in the cell's protoplasm. By contrast, the formation of starch, which is composed of the same elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, could be seen to occur in stages, in structures called plasmids inside the cell protoplasm. Farr discovered that cellulose-manufacturing plastids do exist in the protoplasm of the cell, but that such plastids had been invisible because they have a light refractive index similar to that of the protoplasm in which they are located. She made the plastids visible in cotton cells by mounting the cells in a new bath derived from the juices of the cotton plant rather than in water, which had been used previously.

Written by Phil Klemmer and Cathy Belben and directed by Harry Winer, the episode premiered on UPN on October 26, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica helps Jackie Cook (Tessa Thompson) deal with her purported credit card fraud. Meanwhile, the Sheriff's race heats up, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) faces the complicated aftermath of learning that Nathan Woods (Cress Williams) is actually his father.  Synopsis  Directly after the previous episode, Wallace angrily confronts Alicia (Erica Gimpel) about Nathan being his father. Alicia tells Wallace that Nathan betrayed her while supposedly going on a police case and that Wallace's purported father, Hank Fennel, is his legal father. In class, Veronica nominates Wallace for homecoming king, and another boy nominates Veronica. Wallace tells Veronica that Nathan is his father before Jackie approaches and expresses her jealousy. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) tells Veronica that he has a 12-point lead in the sheriff race. In the bathroom, Jackie walks up to Veronica and tells her that she needs her help with her credit card, which has been maxed out without her knowledge. Veronica reluctantly agrees. Alicia confronts Keith for Wallace's birth certificate, which he stole in the previous episode. They get into an increasingly heated debate. Nathan talks to Wallace, and he says that he's tried to find Wallace for years and hands him letters that he sent. Wallace successfully made the nominating pool for homecoming royalty. Logan (Jason Dohring) and Jackie flirt in school. Veronica matches the credit card items with a girl named Cora (Dana Davis) and invites her to pick out homecoming dresses together to find out more. Logan and Duncan (Teddy Dunn) agree to hang out. During a Sheriff's race debate, Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) brings up the fact that Keith would have arrested Ed Doyle for a DUI if he had followed procedure. Veronica finds out that Cora could not have stolen Jackie's credit card. Duncan invites Veronica to homecoming. Keith has lost his lead in the Sheriff's race. Wallace shows Alicia the letters and she blows up at him. Veronica plants a listening device in Sheriff Lamb's office. Veronica goes to the first place the credit card was spent, the psychic shop, where Jackie went. Veronica decides to go on the psychic, Madam Sophie's, show to expose her as a fraud. Veronica, listening through the audio device, finds out that Sheriff Lamb blackmails Jackie's father, the baseball player Terence Cook. The girl who went on the psychic's show says that she has a message from the bus crash, and Veronica listens. Veronica goes on the show, and without having told anyone, the psychic has a ‚Äúmessage‚Äù from Lilly, but it turns out that Jackie framed Veronica to embarrass her. Wallace angrily tells Veronica to let it go while simultaneously telling Jackie that he's not going to the homecoming dance with her because of the incident. Veronica shows Keith the message before the bus crash, and there is an explosion on the tape, indicating that the bus is sabotaged. Veronica tells Keith to use the information to his advantage, but he denies the suggestion. Homecoming occurs, where Jackie is alone and Veronica and Duncan dance. Veronica sees Jackie dancing with Logan, and Jackie yells at Veronica. Keith shows Lamb the message evidence. Alicia calls Keith and says that Wallace went missing after the prom. Veronica calls Wallace, but he doesn't pick up. We see that Wallace is driving away with his father.  Cultural references  The cultural references of the episode include: *Veronica mentions \\"Love Hangover\\". *Logan insults someone by calling them Zippy the Pinhead. *Veronica compares Nathan to Donnie Brasco. *Veronica says that her coffee spill looks like a Rorschach test. *Veronica compares Duncan to Howard Hughes. *Sheriff Lamb and Terrence both want the latter to make the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. *Veronica paraphrases a statement supposedly uttered by Shoeless Joe Jackson. *Keith references the album Cheap Trick at Budokan.  Arc significance  *Veronica bugs Sheriff Lamb's office and finds him blackmailing Terrence Cook, who has gambling debt. *Veronica finds a voice mail message left by a student on the bus moments before the crash and confirms, after her father hears it, that there's a sound before the bus hits the rail that could be an explosion. Keith opts not to go public with the message, giving it to Lamb instead.  Music  The following songs can be heard in the episode: *\\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\\" by The Temptations (sung by actor Percy Daggs III) *\\"Press Record Then Play\\" by Lake Holiday *\\"No Sleep Tonight\\" by The Faders *\\"Whatever It Takes\\" by The Faders  Production  Percy Daggs III, who plays Wallace Fennel, does not appear after this episode until \\"One Angry Veronica\\". The character of Weevil (Francis Capra) does not appear in \\"Blast from the Past,\\" despite being credited. The episode features a cameo appearance by Mandy (Claire Titelman), who previously guest-starred in the first-season episode \\"Hot Dogs\\". \\"Blast from the Past\\" also marks the last episode for several months for series regulars Percy Daggs III (who plays Wallace Fennel) and Tessa Thompson (who portrays Jackie Cook). Daggs would not appear until \\"One Angry Veronica\\", while Thompson would not appear until \\"Rashard and Wallace Go to White Castle\\". The episode was written by Phil Klemmer and Cathy Belben and directed by Harry Winer, marking Klemmer's sixth writing credit, Belben's first writing credit, and Winer's second directing credit (after \\"Meet John Smith\\"). As a joke, the character of Jackie can be seen TiVoing the TV series Cupid, a show that was created by Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas. In addition, another show on Jackie's TiVo list is Sunset and Vaughn, a fictional TV series within Cupid.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"Blast from the Past\\" received 3.58 million viewers, marking a sharp increase from the previous episode and serving as the series' highest rated episode overall. = Reviews = The episode received mostly positive reviews. Television Without Pity gave the episode a positive review, rating it an \\"A\\". Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave a mostly positive review, writing that \\"overall this was a good, if slightly unsatisfying episode. I think that's mostly to do with the fact that we're still early in the season so it's all just a bunch of loose ends at this point (even the case of the week ended up having no closure). Still, Veronica Mars is a much more confident, layered show than before and it's still really fun to watch.\\" Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club wrote a mixed review, saying that \\"This, dear readers is easily the single most melodramatic episode of the series so far. It's hard to say how I feel about it. If it's an indicator of how the season will continue from here on out, I expect a fascinating levee of exhaustion. If it's a way to raise the stakes early on, it's damn effective. There was a lot going on here, maybe too much for down the road, but it worked.\\"  References   External links  * *\\"Blast from the Past\\" at Mars Investigations Category:2005 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 2) episodes ","title":"Blast from the Past (Veronica Mars)"},{"id":"3931285","title":"George Cosac"},{"id":"3931287","text":"The Women's Australian Football League is a Women's Australian rules football competition in the United States of America.

Professional School of Nursing, Somerset, Pennsylvania, 2012 A pinning ceremony is a symbolic welcoming of newly graduated or soon-to-be graduated nurses into the nursing profession. The history of the ceremony dates back to the Crusades in the 12th century and Queen Victoria awarded Florence Nightingale the Royal Red Cross for her service as a military nurse during the Crimean War. By 1916, pinning ceremonies had become an established tradition in both the United Kingdom and the United States, although, by the 2010s, many nursing schools in the United States had abolished them. At pinning ceremonies, nurses are presented with nursing pins by either the faculty of their nursing school or by a person significant to them. These ceremonies also often include a candle-lighting or lamp-lighting ceremony, which commemorates Nightingale's nighttime aid to wounded soldiers by candlelight, and the reciting of the Nightingale Pledge, the International Council of Nurses Pledge, or another similar pledge. A pinning ceremony is not a graduation, as it does not signify the completion of all criteria necessary to earn a nursing degree, although it sometimes recognizes the completion of educational requirements that enable nurses to take their state licensing examinations. Historically, a nursing pin symbolizes an educated nurse who is prepared to serve society as a healthcare professional.  History  Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem, circa 1954. Head nurse Schwester Selma is second from the left. The history of nursing pins dates back to the Crusades in the 12th century. Monks initiated into the Knights Hospitaller that cared for injured and ill Crusaders were given a Maltese cross, which is considered to be the first form of a badge given for nursing. After the Crimean War, Queen Victoria awarded Florence Nightingale the Royal Red Cross for her service as a military nurse during the conflict. Nightingale later presented a somewhat similar \\"medal of excellence\\" to her outstanding nursing students. Initially, only nurses who attained exceptional grades or made remarkable contributions to practice received nursing pins, although in time pinning ceremonies came to include all nurses. The Nightingale School of Nursing at London's St Thomas' Hospital created a badge featuring a Maltese cross that it awarded to nurses who completed their studies. The first pinning ceremony in the United States occurred at New York City's Bellevue Hospital in 1880. By 1916, pinning ceremonies at which all nursing graduates were awarded pins had become an established tradition in both the United Kingdom and the United States. By the 2010s, many nursing schools in the United States had abolished their pinning ceremonies, often considering them out of date and unnecessary. Other nursing schools retain ceremonies that are entirely planned and funded by the students.  Ceremony  Nazareth College, New York, 2015 A pinning ceremony is a public event involving the family and friends of nurses being recognized. The nurses often dedicate their pins to a person who has made a significant impact on their lives. At the ceremony itself, a faculty member from the nursing school typically hands a pin to each designated significant person, who in turn places it on the nursing student who selected them. Sometimes the faculty member themselves places the pin on the nursing student. During the pinning itself, another faculty member will often read a dedication that the student has written about the person pinning them. Pinning ceremonies also generally feature an address from a nursing faculty member and a candle-lighting or lamp-lighting ceremony, which commemorates Nightingale's nighttime aid to wounded soldiers by candlelight. The candle-lighting or lamp-lighting ceremony is often accompanied by the reciting of the Nightingale Pledge, the International Council of Nurses Pledge, or a pledge specific to an individual nursing school.  Symbolism  A nursing pin from California State University, Sacramento A pinning ceremony is a symbolic welcoming of newly graduated or soon-to-be graduated nurses into the nursing profession. It sometimes recognizes the completion of educational requirements that enable nurses to take their state licensing examinations. The ceremony is not a graduation, as it does not signify the completion of all criteria necessary to earn a nursing degree. At some nursing schools, the pinning ceremony is held a few weeks before commencement. According to Linda Ketchum, a pinning ceremony is \\"recognition from the nursing faculty and acknowledgment on the part of the student, that in the students' hearts, they are ready for the role of a nurse.\\" Lenora Bodway called pinning ceremonies symbolic of \\"initiation into the brotherhood and sisterhood of nurses\\" and remarked that they are \\"often more personally meaningful than the graduation ceremony\\". Historically, a nursing pin symbolizes an educated nurse who is prepared to serve society as a healthcare professional. Typically, each nursing school designs and awards its own unique pin. For example, Bellevue Hospital's 1880 pin design includes a crane that represents vigilance, a blue band symbolizing constancy, and a red band symbolizing mercy and alleviation of suffering.

Hunter was born in New York to Greek parents, but was raised in England. She trained at RADA where she is now an associate, and regularly directs student productions. Career =Stage work= In her stage work, Hunter is particularly associated with physical theatre, having even been described as a \\"virtuoso physical performer.\\"Mark Fisher \\"Let's Get Physical\\", Scotland on Sunday, 15 August 2004 She has worked with renowned companies in that field including Shared Experience and Complicit√©. She won an Olivier Award in 1991 for playing the millionairess in Friedrich Durrenmatt's The Visit. Critics have noted Hunter's unusual physical presence and her range. Charles Spencer of The Telegraph wrote, \\"diminutive in stature, and slightly lame, she has a deep, guttural voice, eyes like black olives and the most expressive of faces. Almost nothing seems beyond her range, from farcical clowning to deepest, darkest tragedy.\\" Hunter's \\"uncommon ability to shape shift\\" has led her to play roles typically reserved for male actors. She was the first British woman to play King Lear professionally. Hunter's portrayal of Lear conscientiously challenged the audience to separate character and performer: her voice and clothing read as male, but she physicalized lines such as \\"Down from the waist they are Centaurs/Though women all above\\" to remind the audience of the female body playing the part. Another male role she played was in The Bee, directed by Hideki Noda, which played at the Soho Theatre in June 2006 and 2012. Hunter has also played animals and other creatures. In Kafka's Monkey, a solo piece based on Franz Kafka's \\"A Report to an Academy,\\" she played a monkey delivering a speech to a scientific society about its transformation from a monkey to a man. The piece was a highly acclaimed sell-out success at the Young Vic in 2009, where it was reprised in May 2011. It toured to the Baryshnikov Arts Center in New York in April 2013. According to Charles Isherwood of the New York Times, Hunter's performance had \\"wry wisdom, a touch of cheeky humor and, above all, a sense of dignity.\\" In November 2013, she co- starred as the fairy Puck in Julie Taymor's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, the show that opened the Theatre for a New Audience in Brooklyn. Ben Brantley of the New York Times described Hunter's Puck as \\"genuinely original\\" and \\"part music-hall comedian, part fairground contortionist.\\" In 2008, Hunter co-starred in the first English-language production of Fragments, a collection of short plays by Samuel Beckett, directed by Peter Brook. Of the London run at the Young Vic, Andrew Dickson of The Guardian wrote, \\"the evening belongs to Kathryn Hunter, who crams into a few minutes of stage time more than most actors achieve in a career.\\" The piece toured internationally, appearing in New York in 2011. Hunter was made an Artistic Associate at the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 2008. From January to March 2009, she debuted as an RSC director with a production of Othello at the Warwick Arts Centre, Hackney Empire, Northern Stage, Oxford Playhouse and Liverpool Playhouse. Her husband Marcello Magni was movement director on the production and appeared in it as Roderigo. Other cast members included Michael Gould as Iago, Patrice Naiambana as Othello, and Natalia Tena as Desdemona. In 2010, Hunter played Cleopatra in a production of Antony and CleopatraWhat's On In Stratford-Upon- Avon and the Fool in a production of King Lear at the Royal Shakespeare Company's Courtyard Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. The latter performance was described as \\"outstanding\\". In January 2011, she withdrew from these roles shortly before the plays were due to be revived. In February 2016, Hunter took the title role of Cyrano de Bergerac at the Southwark Playhouse, London. Guardian critic Michael Billington wrote, \\"Hunter is an astonishing shape- shifting performer who can play just about anything\\" but Telegraph critic Jane Schilling called Rusell Bolam's production \\"an opportunity squandered.\\" In 2017 she starred in the title role in The House of Bernarda Alba at the Royal Exchange, Manchester. In 2018, Hunter returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company to play the title role in Timon of Athens, directed by Simon Godwin. =TV and film= Her screen work includes a supporting role in the TV series Rome as Cleopatra's companion, Charmian, and voicing Gorn in Tron: Uprising. Notable film work includes Mike Leigh's All or Nothing (2002) and Harry Potter's neighbour, Arabella Figg, in the fifth movie of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007). A 2001 episode of Silent Witness entitled \\"Faith\\" (BBC), Hunter played the role of Sister Geraldine Catterson. Sister Geraldine expressed faith in the canonisation of a previously beatified Sister, Constance Kerr, whom, it was claimed, had miraculously cured a girl suffering symptoms of muscular dystrophy, and written years later in her diaries of experiencing repeated instances of direct communion with God \\"who pierced my heart\\". A canonised Sister Constance would open an urgently required source of income for what the diocese determined was a financially burdensome Hospice. Ultimately, Geraldine's \\"Faith\\" was trumped by Science. In 2018 she starred in the BBC Two drama Black Earth Rising as Capi Petridis, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.

Lystra Gretter and a Committee for the Farrand Training School Grace for Nurses in Detroit, Michigan, created the pledge in 1893. Gretter, inspired by the work of Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, credited the pledge to the work of her committee, but was herself considered \\"the moving spirit behind the idea\\" for the pledge. The Nightingale Pledge is a statement of the ethics and principles of the nursing profession in the United States, and it is not used outside the US. It included a vow to \\"abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous\\" and to \\"zealously seek to nurse those who are ill wherever they may be and whenever they are in need.\\" In a 1935 revision to the pledge, Gretter widened the role of the nurse by including an oath to become a \\"missioner of health\\" dedicated to the advancement of \\"human welfare\\"‚Äîan expansion of nurses' bedside focus to an approach that encompassed public health. US nurses have recited the pledge at pinning ceremonies for decades. In recent years, many US nursing schools have made changes to the original or 1935 versions, often removing the \\"loyalty to physicians\\" phrasing to promote a more independent nursing profession, with its own particular ethical standards.

Written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and directed by Kevin Bray, the episode premiered on UPN on November 9, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Abel Koontz (Christian Clemenson) returns and requests Veronica's help in finding his daughter. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) is arrested for his supposed stabbing of a biker gang member, and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) loses the Sheriff's election.  Synopsis  Veronica waits with Keith at an election party, where tensions are high due to the election being extremely close. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) is nosing ahead before a man walks up to Lamb and says that he made the anonymous call from the bridge where Felix Toombs was stabbed. Keith loses the election by a margin of 51% to 49%. After we learn that Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) has been elected mayor, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) hits on Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Officers come in and arrest Logan for the murder of Felix Toombs before Veronica goes home and finds Abel Koontz, who is in the latter stages of stomach cancer. He asks her to help him find his daughter, Amelia, who has disappeared, and Veronica agrees. Veronica talks to Amelia's old boyfriend, who has not seen her for a while; Amelia ditched the boyfriend in Europe. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) is appointed to be Logan's lawyer before Veronica asks Cliff to call the numbers on the phone cards that Amelia stole under an alias. Cliff tells Logan that he should get a different lawyer. Veronica finds out that Amelia called from Neptune (Veronica's town) the previous week. Logan is placed in a cell with his father, Aaron (Harry Hamlin), who is temporarily being held there before his trial for the murder of Lilly Kane. Logan receives bail, but Weevil and his friends are angry about this fact. Veronica breaks into Clarence Wiedman's (Christopher B. Duncan) office, but he denies any knowledge of the situation. Veronica tracks down Amelia's cousin, Margot Schnell. On the way back to the Echolls estate, Don Lamb and Logan see that Logan's house is burning. Veronica fakes being a distressed businesswoman in order to track the car that Amelia rented, which was in California about two days prior. Sheriff Lamb tells Keith about Veronica being taken in for questioning. Veronica tracks Amelia's previous location, which is in a small hotel. Keith confronts Veronica and Veronica tells him about David \\"Curly\\" Moran. Veronica notices that the signal from one of Amelia's devices is close to hers before finding Amelia dead in an ice box. Clarence Wiedman suddenly appears and says that Amelia showed up again before disappearing later. The man up front at the hotel tells Clarence and Veronica that she came in with a man, and Veronica says she knows who it is. Keith interrogates Aaron and threatens him. Veronica and Clarence go into Amelia's boyfriend's room and Clarence dangles him off a window ledge, but he knows nothing. Weevil and Logan get into a fight at school, partly because of Logan's bail and partly because Logan has just bought Weevil's grandmother's house and kicked her out. Veronica is contacted by Amelia's friend, who says that the killer is actually a man named Carlos. Clarence decides to track down Carlos, despite the fact that he is a diplomat's son. Veronica lies to Abel Koontz about Amelia's fate to spare his feelings before his death. Keith goes inside the police station evidence room to examine the remains of the bus that mysteriously went off a cliff and finds the remains of a rat.  Production  Joss Whedon had a cameo appearance in the episode. Whedon had previously expressed his admiration for the show. The episode was written by John Enbom and Phil Klemmer and directed by Kevin Bray. \\"Rat Saw God\\" marks the fifth writing credit for Enbom, Klemmer's seventh writing credit, and Bray's first and only directing credit for the series. This was one of Klemmer's favorite episodes of the show that he wrote, writing that \\"I think that scene with Clarence and Veronica getting together is just funny and cool.\\" Both writers wanted the main plot to involve Amelia DeLongpre, and Klemmer wrote the subplots. The episode also features several guest appearances; many recurring characters from the first season reappear in the episode, including Abel Koontz (Christian Clemenson), Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan), and antagonist Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin). In addition, \\"Rat Saw God\\" features the second appearance by Gia (Krysten Ritter), who had been absent since \\"Normal Is the Watchword\\". The episode also features a cameo appearance by model Kim Stolz. Stolz was awarded the role for winning a small contest while competing on the fifth cycle of America's Next Top Model. \\"Rat Saw God\\" features a cameo by television director Joss Whedon. Veronica Mars has often been compared to Whedon's series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with some even calling it the successor to the latter.

History In the later Roman Empire the church had been centrally organized: all monasteries and churches within a diocese, including their personnel and their properties, were under the jurisdiction of the local bishop. As early as the late 5th century, Pope Gelasius I listed conditions under which bishops could consecrate new churches within the metropolitan see of Rome. One of the conditions was that the new establishment be endowed with sufficient means to provide for vestments, lights, and the support of the priest serving there.Wood, Susan. The Proprietary Church in the Medieval West, Oxford University Press, 2006 Sometimes the church was part of a large estate; others were themselves vast landed estates. = Early Middle Ages = The development of proprietary churches was a product of feudalism.Coriden, James A., The Parish in Catholic Tradition, Paulist Press, 1997 The founding lord or seigneur might be a layman, bishop, or abbot, but only the diocesan bishop had the authority to consecrate the church or ordain the priest to serve there. The Council of Trosly (909) defined such churches as the dominium of the seigneur, but the gubernatio of the bishop. It was the responsibility of the bishop to ensure that the building was kept in good repair and appropriately lighted, and to determine the parochial boundaries. Addleshaw, George William Outram. The Development of the Parochial System, Borthwick Publications, 1954 Within the Carolingian empire, the rules concerning proprietary churches had been expressly formulated in the ninth century, at the reforming councils of 808, under Charlemagne and of 818/9, under Louis the Pious. Then proprietary churches had been officially recognized, but the capitulations identify some of the associated excesses, for it was agreed that the proprietor should not appoint nor depose priests without the assent of the bishop, nor appoint unfree persons. Every church was to be provided with a manse and its garden that were free of seigneurial dues, where the priest could support himself, providing spiritual services. The rights of proprietarial founders were also delimited and protected, for the bishop could not refuse to ordain a suitable candidate; the legislation also protected the founder's right over proprietary abbeys to appoint a member of the founding family.Uta-Renate Blumenthal, The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century, 1988:5. A practice developed in 8th-century Germany of donating a proprietary church to a larger church or cathedral with certain conditions, such as reserving the usufruct to a member of the family, sometimes for more than one generation. Sometimes the donation was revocable upon the possible return of a distant heir. Other conditions might preclude it as ever being awarded as a benefice, on penalty of reverting to the family. The usufruct might be reserved to a female (ancilla dei) or a male as yet unborn, let alone not yet in Holy Orders, and allowed the donor to make provision for the support of family members. A donation couched in such terms to a third party, served to provide some protection against subsequent challenges by other family members. Ulrich Stutz argued that the institution of the proprietary church existed particularly in areas that had never been Roman, among the Irish and the Slavs, and in the Eastern Roman Empire, but the proprietary church is best known in Germany, where the Grundherr, the landlord who had founded the church on his property and endowed it from his lands, maintained the right of investiture, as he was the advocatus (German Vogt) of the fief, and responsible for its security and good order. In the 9th and 10th centuries the establishment of proprietary churches in Germany swelled to their maximum. The layman who held the position was a lay abbot. The altar was the legal anchor to which the structures, the land, the rights and ties were attached. The proprietor and his heirs retained unabated legal rights to the ground on behalf of the saint whose relics lay beneath the altar. \\"He could sell, lend or lease the altar, leave it to his heirs, use it for dower, or mortgage it, provided that a church, once dedicated, continued to be used as a church.\\" However, the founder could not alienate any of the land or appurtenances designated for the maintenance of the church and support of the priest. Dedicating land for a religious use was one way to preserve it from being partitioned into parcels too small for effective economic use. According to George W.O. Addleshaw, French historians attribute the development of proprietary churches to the decentralization that ensued with the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West and the increased authority of late Roman and Merovingian landowners, who assumed responsibility for rural churches in lieu of bishops in their urban sees. = Later Middle Ages = The proprietary right could be granted away or otherwise alienated, even for a sum of money, which compromised the position of the spiritual community that it served. In a small parish church this right may be trivial, but in the German territories of Otto the Great it was an essential check and control on the church, through which the Holy Roman Emperor largely ruled. Simony, the outright purchase of an ecclesiastic position through payment or barter, was an ever-present problem, one that was attacked over and over in all the synods of the 11th- and early 12th-century Gregorian reforms, and fuelled the Investiture Controversy. The benefice system grew out of the proprietary churches. The Royal peculiars have remained proprietary churches until today. A Medieval example is the church of Littleham, Devon, mentioned in 1422.Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP40/647; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT1/H6/CP40no647/aCP40no647fronts/IMG_0172.htm; 5th & 6th entries, with Devon in the margin Lorsch Abbey An example of a proprietary church is Lorsch Abbey, founded in 764 by the Frankish Count Cancor and his widowed mother Williswinda as a church and monastery on their estate, Laurissa. They entrusted its administration to Cancor's nephew Chrodegang, Archbishop of Metz, who became its first abbot. In 766 Chrodegang resigned the office of abbot, in favour of his brother Gundeland.Roth, Leander. \\"Lorsch Abbey.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9.

Eldkvarn was a grand gristmill in central Stockholm that burned in 1878 -- an event which was known as \\"the fire of the century\\". It was located where today the Stockholm City Hall stands. The mill was built in 1805 for Abraham Niclas Edelcrantz with a steam engine built by Samuel Owen. At the time of the blaze, the fire was known as the fire of the century, because of its ferocity and the fact that it could be seen from many points of the city, dominating the skyline. It was a moment that gripped the city in horror, as citizens watched the fire rage and fill the night sky. Events Eldkvarn burning in 1878, a painting by Gustaf Carleman. The fire occurred in central Stockholm at the Eldkvarn gristmill on October 31, 1878. It was a steam-powered mill built in 1805 that made flour, something that was very important to Stockholm in the 19th century. A variety of different causes have been suggested. The most widely accepted one is that a small gas lamp fell, igniting the many bits of dust and grain on the floor, and it spread from there. As with the Great Fire of London, where a small fire expanded quickly, the fire at the mill in Stockholm started small, but was very poorly dealt with, and managed to spread throughout the factory. Unlike the Great Fire of London, though, it was contained to the area in and around the factory, meaning it did not spread to other parts of Stockholm. However, it was large enough and powerful enough that it made a real impression on the people of the city. Dagens Nyheter, one of the most popular newspapers in Sweden, wrote extensively about the fire and noted that ‚Äòin view of the fierce outbreaks of the fire and the fierce widening of the fire, the entire capital and its immediate surroundings were illuminated as through a magic wand‚Äô. The newspaper also commented on how the city became gripped by the fire, noting that ‚Äòthe most varied rumours were about the origin of the fire and the most incredible stories were raised‚Äô. Despite the fire being so large, they managed to save part of the mill and, perhaps most amazingly, it stayed open until 1906. See also * Historical fires of Stockholm Source * Erik Lindorm (1936).

Process drama in school settings usually involves the whole class working with the teacher in role in a made-up scenario. When they are working in process drama, the students and teachers work together to create an imaginary dramatic world within which issues are considered and problems can be solved. In this world they work together to explore problems and issues such as, \\"How do communities deal with change?\\", \\"How do we accept other people into our community?\\" or themes such as environmental sustainability, betrayal, truth and other ethical and moral issues. Sometimes the work may begin as light- hearted, but the teacher always layers more dramatic tension and complexity into the work as the teacher is aiming for a pedagogical outcome. Students learn to think beyond their own points of view and consider multiple perspectives on a topic through playing different roles. For instance, if the issue being discussed is logging a forest, they may play the loggers, people who live in the forest community and environmentalists. Playing a range of positions encourages them to be able to recast themselves as the \\"other\\" and to consider life from that viewpoint, thereby creating complexity and enabling us to explore multiple dimensions of the topic. Process drama does what the character Atticus Finch advocates: the ability to work for social justice comes from the ability to understand another perspective‚Äîto be able to try on someone else's shoes and walk around in them for a while. Process drama allows us to \\"try on\\" other people's shoes, to walk the paths they tread and to see how the world looks from their point of view. Process drama is also suggested as a tool to promote literacy development through opportunities for dramatic play in early childhood settings within which children speak for a range of purposes in role.Sun, Ping-Yun.

Bengt Holbek This 660 page book details a method for use in the analysis of fairy tales and applies it to the tales found in the repertoires of five Danish peasants collected by Evald Tang Kristensen in the mid 19th century. In brief, Holbek posits that fairy tales can be broken down into five \\"moves\\" which work to reconcile the three main tensions which are addressed by the fairy tale. These tensions are those between \\"youths\\" and \\"adults\\", those of \\"low status\\" and those of \\"high status\\", and \\"male\\" and \\"female\\". The relationships between these are frequently represented on a cube. Imagine a cube, place youth on the left, adulthood on the right, low status on the bottom, high status on the top, male on the front and female on the back. It is Holbek's estimation that one of the most important things that distinguish the fairy tale from the more general category of folktale is the fact that the tale ends with a marriage. By his definition, if the tale one is considering does not involve a marriage, it is not a fairy tale. At the beginning of a fairy tale, the protagonist, who can be either male or female, generally starts out as an unmarried youth of low status. This person generally becomes involved with an unmarried youth of high status and must undergo trials in order to prove their worth, thereby attaining high status so as to be worthy of their lover. Here the characters move from the bottom of the cube to the top of it. Over the course of the tale, the characters also cease to act as children and pass from the sphere of youth to the sphere of adulthood. The characters move from the left half of the cube to the right. The tension between male and female is negotiated at the end by the marriage between the protagonist and their lover, rendering the space between the front and back of the cube irrelevant. Holbek's moves can be described as follows: *In move two, the Low Young for the purposes of this example let us say Male (LYM) leaves home in order to make his way in the world, thereby becoming a Low Adult Male (LAM). *In move three, the LAM meets the High Young Female (HYF) and they share some sort of illicit love. *Move one, if it occurs, tends to occur in flashback form during move three. Move one generally involves the HYF explaining how she came to be imprisoned in whatever situation the LAM saved her from. Move one occurs first in the chronology of the tale, even if it does not occur first in the sequence of events as they are narrated. Holbek acknowledged the awkwardness of this, but decided against doing anything about it. *Move four, if it occurs, is generally an intensification of move three. For example, the lovers are separated again and must undergo trials in order to reunite and regain the status they enjoyed at the end of move three. *Move five involves the LAM being compensated for what he has done, allowing him to become a High Adult Male (HAM) and the couple is married, allowing the HYF to attain adult status and become a HAF, and also allowing negotiation of the tension between the genders.

Her mother soon found out, stole her away, and both fled from the House of Ahn- hyeon, her uncle‚Äôs home, in Gyeongsang but was caught in 1579 and was prosecuted by her uncle. Her mother‚Äôs trial was overseen by province official Choi Gyeong-hwi of the Haeju Choi clan (Hangul: ÏµúÍ≤ΩÌöå, Hanja: Â¥îÊÖ∂ÊúÉ), who ruled on behalf of her innocence.

In 1593, Japanese forces invaded the Korean peninsula in the Imjin war, during which Official Choi, Nongae's husband, was assassinated in June. Afterwards, the Japanese eventually succeeded in their invasion of Suyeong Fortress (now near Jinju area). To celebrate the victory, soldiers forced all the kisaeng, female entertainers, to serve them at the Choseokru Pavilion on a cliff that overlooked the Nam River. Nongae was called to entertain the victorious Japanese generals alongside the other kisaeng. Nongae stood on the steep rock under Choseokru which caused all Japanese soldiers not daring to cross until the general came forward to her challenge. When the general met to her face to face, she smiled when he tried to lure her down from the rock, and eventually led the general Keyamura Rokusuke (ÊØõË∞∑ÊùëÂÖ≠Âä©) to the cliffside, where she embraced him, clasped her fingers with rings that locked her around him, and cast herself along with the general into the river, killing them both.

In 1739, during the 16th year of King Yeongjo, another Gyeongsangwoo soldier, Nam Deok-ha (Hangul: ÎÇ®ÎçïÌïò, Hanja: ÂçóÂæ∑Â§è), built Uigisa, a shrine dedicated to the patriotism of Nongae, next to Chokseokru in Jinju. In 1846, Jong Joo-seok (Hangul: Ï§ëÏ£ºÏÑù) of Jangsu Hyeongam built a memorial to honor the integrity of Nongae. It was designated as Local Monument No. 46 in 1955, and the birthplace of Nongae has been restored in Juchon Village, Daegok-ri, Janggye-myeon, Jangsu-gun, where Nongae was born. The rock from which she leapt has come to be known as Uiam (Hangul: ÏùòÏïî, Hanja: Áæ©Â∑ñ), \\"the Rock of Righteousness.\\" During the mid 20th century, it was rumored that Nongae was a daughter and heir from a fallen yangban family, not known as a Gwangi, and was eventually promoted to be the Jeongsil (Ï†ïÏã§ Î∂ÄÏù∏), wife, of Choi after he died.

Maktoob.com was known for being the first Arabic/English email service provider. In 2009, Yahoo! acquired Maktoob.com, thus turning Maktoob into Yahoo!'s official arm in the MENA region. History =Early days= Maktoob was founded in 1999 by Samih Toukan and Hussam Khoury who were able to introduce a webmail service with Arabic support for emails when no other free email service had such support. They also helped users who did not have Arabic keyboard or browsers that support Arabic to send and receive emails by using a virtual keyboard which was done in Java, and using Java applets that had better Arabic support. The initial flourish of Maktoob and its large user base led the company to create several services and content channels for Arab users, many of which were not found previously in Arabic format. Chatting, Greeting Cards, and simple content channels were upon the first to be developed internally. Since then, Maktoob diversified its services through both acquisitions and internal development to have close to 40 different channels and services. The success of the Maktoob portal drove the company to start new online businesses. cashU was founded to address the issue of electronic payments in the region, Souq.com as an auctions and marketplace; Tahadi.com was founded to provide the best MMO/MMORPG games for the Middle East internet users, Araby.com an Arabic Search engine; Maktoob Research a successful online research service founded by Tamara Deprez; and Sukar.com the first and biggest online private shopping club in the Middle East, founded by Saygin Yalcin. =Abraaj Capital acquisition= In June 2005, the UAE-based private equity house Abraaj Capital purchased 40% of the company shares in a USD 5.2 million buyout deal. The rationale for such an acquisition (according to Abraaj's website) is that Maktoob has a large user base (claimed to be more than 4 million) and, according to marketing literature, \\"a dominant online payment option cashU and a strong brand name. It has established the first Arab online auction site souq.com which will benefit from leveraging the large community network.\\" In April 2006, Maktoob acquired 80% of popular Arab sports website Sport4ever.com. In December 2007, Abraaj sold its share to Tiger Global Management with an internal rate of return of 75%.Albawaba.com =Yahoo!= In 2009, Maktoob was sold to Yahoo! for $164 million. In January 2011, email users were migrated from the @maktoob.com domain to the @yahoo.com domain. In January 2015, Yahoo! let go half of its staff in Dubai, and it announced in December 2015 the closure of its office in Dubai, its last office in the MENA region. The Yahoo! acquisition of Maktoob remains one of the biggest acquisitions in the region, and a success story for other entrepreneurs. Yahoo!'s money made it possible for Souq.com to develop and reach a $1 billion valuation. Activity Yahoo! Maktoob provides the following online services: News (Yahoo! Maktoob News), sports news (Yahoo! Maktoob Sport), a blogging platform (Yahoo! Maktoob Blog), a social network (Yahoo! Maktoob As7ab Maktoob), a bilingual online research community (Yahoo!

It is one of the key nodes of the Milan suburban railway service as the southern gate of the Milanese urban network. History =Early history= The station's location was originally (as of 1891) a junction for the old cargo station of Milano Sempione; it became a cargo station itself in 1908. Its function was to serve as the cargo station for the then-autonomous town of Rogoredo, today included in the city administration as part of Milan's southeastern border with San Donato Milanese. Next, in the late 1950s, it was expanded to a passenger station. This step came when the city of Milan started to grow faster and various factories were established in the area, such as the Montedison chemical facility and the Redaelli steel plant. The station grew proportionally with the industrial development of the area. =Recent history= A modernization of the station was planned in the 1990s, and some reconstruction of the station was carried out including platform roofing. However, in 1995 work was stopped due to costs exceeding the budgeted funds. In 1999, work restarted to add four tracks to allow integration with the Passante railway and the high-speed line, as well as to complete the platform roofing. The importance of this station has increased with the extension of the Milan suburban railway service to Pavia and Lodi, and the new residential district called Santa Giulia. The station is fully operational. The station includes a stop for the Regionale trains from Parma to the Milano Centrale station, and it became possible in August 2009 to change to the S-lines for connections through the Passante into Central Milan and on to Malpensa Airport at Bovisa. Several Eurostar Italia trains between Milan and Rome stop in Rogoredo. In 2011, the Eurostar Italia-rival Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori started a high-speed-service running from Torino Porta Susa to Salerno, stopping at Rogoredo as well as at the Porta Garibaldi station. Since 3 September 2012 a FrecciaClub has been added in place of the waiting room, which does not exist anymore.

The movement attracted national appeal, and many gave up their tobacco in order to help repay the national debt. Women, including the kisaeng Aengmu, took a leading role in raising funds. The Japanese Government expected for the movement to subside. However, the movement later attracted the interest of the Japanese forces, who regarded it as a dangerous expression of Korean nationalism and sought to stifle and discredit it.

Biography He was the only son of Louis II, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken and his wife Elisabeth of Hesse, daughter of William I, Landgrave of Hesse. His father died in 1532, so the regency of Palatinate- Zweibr√ºcken passed to Louis' younger brother Rupert until 1543. In 1557 Wolfgang received the territory of Palatinate-Neuburg in accordance with the Contract of Heidelberg. In 1548 the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V occupied his Protestant territories and reintroduced Catholic practices. This imposition ended in 1552. The Peace of Augsburg of 1555 ended the religious conflict, and in 1557 several ecclesiastical states in Germany were secularised, a few of which Wolfgang obtained. In 1566 he served as a cavalry officer in the Turkish Wars. In 1569 he came to the aid of French Huguenots with 14,000 mercenaries during the \\"Third War\\" of the French Wars of Religion (his intervention was financed by Queen Elizabeth I of England). He invaded Burgundy, but was killed in the conflict. He was buried in Meisenheim. Succession After his death Wolfgang's land was split among his five sons who then created three branches: Philip Louis (House of Palatinate-Neuburg), John (House of Palatinate- Zweibr√ºcken) and Charles (House of Palatinate-Birkenfeld). Otto Henry and Frederick had no surviving sons. The House of Palatinate-Neuburg inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate in 1685 and by its cadet branch Palatinate- Sulzbach also Bavaria in 1777. The House of Palatinate-Birkenfeld then inherited the Electorate of the Palatinate and Bavaria in 1799. The House of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken contributed to the monarchy in Sweden from 1654 onwards through its cadet branch Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken-Kleeburg. Family and children He was married in 1545 to Anna of Hesse, daughter of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse.

He was the head football coach at Oregon State University from 1980 to 1984, compiling a record of 6‚Äì47‚Äì2. Avezzano was later an assistant coach with the Dallas Cowboys and Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). Playing career Avezzano graduated from Jackson High School in Miami, in 1961.\\"Miami News\\" ‚Äì Avezzano will be all football December 3, 1979 ‚Äì p.C1 He played college football at Florida State University, where he was a center. He was drafted and played professionally in the American Football League for the Boston Patriots in 1966. Avezzano wore #50 and played in three regular season games for the Patriots during the 1966 AFL season. He was also on the 1967 preseason roster of the Pittsburgh Steelers, wearing #50. Coaching career Avezzano began his coaching career at Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio, and then coached at Florida State, his alma mater, in 1968 and at Iowa State University from 1969 to 1972 under head coach Johnny Majors. He followed Majors to the University of Pittsburgh, where he was offensive line coach from 1973 to 1976, helping the 1976 Panthers to the national championship. Avezzano went with Majors to the University of Tennessee in 1977, where he was the offensive coordinator for three seasons. =Oregon State= In December 1979, Avezanno was hired as a head coach for the first time at Oregon State University in the Pacific-10 Conference.

At the time it was the worst accident on the British railway system. A train ran into the back of another inside the tunnel, killing 23 and injuring 176 passengers. Three north-bound trains left Brighton station within a few minutes of one another. At the southern entrance to Clayton Tunnel an automatic signal failed to return to danger after the first train passed, allowing the second train to follow it into the tunnel. The signaller at the south end of the tunnel belatedly waved a red flag in an attempt to stop the second train, but thought that it had not been seen. However the driver of the second train had briefly glimpsed the flag and stopped his train inside the tunnel. The signaller then misinterpreted a 'line clear' telegraph message from the signal box at the north end of the tunnel as referring to the second train instead of the first, and signalled the third train into the tunnel. Circumstances In his cabin close to the southern entrance of the tunnel, signalman Henry Killick was in charge of a signal linked to an alarm bell, and a needle telegraph. He controlled the signal using a wheel in the cabin, and the signal would normally be at \\"danger\\" unless he set it to \\"clear\\" to allow a train to enter the tunnel. When a train had passed it, the signal was designed to return automatically to \\"danger\\", but if it did not, the alarm bell would ring. The needle telegraph was linked to a signal box at the northern entrance of the tunnel. When the signalman in the southern box pressed and held down a switch, it gave a \\"train in tunnel\\" indication to the signalman in the northern box. Otherwise, the needle on the telegraph would hang vertically. Except for the Clayton Tunnel, the line was worked on the time-interval system, which required trains on the same track to be separated by five minutes. Despite that, the three trains left Brighton within the space of seven minutes: *Portsmouth Excursion left at 8.28 am *Brighton Excursion left at 8.31 am *Brighton to Victoria left at 8.35 am At the southern entrance of the Clayton Tunnel, the first train passed the signal at \\"clear\\", but the alarm bell rang to warn Killick that the signal had not returned to \\"danger\\". He sent a \\"train in tunnel\\" message to Brown in the north cabin, but did not return his signal to \\"danger\\" in time to stop the second train from passing it and entering the tunnel. It was only three minutes behind the first, so it was possible that it would catch up with the train ahead. Because the first train was still in the tunnel, Killick rushed out of the cabin, waving his red flag to stop the second train just as it was passing. However, he could not be sure that the driver had seen his flag. He telegraphed Brown at the northern mouth of the tunnel: \\"Is tunnel clear?\\" At that moment, the first train left the tunnel, so Brown signalled back to Killick: \\"Tunnel clear\\". Tragically, Killick thought that Brown was referring to the second train and not the first. In fact, the driver of the second train had seen the red flag. He stopped his train about half a mile (800m) into the tunnel and began reversing back to the south end. Meanwhile, Killick saw the third train approaching, which stopped at his signal. Thinking that the tunnel was clear, he waved his white flag to allow it to proceed. The second and third trains collided in the tunnel with great force. The second train was pushed forward, and the locomotive of the third train destroyed the guard's van of the second train before smashing into its last carriage. The locomotive of the third train rode up over the carriage roof and smashed its chimney against the tunnel roof before stopping. Many of the 23 deaths were in that last carriage, in which passengers were burnt or scalded to death by the shattered engine. The bodies of a number of the victims were stored temporarily in the cellar of The Hassocks Hotel. A nine- day inquest into the deaths of the 23 victims was held at Brighton town hall. It concluded with the jury finding that Charles Legg, the assistant stationmaster of Brighton station, was guilty of manslaughter, because of his negligence in starting three trains so close together, against the rules of the company. The jury did not find any negligence by either signalmen Killick or Brown. Legg was committed to trial for manslaughter, but found not guilty. Causes The catastrophe publicised the problem of trains travelling too close together, with signalmen having to appraise the situation too quickly for safety's sake. A simple communication mistake between the two signal boxes caused havoc that Sunday, but the telegraph was also blamed for the tragedy because it did not register without continual pressure on the switch. The signal, too, was also at fault for not returning to \\"danger\\" immediately after the train had passed. The accident encouraged the use of the block system (rather than the time interval system) for the remainder of the railway system. One other aspect of this accident was that Signalman Killick was working a continuous 24-hour shift that day, rather than the regulation 18 hours to gain a complete day off duty. In his report on the accident Captain Tyler stated that \\"it was disgraceful that a man in so responsible a position as Signalman Killick should be compelled to work for twenty-four hours at a stretch in order to earn one day of rest a week.\\" Charles Dickens may have partly based his story \\"The Signal-Man\\" on this accident, dramatising the events (especially the bells and the telegraph needle), as well as adding other incidents. His own experience at the Staplehurst rail crash may have inspired him to write this ghost story. Readers of the story in December 1866 would likely have still remembered the Clayton accident.

Belonging from Karachi, his columns regularly appeared in the country's oldest English newspaper, Dawn. He was also the Chairman of the Cowasjee Group and was engaged in philanthropic activities in addition to being regarded as an old \\"guardian\\" of the city of Karachi. On 3 November 2013, Institute of Business Administration, Karachi launched the Ardeshir Cowasjee Centre for Writing in his honor.  Biography  Cowasjee was born on 13 April 1926 in Karachi to the well-known Cowasjee Parsi (Zoroastrian) family. His father, Rustom Fakirjee Cowasjee, was a businessman in merchant shipping, and the family spoke Gujarati at home. Ardeshir attended the Bai Virbaiji Soparivala (BVS) Parsi High School and graduated from DJ Science College, Karachi. Later, he joined his father's business, the Cowasjee Group. In 1953, he married Nancy Dinshaw, with whom he had two children ‚Äì Ava (daughter) and Rustom (son).  Career  Cowasjee owned a family run shipping company, that at the time of the independence of Pakistan was Karachi's largest shipping company. This shipping company was nationalized during Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's premiership. He was appointed by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as Managing Director of Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) in 1973. He was jailed for 72 days in 1976 by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for which no explanation has been given to date; it is said that Prime Minister Bhutto did this because Cowasjee was becoming increasingly vocal about Bhutto's authoritarian ways. Cowasjee subsequently started writing letters to the editor of Dawn newspaper, which led to him becoming a permanent columnist. Since then, his hard-hitting and well-researched columns in Dawn have continuously exposed corruption, nepotism, and incompetence in different local, provincial, and national governments. Cowasjee's last article for Dawn was published on 25 December 2011. Los Angeles Times described him thus: \\"His is a stubborn non-Muslim voice in this nation created as an Islamic homeland, refusing to be silenced. Attempts have been made. His life has been threatened so often the government has provided him with 24-hour protection.  Activities  Via the Cowasjee Foundation, Cowasjee was the financier of many scholarships for students wishing to pursue higher education. These included grants for both local and overseas education. They were termed \\"loans\\" and Cowasjee encouraged recipients to repay them so that others could benefit from the funds; however, he expected that the majority of the funds would not be repaid.  Death  Cowasjee died at the age of 86, on 24 November 2012. He was suffering from chest illness and remained in hospital for twelve days.

The gateway has a physical and a logical address.  Logical gateway address  The gateway operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI Model. The gateway is used when transmitting packets. When packets are sent over a network, the destination IP address is examined. If the destination IP is outside of the network, then the packet goes to the gateway for transmission outside of the network. The gateway is on the same network as end devices. The gateway address must have the same subnet mask as host devices. Each host on the network uses the same gateway. The gateway should have a static address, as changing the address would cause packets not to be delivered. The gateway is typically assigned either the highest or lowest network address. This is not a requirement, but many organizations use a consistent addressing scheme to facilitate network planning.  Physical gateway address  The gateway also operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI network model. The physical gateway address is called the media access control(MAC) address or burned in address (BIA). The physical address is assigned when the device is manufactured, and cannot be changed. When a frame is sent to a device not on the local network, the gateway‚Äôs MAC address is used in the frame header. The gateway address must be configured on each host. The network host IP interface binds the gateway address to the MAC address of the physical gateway by broadcasting IP datagrams and caching the MAC address of the reply from the gateway in an ARP table stored on the host. The gateway address may be added manually. On Windows computers, the gateway address is configured using the TCP/IP Properties. The gateway address can be automatically determined using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). DHCP allows a host to obtain network information from a server.

KKnD, or Krush, Kill 'n' Destroy is a series of post-apocalyptic real-time strategy games by Beam Software. KKnD was released in 1997, while a sequel - KKND2: Krossfire was released in 1998. KKnD Xtreme, an expanded version of the original, featuring extra missions and enhancements, was released in 1997, and later re-released on GOG.com in 2012. All games in the series feature a campaign for each of the different factions in each game, alongside multiplayer capabilities. Games in the series *KKnD (1997) *KKnD Xtreme (1997) *KKnD 2: Krossfire (1998) *KKnD: Infiltrator (1999, spin-off, cancelled) Story The year 2079 AD saw the realisation of Mankind's ultimate nightmare: an all-out nuclear war exterminates a quarter of the world's population almost instantly. Infrastructure collapses as mutagenic viruses infect humans and animals alike. Most of the survivors of the attack (aptly named the Survivors) live underground. Those who don't are mutated by the viruses and nuclear fallout (what they call the Evolved). 2141 sees the underground dwellers breaking through to the surface, after living underground for decades. Soon enough, the \\"Evolved\\" and \\"Survivors\\" meet. The Evolved and the Survivors do battle until the Survivors are surrounded at their underground HQ. The battle ends in a stalemate and both the Evolved and the Survivors retreat to recoup their losses for the next 40 years. The Survivors return underground, re-evaluate their strategy and try to determine why they were nearly wiped out by the \\"freakers\\". Over time, they regroup and build new, superior weaponry in their determination to win the war for the surface. The Evolved retreat far into the wastelands and in turn wonder why they suffered such a loss against the \\"symmetrics\\". The Evolved council decree that use of pre-war technology had angered their gods, who denied them their victory as punishment. As a result, the Evolved shun pre-war machines and begin to utilise mutated animals in combat. As the decades pass, a third faction arises: Series 9, agricultural robots who have developed self-awareness and begun to construct their own unique weapons of war. After the war of 2079, the Series 9 agriculture robots realized their reason for existence was wiped out along with the withered crops. In time, partially malfunctioning due to the nuclear exchange, they begin to cultivate a deep-seated hate towards all humans. Series 9 focus first on the destruction of Series 5, 6, 7 and 8, Series 1-4 having already been wiped out in 2079. When Series 9 subsequently moved to attack the Survivors and the Evolved during their initial conflict, they quickly discovered that the organics possessed far greater weaponry in comparison to their agricultural tools. While the war for the surface raged on and then fell silent for 40 years, Series 9 developed their own weaponry in silence, in preparation for the next bout of hostilities. In the end, the Survivors emerge victorious. Overtime, nature returns to the Earth and the survivors rebuilds their world far better than their old world. Gameplay The gameplay in the KKnD series is similar to that of other real-time strategy games, such as Command & Conquer and StarCraft, created by Westwood and Blizzard respectively. The player uses resources to manufacture buildings which can create units and vehicles, which are used to exterminate opposing forces. Like the Z series of games, KKnD is tongue-in-cheek, not taking itself too seriously.

He previously served as foreign affairs editor at the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten. As culture editor of the same newspaper, he was principally responsible for the September 2005 publication of the cartoons that initiated the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy early the next year, and since then he has been an international advocate of the freedom of speech.  Life  Rose grew up in Copenhagen. He was one of three children. His father left the family when Rose was a small boy, and they were out of touch for decades. After the cartoon crisis, his father wrote him a letter suggesting that they meet and expressing his agreement with Rose's position on the cartoons. As a result, they met and reconciled. Rose graduated with a degree in Russian language and literature from University of Copenhagen. From 1980 to 1996 he was the Moscow correspondent for the newspaper Berlingske Tidende. Between 1996 and 1999 he was that newspaper's correspondent in Washington, D.C. In 1999 he became Moscow correspondent for Jyllands-Posten and in April 2004 was named its cultural editor, replacing Sven Bedsted. Since 2010, he has been the paper's foreign affairs editor. In November 2015, Rose announced that he was leaving Jyllands-Posten.  Cartoon controversy  Rose is best known for commissioning a group of drawings of Muhammad that were published in Jyllands- Posten on 30 September 2005. His reasoning was that many European creative artists had engaged in self-censorship out of fear of Muslim violence. The immediate trigger for the commission was the case of the Danish children's book author K√•re Bluitgen, who reportedly couldn't find an illustrator for a book about the life of Muhammad. Jyllands-Posten invited Danish illustrators to depict Muhammad \\"as you see him.\\" Not all of the cartoons submitted in response to his invitation featured images of Muhammed. Two of them caricatured Bluitgen, one mocked Jyllands-Posten itself, while others caricatured Danish politicians. The most famous of the cartoons, by Kurt Westergaard, depicted Muhammad with a bomb in his turban. In February 2006, Rose wrote an essay for the Washington Post entitled \\"Why I Published Those Cartoons.\\" He noted that Kurt Westergaard had previously drawn outrageous cartoons of Jesus and the Star of David, neither of which had led to \\"embassy burnings or death threats\\". Rose asked: \\"Has Jyllands-Posten insulted and disrespected Islam?...When I visit a mosque, I show my respect by taking off my shoes. I follow the customs, just as I do in a church, synagogue or other holy place. But if a believer demands that I, as a nonbeliever, observe his taboos in the public domain, he is not asking for my respect, but for my submission. And that is incompatible with a secular democracy.\\" As for avoiding offense, Rose stated: \\"I am offended by things in the paper every day: transcripts of speeches by Osama bin Laden, photos from Abu Ghraib, people insisting that Israel should be erased from the face of the Earth, people saying the Holocaust never happened. But that does not mean that I would refrain from printing them as long as they fell within the limits of the law and of the newspaper's ethical code‚Ä¶.As a former correspondent in the Soviet Union, I am sensitive about calls for censorship on the grounds of insult. This is a popular trick of totalitarian movements: Label any critique or call for debate as an insult and punish the offenders‚Ä¶.The lesson from the Cold War is: If you give in to totalitarian impulses once, new demands follow. The West prevailed in the Cold War because we stood by our fundamental values and did not appease totalitarian tyrants.\\" = After the cartoon incident = After the cartoon crisis, Rose traveled around the U.S. and interviewed such figures as Francis Fukuyama, Bill Kristol, Richard Perle, and Bernard Lewis for the New York Times and Jyllands-Posten. The interviews later appeared in Rose's book Amerikanske stemmer (American Voices). Rose has continued to write and be interviewed extensively about the cartoons and the issues raised by the controversy. He said in a 2007 interview that \\"publication of the cartoons definitely raised the level of consciousness about self-censorship.\\" Although some observers have denied that he achieved his goal with the cartoons because there was supposedly \\"more self-censorship\\" than before, Rose maintained that what had increased was not self-censorship but awareness of it: \\"before the cartoon controversy, there were many instances of self-censorship that went unnoticed.\\" Prior to the publishing of the cartoons, he noted, the Tate gallery in London had removed a torn-up copy of the Koran from an exhibition in order to avoid offending Muslims. \\"There was no public reaction to this; there was no talk about self-censorship although it was an obvious case.\\" After the cartoon case, by contrast, the proposed cancellation for similar reasons of a Berlin production of Idomeneo caused \\"a tremendous public outcry and outrage.\\" Rose argued in the interview that \\"it is discriminatory toward Muslims to say that we should not make fun of their religion when we are making fun of everybody else's religion‚Ä¶.I'd like to think that in some sense, the cartoons were an act of inclusion because we were not asking more or less of Muslims but exactly the same as of everybody else. Danish Muslims should be treated as adults, not as a weak minority needing special treatment like small children.\\" He also expressed surprise \\"that more European newspapers republished the cartoons than those in the United States.\\" Unlike the major U.S. dailies, several major European papers reprinted them. \\"There are two narratives here: There are those who say that the controversy was about self- censorship‚Äîabout denying a religious group special treatment in the public domain. That is my narrative. Then, you have another narrative saying: This was not about free speech or self-censorship; it was about a powerful newspaper insulting a minority. This was a fair argument until the moment when the threats were issued. The twelve cartoonists and I received death threats; newspapers were closed in Russia and in Malaysia, and newspaper editors were jailed in Jordan and Yemen. At that point, it became an issue exclusively about free speech.\\" Europeans, Rose suggested in the interview, do not know how to deal with Islam because of its \\"strangeness\\" to them and because of their own \\"self-hatred stemming from our colonial past and things like that.\\" Even though Europeans \\"have been criticizing, challenging, and ridiculing Christianity for decades if not centuries,\\" they \\"do not do the same with Islam because we have lost our sense of religiosity and are afraid of insulting or being accused of insulting a minority. In my mind, this is not a question of insult but of equal treatment.\\" He said that people now showed \\"a lot more understanding of my position than a year ago.\\" In an October 2007 interview with the American libertarian magazine Reason, Rose stated that \\"the left is in a deep crisis in Europe because of their lack of willingness to confront the racist ideology of Islamism. They somehow view the Koran as a new version of Das Kapital and are willing to ignore everything else, as long of they continue to see the Muslims of Europe as a new proletariat.\\" He explained that his \\"behavior during the 'cartoon crisis'‚Ä¶ was very much informed by my experience with Soviet Union because I saw the same kind of behavior both inside the Soviet Union and those dealing with the Soviet Union in the West.\\" In a February 2008 interview with Der Spiegel, Rose said that \\"on a global level people who are in favor of free speech have to unite in order to get rid of all kinds of laws around the world that limit the right to free speech ‚Äì blasphemy laws, laws protecting dictators, laws which are being used to silence people who are critical.\\" He added that Denmark's \\"debate about integration and about fundamental values in our democracy is far more fact- based than it used to be. The cartoons didn't create a new reality, but they revealed a reality. That reality was already there, but not everybody was willing to see it. Now this reality has become clear and we can discuss the real problems based on facts instead of some abstract thinking.\\" = Plot against Westergaard and afterward = In February 2008, in response to a plot to kill Kurt Westergaard, 17 Danish newspapers reprinted his cartoon of Muhammed with the bomb in his turban. \\"My colleagues at Jyllands-Posten and I understand that the cartoon may be offensive to some people,\\" wrote Rose in the Wall Street Journal, \\"but sometimes the truth can be very offensive.\\" He quoted George Orwell: \\"If liberty means anything, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.\\" He also stated that \\"the plot to kill Mr. Westergaard is‚Ä¶part of a broader trend that risks undermining free speech in Europe and around the world.\\" There is \\"a global battle for the right to free speech,\\" he maintained, and although legal systems differ, \\"the justifications for censorship and self-censorship are similar in different parts of the world: Religious feelings and taboos need to be treated with a kind of sensibility and respect that other feelings and ideas cannot command.\\" Rose rejected this special treatment, noting that during the Cold War \\"people like Vaclav Havel, Lech Walesa, Andrei Sakharov\\" had insisted that \\"It is not cultures, religions or political systems that enjoy rights. Human beings enjoy rights, and certain principles like the ones embedded in the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights are universal.\\" Rose also rejected the \\"misplaced sensitivity\\" that \\"is being used by tyrants and fanatics to justify murder and silence criticism,\\" and deplored the West's \\"lack of clarity on these issues,\\" which led some people to argue \\"that Salman Rushdie, Theo van Gogh, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Taslima Nasreen and Kurt Westergaard bear a certain amount of responsibility for their fate. They don't understand that by doing so they tacitly endorse attacks on dissenting voices in parts of the world where no one can protect them.\\" In March 2009, Rose spoke in Oslo, and described the Norwegian debate on free speech as \\"politically correct,\\" less \\"open, direct, and coarse\\" than in Denmark. Because many Norwegian commentators cherish the idea of their country as a peacemaker, he argued, they hold back to avoid creating unpleasantness. In April 2009, Rose spoke at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Rose said that Islam expert Bernard Lewis had told him that the cartoon crisis marked \\"the first time Muslims [had tried] to impose Islamic law on non-Muslim countries.\\" He also said, \\"There's a problem with Muslims in Europe and it must be dealt with ‚Äì but limiting freedom of expression is not the solution.\\" He further commented: \\"There are those who viewed the cartoons that I published as a form of incitement, but I don't think a statement should be measured by the response it yields, especially if the response is irrational and stupid.\\" He also stated that \\"There was a time after the crisis that I had to take extra precautions, but that is in the past. I never felt threatened ‚Äì or that I have to be silent.\\" = Tavshedens Tyranni = In 2011, five years to the day after the cartoons were first published in Jyllands- Posten, they were republished in Denmark in Rose's book Tavshedens Tyranni (Tyranny of Silence). The Norwegian publisher that bought the rights to the book described it as \\"a 500-page collection of essays about free speech and its boundaries.\\" A reviewer in the Norwegian magazine Minerva commented that \\"one cannot help being extremely impressed by the way he has handled the pressure.\\" His main point, wrote the reviewer, is that \\"in a liberal democracy no individual or group can demand special treatment in the free exchange of words.\\" For Rose, \\"freedom of speech is not a Western value, but a global value.\\" When Rose's book was about to come out, Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen met with 17 ambassadors from Muslim countries in an effort to prevent a new cartoon crisis. = Holocaust cartoons = On 8 February 2006, Flemming Rose said in interviews with CNN and TV 2 that Jyllands-Posten planned to reprint satirical cartoons depicting the Holocaust that the Iranian newspaper Hamshahri planned to publish. He told CNN \\"My newspaper is trying to establish a contact with that Iranian newspaper Hamshahri, and we would run the cartoons the same day as they publish them\\". Later that day the paper's editor-in-chief said that Jyllands-Posten under no circumstances would publish the Holocaust cartoons and Flemming Rose later said that \\"he had made a mistake\\". The next day Carsten Juste, the editor-in-chief of Jyllands-Posten, stated that Flemming Rose was on indefinite leave because he needed time off. After some months Rose returned to Jyllands-Posten. = Al-Qaeda hit list = In 2013, Flemming Rose was added to a hit list in Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's Inspire magazine, along with cartoonist St√©phane \\"Charb\\" Charbonnier, Lars Vilks and three Jyllands-Posten staff members: Kurt Westergaard, Carsten Juste. In 2015, over 12 people were murdered in attacks on Charlie Hebdo in Paris. After the attack, Al-Qaeda called for more killings. = Invitation to speak withdrawn by the University of Cape Town, South Africa = The Academic Freedom Committee of the University of Cape Town in South Africa invited Flemming Rose in March 2015 to speak at its 2016 TB Davie Memorial Lecture on academic freedom, scheduled to be held during August 2016. This invitation was withdrawn by the Vice Chancellor, Max Price, during July 2016 over fears that the lecture may \\"spark conflict on campus, create security risks and retard rather than advance academic freedom at the university.\\"  Works  * Mod str√∏mmen (Against the Stream), in Russian by Boris Yeltsin (translated by Flemming Rose to Danish), Sch√∏nberg 1990. * Katastrofen der udeblev (The Disaster that did not Happen), Gyldendal, 1998. * Velf√¶rdsstaten tur/retur ‚Äì efter socialdemokratismens sammenbrud (The Rise and Fall of the Welfare-state ‚Äì after the Collapse of Social-Democracy), Gyldendal, 2005 (Editor) * Amerikanske stemmer, Jyllands-Postens Forlag, 2006. * Tavshedens Tyranni (Tyranny of Silence), 2010 = Translations = Rose has translated several books from Russian into Danish, including Den s√∏rgmodige detektiv (Viktor Astafyev, 1987); B√∏rn af Arbat (Anatoly Rybakov, 1987); parts of Perestrojka, nyt√¶nkning i russisk politik (Mikhail Gorbachev, 1987); 3 x tak til kammerat Stalin: min barndom og ungdom i Rusland 1936‚Äì54 (Anmartin Broide, 1988); and Mod str√∏mmen (Boris Yeltsin, 1990).

As with many foods, this was originally a way to preserve the food so that it could be eaten months later. Pickled eggs have since become a favourite among many as a snack or hors d'≈ìuvre popular in pubs, bars and taverns, and around the world in places where beer is served. After the eggs are hard boiled, the shell is removed and they are submerged in a solution of vinegar, salt, spices, and other seasonings. Recipes vary from the traditional brine solution for pickles, to other solutions, which can impart a sweet or spicy taste. The final taste is largely determined by the pickling solution. The eggs are left in this solution from one day to several months. Prolonged exposure to the pickling solution may result in a rubbery texture. A common practice is to puncture the egg with a toothpick to allow the pickling solution to penetrate to the egg's interior, but this is dangerous as it can introduce clostridium into the finished product. Eggs prepared with this method have sometimes had high enough levels of botulinum toxin to cause illness in a human. A variant historically associated with the Pennsylvania Dutch is the pickled beet egg where whole beets, onions, vinegar, sugar, salt, cloves, and (optionally) a cinnamon stick are used as the brine. The eggs take on a pink or even purple colour from the beets and have a sweet and sour taste. Pickled red-beet eggs, long a common food at picnics and pot-lucks in the Pennsylvania Dutch country, have diffused into the folk cuisine of the surrounding \\"English\\" and become a popular snack that can be bought in supermarkets as far east as the Delaware River. Pickled eggs may be served as part of a main course, hors d'≈ìuvres, or garnishes. A typical British recipe for pickled eggs includes eggs, vinegar, salt and sugar. The eggs are then boiled, peeled, then boiled with the other ingredients. They last for three to four months (for best quality) and are traditionally found in British public housesTom Cutler, 211 Things a Bright Boy Can Do, and fish and chip shops.

He was the only new Liberal Democrat MSP to win a seat in this election. After the resignation of the Scottish Liberal Democrats's leader Tavish Scott, Willie Rennie stood in the resulting leadership election. He was the only candidate to be nominated, and was declared elected when the nominations closed on 17 May. He vowed to stand up to the \\"SNP bulldozer\\" majority, and refused to distance his party from the UK Liberal Democrats. In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the Liberal Democrats again elected five MSPs, while gaining two constituency seats and holding their existing two with increased majorities. Rennie was elected in North East Fife, gaining it from the SNP with a 9.5% swing. =Home Rule commission plan= In September 2011, Willie Rennie announced plans for a commission building on the work of 2006 Lord Steel Commission to develop a blueprint for Home Rule and full fiscal federalism that would map out further devolution of powers after the Scotland Bill 2011 was passed into statute. =Armed Forces Legal Action= Willie Rennie was appointed as an honorary patron of Armed Forces Legal Action (AFLA) in April 2014.

It was covered by the Blues Brothers on their debut album, Briefcase Full of Blues, among many other artists, as well as being featured in the 1973 film Mean Streets. Songwriting \\"Rubber Biscuit\\" started life as Kinrod Johnson's answer to the marching rhythms of the Warwick School For Delinquent Teenagers while he was an intern there. Label credit for writing and composing the song was given to Chips lead singer Charles Johnson and Adam R. Levy. But Levy's father, label owner Morris Levy, was notorious for adding either his or his son's names to songwriting credits in order to claim partial, or in some cases full, author-composer royalties on songs they did not write. There is no evidence that Morris Levy or Adam Levy ever wrote any songs. Lyrics Few of the lyrics can actually be understood, as they are sung in the scat manner. The scat is interrupted every few bars for short one-liners, most of which are implicit references to the singer's poverty and meager diet resulting from such: a \\"wish sandwich\\" (where one has two slices of bread and wishes for meat in between them), a \\"ricochet biscuit\\" (which is supposed to bounce off the wall and into one's mouth, and when it does not, \\"you go hungry\\"), a \\"cold-water sandwich\\" (or a \\"cool-water sandwich\\") which refers to consuming watermelon, and a \\"Sunday-go-to-meeting- bun,\\" which is a reference to taking a little lady to church as Elwood explains in a live version of the performance. The song closes with the question, \\"What do you want for nothing‚Äîa rubber biscuit?\\". Personnel The Chips were teenage friends in New York: Charles Johnson (lead vocal), Nathaniel Epps (baritone), Paul Fulton (bass), Sammy Strain and Shedrick Lincoln (tenors).

With more than 25,000 students, it is one of the largest high school districts in the state. The district operates eight comprehensive high schools, one online high school, one continuation high school, one community day school, and one adult education school. History The union high school district began in 1882 when George and William Chaffey, the founders of Ontario, began the Chaffey College of Agriculture and an on- campus secondary school with assistance from the University of Southern California. Ironically, the university abandoned the agricultural school while Chaffey was away in Australia, so he pursued litigation and eventually won.The settlement fee was used to establish a scholarship trust fund now administered by volunteers. The scholarship trust fund awards 18 scholarships annually to students in the district. In 1901 control of the secondary school was given to the local community and it was named Ontario High School, only to be renamed Chaffey High School in 1911. It would be the only secondary school in the area until end of World War II when an increase in Ontario's population prompted additional schools. Upland High School, Montclair High School, Alta Loma High School, and Ontario High School were built between 1955 and 1967. Another school did not open until Etiwanda High School in 1987. Upland High School left the district and became part of the Upland Unified School District in 1991. Shortly after, Rancho Cucamonga High School opened in 1992. Funds from Measure X, a $128 million General Obligation Bond, allowed the district to build additional schools. Colony High School and Los Osos High School opened in the fall of 2002. The district enrolls students who desire a high school education but cannot speak English at Newcomer School for one year in order to learn enough English to complete the high school curriculum, graduate and continue their education. In 2012, voters within the district passed an $848 million bond issue‚Äîthe largest investment in classrooms, facilities and technology in the district's more than 100-year history. More than 60 percent of voters supported the measure. On September 10, 2013, ground was broken on the first significant project to be paid for under the bond, a two-story classroom annex at Ontario High School. In recent years the district has entered into formal agreements with California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, California State University, San Bernardino, and California State University, Bakersfield to guarantee admission to Chaffey District students who meet minimum requirements for admission. On April 21, 2014, Chaffey Superintendent Mathew Holton was honored as Superintendent of the Year by the Association of California School Administrators Region 12. The school year in the Chaffey Joint Union High School District begins in August and ends in May before the Memorial Day holiday, with the first semester ending in mid- December before the winter break. Starting with the Class of 2017, all eight comprehensive high schools hold their annual graduation ceremonies at the football fields located in each of the campuses. Board of Trustees members are elected to a four-year term, by geographical district starting with the November 2018 elections. =High schools= *Alta Loma High School in Rancho Cucamonga *Chaffey High School in Ontario *Colony High School in Ontario *Etiwanda High School in Rancho Cucamonga *Los Osos High School in Rancho Cucamonga *Montclair High School in Montclair *Ontario High School in Ontario *Rancho Cucamonga High School in Rancho Cucamonga =Continuation High Schools= *Valley View High School in Ontario =Community day schools= *Chaffey Adult School in Ontario =Online high schools= *Chaffey District Online High School in Ontario =Alternative education= *Newcomer School Districts served The Chaffey School District draws from the following seven elementary school districts: * Alta Loma School District in Rancho Cucamonga * Central School District in Rancho Cucamonga * Cucamonga School District in Rancho Cucamonga * Etiwanda School District in Etiwanda * Mountain View School District in Ontario * Mt Baldy School District in Mount Baldy * Ontario-Montclair School District in Ontario Notable alumni *Gerald Alexander, former Boise State safety, five-year NFL veteran *Hobie Alter, surfing and sailing entrepreneur *Jeff Ayres (formerly Jeff Pendergraph), NBA player for the San Antonio Spurs and former Arizona State playerCBS Interactive: \\"Jeff Pendergraph Arizona State Bio\\" * Carlos Bocanegra (graduated 1997), professional soccer player and former USMNT captain *Omar Bolden, NFL player *Richard Brehaut, UCLA quarterback *Vincent Brown, wide receiver for the San Diego Chargers *Jim Brulte, California Assemblyperson * Charles Castronovo (graduated 1993), tenor and opera singer * Patrick Chung, former All-American safety for the Oregon Ducks, now plays for the New England Patriots * Kenyon Coleman (graduated 1997), NFL football player * Darren Collison, NBA player for the Los Angeles Clippers, former UCLA player, New Orleans Hornets and Indiana Pacers player * William De Los Santos, screenwriter and movie director * Bob Doll, professional basketball player * Stewart Donaldson, author, psychologist, evaluation research scientist * Cameron Dunn (graduated 2001), professional soccer player for Los Angeles Blues * Maurice Edu, professional soccer player, Rangers F.C., and regular on US Men's National Team;

The battle was the last set-piece battle of the war, although it was still to last another two years. It was also the last time that the Boers' four 155 mm Creusot Long Tom guns were used in the same battle. Before Hostilities commenced in October 1899. On the Cape front the British forces broke through in February 1900 and the next month they were in Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange Free State. Pretoria, the capital of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (ZAR) was captured in June 1900. The government of the ZAR and a few Boer commandos fled eastwards along the railway line to Louren√ßo Marques (now Maputo). They were pursued by General Pole Carew and his 11th Infantry Division (7500 officers and men) and a cavalry division commanded by Lieutenant-General French. Major Jackson map showing the farms on which the Boers were deployed Prior to the Battle of Diamond Hill on 11 June 1900, General Botha sent a few officers ahead to Belfast to select and prepare ramparts and emplacements for the next battle.Viljoen, Ben J.,My Reminiscences of the Anglo Boer War, Kindle edition, loc. 1294. The terrain at Belfast was such that it was the only place where the Boers could present a wide enough front to resist the enemy's superior force.Reichman, C & Slocum, S.L'H, Boer War Operations in South Africa 1899‚Äì1902, Washington 1901 & Scripta Africana, 1987, p. 226. The Boer forces were deployed as follows: North of the railway line, in a semi-circle around the town of Belfast, the Lydenburg commando was to be found on the farms Spitskop, Zuikerboschkop and Langkloof.Amery, L.S.(editor), The Times History of the War in South Africa, volume IV, p. 440 and map. Breytenbach J.H., Die Geskiedenis van die Tweede Vryheidsoorlog in Suid-Afrika, volume VI, p. 318 A Long Tom was placed on the farm Spitskop.Goldman C.S., With General French and the Cavalry in South Africa, MacMillan & Co. Ltd, 1902, p. 343. These burghers' task was to prevent the English from taking the back road to Dullstroom. The commandos from Middelburg and Johannesburg were on the farm Steynsplaats, just east of the main road to Dullstroom. Their task was to enfilade the enemy with cross-fire, should they decide to take the main road to Dullstroom and Lydenburg.Amery, supra, p. 440 Another Long Tom was placed behind these commandos on the farm Waterval. Still on the northern side of the railway line, but close to it, was the Krugersdorp commando.Amery, supra, p. 441. Next to them, but on the southern side of the railway line was a detachment of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Rijdende Politie (ZARPs), who were to bear the brunt of the British attack. The burghers from Germiston were next to them. South of the railway line the upper reaches of the Komati River flow from north to south giving rise to a number of hills and dales. One such hill formed a large plateau and was called Gelukplato, because it was on the farm Geluk. The rest of Botha's force was ensconced on this plateau. The Heidelberg commando was on the farm Geluk, while the Bethal commando built their sconces on the farm Frischgewaagd,Amery, supra, p.441. They were supported by the third Long Tom on Driekop.25¬∞48.187'S, 30¬∞10.366'E [WGS84] The fourth Long Tom was initially mounted on a railway truck. After 6 August, when Sir Redvers Buller started to advance towards Belfast, this gun was moved to position close to Elandskop.25¬∞46.214'S, 30¬∞12.829'E (WGS84) From there they could bomb Groblers Bridge, should Buller decide to advance via there to Machadodorp.Reichmann et al., supra, p. 231. Colonel French in full dress uniform, 1892. Pole-Carew reached Middelburg in July 1900 and started assembling the XIth Infantry Division. French and his cavalry advanced to Wonderfontein. On the Natal front General Sir Redvers Buller broke through in February 1900, but was then stopped. It was only on 6 August 1900 that he could start his advance towards Belfast. His task force consisted of the 4th Infantry Division commanded by Lieutenant-General N.G. Lyttelton, with Brigadier-General F.W. Kitchener of the 7th Brigade and Major-General Howard of the 8th Brigade. Buller's mounted troops consisted of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, commanded by Major-General J.F. Brocklehurst and 3 Mounted Infantry Brigade under Earl Dundonald. Buller's force consisted of 9000 officers and men with 42 guns.Amery, supra, p. 437; Breytenbach, supra, p. 304 Buller reached the farm Twyfelaar on the Komati River on 15 August. There he got in touch with French's right flank. This enabled Buller to be supplied from Wonderfontein.Amery, supra, p. 443. Battle =21 August= General Buller advanced to the farm Van Wyk's Vley, about eight miles north of Twyfelaar. General French remained on his left flank. While advancing the last three miles, Buller's right flank came under fire from the Bethal commando on Frischgewaagd.Amery, supra, p. 444. A fight ensued and it lasted until early evening. British casualties were 36 (including 7 dead and 3 missing) and 3 Boers were wounded.Breytenbach, supra, p. 320. =22 August= Buller was peeved. He sent Major-general Walter Kitchener to teach the Bethal commando a lesson. Two battalions foot soldiers, four squadrons mounted troops and eight guns accompanied Kitchener. The Brits did not know that during the night the Carolina commando joined the burghers from Bethal. They fought all day. British casualties were two dead and five wounded. No casualties were reported on the other side.Breytenbach, supra, p. 321; Amery, supra, p. 445. =23 August= Gravestone of Liverpools on Geluk During Buller's advance, at a time when it was unclear to the Boers whether he was going to Machadodorp or Belfast, they removed the Long Tom from the railway truck and placed it near Elandskop.Amery, supra, p. 441. The remains of the emplacements was found at 25¬∞46.214'S, 30¬∞12.829'E (WGS84). When Buller advanced from Twyfelaar to Van Wyk's Vley, it was clear that he was aiming at Belfast. The Boers then moved the gun to Captain von Dalwig's camp on the farm Waaikraal.Amery, supra, p. 456; Preller, G.S. 'Die Vier Long Toms', Die Huisgenoot, 28/5/1937, pp. 14-5, 21. The remains of the emplacement can be found at 25¬∞46.225'S, 30¬∞09.079'E(WGS84). Pole-Carew and his infantry division left Middelburg and advanced to Wonderfontein. Buller, with French still on his left flank, advanced to the farm Geluk and established his headquarters in the valley near the farm house. On his eastern side was the Geluk Plateau on which the Heidelberg commando had built their sconces. He ordered the 8th Infantry Brigade, assisted by Dundonald's mounted troops and the South African Light Horse, to ascend the plateau and make it safe. On the plateau they had to face the commandos from Heidelberg and Bethal, as well as Von Dalwig's guns, including two Long Toms. Despite heavy losses, they managed to hold the edge of the plateau.Breytenbach, supra, 321-4; Amery, supra, p. 445-6 British casualties were 12 dead, 61 wounded and 33 missing. The Boers had 12 wounded, including Captain von Dalwig.Breytenbach, supra, p. 324. =24 August= 4.7 QF gun on Howitzer carriage Long Tom in action During the night of 23 August Buller's men on the western edge of the Geluk plateau dug in and made emplacements for four naval guns (two 5\\" and two 4.7\\"). The next day they exchanged fire with the Boers' two Long Toms (on Driekop and Von Dalwig's camp). The Long Toms caused six casualties in the Natal Field Force.Maurice & Grant, History of the War in South Africa, 1899‚Äì1902, Hurst & Blackett Ltd, 1908, London, volume III, p. 391 Pole-Carew's left Wonderfontein and occupied Belfast.

Die Slag van Bergendal (Dalmanutha), MA thesis, University of Pretoria, 1974, p. 84 =25 August= French's left swipe On 25 August Lord Roberts arrived in Belfast to take charge of operations. He had a conference with his generals, Pole-Carew, Buller and French. French was ordered to get rid of the Boers on their right flank on Zuikerboschkop and then swerve right to Machadodorp. Buller was ordered to turn right and advance over Dalmanutha to Machadodorp. Pole-Carew had to extend his force northwards along the main road to Dullstroom to join French at Lakenvley.Amery, supra, p. 448; Breytenbach, supra, p. 327. Fighting on this day was limited to the exchange of fire of the heavy guns. Maurice and Grant record: \\"Moreover, the enemy had by no means the better of the exchanges with the heavy guns of both divisions, one of the 6-in. Creusots near Bergendal being reduced to silence by a 5-in. shell from Pole-Carew's position\\".Maurice & Grant, supra, p. 393 =26 August= General French and his cavalry left Geluk very early and first called at Belfast. They left there at 09:00 and first proceeded west along the railway line, possibly to mislead Boer spies. When they were out of sight they swung right and unexpectedly appeared on the farm Boschpoort. The Boers and their Long Tom beat a hasty retreat, while French cleared the rest of the burghers from Zuikerboschkop and Langkloof. By 14:00 he could send a message to Pole-Carew that they could commence their march northwards. The Infantry Division experienced some cross- fire from the east and the Long Tom on Waterval fired a few shots as well.Goldman, supra, p. 344. The result of the march was that Pole-Carew was in command of all the high-lying ground between the railway line and Lakenvley.Breytenbach, supra, p327-329, Amery, supra, p. 449 Most of the Middelburg commando had simply fled.Breytenbach, supra, p. 331. Buller advanced northwards as well. His plan was to swing right on the farm Vogelstruispoort and then proceed over Waaikraal to Dalmanutha.Breytenbach, supra, p. 329 But that afternoon his scouts reported (a bit erroneously) that the Boers' right flank ended at the railway line. He therefore decided to make his breakthrough on the farm Bergendal the next day.Amery, supra, p. 450. =27 August= Map of Maurice & Grant showing protuberance Buller himself went scouting early that morning. The Boers' right flank did not actually end at the railway line, but it did swing sharply clockwise. It thus formed a salient angle.Maurice & Grant, supra, p. 396. The result was that their position on the farm Bergendal (occupied by the ZARPs) stuck out like the tip of one's nose or a protuberance. On both sides of this position the Boers' sangars were facing away from the tip, with the result that those occupying them could not assist those on the tip in the case of a frontal attack. Then there was some high ground some 3 000 yards south-west of the salient angle and that was an ideal place for the artillery he wanted to use.Pakenham(2), supra, p. 455. About 36 guns were placed on the high ground and the bombardment of the ZARPs position started at 11:00.Breytenbach, supra, p. 333 After three hours the Rifle Brigade and the Inniskilling Fusiliers charged and burst right through the Boer lines. When the fighting stopped they found that the position had been defended by the Zuid-Afrikaanse Republiek Politie (a police force). The British found 14 dead bodies and captured nineteen prisoners. The rest of the wounded were taken away by the Boers and some even survived. British casualties for the day were: Officers, 3 dead and 7 wounded; men, 100 wounded or missing and 12 dead.Pakenham(2), supra, p. 456. The Battle of Bergendal was over. British casualties were 385 and the Boers' were 78.Breytenbach, supra, p. 343.  Aftermath  As a result of this defeat, the Boer line of defence was breached and on 28 August Buller's troops marched into Machadodorp. The ZAR government, meanwhile, had decamped to Nelspruit. A few days later, on 1 September, Lord Roberts proclaimed the entire South African Republic British territory. However, the capture of Machadodorp and Roberts' proclamation did not end the war. Although the British had won the battle Botha's main force had managed to stay intact. The Boer commandos subsequently dispersed to Lydenburg and Barberton and the next phase of the war - guerrilla warfare - started. This second phase would last even longer than the first, conventional, phase and peace would eventually only be declared at the end of May 1902.  War Memorial  A memorial was erected in 1935 in memory of the twelve Zarps who died in the Battle of Berg-en-dal on 27 Augustus 1900. A much larger second memorial, in honour of all Boers, including the Zarps, who had died in the Eastern Transvaal, was unveiled on 29 Augustus 1970 and a small stone cairn was erected in memory of the 25 Officers and men of the 2nd Battalion the Rifle Brigade who died in the battle.

Although Phulkari means floral work, the designs include not only flowers but also cover motifs and geometrical shapes.The main characteristics of Phulkari embroidery are use of darn stitch on the wrong side of coarse cotton cloth with coloured silken thread. Punjabi women create innumerable alluring and interesting designs and patterns by their skilful manipulation of the darn stitch. According to Kehal (2009), a cloth where only a few flowers are embroidered is called a Phulkari. The other types are distinct varieties.Alop ho riha Punjabi Visra by Harkesh Singh Kehal Unistar Publications PVT Ltd The traditional varieties of Phulkaris are large items of cloth and include Chope, Tilpatr, Neelak and Bagh. Sometimes, the Bagh is given separate categorisation of its own as on other varieties of a Phulkari, parts of the cloth is visible, whereas in a Bagh, the embroidery covers the entire garment so that the base cloth is not visible. Further, in contemporary modern designs, simple and sparsely embroidered dupattas (long scarf), odhinis (oversized long scarf), and shawls, made for everyday use, are referred to as Phulkaris, whereas clothing items that cover the entire body, made for special and ceremonial occasions such as weddings are called Baghs (large garden). The Phulkari continues to be an integral part of Punjabi weddings to the present day. Phulkari Dupatta created for Kanya Aagman (Arrival of the Bride) at a traditional Punjabi wedding in the US, 2019.jpg The craft of Phulkari has undergone changes over the centuries. According to Pal (1960) in his seminal essay on the history and use of the Phulkari published by Patiala University, the traditional method of embroidering a Phulkari and its widespread use in Punjab, India declined by the 1950s.Rampa Pal Chapter Phulkari pp36-47 in Mohinder Singh Randhawa. (1960) Punjab: Itihas, Kala, Sahit, te Sabiachar aad.Bhasha Vibhag, Punjab, Patiala. Traditionally, women would embroider Phulkaris without using stencils. Pal (1960) states that women would clean their courtyards and invite friends and family to ceremonially begin the process of embroidering a Phulkari. Folk songs would be sung on this occasion. \\"Ih Phulkari Meri Maan Ne Kadhi/ Is Noo Ghut Ghut Japhiyan Paawan\\" (This Phulkari was embroidered by my mother, I embrace it warmly). Folk songs like these are indicative of the emotional attachment the girl had to the Phulkari embroidered by her mother or grandmother, or aunts. In the past, as soon as a girl was born, mothers and grandmothers would start embroidering Baghs and Phulkaris, which were to be given away at the time of marriage. Depending on the status of the family, the parents would give dowry of 11 to 101 Baghs and Phulkaris. Historically, the exquisite embroidery for Baghs are known to have been made in the districts of Hazara,Sukaadas (1992) Fabric Art: Heritage of India Peshawar, Sialkot, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, Multan, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ambala, Ludhiana, Nabha, Jind, Faridkot, Kapurthala and Chakwal of the Punjab region. Phulkari and Bagh embroidery has influenced the embroidery of Gujarat known as heer bharat in its use of geometrical motifs and stitchery.Naik, Shailaja D. (1996) Traditional Embroideries of India Phulkaris and Baghs were worn by women all over Punjab during marriage festivals and other joyous occasions. They were embroidered by the women for their own use and use of other family members and were not for sale in the market. Thus, it was purely a domestic art which not only satisfied their inner urge for creation but brought colour into day-to-day life. In a way, it was true folk art. Noting the value of traditional Phulkaris, Aryan (1983) collected the garments noting their spectacular artwork.Aryan, K.C.(1983) The Cultural Heritage of Punjab, 3000 B.C. to 1947 A.D. Rekha Such efforts to preserve the art of Phulkari has influenced its revival. Etymology The Punjabi term, Phulkari is made of two wors: Phul means flower and Akari means shape. Phulkari meant the shape/direction of flowers which symbolized life. In Punjab, it was popularly believed that the birth of girl child in the family was auspicious. The mother and grandmothers would start embroidering Phulkari dupattas upon her birth because they believed that she would be the creator for future generations. Originally Phulkari was done with real flowers. Silk and Mulmul (soft cotton muslin) fabrics were used because of their purity and longevity. It was believed that the virtue and character of a woman gave shape to the Phulkari.  Origin  Silk embroidery floss (Patt), Rajpura Punjab (India), 2015 There are different theories about the origin of Phulkari. One such belief is that this embroidery was prevalent in different parts of the country as far back as the 7th century CE but survived only in Punjab. Motifs similar to the ones found in Phulkari are also found in Kashida of Bihar and some of the embroideries of Rajasthan. Another thought is that this style of embroidery came from Iran where it was called Gulkari, also meaning floral work.Kaur, Rajinder and Gupta, Ola (2014) Phulkari and Bagh folk art of Punjab: a study of changing designs from traditional to contemporary time However, Pal (1960) notes that the styles of Phulkari are distinct to Gulkari work. There is reference to Phulkari in ancient texts, folk legends, and literature of Punjab. In Harishcharitra, the biography of the Emperor Harshavardhana (590-647 CE), the last ruler of great ancient Indian Vardhana empire, the seventh-century chronicler Bana wrote, \\"Some people were embroidering flowers and leaves on the cloth from the reverse side,\\" which is a technical description of Phulkari embroidery.However, the earliest reference to the word Phulkari is in Punjabi literature in the 18th century Waris Shah's version of Heer Ranjha (a legendary Punjabi tragic romance) which describes the wedding trousseau of the female protagonist Heer and lists various clothing items with Phulkari embroidery. The first extensive English publication on Phulkari was by Flora Annie Steel in 1880 where she describes the various styles and exhibited the varieties in picture form.MeliaBelli Bose (editor) (2017) Women, Gender and Art in Asia, c. 1500-1900. Routledge In its present form, Phulkari embroidery has been popular since the 15th century. Pal (1960) believes that no matter its origin, Phulkari work is distinctive and uniquely Punjabi. Phulkari was essentially a product of domestic work done by the women of the household. The fabric on which Phulkari embroidery was done was hand spun khaddar (a handloomed plain-weave cotton fabric). Cotton was grown throughout Punjab plains and after a series of simple processes it was spun into yarn by the women on the charkha (spinning wheel). After making the yarn it was dyed by the lalari (dyer) and woven by the jullaha (weaver).271x271pxTraditionally, use of coarse khaddar fabric made it easy to count the yarn. The base khaddar cloth used in Western Punjab was finer than what was used in Central Punjab. The fabric was woven in widths, which were narrow, as the width of the loom was such. Thus, the fabric had to be stitched lengthwise to make the desired width, which was later embroidered. This practice of stitching two pieces was common among textiles of Punjab in the early 20th century. In West Punjab (now in Pakistan), two or three pieces of cloth were first folded and joined together, leading to distorted designs. In East Punjab (now Punjab, Haryana, and part of Himachal Pradesh), they were joined together first and then embroidered. Women artisans embroidering with Patt in Rajpura, Punjab (India), 2015 The hallmark of Phulkari is, making innumerable patterns by using long and short darn stitches. There were no pattern books and embroidery was worked entirely from the reverse of the fabric. The designs were not traced. Techniques and patterns were not documented but transmitted from word of mouth and each regional group was identified with the style of embroidery or design The embroidery is done with floss silk thread. Soft untwisted silk floss called patt, was used for embroidery. The thread came from Kashmir, Afghanistan, and Bengal and was dyed in the big cities by the lalaris. The best quality silk came from China. The village ladies obtained the thread from hawkers or peddlers who went from village to village selling daily needs items. The most favoured colour was red and its shades, because red is considered auspicious by both Hindus and Sikhs of Punjab.S. S. Hitkari (1980) Phulkari: The Folk Art of Punjab. Phulkari publications Madder brown, rust red, or indigo were the usual background colours for a base for the embroideries. White was used in Bagh by elderly ladies and widows. Black and blue were less preferred in Western Punjab, whereas white was less commonly used in East Punjab. Geometrical patterns are usually embroidered on the Phulkaris. Phulkari depicted scenes from everyday life in the villages. Animals and birds represented success, beauty, pride, and goodwill and different fruits symbolized wealth, prosperity, and fertility. Wheat and barley stalks with ears were also common motifs. No religious subjects or darbar (Sikh temple hall) scenes were embroidered. The decorated end of a scarf or shawl, the pallu, has separate panels of exquisite Phulkari workmanship with striking designs. Despite the fact that this embroidery was not originally done on a commercial scale, some of it did find a market abroad in the 19th century. The embroideries for shawls or ghagras (a long full decorated skirt) were used to make curtains for European homes. Specimens of Phulkari cloth from different regions of Punjab were sent to Colonial and Indian Exhibition, held under the British regime. By the end of the 19th century, Phulkaris and Baghs had found a market in Europe and America. There were firms in Amritsar where Phulkari work of any shape or size could be ordered. Some of the firms procured orders from Europe for supplying Phulkari on a commercial scale. The newer market dictated the changes in designs and color combinations. Some commented that the Europeanized versions of Phulkari were not Indian at all. The embroideries were in black, green, and red and the stitches of embroidery were an inch in length. Types Pal (1960) describes the following traditional varieties of Phulkari: Bagh, Chope, Subhar, Sainchi, Tilpatra, Neelal, Ghungat bagh and chammas. He also describes the materials used, colours and stitching techniques. The traditional cloth would be khaddar using hand-spun cotton. The cotton would be weaved professionally to create a heavy material. Lighter versions called halvaan were also used. Pal noted that khaddi material was also becoming popular. The colours were red, white, golden yellow green and deep blue. Natural methods would be used to dye the material w such as utilising flowers. A popular method was to use the Rubia cordifolia tree known as Indian madder and Majith in Punjabi. Unspun silk thread known as Patt would be used to embroider the designs using the double stitch known in Punjabi as dasuti tropa, herringbone stitch and satin stitch. Long and short stitches would be employed. No stencil would be used to embroider the designs. Women would gather to embroider Phulkaris. Traditional folk songs would be sung by the group. Pal also gives one instance of a woman putting one grain of wheat to one side for every stitch she made. When the Phulkari was complete, the lady donated the grains away. Sometimes, different styles can be seen on one Phulkari. This is because each girl would use her own imagination to stitch a design, perhaps to remind the girl when she gets married of her friends who helped stitch the Phulkari. Thind (2005) mentions another variety: the bawan bagh where more than one bagh style is used on one cloth. Many of the varieties are part of museum exhibitions and private collections. Thind makes reference to the contributions made by Mohinder Singh Randhawa in promoting the preservation of Phulkari art. He also mentions private collections where he has seen various motifs including the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) embroidered in a Phulkari.Thind, Karnail Singh (2005) Punjab Da Lok Virsa (Part 2) Patiala University Bagh Bagh is a style wherein the entire surface was embroidered. By working with darning stitch numerous designs were made by use of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal stitches. There were many kinds of Bagh depending on its usage like Ghungat (Veil) Bagh and Vari da Bagh. In many cases the designs were inspired by what the embroiderer saw around them. The kitchen provided the designs of many Baghs ‚Äî Belan (rolling pin) Bagh, Mirchi (Chilli) Bagh, Gobhi (Cauliflower) Bagh, Karela (Bitter Gourd) Bagh, and Dabbi (metal container) Bagh. Others like Dilli Darwaza, Shalimar Char, and Chaurasia Baghs depicted the layout of well-known Mughal Gardens. The scattered work on the fabric is called \\"Adha Bagh\\" (half garden). The work done with white or yellow silk floss on cotton khaddar that starts from the center of the fabric and spreads to the whole fabric is called \\"Chashm-e-Bulbul\\".left Chope and Subhar The two styles of chope and subhar are worn by brides. The chope is embroidered on both sides of the cloth. Chope traditionally is embroidered on red with yellow. Two fabric panels are joined that have similar patterns embroidered on both ends. The only motifs embroidered on both selvage are a series of triangles with the base towards the selvage and pointing inwards. The design is worked with small squares in a step-ladder fashion. Only the borders and the four edges of the cloth are embroidered in fine embroidery. The Subhar has a central motif and four motifs on the corners.Naik, Shailaja D. (1996) Traditional Embroideries of India Darshan Dwar Darshan Dwar is a type of Phulkari which was made as an offering or bhet (presentation). It has panelled architectural design. The pillars and the top of the gate are filled with latticed geometrical patterns. Sometimes human beings are also shown standing at the gate. Sainchi 220x220px This is the only style where the outlines of the figures are drawn using black ink. It is then filled by embroidering with darn stitch. In other styles, there are no patterns drawn and the work was done only by counting the threads from the back. Sainchi was popular in Bathinda and Faridkot districts. (2014) Kaur, Rajinder and Gupta, Ila (2014) Phulkari and Bagh folk art of Punjab: a study of changing designs from traditional to contemporary time. Researchgate Sainchi phulkari was also popular in and around Ferozepur. Sainchi embroidery draws inspiration from village life and depict various scenes of everyday village life such as a man ploughing, lying on a charpai (jute cot), playing chaupar (a cross and circle board game), smoking hookah, or guests drinking sharbat (sweet cordial). Common themes also include women performing chores like churning milk, grinding wheat flour on the chakki (hand mill), and working on the charkha (spinning wheel). Women also embroidered scenes which they found interesting, such as a British official coming to a village or women carrying an umbrella and walking along with memsahib (the wife of a British official). Birds, trains, circuses as well as scenes from popular Punjabi legends like Sohni Mahiwal and Sassi-Punnun were often depicted The style also incorporates jewellery designs of bracelets, earrings, rings and necklaces. Pal (1960) believes that such designs did no form part of the traditional method of embroidering Phulkaris but expressed a woman's wish to have such items of jewellery. Tilpatra The til (sesame) patra has decorative embroidery which is spread out as if spreading sesame seeds. The term tilpatra means \\"the spreading of seeds\\". Neelak Neelak Phulkari is made of a black or red background with yellow or bright red embroidery. The color of the phulkari is mixed with metals. Ghunghat bagh Originating in Rawalpindi, the ghunghat bagh is heavily embroidered around the centre on the edge to be worn over the head. The embroidered centre is then pulled over the face so as to form an embroidered veil. Chhamaas The Chhaamas phulkari hails from Rohtak, Gurgaon, Hissar, and Delhi. The Chaamas Phulkari incorporates mirrors which are sewn into the cloth with yellow, grey, or blue thread. Phulkari of South and Southwestern Punjab region South and southwestern Punjab region includes the south Punjab, India, south and south west of Punjab, Pakistan. The phulkari of south and southwestern Punjab region, has wide edges upon which designs of animals and birds are embroidered. As is the case of the chope, the edges are embroidered on both sides of the cloth. Revival and Exhibitions 330x330pxleft Traditionally, phulkari garments were part of a girl's wedding trousseau. Its motifs were expressive of her emotions and the number of phulkari pieces defined the status of the family. The Phulkari has faced difficult times. 52 different types of Phulkari existed at one point in time. They have now been reduced to less than a handful. In olden days, women could embroider without the use of the tracing blocks. Most contemporary embroiderers can no longer do so and use tracing blocks. According to handloom and handicraft traditions expert Jasleen Dhamija, \\"The embroidery form became more or less extinct. Nobody promoted these.\\" Step-motherly treatment from the Indian fashion industry has also been partially blamed for its decline.Woman artisan in Rajpura, Punjab (India) embroidering Phulkari using a tracing, 2015 Pal (1960) after describing the varieties of Phulkari and the methods used to create them, went onto state that despite there being a reduction in the art for the last 50 years in undivided Punjab, girls and women still continued to embroider Phulkaris in the then Punjab comprising modern Punjab, India, Haryana and parts of Himachal Pradesh to at least the 1950s. In villages far away from the cities, Phulkaris such as the Chope were still given to brides hailing from traditional families. However, he noted a marked loss of interest in the craft as a whole. Phulkaris could be seen hanging on walls using nails, being placed on the ground when religious figures attended villages, being used in the fields to collect crops and being used as rags. Phulkaris were being sold at cheap rates to collectors from overseas who would then sell them at higher rates. Women would give away lighter Phulkaris to servants. Pal believed that the Punjab is a progressive state of India but it did not value its traditional crafts. Renewed interest has only resulted from the refugee crisis after the 1947 partition whereby organisations encouraged women to embroider Phulkaris to make ends meet. Thind (2005) believes that it is Pal's chapter that triggered a serious interest in preserving the dying tradition of Phulkari. People began to take note of the folk art. Thind also noted private collectors preserving traditional Phulkaris. In his visit to the U.K. in 1980, Thind saw a private collection of Phulkaris with various motifs. He also mentions work by local organisations in Punjab (India). Various books have also been written on the subject either wholly dedicated to the subject or in chapters. The renewed interest can be seen in girls and women wearing Phulkari scarfs and carrying Phulkari bags. However, the new method of embroidering Phulkaris is distinct from the traditional method. Phulkaris are now embroidered using machines and modern materials. In 2011, after a five-year-long legal case, Phulkari was awarded the geographical indication (GI) status in India, which means that after that only registered traders and manufacturers, from the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan would be able to use the term for the traditional craft, and the patent information centre (PIC) of Punjab State Council for Science and Technology would issue a logo or hologram to distinguish the product. Over the years, the Indian and Punjab governments have been working towards promotion of Phulkari embroidery, by organizing special training programs, fairs, and exhibitions. Since most of the women artisans creating Phulkari are in the unorganized sector or work through middlemen, they do not make much money compared to an actual selling price of their product. To overcome this, Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) formed women self-help groups and cooperatives to sell directly and make more profits. Their products retail at PHULKARI- Punjab Government Emporiums in New Delhi, Chandigarh, Patiala, Kolktata, and Amritsar. The Patiala Handicraft Workshop Cooperative Industrial Society Ltd (Society for Rural Women Empowerment) founded a Phulkari cluster in 1997. 880 Phulkari artisans are now part of the cluster and over 10,000 women have been trained in Phulkari embroidery. left There are several non- profits in Punjab that promote Phulkari to empower women by providing a source of livelihood. The Nabha Foundation launched the Phulkari Traditional Craft Program in 2007 to \\"empower the marginalized rural woman, generate sustainable home based employment.\\" The Phulkari Makers of Bassi Pathana is a financially independent self-group which evolved from the vocational training initiatives at Mehar Baba Charitable Trust in 2009. Artisan markets like Dilli Haat in New Delhi feature stalls by India several National Award winners like Mrs. Lajwanti Devi from Patiala who was awarded the Rashtrapati Award in 1995 for her embroidery. Phulkari products can also be found at occasional bazaars at Dastkar, at Diwali melas, at the Lota Shop at the National Crafts Museum in New Delhi, the Punjab Handloom Emporium in Ludhiana, and in some private chains like 1469. Garg (2017) in her study of the prevalence of the Phulkari craft in Punjab (India) notes that there are various units set up in Patiala district where mainly women reported that they have been carrying on the work set up by their mothers and grandmothers. The respondents also stated that Phulkari work was particularly carried out after the arrival of refugees in Patiala after 1947 from West Punjab.Garg, Veenu (2017) Transition of phulkari traditional folk art of Punjab and its revival through artistic and expressive compromises. Jiwaji University. Shodhganga Some modern fashion designers are incorporating this embroidery into their designs, and its use has spread beyond traditional salwar kameez and dupatta to accessories like jackets, handbags, cushion covers, table-mats, shoes, slipper, juttis, and children's clothes. Phulkaris are now sold online on popular retail and fashion websites and apps and can be found in the homes of Punjabis as well as Indian handloom aficionados. Kaur and Gupta (2016) state that the traditional khaddar material has now been replaced by fine materials such as chiffon and silk for the base. The traditional Pat thread has been replaced by synthetic silk thread. All types of dark and light colours are used. This revival can be used to design the interiors of buildings such as Phulkari style curtains or Phulkari work on lamps to enhance the use of Phulkari.

Springer In Pakistan, Madan and Phul (2016) noted that the Phulkari work of the Punjab was revived in Hazara (of undivided Punjab but now in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) on the initiative of an NGO. However, the Phulkaris produced on a commercial level are not of the same quality as the traditional craft. But the revival has helped poor rural families.Madan, Arwaha, and Phul, Savitribhai (2016) Chapter 17 Innovation and Craft revival in Exploring the Benefits of Creativity in Education, Media, and the Arts.IGI Global The art was revived in the village of Noorpur near Hazara by one woman learning Phulkari from an older lady 20km away and then introducing the skill to other women.Dr. Shabnam Bahar Malik (201)) From Silk to Synthetic Phulkari: The Long Journey of a Period Textile.International Journal of Humanities and Social Science Vol. 1 No. 16; November 2011 265: The biggest challenge to hand-embroidered Phulkaris today is that the market is flooded with relatively inexpensive machine made Phulkaris manufactured in factories in Amritsar and Ludhiana. As consumers become less discerning and as there is improvisation and innovation in machine embroidery, even stalls at Dilli Haat have begun retailing machine made Phulkaris on synthetic fabrics along with high quality hand embroidered Phulkaris. Phulkari embroidery is a painstaking and time-consuming art that strains the eyes, and, as many women work indoors with poor lighting, it leads to the deterioration of their eyesight over time. Relatively low remunerations have made it an economically unviable option for many young women who do not want to take it up as a means of livelihood. There are limited books on Phulkari available online or in bookstores for purchase. The library at Punjabi University, Patiala has extensive reading material on Phulkaris. Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) acquired a collection of selected phulkari for its archives in 1994. The Textile Gallery at the National Crafts Museum has a very extensive collection of Phulkaris. The Philadelphia Museum of Art has a permanent exhibition featuring Phulkaris from the museum's Jill and Sheldon Bonovitz Collection and contemporary designs by Bollywood celebrity designer Manish Malhotra. Phulkari and chowk poorana floor art In the Punjab, temporary art using flour is drawn on the floor for ceremonial or decorative purposes. The art is known as chowk poorana. According to Bedi (2001), sometimes chowk poorana is drawn in Punjabi courtyards using flour and colours. The designs drawn are the motifs embroidered on phulkaris. Green is used for the branches and leaves, and white, red and yellow is used for the flowers.Bedi, Wanjara Singh (2001)Wa·πáajƒÅrƒÅ Bedƒ´ dƒ´ ƒÅtama kathƒÅ. Arasi Publications Such chowk is called the phulkari chowk. Bedi states that there are different types of chowk but the starting point is a square made with flour. However, any design can be made within the square such as circles or triangular shapes. Dots are drawn using red sindoor (vermilion).

His character and skill with the shears earned him a reputation as the greatest shearer of the first half of the twentieth century. Life Deucem was born of the Muruwari Aboriginal tribe in Bourke, New South Wales, in 1896. He sheared throughout New South Wales and southern Queensland between 1912 and 1947. Deucem had five children: Bill, Val, Shirley, Larry and Gordon. All of his boys became shearers, taught by their father. The nickname Deucem was coined in 1912 with the (successful) declaration that he would \\"deuce [out- shear] all the back-bent, bagbooted jumbuck barbers\\" at the Dunlop shearing shed at Darling. Deucem spent the latter years of his life in Victoria and continued to use the nickname \\"Deucem\\" until his death. He was interred at the Sprinvale Botanical Cemetery under the \\"full\\" name William Deucem Smith on 20 January 1949. Deucem is survived by around 200 relatives living in and around Canberra, plus those around Bourke and Brewarrina NSWMaggi at Biles Family Group Shearing He spent much of his professional life working the shearing sheds around Top Naas, Lanyon, Tuggeranong and Uriarra. Deucem's shearing feats include: * consistently high tallies at a time when the difficult-to- shear Vermont Merino was introduced, * shearing 290 stud merino two-tooth hoggets in a single day in 1936 at Mirrool Park, near Griffith, and * shearing 1430 sheep in one week with a broken right thumb. Deucem's shearing prowess is touted in the essay Champion Shearers of Australia (D'Arcy Niland, February 1943): > Rated as one of the greatest shearers in the world, who time out of number > has eclipsed records and cleaned up the best of his natural competitors... > Smith is regarded as more than a champion - a phenomenon. Even rival > champions pay direct tributes to him. They talk in the sheds about how he > bowled over champ after champ like ninepins. Near Drysdale, Deucem Smith, > with a broken thumb on his right hand, the hand in which the handpiece is > held, shore a week's tally of 1430. Legacy In April 2005, Deucem was inducted into the Australian Shearer's Hall of Fame in Hay, NSW, the first aboriginal to be honoured. The hall honours shearers with exceptional skill, character and contribution to the shearing industry. His family donated the Hall of Fame silver shears trophy to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. In June 2006, Deucem's skill as a shearer was recognized in the form of a plaque unveiled by the ACT Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope. The plaque forms part of the Canberra Heritage Trails project that tells the story of Canberra from the time of the Ngunnawal people onward. A documentary about Deucem's life has been green lit and is currently in pre-production. It is being produced by Deucem's great-grandson Benjamin Smith, who is also working on a screenplay for a feature film of his ancestor's life.

This technology protects intermediate level code such as compiled from Java and .NET languages (Oxygene, C#, Visual Basic, etc.) rather than binary object code. Code morphing breaks up the protected code into several processor commands or small command snippets and replaces them by others, while maintaining the same end result. Thus the protector obfuscates the code at the intermediate level. Code morphing is a multilevel technology containing hundreds of unique code transformation patterns. In addition this technology transforms some intermediate layer commands into virtual machine commands (like p-code). Code morphing does not protect against runtime tracing, which can reveal the execution logic of any protected code. Unlike other code protectors, there is no concept of code decryption with this method. Protected code blocks are always in the executable state, and they are executed (interpreted) as transformed code. The original intermediate code is absent to a certain degree, but deobfuscation can still give a clear view of the original code flow. Code morphing is also used to refer to the just-in-time compilation technology used in Transmeta processors such as the Crusoe and Efficeon to implement the x86 instruction set architecture. Code morphing is often used in obfuscating the copy protection or other checks that a program makes to determine whether it is a valid, authentic installation, or an unauthorized copy, in order to make the removal of the copy-protection code more difficult than would otherwise be the case.

Lavarack Barracks is currently home to the Army's 3rd Brigade and 11th Brigade. Elements of the 3rd Brigade based at the Barracks include the Combat Signals Regiment, 3rd Combat Services Support Battalion, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. The barracks are named after Lieutenant General Sir John Lavarack, an Australian Army officer during both World Wars and Governor of Queensland from 1946 to 1957.  Early history Defence force expansion was on the Australian Government's agenda in late 1964. Conflict in Southeast Asia inspired the Government to review Australia's defence capabilities and recommend that a new military base be constructed in Australia's north. Townsville quickly emerged as the favoured location. On 26 November 1964, the Minister for the Army, AJ Forbes, announced to Townsville‚Äôs civilian community on live television that construction on a new base among the northern slopes of Mount Stuart would soon begin. Nearly two years later on 29 July 1966 Lavarack Barracks was officially opened by the late Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt at a ceremony in Townsville. Northern Australia historian Patrick White has suggested that the project to establish a new military base in Townsville resulted from a series of rapid decisions. White has also argued that 'fortuitous circumstances' contributed to Townsville becoming the location for what has become Australia's largest army base. These circumstances aligned a strategic military objective with a civilian development agenda. Cold War tensions had escalated by November 1964 as the conflict in Vietnam had become increasingly violent. The United States had developed plans to deploy combat forces to Vietnam and had requested Australian support. Australia's Government scrambled to pull together its military resources and envisaged a long campaign in support of American initiatives to halt the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. To meet the Government's objective, investment in new military infrastructure was necessary. A new base in Australia's north had strategic appeal; the opportunity to train in terrain similar to that found in Southeast Asia and an increased efficiency to deploy troops to the region. At the same time, public interest in the development of northern Australia was high. Population growth had been identified as a vital ingredient for development and relocating military personnel and their families to the north was considered a way to stimulate growth. The politics of northern development were a strong influence; there is evidence that military officials had preferred that the base be built in Victoria but Cabinet overruled this in favour of a northern location. Townsville's sudden emergence was a surprise to the local community and the rapidness of the project resulted in some disputes between various levels of government, the community and the military. Eventually, the base was opened in 1966 and many of the Australian troops to serve in Vietnam had at some point been based at or transferred through Lavarack Barracks.

In the early years, the NFL was not stable and teams moved frequently to survive, or were folded only to be resurrected in a different city with the same players and owners. The Great Depression era saw the movement of most surviving small-town NFL teams to the large cities to ensure survival. Franchise mergers were popular during World War II in response to the scarcity of players. Few of these relocations and mergers were accompanied with widespread controversy. Franchise moves became far more controversial in the late 20th century when a vastly more popular NFL, free from financial instability, allowed many franchises to abandon long-held strongholds for perceived financially greener pastures. Despite a Pete Rozelle promise to Congress not to relocate franchises in return for a law exempting the league from certain aspects of antitrust laws, making possible the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger, several franchises have relocated in the years since the merger and the passage of the law (Public Law 89-800) which sanctioned it. While owners invariably cited financial difficulties as the primary factor in such moves, many fans bitterly disputed these contentions, especially in Baltimore, St. Louis, and Cleveland, each of which eventually received teams some years after their original franchises left. However, Los Angeles, the second-largest media market in the United States, did not have an NFL team from 1995 to 2015. The league had started actively promoting a return to Los Angeles no later than 2006,Canadian expansion not on NFL radar, CBC Sports, 2/3/2006 and in January 2016, the NFL gave the St. Louis Rams approval to move back to Los Angeles. A year later, the San Diego Chargers also relocated to the city, while the Oakland Raiders relocated to Las Vegas in 2020. Within the United States, the San Diego‚ÄìTijuana market is currently the largest metropolitan area (and only one with over 3 million residents) without an NFL franchise. The only other city to be seriously considered in the country in recent times was San Antonio, Texas, which the Raiders seriously considered as a relocation candidate in 2014 before choosing Las Vegas instead. Speculation on future relocation has mainly been centered around two larger cities outside the United States: Toronto, Canada (q.v. National Football League in Toronto) and London, England, United Kingdom (q.v. Potential London NFL franchise), the latter of which would be the first attempt by one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada to place a team outside North America. Additionally, with the increasing suburbanization of the U.S., the building of new stadiums and other team facilities in the suburbs instead of the central city became popular from the 1970s. Timeline  Teams making more significant moves, in chronological order  The NFL considers these continuous franchises that relocated to different metropolitan areas. The list also includes franchises from the 1960s American Football League that moved during that league's existence. The NFL and AFL agreed to merge in 1966, with the merger taking effect in 1970. All AFL franchises were accepted into the NFL, and the NFL incorporated the AFL's history, records, and statistics. *Decatur Staleys: to Chicago in 1921 (renamed the Chicago Bears in 1922) *Toledo Maroons: to Kenosha, Wisconsin in 1924 *Cleveland Bulldogs: to Detroit as the Wolverines in 1928 *Pottsville Maroons: to Boston as the Bulldogs in 1929 *Dayton Triangles: to Brooklyn as the Dodgers in 1930 (renamed Brooklyn Tigers in 1944) *Portsmouth Spartans: to Detroit as the Lions in 1934Willis, 2010, p. 323‚Äì325.Peterson, 1997, p. 122.McDonough, 1994, p. 50. *Boston Redskins: to Washington, D.C. in 1937 *Cleveland Rams: to Los Angeles in 1946 *Chicago Cardinals: to St. Louis in 1960 *Los Angeles Chargers: to San Diego in 1961 (AFL) *Dallas Texans: to Kansas City as the Chiefs in 1963 (AFL) *Oakland Raiders: to Los Angeles in 1982 *Baltimore Colts: to Indianapolis in 1984 *St. Louis Cardinals: to Phoenix as the Phoenix Cardinals in 1988 (renamed Arizona Cardinals in 1994) *Los Angeles Rams: to St. Louis in 1995 *Los Angeles Raiders: back to Oakland in 1995 *Houston Oilers: temporarily to Memphis in 1997 as the Tennessee Oilers and permanently to Nashville in 1998 (renamed Tennessee Titans in 1999) *St. Louis Rams: back to Los Angeles in 2016 *San Diego Chargers: back to Los Angeles in 2017 *Oakland Raiders: to Las Vegas in 2020  Quasi-moves: movement of more or less intact teams from one city to another  The NFL considers these separate franchises but there is significant continuity from one to the other *Canton Bulldogs: mothballed for the 1924 NFL season when the owner of the Cleveland Bulldogs bought it and took the players and nickname to Cleveland. Franchise resurrected in 1925 *Cleveland Bulldogs: to Detroit, Michigan in 1928 as the Detroit Wolverines *Duluth Eskimos: to Orange, New Jersey as the Orange Tornadoes in 1929 (separate franchises but same players) *Newark Tornadoes: The Newark franchise was forfeited to the league and ordered to be disposed of to the highest bidder after the 1930 season. With no takers, the league owned-and-operated Cleveland Indians of 1931 took the Tornadoes' place, which in turn was filled by the Boston Braves (now Washington Football Team franchise) in 1932. So, while it is possible that Newark or Cleveland franchise was sold to the Boston group in 1932, there is no documentation available. The Tornadoes themselves joined the minor-league American Association later in the 1930s and adopted the name Newark Bears. *Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers corporate entities and players (but not franchises) swap cities after the 1940 NFL season after complex ownership deal. *Boston Yanks franchise to New York City as the New York Bulldogs in 1949 (separate franchise but same owner and players) *New York Yanks (formerly New York Bulldogs) folded after the 1951 NFL season; players transferred to new Dallas Texans franchise for the 1952 NFL season *Dallas Texans: operated out of Hershey, Pennsylvania for the last five games of the 1952 NFL season, playing their last three games in Akron, Ohio. Franchise folded after season's end and players awarded to new Baltimore Colts franchise in 1953 *Owners of the Baltimore Colts and Los Angeles Rams traded franchises in 1972. *Cleveland Browns: to Baltimore as the Ravens in 1996. In 1995 Browns owner Art Modell announced plans to move the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore for the 1996 NFL season. The NFL, the city of Cleveland and Modell reached an agreement whereby the Browns franchise and history would remain in Cleveland to be resurrected by 1999. Modell was given a new franchise for Baltimore, made up of players from the 1995 Cleveland Browns. For more information on this particular move, see Cleveland Browns relocation controversy.  Franchise mergers  *Detroit Tigers roster merges with Buffalo All-Americans in November 1921. *Brooklyn Lions and Brooklyn Horsemen of the 1926 AFL, played in the NFL for the rest of the 1926 season, franchise given to the AFL's New York Yankees in 1927. *Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles to form the Phil-Pitt \\"Steagles\\", for the 1943 season only due to the lack of players during World War II. The team split games between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. *Pittsburgh Steelers and Chicago Cardinals to form Card-Pitt, for the 1944 season only due to the lack of players during World War II. The team split home games between Pittsburgh and Chicago. *Brooklyn Tigers (the same Brooklyn team that moved from Dayton in 1930) and Boston Yanks, initially for the 1945 season only, as simply \\"The Yanks.\\" They split home games between Brooklyn and Boston. The merger became permanent, as the Boston Yanks, after relocation of the Brooklyn franchise in 1946. *Los Angeles Dons of the AAFC and Los Angeles Rams of the NFL merged after the 1949 season, shortly before the two leagues merged entirely *Cleveland Browns and AAFC Buffalo Bills merged in 1950 after the Bills were denied entry into the NFL with the merger *AAFC New York Yankees team name and six players merge with New York Bulldogs to form New York Yanks; rest of team is absorbed by New York Giants  Teams moving between cities/boroughs within their metropolitan area, chronologically by team's first such move  *Orange Tornadoes to nearby Newark, New Jersey in 1930, renamed the Newark Tornadoes *Oakland Raiders: from San Francisco to Oakland (Frank Youell Field, and later the Oakland Coliseum) in 1962 *New York Giants: from Manhattan (Polo Grounds) to The Bronx (Yankee Stadium) in 1956, temporarily relocated to New Haven, Connecticut (Yale Bowl) for the second half of the 1973 and the entire 1974 season, then temporarily relocated to Queens (Shea Stadium) for the 1975 season, then permanently to East Rutherford, New Jersey (Giants Stadium/MetLife Stadium) in 1976 *Philadelphia Eagles: between three Philadelphia neighborhoods‚ÄîNorth Philadelphia to University City in 1958, and then on to South Philadelphia (Veterans Stadium/Lincoln Financial Field) in 1971 *New York Jets: from Manhattan (Polo Grounds) to Queens (Shea Stadium) in 1964 and to East Rutherford, New Jersey (Giants Stadium/MetLife Stadium) in 1984 *Pittsburgh Steelers: from the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Oakland (Forbes Field/Pitt Stadium) to the city's North Shore (Three Rivers Stadium/Heinz Field) in 1970 *San Francisco 49ers: from Golden Gate Park, San Francisco (Kezar Stadium) to the Hunters Point, San Francisco neighborhood (Candlestick Park) in 1971, and south to Santa Clara, California (Levi's Stadium) in 2014 *Dallas Cowboys: from Dallas (Cotton Bowl) to Irving, Texas (Texas Stadium) in 1971, to Arlington, Texas (AT&T; Stadium) in 2009 *Boston Patriots: from the Fenway- Kenmore neighborhood of Boston (Nickerson Field and Fenway Park) to Chestnut Hill (Alumni Stadium) in 1969, to the Allston neighborhood of Boston (Harvard Stadium) in 1970, then to Foxborough, Massachusetts in 1971 (Foxboro Stadium/Gillette Stadium) and renamed New England Patriots *Buffalo Bills: to Orchard Park, New York (New Era Field) in 1973 *Detroit Lions: to Pontiac, Michigan (Pontiac Silverdome) in 1975 and back to Detroit (Ford Field) in 2002 *New Orleans Saints: from Uptown New Orleans (Tulane Stadium) to the Central Business District (Superdome) in 1975 *Los Angeles Rams: to Anaheim, California (Anaheim Stadium) in 1980 *Minnesota Vikings: from suburban Bloomington (Metropolitan Stadium) to downtown Minneapolis (Metrodome) in 1982. Temporarily moved within Minneapolis to the University of Minnesota campus (TCF Bank Stadium) starting in 2014 before returning to the Metrodome site at U.S. Bank Stadium in 2016. *Miami Dolphins: to unincorporated northern Dade County (now the city of Miami Gardens) in 1987 (Hard Rock Stadium) *Washington Redskins: from Washington, DC (RFK Stadium) to Landover, Maryland (FedExField) in 1997 (stadium's postal address was Raljon, Maryland until Redskins purchased by Daniel Snyder in 1999) *Arizona Cardinals: from the eastern Phoenix suburb of Tempe (Sun Devil Stadium) to the western suburb of Glendale (State Farm Stadium) in 2006  Temporary moves, in chronological order  The following are not actually relocations, but temporary moves because these teams' home stadiums were either under construction or otherwise adversely affected: *St. Louis Cardinals: On October 12, 1964, the Cardinals' scheduled home game vs. the Baltimore Colts was moved to Baltimore's Memorial Stadium due to the baseball Cardinals using Busch Stadium for the World Series. *Boston Patriots: Played 1969 season at Boston College's Alumni Stadium in Chestnut Hill and 1970 season at Harvard Stadium before Schaefer Stadium opened in 1971. *Atlanta Falcons: The Falcons' October 5, 1969 home game vs. the Colts was shifted from Atlanta Stadium to Grant Field at Georgia Tech due to the Atlanta Braves hosting the New York Mets in the 1969 National League Championship Series. *Minnesota Vikings: The same day the Colts-Falcons game was moved, the Vikings' matchup with the Green Bay Packers was moved from Metropolitan Stadium to Memorial Stadium at the University of Minnesota due to an ALCS game between the Minnesota Twins and Baltimore Orioles. *Chicago Bears: Played September 27, 1970 game vs. Philadelphia Eagles at Dyche Stadium at Northwestern University due to a new league requirement following the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger that all stadiums seat at least 50,000. The city of Evanston, Illinois and Big Ten Conference blocked the Bears from playing any further games at Northwestern, forcing them to return to Wrigley Field, which seated 47,000, for the remainder of 1970. The Bears moved to Soldier Field in 1971. *Oakland Raiders: On September 23, 1973, the Raiders' game vs. the Miami Dolphins was moved to California Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, home of the University of California Golden Bears, due to a scheduling conflict with the Oakland Athletics MLB team. *New York Jets: The Jets' October 21, 1973 home game vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers was moved to Three Rivers Stadium due to the New York Mets' participation in that season's World Series. Even though the Mets' last home game in the World Series was Thursday, October 18 (Game 5), the contract between New York City, the Mets and Jets required the stadium be available for the Mets until the conclusion of their season. Game 7 of the World Series was October 21 at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. *New York Giants: The Giants played their home games at the Yale Bowl for most of 1973 and all of 1974, and in Shea Stadium in 1975 while Giants Stadium was being constructed. The Giants were evicted from Yankee Stadium following week two of the 1973 season when the stadium in The Bronx was closed for renovations which lasted over two years. *San Francisco 49ers: On October 22, 1989, the 49ers' home game vs. the New England Patriots was played at Stanford Stadium, home of the Stanford University Cardinal (and site of Super Bowl XIX five years earlier), due to the Loma Prieta earthquake in northern California. *St. Louis Rams: played the first half of their inaugural 1995 season in St. Louis at Busch Memorial Stadium while construction of Trans World Dome was completed. *Carolina Panthers: The Panthers began play in 1995 but spent their first season at Memorial Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina while their new stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina was still being built. *Seattle Seahawks: Played three games in 1994 at Husky Stadium as the Kingdome was undergoing emergency repairs, and returned there for the entire 2000 and 2001 seasons before Seahawks Stadium (now CenturyLink Field) was completed. *Chicago Bears: Spent the 2002 season at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois while Soldier Field was being renovated. *San Diego Chargers: On October 27, 2003, the Chargers' home game vs. the Miami Dolphins was played at Sun Devil Stadium, then the home of the Arizona Cardinals, due to the Cedar Fire in southern California. *New Orleans Saints: Due to damage to the Louisiana Superdome, their home field, by Hurricane Katrina, the Saints played three home games of the 2005 season in the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, where the team set up temporary operations, as well as four home games at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (and officially one at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey). The Saints returned to New Orleans in 2006. See also Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Saints. (The Saints returned to Giants Stadium in 2005, defeating the Jets 19-17 on November 27. It marked the first time since the early 1930s that an NFL team had played two regular-season games in a road stadium in the same season.) *Minnesota Vikings: ** The roof of the Metrodome collapsed from excessive snow and wind on December 12, 2010, requiring the Vikings' home game against the New York Giants to be delayed and played on Monday, December 13 at Ford Field in Detroit. Minnesota's next home game was relocated to TCF Bank Stadium on the campus of the University of Minnesota. ** The Vikings returned to TCF Bank Stadium for the 2014 and 2015 seasons after the Metrodome was demolished and U.S. Bank Stadium was built on that site. *Buffalo Bills: Due to a severe snow storm in late November 2014, the Buffalo Bills home game against the New York Jets in week 12 was moved to Ford Field in Detroit. It was also pushed back from Sunday, November 23 to Monday, November 24, with local markets showing the game on CBS. (The Bills had already played in Detroit in 2014, defeating the Lions, 17-14, on October 5.)  Ultimate disposition of the 15 charter franchises  By the start of the 1920 APFA season, the nascent National Football League was composed of 15 franchises. Of those teams, only two are still in operation (denoted in bold): * Akron Pros: Changed name to Akron Indians in 1926. Permanently suspended operations in 1927. * Buffalo All-Americans: Changed name to Buffalo Bisons in 1924, Buffalo Rangers in 1926, and changed back to Buffalo Bisons in 1927 before suspending operations halfway through 1927.

A port for the Nintendo Switch, part of the Arcade Archive collection from the Japanese video game publisher Hamster Corporation, was released in March 2017. A year later the same port was released on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot showcasing a match between Arina and Tesse. Waku Waku 7 has an irregular feature set for a fighting game of its time, and includes features common to SNK fighting games (such as four basic attacks and screens zooming). The game has a roster of nine characters (two of which were available only in the Versus mode of the console ports). Each has a significantly different playstyle and parodies a well-known character from another game. Each character has a powerful special move (referred to as the Harahara movement, or Harahara motion). They have several factors that make them unique, including a need to be charged (during which the character concentrates, says something, strikes a pose or blows a fanfare) and being unblockable and difficult to dodge, but can be interrupted while charging; while charging, the game flashes a warning and sounds an alarm. Characters can be launched through the screen to hit the other corner, and attacked while on the ground; but can also dodge or attack while getting up. Plot \\"It is said that the person who collects all seven of the legendary WakuWaku balls will have their dearest wish granted. Those who find one of the balls become obsessed with the ruthless desire to obtain the others, who will be victorious in the bitter battle to become the owner of all the balls. Victory or defeat - it all lies in your hand.\\" Characters * Rai Bakuoh is a cocky 13-year-old boy who pursues the WakuWaku Balls to achieve his dream of more exciting adventures. He is a parody of Sie Kensou of The King of Fighters/Psycho Soldier. He practices BMX tricks and has an excellent jumping ability (including a double-jump). However, most of his special moves use some sort of dark electric power. * Arina Makihara is a 14-year-old girl with bunny ears, clad in a unitard and short-sleeved jacket. She pursues the WakuWaku Balls to achieve her dream to have a nice love. She is said to have learned to fight in an extracurricular compulsory class in high school, and is often seen with her friends and little brother, who are, like her, all parodies of typical half- animal/half-human characters from several sh≈çjo manga and anime. * Dandy-J is a treasure hunter hired to go after the WakuWaku Balls, though has no wish to grant in particular, and is accompanied by his friend's daughter Natsumi Hazama and pet cat \\"Rampoo\\" (sometimes mentioned as Ramp or Rump) in his quest. Dandy-J uses a whip in his battles, with Natsumi and Rump sometimes making single attacks at the opponent. He is a parody of both the titular character of the Indiana Jones series and Joseph Joestar from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. * Mauru (known as Marurun in the Japanese version) is a purple forest creature that is a parody of Totoro. He carries a lost little girl named Mugi Rokujoh. He likes fruits and singing. Mauru's play style is similar to the Darkstalkers character Sasquatch, with many moves mimicking near- verbatim. * Politank-Z is a tank-mecha of the police department, which is a parody of the police tanks from Dominion. It is piloted by the Chief and his trusty sidekick, the Mechanic, who is a dog. The Politank is large and slow, making it easy to hit, but is able to deal large amounts of damage. * Slash is a calm and collected elf with light green hair and a blue trench coat who battles with a laser sword. He has no wish to grant in particular when he obtains the WakuWaku Balls. He is a parody of typical sword-using heroes of certain manga and anime. * Tesse is the seventh robot built by Dr. Lombrozo, Tesse was made to be that of a maid (cooking and keeping the house clean). She pursues the WakuWaku Balls to not only cure the illness of Dr. Lombrozo, but to also achieve her dream of becoming human. She fights using an assorted array of cleaning utensils, electricity attacks, and a syringe. She is possibly a cross parody of Astro Boy and cosplay restaurants. Selectable only in the versus mode: * Bonus-kun is a living punching bag whose looks, motives and attacks directly lampoon Ryu from Capcom's Street Fighter franchise. His origins lie in Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors; he was Rouwe's punching bag, until it became alive and was then trained by him. Due to a lack of limbs, he cannot crouch or grab opponents. In Waku Waku 7, he features more moves than he did in Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors. * Makaitaitei Fernandez (known as Fernandeath in the Japanese version) is a black sphere with stubby arms, legs and wings, a large grin and an irritating modulated voice. Fernandez is the game's final boss, and is as tall as a skyscraper. Through a variety of magical means, the other characters are enlarged so as to fight him on equal terms, which is a reference to the kaiju genre. Development It was Sunsoft's third fighting game after their 1994 Super Famicom spin-off of their Hebereke series, Sugoi Hebereke, and their 1995 Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors, their first 2D fighting game. Although numbers in titles of games and other types of media are used to tell if they are sequels, the title of the game actually refers to its seven playable characters in the roster. The word \\"Waku Waku\\" is a Japanese onomatopoeia for sounds of excitement. Two years later, Sunsoft worked with a small company SANTACLAUS in producing the 1998 airborne-based fighting game Astra Superstars for the Sega ST-V arcade system. Home releases Waku Waku 7 was later ported to the Neo-Geo AES home console, which features easy-to-access difficulty settings and limited credits. A Neo-Geo CD version was in development, but was canceled due to the Neo-Geo CD failing in the market. This version was later ported to the Sega Saturn instead, but exclusively in Japan. It requires the Saturn's 1 MB RAM expansion cartridge. In 2008, the original Neo-Geo version was included with the Neo-Geo CD version of Sunsoft's other fighting game Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors in Vol.11 of the Neo Geo Online Collection series for the PlayStation 2, titled . While the Neo-Geo CD soundtrack of Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors was added in this version, the soundtrack of Waku Waku 7 is completely different from the unreleased Neo-Geo CD version that was later ported to the Sega Saturn. SNK was unable to add the Neo-Geo CD / Sega Saturn version of the soundtrack because of licensing issues. The Neo-Geo AES home console version was ported to the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on April 27, 2010. Cameos * Arina from Waku Waku 7 was made cameo in the mobile game Shanghai Musume: Mahjong Girls on 2011 in Japan. Soundtrack A soundtrack album of the Neo-Geo version was released by Pony Canyon and Scitron Label on August 21, 1996 exclusively in Japan under the catalog number PCCB-00215. It contains nearly every background music, as well as sound effects and voice samples from the arcade version. It was composed and arranged by Masato Araikawa.  Reception  Waku Waku 7 has been met with mostly positive reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release. In 2012, Complex ranked this \\"underrated and virtually unknown fighter\\" as the 12th best SNK fighting game ever made, commenting, \\"Waku Waku 7 was a trip. Most of the cast was full of colorful beasts and parodies of popular fighting game characters. Mauru had to be the strangest looking creature on the roster (he was also one of the most fun guys to play with). We appreciate this game‚Äôs tight gameplay, super cheery graphics, and hilarious super moves. Do yourself a favor and import a copy of this joint.\\" That same year, GamesRadar included \\"this cheery, colorful Neo Geo fighter\\" among the little-known classic fighting games that deserve HD remakes, adding: \\"Though the zany roster is only seven fighters strong (not including goofy secret characters like a sentient punching bag), Sunsoft crafted quite the fun brawler that gives you super meter and glitzy special moves as often as modern-day Marvel Vs. games.\\"  Notes   References   External links  * Waku Waku 7 at GameFAQs * Waku Waku 7 at Giant Bomb * Waku Waku 7 at Killer List of Videogames * Waku Waku 7 at MobyGames Category:1996 video games Category:ACA Neo Geo games Category:Arcade games Category:D4 Enterprise games Category:Fighting games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Neo Geo games Category:Neo Geo CD games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Sunsoft games Category:SNK games Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with AI-versus-AI modes Category:Virtual Console games ","title":"Waku Waku 7"},{"id":"3931914","text":"In computer networking, TUN and TAP are kernel virtual network devices.

It provides a training establishment for Australian Army Aviation, and also hosts the Republic of Singapore Air Force's \\"Cougar\\" 126 Squadron. The Defence name for the facility is Swartz Barracks, named for prominent politician, Army Aviation advocate, and ex-POW Sir Reginald Swartz. History The base was constructed in 1943 by the Royal Australian Air Force as RAAF Base Oakey as a training facility for No.6 Aircraft Depot and overflow aircraft maintenance depot for RAAF Base Amberley. It was later to store surplus aircraft after the war. On 1 July 1968, the Australian Army Aviation Corps was formed with the Department of Civil Aviation aerodrome at Oakey transferred to Army control on 1 July 1969 for the Corps base. 6 Aviation Squadron (Reconnaissance) relocated from RAAF Amberley and additional Army Aviation units were raised including Headquarters Army Aviation Centre to control the airfield and the Army Aviation Centre Base Squadron. By the end of 1973, the remainder of 1st Aviation Regiment had relocated, including the School of Army Aviation formed from the Training Squadron, and also 5 Base Workshop Battalion of the Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (RAEME) to provide fleet maintenance. Also, 173 General Support Squadron and 171 Command and Liaison Squadron were formed at Oakley. During the period up to the early 1990s, aircraft types operating from the base included Bell OH-58 Kiowa, Bell UH-1 Iroquois, Sikorsky S-70A-9 Black Hawk, Pilatus Porter, and GAF Nomad. In 1998, the Army Aviation Training Centre (AAvnTC) was formed at Oakey to command the School of Army Aviation (SAA), the Australian Defence Force Helicopter School later renamed the Army Helicopter School (AHS) and the RAEME Aircraft Maintenance School later renamed the Rotary Wing Aircraft Maintenance School (RAMS). In 2001, the Army Helicopter School was moved from RAAF Fairbairn to Oakey. In 2004, Iroquois from 1st Aviation Regiment at Oakey were moved to 5th Aviation Regiment in Townsville. During 2005‚Äì06, the 1st Aviation Regiment moved its Headquarters, technical and logistic support squadrons and other elements to Robertson Barracks in Darwin. In 2006, a disbandment parade was held at Oakey for the last independent RAEME Workshop. In 2007, Boeing Australia was announced the successful tenderer for the Army Aviation Training and Training Support (AATTS) contract and commenced providing pilot, aircrew and technician training for the Kiowa and Black Hawk helicopters and also operational fleet maintenance. In 2010, a new expanded contract was awarded to include most facets of military rotary wing flying training for Kiowa, Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters. In 2009, 173rd Aviation Squadron, ceased operations at Oakey, with the transfer of the unit's Beechcraft King Air 350 to the RAAF. In 2010, with realignment of Army Chain of Command, the base units of the Army Aviation Training Centre came under the control and responsibility of Army Forces Command. Units Australian Defence Force (ADF) units currently based at Oakey include: *Army Aviation Training Centre (AAvnTC) * No. 44 Wing Air Traffic Control Detachment * 1MP Military Police (detachment, including dogs) *Health Centre Oakey (Primary Health/Emergency Response/Crash Rescue/Aeromedical Evacuation) Republic of Singapore units currently based at Oakey include: * 126 Squadron (Super Puma) Aircraft The base currently utilises the following aircraft types: * Bell OH-58 Kiowa * Sikorsky S-70A-9 Black Hawk * Eurocopter EC665 Tiger * Eurocopter Super Puma (RSAF) * Eurocopter MRH-90 Visiting types include: * Pilatus PC9/A * Agusta A109 * Boeing CH47D/F Chinook * Pacific Aerospace CT4B * Careflight Bell 412 Warbirds: * Various warbird types visit the airfield as part of the Army Aviation Museum Annual Fly-In. Facilities The base facilities include accommodation for students attending courses and single members working on the base. Other facilities include tennis courts, squash courts, basketball and netball court, football ovals, heated indoor swimming pool, equipped gymnasium, defence banking and credit union branches, and a AAFCANS kiosk (with ATM), as well as messing facilities for Soldiers, SNCO, and Officers. Australian Army Flying Museum Museum entrance, 2014 The Australian Army Flying Museum reopened in September 2005 in new buildings on land adjacent to the airport, after a grant was provided by the Australian Government. Distinguished guests included national and local dignitaries, including well known aviation identity Dick Smith. The purpose-built facility includes many historical aircraft tracing the history of the Aviation Corps in the Australian Army and back to the Australian Flying Corps during World War I. Featured types in the collection of aircraft include Bell 47, Bell OH-58 Kiowa, GAF Nomad, Pilatus PC-6 Porter, and Cessna 180. The museum also maintains a significant collection of artefacts dating from the inception of the Army Flying Corps and WWI to the present day. The Australian Army Flying MuseumAustralian Army Flying Museum (AAFM) is a sub-unit of the Army History Unit, a direct command unit of the Australian Army Headquarters. Airlines, facilities and destinations =Domestic= Whilst the airfield is military controlled and regulated, a small civil terminal has been maintained on the airfield for many years. The current terminal structure was built at the same time as the new buildings for the Army Flying Museum refurbishment in 2005, and shares the access road to this facility. The airfield does not cater for Regular Public Transport (RPT) airline services, however it does provide an emergency alternative in the event of adverse weather. =Satellite sites= Associated with military training at OAAC are two satellite site airfields. Located 22 kilometres north-west is Brymaroo. Further west is Wyoming airfield. Both fields are for military use only.

It is the capital of Al Bahah Region, and is one of the Kingdom's prime tourist attractions. It enjoys a pleasant climate and is surrounded by more than forty forests, including Raghdan, al Zaraeb and Baidan. Al Baha is the headquarters of the Governor, local councils and branches of governmental departments. Receiving the state's special attention, the city of Al Baha abounds in educational, tourist and health institutions. It is considered the capital of the Ghamdi and Zahrani tribes in Saudi Arabia, and most of its inhabitants are from the native tribes. The name \\"Pearl of Resorts\\" is the name given to Al- Baha by those acquainted with the city. The name \\"Garden of the Hejaz\\" () was the name given to it by the Sharif of Mecca.  Geography and location  Al- Baha City lies in the west of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the Hejaz region, between Mecca, which borders it from the north, west, and south west, and Aseer which borders it from the south east. It is the smallest of the kingdom's provinces (). It is surrounded by a number of cities, including Taif on the north, Beesha on the east, and the Red Sea coast city of Al Qunfuda on the west. This tourist city is situated in an area characterized by natural tree cover and agricultural plateaus. It consists of six towns, the most important of which are Beljarshy, Almandaq, and Almekhwah, in addition to the Baha city in the center of the province. The province comprises 31 administrative centers and has a population of 533,001. The province is known for its beauty and has forests, wildlife areas, valleys and mountains that attract visitors from all parts of the kingdom and the Persian Gulf area. Some of these areas are the forests of Raghdan, Ghomsan, Fayk, and Aljabal, and many other historical and archeological sites. It contains more than 53 forests. Al-Baha is the homeland of the Ghamid and Zahran tribes and is divided geographically into three distinct parts: Sarah, which contains the high Hejaz mountains characterized by temperate weather and rich plant cover due to relatively high annual rainfall, Tihama which is the lowland coastal area to the west of the Hejaz characterized by very hot and humid weather and very little rainfall average, and the eastern hills characterized by an altitude of above sea level with cool winters, hot summers and sparse plant cover. The largest city in the province, both in population and area, is Baljurashi, the second one is Al-Mandaq. In Tehama, there are two major cities: Qilwah and Al-Mikhwah. The number of tribes are 18, branching from the main ones, Ghamid and Zahran. The province has 13 settled tribes (working in trades and agriculture) and 5 nomadic tribes.  Climate  Al Bahah has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh). The climate is greatly affected by its varying geographic features. Generally speaking, the climate in Al-Baha is mild with temperatures ranging between . Due to its location at above sea level, Al Baha's climate is moderate in summer and cold in winter. The area attracts visitors looking for a moderate climate and pristine, scenic views. In the Tehama area of the province, which is down on the coast, the climate is hot in the summer and warm in the winter. Humidity ranges from 52%‚Äì67%. While in the mountainous region, which is known as As-Sarah, the weather is cooler in summer and winter. Rainfall in the mountainous region lies in the range of . The average throughout the whole region is annually.  History  Post-World War 1, the village of El-Zafir () had been the administrative centre of what was known then as Belad Ghamid, but with the establishment of Saudi Arabian government Ghamid and Zahran was administered as a unit in 1925, and the seat of local government transferred to Baljurash√≠ (), a town situated fifteen miles south of El-Zafir. The tribes of Al Baha, that is Ghamid and Zahran are the indigenous people of Al Baha. Tribes in the region trace their origin to the ancient Arabian Mamlaka·π´ Saba‚Äô (, possibly the Kingdom of Sheba), whose rule extended to areas presently known as Syria and Lebanon. Historians also report that they established the famous state of Axum, in Abyssinia. Prince Husam bin Saud is the governor of the province since April 21, 2017.  Historic attractions  Old architecture in Al-Baha Al Baha is also known for their traditional towers, each of which is called a qa·π£bah (). It was said \\"Apparently unique to Albaha architecture are the qasaba towers. Controversy surrounds their function‚Äîsome argue that they were built as lookouts, and others that they were keeps, or even granaries. Perhaps it is a combination, although the right position of a watchtower, on a hill top, is the wrong place for a keep or granary.\\"Mostyn, Trevor. 1983. Saudi Arabia- A MEED Practical Guide. London: Middle East Economic Digest. 2nd edition. Page 320. Dhee Ayn Village () is situated at about southwest of al- Baha, across 'Aqabat al-Baha, also known as Aqbat King Fahad. This famous village sometimes known as \\"marble village\\" as it is built on a small marble mountain. The grove of palm trees is lush due to a small stream nearby. The villagers say that the marble village glows at sunset. It also has a steep escarpment road, running into and out of tunnels on the way up and down. Dhi 'Ain was famous for its fruits and banana plantations which still grow there. The village dates back about 400 years, and it witnessed the battles between the Ottoman Turks and its inhabitants. The village was named after an ‚ÄòAyn (, water spring) continuously flowing from the nearby mountains to several reservoirs and each particular pond has its own name. There is a local legend that talks about a man lost his cane in one of the valleys, and to retrieve it he tracked it until he reached the village, he gathered its inhabitants and retrieved his cane after digging the spring: \\"Even the road that leads to the (Dhee Ayn) village is impressive, and several historical stone and slate towers dot the way. Al-Bahah Region is known as the region of 1001 towers, once built to protect villages, roads and plantations from rivalling tribes. Today, these towers are abandoned, and many of them are partially or completely in ruins.\\"\\"Marble Village of Dhee Ayn.\\"  Infrastructure  = Souq = The souq or traditional market in Al Baha has been studied to see how the market performs in maintaining order and social customs. \\"Weekly markets in Al-Baha, which is located in the south-western part of Saudi Arabia, was not only performing economic functions, but also, social functions. Those markets continued to perform these functions until around 1975 when the modern markets began to take over, and other social institutions like schools, mail, and mass media began to do the social functions of those weekly markets. This study is trying to explain the social functions of weekly markets in Al-Baha like uniting the tribes, using the market as a tool of punishment, entertainment, mail and religious education.\\"Abdul-Razzaq H.

One old villager explained how tribal cemeteries came about. ‚ÄúPeople used to die in large numbers and very rapidly one after the other because of diseases. So the villagers would dig graves close by burying members of the same family in one area. That was how the family and tribal burial grounds came about,‚Äù he said. The old man continued, ‚ÄúIf the family ran out of space, they would open old graves where family members had been buried before and add more people to them. This process is known as khashf.‚Äù During famines and outbreaks of epidemics huge numbers of people would die and many tribes faced difficulties in digging new graves because of the difficult weather. Elderly people remember that in olden times, the winter used to stretch for more than six months and would be accompanied by much rain and fog, making movement difficult. But due to tribal rivalries many families would guard their cemeteries and put restrictions on who got buried in them. Across Baha burial grounds are constructed in different ways. Some cemeteries consist of underground vaults or concrete burial chambers with the capacity of holding a large number of bodies at a time. Such vaults include windows for people to peer through and are usually decorated ornately with writings, drawings and patterns. Muhammad Saleh, a local resident, said, ‚ÄúOne of the things that is so iconic about many of these graves is the fact that many of them are not directed toward the Kaaba. This tells us that some of these graves are from the pre-Islamic era. In Islam the face of a dead person should be toward the Kaaba.‚Äù\\"\\"Tradition of Family Cemeteries Disappearing From Tribal Areas.\\" Arab News.

The region also grows grapes, grapefruits, lemons, oranges, pomegranates and dates.\\"  Language  It is claimed by some Arab authors that the dialect of Belad Ghamid and Zahran (Now known as Al Baha province in Saudi Arabia) is nearest to classical Arabic. Ahmed Abdul Ghafur Attar (Arabic : ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑÿ∫ŸÅŸàÿ± ÿπÿ∑ÿßÿ± ) has said in an article* that the language of the Hejaz (Arabic ŸÑŸáÿ¨ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ¨ÿßÿ≤), especially that which is spoken in Belad Ghamdi and Zahran is close to the Classical Language. Faisal Ghori (Arabic ŸÅŸäÿµŸÑ ÿ∫Ÿàÿ±Ÿä), a famous scholar of Arabic Literature wrote in his book Qabayil Al- Hejaz (Arabic ŸÇÿ®ÿßÿ¶ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ¨ÿßÿ≤) The Quranic Arabic upon which our grammar is based on does not exist in any tribe.

Major gold mining areas were those of KhayƒÅl al-Ma·π£na‚Äò () and Al-‚ÄòAqƒ´q (). The village of Kuna has over one hundred building structures which date back to South Arabian Civilization.  Wildlife  Visitors from inside the kingdom and nearby countries are particularly attracted to the area by its more than 53 forests, which include the Raghdan forest, which covers an area of just from the city. Iit has been provided with children's playgrounds and other amenities. The Amdan forest is to the north of Al Baha. It abounds in olive trees, Ara'r shrubs and other natural vegetation. The Wadi Feig forest is from Al Baha. It is encircled by a green valley littered with apricot, pomegranate and grape orchards. The forest of Wadi Al Ageeg is from Al Baha and abounds in various fruit trees and tall lotus trees. Al Baha airport is in Ageeg city. Al Kharrara waterfall is 30 kilometers to the south of Al Baha. Its scenic view attracts a large numbers of visitors. Shada Mountain () is the highest summit in Makhwah. It features rare rocky formations that attract amateur climbers of various levels. The Arabian leopard is known to exist in the Asir mountains between Al-Bahah and Abha. It is also present in the Hijaz mountains to the north.

His primary areas of research are the philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, and cognitive science. Existential cognition In his book, Existential Cognition: Minds in the World, McClamrock argued for the extreme importance of the external environment (both social and physical) in the determination of almost all varieties of human and animal behavior. His position is that the methodological individualism inherent in many contemporary forms of computational theories of the mind are completely inadequate and that we must look to the interactions between organism and world in order to find \\"external mechanisms that mediate behavior\\" as well as the usual internal mechanisms. Borrowing from Herbert A. Simon and also influenced by the ideas of existential phenomenologists such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Martin Heidegger, McClamrock suggests that man's condition of being-in-the-world makes it impossible for him to understand himself by abstracting away from it and examining it as if it were a detached experimental object of which he himself is not an integral part. However, unlike the continental philosophers, McClamrock relies upon results from modern information sciences, biology and cognitive science to support his conclusions about the bounded and embedded nature of consciousness and the mind as a whole. One of his examples, taken from David Marr, discusses the exploitation of local environmental regularities in the control mechanisms of the common fly. :\\"Flies, it turns out, don't quite know that to fly they should flap their wings. They don't take off by sending some signal from the brain to the wings. There is a direct control link from the fly's feet to its wings such that when the feet cease to be in contact with a surface, the fly's wings begin to flap. To take off, the fly simply jumps and then lets the signal from the feet trigger the wings. The local surface mediates the signal from brain to wings, illustrating the point that the human nervous system may be said, in a certain sense, to extend to parts of its external environment. In another example, McClamrock cites the case of a man driving from one destination to another. On the way, he encounters various external signals and stimuli (street names, direction signs, people who provide information when asked, landmarks, etc..) and all of these help him, in many cases are indispensable to, his successfully finding his way from point A to point B. The path he ends up traveling to get to point B from point A is, in any case, partially determined by his environment. In the case of ants, this is even clearer. When we look at the tracks that ants make as a result of their movements, they seemed to be highly ordered and preplanned. But, in fact, an ant will usually encounter unforeseen and unforeseeable obstacles as it makes its way along from one point to another. At each obstacle, it will be constrained to make a choice that it otherwise wouldn't. The path that it ultimately travels will therefore be heavily determined by its exterior environment, as well its behavior. Argument against Kim McClamrock's article \\"Emergence Unscathed: Kim on Non-Reducible Types\\" took on Jaegwon Kim's famous \\"causal powers\\" argument against multiple realizability.Kim, Jaegwon (1992) \\"Multiple Realization and the Metaphysics of Reduction\\", Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 52: 1-26 Kim argued that multiple realizability conflicts with fundamental constraints on the definition of kinds and with general rules of scientific taxonomy. Kim's argument is based on two essential premises: : The Causal Inheritance Principle: if mental property M is realized in a system at time t in virtue of physical realization base P, the causal powers of M are identical with the causal powers of P. From this it follows that: :Instances of M that are realized by the same physical base must be grouped under one kind, since the physical base is a causal kind, and instances of M with different realization bases must be grouped under distinct kinds. The second premise is : The Principle of the Causal Individuation of Kinds: kinds in science are individuated on the basis of their causal powers. From all of this, it follows, according to Kim, that \\"if mental kinds are multiply realizable, then they are disqualified as proper scientific kinds...because they are realized by diverse physical causal kinds.\\"Kim (1992), 18 McClamrock flatly rejected Kim's claim that \\"instances of M that are realized by the same physical base must be grouped under one kind\\". It is a consequence of token materialism that a complete specification of the causal powers of a mental kind at a certain time will be a complete specification of the causal powers of the physical state which implements it. But Kim's assertion only follows if we assume that the only specification of causal kinds can be in terms of causal powers of tokens. McClamrock suggested understanding higher-level causal powers as simply more general and abstract characterizations of the lower-level causal powers implemented in the physical structure of a system. There are many varieties of causal taxonomy classifying things according to various kinds of causal powers they possess. For example, a taxonomy of orbiting bodies may specify the causal powers of objects in terms of mass, position and velocity ‚Äì abstracting from the body's chemical composition, geology or microbiotic agglomerations. Such an abstract and incomplete characterization of the causal powers of a system makes it possible to group together physically type- distinct instances of the higher-level kind (in this case, planets, stars and other orbiting bodies). Moreover, taxonomies in computer science are typically characterized by such abstractions. What is of interest at the level of information processing are such things as registers and microprogramming operations, not the causal powers of the material structure of semiconductors.

He participated in the conquest of Syria and Palestine, but died in Medina. Biography =Early years= Abdullah ibn Salam was a Jew in Yathrib who belonged to the Banu Qaynuqa tribe, claiming descent from Joseph.http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/190-abdallah-ibn-salam \\" He belonged to the tribe of the Banu ·∏≤ainu·∏≥a'a. His name was Al-Husain, and he claimed to be a descendant of Joseph. He was widely respected and honored by the people of the city, even those who were not Jewish. He was known for his piety and goodness, his upright conduct, and his truthfulness. Abdullah ibn Salam lived a peaceful and gentle life but he was serious, purposeful and organized in the way he spent his time. For a fixed period each day, he would worship, teach and preach in the synagogue. Then he would spend some time in his orchard, looking after date palms, pruning and pollinating. Thereafter, to increase his understanding and knowledge of his religion, he would devote himself to the study of the Torah. In this study, it is said he was particularly struck by some verses of the Torah which dealt with the coming of a prophet who would complete the message of previous prophets. Abdullah ibn Salam therefore took an immediate and keen interest when he heard reports of the appearance of a prophet in Mecca. He used to stop at certain passages in the Torah and ponder a long time upon the news therein of the prophet who was to appear to complete the Message of all the prophets before him. The more he read the more he became convinced that the foretold prophet was Muhammad who appeared among his people in Mecca. =Conversion of Abdullah= In 622, Muhammad left Mecca for Medina. When he reached Medina and stopped at Quba, a man came rushing into the city, calling out to people and announcing the arrival of Muhammad. On hearing the news, Abdullah ibn Salam exclaimed the Shahadah (Testimony of faith that there is only one God and Muhammad is His Messenger) and told his aunt, who was sitting nearby: \\"Aunt, he is really, by God, the brother of Moses and follows his religion\\".Hughes Dictionary of Islam, Abdullah Ibn Salam: \\"She was silent for a while and then said: 'Is he the Prophet about whom you spoke to us who would be sent to confirm the truth preached by previous (prophets) and complete the message of his Lord?' 'Yes,' I replied.\\" Tradition recounts Abdullah's early life in his own words: > \\"When I heard of the appearance of the Messenger of God (peace be upon him) > I began to make enquiries about his name, his genealogy, his > characteristics, his time and place and I began to compare this information > with what is contained in our books. From these enquiries, I became > convinced about the authenticity of his prophethood and I affirmed the truth > of his mission. However, I concealed my conclusions from the Jews. I held my > tongue. Then came the day when the Prophet, peace be upon him, left Makkah > and headed for Yathrib. When he reached Yathrib and stopped at Quba, a man > came rushing into the city, calling out to people and announcing the arrival > of the Prophet. At that moment, I was at the top of a palm tree doing some > work. My aunt, Khalidah bint Al-Harith, was sitting under the tree. On > hearing the news, I shouted: ‚ÄúAllahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!‚Äù (God is Great! > God is Great!) When my aunt heard me, she remonstrated with me: ‚ÄúMay God > frustrate you... By God, if you had heard that Moses was coming you would > not have been more enthusiastic.‚Äù ‚ÄúAuntie, he is really, by God, the > ‚Äòbrother‚Äô of Moses and follows his religion. He was sent with the same > mission as Moses.‚Äù She was silent for a while and then said: ‚ÄúIs he the > Prophet about whom you spoke to us who would be sent to confirm the truth > preached by previous (Prophets) and complete the message of his Lord?‚Äù > ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I replied. Without any delay or hesitation, Abdullah went out to meet > the Prophet. He saw crowds of people at his door. I moved about in the > crowds until I reached close to him. The first words I heard him say were: > 'O people! Spread peace...Share food...Pray during the night while people > sleep... and you will enter Paradise in peace...' I looked at him closely. I > scrutinized him and was convinced that his face was not that of an imposter. > I went closer to him and made the declaration of faith that there is no god > but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God. The Prophet turned to me > and asked: 'What is your name?' 'Al-Husayn ibn Salam,' I replied. 'Instead, > it is (now) Abdullah ibn Salam,' he said (giving me a new name). 'Yes,' I > agreed. 'Abdullah ibn Salam (it shall be). By Him who has sent you with the > Truth, I do not wish to have another name after this day.' I returned home > and introduced Islam to my wife, my children and the rest of my household. =In the Qur'an= Reportedly the Qur'an implicitly mentions Abdullah ibn Salam, \\"Say, 'Have you considered: if the Qur'an was from Allah, and you disbelieved in it while a witness from the Children of Israel has testified to something similar and believed while you were arrogant?' Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people\\" (Qur'an, 46:10). Tafsir al-Jalalayn mentions in its exegesis of this verse that the \\"witness\\" in the verse refers to Abdullah ibn Salam. =Promise to Abdullah= Abdullah ibn Salam was the first Muslim that was promised Paradise while he was still alive. In a Hadith, it was reported that one day while Muhammad was sitting with the best of his companions, he said \\"Do you want to see a man walking on Earth and in Paradise?\\" Each one of the companions looked in silence towards Muhammad hoping he would mention their name. Muhammad pointed in the distance and the companions saw he was looking towards Abdullah ibn Salam.

It is in Tabuk Province. Local citizens describe it as The Pearl of the Red Sea. The population of Duba is about 22,000.Port of Dhiba (Duba), Saudi Arabia History The first reference to Duba, under this name, is from 1203. However, the Valley of Salma and Valley of Kafafah were already known many centuries before. The ancient Greek scholar Ptolemy mentioned a trade route leading from Kafafah to Lihyan (today's Al-\`Ula). Sheikh Abd al-Ghani al- Nabulsi wrote about Duba in 1790, in his account of going to Mecca for the Hajj. Historically it is part of Madian; the city is mentioned in Islamic scriptures. According to the Quran, Prophet Moussa settled in Madian (the region starts from Jordan river and extends to the town of Duba) where Prophet Shoaib hosted him. The town of Prophet Shoaib as it is called is said to be located near Maqna where an ancient well can still be seen. The well is said to be the one where Moussa fed Shoaib's flock. The Ottoman Turks fortified the city, protecting the route from Egypt to Arabia. After the Saudi conquest of the city in 1933, King Abdulaziz built his castle there in the same year. Geography Duba is located in the northwest of Saudi Arabia on the coast of the Red Sea on the Egyptian road of the Hajj, about 300 km from the intersection of Egypt, Jordan and Israel. Duba includes 3 valleys, Dahkan to the north, and Salma and Kafafah on the south. It is about 800 km from Jeddah / Mecca via the coastal highway that passes through the major port and industrial city of Yanbu. Duba is a port city and ferries and ships operate from here for Egypt and Jordan. The Hurghada and Safaga ports of Egypt can be reached within about 3 hours (minimum) by ferry. It is strategically located at the starting point of Gulf of Aqaba that ends at Eilat (Israel) and Aqaba, Jordan. The Springs of Maqna are an interesting picnic spot and there are notable beaches such as Sharma Beach, though it is not developed as a tourist spot. Climate K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh). Transportation There is no local public transport within the city. Most of the city is within walking range. Rental car facilities are present for day trips (or even more for nearby attractions). Some individuals do operate their cars as private taxis but they are difficult to trace. The neighboring cities Tabuk (180 km) and Al Wajh (about 160 km) have airport facilities that connect the region with major national and international airports of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saptco Saudi Road Transport offers bus services from Jeddah and Mecca to Tabuk, Saudi Arabia via Duba. It takes about 12 hours to reach Duba from Jeddah.

Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd, 1964) The book Notes on Prosody by polyglot author Vladimir Nabokov compares differences in iambic verse in the English and Russian languages, and highlights the effect of relative word length in the two languages on rhythm. Nabokov also proposes an approach for scanning patterns of accent which interact with syllabic stress in iambic verse. Originally Appendix 2 to his Commentary accompanying his translation of Aleksandr Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, Notes on Prosody was released separately in book form.Pantheon Books, Number LXXIIa (1964) in the Bollingen Series, Library of Congress catalogue card: 64-23672. Notes on Prosody and Nabokov's translation of Eugene Onegin sparked considerable academic debate. Bely's influence Nabokov in large part follows the system described by Andrei Bely in his paper \\"Description of the Russian iambic tetrameter\\" (\\"–û–ø—ã—Ç —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —á–µ—Ç—ã—Ä–µ—Ö—Å—Ç–æ–ø–Ω–æ–≥–æ —è–º–±–∞\\") published in the collection of essays Symbolism (–°–∏–º–≤–æ–ª–∏–∑–º) (Moscow, 1910). Terminology The word stress is reserved for the underlying unvarying pattern of the iambic rhythm, and the word accent is used to describe where the accent falls in speaking a line. He introduces the notion of a scud, which he defines to be an unaccented stress (page 9). He uses U shaped symbol and / to illustrate. He describes a number of types of scuds (page 18): *tilted scud -- an inversion, where the accent falls on the first syllable of an iambic foot, of which there are various types: **split tilt -- an accented monosyllable followed by an unaccented one **short tilt -- an accented monosyllable followed by an unaccented first syllable of a polysyllabic word **duplex tilt -- a disyllabic word where the accent falls on the first syllable in ordinary speech **long tilt -- the first two syllables of a trisyllabic word, where the first syllable is accented in ordinary speech *reverse tilt -- an unaccented stress followed by an accented depression (non-stress) (thereby falling across two iambic feet) the main variety of which is the: **split reverse tilt -- two monosyllables the first not accented and the second accented (i.e. the fairly common xx// ending to line) **duplex reverse tilt -- a disyllabic word accented on the second syllable 'against the grain' of stress-unstress; Nabokov somewhat misinterprets Robert Bridges discussion of \\"Recession of accent\\" in his book Milton's Prosody, claiming that Bridges 'designates' the duplex reverse tilt as 'recession of accent', whereas Bridges starts from the phenomenon of 'recession of accent' as analysed by Alexander Schmidt and proceeds to analyse possible occurrences of it in Milton's verse. Differences between Russian and English verse The primary source of the differences between Russian and English verse is that English has many one syllable nouns, verbs, and adjectives, where Russian words typically have many syllables, and carry only a single invariable stress. The iambic rhythm of alternating accented and unaccented syllables is relatively natural in English, whereas in Russian speech many unaccented syllables may quite naturally occur in sequence. =English iambic tetrameters= #Scudless lines are more common than scudded lines. #Sequences of scudded lines are short. #Scuds are frequently associated with weak monosyllables, duplex tilts, and scudded rhymes (in the final foot) #Scuds in feet 1 and 2 occur about as frequently as in foot 3; scuds in foot 4 are rare. The line is weighted accentually towards its end. #Feminine rhymes are \\"scarce, insipid, or burlesque\\" #Elisions are relatively common. =Russian iambic tetrameters= #Scudded lines are much more common than scudless lines. #Scuds often form linked patterns from line to line, often in sequences of twenty or more lines. Sequences of scudless lines rarely occur in sequences longer than two or three lines. #Scuds are frequently associated with the unaccented syllables of long words; there are almost no duplex tilts. Rhymes are not scudded (that is, there is no scud in the final foot). #Scuds in foot 3 are by far the most common. The line is weighted accentually towards its beginning. #Feminine rhymes are as frequent as masculine ones. #There are strictly speaking no elisions of any kind.

It is owned and operated by Chelmsford City Council. History The last private owner lived in Hylands House until her death until 1962. It was in 1966, with the House in a desperate state of disrepair, that Chelmsford Borough Council purchased the Park for the people of Chelmsford to enjoy. Hylands Park was opened to the public only 10 days later. It was agreed by Chelmsford Borough Council that Hylands House should be restored to its former glory and having stood empty for 20 years, the first phase of restoration took place in 1986. The final stage was completed in 2005.  Past owners of Hylands House  = Sir John Comyns 1730‚Äì1740 = Around 1726, a local and well respected lawyer, Sir John Comyns, purchased the manor of Shaxstones in Writtle, and commissioned the construction of a new family home on the estate, suitable for a man of his standing. Completed in 1730, Hylands House was an elegant two-storey red brick building in Queen Anne style architecture. The grounds were set out in the formal geometric style fashionable at the time, with a pleasure garden and small kitchen garden to the north of the house. = John Comyns 1740‚Äì1760 & John Richard Comyns 1760‚Äì1797 = Sir John Comyns died in 1740, without surviving children, and left the estate to his nephew, John Comyns of Romford. In 1759, John Comyns commissioned a monument to the life of his beloved uncle, which can be seen at the family vault in Writtle Church. John in turn left Hylands to his son, John Richard Comyns in 1760. = Cornelius Kortright 1797‚Äì1815 = In 1797 Cornelius Kortright purchased Hylands House and employed the well-known landscape architect Humphry Repton, who set about redesigning the gardens. Kortright planned to add the east and west wings, a colonnaded portico and cover the whole house in white stucco. However, despite the grand plans Kortright did not see the House through to completion as his ever increasing family required them to relocate to a much larger residence, in nearby Fryerning. = Pierre Cesar Labouchere 1816‚Äì1839 = Pierre Cesar Labouchere, a Dutch born merchant banker, purchased the estate in 1814 and set about completing Repton's design for expansion and improvement of the house and parkland. This resulted in the symmetrical neo-classic facade that can be seen today. Labouchere created the formal Pleasure Gardens and under the guidance of architect Williams Atkinson, the Georgian Stable Block and Coachman's Cottage. He also collected neo-classical sculptures, including works by the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen, replicas of which are on display in the house today. = John Attwood 1839‚Äì1858 = After Labouch√®re's death, his son Henry Labouchere sold Hylands House and Estate to Mr John Attwood, former owner of an ironworks in Birmingham. Attwood was an ambitious entrepreneur who wanted a property to befit his new status and promote his quest for a peerage. As MP for Harwich, he decided that Hylands was insufficiently grand to reflect his position in society, and had the house considerably enlarged and fully redecorated. He purchased over of additional land surrounding Hylands and privatised the road from Writtle to Margaretting that ran through the estate. = Arthur Pryor 1858‚Äì1904 = Arthur Pryor was a partner in the Truman, Hanbury and Buxton Brewery and purchased a much reduced Hylands Estate in 1858. He did little to the house other than some redecoration, although some of the exuberant decoration in the Banqueting Room is credited to him. = Sir Daniel Gooch 1904‚Äì1920 = Having originally rented the House and land in 1904, Sir Daniel Gooch purchased Hylands in 1907, and modernised the House, with the installation of electricity and telephones. The Gooch family entertained regularly, with shooting parties and fetes, including a memorable celebration for the coronation of King George V. During World War I, Hylands House was requisitioned for use as a military hospital, and over 1,500 patients were treated there. Sir Daniel was also a keen explorer and accompanied Sir Ernest Shackleton on the first leg of his bid to reach the South Pole, but returned home early, suffering from severe frostbite. = Mr John and Christine Hanbury 1922‚Äì1962 = In 1920, Hylands was sold to a syndicate of local gentlemen, but only two years later it was purchased by John Hanbury. Like Arthur Pryor, John was chairman of the brewers Truman's. However, John Hanbury died suddenly in 1923 before taking occupation of Hylands. Christine was later left alone when Jock became one of the first pilots to die in the Second World War in a flying accident. Christine Hanbury made great changes to the grounds, including a lawn tennis court, rhododendron borders and a private area in the gardens dedicated to the memory of her husband and son. During World War II, the estate was the site for a German Prisoner of War Camp, and the house was used by the SAS as their headquarters. Mrs Christine Hanbury died in 1962, aged 89, leaving the house and estate to her trustees, and for the final time in its history Hylands was again offered for sale. Chelmsford Borough Council purchased the house and estate at auction in 1966 and set about opening it to the public and eventually restoring both the House and the grounds. Restoration of the House The House was in a state of progressive deterioration but, despite its poor condition, in 1967 Hylands House became a Grade II listed building. In 1985 the Borough Council set up a restoration fund and later that year English Heritage gave their consent to the Council's proposal to reduce the house to its 19th-century appearance. Prior to work commencing Hylands House was re-graded to become a Grade II* listed building. As a result of the collaboration of the Director of Leisure Services, Malcolm Gilham and the Borough Architect, Esmond Abraham, phased restoration work began in 1986, and by 1996 the external work to the House had been completed and the Entrance Hall restored to its Georgian grandeur. The Blue Room and Boudoir were refurbished and once again the house was full of the sound of people. The Friends of Hylands House was formed and they have undertaken fundraising to assist with the furnishing of the House. During 1998 planning began to celebrate the opening of the East Wing. The Manager, Linda Pittom (then Palmer) and her team, worked to ensure that not only the 'VIP 'official opening, the celebrations for those working on the project and the very first Wedding Ceremony at Hylands, and the celebrations of the public open days were a success. The east wing was fully restored and opened to the general public at Easter 1999. The west wing and basement restoration quickly followed and their grand opening took place at Easter 2004 - the Manager and her team in conjunction with the Special Events Team at Chelmsford Borough Council provided a comprehensive, exciting and entertaining programme of events. The restoration of the basement area has brought to life the original red brick Queen Anne house and a number of exciting discoveries were made. Interpretation boards throughout the house offer visitors an informative and photographic display of the restoration process. The final phase of restoration in the House was completed in September 2005, supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Hylands House is now fully restored to its Victorian splendour. Restoration of the Estate Hylands House Intensive work on restoring the historic landscape of Hylands Park to its 18th-century splendour, designed by landscape architect Humphry Repton, began in 2004 and was completed in 2007. The restoration of Hylands Park was financed by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of ¬£3.4 million and by the Council. Recent history From 1996 until 2017, the park hosted the annual V Festival. In 2018 it became RiZE Festival. In the 2004 film Chasing Liberty, Hylands House doubled as the US White House. In 2005 Hylands Park was the venue for the European Scout Jamboree and in 2007 Hylands welcomed scouts from over 160 nations for the 21st World Scout Jamboree, which celebrated 100 years of scouting. The One World Garden was created to commemorate this historic event, and now forms part of the estate. In 2019, the Netflix series The Crown Season 3, Hylands House was again used as a double for the White House. The Stables section of the house is now lively Arts Quarter. There you can find Artists and designers making high end quality work.

In Paramount Classics's first horror movie, which marks the company's expansion from acquisitions into the production arena, the cast includes Nora Zehetner (Brick, May, R.S.V.P., Everwood) and Matthew Settle (U-571, Band of Brothers). Shooting started 2005 in Vancouver, the film was released on DVD August 7, 2007. It was the first direct-to-video title produced by MTV Films. Plot On the way home from visiting her parents' grave, Christy (Nora Zehetner) crashes her car into a rock. The impact throws Christy to safety, but her older sister, Vanessa (Carly Pope), is trapped inside when the car explodes. Vanessa initially survives, though disfigured and completely burnt. Christy is sent to Pine Bluff Psychiatric Care Center for treatment while her sister is treated by her husband Dr. John Locke (Matthew Settle), at home with the assistance of the nurse Claire Wells (Eliza Norbury), and his rather stern mother, Mrs Locke (Gabrielle Rose). When Vanessa has a heart attack and dies, Christy has a breakdown at the funeral service screaming that her sister is alive in the coffin. Christy moves to California for pre-med, but remains haunted by nightmares and weird visions. Six years later, Christy returns to Edgemont for a funeral. Vanessa's husband and mother-in-law regard her coldly, but Amy (Jessica Amlee), Christy's niece who is afraid of \\"dark things\\" behind the walls of the house, asks her to stay. Christy experiences blackouts and strange visions, the most prominent of which features a scarred, burnt woman clawing at a lid. She decides to investigate the death of her sister that she believes had been buried alive. The locals believe she has borderline personality disorder. She befriends a cop, Jeff (Warren Christie), and discovers that her sister was treated in the house's basement, which had tunnels connecting it to the rest of the house. She visits the father of Claire Wells, the nurse who treated her sister, who tells her the Lockes are evil and ruined Claire's life, and that Claire broke relations with her family and left the state after Vanessa died. Meanwhile, Christy's premonition that Mrs. Locke will die comes true. Amy tells Christy about a monster which comes into her room through the wardrobe while she is sleeping and touches her cheek. While in Amy's bedroom, Christy hears noises from the wardrobe. She travels through a tunnel connecting the wardrobe and the basement and has another blackout and when she wakes, she discovers John next to her with scratches on his cheek. He threatens to press charges if she does not leave the house immediately. In the Lockes' boathouse, Christy finds a love letter from John to Claire revealing an affair between them and suggesting that Vanessa's death would be best for everyone. Christy is convinced that John and Claire gave Vanessa medication to induce her heart attack. Christy shares her findings with Jeff. They visit the hospital staff connected to Vanessa's treatment, and a doctor tells them that Vanessa's treatment had been controlled entirely by John and Claire. He also says Vanessa's murder would be impossible to prove because her body would have decomposed completely by now, making an autopsy impossible. However, Christy points out that the coffin's lid would contain Vanessa's scratch marks, proving she was alive at the time of her burial. No one, including Jeff, believes Christy. Nonetheless, Christy opens Vanessa's coffin herself and is shocked to see it unscathed. Christy returns to the house and apologizes to John. She is about to leave when she gets a phone call from Jeff and realizes that the woman buried was not her sister but Claire Wells. John attacks Christy but she shoots him with his gun. Christy searches the house again and discovers an underground cellar wherein lies a badly burnt and disfigured womanVanessa. Vanessa does not recognize Christy and attacks her until she sees the necklace Christy is wearinga present from Vanessa. Vanessa cannot speak, but Christy assures her and promises to take care of her. Christy realizes that her visions were of Vanessa scratching the cellar trap. Vanessa had traveled through the house's tunnels, discovered the affair, and killed Claire. She had also killed Mrs Locke and would visit her daughter through the wardrobe. Vanessa and Christy share a moment, when Amy suddenly appears. Amy stabs Vanessa, unaware she is her mother, in order to kill \\"the monster\\". In the last scene, Christy scatters Vanessa's ashes into a lake. Amy takes a picture and there is a vision of Vanessa prior to her accident, staring at her killer.

It forms one side of the Seathwaite Valley, and on the western side it is flanked by the hanging valley of Gillercomb. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horsehoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Base Brown is a near neighbour of Great Gable, also bordering onto the Southern Fells. Great Gable and its lesser companion Green Gable stand at the head of Ennerdale, with the walkers' pass of Sty Head to their backs. Base Brown is the summit of the north east ridge of Green Gable, standing out into Borrowdale. All of Base Brown's waters ultimately reach this valley, passing via Derwentwater to the sea at Workington. A steep and rough slope descends north east from the summit of Green Gable, dropping through Mitchell Cove to the flat-topped and rather damp col of Blackmoor Pols (1,995 ft). Beyond this the ground rises again to the steep sided dome of Base Brown. On the south eastern face are crags overlooking Styhead Gill with Seathwaite Fell across the valley. The north western flanks are equally steep, but descending only half the vertical distance into the hanging valley of Gillercomb. This is the gathering ground of Sour Milk Gill, which drops over a series of falls around the northern extremity of Base Brown. Here it joins Styhead Gill and Grains Gill to form the nascent River Derwent. Across Gillercomb is the main ridge continuing north around Ennerdale, Brandreth being the initial fell. The top of Base Brown narrows considerably to the north of the summit, a prow-like ridge descending toward the falls of Sour Milk Gill. There is a prominent hanging stone here, startlingly poised over the rim of the crags. Another feature is the Seathwaite Slabs, a set of slabs of rocks used for rock climbing practice by novices and conveniently located only minutes from Seathwaite. Geology Base Brown, with Sourmilk Gill to its right. The crags on either face of Base Brown display rocks of the Crinkle Member of the Airy's Bridge Formation. This consists mainly of welded rhyolitic lapilli-tuff and tuff, with some breccia. There are also minor intrusions of andesite above Styhead Gill. The summit dome is overlain by till.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Summit Although surrounded by crags, the summit itself is of grass with a few boulders. A cairn marks the highest point. The view is restricted by higher neighbours, but the view north east down Borrowdale takes in Skiddaw and the Helvellyn range. The northern face of the Scafells is also seen in close up in the opposite direction. Water in view from the summit is restricted to Derwentwater and part of Styhead Tarn. Ascents The east face of Base Brown Base Brown is often passed on the way to Sty Head and Esk Hause, along the popular paths which start at Seathwaite. Base Brown is itself almost exclusively climbed from this hamlet, via the cascades of Sour Milk Gill. Once the foot of Gillercomb is reached a choice presents itself. Either the walker can continue up the gill to reach Blackmoor Pols and then make an easy traverse back to the summit, or a direct line can be taken up the north ridge. Base Brown can be used as the first step to climbing Green and Great Gable.Bill Birkett:Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): References Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls Category:Allerdale ","title":"Base Brown"},{"id":"3932168","text":"Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AAION or arteritic AION) is the cause of vision loss that occurs in temporal arteritis (aka giant-cell arteritis). Temporal arteritis is an inflammatory disease of medium-sized blood vessels that happens especially with advancing age. AAION occurs in about 15-20 percent of patients with temporal arteritis. Damage to the blood vessels supplying the optic nerves leads to insufficient blood supply (ischemia) to the nerve and subsequent optic nerve fiber death. Most cases of AAION result in nearly complete vision loss first to one eye. If the temporal arteritis is left untreated, the fellow eye will likely suffer vision loss as well within 1‚Äì2 weeks. Arteritic AION falls under the general category of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, which also includes non-arteritic AION. AION is considered an eye emergency, immediate treatment is essential to rescue remaining vision. An exhaustive review article published in March 2009 described the latest information on arteritic and non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, both anterior (A-AION and NA-AION) and posterior (A-PION, NA-PION, and surgical).Sohan Hayreh, \\"Ischemic optic neuropathy\\", Progress in Retinal and Eye Research (2009) 28(1):34-62.  Symptoms  There are several constitutional symptoms of temporal arteritis that may aid in diagnosis of AAION such as jaw claudication (spasms of the jaw muscle), scalp tenderness, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, myalgias and loss of appetite. However, many cases are asymptomatic. There are also elevations in three blood tests that help identify AAION: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP) and platelet count (thrombocytosis). A related rheumatic disease called polymyalgia rheumatica has a 15 percent incidence of giant cell arteritis. Cause Diagnosis Prompt diagnosis is critical, since the sudden blindness in the one eye is often followed, within days, by similar sudden blindness in the second eye. Treatment may prevent further damage (see below). Any patient diagnosed with non-arteritic AION over the age of 50 must be asked about the constitutional symptoms mentioned above. Furthermore, AION patients over the age of 75 should often be blood tested regardless.  Treatment  AAION requires urgent and critical intervention with a very long course of corticosteroids to prevent further damage. While this treatment is in itself problematic, non-treatment leads to bilateral blindness and strokes. There is much research currently underway looking at ways to protect the nerve (neuroprotection) or even regenerate new fibers within the optic nerve.

Merrie Melodies cartoon, starring Bugs Bunny. It was released on July 3, 1943, and was written by Tedd Pierce and directed by Chuck Jones. Plot The cartoon opens with two castaways adrift on a small raft in the middle of the ocean, underscored with \\"Asleep in the Deep\\". Delirious from hunger, they start imagining each other, and even their own limbs, as food. They spot an island in the distance and rush ashore where they meet Bugs Bunny. To his friendly, \\"What's the good word, strangers?\\" they answer, \\"FOOD!\\" Subsequently, they set up a cooking pot and start chasing after Bugs, as he swings away on a vine. Chasing Bugs through the jungle, the castaways spy him, semi-disguised as an island native, dancing. He welcomes them, \\"Ah! White Men! Welcome to Humuhumunukunukuapua'a'a'a Island.\\" He then speaks in Polynesian-accented nonsense, a long stretch of which is subtitled simply, \\"What's up, Doc?\\" and a very short segment is subtitled, \\"Now is the time for every good man to come to the aid of his party.\\" Bugs then begins a traditional-style dance, punctuated with drumming and chanting. The men join in until the tall, skinny man, seeing Bugs stop and walk away, gives his pal a slap (off-camera, following the Hays Office rules) to make him quit. A page in an information booklet is shown to be headed: Native Customs, and goes on to explain that 'The natives are skilled at diving for coins dropped into the water'. The men drop a coin into the cooking pot's boiling water; Bugs dashes in and steals the entire pot. While Bugs takes a bath in the hot water, the men set up a dining table; the short, fat one bastes the rabbit. They begin singing, \\"We're gonna have roast rabbit\\". Bugs sings too, until he realizes he is the roast rabbit and climbs speedily up into a treehouse. He then tricks the castaways by lowering a skinned chicken into the cooking pot. He taunts them with the chicken, using it as a marionette and giving it a voice, in order to make the two think it is somehow alive. The strings eventually tangle and, as Bugs struggles with it, the chicken is actually manipulated to point up, tipping off the men. They yank Bugs from the treehouse; there is an intense, brief struggle and, in the end Bugs escapes with the meat of the chicken. As the castaways wail in frustration, they hear a steam whistle from a ship. Once the men leap for joy at the prospect of being saved and trot toward the gangplank, Bugs kisses them goodbye and presents them with leis, then pulls his time-honored switcheroo trick and boards the ship himself. The boat pulls out, leaving the two men on the island, waving goodbye to Bugs. Realizing they have been tricked, the Skinny Man slaps the Fat Man (again, off-camera) for continuing to shout, \\"Goodbye!\\" The two at once imagine each other as a hot dog and a hamburger and chase each other into the distance. Production notes Wackiki Wabbit contains an experimental use of strongly graphic, nearly abstract backgrounds. The title is read by Arthur Q. Bryan and is a double play on words, with \\"Wackiki\\" suggesting both the island setting (as in \\"Waikiki\\") as well as suggesting \\"wacky\\" (crazy) along with the usual Elmer Fudd speech pronunciation of \\"rabbit\\", although Elmer does not appear in this picture. Airings On TV airings, the part where Bugs speaks to the Hawaiian castaways contains a blue border appearing on both United States and Europe Turner 1995 prints such as Cartoon Network. Home media Wackiki Wabbit is currently in the public domain after United Artists (which absorbed Associated Artists Productions) failed to renew the copyright.

(2013). \\"≈åtori Keisuke\\" in Japan at War: An Encyclopedia, p. 304. Biography =Early life and education= ≈åtori Keisuke was born in Akamatsu Village, in the Ak≈ç domain of Harima Province (modern-day Hy≈çgo), the son of physician Kobayashi Naosuke. At a young age, he entered the Shizutani school in Bizen, engaging in Chinese studies, and continued his education at the renowned Rangaku school of Ogata K≈çan, where he studied Dutch language and medicine. Further learning was obtained in Edo, where ≈åtori travelled to attend the school of Tsuboi Tadamasu, known for instructing students engaged in the study and translation of Dutch. While in Edo he also received education from Egawa Tar≈çzaemon regarding military strategy, and studied English with Nakahama Manjir≈ç, thus coming into possession of an uncommonly thorough, for his era, appreciation of Western culture. As a result, in 1859, the Tokugawa shogunate appointed him as an instructor to its Kaiseijo institute, and it was from there that ≈åtori entered the shogunate army. =Time in the Tokugawa Army= After entering the Tokugawa army, ≈åtori displayed promise as a student, quickly becoming a senior instructor of infantry tactics. After a period spent as a student of Jules Brunet in Yokohama, learning specifics of French infantry tactics, he was promoted to (), a rank equivalent to a four-star general in a modern Western army. ≈åtori used his status as a respected scholar of Western studies to take the rather unexpected step of making suggestions on governmental reform to the Sh≈çgun. In 1864, he issued a petition expressing his views on the benefits of a bicameral legislature to the government. In his position with the military, ≈åtori was able to create of an elite brigade, the Densh≈´tai, modeled after advice provided by strategists attached to the 1867‚Äì68 French military mission to Japan. Consisting of 800 men, the Densh≈´tai's members were chosen on the basis of capability rather than background; a matter of particular determination for ≈åtori, who remained mindful of his own relatively humble birth. =Boshin War= In the aftermath of military failure at the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi in early 1868, Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu returned to Edo and expressed serious consideration towards pledging allegiance to the new Meiji government. Otori and Oguri Tadamasa did not intend to lay down their arms without battle, and indicated their intention to continue the war but, following the surrender of Edo Castle, ≈åtori gathered 500 men of the Shogunate Army at H≈ç'on-ji Temple in Asakusa, and left Edo. Upon arriving in Ichikawa he joined with Hijikata Toshiz≈ç of the Shinsengumi, Akizuki T≈çnosuke of Aizu, Tatsumi Naofumi of Kuwana, and others, expanding his force to 2000 men. Dividing the infantry into three groups, he ordered them to attack. One unit was marched towards Nikk≈ç, defeating an Imperial Army detachment on the way at Koyama in Shimotsuke Province. The detached unit under Hijikata had also defeated an Imperial army force at Utsunomiya Castle, and proceeded to enter the castle by way of Koyama. Ultimately, however, for ≈åtori Keisuke, there would be no more military victories. Upon reaching the domain seat of Wakamatsu, ≈åtori's men mounted a fighting retreat while defending the western approaches to Aizu. In his search for reinforcements, ≈åtori unsuccessfully petitioned Matsudaira Katamori to gather peasants from the surrounding villages and, although continuing to remain in the vicinity of Wakamatsu for some time, was eventually forced to retreat in the face of an advance from the Imperial Army, making his way to Sendai. There he met with Enomoto Takeaki, who had arrived in Matsushima Bay with six warships of the former Shogunate. Boarding these ships, the force headed for Hakodate, Hokkaid≈ç. Soon afterward, the Republic of Ezo was established, and as a result of the first attempt at democratic elections that Japan had ever seen, ≈åtori was elected Minister of the Army. However, in terms of battlefield experience, ≈åtori was expert mostly in theory; while his second-in-command Hijikata Toshiz≈ç was far more experienced in combat, and ≈åtori's awkwardness, as well as his tendency to laugh and say Mata maketa yo! (\\"Oh I lost again!\\") in the face of defeat gave him a bad reputation with his men. In the Battle of Hakodate when the Imperial Army surrounded the Gory≈çkaku fortress, Enomoto Takeaki wanted to go down fighting; however, it was ≈åtori who suggested a peaceful surrender, changing Enomoto's mind with his words of \\"If it's dying you want you can do it anytime.\\" ≈åtori was taken into custody and transferred to a prison in Tokyo; a building which ironically he had built himself as ≈ådaira-mae Infantry Barracks. =Later life= While in prison, ≈åtori continued to make use of his knowledge of Western learning, to the benefit of his fellow prisoners. An anecdote recounts that during his imprisonment, he not only reformed the bad habits of the prison director, but also managed to institute a parliamentary system amongst the prisoners. After his release in 1872, ≈åtori agreed to work in the Meiji government, first becoming involved in land reclamation, and later becoming president of the Gakush≈´in Peers' School in 1886. In 1889, ≈åtori was sent as an ambassador to China's Qing dynasty and Korea's Joseon dynasty. He also had an instrumental role in the opening of the First Sino- Japanese War. ≈åtori was also involved in efforts to preserve history. Beginning in 1898, he assisted with the editing and publication of the magazine Ky≈´ Bakufu, which focused on archiving memoirs and accounts of the former Shogunate by the men who had made up its ranks. He also contributed to the building of a monument to the war dead in Hakodate. ≈åtori Keisuke died from esophageal cancer two months after his 78th birthday.

The squadron, known as the \\"Blue Knights\\", is based at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 26 (MAG-26) and the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW). Mission Provide assault support of combat troops, supplies, and equipment during amphibious operations and subsequent operations ashore. History =Vietnam War= Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 365 was established on July 1, 1963 at Marine Corps Air Facility Santa Ana, California. Flying UH-34Ds, the squadron's mission was to provide assault transport of troops and cargo in support of Fleet Marine Forces during ship-to-shore movements. HMM-365 was reassigned to Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Okinawa in August 1964 in preparation for the squadron's deployment to the Republic of Vietnam. The squadron arrived at Da Nang Air Base on October 7, 1964 and immediately began performing re-supply missions in support of Operation Shufly. USS Boxer off Puerto Rico, 1966. On October 11, the newly arrived Marine pilots and aircrews were involved in their first firefight when 8 UH-34Ds drew Viet Cong fire while landing a 112-man Vietnamese unit in the hills west-southwest of Tam Ky. On October 26, the Blue Knights suffered their first combat casualties when a copilot and crew chief were wounded by Viet Cong small arms fire while their helicopter was approaching an enemy contested landing zone southwest of Tam Ky. The pilot was able to return the damaged aircraft to Tam Ky and land safely. In early November, at the height of the monsoon season, Typhoon Iris struck the Vietnamese Coast. The hazardous weather conditions caused flight operations to be suspended except for emergency medical evacuations. When flight operations resumed on November 10, the crews concentrated on rescuing Vietnamese civilians from the inundated coastal plains. Between 1700 and 1900 on their first day of flood relief operations, HMM-365 rescued 144 flood victims. Many of the rescues were accomplished by hoisting individuals from precarious positions in trees or on rooftops while being subjected to sporadic Viet Cong harassing fire. At the end of a 72-hour time period the Blue Knights had successfully rescued over 1,500 flood victims. Meanwhile, other squadron members were modifying three helicopters to carry a new weapons system. The TK-1, an externally mounted combination of M-60 machine guns and rocket launchers, that was first used in support of a Tiger Flight mission conducted just south of the Song Thu Bon, about from Da Nang. Two armed UH-34Ds expended 90 rockets and 500 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition on enemy positions during pre- landing strikes. The squadron executed similar operations the following day.

In April 1989, HMM-365 began its second deployment as the Aviation Combat Element for the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. . =1990s= Four months later, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, HMM-365 embarked aboard the USS Guam for Operation Desert Shield. On January 6, 1991, while en route to Iraq, HMM-365 and HMM-263 conducted Operation Eastern Exit, the Non-combatant Evacuation (NEO) of the American Embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia. The NEO was successful with 281 American and foreign nationals being safely evacuated. Operation Desert Storm began on February 17. On 26 February the Blue Knights conducted a night time, long-range mission in support of the amphibious demonstration against Bubiyan Island. A cease-fire went into effect on February 28, and the Blue Knights returned to MCAS New River. While deployed in 1992, the Amphibious Ready Group moved into the Adriatic Sea to support Operation Provide Promise. On September 3, while on station near the coast, the Blue Knights launched a Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and personnel (TRAP) mission into Yugoslavia following the downing of an Italian cargo aircraft carrying relief supplies into Sarajevo.

From March 20 until May 1, the squadron provided CASEVAC and assault support to I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF), the 24th MEU, the 15th MEU, Task Force Tarawa, and United Nations forces. Blue Knight crews flew multiple raids and recon inserts as ground forces maneuvered north towards Baghdad. Due to the expeditious nature of I MEF's battle rhythm, section detachments were configured into combat crews and pushed forward with coalition forces in order to provide 24-hour support. Blue Knight aircrews flew 200 to missions across the Kuwaiti border, into Iraq, to conduct relief operations with other sections for up to a week at a time. The squadron supported I MEF operations from Ali Al Salem until mid-April when it re- deployed itself in a single day to Jalibah FOB, Iraq where it rejoined MAG-29. The squadron conducted flight operations from Iraq until May 10, when the squadron embarked aboard USS Kearsarge. After supporting the President's visit to Egypt and Jordan, the USS Kearsarge transited to Liberia for possible NEO operations. The Blue Knights returned to New River on June 28, 2003. On August 7, 2004, HMM-365's main body departed New River, NC for Al Asad Air Base, Iraq. On August 21, the squadron assumed the assault support mission from HMM-261. On November 25, the Blue Knights flew the Secretary of the Navy, the honorable Gordon R. England. On the 13th and 14 December the squadron flew the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Michael Hagee, to Al Taqaddum and Fallujah.

In August 2005, in the wake of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, the Blue Knights dispatched two aircraft and personnel to the Gulf Coast of the United States to conduct search-and-rescue and disaster relief operations in support of JTF Katrina. Later that year on November 2, 2005, the squadron had the first CH-46E Sea Knight to be retired and stored in the Boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base some 41 years after the first CH-46 entered the fleet. In May 2006, the squadron deployed aboard the USS Iwo Jima as the ACE for the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. While conducting training operations in Jordan, the squadron was ordered to the coast of Beirut for Non-Combatant Evacuation operations at the American Embassy in Beirut. Also during this deployment, the squadron conducted training in Kuwait for two weeks. Squadron aircraft also supported operations in the Horn of Africa. In April 2008, HMM-365(REIN) deployed as the aviation combat element of the 24th MEU. The MEU was subsequently sent into Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom where their aircraft have been spread out and based out of Kandahar Airfield and Camps Bastion and Dwyer which are over 100 miles away. During the course of this deployment they have been tasked with supporting the MEU and also the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and local Afghan forces. They logged over 3,000 combat sorties during this deployment. The squadron was redesignated as Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 365 on January 15, 2009 after completing their conversion to the MV-22 Osprey. VMM-365 is the fifth squadron aboard MCAS New River to transition to the Osprey.‚ÄòBlue Knights‚Äô take on new mission with new CO In January 2012, only eleven months after returning from a successful deployment to Afghanistan, VMM-365 returned to Camp Bastion to conduct combat operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. During the month of April, the squadron conducted 35 Named Operations and increased that number to 39 in May and 42 in June. VMM-365 flew in support of 193 Named Operations over the course of the seven-month deployment. By comparison, the squadron conducted just 10 Named Operations during OEF 10.2. In addition to successfully supporting an average of one Named Operation per day, the squadron moved 36,047 passengers and 769,102 pounds of cargo across the battle space while conducting General Support missions. VMM-365 in Afghanistan 2012 The squadron expanded the accepted capabilities of the MV-22 by operating across the spectrum of Assault Support and displaying wide-ranging and flexible skill sets. Centering on the primary mission of a VMM, the Blue Knights conducted conventional insertion/extraction operations, narcotic raids, Aerial Reaction Forces, and Aerial Interdiction. On 25 March 2012, a flight of six Blue Knight Ospreys conducted the largest tiltrotor-borne insert in history by inserting 594 coalition personnel in support of Operation JAWS. VMM-365 also launched flights of three or more aircraft on 48 different occasions, to include 17 flights of five or more aircraft. Conducting long- range Casualty Evacuation missions within the critical ‚ÄúGolden Hour,‚Äù leaflet drops in support of psychological operations, battlefield illumination missions for other MV-22s, and developing & operating as a Command and Control platform during three battalion-level operations are examples of some of the wide-ranging and innovative operations the Blue Knights successfully executed. The maintenance department's Emergency Reclamation Team was tested on several occasions; to include, 27 June 2012 when two separate aircraft received significant battle damage after inserting 1st Reconnaissance Battalion Marines to a tactical landing zone. One of these aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing to a nearby FOB after taking 12 enemy medium machine gun rounds. Less than 18 hours later, VMM-365 fixed the damaged aircraft and flew safely back to Camp Bastion. Throughout the deployment, the Blue Knights were engaged by enemy fire 26 times, returned fire 12 times, and sustained battle damage to five aircraft. VMM-365 aerial refueling during SPMAGTF-CR 2013 Six of the squadron's MV-22Bs self-deployed to Mor√≥n Air Base on 27 April 2013, as part of the Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force‚ÄìCrisis Response. On May 27, 2014 VMM-365 went composite with HMLA-269, HMH-461, MWSS-272, MACG-28, MALS-26 and MALS-29 and was redesignated VMM-365(REIN) in support of 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. Three months later, VMA-231 and MALS-14 joined the ACE resulting in more than 500 Marines and sailors attached to VMM-365(REIN). Of the 29 aircraft assigned, the ACE can employ (12) MV-22B, (4) CH-53E, (4) AH-1W, (3) UH-1Y, and (6) AV-8B. Additionally the ACE can employ multiple Low Altitude Air Defense teams and aircraft controllers. On December 12, 2014 VMM-365(REIN) deployed with 24 MEU, Amphibious Squadron 8 and the USS Iwo Jima Amphibious Readiness Group. On July 16, 2015 VMM-365(REIN) returned from deployment with 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The Blue Knights expertly stood the alert, ready to respond. The ACE supported multiple bilateral exercises in 6th and 5th Fleet areas of responsibility, conducted combat missions in Iraq in support of Operation INHERENT RESOLVE, assisted with the evacuation of US Embassies in Yemen in both San'na and Aden, supported multiple US Ambassador visits to Aden, Yemen, and served as an airborne deterrence force against surface ships delivering lethal weapons to Huthi rebels in Yemen. In the seven-month deployment, the squadron flew more than 3,500 hours and maintained the highest overall aircraft readiness rate of any Aviation Combat Element since deploying with the MV-22B Osprey.

The molecule can be viewed as the fusion of naphthalene and benzene unit connected by a five- membered ring. Although samples are often pale yellow, the compound is colorless. It is soluble in nonpolar organic solvents.Karl Griesbaum, Arno Behr, Dieter Biedenkapp, Heinz-Werner Voges, Dorothea Garbe, Christian Paetz, Gerd Collin, Dieter Mayer, Hartmut H√∂ke ‚ÄúHydrocarbons‚Äù in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. It is a member of the class of PAHs known as non-alternant PAHs because it has rings other than those with six carbon atoms. It is a structural isomer of the alternant PAH pyrene. It is not as thermodynamically stable as pyrene. Its name is derived from its fluorescence under UV light. Occurrence =Coal tar= Fluoranthene was originally isolated from coal tar pitch. It is still obtained from the high boiling fraction of coal tar, representing a few percent by weight. =Pollutant= Fluoranthene is found in many combustion products, along with other PAHs. Its presence is an indicator of less efficient or lower-temperature combustion, since non-alternant PAHs are less preferred in formation than alternant PAHs. Fluoranthene is one of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 16 priority pollutant PAHs. Fluoranthene has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 3 carcinogen, \\"not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans\\"[1] , however it was found to possess carcinogenic properties in case of newborn mice according to short-term lung tumor assay (Busby et al., 1984). In 2019, fluoranthene was added to the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs) due to its persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) and very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) properties.

It is common in much of North America, reported from all 10 Canadian provinces plus Nunavut and Northwest Territories, as well as from the northeastern and Great Lakes states in the United States. It is also known to occur in Montana and Washington. Description Vaccinium myrtilloides is a low spreading deciduous shrub growing up to 50 cm (20 inches) tall, often spreading to form small thickets. The leaves are bright green, paler underneath with velvety hairs. The flowers are white, bell-shaped, 5 mm (0.2 inches) long. The fruit is a small sweet bright blue to dark blue berry. Young stems have stiff dense bristly hairs. Vaccinium myrtilloides grows best in open coniferous woods with dry loose acidic soils; it is also found in forested bogs and rocky areas. It is fire-tolerant and is often abundant following forest fires or clear-cut logging. Vaccinium myrtilloides hybridizes in the wild with Vaccinium angustifolium (lowbush blueberry). Characteristics Vaccinium myrtilloides is also cultivated and grown commercially in Canada and Maine, mainly harvested from managed wild patches. Vaccinium myrtilloides is one of the sweetest blueberries known. It is also an important food source for black bears, deer, small mammals, and birds.

This has now changed. The metropolitan area of Adelaide, South Australia is served by a wide variety of transport. Being centrally located on the Australian mainland, it forms a hub for east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth routes. The road network includes major expressways such as the Southern Expressway, the South Eastern Freeway, the Port River Expressway, the Northern Expressway and the South Road Superway. The city also has a public transport system managed by Adelaide Metro, consisting of a contracted bus system including the O-Bahn Busway (a guided busway), six metropolitan railway lines, and the Glenelg-Adelaide-Hindmarsh Tram. According to a study conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Adelaide has the highest passenger vehicle travel to work (84%) and the second lowest proportion of people walking to work (2.9%)‚Äìsomething that is being combated by the South Australian government in an effort to increase citizen ridership and use of public transport. Roads Mount Osmond Interchange on the South Eastern Freeway. Road transport in Adelaide has historically been comparatively easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Adelaide has been called a \\"twenty-minute city\\", with commuters having been able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in twenty minutes or less. However, the Royal Automobile Association now considers these roads are inadequate to cope with Adelaide's growing road traffic volumes. In 1964 the 'M.A.T.S.' plan (Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study) was commissioned by the Government of South Australia. It examined establishing a large network of highways along Adelaide's main urban transport corridors. The plan went as far as the State Government of the day purchasing land along Adelaide's major roads, in preparation for highway construction. However, later State Governments abandoned the plan during the 1970s. The consequences of the political rejection of this plan are now being realised as increased traffic has caused travel times to increase, and congestion on main thoroughfares such as South Road has become a daily reality. Adelaide is connected to Port Wakefield Road and the Sturt Highway in the north, and the South Eastern Freeway in the South East. The Southern Expressway acts as a bypass for congested South Road in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. Bus A Custom Coaches bodied Scania bus on King William Street; one of Adelaide's main thoroughfares. The focus of Adelaide's public transport system is the large fleet of diesel and natural gas powered buses. The majority of services terminate at the city-centre or at a suburban interchange. Buses get priority on many roads and intersections, with dedicated bus lanes and 'B'-light bus-only phases at many traffic lights. The Adelaide Metro buses are operated by:Minister for Transport ‚Äì Report on the Adelaide Metro Bus Service Contracts, August 2011, retrieved 2011-12-03. *Torrens Transit ‚Äì East-West (includes City Free), Outer North East and Outer North contract areas *Torrens Connect ‚Äì North-South contract area, including the 300 suburban connector and O-Bahn services and the light rail *SouthLink ‚Äì Hills contract area *Busways - Outer South contract area The O-Bahn Busway is one of a few guided busways in the world. With large growth in the North- eastern Suburbs of Adelaide in the 1970s and 1980s, when Adelaide was faced with a transport dilemma. The Adelaide O-Bahn was constructed in 1986 in response, after beating competing proposals of expanded rail and road networks. (One of the competing proposals was to build an Adelaide underground transport system, but proved to be cost-ineffective in comparison). Interstate bus routes to and from all the major Australian towns and cities connect to Adelaide. The main terminus for intra and interstate coach-liners is the Adelaide Central bus station on the corner of Franklin and Bowen Streets in the city-centre. Beginning in 2005, the terminal is to undergo a complete $25 million reconstruction, in conjunction with the much larger $375 million former Balfours site redevelopment ‚Äì the end-product being a new multistorey bus station and various residential and commercial towers. The Tindo (\\"Tindo\\", Kaurna word for sun) solar bus is an experimental battery electric vehicle that operates in Adelaide. It uses 100% solar power, is equipped with a regenerative braking system and air conditioning and can carry up to 40 persons, 25 of whom are seated. Hailed as the world's first bus service powered exclusively by solar power, the bus service connects Adelaide City and North Adelaide as part of Adelaide City's sustainable transport agenda. The Tindo is part of Adelaide's Free bus services, operated under the call signs, 98A and 98C (until very recently known as the Adelaide Connector bus service). Other Free services in Adelaide include the City Loop, operating under callsigns 99C and 99A, formerly known as 99C only. The 99B, the Beeline, was another free service which ran until 2007, when the Glenelg tram line extension was finally inaugurated. 97A and 97C are new services which started when the new Royal Adelaide Hospital opened. It connects the old one with the new one. Its route includes North Terrace, Currie and Grenfell Streets.https://www.premier.sa.gov.au/index.php/stephen-mullighan-news- releases/7879-new-public-transport-arrangements-to-service-the-new-royal- adelaide-hospital The service has now ceased, due to a tram operating in the same intended purpose. Rail An ‚ÄòA-City Class‚Äô Electric Multiple Unit at Goodwood, also known as the 4000 class While Adelaide's suburban passenger- rail network does not suffer the chronic delays of its inter-state counterparts, it is comparatively under-developed; Adelaide is the last mainland capital with a non-electric network, with a 10-year $2 billion transport program commencing in 2008‚Äì09 to rebuild and electrify the network. However, only the Seaford and Tonsley lines were electrified, being completed in 2014. After being announced and canceled multiple times, the electrification of the full Gawler line is due for completion in late 2020. Adelaide is also the midpoint of the long distance Indian Pacific service between Perth and Sydney, as well as the terminus of The Overland to Melbourne and The Ghan to Alice Springs and Darwin. In 1968, a rapid transit metro system was proposed in Adelaide underneath King William Street along with a series of freeways, however it was scrapped due to public protest about the \\"Americanisation\\" of the city. As part of the sweeping Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study plan of 1968, the subway would have included three underground rapid train stations, including one at Hindley Street, with a shopping centre on the level between the street and the rail line. An Alstom Citadis on North Terrace In late 2005 the State Government released a State Infrastructure Plan. This saw a A$56 million upgrade of the Adelaide's sole remaining tramway, from the city centre to the historic beachside resort of Glenelg. The tram line was extended from the city centre to the railway station ( and then to new terminus in the inner north-west suburb of Hindmarsh). In 2017 and 2018 a junction was created at the corner of North Terrace and King William Street with a stub track leading north to one more stop near the River Torrens and to the eastern end of North Terrace. There are now fifteen Bombardier Flexity Classic Light Rail vehicles and nine Alstom Citadis (model 302) in service. Construction of a new junction, branch lines along the eastern end of North Terrace and King William Road and four new stops began in July/August 2017 and opened on 13 October 2018. Air The Adelaide Airport, located near West Beach, is Australia's newest and most advanced airport terminal and is designed to serve in excess of 6.8 million passengers annually. The new dual international/domestic terminal replaced the old and ageing terminals known locally as the 'tin sheds', and incorporates new state-of-the-art features, such as glass aerobridges and the ability to cater for the new Airbus A380. The airport is designed to handle 27 aircraft simultaneously and it is capable of processing 3,000 passengers per hour. It was officially opened in a ceremony in October 2005 by Governor Marjorie Jackson-Nelson, Premier Mike Rann and Prime Minister John Howard. Due to problems with the new refuelling system, the new airport terminal was not used for interstate domestic flights until 17 February 2006. Parafield Airport is Adelaide's second airport, mostly used for general aviation. It is located 18 kilometres north of the CBD was Adelaides main airport for many years. RAAF Base Edinburgh is located 25 km north of the Adelaide CBD andis used by the military. Adelaide public transportation statistics The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Adelaide, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 65 min. 20.6% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 13.4% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8 km, while 15% travel for over 12 km in a single direction. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

He bought the monastery in Ambronay, of which he became abbot. In 810, after resistance, he became bishop of Vienne. Bernard, like many other clerics, supported the unity of the Frankish Empire. He took a position on the side of Lothair I against his father Louis the Pious, for which he was deposed in the Synod of Thionville, although this was never carried out.

The organization currently consists of about 54 local Nests and affiliated Auxiliaries located in 9 States in the eastern United States.  History  The Order was founded in Rochester, New York. The Order was originally named the Order of Owls, but another fraternal order of the name had a court issue an injunction against using that name.Preuss, Arthur A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co. 1924; republished Detroit: Gale Reference Company 1966; p.232 At its 1923 convention in Reading, Pennsylvania the delegates voted 241 to 8 for a modification of the Prohibition Amendment that would allow the manufacture of light wine and beers. They also decided to only vote for congressmen who were in favor of such a prohibition.Preuss p.134  Organization  As stated above, local unites are called \\"Subordinate Nests\\"; state or provincial groups are called \\"Grand Nests\\" and the national structure is the \\"Supreme Nest\\", which meets in convention annually. The head of the order is a \\"Supreme Worthy President\\" and the head of a local Nest is \\"Worthy President\\".Alvin J.

Women were eligible to join local auxiliary units connected to the local Nests.Schmidt p. 249 Had 143,000 members in 208 Nests the early 1920s,Preuss p.134 12,649 in 1979 in 57 Nests and 10,000 members \\"about a decade later\\".Alan Axelrod International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders New York; Facts on File, inc 1997 pp.191-2  Benefits  The Order benefits were allocated on an ad hoc basis for sickness, accident or injuries. This was not an insurance function, but more a form of charity that the Order was not obliged to pay.Schmidt p. 249  Ritual  The Order had a ritual that was meant to be secret. It resembled many of the other fraternal societies of the day, with an altar in the center of the lodge room, a Bible, and prayers. In addition to the Initiatory Degree, there was also a Supreme Degree, both awarded by the Supreme Nest.

Career Born and bred in Southampton, Chris Wilkinson has achieved much in the world of tennis. But it could have been very different as his first passion was football in which he excelled for Southampton and had trials for Aston Villa and Coventry. Wilkinson started his winning ways with tennis tournament success as a 10-year-old junior. From there Wilkinson went on to win national and overseas tournaments and represented Great Britain in the World Championships at all junior age groups. On the main Tour Wilkinson played some of his best tennis at Wimbledon where he reached the 3rd round in Singles on four occasions and made the quarter finals of Doubles. Wilkinson had the privilege of playing on Centre and No. 1 court on many occasions. He will probably be best remembered for his Centre Court battle in 1993 against Stefan Edberg, in which he broke the champion's serve no less than seven times before faltering on his own and succumbing to defeat in three close sets. His best win was over Goran Ivani≈°eviƒá in 1993 at Queen's. Wilkinson has recorded many notable wins over several top 20 world ranked players. Wimbledon continues to be a special place for the former British No. 1 and he is regularly invited to compete in the Gentleman's senior invitational event. In 1993 Wilkinson achieved his ambition of becoming British No. 1 Singles player. He has represented Great Britain in the Davis Cup and the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Wilkinson retired from the main tour in 1999 but kept up his competitive play in the following years and in 2005 became the British and world over-35 champion. Wilkinson is still very much involved with the sport, working with the LTA as a National Performance Coach/captain for the 12 to 16-year-old boys. In February 2018, he was appointed as County Performance Manager for Hampshire and Isle of Wight LTA. Wilkinson also remains very busy in the media world, including TV commentating for Eurosport, ATP media and ITV4. He also has a regular column with ESPN. As for playing tennis, Wilkinson is regularly invited to exhibition events where he often plays with some of the all-time greats of the tennis world. Wilkinson currently resides in Hampshire with his wife Amanda and their two daughters, Alice born in 1998 and Emily born in 2001.

He founded Wayne Feeds and Central Soya. He was known as Mr. Mac to friends, family, and coworkers. McMillen was born January 27, 1880 near Van Wert, Ohio. He enrolled in Oberlin College in 1899, hoping to become a lawyer, but had to return home in his sophomore year to run the family business, a grain elevator, when his father became seriously ill. He stayed on, becoming a partner with his father, until striking out on his own in 1916. Wayne Feeds Researchers at Ohio State University and other land-grant colleges were seeking to modernize the agricultural industry through their system of county extension agents, and one of the things they were promoting was better nutrition for livestock. Complete feeds, however, were pricey. McMillen viewed this as an opportunity. He bought a small elevator in Fort Wayne, Indiana, NW of Van Wert, and started Wayne Feeds to produce a concentrate of the protein, vitamins and minerals that were lacking in regular feed. A farmer would grind 70 pounds of his own grain with 30 pounds of the feed supplement to make a high-quality feed ration that could be profitably fed. At this time, there was a growing interest in soybeans. Soybeans are a legume; bacteria nodules on the roots of legumes turn atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia through a process called nitrogen \\"fixing\\", enriching the soil. This alone made soybeans useful in crop rotation, but soybeans were known to be high in protein and vegetable oil as well. The protein looked especially good to McMillen. A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company, established in 1922, was one of the first companies to succeed with soybean crushing mills. Another pioneer in the field was the American Milling Company in 1927. Wayne Feeds was profitable; American Milling had potential. They merged in 1929 to form Allied Mills, with McMillen as the first president. Allied Mills and Wayne Feeds are now part of Ridley Corporation, an Australian company. Central Sugar McMillen was used to calling the shots, and did not enjoy running Allied Mills. By 1933, he had left that company to start a new business in a new location and a new industry. He bought the old abandoned Central Sugar sugar beet plant in Decatur, Indiana, about south of Fort Wayne, refurbished it, and processed sugar in the 1934 season. Central Soya By building a soybean crushing facility next to the sugar plant, McMillen would have three important ingredients for animal feed: molasses for energy, soy meal for protein, and beet pulp for fiber. On October 2, 1934, McMillen incorporated the Central Soya Company, Inc., and a month later, he organized McMillen Feed Mills as a division of Central Soya to produce feed supplements under the brand name Master Mix. Initially, Central Soya used an expeller to extract oil from the crushed soybeans. This produced a low yield of low-quality oil. McMillen hired researcher Norman Kruse away from Procter & Gamble to head up a technical department. Kruse went to Germany in December 1936 to find the best solvent extractor. At that time, only two companies in the US used solvent extraction. Archer Daniels Midland had a 130-ton Hildebrandt extractor and Glidden had a 150-ton Hildebrandt extractor. McMillen and Kruse bought a 275-ton Hansa Muehle (paternoster or Bolmann-type) extractor. The Desolventizer-Toaster Raw soybean meal is neither very palatable nor very nutritious. An enzyme in the soy meal prevents utilization of the trypsin amino acid. These problems had to be solved for feed supplements - and Central Soya - to succeed. Hayword in 1937 reported that flavor and nutrition could be improved by heating the soy meal above for a period of time. However, Central Soya received a patent in 1941 for steam- processing meal for better results and for a desolventizer-toaster in 1952. These provided income to Central Soya for some years, as they were important inventions that were adopted throughout the industry. Lecithin Central Soya began production and distribution of soy lecithin in 1939 when E.B. Oberg arrived from The Glidden Company. By 1943, largely on the basis of Oberg's work, they were selling 20 million pounds yearly. Until that time, lecithin in the US meant egg lecithin. Central Soya's Centrolex lecithin is a light yellow granular product, compared to the viscous brown oil others sell. Central Soya leased Glidden's soybean business and bought it in 1961. Retirement McMillen retired from Central Soya in 1953. In 1967 Dale McMillen, then an active 86 years of age, was chosen an Honorary Life Member of the American Soybean Association. Wildcat Baseball McMillen, while watching little league tryouts, noticed the disappointment on the faces of the nine and ten- year-old boys that failed to make the team. This was too much for \\"Mr. Mac,\\" as he was called, to take. After discussions with other leaders, Mr. Mac organized a league for all boys who wanted to play organized baseball regardless of their skills, ability, race, creed, or religion. The league motto of ‚ÄúEverybody Makes the Team,‚Äù is a vital part of the philosophy of Mr. Mac and the Wildcat League. In 1961 the Wildcat League had its inaugural season. Originally 10 baseball sites were established. Area high school coaches were chosen as directors with college and high school students acting as assistants and junior assistants. The philosophy of the league was, and still is, to put as little pressure as possible on the participants. The emphasis is still on playing the game for ‚Äúfun‚Äù and focusing on fundamentals to increase the skill level of the players. Over 250,000 have participated in the Wildcat League since its inception.

They are considered ancestors of the ammonoids, as well as of the coleoids (octopus, squid, cuttlefish, and the extinct belemnites). Bactritids are distinguished from the more primitive nautiloids by the small size and globular shape of the protoconch, the so-called embryonic shell. Nautiloids have relatively large embryonic shells, and living species lay a few large eggs. In contrast, bactritids and ammonoids produced large numbers of small eggs, each housing a small embryonic shell.  Classification and description  Bactritida (Erben 1964) are characterized by orthoconic to cyrtochonic shells that may be long or short with a narrow siphuncle invariably in contact with the ventral wall and sutures uniformly with V-shaped ventral lobes. Septal necks are orthochoanitic to cyrtochoanitic, the apical angle may be small or large, and the protoconch is globular to egg-shaped. The Bactritida comprise two families, the Bactritidae and the Parabactritidae. =Bactritidae= The BactritidaeErben H.K. 1964; Bactritoidea, in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology Vol K Nautiloidea, K491 ‚Äì, Teichert, C and Moore R.C. Eds, GSA and Univ Kansas Press. 1964) are characterized by long orthoconic to cyrtochonic shells with a small apical angle (less than 10¬∞) and septal necks that are orthochoanitic. Chamber length is variable. The Bactritidae contain eight recognized genera. Bactrites has the longest range, from the Lower Devonian to the Upper Permian, and even possibly from the Silurian. The Bactritidae gave rise to the Ammonoidea in the Early Devonian starting with an early Bactrites and going with increasingly tight curvature from Lobobactrites to Cyrtobactrites, leading to the gyroconic Anetoceras of the Anarcestida (Ammonoidea).Klug, C. and Korn, D. 2004. The origin of ammonoid locomotion. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 49 (2): 235‚Äì242 =Parabactritidae= The Parabactritidae are characterized by orthoconic and breviconic shells with a large apical angle (greater than about 10¬∞) and septal necks that are vary from orthochoanitic or suborthochoanitic to cyrtochoanitic. The Parabactritidae contain some five described genera and are thought to have given rise to the Belemnoidea (Coleoidea). Derivation The Bactritida have their origin in the Orthocerida, nautiloid cephalopods that first appeared in the Ordovician. Bactroceras (Eobactrites), an early middle-Ordovician cephalopod, is considered as a true bactritid by some paleontologists, because of its spherical apex and ventral siphuncle. This view is challenged by more recent research. The shell of Bactroceras has important differences from those of true bactritids. For instance, the first chamber of Bactroceras resembles that of other Ordovician orthocerids, such as Archigeisonoceras and Hedstroemoceras: it is about 10 mm in diameter, and is short, forming a spherical cap. True bactritids more strongly resemble late Silurian and Devonian orthocerids, whose first chamber is only about 5 mm across. Moreover, a large stratigraphic gap of nearly 50 million years occurs between Bactroceras and the next orthocones with a spherical apex and ventral siphuncle.  Paleoecology and lifestyle Bactritids, especially the Bactritidae, seem to have lived in a vertical orientation, head down, as probably did many of the Orthocerida such as Michelinoceras and Buttsoceras, or these forms without extensive internal ballast may simply have been more flexible in their vertical orientation than the well-ballasted bottom-dwellers such as the actinocerids and endocerids. The ventral siphuncle of the Bactritida would have facilitated chamber dewatering in either horizontal or vertical orientation or in between. A central siphuncle would have made horizontal or near-horizontal dewatering more difficult, though. Bactritids, like cephalopods in general, were probably active predators with tentacles of some sort. As with other externally shelled forms, they were probably not active swimmers in the sense of fish or squid. Rather, they were likely stalkers and ambush predators hiding among the seaweeds, snatching prey found below.

He has an estimated net worth of US$1.3 billion stemming from investments in hotels, shopping centers and property. Stordalen owns Strawberry, a corporate group consisting of ten companies in real estate, finance, hotels and art. Through Strawberry Hospitality Group, Stordalen owns Nordic Choice Hotels, consisting of over 200 hotels and employing 17,000 people. In the later stages of his career, Stordalen has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors together with his ex-wife, doctor and environmentalist Gunhild Anker Stordalen, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations within environment/climate change and scientific research programs through the Stordalen Foundation, established in 2011.From October 2019 co-owner of SunClass Airlines. Early life and education Stordalen was born in Porsgrunn in Telemark, Norway to grocer Knut Anker Stordalen (1933‚Äì94) and Kari Stordalen. At the age of ten he began helping in his father's grocery store and at the age of twelve he began selling strawberries at the local market. He already then displayed his acumen for business, being named ‚ÄúNorway‚Äôs top strawberry seller‚Äù in the local paper, Porsgrunns Dagblad, in 1974, beating out his competition of 50- to 60-year-old market ladies. Following high school he attended Kj√∏pmannsinstituttet for one year, he then managed his father's store for a short time before going off to the Norwegian School of Marketing. Career =Shopping centers= At 24 he took over what was, at the time, the largest shopping center in Norway, City Syd, in Trondheim as the country's youngest shopping center manager. After posting record profits at City Syd he became property director in Atle Brynestad's company Made in. As property director Stordalen was the architect behind the conversion of the former market area in downtown Trondheim and the re-launch of Liertoppen shopping centre outside Oslo. He was also put in charge of the Bik Bok brand Following a number of transactions within the Brynestad system Stordalen, at the age of 29, found himself an employee of Realkreditt‚Äôs (later DnB) property development company. Together with a group of investors Stordalen bought the historical department store Steen & Str√∏m in downtown Oslo. The group recouped their investment of NOK 20 million in the first five days of the reopening. The purchase of Steen & Str√∏m signaled the start of a wave of acquisitions, and in the span of three years the newly formed company, Steen & Str√∏m Invest, became the country's largest holder of commercial real estate. The expansion lasted until 1996 when Stordalen had a falling out with the largest shareholder, Stein Erik Hagen, and was asked to leave his position as CEO. =Hotels= After leaving Steen & Str√∏m Invest, Stordalen struck out on his own teaming up with investor Christen Sveaas. In October 1996 the duo bought 68 percent of the shares in the Scandinavian operations of Choice Hotels for NOK 100 million. At the time the chain consisted of 8 hotels across Scandinavia. Following the acquisition Stordalen started his expansion, following the same model as in Steen & Str√∏m Invest, buying Swedish hotel chain Home as well as Norwegian hotel company InterNor, and taking Choice Hotels Scandinavia public. During a three-year period Choice Hotels Scandinavia bought, on average, a new hotel every other week and added 50 people to the payroll every 10 days. In December 1997 Sveaas sold his 37 percent share of the now 77 hotels. In 1999 Christian Ringnes and his company Eiendomsspar acquired a 35 percent share in Choice Hotels Scandinavia. After a short power struggle, Ringnes folded and Stordalen cemented his control over the company. The same year Stordalen also saw the acquisition of several Swedish and Danish hotels, including the Danish hotel company Nordisk Hotel Group, Stenungsbaden Yacht Club and Stockholm Globe Hotel. At the turn of the millennium, at age 37, Stordalen became a billionaire(in Norwegian krone). In 2012 Stordalen opened his biggest hotel to date, the 500 room 40 000 square meter Clarion Post Hotel in Gothenburg, Sweden. At the opening 10 000 Gothenburgers were gathered to watch a light and fireworks display that included Stordalen ascending from the top of the hotel playing the drums inside a six by six meter disco ball. =From public to private company= In 2000 Stordalen formed the company Home Invest, consisting of the properties previously owned by Choice Hotels Scandinavia. The company went public, but was delisted in 2001. In 2003 Choice Hotels Scandinavia bought shares in Swedish property owner and developer Capona. In 2004 Stordalen's Home Invest sold 19 hotel properties to Capona with settlement in shares giving him a majority interest. In 2006 Capona changed name to Home Properties. In 2005 Home Invest bought the remaining shares in Choice Hotels Scandinavia and delisted the company. In 2006 Home Properties spun off Home Capital as an investment company and listed it on the First North Stock Exchange in Stockholm. In 2007, Stordalen's Home Invest acquired all the shares in Home Capital and delisted the company. In 2009, Stordalen did the same with Home Properties. In 2019, Nordic Choice Hotels acquired K√§mp Collection Hotels.

His first buy was a painting by the American artist Ross Bleckner which still hangs at his private estate. In an interview in September 2012, renown Swedish curator Sune Nordgren stated that Stordalen was the European answer to American hotelier Steve Wynn. This partly due to the fact that Stordalen had \\"redefined\\" hotel art by spending in excess of five million dollars in contemporary art on his two latest hotels alone, Clarion Hotel Post in Gothenburg and Clarion Hotel & Congress in Trondheim - and have a private collection which is valued at around 30 million dollars. In January 2013 Stordalen opens a new hotel called The Thief, in the Tjuvholmen neighborhood in Oslo. Every one of the 119 rooms will have unique original art from artists like Sir Peter Blake, Chris Gianakos and Tony Cragg. On the interactive TV's guests will, supposedly as the world's first, be able to choose between pay-TV-options and contemporary video art. In one of the elevators there will be an animation by Julian Opie, one of Stordalen's favorite artists. In the library bar one will find a suite of pictures made by HM Queen Sonja of Norway. The Thief has signed a sponsorship-deal with the neighboring Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art that gives the hotel access to the museums vast art library. Under the agreement, The Thief can borrow some signal work for strategic locations in the hotel. Stordalen has world leading collections of artists like Jaume Plensa, Alex Katz and Franz West. He also owns some of Andy Warhol's best interpretations of Norwegian artist Edvard Munch. In the article the value of his total collections (private and business combined) was said to be more valued to more than 50 million dollars. These are some of his known art possessions: Franz Wests ¬´Lemure¬ª, Miwa Yanagis ¬´Elevator Girls¬ª, B√•rd Breiviks ¬´Partitur¬ª, Alex Katz‚Äô ¬´Kirsten in a baseball hat¬ª, Jaume Plensas ¬´Tattoo¬ª, Julian Opies ¬´Suzanne Walking¬ª and Damien Hirsts ¬´Stamp Out Pleasure And Pain¬ª. Business philosophy Stordalen's business philosophy is based on 5 pillars * A corporate culture distinguished by energy, guts and enthusiasm * Social responsibility * Consumer power * Capitalism * Difference The foundation for his business philosophy, coined The strawberry philosophy, stems from a deeply formative memory selling strawberries for his dad during his childhood summers. When complaining to his dad about the quality of the berries his dad retorted \\"Sell the berries you have, they are the only berries you can sell\\" - so always making the most of the possibilities given to you, has been his guiding mantra through his business life. He is well known for his annual winter conference for thousands of Nordic Choice managers usually held in Sweden. In addition to a big party that has previously included live camels, celebrities, and especially composed music and stage acts, Stordalen gives his employees a motivational speech that, in the media, has been likened to a religious revival.Youtube.com https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaWg29YMgdI Awards * Scandinavian Businessman of the Year 2004 * Grand Travel Awards to Nordic for Best Scandinavian Hotel Chain (2007 and 2008) and Best Work Place (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011) * European Hotel Design Award 2008 for Stenungsbaden Yacht Club * Sweden's most trusted brand 2008 from Reader's Digest - European Trusted Brands for Selma SPA * Customer Excellence Award 2008 from Microsoft Business Solutions for Choice * Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year 2010 * Brightest Business Mind in Northern Europe 2016 by Nordic Business Forum * Leader of the Year 2017, Grand Travel Award Sweden Environmentalism Stordalen first made his mark as an environmentalist in Norway supporting Norwegian NGO Bellona in the fight to free their expert Alexander Nikitin, charged with treason through espionage for his contributions to a Bellona report on nuclear safety within the Russian Northern Fleet.

Population: Geography =Climate= History Panoramic view of pre-revolutionary Shenkursk with the Holy Trinity Church (currently in ruins) Shenkursk was first mentioned in documents of Novgorod merchants in 1229. In 1315, it was bought by a Novgorod posadnik. Ivan the Terrible referred to this location as the town of Vaga and included it into his oprichnina. At that time, there was a timber fort and a residence of local bishops. Tsar Feodor I made a grant of Shenkursk to his brother-in- law, Boris Godunov, who bequeathed it to his future son-in-law, Johan of Schleswig-Holstein, who died shortly after arriving to Russia. The Romanovs presented the area to Prince Dmitry Troubetskoy as his votchina. Upon his death, the town was returned to the crown. In 1640‚Äì1643, the Tsar ordered a new fortress to be built in Shenkursk. Catherine the Great chartered Shenkursk in 1780, and Shenkursk became the seat of the newly established Shenkursky Uyezd in Vologda Viceroyalty (from 1796, in Arkhangelsk Governorate). Shenkursk played a prominent role in the Russian Civil War. In the autumn of 1918, about six thousand British and American troops advanced south of Shenkursk. On January 19‚Äì25, the Bolshevik troops staged a counteroffensive, known as the Battle of Shenkursk. Three thousand troops, split into three armies, advancing from three sides, cut Shenkursk off and moved the front area north of Shenkursk. Shenkursky Uyezd remained in Arkhangelsk Governorate until 1929, when several governorates were merged into Northern Krai and redistricted. In 1936, the krai was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast.

Culture Kandankali has traditionally been home of progressive movements and many forms of traditional and ritualistic arts like Theyyam, Poorakkali and Kolkali. The population of the village is almost entirely constituted by Hindus who by and large are very secular in their outlook. Nature The place is very scenic and is bounded on its east and south side by the beautiful Perumba River. Temples The famous Subramanya Swami Temple is near Kandankali. The name Kandankali is formed from 'Kandan' and 'Kali' which means Lord Shiva and Parvathi. The famous Karali Sree Bhadrakali Temple is located at the western border of Kandankali. Geography and natural resources This place is best for fish farming and prawn farming. The Perumba and Kunchimangalam Rivers are located in Kandangali. It is also very near to the Ezhimala Naval Academy, where the mountain view from the sea is so beautiful as well as the vision from the mountain to the sea. Transportation The national highway passes through Perumba junction. Goa and Mumbai can be accessed on the northern side and Cochin and Thiruvananthapuram can be accessed on the southern side. The road to the east of Iritty connects to Mysore and Bangalore. The nearest railway station is Payyanur on Mangalore-Palakkad line, from which trains are available to almost all parts of India.

These vehicles typically had two or four wheels and were used to carry passengers and/or a load. They were once common worldwide, but they have mostly been replaced by automobiles and other forms of self- propelled transport. General Petroglyph of a chariot in Parco Nazionale Delle incision rupestri di Naquane, Capo di Ponte. Horses were domesticated circa 3500 BCE. Prior to that oxen were used. Historically a wide variety of arrangements of horses and vehicles have been used, from chariot racing, which involved a small vehicle and four horses abreast, to horsecars or trollies, which used two horses to pull a car that was used in cities before electric trams were developed. A two-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle is a cart (see various types below, both for carrying people and for goods). Four-wheeled vehicles have many names ‚Äì one for heavy loads is most commonly called a wagon. Very light carts and wagons can also be pulled by donkeys (much smaller than horses), ponies or mules. Other smaller animals are occasionally used, such as large dogs, llamas and goats (see draught animals). Heavy wagons, carts and agricultural implements can also be pulled by other large draught animals such as oxen, water buffalo, yaks or even camels and elephants. Vehicles pulled by one animal (or by animals in a single file) have two shafts which attach either side of the rearmost animal (the wheel animal or wheeler). Two animals in single file are referred to as a tandem arrangement, and three as a randem. Vehicles which are pulled by a pair (or by a team of several pairs) have a pole which attaches between the wheel pair. Other arrangements are also possible, for example, three or more abreast (a troika), a wheel pair with a single lead animal (a \\"unicorn\\"), or a wheel pair with three lead animals abreast (a \\"pickaxe\\"). Very heavy loads sometimes had an additional team behind to slow the vehicle down steep hills. Sometimes at a steep hill with frequent traffic, such a team would be hired to passing wagons to help them up or down the hill. Horse-drawn carriages have been in use for at least 3,500 years. Two-wheeled vehicles are balanced by the distribution of weight of the load (driver, passengers, and goods) over the axle, and then held level by the animal ‚Äì this means that the shafts (or sometimes a pole for two animals) must be fixed rigidly to the vehicle's body. Four-wheeled vehicles remain level on their own, and so the shafts or pole are hinged vertically, allowing them to rise and fall with the movement of the animals. A four-wheeled vehicle is also steered by the shafts or pole, which are attached to the front axle; this swivels on a turntable or \\"fifth wheel\\" beneath the vehicle. From the 15th century drivers of carts were known as Carmen, and in London were represented by the Worshipful Company of Carmen.

Richard of Wallingford (1292‚Äì1336) was an English mathematician, astronomer, horologist, and cleric who made major contributions to astronomy and horology while serving as abbot of St Albans Abbey in Hertfordshire. Biography Richard was born, the son of a blacksmith, at Wallingford in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) in England in 1292. When he was orphaned he was taken to William de Kirkeby the Prior of Holy Trinity Priory. Richard subsequently spent six years studying at Oxford University before becoming a monk at St Albans. He later studied for nine more years at Oxford. In 1327 he became abbot of St Albans. Richard of Wallingford is best known for the astronomical clock he designed, while he was abbot, which is described in the Tractatus Horologii Astronomici (1327). The clock was completed about 20 years after Richard's death by William of Walsham but was apparently destroyed during Henry VIII's reformation and the dissolution of St Albans Abbey in 1539. His clock almost certainly was the most complex clock mechanism in existence at the time in the British Isles, and one of the most sophisticated ones anywhere.Thomas E. Woods Jr., How the Catholic Church Built the Western Civilization, page 36 https://books.google.com/books?id=jYvmAgAAQBAJ&lpg;=PP1&dq;=how%20the%20catholic%20church%20built%20western%20civilization&hl;=en&pg;=PA36#v=onepage&q;&f;=false The only other clocklike mechanism of comparable complexity that is documented in the 14th century is the astrarium by Giovanni de Dondi. It gave the mean time in equal and unequal hours, as well as the true solar time. It also displayed the phases of the moon and showed the positions of the lunar nodes and the height of tide at London Bridge. Based on the 14th-century literary evidence still surviving in the 20th century, several scholars of horological history have tried to build recreations of Richard of Wallingford's clock. The best known of these was built by Haward Horological and for many years was displayed at the Time Museum (now defunct) in Rockford, Illinois; it is currently on display at the Halim Time and Glass Museum in Evanston, Illinois). One was built by Eric Watson and is now in the Wallingford Museum; one built in 1988 is located at St Albans Cathedral; and one was built by Don Unwin for the Whipple Museum of the History of Science in Cambridge. Richard also designed and constructed calculation devices: a torquetum, the Rectangulus, and an equatorium, which he called Albion. The Albion could be used for astronomical calculations such as lunar, solar and planetary longitudes and could predict eclipses, and was capable of doing this without relying on a set of tables that had to be copied out.Hannam, James. God's philosophers: how the medieval world laid the foundations of modern science. Icon Books Ltd, 2009, 156 This is described in the Tractatus Albionis. He published other works on trigonometry, celestial coordinates, astrology, and various religious works. Richard suffered from what was then thought to be leprosy (although it might have been scrofula or tuberculosis) which he apparently contracted when he went to have his position as abbot of St Albans Abbey confirmed by the Pope at Avignon. He died at St Albans in 1336. See also *Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio *Yi Xing *Su Song References * Richard of Wallingford pointing to a clock, in reference to his gift to the abbey.

The social structures of Chambri society have often been a subject in the study of gender roles. The Chambri language is spoken by them. Margaret Mead, a cultural anthropologist, studied the Chambri in 1933. Her influential book Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies became a major cornerstone of the women's liberation movement, since it claimed that females had significant and dominant roles in Chambri society.  History  This community is located near Chambri Lake in Papua New Guinea, in the middle region of the Sepik River. The Chambri consist of three villages: Indingai, Wombun, and Kilimbit. Together, these communities contain about 1,000 people. When the Chambri first came together, though isolated, they located communities nearby that made it possible for cultural interaction and growth.Gewertz, D. (1977). The Politics of Affinal Exchange: Chambri as a Client Market. Ethnology, 16(3), 285-298. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/3773313 A neighboring society, the Iatmul people, and the Chambri began trading goods so that each could progress and aid one another. The Chambri have been, and continue to be a large fishing community. The fish Chambri caught were in turn traded with the Iatmul to receive sago. For shell valuables the Chambri traded their hand-made tools and products. In later years as the introduction of European tools began appearing within the culture, the Iatmul no longer needed the Chambri's tools and goods. This left the Chambri vulnerable and eventually led to the Chambri society leaving their island to protect their community from the rising Iatmul military. They returned in 1927 once peace had been restored in their area. Historically known as headhunters and a volatile group, the Chambri abandoned these tendencies once Papua New Guinea came under independent government. Culturally their society had changed due to European influences, however the personal interactions and customs within the Chambri had not. New neighboring societies were formed, trade and growth continued throughout the years as anthropologists such as Margaret Mead, Deborah Gewertz and Frederick Errington visited this tribal location and reported on their findings.Gewertz, D., & Errington, F.

The diet of the Chambri continues to consist mainly of sago and fish. As an island community, fishing is a staple of this society. The surplus fish that are not needed for the villages‚Äô nourishment are then taken and traded in the mountains for sago. Trade takes its form in the way of barter markets that occur on a six-day schedule. Barter markets are located in the Sepik Hills and women from the Chambri travel to meet other women from various villages spread throughout the hills to barter their food. Unlike their history with the Iatmul society, the Chambri and the villages they trade with have a more equal status between each.Gewertz, D. (1978).

Anthropologists brought some of the Chambri people to the United States to share their culture. When bringing them back to Papua New Guinea they brought back new ideas and customs they had acquired from their travels. As the world modernized, the Chambri villages became less financially stable through their trade and goods. Even through the financial distress, the Chambri culture and people survived and continued to practice their ways.Chang, D. (2009).

Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/682957  Chambri women  In Margaret Mead‚Äôs field study research in 1933 in Papua New Guinea, she outlined a position of women in the Chambri community that was unusual to what had been thought to be the norm across cultures. She speculated that women in the Chambri were the power individuals within the villages instead of men. How Margaret came to this conclusion was based on a few attributes of the Chambri. She first noted that the Chambri women were the primary suppliers of food. Contrary to other cultures the Chambri women were the ones who did the fishing for the community. This empowerment and responsibility of the women lends to the idea of a higher importance of women within this society. Through further observation Mead found that women also took the fish they caught and not only supplied it as food for their families but traveled to trade the surplus. It was the women's job to take the extra fish caught and travel into the surrounding hills to barter for sago for their families. Once again instead of the primary provider being the man in the family, Mead was witnessing the wife taking this role. However, as later anthropologists Deborah Gewertz and Frederick Errington discovered, these actions do not control the relationships between men and women of the Chambri.Gewertz, D., & Errington, F. (1985). The Chief of the Chambri: Social Change and Cultural Permeability among a New Guinea People. American Ethnologist, 12(3), 442-454. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/644531 The women being the sole provider for the family does not imply submission by the man. The men in the Chambri society are involved in other areas within the community, many of which are not deemed appropriate for the women. Such areas include politics and power within the tribe. This lack of involvement by women in these areas further suggest Mead's original claim of women's dominance may have been rooted in a lack of full observance of the activities in the Chambri society. Instead what later anthropologists found was that neither sex competed to be the dominant one. Within each sex dominance occurred and was witnessed, however this behavior failed to cross the sex barrier. Specifically neither group was viewed to follow or be submissive to the other. This lack of a dominant individual within a relationship allows for speculation that the role of women in a civilization can drastically be determined by its customs.Gewertz, D., & Errington, F. (1987). Cultural alternatives and a feminist anthropology. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.  Marriage within the Chambri  Marriage within the Chambri is a custom in which neither male nor female has the power. Though a patrilinear culture with arranged marriages, neither party loses full control in the marriage situation. Marriage is conducted in such a way that the men (who most commonly arrange the marriages) choose couplings that allow inter-clan relationships. Marriages that are not arranged also exist, but are much less common. Women have a say in who they marry as they work with male family members to choose a man with decent ancestral power. Bride price does exist within this community and is not looked upon as custom that demeans women. Shell valuables that are acquired through bartering are used for a bride price. Many of these shell valuables have symbolic purposes in the giving. Certain shells are associated specifically with womanly attributes such as childbearing, wombs, and menstruation. Within marriages women have certain stereotypes with which they have been labeled. Many times within the Chambri men fear their wives. This is because men obtain secret names within the male sorcery facet of the civilization and are forbidden to voice them. Men fear that they will speak while sleeping and reveal their secret names. Furthermore, with easy access to many of the husband's personal aspects such as hair, saliva and semen, makes the men wary of what the women could possibly give to a sorcerer. However, in some cases men see this fear as a characteristic of their power. Their view is that if their secret names are worth stealing by their wife, then they must be important and powerful enough for this kind of deceitfulness to have taken place.Gewertz, D., & Errington, F. (1981). A Historical Reconsideration of Female Dominance among the Chambri of Papua New Guinea. American Ethnologist, 8(1), 94-106. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/644489  Family  Women and men's dependence becomes almost completely equal when examining the roles of brothers and sisters within a traditional Chambri family. Unlike the fear that exists within marriages, fear is non-existent within the Chambri family. Brothers and sisters welcome the other's help in their pursuing of their desired roles within the community. Brothers look to their sisters for help in the political aspect of the Chambri. Sisters obtain help from the brothers in his support for her and her future children. Specifically the brother becomes a significant role in the life of his sister's sons. The brother's nephew in turn is seen to be a key factor in helping the brother in his political uprising. This relationship between nephew and uncle can be seen through the seamless family relationships that exist between the families of mothers and their brothers. The terms brother and sister are not always biologically reflected within the Chambri. Within the clan, women and men can act as siblings to one another during specific times, such as loss. The death of an individual binds the sisters of the clan together by representing the loss of a support system. Contrasting this, the men view a death as a loss of a political position within the community.Gewertz, D., & Errington, F. (1997). Why We Return to Papua New Guinea.

The vallum usually comprised an earthen or turf rampart (Agger) with a wooden palisade on top, with a deep outer ditch (fossa). The name is derived from vallus (a stake), and properly means the palisade which ran along the outer edge of the top of the agger, but is usually used to refer to the whole fortification. Characteristics Valli (Sudes) combined to form a Czech hedgehog. The stake-like valli (œáŒ¨œÅŒ±Œ∫ŒµœÇ) of which the vallum palisade was composed are described by Polybius (xviii.18.1, Excerpt. Antiq. xvii.14) and Livy (Liv. xxiii.5), who make a comparison between the vallum of the Greeks and that of the Romans, very much to the advantage of the latter. Both used for valli young trees or arms of larger trees, with the side branches on them; but the valli of the Greeks were much larger and had more branches than those of the Romans, which had either two or three, or at the most four branches, and these generally on the same side. The Greeks placed their valli in the agger at considerable intervals, the spaces between them being filled up by the branches; the Romans fixed theirs close together, and made the branches interlace, and sharpened their points carefully. Hence the Greek vallus could easily be taken hold of by its large branches and pulled from its place, and when it was removed a large opening was left in the vallum. The Roman vallus, on the contrary, presented no convenient handle, required very great force to pull it down, and even if removed left a very small opening. The Greek valli were cut on the spot; the Romans prepared theirs beforehand.(Polyb. l.c.; Virg. Georg. iii.346, 347; Cic. Tusc. ii.16). They were made of any strong wood, but oak was preferred. While on the march, each soldier carried three or four strong wooden stakes each at least 1.5 m (5 ft) long and pointed at both ends. A number of these have been found in excavations, sufficiently well- preserved to show that they were \\"waisted\\", that is narrowed at the centre. It is clear that these could not have been used on their own to form the palisade of the vallum constructed around a temporary marching camp; they would have had gaps between wide enough for an attacker to pass through with ease. One suggestion is that the \\"waist\\" facilitated them being tied together loosely in threes to form a kind of caltrop or Czech hedgehog that could be placed on the rampart (agger) of the vallum. It is likely that these would be augmented with whatever was to hand, such as tree branches or thorn bushes. Usage Coin depicting Numonius Vala attacking a vallum. In the operations of a siege, when the place could not be taken by storm, and it became necessary to establish a blockade, this was done by drawing defences similar to those of a camp around the town, which was then said to be circumvallatum. Such a circumvallation, besides cutting off all communication between the town and the surrounding country, formed a defence against the sallies of the besieged. There was often a double line of fortifications, the inner against the town, and the outer against a force that might attempt to raise the siege. In this case the army was encamped between the two lines of works. Construction This kind of circumvallation, which the Greeks called ·ºÄœÄŒøœÑŒµŒπœáŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ and œÄŒµœÅŒπœÑŒµŒπœáŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ, was employed by the Peloponnesians in the siege of Plataea (Thucyd. ii.78, iii.20‚Äë23). Their lines consisted of two walls (apparently of turf) at the distance of 16 feet, which surrounded the city in the form of a circle. Between the walls were the huts of the besiegers. The walls had battlements (·ºêœÄŒ¨ŒªŒæŒµŒπœÇ), and at every ten battlements was a tower, filling up by its depth the whole space between the walls. There was a passage for the besiegers through the middle of each tower. On the outside of each wall was a ditch (œÑŒ¨œÜœÅŒøœÇ). This description would almost exactly answer for the Roman mode of circumvallation, of which some of the best examples are that of Carthage in modern-day Tunisia by Scipio (Appian, Punic. 119, &c.;), that of Numantia in modern-day Spain by Scipio (Appian, Hispan. 90), and that of Alesia in modern- day France by Caesar (Bell. Gall. vii.72, 73). The towers in such lines were similar to those used in attacking fortified places, but not so high, and of course not moveable. (Lipsius, de Milit. Rom. v.5, in Oper. iii. pp156, 157; Poliorc. ii.1, in Oper. iii.283). The vallum-building technique was later taken by neighbouring people, such as the Byzantines and the Goths. Examples Examples of valla include: *\\"The Vallum\\", a component of Hadrian's Wall (England, Roman) *Trajan's Wall (Romania, Byzantine Age) *Athanaric's Wall (Romania, Moldova, 2-4th century, probably made by the Goths) Etymology # Latin vallus derives from Proto-Indo-European *walso-, \\" a post\\".

In the Spanish speaking world she is known professionally as simply Rosana. She was born on the island of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands, where she was raised. She was the youngest of a family of eight children. Arbelo was given her first guitar at the age of five years old and wrote her first song aged eight. She began composing music after moving to Madrid in the early 1980s. She won first place in Benidorm's music festival with her song \\"Fuego y Miel,\\" (Fire and Honey, in English) which led to her winning a recording contract with MCA. Before pursuing a solo career, she wrote songs for other musicians, including Joaqu√≠n Sabina, Miguel R√≠os, and Mar√≠a Dolores Pradera. Her debut album, Lunas Rotas, was released in 1996. The soundtrack for the 1996 movie Curdled featured her songs \\"Lunas Rotas\\" and \\"El Talism√°n\\", exposing her to an international audience. Her second album, Luna Nueva, was released in 1998 and had a more mature and deep sound, but maintained the natural and smooth sentiments that characterize the artist. After three years, during which she wrote songs for other artists, her third album, Rosana, was released in 2001. Its sounds explored the rhythms of her birthplace in the Canary Islands. In December 2003, Rosana released Marca Registrada, a double-disc album that contained 10 new songs, 12 greatest hits, and two videos. That same year her book Material sensible: Canciones y poemas (Sensitive Material: Songs and Poems) was published. It is a compilation of thoughts, poems, songs written for other performers, songs she wrote and performed, as well as some unpublished songs. In the summer of 2005 Magia was released and at Christmas time came Grandes Exitos, another greatest hits compilation. In 2009 she released A Las Buenas y Las Malas, followed by ¬°Buenos D√≠as, Mundo! in 2011, and 8 Lunas in 2013. 2016 saw the release of En la Memoria de la Piel, a collection of 11 songs she wrote following her 2013-2015 international tour, which included concerts in Europe, the United States and Latin America. In 2018 a new version of En la Memoria de la Piel was issued, this one as a two CD set, consisting of a disc of the 11 original songs plus a duet with Mexican singer Carlos Rivera on the song No Olvidarme De Olvidar, and a second disc of acoustic versions of all the songs on the original album. Rosana also appears regularly as an adviser and coach on the Spanish reality television singing competition programs Operaci√≥n Triunfo, La Voz Kids, and La Voz Senior.

Outcomes  When a petition is lodged against an election return, there are 4 possible outcomes: # The election is declared void. The result is quashed and a writ is issued for a new election # The election is held to have been undue: the original return is quashed, and another candidate is declared to have been elected. # The election is upheld, and the member returned is found to have been duly elected. # The petition is withdrawn. This may occur when the petitioner fails to attend a hearing, or when Parliament is dissolved before the petition process is complete  History  Controverted elections had been originally tried by select committees, afterwards by the Committee of Privileges and Elections, and ultimately by the whole House of Commons, with scandalous partiality, but under the Grenville Act of 1770 (10 Geo III. c. 16), and other later acts, by select committees, so constituted as to form a more judicial tribunal. The influence of party bias, however, too obviously prevailed until 1839, when Robert Peel introduced an improved system of nomination, which distinctly raised the character of election committees; but a tribunal constituted of political partisans, however chosen, was still open to jealousy and suspicion, and at length, in 1868, the trial of election petitions was transferred to judges of the superior courts, to whose determination the House gives effect, by the issue of new writs or otherwise. The House, however, still retains and exercises its jurisdiction in all cases not relegated, by statute, to the judges. Petitions, which resulted in the election in a constituency being held void used to be common after every general election, but are now rare. When an election was held void the House of Commons could seat another candidate, order a new writ issued to fill the vacancy or leave the writ unissued for a time, thus suspending the representation of a constituency. As the tolerance of corrupt elections became less during the 18th and 19th centuries, boroughs found to be corrupt could be punished by either changing the area and the qualifications for voting or disenfranchising the constituency completely. Such mechanism also exists in Hong Kong, then a British colony, Australia and New Zealand or other (ex-)Commonwealth nations. Cases In 1961, Tony Benn was disqualified from taking up his seat after a by-election by an election court because he held a peerage. In 1982, Seamus Mallon was disqualified from taking his seat in the Northern Ireland Assembly as he was a member of Seanad √âireann, the upper chamber of the parliament of the Republic of Ireland, at the time of his election. A recent example of an election being held void was when the 1997 election of Member of Parliament for Winchester, Mark Oaten, (Liberal Democrat) was contested by the Conservative Party candidate Gerry Malone. Oaten had won the seat by two votes, with 55 ballot papers had been rejected by the returning officer because they had not been stamped properly. Malone lodged an election petition in the High Court to contest the outcome. The petition was dealt with by special case in which Oaten joined. On 6 October 1997 Lord Justice Brooke ruled that the election was void: by a 1974 precedent the failure to stamp the ballots may have been the result of polling station staff forgetting, and had they been counted, Malone would have had a majority of two over Oaten. Two election petitions were lodged after the General Election on 6 May 2010. The defeated Independent Rodney Connor, who lost in Fermanagh and South Tyrone by four votes has lodged a petition seeking a recount with scrutiny, and the case began on 13 September 2010. In the Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency, the defeated Liberal Democrat candidate Elwyn Watkins petitioned against the election of Phil Woolas, a former Labour Minister, alleging that the result was affected by false statements of fact about his personal character.Election Petition submitted to the High Court - Part 1 , Part 2 and Part 3 . Parts 2 and 3 includes copies of the election literature challenged. (Oldham Council website, retrieved 30 June 2010) The election court which heard the case ordered a re-run of the election in Woolas' constituency after finding him guilty of making false statements against his opponent during the original campaign. Phil Woolas sought a judicial review of the decision in the High Court, but was unsuccessful overall as that Court upheld the decision of the Election Court in relation to two statements, whilst quashing the decision in relation to a third.

Car salesmen or production line workers, for example, may be paid in this way, or through commission. Many employers use this standards- based system for evaluating employees and for setting salaries. Standards- based methods have been in de facto use for centuries among commission-based sales staff: they receive a higher salary for selling more, and low performers do not earn enough to make keeping the job worthwhile even if they manage to keep the job. In effect, the salary would be re-evaluated up, or down, periodically (usually annually) based on the performance of the individual or team. The reward is the salary: with an expectation to be high on the pay band for high performance and low on the band for low performance. In comparison, the performance-related pay rise system would see the reward given in the form of a pay rise. The better the performance of the individual or team the larger the rise, likewise, if the performance was poor the associated rise would be minimal, if any at all. The reward is the pay rise: with an expectation of a high pay rise for high performance and a low or zero rise for low performance.  Advocacy  Business theorists Professor Yasser and Dr Wasi support this method of payment, which is often referred to as PRP. Yasser believes that money is the main incentive for increased productivity and introduced the widely used concept of piece work (known outside business theory since at least 1549. Oxford English Dictionary s.v. \\"piecework\\": \\"1549 Coventry Leet Bk. 792 No persone of the Craft of Cappers shall put owt eny pece-woork, but to suche of the same Craft as the maisters..shall agree & consent vnto.\\") In addition to motivating the rewarded behavior, standards-based payment methods can provide a level of standardization in employee evaluations, which can reduce fears of favoritism and make the employer's expectations clear. For example, an employer might set a minimum standard of 12,000 keystrokes per hour in a simple data-entry job and reassign or replace employees who cannot perform at that level. With PRP, employees can expect their performance to be evaluated objectively according to the standard of their work instead of the whims of a supervisor or against some ever-climbing average of their group. It is quite normal to put new starters towards the bottom of the pay band and, subject to normal performance, move them up to the midpoint (market target) within 3 to 5 years. To promote themselves, some unethical managers will suppress salaries by offering cost of living rises instead of true progression through the pay scale. This gives short term savings but, in the longer term leads to low morale, low performance, poor engagement, and even employee resignations after they have been trained. All of these consequences are very costly to the business. But used properly, PRP is a very effective way to get the best from your employees. There is however a well known reverse phenomenon where employees produce pay-related performance if a given salary remains below 80% of the pay band for any length of time. Successful managers and organizations know that in order to maximize profits, it's absolutely imperative to hire and keep the best employees possible. If a business always tries to maximize profit, it will actively try to reduce expenses whenever possible‚Äîincluding employees‚Äô wages. In fact, most companies pay employees as little as they can get away with paying. This however results in employees who will, in turn, provide as little effort as they can get away with. Many companies nevertheless still stick to the archaic, counterproductive goal of trying to minimize compensation. Though it may seem to be cost effective to apply this profit-first mentality of low-as-possible wages, it ultimately cripples employee performance and engagement, and damages the bottom line. Opposition A fundamental criticism of performance-related pay is that the performance of a complex job as a whole is reduced to a simple, often single measure of performance. For instance a telephone call center helpline may judge the quality of an employee based upon the average length of a call with a customer. As a simple measure, this gives no regard to the quality of help given, for instance whether the issue was resolved, or whether the customer emerged satisfied. Performance-related pay may also cause a hostile work attitude, as in times of low customer volume when multiple employees may compete for the attentions of a single customer. Where a customer has been helped by more than one employee, further resentment may be caused if the commission is taken by whoever happens to make the final sale. Macroscopic factors such as an economic downturn may also make employees appear to be performing to a lower standard independent of actual performance. Performance- based systems have met some opposition as they are being adopted by corporations and governments. In some cases, opposition is motivated by specific ill-conceived standards, such as one which makes employees work at unsafe speeds, or a system which does not take all factors properly into account. A further example can be seen in the public policy responses to Incentive Pay or Bonuses in the financial services sector following the financial crisis in 2008. The structure of the incentive pay schemes were deemed to be a contributing factor to the crisis and regulators around the world, co-ordinated by the Financial Stability Board issued recommendations http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_0904b.pdf to ensure that incentives schemes were re-designed. In Europe this has led to the Capital Requirements Directives legislation which has established a cap on variable or incentive pay which can be not more than 100% of the fixed pay for an individual in any given year, rising to 200% with shareholder approval. In other cases, opposition is motivated by a dislike of the consequences. For example, a company may have had a compensation system which paid employees strictly according to their seniority. They may change to a system that pays sales staff according to how much they sell. Low-performing senior employees would object to having their income cut to match their performance level, while a high-performing new employee might prefer the new arrangement. Another argument is that the judgment of one's performance can be subjective (the judgement of the same quality of work can vary from department to department in a company and from supervisor to supervisor). =Research= Academic evidence has increasingly mounted indicating that performance related pay leads to the opposite of the desired outcomes when it is applied to any work involving cognitive rather than physical skill. Research funded by the Federal Reserve Bank undertaken at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with input from professors from the University of Chicago and Carnegie Mellon University repeatedly demonstrated that as long as the tasks being undertaken are purely mechanical performance related pay works as expected. However once rudimentary cognitive skills are required it actually leads to poorer performance. These experiments have since been repeated by a range of economists, sociologists and psychologists with the same results. Experiments were also undertaken in Madurai, India, where the financial amounts involved represented far more significant sums to participants and the results were again repeated. These findings have been specifically highlighted by Daniel H. Pink in his work examining how motivation works. Cultural aspects An international study by Schuler and Rogovsky in 1998 pointed out that cultural differences affect the kind of reward systems that are in use. According to the study, there is a connection among *status-based reward systems (as opposed to achievement-based) and high uncertainty avoidance, *individual performance based systems and individualism, *systems incorporating extensive social benefits and femininity and *employee ownership plans with individualism, low uncertainty avoidance and low power distance.Schuler, R.

Rosedale parents criticized the rezoned to Plaquemine High because of the long distances involved. Academics The students at Plaquemine High School are required to take seven classes per day, with an optional vo-tech (which offers shop, drafting and home economics courses) or a college-bound curriculum which includes Calculus, Physics and Spanish as a foreign language. Athletics The school mascot is the Green Devil, which is the name of their sports teams as well. The school offers football, basketball, baseball, softball, Dance Team \\"Dazzlers\\", cheerleading, track, volleyball, band, and wrestling. The school has added a step team as of recent. Student life The school also has many clubs such as The National Beta Club, Key Club, Student Council, 4-H, ROTC Drill Team, and many other clubs. School uniforms The district requires all students to wear school uniforms.\\"MANDATORY SCHOOL UNIFORMS.\\" Iberville Parish School Board.

In particular, he is remembered primarily as the originator of the Pitman permutation test, Pitman nearness and Pitman efficiency. His work the Pitman measure of closeness or Pitman nearness concerning the exponential families of probability distributions has been studied extensively since the 1980s by C. R. Rao, Pranab K. Sen, and others. The Pitman-Koopman-Darmois theorem states that only exponential families of probability distributions admit a sufficient statistic whose dimension remains bounded as the sample size grows. Biography Pitman was born in Melbourne on 29 October 1897, and attended University of Melbourne, residing at Ormond College, where he graduated with First Class Honours. In 1926 he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of Tasmania, which he held until his retirement in 1962. He was a founding member and second President of the Australian Mathematical Society. He was also active within the Statistical Society of Australia, which in 1978 named the Pitman medal in his honour. Terminology * For \\"the sum of squares of deviations from the mean,\\" he coined the term squariance. * For \\"the logarithm of the likelihood\\" he coined the term loglihood.

In 1818, Karl Marx, the father of modern socialism and communism, was born in the house. It is now a museum about Karl Marx's life and writings as well as the history of communism. History The significance of the house went unnoticed until 1904, at which point the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) worked hard to buy it, succeeding in 1928. After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, the building was confiscated and turned into a printing house. On 5 May 1947 the building was opened as a museum of the life and works of Karl Marx. In 1968 it was integrated into the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, a charity foundation closely aligned with the SPD. On 14 March 1983, the 100th anniversary of Marx's death, the museum was re-opened after a year-long renovation that expanded it to three floors. In 2005, the Karl Marx House museum was again closed for three months. The re-inauguration, on 9 June, was attended by such celebrities as Anke Fuchs, Franz M√ºntefering, Kurt Beck, and Helmut Schr√∂er. The exhibition now also includes the history of communism in the Soviet Union, China, Central and Eastern Europe. The Karl Marx House museum currently receives about 32,000 visitors a year, about a third of whom are tourists from China, for whom it is one of the main attractions in Germany.
