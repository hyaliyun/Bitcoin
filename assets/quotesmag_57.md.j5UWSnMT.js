Badal was involved with Chhatra League in his student days, actively took part in the Liberation War. He was one of the key persons who tried to prevent offloading of firearms at Chittagong port during the war. He studied at the Chittagong Collegiate School. Career Badal was elected to Parliament from Chittagong-7 in 2008 as a candidate of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. He was also a candidate of the Grand Alliance. On 26 February 2009, he visited the gates of Bangladesh Rifles headquarters during the Bangladesh Rifles mutiny and met mutineers. He was an adviser of the CVO Petrochemical Refinery, a public limited company. He served as the Executive President of the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. Badal was elected to parliament again in 2014 from Chittagong-8. On 17 June 2015, he called upon the speaker of the parliament to issue a ruling to prevent the money laundering from Bangladeshi banks. In 2016, Badal and Sharif Nurul Ambia led a breakaway faction of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. The split happened after the President of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, Hasanul Haq Inu, appointed Shirin Akhter, Member of Parliament, the General Secretary of the Party. The appointment was opposed by Badal and Sharif Nurul Ambia. He blamed Inu for the split in the party. On 1 March 2017, Badal criticised Human Rights Watch for its report on Bangladesh and denied allegations of torture against the government.

It was taken from their 2014 extended play Decline & Fall. The song was released ahead of the EP on 21 May 2014 through frontman Justin Broadrick's own label, Avalanche Recordings, as a digital download. \\"Ringer\\" was the first original material released by Godflesh since their dissolution in 2002, and it was praised by critics as an ideal return for the band. Background In 2012, Godflesh entered the studio to record their seventh studio album, A World Lit Only by Fire. The studio (an at-home setup in Wales) saw Justin Broadrick and G. C. Green recording a number of songs, two of which were cut from the album and repurposed for an extended play titled Decline & Fall. On 21 May 2014, \\"Ringer\\", the EP's introductory track and Godflesh's first original material since the band dissolved in 2002, was released early for streaming. Decline & Fall was released shortly after that on 2 June 2014 with A World Lit Only by Fire following on 7 October 2014. Composition Musically, \\"Ringer\\" is a slow, distorted, heavy song built around Broadrick's eight-string guitar, Green's overdriven bass and the characteristic programmed percussion that helped Godflesh define industrial metal. The song begins with a wash of distortion before descending into the extreme weight of the guitar, bass and repeatedly thumping drum machine double-kicks. Gregory Adams of Exclaim! described \\"Ringer's\\" main riff as a \\"punishing detuned groove\\" that the song locks into and that \\"batter[s] the brain\\"; Self-Titled magazine called the riff a \\"familiar blissful chug\\". The Fader's Colin Joyce wrote that the song starts with \\"a blown-out drum machine and warped, harrowing guitar work\\". Buried among the overwhelming, downtuned noise are Broadrick's half-sung, half- growled vocals, which were described as craggy, rhythmic, moaned, throaty and soured. The programmed drumming, a staple of Godflesh's early sound, was highlighted as chaotic and throbbing, with a sound that, as Adams describes, \\"burrows into your eardrums\\". Dan Reilly of Spin called the song \\"skull- crushing\\", and Maya Kalev of Resident Advisor described \\"Ringer\\" by writing, \\"It opens with a thin growl and explodes into a colossus of riffs, vocal moans and percussive pounding that seems to choke on itself before redoubling its strength and fading into an ominous stretch.\\" =\\"Ringer\\" (Dub)= A remixed version of \\"Ringer\\" was released on the Japanese edition of Decline & Fall, titled \\"Ringer\\" (Dub). As a dub mix, it is noticeably sparser than the original track, featuring spaces where the otherwise omnipresent guitar chugging falls away so the song can focus on percussion and bass. It is almost a minute longer than the base song. Critical reception \\"Ringer\\" was met with very positive reviews. Invisible Oranges described the public and critical reaction to the song as full of relief, writing that it \\"sounded like Godflesh\\" and that \\"the purity from the innovators was appreciated\\". Several critics echoed this sentiment, noting that \\"Ringer\\" was instantly evocative of Godflesh's signature sound. Jeremy Ulrey of Metal Injection wrote that the song \\"has an absolutely savage central riff that almost seems written with sole purpose of teaching new school industrial dabblers like Batillus who really runs this shit.\\" MetalSucks' Axl Rosenberg wrote, \\"the track fucking rules. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by it\\". Track listing Personnel Credits adapted from Decline & Fall liner notes * Justin Broadrick ‚Äì vocals, guitar, machines, record producer * G. C.

It was placed third behind two Karpi≈Ñski SL.1 Akars but gained the second prize and also made what may have been the first nighttime glider flight. Design and development Reports of the first German glider contest, held at the Wasserkuppe in the late summer of 1920, generated considerable interest in Poland, leading to the First Polish Glider Contest at Czarna G√≥ra between 30 August and 13 September 1923. The contest was not a great success, limited by novice designers and pilots and a poor site, but the SL.1 Akar was by far the most successful design. The Ikub I, essentially an unpowered but otherwise conventional parasol wing monoplane, gained the second prize. The Ikub I was an all-wood aircraft. Its one-piece, twin spar wing had a rectangular centre- section and tapered outwards and was covered overall with fabric. It was supported over the fuselage on four near-vertical steel-tube struts and braced with lift wires from the lower fuselage longerons to the spars and with landing wires from a cabane over the fuselage. Its fuselage was a simple, rectangular section, ply-covered structure with a single-seat, open cockpit under the wing leading edge. The empennage was fabric-covered and wire-braced, with a curved fin carrying a broad, curved rudder. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage, with generous, split elevators. The Ikub had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with its wheels on a single axle mounted on short, steel tube V-struts. A central skid guarded against nose-overs. Operational history The first flight of the Ikub was in July 1923, near Warsaw. It was piloted by Wac≈Çaw U≈Çass in the Contest and on 19 September he achieved a flight of 74 s. At the very end of the competition (13 September) he made the first night flight by a glider in Poland, possibly anywhere, landing by fires and torches; the flight lasted 100 s.

She was named after Prince Waldemar of Prussia. The ship was primarily employed as a passenger and cargo carrier between Hamburg and South America during her career. Design and construction In 1900 HAPAG established a route from Germany to the east coast of South America which at the time was served by an old steamer SS Canadia. At the same time, the company placed an order for five ships of approximately to adequately serve the route. The first of these ships, SS Prinz Eitel Friedrich, was launched in early 1902 and became the first ship of the Prinzen class, as all the vessels were named after the princes of the German imperial family, the other four would be named SS Prinz Waldemar, SS Prinz Adalbert, SS Prinz Oskar and SS Prinz Sigismund. Prinz Waldemar was laid down at Reiherstieg Schiffswerfte & Maschinenfabrik shipyard in Hamburg as a second of the Prinzen-class vessels, and launched on 7 May 1902 (yard number 409). After successful completion of sea trials Prinz Waldemar was handed over to her owners on 23 August of the same year. The ship was primarily intended as a cargo carrier, but at the same time had 25 spacious cabins built, that could accommodate between 60 and 100 first class passengers. The cabins were all on the second deck, well above the waterline, so that ports could be kept open all the voyage except in very stormy weather. Each cabin was equipped with heaters and fans to make journey more enjoyable. In addition, the ship could also carry around 560 third class passengers and 5,200 tons of cargo to handle which the vessel was equipped with eight steam cranes. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . Prinz Waldemar was assessed at and . The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 318 nhp quadruple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history After delivery Prinz Waldemar was immediately put on the Hamburg to Brazil route. On her trips down south, the ship would carry a variety of general cargo such as cheese, tea, cod, butter, cereals, wines etc. while on her return journey, the vessel would be loaded with coffee, and occasionally with agricultural products from Argentina and Uruguay, such as meat and cotton. Additionally, the vessel carried immigrants to Brazil, mostly Portuguese who were picked during her stop at Lisbon. Prinz Waldemar departed Hamburg for her maiden journey on September 10, 1902 for Brazilian ports of Santos and Rio de Janeiro via Lisbon. She arrived at Rio de Janeiro on October 4, and proceeded to Santos the next day. After loading 48,622 bags of coffee, Prinz Waldemar departed Santos on October 22 for Europe. To entice passengers, HAPAG added several ports, such as Dover and Boulogne on her return trips from Brazil. However, in 1906 the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company entered the competition for a lucrative trade between New York and West Indies, where HAPAG operated its own Atlas Line, acquired in 1901 from the United Fruit Company. Prinz Waldemar arrived in Rio de Janeiro for the last time on April 21, 1906, and consequently was reassigned to the Atlas Line, where the vessel was employed on the New York City to the West Indies route, calling at ports of Kingston, Puerto Lim√≥n, Savanilla and Cartagena starting in late summer of 1906. =Sinking= Prinz Waldemar departed New York City under command of Captain Paul Wintzer for her final journey on December 29, 1906 for Kingston where she arrived on January 4, 1907. After touching at Savanilla, and Cartagena, the vessel took course to Puerto Lim√≥n. On January 14, 1907 the vessel left Puerto Lim√≥n and took course to Jamaica where she was expected to arrive in the afternoon of January 17. At around 15:32 local time on January 14, Kingston was struck by a devastating earthquake which flattened the city, and destroyed among other things both Plum Point and Port Royal lighthouses at the entrance to the Kingston harbor. Around 02:00 on January 17, 1907 Prinz Waldemar arrived at the Plum Point, about 10 miles east of Kingston, and attempted to navigate into the harbor. Due to a non-functioning lighthouse, the Captain got confused and ran aground on a coral reef, about half-mile east northeast of the lighthouse, in an approximate position , close to the place where another HAPAG liner, , went ashore on December 16, 1906. All crew and passengers were able to safely disembark the ship. An attempt was made to refloat the vessel, however, on February 26, 1907 it was announced that HAPAG decided to abandon the salvage operations and the ship was declared a total wreck.

It was built from 1886 to 1889. The property is owned by Mount Warrigal Retirement Village Ltd. It now forms part of the Warrigal Community Village Queanbeyan aged care facility, in which it is used as a community space. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  While searching for the Murrumbidgee River in 1820, Joseph Wild, James Vaughan and Charles Throsby Smith came upon two small streams forming a single river winding through a valley at the eastern end of the Limestone Plains. These were later named the Molonglo River and the Queanbeyan River. The first non- Aboriginal use of land at Queanbeyan was by an unauthorised occupant, Timothy Beard, who called his property \\"Quinbean\\" which is thought to be an Aboriginal word for \\"clear water\\". This gave the city its modern name, Queanbeyan. The area became a natural stop for travellers crossing into the Monaro and by 1824, prospective settlers were establishing \\"stock stations\\" around the region. With this came an increase in population in the 1830s, and by 1836, a post office was established and a court house followed in 1837. Queanbeyan was formally proclaimed as a settlement on 28 September 1838. The site of Kawareee is on part of portion 35 of the Parish of Queanbeyan and was purchased by Robert Campbell in 5/1836. Campbell was a merchant, pastoralist, politician and philanthropist born in Greenock, Scotland in 1769 and who arrived in Sydney in 1798. With the permission of the Governor of New South Wales, he established the Campbell's Wharf at Circular Quay. In compensation for the loss of his ship \\"Sydney\\" while it was on government service, he was awarded compensation in the form of a land grant at Limestone Plains in 1824 which he took up in 1825. He renamed his original grant \\"Duntroon\\" after Duntrune Castle, the hereditary home of the Campbells (clan) in Scotland. Through the next decade Campbell amassed vast landholdings on the Limestone Plains and elsewhere in NSW. Before he died on 15 April 1846, Campbell divided his holdings between his six children. His son George Campbell conveyed five ares to James Brown of Googong, Queanbeyan in 1854. On his death in 1883, Brown's daughter Eliza Richardson inherited the land. She sold two acres two roods to local solicitor Earnest Edward (E.E.) Morgan of Queanbeyan in February 1886. This land formed part of the area known as \\"Garryowen\\" (bounded by Uriarra Road, Stornaway Street, Tharwa Road and Campbell Street) which was subdivided in the 1850s into small landholdings of 10-20 acres to the west of the town grid and was fully occupied by 1860. Kawaree Cottage was built by E. E. Morgan between 1886-1889 on the block which according to Sheedy, formed the extremity of the southern boundary of Garryowen, the block which was previously owned by James Brown of Googong. The house is of a late Victorian style, built at a time of great growth in the Southern NSW regional areas. There is no documented evidence of any garden design for the period between the house's completion in 1889 and 1921 when the property was first rented, to 1924 when the Colmans became its owners. The Kawaree landscape was initially developed over 70 years through the gold rush of the 1880s, the depression of the 1890s, Federation, the 1920s, the Great Depression of the 1930s, World War II and was finalised in the optimism of post-war Australia. In 1892 the property was sold to the trustees of the Wesleyan Methodist Church for use as a parsonage (for Queanbeyan). The manse was lived in by Methodist Ministers continuously for 30 years, but due to the distance being too far from the church, the Methodist Church sold the property to a parishioner, Herbert George (H. G.) Colman, in 1924.Area Design Consultants, 2017, pp 1-2, 11-16 Colman came from Blayney to work for James Buchanan Young, who had migrated to Australia in 1885, moved to Blayney and then to Queanbeyan in 1914, where he purchased Harry Solomon's store in Monaro Street and changed its name to J. B. Young's department store. Colman was the store's manager. He was responsible for the rapid expansion of the company J. B. Young's, which purchased the first lease offered for sale in Canberra in December 1924, as the fledgling Federal Capital began to expand. A branch store was built in what was then called Eastlake and is now Kingston, Canberra's first suburb and shopping precinct. The store opened in July 1925. After the expansion into Canberra, the business began to grow rapidly and H. G. Colman and two other directors, bought out J. B. Young. The store saw expansion into (Canberra's suburb) Civic, which opened in September 1932 and in other regional centres until J. B. Young's landholdings was bought out by Grace Brothers and closed by the early 1980s. Later Grace Brothers was bought out by Myer in 1985 and many of their stores closed. Kawaree, at the time the Colmans lived there, had open horse paddocks, chicken runs, vegetable gardens and fruit orchards. Through the depression, money was scarce as Colman had suffered a financial setback, and, as most did, they relied on produce from their own garden and assets to make ends meet. For their children, George, his brother Jim and sister Biddie, life was an adventure but it was also tough and like so many in the district, they made do with whatever was to hand. Horse and sulky took the children to school (at Telopea Park Public School), in Barton. Open space was a vital part of the Kawaree way of life, providing as it did for the transport and dietary needs of its occupants. Colman and his wife lived there until their deaths in 1959. In all the family lived there from 1920-62, when George and James Colman, their sons and executors of H. G.'s will, sold it to Queanbeyan solicitor, Robert Allport and his wife Margaret. The property was converted to Torrens Title in 1969/70. The Colmans were avid gardeners and highly regarded for their wide variety of roses, also for the range of flowers, shrubs and conifers which filled the abundant garden spaces. The overflowing house gardens framed the lawns and serpentine carriage loop, typical of the Arts & Crafts (interwar) period, whilst the picket fence was a remnant of an earlier time and is evidence of the Late Victorian garden style. Photographic evidence suggests the garden was structurally in place when the first images were taken in 1924, and the style is reflective of both Late Victorian and early 20th century garden (styles). Although the picket fence and formal entry are evident in gardens from the Victorian and Late Victorian eras, the remaining elements indicate other influences which were more reflective of the Federation and Picturesque ideals of the new century, tempered with plant choices resilient to drought (hardy species of roses, conifers and perennials. The extent of the garden is a display of the optimism of the period prior to the (Great) depression of 1929. Colman went on to develop one of regional NSW's largest chains of department stores, including J. B. Young's, Fosseys and Owl Supermarkets. The Allport family lived in Kawaree until they sold it to John Fisher's company Rynkite P/L in 1987, which began construction of the Kawaree Village Aged Care Facility within its broader gardens and property. Since the development of an aged care facility on Kawaree during the late 1980s the landscape has undergone significant changes to accommodate a number of residential buildings, with the original Kawaree (house) building extended and modified for use as the facility residents' community centre. Through these changes there are a number of extant features that derive from the original Kawaree garden setting (that remain). In 1988 a permanent conservation order under the NSW Heritage Act was made on Kawaree. This was replaced by Kawaree's listing on the NSW State Heritage Register in 1999. In 1991 Kawaree was listed on the Queanbeyan Local Environmental Plan, which lapsed and was replaced by the 1998 LEP listing. This was subsequently updated in 1999 and again in 2007, after a local heritage study.  Description  Much change has occurred to Kawaree's landscape since 1987's construction of the Kawaree Retirement Village and subsequent expansion of that with an Aged Care Facility. Kawaree, at the time the Colmans lived there, had open horse paddocks, chicken runs, vegetable gardens and fruit orchards. Open space was a vital part of the Kawaree way of life, providing as it did for the transport and dietary needs of its occupants. Colman and his wife lived there until their deaths in 1959. ;Grounds: The Kawaree landscape was initially developed over 70 years through the gold rush of the 1880s, the depression of the 1890s, Federation, the 1920s, the Great Depression of the 1930s, World War 2 and was finalised in the optimism of post-war Australia. The property was a large block on the edge of (i.e. outside the) Queanbeyan's town grid, basically a semi-rural villa estate. The serpentine carriage drive and loop before the house was reflective of Victorian estate planning - it was converted into a driveway in the Inter- war period with flanking garden reflecting that era of garden style. ;Garden: There is no documented evidence of any garden design for the period between the house's completion in 1889 and 1921 when the property was first rented, to 1924 when the Colmans became its owners. The picket fence and gate towards the house reflect Late Victorian era garden detail that remains. The overflowing house gardens (beds) which framed the lawns and serpentine carriage loop were typical of Arts & Crafts (interwar) period. The Colmans (here from 1921, renting (and owning from 1924)) were avid gardeners and highly regarded for their wide variety of roses, also for the range of flowers, shrubs and conifers which filled the abundant garden spaces. The overflowing house gardens framed the lawns and serpentine carriage loop, typical of the Arts & Crafts (interwar) period, whilst the picket fence was a remnant of an earlier time and is evidence of the Late Victorian garden style. Photographic evidence suggests the garden was structurally in place when the first images were taken in 1924, and the style is reflective of both Late Victorian and early 20th century garden (styles). Although the picket fence and formal entry are evident in gardens from the VIctorian and Late Victorian eras, the remaining elements indicate other influences which were more reflective of the Federation and Picturesque ideals of the new century, tempered with plant choices resilient to drought (hardy species of roses, conifers and perennials. The extent of the garden is a display of the optimism of the period prior to the (Great) depression of 1929. ;House: The house is of a late Victorian style, built at a time of great growth in the Southern NSW regional areas. In the late 1980s it was converted into, extended and modified for use as the community facility as part of estate changes to create the Kawaree Retirement Village.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The mill was built for Martin Byrne, who was a prominent landowner, hotelier and businessman in Queanbeyan. Byrne had nursed the idea of establishing a mill since 1870, but it was not until 1883 that he made a start. He let the building contract to an experienced Sydney mill builder, William Crispin, who in turn subcontracted much of the work to local builders Thomas Jordan and Thomas McCauley. Crispin would have designed the mill and supervised its construction, while Jordan and McCauley carried out the actual building work. The building, constructed of brick laid in English bond, was completed in September 1883 at a cost of 3,500 pounds. It was originally equipped with a fifteen-horsepower engine and three pairs of elevators, while a freestanding smokestack high stood beside the building. Operations began in December 1883, with the mill's two employees soon producing forty bags of flour per day. Martin's son, James, managed the mill, while he and his family lived next door in the two storey mill house which had been built at the same time as the mill. With the arrival of the railway in Queanbeyan in 1887, cheaper Sydney flour became available in the town. Two years later, construction commenced of another mill near the new railway station in Oaks Estate. Realising that he could no longer compete, Byrne closed the mill down in 1889 and put it up for sale. It was subsequently used for many years and by different people as a store for farm produce. At some point, it was bought by J. B. Young's and used for storage. It was used for a restaurant in the 2000s, but this has since closed. James Byrne continued to live in the mill house until his wife's death in August 1902. The mill house was then occupied as a residence by William Hill, by Reginald Tetley in the period 1937-52 and by Archibald Campbell of Lanyon. It then passed to J. B. Young's and was used by the company as a residence for its employees. From the early 1980s, the building housed craft stores and a bookshop and returned to being a residence for a period. It now houses the Millhouse Cafe. Description Byrne's Mill was one of six to have operated in the Canberra- Queanbeyan district at different times. The mill building is a three-storey brick structure with a corrugated steel gable roof. Window heads (of brick) are slightly rounded and there is a hoist and door to the top storey. High up in the gable ends of the building are what appear to be attic windows. The mill house or former manager's house is a two-storey brick building with a corrugated steel roof. The roof is a gable with a skillion to the rear. Decoration includes rendered quoins and well crafted gothic bargeboards. The front of the building features a cantilevered balcony to the upper floor, complete with filigree work and a convex iron roof. Windows to this front facade are round arched with label moulds and there is a fanlight over the front door. The mill and mill house were identified as places to be kept by all three community workshops organised by the AHC in Queanbeyan in 1990 to investigate social significance, local significance and a community's sense of place.  Heritage listing  Rear view, 2018 Byrne's Mill is very significant as the sole surviving mill building in the Canberra-Queanbeyan district, at least six other mills having functioned in the area at various times. The building, together with the adjacent millhouse, is also the only substantially intact nineteenth century industrial site in Queanbeyan. The mill and millhouse are significant in demonstrating the adverse effects that the coming of rail services exerted on the majority of manufacturing industries in rural centres. The mill, owing to its massing, general design and the form of its openings, is a good example of a late nineteenth century flour mill. The two buildings form part of an important remnant nineteenth century streetscape in Collett Street, linking with another nineteenth century building, Hibernia Lodge, situated further north along the street Byrnes Mill and Millhouse was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Life and work Leslie was born in Portabello House, Dublin in April 1899, to Reverend John Leslie and Mary Richardson Smith. She had one sister, Jean Annette. Her father was later Dean of Lismore, although Leslie was raised in Co. Tipperary. She received her secondary education at Sherborne School for Girls in Dorset, and then attended Trinity College Dublin. Leslie remained at the university, where she was academically successful, winning a gold medal in 1922 and gaining her D. Litt in 1943 for work on Felicia Hemans.

It was designed by W. H. Downey and built from 1859 to 1862 by Daniel Jordan and Gibson. It is the Old Queanbeyan Hospital and the Nurses Dormitory. It is presently being refurbished for what will become the Rusten House Arts Centre. It is owned by the Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Queanbeyan town was around long before nearby Canberra and up until 1838 was called Quinbean, which means \\"clear waters\\". The Queanbeyan area is part of the traditional lands of the Ngunnawal Aboriginal people. Diseases and viruses brought by colonial settlers, such as smallpox and influenza, had a disastrous effect on local Aboriginal populations by the mid 19th century. Europeans first arrived in the area on 8 December 1820. The area became a natural halting place for travellers crossing the (Molonglo) river into the Monaro (to the south) and by 1824 prospective settlers were establishing \\"stock stations\\" around the region. Old maps of 1833 show no fewer than 12 stations in the Molonglo, Gundaroo, Lake George and Bungendore area. The first Post Office was established in Crawford Street to service settlers in 1836, and in 1837 Cptn. Alured Tasker Faunce of the 4th (King's own) Regiment was appointed resident Police Magistrate. Queanbeyan was officially proclaimed a township in 1838 with a population at that time of about 50. Traces of gold were discovered in 1851 and lead and silver mines also flourished briefly. Settlers were harassed by bushrangers, of which John Tennant, Jacky Jacky, Frank Gardiner and Ben Hall were some of the more notorious.David Scobie Architects, 2007, 6 Queanbeyan District Hospital began as an initiative of local citizens who formed a Benevolent Society in 1847 to operate a hospital for the indigent sick and injured. MaryAnn Rusten was the foundation matron of the institution and the hospital initially operated in a rented cottage in \\"Irishtown\\".David Scobie Architects, 2007, 11 Rusten House was built to replace the Benevolent Asylum, to serve the more affluent community. In 1847 there was the foundation meeting of the Queanbeyan District Hospital. In 1859 W. H. Downey was appointed to draw up plans for a hospital building. He submitted a design for a stone building 74' long by 32' wide, to accommodate up to 16 patients. Tenders were submitted to erect the building. Local builders Daniel, Jordan and Gibson started construction. The building was completed in 1861. In 1862 a ball was held to celebrate opening the new hospital. The Rusten family moved in to the new hospital. In 1865 the hospital received its first subsidy from the Government of New South Wales. In 1868 George Campbell became President of the Hospital Committee, marking the beginning the Campbell family's association with the hospital. In 1870 oaks (Quercus sp.), elms (Ulmus procera) and pine (Pinus sp.) trees were planted in the grounds. In 1871 Thomas Jordan was commissioned to build a kitchen with a brick floor. In 1875 Matron Rusten died in office and a wash house and covered passageway were erected. In 1876 2 iron ships' tanks were installed to serve as rainwater tanks for the building. In 1877 Dr. Sidney Longden Richardson started his association with the hospital, which lasted 41 years. In 1878 the Committee called for tenders to erect guttering and pipes to run water from the roof to the tanks. In 1884 the hospital treated 42 patients. In 1885 Thomas Jordan erected a large ward at the eastern end of the building as a fever ward. The hospital treated 98 patients. In 1886 the authorities increased the fee payable by the railway contractor. As a result, the contractor started his own hospital in the Kent House Hotel to treat his workers. In 1887 the hospital treated 35 patients and in 1889 18 patients. In 1890 the Committee decided not to admit pauper patients, except those sent by the police. In 1891 the Committee decided to only admit patients recommended by a subscriber to the hospital. Dr Patrick Blackall commenced a long association with the hospital. Dr Blackall later became the foundation President of the Queanbeyan-Canberra Medical Society. In 1892 the NSW Government applied the 1880 Hospital Act to Queanbeyan Hospital. This Act obliged the institution to accept all patients regardless of whether they could pay, or had been recommended by a subscriber. The hospital's land was enclosed by a fence and the buildings re-roofed with galvanised iron, and a skylight installed in the boardroom.Giovanelli, 2015, 2 In 1895 hospital buildings were roofed with galvanised iron. There was also a mortuary in use, the site of which is now unknown. A skylight was installed in the board room. Changing social attitudes saw the hospital's role change, and by the early 20th century it was a community hospital. Replaced by present hospital during the 1930s, it became a nurses' dormitory. It has been renamed after Matron Mary Rusten. In 1924 plans for a new building on the site were drawn up. In 1933 the new hospital opened and Rusten House was converted for use as a nurses' dormitory. It was later used for ancillary purposes over the decades. The addition of internal partition walls and bathrooms presumably date to the time of its adaptation as a dormitory. At some stage the northern verandah was enclosed, and the southern verandahs rebuilt in wider form and enclosed to provide greater workspace and better internal circulation. The space between Rusten House and the Fever Ward was enclosed and subdivided to provide spaces for an office, bathroom and tea room. A doorway was cut through the stone wall to provide access from part of Rusten House to the bathroom, and a large opening cut through the brick wall of the Fever Ward to enable access to the tea room. In 1988 a permanent conservation order was placed on Rusten House. Rusten House the original hospital building and its landscape setting was included on the NSW State Heritage Register in 1999. In 2005 the Greater Southern Area Health Service finalised a project definition plan for redevelopment of Queanbeyan Hospital site. HSPC (NSW) was engaged to prepare plans for new works. At the time of decommissioning, internal access between the Fever Ward and the east and west sections of Rusten House was provided by the wide enclosed verandah on the southern side of Rusten House, and by the enclosure of the western of the two northern verandahs.Giovanelli, 2015, 3 In 2007 the Main Hospital building was under construction and a conservation plan for the building was prepared.David Scobie Architects, 2007, 9-10 In January 2007 a major project application for redevelopment of the hospital site was approved. In 2012 the conservation management plan was updated by Godden Mackay Logan. In 2014 asbestos was removed from the building and some basic internal works done to arrest structural failings and make minor improvements for prospective users. A number of walls, cladding and pipework were removed and as a consequence it has not been possible to use the building since. With removal of the verandah enclosures in 2014, there is no longer internal access throughout the building. The building was subsequently transferred from NSW Health to the Queanbeyan City Council. In November 2016 the state government gave funding of $250,000 for Queanbeyan City Council's upgrade of Rusten House to create an arts and cultural hub for the region. The amount will be matched by Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council, for the project which is expected to take at least two years to complete.Queanbeyan Age, 1 November 2016 It will be known as the Rusten House Arts Centre.  Description  ;Site The site is within the block dominated by the existing and new Queanbeyan Hospital between Antill, Collett and Erin Streets. Its urban context is residential with a combination of two storey units on Collett Street to the west, a single storey residential building opposite on Collett Street and a two-storey residential building opposite on Antill Street. The Avenue street planting is generally random with well-spaced street trees remaining only along Collett Street south-east of the Antill Street intersection. Rusten House is on rising ground on the north-eastern corner of the block at the junction of Collett and Antill Streets. The building is close to Collett Street. The building faces a mature and extensive terraced garden consisting of two clumps of trees at the upper level and a clump at the lower level near Antill Street. The building's main facade faces Antill Street although the slope of the land means that the building is barely visible from that street. There are gardens to the north- west of the building and to the south-east. The garden to the north-west is on the site of part of the former 1905 Nurses' residence which extended from the 1885 wing parallel with Collett Street. The area consists of lawn and paths to the perimeter today. This forms part of the landscape curtilage of the building. The garden to the south-east forms the address to the main 1859-61 building and consists of an upper forecourt, stepped middle garden and lower grassed slope. There is a semi-formal spatial axis between the two tree groups and the building. The 1920s terraced gardens to Antill Street are well maintained and still intact in form and detail. The 1885 wing is prominent on Collett Street being on the front site boundary. Minor planting on each side of the north-east elevation provides a good setting for its symmetrical design. There are no street trees on the south-western side of Collett Street and the setting is dominated by a flagstone clad cutting between the gutter and grass verge. The fence to the property on the Antill and Collett Street sides is a cyclone mesh fence between galvanised steel posts and rails. The spatial curtilage is defined in the north-west by the two elevations of the red brick Mental Health building - Block R and the small lawn area and mature tree within that space. This curtilage is currently defined by Antill and Collett Streets to the nominal south and east. On the west a driveway with entry on Antill Street separates Rusten House from other hospital facilities. East of the driveway there remains a tennis court currently used for car parking. The landform indicates that the natural levels were altered to extend the court surface level out towards Antill Street. The car parking area serves staff and visitors to the hospital facilities which are generally west of the Rusten House area. The car parking area is generally screened by mature trees.David Scobie Architects, 2007, 14-17 ;Rusten House There are two main parts to the building, namely the larger stone section built in 1861 that is back from the road and known formally as Rusten House. In 1885 a separate Fever Ward was built between Rusten House and Collet Street, facing directly onto that street. There was no direct internal connection between the two buildings, however the narrow space between them has been enclosed and now both buildings are collectively referred to as Rusten House. Rusten House is a single storey mid-Victorian building divided into two main wards; one for males and one for females. Original buildings have had many additions and changes, but the original form and character is still apparent. Stone quarried locally, timber verandas, corrugated iron roof. ;Other buildings According to the 2012 GML conservation management plan, a wash house and covered passageway were erected in 1875 and although not clear, it may be that the small brick addition at the western end of Rusten House is the wash house as its detailing is consistent with the period. The location of the covered passageway may have been a covered link to other buildings on the site that have since been demolished. = Modifications and dates = * 1870: oaks (Quercus sp.), elms (Ulmus procera) and pine (Pinus sp.) trees were planted in the grounds. * 1871: Thomas Jordan commissioned to build a kitchen with a brick floor * 1875: a wash house and covered passageway were erected. * 1876: 2 iron ships' tanks installed to serve as rainwater tanks. * 1878: tenders to erect guttering and pipes to run water from the roof to the tanks. * 1885: erected a large ward at the eastern end of the building as a fever ward. * 1892: hospital land was enclosed by a fence. * 1895: buildings re-roofed with galvanised iron (the 1861 Rusten House seems to have had a shingled roof prior to re-roofing) and a skylight was installed in the board room. * 1905: a telephone was installed * 1907: acetylene gas was installed * 1921: electricity was installed. * 1924: plans for a new building drawn up * 1933: the new hospital opened. * 2014: asbestos removed from the building and some basic internal works done to arrest structural failings and make minor improvements for prospective users.

It is one of the oldest extant public buildings in Queanbeyan. Rusten house is historically significant as Queanbeyan's second hospital and one that served as the town's public hospital for a period of seventy two years from 1861. The building is also significant for the fact that, from 1911, it was the de facto original hospital for the nation's new federal capital at Canberra. It was the only hospital serving the federal territory for most of the period up to early 1921 and continued to treat patients from Canberra up into the 1930s. As an important public building solidly constructed in stone, the hospital was also a significant early indication of, and contribution to Queanbeyan's development as a major regional centre. The building is an important physical manifestation of the ideology of hospitals and public health in the mid nineteenth century.David Scobie Architects, 2007, 59 * the site has the potential to demonstrate the evolution of a landscape from Late Victorian times to the present, through interpretation of the landscape, planting and archaeological discovery; * the site has the ability to demonstrate a number of significant social and environmental changes relating to the last 145 years of occupation and use; * the site has links to the early settlement and development of the Queanbeyan district through the development and use as the second hospital; * the site has significance by association with Mary Rusten, the first Matron; * the site has strong links with the local community, particularly with the use of the site for the general hospital: 1861-1933; * the buildings have aesthetic significance as a distinctive architectural composition in contrasting styles with associated landscape layout and planting.David Scobie Architects, 2007, 56 Old Queanbeyan Hospital was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

The NDUFAF2 protein is a chaperone involved in the assembly of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) also known as complex I, which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain. Mutations in this gene have been associated with progressive encephalopathy and Leigh disease resulting from mitochondrial complex I deficiency.  Structure  NDUFAF2 is located on the q arm of chromosome 5 in position 12.1. The NDUFAF2 gene produces a 20 kDa protein composed of 169 amino acids. The protein is a chaperone of the complex I NDUFA12 subunit family.  Function  NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) in the first step of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, resulting in the translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The NDUFAF2 gene encodes a complex I assembly factor, B17.2L, that is important for the correct function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Specifically, B17.2L acts as a molecular chaperone, associating with an 830 kDa subassembly in the late stages of complex I assembly.  Clinical significance  Mutations in NDUFAF2 have been associated with complex I deficiency and mitochondrial diseases. These disorders are a result of the dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and can cause a wide range of clinical manifestations from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Phenotypes include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, non-specific encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leigh syndrome, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson disease. Clinically, NDUFAF2 mutations have been associated with progressive encephalopathy and Leigh disease.

Biography Kageyoshi Noro was born in 1854 in Nagoya, Japan. After finishing his primary education in Nagoya and his secondary education in Tokyo, he studied mining and metallurgy at the college, which would later become part of Imperial University of Tokyo. After graduation in 1982, he became assistant to Curt Netto of his alma mater and continued to study metallurgy while he taught students. In 1885‚Äì89, Noro went to Europe to study mechanical engineering and electrical engineering at the University of London and metallurgy at Freiberg University of Mining and Technology, Netto's alma mater. Upon return to Japan, he became professor of his own alma mater and taught students, like Kuniichi Tawara (‰øµÂõΩ‰∏Ä), Kaichiro Imaizumi (‰ªäÊ≥âÂòâ‰∏ÄÈÉé) and others who would be the main force in Japan's metallurgy and steel industry. In 1891, he received Japan's first Doctor of Engineering degree from the Ministry of Education. Noro also worked for the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce to plan for the national government-owned steel plant, but was led to be involved in the Tokyo City Water Supply Tubes Incident, and distanced himself from any government work. When Japan's first modern government-owned steel plant was established in Kamaishi, Iwate, it didn't work properly. Noro helped Tanaka Ch≈çbei's Kamaishi Tanaka Plant, a privately owned plant nearby, to successfully work, by providing Japan's first coking oven, and the private plant eventually absorbed the government plant.Japanese Industrilisation - Historical and Cultural Perspectives\\" by Ian Inkster (Routledge, 2001) In 1895, the government appointed Kageyoshi Noro, along with Tsuyoshi Makino (ÁâßÈáéÊØÖ, who would later establish NKK) and others, on a commission to plan on a large-scale government-owned steel plant, but he was ousted in due course because he was against such a much hurried plan. In February 1901, Yawata Steel Works was opened with German help, but its production of iron at the blast furnace immediately stopped because of multiple technical problems, and the German advisers were all ousted. Noro was called in and several key corrections were made to resume production in July, 1904. It was the time of the Russo-Japanese War when the demand for iron and steel surged. In 1915, Noro established the Iron and Steel Institute of Japan (Êó•Êú¨ÈâÑÈãºÂçî‰ºö) and was elected the president of this organization. While having been suffering from the complications of pneumonia since March 1922, Noro heard that the building of the Iron and Steel Institute of Japan collapsed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of September 1, 1923. He died several days later, on September 8, 1923.

The property is owned by Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 March 2013.  History  In the 19th century names associated with Aboriginal groups in the district around Weereewaa (Lake George) were the Kamberri, Kgamberry, Nganbra and the Nganbra- Pialligo.(Jackson-Nakano: xviii) In the 1820s the first Europeans travelled beyond Weereewaa (Lake George) in search of the Murrumbidgee River and \\"discovered\\" the Molonglo Plains. Severe drought during the 1820s impelled colonists to search for more pasture land and in 1828 Major H. C. Antill from Picton sent his cattle and sheep to Molonglo Plains. The town of Queanbeyan grew up on the lands owned by innkeeper Timothy Beard, who had a collection of huts on the banks of Molonglo River. The town centre later shifted to the Queanbeyan River about one mile east and was officially proclaimed as a township in 1838 with a population of 50.(Queanbeyan Museum) From 1861 onwards new waves of British and European migrants arrived in the district to take advantage of the Robertson Land Acts and take up small allotments. Queanbeyan Aboriginal groups continued to host regular gatherings and corroborees and began to align these events with the annual government distribution of blankets. Archaeological evidence and historical records show that the Queanbeyan Showground site was a traditional gathering place and burial place for Aboriginal people. Aborigines are first recorded camping on the site some time in the period 1846-50. The memoirs of W. Davis Wright describe a group of Aboriginals camping on lands in Farrer Place across the street from the showground. Records show blanket distribution took place in 1841, 1844, and 1861. The 1861 gathering took place in early April and is specifically associated with the annual distribution of blankets to the Aborigines in preparation for winter. (The Golden Age 1861) A larger gathering is recorded in Queanbeyan in 1859 and another annual visit in 1861. The showground is specifically mentioned as the site of an 1862 gathering of tribes from Braidwood, Yass and Bland Plains.The Golden Age 1862 The gatherings of 1859 and 1862 which took place in June and April respectively were probably also connected with blanket distribution. Up until 1861 the blankets were distributed from the police station and court house located across Queanbeyan River; this seems to indicate the gatherings and camping took place at the showground site because it was a traditional location rather than for access to blankets.AHIMS Site Card 57-2-65 The available evidence suggests that the gatherings served a much more significant purpose than the acquisition of blankets. The visits of large numbers of Aborigines from distant areas and the holding of corroborees are recorded in connection with the 1859, 1861 and 1862 gatherings.(The Golden Age) Local tradition maintains that corroborees were held on the current showground reserve around this time. Indeed, the reserve was the site of the last Aboriginal corroboree held in the Queanbeyan district in 1862. Held over many weeks, the corroboree was attended by many hundreds of Aborigines. Tribes gathered from as far as the coast and the regions of the lower Lachlan and Murrumbidgee Rivers (Australian Heritage Database). Visiting groups included the Moolingoolah from Captains Flat and the upper Molonglo, Queanbeyan and Shoalhaven River districts, the Tinderry Mountains and Bungendore; Ngambri and Ngurma groups from Tumut, Brungle, Tuggeranong, Wanniassa, Pialligo, Yarralumla, Ginninderra, the Murrumbidgee regions and other parts of their extensive country; and even groups from Parramatta and Liverpool(Jackson-Nakano) The tribes congregated at or around the same time each year for celebratory and ceremonial purposes, with the current showground reserve serving as one of the important sites for these events. Among local Aboriginal people there is an oral tradition that the showground was formerly a camping ground for their ancestors. Part of the showground and some land to the south of it was also reputedly an Aboriginal burial ground. In his memoirs W. Davis Wright described the death of an Aboriginal man in a fight at a gathering on the current reserve in the period 1846-50 and that this person was buried on or near the site. According to AHIMS Site Card 57-2-65 in 1866, a local Queanbeyan resident discovered an Aboriginal skull, bones, a spear, a carved parrying shield and other Aboriginal implements on the showground: artefacts of a kind that were customarily buried with their deceased Aboriginal owners. The shield is said to have been given to the Historical Society. The site card also refers to an incident in 1935 where workmen digging a trench discovered the remains of an Aboriginal person buried in a sitting position on the northern side of West Avenue, approximately 80m south of the showground. In the Queanbeyan Showground Heritage Study historian Brendan O'Keefe refers to the 1935 find in West Avenue as well as the discovery of a burial during construction of the grandstand in 1939; the burial in the latter case was left in-situ and covered over.(O'Keefe) Most of the present showground reserve was included in a large area that was designated by 1862 as a Recreation Ground for the people of Queanbeyan. The ground was located on the south-western edge of the original square mile grid of streets laid out by Government of New South Wales Surveyor, James Larmer, in 1838. In 1883 the Queanbeyan Pastoral, Agricultural and Horticultural Association succeeded in having part of the Recreation Ground resumed and a 3.7 ha portion of itLot 4, Section 56dedicated as a showground. Agricultural shows were held on the ground from this date. By 1906 the showground was expanded by approximately 4 hectares.Lot 6, Section 56 This area had also been part of the original Recreation Ground. A segment of the showground reserve on its north-eastern side (part of Lot 6, Section 56) was sold to the Catholic Church in 1920 so that it could erect a church and school on the site. With the money realised by this sale a 1.5 ha strip of land along the southern boundary was added to the showground reserve. In 1939 the Council became the trustee of both the body of the showground and of the extension along Glebe Avenue. (Local Government Heritage Inventory Sheet) From its inception in 1893, the annual Queanbeyan Show developed into one of the most important community events in the Queanbeyan social calendar. Over the years the showground also became the venue for a variety of other activities. Trotting having become one of the main attractions of the annual shows, it was decided to construct a proper harness racing track on the ground in 1927. Until 1968 the showground track was one of New South Wales's most important venues for regular trotting meetings up. The showground also hosted carnivals, circuses and poultry exhibitions. Greyhound racing commenced in the early 1930s on a properly constructed coursing track. At the outbreak of World War II, the showground was used as the drill ground by the Canberra troop of light horse. On many occasions, the showground has served as an emergency caravan park when the Queanbeyan River has been in flood. (Local Government Heritage Inventory Sheet) At the Lowe Street entrance to the reserve there is a set of memorial gates erected in March 1934 to the memory of Thomas Collett, a Queanbeyan businessman, council alderman and founding member of the Queanbeyan Pastoral and Agricultural Association. The grandstand was built . The annual show continued to be popular after World War Two and continued to be a successful event until at least the early 1970s. After this time the show's fortunes began to decline and pressure to develop the showground increased. The site was seen by a majority of Queanbeyan City Council, the New South Wales Department of Lands and some local businesspeople as a valuable and underutilised piece of real estate close to the commercial heart of the city. In 1988, the council issued development plans for the showground. The development proposals roused considerable opposition in the city from various individuals and groups, including the Show Society, the Ngunnawal Land Council, the Monaro Conservation Society, the Queanbeyan and District Historical Society, the Coursing Club, the Trotting Association and a group specially formed to campaign for the retention of the showground, the Friends of Queanbeyan Showground. The council and Department of Lands pressed ahead and in mid-1989 twenty-four lots on Glebe Avenue were resumed. Following action by members of the Queanbeyan community, the New South Wales Legislative Council disallowed the resumption. The protracted dispute over the proposed development of the showground generated a great deal of publicity and a revival of interest in the ground. In the last few years, the annual show has undergone a strong resurgence.(Local Government Heritage Inventory Sheet)  Description  The following is an extract from the National Heritage Database: \\"The Queanbeyan Showground Reserve comprises a roughly triangular area of approximately 8.78ha (about 22 acres) in central Queanbeyan. The body of the reserve is composed of Lot 6 DP 1116082 and Lot 4, section 56, DP 758862 while a strip of land along Glebe Avenue consisting of Lots 1 to 24, DP 13963, contributes another 1.5ha to the ground. The whole of the area is Crown Land dedicated for showground purposes. The principal feature of the reserve is the showground arena, which has a trotting track on its perimeter and is overlooked by a grandstand. The grandstand is a brick building with a corrugated iron awning roof. A walkway runs across the front of the grandstand at the foot of the seating area and above the ground floor hall; the walkway, which has a balustrade, is accessed by stairways (not original) at each end of the building. The hall extends to the rear in a lean to form.\\" Gateway on Lowe Street, 2011 Also located on the grounds are other ancillary structures relating to the various uses of the showground. At the Farrer Place entrance to the site is a gateway constructed in 1934 as a memorial to J.T Collett, a Queanbeyan businessman, Council alderman and founder of the Agricultural Association. The gateway is a rendered masonry art-deco style parapet with two single pedestrian arches flanking a wider vehicular entrance archway. There is another matching gateway on Lowe Street. There are several mature trees on the ground, mainly at its western (Cameron Road) end. Archaeological finds and a burial have been recorded on the site. The structures and buildings on the site relate to the use of the reserve as a showground and as a place with various uses associated with recreation. The grandstand and other historic elements such as the original gates have local heritage value. There are no structures or buildings on the site which relate to the State significant Aboriginal history of the site. The site is intact as a showground. The cultural and historical significance are embodied in the place.  Heritage listing  The Queanbeyan Showground site is of strong cultural significance to the Aboriginal community. Historically the site is of value as a traditional camping and ceremonial place that was in use before and after European settlement. In the 19th century the site also became associated with gatherings of Aboriginal people for the annual government blanket distribution. The place has research potential as demonstrated in previous archaeological finds on the site. Aboriginal burials are also associated with the place. The showground site is a rare example of a place where large annual gatherings were held involving Aboriginal groups from surrounding districts and as far afield as the coast, the lower Lachlan and the Murrumbidgee Rivers. The cultural significance of these events continues to this day with the Aboriginal community demonstrating a strong connection to the place. The showground is valued by the Queanbeyan community for its social and cultural associations having been used over a long period for agricultural shows and a variety of recreational uses. The showground has historic and aesthetic significance at a local level. Queanbeyan Showground was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 March 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Queanbeyan Showground site is of historical value as a traditional camping and gathering place for Aboriginal people. Records of large gatherings of Aboriginal people were recorded in the area as early as 1841 and specifically on the showground site in 1862. These annual gatherings were important cultural occasions which included corroborees such as the one documented in 1862. According to oral tradition the showground site was a campground for the ancestors of local Aboriginal people. The annual gatherings were significant as they were attended by Aboriginal groups from as far afield as the coast, the regions of the lower Lachlan and Murrumbidgee Rivers. The congregation of tribes was an important means to communicate, trade and arrange marriages and were ceremonial as well as celebratory occasions. The showground site is also historically significant as an Aboriginal burial place. The showground site as an area of open space used for recreational purposes is important as a product of the original square-mile plan for Queanbeyan and demonstrates 19th century planning processes, distinctive customs and land use. The Queanbeyan Showground is historically significant at a local level as a country showground. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The area of the Queanbeyan Showground is associated with the Ngambri Aboriginal community. As well as being a camping and burial place, it was also a gathering place during the annual government distribution of blankets in preparation for winter. The showground also has important historical associations at a local level through the annual Queanbeyan Show and with recreational uses including competitive sports and entertainment. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The grandstand is a good example of a grandstand and together with the original entrance gates, has aesthetic value at a local level. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Queanbeyan Showground site is of high cultural significance to the Queanbeyan Aboriginal community. The local Aboriginal community has an oral tradition which demonstrates their cultural connection to this place through their ancestral history. Aboriginal people have strong connections to the place which are unchanged despite the century of recreational uses by the wider community. A sense of place and identity is embodied in the place. The showground is valued by the Queanbeyan community for its social and cultural associations having been used over a long period for agricultural shows and a variety of recreational uses. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Documented archaeological finds throughout the 20th century, together with records on the Aboriginal Heritage Information Management System of the Office and Environment and Heritage, indicate that Queanbeyan Showground has archaeological potential. Whilst the more recently found artefacts are thought to possibly have originated in fill material brought on to the site, there are records of a burial being found beneath the grandstand and another nearby in West Avenue. There are also records that refer to ceremonial objects being found on the site.(Feary and Shaughnessy) The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site of Queanbeyan showground is a rare example of a well documented Aboriginal ceremonial and camping place that was used during the 19th century as well as prior to European settlement. The description of the corroboree held on the site in 1862 provides a rare insight into Aboriginal ceremonial practices in NSW in the 19th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Showground site is an excellent example of an Aboriginal ceremonial and camping place in use both before and after European settlement. The place exemplifies the resilience of Aboriginal culture in the time of colonial expansion.

The Burckhardt House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural features and significance as the home of Reverend Oliver J. Burckhardt and Anna Jones Burckhardt.  Description  The Burckhardt House is unique in Lincoln architecture because of its Prairie Box/American Foursquare style. The house follows a simple, rectangular plan, and features a cross gabled roof with return box eaves on the south facing front gable, a shed roofed dormer on the west side, and a hip roof porch on the front facade. Though not originally present, the exterior asphalt faux-brick siding was added to the home by the Burckhardts in 1939 and thus contributes to the building's historicity. A full-width porch--featuring neoclassical wooden columns on concrete block supports and a wooden balustrade with simple square-section balusters--dominates the south facade of the home where the main entrance is found. The house also features a small, second- story wooden balcony on the east facade and double-hung windows with decorative muntins in the upper sash.  The Burckhardts  Reverend Oliver J. Burckhardt, born in Howard County, Missouri in 1868, was a local leader for the African American community in Lincoln. Rev. Burckhardt graduated from Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City, Missouri, a college founded by African American Civil War veterans, before moving to Lincoln in 1890. In 1898, Rev. Burckhardt married Anna Jones (b. 1868, Burlington, Iowa). The Burckhardts became influential leaders in Lincoln both within the African American community and the city as a whole. Oliver served as a minister and missionary for the African Methodist Church. He is credited with helping to settle over two hundred African Americans in the Brownlee area of Cherry County, Nebraska between 1910 and 1912 as well as establishing St. James church in the town. Rev. Burckhardt was also a key figure in the creation of the Lincoln branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1918. Burckhardt recruited prominent local individuals, including the lieutenant governor and governor of Nebraska, to join the NAACP. Burckhardt, along with J.E. Jeltz and William Woods, successfully prevented The Birth of a Nation from being shown in Lincoln, based on the legal argument that the film was intended to \\"inflame public opinion against blacks\\" despite African American contributions to the war effort. Burckhardt was instrumental in the formation of the Christian Alliance and the Lincoln Urban League in 1932, and was frequently consulted by local government officials for advice on issues regarding the African American community in Lincoln. Burckhardt also served as the Associate Chaplain at the State Penitentiary for twenty years before moving to Omaha following his wife's death in 1945 to become the pastor of the Church of Christ Holiness until his death in 1951. Anna Burckhardt was a self- taught artist of national acclaim, an almost impossible feat for an African American woman in her time. Anna is best known for her oil paintings and china paintings, receiving a bronze medal for her china painting at the 1907 Jamestown Virginia Tercentennial Exposition. Anna was well-loved in Lincoln, offering private art lessons to children of all races for over 40 years. Anna was also pioneering as one of very few commissioned artists of color, creating works for the People's City Mission--a local homeless advocacy center and shelter--and was even hired by the State of Nebraska to restore several paintings in the Nebraska State Capitol.

Straightwashing is seen most prominently in works of fiction, especially television and cinema, whereby characters who were originally portrayed as homosexual, bisexual, or asexual are misrepresented as heterosexual. Straightwashing is a relatively contemporary term which has increased in usage and acknowledgement in recent years. Despite increasing presence and recognition on U.S. television, queer characters and storylines are still subject to empirical examples of straightwashing. Common justifications for straightwashing include \\"producers' concerns about audience reactions and social norms and stereotypes regarding acceptable forms of queerness.\\" Terminology Etymologically, straightwashing is derived from the term 'whitewash', which alludes to \\"both censorship and the intersectional link with the discrimination faced by people of color.\\" Straightwashing differs from \\"pinkface\\", the use of straight actors to play LGB roles or characters. Anna King of Time Out likens \\"pinkface\\" to blackface. The LGB community raised concerns about the film Br√ºno, in which the straight actor Sacha Baron Cohen plays the role of a gay man to \\"...mak[e] fun of the queer community\\". In fiction Dragos Manea distinguishes between changing a queer character in fiction into a straight character; toning down the queer aspects of a character to make the character more acceptable to a heterosexual audience; removing queer referents from marketing posters or DVD covers; and changing the depiction of entire queer cultures or societies into a heterosexual version. =Film= In fiction, the practice of straightwashing has particularly been noted in screenplays based on comic books. The X-Men character Mystique is depicted as bisexual in the comic books, but in the films, she is shown as straight. Within the comic books published by Marvel comics, Mystique had romantic relationships with both male and female characters. Her most prominent relationship was with Destiny, a female \\"fellow member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with whom she raised a child.\\" Within the X-Men films that date back to the year 2000, the character Mystique, now played by the actress Jennifer Lawrence, has not had any relationship or interest in another female character. The 2015 film Stonewall was accused of straightwashing and of the related practice of \\"ciswashing\\" for not including a representation of the two black and supposedly trans activists who launched the Stonewall riots. The NBC TV drama Rise has been criticized for changing the basis of the production, a \\"real-life gay drama teacher\\" in a working class town, into a straight man; Out magazine calls it \\"cultural theft and [gay] erasure\\" that \\"should have been the story of a complicated LGBTQ hero\\". In Stuart Richard's article \\"The Imitation Game and the 'straightwashing' of film\\", about the film The Imitation Game, Richards states that WW II code breaker \\"Alan Turing's [gay] sexuality is downplayed and used as a plot device\\", to show him as a \\"tragic hero and an eccentric, secretive man\\"; to make the film \\" 'safe' for a potentially conservative audience\\", the film only depicts him romantically with Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley). =Television= The character John Constantine, played by the actor Matt Ryan, from the NBC television series Constantine has been highly criticized for not displaying the same sexuality that was originally written in the DC comic book series, Constantine: Hellblazer. The TV executives decided that John Constantine's bisexuality was not to be included in the TV show and he was depicted as a straight male. However, when Ryan reprised the role on Legends of Tomorrow, the character was portrayed as bisexual. The TV series Riverdale from The CW television network has been subject to criticisms about their depiction of one of the main characters Jughead Jones (played by American actor Cole Sprouse) as a straight male character. According to an interview with comicbook.com, Chip Zdarsky, the author of the Jughead comic book, stated that he wrote Jughead as an asexual character. Many people \\"within the asexual community are upset about the development of the TV series, Riverdale, on the CW\\". =Video games= Games such as Blizzard's World of Warcraft can be seen as inherently queer, since in the game both gender and sexuality are fluid and customizable. Here, the possibility of playing a non-straight main character is developmental. However, in 2010 Blizzard began to \\"straighten\\" many parts of the game by removing the majority of the The heteronormativity can be seen as a movement towards homophobia especially seen in two parts of the game which were added in 2010. First, is entitled \\"Shafted\\". Evocative of phallic penetration, the task is to \\"shoot 10 players with the Silver Shafted Arrow\\", which is a special holiday item that creates a small, cupid-like goblin that flits about the target. Both the item and quest flirt with the titillation and anxiety over penetrative sex, specifically anal or male-on-male sex. The second is entitled \\"Flirting with Disaster\\", and requires the player to \\"get completely smashed, put on your best perfume, throw a handful of rose petals on Sraaz [an Alliance NPC] or Jeremiah Payson [a Horde NPC] and then kiss him. You'll regret it in the morning.\\" The humorous intention of \\"Flirting with Disaster\\" is for a male avatar to kiss another male. When a player character drinks in-game to the point of being \\"completely smashed\\", the game clouds the player's screen as if everything becomes drunkenly blurry and unfocused. This confusion begins the joke that they must engage in a kind of \\"gay chicken\\" and flirt with a male toon. The \\"regret\\" the player character supposedly feels is one of homophobic shame excused by the fiction of drunken experimentation or ignorance. Zynga's FrontierVille game, is \\"a wild west-themed social game that allows users to tame the wilderness, grow a family, and build a thriving frontier town.\\" Zynga is allowing players to create virtual families by customizing a spouse in order to raise a virtual family. The game does not set a gender to your spouse, opening a place for queer possibility. The video game Undertale has \\"been straight-washed by many writers and fans\\", leading to the \\"erasure of the queerness found in Undertale and a recasting of the game as one that jibes with the interests of heterosexual male gamers\\".Ruberg, Bonnie. 2018. \\"Straightwashing Undertale: Video Games and the Limits of LGBTQ Representation.\\" In \\"The Future of Fandom,\\" special 10th anniversary issue, Transformative Works and Cultures, no. 28. https://dx.doi.org/10.3983/twc.2018.1516. Edmond Chang, an assistant professor of women's and gender studies at the University of Oregon, gave a speech at the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2016 entitled \\"Brown Skins, White Avatars: Racebending and Straightwashing in Digital Games\\". Chang states that video games such as Assassin's Creed and World of Warcraft \\"manipulate race and sexuality, reinforce stereotypes and sometimes lack diversity\\". Heidi McDonald conducted a survey which statistically positioned BioWare as the industry leader of game romances, both gay and straight. BioWare's romance content has been evolving towards more inclusive romances for over 15 years. Females were more supportive of wanting more queer romance content than males; however, more than half of straight males were also supportive of this. In current affairs After the mass shooting of gay men at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, a gay club, some commentators did not refer to the LGBT victims, with the Republican National Committee denouncing \\"violence against any group of people simply for their lifestyle or orientation\\" and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not mentioning LGBT people in his statement. Activist John Becker stated that media are \\"straightwashing\\" the attack by \\"downplaying or even omitting the fact that the shooting was a crime of hatred against the LGBT community\\". During the 2018 Winter Olympics' Opening Ceremony, the television network NBC did not \\"mention or highlight a single out LGBTQ athlete in its three hours of Opening Ceremony coverage\\"; the network did not acknowledge the only \\"publicly out American woman at the Games\\" or the first four \\"openly gay [men] at the Olympic Games\\" A promotional video campaign created by the Provincetown Chamber of Commerce shows the town's busy nightlife and artists, but the advertisement makes no mention of the town's active LGBT community, in what some LGBT activists call an example of straightwashing. In the Philadelphia's gay neighbourhoods, gay bars such as Woody's are facing \\"straight gentrification\\", becoming, in effect, \\"gay-themed straight bar[s]\\" where straight men and women predominate, a trend triggered by the desire of straight women for spaces where they will not be harassed by straight men, the rise of gay dating apps such as Grindr (which reduce the need for going to gay clubs), rising rents and gentrification, and increasing mainstream acceptance of LGB people and their spaces. Bob Skiba states that the \\"pattern is that gays move into a seedy area, make it their own and transform it. It then becomes desirable to straights who see it as both exotic and safe.\\" An LGBTI club in Sydney, The Imperial Hotel, was accused of straight-washing the venue by removing the rainbow flags prior to a visit from the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. He is a Pentecostal Christian who previously voted against same-sex marriage in the Australian legislature. While local artists and LGBTI community members have called for a boycott of the business, the venue denies the accusations. Lotte Jeffs has criticized the \\"straight-washing\\" of the London (UK) LGBT Pride event, stating that rather than focus on recognizing the rights of queer, trans and non-heterosexual people, it has switched to making the LGBT event \\"palatable for the masses\\" and for heterosexual people who will attend. She says that while big companies sponsor activities and include rainbow-themes in their publicity materials, they hire straight celebrities to endorse products and brands for the event, with few \\"dar[ing] to use the words \\"gay\\", \\"lesbian\\", \\"trans\\" or \\"bi\\" when they show their support for Pride\\". History In the US, from 1930 to 1968, the Motion Picture Production Code caused major studios to eliminate gay characters or references from movies. The 1995 documentary The Celluloid Closet shows how some screenwriters and directors tried to subtly introduce gay characters, roles or themes, without it being noticed, such as with Gore Vidal adding in a gay relationship in Ben-Hur. The Motion Picture Production Code also led to the elimination of depictions of bisexuality in the film version of Truman Capote's novel Breakfast at Tiffany's. In the book, the male \\"artsy gigolo-writer\\" had \\"male and female clients\\", but in the movie, he is only shown with Holly Golightly. As well, the Code led to the elimination of a gay relationship in the film version of Tennessee Williams' play Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. In the play, Brick Pollit is depicted as being the lover of a family patriarch named Skipper. In the 1958 film version, the story arc of the gay relationship is replaced with a story of Skipper's frustration over his faded football career and a heterosexual sexless marriage. Historical accounts of lesbian suffragettes Eva Gore-Booth and Esther Roper in some cases straightwash their sexuality, with the historian Gifford Lewis claiming they were not lesbian or queer in his biographies of them. The New York Times published no more than two front-page articles per year that made any kind of references to gays from the end of World War II through until 1965. It did not improve much over the following 20 years either. It was rare that anything published was positive; most saw gays as security threats in the time of the Cold War. Gross (2001) pointed out gays invisibility in this time period along with their concerns being publicly excluded. In 1981, the AIDS crisis also received little media attention, even with the death rate rising rapidly. The New York Times did not mention AIDS until many years after the outbreak and finally made the front page in 1983. Alwood (1996), Kinsella (1989) and Shilts (1987) all commented on The Times silence in relation to LGBT issues, especially the AIDS crisis. Coverage in the New York Times remained infrequent until the mid 1980s and then increased dramatically. This change in media is seen to be reflective of changes in society. Rock Hudson's death, Ronald Reagan's statements on AIDS in 1987, and President Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign proposal and the early 1993 congressional debate over the ban on lesbians and gays in the military all increased Times coverage of lesbian and gay issues.

How people are defined, and what defined them ‚Äì be it their anatomy or their energy or both ‚Äì depends on culture and time. Culture not only defines how sex is perceived but also how gender is defined. Today gender, sex, and identity continue to be of much debate and change based on what place and people are being examined. The early modern idea of the body was a cultural ideal, an understanding and approach to how the body works and what place that body has in the world. All cultural ideals of the body in the early modern period deal with deficiencies and disorders within a body, commonly told through a male ideal. Ideas of the body in the early modern period form the history of how bodies should be and how to correct the body when something has gone wrong. Therefore, early modern conceptions of the body were not biological as there was not a restrictive biological view of the human body as established by modern science. Conceptions of the body are primarily either eastern, based in China and involving practices such as Traditional chinese medicine, or western, which follows the Greek traditions of science and is more closely related to modern science despite original anatomists and ideas of the body being just as unscientific as Chinese practices. __TOC__ Historiography 'Man of Sorrows' by Maarten van Heemskerck (1498‚Äì1574). Porter opened his article 'History of the Body' by discussing Renaissance paintings which drew attention to Christ's penis, and how scholars had ignored this aspect of them. In Western historical research, scholars began investigating the cultural history of the human body in detail in the 1980s.Caroline Bynum, 'Why All the Fuss about the Body? A Medievalist's Perspective', Critical Inquiry, 22.1 (Autumn, 1995), 1-33 (pp. 3-8). The movement is particularly associated with the historian of medicine Roy Porter, whose 1991 article 'History of the Body' was a seminal study.Roy Porter, 'History of the Body', in New Perspectives on Historical Writing, ed. by Peter Burke (University Park, Pa., 1991), pp. 206-32. 1995 saw the foundation of the journal Body and Society,Peter Burke, What is Cultural History?, 2nd edn (Cambridge: Polity, 2008), p. 73. by which time the field of the history of the body was already extensive and diverse.Caroline Bynum, 'Why All the Fuss about the Body? A Medievalist's Perspective', Critical Inquiry, 22.1 (Autumn, 1995), 1-33. Porter pointed out that Western historiography had previously assumed mind‚Äìbody dualism (i.e. that the body is fundamentally separate from the mind or soul) and therefore that the cultural history of bodies as material objects had been overlooked: 'given the abundance of evidence available, we remain remarkably ignorant about how individuals and social groups have experienced, controlled, and projected their embodied selves. How have people made sense of the mysterious link between \\"self\\" and its extensions? How have they managed the body as an intermediary between self and society?' He emphasised that the history of the body is important to understanding histories of coercion and control, sex and gender, and other important but culturally varied aspects of human experience.Roy Porter, 'History of the Body', in New Perspectives on Historical Writing, ed. by Peter Burke (University Park, Pa., 1991), pp. 206-32 (quoting pp. 211-12). Another prominent voice in the field at the same time was Caroline Walker Bynum, whose 1988 Holy Feast and Holy Fast became a landmark study.Peter Burke, What is Cultural History?, 2nd edn (Cambridge: Polity, 2008), p. 74. Both Bynum and Porter noted that during the 1980s Western history of the body research drew on post-structuralist thought, such as Michel Foucault's ideas of biopolitics and biopower, which emphasised that state power is not abstract, but exercised through and over human bodies. But both expressed a concern that research was focusing too much on discourse about bodies, rather than on material bodies themselves. Drawing on Mikhail Bakhtin's 1965 Rabelais and His World, they promoted a more materially orientated direction in the history of the body. Another seminal study around the same time was Thomas Laqueur's 1990 Making Sex: Body and Gender from Greeks to Freud, which explored the social importance of different conceptions of the sexed body over time.Laqueur, Thomas (1990). Making Sex: Body and Gender From the Greeks to Freud. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. .  Ebers Papyrus  Ebers Papyrus from the National Library of Medicine The Ebers Papyrus is an Egyptian medical text and is the oldest known record of the human body, dating back to 3000 BC. The Ebers Papyrus describes the body by physical examination and what can be felt. Clinical investigations such as the Pulse, percussion of the body, the recognition of diseased or disordered states. ‚ÄúIf thou examinst a swelling of the covering of his belly‚Äôs horns above his pudenda (sex organs) then thou shalt place thy finger on it and examine his belly and knock on the fingers (percuss) if thou examinst his that has come out and has arisen by his cough. Then thou shalt say concerning it: it is a swelling of the covering of his belly. It is a disease which I will treat‚Äù. The distinct medical tone focuses on what can be felt externally to infer the maladies of the body. The body was born in the correct state but could was fallible and fixable with the correct intervention and feeling and using the senses to identify what has gone wrong. The Ebers Papyrus refers to many god-like and spiritual infestations of the body that could not be explained at the time. Despite the explanations for maladies by spiritual rational, the interventions described to investigate and see the body were distinctly disconnected for the spirit or life force of the body and was principally about what could be seen or touched. Descriptions of the exact placement of the heart within the body, the circulation of blood are in no doubt accurate as Egyptians practiced embalming their dead by removal of organs and placement of them in jars.  Medical Body in Ancient Greece  Painting of Aristotle Greek philosophers separated the body and the energy of the body into separate but equal and interacting categories. Aristotle defined the energy which gives the body its movement as the soul. The soul and the body are therefore linked but can remain separate entities. This is in refutation of Dualists who view the body and mind as separate states and should be treated and examined differently and Materialists who view all parts of the body, even the soul as having a physical manifestation in the body. Aristotle finds the middle ground and accepts both of these views, that the soul has aspects that can't be felt by normal methods, and physical manifestations that can be felt. > \\"For even if one and being are spoken of in several ways, what is properly > so spoken of is the actuality\\" -Aristotle in DeAnima Aristotle forms the idea of Hylomorphism, that the soul and the body are not capable of being split apart without destroying both in the process. Despite this idea of the body and the soul Aristotle viewed disorder in what could be seen and felt. He was a proponent of the humoral theory that classified disorder as imbalances of the 4 fluids of the body. Aristotle was unable to dissect humans but did so to many animals and was an early founder of comparative anatomy. Aristotle did contend quasi spiritual manifestations of the body principally through sexual distinctions. He wrote that the sex of humans: ‚Äúis determined by the male principle already contained in the semen. If this is not strong enough, then the opposite must necessarily come into existence, and the opposite of man is woman.‚Äù Aristotle clearly superimposed man as the more important figure in men and women but presents an almost Qi like representation of how sexes are defined. Aristotle presents it as a physical manifestation in semen, but in context to his descriptions of the soul and body it is not clear that he meant something physical.  European Judeo-Christian  European ideologies of the body define disorder as only things that can be touched or explored. If something could not be explored then intrusions into these areas were performed. Therefore, the body in Greek and European cultures is defined as being ailed by something physical, something that can be found and altered to produce order. Judeo-Christian ideologies have heavily influenced the definitions of the body and its disorders and therefore the male body is often explained in place of the female body. = The one-sex body model = A major intervention in the history of the body in the West was Thomas W. Laqueur's 1990 book Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud. Laqueur argued that from the eighteenth century into the late twentieth, Western societies had generally thought of humans as having two fundamentally sexes, male and female. But Laqueur argued that from ancient times, the prevailing intellectual understanding of sex was that women were anatomically simply an inferior form of men. For example, Renaldus Columbus, writing about what he proposed as the discovery of the clitoris, stated that, \\"like a penis, \\"if you touch it, you will find it rendered a little harder and oblong to such a degree that it shows itself as a sort of male member.\\" (There was much debate on the actual discovery of the clitoris between male European scientists and many claimed to have described it first: by dissecting the human body and writing down what was observed these European scientists could claim in their idea of the body that they had discovered or created new knowledge.) This one-sex model was seen as consistent, in Abrahamic thought, with the Genesis creation narrative, in which Eve is formed from Adam's rib. Laqueur's argument has been enormously influential on the history of the body in the West,Helen King, The One-Sex Body on Trial: The Classical and Early Modern Evidence (Farnham: Ashgate, 2013), . and applied by historians to a range of societies outside Laqueur's original scope, such as medieval Iceland.Carol J. Clover, ‚ÄòRegardless of Sex: Men, Women, and Power in Early Northern Europe‚Äô, Speculum, 68 (1993), 363‚Äì87 [repr. in Studying Medieval Women: Sex, Gender, Feminism, ed. by Nancy Partner (Cambridge, 1993), pp. 61‚Äì93. However, scholars specialising in pre- eighteenth-century history have often been critical of the idea that the one- sex body really was dominant in everyday life, or even in intellectual circles. = The Vitruvian Man = The Vitruvian Man is a drawing by leonardo Divinci that depicts the European ideal of a man. The figure is extremely muscular and focuses on the exterior of the body, what can be see and felt. This was the standard of beauty of humans and continues to be the ideal body of European traditions. There is no Vitruvian women.  Medical body in East Asian medical literature  Representation of the body in East Asian Medical Literature. Lines represent areas of the body that connect by energy. Eastern ideologies of the body explain what can be detected, not only felt and examined. This comes from the idea that there is not only what can be physically seen and touched but what can't be. Energy or more aptly the means by which your body can manifest itself in the world can't be seen but, was thought to be able to be detected. Definitions of the body and its disorders therefore focus on physical manifestations of energy through the body. This is mostly seen in Chinese Traditional Medicine and has today been explained in physical ways by modern science. The ideal body of east Asian medical literature was not muscular and instead focused on key energy manifestations in the body for directed therapy. = Yellow Emperors body = The Yellow Emperor's Body is a term derived from the references to the Yellow Emperor within the Ancient Chinese book, the \\"book of change\\". The Term describes the references to both the physical body that can be touched, felt, and interact with the physical world, but also the sense of person and self that the body. The dualism of the body as both the physical self and the subjective consciousness is how Chinese defined the body. The Yellow Emperor's body is a metaphor to describe a body that focuses on the individual and not the general, focusing on disorder as not just a physical malady. The yellow emperor is revered in China and was the founder of acupuncture. The yellow emperor is said to of derived his medical practices from a conversation with a community physician. The manuscript is recorded in the Yellow Emperors Inner Cannon, and it being recorded in this way represents the attention to the individuals perspective in creating therapies like acupuncture to treat body ailments. The Inner Cannon was revised by natural Philosophers of the time and the approved version of the Han Court and became a foundational text for the ideals and perceptions of the human body. It focused on Qi, Yin and Yang balance, and Five phase theory to explain health can disease.  Qi  Referred to as the life force of the body, or the means by which the body is able to be animated. Qi is not limited to the physical but is intertwined with the cosmological. A tiny bit of qi, known as primordial qi is integrated in humans at birth. As one grows it is due to the primordial qi, as one fades it is because of the qi, and when one dies it is because their qi has been exhausted.  Yin and Yang  These are variations and representations of qi that define how a human exists in the world, a system of complementary opposites. Yin and Yang defined gender differences seen in the population. A baby born male simply had more Yang Qi energy where as a female has dominant Yin energy. Transgenderism, hermaphroditism and other variations of the body can be explained by the Yin and Yang Qi ideas of the body much better than the European counterparts.  Five Phases  Other types of change in the world were classified by Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water. Applied to the body these 5 forces were the Liver, Heart, Spleen, Lung, and Kidney. These representations of the physical world in the body was understood dynamically and represents a deeper connection to the non animate objects and surroundings of a human. The body was not only physical sphere but a cosmological one interconnected to all physical and non physical quantities of life. = Disorders - Cheng Congzhou = The clinician and patient encounter is a spiritual connection. It is not just about what is done but what is said and how it is said, how information is revealed and what information is not. Cheng Congzhou a physician in 1581 was a local doctor in Yangshou and documented his patient encounters in detail. The importance of not only qi but blood is seen in his records: > Fang Shunian's mother, the scholar's Honored Lady,4 was sixty three years > old. Her constitution was naturally weak and emaciated. Her qi and Blood > were both depleted. Normally all her six pulses were extremely \\"subtle\\" and > \\"fine\\"; even when she caught cold they did not become very \\"big\\" or > \\"pounding.\\" The interactions of the physical body and the cosmological essence of a body was how disorders of the body was framed in this doctors account.  The corpse  The practices surrounding a corpse differ widely among cultures. Diogenes is famously said to have wanted his lifeless body to be thrown to the wolves so that his body can return to nature. Cultural practices that revere the dead across all cultures reveal that even in European cultures that attempt to adhere purely to what can be seen and touched, recognize that there is a more cosmic necessity to the body and connection to the physical and cosmological worlds.

Formed in mid-1919 on the Eastern Front as the Orenburg Rifle Division, it was soon redesignated as the 49th Rifle Division. It fought in the defeat of White troops in west Kazakhstan and on the southern Ural River. In early 1920 it was transferred west to the North Caucasus and participated in the offensive that defeated the Armed Forces of South Russia, before being disbanded. A second formation was formed in December 1920 as the 20th Rifle Division of the Internal Service Troops and redesignated as the 49th in March 1921, but itself disbanded in April.  History  = First formation = The division was formed by orders of 17 June 1919 with the 1st Army of the Eastern Front as the Orenburg Rifle Division from the units defending Orenburg against the White Eastern Front of Alexander Kolchak. It was renumbered as the 49th Rifle Division on 5 July, and fought in the Aktyubinsk operation between 14 August and 14 September, during which it advanced as part of the Orenburg group, fighting near Akbulak, Aktyubinsk, and Orsk and on the Ik and Utva Rivers. In accordance with a 16 September order of the Turkestan Front and 18 and 21 September orders of the 1st Army, the 49th was renamed the 49th Fortress Division and subordinated to the Orenburg Fortified Region. The 1st and 3rd Brigades of the division joined the newly formed Iletsk group of forces on 8 October. From 2 November to 10 January 1920, they fought in the Uralsk‚ÄìGuryev Operation, advancing in the area of Iletsk with the Iletsk shock group. Both brigades transferred to the 4th Army of the Eastern Front on 1 December, followed by the remainder of the division on 4 December. On 12 January the division transferred to the 11th Army of the Caucasian Front, fighting in the North Caucasus operation against the remnants of the Armed Forces of South Russia until 7 April. During the operation, the division advanced towards Stavropol, in the area of Yessentukhi, and the stanitsa of Razdolny. After the defeat of the Armed Forces of South Russia, the 49th was disbanded on 21 April, with its personnel used to reinforce the 20th Rifle Division. = Second formation = The 20th Rifle Division of the Internal Service Troops (VNUS) was formed in accordance with 1 and 15 December 1920 orders of the Transvolga Military District. From January to April it protected food supplies and fought insurgents in Samara and Orenburg Governorates. On 14 March 1921 the division was redesignated as the 49th Rifle Division in accordance with the transfer of VNUS troops to the Red Army on 4 March. The headquarters of the 49th was quickly disbanded on 19 April, while its troops became the 145th and 148th Rifle Brigades.

After Captain Reddie returned from this voyage he was one of the many captains that at the behest of the Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne, wrote a testimonial endorsing a reward to Thomas Earnshaw for his chronometer.Maskelyne (1804), p.5. =EIC voyage #4 (1804-1805)= Captain William Donaldson acquired a letter of marque on 23 February 1804. He sailed from Portsmouth on 9 June 1804. Neptune was part of a convoy of nine Indiamen, all bound for China: , Arniston, , Cuffnells, , , , and . provided the escort.Evans: Finding my ancestors: Voyage of the Athenienne to China in 1804/1805. The fleet arrived at Rio de Janeiro around 14‚Äì18 August; Neptune arrived on 17 August. The fleet left Rio on 1 September and later passed the Cape of Good Hope. To avoid French ships reported to be in the Indian Ocean, the fleet sailed towards Western Australia, rather than to the Straits of Malacca. The fleet sailed to Norfolk Island via Bass Strait; Norfolk Island was the next rendezvous point after Saint Paul Island, for members that had separated. Neptune arrived at Whampoa on 13 January 1805.

Neptune was at the Cape of Good Hope on 7 August and Penang on 14 October, and arrived at Whampoa on 18 January 1807. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 23 February. However, while Neptune was at Canton in March, a major incident occurred. Thirty or forty seamen from Neptune scuffled with a number of Chinese and overmatching the Chinese, drove them away. The next day two to three thousand Chinese appeared opposite to the factory where Captain Buchanan was staying. They started throwing stones and brickbats, and attempted to force the closed gate. They returned on the third day, when the seamen sallied forth with walking sticks. The sailors succeeded in dispersing the crowd, but one of the Chinese, on returning home, suddenly died. The Chinese government demanded that the British deliver up the seaman who had struck the blow that proved fatal. The British replied that it was impossible to determine who that man was, and that it would be unjust to pick one seaman at random. The Chinese government was adamant and forbade the entire fleet of Indiamen from leaving. A local Chinese merchant who was acting as security merchant for Neptune was forced to sign an agreement that imperiled his life and fortune if he did not produce the guilty seaman in 10 days.The Asiatic Annual Register, Or, A View of the History of Hindustan, and of the Politics, Commerce and Literature of Asia, (1811), Volume 10, pp.1-3. A seaman was given up as hostage and both Neptune and the other Indiamen eventually sailed.The Asiatic Annual Register, Or, A View of the History of Hindustan, and of the Politics, Commerce and Literature of Asia, (1811), Volume 10, p.120. It was expected that the Chinese court would order the man expelled back to his home country.The Asiatic Annual Register, Or, A View of the History of Hindustan, and of the Politics, Commerce and Literature of Asia, (1811), Volume 10, pp.33-4. Neptune was at Penang again on 3 July and the Cape on 19 September. She reached St Helena on 13 October and Crookhaven on 17 December, before arriving at the Downs on 17 February 1808. On 8 November 1807 the Mandarin of the Chinese court demanded that the hostage seaman be surrendered to the court. The British refused and the situation worsened until fortuitously arrived at Macao. The Chinese government signaled that it would not pursue the matter further and the British agreed that the hostage would leave with the next fleet of Indiamen once the sentence of expulsion had been passed. Chinese officials had also received 120,000 dollars from Neptunes Chinese security merchant. =EIC voyage #6 (1809-1810)= Capt William Donaldson sailed from Portsmouth on 24 February 1809, bound for Bombay and China. Neptune reached Bombay on 25 June and Penang on 31 August, and arrived at Whampoa on 6 November. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 22 December, reached St Helena on 21 May 1810, and arrived at The Downs on 28 July. =EIC voyage #7 (1812-1813)= Captain Donaldson sailed from Torbay on 4 January 1812, bound for Bombay and China. Neptune reached Johanna on 6 April and Bombay on 7 May. On her way to China she was at Penang on 13 July and Malacca on 25 July, before arriving at Whampoa on 22 September. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 18 December, reached St Helena on 27 March 1813, and arrived at The Downs on 5 June. =EIC voyage #8 (1813-1815)= Captain Edward Smith Ellis sailed from Portsmouth on 31 December 1813, bound for Bombay and China. Neptune reached Bombay on 22 May 1814, and arrived at Whampoa on 30 November.

She reached St Helena on 19 April and arrived at The Downs on 23 June. =Private trade= By one report between 1815 and 1819 Neptune was in private trade to India as a licensed ship. However, neither Lloyd's Register nor the Register of Shipping for those years provides any corroboration. Fate In 1819 Neptune was sold for breaking up.

Young is an American police officer who has served as the sheriff of Gadsden County, Florida since 2004. Young became the second black sheriff in Florida history when he was elected, and as of 2018, he was the longest serving African American sheriff in Florida.  Biography  Morris A. Young attended James A. Shanks High School and the Institute of Police Technology and Management at Chipola College. Young is a member of the National Sheriffs‚Äô Association. Young regularly participates in Gadsden County's annual breast cancer awareness walk, which lasts 12 hours and crosses Gadsden county. = Death of cousin = In 2014, Young's cousin Jonathon Ferrell, a football player, was unarmed with open hands on camera when he was fatally shot by white law enforcement officer Randall \\"Wes\\" Kerrick. Kerrick was arrested based on the video footage and was indicted for criminal manslaughter, but the judge declared a mistrial and the case was never retried. Young said of the incident that Ferrell had always been on the right track and was only looking for help after getting into a traffic collision late at night, yet \\"the next thing you know, law enforcement comes and sees a young black male at night in that neighborhood. And sometimes people react to that.\\"  Law enforcement  Young was a part of the Quincy Police Department for 11 years, where he served as a patrolman, a patrol sergeant and as a member of the narcotics task force. In 1999, Young began working for the Sheriff's Office as a school-resource officer and also worked on patrol and investigations. = Sheriff of Gadsden County = Young ran for sheriff of Gadsden County in 2000 and lost to incumbent Sheriff W. A. Woodham, who had held the office since 1971. Young ran again after Woodham retired, and became the sheriff of Gadsden County in 2004, making him the second black sheriff in Florida history, and the first in Gadsden county, despite the fact that the majority of residents in the county are African American. He soon hired Chaplain Jimmy Salters to help create a reintegration program in the Gadsden County Jail which involves the larger church community and is based on faith, including the baptism of willing inmates. Young has said he believes that it's important to appeal to the spiritual side of offenders, as opposed to focusing on purely punitive actions that lock away inmates for long periods of time without any type of help to prevent recidivism. Under his watch, Judge Kathy L. Garner, the county‚Äôs first black female judge, hears all juvenile cases in her jurisdiction. Having run unopposed in 2008, Young was re-elected in 2012, with 89 percent of the vote. He was re-elected again in 2016. In 2018, Young worked to train churches on how to respond to active shooters after a shooting occurred at a Texas church. In April 2020, Young was appointed to represent Gadsden on Governor Ron DeSantis' \\"Task Force to Reopen Florida\\" during the COVID-19 pandemic. = Furlough program court case = In 2014, State Attorney Willie Meggs forced Young to appear in front of 3rd Circuit Senior Judge Julian Collins, who found him guilty of indirect criminal contempt due to a program that allowed furloughs for inmates. The furlough program had been running for 32 years and allowed some inmates to leave custody, typically with an escort, for predetermined short periods of time up to 8 hours. During the case, former Monroe County Sheriff Allison DeFoor, and current Liberty County Sheriff Nick Finch, who served nearby counties in northern Florida, also testified they had granted similar furloughs in their position as Sheriff. Young was fined $500 and given a second-degree misdemeanor for allowing the furloughs to happen. Young has claimed the charge was politically motivated because, in addition to furloughs regularly being granted in nearby counties, the previous Sheriff W. A. Woodham had also granted furloughs. Young also pointed out that there were no state laws prohibiting furlough programs, and there were no court orders prohibiting furloughs for any of the cases cited. = Media profiles = In 2016, The New York Times profiled his work, and discussed how his programs have reduced crime and recidivism rates in Gadsden County. In July 2018, he was featured in The Guardian as a \\"radical sheriff giving offenders a chance.\\" The Guardian highlighted that since Young became sheriff in 2004, crime in Gadsden was about half of what it was when he obtained office, with juvenile arrests down by over 75%, and Gadsden county was sending 65% fewer inmates to state prison. Young credits daily coaching programs for children with incarcerated parents, helping inmates gain job skills, helping find employment opportunities for people after they've served time, and asking officials and deputies to focus on serious or violent crimes as opposed to locking people up for long periods due to drug possession or other low level offenses. He also worked with the local school superintendent, Reginald C. James, to establish an alternative school for children who are running into trouble with the law, which increased local graduation rates from 40% to 65% in 2016.

Two of the victims were identified as visiting Dera Sach Khand head Niranjan Dass, 68, and another leader, Rama Nand, 57, who suffered multiple gunshot wounds and died the next day in hospital. At least 15 others were injured, including 4 of the attackers, who were in the end subdued by the other worshipers. The incident sparked riots across northern India. Claims and denials of responsibility An email reportedly received by Radio Akash in London, purportedly from the Khalistan Zindabad Force, claimed responsibility for the attack. The Austriantimes.at reported that a later email purported to be from the Khalistan Zindabad Force denied all involvement in this attack. The later email appeared to have a scanned copy of KZF‚Äôs letterhead and contained a date change in longhand. This cast doubt on its authenticity. Austriantimes.at also reported that the visiting leaders had been warned for some time of possible violence against them. A 28 May 2009 Diepresse.com article reported that the identities of the 6 alleged Sikh attackers had been established. Five of the six had been questioned thoroughly, but the last, the alleged leader, was still too ill to interview, having been shot in the head. Of the six, all were males between 24 and 45 and from Punjab and other regions in northern India, two had entered the country illegally, and four had applied for asylum. It reported that Nirajnan Das was \\"on the road to recovery\\". Both the sixth alleged attacker and Nirajnan Das were reportedly under heavy guard at the hospital. An email received by The Tribune newspaper, purported to be from Ranjit Singh Jammu of the KZF, expressed sympathy for the \\"Ravidassia brotherhood\\" and denied any involvement. Akash Radio reported on its web site that it had received, on 29 May 2009, a third email purported to be from the KZF. In this third email, Akash reports, the KZF stated that \\"Indian agencies\\" used its letterhead to deny responsibility, and went on to emphasize that it took responsibility for the attack that resulted in the death of Rama Nand, and that KZF had sent the letter to an Indian newspaper which did not print the claim of responsibility, but which was quick to print the retraction. Arrest and trial One of the six suspects detained in connection with the attack was released due to lack of evidence. Four of the six offenders were Non-Resident Indian asylum seekers living in Austria and were identified as Satwinder Singh, 28, Jaspal Singh, 34, Tasum Singh, 45 and Sukhwinder Singh, 28. The other two attackers - Hardeep Singh, 33 and Charnjit Singh, 24, entered Austria illegally, authorities said. Amritpal Singh, a 26-year-old Sikh man of Indian origin, was arrested after a firefight with commandos of the Austrian police who raided his apartment while investigating the murder. After nearly 11 hours of deliberations, the jury found main defendant Jaspal Singh guilty of shooting Ramanand to death and he received a life-sentence; he was also convicted of attempted murder. Four men were convicted of aiding Singh and were sentenced to between 17 and 18 years, while one was found guilty of attempted coercion and received a 6-month sentence. The prosecutor had alleged that some of the men had travelled to Vienna from Barcelona in Spain with the aim of carrying out their crime.http://www.pravasitoday.com/indian-temple-attackers-get-jail-in-vienna-2 References Category:Massacres in religious buildings and structures Category:Massacres of Sikhs Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 2009 Category:Terrorist incidents in Austria Category:May 2009 events in Europe Category:Sikh terrorism in Austria Category:2009 in Austria Category:2009 in India Category:2009 crimes in Austria Category:2009 murders in Europe Category:2000s murders in Austria ","title":"Vienna temple attack"},{"id":"57975947","text":"The 2019 Outback Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 2019.

Le Mesurier was a British Army officer in the 1990s and also worked with the United Nations peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia. He was the director of the non-profit Mayday Rescue Foundation, headquartered in the Netherlands. Early life Le Mesurier was born on 25 May 1971 at RAF Changi in Singapore. He was the son of Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Havilland Churchill Le Mesurier, of the Royal Marines, and his Swedish wife, Ewa. He had an older sister. Actor John Le Mesurier was a relative. He was educated at Northaw prep school, Canford School and attended Ulster University (sponsored by the army), but for security reasons finished the final year of his degree at Aberystwyth University studying International Relations and Strategic Studies. Military and government service In 1994, Le Mesurier was commissioned into the Royal Green Jackets, British Army, as a second lieutenant (University Cadetship); the British Army was sponsoring him through university. Having graduated from university, he was appointed second lieutenant (on probation) on 20 June 1993 upon entering the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. At Sandhurst, he graduated top of class and won the Queens‚Äô Medal award. He was promoted to lieutenant on 11 August 1993, and to captain on 11 August 1996. He served with the Royal Green Jackets in Northern Ireland, and as an intelligence officer in Bosnia and Kosovo. In 1999, he worked as a Return and Reconstruction Task Force Officer at the Office of the High Representative in the former Yugoslavia. He retired from the military on 1 June 2000. Le Mesurier then worked for a year as a United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo Policy Advisor in the former Yugoslavia. He then became the Head of the Jericho Monitoring Mission for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 2002 to 2004, responsible for monitoring six Palestinian prisoners. Subsequently, he took an Advisor role at the Embassy of the United States, Baghdad. Private security work From 2005 to 2007, Le Mesurier worked for the British headquartered Olive Group (later merged into the U.S. Constellis Group). From 2008 to 2012, he worked for Good Harbor Consulting run by Richard A. Clarke, formerly National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-terrorism under U.S. Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush. His work included training the United Arab Emirates (UAE) oil and gas field protection force, designing security infrastructure for Abu Dhabi, and safety and security for the 2010 Arabian Gulf Cup in Yemen. From 2012 to 2014, Le Mesurier worked for the UAE consultancy Analysis, Research, and Knowledge (ARK), which stated its goal was to \\"help realise the legitimate political, social and economic aspirations of conflict-affected communities\\". In 2013, with the Turkish NGO AKUT Search and Rescue Association, ARK started training non-governmental Syrian civil defence teams in Turkey, funded by the UK, U.S. and Japanese governments and managed by Le Mesurier.  Work with the White Helmets  =Foundation and activities= Le Mesurier founded and was the director of Mayday Rescue, a charity that trained and supported Syrian volunteers in emergency response, including search and rescue of bombed buildings, and medical evacuation. The volunteer group developed into the White Helmets (a nickname for the Syria Civil Defence ‚Äì not to be confused with the official Syrian Civil Defence Forces), an organisation which was founded in 2013. By 2015, it was reported to have more than 2,700 volunteers. Le Mesurier told Al-Jazeera that by 2015 they had saved more than 24,000 people. \\"At the time, I was working in Istanbul ... and got together with a group of Turkish earthquake rescue volunteers\\", Le Mesurier told Al-Jazeera. Mayday Rescue reported that between 2014 and 2018 it received funding of $127 million, $19 million of which came from non-government sources and the remainder from Western governments. In the 2016 Birthday Honours, Le Mesurier received an OBE \\"for services to Syria Civil Defence and the protection of civilians in Syria\\". In 2018, the UK agreed to give asylum to some of the 500 White Helmets members and relatives who had been evacuated to Jordan, following lobbying by Le Mesurier. The UK government justified the decision by noting that \\"The White Helmets have saved over 115,000 lives during the Syrian conflict\\". =Russian and Syrian disinformation campaign= The Times reported that Le Mesurier was \\"the subject of an intense black propaganda campaign for years by pro-Assad activists and Russian diplomats\\". The New York Times reported that the group and Le Mesurier were the target of \\"unfounded conspiracy theories\\". It was alleged that Le Mesurier's British Army background meant that he was effectively operating as a British state agent. Janine di Giovanni has written the claim he was a spy lacks any evidence. The accusations, from those who are opposed to any Western involvement in Syria and are backers of the Assad regime, include bloggers connected to the English-language Russian media who claim the White Helmets and Le Mesurier were intending to push for regime change in Syria. Ben Nimmo, of the social media analysis company Graphika, said such claims began around 2015 with the involvement of Syrian and Russian forces in the War, and increased after their military began the Siege of Aleppo in late 2016 with their targeting of hospitals, a potential war crime, which the White Helmets witnessed and were by now able to provide video evidence. A week before Le Mesurier died, he was accused on Twitter by Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs official Maria Zakharova of being a former MI6 agent with \\"connections to terrorist groups\\", including al-Qaeda. The UK Permanent Representative to the UN, Karen Pierce described Le Mesurier as a \\"true hero\\". She denied the charges, saying that they were \\"categorically untrue. He was a British soldier.\\" \\"If you make the decision to risk your life, to save other people, it goes against radicalization\\", Le Mesurier told di Giovanni in an article for Newsweek in 2016. \\"They‚Äôve emerged as the representative of the average, good Syrian.\\" =Fraud allegation= Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant reported that three days before his death, Le Mesurier had reported a fraud at the Mayday Rescue Foundation to its donor countries, offering to resign from the foundation. This followed a Dutch accountant's visit to the Mayday office in Istanbul, which uncovered false receipts after an employee admitted she and a colleague had written the wrongly dated receipts on the instructions of Le Mesurier. A forensic inquiry of Mayday‚Äôs accounts by Grant Thornton subsequently took place instigated by donor countries, as most of the financial records were missing; a summary report of which de Volkskrant's journalists had seen. Le Mesurier had borrowed a large amount from the foundation to pay for his wedding in 2018, and cash intended for other purposes had been used to pay bonuses to senior staff including himself and his wife. The new administrator called salaries of senior staff \\"excessive\\", in some cases ‚Ç¨26,000 per month, although these had been consented to by donor countries. The original matter reported by Le Mesurier, a payment of $50,000 to himself, was found to be the result of a \\"misunderstanding\\" and not fraud. Personal life Le Mesurier was married three times; the first two marriages (to Aurelie Marle and Sarah Tosh) ended in divorce. He had two daughters with his second wife. In 2018, he married Emma Winberg, who is a director of Mayday Rescue and formerly a Foreign and Commonwealth Office diplomat.  Death  On 11 November 2019, Le Mesurier was found dead in the street at 4:30 in the morning (1:30 GMT) in the Kemanke≈ü Kara Mustafa Pa≈üa neighbourhood of Beyoƒülu, Istanbul, as a result of what appears to have been a fall from his balcony. Le Mesurier was found with fractures to his head and legs. Le Mesurier's wife said they had only a short while earlier gone to bed at 4 a.m., taking sleeping tablets. Later The Times reported that the Turkish police were treating the death as suicide, based on information from Le Mesurier's wife and his recent medical history, and that no forensic, autopsy or CCTV evidence indicated otherwise. On 14 November 2019, Le Mesurier's body was repatriated to London, while the Turkish investigation continued. At the time of his death, it was reported that the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, had the belief that Le Mesurier was murdered by Western intelligence services. A month later, the Turkish authorities confirmed the injuries he sustained were consistent with a fall from the balcony, according to the post mortem, \\"general body trauma linked to a fall from height\\". No DNA from other individuals was found. A toxicology report, according to a private Turkish broadcaster NTV, found signs of sleeping pills in Le Mesurier's body matching the statement from his widow. On 2 March 2020 Turkish prosecutors closed their investigation, with the death ruled as a suicide. His widow, Emma Winberg, was released from her restriction on leaving Turkey.

Terminology Ch√∫ (\\"kitchen; to cook; a cook\\") can be written with three Chinese characters Âªö, „ïë, and Âé®. The common traditional Chinese character Âªö combines the \\"house radical\\" Âπø with a phonetic indicator sh√π Â∞å (joining zh√π Â£¥ \\"drum\\" and c√πn ÂØ∏ \\"hand\\"); and the variant traditional character „ïë has \\"cliff radical\\" ÂéÇ instead of Âπø. The simplified Chinese character Âé® omits the Â£´ element in Â£¥, leading to a \\"graphic folk etymology\\" of \\"A ÂéÇ 'room' for cooking Ë±Ü 'beans' with your ÂØ∏ 'hands'.\\" (Bishop 2016). The Chinese logograph Âªö was anciently used as a loan character for ch√∫ Ê´• (with the \\"wood radical\\" Êú®, \\"cabinet\\") or ch√∫ ÂπÆ (\\"cloth radical\\" Â∑æ, \\"a screen used for a temporary kitchen\\"). The Modern Standard Chinese lexicon uses chu in many compound words, for instance, ch√∫f√°ng (ÂªöÊàø with Êàø \\"room\\", \\"kitchen\\"), ch√∫shƒ´ (ÂªöÂ∏´ with Â∏´ \\"master\\", \\"cook; chef\\"), ch√∫dƒÅo (ÂªöÂàÄ with ÂàÄ \\"knife\\", \\"kitchen knife\\"), and p√°och√∫ (Â∫ñÂªö with Â∫ñ \\"kitchen\\", meaning \\"kitchen\\"). In Daoist specialized vocabulary, chu names a Kitchen-feast communal meal, and sometimes has a technical meaning of \\"magic\\", \\"used to designate the magical recipes through which one becomes invisible\\" (Maspero 1981: 290). The extensive semantic field of chu can be summarized in some key Daoist expressions: ritual banquets, communion with divinities, granaries (zang Ëóè, a word that also denotes the viscera), visualization of the Five Viscera (wuzang ‰∫îËáü, written with the \\"flesh radical\\" ‚∫º), and abstention from cereals (bigu), and other food proscriptions (Mollier 2008a: 279). According to Daoist classics, when bigu \\"grain avoidance\\" techniques were successful, xingchu (Ë°åÂªö, Mobile Kitchens or tianchu (Â§©Âªö, Celestial Kitchens) were brought in gold and jade vessels by the yun√º (ÁéâÂ•≥, Jade Women) and jintong (ÈáëÂÉÆ, Golden Boys), associated with the legendary Jade Emperor (Despeux 2008: 233-234). Chinese Buddhist terminology applies chu (Âªö, cf. Ê´• \\"cabinet\\") \\"kitchen; kitchen cupboard\\" to denote the \\"cabinet for an image or relic of the Buddhas\\", translating Sanskrit bhakta- ≈õƒÅlƒÅ \\"food-hall\\" or mah√¢nasa \\"kitchen\\" (Digital Dictionary of Buddhism). In Chinese astronomy, TiƒÅnch√∫ (Â§©Âªö, Celestial Kitchen) is the name of an asterism in the constellation Draco, located next to TiƒÅnb√†ng (Â§©Ê£ì, Celestial Flail), and N√®ich√∫ (ÂÖßÂªö, Inner Kitchen). Translations There is no standard English translation for either Daoist chu (Âªö, Kitchen) or xingchu (Ë°åÂªö, Mobile Kitchen). The former is rendered as: *\\"kitchen festival\\", \\"kitchen feast\\" (Stein 1979) *\\"Kitchens\\" (Maspero 1981) *\\"kitchen banquets\\" (Verellen 2004) *\\"cuisines\\" (Campany 2005, Kleeman 2008, Mollier 2008a) *\\"Kitchens\\" (Mollier 2009) *\\"cuisines\\" (Kroll 2017) These Anglophone scholars render Chinese chu as either English kitchen (\\"a room for preparing food\\"), optionally clarified with K-, -festival or -feast, or cusine (\\"a characteristic style of cooking, often associated with a place of origin\\"). The latter follows Francophone sinologists, for instance Maspero (1971) and Mollier (1999), who accurately translated Chinese chu as French cuisine (\\"kitchen; cooking\\") and xingchu as cusine de voyage (\\"travel kitchen\\"). Although English kitchen and French cuisine are doublets deriving from Latin cocƒ´na (\\"cooking; kitchen\\"), they are false friends with significant semantic differences between English kitchen and cuisine. Chinese usually translates English kitchen as ch√∫f√°ng (ÂªöÊàø, \\"kitchen\\") and cuisine as pƒìngr√®n (ÁÉπÈ£™, \\"art of cooking\\"). Traveling canteen presented by Nicholas I of Russia to William Cavendish in 1826 The term xingchu (Ë°åÂªö) has been translated as *\\"Traveling Canteen\\" (Ware 1966) *\\"mobile kitchen\\" (Sivin 1968) *\\"perform the Kitchen\\" (Maspero 1981) *\\"travelling kitchen-feast\\" (Penny 2000) *\\"traveling canteen' (Campany 2002) *\\"traveling kitchen\\" (Campany 2005) *\\"movable cuisines\\" (Despeux 2008, Mollier 2008a) *\\"Mobile Kitchens\\" (Mollier 2009) Joseph Needham calls Ware's \\"Traveling Canteen\\" a \\"bizarre translation\\" (1976: 29). While Maspero uniquely interprets the xing (Ë°å) in xingchu as a verb (\\"to perform\\"), the other scholars read it as a modifier (\\"to go; to move\\") translated as traveling, mobile, or movable (cf. movable feast). The chu noun in xingchu is translated as English kitchen, cuisine, or canteen. However, the latter ambiguous word has several meanings besides canteen (\\"a cafeteria or snack bar provided by an organization\\"), canteen (\\"a small water bottle\\"), and British English canteen (\\"a case or box containing a cutlery set\\"). To further complicate translating xingchu, travelling canteen was the 18th-century equivalent of a picnic basket. In modern terms, the xingchu is comparable with a mobile kitchen (Sivin's translation), military field kitchen, food truck, or food cart. Chu Kitchen feast The chu (Âªö, Kitchen), also known as fushi (Á¶èÈ£ü, \\"good luck meal\\"), was a religious banquet that usually involved preliminary fasting and purification before consuming a meal of vegetarian food and Chinese wine. The banquet was hosted by families on the occasion of births and deaths, prepared for a ritually-fixed number of parishioners, and accompanied by specific ritual gifts to the Daoist priest. Although the Kitchen Feast became a regular element of organized Daoist religious traditions, scholars do not know the date when it was introduced into the liturgy. One early textual record is the c. 499 Zhen'gao saying that Xu Mi (Ë®±Ë∞ß, 303-376) offered a Kitchen meal to five persons (Stein 1979: 57). These communal chu Kitchen banquets have a pre- Daoist antecedent in popular Chinese folk religion: the term chu was anciently used for the ceremonial meals organized by communities to honor the she (Á§æ, God of the Soil). Although orthodox Daoists criticized, and sometimes banned, these chuhui (ÂªöÊúÉ, \\"cuisine congregations\\") for making immoral animal sacrifices, they nevertheless perpetuated the custom by adapting and codifying it (Mollier 2008a: 279). Chu kitchen-feasts have many features in common with another Daoist ritual meal, the zhƒÅi (ÈΩã, \\"fast; purification; retreat\\"), and the two are frequently treated as having the same functions. The 7th-century Daoist Zhaijielu (ÈΩãÊàíÈåÑ, Records of Fasting) suggested that zhai were anciently called shehui (Á§æÊúÉ, \\"festival gatherings of the soil god\\"‚Äînow the modern Chinese word for \\"society\\"), which was later changed into zhaihui (ÈΩãÊúÉ) (Stein 1979: 75). The Way of the Celestial Masters religion, founded by Zhang Daoling in 142 CE, celebrated chu kitchen festivals at New Year and the annual sanhui (‰∏âÊúÉ, Three Assemblies), which were major Daoist festivals held in the first, seventh, and tenth lunar months, when believers assembled at their local parish to report any births, deaths, or marriages, so that the population registers could be updated. Parishioners who had reason to celebrate on these occasions would host a chu feast for other members of the community in proportion to the significance of their auspicious event and their means. Accounts of these banquets \\"emphasize both the sharing of food and the affirmation of the unique, religious merit-based social order of the Daoist community\\" (Kleeman 2008: 839-840). The chu sacrament had three levels of banquets and ritual gifts, depending upon what the family was celebrating. For the birth of a boy, the shangchu (‰∏äÂªö, Superior Ceremony of the Kitchen) was a banquet offered to the priest and ten members of the parish, with gifts to the priest of a hundred sheets of paper, a pair of ink brushes, an inkstick, and an ink scraper. For the birth of a girl, it was the less expensive zhongchu (‰∏≠Âªö, Middle Ceremony of the Kitchen) with a banquet for five parishioners, and the gifts, which the parents had to provide within one month following the birth, were a mat, a wastebasket, and a broom. For the death of a family member, the xiachu (‰∏ãÂªö, Inferior Ceremony of the Kitchen), also called jiechu (Ëß£Âªö, Kitchen of Deliverance), is not described in Daoist texts, and we only know that the rival Buddhist polemicists claimed it was a \\"great orgy\\" (Maspero 1981: 290). The anti-Daoist Erjiaolun (‰∫åÊïôË´ñ, Essay on Two Religions) by the Buddhist monk Dao'an (312‚Äì385) said chu kitchen-feasts were intended to bring about jiƒõch√∫ (Ëß£Èô§, \\"liberation and elimination\\") from pollution and sins, which were connected with the soil god and tombs (Stein 1979: 71). The parallel passage in the 6th-century Bianhuolun (ËæØÊÉëË´ñ, Essay on Debating Doubts) uses the homophonous graphic variant of jiƒõch√∫ (Ëß£Âªö, \\"liberation kitchen\\"), thus connecting both ch√∫ \\"kitchen\\" and ch√∫ \\"liberation\\" to non-Daoist gods of the soil (Stein 1979: 74). Daoist sources record that the people invited to a chu Kitchen feast would first observe a period of purification that included fasting and abstention from sex. Kitchen rituals lasted for one, three, or seven days. Participants consumed exclusively vegetarian food and moderate amounts of wine, which was considered as a mandatory element of the banquet (Mollier 2008a: 279). For the Superior Kitchens five sheng of wine (about a liter) per person was planned, for the Middle Kitchens, four sheng, and for the Inferior Kitchen three. The participants \\"must have departed a bit happy, but not drunk.\\" (Maspero 1981: 290). The leftovers were given to other parishioners who could thereby share in the ritual. Besides annual festivals on fixed dates like the Three Assemblies, chu Kitchen ceremonies were also performed in special circumstances, particularly when there was disease, sin, or death pollution. They were believed to have exorcistic and salvific powers and to confer good luck or merit upon the adepts (Mollier 2008a: 279). Kitchen ceremonies often involved Daoist ritual jiao (ÈÜÆ, \\"offerings\\") of cakes and pieces of fabric in order to obtain particular favors, such as petitions for recovery from illnesses, prayers for rain in time of drought, and thanksgivings for favors received. An altar was laid out in the open air, and the priest recited prayers (Maspero 1981: 34-35). Ge Hong's c. 318 Baopuzi (see below) mentions profligately expensive chu Kitchen Feasts in contrasting heterodox yaodao (Â¶ñÈÅì, \\"demonic cults\\"), which involved sacrificing animals to gods who enjoyed their blood, with the undefined term Lijia dao (ÊùéÂÆ∂ÈÅì, \\"religion of the adepts of Li\\") (Stein 1979: 56). The context praises the contemporary charlatan healer Li Kuan (ÊùéÂØ¨) for not following the ancient tradition of animal sacrifice, while blaming him for extravagance. > The more than a hundred ways for dealing with demons [Ë´∏Â¶ñÈÅìÁôæÈ§òÁ®Æ] all call for > slaying living creatures so that their blood may be drunk. Only the doctrine > of the Lis [ÊùéÂÆ∂ÈÅì] is slightly different. Yet, though it does no butchering, > whenever its \\"good-luck food\\" is served [ÊØè‰æõÁ¶èÈ£ü], it includes varieties of > mixtures without limit. In planning the meal, one strives for sumptuousness, > and the rarest things must be purchased. Several dozen may work in the > kitchen [ÊàñÊï∏ÂçÅ‰∫∫Âªö], and costs for food can run high indeed. In turn, these are > not completely disinterested affairs, and they might well be classed with > things to be forbidden. (tr. Ware 1966: 158) Xingchu Mobile Kitchen traditions In Daoist hagiographies and stories, the esoteric ability to summon a xingchu (Ë°åÂªö, Mobile Kitchen) was a standard trope for the powers of a xian transcendent. The xingchu, which Campany called a \\"curious business\\" (2002: 29), was a sumptuous banquet of rare delicacies, exotic foods, and wines that could be instantly served up by spirits anywhere on command. The tradition of xingchu \\"meditational cuisines\\" or \\"contemplative cuisines\\" seems to have developed in a parallel and complementary manner to the chu \\"communal cuisine liturgy\\" (Mollier 2008a: 280). Xian transcendents were portrayed as eschewing what counted in China as ordinary foods, especially grains (see bigu), and instead eating superior, longevity-inducing substitutes such as sesame seeds and lingzhi mushrooms, typically found in distant and legendary places removed from the heartland of agriculture-based Chinese civilization. Transcendents were frequently depicted as winged beings able to fly long distances rapidly and summoning a xingchu banquet at will eliminated the need to travel across the world and heavens in order to obtain rare foodstuffs of immortality (Campany 2005: 46-47). The Jin Dynasty Daoist scholar Ge Hong compiled the two primary sources of information about xingchu Mobile Kitchens, the Baopuzi and Shenxian zhuan. Ge portrayed adepts seeking xian-hood as avoiding ordinary food such as grains, instead eating \\"rare, exotic foodstuffs from the far reaches of the cosmos\\", marvelous products conveying the \\"numinous power\\" suggested by their peculiarity. \\"The ability to command at will a spirit-hosted serving of exotic food and drink in elegant vessels may seem trivial, but when one recalls that many Daoist scriptures prohibit the feasting on sacrificial meats and liquors enjoyed by the aristocracy, and that many adepts did their work on mountains and were isolated from agricultural communities and markets, the practice assumes a more serious aspect.\\" (Campany 2002: 221) =Baopuzi= The c. 318 CE \\"Inner Chapters\\" of the Baopuzi (Master Who Embraces Simplicity) have nine occurrences of the word xingchu (Ë°åÂªö, Mobile Kitchen). Seven of them are in contexts of alchemical medicines and elixirs, most of which have poisonous toxic heavy metal ingredients. The Baopuzi uses two related verbs for beckoning a Mobile Kitchen: zh√¨ (Ëá≥, \\"arrive at; reach; come\\") and zh√¨ (Ëá¥, \\"cause to arrive at; get to; come to\\"). The other two xingchu usages are in proper names of a Daoist amulet and book, the Xingchu fu (Ë°åÂªöÁ¨¶, Amulet of the Traveling Kitchen), and the Xingchu jing (Ë°åÂªöÁ∂ì, Scripture of the Traveling Kitchen). The Baopuzi also lists another book titled Riyue chushi jing (Êó•ÊúàÂªöÈ£üÁ∂ì, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals of the Sun and the Moon) (19, Ware 1966: 384, 380, 381). Three of the seven Baopuzi elixirs are said to have dual purpose usages, long-term consumption is said to grant xian transcendence, including the ability to summon xingchu, and short-term consumption provides a panacea‚Äîspecifically for eliminating the Three Corpses or Three Worms, demons that live within the human body and hasten their host's death, and the Nine Worms or Nine Vermin, broadly meaning internal worms and parasites. First, the Xian Menzi dan (Áæ°ÈñÄÂ≠ê‰∏π, Master Xian Men's Elixir) is prepared from wine and cinnabar. \\"After it has been taken for one day the Three Worms and all illnesses are immediately purged from the patient. If taken for three years, it will confer geniehood and one is sure to be served by two fairies, who can be employed to summon the Traveling Canteen [ÂèØÂΩπ‰ΩøËá¥Ë°åÂªö].\\" (4, tr. Ware 1966: 84; cf. Campany 2002: 290). Second, a list of methods for eating and drinking realgar says, \\"In each case it confers Fullness of Life; all illnesses are banished; the Three Corpses drop from the body; scars disappear; gray hair tums black; and lost teeth are regenerated. After a thousand days, fairies [translating yunu ÁéâÂ•≥ Jade Maiden] will come to serve you and you can use them to summon the Traveling Canteen [‰ª•Ëá¥Ë°åÂªö].\\" (11, tr. Ware 1966: 188). Third, consuming pure, unadulterated lacquer will put a man in communication with the gods and let him Enjoy Fullness of Life. When eaten with pieces of crab in mica or jade water, \\"The Nine Insects will then drop from you, and the bad blood will leave you through nose-bleeds. After a year, the six-chia gods and the Traveling Canteen will come to you [‰∏ÄÂπ¥ÂÖ≠Áî≤Ë°åÂªöËá≥‰πü].\\" (11, tr. Ware 1966: 190). This liujia (ÂÖ≠Áî≤, Six Jia Gods) and the liuyin (ÂÖ≠Èô∞, Six Yin) below refer to astrological Dunjia divination. An alternate translation is \\"the six jia and the traveling canteen will arrive\\" (Campany 2002: 75), The remaining four Baopuzi formulas are said to create stronger and more versatile elixirs. Fourth, the Jiuguang dan (‰πùÂÖâ‰∏π, Ninefold Radiance Elixir) is made by processing certain unspecified ingredients with the wushi (‰∫îÁü≥, Five Minerals, see Cold- Food Powder), i.e., cinnabar, realgar, purified potassium alum, laminar malachite, and magnetite (Needham et al. 1976: 86). Each mineral is put through five alchemical cycles and assumes five hues, so that altogether twenty-five hues result, each with specific powers, for example, the blue elixir will revive a recently deceased person. \\"If you wish to summon the Traveling Canteen [Ê¨≤Ëá¥Ë°åÂªö], smear your left hand with a solution of black elixir; whatever you ask for will be at your beck and call, and everything you mention will arrive without effort. You will be able to summon any thing or any creature in the world.\\" (tr. Ware 1966: 82-83, noting \\"fragrant foods served in plates of gold and cups of jade\\"). Fifth, the Baopuzi quotes from Shennong sijing (Á•ûËæ≤ÂõõÁ∂ì, Shennong's Four Classics), \\"Medicines of the highest type put the human body at ease and protract life so that people ascend and become gods in heaven, soar up and down in the air, and have all the spirits at their service. Their bodies grow feathers and wings, and the Traveling Canteen comes whenever they wish [Ë°åÂªöÁ´ãËá≥].\\" (11, tr. Ware 1966: 177). Sixth, the method of Wu Chengzi (ÂãôÊàêÂ≠ê) compounds alchemical gold from realgar, yellow sand, and mercury, and then forms it into small pills. Coating the pills with different substances will produce magical effects, for instance, if one is smeared with ram's blood and thrown into a stream, \\"the fish and the dragons will come out immediately, and it will be easy to catch them.\\" And, \\"If it is coated with hare's blood and placed in a spot belonging to the Six Yin, the Traveling Canteen and the fairies will appear immediately and place themselves at your disposal [Ë°åÂªöÁéâÂ•≥Á´ãËá≥], to a total of sixty or seventy individuals.\\" (16, tr. Ware 1966: 276). Seventh, Liu Gen (ÂäâÊ†π, or Liu Jun'an ÂäâÂêõÂÆâ), who Ware wrongly identifies as the Daoist prince and author Liu An (ÂäâÂÆâ, Campany 2002: 248), learned the art of metamorphosis from an alchemical text attributed to the Mohist founder Mozi, the Mozi wuxing ji (Â¢®Â≠ê‰∫îË°åË®ò, Master Mo's Records of the Five Phases), and successfully used its medicines and amulets, \\"By grasping a pole he becomes a tree. He plants something, and it immediately produces edible melons or fruit. He draws a line on the ground, and it becomes a river; he piles up dirt and it becomes a hill. He sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive [ÂùêËá¥Ë°åÂªö].\\" (19, tr. Ware 1966: 316). =Shenxian zhuan= The c. 318 Shenxian zhuan (Hagiographies of Divine Transcendents) uses xingchu (Ë°åÂªö, Mobile Kitchen) six times. The hagiography of Wang Yuan gives a detailed description of summoning a xingchu. Other adepts who are also said to have this ability include Li Gen, Liu Jing, Zuo Ci, Liu Zheng, and Taixuan n√º (Campany 2002: 222). Portrait of the Immortal Magu (National Palace Museum, Taipei) First, the hagiography of Wang Yuan (ÁéãÈÅ†) and Magu (Cannabis Maiden) says Wang was a Confucianist scholar who quit his official post during the reign (146-168 CE) of Emperor Huan of Han and went into the mountains to study Daoist techniques. Wang achieved xian transcendence through shijie \\"liberation by means of a simulated corpse\\", described with the traditional cicada metaphor, his \\"body disappeared; yet the cap and garments were completely undisturbed, like a cicada shell.\\" During his travels, Wang met the peasant Cai Jing (Ëî°Á∂ì), whose physiognomy indicated he was destined to become a transcendent, so Wang took him on as a disciple, taught him the basic techniques, and left. Soon afterwards Cai also used alchemical shijie liberation, his body became extremely hot, and his flesh and bones melted away for three days. \\"Suddenly he had vanished. When his family looked inside the blanket, only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell.\\" (tr. Campany 2002: 260). After Cai had been gone for \\"over a decade\\", he unexpectedly returned home, looking like a young man, announced to his family that Lord Wang would visit on the \\"seventh day of the seventh month\\" (later associated with the Cowherd and Weaver Girl lovers' festival), and ordered them to \\"prepare great quantities of food and drink to offer to his attendants.\\" When Wang Yuan and his heavenly entourage arrived on the auspicious \\"double-seven\\" day, he invited his old friend Magu to join their celebration because it had been over five hundred years since she had been \\"in the human realm.\\" When the Cannabis Maiden and her attendants arrived at Cai's household, > She appeared to be a handsome woman of eighteen or nineteen; her hair was > done up, and several loose strands hung down to her waist. Her gown had a > pattern of colors, but it was not woven; it shimmered, dazzling the eyes, > and was indescribable ‚Äì it was not of this world. She approached and bowed > to Wang, who bade her rise. When they were both seated, they called for the > travelling canteen [ÂùêÂÆöÂè¨ÈÄ≤Ë°åÂªö]. The servings were piled up on gold platters and > in jade cups without limit. There were rare delicacies, many of them made > from flowers and fruits, and their fragrance permeated the air inside [Cai's > home] and out. When the meat was sliced and served, [in flavor] it resembled > broiled mo and was announced as kirin meat. (tr. Campany 2002: 262) Compare Maspero's translation, \\"everyone steps forth to 'perform the Kitchen'\\" (1981: 291). Guo Pu's commentary to the Classic of Mountains and Seas described the m√≤ (Ë≤ò, giant panda) as \\"bear-like, black and white, and metal- eating\\" (tr. Harper 2013: 216); and the mystical qilin beast is sometimes identified as a Chinese unicorn (Penny 2008: 731). Wang Yuan then announced to the Cai family that he had brought some exceptional wine from the Tianchu (Â§©Âªö, Heavenly Kitchen) asterism. > I wish to present you all with a gift of fine liquor. This liquor has just > been produced by the celestial kitchens. Its flavor is quite strong, so it > is unfit for drinking by ordinary people; in fact, in some cases it has been > known to burn people's intestines. You should mix it with water, and you > should not regard this as inappropriate.\\" With that, he added a dou of water > to a sheng of liquor, stirred it, and presented it to the members of Cai > Jing's family. On drinking little more than a sheng of it each, they were > all intoxicated. After a little while, the liquor was all gone. (tr. Campany > 2002: 263) In traditional Chinese units of measurement , a d«íu ( Êñó) was approximately equivalent to 10 liters and a shƒìng Âçá) approximately 1 liter. Second, the Shenxian zhuan narrative of Li Gen (ÊùéÊ†π) says he studied under Wu Dawen (Âê≥Â§ßÊñá) and obtained a method for producing alchemical gold and silver. > Li Gen could transform himself [into other forms] and could enter water and > fire [without harm]. He could sit down and cause the traveling canteen to > arrive, and with it could serve twenty guests [ÂùêËá¥Ë°åÂªöËÉΩ‰æõ‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫∫]. All the dishes > were finely prepared, and all of them contained strange and marvelous foods > from the four directions, not things that were locally available. (tr. > Campany 2002: 219) Third, Liu Jing (Âäâ‰∫¨) was an official under Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180-157 BCE) who \\"abandoned the world and followed Lord Zhang ÂºµÂêõ of Handan to study the Way.\\" By using methods for subsisting on \\"efflorescence of vermilion\\" pills [Êú±Ëã±‰∏∏] and \\"cloud-mother [mica]\\" pills, Liu \\"lived to be one hundred thirty years old. To look at him, one would judge him to be a person in his thirties.\\" He could also foretell the auspiciousness of future events. (tr. Campany 2002: 249). The Shangqing (Supreme Purity) tradition Han Wu Di neizhuan (Êº¢Ê≠¶Â∏ùÂÜÖÂÇ≥, Esoteric Traditions of Han Emperor Wu), which was written between 370 and 500, has some later accretions that resemble Shenxian zhuan (Campany 2002: 76). The passage about Liu Jing says, > Later he served Ji Zixun [ËñäÂ≠êË®ì, i.e., Ji Liao ËñäÈÅº] as his teacher. Zixun > transmitted to him all the secret essentials of the Five Thearchs, Numinous > Flight (lingfei, ÈùàÈ£õ), the six jia spirits, the Twelve Matters (shier shi > ÂçÅ‰∫å‰∫ã), and the Perfected Forms of the Ten Continents of Divine Transcendents > (shenxian shizhou zhenxiang Á•û‰ªôÂçÅÊ¥≤ÁúüÂΩ¢). Liu Jing practiced them all according > to the instructions, and they were mightily efficacious. He could summon > ghosts and spirits, immediately cause wind and rain to arise, cause the > traveling canteen to arrive [ÂêçËá¥Ë°åÂªö], and appear and disappear at will. He > also knew the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of people's future affairs > and of particular days. (tr. Campany 2002: 449) Fourth, the transcendent Zuo Ci (Â∑¶ÊÖà) was a fangshi (\\"method master\\") famous for his abilities at divination, fenshen multilocation, and shapeshifting (Pregadio 2008: 1305), > Seeing that the fortunes of the Han house were about to decline, he sighed > and said, \\"As we move into this declining [astral] configuration, those who > hold eminent offices are in peril, and those of lofty talent will die. > Winning glory in this present age is not something to be coveted.\\" So he > studied arts of the Dao. He understood particularly well [how to summon] the > six jia spirits, how to dispatch ghosts and other spirits, and how to sit > down and call for the traveling canteen [ÂùêËá¥Ë°åÂªö]. (tr. Campany 2002: 279) Fifth, the Shenxian zhuan says that Liu Zheng (ÂäâÊîø) used the same alchemical text attributed to Mozi that the Baopuzi says was used by Liu Gen (ÂäâÊ†π, or Liu Jun'an ÂäâÂêõÂÆâ, see Campany 2002: 240-249). > Later he arranged [a copy of] Master Mo's Treatise on the Five Phases (Mozi > wuxing ji Â¢®Â≠ê‰∫îË°åË®ò) and, [based on it], ingested \\"efflorescence of vermilion\\" > pills. He lived for more than one hundred eighty years, and his complexion > was that of a youth. He could transform himself into other shapes and > conceal his form; multiply one person into a hundred or a hundred into a > thousand or a thousand into ten thousand; conceal a military force of three > brigades by forming them into a forest or into birds and beasts, so that > they could easily take their opponents' weapons without their knowledge. > Further, he was capable of planting fruits of all types and causing them > immediately to flower and ripen so as to be ready to eat. He could sit down > and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [ÁîüËá¥Ë°åÂªö], setting out a complete > meal for up to several hundred people. His mere whistling could create a > wind to set dust swirling and blow stones about. (tr. Campany 2002: 322) Transcendental whistling was an ancient Daoist yogic technique. Sixth, the brief hagiography of the female transcendent Taixuan n√º (Â§™ÁéÑÂ•≥, Woman of the Grand Mystery) says. > The Woman of the Grand Mystery was surnamed Zhuan È°ì and named He Âíå. While > still young, she was bereaved of her husband, so she practiced the Way. > Disciplining herself in the arts of the Jade Master, (Yuzi) she could sit > down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive [ÂùêËá¥Ë°åÂªö], and there was no sort > of transformation she could not accomplish. (tr. Campany 2002: 367). In addition, the Shenxian zhuan hagiography for Mao Ying (ËåÖÁõà) describes what sounds like a xingchu without using the name (Campany 2002: 328). After twenty years studying the Dao, Mao Ying returned home to his parents and announced that he had been commanded to enter heaven and become a transcendent. The people of his home village came to give him a going-away party, and Mao said, > \\"I am touched by your sincere willingness to send me off, and I deeply > appreciate your intention. But please come empty-handed; you need not make > any expenditure. I have a means whereby to provide a feast for us all.\\" On > the appointed day, the guests all arrived, and a great banquet was held. > Awnings of blue brocade were spread out, and layers of white felt were > spread out beneath them. Rare delicacies and strange fruits were piled up > and arrayed. Female entertainers provided music; the sounds of metal and > stone mingled together, and the din shook Heaven and Earth; it could be > heard from several li away. Of the more than one thousand guests present > that day, none failed to leave intoxicated and sated. (tr. Campany 2002: > 327) Mao Ying and his brothers Mao Gu (ËåÖÂõ∫) and Mao Zhong (ËåÖË°∑) are considered of the founders of the Shangqing School of Daoism. Shangqing Daoists took the stock literary phrase zuo zhi xingchu (ÂùêËá¥Ë°åÂªö)‚Äîused above in the Baopuzi for Liu Gen, \\"sits down and causes the Traveling Canteen to arrive\\" (tr. Ware), and in the Shenxian zhuan for Li Gen, Zuo Ci, and Taixuan n√º, \\"sit down and cause the traveling canteen to arrive\\" (tr. Campany)‚Äîand actualized it as a visualization technique for \\"making the movable cuisines come [while] sitting [in meditation]\\" (tr. Mollier). \\"This method, accessible only to the initiate who possessed the proper series of talismans (fu Á¨¶) and had mastered certain visualization techniques, conferred powers to become invisible, to cause thunder, and to call for rain.\\" This form of sitting meditation was so popular during the Tang period that Chinese Esoteric Buddhism also adopted it. (Mollier 2008a: 280) Wuchu Five Kitchens meditation Following upon the Celestial Masters liturgical Kitchen feasts and xian transcendents' Mobile Kitchens, the third stage of Daoist chu traditions was the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) w«îch√∫ (‰∫îÂªö, Five Kitchens) contemplation technique, which recast the concept of ritual banquets in terms of psychophysiological neidan Internal Alchemy (Verellen 2004: 351). In Chinese cosmological wuxing Five Phases correspondence theory, the wuchu Five Kitchens or wuzang (‰∫îËáü, Five Viscera / Orbs) system includes not only the physiological internal organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and spleen), but also the associated psychological range of mental and emotional states (Roth 1999: 41-42). The 735 Wuchu jing (‰∫îÂªöÁ∂ì, Scripture of the Five Kitchens), which poetically describes a visualization practice for circulating qi energies through the Five Viscera, was so popular that Tang Buddhists forged the esoteric SƒÅnch√∫ jƒ´ng (‰∏âÂªöÁ∂ì, Sutra of the Three Kitchens) based on the Daoist text (Mollier 2008b: 1051). There are two extant editions of Wuchu jing (translated by Kohn 2010: 198-206). First, the 763 Tang Daozang (Daoist Canon) edition titled Laozi shuo Wuchu jing zhu (ËÄÅÂ≠êË™™‰∫îÂªöÁ∂ì, Commentary to the Scripture of the Five Kitchens as Revealed by Laozi) contains a preface dated 735 and a commentary, both signed by Yin Yin (Â∞πÊÑî, d. 741). The reduplicatedly named Yin Yin was a prominent Daoist and Confucian scholar under Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712-756), and abbot of the Suming guan (ËÇÖÊòéËßÄ, Abbey of Reviving Light) temple in the capital Chang'an. The late Tang Celestial Master Zhao Xianfu (Ë∂ô‰ªôÁî´, fl. 732) also wrote a commentary (Verellen 2004: 351). Second, the 1019 Yunji Qiqian (Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel) anthology edition titled Wuchu jing qifa (‰∫îÂªöÁ∂ìÊ∞£Ê≥ï, Energetic Methods of the Scripture of the Five Kitchens), also includes Yin's commentary, with slight variations, such as noting the text was presented to the emperor in 736 (Verellen 2004: 351). The qi \\"energetic\\" methods of the text are recommended by Sima Chengzhen (Âè∏È¶¨ÊâøÁ¶é, 647‚Äì735) in his Fuqi jingyi lun (ÊúçÊ∞£Á≤æÁæ©Ë´ñ, Essay on the Essential Meaning of Breath Ingestion) text on physical self-cultivation (Mollier 2008b: 1051). Although the presence of Yin's preface might suggest a Tang date for the Wuchu jing, the origins of this text may be much earlier. Ge Hong's c. 318 Baopuzi mentions a Xingchu jing (Ë°åÂªöÁ∂ì, Scripture of the Movable Kitchens) and a Riyue chushi jing (Êó•ÊúàÂªöÈ£üÁ∂ì, Scripture of the Kitchen Meals for the Sun and the Moon), which could be the ancestors of the received texts (Mollier 2008b: 1051). The c. 905 Daojiao lingyan ji (ÈÅìÊïôÈùàÈ©óË®ò, Record of Daoist Miracles, written by the Daoist priest, author, and court official Du Guangting, says a Buddhist monk fraudulently transformed the Wuchu jing Scripture of the Five Kitchens into the Sanchu jing (‰∏âÂªöÁ∂ì, Sutra of the Three Kitchens). Du records that the Chinese Buddhist canon of the Tang period contained a text titled Fo shuo san tingchu jing (‰ΩõË™™‰∏âÂÅúÂªöÁ∂ì, Sutra of the Three Interrupted Kitchens, Preached by the Buddha) (Verellen I992: 248-249). According to Du Guangting, the monk Xingduan (Ë°åÁ´Ø), who had \\"a presumptuous and fraudulent disposition\\", saw that the widely-circulated Daoist Wuchu jing consisted of five stanzas (j√¨ ÂÅà, \\"gatha; poetic verse; versified utterance\\") of incantations (zh√≤u Âíí, \\"mantra; religious incantation; mystical invocation\\"), rearranged them, and expanded the title into Fo shuo san tingchu jing (‰ΩõË™™‰∏âÂÅúÂªöÁ∂ì). \\"The five incantations he turned into 'five sutras spoken by Tathagata,' and at the end he added a hymn. The additional phrases amounted to no less than a page.\\" Verellen suggests that the scripture, with its \\"Buddho-Daoist content and quasi-magical use\\", originated as a late Six Dynasties (220-589) Tantric zhoujing (ÂííÁ∂ì, \\"incantations scripture\\", cf. the Divine Incantations Scripture). (1992: 250-51). Du Guangting gives a lengthy narrative about the Daoist miracle involving supernatural retribution for Xingduan's forgery. One day after the monk had already given several copies of the altered scripture to others, a \\"divine being eight or nine feet tall\\" and holding a sword reprimands him for the counterfeiting and brandishes his sword to strike the monk. As Xingduan \\"wards off the blow with his hand, several fingers are lopped off\\", he begs for mercy, and the Daoist deity agrees to spare his life if he retrieves and destroys all the fakes. Xingduan and his companions search everywhere for the texts, but can only find half of them, the remainder having already been carried abroad by Buddhist monks. Xingduan prepares ten fresh copies of the original scripture, offers incense, repents, and burns the altered copies. Then the divine being reappears and announces: \\"Having vilified the sage's text, restitution won't save you‚Äîyou do not deserve to escape death\\", the monk falls prostrate and dies on the spot (Verellen 1992: 251). In the present day, early copies of this apocryphal Buddhist sutra have been preserved. Four textual versions were discovered in the Chinese Dunhuang manuscripts, two versions, dated 1099 and 1270, are kept in the Japanese Mount K≈çya manuscripts. In addition, the modern Japanese Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka canon includes the text (Mollier 2009: 26-28). The highly abstract Wuchu jing mystical poem comprises five stanzas consisting of four five-character lines each. The Yunqi qiqian edition shows that the five stanzas were associated with the Five Directions of space: east (lines 1-4), south (lines 5-8), north (lines 9-12), west (lines 13-16), and center (lines 17-20) (Verellen 2004: 351). For example, the first four lines (tr. Kohn 2010: 200-201): The content of the Wuchu jing guides adepts toward a detached mental state of non-thinking and equanimity. The Five Kitchens refer to neidan Internal Alchemy \\"qi-processing on a subtle-body level\\", and signify the energetic, transformative power of the Five Viscera (Kohn 2010: 71). Yin Yin's introduction says, > As long as you dwell in the qi of universal oneness [‰∏ÄÊ∞£] and in the harmony > of cosmic peace [Ê≥∞Âíå], the five organs [‰∫îËáü] are abundant and full and the > five spirits [‰∫îÁ•û] are still and upright. \\"When the five organs are abundant, > all sensory experiences are satisfied; when the five spirits are still, all > cravings and desires are eliminated. This scripture expounds on how the five > organs taking in qi is like someone looking for food in a kitchen. Thus, its > title: \\"Scripture of the Five Kitchens.\\" (tr. Kohn 2010: 200) Commenting on Yin's interpretation, Du Guangting claims more explicitly that practicing this scripture will enable an adept to stop eating. (Verellen 2004: 352) Techniques in the Wuchu jing (‰∫îÂªöÁ∂ì, Scripture of the Five Kitchens) mainly involve visualizing the Five Viscera of the body and chanting incantations. These methods supposedly allow the adept to obtain satisfaction and harmony, and, after some years of training, even transcendence (Mollier 2008a: 279-280). Despite this concern with the human body, the text strongly emphasizes mental restructuring over physical practices, saying that \\"accumulating cultivation will not get you to detachment\\" and that methods of ingestion are ultimately useless. However, reciting the scripture is beneficial, especially if combined with mental and ethical practices, so that \\"you will easily get the true essentials of cultivating the body-self and protecting life.\\" More specifically, chanting the text one hundred times and practicing the harmonization of the five qi allows adepts to abstain from grain and eliminate hunger (Mollier 1999: 62-63).

The museum displays approximately half of Claudel's existing artwork. The Claudel museum was opened in 2017 in her teenage home town of Nogent-sur-Seine, 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of Paris. Plans were announced in 2003 to turn the Claudel family home at Nogent-sur-Seine into a museum, and the museum negotiated to buy Claudel's works from the Claudel family. These include 70 pieces by Claudel, including a bust of her teacher, Auguste Rodin. Rodin and Claudel were associates and lovers, and eventually rivals. Many of Claudel's sculptures can also be seen at the Mus√©e Rodin in Paris, which has a room dedicated to her work and her association with the acclaimed sculptor.  History  A municipal museum was created in the town of Nogent-sur-Seine in 1902. It held a collection of works by the sculptors Alfred Boucher and Paul Dubois, both of whom had a connection to the community. The early museum was decimated by pillagers around 1940, with remaining works being placed in storage in 1950. The Mus√©e Dubois-Boucher reopened in 1975. In 2008, the museum purchased 43 works by Claudel from the artist‚Äôs great niece, Reine Marie Paris. Architect Adelfo Scaranello designed an expansion and renovation of an existing structure, where Claudel had once lived during her teenage years, into a new facility to include 15 galleries. Reopened in 2017 as the Mus√©e Camille Claudel, it now houses the largest collection of her works in the world. The museum also displays works by her mentors and contemporaries.

It is an inhibitor of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2 (ROCK2; ROCK-II). Belumosudil binds to and inhibits the serine/threonine kinase activity of ROCK2. This inhibits ROCK2-mediated signaling pathways which play major roles in pro- and anti-inflammatory immune cell responses. A genomic study in human primary cells demonstrated that the drug also has effects on oxidative phosphorylation, WNT signaling, angiogenesis, and KRAS signaling. Originally developed by Surface Logix, Inc, Belumosudil was later acquired by Kadmon Corporation. As of July 2020 the drug was in completed or ongoing Phase II clinical studies for cGvHD, IPF and psoriasis. cGvHD is a complication that can follow stem cell or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation where the transplanted cells (graft) attack healthy cells (host). This causes inflammation and fibrosis in multiple tissues. Two cytokines controlled by the ROCK2 signaling pathway, IL-17 and IL-21, have a major role in the cGvHD response. In a 2016 report using both mouse models and a limited human clinical trial ROCK2 inhibition with belumosudil targeted both the immunologic and fibrotic components of cGvHD and reversed the symptoms of the disease. In October 2017 KD025 was granted orphan drug status in the United States for treatment of patients with cGvHD. IPF is a progressive fibrotic disease where the lining of the lungs become thickened and scarred. Increased ROCK activity has been found in the lungs of humans and animals with IPF. Treatment with belumosudil reduced lung fibrosis in a bleomycin mouse model study. Belumosudil may have a therapeutic benefit in IPF by targeting the fibrotic processes mediated by the ROCK signaling pathway. Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition where patients experiences eruptions and remissions of thickened, erythematous, and scaly patches of skin. Down-regulation of pro- inflammatory responses was observed with KD025 treatment in Phase 2 clinical studies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

The church was built in 1939‚Äì40 and was designed in the Romanesque Revival architectural style with modernist design principles.  History  The construction of the church began with the arrival of the Reverend Ladislaus Sliwinski on March 18, 1925. He inherited a parish over $100,000 in debt, and a church and school that had been in poor condition since the parish was organized in 1902. Revered Sliwinski cleared the debt in three years but quickly realized that the current facilities were inadequate for the size of the parish. The parish decided to develop plans to construct a new church. The parishioners split into two groups, one who wanted to build the new church on a lot across from the current church to save cost, and the other wanted to locate the church above Butler Street. They believed that above Butler Street was more desirable as it was in a residential area, it was closer to the parishioner‚Äôs homes, and areas below Butler Street were being zoned as an industrial area. For these reasons the church decided on a location above Butler Street.Borkowski, Joseph. Holy Family Church 50 Years Ago.

They purchased several properties between 1929 and 1930, despite the turmoil of the Great Depression retained Antoni A. Pyzdrowski as chief architect and engineer. Bishop Boyle granted the parish permission to build their new church in 1938, despite the parish incurring a serious debt. The predominantly Polish parish began ground breaking for the new church on October 8, 1939, with the Consulate of the Republic of Poland addressing the gathering. The cornerstone was laid and Revered Hugh C. Boyle blessed the church in January 1940, and the ceremonies were concluded with a singing of ‚ÄúBoze Cos Polski‚Äù (God Bless Poland). Upon completion in 1940 the Holy Family Church was the largest religious structure in Lawrenceville‚Äôs ninth ward, and due to the fact that the congregation consisted largely of Polish immigrants and their descendants, it was dubbed ‚Äúthe Polish Cathedral‚Äù. By 1948 the debt on the new church was cleared, and the inside was painted by Scatena Studio. With the changes established during Vatican II, the inside of the church was changed with the altars removed, the sanctuary area expanded, and pews arranged in a semi- circular fashion. More artwork was added from 1973-1985 and a mural depicting three historical epics was added.‚ÄúMural Memorializing Polish Christianity Dedicated.‚Äù Pittsburgh Catholic. November 29, 1985. In 1993 Bishop Donald Wuerl reorganized and consolidated the parishes in Pittsburgh. This led to the end of Holy Family as a parish as it was merged into Our Lady of the Angels parish. The church continued to be used as a site of worship until 2008 when it was discontinued. The church was nominated in June 2018 to become a City Historic Landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  The church was designed by Polish architect Antoni A. Pyzdrowski. The Holy Family Church stands out amongst his works by being one of the few works he did in the ecclesiastical architectural style. The building is specifically representative of the late Romanesque Revival style, a subset of the eclectic period. This period was notable for incorporating twentieth century design principles while sampling from periods of the past. The Holy Family Church‚Äôs historical basis comes from the German Rundbogenstil style. The church is a rare example of pre-World War II architecture with the fusing of modern design principles and historical sampling.

The bridge can be vertically raised to allow cargo ships to access the inner city, and lowered to allow cars, trains and pedestrians to cross. The bridge is named after the Schwanenturm (meaning 'watch tower) that protected the city walls in the 13th and 14th centuries. History Before the Schwanentorbr√ºcke was constructed, a smaller bridge was used by pedestrians and traders. In 1844, a bridge with train tracks was built, and from 1926 to 1929, it was continuously widened and improved. The Schwanentorbr√ºcke was designed by Hans-Siegfried Persch and completed in 1950. When the city updated the trains in Duisburg they also updated and improved the bridge. These improvements were done with plans by Foster & Partner. The transportation industry moved out of the city, meaning the bridge no longer needs to be raised. Workers began a two-stage reconstruction project for the bridge on April 9, 2018. It was expected to last 18 months and cost ‚Ç¨4.5 million. Structure The bridge has four supporting towers. Inside each tower is a pulley system that lifts the bridge. Electric motors run the bridge, but each tower also contains counter weights weighing several tons which help to lift the bridge. On top of each tower sit large glass lanterns.

Kelly. Released on SoundCloud on July 23, 2018, the song addresses the singer's sex scandals and allegations. \\"I Admit\\" was written by Kelly and Raphael Ramos Oliveira, and produced by Kelly and Noc. The release of \\"I Admit\\" followed a 2017 BuzzFeed News investigative report that alleged that Kelly operated a \\"sex cult\\", and a 2018 boycott of Kelly backed by Time's Up. In \\"I Admit\\", Kelly makes a number of confessions, including that he is dyslexic, that he has been sexually unfaithful, and that he was raped. Kelly does not make any criminal admissions, but instead denies allegations of domestic violence and pedophilia. The lyrics rebuke Jim DeRogatis for his BuzzFeed News report, and disavow the report's allegations that Kelly is in charge of a \\"sex cult\\". Critics reviewed \\"I Admit\\" unfavorably. Some reviewers contrasted the title with the lack of criminal admissions in the lyrics, and described the song as an act of trolling. The song was compared to Kelly's rap opera Trapped in the Closet and O. J. Simpson's book If I Did It. Reviewers noted that Kelly's lyrics more closely resemble a self-defense than an admission or mea culpa. The release of \\"I Admit\\" led to a response from DeRogatis, who defended his journalism in two interviews. R. Kelly's ex-wife, Andrea Kelly, and brother, Carey Killa Kelly, released songs in response to \\"I Admit\\" that contain additional allegations against R. Kelly. The song also attracted criticism on social media.  Background and release  Time's Up advocated for a boycott of Kelly's music in 2018. \\"I Admit\\" is Kelly's first release since his 2016 holiday album, 12 Nights of Christmas. In July 2017, Jim DeRogatis contributed an article to BuzzFeed News detailing legal investigations from three families regarding their daughters' alleged kidnappings after they established relationships with Kelly. The article characterized Kelly's operations as a \\"cult\\", and included interviews with three of Kelly's former associates. However, both Kelly and the daughters refuted the claims. In April 2018, the Women of Color branch of the Time's Up movement announced their support for the Mute R. Kelly social media campaign, which advocated for music venues to cancel Kelly's concert dates and for Sony Music to terminate Kelly's recording contract. The organization published a demand on The Root for RCA Records, Ticketmaster, Spotify, Apple Music, and the Greensboro Coliseum Complex to end their business relationships with Kelly. Spotify removed Kelly's music from their playlists after introducing a \\"hate content and hateful conduct\\" policy in May 2018, but rescinded the policy in June 2018 after people in the music industry, including Kendrick Lamar's representative, accused the company of censorship. \\"I Admit\\" was released on the SoundCloud account of Julius Darrington, CEO of the AudioDream record label, on July 23, 2018. RCA Records, Kelly's primary label, did not confirm whether they were associated with the song. Kelly promoted the release with a post, \\"Today is the day you've been waiting for\\", across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. After the January 2019 broadcast of Surviving R. Kelly, Kelly appeared in a CBS This Morning interview on March 8, 2019, in which Gayle King asked him whether \\"I Admit\\" was his \\"way of confessing\\". Kelly responded, \\"That question makes no sense, no offense, but what I'm saying is this: 'I Admit' was me expressing my feelings about the things I was going through. If you're listening to it, you can hear exactly what I'm admitting.\\"  Lyrics  In \\"I Admit\\", Kelly admits to various acts, including dropping out of high school and not attending church. Kelly claims to be dyslexic, and asserts that his inability to read his recording contract caused him to forfeit publishing rights to his music, which contributed to Kelly's financial troubles, including his $20 million tax debt to the Internal Revenue Service. In the song, Kelly confesses that he was sexually unfaithful and frequented strip clubs. Kelly reveals that he lost his virginity in his childhood when he was raped by an older female family member, elaborating on the disclosures from his 2012 autobiography, Soulacoaster: The Diary of Me. Despite the song's title and Kelly's repetition of the lyric \\"I admit it, I did it\\" in the chorus, \\"I Admit\\" does not contain any criminal admissions. Kelly denies accusations of domestic violence, involvement in a \\"sex cult\\", and pedophilia in his lyrics, dismissing them as matters of opinion. Kelly does not admit guilt regarding the 2008 acquittal of his sex tape allegations, but maintains that he has been \\"falsely accused\\" and sings that his lawyer advised him to \\"don't say noth'\\". Although Kelly admits to casual sex with \\"both older and young ladies\\", he states that all of them were \\"over age\\". The lyrics denounce DeRogatis for profiting from his reports of Kelly's scandals, and John Legend, Steve Harvey, and Tom Joyner for refusing to publicly defend Kelly from his accusers. In response to the Mute R. Kelly campaign, Kelly sings, \\"only God can mute me\\". Kelly expresses support for a \\"women's group\\", but also exclaims that \\"they tryna lock me up like Bill\\", referring to Bill Cosby, who at the time was awaiting incarceration after his April 2018 sexual assault convictions. Kelly finishes the song by telling the audience to \\"stay the fuck out of my business\\", and inviting his hometown of Chicago to use his image as inspiration for city youth.  Critical reception  \\"I Admit\\" was compared to If I Did It, a book by O. J. Simpson (pictured). Several reviewers characterized \\"I Admit\\" as an act of trolling, since the name of the song overstates the magnitude of the admissions contained within the lyrics. Elyse Wanshel of HuffPost noted similarities between this song and If I Did It, a book by O. J. Simpson that contains a hypothetical description of the alleged murder in Simpson's murder case. Writing for The Daily Beast, Stereo Williams described the song as \\"20 minutes of defensive rambling and R. Kelly nailing himself to a cross\\". Williams asserted that Kelly \\"paints himself as the victim: the victim of the media, of sycophants, of his childhood abuser, of his own illiteracy\\" while \\"baiting his critics with a number of shockingly brazen lyrical references to his behavior\\". In a review for The Atlantic, Hannah Giorgis compared the song's structure to Kelly's rap opera Trapped in the Closet, and remarked, \\"The specter of harmful actions is softened by the harmonies of the lullaby.\\" Giorgis described Kelly's delivery as \\"a stomach-churning mix of self-pity and hubris\\" and criticized Kelly for refusing to address the alleged victims directly. She noted that \\"at no point does he speak to‚Äîrather than at or about‚Äîthe women who have come forward\\" and wrote, \\"none of the women who have recounted tales of Kelly's abuse is worthy of being the hero in this story. Kelly, and Kelly alone, occupies that mantle.\\" Ann-Derrick Gaillot of The Outline considered \\"I Admit\\" a \\"bad song\\" and \\"a 20-minute long plea to save his dying career\\", and stated that the release of the song demonstrated that Kelly was \\"no longer invincible\\". In Rolling Stone, Michael Arcenaux lambasted Kelly for attempting to \\"invoke his own trauma to excuse the grief he is alleged to have caused in so many women and girls\\". Broadlys Leila Ettachfini labeled the song as \\"a bizarre attempt to garner some sympathy from the public in hopes that it could somehow absolve Kelly for his alleged crimes against women and girls\\", but remarked that \\"the song doesn't seem to be achieving Kelly's desired effect\\".  Responses  Andrea Kelly (pictured) shared lyrics to \\"Admit It\\", her remix of \\"I Admit\\". In interviews with Variety and Billboard, DeRogatis denied that his reporting of Kelly's allegations had been a significant factor in his own career growth. DeRogatis defended his continued coverage of Kelly by disclosing that he still received calls from sources. He said, \\"You're not a journalist or a human being if you get those calls and do not do your job.\\" Regarding the song's composition, DeRogatis saw \\"I Admit\\" as a continuation of Kelly's 10-minute remix of \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\" from his unreleased album Loveland, in which Kelly sings a plea to Saint Peter at the gates of heaven. Andrea Kelly, R. Kelly's ex-wife, shared lyrics to her remix titled \\"Admit It\\" on Instagram on July 24, 2018. In her remix, Andrea alleges that R. Kelly physically abused her and neglected their children. In response to a lyric on \\"I Admit\\" where R. Kelly describes his relationship with his deceased mother, Joanne Kelly, Andrea sings that Joanne would disapprove of his actions. Andrea also accuses R. Kelly of being a \\"dead beat dad\\" and urges him to obtain \\"professional help\\". R. Kelly's brother, Carey Killa Kelly, released a diss track named \\"I Confess\\" on YouTube on August 3, 2018. Replying to R. Kelly's claim on \\"I Admit\\" that Carey abandoned him, Carey echoes an April 2018 sexual misconduct allegation in which a woman accused R. Kelly of intentionally giving her a sexually transmitted infection. In \\"I Confess\\", Carey also implies that R. Kelly had sex with other men. Black Twitter responded negatively to \\"I Admit\\", with many users expressing disgust at the song's lyrical content. The song was poorly received by other artists; Talib Kweli remarked that Kelly's \\"lack of self awareness is atrocious\\" and Questlove tweeted, \\"#IAdmit I want my 19 mins back\\". The co-founder of the Mute R. Kelly social media campaign, Oronike Odeleye, called the song a \\"19-minute sex trafficking fundraising anthem\\" and interpreted its release as an indicator of Mute R. Kelly's success. In an interview with the Associated Press, Odeleye reaffirmed the campaign's efforts to eliminate Kelly's remaining concert dates. Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network spokeswoman Jodi Omear criticized the song's lyrics and stated, \\"Laws aren't opinions\\". An attorney representing the family of Joycelyn Savage, one of the daughters mentioned in DeRogatis's BuzzFeed News article, rebuked Kelly for trying to \\"shift the narrative\\" and demanded Savage's release.

The condition affects predominately psychologically traumatized children and adolescents in the midst of a strenuous and lengthy migration process. Young people reportedly develop depressive symptoms, become socially withdrawn, and become motionless and speechless as a reaction to stress and hopelessness. In the worst cases, children reject any food or drink and have to be fed by feeding tube. The condition could persist for years. Recovery ensues within months to years and is claimed to be dependent on the restoration of hope to the family. More recently, this phenomenon has been called into question, with two children witnessing that they were forced by their parents to act apathehic in order to increase chances of being granted residence permits. As evidenced by medical records, healthcare professionals were aware of this scam, and witnessed parents who actively refused aid for their children, but remained silent at the time. Later, Sveriges Television, Sweden's national public television broadcaster, were severely critiqued by investigative journalist Janne Josefsson for failing to uncover the truth. In mars 2020, a report was released showing that studies have found no scientific basis for diagnosis and treatment of children claimed to be suffering from resignation syndrome .  Signs and symptoms  Affected individuals (predominantly children and adolescents) first exhibit symptoms of anxiety and depression (in particular apathy, lethargy), then withdraw from others and care for themselves. Eventually their condition might progress to stupor, i.e. they stop walking, eating, talking, and grow incontinent. In this stage patients are seemingly unconscious and tube feeding is life sustaining. The condition could persist for months or even years, remission happens after life circumstances improve and ensues with gradual return to what appears to be normal function.  Nosology  RS and pervasive refusal syndrome shares common features and etiologic factors; however, the former is more clearly associated with trauma and adverse life circumstances. Neither is included in the standard psychiatric classification systems. Pervasive Refusal Syndrome (also called Pervasive Arousal-Withdrawal Syndrome) has been conceptualised in a variety of ways, including a form of post-traumatic stress disorder, learned helplessness, ‚Äòlethal mothering‚Äô, loss of the internal parent, apathy or the ‚Äògiving-up‚Äô syndrome, depressive devitalisation, primitive ‚Äòfreeze‚Äô, severe loss of activities of daily living and ‚Äòmanipulative‚Äô illness. It was also suggested to be on the 'refusal-withdrawal-regression spectrum'. Acknowledging its social importance and relevance, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recognized the novel diagnostic entity resignation syndrome in 2014Socialstyrelsen B. (2013). Barn Med Uppgivenhetssyndrom. En v√§gledning f√∂r Personal inom Socialtj√§nst och H√§lso- och Sjukv√•rd. Stockholm: Socialstyrelsen.. While others argue that already-existing diagnostic entities should be used and are sufficient in the majority of cases, i.e. severe major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms or catatonia, or conversion/dissociation disorder. Currently, diagnostic criteria are undetermined, pathogenesis is uncertain, and effective treatment is lacking.  Causes  Resignation syndrome appears to be a very specialized response to the trauma of refugee limbo, in which families, many of whom have escaped dangerous circumstances in their home countries, wait to be granted legal permission to stay in their new country, often undergoing numerous refusals and appeals over a period of years. Experts proposed multifactorial explanatory models involving individual vulnerability, traumatization, migration, culturally conditioned reaction patterns and parental dysfunction or pathological adaption to a caregiver‚Äôs expectations to interplay in pathogenesis. Severe depression or conversion/dissociation disorder has been also suggested (as best diagnostic alternatives). However, the currently prevailing stress hypothesis fails to account for the regional distribution (see Epidemiology) and contributes little to treatment. An asserted ‚Äúquestioning attitude‚Äù, in particular within the health care system, it has been claimed, may constitute a ‚Äúperpetuating retraumatization possibly explaining the endemic‚Äù distribution. Furthermore, Sweden‚Äôs experience raises concerns about \\"contagion\\". Researchers argue that culture-bound psychogenesis can accommodate the endemic distribution because children may learn that dissociation is a way to deal with trauma. A proposed neurobiological model of the disorder suggests that the impact of overwhelming negative expectations are directly causative of the down-regulation of higher order and lower order behavioral systems in particularly vulnerable individuals.  Epidemiology  Depicted as a culture-bound syndrome, it was first observed and described in Sweden among children of asylum seekers from former Soviet and Yugoslav countries.. In Sweden, hundreds of migrant children, facing the possibility of deportation, have been diagnosed since the 1990s. For example, 424 cases were reported between 2003 and 2005; and 2.8% of all 6547 asylum applications submitted for children were diagnosed in 2004. It has also been observed in refugee children transferred from Australia to the Nauru Regional Processing Centre. The Economist wrote in 2018 that Doctors without Borders (MSF) refused to say how many of the children on Nauru may be suffering from traumatic withdrawal syndrome. A report published in August 2018 suggested there were at least 30. The National Justice Project, a legal centre, has brought 35 children from Nauru this year. It estimates that seven were suffering from RS, and three were psychotic.

Location Poljica is located on the western part of the island of Krk, in the area of the island called ≈†otovento. Like all settlements in ≈†otovento, Poljica is not on the coast but in the interior of the island, about 3 km southeast of ƒåavlena bay. In the immediate vicinity are the villages Bajƒçiƒái and Nenadiƒái. Approximately 6 km away is Malinska and about 10 km is the town of Krk. The village is located just off the D104 Road.  History  In ancient times this area was inhabited by the Illyrians. In the Middle Ages, until the 15th century, this part of the island was predominantly deserted and poorly inhabited. In order to increase tax revenues, Ivan VII Frankopan settled in the mid- 15th century in this area Vlachs and Morlachs from Velebit. However, there were very few true ethnic Vlachs among them, most of whom were Croats. Poljica had the greatest significance in the second half of the 19th century. At about the same time, in 1848, the first school opened in ≈†otovento. Until then, the only educational institution had been a Franciscan monastery at Glavotok.  Population  According to the last census of 2001, there were 62 inhabitants in Poljica. Population growth has been moderate. Since there have been official data since the middle of the 19th century, Poljica had a mild and gradual increase in population by mid-20th century. In 1953, they had a maximum of 89 residents. Since then, the population has declined slightly.https://www.dzs.hr  Economy  Poljica is surrounded by traditional agricultural land. The most important are field crops, cattle breeding and olive trees. Nearby in Nenadiƒái is a food-processing plant. Much of the residents work in nearby bigger places on the island such as Malinska or Krk. Due to its in the interior of the island, tourism has not developed. However Poljica is not far from the sea, and it has preserved indigenous architecture with old stone houses.  Culture  A plaque on the Saints Cosmas and Damian church in the village of Poljica on the island of Krk. Although a small village, Poljica has many Renaissance buildings. Among them, the bell tower of the parish church of Saints Cosmas and Damian is made of fine chrome stone. It was built in 1768, and before it there was another, smaller tower. At its height of 29 meters dominates the village and the surrounding area. A beach at ƒåavlena Bay is 3 km from Poljica. Nearby in the woods at ƒåavlena bay there is a small early Christian church of St. Kr≈°evan. It is not known who built it, but it is considered to be from the 9th century. Not far from Poljica, above the ƒåavlena Bay, there are the largest specimens of oak on the island of Krk. They are considered to be about 400 years old.

Both bridges were built between 1926 and 1927. The westernmost bridge crosses the Queanbeyan River from Queanbeyan to Queanbeyan East at , while the easternmost bridge (approximately to the east) crosses the Molonglo River at Burbong (now Carwoola) at . The two railway bridges are owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. Together, the two bridges were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The bridges were first built by contractors Johnston & Co. in 1885-87 along with the extension of the railway from Bungendore to Michelago through Queanbeyan. The Molonglo River bridge was completed in May 1886 and the Queanbeyan River bridge in July 1887, both opening with the line in September 1887. The original bridges consisted of arched hardwood timber girders on brick piers and stone abutments, featuring four spans (Molonglo River) and five spans (Queanbeyan River) of each. The stone for the abutments came from the quarries at Pyrmont in Sydney. A temporary bridge over the Queanbeyan River during construction was reported at the time to be the largest temporary railway bridge ever constructed in New South Wales. The bridges were completely rebuilt in 1926‚Äì27 at a cost of A¬£19,000, re-using the foundations of the original bridge. Both bridges were of the Warren deck steel truss type, consisting of four steel spans on the approaches to each side with three (Queanbeyan River) and two (Molonglo River) spans of comprising the main bridge. The timbers of the original bridge were still in \\"a remarkable state of preservation\\" when replaced, such that it could not be cut in some cases. The bridge upgrade allowed a heavier type of engine to be run on the line. The Molonglo River bridge is sometimes known as the Burbong bridge, Burbong being a historical name for its location.  Heritage listing  The Queanbeyan rail bridges over Queanbeyan and Burbong Rivers was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item has some historical rarity due its association with the 1887 Cooma Railway and the reuse of the original foundations for the 1926 replacement trusses. The Warren deck trusses are relatively rare because there are only four other railway sites in NSW with this type of superstructure.

The historic nature of the town has been recognised with the listing of the entire town on the former Register of the National Estate on 21 October 1980 and the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 3 April 2006.  History  = Early European settlement 1822‚Äì1839 =  Exploration  Europeans first entered the upper Shoalhaven River basin in 1822 under instruction from the new Governor, Thomas Brisbane, to investigate the possibility of a track between the Limestone Plains and Bateman's Bay. The reports of good country would have stimulated land selection in the area.  Land grants  The system of land grants available in the 1820s were attractive to settlers. A free grant of 640 acres of land (one square mile) was given to a selector for every ¬£500 of money or stock held, with a limit of 2000 acres, shortly afterwards increased to 2560 (four square miles). Captain Duncan Mackellar, one of the earliest settlers in the area, was granted 2000 acres in 1822 with which he selected the property \\"Strathallan\\". However it appears he didn't move onto the land until about 1829.  County and parish settlement model  When Governor Darling succeeded Governor Brisbane in 1825 he brought from London a new set of Instructions providing for the colony to be settled according to the English pattern of counties (approx 40 miles by 40 miles). The county boundaries were to generally follow natural features such as streams and ranges and were to have a county town and be divided again into hundreds (11 square miles) and parishes (25 square miles). The parishes were to be, as they were in England, a support for the Church of England that would eventually have a church, burial ground and parsonage in each parish. When the number of people allowed, parish local government of the English kind could be adopted. The Church and Schools corporation was to have one seventh of the land in each county for support of the Church of England. However it soon became apparent that the sparse populations in outer-lying areas would not support such a system, unlike in the densely populated areas such as Sydney.  Early survey instructions to Hoddle  Survey of the County of St Vincent had commenced in 1824 in the most northerly area. By December 1827 Assistant Surveyor Robert Hoddle (who later surveyed Melbourne) reported that the Shoalhaven had been traced to its source. Earlier in October that year Surveyor General of New South Wales John Oxley instructed Hoddle to mark out land grants for intending settlers in the County of St Vincent. The Anglican Church received priority treatment being allocated one seventh of the whole county consisting of the best land on the east bank of the Shoalhaven River. The Church and School Estate comprised approx 42,000 acres on the east side of the Shoalhaven River with a straight north‚Äìsouth boundary as the estate's east edge. This boundary line had significant ramifications for the subsequent land settlement pattern with Strathallan, Braidwood Farm and Coghill's land all granted east of this line. Even though the Church and School Estate was resumed the legacy of its land allocation remains clearly visible in the landscape today. Other settlers authorised to take possession of land were: :Dr Wilson RN 2560 acres grant, :Mr D Mackellar 2000 acres grant, :Mr Coghill 2000 acres grant :Mr Coghill 4000 acres purchase :Mr Ryrie 2560 acres grant :Mr Francis Dixon 2000 acres grant :Mr Francis Dixon 2000 acres purchase :Mr George Bunn 2560 grant :Mr D Mackellar Junior 640 grant Oxley's instructions stated \\"These are the only settlers who have any title to land in the vicinity of Mt Solus (Mt Gillamatong)\\". According to the census of October 1828 there were approximately 90 Europeans living in the area however few property owners were resident on their grant. After 1831 free grants of land ceased but the remaining land suitable for pastoral development was soon sold.  Early European Settlers  ;Captain Duncan Mackellar Three property holders feature significantly in Braidwood's establishment. Captain Duncan Mackellar and family joined his nephew at Strathallan in about 1829 and to their combined land grants of 3250, added another 4000 by purchase. Mackellar had one of the larger and more centrally located properties in the 19th County (St Vincent) and played a key role in the area until he sold the property in 1836. The bulk of the land was sold to John Coghill who owned the property on which Bedervale now stands. A small portion of land adjoining the \\"Jellamatong\\" (spellings vary) village reserve was sold to Dr Thomas Braidwood Wilson whose land adjoined Strathallan to the south. ;Thomas Braidwood Wilson Wilson had selected 2560 acres earlier, but it was not until 1836 that he settled on \\"Braidwood Farm\\" with his wife and two children. Wilson had been a Surgeon Superintendent of ships taking convicts to NSW and Van Diemen's Land. He was first granted land in Van Diemen's Land in 1824, which he exchanged for land near Lake George in 1825. In addition he was given 2560 acres which he selected in the \\"new country\\" on 2 tributaries of the Shoalhaven, Monkittee and Flood creeks. Surveyor Hoddle was instructed in 1827 to survey it before all other grants promised in the area. In 1833 the western end of Wilson's grant was resumed and reserved for a future village and a similar area added to the eastern end in compensation. Wilson was a humane and progressive thinker and it would seem that his settling in the area was encouraged by the administration. Wilson visited \\"Braidwood Farm\\" when he was in the colony but it was not until late 1836 that he settled there with his wife and family. He became a community leader and amongst other things contracted to build the first courthouse in 1837‚Äì38. In 1840 Wilson petitioned the government to build a road from Braidwood to Huskisson (The Wool Road) to enable faster and cheaper shipping of the wool clip to Sydney and, with Col John Mackenzie, supplied the materials and labour for the Braidwood to Nerriga section. In 1841 Braidwood Farm had 141 residents, twice the number on Coghill's combined properties of Bedervale and Strathallan. Although the drought had broken in 1840, the subsequent depression sent Wilson bankrupt and he died in November 1843. His land was sold to John Coghill for (Pounds)2,000 who now owned all the land on the south, east and north of the town. Before his death, Wilson had purchased the block immediately to the north of Braidwood. He was buried on this block, high on the hill overlooking the town. A memorial and large pine tree clearly mark the site, from which there are superb views of the town. ;John Coghill John Coghill was an astute businessman and manager. He had also managed a property for John Oxley, Surveyor General, near Camden, from which he ran a merchandising depot. Coghill had acquired the Bedervale property -28 and visited frequently. He occasionally sat as a magistrate on the bench with Duncan Mackellar and made submissions to the colonial secretary on matters that affected the future of the area. In the mid to late 1830s Coghill engaged John Verge, well known colonial architect, to draw up house plans, and the house was completed by about 1842. It was also in the mid to late 1830s that Coghill purchased Strathallan. While on a trip overseas John Coghill's daughter Elizabeth married Robert Maddrell, who came from the Isle of Man and was studying medicine at Heidelberg University. They returned to Australia and inherited Bedervale on Coghill's death in 1853. The property included Braidwood Farm which Maddrell renamed Mona, the original name for his birthplace, the Isle of Man. Under Robert Maddrell's management the estate expanded to 33,000 acres, much of it farmed by tenant farmers. By 1860, Robert Maddrell had 84 tenants on the three large Maddrell properties that surrounded Braidwood. Portions of these farms were eventually sold to the tenants, but in 1882 Robert Maddrell still had 52,000 acres. Most significantly however, the ownership of the land on the north, east and south of the town by one family resulted in the town boundary on these sides remaining virtually intact and the landscape remaining large open paddocks, although there has been some recent subdivision and modification to this cultural landscape.  Nineteen Counties  The Colonial Office in London attempted to impose a policy of closer settlement in the Instructions given to the incoming Governor Darling in 1825. The size of free grants was limited to 2,560 acres and purchases to 9,600 acres. Settled land was to be surveyed, and land was not to be granted before the area was surveyed. The arrival of these orders threw the administration into confusion. It had no such surveyed area ready, and no surveyors available. On the other hand, it had promised land to many recently arrived settlers who could not now be denied it or kept long in waiting. To meet its promises it had a line, the \\"Limits of Location\\", drawn around the outlying patches of settlement. Within this line settlers could select their land without prior survey. The area within the \\"Limits of Location\\" was subdivided into nineteen counties, however further division into \\"hundreds\\" was abandoned outside the County of Cumberland. Parish boundaries continued to be surveyed until 1830. Each county was to have a county town being the chief market, and administrative centre, with major courts for civil and criminal justice. However most counties did not have sufficient population to support such a town. The Nineteen Counties were not finally proclaimed until 1835.  Survey Grid  The preferred method of land survey at the time was effectively to lay a rectangular grid over the land surface, preferably in advance of settlement so that selected blocks could be accurately located. This was the system adopted earlier in the United States and such a survey system commenced in NSW in 1821. However, Governor Darling's instructions from London of 1825 required that the natural boundaries of the counties (rivers and ranges) be surveyed for valuation purposes before any more land could be alienated. Consequently, the few available surveyors were set to mapping rivers and ranges directly, rather than by plotting them in the course of extending a series of grid lines as was done in much of the United States. In NSW grid lines, often of one square mile, were drawn on the maps that had been made from surveying natural features, and transferred to the ground piecemeal and as required by persons selecting isolated areas for purchase. At the time, there was a shortage of skilled surveyors and equipment and irregularities appeared. Rather than determine true north, surveyors usedmagnetic bearings, which changed each year, and locally, according to compass deviation. This was further complicated by worn equipment and as a consequence of this piecemeal approach certain boundary lines failed to meet at right angles. This probably explains why Braidwood's town boundary does not run parallel to the street grid, particularly on the eastern side.  Village reserves set aside In the settlement model of the time, there was to be a village to each parish (twenty-five square miles) and so surveyors allowed for village reserves approximately 5 miles apart. Hoddle set aside reserves for future townships including one near Kurraduckbidgee (Arn Prior), one centrally located (the present site of Braidwood) and another further south where Jembaicumbene Creek enters the Shoalhaven. The central village reserve, known as \\"Jillamatong\\" after the nearby mountain, was sited on Thomas Braidwood Wilson's land grant adjacent to the church reserve. Wilson's block was extended on the east boundary to compensate for the loss of the reserved land. Police Districts The Colonial Office in London had instructed Governor Darling to establish a settlement and administration pattern based on the English model with the church playing a major role. However, the system of effective local government that emerged in the penal colony in the 1830s was one of police districts with a professional paid police magistrate as the local administrator. Police district boundaries as drawn by Governor Gipps in 1840 varied from the county boundaries, and counties and parishes survived only in the land survey as a means of describing allotments in deeds and, for much of the century, also as statistical areas for collecting population and agricultural data. Braidwood became the centre of the \\"Braidwood Police District\\". Convictism In the official 1828 census, of the 18 landholders listed in the County of St Vincent only five had their proprietor in residence. The official population of the area in that year was about 90, of whom fifty percent were convicts serving their sentence, eleven percent were ex convicts and seven percent had tickets of leave. A settler could apply for 8 convict servants for every 640 acres and an extra convict for each additional 160 acres. The convicts were an essential part of the labour force, particularly in the newly opened and remote areas. The rapid spread of settlement raised concerns, especially back in London, of the colonial administration's ability to control and service the broad and sparsely populated area. NSW in the 1820s and 30s was still primarily a penal colony. The British Government was determined that it should be seen as a place of punishment and so act as a deterrent against crime, and frequent directives to the NSW Governor attempted to make the administration in the colony more severe and effective. Transportation itself was the primary punishment, but a series of secondary punishments were thought to be necessary to control the large convict population in a \\"jail without walls\\". At the same time convicts also had rights under the law. No settler was supposed to punish his own assigned men. Minor offences were to be brought before a bench of one or two magistrates. In the 1820s magistrates were local settlers and figures of authority. Before 1832 a magistrate hearing cases by himself could order a maximum of 150 lashes. After 1832 this was reduced to a maximum of 50 lashes. More serious cases were taken before the quarter session of a Supreme Court at Bungonia or Berrima. The police district evolved as the form of local government in the 1830s, superseding the parish and country model.  Need for local court and lockup  Prior to the town of Braidwood being established, Captain Duncan Mackellar of Strathallan was appointed to the bench (1833) and allocated a policeman and a scourger (flogger) to assist in his administration, and he became the most important magistrate in the area. The other senior appointed magistrate, Major Elrington (reportedly known locally as \\"the flogging Major\\"), was further to the south and he too had a constable. The fact that there were only two unmounted constables in the vast Braidwood district, and no lockup, was the subject of constant complaint to the Colonial Secretary by the settlers. Courthouse influences the town's location The magistrate carried out most functions of government and required a courthouse and a lockup gaol. This was often the reason behind the planning of a town since the surveyor general would resist the idea of choosing sites for official buildings without reference to the town plan as a whole. The town created a promising commercial site, especially as the Surveyor General usually consulted residents as to which village reserve would most effectively serve their needs. When the Government agreed to build a courthouse and lockup in the district they recognised that it would form the nucleus of a future town and considered representations from local land- holders. Coghill suggested the more southerly village reserve on the junction of Jembaicumbene Creek and Shoalhaven River primarily because of the more reliable water supply. However Mackellar, as the local senior magistrate, wanted it closer to Strathallan. Consequently, the \\"Jillamatong\\" reserve was chosen, and the courthouse and lockup built by the enterprising Thomas Braidwood Wilson in 1837‚Äì38. In addition to the lockup at the rear of the court, a barracks for 6 mounted police and horses was constructed on the north side of Monkittee Creek on the edge of the police paddock. The courthouse, lockup, barracks and pound keepers hut are the only structures shown on the map that Larmer drew prior to his survey of the village which was gazetted on 24 April 1839. The plan was a standard grid with streets one and a half chains wide (99 feet). First land auction was 9 July 1840 with blocks half an acre in size. Various factors led to the cessation of convict transportation in NSW in 1840. However the policy of assigning convicts to settlers as cheap labour ended by mid 1839 and by the late 1840s there were only a few convicts left in the region, as even those commuted to life sentence in 1839 were eligible for a ticket of leave by 1847. The judicial system necessary for managing the \\"jail without walls\\" was directly responsible for the district town being located in the \\"Jillamatong\\" village reserve, and for the first buildings erected in the town. Ironically however, at about the time the courthouse and lockup were completed, and the town gazetted, the convict era had virtually ended. = Establishment of the town =  Early town planning in NSW  An official passion for rectangular order extended to the new country towns in NSW. Few were laid out before 1830, but Governor Darling promulgated planning regulations in his anxiety to bring all aspects of colonial administration into a rigid system. His new regulations, which were published in the Sydney Gazette in May 1829, emphasised uniformity and regularity as their guiding principles. Officials disagreed on the best width for town streets in hot climates such as NSW. Surveyor General TL Mitchell preferred the narrow shady streets of Spain where he had served in the Peninsular War. Some who had served in India argued that wide streets were preferable as they allowed the circulation of breezes. Governor Darling was of the India faction and fixed the main streets at 120 feet, including 10-foot pedestrian paths on each side, with cross streets of 84 feet. The main and cross streets formed a rectangular grid enclosing blocks of half acre allotments. Builders were required to set houses back fourteen feet from their front boundaries. Although there was opportunity to vary the plan to accommodate form and natural features, often this did not occur. While Surveyor General Mitchell explored the opportunities of town planning within the grid system (e.g. Maitland), most surveyors applied the plan in a conventional manner. Braidwood is a very good surviving example of a colonial Georgian town plan with its simple grid still largely intact. Several people influenced its shape. Hoddle defined the outer perimeter (and presumably selected the location) of the \\"Jillamatong\\" reserve by resuming the western half-mile of T B Wilson's property. James Larmer prepared the draft plan in accordance with Governor Darling's model. In 1839 Wilson wrote to the colonial secretary asking that the original plan of Braidwood village be altered to include a park opposite the courthouse (which he had just built). He thought the reserve would enhance the building and be valued by the residents as a market place and for recreation. Surveyor General Mitchell was clearly progressive and far-sighted in his thinking, and among other things, appeared keen for a town plan to be adapted to the physical and social dimensions of a place. Mitchell instructed Larmer to amend the town plan in accordance with Wilson's suggestion. The \\"Reserve for Public Recreation\\" initially set aside by Larmer was in the south east of the town, but larger than its present size. The reserve may have been reduced to its present size to compensate for the land set aside for the reserve at the intersection of Wilson and Wallace Streets. Eventually the \\"Jillamatong\\" Village Reserve became known as Braidwood, presumably after Wilson's adjacent homestead Braidwood Farm.  Early development in the town  The Braidwood Hotel, which was established in 1859 Several buildings were erected /41, including the first Doncaster Inn (1841‚Äì1907). The economic depression of the early 1840s slowed development for a few years but gradually a business centre developed along Mackellar Street adjacent to Monkittee Creek and on the north-facing slope of Wallace Street. Proximity to creek water was obviously an incentive to spread along Mackellar Street as was, apparently, the disincentive of ascending the \\"Jew's Hill\\" (Benjamin Moses is shown as the owner of the block on the south east corner of Mackellar and Wallace streets). Surveyor Larmer purchased land and built the Royal Hotel (the present Museum). In Mackellar Street the three-storeyed Albert Buildings, later converted to a steam-driven flourmill, were used as shops by Hendricks and Jacobs ( still standing). On the corner of Mackellar and Wallace Streets was the Post Office and store (still standing). A District Council had been established in 1843. The first steam mill was erected in 1846 at the junction of Monkittee Creek and Mona Creek near the site of Dr Wilson's first house at Braidwood Farm (the footings are still evident). The population grew from 1100 in the 1841 census to a total of 1429 in the Braidwood Police District in 1851, 212 of who lived in the town. With the discovery of gold in Araluen in mid 1851, and throughout the region soon after, Braidwood's role as the primary town in the district strengthened. Braidwood's business centre eventually crept over the hill and to the south end of Wallace Street following the survey of the road to Nelligen, and the continuing business from the goldfields to the south. Braidwood's \\"National School\\" was opened in 1849 in Wilson Street opposite the present site. The government granted part of the present site in 1851 and a permanent building was finished in 1852. A brewery was opened in 1851 along with numerous other businesses and small industries. The Joint Stock Bank was built 1855 in response to the gold boom, with others following. By 1857 there were three tanning factories in the town. The 1856 census shows 3045 people in Braidwood police district and in 1861 there were 959 people in the town and 8199 in the surrounding goldfields. The town's population climbed to 1197 by 1871. A small brick Anglican Church and rectory was erected in Wilson Street in 1856. A larger church in Elrington St was dedicated in 1892 and the tower finally added 1899, all from granite quarried on Wilson's Hill and Mt Gillamatong. One third of the local population was Catholic and by 1865 St Bedes was completed. The Wesleyan Church in Duncan Street was built 1856 and the Presbyterian Church erected in 1861 on the corner of Duncan and Monkittee. The Commercial Hotel, which is currently being restored by John Mitchell, was built in 1859. In 1866 there were eleven other hotels in Braidwood besides the Doncaster, the Royal and the Commercial. The Court House Hotel still stands as a two-storey brick building in Wallace Street as does the Gold Diggers Home, which became Nomchong's hardware and now a bottle shop diagonally opposite St Bedes. Nomchong, who came from China to the goldfields, moved from Mongarlowe to Braidwood in 1879 and his family became well known locally. In the late 1860s, 1870s and 80s, many of the less substantial buildings were demolished and brick and granite structures took their place. In 1861 a substantial two- storey gaol and gaoler's residence was erected at northern end of Wallace Street where the barracks for the mounted police had been built 25 years earlier. By 1862 the old mounted police barracks were uninhabitable. The building was repaired to provide extra accommodation for the increased number of police who were sent to the district to control bushranging activity. Repairs and extensions were also made to the courthouse. In 1866 Colonial Architect James Barnet visited Braidwood to review the public buildings. A brick police barracks and stables was constructed next to the courthouse in 1865 and is still in use today. The telegraph station (the current postmaster residence) was constructed in 1864. In 1869 post and telegraph services were merged and the post office moved to its present location, which was preferred, as it was more central to the town. A reservoir had been formed by the construction of a causeway on Monkittee Creek where the road entered the township to provide water. By 1885 the transition of the main business district over the hill to the southern slope of Wallace Street was complete. Shortly after, the present Royal Hotel was erected, as were some adjacent two- storey shops (all still standing). The town had been optimistic in the 1870s and 80s that it would be connected to the rail and, rather hopefully, named a street on the northern edge of town Station Street, and constructed the Railway Hotel where Wallace Street crosses Monkittee Creek. However, the golden years were over, and drought and depression struck in the 1890s with a series of droughts from 1895 to 1911. Construction in Braidwood's business area virtually ceased. =After 1900= The Braidwood District Soldiers' Memorial The first car entered the town in 1903. In 1913 Ryrie Park, which was known as Market Square in 1866, was leased for grazing and, as a result, stock damaged the trees and fences. In 1925 the Municipal Council organised the Back to Braidwood Celebrations commemorating 100 years of European Settlement, which was made the occasion of cleaning up and beautifying Ryrie Park. School children collected rubbish, the Forestry Department and the Botanic Gardens donated trees and shrubs. In 1928 the Linwood Lighting Company commenced building a generating plant on the Corner of Wallace and Solus streets. A solid concrete basement was constructed to house a freezing works and ice making factory that would carry the water tanks above to provide steam for the generator, however the company collapsed in the depths of the depression in 1931. Eventually electric lighting of the main street was connected in Feb 1936. Braidwood was connected to the state grid in 1957. Reticulated water was available in 1955, but a sewerage system not installed until 1966. Braidwood's population peaked in 1901. By the 1920s growth in the town had stagnated with a minor depression in 1920‚Äì21. This was followed by the great depression commencing in 1929, and a severe drought with a grasshopper plague in 1931. A rabbit freezing works was located in Duncan St. The trough of depression had passed by 1936 when the avenue of Lombardy and Golden poplars was planted at the northern entrance to town to celebrate the 25th year of King George V's reign. Braidwood Country Women's Association also dates from as does the amalgamation of the Municipality of Braidwood (9 sq. miles established in 1891) and the Tallaganda Shire (gazetted 1906). The 1950s saw economic growth with the post WWII population increase and the mid 1950s wool boom, when wool was a \\"pound (¬£) a pound (lb)\\". The north, east and south of the town was still \\"landlocked\\" by the pastoralists and so the town followed earlier growth to the western side. The extension of Duncan Street was patriotically named Coronation Street and the RSL Club built at its end in 1954. The swimming pool, one of the few civic structures dating from the 20th century, was opened in 1965.  Description  The heritage listing includes the township of Braidwood bounded by the historic 1839 town plan, together with surrounding landscape areas essential to the retention and appreciation of its significance. The integrity of Braidwood's town plan is evident in comparative analysis with other regional town's including Bungendore, Queanbeyan, Gundaroo, Goulburn, Berrima and Yass all of which either never consolidated their 19th century built form, or lost their integrity as a result of extensive 20th century development. In several cases the town plans have been split by road and rail. While some towns beyond the region retain high integrity, e.g. Grenfell, they post-date Braidwood by several decades, and do not demonstrate Georgian grid planning to the same degree.  Heritage listing  Braidwood and its setting are of state significance as an excellent surviving example of a Georgian period town plan, dating from the late 1830s. The plan, which retains high integrity, reflects colonial administration as applied to the outer reaches of the Nineteen Counties from the 1820s, following earliest European settlement in the area. The surviving historic elements in the surrounding landscape strengthen the town's significance. The town buildings reflect key phases of development, commencing with the initial construction period in the 1840s, and consolidation in the later half of the century following the gold boom. The integrity of Wallace Street as a fine collection of 19th century buildings makes it particularly significant. The high proportion of 19th century buildings throughout the town contributes further to its heritage value and creates fine streetscapes often with delightful views to the pastoral surrounds. The abrupt transition at the town boundary between built and pastoral landscapes highlights significant historical settlement patterns, specifically the large land grants on the north, east and south sides of the town obtained by McKellar, Wilson and Coghill, and passed on to the Maddrells and eventually others. The juxtaposition of a cohesive town set within an historic pastoral landscape on the north, east and south sides is also significant. The closer settlement on the western side reflects the subdivision of the former Church and School Estate. In NSW, colonial towns that retain significant historic form and fabric to the extent that Braidwood does, are rare. Some 20th century elements in the town reflect later phases of development. Construction is significant for its association with the emergence from the Great Depression and amalgamation of the Municipality of Braidwood with the Tallaganda Shire. Development in the 1950s, particularly to the west of town is significant for its association with post WWII population growth and the mid 1950s wool boom. 20th century development is reflected in most towns in NSW and, in the context of Braidwood, is considered to be of local significance only. Braidwood and Its Setting was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 3 April 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Braidwood is a coherent and well preserved 19th century township set within a rolling pastoral landscape. The town, which dates from 1839, is historically linked to the first European settlement of the area in the 1820s through the influence of land grants, surveying practice, settlement ideals, convictism, civil and judicial administration and the strength of character of the early settlers. Located in the southernmost of the nineteen counties, the town emerged as the centre of the Braidwood Police District by the 1840s. The Georgian town-plan remains large intact, as do a significant number of early buildings. The fine collection of pre 1850s buildings north of Wilson Street attest to the town's focus towards the north during its first decade. The mid to late Victorian buildings south of Wilson Street reflect the impact of the gold discoveries from 1851. The views to and from the surrounding pastoral landscape and road approaches to the north, east and south of the township are integral to the conservation and appreciation of its significance. The initial land grant to the Church and School Estate, combined with the pastoral holdings of Mackellar, Wilson, Coghill and Maddrell created a distinctive land tenure pattern that remains clearly legible in terms of property subdivision, rural housing density, vegetation patterns, boundary fence divisions and road patterns. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Thomas Braidwood Wilson, after whom the town is named, was one of the first people to be granted land in the area. It was from his selection that the village reserve was resumed and the width of his property defined the town's length. Wilson was also responsible for recommending a reserve be set aside, that eventually became Ryrie Park. A cottage from Wilson's original homestead still remains at Ardstrath. Regional surveyor James Larmer retired to Braidwood and constructed a hotel at the northern end of Wallace Street that is still standing. Within the town are several particularly attractive streetscapes, including the Wallace Street vista up Jew's Hill, the Wallace Street vistas north and south, some of the side streets, in particular those that retain soft edging to their roadside verge, period buildings and attractive landscaping. A number of streetscapes frame vistas to the pastoral landscape beyond and this combination of historic streetscape in the foreground with pastoral landscape in the distance, particularly where this transition is abrupt, has been recognised in earlier studies as having high aesthetic value. Aesthetic views of the town include: the approach from Canberra, where the town is framed by a row of Poplars; the view from Thomas Braidwood Wilson's grave; the approach to the town on the Mongarlowe Rd from approximately \\"Mona Homestead\\"; the view from the Araluen Rd as it approaches the town, and the view from Mt Gillamatong. Some individual buildings in the town have aesthetic value, and images from the town that draw on the aesthetic values have appeared in a number of books, and have been used as the backdrop to several films. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Although not formally surveyed, it is assumed that there are strong social and community values held by various communities. It is reasonable to assume that these could include churches, the RSL/golf club, the cemetery, Mt Gillamatong, Dr Wilson's grave and the historic and aesthetic ambience and character of the town The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Because of Braidwood's integrity, setting and its evolution since European arrival, the area has considerable potential to assist an understanding of NSW's cultural history. The interplay between society, the individual and place since the early colonial period, can be discerned in the Braidwood landscape today. From early 19th century attitudes to health and well being, as exemplified by Dr Thomas Braidwood Wilson (Surgeon Superintendent with the Royal Navy) to the role and deployment of mounted police in the colony, the evolution of town planning or the impact of drought on mid 19th century rural growth (for example), Braidwood and setting provides an excellent field for study. Dennis Jeans discusses early settlement in his book Historical Geography of NSW and comments: the interaction of expanding enterprise with diverse environments and the problem of distance created a complex regional geography which influenced the form of the advancing frontiers long after 1830. In this period also the essential elements of an officially determined cultural landscape were beginning to form. Braidwood and setting provide an excellent example of Jeans' officially determined cultural landscape and may well prove a valuable benchmark for historical, geographical and other analysis. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Few towns from within the 19 counties retain the density of 19th century features found in Braidwood and its setting. Settlement within the Limits of Location benefited from the attention of the colonial administration through survey, town planning, police administration etc. Through the 19th century much of its immediate rural landscape was effectively \\"locked up\\" from subdivision, however its urban form was substantially reinforced by the local gold boom. Its distance from major transport networks and urban centres coupled with droughts and depression resulted in limited growth in the 20th century. As a town that displays a wealth of intact 19th century features, Braidwood stands out in comparison with most other regional centres. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Braidwood is an excellent example of a 19th-century rural town plan. The rectangular Georgian plan of 1839 sits well in its landscape and has not been split by subsequent rail or road realignments, or overlaid by more recent planning models or block amalgamations. It reflects a range of key planning determinants of the day including Governor Darling's approach to order, layout and block and road dimensions. The plan also reflects the importance of the judiciary and police system by inclusion of a substantial area for police horse paddocks, as befitted the centre of a police district. The evidence of the town's perimeter, and the abrupt transition between the town and surrounding pastoral area reinforces its significance.

The property is owned by Braidwood Historical Society. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The building was built in the 1840s as the original Royal Hotel. It was sold to the Grand United Order of Oddfellows for an Oddfellows Hall for ¬£700 in 1870. The Oddfellows renovated the building and added a staircase and upper and lower halls. It was again sold to the Commercial Hotel (now the Braidwood Hotel) in 1937, and converted into basic flats during a housing shortage in World War II. It was subsequently vacant and increasingly derelict from the end of World War II until being bought by the Braidwood Historical Society in 1970. The historical society painstakingly renovated the building room by room with local fundraising over subsequent years until receiving a $30,000 bicentennial grant in the 1980s. It now operates as the Braidwood Museum.  Description  The building is a two-storey masonry commercial building constructed in several phases over the latter nineteenth century. The street facade is constructed of coursed granite blocks with shaped flat arches over the openings. A stucco cornice and parapet demonstrates the part of the wall that was above the location and profile of the former two-storey veranda that had a bull nose roof. The windows are twelve-pane sliding sashes. There are doorways at both levels, including french doors from the first floor, indicating the original veranda. The side and rear walls are constructed of uncoursed rubble granite. The roofing is recent galvanised corrugated steel, with a box gutter behind the street parapet. The interior retains several fine timber Georgian mantelpieces, skirtings, shellac cedar architraves and deep window sills. The floor boards are comparatively wide and appear to be original. The original central staircase appears to be largely original with Georgian styling. This stair hall also has marbling on the wall plaster and early twentieth-century wall paper. The remnants of some original cornices remain, although the plaster quad cornices are recent. The Oddfellows Society added a tower in Victorian Free Classical style, a stair hall to the south, and western wind containing large assembly rooms on each of two levels from the 1880s. The extensions were constructed of brick laid in English bond, and rendered on the front elevation. The southern timber stair added by the Odd Fellows in the late Victorian period. A skylight typical of 1890s windows is placed in the ceiling above. The assembly rooms retain their original butt jointed floor boards and Victorian joinery of twelve-paned sash windows and panel doors. The upper assembly room has a barrel-vaulted ceiling with original struck cornices and ceiling roses. The cantilevered beams supporting a former veranda on the north side of the upper assembly room remain, but the remaining fabric was removed for a timber-framed extension to the upper level only. The original kitchen wing is constructed from rubble granite with sandstone sills and lintels, and a brick chimney.

The band included Damon McMahon (who later went on to form Amen Dunes). Critical reception Devon Powers of PopMatters said that the music was not easy listening: \\"the threads among and even within tracks weave an intricate tapestry of genres, influences, and subject matter. The risks they take give their songs a heroic tenor in a literal and figurative sense. Figurative because melodies are cast as brave charges over difficult terrain, and literal because thankfully, they defy categorization and, thankfully, it not only works but it also matters.\\" NMEs Simon Hayes Budgen described the band as \\"sounding like an offspring of the Go-Betweens and Talking Heads\\" and that \\"professionalism doesn't always have to mean workmanlike\\".

The album can meander, so it might not grab those in need of an immediate hooky fix. But as an album of dusty and dark, delicate and dramatic themes, No Danger is a force.\\" Uncut said that the album initially sounded like \\"a hilariously overcooked stew of wildly incompatible ingredients.

It is part of the Methow Mountains which is a sub-range of the North Cascades. Snagtooth Ridge is situated between Silver Star Mountain and Kangaroo Ridge on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. Big Snagtooth, at 8,330 feet elevation, is the highest point on Snagtooth Ridge. Other named spires include Willow Tooth, Cedar Tooth, Decayed Tooth, Red Tooth, Dog Tooth, Grey Tooth, Split Tooth, Cleft Tooth, Silver Tooth, and Last Tooth. The first ascent of Big Snagtooth was made September 29, 1946, by Fred Beckey, Jerry O'Neil, and Charles Welsh.http://www.rhinoclimbs.com/WA100HighestFAChronology.htm Precipitation runoff from the ridge drains into tributaries of the Methow River. Climate Weather fronts originating in the Pacific Ocean travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It was built from 1872. The complex also includes three adjoining shops and the stables. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The hotel was built 1872. The Albion Hotel was reported to have been Braidwood's \\"leading hotel\\" and to have held \\"grand and boisterous parties\\" in its heyday. It was also a stop on the Cobb and Co route. In 1884, the building's new verandah was swept away by a tornado. The adjoining shops were built in the 1920s. By the 1930s, the hotel was struggling and had become dated. It had no septic system or hot water service, unlike its competition, and its final licensee suggested that \\"there was very little call for second-class accommodation\\". It was reported that the hotel accommodation was full only about twice a year and \\"very infrequently\\" more than half full. The hotel closed in April 1933, when the licensee surrendered the license after being unable to afford ¬£1600 in repairs that had been ordered by the Licensee Court two and a half years prior. On the last day of trading, Saturday 29 April, the hotel was reported to have \\"gone out in a blaze of glory\\", with large crowds turning out to farewell the venue and free drinks for the last half hour. The licensee subsequently took over the lease of the Royal Hotel. It was converted to a general store during the 1940s. In the early 1950s, the verandah posts were removed and replaced with a cantilevered awning, but the posts were shortly reinstated after issues with the awning. The reinstated posts were declared a \\"traffic hazard\\" in the 1960s, resulting in a community campaign to save the building's verandah. It was restored in the early 1980s with a $40,000 heritage grant towards the facade and verandahs, and converted into seven retail shops and five apartments. The Albion Cafe now operates out of the former hotel premises. The former hotel featured in the films The Year My Voice Broke and Ned Kelly.  Description  ;Hotel ( 1872) Two-storey rendered brickwork hotel with two- storey timber veranda facing Wallace Street, Braidwood's main street, and Duncan Street, a side street. The corner splay parapet is decorated in stucco with urns, volutes and \\"ALBION HOTEL\\". The external masonry is otherwise undecorated. The two-storied veranda appears to be a partial reconstruction. The columns and beams are stop chamfered in a traditional Victorian manner. The balustrading is also timber in an \\"X\\" pattern. The chimney and many openings appear to be original. The interior contains original mantelpieces and timber architraves. Windows and doors with rippled glass appear to have been replaced in the 1920s. Several internal walls were removed from the ground floor bar area - the remaining structure is supported on steel beams and a column. The ground floor has an operating cafe and other shops. The first floor has three residential flats. A fourth residential flat is on the ground floor behind the street front. The hotel roof is corrugated metal.SOHI, 2015, 1 ;Shops ( 1920s) Three brick shops of two storeys facing Wallace Street are in Federation style are linked to the hotel by a first floor timber walkway. These shops are typical of construction. The shopfronts are original to this period. They have single-storey verandas of timber framing on concrete bases and fibre cement valences. Inside, the shops retain some pressed metal ceilings, cornices and rendered brick wall surfaces. The first floor above the shops has two residential flats. ;Stables A sandstock brick stables with gabled hay loft faces the side Duncan Street boundary. It is typical of s stables. It was constructed on a rubble granite base. The softer bricks have deteriorated somewhat. The windows and doors appear to be original. Windows have flat arch brickwork with bricks rubbed to fit.

History  The library is named after the local 18th-century polymath and author, Girolamo Tartarotti (1706 ‚Äì 1761). His will left his library to the local Charity Hospital, in hopes of becoming the start of a communal collection. A few years later, in 1764, the city purchased the collection, and created a public library, with the help of the local academic society (l'Accademia degli Agiati). Enlarging the collections over the years, in 1852, the library was moved from small quarters in the town center at vicolo San Giuseppe, to the Palazzo Piamarta across the Corso Bettini from the Palazzo Annona. In 1921, they were moved to the Palazzo Annona. Now the facilities mainly occupy space within the large cultural complex behind the palace. The main reading room was located in the ground floor of the Palazzo Annona. From 1997 until 2002, the Cultural Center of Rovereto was built; known as the MART, it comprises the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Rovereto (MART), the Melotti Auditorium, and the library. The building was designed by Mario Botta. Restoration of the adjacent Palazzo Annona was completed in 2007.

It was formerly known as the Mill Centre. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The corner building (198-200 Wallace Street) was built in 1839 as a shop for Hendricks & Jacobs, who operated the Old Post Office Stores. A verandah was later removed. A garage extension to the south was built in 1929. 19 McKellar Street was built as two shops known as the Albert Buildings in 1859. It was converted to a steam- driven flour mill in the 1860s. It was later used as a store.  Description  The Mill Complex consists of several buildings of heritage interest. A two- storey commercial building in Victorian Georgian style extends along the Wallace Street frontage. It has a single-storey timber-framed veranda and ogee profiles roof. The columns are flat profile of Tuscan. The windows are twelve- pane sliding ash windows with implied flat arch elements articulated above each opening in the stucco. The ground floor street-facing windows are larger, as befitted a late Georgian period shop. The veranda flooring is paved with sandstone flagstones. The corrugated steel roof is hipped with a valley in between two shops. The interior has possibly original wide floor boards, butt jointed. Some original shellac timber joinery remains such as architraves. The \\"old post office cottage\\" is a single-storey building constructed of bagged brick work and corrugated steel roofing with two parallel gables facing McKellar Street. The windows appear to be taken from other buildings and each is typical of a different decade 1860s - 1920s. The western facade has been altered to suit a dwelling use. A mill building is on the adjacent site facing McKellar Street. It is a two-storey rectangular prism with a hip roof of short length corrugated steel sheets. The walls are load-bearing rubble granite laid in bands as a form of coursing. The first floor has a series of twelve-paned timber sash windows. The ground floor north elevation has been changed several times, apparently soon after construction. Large archways on either side of the north elevation were filled in, and the windows added later. Several small doorways at the middle have been filled in and a later opening with a hardwood lintel was inserted. Apparently the large archways caused the building to become unstable, because a large buttressing mass of granite was constructed alongside the eastern wall. The east and west wall have no openings. The interior is one space with apparent remains of heavy timber galleries constructed to access the higher parts of the milling machinery. The building was used as a function centre in the early twenty-first century.  Heritage listing  Mill Centre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

From her research and teaching, Timby writes on the cultural history of photography as a technology.  Education  Timby's research draws on her learning, and combines her interests, in anthropology, history and photography. Her early experience of the medium was through her maternal grandmother, who had a darkroom and was active in her local photo club and showed her how to print in the darkroom. Her first camera was a high school graduation gift. Timby was educated at the private Connecticut College, New London, where as an Anthropology undergraduate she undertook a minor subject studio arts, studying photography and making photographs in the vintage processes of cyanotype and gum printing. From there she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Social Anthropology in 1992 before completing an M.A. in that discipline in 1996 at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales, France, and from 2002‚Äì2006 undertook her PhD at the same Paris institution.  Career  Timby's Master's thesis was \\"La photographie et l'ethnologie de la France. Modes d'emploi et apports de l'image\\" (‚ÄòPhotography and the ethnology of France. Uses and contributions of the image‚Äô) dealing with the usefulness of photography to museums of French ethnography and how photography was employed by anthropologists in their field work and publications in studying French culture or as object of study in its own right. This research shifted her interest from traditional anthropology toward history, taking her into the history of photography, where her anthropology guides her consideration of its cultural impact. Timby's research subsequent to her master's degree and her interest in photographic technologies and their social utility and impact stem also from her work as a curator. From 1996 to 2001 she was employed in that role at the Mus√©e Carnavalet, the museum of the history of Paris, a city so closely associated with the progress of photography from its invention. There she prepared exhibitions including \\"Paris in 3D: from Stereoscopy to Virtual Reality, 1850-2000‚Äù, an exercise in configuring rigorous academic archival research for general consumption. Timby had first become interested in stereography when working with the photography historian Peter Palmquist for a month in the early 1990s as an undergraduate in the US. His study of original photographs and primary source materials to uncover overlooked aspects of the history of photography chimed with her background in anthropology and as an historian. Palmquist took her to an antique shop in Arcata (California) where he lived, and there she bought her first stereo view. Timby was able to find temporary work that engaged her interest in photography and anthropology at the Mus√©e de l‚ÄôHomme photography department and Mus√©e Carnavalet specialising in the history of Paris. In 1996 she began co-curating a 3D exhibition at the Carnavalet museum, and the resultant display opened in Paris in October 2000 and closed January 2001. The exhibition and catalogue in English and in French ( ‚ÄúParis en 3D: de la st√©r√©oscopie √† la r√©alit√© virtuelle, 1850-2000‚Äù) in hardbound editions, appealed to a diverse audience who, using the different stereo viewers enclosed in the book, could enjoy hundreds of images, stereo pairs, anaglyphs, lenticular images and holograms, of Parisian life from the early nineteenth century to the present. Timby contributed text that one reviewerRulien, Diane E. \\"Paris in 3D: From the Stereoscope to Virtual Reality 1850-2000.\\" PSA Journal, vol. 67, no. 3, 2001, p. 8. called an ‚Äòhistorical roadmap of the techniques leading to the development of 3D photography from stereocards, anaglyphs, and holograms to 3D computer imagery and virtual reality‚Äô. The book and exhibition were of ‚Äòlandmark‚Äô historical value, in the opinion of another reviewer,Britt Salvesen, Curator and Department Head of the Wallis Annenberg Photography Department, Prints and Drawings Department, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, ‚ÄòA Deep Look at Lenticulars‚Äô, in the National Stereoscopic Association (U.S.) journal Stereo world. Columbus, Ohio. March/April 2016. 18-19 with many of its pictures showing antique equipment and portraits of pioneers of stereoscopy and integrated biographical information and excerpts of treatises of prominent persons in stereoscopy. In the opinion of David Haberstich, the exhibition was ‚Äòdefinitive‚Äô in dealing with perception, art, and technology.‚ÄúThere will be other exhibitions dealing with stereoscopy and virtual reality, given the importance of the subject, but it is difficult to imagine anything similarly definitive and of comparable diversity and magnitude. If the exhibition 'Paris en 3D' was essentially about perception, art, and technology, rather than about documenting the history of a city, nevertheless its concentration on Paris provided a unique and rational focus. The catalogue serves as a permanent surrogate and constitutes a landmark study in this specialized area of the history of photography, with profound implications for future discourse about photographic vision.‚Äù David Haberstich (2001) in Book Reviews, History of Photography, 25:4, 392-396, DOI: 10.1080/03087298.2001.10443243 In 2001, with a training and research grant from the Ministry of Culture and Communication (photographic patrimony) for access to patents, and by the Carnavalet museum as part of her work on the exhibition \\"Paris in 3D: de stereoscopy to virtual reality, 1850-2000 \\", Timby published a 23-page academic paper on research into commercial, advertising, entertainment, and even medical and religious, applications of the lenticular image invention in France, and its technical development.Kim Timby, ‚ÄòImages en relief et images changeantes. La photographie √† r√©seau lign√©‚Äô, √âtudes photographiques, no. 9, May 2001, p. 124-147  Investigation into 3D and colour photography  When researching 3D imaging Timby found that colour was a major consideration, a thread that developed during her PhD on lenticular photography, begun after \\"Paris in 3D\\" closed and she had left Carnavalet. Her first published work on colour was the 2005 article \\"Colour Photography and Stereoscopy: Parallel Histories,\\" from which she developed the idea that colour, like 3D, was a constructed illusion; an ambition in common to the two technologies was the reproduction of an aspect of human perception through its deconstruction and reconstruction.‚ÄùKim Timby. ‚ÄòColour Photography and Stereoscopy: Parallel Histories‚Äô, History of Photography, vol. 29, n\\" 2. Summer 2005, p. 183-196. Also in 2005, before the completion in 2006 of her PhD at the Paris √âcole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), Timby was appointed Director of Collections at the Mus√©e Nic√©phore Ni√©pce in Chalon- sur-Sa√¥ne, France which houses the archive of devices and objects once belonging to the inventor of photography as well as nearly three million images from all photographic processes. There, her work included curating \\"Sous un beau ciel bleu: un si√®cle de couleurs et de photographie\\" (June 17‚ÄìOctober 1, 2006), augmenting the second strand of her research interests, colour photography, into the technological, aesthetic, and social history in which she has since pursued investigations alongside stereoscopy. Timby's other projects at the Mus√©e Nic√©phore Ni√©pce included designing and implementing new permanent exhibition spaces structured around a rotating series of mini-exhibits, thus continuing her informed engagement with a broad audience. Timby elaborates a cultural history of photography by examining human engagement with, and transformation of, its particular techniques and technologies, as she does with the photo-booth, precursor to the ‚Äòselfie- stick‚Äô, in her paper ‚ÄúPhotographies d‚Äôamiti√©. De l‚Äôusage collectif du photomaton,‚Äù (‚ÄòPhotographs of friendships: the collective use of the photo booth‚Äô). For the same purpose, she tracks the mid-century development of colour printing technologies for magazine photographs as a response to audiences‚Äô and advertisers‚Äô desire, and the adaptation of photographers, amateur and professional, to its availability and special demands.  Researching animated photography  In a move to alma mater √âcole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in 2009, and until 2012, Timby co-coordinated investigation in \\"La Cr√©ation Photographique\\", a research program in the history of photography funded by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche. During this period she published a chapter 'Le cin√©ma dans une seule photo' : le portrait anim√© des ann√©es 1910‚Äô, a contribution to a collection of essays on the crossover between cinema and the still image,Guido, L., & Lugon, O. (2010). Fixe-anim√©: Croisements de la photographie et du cin√©ma au XXe si√©cle. Paris: L'Age d'Homme. also reproduced as ‚ÄòCinema in a Single Photo: The Animated Screen Portrait of the 1910s‚Äô in an English edition.Guido, L., & Lugon, O. (2012). Between still and moving images: Photography and cinema in the 20th century. London: John Libbey Publishing. Her text first raises the way that lenticular animation, in novelty portraits and advertising, satisfied an expectation of progress toward ever more perceptual naturalism in photographic technologies, and this was expanded in the second chapter of her book 3D and Animated Lenticular Photography: Between Utopia and Entertainment, published in 2015. Response to the book was positive and recognised the value of Timby's contribution to the literature on lenticular imagery which in comparison to the history and analysis of other 3D technologies had received little attention.reviewed by Jan Baetens, Leonardo, October 2016 Britt Salvesen, ‚ÄòA Deep Look at Lenticulars‚Äô in the National Stereoscopic Association (U.S.) journal Stereo world.

Two teams play a single innings, which is restricted to a maximum of ten overs per side, with the game lasting 90 minutes. The first competition using this format took place in December 2017, the opening season of the T10 League in the United Arab Emirates. The International Cricket Council (ICC) officially sanctioned the league. In May 2020, Eoin Morgan, the captain of the England cricket team, supported the idea of using the format at the Olympics, with former international cricketers Virender Sehwag and Shahid Afridi also supporting the idea. T10 leagues Later the same month, Cricket West Indies announced that the first edition of the Vincy Premier T10 League would start on 22 May 2020 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Vanuatu T10 Blast started one day earlier in Port Vila. In June 2020, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced the commencement of the first edition of the PDC T10 League. A number of other minor T10 leagues have been started, such as the Cricket Fiji Vakataukata T10 League and the Malaysia T10 Bash. =Abu Dhabi T10 League= The T10 league is a T10 league played in the United Arab Emirates. It was approved by the ICC. The first edition was won by the Kerala Kings. While in the second the Pakhtoons were defeated by the Northern Warriors. In 2019 the Maratha Arabians beat the Deccan Gladiators to win the third edition. In 2020, the league hired former ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat in part to help globalize the T10 format. =Qatar T10 League= The Qatar T10 League was founded in Doha and has six teams. Shahid Afridi became the leagues brand ambassador. The league had 24 international cricket players, 12 players from associate countries and Qatar national cricket team players. In the first edition the falcon hunters were victorious beating the Swift Galopers. All of the matches were hosted at the Asian Town International Cricket Stadium Doha. In December 2019, the ICC opened an anti corruption investigation after fixers were caught. Criticism The following criticisms have been made against T10 cricket, all largely about the shortness of the format: * The shorter format has meant that some players have simply not been able to bat or bowl in some matches within the first few years of T10 matches being played. Such a thing has only occurred in Test cricket (when also excluding players who didn't take any catches) 14 times. * Bowlers have argued that they would have no role in the game, since they only can bowl a maximum of two overs. Others counter that bowlers have been able to perform in T10 matches. * The leagues themselves have been questioned for not adequately preparing for or setting up games. One instance where this was argued was when a T10 League match was abandoned due to the officials not having the DLS rules on hand, as well as when two games ended without any attempt at a tiebreaker such as a Super Over.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  Verbal advice states that the property was originally owned by Harry Jenner and Sons of Mayfield Tarago Pty Ltd. The present tenant advised that the original homestead was built in the 1860s and burnt down in 1932. The homestead dates from 1927. The original shearing shed, slab stables and slab dairy date from 1860s. Various other outbuildings date from 1920s. Archaeological remains at the site date as far back as the 1820s. Mayfield was acquired by the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board 1985 for the ill-fated Welcome Reef Dam project.  Description  The homestead is a weatherboard building, virtually in original condition. Brick rough cast piers with two solid timber posts support the original verandah beam. The roof is corrugated iron with iron guttering. The gable end to the main entry is battened with exposed rafters and sawn timber shingles in original condition. The front door is multipaned with Egyptian-type architraves which also surrounds original casement windows. Outbuildings are numerous, generally of timber and corrugated iron. A long drive leads to what could have been an earlier carriage loop surrounded by early plantings. Large, probably original pines denote the proximity of the homestead. Original 1920s weatherboard garages are located at the side of the homestead. Corrugated iron water tanks and also a fibreglass water tank provide water to the house. The estate is one of the largest in the area of the dam-site. An early slab hut is located adjacent to the original shearing shed, possibly to store farm equipment. There are two later cottages adjoining the shearing shed. A further weatherboard 1920's house is located adjacent to the original slab shed. Early tractor and shearing equipment is inside the shed. On a remote section of the property, granite ruins adjoin a dead tree. = Modifications and dates = Most items are in good condition with the exception of the shearing and slab sheds which are poor.  Heritage listing  On preliminary visual investigation, Mayfield has a medium level of cultural landscape significance, containing cultural components which evidence past land use practices. These include the original shearing shed and holding pens, the original slab shed, remnant farm machinery, and other elements within the rural landscape such as plough lines and stock circulation tracks. The present homestead is historically valuable as an integral and intact component of the farm building complex, which includes sheds and worker cottages. Potential archaeological remains have been identified, which include granite building relics and fences. Mayfield was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as aesthetically rare regionally. This item is assessed as historically rare statewide. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. This item is assessed as scientifically representative statewide.

The reliquary of Stupa No.2 presents has inscriptions in Brahmi mentioning the names of Buddhist monks also appearing in the reliquary of Sanchi Stupa No.2 and Andher Stupas: Kasapagota, Majjhima, Kosikiputa, Gotiputa, and Apagira.Huu Phuoc's Buddhist Architecture The p.148 It would seem, then, that the ashes of these monks were divided between these three stupas. The date of construction of Stupa 1 and Stupa 2 must therefore be equivalent to those of Sanchi Stupa No.2, i.e. 125-100 BCE. There are in all four groups of stupas surrounding Sanchi within a radius of twenty kilometers: Bhojpur and Andher to the southeast, Sonari to the southwest, and Satdhara in the west.Buddhist Circuit in Central India: Sanchi, Satdhara, Sonari, Andher, Travel ... p31 Further south, about 100 km away, is Saru Maru.

Alexander Cunningham and FC Maisey searched Sonari's Stupa No.2 in 1851. The stupa contained three miniature reliquaries, two in soapstone and one in rock crystal, as well as a certain amount of bone ash and a piece of wood. The main reliquary is shaped to resemble a lotus bud, with incised petals decorating the lower half of the reliquary. It was turned on a lathe and then carved in bas-relief with lotus petal strips on the shoulder and lower body, while on the upper body is a large area divided into eight rectangular compartments in each of which are an elephant, horse, deer or winged lion, patterns typical of the period of the Maurya Empire. These discoveries were published by A Cunningham in The Bhilsa Topes in 1854.Notice from Victoria and Albert Museum It had been customary since the death of the Buddha to preserve and venerate his relics. Under emperor Ashoka (around 268-233 BCE), converted to Buddhism and energetic protector of the faith, a series of stupas, mounds of relics, were erected throughout the empire, marking sites important in the life of the Buddha. This practice continued, and this container of relics was buried around 200 BCE. Relic deposits of this period usually represented original deposits of the relics of the Buddha.

Evolution has been an important theme in fiction, including speculative evolution in science fiction, since the late 19th century, though it began before Charles Darwin's time, and reflects progressionist and Lamarckist views as well as Darwin's. Darwinian evolution is pervasive in literature, whether taken optimistically in terms of how humanity may evolve towards perfection, or pessimistically in terms of the dire consequences of the interaction of human nature and the struggle for survival. Other themes include the replacement of humanity, either by other species or by intelligent machines. Context Charles Darwin's evolution by natural selection, as set out in his 1859 On the Origin of Species, is the dominant theory in modern biology, but it is accompanied as a philosophy and in fiction by two earlier evolutionary theories, progressionism (orthogenesis) and Lamarckism. Progressionism is the view that evolution is progress towards some goal of perfection, and that it is in some way directed towards that goal. Lamarckism, a philosophy that long predates Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, is the view that evolution is guided by the inheritance of characteristics acquired by use or disuse during an animal's lifetime. Progressionism Ideas of progress and evolution were popular, long before Darwinism, in the 18th century, leading to Nicolas-Edme R√©tif's allegorical 1781 story ' (The Southern Hemisphere Discovery by a Flying Man). The evolutionary biologist Kayla M. Hardwick quotes from the 2013 film Man of Steel, where the villain Faora states: \\"The fact that you possess a sense of morality, and we do not, gives us an evolutionary advantage. And if history has taught us anything, it is that evolution always wins.\\" She points out that the idea that evolution wins is progressionist, while (she argues) the idea that evolution gives evil an advantage over the moral and good, driving the creation of formidable monsters, is a popular science fiction misconception. Hardwick gives as examples of the evolution of \\"bad-guy traits\\" the Morlocks in H. G. Wells's 1895 The Time Machine, the bugs' caste system in Robert Heinlein's 1959 Starship Troopers, and the effective colonisation by Don Siegel's 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers aliens. Lamarckism In French 19th century literature, evolutionary fantasy was Lamarckian, as seen in Camille Flammarion's 1887 Lumen and his 1894 Omega: The Last Days of the World, J.-H. Rosny's 1887 Les Xip√©huz and his 1910 La mort de la terre, and Jules Verne's 1901 La grande for√™t, le village a√©rien. The philosopher Henri Bergson's creative evolution driven by the supposed √©lan vital likely inspired J. D. Beresford's English evolutionary fantasy, his 1911 The Hampdenshire Wonder. Darwinism Illustration for a 1906 edition of H. G. Wells's 1898 \\"The War of the Worlds\\" by Henrique Alvim Corr√©a Darwin's version of evolution has been widely explored in fiction, both in fantasies and in imaginative explorations of its grimmer \\"survival of the fittest\\" effects, with much attention focused on possible human evolution. H. G. Wells's The Time Machine already mentioned, his 1896 The Island of Dr Moreau, and his 1898 The War of the Worlds all pessimistically explore the possible dire consequences of the darker sides of human nature in the struggle for survival. More broadly, Joseph Conrad's 1899 Heart of Darkness and R. L. Stevenson's 1886 Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde portray Darwinian thinking in mainstream English literature. The evolutionary biologist J. B. S. Haldane wrote an optimistic tale, The Last Judgement, in the 1927 collection Possible Worlds. This influenced Olaf Stapledon's 1930 Last and First Men, which portrays the many species that evolved from humans in a billion-year timeframe. A different take on Darwinism is the idea, popular from the 1950s onwards, that humans will evolve more or less godlike mental capacity, as in Arthur C. Clarke's 1950 Childhood's End and Brian Aldiss's 1959 Galaxies Like Grains of Sand. Another science fiction theme is the replacement of humanity on Earth by other species or intelligent machines. For instance, Olof Johannesson's 1966 The Great Computer gives humans the role of enabling intelligent machines to evolve, while Kurt Vonnegut's 1985 Galapagos is one of several novels to depict a replacement species.

As of May 2019, 102 people were confirmed dead. The fires were the second-deadliest wildfire event in the 21st century, after the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Australia that killed 173. Over 700 residents were evacuated or rescued, mainly from the seaside settlements located north of the port town of Rafina, namely Kokkino Limanaki and Mati, where rescuers found 26 corpses trapped just metres away from the sea, apparently hugging each other as they died. Boats also recovered corpses from the water, and rescued hundreds of people from beaches and the sea. Ten people drowned when the boat rescuing them from a hotel in Mati capsized. Œúore than 4,000 residents were affected by the wildfires.https://www.dikaiologitika.gr/eidhseis/koinonia/220691/stis-4-076-oi- aitiseis-pyroplikton-gia-to-epidoma Greece deployed its entire fleet of fire- fighting aircraft and more than 250 fire engines, as well as over 600 firefighters. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras declared a state of emergency in Attica, and announced a three-day period of national mourning, stating in a televised address, \\"The country is going through an unspeakable tragedy\\". After the fires, flags atop the Acropolis and the Greek parliament flew at half mast. The European flags at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels also flew at half mast in honour of the victims. Many countries worldwide helped or offered aid to Greece. A 65-year old man from Penteli has been arrested for causing the fire through negligence, by burning wood in his garden.https://greekcitytimes.com/2019/03/06/20-charged-over-mati-wildfires- that-killed-100-people/  Fires  The fire in Kineta and its aftermath The fire in Mati and its aftermath On 23 July 2018 at 13:00 Eastern European Time, a wildfire started west of Athens near Kineta. A few hours later, a second wildfire started burning at the north of Athens near Penteli. Due to very strong wind gusts in the area both wildfires spread quickly which were up to , 12 Beaufort. The fire in Kineta burned houses in the area, while the fire in Penteli headed east towards the beach, where it started burning parts of Neos Voutzas, Mati and Kokkino Limanaki just north of the town of Rafina and as far as its northern fringes. = Impact = The flames were so intense that they trapped and burned people inside their houses, cars, or a few metres away from the beach. Thousands of vehicles and houses were destroyed before the fire was brought under control hours later. An entire summer camp composed of 620 children was evacuated in an overnight operation. Many animals (wild and domestic) died or were injured due to the fire. The fires were the second- deadliest wildfire event to have occurred worldwide since 2001, after the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Australia that killed 180. In addition, the wildfires were also the sixth-deadliest to have occurred in the one-hundred years prior to the event. Only the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009, the Black Dragon Fire of 1987, the Indonesian forest fires of 1997, the Cloquet Fire of 1918, and the Kursha-2 Fire of 1936 had a higher death toll. Casualties As of May 2019, 102 people were confirmed dead; the victims were identified as 48 females, 43 males, 11 children (one of whom an infant). The youngest was 6 month and the oldest 93 years old. The casualties were 97 Greeks, two Polish, an Irish, a Belgian and a Georgian nationals. At least 164 adults and 23 children were taken to hospital with injuries, including 11 adults in serious condition. It was also reported that at least 15 of the injured later died in the hospital.  Cause  On 26 July 2018, the Mayor of Penteli, Dimitris Stergiou, supported that the deadly fire that hit Mati in eastern Attica began from a damaged cable at a utility pole. In a press conference held on 26 July, Nikos Toskas, the Alternate Minister of Public Order and Citizen Protection, said that there are strong indications of arson, for the fires both in Kineta and Penteli. The defence minister Panos Kammenos said illegal constructions had exacerbated the situation.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44966121 The arson investigative department of the Hellenic Fire Service dismissed the arson theory on 27 July, stating the fire was probably started due to wood being burnt in Daou, Penteli. Kathimerini said the suspect's name was already known.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/28/greece-wildfires- firefighters-attack-government-response A video obtained from a home security camera by the newspaper, showed that a fire started in a clearing near houses in Daou at 4:41 p.m. and quickly spread due to the wind.http://www.ekathimerini.com/231880/article/ekathimerini/news/video- footage-shows-minutes-mati-fire-broke-out A 65-year old resident of the area was charged with manslaughter, causing criminal harm through negligence, negligent arson. He is suspected of causing the fire after burning wood in his garden.https://greekcitytimes.com/2019/03/06/20-charged-over-mati-wildfires- that-killed-100-people  Reconstruction  Rafina, Mati and Neos Voutzas in August 2018 The Mayor of Athens Giorgios Kaminis has been in constant communication with the local authorities of the municipalities affected by the wildfires. The City of Athens will commission a study to research and proposed an actionable and resilient reforestation plan, as well as collect funding through the Athens Partnership for those impacted. During reconstruction and rescue around the wildfires Greek citizens, businesses and organizations banded together to aid one another. Businesses handed out free food and water to victims and first responders, organizations such as the Hellenic Center for Disease Prevention and Control launched donation drives, and citizens opened their homes for those impacted, both independently and through Airbnb. =International assistance= Greece appealed for help from other countries to help tackle the fires and deal with the emergency situation by submitting a request through the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism for international assistance with air and land assets. European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management arrived in Athens on 24 July to coordinate the EU assistance being provided to Greece through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The EU Civil Protection Mechanism, helped mobilize planes, vehicles, medical personnel and firefighters from the EU countries. The EU‚Äôs Copernicus satellite system has also been activated to provide the authorities with highly specialized maps. The Greek minister Nikos Toskas said never before have there been so many offers to assist firefighting efforts, lauding the solidarity other countries have shown. The following countries responded: * ‚Äì in financial aid to deal with the emergency situation. * ‚Äì Offered assistance if needed. ‚Äì Offered assistance if needed.  ‚Äì Two Canadair CL-415 water-tanker planes. * ‚Äì Fire engines, personnel and in financial aid.  ‚Äì Two Canadair CL-415 water-tanker planes.  ‚Äì 6,000,000 denars (about ) in financial aid in dealing with the emergency situation.  ‚Äì Two teams of the State Fire Service were provided to support the rescue and fire-fighting operation. * ‚Äì Portugal has offered the assistance of 50 firefighters, in the scope of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. * ‚Äì A C-27 J Spartan airplane configured for firefighting and a C-130 Hercules aircraft for logistic support, as well as a total of 20 soldiers.  ‚Äì Two Canadair CL-415 water-tanker planes.  ‚Äì Surveillance of the wildfires with drones, to help spot and fight fires more quickly.

It is part of the Methow Mountains which is a sub-range of the North Cascades. Vasiliki Ridge is situated north of Silver Star Mountain on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The name Vasiliki was recommended by climber Fred Beckey who made the first ascent in 1952. Vasiliki Ridge can be seen from Washington Pass and from the North Cascades Highway. Vasiliki Ridge summit, at 8,190 feet elevation, is the highest point on Vasiliki Ridge. Named granite spires include Charon Tower, The Acropolis, Ares Tower, Vasiliki Tower, Juno-Jupiter Towers, Aphrodite Tower, and Baccus Tower. Precipitation runoff from the ridge drains into Early Winters Creek which is a tributary of the Methow River. Climate Weather fronts originating in the Pacific Ocean travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. Vasiliki Ridge is carved mostly from granite of the Golden Horn batholith. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Her father, William Barlow, is believed to have been a soldier, although Maud described him as a retired civil servant on her marriage certificate.Marriage of Maud Barlow and Samuel Harris, 15 January 1910, Fulham Register Office. She made her stage debut in 1898 as a chorus girl at the Theatre Royal, Belfast. Initially calling herself Maud Laverne, she first used the stage-name Ida Barr in 1908 at London's Bedford Theatre. Barr married comedian Samuel 'Gus' Harris (billed as \\"the only Yiddisher Scotsman in the Irish Fusiliers\\"), but the marriage failed within a few years,Gus Harris petitioned for divorce from Maud in 1913, on the grounds of her adultery with one Budd Jupiter. He was granted a decree nice in 1914 (The National Archives, J77/1136/4496). with Maud soon sailing to New York. Achieving some success in America, Barr returned to England a premier singer of ragtime songs, popularising in Britain the songs \\"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\\" (Ayer & Brown; 1910) and \\"Everybody's Doing It\\" (Berlin; 1911). She toured worldwide, earning good money, but was over-generous and failed to save. She became in her old age reliant on welfare benefits, living in a small flat off the Charing Cross Road in London. Writer and broadcaster Daniel Farson, a music hall enthusiast, took it upon himself to extend a helping hand, bringing Barr to a new (or nostalgic) audience on record and television.

Biography Daniel Fernandez was born on October 25, 1957, in de Sants neighbourhood of Barcelona. His family was of Andalusian Protestant descendant, and when the boy turned 6 years old, Daniel's parents moved to France and settled in Lyon. Later, Daniel returned to his native Spain and studied philology in Barcelona. His first record Le Bonheur Comptant was released in 1981, but remained unnoticed (now it does not even enter into the official discography). After this, Daniel took up a variety of humble jobs to support himself, all the while singing in front of small audiences and eventually adopting the pseudonym Nilda, rearranging the letters in his name. In 1987, Nilda records Madrid, Madrid, but the actual fame arrived a few years later, in 1991, with the release of an eponymous album containing 'Nos fiancailles', 'L'invitation √† Venise' and, again, 'Madrid Madrid'. Nilda receives 5 nominations to the prestigious french 'Victoires de la Musique' awards, and walks away as 'Best Male Promise' of the year. In the same year the singer also receives the Grand Prix de l'Acad√©mie Charles Cros. In 1993 Nilda releases another eponymous album, containing 'Marie-Madeleine', 'On t'a apprise' and 'Sinfanai Retu' which is well received. In 1995, Nilda released a novel titled √áa Repart Pour un Soliloque, written on behalf of a woman, which caused an endless flow of questions from journalists about his sexual orientation.Nilda Fernandez: La sexualit√© de quelqu'un n'est pas un secret, mais on ne se d√©finit pas que par la sexualit√© And later, during his collaboration with Russian pop singer Boris Moiseev, the artist was presented as gay.–®–∞–Ω—Å–æ–Ω—å–µ –ù–∏–ª—å–¥–∞ –§–µ—Ä–Ω–∞–Ω–¥–µc: –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –ú–æ–∏—Å–µ–µ–≤ –≤–∏–¥–µ–ª –≤–æ –º–Ω–µ —Å–æ–ø–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç —É –Ω–µ–≥–æ —á—Ç–æ-—Ç–æ —É–∫—Ä–∞—Å—Ç—å In 1999, with Castelar 704, he wrote poems by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca (1898‚Äì1936), with Spanish guitarists, among them Tomatito, following Paco Ib√°√±ez.

It was designed by Kenneth Mackenzie and built in 1886 by Kenneth Mackenzie. The property is owned by the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Meroogal was constructed in 1886 for occupation by Mrs Jessie Catherine Thorburn, a widow, and her four unmarried daughters. It was a modest building in comparison to the grand late 19th century houses in Sydney, but quite grand compared to other residences in Nowra. The only properties of significantly greater value were banks and hotels. Finance for the project was provided by her eldest son, Robert Taylor Thorburn. He appears to have had the available funds due to his partnership in a goldmine at Yalwal, 26 kilometres south west of Nowra. Her brother Kenneth Mackenzie designed the house. Kenneth Mackenzie probably built or at least supervised Meroogal's construction as well, as he had designed and built several buildings at Cambewarra, eight kilometres north west of Nowra. The house stood on an original allotment of just over one hectare.HHT, Spring 2005 The impetus for building Meroogal appears to have been the marriage of Robert Taylor Thorburn and the family's desire to move to town for business and social reasons. Thorburn married Jessie Billis in 1885 and bought the land for Meroogal in September that year. When Meroogal was completed in May 1886 the family moved from their property, Barr Hill, to Nowra. Jessie Catherine and her daughters went to Meroogal and Thorburn and his wife went to another house in Nowra. Barr Hill was let to a share farmer. Between 1886 and 1900 the occupants of the house temporarily changed. However, by 1900 the occupants were the same as those who had moved in originally, Jessie Catherine and her four daughters - Annabella Jane (Miss Belle), Georgina Isabella (Miss Georgie), Jessie Catherine (Miss Kate) and Fanny Kennina (Miss Tottie). In 1914 a substantial portion of what was then Lot 5 was resumed to provide an additional water reservoir for Nowra. This was the first of several lots to be sold, transforming the original 5 acre property to what is now far less than half the size. The majority of original Meroogal land has now been developed for urban use. In 1916 Jessie Catherine died. In the same year her second daughter Mary Susan Macgregor and her husband came to live in Kintore, the cottage built for their retirement on Meroogal land. The two families associated daily and ate together regularly. The site of the cottage built in 1916 is vacant following a fire which destroyed it in the mid 1970s. Between 1916 and 1939 numerous family members and other visitors came to stay at Meroogal, some for lengthy periods of time. During this period two of the original four sisters died and Mary Macgregor moved into Meroogal, leasing Kintore to tenants. When Miss Kate died in 1940 the remaining sister, Miss Tottie went to live with relatives and did not return to Meroogal. This left Helen Macgregor, Mary Macgregor's daughter who had moved to Meroogal in 1930, as the principal occupant from 1945 until 1969. Her sisters were regular visitors. Her sister Elgin came to live there in 1971 and remained there until 1977. In the mid-1920s the Thorburn sisters maintained the ordered household regime developed in the 19th century, with tasks divided between them. The Thorburns and Macgregors all led active social lives through their family and friends and their activities with local organisations. Yet despite the mixing of Thorburns and Macgregors and the generations, there were differences between them and these are remembered by the living members of the families. The personalities and interests of the women who occupied and ran Meroogal are evident in these recollections, the fabric of the building and changes to it, the furniture and contents of the house and the remaining personal belongings. These include diaries, scrap books, work books and other items. From the late 1940s there has been a succession of tenants sharing the house with the Macgregors, with the two rear bedrooms used by the tenants. The sequence and nature of this is unclear. Between 1941 and 1959 the original one hectare allotment was subdivided, losing parts of the garden. The flower garden and back yard were retained. From 1978 until mid-1985 Meroogal was used by June Wallace, Mary Macgregor's granddaughter, her children and some other Macgregor descendants as a holiday house. The property is now owned by the NSW Government's Historic Houses Trust and open to the public on appointed days as a house museum.  Description  Meroogal is a late Victorian, two-storey weatherboard cottage with verandahs and balconies on two similar street frontages and includes a servants' wing. The walls are weatherboard on stone foundations and the roof of corrugated iron. Internally the floors are original hardwood and the joinery cedar. The building features elaborate bargeboards, cast-iron balustrades on timber verandahs and balconies, arched window sashes and french doors and dormer windows in two sides. The internal walls are wallpapered, the ceilings panelled, doors four panelled and the staircase is cedar. The joinery throughout is painted and the fireplaces and mantels are cast iron. Upstairs there are lining boards on the walls and ceiling and four bedrooms, two with timber balconies and cast-iron fireplaces. The servants' wing consists of three rooms and a verandah and is connected to the kitchen by a short, covered way. The house is surrounded by a picket fence with gates on each street front. Shaded by two large jacaranda trees (Jacaranda mimosifolia), Meroogal's garden layout is edged with glazed border tiles.Brown 1977 It was reported to be in good physical condition as of 17 September 1997. ;The Contents The contents of Meroogal embody many family ties and associations together with unconscious and self-conscious decisions to dispose of some possessions and keep others. Although the furniture has changed substantially, the rooms retain the flavour of Victorian period decoration, particularly in relation to paintings, pictures and photographs. The contents and furnishings include items from each generation of occupants and include items originally brought from Barr Hill. Between 1946 and 1977 many pieces of furniture and other contents were sold or given away. It is also likely that when Kintore was let to tenants in 1948 some of the valued furniture and contents were moved to Meroogal and elsewhere. When the cottage was sold in 1959 the remaining furniture was brought to Meroogal and/or sold. It is the most intact collection of Victorian period furniture, and other related house contents known in an urban area in NSW.Walker 1986: 36 ;The Garden The house stood on an original allotment of just over one hectare. The garden was a source of pride to the Thorburns and the Macgregors, the latter winning a prize in the Sydney Morning Herald garden Competition in the 1960s. A remnant of the 1920s orchard fence and gate remains.Walker 1986:7-27 Between 1941 and 1959 the original one hectare allotment was subdivided, losing parts of the garden. The flower garden and back yard were retained. Since HHT acquisition, it was decided to restore the garden to its appearance in the late 1920s, which was largely unchanged from its original form. The fences and flowerbeds have been reconstructed and a host of perennial and annual plants have been re-introduced into the garden. In spring roses mix with Iris, stocks, larkspurs and love-in-a-mist (Nigella damascena) in the beds. White blossoms on the Damson plum trees (for jam), old \\"California Crown\\" apple and \\"Williams\\" pear, and later purple jacarandas make a great show in the garden.

The property, together with associated documents and the recollections of people associated with it, provides a remarkable opportunity to understand and demonstrate aspects of the relationships between a family and its individual members and their material culture. The primary significance of Meroogal is as an artefact of history and its evidence of the lives of four generations of one family who lived in the house, their history and its evidence of taste and circumstances.Walker 1986: 36, Watts 1987 Meroogal was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Meroogal is historically significant for its evidence of 19th century Nowra and association with several prominent families in the districtWalker 1986:36 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Meroogal is aesthetically significant for its substantial contribution to the townscape of Nowra and its skilful design demonstrating the adaption of ideas from America. Walker 1986:36, Watts 1987 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Meroogal is significant for its evidence of, and ability to demonstrate, the life and role of women in the late 19th and the 29th century, its potential to demonstrate aspects of domestic and family life in the period from it construction to 1956 and its evidence of a substantial town house with ancillary uses. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Meroogal is a rare example of the continuance and adaption of Victorian taste within a house of the same period.

It was released on July 24, 2017. Gameplay The game is divided into seven chapters, spanning over 700,000 words across all routes, and in each chapter the player takes control of one of the protagonists. The game is primarily told in visual novel format, where the player's decisions affect the relationships with the other characters and the different paths that can be taken. Depending on the choices, the player can reach different endings. The game features full English voice acting and some quick-time events that can also be disabled. A branching tree helps to keep track of the progress, while an in-game journal narrates the events in chronological order. Plot The Ermengarde Mansion, a 17th-century English mansion, is rumored to be cursed by a vengeful spirit. Various disappearances had been linked to the mansion, while people living near the vicinity spoke of seeing and hearing unearthly things. Dismissed as a hoax, the mansion was listed for sale by Briar Realty Corporation. Before its grand opening to the public, Isabella Santos, an agent under BRC, was double-checking the place when she accidentally uncovered a disturbing letter, setting a series of horrible events into motion. Development The game was inspired by Japanese horror films Ju-on: The Grudge and The Ring, the Korean webcomic, Bongcheon-Dong Ghost, and by horror Japanese role-playing games such as Mad Father and Corpse Party. It was funded via Kickstarter with $33.946 from 518 backers, surpassing the funding goal of $30.000. A free spin-off titled The Diary was released in February 2016 for Android and later iOS. The game is a prequel and contains diary entries from Rebecca Gales, one of the protagonists of The Letter. Several voice actors worked on this game, including Amanda Lee as Isabella Santos, who also sings the theme song \\"Letters Goodbye\\", Melissa Sternenberg as Rebecca Gales, Howard Wang as Ashton Frey, Anthony Sardinha as Zachary Steele, Amber Lee Connors as Hannah Wright, Curtis Arnott as Luke Wright, and Elsie Lovelock as Marianne McCollough. Reception The game received mixed to positive reviews. Chloe Spencer from Kotaku said, \\"Despite some of its issues, the replay value and the excellent animations and artwork make it a fun experience.\\" Jarren Navarrete from Sirus Gaming gave a rating of 9 out of 10, calling the game \\"a must have experience for horror fans alike.\\" Lori May from Bonus Stage gave a rating of 6 out of 10, saying \\"Diehard fans of Visual Novels and/or Japanese anime style titles might find this one worth their time, especially if they enjoy mild Horror themes.\\" Jonathan Kevin Castillo from GameGulp gave the rating \\"lukewarm\\" and said, \\"It's a brave effort for YangYang Mobile to craft a game like this.

It was designed by James Barnet and built from 1890 to 1891 by Antonio and Peter Ettinghausen. The property is owned by Shoalhaven City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 July 2005.  History  The land for the Berry Courthouse was offered as a gift by David Berry sometime prior to July 1889. The offer was conditional on a signed agreement that the building would be of a scale considered appropriate by Berry. The Department of Justice considered Berry's ideas be too grand and the donation of land was delayed. Just before he died in 1889 Berry finally signed the deed of conveyance transferring ownership of the land to the Government of New South Wales. By July 1889 an amount of ¬£1500 had been approved for the new courthouse and the paperwork forwarded to the NSW Public Works Department. The courthouse design has been attributed to James Barnet, who was Colonial Architect in 1889, but no original drawings can be located. The courthouse appears to have been built in the centre of the site, as were most of Barnet's designs \\"isolated from surrounding buildings and well set back with plenty of grounds and with landscaping to match.\\" Tenders for the construction of the courthouse were invited and advertised in the Government Gazette on 21 March 1890. On 17 June 1890 the tender (¬£1,593/10/00) of A & P Ettinghausen was accepted. Antonio and Peter Ettinghausen were local tradesmen and Peter was also the local undertaker, so it is quite possible that he was the partner responsible for the fine cedar fittings and woodwork. Progress of the building was recorded in The Shoalhaven News of 15 August 1891: :\\"The new courthouse, erected by townsman Ettinghausen, will be ready for occupation in a few weeks time. The \\"agony\\" room is spacious, being 35 feet long, 26 feet wide most horrible-looking arrangement, in fact more uninviting than the one at Darlinghurst (Darlinghurst Courthouse). The cost of the building is near ¬£1700.\\" The building was completed in 1891 at a cost of ¬£1,658/10/7 and was one of 25 new government buildings erected during that year. The courthouse was also used for civic occasions such as the Governor's reception by the Berry Agricultural and Horticultural Society in 1893. The Governor, Lord Jersey was welcomed to Berry at the Courthouse before proceeding to the showground for the official 1893 Agricultural Society Show opening ceremony. In 1894 the Courthouse Gardens were further developed with 54 trees (unspecified species) and 48 shrubs, issued by the Royal Botanical Gardens to be planted in the Berry Courthouse grounds in August 1894. Apparently the area around the Courthouse was fenced sometime after March 1896. A new judges' bench and canopy were installed . The Court of Petty Sessions in Berry was abolished on 30 July 1988. The back rooms of the courthouse were then used as a police station until 1994. On 24 September 1994 Elders Real Estate at Berry auctioned the courthouse on behalf of the Department of Courts Administration (Justice Department). Prior to the auction the Department of Justice removed most of the internal moveable cedar fittings, including the jury box, seating and railings. Anthony A. Graham purchased the courthouse on 24 February 1995. Sometime between February 1995 and July 1999 some of the remaining cedar fittings were removed from the interior of the courthouse to give more access to floor space. The courthouse was purchased by the Shoalhaven City Council four years later on 14 July 1999. The purchase of the property by the council was strongly influenced by an extensive community consultation program and lobbying by local Berry residents. The Berry Courthouse Conservation Committee Inc was formed after the purchase of the property, and leases the property from Shoalhaven City Council. The courthouse is now used as a venue for weddings and other functions.  Description  The courthouse is positioned in the centre of its block of land, isolated from surrounding buildings. It is well set back in its landscaped surrounds and is a simple, representative courthouse building constructed of local materials, rendered inside and out with fine cedar fittings in the Victorian Classical Academic style. Four classical columns of modified Doric form (without entasis) support the portico, which features a wrought iron railing of unusual design. The Royal Coat of Arms sits inside the expression of the pediment above three small rectangular clerestory windows which reflect the division of the facade into three bays. Simple overhung sash windows light the interior; four on either side and one on either side of the main entrance. A simple moulded stringcourse links the line of the portico/porch to the side walls and minor structures to the rear. Building materials used in the courthouse include the dressed sandstone detailing, brick chimney details and timber panelled doors and timber double hung on the exterior. Interior elements include the timber panel joinery details of the original building, original timber doors, architraves, and oval louvred vent. The building was reported to be in good to very good condition as at 20 January 2005. The building has been well maintained throughout its life as a courthouse, and restorative work completed in 2000‚Äì2001 included repair of slate entrance steps, removal of intrusive interior additions. The Berry Courthouse is also significant because of its survival, almost completely intact, over a period of more than a century. There is also recorded evidence of the fittings of a typical country courthouse.  Heritage listing  Berry Courthouse is of historic significance at a state level as it operated uninterrupted as a courthouse from 1891 to 1988 and as such reflects the early history of governance and law and order in the region and NSW. As well as its historic association with the Berry family, early colonial entrepreneurs and developers, it has added historic significance through its association with James Barnet. The Berry Courthouse was one of the last public buildings Barnet designed in his role as Colonial Architect. The courthouse is further associated with Walter Liberty Vernon, the next Government Architect, who supervised the construction of the building. The Berry courthouse gains its aesthetic significance as an example of a small scale rural courthouse designed in the Classical Academic style. Its fine, elegant design embodies Barnet's late 19th century concepts of courthouse architecture. Set in its distinctive landscape it is composed as an imposing and austere structure, a landmark for the township which announces its function as the centre of justice in the township. The courthouse retains evidence of the construction methods of the time many of which are no longer commonly practised, including the making of Royal Arms in NSW. This coupled with its value as an intact architectural example of the work of the great 19th century architect, James Barnet, also contribute to its value as a research resource.Phoenix 2000 and HO 2005 Berry Courthouse was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 July 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Berry Courthouse is historically significant as from 1891 to 1988 the courthouse was continuously used to deliver law and order in the Berry district. Established by public demand, this small rural courthouse reflects the early history and development of governance in the region and in NSW during the 19th and 20th Century. The courthouse is also historically significant as one of the last architectural designs completed by James Barnet in his role as Colonial Architect. The courthouse was completed in 1891, under the guidance of Walter Liberty Vernon, successor to James Barnet as Supervising Government Architect.) The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Berry Courthouse has a strong association with David Berry who donated the land for the purposes of constructing a much needed courthouse for the town in 1889. He was the brother of Alexander Berry who took up a land grant at Berry in 1822. First Alexander and later David made outstanding contributions to the commercial and civic development of the town and surrounding areas and to the development of NSW. The courthouse is also historically associated with James Barnet, Colonial Architect who designed the building, and Walter Liberty Verbnon who supervised its construction as the new Government Architect.) The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Berry courthouse is a small scale rural courthouse designed in the Classical Academic style by James Barnet. Its fine, elegant design embodies Barnet's late 19th century concepts of courthouse architecture. Much of its fabric represents a style of building and some methods of construction which are no longer utilised. The building set in its distinctive garden setting is a landmark in the township with important views to and from the site. It is constructed of rendered brick with sandstone detailing and a large Royal coat of arms in the pediment, and is composed as an imposing and austere structure. These qualities announce its function as the centre of justice in the township. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Berry Courthouse has had an ongoing special association with the people of Berry ever since it was established at the specific request of the townspeople in 1886. The building is still held in high esteem as demonstrated in the enthusiastic response of the community in ensuring the future of the building after its decommissioning as a courthouse and subsequent sale. The Berry Courthouse has been a prominent feature of the landscape of the Berry for over a century, provides the local community with permanent link with the past, and is significant to the past and present community's sense of place. This association contributes to its local heritage significance.Phoenix 2000 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The original Barnet building of the Berry Courthouse is a rare 19th century institutional building with most of the original 1891 building fabric intact. The original building fabric and configuration can be clearly and easily identified and the skills of designers and the tradesmen of the time are clearly evident. Much of the fabric of the courthouse building represents a style of building and some methods of construction which are no longer utilised, making the building a valuable research resource. There is also recorded evidence of the fittings of a typical country courthouse. The place has the potential to yield oral history information, archaeological and horticultural data as well as technical information. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As one of the last designs completed by Barnet in his role as Colonial Architect, the Berry courthouse demonstrates the synthesis of the skills and design abilities gathered over his 28 years in that role. Its construction having been supervised by the incoming Government architect, Vernon is also a rare example of the crossover of two very different approaches to the design of government buildings. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Berry Courthouse is a rare example of a small scale early rural courthouse designed by Barnet. It is a fine, elegant design, embodying the complex architectural ideas and processes of one of the most talented of the early Australian architects. Barnet's courthouses were variations on a type which was responsive to colonial hierarchy of the time. Two of his courthouses, Bathurst Courthouse and Goulburn Court House, are classics of the period. Similar in plan and form, both buildings have monumental entrance porticos and building features. The smaller country towns had humbler versions of the temple as courthouse as exemplified by the Berry Courthouse. Barnet's buildings will always remain as the landmarks and focal points of most country towns in New South Wales. It embodies the late 19th century concepts of courthouse designs by the Colonial Architect's office for the creation of major institutions within their design portfolio.

He was a Wellington city councillor, serving as deputy mayor between 1962 and 1965. He also served as president of the New Zealand Law Society from 1968 to 1971. Biography =Early life and career= Denis McGrath was born in Wellington on 17 June 1910, the eldest of three sons of lawyer John Joseph (Jack) McGrath and Caroline Margaret McGrath (n√©e Wilkinson). He suffered bouts of ill-health as a child, and was educated at St Patrick's College before attending Victoria University College, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1932. He then joined his father in a joint legal practice in 1933 under the firm name JJ & Denis McGrath. In 1944, he married Margaret Fraser and together had four children (including John McGrath). Following his father's death in 1946, McGrath carried on the firm alone for five years. In 1957, he was elected to the council of Wellington District Law Society and in 1966 he became its president. Two years later, he became president of the New Zealand Law Society upon the appointment of Denis Blundell as High Commissioners to the United Kingdom, serving a three-year term which included the centenary celebrations of the society in 1969. =Political career= McGrath served two separate terms as a Wellington city councillor. In 1947 he won a seat on the Council on a Citizens' Association ticket which he was to hold until 1956 when he did not seek re-election. In 1962 he made a comeback to local-body politics and spent two more terms on the council until he retired in 1968. He represented the city on the Council of Victoria University and in 1962 he was appointed to the office of deputy mayor. He was involved in a public selection controversy in 1965, where first- term councillor Matt Benney as chosen as the Citizens' nominee for the mayoralty by the association's executive, but Benney withdrew his nomination after it became evident that the majority of sitting Citizens' councillors instead favoured McGrath. However, McGrath refused to stand for the office of mayor and offered himself solely for the council. Benney was eventually acclaimed as the mayoral candidate, after which McGrath relented the role of deputy mayor to Benney as well. In early 1968 he announced his mayoralty candidacy for the Citizens' Association. However, in June 1968 his appointment as President of the New Zealand Law Society became incompatible with his both his candidature and council commitments and he withdrew from both the mayoral race and did not contest a council seat either in order to focus on his duties at the Law Society. He was also an active member of the National Party and was chairman of the Karori branch from 1961 to 1963. =Later life and death= Plaque for the Denis McGrath Bridge He was appointed by the government as the chair of three Committees of Enquiry. The first was in 1970 over industrial issues affecting Air New Zealand, the second in 1972 regarding equal pay for women, and the third in 1973 over a review of parliamentary salaries policy. McGrath was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1972 Queen's Birthday Honours, for very valuable services to the community. In 1978, the Wellington City Council finished construction of a pedestrian overbridge across the Wellington motorway (next to the Bolton Street Cemetery) which was named the Denis McGrath Bridge, in McGrath's honour. McGrath died at Wellington on 14 June 1986, survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters.

The five ways that the ROLI senses the player's interactions are: * Strike ‚Äì The way the player makes contact with the Seaboard (velocity) * Press ‚Äì Pressure applied to the Seaboard key after first making contact with it (aftertouch) * Glide ‚Äì Left and right movements from side to side on a Seaboard key sends pitch bend information (pitch bend) * Slide ‚Äì Vertical movements up and down the Seaboard key (brightness) * Lift ‚Äì The speed you take your fingers away from the Seaboard keys (release velocity) The unit supports wireless MIDI over bluetooth. ROLI reports that latency of the unit at 30ms using bluetooth and 24ms via USB cable. Sounds for the sound engine can be edited and created by using a ROLI software called Equator, which can be quite resource intensive. ROLI claims that it is the world‚Äôs first purpose-built, multidimensional soft synth. Equator's synth sounds are designed to make changes in sound based on the Seabord's five types of resonsiveness. Effects units in Equator include ring modulation, EQ, chorus, delay, reverb, bit crusher, and distortion. Seaboard is designed to work with non-Seaboard music software programs such as Ableton Live, GarageBand, and Native Instruments' Kontakt, among others. Models =BLOCK= A ROLI BLOCK plugged into two Lightpad BLOCK units and a RISE pad. BLOCK is the smallest, lightest-weight ROLI keyboard, with 24 mini keys. It is designed to be interconnectable with other RISE devices, using magnetic connectors. Multiple BLOCK keyboards can be connected together, or the BLOCK can be connected to the Lightpad BLOCK, a RISE pad controller intended for use playing beats, triggering Digital Audio Workstation loops, and controlling the BLOCK keyboards or effect units. The BLOCK keyboard is 282 mm (11 inches) wide, 24.7 mm (1 inch) high, and 141 mm (5.5 inches) deep. It weighs 650g (1.43 pounds) and has a ten hour battery life and a four hour charge time. It has a single USB-C port for MIDI out and providing power and it provides full MIDI compatibility over USB and Bluetooth LE. It has a 15 meter Bluetooth range and works only with Mac OSX. =RISE= RISE 25 and RISE 49 have 25 and 49 keys, respectively. They have black aluminium cases and soft rubbery key surfaces with no moving parts. Traditional MIDI controllers have keys and a selection of knobs or wheels to control other parameters such as pitch bends or volume. RISE keyboards do not have knobs or wheels as additional controls; instead, they have touch surfaces, such as an XY touchpad (with four direction arrows and a centre button) and touch faders (with no moving parts), and buttons for octave shift, a preset/synth patch browser, on/off, and a MIDI mode selector. The touch faders are used to control the press, glide, and slide parameters. With the touch faders set to their minimum level, the RISE keyboards become more like regular MIDI keyboards in their responsiveness, with the force (or gentleness) of the striking or pressing of the keys being the main factor. With the pitch glide set to minimum, a palm gliss on the white notes produces a piano-type sound, with the result being a rapid scale of distinct notes. With the glide fader set to higher positions, a palm gliss produces a true glissando, and moving between two notes while maintaining pressure creates a trombone-like microtonal pitch bend sound. With the touch faders increased towards their maximum, the RISE responds to other types of interaction beyond the initial striking of a note (or notes), so that aftertouch, movement from side to side, and movement up and down a key sending messages to the sound engine to modify the sound. As the faders have a range of positions, a variety of intermediate response effects are possible, such as having a small amount of pitch bend. A RISE 25 keyboard. To the left of the key surface are the buttons, faders, and touchpad. The RISE 49 is 834 mm (32.8 inches) wide, 23 mm (0.9 inches) high, and 210 mm (8.27 inches) deep. It weighs 4.2kg (9.26 pounds). The battery has an eight hour life and a three hour charge time. It has a 1/4\\" input for a sustain pedal, a USB-B port (for MIDI out and power) and a USB-A port (for charging peripherals). It provides full MIDI compatibility over USB and Bluetooth LE. All the white markings light up with white when the RISE is powered and the control buttons have a backlight, which is constant for some buttons and pads, but uses VU meter- style segments for the faders, to show the level. Users must install a software suite, including a utility program called ROLI Dashboard for RISE and the company's synth engine, Equator. Equator's sounds are designed to respond to the RISE's five response dimensions. In Equator, the hardness or softness of pressing controls volume, gliding microtonally changes the pitch, sliding alters timbre (for example by changing the filter cutoff), pressure alters the sustain level and timbre. If the key release or \\"lift\\" response is used, it changes how notes end. The Y‚Äìaxis slide creates MIDI CC 74 messages (which are usually set to controls the cutoff frequency of a filter). All of the finger touches are independent; one finger can wiggle on a note causing vibrato, while another finger slides between notes, causing a pitch bend, while the thumb slides up and down its key, causing timbre changes. The performer can create crescendos and obtain a breath controller sound that resembles a bowed string or wind instrument. =GRAND Stage= The 88-key GRAND Stage was produced in a limited edition of 88 units. It is a plug and play controller and synthesizer that is about 26mm thick. Unlike the RISE keyboards, it does not have an array of buttons and faders. It has a black aluminium case, a silicone key surface, and a circular \\"user dial\\" made of aluminium that can be rotated to make changes, or pressed in its centre button. On the rear panel, there are three pedal inputs, two 1/4\\" audio jacks, a volume wheel, a 1/8\\" stereo headphone jack, USB type A and B jacks, an input for the DC power supply, and a power switch. History The Seaboard digital keyboard's creator, Roland Lamb was \\"...inspired by waves\\", in particular by the way that they are \\"...both continuous and separated into discrete sections ‚Äî the peaks and troughs\\". Lamb sought to design a digital keyboard that allowed performers to play \\"individual notes, but also explore the spaces between them.\\" Lamb's design philosophy is based on his notion of the importance of a \\"...living musical instrument\\". Lamb states that a \\"living musical instrument\\", one that is still being played by a community of musicians, is \\"10 percent physical, 90 percent cultural\\". In contrast, an ancient instrument in a museum may be one that \\"...nobody knows how to play it or what the music was like that was made with it. Then it‚Äôs just a dead object.\\" Lamb also argues that musical instruments are \\"the most physically intelligent tools\\", because a professional violinist's \\"level of virtuosity\\" is far beyond that of users of other tools, due to the years of \\"skill and practice\\" required to play an instrument at a high level. Lamb wanted to create an instrument offered \\"a depth of expression\\" that is accessible, in that \\"[y]ou don‚Äôt have to learn how the controls work, you just play, and learn as you play\\" the Seaboard. Lamb claims that the Seaboard \\"...expressiveness of an acoustic instrument with the adaptability of a digital\\" instrument, which gave him the inspiration to create a playing surface that was both \\"...continuous and discrete\\". Lamb believes that the current world of music-making is \\"problematic if not broken,\\" with people failing to properly address the need for versatile digital instruments.\\" During Lamb's PhD studies, he learned about early critics' comments about the pianoforte after it was introduced in the late 1700s. The first musicians to try the pianoforte found it \\"...too difficult to play\\" and they thought no one would use it, because they did not feel that you could control the new instrument.\\" Lamb notes that critics made the same comments about his Seaboard designs; he thinks that in time, musicians will become more comfortable using the soft-surfaced instrument. Reception Paul Miller's review of the BLOCK for Verge callis it \\"...multi-dimensionally expressive, a little hard to learn, and now available in a much more portable and affordable\\" format. Miller states that with the free Seaboard app, the \\"...hardware just makes the controls more accessible, expressive, and tactile.\\" James Vincent's review of the RISE and GRAND for Verge calls Seaboard creator Roland Lamb's belief that the instrument is more accessible \\"a bit generous\\", saying that while the Seaboard is \\"intuitive\\", there is still a \\"learning curve\\" using the \\"alien\\"-feeling, \\"foam mattress\\"-textured keyboard. Vincent stated that it is challenging because whereas with a normal piano, you just have to play the correct notes at the correct volume; with the Seaboard, you also have to focus on \\"...how hard you unpress them; how much you wiggle them, how far slide your fingers up them, and whether you want to incorporate glissandos at all.\\" Vincent says that players who master the instrument will find it to be \\"amazingly adaptable\\", as it allows \\"molding the sound\\". Those words are some of what ROLI founder, Roland Lamb lives by. You can easily see it in his work on the MPE-enabled Seaboard and BLOCKs series of products, which simply must be experienced to be totally understood. KVR Audio states that there is a \\"slight learning curve\\" with the Seaboard, as \\"[k]eyboard players will have to adjust their [playing] styles\\"; but once they learn the new instrument, the reviewer states that they will have access to a level of \\"...expressiveness that has been traditionally reserved for string and wind instrument players.\\" Alternatives Keyboards made by other manufacturers that offer responsiveness beyond that of a traditional MIDI controller keyboard: * K‚ÄìBoard * QuNexus * LinnStrument * Kaoline  Notable users  *Hans Zimmer, composer *Martyn Ware, producer, member of The Human League and Heaven 17 *BT, producer, composer, electronic music performer *Steve Angello *AR Rahman References Roli Seaboard Featured in Top 10 Best MIDI Keyboard Further reading *ROLI boss talks Seaboard Block and democratising music-making See also *MIDI controller External links *ROLI Seaboard website Category:MIDI controllers Category:Synthesizers ","title":"ROLI Seaboard"},{"id":"57978620","text":"Hydrocarboniphaga daqingensis is a heterotrophic and aerobic bacterium from the genus of Hydrocarboniphaga which has been isolated from water from the Longhu Lake in Daqing in China.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The building now houses Michigan State University's Child Development Laboratories. History For years after the Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University) was founded in 1855, children in the area were tutored at home or in some cases were sent to schools in nearby Lansing. However, at the end of the nineteenth century, the college population began growing and a new school district encompassing the college and surrounding residential areas was established in 1900. The first school building was constructed in late 1901, located on the spot of the present building. Due to rising enrollment, the school was enlarged in 1905 and 1909. However, in 1916, a disastrous fire completely destroyed the school. The school board contracted Lansing architect Edwyn Bowd to design a new fireproof school, and the building was constructed the following year. It was the only school building in East Lansing until 1922, and served high school students until a separate high school was built in 1927. A library addition was constructed in 1937, and four workrooms were added in 1952. It continued to be used as an elementary school by the district until 1984, when it was closed due to declining enrollment. The district sold the school to private developers. It was eventually purchased by Michigan State University, and now houses the University's Child Development Laboratories. Description The Central School is a two-story red brick Neoclassical building with a flat roof, measuring 70 feet by 100 feet. It sits on a raised foundation, with a cut stone beltcourse separating the foundation from the upper floors. The front facade is five bays wide, with the three center bays slightly recessed. The center bay has a recessed entrance with paired doors and a transom under a segmental arch. Brick Tuscan pilasters flank the doors. The windows are set in groupings of three double hung multi-light sash-type units, separated by wooden mullions. An iron cornice circles the building save for the center of the front facade.

Wall-Street.com, 586 U.S. ___ (2019), is a Supreme Court of the United States case in which the Court unanimously ruled that a copyright infringement suit must wait until the copyright is successfully registered by the United States Copyright Office. Background While the Copyright Act of 1976 grants automatic copyright privileges to an author when it is published to the public, the Act also requires \\"registration\\" of that copyright with the Copyright Office before bringing an infringement suits if the author is American. There had been a Circuit split about whether this \\"registration\\" required the Copyright Office to grant or deny the certificate of registration, or whether applying for the certificate could qualify as registration. Some circuit courts, such as the Eleventh and Tenth, held that is considered registered upon the copyright's approval by the Copyright Office, known as the \\"registration approach.\\" Others, including the Ninth and Fifth Circuits, held that registration occurs upon the application for registration, with the associated deposit and fee; this was known as the \\"application approach.\\" Fourth Estate wrote articles and licensed them for publication by other entities. One of their clients, Wall-Street.com, cancelled their licensing arrangement, and the license required Wall- Street.com to remove the content from their site, which they refused to do. Fourth Estate sued for copyright infringement, after having submitted their application for registration but without having waited for the registration to be approved. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh CircuitWall- Street.Com and Burden were represented by attorney David A. Geller at the Trial Court and 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. ruled that the infringement suit could not be brought because of that lack of approval. Supreme Court The case was granted certiorari by the Supreme Court, with oral arguments heard on January 9, 2019. Fourth Estate was represented at oral arguments by Aaron M. Panner. Peter K. Stris represented Wall-Street and Jerrold Burden. Fourth Estate contended that the Eleventh Circuit misread the statute, and believed that the requirement of \\"registration\\" refers to the action of the copyright holder, and not an action of the Copyright Office. Further, they contended normatively that a copyright holder's rights should not depend upon affirmative government action. The court ruled on March 4, 2019 that a registration certificate must be provided before a lawsuit can be filed.. It has been observed by one commentator that a decision in Fourth Estate's favor would essentially remove the Copyright Office's role in the process of moving copyright infringement cases to litigation, and concerns about the practical implications of litigating prior to the Register's grant or denial of registration were a prominent theme at the oral arguments.Jessica Litman, \\"Argument analysis: Justices wade deep into the copyright weeds\\", SCOTUSBlog, Jan. 9, 2019. Others have observed that the practical effect is minimal, since although the turnaround time for a registration with the Copyright Office can be months at a time, the Office offers an $800 expedited review process for cases with \\"compelling needs\\" like upcoming lawsuits, and offers preregistration for categories of works more likely to be infringed. Moreover, plaintiffs can recover for any losses accrued from infringement, even while waiting for the examination to be complete. The decision applies only to filing copyright litigation, and does not apply to other forms of enforcement, such as sending demand letters or issuing DMCA Section 512 takedown notices.

During the Second World War, he was active in the Czech Resistance.  Early life  Kolmer was born in Prague in 1922 to an assimilated Jewish family. His father died in 1932, and he subsequently spent holidays in Austria with his uncle. As a result, he was in Austria during the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia.  In Terez√≠n  Kolmer was selected to be part of the Aufbaukommando, the first transportation to Terez√≠n. The transport contained young able-bodied Jewish men, with the intention that the men would assist in building the ghetto. In Terez√≠n, he was specifically forced to build bunk beds, since he had carpentry experience. At one point, he was interned in the Small Fortress, and the treatment of prisoners by the SS that he witnessed there prompted him to join the underground resistance. He found an escape route out of Terez√≠n, but never used it himself; the route was used by a few prisoners later. He was able to use his Aufbaukommando status to temporarily protect some of his family members, including his grandmother, mother, and fianc√©e. His mother died in Terez√≠n in 1941.  Deportation to Auschwitz and escape  In October 1944, Kolmer was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. According to his later recollections, he arrived on a transport with 1,500 people, 1,250 of whom were immediately sent to the gas chambers by Josef Mengele. Kolmer only survived this initial selection because a prisoner he didn‚Äôt know told the Nazis he was a metal worker. He managed to escape Auschwitz by jumping on a transport with a friend which headed to the Gross-Rosen camp, specifically the subcamp Friedland.

He was also an economist. Oel√üner became a member of the ruling party's politburo in 1950. He fell out of favour over the so-called Schirdewan affair in 1958, however, and was excluded from the politburo. Tensions had arisen at the top of government over the extent which the country should be willing to respond positively to pressure from Moscow for a measure of De-Stalinization. Oel√üner was able to argue from an economic and political perspective in favour of a cautious easing of restrictions. After a period of a year or so during which it might have been thought that the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, was open to suggestions, the political downfall of Karl Schirdewan, Fred Oel√üner and one or two others was seen as a sign that traditionalist economic hardliners would remain in control. In September 1959 Oel√üner published his self-criticism on account of his \\"opportunism and political blindness\\" (\\"Opportunismus und politische Blindheit\\") during the years 1956/57.  Life  = Provenance and early years = Fred Oel√üner was born in Leipzig. Alfred Oel√üner, his father, was an activist member of the Social Democratic Party, and later became a Communist Party activist and official. His mother worked in the garments business. After attending middle school at nearby Wei√üenfels Oel√üner remained in Wei√üenfels, where he embarked on an apprenticeship in business and milling at the Beuditz Mill between 1917 and 1919. At the same time he continued his education, attending evening classes at a business school. = Politicisation = He joined the Young Socialists (\\"Sozialistische Arbeiter-Jugend\\" / SAJ) in 1917 and the Free Young Socialists (\\"Freie sozialistische Jugend\\" / FSJ) in 1918. He was dismissed from his apprenticeship after eighteen month in account of his \\"political activities\\". Despite still only being sixteen, Oel√üner joined the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD) in May 1919. The party had been formed a couple of years earlier as the result of a split in the mainstream SPD. At that point the principal cause of the split had been the decision by the SPD leadership to vote in support of funding for the war. By 1919 the war was over and economic hardship was leading to increased political polarisation. The Russian Revolution of 1917 had appeared to open up the possibilities for similar developments in Germany. The Communist Party of Germany was founded at a congress held in Berlin during three days between 30 December 1918 and 1 January 1919. Over the next year or so it was the turn of the USPD to break apart, with the majority of is members joining the newly formed Communist Party. However, the USPD seems to have remained relatively active in the Halle-Merseburg locality (where Oel√üner was based) through 1920, and it was only in December 1920 that he formally joined the Communist Party. During this period he supported himself with an office job at a co-operative enterprise in Halle till 1921. At the same time he served as a local team leader (\\"Bezirksleiter\\") for the Socialist Proletarian Youth organisation (\\"Sozialistische Proletarierjugend\\") and for the Young Communists in the Halle-Merseburg locality. In 1921 Oel√üner took part in the so-called March Action, a short-lived workers' revolt in central Germany. He then accepted a paid job, working for the Communist Party Central Committee under the direction of Wilhelm Koenen and Walter Stoecker. From Autumn 1921 till January 1922 he worked as a volunteer with the \\"Hamburgische Volkszeitung\\" (newspaper). During 1922/23 he undertook an editorial role with the \\"Schlesische Arbeiterzeitung\\", based in Breslau (as Wroc≈Çaw was then known). Further editorial postings on left-wing newspapers followed in Chemnitz, Aachen and Stuttgart. It was in Stuttgart that he was arrested in December 1923. He faced trial in September 1924 at the Supreme Court in Leipzig and was sentenced to a year in prison. The charge was the usual one under such circumstances of \\"preparing to commit high treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\"). Most of his sentence had already been expunged during his pretrial detention and he was released from prison in Cottbus in January 1925. After this he took further editorial posts in Remscheid and Aachen. = Moscow = He was sent by the party to Moscow in April 1926 and joined the Soviet Communist Party the same year. In Moscow he studied at the Comintern's newly established International Lenin School between 1926 and 1928. He remained at the school in 1929, now as an \\"Aspirant\\" (loosely \\"graduate student\\"). After that, he undertook a higher degree course at the Economics Faculty at the so- called Institute of Red Professors (\\"–ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ—Å—Å—É—Ä—ã\\"). He returned to Germany in the summer of 1932 and worked in Berlin under Ernst Schneller in the Propaganda Department of the party central committee. His areas of responsibility included party training, and he himself taught at the party's \\"Rosa Luxemburg Party Academy (\\"Reichsparteischule Rosa Luxemburg\\") at Sch√∂neiche-Fichtenau, just outside the city. = Nazi Germany = In January 1933 the Nazi Party took power and lost little time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. The party had gained support on the traditional populist pillars of hope and hatred. After the Reichstag fire at the end of February 1933 the authorities became particularly focused on those with a record of Communist Party activism. The party was progressively banned and by the middle of the summer most active communists had been arrested (or worse) or had fled abroad. Fred Oel√üner managed to remain in Berlin till December 1933, however. Both his continuing presence - presumably unregistered - and his continuing \\"party work\\" are identified in sources as \\"illegal\\". In December 1933 he emigrated to the Saarland, which at this point had not yet been re-integrated into Germany. Here he undertook \\"education\\" on behalf of the Party Central Committee. By 1934 he was in Paris which was rapidly becoming one of the two headquarter locations of the German Communist Party in exile. In Paris he worked closely with Walter Ulbricht, a future leader of East Germany. At least one source describes Oel√üner during 1934 as \\"Ulbricht's secretary\\" in Paris. He also headed up \\"party education\\" in Amsterdam, Z√ºrich and Paris. = Back in Moscow = In 1935 he was one of several exiled German Communists who relocated from Paris to Moscow, where by March 1935 he had accepted an invitation to become a teacher at the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West and at the International Lenin School. The decision to close down the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West was taken in May 1936. In August 1936 Oel√üner was dismissed from his teachings posts on account of alleged ideological deviations. The years 1936 - 1938 saw the Stalinist purges at their peak. Many hundred German political refugees from Nazism were arrested and accused of Trotskyite sympathies. Some were shot. Some were sent to labour camps and/or banished to remote regions of the Soviet Unions for many years. Oel√üner experienced the period as an unemployed refugee in Moscow, supporting himself as best he could with freelance translating and writing. There are suggestions that he was fortunate to suffer nothing worse. In September 1938 he obtained work in charge of the planning department at the so-called \\"Bop\\" Paper Mill in Moscow. He retained this job till June 1941. = Soviet citizen = In March 1940 Fred Oel√üner was granted Soviet citizenship. A factor was that he was by now married. His first wife was Russian and a Soviet citizen when he married her. His Soviet passport and other identity documents issued to him gave him a new name, \\"Fritz Larew\\". Back in Germany, Gestapo files from the start of 1941 list Oel√üner as one of their Special manhunt targets (in der \\"Sonderfahndungsliste\\") within the Soviet Union. Between June 1941 and Autumn 1944 he worked in Kuybyshev as an editor, and then as a chief editor, in the German language section of Moscow Radio. (In October 1941, the Communist Party and governmental organisations, diplomatic missions of foreign countries, leading cultural establishments and their staff were evacuated to Kuybyshe, but contingency preparations had been in place for such a move from at least as far back as the start of the war.Andrew Nagorski: The Greatest Battle, 2007, pp. 165‚Äì166) Early in 1943 he also became a member of a working group set up by the party leadership dealing with propaganda issues. By the end of 1944 the government apparatus had been back in Moscow for more than a year, and Fred Oel√üner with it. Between February and August 1944 he served as a member of an important working group planning a postwar programme for the (German) Communist Party. He was also a member of a smaller sub-group on the \\"trades union role\\". In September 1944 he took a teaching position at the German party's \\"Party Academy Nbr. 12\\" under the direction of Heinz Hoffmann, just outside Moscow. The school's \\"pupils\\" were German prisoners of war. = Soviet occupation zone = By the time war ended in May 1945 there were many thousands of Germans in the Soviet Union. No one knew how many. Most were prisoners of war. Others were political refugees who had fled to Moscow in the 1930s to escape from Hitler, and then fallen foul of the purges. Many were in labour camps or in internal exile far from Moscow and would never return to Germany. Of the thousands who did make it back, most would first be detained in the Soviet Union for another two to ten years. However, thirty men, who had spent the war years in Moscow, experienced a very different homecoming. Fred Oel√üner was one of them. On 30 April 1945 a Soviet aircraft flew the thirty men from Moscow to Minsk, and from there to an airfield at Kalau just outside Meseritz. From there they were taken in a truck to Bruchm√ºhle where the Soviet military commander, Marshal Zhukov had set up his headquarters some twenty miles to the east of Berlin. The ten man Ulbricht Group started work on 2 May 1945 while the ten men led by Gustav Sobottka made their way to Mecklenburg in the northern party of what was now to become known as the Soviet occupation zone. Fred Oel√üner was a member of the ten man Ackermann Group who now installed themselves in eastern Saxony. Much later it became clear that the thirty men who arrived from Moscow at the start of May 1945 had arrived with a remarkably detailed \\"nation building\\" plan. The first task was to prepare the groundwork for the re-establishment of communist organizations and unions in postwar Germany, with the focus on the area to be administered by the Soviet Union according to a military division of the western two thirds of Germany that had already been agreed between Germany's leading wartime enemies. The Ackermann Group made a slower start than the other two groups, however, since much the southern portion of the future Soviet occupation zone, including Leipzig had been liberated, after fierce fighting, by US forces, leaving the Soviet forces to concentrate on Berlin and the north of Germany. It was only in July 1945 that the American forces withdrew to the pre-agreed frontier. Slightly further to the east Dresden capitulated to the Red army on 8 May 1945, the day (according to most Anglo- American sources) of the official surrender. In Dresden Fred Oel√üner became the editor of a Red army \\"Daily newspaper for the German population\\". That appointment lasted only a few weeks, however. In June 1945 he was transferred to Berlin. His mandate now, from the Communist Party Central Committee was to create and head up the party's important Agitprop department. The Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) was launched in April 1946, created through a contentious merger of the old Commnist Party and (if only, for most purposes, within the Soviet occupation zone) the more moderately left-wing Social Democratic Party. During 1946 Oel√üner was employed by the new party's national executive committee (\\"Parteivorstand\\") as head of the party education department. In 1947 he himself became a member of the national executive which quickly became (and was renamed as) the Party Central Committee. Within the Central Committee, between October 1947 and February 1949 he took on responsibility for a newly expanded department covering not just party education but also culture and schooling. Former Social Democrats in the party leadership were quickly squeezed out and the SED came to resemble a Soviet-style communist party in all but name. By the time the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched, in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the SED was firmly in place as the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. Fred Oel√üner was nominated to membership of the People's Council (\\"Volksrat\\") in May 1949 and was \\"elected\\" a member of its successor body, the People's Parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\") later that year. The German Democratic Republic operated according to a highly centralised power structure: power resided not with any legislative assembly, nor even with government ministers, but with the Central Committee of the ruling party. However, the party's dominating role was concealed to the extent that Central Committee members were frequently also members of the Volkskammer and/or appointed as government ministers. In 1950 Oel√üner joined the inner caucus of the Central Committee, known under the Leninist power structure of the new country as the politburo. = German Democratic Republic = Oel√üner was in office between 1950 and 1955 as Central Committee Secretary for Propaganda. He worked till 1956 as editor-in-chief of Einheit (loosely \\"Unity\\"), a prestigious academic monthly journal published by the party, devoted to \\"the theory and practice of economic socialism\\". Till 1958 he was effectively the party's chief ideologue. In December 1951 he was appointed to headship of the teaching chair for Political Economics at the Central Committee Academy for Social Sciences. Under other circumstances this might have been seen as a full-time position and the basis for an long-term academic career, but in Oel√üner's case sources stress that at this time most of the daily jobs associated with the post would have been delegated to others. In 1953 he became a member of the German Academy of Sciences (\\"Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin\\"). Thanks to his outstanding fluency in Russian, combined with his high political offices in the East German political hierarchy, during the first part of the 1950s Oel√üner participated as a simultaneous translator in important discussions involving Walter Ulbricht and Wilhelm Pieck, the East German leaders, with the leadership in Moscow (including Stalin) and with Vladimir Semyonov, head of the Soviet military administration based in Berlin-Karlshorst. In 1955 he also became a deputy chairman of the Ministerial Council. He also became chair of the Ministerial Council's Commission for Consumer Goods and Public Supplies. In 1956 his academic credentials received a boost when he was appointed to a professorship in Political Economics at the Institute for Social Sciences at the Academy for Social Sciences. Within the politburo Oel√üner had emerged as a critic of plans for the \\"complete collectivisation of agriculture\\" which came to enjoy the backing of the \\"Ulbricht wing\\" after 1956. In the Soviet Union, following the death of Stalin and the \\"secret speech\\" delivered by Nikita Khrushchev in February 1956 (discussion of which was strongly discouraged within East German government circles), a view was developing that the communist regime's longer-term survival might best be secured not simply by repression, fear and rigged election results, but by seeking to win the genuine support of the population. Karl Schirdewan, another of the 12 (or 14) members of the East German politburo, was actually present when Khrushchev delivered his speech at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow. Discussions of the possible desirability of cautiously relaxing state control over society found their way into the East German politburo and for a time, according to some, it seemed that a measure of liberalisation might be possible. It was never clear how widespread those ideas became at the heart of government. Sources originating with East German government always identify (retrospectively) the same three Central Committee dissenters \\"and others\\", without ever identifying the others. By early in 1958 Walter Ulbricht had evidently identified a threat to the status quo and possibly to his own political dominance. In February/March 1958 Fred Oel√üner was excluded from the Politburo and relieved of all his political and party offices, accused of \\"repeated violations of Politburo discipline\\" (\\"... wiederholter Verletzung der Disziplin des Politb√ºros\\"). Others expelled from the Central Committee were Karl Schirdewan and Ernst Wollweber, accused of \\"factionalism\\" and \\"violations of party rules\\". Arguably Fred Oel√üner did not fall so low as his fellow Central Committee expellees, Karl Schirdewan and Ernst Wollweber. He certainly did not suffer like Paul Merker, another former Politburo member who had incurred Walter Ulbricht's suspicions a couple of years earlier. It may have helped that in September 1959 Oel√üner published his self-criticism on account of his \\"opportunism and political blindness\\" (\\"Opportunismus und politische Blindheit\\") during the years 1956/57. But there was to be no return for Oel√üner to frontline politics. Between 1958 and 1969 he headed up the Institute for Social Sciences at the Academy for Social Sciences, as its director. Between 1961 and 1968 he was also secretary there for the departments covering Philosophy, Law and Economics. He received an honorary doctorate (\\"Dr. h. c.\\") from the Humboldt University of Berlin in 1968.

Its chiaroscuro shows strong influence from Caravaggio, whose work Rubens had seen during a stay in Rome. History It remained in the artist's possession until his death 1640 and it may then have passed to his brother-in-law Arnold Lundens. A painting owned by one Muhlmann in Riga in 1646 may also be identified with this painting. By 1801 the work had entered the collection of George Rogers, from whom it was acquired by Hastings Elwin, who retained it until 1806 - on 23 Mary that year it was sold in London for 950 guineas to Alexis Delahante. Delahante sold it on later that year for 2000 guineas to Charles Duncombe, 1st Baron Feversham. It was passed down through the Duncombe family until it was sold in 1947 to Francis Francis of Bird Cay on the Bahamas - he then lent it to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In 1965 it returned to London and on 30 June that year was sold at Sotheby's to the art dealer Agnew's for ¬£19,000, who immediately resold it to a private collection. It was back in Sotheby's on 7 July 2004, when it was sold to Otto Naumann Limited of New York for ¬£2.5 million. That dealer resold it the following year to its present owners with contributions from the BankGiro Loterij, the Stichting Vrienden van het Mauritshuis, the Mondriaan Stichting, the Vereniging Rembrandt (partly thanks to the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds) and the legacy of Miss A.A.W.

Career  His parents were Lillian Langford and Bert Reeves. He had a twin brother. Reeves studied at the Cheltenham School of Art (1947 - 1949) and at the Royal College of Art, London (1951-1954). Reeves became a lecturer at Glasgow School of Art in 1954 and was Head of Printmaking from 1970 to 1991. He founded the Edinburgh print makers workshop in 1967 and was a founder member of Glasgow Print Studio in 1972. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of the Painter-Etchers and Engravers in 1951, an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1971, was the President of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolours from 1998 to 2005. Reeves was instrumental in developing the printmaking department at Glasgow School of Art. As printmaking took on a more central role within contemporary art during the 1960s and 1970s, Reeves developed his own work and experimented with print techniques as well as moving into collage. Inspiration for his work came from rural or coastal areas - the West Highland Way or cliffs in the North of Scotland, as much as urban scenes and cityscapes.

Image from Jules Martin's Nos peintres et sculpteurs, Flammarion, 1898 Illustration for a 1906 edition of H. G. Wells's 1898 \\"The War of the Worlds\\" Henrique Alvim Corr√©a (30 January 1876 ‚Äì 7 June 1910) was a Brazilian illustrator of military and science fiction books. He was born in Rio de Janeiro, and died in Brussels. He is best known for his illustrations of a French translation of H. G. Wells's novel \\"The War of the Worlds\\". Biography Corr√™a went to live in Europe at the age of 16, shortly after the proclamation of the Republic of Brazil in 1892, taken by the royalist Bar√£o de Oliveira Castro, his stepfather. In 1903 he executed a series of 132 notable illustrations, 32 of which were inserted in the book War of the Worlds, by H. G. Wells, to whom he personally requested authorization. After the author's approval in 1905, who considers the work superior to that of Warwick Goble, Corr√™a's work is published in a luxury edition printed in 500 copies in 1906 by L. Vandamme & Cie in a French translation by HD Davray. All of these illustrations are the strength of his work. In Brazil, his work is generally classified as being Pre-Modernist. The Belgian edition received a special circulation of 500 copies. He built a press in his Watermael-Boitsfort studio. He also produced artistic works on military life, mainly on the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871). He also produced other works of a erotic nature, signed as \\"Henri LeMort\\". In the composition of some of these works, Blanche, his future wife, posed as a model. Part of his work got lost. In 1914, when Germany invaded Belgium in the World War I, part of his drawings were stolen or destroyed. In 1942, during World War II, some of his illustrations were lost when the ship that transported them to Brazil sank, torpedoed by a German submarine. The first public exhibition of his work happened in 1972 at the S√£o Paulo Museum of Art (MASP). Others would follow, such as those of 1977 and 1990, at the National Museum of Fine Arts, and that of 1981, at the Casa de Rui Barbosa Foundation, both in the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 2004, his work was exhibited at the Science Fiction Museum (EMP Museum), in Seattle, USA, on the occasion of its inauguration. In 2016 his work was presented at the contemporary art exhibition Ulla, Ulla, Ulla! Martians, Aliens, Intergalactics and Humans at the Casanova Gallery in S√£o Paulo. In 1985, Alvim's engravings depicting nude and/or abused women were included in the book Baco e Anas brasileira, by the Goetian poet Y√™da Schmaltz. Henrique Alvim Corr√™a died in 1910, at the age of 34 and his body was transferred to Brazil, being buried in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Exhibitions * 1972 ‚Äì S√£o Paulo.

Company () is a renowned military band and drill unit the Norwegian Armed Forces. It is attached to the Hans Majestet Kongens Garde or The King's Guard, acting as its unit band and drill team. The band and drill unit is based out of Huseby Leir in the capital Oslo where its area of responsibility is. It is a renowned unit that is famous around the world for its participation in international military tattoos. In its activities, it participates in parades and ceremonies for HM Harald V of Norway) and Norwegian members of the House of Gl√ºcksburg. It also supports the government and the military, specifically increasing the esprit de corps in army units as well as in the public. The concert season usually lasts from December to March/April while the marching season lasts until September. History When the King's Guard was established in Stockholm in 1856, three buglers were ordered to play camp signals. Later, musicians interested in military music and joined the rapidly growing group of musicians on duty. At the time, it only served as the entertainment for the Huseby Leir, or as a ceremonial music band in the drill area. The drill unit made its breakthrough after first attending the Scottish-organized Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo in 1961. After the drill programs were incorporated into the service in 1961, it became more difficult to carry out the required signal assignments as drummers, buglers and trumpet players from the corps took care of these assignments in addition to drill training and music drills. Therefore, the Band Corps was established in 1962 and then divided into the main marching band and a drum, bugle and trumpet corps playing snare drums, bugles and fanfare trumpets. In previous years, the troops in the 3rd Guard Company were part of the 5th Guard Company, but became a separate company from 1 August 2003. In 2018, the main corps was named Janitsjar Corps to equate the corps more. Band Being the most visible part of the company, the band provides musical accompaniment for all state ceremonies foreign and domestic. Everyone who enters the band must audition prior to joining, which are usually held in the spring. It is an integral part of the Norwegian Military Tattoo, which it participates in due to it being part of the Forsvarets musikk (English: Defence Music). Uniquely, the band consists of about 50% conscript women musicians and field musicians, compared to 17% in the rest of the armed forces. Signal Corps buglers are constantly on guard duty at the Royal Palace and as weekly ceremonial buglers (UKHB) in Huseby Leir. They have the responsibility to play bugle calls during the raising and lowering of the Flag of Norway, the start of lunch and during the mail rounds for the battalion. On occasion, veteran musicians can be called into service to reinforce the band. Drill Unit The 40-member drill unit is the official parade and exhibition drill unit of the battalion. During the 2-month training and selection process of the unit, close attention is paid to the basic drill movements of members. The main requirements of the drill unit is a minimum height of 170 cm, good physical shape and a good rhythmic coordination ability. The unit will more often than not be performing alongside the band as it rarely performs by itself It commonly performs precision drill and ceremony routines at various army barracks such as Bardufoss Leir. During these visits, it commonly performs a 20-25 minute drill routine which includes solo drill and a merged drill routine with the band. Veterans Contingent The contingent emblem The Norwegian Guard Veterans Drill Contingent () is an affiliated civilian organization for veterans who have served in the King's Guard. In 1984, the Norwegian Guard Musicians' Association (NGMF) was created by former guardsmen to support and promote band and drill company financially and by giving them publicity. A music band as formed among the rank and file in 1986 which formed a separate organization: Norwegian Guard Musicians' Federation Corps, which was merged into today's NGD in 2011. They use historical uniforms similar to those used by the King's Guard from around 1870 to the Second World War. The uniform was approved and approved by King Olav in the Council of Ministers in the autumn of 1986. They are also armed with M1 Garands.https://www.spleis.no/project/36031 Leadership =Company Command= The Company Staff in the 3rd Company consists of 3 or 4 soldiers who perform the following functions: *Company management *Accounting for all instruments *Musical training *Archiving sheet music files *Adjust the training schedule to the company's needs *Setting dates for events The staff supports the commander and the rest of the company, and is most often visible during the missions when they stand up and answer questions from the audience.

The dam collapse lead to widespread destruction and homelessness among the local population in neighbouring Attapeu Province. As of 25 September, 40 people were confirmed dead, at least 98 more were missing (maybe as many as 1,100 more people), and 6,600 others were displaced. Background Construction of the earth-filled Saddle Dam D near Paksong, part of the $1.2bn (¬£915m) hydroelectric project by Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Power Company (PNPC), was begun in 2013. The hydroelectric project was a build- operate-transfer project. PNPC is a joint investment venture formed in March 2012 by SK Engineering and Construction (SK E&C;), Korea Western Power (KOWEPO), Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding (RATCH), and Lao Holding State Enterprise (LHSE). SK E&C; holds a 26% stake in PNPC, LHSE 24%, and RATCH and KOWEPO equally own the remaining shares. Part of an overall project to build two main dams and five auxiliaries, by the time of the collapse, it was near to completion and was intended to open for business in 2019. Although landlocked, Laos is traversed by many intertwining rivers, which has encouraged their damming. The dam's construction was part of what has been described as an \\"ambitious ... scheme to become the 'battery' of Asia\\", due to the country's location on the Mekong river and \\"abundant natural resources\\". The dam was intended to form a chain with other dams in the adjacent province of Champasak, across the Houay Makchanh, Xe Namnoy and Xe Pian rivers. The dam, close to the Cambodian border, was intended to operate to a capacity of 410 megawatts, and earn revenue for the government by exporting 90% of the electricity produced to Thailand, which is more economically prosperous and developed compared to Laos. Environmental pressure groups have long been critical of the Laotian government's ambitions regarding hydroelectric power, which have involved building multiple dams on the Mekong as well as on its tributaries. Concern has focused on potential damage to the flora and fauna and the animal societies dependent on the river to survive. Neighboring countries, like Cambodia and Vietnam that are downstream from the dams and rely heavily on the Mekong for fishing, food, agricultural irrigation, transport, tourism and cultural traditions, have expressed concern that Laos' hydroelectric ambitions could \\"disrupt vital ecosystems and their own river systems\\". The dam building program has regularly required the displacement and transplanting of inhabitants of villages that are found to obstruct dam construction, the benefits of which \\"are mainly enjoyed outside of the country\\", said environmental activists. The company denied that the dam had collapsed, blaming recent heavy weather for the flooding, which had resulted in torrential rain filling the dam beyond capacity and overflowing, it said, which exacerbated the flooding which had already taken place downstream. A spokesperson for SK E&C; said, \\"we believe that parts of the upper area of the dam were lost due to heavy rains and [then] the water overflowed\\". The International Rivers organization‚Äîwhom the Washington Post described as \\"a nongovernmental group generally critical of such projects\\"‚Äîsuggested that the collapse illustrates the \\"major risks\\" involved if construction is \\"unable to cope with extreme weather conditions\\", as, particularly in Laos, \\"unpredictable and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent\\". Indeed, an evacuation order had been in place for the area at the bottom of the dam due to cracks having been discovered in it. This damage had been reported to the company by South Korean contractors \\"at least a day before\\" the flooding, reported news outlets. Engineers from SK E&C; apparently informed the PNPC that the top of the dam's structure had been washed away by 9 p.m. the previous night. Repair work was delayed because of the heavy rain. Furthermore, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that it had obtained documents showing that \\"11 centimetres of subsidence was found at the centre of the dam\\" as early as the previous Friday. This subsidence was severe enough to prevent the use of emergency repair equipment. On 11 September 2017, the reservoir for a dam under construction on the Nam Ao River in Phaxay district, Xiangkhouang Province collapsed after heavy rains in the area. In December 2016, the Xekaman 3 dam in Dak Cheung District, Sekong Province, had to be shut down after six years of usage due to damage in water tunnels. Collapse The dam collapse occurred around 8 p.m. on Monday 23 July, and caused immediate flash flooding through the villages of Yai Thae, Hinlad, Ban Mai, Thasengchan, Tha Hin, and Samong, all in Sanamxay district. Homes, roads and bridges were swept away. The portion of the dam that collapsed was reported to be a saddle dam, known as \\"Saddle D\\", or \\"an auxiliary structure used to hold water beyond what is held by the main dam\\". The CEO of one of the companies involved stated that \\"[it] was fractured and the water had leaked to the downstream area and down to the Xe-Pian River which is about five kilometres from the dam\\". Earlier in the day on 23 July, Lee Kang Yeol, Head of Resettlement Office of the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Power Company Resettlement Office sent a warning letter to the provincial resettlement offices in Champasak and Attapeu Provinces indicating that water levels in the dam were high and that dam failure was imminent. The letter further urged that all residents in the Xe Pian river valley be evacuated to higher ground immediately. Lao News Agency reported that \\"several human lives\\" had been lost, and that around 6,000 people may have been made homeless as a result. There were no precise figures regarding casualties within the first 24 hours, although The Guardian reported \\"hundreds missing\\" and \\"several\\" confirmed dead early the following morning. At least six villages were severely affected‚Äîaround 1,300 households‚Äîwith many survivors stranded on their rooftops and in trees. By 25 July, nearly 3,000 people had been rescued. The village of Ban Mai alone had 50 inhabitants known to be missing. Rescue efforts were complicated by the fact that the area is densely forested with no mobile-phone coverage, which may also have contributed to the uncertainty as to casualty rates. What roads previously existed were washed away in the floods, and the affected villages were only approachable by either helicopter or flat-bottomed boats. As of 23 September, 40 people were confirmed dead, at least 98 more were missing and 6,600 others were displaced. =Response and aid= Government agencies and the power company jointly commenced a rescue and evacuation of villages still in danger, amid rising water levels. They were joined by a South Korean company, SK Engineering and Construction, which was a stakeholder in the dam's construction. The Prime Minister of Laos, Thongloun Sisoulith, suspended his immediate meetings and travelled in person to the site, as did the President and board of SK E&C.; Sisoulith also called in both the police and the army, and declared the area a disaster zone on Tuesday. Local government requested emergency aid from central government as well as neighbouring communities. One of the largest banks in Laos, Banque Pour Le Commerce Exterieur Lao, set up a relief donation fund seeking to raise 2 billion kip (US$238,000) for victims of the disaster. The neighbouring Asian countries of China, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have also expressed readiness to provide any assistance needed by Laos. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, Chinese companies and businesses in Laos that were involved in the construction of China-Laos railway immediately joined the rescue work efforts. Thai rescue workers reportedly complained that Laos had shown lethargy in allowing them entry, meaning that they had been kept waiting at the border. The International Red Cross organized water purification devices for the area as each village lost its food supplies, while the Asean Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance (AHA Centre) relief items were dispatched from its warehouse in Malaysia to Vientiane by the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF). On 26 July, South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered a relief team to be sent into the country, a rare order from their President for any accident in foreign country since a South Korean firm was involved in the incident. Singapore announced that they will be sending their Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers and US$100,000 to aid relief efforts, with the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) also announced S$50,000 in humanitarian aid. Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) delivered S$280,000 in flood relief supplies on Thursday evening while officers from SCDF will arrive on Friday. The Vietnamese government has provided a total of US$200,000 relief aid, with another US$50,000 coming from their Defence Ministry and another VND300 million (US$13,000) from Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry. Vietnam Electricity (EVN) have contributed around VND1 billion (US$43,000) while the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VRC) Central Committee handed over US$50,000 to the Laos embassy in Vietnam. The Vietnamese People's Army (VPA) sent a contingent team of 100 officers, including medics and rescue vehicles to assist in relief efforts. A 32-strong team People's Liberation Army (PLA) medical contingent was also dispatched, together with the arrival of relief supplies from Thailand. Mercy Malaysia has sent a rapid assessment team to assist in both severe flooding caused by the dam collapse and tropical storm Son-Tinh, with the Malaysian government also conveyed to their Laotian counterpart that they will donating RM400,000 (US$100,000) to assist Laos to facilitate its relief efforts. On 30 July, the Cambodian government donated $100,000 relief aid. The following day, Chinese relief aid began to arrived into the Laotian capital. South Korean government also deciding to send more aid along with the offer of US$1 million aid shortly after the arrival of medicine and relief supplies from the country. Another relief team consisting of 19 medical personnel was sent by South Korea on 7 August. Apart from the aid of South Korean government, SK Group has offered to donate $10 million relief aid, Korean Air has sent 36,000 litres of mineral water with 2,000 blankets and Lotte Group has donated US$100,000. Foreign individuals living in Laos also helping to deliver aid by raising money from their food businesses. Government compensation for lives lost amounted to 1.5 million Lao kip (U.S. $176) for each person. Aftermath Within days of the disaster, survivors were questioning why they had received so little warning before it happened, \\"with some of the displaced saying they were warned to evacuate homes only hours before disaster struck\\". It was unclear how the damage affect the overall plan for Laos' hydroelectric ambitions. Meanwhile, shares in the various companies connected to the project, particularly SK E&C; plunged immediately following the disaster. Dam Re-built Looking on Sentinel 2, the reservoir started to be filled around 2019-06-19, and appeared filled by 2019-10-22.

Prior to working at the IEA, Mrs Mensa also worked at Amarkai Amarteifio Chambers (1995-1997) and BJ Da Rocha Chambers as a Junior Lawyer (1998). Mensa has been ranked by the African Network of Entrepreneurs (TANOE) as one of the Top 60 outstanding, inspiring and hardworking corporate women leaders in Ghana (2017). She has won several awards including the Excellent Leadership Award by the EXLA Group (2013) and the Young Professional Role Model in Governance Award presented by the Young Professionals and Youth Coalition Initiative (2014).  Controversy  The Electoral Commission chaired by Jean was cautioned by the former president of Ghana John Mahama not to compile a new voter's register. He claimed there is not much time left for the general election to compile a new voters' register. He said Jean Mensah and her outfit will be held responsible if the country turns into a turmoil after the 2020 general elections take place. Demonstrations took place across the country in three cities Tamale, Kumasi and Accra to sound their view against the compilation.

It was built during 1881 by J. Abernethy & Co, . The property is owned by the Office of Environment and Heritage, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  This twin bed lathe was made in 1881 at Aberdeen by J. Abernethy and Co. and brought to Sydney where it was used to turn columns for the Sydney GPO, The Queen Victoria Building and for the granite pedestal for the Queen Victoria statue in Queen's Square, Sydney. It was last in use at Loveridge and Hudson's Yard in Sydney in the 1960s. It was given by Mr Ted Hudson to the Lachlan Vintage Village at Forbes and disposed at auction in May 1987. It was subsequently repurchased by the Heritage Council of NSW and ownership transferred to the Minister for Planning under the NSW Heritage Act 1977. The lathe was reassembled at the Lachlan Vintage Village, Forbes, following recognition of its significance. In 1999, the lathe was transferred to the State Heritage Register under the Act. The Heritage Council resolved at its 4 November 2009 meeting to recommend that the Minister: *acting as a corporation sole under section 102 of the NSW Heritage Act 1977, transfers title of the Abernethy Stonemason's Lathe from the corporation sole to Eurobodalla Shire Council. The Abernethy Stonemason's Lathe is the only moveable item of its type known to have survived in Australia. The item is currently owned and managed by the Minister for Planning under the Heritage Act 1977. Eurobodalla Shire Council has approached the Heritage Branch, NSW Department of Planning, to obtain the item for public display at Moruya. Council has also indicated its willingness to obtain legal title to the lathe in perpetuity, from the Minister for Planning, to assist their active care and long term management of the item. The Heritage Branch has identified this action as being beneficial to the long-term care, display and public enjoyment of the lathe. Eurobodalla Shire Council has obtained planning permission to display the item in a public outdoor setting adjacent to the Moruya Historical Society building near Campbell Street, Moruya. Transfer of the item will require later Heritage Council approval under section 57 and/or section 60 of the Act. Under the Heritage Act, transfer of an item of environmental heritage from the control of the Minister and the corporation to another party requires the recommendation of the Heritage Council of NSW under section 116(2). The Heritage Council agreed to recommend the disposal of the item at its meeting of 4 November 2009.Item 2.4 The Minister wrote to Eurobodalla Council in March 2010 to formally transfer title. Records indicate that the lathe was last used at Loveridge & Hudson's Yard in Sydney in the 1960s. It is unclear whether the Lathe was ever situated near the main source of granite at Moruya, or whether it was always located in Sydney. The Moruya Antique Tractor and Machinery Association (MATMA) suggests that a collection of historic photographs show the Lathe situated at Louttit's quarry, Moruya, at one stage. For many years the lathe was in limbo its last known use was at the stonemasonry firm of Loveridge and Hudson in Sydney during the 1960s. The firm was registered in 1882, just after the lathe's construction. Did they order and ship it to Australia at that time. the company records are lost today. The lathe is however attributed to turning the stone columns for some of Sydney's most majestic buildings. The extension of the Sydney GPO in the 1880s, the Queen Victoria Building (1898), Circular Quay railway station (early 1900s), and the Martin Place Savings Bank (1925), amongst others. At this time, suggestions are that the lathe was based in Sydney. Was it always that way? There is some thought that it had once been at Louttit's Quarry on the banks of the Moruya River. We do know that it turned Moruya granite and we know that by 1977 the Sydney company of Loveridge and Hudson had donated it to the then growing Lachlan Vintage Village in Forbes, an Old Sydney Town-type heritage village. The lathe was in Sydney at that time. Here its fortunes were a little more certain, until the village owners sold it to a local scrap metal business a decade later in 1987. Heritage enthusiasts including the Department of Public Works and the National Trust, lamented the lathe's loss. The Hon. Bob Carr, then Minister for Heritage, placed an Order over the historic monument that year under the Heritage Act. The Heritage Council under its then Chair Justice Hope stepped in and purchased it and it was given a stay of life in the Village grounds. With Lachlan Vintage Village's verging collapse, the lathe was once again in jeopardy. Calls to remove it were made from 1991. The relocation of the lathe to Moruya in May 2010 was made possible by the coming together of key community members and the local Council to rescue this important part of New South Wales' industrial heritage. Local groups recognised the importance of this item to the local area and were instrumental in starting the dialogue to get the lathe relocated. It is fitting then that the Heritage Council, which saved the lathe from scrapping in the 1980s, could assist by recommending to the Minister that it be transferred to Eurobodalla for final display and protection.  Description  Abernethy & Co Stonemason's Lathe A lathe for turning large stone columns. Assembled from components of cast iron with milled gears and shafts mounted on a bed of approximately length with toothed rails for positioning the travelling end. = Condition = As at 9 September 2010, the lathe was substantially intact.

Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 17 August 2010, it was a rare surviving piece of Victorian machinery which was in use for nearly a century, this stonemason's lathe demonstrates changes in technology and in the taste for the use of stone elements in public buildings. It is associated with many significant public buildings in Sydney of the late Victorian period including Sydney General Post Office, the Queen Victoria Building and the pedestal for Queen Victoria's statue in Queen's Square. It is rare for its size and demonstrates aspects of late 19th century toolmaking technology. Abernethy and Co Stonemason's Lathe was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Associated with construction of major public works in the late Victorian period in Sydney including the Sydney General Post Office, The Queen Victoria Building and the Pedestal for Queen Victoria's Statue in Queen's Square. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Indicative of the fluctuating preference for stone elements in public buildings. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. An example of 19th century technology which survived in use for its original specialised purpose for nearly a century. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. A rare surviving Victorian stonemason's lathe, possibly unique outside Europe.

He is the current Minister of Finance since 2020. Since 2015, he has been the chairman of the Vienna branch of the √ñVP. Prior, he was Chancellery minister for European Affairs, Art, Culture, and Media from 2017 to 2019; he was also General Secretary of the √ñVP from 2013 to 2015. Education and personal life Bl√ºmel attended elementary school in his home town of Moosbrunn, Lower Austria. He attended the Don Bosco Salesian high school in Unterwaltersdorf, where he graduated in 2000. After completing military service in the Austrian Armed Forces, he studied philosophy at the University of Vienna and the University of Burgundy in Dijon, and graduated in 2009 with a master's degree. He then studied at the Executive Academy of the Vienna University of Economics and Business, and graduated with a Master of Business Administration degree. Bl√ºmel is a member of the Catholic student union KaV Norica Vienna. Since 2014 he has been in a relationship with the journalist, presenter and spokeswoman Clivia Treidl. On 2 March 2020, the couple became parents of a daughter. Political career Bl√ºmel began his political career in the √ñVP's youth branch, the Young People's Party (JVP). As its international secretary, he has been a member of the national board since 2006. From 2006 to 2008 Bl√ºmel was active in the National Council, first as a parliamentary employee and then in the office of the Second President of the National Council Michael Spindelegger of the √ñVP. From 2009, Bl√ºmel was a consultant for the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs. He was also Vice President of the Youth of the European People's Party (YEPP) from 2008 to 2010. In June 2011, Bl√ºmel was entrusted with the tasks of \\"Council of Ministers coordination and government work\\" in the cabinet of then-Vice Chancellor Spindelegger. =General-Secretary of the √ñVP= On 6 December 2013, the federal party executive of the √ñVP appointed Bl√ºmel as General Secretary. After leader Michael Spindelegger's resignation in September 2014, Bl√ºmel was confirmed as General Secretary by new chairman- designate Reinhold Mitterlehner at the meeting of the federal party executive. In the 2014 European elections, Bl√ºmel was campaign manager for the √ñVP. During his time as General Secretary, Bl√ºmel was also media spokesman in the √ñVP parliamentary group. He presented the media package \\"More Programs for Austria\\" on 31 July 2014, seeking to relax restrictions and strengthen competition within Austrian media. He also sought to loosen restrictions on √ñsterreichischer Rundfunk, the public broadcaster, and encourage more high- quality domestically-produced media in Austria. He also called for an ancillary copyright to protect journalistic content and intellectual property on the internet; to this end, he prioritized a European solution over a national one. In his capacity as General Secretary, Bl√ºmel initiated a program known as \\"Evolution People's Party\\" to further develop the party's program. According to the √ñVP, this gave party members and non-members alike the opportunity to contribute their ideas and suggestions for a new party program. In spring 2015, at the party congress on the 70th anniversary of the √ñVP's foundation, a new basic program was adopted. After the √ñVP's abysmal result in the 2015 Viennese state election, Bl√ºmel replaced Manfred Juraczka as regional party chairman of the party's branch there. He thus left office as General Secretary and was succeeded by Peter McDonald. =√ñVP leader in Vienna= On 12 October 2015, Bl√ºmel was appointed to succeed Manfred Juraczka, who resigned as regional party chairman of the Vienna √ñVP on the evening of the election. The √ñVP won just 9.2% of votes, its worst ever result in a state election. Bl√ºmel served as non-executive city councillor in the H√§upl VI cabinet; Markus W√∂lbitsch succeeded him in this position on 25 January 2018. In December 2018, Bl√ºmel was announced as the √ñVP's lead candidate for the October 2020 state election. The √ñVP won 20.4% in the election, more than twice as high as its 2015 result, and became the second largest party for the first time since the 2005 election. =Federal politics= Bl√ºmel was one of the √ñVP's five-member steering committee for government formation after the 2017 federal election, alongside leader Sebastian Kurz, Elisabeth K√∂stinger, Stefan Steiner, and Bettina Glatz-Kremsner. The √ñVP ultimately came to a coalition agreement with the Freedom Party of Austria (FP√ñ). Bl√ºmel was initially appointed as Minister for Art, Culture, the Constitution, and the Media in the first Kurz government, but after reorganisation of ministries, less than a month later he was re-appointed as Chancellery minister for European Affairs, Art, Culture, and Media. In this capacity, Bl√ºmel was a proponent of the upload filters provided for in Draft Article 13 of the European Union copyright reform.

As of February 2019 it had been mapped to a length of , making it the fifth-longest cave in the United States and the tenth-longest in the world. Discovery The earliest visitors to the Fisher Ridge Cave System were Archaic Native Americans who explored the cave. They scratched a lattice or checkerboard pattern onto a large breakdown boulder. Pieces of charcoal from a cane torch dated to approximately 3000 BCE and footprints were also found in the cave. Prehistoric explorers of the cave likely used a different entrance from the ones that are known now, but it is not clear which entrance may have been used. The cave system was rediscovered in January 1981 by a group of Michigan cavers associated with the Detroit Urban Grotto of the National Speleological Society. Lack of connection The Fisher Ridge Cave System has not yet been found to connect to the nearby Mammoth Cave system, despite a separation of only between the nearest cave passages. The closest approach between the two caves is located high in the ridges, which is unfavorable for connection efforts. The most likely location of connection, if one exists, is deeper in the active base-level streams of the caves, since erosion of the valleys between ridges tends to separate previously connected cave passages located higher in the caves. Surveyed cave passages run inside the boundary of Mammoth Cave National Park, but the two caves remain apparently unconnected. It is likely that the caves will eventually be connected, but cavers in Fisher Ridge have discouraged efforts to identify a connection.

It was an attempt to simplify basic mathematical processing, a common theme in the 1950s, but found little use before the arrival of FORTRAN at MIT the next year. Description This language was essentially a set of macros that expanded out user source code into a series of assembly language instructions, which were then compiled using the existing SAL assembler, Symbolic Assembly Program. For instance, the formula \`A + B = C\` would add the values in memory locations A and B and put the result in C. To do this, the DARSIMCO compiler would write out the following three instructions: LDA A FAD B STO C The language included similar expansions for subtraction, multiplication, division, and simple looping. The language was implemented on the IBM 704 at MIT's New England Regional Computer Center. Programmed using punch cards, the system had a two-week turnaround because Kemeny had to take the cards in via train from Dartmouth.

Khan's paternal uncle, Khawajah Hassan's daughter, Sahib Jamal had been married to Jahangir, and was the mother of his son Prince Parviz Mirza.

Marriage In 1596 Prince Salim (future Emperor Jahangir) became violently enamoured of her, and meditated marrying her. Akbar was displeased at the impropriety. The cause of Akbar's objection was Sahib Jamal who had already been married to Salim. Akbar objected to marriages between near relations. However, when Akbar saw that Salim's heart was immoderately affected, he, of necessity, gave his consent. There was a great feast and joy. The marriage took place on the eve of 28 June 1596 at the house of Empress Hamida Banu Begum. When Jahangir ascended the throne, Khas Mahal became empress.

The company was founded in 1948 in Madison, Wisconsin by Arthur and Emily Widen, initially as Widen Engraving Co., a plate-engraving business providing printing-plates for newspapers. The company has sustained business viability and longevity by adapting its products to technological advances and business model transformation, the company now has headquarters in both Madison, Wisconsin and London, United Kingdom. History =1948 ‚Äì Widen Engraving Co. ‚Äì Founding and incorporation= In 1948, Arthur Widen and Emily Widen, spurred on by his experience working in the Madison newspaper industry and backed by her financial support in the form of a $1,500 mortgage, founded Widen Engraving Co. The business initially helped newspapers create newsprint by engraving creative and marketing materials from photographs and type onto zinc and copper plates. =1960 - 1990 ‚Äì Widen Colorgraphics Ltd. ‚Äì Prepress era= In 1960, Widen altered their business model by moving beyond the engraving process and began to undertake further prepress activities. The company converted marketing content in the form of photos, illustrations, logos and copy into printed catalogues and advertisements and commenced working with film negatives. A change in its name reflected this transformation, and the company became Widen Colorgraphics Ltd. In 1985, led by Mark Widen, son of founders Arthur and Emily Widen, the company began to focus on colour scanning and printing services. =1990 - Present day ‚Äì Widen Enterprises Inc. ‚Äì Digital asset management= With the advancement of prepress technologies and processes, under Reed Widen, son of Mark Widen, the company embraced digital technology, initially through digital printing and created an internal research and development department to innovate and keep abreast of technological developments in the industry. In 1996, Widen's R&D; department developed the company's first image database, which would become Widen's first digital asset management software. The software was made available to clients as a product in 1998. In 1997 the company changed its name from Widen Colorgraphics to Widen Enterprises Inc. Matthew Gonnering was appointed as CEO in 2009 and steered the company further towards the software as a service (SaaS) model. Widen Enterprises has since developed its software into a cloud based digital management hub that allows users to readily access and manage their digital assets. Alongside the software, the company has focused its efforts on customer experience by offering services to aid in the production and implementation of digital assets, as well as training and consultancy on the digital asset management process. Adaptability and transformation Widen has adapted to changing market demands and technological advances a number of times throughout its existence. The transformations were initially driven by a willingness to explore, embrace and invest in new technologies and subsequently by incorporating research, development and innovation into the company's internal processes. Investing in new technologies Widen's move away from engraving in the 1960s, was marked by the company's investment in film negatives and photography, such as in the purchase of the first available automated separation camera to embrace the advent of color in the printing industry. In 1985, the company invested $3 million in colour scanners and Scitex equipment, and became the largest Scitex installation in North America. Internal research and development It was the challenges that customers encountered with prepress file management for which there were no available technological solutions that prompted the company's development of new products and the forming of the internal R&D; department. The department allowed the company to pioneer image database software for image centralization and retrieval and marked the beginning of internal innovation efforts, laying the path for the company's current position as a software provider. Products =The Widen Collective= Widen's software is a cloud based centralized platform that allows businesses to manage their digital assets; including images, documents, audio and video files throughout their lifecycle from creation to distribution. The software is called the Widen Collective due to its multi-use capacity and integration of five applications: Assets, Insights, Portals, Templates and Workflow. Each application aids in a different phase of the digital management process; including a central library of searchable digital assets, tracking and analyzing the performance of each asset, a work management interface and the ability to create branded webpages. =Digital asset management services= The company has embedded elements of customer service into the functioning of their software and their digital asset management services play a prominent role in their current business model. Widen offers production services for digital assets, strategic consulting training online through their database of relevant digital management information and scheduled web conferencing as well as on-site training. =Leadership and organizational culture= Widen's current chief executive officer, Matthew Gonnering, is notable for adopting a distinctive philosophy to his leadership of the company. He encapsulates this philosophy by describing it as akin to the Greek word eudaimonia from Aristotelian Ethics meaning human flourishing, happiness and wellbeing. Indeed, Gonnering has reframed his position in the business to the Widen trademarked title of \\"Chief Eudaimonia Officer\\". He learned of the concept from a fellow student while at business school and became intrigued about adopting it as an ethical guideline and how to incorporate it in a business setting. Gonnering has championed various causes during public speaking engagements at TEDx and disruptHR; such as empathy in the workplace, the importance of embracing diversity in recruitment and employing those with developmental disabilities. In practical terms the application of the philosophy means employee wellness coaching programs, personal trainers for physical exercise and actively recruiting those with disabilities. In addition, Gonnering has led the creation of a non- hierarchical organizational culture; including continuous employee input and consultation and a democratic approach to all aspects of work and management. Widen has thus been named in the WorldBlu annual list of most freedom-centered workplaces every year from 2014 to 2019 and in 2019 reported an employee retention rate of 96%. This distinctive approach and the commitment to employees‚Äô professional and personal development led to Widen being named in Comparably's 2018 list of mid-sized companies with the best leadership and Gonnering being named executive of the year in 2019 by In Business magazine. Awards and recognition =Product awards= In 2019, Widen won ‚ÄúBest Digital Asset Management Platform‚Äù for its digital asset management software at the Marketing Technology Awards hosted by ClickZ and Search Engine Watch, where the judging panel was made up of customers and experts within the industry. In 2018 Widen's software was heralded as a ‚Äústrong performer‚Äù for customer experience by independent technology research firm Forrester, due to its intuitive user interface and based on favorable feedback from customers. Widen was named the digital asset management vendor of the year by the Codified DAM Consultant in 2017, an independent software analysis and comparison firm. In order to win this accolade, the software was assessed on the firm's ‚ÄúTen Core Characteristics of a Digital Asset Management System‚Äù. Widen was also commended for a high standard of customer support. Also in 2017, Widen won the award for the ‚ÄúBest Digital Asset Management Solution‚Äù from SIIA, an independent trade association. =Company and staff awards= Widen was named ‚ÄúCompany of the Year‚Äù in 2019 by SIIA largely due to a growth in revenue and a strong company culture. In 2018, WorldBlu, a business training organization, recognized Widen for a commitment to operating with purpose and vision and helping its employees to do the same, primarily because of their focus on employee wellness. Widen was also named in Comparably's 2017 nationwide list of best places to work, ranking 42nd for best company culture, 25th for best managers and fourth for best CEO. Also in 2017, the company was recognized in the list of the \\"100 companies that matter the most in the digital content industry\\" by the industry publication EContent.

It is the easternmost tip of Krkono≈°e, forming a broad belt of forested ridges from Horn√≠ Lyseƒçiny over the Mraveneƒçn√≠k (Anteater) hill to the Sklen√°≈ôovick√Ω hill.  Geography  R√Ωchory lies on the southeastern edge of Krkono≈°e. The main ridge is approximately 1.5 km long with the slopes included R√Ωchory are roughly 6 km long. They lie 4 km southwest from ≈Ωacl√©≈ô, 10 km north of Trutnov and 5 km east from Jansk√© L√°znƒõ. The ridge is oriented in northwest-southeast direction. The highest peak is Dvorsk√Ω les (1033 m), which forms the south- eastern ending of the main ridge and it is the easternmost One-thousander in Krkono≈°e. The north-western ending is the peak Kutn√° (1001 m) with R√Ωchorsk√° bouda mountain chalet. Between these two there are no other important peaks. A short side ridge branches to the south-west with a nameless peak of 1008 m. To the north, the pass R√Ωchorsk√Ω k≈ô√≠≈æ divides R√Ωchory from northward ridge towards the main part of Krkono≈°e. R√Ωchory constitutes the easternmost part of the Krkono≈°e Mountains National Park and thanks to their highly valuable botanical locations, the upper parts around the main ridge of R√Ωchory have been included in Zones I and II of the national park. The Dvorsk√Ω les forest in R√Ωchory preserves a remaining area of beech primeval forest, consisting of the bizarre trunks of old beech, rowan, birch and spruce trees covered with moss and is a favourite location of nature photographers. In the northern slopes of the R√Ωchory ridge and in the valley of Snƒõ≈æn√Ω potok there is a small settlement called R√Ωchory as well, which forms part of the town ≈Ωacl√©≈ô.  Gold Mining  Based on legends, written down by chronicler Simon H√ºttel of Trutnov, gold was mined on the slopes of R√Ωchory as early as 11th century, while the most important mines were founded during the reign of Duke Old≈ôich of Bohemia. First written record of gold mining is from the year 1542. Emperor Ferdinand I granted mining privileges to the market town Svoboda nad √öpou. A gold mining village Sklen√°≈ôovice was also founded in a southern valley of R√Ωchory.

Career =Early career= Oates began his career with Manly United, before signing for the Central Coast Mariners youth team in 2010. He joined up with the side for the 2010‚Äì11 pre-season, making his debut against Riverina U23s ‚Äì coming on as a substitute and scoring a goal. Oates impressed during his first season, and was handed a trial with League One side Sheffield United, but returned to Central Coast Mariners for the start of the 2011‚Äì12. In his second season with the Mariners, Oates captained the side to glory in the National Youth League, earning himself a one-year professional contract with the senior Central Coast Mariners side for their 2012‚Äì13 campaign. An ankle injury sustained during pre-season meant he was unable to break into the first team and, following further setbacks, Oates was released from his contract early. After his release from Central Coast Mariners, Oates returned to Manly United. A teammate of his persuaded him to apply to Hartpury College, England, to study, play football, and see a world outside of Australia. =Hereford= In 2015, Oates signed for the newly-formed Hereford, a phoenix club setup by fans following the demise of Hereford United.

They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. The structure at 320‚Äì322 West Ottawa is significant due to its association with Populist activist Sarah E. Van De Vort Emery, a well-known public speaker and writer of the 1880s and 1890s. History The land on which these houses sit was purchased by Sarah Emery and her son Archibald in 1885. The two houses were likely built on the lots in 1888 and 1889. Archibald Emery lived in one of the units (328) from 1888 to 1894, and in 1902 sold the entire structure to W.H. Bosley. Sarah Emery and here husband Wesley lived in another unit (320) from about 1889 to about 1891. In 1891, one half of the duplex was sold, with the Emerys retaining the other half. Sarah Emery died in 1895, and here estate sold the remaining house to Mrs. Cora Murray in 1900. In the subsequent years, the houses were used for different things, including division into apartments and offices. Description The Emery Houses are a pair of brick Second Empire-inspired double houses on a high stone foundation. They have slightly different dimensions, with 326-328 measuring roughly 44 feet wide by 40 feet deep, and 320-322 measuring roughly 48 feet wide and 45 feet deep. The apparent mansard roofs are decorative, with the actual roofs being low-pitched slopes draining toward the rear of the house. The houses have stone drip courses, decorative bands, and lintels. Stamped tin cornices top the brick, creating a small overhang topped with the false mansards. The front of 320-322 is symmetrical, with end bays protruding from the face. A high porch, not original, stretches between across the facade with a single stair access. Windows on the first floor are single pane, replacing the original double-hing units. Second floor windows are double- hung. The front of 320-322 is asymmetrical, with an octagonal bay at the corner. Each side of the octagon has a tall double-hung window. Windows on the first and second floors through the building are split about two-thirds of the way up. There are two front entrances reached through a small prch, also with two stairs.

After finishing unplaced on his only start as a juvenile and running fifth on his thee-year old debut he made very good progress and ended the year as the biggest money-winner in Britain. He demonstrated consistent top-class form to win the Sussex Stakes, Drawing Room Stakes, Great Yorkshire Handicap, St Leger Stakes and Great Foal Stakes a well as being placed in the Craven Stakes, Prince of Wales's Stakes, Ascot Derby and Champion Stakes. As four-year-old he developed respiratory problems but walked over for the Claret Stakes and was placed in both the Goodwood Cup and the Doncaster Cup. He made little impact in his short career as a breeding stallion before dying at age 11 while being exported to the United States. Background Ossian was a bay or brown horse bred and owned by William Douglas-Hamilton, 12th Duke of Hamilton. The colt was sent into training with Richard Marsh at Newmarket, Suffolk. He was sired by Salvator, the best horse of his generation in France, who was unbeaten in seven races including the Prix du Jockey Club and the Grand Prix de Paris. He was a representative of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. Ossian's dam Music also produced Poetry, the dam of Thais. Racing career 12th Duke of Hamilton, Ossian's breeder and owner =1882: two-year-old season= On his only start as a two-year-old Ossian finished unplaced in the Molecomb Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse,a race which resulted in a dead-heat between Elzevir and St. Blaise. =1883: three-year-old season= Spring Ossian began his second campaign in the Biennial Stakes over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse in April. He looked well short of full fitness and ran accordingly, finishing fifth in a six-runner race won by Grandmaster. Two days later, over the Ancaster Mile at the same track, the colt produced a much better effort in the Craven Stakes when he ran second to Grandmaster, beaten three quarters of a length by the winner. At Newmarket on 10 May he was stepped up in distance for the Payne Stakes over ten furlongs in which he finished a close third behind Splendor and Ladislas, with Grandmaster unplaced. At the Derby meeting at Epsom Racecourse Ossian contested the Epsom Grand Prize over ten furlongs in which he started at 7/1 and came home third behind Padlock and Goldfield. Summer At Royal Ascot in June Ossian ran twice over still longer distances. He started at odds of 9/1 for the Prince of Wales Stakes (then restricted to three-year-olds and run over thirteen furlongs) and after taking the lead on the final turn he finished second, a length behind the 2000 Guineas winner Galliard. In the Ascot Derby two days later, ridden by Charles Wood, he was beaten a head by Ladislas after a \\"desperate race\\" over the final furlong, with the Epsom Derby winner St Blaise in third. Later that summer at Goodwood Racecourse Ossian was dropped back to one mile for the ¬£1,337 Sussex Stakes for which he was made the 6/4 favourite. With Wood in the saddle he dominated the race in the closing stages and \\"romped\\" to victory by four lengths from Stonecrop. On the following afternoon John Watts took the ride when the colt started favourite for the ten furlong Drawing Room Stakes and won \\"in a canter\\" by four length from Henley. Later in the meeting however he was beaten a head by Blue Grass in the Racing Stakes after which bookmakers offered him at odds of 40/1 for the St Leger whilst Bell's Life described him as one of the \\"ragged rank and file\\". At York in August he carried a weight of 126 pounds fourteen furlong Great Yorkshire Stakes in which he was ridden by Watts and started at odds of 9/2. He took the lead on the final turn and held off the challenge of Chislehurst to win by a by a neck in a \\"splendid finish\\" with Ladislas two lengths back in third place. His performance re-established him as one of the leading contenders for the St Leger. Autumn John Watts,who rode Ossian to victory in the St Leger On 12 September Ossian, ridden by Watts, was one of nine three-year-olds to contest the 108th running of the ¬£4,725 St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse and started at odds of 9/1. Lord Ellesmere's Highland Chief (second in the Derby) started 5/2 favourite ahead of Royal Angus, with the other fancied runners included Elzevir (Royal Hunt Cup), Ladislas and The Prince. Ossian started well and then settled in second place behind his stablemate Cecil Craven who was acting as a pacemaker. Cecil Craven dropped back with five furlongs left to run and Ossian entered the straight with a clear advantage over Chislehurst and Highland Chief with the rest of the runners struggling to stay in contention. Chislehurst briefly looked likely to mount a serious challenge, but Ossian drew away inside the final furlong to win by three lengths. Highland Chief came home lame in third with long gaps back to the other finishers. Less than two weeks after his Leger win, Ossian started at 7/1 for the Great Foal Stakes over ten furlongs \\"across the flat\\" at Newmarket, carrying a seven-pound penalty which took his weight up to 131 pounds. The nine-runner field included Goldfield, The Prince and the Epsom Oaks winner Bonny Jean. Ridden by Watts, Ossian was always among the leaders, established a clear lead entering the last two furlongs and won by a length from Goldfield. At Newmarket on 11 October Ossian was matched against older horses in the Champion Stakes and started the 9/4 second favourite behind the five-year-old Tristan. He took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish but lost ground when swerving entering the final furlong and finished second, beaten a length by Tristan with Dutch Oven taking third. Ossian ended the year with earning of ¬£9,111, making him the most financially successful horse of the year in England. =1884: four-year-old season= On his first start of 1884 Ossian walked over for the Claret Stakes at Newmarket in April. On 31 July Ossian was matched against the outstanding three-year-old stayer St Simon in the Goodwood Cup over two and a half miles. He proved no match for his younger rival being \\"galloped into a standstill\\" and beaten 20 lengths into second place. By this point in his career Ossian reported developed breathing problems and was described as a roarer. At Doncaster in September Ossian came home third behind Louis d'Or and The Lambkin in the Doncaster Cup. On 9 October he ran for the second time in the Champion Stakes and finished fourth behind Tristan, who dead-heated for first place with Lucerne. Ossian was retired from racing at the end of the year. Stud record Ossian was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion but had little success as a sire of winners. The most successful of his offspring was probably Zenobia, who won the Preis der Diana Another of his daughters was Lady Cecil, the grand-dam of Challacombe. Ossian was sold for $10,000 in December 1890 to American turfman J. B. Ferguson, but died of exhaustion in early 1891 when the steamship he was traveling on was caught in a storm while en route to New York City.

An adaptation of Joseph Boyden's novel Through Black Spruce, the film stars Brandon Oakes, Tantoo Cardinal, Graham Greene, Tanaya Beatty, Parveen Kaur and Roseanne Supernault. The film was shot primarily in Moosonee, Ontario. Plot Annie Bird, a Cree woman from Moosonee, is the identical twin of Susanna Bird, a model who had last been seen in Toronto before disappearing with her abusive boyfriend Gus. While living with her mother Lizette, Annie is close to her uncle Will, a hunter and former bush pilot. At the invitation of a friend, Annie travels to Toronto for a vacation, but stays behind to look for her sister. When Annie leaves for their vacation, a local Moosonee drug dealer named Marius takes this as an indication that one of her family members anticipates a need to go into hiding. Marius accuses Will of being a snitch and hires associates to have him followed. In Toronto, Annie contacts Susanna's modelling agency and collects the last paycheque that she was owed. The agency refers her to Jesse, the last photographer to undertake a project with Susanna. The two meet while Jesse is debuting the resulting photo series at a local gallery. After describing the depression Susanna was in, Jesse gives Annie the address where she last stayed. There, Annie meets Violet who is the other tenant. Violet welcomes Annie and describes the shock of receiving the missing person's report for her roommate. Taking her to Susanna's former room, Violet encourages Annie to stay there for as long as necessary. Meanwhile, Marius escalates his threats against Will's family and attempts to firebomb his house at night. The police chief dismisses Will's report due to his alcoholism and inability to provide a license plate number. Taking matters into his own hands, Will later aims a rifle at Marius from afar and fires a bullet into his head. Will escapes by plane to a remote island, and encounters a group of fellow Cree travelers after setting up a campsite. After being convinced that he cannot hide forever, Will returns to Moosonee. His sister Lizette tells him that Marius survived the shot to the head, albeit with brain damage. The police chief comes to speak with Will, and initially announces that the attempted murder is being ruled as a \\"biker hit\\". However, before driving off, he tells Will to have better aim next time. Meanwhile, in Toronto, Annie begins a relationship with Jesse and offers to take Susanna's place in an upcoming photo shoot. At a club that Susanna used to frequent, Violet introduces Annie to an acquaintance named Danny. Jesse warns her that Danny is a drug dealer but Violet continues to include him in their circle of friends. Annie looks at some of Susanna's production stills and sees that signs of drug use have been photoshopped away. She berates Jesse for his dishonesty and prepares to leave Toronto. While she is telling Violet, Danny corners the two of them and reveals that he has killed Gus in an effort to reclaim stolen drugs. While choking Annie, he accuses her of conspiring with her sister to keep the stash hidden. Danny then comes to Moosonee in order to continue searching for Susanna. He throws boiling water at Lizette and beats Will with a golf club. Before he can deliver the killing blow, Annie arrives with Will's rifle. She kills Marius and Danny in time to help carry her uncle to the hospital.

The type and only species is L. shenqi, known from several partial skeletons. It is the earliest-aged neosauropod ever discovered, as well as the only definite diplodocoid from east Asia. Its exact age is uncertain, but it lived between the late Toarcian and Bajocian ages, with an midpoint estimate age of 174 Ma. Discovery Life restoration of Lingwulong shenqi In 2004, sheep herder Ma Yun found dinosaur bones, notifying local administrators Yang Huozhu and Liu Hongan. In the spring of 2005 these showed the fossils to dinosaur expert Xu Xing who sent out a team to investigate the find. From 2005 onwards several quarries ware excavated at Ciyaopu, near Lingwu, in Ningxia Hui. The remains were discovered of about seven to ten sauropod skeletons. The excavations and the subsequent preparation were carried out by Wang Haijun, Xiang Lishi, He Sicai, Cao Renfang, Tang Zhilu and Tao Yu. In 2018, Xu Xing, Paul Upchurch, Philip D. Mannion, Paul M. Barrett, Omar R. Regalado-Fernandez, Mo Jinyou, Ma Jinfu and Liu Hongan named and described the type species Lingwulong shenqi. The generic name combines a reference to Lingwu with the Mandarin long, \\"dragon\\". The specific name means \\"amazing\\" in Mandarin, reflecting the unexpected appearance of a member of the Dicraeosauridae in East Asia, a group never before identified in the region. The holotype, LM V001a, was found in a layer of the Yanan Formation dating from the Toarcian-Bajocian, very roughly about 174 million years old. It consists of the rear of a skull associated with a series of dentary teeth found in their original position. It is part of the collection of the Lingwu Museum. The paratype, LGP V001b, is a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It contains the rear vertebrae of the back, the sacrum, the pelvis, the first tail vertebra and elements of the right hindlimb. Paratype and holotype possibly represent a single individual. The paratype is displayed in the Lingwu Geopark. Several specimens have been referred to the species. IVPP V23704 is a series of twenty-nine dentary teeth. LGP V002 is a partial skeleton including vertebrae of the back and tail, the shoulder girdle, and elements of the forelimbs and pelvis. LGP V003 is a partial skeleton containing a series of vertebrae including dorsals, sacrals and the first two caudals, and both ilia. LGP V004 consists of a front neck vertebra, a front back vertebra and a right shinbone of a small individual. LGP V005 is a partial skeleton containing the sacrum, the pelvis and a series of twenty-five front and middle tail vertebrae. LGP V006 contains neck vertebrae, the shoulder girdle and forelimb elements. Additionally numerous disarticulated bones from the quarries were referred. Description Size diagram of Lingwulong shenqi Lingwulongs remains belong to 7‚Äì10 individuals at different ontogenetic stages, and even include skull bones. Overall, nearly the whole skeletal anatomy is known. Autapomorphies (unique traits) that distinguish Lingwulong from other diplodocoids include highly elaborated ornamentation along the upper margin of the orbital area, occipital condyle with transversely wide articular surface and anterior dorsal vertebrae with slightly twisted metapophyses presenting a sub-circular pseudofacet on their tip. Some traits, such as morphology of cervical vertebrae metapophyses look intermediate between the derived dicraeosaurids condition and the plesiomorphic condition spread among flagellicaudatans. Unlike most other diplodocoids, which have square-shaped snouts in dorsal view, Lingwulong had a U-shaped snout. Classification Cranial material Simplified cladogram of Flagellicaudata after Xu and colleagues (2018) is shown below: Paleobiogeography Diplodocoids were long thought to have been absent from East Asia due to the presence of the Turgai Sea, and the East Asian Isolation Hypothesis was used to explain the presence of mamenchisaurids in East Asia but not elsewhere in the world. The discovery of Lingwulong casts doubt on these paleobiogeographical assumptions by showing that diplodocoids were present in East Asia early in the Jurassic.

The brand originally existed as a line of smart home products manufactured by Elgato Systems, a company best known for a line of video-recording and gaming products. The Elgato brand and gaming division of the company was sold to Corsair in June 2018, while the main company was renamed to Eve Systems retaining the Eve brand of smart home devices.  History  alt= = EyeTV = Eve Systems introduced the EyeTV brand in November 2002. The first device was a small USB-powered device that contained a cable tuner and hardware encoder in order to convert television video into an MPEG-1 format for watching on a computer. It also had coaxial and RCA plugs to connect it with a VCR or camcorder. A 2002 article in Macworld said it was the \\"first step\\" in bridging computers and television, but at this point still had \\"some kinks\\". The next device was the EyeTV 200 released in 2004. The EyeTV 200 allowed for digital removed control and converted programing into MPEG-2. The same year, Elgato released the Eye Home media server. By 2005, several other EyeTV products had been introduced, such as the EyeTV for DTT, the EyeTV EZ and the EyeTV Wonder. In February 2016, Elgato sold EyeTV to Geniatech Europe GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shenzhen Geniatech Inc., Ltd. = Elgato Gaming = In 2012, the company introduced Game Capture HD, which connects to gaming consoles to record gameplay. It was created in response to gamers that were hacking EyeTV products for gameplay recording. In October 2014 Elgato released a new version called HD 60. It recorded in 60 frames per second and 1080p high definition video (compared to the previous Game Capture HD's 1080p30 or 720p60), whereas typical low-end video game recording devices capture in 720p and 30 frames per second.

Elgato also developed light bulbs that can respond to programming on a mobile device and respond to commands over Bluetooth. In May 2018, Elgato introduced Eve Aqua, a smart water controller. In late 2014, Elgato introduced the Smart Power battery backup for mobile devices. It communicates with the user's Bluetooth-enabled device to provide notifications and calendar reminders when it needs to be charged. = Eve Systems = When the Elgato Gaming brand was split from the company and sold to Corsair in June 2018, the company renamed itself from Elgato Systems to Eve Systems, retaining its Eve smart home brand.

Under the authority of the Belgian federal minister of Social Affairs, it is responsible for administering the country's compulsory national schemes for health insurance and disability benefits, and manages a compensation fund for medical accidents.  Organisation  The institute was founded by the law of August 9, 1963 establishing and organizing a scheme for compulsory insurance for medical treatment and benefits, which came into force on January 1, 1964. The law of 1963 has since been replaced by the law of July 14, 1994 regarding the compulsory insurance for medical treatment and benefits coordinated on July 14, 1994. The institute's health and disability insurance budget for 2017 amounted to more than 37 billion euros.  Activities  * Health insurance: the NIHDI makes rules concerning the reimbursement of costs for health services and establishes standard prices. It manages and allocates the national budget for health reimbursements. The effective reimbursement of health service costs to patients is done by the different health insurance organisations that exist in Belgium (called mutualities). The NIHDI also inspects the correct application of reimbursement rules. * Disability benefits: the NIHDI makes rules about the conditions required to receive benefits in case of labour incapacity caused by illness or injury, motherhood, fatherhood or adoption, establishes the amount of those benefits, and manages the financial support to incapacitated persons who want to start working again. It also combats disability fraud (a form of welfare fraud) by for example checking whether people receiving disability benefits are not working and secretly receiving a wage. Just as with health reimbursements, the effective payment of benefits to entitled people is done by the mutualities. * Medical accidents: the NIHDI manages the Fund for Medical Accidents and examines whether victims of a medical accident have a right to compensation from the fund.

A Tale of Two Cities was a speech delivered by New York Governor Mario Cuomo on July 16, 1984, at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, California. The speech galvanized the convention; it was watched on television by nearly 80 million people and received copious attention in the media. Less than halfway through his first term as governor, Cuomo was widely celebrated for the speech, and he took on new political cachet as a Democratic leader on a national scale.  Background  Mario Cuomo was elected Governor of New York on a Democratic Party ticket in 1982. In his inaugural address, he constructed Democratic values metaphorically as caring for a family. The speech was well received by members of both the Democratic and Republican parties and displayed Cuomo's skill as an orator. Throughout his first year as Governor Cuomo supported numerous liberal policies even as conservatism was growing in popularity, garnering him national attention. A presidential election was scheduled to take place in the United States in November 1984. President Ronald Reagan was a popular conservative and was widely projected to win reelection. Though the country had endured economic hardship early on in his term, by 1984 the situation had begun to improve. In March 1984 Gary Hart, a senator seeking the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidential election, openly citing inspiration from Cuomo, stated, \\"I'd like to talk about the family of America.\\" The governor, however, had endorsed leading candidate Walter Mondale. Mondale inquired as Cuomo's interest in joining his campaign to seek the Vice Presidency. Cuomo stated that he had promised to finish his four-year term as governor, but indicated that he would not be opposed to delivering the keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention (DNC) in San Francisco, California. Mondale thought he was the best choice for the role, as he believed Cuomo could win him the support of Italian Americans as well as the so-called \\"Cuomo majority\\", a coalition of black, Hispanic, white liberal, and labor unionist voters that supported his gubernatorial campaign. Others hoped Cuomo could win over Democrats who had voted for Reagan in 1980 as well as independent voters. The governor had promised former President Jimmy Carter that he would assist Mondale (Carter's Vice President) any way he could, and Mondale told him, \\"If you want to help me, you'll give the speech.\\" Cuomo did not believe he had a high enough national profile for such an event and felt that Senator Edward M. Kennedy would make for a better speaker. Mondale expressed disdain towards the suggestion. Michael Del Giudice, the governor's chief of staff, urged Cuomo to accept the offer, believing it was a good opportunity for him to express his beliefs and a chance to bolster Mondale's support. Del Giudice felt that even if the speech had an unimpressive reception, it would not cause Mondale's campaign significant harm. David W. Burke thought delivering the keynote was a bad idea and cautioned against it. Cuomo's son, Andrew, and his communications director, Tim Russert, shared the governor's anxieties that a bad performance would reflect poorly on him and damage his own political prospects. Nevertheless, they encouraged him to take up the role of keynote speaker. Kennedy was upset that Mondale did not want him to be the keynote speaker and stated that the person chosen for the role should be among the Democrats who had remained neutral during the presidential primaries. Cuomo agreed in principle, and told Mondale's staff that if he were ultimately made keynote speaker it would have to be made clear to Kennedy that Cuomo had thought he was a better fit and that he had been chosen at the behest of Mondale. On the evening of June 20, Kennedy called Cuomo over the phone. Cuomo stated that he had turned down Mondale's offer and tried to convince him to select the senator instead. Kennedy said he had heard from Mondale's aides that Mondale wanted Cuomo to give the speech, and said \\"I am calling, Mario, to say I think you should say yes. I can't think of anyone better...if they get back to you, you ought to say yes. I will do whatever they want me to do.\\" By the end of the conversation, Cuomo was persuaded to accept the role of keynote speaker. An hour later he received a phone call from Mondale and DNC Chairman Charles Manatt. According to Cuomo, he then realized they had coordinated with Kennedy to try and convince him to deliver the keynote. The governor wrote in his diary, \\"They tried very hard to sound warm, sincere, and endearing, and none of it worked.\\" Cuomo accepted Mondale's renewed offer, though he voiced his belief that the candidate had made a mistake. Cuomo was officially announced as the DNC keynote speaker on June 21. He was the first New Yorker to be designated the role since Martin H. Glynn in 1916. Andrew Cuomo and Russert reviewed footage of past convention keynote addresses to devise a strategy for maximizing the speech's resonance with the audience. Mario Cuomo spent several days sifting through various ideas and determining his argument. He penned a draft on July 7. Lawyer Mark J. Green and journalist Jack Newfield both offered suggestions for the language. Cuomo read numerous versions aloud in the dining room of the New York State Executive Mansion to his advisers and went through up to 60 different drafts before he was \\"comfortable\\" with the work. When he felt it was nearly finished, he presented it to his staff in the press room of the governor's office in 2 World Trade Center. They were unmoved, so he revised his argument by moving his criticism of Reagan's policies from the middle of the speech to the beginning. Cuomo delivered it again, but Andrew voiced his concern that the ending was not rhetorically potent. Cuomo's chief speechwriter, Peter Quinn, then read through the governor's diaries to find a life event he could write about. Quinn settled on incorporating a story of Cuomo's father, an Italian immigrant, working long shifts at his grocery store until his feet bled.  Prelude  Cuomo arrived in San Francisco around 12:00am on July 15. Later in the morning he went to the George R. Moscone Convention Center, the venue for the DNC, to rehearse his speech. He sat in the empty convention hall and made several late edits to the transcript‚Äîthe copy supplied for the teleprompter was marked with numerous hand-written revisions. The governor told the press \\"It won't be a tub-thumper but rather a methodical attempt to deal with the issues. I'm not good at bringing people to their feet. I'm going to try to bring people to their senses.\\" The address was scheduled for July 16, and it would be Cuomo's first major appearance on national television. He was introduced in a fashion unusual for the time: before he took the stage, a six-minute film about his upbringing in New York was played. Andrew Cuomo and Russert, having observed the ambivalence of the crowds in past convention footage and fearing it would impact television viewers' reception, believed the video would make the audience more attentive to the governor's speech. Following the introduction, the lights in the convention center darkened and a single spotlight tracked Cuomo as he walked over to the podium. This was also designed to capture the audience's focus, as well as to force the television news cameras to follow the governor instead of panning over the crowd. The Secret Service agents providing security thought dimming the lights would leave the convention more vulnerable to a gunman and objected. Andrew Cuomo argued with them by the control room operator to have the action carried out. The governor later said that he was \\"not happy about being there\\" and \\"very eager to get it over with\\".  The speech  Cuomo's address was entitled A Tale of Two Cities. It was 4,308 words in length. Cuomo opened by invoking his family rhetoric, emphasizing the inclusiveness and openness of his message. He dismissed \\"the stories and the poetry\\" for which he was well known and declared his intent to be forthright: Cuomo proceeded to bring his audience's attention to a recent statement by Reagan at a campaign event and aimed to highlight a contradiction he saw in the president's use of the phrase \\"shining city on a hill\\": Cuomo then attacked Reagan's rhetoric by using imagery to craft an actuality in stark contrast to his vision. He listed specific, dramatic examples of exceptions to the president's notions: He subsequently addressed Reagan directly, sardonically calling him \\"Mr. President\\", and encapsulating his own message of vast inequality in America in a metaphorical allusion to Charles Dickens's novel, A Tale of Two Cities: Cuomo followed by suggesting that Reagan was unfamiliar with the realities of most Americans' lives and listing places‚Äîlocations where people had not benefited from economic recovery‚Äîhe could go to view such realities. This undermined the president's credibility and conjured up a series of emotional images. He utilized anaphora for emphasis: Cuomo paused as the audience applauded. He sarcastically utilized spin to accuse Reagan of explicitly endorsing the philosophy of Social Darwinism: Cuomo proceeded to compare Republicans to President Herbert Hoover, whose tenure was marked by the Great Depression and who was widely perceived as having done little to assist those struggling economically. By drawing a parallel, the governor was suggesting the Republican Party‚Äîand by extension, Reagan‚Äîwould do just as much: He then brought the Democratic Party into his discussion and asserted‚Äîusing extensive imagery with an analogy of a wagon train‚Äîthat it more genuinely upheld family values. He also alluded to the biblical phrase, \\"The meek shall inherit the earth\\", to further attack Republican philosophy: Enunciating his claim that Democrats supported family values, Cuomo invoked Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äîwidely admired by Democrats‚Äîhighlighting his efforts as president and suggesting that his physical disability would make him a victim of Republican policy. He also emotionally celebrated Democratic social accomplishments: Conceding Reagan's strengths as a communicator, the governor provided a plan for Democrats to garner electoral support and returned to the \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" theme: Next Cuomo, invoking the biblical Tower of Babel, warned against factitious disagreement and urged Democrats to support party unity. He used alliteration for emphasis: The address was interrupted 52 times by applause.  Aftermath and reception  The audience enthusiastically applauded the address. As Cuomo descended from the stage, he asked his son, \\"How'd it go?\\" Andrew grabbed his shoulders and responded, \\"They love you!\\" Though many journalists attempted to interview him, Cuomo departed in the evening and flew back to the Executive Mansion in Albany, New York. He later attributed the apparent success of the speech to the audience, saying that while they had \\"devastated\\" the speakers before him, when he took to the podium \\"they were all looking at me silently. It wasn't that I captured them. They were ready.\\" An estimated 79 million people saw the address on television. Cuomo received hundreds of letters of praise for his convention performance. James Reston wrote that it was \\"brilliant...with every word, gesture, expression and pause in harmony.\\" In a July 21 analysis of the DNC, Dudley Clendinen of The New York Times wrote \\"Governor Cuomo's speech showed it was possible for a Democrat to combat President Reagan on television with philosophy and metaphor, that passion could be the party's engine and oratory its modern weapon.\\" Murray Kempton of Newsday remarked that \\"For a little less time than it takes a subway from Far Rockaway to Manhattan, Mario Cuomo had taken all the broken promises and put them together shining and renewed, and he had restored the Democratic Party to virginity.\\" Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, expressing disappointment over the substance of the speech, asked Colorado Governor Dick Lamm, \\"C‚Äômon, what did it really say about the issues we‚Äôre trying to raise?\\" Conservative reception of the speech was much less positive. William Safire remarked that it was \\"the best-delivered keynote address since the days of Alben Barkley‚Äîdevoid only of humor...[Cuomo] almost succeeded in giving compassion a good name.\\" Robert Reno of Newsday labeled it \\"standard bleeding heart doctrine.\\" Columnist George Will wrote that Cuomo deserved a \\"C for substance, A for delivery,\\" adding, \\"Cuomo did what a keynote speaker is supposed to do...style being ten times more important than content on such occasions, he convinces the conventioneers that they are the children of light, destined to push back the darkness.\\" A spokesman for the Reagan presidential campaign stated that the speech was \\"a well-crafted litany of cheap shots and half-truths.\\" Nevertheless, Reagan deemed Cuomo's rhetorical appeals to working-class voters to be of threatening strength and re-orientated his campaign to ensure their support. Reagan defeated Mondale in a landslide in the November election. Richard Greene opined that due to this fact and that many of the issues Cuomo highlighted were not subsequently addressed, the speech failed in its immediate goal.  Legacy  According to Walter Shapiro, Cuomo's address \\"defined‚Äîfor then and now‚Äîwhat it means to be a liberal.\\" Michael Waldman said it was \\"as powerful a statement of core, traditional, liberal Democratic philosophy as you'll ever get.\\" Representative Nancy Pelosi called it \\"one of the top ten speeches in history.\\" Andrei Cherny wrote, \\"A hundred years from now, if there is one speech that people will study and remember from a Democratic politician in the last quarter of the 20th century, it will rightly be Cuomo's 1984 address. It is hard to overstate the impact it had on a generation of the party's speechwriters, strategists and policy thinkers.\\" He opined that the address was wholly lacking in actionable promises and was too focused on the Democratic Party's past accomplishments. Likening it to William Jennings Bryan's 1896 Cross of Gold speech which, though well received, was not conscious of impending modernization and did not lead to political success, he concluded that \\"The lengthened shadow of Cuomo's address has contributed to inhibiting the growth of a new, unifying, positive appeal that puts progress back at the heart of progressivism.\\" Michael A. Cohen wrote in 2015, \\"[D]on‚Äôt call it a great 'political' speech...what's often forgotten about Cuomo's speech is that in reflecting the core beliefs of the Democratic Party he was decidedly out of tune with the tenor of the times.\\" He added, \\"[H]owever...there is an increasing sense that the two cities of which Cuomo spoke are the defining construct of American life, circa 2015. His unapologetic liberalism might have fallen flat politically in 1984, but it might be even more relevant today.\\" Jeff Shesol called the oration \\"Mario Cuomo's finest moment\\". Quinn said \\"[I]f Mondale had given that speech, no one would have ever remembered it.\\" Cuomo died on January 1, 2015. Most of his obituaries mentioned the address. Hundreds of people subsequently shared YouTube video of it over social media.

Lucy Raffety continues her role as series producer while Simon Harper remains as the executive producer. Kate Oates became the show's senior executive producer from October 2018, and was promoted to Head of Continuing Drama six months later. Raffety's resignation from her position was announced on 16 April 2019. Raffety confirmed that there would be a series 33 in an interview with TVTimes, where she billed the series as the \\"Year of the Paramedic\\". In preparation for the series, two new paramedic characters were introduced to the drama. It was announced on 24 July 2018 that the series would begin on 11 August 2018 with an episode described as \\"one of [the] biggest episodes in the show's history.\\" It was previously revealed, in May 2018, that the show was filming scenes which would feature a motorway crash and a petrol tanker turning on its side. Sophie Dainty of entertainment website Digital Spy reported that there would be an explosion, which would leave one main character's life \\"hanging in the balance\\". An official statement from the show stated that the ED's paramedic crew would \\"face their darkest day\\" in the episode. Charlotte Salt, who portrays Sam Nicholls, told Elaine Reilly of What's on TV that the episodes were filmed at night over two weeks with night shoots lasting over 13 hours. On the atmosphere on-set while filming, she commented, \\"there's a certain buzz in the air...\\" The episode sees Sam die after suffering a fatal bleed from the crash, which sparks a new story for Iain as he struggles to cope with his grief. A show trailer, released on 12 August, teased \\"a new era\\" for the hospital following Sam's death. The trailer previewed Iain's guilt, the appearances of Zsa Zsa and Omo, Eddie facing trial for Alicia's rape, and upsetting scenes for Charlie and Duffy. On 16 November 2018, it was revealed via Casualty official Instagram page that the show would be receiving a new set of titles. The revamp came into effect from episode 13, which aired on 17 November 2018, replacing the show's former titles, which were introduced back in series 31. = Crossovers = This series features crossover events with Holby City sister show Casualty. In August 2018, Raffety told Dainty (Digital Spy) that Harper enjoys the crossover events between the two dramas and wanted to produce more. She also teased some \\"extremely exciting crossovers\\" within the series. In a December 2018 interview with Dainty, Harper promised further crossovers between Holby City and Casualty, and teased an \\"exciting\\" event to be aired in spring 2019. Holby City cast member Alex Walkinshaw (Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher), who appeared in Casualty between 2012 and 2014, makes a crossover appearance in episode 31. Holby City actor Guy Henry appears as Henrik Hanssen in the crossover event, and then again in the series finale. On 15 February 2019, it was announced that Casualty would crossover with spin-off series Holby City for two episodes, billed as \\"CasualtyXHolby\\", in March as part of the year-long twentieth anniversary celebrations for Holby City. The episodes are billed as \\"dramatic [and] action-packed\\". Both episodes were written by Michelle Lipton and directed by Steve Brett. The episodes see the hospital attacked by a cyber-virus, destroying all electric systems. A predominant story in the episodes follows Connie and Holby City character Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) saving the lives of colleagues after two separate major incidents, despite only having one available theatre. Harper described the episode as \\"pure, nail-biting, taut, emotional medical drama\\". He also praised the production teams of both shows for their logical creation of the episodes, and looked forward to exploring the interactions between the characters from the two shows. Nine Casualty cast members - Mealing (Connie Beauchamp), Durr (David Hide), Stevenson (Iain Dean), Ryan (Gem Dean), Mohan (Rash Masum), Jafargholi (Marty Kirkby), Griffiths (Elle Gardner), Marshall (Noel Garcia), and Hill (Ruby Spark) - feature in the Holby City episode of the crossover, originally broadcast on 5 March 2019. The Casualty episode of the crossover, episode 26 of this series, features the Casualty cast alongside twelve Holby City cast members - Marcel (Jac Naylor), Bob Barrett (Sacha Levy), Hugh Quarshie (Ric Griffin), Guy Henry (Henrik Hanssen), Catherine Russell (Serena Campbell), Alex Walkinshaw (Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher), Kaye Wragg (Essie Di Lucca), Jaye Jacobs (Donna Jackson), Marcus Griffiths (Xavier \\"Xav\\" Duval), Nic Jackman (Cameron Dunn), Camilla Arfwedson (Zosia Self), and Belinda Owusu (Nicky McKendrick) - and two Holby City guest actors - Francesca Barrett as Beka Levy and Naomi Katiyo as Darla Johnstone.

History In the fall of 1967, Tupelo instituted a \\"choice\\" system, whereby students at all-white Tupelo High School and all-black Carver High School were given the opportunity to choose which school to attend. While no white students chose Carver, Dowsing was one of five African-American students who chose to attend Tupelo High School, and was the first to play football. Unlike school integration in many other areas of Mississippi and the South, this was a peaceful event. Because of a broken jaw, which had been wired shut, Dowsing was unable to speak or practice football at the beginning of school. His first action was for the B team, where he scored a touchdown on the opening play. Dowsing earned all conference honors in football, basketball, and track, and graduated sixth in his class. He also set a state record by running the 100 yard dash in 9.5 seconds. Due to recruitment efforts by former Tupelo resident and future Mississippi State basketball coach Kermit Davis, he enrolled at Mississippi State, where he was also the first black football player. At MSU, Dowsing was an all-American as a defensive back, an academic all-American, and was elected Mr. Mississippi State by his fellow students. This was the first time a black student had won any sort of election at the school. Just before graduation, he married LaFawn Gilliam in the Chapel of Memories at Mississippi State. Upon graduation, Dowsing was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles, but instead chose to fulfill a lifelong dream by attended medical school at the Mississippi University School of Medicine. Within two years of their marriage, Dowsing was divorced, and dropped out of medical school in his third year. This was probably largely due to a secret: Dowsing was gay. Dowsing then worked for Bell Telephone in California, until he was diagnosed with AIDS in the late 1980s. He died of the disease in 1994. In 2010, Dowsing was inducted into the Mississippi Hall of fame, where he was nicknamed \\"The Jackie Robinson of Mississippi\\". In 2017, Mississippi State dedicated a plaza at the football stadium to Dowsing.

It was launched in November 1875, the same year as the Portland Daily Bulletin disincorporated; like the Bulletin, it had both daily and weekly editions. It initially had two daily editions, and circulated 1,000 free copies. Though fairly short-lived, the paper has been described as \\"a journal of force and influence in its time.\\" It was quoted, and its contents syndicated, in numerous contemporary newspapers in its region,Daily Capital Journal, 1878Think link and Grant County News, 1879this link and Corvallis Gazette and contemporary papers also published general praise for the Bee.Albany Register, 1876Daily Astorian, 1877 Several of the many owners, publishers, and editors it had during its short tenure were family relations of the editors of other major newspapers of the time, the Oregonian and the New Northwest. Shortly after the paper launched, and after its first ownership transfer, its editor engaged in an extended editorial battle with the editor of a rival paper, and ultimately killed him in a duel. D. H. Stearns, the paper's founder, repurchased the Bee following the scandal, and emphasized the change in leadership in advertisements in newspapers around the state. Following another ownership change, the Bee was renamed the Bulletin in August 1880 and discontinued in 1882. The Oregon Historical Society acquired archival copies of the Bee upon its incorporation in 1898.  Leadership  A few months after Mercer killed MacDonald, the Bee emphasized its new leadership and presented itself as the \\"most complete and reliable farmers paper published on the Pacific Coast. Advertisement published in the Douglas Independent, in several editions in December 1878. Bee founder Doran H. \\"Don\\" Stearns had a background in journalism in his native Nebraska, and married into a prominent news family in Portland in the same year he started the Bee: his wife, Clara Belle Duniway, was the only daughter of New Northwest founder Abigail Scott Duniway, and niece of longtime The Oregonian editor Harvey W. Scott.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23461594/clara-belle- stearnsPortland, Oregon: Its History and Builders/Volume 3/John Tucker Scott Alfred Holman, later an editor of the Oregonian, started his newspaper career at the Bee in 1876. In the early 1880s, Bee editor James K. Mercer engaged in an ongoing war of words with A. C. MacDonald of the Telegraph, through the columns of both papers. The conflict escalated to a duel, with Mercer fatally shooting MacDonald in 1878. Mercer went to prison for 15 years after McDonald died due to the effects of a duel with Mercer. W. S. Chapman, a Portland city surveyor and son of Oregonian founder William W. Chapman,https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/147665268/winfield-scott-chapman bought the paper from Stearns, but later sold it back to him. He was the owner and editor at the time of Mercer's altercation with McDonald. A contemporaneous article in the Oregonian about McDonald's death described the Bee as a \\"deadly stench to all decent people who come in contact with it.\\" Upon his return to the Bee, Stearns hired his wife's aunt, Catherine Amanda Coburn, who edited the paper from 1879 to 1880. Coburn had previously worked for her sister's paper, the New Northwest.The Souvenir of Western Women/Mrs. Catherine A. Coburn Upon her hire at the Bee, Coburn became one of the few 19th century women editors of a daily newspaper in the western United States. She soon moved on to the Oregonian. The paper also got a new printing press in 1879. In February 1880, the Corvallis Weekly Gazette published glowing praise for the Bee and for owner Stearns. Stearns sold half his interest in the Bee to C. L. Packard in 1879,As reflected in an advertisement published in the Oregonian: and the remainder to Atkinson & Farrish in 1880. The Bee was renamed the Bulletin in August 1880 and discontinued in 1882. It was the third Portland paper to carry the name \\"Bulletin\\"; Atkinson had launched the first, which lasted only a few months, more than a decade prior.

He won several European Rowing Championships and was set to go to the 1912 Summer Olympics when his team was banned from competitions for a year. Family Del Giudice was born on 23 November 1888 in Venice; the rower and architect Brenno Del Giudice was his twin brother. Their parents were Vincenzo and Giuditta Del Giudice ( Zuanelli). Rowing career Like some of his brothers, he became a rower for the Venetian rowing club Francesco Querini named for the polar explorer who died in 1900. Del Giudice won the 1904 Venetian Championships in a coxed four when he was still just 15 years old. Others in that team included Ercole Olgeni and Emilio Fontanella. The same team became Italian champion at the 1905 regatta in Como. That success qualified them for the 1905 European Rowing Championships in Ghent where they won silver, beaten by the team from Belgium. In the 1906 season, Del Giudice rowed in a coxed pair with Olgeni and coxswain Giuseppe Mion. They became Italian champions and then beat the famous Belgian pair of Guillaume Visser and Urbain Molmans to take the 1906 European title in Pallanza. In 1908, Del Giudice became Italian champion in both the coxed pair (again with Olgeni and cox Mion) and the coxed four. At the 1908 European Championships, he won silver in the coxed pair (this time beaten by the Belgians Visser and Molmans) but the coxed four became European champion. In 1909, Del Giudice teamed up with Luigi Ermellini in the coxed pair; G. Mion remained as coxswain. Del Giudice became Italian champion in the coxed pair, the coxed four, and the eight. The 1909 European Rowing Championships were held in Paris and Del Giudice won gold in the coxed pair and the coxed four. When the men's eight started, most of the rowers had already been part of the earlier boats that day and the team was beaten by the French who, apart from Gaston Delaplane, rowed their first competition that day; the Italians had to settle for silver. In 1910, Del Giudice became Italian champion in both the coxed pair and the coxed four. At the 1910 European Rowing Championships in Ostend, he won gold with the coxed four. At the 1911 European Rowing Championships held on Lake Como, the judges have difficulty in deciding on the winner of the coxed four and eventually award gold medal to the Swiss team, with the Italian team including Del Giudice getting silver. With the eight, he won gold at those championships. In 1912, the Italian selection in the men's eight was decided between the two Venetian clubs ‚Äì Bucintoro and Querini. There was a collision and a scuffle broke out between the rowers. Both clubs were banned from competitions for one year by the Italian Rowing Federation and Italy's Olympic appearance in the eight was cancelled. After WWI, Del Giudice competed at the 1921 European Rowing Championships in Amsterdam alongside his younger brother Curzio Del Giudice in the coxed pair but they finished outside the medals. Scipione Del Giudice then retired from competitive rowing and trained a junior eight at his club. He was later a rowing coach in Greece. Del Giudice died in 1950.

Function  The ANO5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called anoctamin-5. While the specific function of this protein is not well understood, it belongs to a family of proteins, called anoctamins, that act as chloride channels. Chloride channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) in and out of cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Most anoctamin proteins function as chloride channels that are turned on (activated) in the presence of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions); these channels are known as calcium-activated chloride channels. The mechanism for this calcium activation is unclear. Anoctamin proteins are also involved in maintaining the membrane that surrounds cells and repairing the membrane if damaged. The anoctamin-5 protein is most abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. The regulation of chloride flow within muscle cells plays a role in controlling muscle contraction and relaxation. The anoctamin-5 protein is also found in other cells including heart (cardiac) muscle cells and bone cells. The anoctamin-5 protein may be important for the development of muscle and bone before birth. Diseases associated with ANO5 mutations Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2L (LGMD2L) and Miyoshi Distal Myopathy 3 (MMD3) These forms of muscular dystrophy are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that to be affected a person must have mutations on both copies of the gene, and males and females are equally likely to be affected. Clinically, LGMD2L and MMD3 were considered different diseases before ANO5 was identified as the responsible gene; LGMD was used to describe initial weakness in proximal muscles (near the center of the body) while MMD to describe initial weakness in distal muscles.

Yarshater p.209 sq =Siege of Amida (359 CE)= Historian Khodadad Rezakhani suggests that Peroz was at the Siege of Amida in 359 CE, where a Kidarite army under Grumbates is known to have supported the Sasanian army of Shapur II in besieging the city held by the Romans. In his account of the siege, Ammianus Marcellinus describes in detail the costume, and in particular the headgear of one of the besieging rulers: Peroz and his characteristic headgear with ram horns, may have been observed at the Siege of Amida by Ammianus Marcellinus in 359 CE. This ruler is traditionally held to be Shapur II, although Ammanus Marcellinus doesn't expressly say so, and Shapur's traditional headgear, a crenellated crown, is very different. The headgear with ram's horn would rather correspond to that of Peroz as seen on many of his coins in the Sasanian style. Ammianus Marcellinus also mentions that the king, whom he assumes to be Shapur, was called \\"Saansaan\\" and \\"Pirosen\\" by the Persians, which could actually refer to \\"≈†ƒÅhan≈°ƒÅh Pƒìr≈çz\\", the ruler of the eastern Hunnic tribes (Chionites, Gelani, and Sagistani).‚ÄúPersis Saporem saansaan appellantibus et pirosen, quod rex regibus imperans et bellorum victor interpretatur.‚Äù (Amm.

The various vessel making up the ensemble were found in Vrap, Albania, and have been attributed to the Avar people. The Avars were a nomadic people from the steppes of Eurasia who arrived in the Balkans in the 6th century AD. Being a warlike people, the Avars warred with and subjugated much of the local population, and occasionally clashed with the Byzantine Empire. Through these conquests, the Avars were able to amass considerable amounts of treasure, some of which was buried en masse near Avar settlements. The origin of the treasures found is disputed; some posit that the Avars were themselves skilled metalworkers, while others believe that the valuable objects (including gold jars, cups, and dishes) found in Avar hoards were made in Byzantium and then either looted or given as tribute to the Avars. The ensemble housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was recovered from the Albanian village of Vrap (which rose to international prominence in 1902 when a cache of Avar gold and silver was found in the village) in the early 20th century and given to the museum by J. P. Morgan Jr. in 1917. The ensemble consists of several gold cups, a silver bucket, several drinking dishes and a jug.

He is known for his work on seaweeds of the Pacific Coast, as well as on freshwater algae and fungi, and among his publications is the important reference work Algae of Northwestern America. Education Gardner was born in Keokuk, Iowa, and began his career as an Iowa schoolteacher. After earning a teaching degree at the Washington State Normal School in Ellensburg (now Central Washington University), he went on to teach for a time in that state. He also began collecting plants, which led him to write to the University of California for help with identification and preservation of specimens. This put him in contact with William Albert Setchell, who headed the botany department at UC Berkeley (UCB) and later worked closely with Gardner as a colleague and coauthor. Gardner subsequently enrolled at UCB to study marine algae and other cryptogams, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 1900., a Master of Science degree in 1903, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1906. Career After receiving his Bachelor degree, Gardner was hired as an assistant in botany by UCB, where he worked with W. J. V. Osterhout. Upon completion of his doctoral studies in 1906, he began teaching at the Los Angeles Polytechnic High School, where he was head of biology. He took a year's leave from this job to serve as an acting assistant professor of botany at UCB (1909‚Äì10) and then was hired full-time by UCB as an assistant professor in 1913. He rose to associate professor in 1923 and retired from UCB in 1934. He was also the curator of the University Herbarium. Gardner became known for his expertise in Pacific Coast seaweeds, as well as for his work with freshwater algae and fungi. He published extensively on the morphology and taxonomy of blue-green algae (on which he was recognized as a world authority) as well as red and brown algae. In addition to plant collecting and other kinds of field work, he developed special methods for cultivating algae in the lab. Although he often coauthored papers with Setchell, he also published some 30 solo-authored papers. An important contribution to American botany was the multi-volume reference work Algae of Northwestern America, on which he collaborated with Setchell. Issued by the University of California Press, the first volume came out in 1903 and the last in 1925. Publications *Cytological studies in Cyanophyceae.

It stars Miles Robbins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Sasha Lane, Mary Stuart Masterson, Hannah Marks, Chukwudi Iwuji and Peter McRobbie. Daniel Isn't Real had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 9, 2019. It was released on December 6, 2019, by Samuel Goldwyn Films in select theaters and digitally. Plot As a child, shy and troubled Luke witnesses the aftermath of a mass shooting at a neighborhood coffee shop. He meets another boy among the onlookers at the scene: cool and confident Daniel, who invites him to play and quickly becomes his friend. Although adults such as Luke's mother, Claire (Mary Stuart Masterson), cannot see Daniel, he appears physically real to Luke. The boys become close playmates, and their connection helps Luke cope with his parents' divorce. Their friendship comes to an abrupt end when Daniel convinces Luke that blending an entire bottle of Claire's psychiatric medication into a smoothie will give her superpowers. Instead, it results in a near-fatal poisoning. Claire convinces Luke to send Daniel away by symbolically locking him in her mother's old dollhouse. Years later, the college-aged Luke (Miles Robbins) is paralyzed by anxiety over his future, his social life and his responsibility to his mother, who struggles with paranoid delusions and a hatred of her own reflection. He confides to his therapist, Dr. Cornelius Braun (Chukwudi Iwuji), that he is afraid he will eventually become just like her. One night, while sleeping over at his childhood home, Luke unlocks the dollhouse. Daniel (Patrick Schwarzenegger) reappears as an adult. His influence initially appears benign as he helps Luke thwart Claire's suicide attempt, succeed in school, and begin a romance with an artist named Cassie (Sasha Lane). However, he quickly starts exhibiting aggressive behavior, becoming enraged when Luke doesn't obey him. When Luke won't have sex with a psychology student named Sophie (Hannah Marks) on a date, Daniel forcibly takes over his body, has rough sex with Sophie and attacks Luke's roommate. Luke is banned from campus as a result and begins to question his own sanity, believing he may have schizophrenia. He attempts to banish Daniel back to the dollhouse but is unsuccessful. Luke becomes increasingly unstable, convinced that Daniel is taking over his body while he sleeps. He visits the father of John Thigpen, the shooter whose crime began the film, and learns John also had an invisible friend named Daniel. Luke begins to realize Daniel is a supernatural entity, not an imaginary friend. Dr. Braun makes a late-night house call in an attempt to separate Luke and Daniel, but only succeeds in allowing Daniel to take over Luke's body and banish Luke's consciousness to the dollhouse. Daniel then kills Braun. He decides his next target will be Cassie. Daniel reveals his true nature to Cassie, describing himself as \\"a traveler,\\" before chasing her to the rooftop of her apartment building. Cassie begs Luke to come back to reality; hearing her from inside the dollhouse, he summons the will to escape. In a final confrontation with Luke, Daniel claims he has helped people for centuries, but none of them has deserved his help. Luke calls him a parasite. Luke realizes he and Daniel can never truly be separated. After ensuring Cassie has escaped to safety, he kills himself by jumping from the roof. Cassie lies down beside his body. Daniel, surrounded by an otherworldly darkness, reverts to his true monstrous form, implying he will now seek out a new host.

The southern shoreline is rocky with a concrete sea wall constructed upland, while the northeast end of the beach is characterized by the entrance to Narrow River and Cormorant Point. The state beach offers picnicking, ocean swimming, changing rooms, surfing, and beach activities for approximately the first half mile of the beach, while the northeast end remains privately owned. The beach and dunes provide an important wildlife habitat for certain species of shorebirds, including piping plovers. History Narragansett Beach, with some bathers, by L. H. Clarke The town of Narragansett acquired the privately owned beach area, with the exception of the Dunes Club at the north end of the beach, in the aftermath of the Great Hurricane of 1938 - with the town recommending ownership of the beach on Jan 13, 1939. This was followed by a unanimous vote by 250 participants to acquire and operate the beach on March 24, 1939. Advertisement of the beach to the public began on June 2, 1939, and generated revenues of approximately $14,000 in 1940. By the 1960s, the beach drew approximately 130,000 annual visitors, creating a hub for the local economy. By 2011, the beach has become the destination for as many as 10,000 visitors per day, with an average annual net income of approximately $270,000. On July 23, 1947, the Chamber of Commerce endorsed the construction of breakwaters at each end of the beachfront, with the Narragansett Planning board recommending the construction of a 750-foot jetty to be constructed on the southern end of the beach, on March 11, 1949, to address erosion issues - an ongoing and historic issue for the beach.

It was described by Frost in 1989. It is found in the Arctic and surrounding waters. There are multiple generations. Unlike some copepods, P. newmani undergoes reverse diel vertical migration, descending during the night, and ascending during the day, although it may undergo normal or no migration at all depending on predation. This copepod is primarily herbivorous. Taxonomy P. newmani was originally described by Frost in 1989 from multiple samples caught in the main basin of Puget Sound. Its specific name references Bill H. Newman. Description Female P. newmani usually range in length from about , and the male is generally between about . The female is distinguished from other species by its rounded cephalosome, which is barely anterior to the rostrum. It is also distinguished by its urosomal segments being the longest in its genus relative to cephalosome length. The male is distinguished by having a ratio of basal to coxal segments of the fourth leg being less than 1.5. Additionally, the male lacks sensilla on the mediodorsal portion of the second to fourth urosomal segments. Distribution P. newmani is found in the Arctic, the northern Pacific, and in the Atlantic off of the eastern coast of Canada and Maine. It is also found in the Hudson Bay. Ecology =Life cycle and reproduction= In Toyama Bay, P. newmani reproduces and actively grows between February and April. During this time, there are three generations. The period of reproduction and growth corresponds to the time when water temperatures are lowest at the top (around ), and the abundance of phytoplankton reaches its maximum. Females can generally produce anywhere from one to four eggs per day when breeding. In Toyama Bay, after a reproduction event in 1990, there were no copepods of this species found until November. This corresponded with surface water temperatures above . This, along with a lack of large lipid stores, likely indicates that it cannot migrate to cooler waters and enter diapause. Additionally, it develops quicker in warmer waters until temperatures of at least . At Dabob Bay, the population recovery occurs earlier, around July. The abundance of this copepod, at least in the Dabob Bay, is related to the abundance of predators, especially the predatory chaetognath Sagitta elegans. P. newmani usually undergoes reverse diel vertical migration, ascending in the day, and descending in the night, a reversal of normal diel vertical migration. The reason for this is because of predators (such as omnivorous copepods that have normal diel vertical migration) being more abundant during the night. When predators are not present in large numbers, it usually does not descend at night, instead constantly staying at the surface. This has fitness benefits, as clutches developed in deeper waters have decreased survivorship. But, when predators are found at the surface during the day, P. newmani experiences normal diel vertical migration. It can switch between migration strategies quickly, sometimes in under five weeks. As a whole, this migration (normal or otherwise) does not seem to be undertaken by copepodite stage I through III, likely because they have lower mortality rates. When predation is not a factor, this copepod prefers to reside in the layers with the most chlorophyll a. =Feeding= P. newmani is mainly herbivorous, and feeds continuously, with an increased intake during the night. It prefers centric diatoms, even though aldehydes of the diatom genus Thalassiosira, for example, can be toxic to its young in large quantities. This is seen in the reduced reproductive success (both in terms of hatching success and naupliar viability) of P. newmani fed exclusively diatoms in the laboratory, and the reduced success of this copepod during Thalassiosira blooms. =Predators= P. newmani has multiple predators, and adjusts its behaviour around them. One predator is the copepod Euchaeta elongata, which (in females, as least) likely can consume 19 adults of P. newmani each day. The chaetognath Sagitta elegans, another predator of this copepod, can ingest up to about five females per day. An adult Euphausia pacifica can attack, on average, about two female P. newmani per day. Three-spined stickleback, juvenile chum salmon, and other planktivorous fish can attack this copepod. In response to the normal diel vertical migration of predators like Euchaeta elongata, it performs a reverse diel vertical migration so as to not co-occur in depth with feeding predators. It may also perform normal diel vertical migration when visually-reliant predators are more important, and no migration when predators do not have a large enough effect.

It is run by Sample News Group. History Launched as a Federalist weekly on September 21, 1805, its founder McDowell sold the paper in 1832, to George W. Bowman, a Jacksonian Democrat who supported James Buchanan, a fellow Pennsylvanian Democrat. Early on, the paper developed a reputation for fanning the flames of racial hatred. An article in 1837 claimed that free blacks, under the influence of Thaddeus Stevens, had broken into the voting polls, and threatened to shoot those trying to stop them from voting. During the Civil War, they lamented that the Fugitive Slave Act was not being enforced in Pennsylvania. Bowman in turn sold the operation to Benjamin Franklin Meyers in August 1857. Myers, a disciple of Stephen Douglas and supporter of Buchanan, was hailed by his contemporaries as a gifted literary stylist with a \\"trenchant pen\\", though more recent evaluations have noted that his vitriolic editorials and articles vilifying Lincoln and abolition \\"make for difficult reading today.\\" His reputation with Buchanan was such that when Buchanan was being pressured to run for President again in 1859, he chose to announce his rejection of those calls in a letter sent to the Gazette. In 1974, the paper made headlines when Representative Bud Schuster, who had been the target of a number of investigations by the Gazette, offered to buy paper, in what some saw as an attempt to silence reporting. In 2000, the paper was sold by the Frear family to the Sample family for an undisclosed sum.

It has loosely spaced, upright, greyish, narrowly egg-shaped to line-shaped leaves, mostly without teeth and flattened globe-shaped flower heads of 5‚Äì7 cm (2‚Äì2¬æ in) across, consisting of mostly creamy, seldom yellow flowers, that curve in the bud to the center of the head. From the center of the flowers emerge curved styles that jointly give the impression of a pincushion. The common name in English is Redelinghuys pincushion. It only occurs in a very small area in the Western Cape province of South Africa. It flowers between July and October. Unlike in related species the flowers are pollinated by hairy-footed gerbils and striped field mice.  Description  Leucospermum arenarium is a low spreading shrub of up to ¬æ (2¬Ω ft) high and 1‚Äì1¬Ω m (3‚Äì5 ft) in diameter, that grows from a single trunk at its base of 4‚Äì5 cm (1¬Ω‚Äì2 in) thick, covered with a smooth grey bark. The flowering stems are lax, arching and drooping to the ground, sometimes even trailing. The leaves on the flowering stems are loosely spaced, upright, narrowly egg-shaped to line-shaped, 6‚Äì8 cm (2¬Ω‚Äì3¬º in) long and about 7 mm (¬º in) wide, mostly with an entire margin, rarely with two or three teeth near the tip, the base slightly wedge-shaped and twisted, greyish due to a dense layer of fine crisped hairs. The flower heads are flattened globe-shaped, 5‚Äì7 cm (2‚Äì2¬æ in) in diameter, mostly individually set but sometimes grouped in pairs at the end of the drooping branches, each on a very short or short stalk of up to 4 cm long. The common base of the flowers in the same head is flattened, wide cone-shaped, both about 1¬Ω cm (0.6 in) long and wide. The bracts that subtend the head are carmine-red in colour, oval with a pointy, sometimes slightly hooked tip, 8‚Äì10 mm (0.32-0.40 in) long and about 6 mm (0.24 in) wide, papery inconsistency, covered in very fine powdery hairs, which can be lost with age, and the edges set with a regular row of straight equal hairs. The bract that subtends each flower individually is inverted lance-shaped with a suddenly pointed tip (acuminate), about 12 mm (0.48 in) long and 4 mm (0.16 in) wide, cartilaginous in consistency, with a very densely woolly base and a silky-hairy tip. The 4-merous perianth is mostly pale cream-coloured, rarely golden yellow, 2‚Äì2¬Ω cm (0.8‚Äì1.0 in) long, very strongly curved towards the center of the head while in the bud. The lowest, fully merged, part of the perianth, called tube is about 7 mm (0.28 in) long, cylinder-shaped, hairless at the base, but with soft, long hairs higher up. The middle part (or claws), where the perianth is split lengthwise and sigmoidally coils tightly when the flower opens, is thinly covered in powdery to felty hairs, except for the hairless lobe facing the center of the head. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud consists of four line- to narrowly lance-shaped lobes with a pointy tip of about long, which are covered in silky hairs. The yellow anthers lack a filament and are directly fused to the limbs, narrowly lance-shaped to linear, with a pointy tip and a pointed expansion at the tip. From the perianth emerges an initially pale ivory to greenish-yellow (eventually pinkish carmine) style of 3‚Äì3¬Ω cm (1.2‚Äì1.4 in) long that is tapering towards the end, strongly bent to the center of the head. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is greenish near the tip, cylinder-shaped with a pointy tip and about 2¬Ω mm (0.1 in) long, with a groove acting as the stigma across the tip. The ovary is subtended by four awl-shaped, opaque scales. The flowers are nutty to yeasty scented. = Differences with related species = L. arenarium can be distinguished from other species of sandveld pincushion by its long, inwardly curved, C-shaped styles of 3‚Äì3¬Ω cm long, the mostly creamy, relatively large inflorescences of 5‚Äì7 cm across, the papery involucral bracts with pointed and hooked tips, and its lax arching and drooping habit.  Taxonomy  As far as is known, a Mrs. M.L. Thomas was the first to collect the Redelinghuys pincushion in August 1958. Hedley Brian Rycroft described the species in the following year. L. arenarium has been assigned to the section Leucospermum. The species name arenarium is Latin and means ‚Äúof sandy places‚Äù.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  Habit. Phjoto by Nick HelmeThe Redelinghuys pincushion can be found near the Piketberg where it grows on a level plain at 120‚Äì150 m (400‚Äì500 ft) altitude, between the Mierberg and the Klein Tafelberg (approximately midway between Redelinghuys and Aurora). The rather widely scattered plants grow in deep white Tertiary sands, in a vegetation that also contains other Proteaceae such as Leucadendron pubescens and Serruria fucifolia, large tufts of the Restionid Willdenowia lucaeana, Rhus rosmarinifolia and Erica (Griesebachia) species. In this area, the average annual precipitation is 250‚Äì380 mm (10‚Äì15 in), which mainly falls during the winter. The flowers are pollinated by rodents. Hairy-footed gerbils Gerbillurus paeba, and striped field mice Rhabdomys pumilio were observed to visit the flowers of L. arenarium, and both carried its pollen on forehead and breast. L. arenarium nectar is thick and is present in a cup-like structure at the tips of the perianth lobes. Here, mice can lick it off without having to damage the flowers. While the styles are rather short and straight in the insect-pollinated relatives, the Redelinghuys pincushion has much longer styles that curve strongly towards the center of the head, making the pollen transfer to the mice more effective. The nectar is produced by the scales subtending the ovary as in other Leucospermum species, but is transported by capillary ducts to the tips of the perianth. These adaptations have developed from an ancestor that was adapted to insect pollination, like its nearest relatives. These have narrow perianth tubes, unlike the wide tubes of species specialised for thick bird bills. Remarkably, L. arenarium retained the narrow tube, to make use of its capillary mechanism to transport the nectar. For L. arenarium, rodent pollination is more effective than insect or bird pollination, even though a larger part of the pollen is lost due to the mice grooming their fur. This is probably the result of a larger dedication of the rodents compared to insects and birds. After the fruits fall from the plants about two months after flowering, these are collected by native ants who transport them to their underground nests. Mature plants do not survive the wildfires that naturally occur in the sandveld, a type of fynbos in which the Redelinghuys pincushion can be found, but it revives from the seeds that remained safe underground.  Conservation  The Redelinghuys pincushion is considered a critically endangered species. It is estimated that 50% of its habitat was already lost due to agricultural expansion by 1992 and a further 30% by approximately 2010. Climate models predict that the suitable habitat for this species will have vanished by 2025.
