The Church of the East honours both St. Zay'ā and St. Tāwor for their missionary efforts in northern Iraq and the region of Upper Dāsen (modern Hakkâri province, Turkey) during the late 4th and early 5th centuries. He is also the patron saint of travellers and the Jilu district, where he is buried, and is invoked for protection from hail, famine, plague, anger, illness, disease and the Angel of Death. St. Zay'ā is often depicted in miniatures from manuscripts of the Book of Protection as an equestrian saint, spear in hand, and attacking the Angel of Death. Tradition and legend Death and remains Veneration According to the calendar of the Church of the East, the birth of St. Zay'ā is celebrated on May 26, and a three-day rogation (fast) precedes the commemoration of his death on the first Wednesday of January. Traditionally, the Assyrians of Jilu celebrate the Feast (Syriac: Shahrā) of St. Zay'ā on September 13 every year on the Feast of the Cross. The reason given for this is that the Saint's other festivals fell on dates when the weather was too cold for pilgrims to be able to travel to the main shrine for the celebration. Often, the Jilu District was snowed in for six months of the year. Holding the Saint's Feast day on September 13, when the weather was more agreeable, not only meant that they could take advantage of the brighter light of moon at night, it also meant that those Jīlū men who planned on travelling before the first snows could pray for a safe and successful journey and make their vows to the Saint before departing. Other feasts to the Saint are also celebrated by the Assyrians of Arbūsh (Tell-'Arbush) and Halmon (Tell-Jum'ah) in the Khabur district of Syria, as well as by Assyrians from the Amadiya district of Iraq, and some Assyrians from the Urmia region of Iran. A prayer commonly attributed to St. Zay'ā is: This prayer appears in a shorter form in the Saint's Vita, and also in different versions of the Book of Protection, from which amulets and talismans were copied.

In late 2011, it was released on the iOS App Store. Players must rebuild their shattered neighbourhoods after their destruction by a zombie apocalypse. The game was praised by reviewers for its graphics and gameplay. By July 2014, the Facebook version had over 2.2 million likes, and as of April 2014 it has been licensed to RockYou while the developers from Digital Chocolate were hired to continue to work on the game. Gameplay Play centers on farming and rebuilding the destroyed neighborhood, with the game beginning at the end of the world. The player's character has lost their spouse and dog, who need to be located, and the dilapidated shack which used to be their home is the only building left standing. The player is given advice by a character called Rob the Rent-a-Cop, and must deal with the encroaching zombies as well as restore the neighborhood. The player begins with a shovel as their only weapon, but in time can create makeshift weapons from collected objects and obtain firearms. Rubble and debris litters the game area, and must be cleared before the player can plant crops, which in turn can be converted into food which restores energy. Combat involves clicking on zombies in order to attack them. Should the player be attacked by a zombie their character will be momentarily stunned, no other penalties are incurred. Enemies become more difficult to defeat as the game progresses. When enemies are defeated they disappear, despite the game's setting combat is slapstick in nature rather than overtly violent. Zombies drop items when defeated, with different types of zombies dropping different items. The door-to-door salesman zombies drop sporting goods, whereas zombies that were formerly shop employees drop household goods. The game's plot is minimal, instead tasks are given in order to achieve overarching goals such as locating the player's spouse. These tasks can involve defeating a set number of opponents within a time limit, or producing crops, and will either be single challenges or connected to the larger goals. As the player progresses, they access additional play areas some of which have a more linear plot progression. Reception Zombie Lane was praised by reviewers in terms of its graphics and gameplay. Gamezebo's Andrew Webster stated \\"Zombie Lane sports smooth and charming 3D visuals, with distinct characters and solid animation. The soundtrack, too, has a very fitting horror crossed with comedy vibe.\\" He compared the game to FrontierVille, stating \\"The core game may not be all that original, but Zombie Lane still feels like a fresh experience.\\" Seattle Post-Intelligencer writer Josh Sprague Stated \\"..it’s actually a lot of fun to pump lead into some zombies while you’re waiting for your strawberries to ripen.

He was born Robert Jeremiah Ormsby and changed his name by deed poll. Mahuta was the first Māori leader to negotiate a satisfactory compensation settlement with the New Zealand government for tribal land confiscated under European settlement in the fledgling colony. In a deal completed in late 1994, he won a package worth NZ$170m for his Tainui tribe for the seizure of 485,000 hectares of land in the North Island's Waikato region 131 years earlier. Significantly for all Māori, the settlement included the first formal apology given by the Crown to the indigenous people for historical wrongs during colonisation. Family He was born Robert Jeremiah Ormsby in Te Kuiti, New Zealand, on 26 April 1939. His father, also Robert Jeremiah Ormsby, was part-Māori. His mother was Te Amohia Ormsby, and her mother was Piupiu Te Wherowhero, a leader within the kahui ariki (Māori royal family). Piupiu was a daughter of Te Wherowhero, the younger son of King Tāwhiao. Robert Ormsby was adopted by King Korokī at four weeks old, and became the brother of Princess Piki, later the Māori Queen, Dame Te Atairangikaahu. He changed his name by deed poll to Robert Te Kotahi Mahuta when he was 24. Mahuta married Raiha (née Edmonds) in 1964 and had one son and two daughters. His eldest is a son Tukaroto Mahuta (who has three sons and a daughter). His elder daughter, Nanaia, is a Labour MP (and has one son) and his younger daughter is Tipa (who has one daughter and a granddaughter). Career Mahuta was the director of Māori Studies and Research at Waikato University from 1972 to 1977. He studied at Wolfson College, Oxford, in 1977. Mahuta served as a Treaty of Waitangi fisheries commissioner, chairman of the Māori Development Corporation and chairman of the Tainui Māori Trust Board. For his services to the Māori people, he was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 1996 Queen's Birthday Honours. Tributes He died in Hamilton aged 61. Robert Mahuta was a \\"warrior in the true sense\\", said former Member of Parliament Sir Douglas Graham. \\"Sir Robert's achievements are unsurpassed, irrespective of the troubles in recent times,\\" said former Minister of Māori Affairs, Parekura Horomia.

In 1180 the cathedral compound turned into the cathedral close (; i.e. cathedral immunity district), forming an exclave of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen within the city of Hamburg. By the Reformation the concathedral was converted into a Lutheran church. The cathedral immunity district, since 1648 an exclave of the Duchy of Bremen, was seized by Hamburg in 1803. The city then prompted the demolition of the proto-cathedral between 1804 and 1807.  Location  The cathedral, in common Italo-Nordic tradition simply called Dom (), which is the synecdoche, used – pars pro toto – for most existing or former collegiate churches and cathedrals in Germany alike.Therefore the uniform translation of these terms into English as cathedrals may not always be appropriate. The cathedral was situated in the section of the earliest settlement of Hamburg on a geest hill between the rivers Alster and Elbe near street. Today's St. Peter's Church was erected right north of the Dom, today's Domstraße crosses through the former site of the cathedral. Curienstraße recalls the location of the canons' courts. History The early history of the Hamburg See and its first cathedral buildings is somewhat obscured. In different struggles on competences and privileges plenty of documents have been completely forged or counterfeited or backdated, in order to corroborate arguments. \\"These forgeries have drawn a veil before the early history of the [archbishopric of] Hamburg-Bremen.\\"The original quotation: \\"Diese Fälschungen haben einen Schleier vor die Frühgeschichte Hamburg-Bremens gezogen.\\" Heinz- Joachim Schulze, \\"Geschichte der Geschichtsschreibung zwischen Elbe und Weser vom Mittelalter bis zum Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: Mittelalter (1995), pp. 1–21, here p. 6\\\\. . Addition in edged brackets not in the original. Results of archeological excavations could not clarify the succession of early cathedral buildings before 1035. Ansgar, founder of St. Mary's, copy of a depiction, originally hung in the cathedral, now in St. Peter's. A wooden mission church is reported for 831. Pope Gregory IV appointed the Benedictine monk Ansgar as first archbishop as of 834. After the looting of Hamburg and the destruction of the church by Vikings under Horik I in 845 the archdiocese was united with the Diocese of Bremen in 847. Hamburg remained the archiepiscopal seat. The deposed Pope Benedict V was carried off to Hamburg in 964 and placed under the care of Archbishop Adaldag. He became a deacon then but died in 965 or 966 and was buried in the cathedral.Erich Verg and Martin Verg, Das Abenteuer, das Hamburg heißt, Hamburg: Ellert & Richter, 42007, p. 15. . In 983 Prince Mstivoj of the Obodrites destroyed city and church. In 988 Benedict's remains were presumably transferred to Rome. Archbishop Unwan started reconstructing a fortified cathedral.Heinz-Joachim Schulze, \\"Die Grafen von Stade und die Erzbischöfe von Bremen-Hamburg vom Ausgang des 10. bis zur Mitte des 12. Jahrhunderts\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II 'Mittelalter (einschl. Kunstgeschichte)': pp. 43–104, here p. 53\\\\. . Under Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg (1043–1072) Hamburg-Bremen attained its greatest prosperity and later had its deepest troubles. Adalbert was after Hamburg-Bremen's upgrade to the rank of a Patriarchate of the North and failed completely. Hamburg was even dropped as part of the diocesan name. With the investiture of Archbishop Liemar the seat definitely moved to Bremen. However, the cathedral chapter of Hamburg persisted with several special rights. Around 1035 Archbishop prompted the construction of a first cathedral from brick and his castle.Heinz-Joachim Schulze, \\"Die Grafen von Stade und die Erzbischöfe von Bremen-Hamburg vom Ausgang des 10. bis zur Mitte des 12. Jahrhunderts\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II 'Mittelalter (einschl. Kunstgeschichte)': pp. 43–104, here p. 54\\\\. . In the same century St. Peter's Parish Church was established north of the cathedral compound. However, starting in 1245 Adalbrand's structure was replaced by a new early Gothic three-naved hall church erected by chapter and Prince-Archbishop , one of the few incumbents of the united see looking for a balanced performance in Bremen and Hamburg, preferring the title Bishop of Hamburg when staying in the diocesan territory right of the Elbe, as is known from seals and documents.However, he already accounted for the reversion of the original ranking using left of the river Elbe the title Archbishop of Bremen. Prince- Archbishop Burchard Grelle consecrated the church as archdiocesan concathedral on 18 June 1329. By the end of the 14th century the concathedral was extended by two more naves. After this, the concathedral remained mostly unchanged until its demolition by 1807. The tower was completed in 1443. In the early 16th century an additional hall, first mentioned as the Nige Gebuwte (Low Saxon for new building) in 1520, was erected closing the adjacent cloister towards the north. This hall was presumably used for sermons, the actual cathedral for masses. The hall was later colloquially called Schappendom after the cupboards (Low Saxon: ), which carpenters of Hamburg exhibited there. The traditional fayre at Christmas, recorded for the square in front of the cathedral since the 14th century, and continued as today's funfayre Hamburger Dom (literally in Hamburg Cathedral), then used to take place within the Schappendom hall. Starting in 1522 Lutheranism spread among the burghers of Hamburg, gaining their vast majority by 1526, while most canons of the cathedral chapter rather clung to Catholicism, enjoying their extraterritorial status. Hamburg's Senate (city government) accounted for the new facts and adopted the new denomination in 1528. So when in October 1529, the senate – wielding its advowson – appointed Johannes Aepinus (d. 1553) as Lutheran pastor at the neighbouring St. Peter's Church, in order to introduce Johannes Bugenhagen's Lutheran Church Order in the city, Aepinus contested with the prevailingly Catholic cathedral chapter.This contest gave rise to his Ioannis Hepini Pinacidion de Romanæ ecclesiæ imposturis et Papisticis sutelis/ aduersus impudentem Hamburgensium Canonicorum autonomiam, Hamburg: Georg Richolff the Younger, 1530. St. Peter (centre) and St. James (right). The extraterritorial status and the denominational opposition strengthened the perception of cathedral, chapter, and immunity district as alien element within the city. While almost all inhabitants outside the immunity district had become parishioners of the now Lutheran parish churches, the huge cathedral lacked a congregation. Between the Feast of the Assumption of Mary and December 1529 the city's militia barred churchgoers from access to the cathedral, given up after imperial protests.Jana Jürgs, Der Reformationsdiskurs der Stadt Hamburg: Ereignisabhängiges Textsortenaufkommen und textsortenabhängige Ereignisdarstellung der Reformation in Hamburg 1521-1531, Marburg an der Lahn: Tectum, 2003, p. 95. . Furthermore, the capitular estates in Hamburg and spread all over the North Elbian diocesan area, forming the endowment to maintain canons and cathedral, were increasingly withheld by the respective territorial rulers. Thus in May 1531 the chapter closed the cathedral and its maintenance was neglected. Meanwhile, the majority of the capitular canons had adopted Lutheranism and elected fellow faithful to eventual vacancies. The cathedral reopened as Lutheran place of worship in 1540. The disputes on capitular estates were regulated by the Bremen Settlement in 1561. The church turned into a Lutheran proto- cathedral and the remaining endowment allowed financing excellent ecclesiastical music, making the proto-cathedral a frequented venue for Lutheran services accompanied by music. The incumbents of the Bremen See used to be themselves Lutherans since the accession of Administrator Henry of Saxe- Lauenburg in 1569. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 transformed the Prince- Archbishopric of Bremen, an elective monarchy, into the hereditary monarchy of the Duchy of Bremen, in personal union with Sweden until 1712/15, since 1715 with the House of Hanover. Thus the immunity district turned into a ducal Bremian enclave in the city. Hamburg Cathedral, seen from east, during demolition in 1806 The architect carried out maintenance works in 1759/1760. Due to the weak, unstable subsoil the cathedral tower was leaning, so Sonnin straightened the tower, as he had done with other church towers in Hamburg, he even demonstrated the gathered public his new technique by reversing it to leaning and again straightening it.Section \\"Sonnins Experimente am Turm des Doms\\", p. 3, on: St. Marien-Dom Hamburg (website of New St. Mary's Cathedral), retrieved on 21 June 2011. Since 1772 the city of Hamburg considered to buy the immunity district, however, not effectuating any changes by then. On the instigation of the ducal Bremian government the cathedral chapter sold its valuable library by the end of the 18th century. Since 1790 the pastorate of the proto-cathedral remained vacant. By the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss in 1803, mostly causing the secularisation of many religious states of the Holy Roman Empire, the Duchy of Bremen ceded its and Hamburg, to these free imperial cities. With the neglect of the proto-cathedral by the ducal government it had dropped out of Hamburg's cultural life again. Hamburg's Senate, then holding the ius patronatus to all other Lutheran parish churches had no usage for an additional church, which did not even have the parishioners to maintain it. So in 1802, the Senate, always upholding the city's vital mercantile interests, ordered Hamburg's Gothic proto-cathedral to be pulled down, a decision which aroused no serious opposition within the city and which was carried out between 1804 and 1807. The stones were sold off or used to reinforce the sea defenses along the Elbe; the funerary sculptures and monuments were broken up and used in the reconstruction of the city's rudimentary sewage system. The Senate was partly motivated by the desire to rid the city of an extraterritorial institution, but it is more than possible that the rise in rents and the high demand for housing at the time also played a role. In any case, the incident was typical of the celebrated Philistinism of the Hamburg authorities. Five more medieval churches in the city were pulled down between 1807 and 1837.Richard J. Evans, Death in Hamburg: Society and Politics in the Cholera Years, 1830-1910, New York: Penguin, 2005, p. 36\\\\. . Legacy =Rescued furnishings= There was little interest in the valuable furnishings of the proto-cathedral. Few enthusiasts with interest in the history of art did not prevail as to rescuing the building. In order to make the biggest bargain not only the structures above earth have been demolished and sold as construction material but even the grave slabs and most of the fundaments have been dug out to be sold alike. The more than 370 slabs of sandstone have mostly been built in hydraulic structures along the many waterways in Hamburg, broken stones and rubble were used for dikes in Ochsenwerder and Spadenland.Section \\"Abriss des Mariendoms\\", p. 4, on: St. Marien-Dom Hamburg (website of New St. Mary's Cathedral), retrieved on 21 June 2011.

Glass windows of the cathedral, built in in Ludwigslust. Sherd of Pope Benedict V's cenotaph, Hamburgmuseum. The rescue of some furnishings we owe to Philipp Otto Runge, prevailing in the merchant republic of Hamburg with the argument, that they could be sold as well. So the Late Gothic cathedral altarpiece, created by Hamburg's famous artists Absolon Stumme and his stepson Hinrik Bornemann, however, only finished, after their deaths in 1499, by Wilm Dedeke were rescued and sold to East Prussia. In 1946 the altarpiece was nationalised and is now shown in the National Museum, Warsaw. The congregation of Hamburg's St. James the Greater Church acquired the St. Luke Altar from the furnishings of the proto-cathedral, now presented in the second southern nave of St. James. Several 15th-century stained glass windows of the apostles were sold to the Catholic congregation of Ludwigslust and are now built in the quire of , erected 1803–1809. One of the cathedral bells survived. The Celsa, founded by the bell founder Gerhard van Wou in his workshop on Glockengießerwall in 1487, was bought in 1804 by the Lutheran congregation of in Altengamme, now a part of Hamburg.HARRI (pseudonym of Harald Richert), \\"Die älteren Kirchenglocken des ehemaligen Amtes Bergedorf\\", in: Lichtwark-Heft No. 69 (2004), Hamburg: Verlag HB-Werbung, . Remnants of Pope Benedict V's cenotaph, which was erected around 1330, but removed in 1782, have been found, besides other findings, in the excavation campaigns (1947–1957, 1980–1987 and 2005–2007).Joseph Nyary, \\"Papst-Grab: Stein-Fragment entdeckt\\", in: Hamburger Abendblatt, 16 August 2005, retrieved on 21 June 2011. =Hamburger Dom= A fair held in or in front of the cathedral was first recorded in 1329, at the beginning only at special feasts like Christmas, thus being one of the predecessors of today's Christmas markets. With the Reformation in the 16th century the fair was also held on other occasions. After the demolition of the cathedral (1804–1807), the fair, still named Hamburger Dom (literally in ) moved to Gänsemarkt square (geese market) in 1804, and takes place on Heiligengeistfeld since 1892. =The cathedral site after its demolition= Former cathedral site with the archeological park and the steel imitations of the walls of the presumable original fortified church, St. Peter's in the background. After its demolition the cathedral site remained empty until Carl Ludwig Wimmel and erected a new building between 1838 and 1840 for Hamburg's most renowned Gymnasium, the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums. This building was later given to Hamburg's , but destroyed in the Allied Bombing Operation Gomorrah in summer 1943. Since the rubble was cleared in 1955 the site remained again empty, crossed by a new thoroughfare named Domstraße (Cathedral Street). A recent project to rebuild the site with a modern glass steel complex has been dropped after civic protest in 2007. Since 2009 an archeological park covers the site.Axel Tiedemann, \\"Auf dem Domplatz entsteht ein neuer Park\\", in: Hamburger Abendblatt, 30 January 2008, retrieved on 21 June 2011. Steel elements indicate the former walls of the early fortified church supposed to have been the original form of the archiepiscopal see. 39 white benches indicate the likely locations of the former columns of the 5-naved main hall. A single found fundament of one of them can be seen through a glass screen.Domplatz eröffnet: Grüner Ruhepol mitten in der Stadt (6 May 2009), press release on behalf of the Behörde für Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt (BSU) (Hamburg's ministry for urban development and environment) archived on: Hamburg.de, retrieved on 21 June 2011. =Modern Hamburg Cathedral= In 1994 a new Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hamburg was founded. On this occasion the 1893-erected Catholic St. Mary's Church in Sankt Georg neighbourhood became the New St. Mary's Cathedral.  Notable people active at the Dom  = Archbishops, prince-archbishops and administrators = The incumbents of the Hamburg-Bremen See were usually titled Archbishop of Hamburg and Bishop of Bremen between 848 and 1072, thereafter Hamburg was mostly dropped as titular element, however, some later archbishops continued the tradition of naming both dioceses until 1258. The Lutheran incumbents holding the see since 1569, were officially titled Administrators, but, nevertheless, colloquially referred to as prince-archbishops. = Chapter and canonry = The cathedral chapter was founded in 834 and its members, the canons (Domherr[en]) enjoyed personal immunity from jurisdiction of the secular local rulers. The chapter wielded the ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the North Elbian part of the archdiocese, to wit Hamburg, Ditmarsh, Holstein, and Stormarn. Thus until the breakthrough of the Reformation the chapter appointed the priests serving in the city's parishes. Cathedral, chapter and canonry were maintained by numerous prebends comprising urban real estate and feudal dues and soccage collected from dependent farmers in many so-called capitular villages in the afore-mentioned areas. Holsatian aristocracy and Hamburg's patriciate provided for most of the canons. At Archbishop Adalgar's (888–909) instigation Pope Sergius III confirmed the amalgamation of the Diocese of Bremen with the Archdiocese of Hamburg to form the Archdiocese of Hamburg and Bremen, colloquially called Hamburg-Bremen, and by so doing he denied Cologne's claim as metropolis over Bremen. Sergius prohibited Hamburg's Chapter to found suffragan dioceses of its own. After the Obodrite destruction of Hamburg in 983 the chapter was dispersed. So Archbishop Unwan appointed a new chapter with twelve canons, with three each taken from Bremen Cathedral chapter, and the three colleges of Bücken, Harsefeld and Ramelsloh. In 1139 Archbishop Adalbero had fled the invasion of Rudolph II, Count of Stade and , who destroyed Bremen, and established in Hamburg also appointing new capitular canons by 1140.Heinz-Joachim Schulze, \\"Die Grafen von Stade und die Erzbischöfe von Bremen-Hamburg vom Ausgang des 10. bis zur Mitte des 12. Jahrhunderts\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II 'Mittelalter (einschl. Kunstgeschichte)': pp. 43–104, here p. 95\\\\. . With the archdiocese gaining princely sovereignty as an imperial estate of the Holy Roman Empire in 1180, the compounds of the Hamburg and Bremen cathedrals with chapterhouses and capitular residential courts () turned into Cathedral Immunity Districts (), forming exclaves of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen of imperial immediacy. After the Bremen Cathedral chapter, overlooking the three enfranchised Hamburg capitulars, had elected Valdemar of Denmark archbishop in 1207, Bremen's cathedral dean Burchard of Stumpenhusen, who had opposed this election, fled to Hamburg, then under Danish influence.Adolf Hofmeister, \\"Der Kampf um das Erbe der Stader Grafen zwischen den Welfen und der Bremer Kirche (1144–1236)\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II 'Mittelalter (einschl. Kunstgeschichte)': pp. 105–157, here p. 123\\\\. . King Valdemar II of Denmark, in enmity with his father's cousin Archbishop Valdemar, gained the Hamburg chapter to elect Burchard as anti- archbishop in early 1208. Lacking papal support King Valdemar II himself invested him as Archbishop Burchard I, however, only accepted in North Elbia. In 1219 the Bremen Chapter again ignored the Hamburg capitulars, fearing their Danish partisanship and elected archbishop.Adolf Hofmeister, \\"Der Kampf um das Erbe der Stader Grafen zwischen den Welfen und der Bremer Kirche (1144–1236)\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II 'Mittelalter (einschl. Kunstgeschichte)': pp. 105–157, here p. 140\\\\. . In 1223 Archbishop Gebhard reconciled the Hamburg chapter and stipulated that three of its capitulars were enfranchised to elect with the Bremen chapter, to wit the provost, presiding the chapter, the dean (Domdechant) and the magister scholarum, in charge of the education at the cathedral school.Adolf Hofmeister, \\"Der Kampf um das Erbe der Stader Grafen zwischen den Welfen und der Bremer Kirche (1144–1236)\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II 'Mittelalter (einschl. Kunstgeschichte)': pp. 105–157, here p. 141\\\\. . Pope Honorius III confirmed this settlement in 1224, also affirming the continued existence of both chapters. Canons were distinguished as younger (canonicus minor) and older (canonicus maior) office holders. The distinction was also evidenced by lower and higher prebends. Johann Rode the Elder served as provost between 1457 and 1460.Michael Schütz, \\"Die Konsolidierung des Erzstiftes unter Johann Rode\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II 'Mittelalter (einschl. Kunstgeschichte)': pp. 263–278, here p. 263\\\\. . The known historian Albert Krantz, also serving the city of Hamburg as diplomat, gained a canonicate of the lector primarius in 1493.Heinz-Joachim Schulze, \\"Geschichte der Geschichtsschreibung zwischen Elbe und Weser vom Mittelalter bis zum Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: Mittelalter (1995), pp. 1–21, here p. 6\\\\. . In 1508 he advanced to Cathedral Dean (Domdechant) of the chapter. Krantz applied himself with zeal to the reform of ecclesiastical abuses, but, though opposed to various corruptions connected with Catholic church discipline, he had little sympathy with the drastic measures of John Wycliffe or Jan Hus. Krantz generally agreed with Martin Luther's protest against the abuse of indulgences, but refused Luther's theses on his deathbed in December 1517. One canonicate, called magister scholarum, was in charge of the education at the cathedral school. 1499 served as magister scholarum, was appointed magister scholarum in 1550. After the breakthrough of the Reformation canonicates were not necessarily bound to ecclesiastical offices any more, but often served to maintain educators, musicians or scientists. In 1513 the Ditmarsians founded a Franciscan Friary in Lunden to thank their then national saint patron Mary of Nazareth, fulfilling a vow taken before the Battle of Hemmingstedt in case they could defeat the Dano-Holsatian invaders, however, the Hamburg chapter demanded its say in appointing the prebendaries.Thies Völker, Die Dithmarscher Landeskirche 1523–1559: Selbständige bauernstaatliche Kirchenorganisation in der Frühneuzeit, section 'Konfliktauslöser: Besetzung der Pfarrstellen und Klosterprojekt', posted on 16 July 2009 on: suite101.de: Das Netzwerk der Autoren. After years of dispute, the Council of the 48, the elected governing body of the farmers' republic of Ditmarsh, decided to found a Gallicanist kind of independent Catholic Church of Ditmarsh in August 1523, denying Hamburg's capitular jurisdiction in all of Ditmarsh.Thies Völker, Die Dithmarscher Landeskirche 1523–1559: Selbständige bauernstaatliche Kirchenorganisation in der Frühneuzeit, section 'Gründung der Landeskirche 1523', posted on 16 July 2009 on: suite101.de: Das Netzwerk der Autoren. The chapter could not regain the jurisdiction, including its share in ecclesiastical fees and fines levied in Ditmarsh.After violently repelling the first preaching of proponents of the Reformation, slaying in December 1524, Lutheranism nevertheless started to win over Ditmarsians. In 1533 the Council of the 48 turned the Ditmarsian Catholic Church into a Lutheran state church. Cf. Thies Völker, Die Dithmarscher Landeskirche 1523–1559: Selbständige bauernstaatliche Kirchenorganisation in der Frühneuzeit, sections 'Heinrich von Zütphen 1524' and 'Sieg der Reformation 1533', posted on 16 July 2009 on: suite101.de: Das Netzwerk der Autoren. On request of the Senate of Hamburg Luther had sent Bugenhagen to the city. He developed the Lutheran Church Order for Hamburg in 1529. He first aimed at seizing the revenues of concathedral and chapter in favour of the common chest of the urban parishes, financing pastors and teachers. The chapter would be dissolved and the released canons paid a life annuity. However, the then still steadfastly Catholic capitulars refused and were not to be forced due to their immunity and extraterritorial status. The dispute made many canons leave the city and shut down the concathedral. A lawsuit in the matter was still pendent at the Imperial Chamber Court when after the Smalkaldic War and the subsequent Peace of Augsburg Emperor Ferdinand I brokered the Bremen Settlement in 1561. Two prebends, privately donated in the 15th century, were reserved for lectors (lector primarius, secundarius) in charge of the advanced theological training of the clergy. After the Reformation the lector primarius was combined with the superintendency of the Lutheran Church of Hamburg, first held by Superintendent Aepinus since 18 May 1532. The lector secundarius was combined with the Lutheran pastorate at the Dom. Smaller prebends were reserved to maintain church musicians and teachers. Known pastors were, among others, (1540–1547), (as of 1548Eitzen became superintendent of the Lutheran Church of the Gottorp share of Holstein and Schleswig (as of 1562), general superintendent of the Lutheran church in the entire Duchies of Holstein and Schleswig (as of 1564).), and (1765–1790). With the Peace of Westphalia the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen had turned from an elective monarchy into the hereditary monarchy of the Duchy of Bremen. While the cathedral chapters of Bremen and Hamburg were not dissolved as such, they sharply lost influence because they used to be the election bodies of the incumbents of the see securing their privileges and endowments by election capitulations, which the incumbents had to issue as self-commitments to the laws and principles established until their accession. Hereditary monarchy opened the gate for absolutism in the Duchy of Bremen. The chapters turned from constitutive legislative bodies into subordinate administrative units receiving orders from the rulers. The last canon officiating as president of the chapter was the jurist . = Church musicians = Many church musicians were granted prebends or canonicates, traditionally one canon, titled cantor or precentor, was in charge of preparing and organising musical performances in the Dom. Since the Reformation the Senate of Hamburg furthered the cantorate of the Johanneum surpassing the church music of the Dom. At times both cantorates were held in personal union. , vicar at the Dom since 1604, was entrusted the cantorate of Johanneum in 1628. Cathedral cantor Thomas Selle officiated between 1642 and 1663. Johann Wolfgang Franck held the cantorate from 1682 to 1685. Friedrich Nicolaus Bruhns, succeeding Nicolaus Adam Strungk in charge of the Hamburger Ratsmusik (Music for the Hamburg Senate) in 1682, became canonicus minor and cathedral cantor in 1687. Johann Mattheson, diplomat, musician, music theoretician, and cathedral cantor between 1715 and 1728 was the first author to publish on Johann Sebastian Bach.Johann Mattheson, Das beschützte Orchestre, oder desselben zweyte Eröffnung: worinn nicht nur e. würcklichen galant-homme, der eben kein Profeßions-Verwandter, sondern auch manchem Musico selbst d. alleraufrichtigste u. deutlichste Vorstellung musicalischer Wissenschaften ... ertheilet wird, Hamburg: Schiller, 1717 and 1748, (reprint Leipzig: Zentralantiquariat der DDR, 1981), part I, chapter V, p. 222. Deafness forced Mattheson to retire. He was succeeded by Reinhard Keiser, who became the cathedral precentor in 1728, and wrote largely church music there until his death in 1739. Between 1756 and 1762 Johann Valentin Görner served as cantor.  Capitular endowment  The capitular endowment comprised 14 so-called capitular villages (Kapitelsdörfer) outside of then Hamburg, paying dues to the chapter. Following the Reformation the rulers of Holstein seized these villages, legitimised by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. On 18 October 1576 Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp seized a number of capitular endowments against a recurrent annuity paid until 1803. Endowments: * The tithe of Ahrensfelde since 1195 * The tithe of Bargfeld since 1195 * Half a hide in Barmbek * Barmstedt till 1564 * Barsbüttel, grain dues from the village since 1306, all the village since 7 April 1341, till 1576 * since 1345 * Part of Bramfeld since 1271 * The tithe of Duvenstedt since 1255 * Hoisdorf since 1339, till 1576 * Half the tithe of Kirchsteinbek since 1255 * The tithe of still in 1540 * since 1318 * Two oxgangs in Mellingstedt since 1271 * Domherrenland (canons' land) in , till 1803 * An estate in Niendorf since 1343 * Osdorf since the early 14th century * Half the tithe of Oststeinbek since 1255, the local mill since 1313, till 1576 * Papendorf in Holstein, held by the chapter between 1256 and 1556 * Seven oxgangs and three cottages in Poppenbüttel since 1336, all the village since 1389 * Dues from Rahlstedt since 1296 * Rellingen till 1564 * The tithe of Rissen since 1255 * Stemwarde part of its forest in 1259, all the village since 22 June 1263, till 1576 * A recurrent rent from Stockelsdorf manor since 1358 * Todendorf since 1263 * Willinghusen half the village since 1238, all the village since 1342, till 1576 * Wulfsdorf * Wulksfelde References * Ralf Busch, Hamburg Altstadt, Stuttgart: Theiss, 2002, (=Führer zu archäologischen Denkmälern in Deutschland; vol. 41). * Adolf Hofmeister, \\"Der Kampf um das Erbe der Stader Grafen zwischen den Welfen und der Bremer Kirche (1144–1236)\\", in: Geschichte des Landes zwischen Elbe und Weser: 3 vols., Hans-Eckhard Dannenberg and Heinz-Joachim Schulze (eds.) on behalf of the Landschaftsverband der ehem.

Brown obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from San Francisco State College and Master of Fine Arts degrees from both the California College of the Arts and Crafts (later renamed California College of the Arts), and the University of Southern California. Post-educational career From the 1940s to the 1980s, Brown produced a large body of serigraphic art. His serigraphs were notable for their bold and arresting use of color; they frequently won prizes and were shown in national graphic art exhibitions. These works explored a broad range of styles including figurative, abstract, and Op art. From the 1950s until shortly before his death, Brown also worked as a glass artist. He created vivid and distinctive fused stained glass pieces, described by the Los Angeles Times in 1967 as \\"usually the center of attention\\" of exhibits. He also combined serigraphy and glassmaking, creating silkscreens on glass. He produced a significant rendering in stained glass of the Twelve Tribes of Israel for Temple Adat Ari El in North Hollywood, California, and glass panes for the entrance to the Glendale First United Methodist Church. Brown was Professor of Fine Art at Glendale Community College from 1948 to 1983, focusing on life drawing and ceramics. He also taught printmaking and other art disciplines.

Günther Messner (18 May 1946Diary of Günther Messner, entry from May 18, 1970. In Reinhold Messner, Der Nackte Berg, 2002, Piper Verlag, p. 119: Lager I (4700 m), Pfingstmontag, 18. Mai 1970. Heute ist mein Geburtstag, 24 Jahre werde ich alt. (= \\"Camp I (4,700 m), Whit Monday, 18 May 1970. Today is my birthday, I'm getting 24 years old.\\") – 29 June 1970) was an Italian mountaineer from South Tyrol and the younger brother of Reinhold Messner. Günther climbed some of the most difficult routes in the Alps during the 1960s, and joined the Nanga Parbat-Expedition in 1970 just before the beginning of the expedition due to an opening within the team. Rupal face of Nanga Parbat Death on Nanga Parbat Günther was a member of a 1970 expedition to Nanga Parbat led by Karl Herrligkoffer. Herrligkoffer had already organized six expeditions to Nanga Parbat and was said to be obsessed with the mountain after his half-brother, climber Willy Merkl, along with eight others, died on the peak in 1934. On 26 June 1970 Günther, his brother Reinhold and Gerhard Baur were at Camp 5 watching for a signal rocket from base camp. Blue indicated good weather, red poor. Radio Peshawar reported good weather, so the expedition leader Herrligkoffer fired a rocket, but it exploded red, not blue. Consequently, Reinhold commenced a solo quick-and- light attack without gear shortly after 2 a.m. to avoid the presumed bad weather. Günther and Gerhard were still asleep. Reinhold had a difficult time finding his way up the Merkl Couloir by headlamp but emerged at dawn. At sunrise the next morning, Günther and Gerhard Baur were installing rope to aid Reinhold's return. Baur recounts the story that Günther did something impulsive in that he impatiently dumped the ropes they were fixing and sprinted into and then soloed the difficult Merkl Couloir. Günther and Reinhold reached the summit together late in the afternoon, when Günther started showing signs of exhaustion, possibly due to the effort he made in trying to catch up with Reinhold earlier in the day. What happened next was a matter of controversy for many years. According to Reinhold, the two brothers stayed near the summit overnight in an emergency bivouac (with only space blankets) close to the so-called Merkle-notch (named in honor of Herrligkoffer's half brother) since a night descent seemed impossible on the Rupal face due to Günther's exhaustion and altitude sickness. Reinhold states that Günther worried that reversing down the sheer Rupal Face would be dangerous. He says that Günther suggested a descent via the gentler Diamir Face. The next morning, Reinhold recalls that Günther was delirious. Reinhold says that he started shouting for help at 6 a.m. and about three hours later, he saw Felix Kuen and Peter Scholz in the Merkl Couloir, heading for the summit. The two parties got to within about 100 yards of each other and with difficulty there was some communication. \\"Are you both OK?\\" Kuen yelled. \\"Yes! Everything's OK,\\" Reinhold controversially replied. Unfortunately in a misunderstanding Kuen and Scholz continued to the summit. Reinhold and Günther were then forced to do a second bivouac at the Mummery Rib. By the next morning, the third day without shelter or water, Günther could only stumble slowly along. The multi-day descent had brought the two climbers to the limit of their physical and mental strength, and was to end in tragedy when Günther disappeared at the bottom of the Diamir face, most likely killed by an ice avalanche during the descent. Reinhold, walking ahead and facing exhaustion, severe frostbite and the loss of his brother, continued down along the Diamir valley until he found some local shepherds, who helped him. The expedition members Max von Kienlin and Hans Saler claimed that Reinhold declined the assistance of others when his brother Günther became ill. The main assertion by Hans Saler and Max von Kienlin was that Reinhold's decision to go down the Diamir face was not born of emergency, as suggested by Günther in his fatigue, but a gambit Reinhold had planned and had openly discussed with members of the team. Messner's version of events was that \\"He (Günther) had to get lower. We couldn't continue along the southwest ridge either, because it is very long and up and down. And we couldn't wait for the others to come, because they couldn't have gotten to us until the following morning, and another day and night at that altitude would have been fatal for Günther. That left only the Diamir Face\\". Messner was subsequently widely quoted as saying \\"We had a choice between waiting for death and going out to meet it\\". Remains and controversy For the next 30 years the dispute over the events of this expedition became possibly the most controversial fight in modern-day climbing. The dispute spawned more than a dozen lawsuits, countless attacks and counterattacks, a revenge theory (stemming from a post-expedition love affair between Reinhold Messner and von Kienlin's wife), and numerous efforts by Reinhold to find Günther and vindicate himself. In July 2000, climber Hanspeter Eisendle found a human fibula at the base of the Diamir wall of Nanga Parbat. Due to the decomposition of the DNA, it could not be definitively determined at that time whether the bone belonged to Günther Messner - it was possible that the bone could have come from climbers who died on the mountain in 1962. A subsequent analysis at the University of Innsbruck strongly suggested that the owner of the fibula was Günther Messner. On 17 July 2005, three local Pakistani guides found the remains of a climber at an altitude of 4,300 metres on the Diamir face an hour's climb above the Diamir base camp, near where Reinhold had believed Günther was lost. A search of the talus yielded a leather boot entombing a wool-socked foot and clothing which the climbers quickly realized could be the body of Günther Messner. Reinhold trekked to the spot and recognised the boot (a brown leather Lowa Triple Boot) and jacket on the body as those of his brother. Reinhold took the boot with him - with the bones still inside. The expedition doctor, Munich-based anesthesiologist Rudolf Hipp, harvested tissue samples for the DNA testing. On 21 October 2005 scientists at the University of Innsbruck completed a DNA analysis of tissue samples from the remains, and confirmed that the remains were that of Günther. This evidence vindicated the version of events told by Reinhold that Günther was on the west side of the mountain when he was killed, and not on the descent through the Rupal Wall. Despite the undisputed DNA evidence controversy persists. Residual argument revolves largely around whether Günther perished in a fall near the summit, upper or middle part of the Diamir Face, versus toward the bottom, where Reinhold said he'd last seen his brother. The argument is based on glacial movement over a period of 35 years and the location where the remains were found. Saler has asserted that if Günther had died in the lower third of the face (as described by Reinhold) then the remains would have been found much lower than 14,110 feet (where they were reportedly recovered). The existence of a disputed handwritten note described in the 2003 book by von Kienlin, The Traverse, was allegedly a \\"confession\\" recorded by von Kienlin documenting a conversation between Reinhold and von Kienlin in a motel room in Gilgit, Pakistan, before they both returned home. The note says that \\"I lost Günther\\" and \\"For hours I was up there yelling for him. I don't know why, but he couldn't hear me. He was doing very badly. He didn't make it. Maybe he fell.\\" Funeral On 8 September 2005, the remains were burned at the foot of Nanga Parbat on a pyre in Tibetan tradition. Also borrowing from Tibetan tradition, Reinhold and his expedition team of 14 trekkers and two journalists built a chorten, a square-shaped stack of stones, as a monument. The participants sang \\"yelo Lak, the gods were merciful,\\" and threw rice into the air. Further reading * Ralf-Peter Märtin: Nanga Parbat. Truth and delusion of mountaineering.

Biography John George Schmucker was born at Michaelstadt in Hesse, Germany. His parents emigrated to the United States in 1785. After a residence of two years in Pennsylvania, the family settled near Woodstock, Virginia. In 1789 he began to study for the ministry. A year later he went to Philadelphia to continue his studies with Justus Henry Christian Helmuth and John Frederick Schmidt. He was licensed in 1793, and ordained in 1800. Beginning in 1794, he held several pastorates in and around Hagerstown, Maryland. In 1809, he was called to York, Pennsylvania, where he remained until failing health compelled him to retire in 1852. He then moved to Williamsburg, Pennsylvania, where several of his children resided, and there he remained during the rest of his life. In 1825 he received the degree of D.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. Schmucker was a founder of the 1821 General Synod of the Lutheran Church in the United States and was on the 3-person Pennsylvania Ministerium committee that planned the 1826 Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg (his son, Samuel Simon Schmucker, was elected the 1st professor). He was also active in the establishment of Pennsylvania College (now Gettysburg College), and for more than twenty-one years was one of its trustees. For more than thirty years, he was one of the leaders of a Lutheran Church body in the United States, and actively engaged in all its important operations. Writings Schmucker was a frequent contributor to periodicals, and a poet of merit. Among his works are: * Vornehmste Weissagungen der Heiligen Schrift (The most prominent prophecies of holy scripture; Hagerstown, Maryland, 1807) * Reformations-Geschichte zur Jubelfeier der Reformation (A history of the Reformation for its jubilee; York, Pennsylvania, 1817) * Prophetic History of the Christian Religion, or Explanation of the Revelation of St. John (2 vols., Baltimore, 1817) * Schwärmergeist unserer Tage entlarvt, zur Warnung erweckten Seelen (Enthusiastic spirits of our days unmasked to warn enlightened souls; York, Pa., 1827) * Lieder-Anhang, zum Evang.

The first bomb went off around 11:50 p.m. local time in Khyber market area, which is a commercial and residential area, and injured 3 people. After a crowd gathered in the area, a teen-aged suicide bomber on a motorcycle set off a second explosion, killing many people on the spot. About of explosives were used in the second blast according to officials. Police and rescue teams soon reached the spot and cordoned the area. Death of two journalists Two journalists, Asfandyar Abid Naveed (ca. 1976 – 11 June 2011), also reported as Asfandyar Khan, a career journalist working for Akhbar-e-Khyber, and Shafiullah Khan (ca. 1983 – 17 June 2011), of The News, were killed as a result of covering the double suicide bombing in Peshawar. Naveed died at the scene from the second blast. His death in the attack prompted calls among Pakistan's professional journalism organisations for more attention to be placed on the safety of journalists and for more action by police. Shafiullah Khan was a trainee reporter for the daily The News (Pakistan). He was from Palangzai village, North Waziristan. Khan had recently completed a master's degree in journalism from Gomal University in Dera Ismail Khan. He had been working as a trainee for one week in Peshawar bureau of The News before the deadly bombings, according to the Khyber Union of Journalists, an affiliate of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ). Khan received third degree burns after the second blast was set off after military and media arrived. Khan was transferred to the Khyber Teaching Hospital's (KTH) burn unit. Doctors said he also received metal shrapnel in his right shoulder. A week later, 17 June 2011, Khan died in the burn treatment center in Wah Cantonment, a military center east of Islamabad. Just one month before this bombing, journalist Nasrullah Khan Afridi, of the Khyber News Agency, PTV News, Daily Mashriq, had been killed 10 May 2011, in the same Khyber Super Market as the other two journalists.

The island of Satanazes (also called the island of Devils, or of the Hand of Satan or of St. Athanasius) is a legendary island once thought to be located in the Atlantic Ocean, and depicted on many 15th-century maps.  Cartographic depiction  In 15th- century portolan charts, the island of Satanazes is depicted as lying out in the north Atlantic Ocean, due west of the Azores and Portugal, and just north of the legendary island of Antillia. The island was first depicted in the 1424 portolan chart of Venetian cartographer Zuane Pizzigano. It is drawn as a large, blue rectangular island, indented with bays and five or six settlements, with the inscription ista ixolla dixemo satanazes, which has been translated as \\"this is the island called of the devils\\". In his 1424 chart, Pizzigano placed Satanazes some sixty leagues north of the large Antillia island. Pizzigano capped Satanazes with a little umbrella-shaped island he labels Saya (which later cartographers will call Tanmar or Danmar). These three islands, plus Ymana (later called Royllo, a little companion west of Antillia), would be collectively drawn together in many later 15th-century maps, with the same relative size, position and shape Pizzigano originally gave them, and known collectively as the \\"Antillia group\\" or (to use Bianco's label) the insulae de novo rep(er)te (\\"islands newly reported\\"). In Grazioso Benincasa's 1463 atlas, the settlements on Satanazes island are named Araialis, Cansillia, Duchal, Jmada, Nam and Saluaga.Cortesão (1954 (1975), p.140) Cartographic appearances of Satanazes:List from Cortesão (1954 (1975): p.134) * 1424 map of Zuane Pizzigano of Venice as ista ixolla dixemo satanazes * 1435 map of Battista Beccario of Genoa as Satanagio * 1436 map of Andrea Bianco of Venice as Ya de la man satanaxio * 1463, 1470 and 1482 maps of Grazioso Benincasa of Ancona as Saluaga/Salvaga (u and v are equivalent) * 1460s anonymous Weimar map (attrib. to Conte di Ottomano Freducci of Ancona) as Salvagio.The use of Beinincasa's \\"Salvaga\\" rather than the older \\"Satanaxio\\" in the Weimar map is one of the critical factors in adjusting the estimate of the Weimar map's composition date from 1424 (Humboldt's original estimate) to sometime in the 1460s or after. * 1480 and 1489 maps of Pedro Roselli of Majorca as Salvatga * 1480 and 1489 maps of Albino de Canepa of Venice as Salvagia * 1487 map of anonymous Majorcan cartographer as Salvaja * 1493 Laon globe as Salirosa Significantly, the island of Satanazes is omitted on the maps of Bartolomeo Pareto (1455), Cristoforo Soligo (c. 1475) Grazioso's son Andrea Benincasa (1476) and the Nuremberg globe of Martin Behaim (1492), even though they all include Antillia and some retain Saya/Tanmar.Cortesão (1954 (1975): p.134) Satanazes disappears on practically all maps after Christopher Columbus's voyages of the 1490s. It was possibly transplanted (in smaller form) to the Isle of Demons, between Newfoundland and Greenland, e.g. the 1508 map of Johannes Ruysch.  Etymology and legend  According to Cortesão, Pizzigano's 'Satanazes' is Portuguese for \\"satans\\" or \\"devils\\", Beccaria's 'Satanagio' is the same word in Ligurian dialect and Bianco's 'Satanaxio' the same in Venetian.Cortesão (1954 (1975): p.135) The island disappears from maps after 1436, and reappears only in 1462 when Benincasa switches it to Salvaga, meaning 'savage' – possibly a misreading, more probably a deliberate adjustment by Benincasa to avoid using the profanity of \\"devil\\". The Laon globe's 'Salirosa' is an apparent mis- transcription of 'Salvaga'. Historians have conjectured the \\"Devils\\" of Satanazes might be a reference to the Skraelings (indigenous peoples of Greenland and Vinland) reported in the Norse sagas, notably the Grœnlendinga saga and the saga of Erik the Red, which began to filter south around this time. Pizzigano may have constructed Satanazes island to capture their rough geographic location.Cortesão (1954 (1975), p.137ff). The possible connection between the Satanazes and the Skraelings was first proposed by Nordenskiöld (1889), his attention drawn by an inscription on some islands between Newfoundland and Greenland in the 1508 map of Johannes Ruysch, which notes how 'devils' located there attacked sailors (See Isle of Demons).Nordenskiöld (1889: p.65). The connection need not require direct knowledge of the Norse sagas themselves, e.g. Fridtjof Nansen has drawn attention to how Norse encounters with North American 'demons' were adopted in Irish immrama,.Fridtjof Nansen (1911: vol.2, p.9) Given the tendency of the legends of Atlantic seafarers – Norse, Irish, Arab and Iberian – to move quickly and cross-fertilize each other,Nansen (1911: vol. 2, p.54). the news of an Isle of Devils out in the North Atlantic may have arrived to Italian cartographers via several channels. Georg Hassel conjectured that, by their size and shape, the large islands of Satanazes and Antillia may represent the coasts of North America and South America respectively,Hassel (1822: p.6) thus making it a possible testament of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. Babcock conjectures the representation might be of the Caribbean, that Satanazes represents Florida (and Antillia Cuba, Roylla Jamaica and Tanmar the Bahamas).Babckock, (1922: p.155; p.188) The \\"Hand of Satan\\", emerging from the sea to snatch a boat Andrea Bianco's 1436 long label Ya de la man santanaxio provoked Vicenzo Formaleoni (1783) to read it as the isle of \\"the Hand of Satan\\", an alternative name for Satanazes still found in some sources.Formaleoni (1783: p.48. Buache (1806: p.17) and Humboldt (1837: p.179) read it the same way. Formaleoni proposed it might be connected to a legend from India, about a giant hand that arose each day from the sea and carried off the inhabitants into the ocean. This legend is told in the Perigrinaggio di tre giovani (The Three Princes of Serendip) first published in Venice in 1557 by Michele Tramezzino (alleged to be a translation from the Persian of a certain Christopher of Armenia, Christoforo Armeno). The story might have been circulating earlier among Atlantic Ocean seafarers, traced in Irish immrama and Arab tales, about a giant hand in the Sea of Darkness that plucked sailors and sometimes entire boats, and dragged them to the bottom of the ocean.A fanciful version of the tale of the Hand of Satan is related in Higginson (1883: p.134). Gaffarel suggests this might be a reference to the icebergs of the North Atlantic Ocean.This is proposed by Paul Gaffarel (1882: p.211) The Marquis d'Avezac (1845) launched yet another theory, reading 'satanaxio' as S. Atanaxio, i.e. the island of St. Athanasius.D'Avezac (1845: p.31). Oddly, this reading was pursued by Nordenskiöld (1897: p.164), who sought to connect it to St. Anastasius, even though he had earlier (1889) proposed the Satanazes = Skraelings connection. D'Avezac also makes the credible argument that the de la man satanaxio in Bianco's label is actually referencing two separate islands, Satanazes and Delaman, probably the nearby Danmar or Tanmar of other maps, believed to be a reference to the legendary Isle of Mam (Babcock proposed an alternate reading of Delaman/Danmar/Tanmar as I la Mar, or \\"Island of the Sea\\".)Babcock (1922: p.155) The discovery of the 1424 Pizzigano map in the 20th century, with its Satanazes clearly indicated, has allowed modern historians to set aside the old Hand of Satan/St. Athanasius theories, and embrace the Isle of Devils reading.Cortesão (1953, 1954, 1970) Despite all these conjectures, there is little agreement. Unlike its southern counterpart Antillia (which seems rather solidly connected to the Iberian legend of the Seven Cities), Satanazes has been characterized as a legendary island in need of a legend.e.g. Morison, 1971 p.101 References  Sources  * Christoforo Armeno (1557) Perigrinaggio di tre giovani figliuoli del re di Serendippo as translated into Italian and published by Michele Tramezzino, Venice.

She was elected to the Argentine Senate in 2009, and was nominated as running mate by Progressive Front presidential candidate Hermes Binner for the 2011 campaign. Life and times Morandini was born in Córdoba, Argentina, in 1948. Her mother served as President of the Córdoba chapter of the Communist Party of Argentina during the 1960s. She enrolled at the National University of Córdoba, and earned degrees in communications, psychology, and medicine. She joined the Revolutionary Communist Party of Argentina following its 1968 break from the Communist Party, and lost two brothers as desaparecidos in the subsequent Dirty War. She sought exile in Spain, where she continued her career in journalism. She worked in Lisbon from 1977 to 1980 as a news correspondent for the Pyresa news agency, for El Correo Catalán, and Revista Cambio 16, as well as for the Portuguese magazine Visao. She met left-wing journalist and Brazilian exile Flávio de Freitas Tavares, and they were married in 1980. Her career as a correspondent for Cambio 16 first took her to Brazil in 1978, and despite being separated from her husband (who was unable to return to Brazil, where he had been tortured), she would live there until 1984. Morandini covered the Trial of the Juntas and subsequent trials against officers implicated in the Dirty War for the leading Rio de Janeiro daily O Globo until 1987. She remained in Buenos Aires, and her first book Catamarca (regarding the María Soledad Morales murder and other abuses in Catamarca Province), was published in 1991. She hosted an interview program on the TN news network, Temas & Debates, from 1992, and earned a Martín Fierro Award for her work in the program in 1994, as well as two Broadcasting Awards. She established a short lived women's magazine, Mujeres & Compañía, in 1995, and left her post as Argentine correspondent for Cambio 16 in 1998, after which she contributed columns for Clarín until 2006, as well as for Rumbos (the Sunday magazine published by La Voz del Interior in Córdoba). She published El Harén (The Harem) in 1998, which examined the growing role of Arab Argentines in business and politics. Her work as host of Tierra de Periodistas (Land of Journalists) earned her a second Martín Fierro in 2000, and in 2001, she produced the documentary Operación Aries (in reference to the military code name of the March 1976 coup) for the 25th anniversary of the event. She later hosted Paradojas y Código N on Public Television. Morandini was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies on the Civic Front ticket in 2005, and in 2009, joined former Córdoba Mayor Luis Juez on a Civic Coalition ticket that resulted in the election of both to the Argentine Senate. She was appointed ranking member of the Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Growth during her tenure in the Senate, and on June 11, 2011, Santa Fe Governor and Socialist presidential candidate Hermes Binner nominated Morandini as his running mate on their Broad Progressive Front ticket for the 2011 campaign.

The original pier was built in 1910 and was destroyed in a fire in 1914. The pier was then rebuilt and continued in existence until 1964, when it was dismantled. The area where the pier stood is now part of the Seattle terminal of the Washington State Ferry system. Location The Grand Trunk Pacific dock was located at the foot of Madison Street.Beaton, Welford, ed. Frank Waterhouse & Company's Pacific Ports: A Commercial Geography (1917), at pages 27-37. (accessed 06-09-11). The dock area had previously been used a wharf for the steamship Flyer. The Grand Trunk Pacific dock was located immediately to the north of Colman Dock, with the small U-shaped dock for the West Seattle ferry in between. Immediately to the north of the Grand Trunk dock was used by the Seattle fire department's fireboat Duwamish. The next pier north of the Seattle fire boat dock was the still existing Pier 54, previously known as Pier 3 or the Galbraith dock. Construction The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway dock stood just north of Colman Dock at the foot of Marion Street. The original dock was built in 1910 as the largest wooden pier on the West Coast. Construction of the dock required 5,000 timber pilings and 3,700,000 board feet of lumber. As built, the dock had a prominent tower on the water end that was high. The upper story of the dock was used for offices. 50px The dock was built by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, a Canadian company that built the second Canadian transcontinental railway and that also had interests in steamship lines.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 171. In 1910, the company had two new steamships built, the Prince Rupert and the Prince George, which used the Grand Trunk dock as their Seattle terminal. The Prince Rupert and the Prince George each could carry 1,500 day passengers, and also had 220 staterooms for longer runs. The Grand Trunk Railway employed them in competition with the steamships of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the \\"Triangle Route\\", which ran between Seattle, Victoria, and Vancouver, British Columbia. The Grand Trunk liners also ran from the dock to the railway line's western terminus in Prince Rupert, British Columbia. The liners arrived in 1910, even though the first train did not reach Prince Rupert until 1914.Newell and Williamson, Pacific Coastal Liners, at pages 151-57. Destruction by fire Duwamish at right fighting fire. Hand-tinted photograph. On July 30, 1914, the dock was destroyed by an explosion and massive fire. One source reports that the cause was a spark from a cigarette or cigar landing in a pile of sawdust.Faber, Steamer's Wake -- Voyaging down the old marine highways of Puget Sound, British Columbia, and the Columbia River, at pages 248-49. When the fire broke out, two vessels were moored alongside, the wooden inland steamboat Athlon and the coastal steamship Admiral Farragut. According to one source, Athlon's engineer first noticed the fire at about 3:00 pm. He alerted the Seattle Fire Department. Another source says that it was the wharfinger who noticed the fire at about 3:40 pm and raised the alarm.Stein, Alan J., “Seattle's Grand Trunk Pacific dock burns on July 30, 1914”, HistoryLink.org Essay 3475, (July 31, 2001). (accessed 06-11-11). Although the fire spread rapidly through the dock, fueled by the creosote-saturated piers and timbers of the pier, both Athlon and Admiral Farragut were brought off the dock without damage. Engine Company No. 5 of the Seattle Fire Department responded to the alarm and drove out on the dock. According to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, \\"'they said they were just standing there – and the very air around them seemed to turn to flame.Quoted in Faber, Steamer's Wake, at page 249. The fire engine's fuel tank, holding fifty gallons of gasoline, exploded, burning many of the firemen. Two firemen, Patrick Cooper and John Stokes, were trapped in the fire. Badly burned, both had to jump into the water to safe themselves. Cooper died three days later and Stokes was never able to return to full duty as a fireman. Fire companies responded from all around the city. The fireboats Duwamish and Snoqualmie fought the fire, and, with the aid of the revenue cutter Unalga they were able to keep the fire from destroying the adjacent Colman Dock, although that dock did sustain $10,000 in damages.Paul Dorpat, Seattle Central Waterfront Tour, Part 4: From Mosquito Fleet to Ferry System at Colman Dock , HistoryLink, May 24, 2000. Accessed 18 October 2008. Five people died and 29 more, including 10 firemen, were injured. The fire burned for two hours, and attracted a large number of onlookers, including the mayor of Seattle. Some people took advantage of the fire to loot nearby businesses, including Ye Olde Curiosity Shop, a business still in existence as of 2014, which was then located at Colman Dock. Later history The rebuilt Grand Trunk Pacific dock, circa 1920. A replacement dock, without a watchtower, was promptly built, and survived until 1964, when it was replaced by waiting area for automobiles boarding ferries at the new ferry terminal.. In 1917, the new dock measured 605 by 116 feet, with 1,200 feet of berthing space, with a cargo storage capacity of 12,000 tons. There was a storage room on the second floor of the warehouse which was served by an elevator with a 400 ton capacity. The wharf as it existed in 1917 was said to have been \\"semi-fireproof.\\" There were adjustable passenger slips and a depressed railway track for loading freight cars. There were offices and waiting rooms on the street end. Like Colman Dock, the Grand Trunk dock had an overhead bridge to the Seattle business district. Depth of water alongside the dock was 55 feet. Heavy construction costs and economic dislocation during World War I caused the bankruptcy of the Grand Trunk Pacific in 1920. The line was taken over by the government of Canada and operated as a division of the Canadian National Railway. In 1927, the Kitsap County Transportation Company (KCTC) and Puget Sound Freight Lines (PSFL) formed a joint venture company called the Ferry Dock Company, which took out a long-term lease on the Grand Trunk Pacific dock, which was then in a rundown condition. The dock became the main terminal and for both lines. In 1929, the stockholders of KCTC and PSFL reached agreement with Wilbur B. Foshay (b. 1887) to sell their companies, including the Ferry Dock Company, to Foshay, who was then assembling a utility and transportation business empire. Foshay however was financially ruined in the October 1929 stock market crash and the transaction never went through. In August 1930, the Canadian Pacific Railway began using the Grand Trunk Pacific dock as the Seattle terminal for their ships on the Seattle-Victoria-Vancouver, British Columbia route.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats – A Legend on Puget Sound, at pages 181, 188, 196, and 200. In 1959 the Grand Trunk dock was used by the Black Ball Freight Service. In the early 1960s the dock was dismantled and the area where it stood became part of the Washington State Ferry terminal.

Many rings considered in K-theory carry a natural λ-ring structure. λ-rings also provide a powerful formalism for studying an action of the symmetric functions on the ring of polynomials, recovering and extending many classical results (). λ-rings were introduced by . For more about λ-rings see , , and . Motivation If V and W are finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field k, then we can form the direct sum V⊕W, the tensor product V⊗W, and the n-th exterior power of V, Λn(V). All of these are again finite-dimensional vector spaces over k. The same three operations of direct sum, tensor product and exterior power are also available when working with k-linear representations of a finite group, and when working with vector bundles over some topological space, and in more general situations. λ-rings are designed to abstract the common algebraic properties of these three operations, where we also allow for formal inverses with respect to the direct sum operation. (These formal inverses also appear in Grothendieck groups, which is why the underlying additive groups of most λ-rings are Grothendieck groups.) The addition in the ring corresponds to the direct sum, the multiplication in the ring corresponds to the tensor product, and the λ-operations to the exterior powers. For example, the isomorphism :\\\\Lambda^2(V\\\\oplus W)\\\\cong \\\\Lambda^2(V)\\\\oplus\\\\left(\\\\Lambda^1(V)\\\\otimes\\\\Lambda^1(W)\\\\right)\\\\oplus\\\\Lambda^2(W) corresponds to the formula :\\\\lambda^2(x+y)=\\\\lambda^2(x)+\\\\lambda^1(x)\\\\lambda^1(y)+\\\\lambda^2(y) valid in all λ-rings, and the isomorphism : \\\\Lambda^1(V\\\\otimes W)\\\\cong \\\\Lambda^1(V)\\\\otimes\\\\Lambda^1(W) corresponds to the formula :\\\\lambda^1(xy)=\\\\lambda^1(x)\\\\lambda^1(y) valid in all λ-rings. Analogous but (much) more complicated formulas govern the higher order λ-operators. = Motivation with Vector Bundles = If we have a short exact sequence of vector bundles over a smooth scheme X > 0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}' \\\\to 0, then locally, for a small enough open neighborhood U we have the isomorphism > \\\\bigwedge^n \\\\mathcal{E}_U \\\\cong \\\\bigoplus_{i+j=n} \\\\bigwedge^j > \\\\mathcal{E}'_U \\\\otimes\\\\bigwedge^j\\\\mathcal{E}_U Now, in the Grothendieck group K(X) we get this local equation globally for free, from the defining equivalence relations.

Definition A λ-ring is a commutative ring R together with operations λn : R->R for every non-negative integer n. These operations are required to have the following properties valid for all x, y ∈ R and all n, m ≥ 0: *λ0(x) = 1 *λ1(x) = x *λn(1) = 0 if n ≥ 2 *λn(x + y) = Σ i+j=n λi(x)λj(y) *λn(xy) = Pn(λ1(x), ..., λn(x), λ1(y), ..., λn(y)) *λn(λm(x)) = Pn,m(λ1(x), ..., λmn(x)) where Pn and Pn,m are certain universal polynomials with integer coefficients that describe the behavior of exterior powers on tensor products and under composition. These polynomials can be defined as follows. Let e1,...,emn be the elementary symmetric polynomials in the variables X1,...,Xmn. Then Pn,m is the unique polynomial in nm variables with integer coefficients such that Pn,m(e1, ..., emn) is the coefficient of tn in the expression :\\\\prod_{1 \\\\le i_1 (Such a polynomial exists, because the expression is symmetric in the Xi and the elementary symmetric polynomials generate all symmetric polynomials.) Now let e1,...,en be the elementary symmetric polynomials in the variables X1,...,Xn and f1,...,fn be the elementary symmetric polynomials in the variables Y1,...,Yn . Then Pn is the unique polynomial in 2n variables with integer coefficients such that Pn(e1,...,en, f1,...,fn) is the coefficient of tn in the expression :\\\\prod_{i,j=1}^n (1+tX_iY_j) = Variations = The λ-rings defined above are called \\"special λ-rings\\" by some authors, who use the term \\"λ-ring\\" for a more general concept where the conditions on λn(1), λn(xy) and λm(λn(x)) are dropped. Examples *The ring Z of integers, with the binomial coefficients \\\\lambda^n(x)={x\\\\choose n} as operations (which are also defined for negative x) is a λ-ring. In fact, this is the only λ-structure on Z. This example is closely related to the case of finite-dimensional vector spaces mentioned in the Motivation section, identifying each vector space with its dimension and remembering that \\\\dim(\\\\Lambda^n(k^x ))={x\\\\choose n}. *More generally, any binomial ring becomes a λ-ring if we define the λ-operations to be the binomial coefficients, λn(x) = (). In these λ-rings, all Adams operations are the identity. *The K-theory K(X) of a topological space X is a λ-ring, with the lambda operations induced by taking exterior powers of a vector bundle. *Given a group G and a base field k, the representation ring R(G) is a λ-ring; the λ-operations are induced by the exterior powers of k-linear representations of the group G. *The ring ΛZ of symmetric functions is a λ-ring. On the integer coefficients the λ-operations are defined by binomial coefficients as above, and if e1, e2, ... denote the elementary symmetric functions, we set λn(e1) = en. Using the axioms for the λ-operations, and the fact that the functions ek are algebraically independent and generate the ring ΛZ, this definition can be extended in a unique fashion so as to turn ΛZ into a λ-ring. In fact, this is the free λ-ring on one generator, the generator being e1. ().  Further properties and definitions  Every λ-ring has characteristic 0 and contains the λ-ring Z as a λ-subring. Many notions of commutative algebra can be extended to λ-rings. For example, a λ-homomorphism between λ-rings R and S is a ring homomorphism f : R → S such that f(λn(x)) = λn(f(x)) for all x ϵ R and all n≥0. A λ-ideal in the λ-ring R is an ideal I in R such that λn(x) ϵ I for all x ϵ R and all n≥1. If x is an element of a λ-ring and m a non-negative integer such that λm(x) ≠ 0 and λn(x) = 0 for all n>m, we write dim(x) = m and call the element x finite-dimensional. Not all elements need to be finite-dimensional. We have dim(x+y) ≤ dim(x) + dim(y) and the product of 1-dimensional elements is 1-dimensional.

A tale of economic change and environmental destruction, the story is told from the first person perspective of Ebert Pfister, who recounts how the arrival of the factory Krickerode destroyed the stream on which the mill once stood.  Plot Description  Ebert, short for Dr. Eberhard Pfister, spends summer vacation together with his 19-year-old wife Emmy “on magical land and ground\\" (\\"auf verzaubertem Grund und Boden\\") in the defunct mill of his deceased father Bertram Gottlieb Pfister, once host “of Pfister’s enjoyment gardens”. During the summer stay, Ebert shares his memories of the mill's history. Ebert lost his mother at a young age and cannot remember her. He was raised by the housemaid Christine, while his father ensured Ebert was taught Latin by a student of philosophy –– later Doctor of Chemistry –– Adam August Asche. Asche is the son of a textile dyer and a friend of the miller in his lifetime. Next to his mill, Pfister ran a flourishing local getaway. Summer guests from the nearby town would sit under the old chestnut trees. One of the guests, school board director Dr. Pottgiesser, a good friend of the host, accepts the enlightened Ebert into his high school. Periods of study in Berlin, Jena and Heidelberg are to follow, all financed by Ebert's father. Not far from the mill, the unsuccessful playwright, lyricist, and drunkard Dr. Felix Lippoldes lived a lamentable existence with his daughter Albertine. Invited on Christmas Eve to the “pungent\\" (\\"verstänkerte\\") mill, the poet climbs on the Christmas table and announces “with sinister pathos\\" (\\"mit finsterm Pathos\\"): > “The hour will come – don’t think, it is far- \\" (\\"Einst kommt die Stunde – > denkt nicht, sie sei ferne\\") The Christmas fest is disrupted by the awful smell of the once clear mill water, now “slimy and greasy\\" (\\"Schleim und Schmiere\\"). Ebert requests his friend Asche to conduct a chemical analysis of the water. The chemist eagerly gets to work and finds “mushroom masses covered with algae\\" (\\"Pilzmassen mit Algen überzogen\\"), “saprophyte\\" (\\"Fäulnisbewohner\\"), and beggiatoa alba. The latter stems from “the outlets of the sugar factory\\" (\\"den Ausflüssen der Zuckerfabriken\\"). On the second day of Christmas, the friends research the downfall of Pfister’s Mill. Their expedition follows the creek up from the Mill all the way to the beet factory at Krickerode. The factory there produced, even on holidays, “black smoke clouds\\" (\\"schwarze Rauchwolken\\") and beet sugar; releasing its waste sludge into the mill creek. A lawsuit is filed. Although the lawyer Dr. Riechei wins the court case against the operator of Krickerode Sugar Factory thanks to Dr. Asche's scholarly report, the miller is not able to overcome the devastation of his once healthy little world. He dies from the awful-smelling creek. Albertine's father, the “brilliant playwright\\" (\\"geniale Dramatiker\\") Felix Lippoldes was previously found drowned in the mill creek. Albertine, who could no longer help her father, cared for the miller Pfister until his end. The hours of the mill are numbered. Gentlemen come to the tear down of the old buildings from the city, “with their yardsticks and notebooks\\" (\\"mit ihren Maßstäben und Notizbüchern\\"). “Wheelbarrows and shovels and axes\\" (\\"Schubkarren und Schaufeln und Hacken\\") are unloaded from the wagon. “The Architect of the big new factory company\\" (\\"Der Architekt der neuen großen Fabrikgesellschaft\\") spreads out “his plans in the dreary restaurant\\" (\\"öden Gaststube seine Planrollen\\"). On the location of Pfister’s mill, a “lucrative, modern company\\" (\\"lukrativeres, zeitgemäßeres Unternehmen\\") will be built. Dr. Asche, who had for a while cast an eye on Albertine, marries the poet's daughter and enters “the business of spoiling water\\" (\\"das wasserverderbende Geschäft\\"): he founds a large industrial factory on the Spandau banks of the Spree. On his death bed, miller Pfister forgave his old friend Asche, who took embraced the new world of textiles and fashion, and added humbly: “Then the loving God must see it as the best\\" (\\"Dann wird es wohl der liebe Gott fürs beste halten\\"). In Berlin, Emmy and Albertine have children. Occasionally, the two mothers sit together directly next to the loud “chemical laundry\\" (\\"chemischen Waschanstalt\\"), whose wastewater is “forcibly fouling\\" (\\"nach Kräften verunreinigen\\") the Spree.

It was the successor to the 360th Rifle Division. The division was created in August 1941 by the State Defense Committee and the Volga Military District Commander, Vasily Gerasimenko, in the Volga Military District. The 360th compiled a distinguished record of service during the Great Patriotic War on the northern sector of the Soviet- German front, including the award of a battle honor and the Order of the Red Banner.

Andrei Filippovich Bolotov was named.Sharp states this must represent a mistake in the Soviet records. =Toropets-Kholm Offensive= On December 18 the STAVKA of the Supreme High Command issued its Order No. 005868 to the command of Northwestern Front, spelling out the goals and objectives of this operation: In the event the operation would not begin until January 9, 1942, due to the poor road and rail network. 4th Shock, commanded by Col. Gen. Andrey Yeryomenko, deployed on a front 50km wide, facing most of the 253rd Infantry Division; with just 10,000 men the German \\"line\\" was in fact a string of outposts, although well- fortified since the Germans had occupied this sector since October. The Army also had 790 guns of 76mm caliber or greater for support. At the outset the 360th was in third echelon, bringing up the rear.http://militera.lib.ru/h/isaev_av4/04.html (in Russian) 4th Shock was to initially advance towards Andreapol. Following a 90-minute artillery preparation the leading divisions broke through the thin German defenses and advanced as much as 15km. During the coming week the first echelon divisions surrounded and destroyed a reinforced battalion of the newly-arrived 189th Regiment of 81st Infantry Division and liberated Andreapol, seizing needed supplies. The 360th joined the advance on Toropets, which was taken on January 21 with an even larger hoard of much-needed supplies. On January 22, 4th and 3rd Shock Armies were transferred to Kalinin Front.http://militera.lib.ru/h/isaev_av4/04.html (in Russian) On January 26, Maj. Gen. Ivan Mikhailovich Kuznetsov took over command from Colonel Bolotov. During the rest of January and into February the division took part in several attempts to break into and liberate Velizh, but these were stymied on its outskirts.http://militera.lib.ru/h/isaev_av4/04.html (in Russian) On March 14, General Kuznetsov was in turn replaced by Col. Viktor Genrikhovich Poznyak. Finally, 4th Shock Army took up defensive lines, where it remained into the summer of 1943.Sources disagree on how long Poznyak was in command. Commanders of Corps and Divisions states he gave over command to Colonel Chinnov on Oct. 30, 1942. However, www.warheroes.ru states he was in command until he was named chief of staff of 43rd Army in February 1943. He is repeatedly named as commander of the 360th during the battle for Velikiye Luki in the memoir of Afanasy Beloborodov, Vsegda v boyu. =Velikiye Luki and Nevel= The division was transferred to the 3rd Shock Army in December 1942,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 11 during the Battle for Velikiye Luki, arriving at the front along the Lovat River on the 24th, and immediately helping to drive enemy forces from the village of Alexeykovo and the tactically significant height of point 179.0. By January 3, 1943, the division's 1193rd and 1195th Rifle Regiments were holding a line in front of Alexeykovo and Burtsevo in two echelons, facing the deepest wedge the German forces had driven in attempting to relieve their garrison in the city. However, Soviet intelligence had failed to detect the arrival of the fresh German 205th Infantry Division and a column of tanks from the 11th Panzer Division. On the morning of January 4 these broke through the 1193rd after an hour of fighting. The breakthrough was contained later that day by the 100th Rifle Brigade and the few tanks of the 45th Tank Brigade. By January 12 the German advance was stopped, and on the 17th the city was completely liberated.http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/beloborodov2/09.html On February 22, Colonel Posnyak was promoted to the rank of major general, and soon moved to the role of chief of staff of 43rd Army,http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=5682 being replaced by Col.

In February, 360th was moved back to 4th Shock Army, and remained in that Army, apart from short assignments to 6th Guards Army and 11th Guards Army, until January 1945.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", pp. 93-94 The division's next major action was the Nevel Offensive Operation, which began on October 6. It was on the rightmost flank of 4th Shock, in 2nd Guards Rifle Corps, adjacent to 28th Rifle Division on the left flank of 3rd Shock Army. The operation began with a reconnaissance in force at 0500 hrs., followed by a ninety-minute artillery preparation at 0840, then a wave of bombing strikes. The assault stepped off at 1000 hrs., and by noon 28th Rifle Division had routed the 2nd Luftwaffe Field Division and smashed the right flank of 263rd Infantry Division and was pouring through the gap, which was at the boundary between Army Groups Center and North. This success eased the way for the 360th, which gained 10km by the end of the day and about 10 more by October 10.David M. Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 39-41 In the aftermath of this success the division was given its battle honor: =Vitebsk and Polotsk= Further fighting later that month made few gains. By November 1 the division had been transferred to the 83rd Rifle Corps. On November 2 the 1st Baltic (former Kalinin) Front began a fresh offensive towards Vitebsk, with 4th Shock Army ordered to attack south towards the latter city. The joint assault with 3rd Shock Army soon produced a 16km-wide gap in the defenses of Third Panzer Army, but 83rd Corps' role was to make local attacks to guard the flank of 60th Rifle Corps as it exploited to the south. As the situation evolved the 360th was moved to 36th Rifle Corps in 11th Guards Army in December before the new offensive towards Gorodok. After that city was liberated the division went back to 83rd Corps in 4th Shock Army; it would remain in this Corps until the last months of the war. During January - February 1944, the 360th took part in grinding battles west of Vitebsk. By now, in common with the rest of the divisions of 4th Shock, it was down to between 4,500 - 5,000 men. On February 15 it helped to capture German strongpoints at Gorbachi and Bryli, forcing the defenders back about 2km to the line of the Vitebsk-Polotsk rail line, but could advance no farther.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 54, 129-31, 214-15, 312, 347 In preparation for the Baltic Offensive in July, the 360th was deployed just east of the Panther Line. For its role in the liberation of Polotsk, on July 23, the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. By the beginning of August it had advanced along the north bank of the Western Dvina River as far as Daugavpils.Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, p. 22 In early September General Chinnov was killed in action. Although the 360th was not conducting active operations at this time, the German forces were regularly firing artillery and mortar rounds into its positions, and German snipers were also active. At 1830 hrs. on September 6 Chinnov was killed by an enemy sniper while conducting a personal reconnaissance of the terrain between his 1195th and 1193rd Rifle Regiments. The adjutant to the commander of the 1193rd was also severely wounded while standing near the general.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, Frank Cass Publishers, London, 1998, p. 160. Maslov misspells his name as \\"Chinov\\". He was replaced six days later by Col. Efim Aleksandrovich Pashchenko, who remained in command for the duration of the war. By the same date, the division had continued its advance as far as Biržai in Lithuania. In early October, as the Courland Pocket began to be closed off, the division and its Army had reached farther west, to the vicinity of Žagarė.Baltic Gap, pp. 29, 35 In January 1945, 360th was briefly moved to 42nd Army in 2nd Baltic Front, still in 83rd Corps, then in February to 119th Rifle Corps in 1st Shock Army of the same Front. In March, 1st Shock became part of the Kurland Group in Leningrad Front, and the division ended the war containing the German forces in the Courland Pocket in Lithuania.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 94. Note that Sharp twice refers to the division in error as the \\"359th\\" on this page. Postwar Until October the division was posted on the Leningrad Front and the Baltic Military District. During that month the division was relocated by railway to the Turkestan Military District in the city of Termez. Arriving there at the start of November the whole division was housed in military camps for combat and political training until the end of the year. In November and December, new units were created. By September-October 1945, 360th Rifle Division (Military Unit No. 11090) was part of the 119th Rifle Corps with its headquarters at Dushanbe.Feskov et al 2013, 357. By May 1949 it had shifted into the 17th Rifle Corps. In April 1955, 360th Rifle Division was re-designated the 62nd Rifle Division.Feskov et al 2013, 538. In May 1957 the 62nd Rifle Division became the 108th Motor Rifle Division. Between World War II and late 1979 the division provided security for the Soviet Union along its southern borders. On 19 February 1962, 333rd Separate Equipment Maintenance and Recovery Battalion and 646th Separate Missile Battalion were formed. In 1968, the 271st Separate Sapper Battalion became a sapper-engineer unit. On 15 November 1972, the 738th Separate Anti-Tank Artillery Battalion was activated. Invasion of Afghanistan In December 1979, the division was part of the invasion force into Afghanistan. On December 13, 1979, the whole division was brought to full combat preparedness after years of partial disbandment. On December 24, the Minister of Defense signed a directive for the entry of Soviet troops in Afghanistan. The 781st Independent Reconnaissance Battalion became the first unit of the Soviet Army to cross into Afghanistan. At the same time, military transport planes carrying the 103rd Guards Airborne Division also crossed the border. On December 27, advance units of the 108th MRD entered Kabul to strengthen the protection of military administrative buildings. By mid-January 1980 the invasion of the 40th Army into Afghanistan was largely complete. The 108th MRD division headquarters was established at Khair Khana camp to the northwest of Kabul, on the road to Bagram airfield.Mohammed Yousaf and Mark Adkin, The Bear Trap: Afghanistan's Untold Story, 1992, 147-148. From 1980 to 1989 the division carried out tasks to ensure the safety of convoys along the Doshi-Kabul and Kabul-Jalalabad routes, and the protection of key facilities (Bagram airfield, grain elevators, fuel and lubricant supply depots, a power station in Kabul, a dam and hydroelectric power station site in Surubi, etc.) The division's operations in Afghanistan can be divided into four stages: *December 1979 - February 1980: entered Afghanistan and established bases. *March 1980 - April 1985: participated in active hostilities including large- scale operations, and worked to strengthen the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The division participated in the Panjsher VII offensive of April–May 1984, and the commander of the Afghan Bureau of the ISI at the time, Brigadier Mohammed Yousaf, says it was likely that Major-General Saratov, commander of the 108th MRD, commanded the operation.Yousaf and Adkin 1992, 70-72 During one battle, on April 30 in the Hazara Valley, the 1st Battalion of the 682nd Motor Rifle Regiment was decimated: the losses of Soviet troops were estimated at 60 KIA. *April 1985 - January 1987: transition from active operations to a role supporting Afghan troops using artillery and demolition units. The division assisted in the development of the armed forces of the DRA, and participated in the partial withdrawal of Soviet troops. *January 1987 - February 1989: assisted the Afghan leadership in carrying out the policy of national reconciliation, and continued the support of Afghan forces. The stages of the war in Afghanistan were not uniform and differed in terms of the intensity and types of military activities. Thus, the third and fourth stages were characterised by increased concentrations of rebel forces, and the creation of numerous military bases across Afghanistan with more active hostilities. In terms of sheer personnel, the 108th MRD was the largest division in the Soviet Armed Forces during the invasion of Afghanistan. During this period. V.I. Feskov states the division had four motor rifle regiments, the 177th, 180th, and 181st with BTRs; and the 682nd with BMPs.Feskov, V.I.; K.A. Kalashnikov, V.I. Golikov. (2004). The Soviet Army in the Years of the 'Cold War' (1945-1991). Tomsk: Tomsk University Press. , 63. Among the other regiments of the division was the 1415th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment. The division was the only one of its kind in the Armed Forces because of its structure and quantity of its weapons and other military equipment. On February 11, 1989, the Division acted as rearguard for the 40th Army as it was withdrawn from Afghanistan. The division was then based in Termez.  Uzbek service  In 1992, the division became part of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Uzbekistan. It fought in the Tajikistani Civil War. In 1993, the division was broken up into brigades.

The line is named after its two terminal cities Fuzhou and Xiamen, both coastal cities in Fujian. The line has a total length of 274.9 kilometres and forms part of China's Hangzhou–Fuzhou–Shenzhen passenger-dedicated railway. Construction began in 2005, and the line entered into operation on April 26, 2010. The line is used for both passenger and freight operations. Trains running on the line reached top speeds of 250 kilometres per hour, although that was later reduced to 200 km/h. As of 2015, passenger services on the line were approaching capacity. To increase capacity and improve travel times between Fujian Province's two largest cities, plans were announced in 2015 for the construction of a new parallel passenger dedicated railway called the Fuzhou–Xiamen passenger-dedicated line. Construction of this new railway started in 2017 and will roughly follow the existing Fuzhou–Xiamen railway, but will support a higher maximum speed of 350 km/h, further reducing travel times between the two cities to below one hour. Opening of the new line is scheduled for 2022. Route Jinjiang. The Fuzhou–Xiamen railway follows the rugged but prosperous coast of Fujian with 14 stations between Fuzhou South Station and Xiamen Station including Fuqing, Hanjiang, Putian, Xianyou, Quanzhou, Jinjiang, Xiamen North, Xinglin and Gaoqi. Bridges and tunnels account for over 37% of the line's total length. History The Fuzhou–Xiamen railway is the first railway between Fujian's two important most cities, Fuzhou, the provincial capital, and Xiamen, the province's most prosperous city. Most high-speed rail lines in China follow the routes of older conventional railroads, but there were no railways on the southeast coast prior to the introduction of high-speed rail. Historically, the southeast coastal region relied on maritime transportation, and rugged terrain made railway construction more expensive. In the first half of the 20th century, warfare and political instability delayed railway construction. During the Cold War, the southeast coast faced the threat of invasion from Republic of China on Taiwan and all railways were built inland. Only when political tensions across the Taiwan Strait eased in the late 1990s did planning of the Fuzhou–Xiamen railway take place. The project was approved by the State Council in July 2004. Construction began in September 2005 and was completed in December 2009. Commercial operation began on April 26, 2010. Unlike later Chinese high-speed rail lines which were built to higher speed standards of 300 or 350 km/h, the Fuzhou–Xiamen line was built to the 250 km/h standard with the capacity for upgrade to 300 km/h. The opening of high-speed rail line greatly reduced travel times by rail on the coast of Fujian. Passenger train service on the line average 200 km/h. The trip from Fuzhou to Xiamen on the non-stop express train takes 1 hr. 28 min. compared to the 10-hour train ride via railroads that cut inland. The trip by long-distance bus on the express highway takes 2.5 to 4 hours. In the first year of operation from 2010 to 2011, the line carried over 18 million passengers, averaging 50,000 per day, and reported occupancy rates exceeding 100%. Competitiveness Occupancy rate on the Fuxia line is among the highest of China's high-speed railways. The line offers competitive fares and passes through large cities with well- developed public transportation and high demand for intercity travel. As of February 2011, a regular ticket from Fuzhou to Xiamen costs ¥85, and a first class ticket costs ¥103. Drivers making the same trip by express highway will pay ¥300-400 including gas and tolls, and spend 1.5 more hours on the road. During the Chinese New Year, the peak season for intercity travel, the number of long distance bus trips between Fuzhou and Xiamen fell from 98 per day in 2010 to just 7 per day in 2011. Long distance bus ridership from Fuzhou to Xiamen fell by 83%, to Quanzhou by 63%, to Jinjiang by 50%, to Shishi by 25% and to Putian by 38%. In August 2015, it was announced that a parallel passenger-dedicated line (resulting in journey time savings) would be built between Fuzhou and Zhangzhou on account of the existing line having reached its capacity.

The Hiro Type 14 engine design was based on the Napier Lion. Like the parent engine, and the Lorraine 12 Eb, it had three banks of four cylinders each, with the center bank upright, and the other two banks angled outward 60 degrees. In some cases the W engine is referred to as the broad arrow configuration, due to its shape resembling the British government broad arrow property mark. The first aircraft to be powered by a Type 14 engine was the Hiro H2H flying boat.Mikesh and Abe p.96 Design and development Japan's military leaders discovered the value of aircraft while participating in World War I.Mikesh and Abe p.10 It was necessary to import all of its military aircraft and engines as there was no aviation manufacturing industry in Japan at that time. The Imperial Japanese did not want to rely on foreign products,Mikesh and Abe p.45 yet that was all that was available. To remedy this, Japan began importing state-of-the-art aircraft from around the world, and after close examination and study they incorporated the best features of each into their own design, thereby creating a uniquely superior Japanese designed and built product. In late 1928 the IJN imported a Supermarine Southampton II from Britain. The Southampton was a twin-engine biplane flying boat, with the 500 hp (373 kW) Napier Lion VA W-block tractor engines mounted between the wings. It was one of the most successful flying boats of the between-war period. In 1929, Lieut- Cdr (Ordnance) Jun Okamura was assigned as chief designer to assist in the design of a new Japanese aircraft using the Southampton as a starting point. After performance testing at Yokosuka, the Southampton was ferried to the Hiro Naval Arsenal for further study. Testing and evaluation revealed several construction innovations when compared to the German flying boats that were also undergoing evaluation. Those features included an all-metal hull and simplified construction, both of which the Japanese Navy hoped to incorporate into the replacement for the outdated Type 15 Flying-boat. The Napier Lion engines were closely examined by the engineers at Hiro as well. They were charged with creating a new Japanese designed and built engine based on the Napier engine that powered the Supermarine Southampton II. The new engine was identified as the Type 14 engine, as it was accepted in the 14th year of Emperor Taishō's reign, as that was the designation method used at the time. The 550 hp Type 14 engine, although notionally more powerful than the Napier Lion, flight tests of the H2H indicated the Type 14 engine had poor performance due to insufficient power, and it was replaced by the 600 hp Hiro Type 91 engine (an enlarged development of the Type 14) when manufacturing was shifted to Aichi in 1931.Mikesh and Abe p.97 Applications *Hiro H2H1 Specifications See also References =Notes= =Bibliography= * Hiro Type 14 ","title":"Hiro Type 14"},{"id":"32055441","text":"Laurel Hill is a census-designated place in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States.

To reach centimeter-level — or even better — accuracy of positioning typically requires use of precise dual-frequency carrier phase observations. Furthermore, these observations are usually processed using a differential GNSS (DGNSS) algorithm, such as real time kinematic (RTK) or post-processing (PP). Regardless of the specific differential algorithm, however, implicit in the process is an assumption that the quality of the reference station data is consistent with the desired level of positioning accuracy. The virtual reference station (VRS) concept can help to satisfy this requirement using a network of reference stations. As a quick review, a typical DGNSS setup consists of a single reference station from which the raw data (or corrections) are sent to the rover receiver (i.e., the user). The user then forms the carrier phase differences (or corrects their raw data) and performs the data processing using the differential corrections. In contrast, GNSS network architectures often make use of multiple reference stations. This approach allows a more precise modeling of distance-dependent systematic errors principally caused by ionospheric and tropospheric refractions, and satellite orbit errors. More specifically, a GNSS network decreases the dependence of the error budget on the distance of nearest antenna.

Its goal was to re-establish the Second International. However it did not support World Revolution and rejected involvement with the Communist International. The initiative grew out of the failure of a group of social democratic parties to hold a conference in Stockholm in 1917. Hjalmar Branting rejected any role for the dictatorship of the proletariat arguing it could not lead to socialism. Karl Kautsky and Eduard Bernstein urged the conference to condemn the Bolsheviks and their seizure of power in Russia. Branting moved a resolution which supported the ideology of bourgeois democracy and greeted the revolution in Soviet Russia, but which also denounced the dictatorship of the proletariat. Whilst this gained much support, a group of delegates led by Friedrich Adler and Jean Longuet proposed a resolution calling on the conference to avoid taking a definite stand on Soviet Russia, as there was a lack of information about the situation there. To remedy this they proposed that a commission should be sent to Russia to study the economic and political situation there so that the question of Bolshevism could be discussed at the next Congress. The commission was to be led by Adler, Kautsky, and Rudolf Hilferding. The Soviet regime agreed to admit the commission, but in return requested the admittance of the Soviet commission to those countries whose representatives were on the Berne commission. The Soviet government received no reply to this request and the commission proposed at the conference never visited Russia.

Its dunes are dominated by beachgrass and seaside goldenrod. = Goosewing Beach Preserve = Goosewing Beach with Quicksand Pond on the left and Rhode Island Sound on the right The Goosewing Beach Preserve, a preserve consisting of shore, ponds and dunes created 12,000 years ago by retreating glaciers, is considered one of Rhode Island's most scenic places. It is overseen by The Nature Conservancy. Working with the Little Compton Agricultural Conservancy Trust and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, the Goosewing Beach Preserve was purchased in 1989 by The Nature Conservancy and its partners. Conservancy staff have actively managed breeding populations of piping plover and least tern since then. Goosewing Beach Preserve was listed as one world's best eco-friendly beaches by CNN, as a “Don’t Miss\\" by the Boston Globe, and as one of the 500 places to see before they disappear by Frommer's.  The Benjamin Family Environmental Center  The Benjamin Family Environmental Center at the Goosewing Beach Preserve The Nature Conservancy of Rhode Island opened The Benjamin Family Environmental Center on July 11, 2010. The Benjamin Family Environmental Center has programs and exhibits about the many types of habitats that make up the Quicksand Pond and Goosewing Beach Preserve areas. The Nature Conservancy hires a Plover Warden and a Goosewing Beach Preserve Manager during nesting season (mid-April to early-September) to monitor and protect the species and to help educate beach-goers about the sensitive wildlife that inhabit the area.

As the Health Department continued to investigate the Quicksand Pond case, it found no evidence to support the initial FDA alarm. There were no reports of anyone getting sick, and further testing failed to show any significant signs of bacteria from human waste in the pond. 50 bushels of oysters were embargoed and destroyed.

The book was promoted with the claim it was the first time the Conan Doyle Estate had authorised a new non-Doyle Sherlock Holmes pastiche. Plot summary The House of Silk begins with a brief, personal recounting of events by Watson, much like that in A Study in Scarlet by the original author, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The reader is informed of the particulars regarding the first meeting of Watson and Holmes, including the circumstances of the Afghan War and a mention of the case that was \\"too shocking to be revealed until now.\\" The client of \\"The Flat Cap case\\" is introduced as a man by the name of Edmund Carstairs, an art dealer whose paintings had been destroyed by a gang of Irish robbers. After the murder of Carstairs' client, and a failure on the part of a hired detective, he turns to Sherlock Holmes, who employs the aid of the Baker Street Irregulars, and upon locating the hotel wherein the supposed Keelan O'Donaghue (one of the leaders of the gang) is currently staying, one of the newest recruits of the Irregulars, a boy named Ross, is stationed to wait outside until Holmes, Watson, and Mr. Carstairs arrive. When the group finally arrives, Ross appears inexplicably horror-stricken and is later found brutally murdered by the thugs of the House of Silk. When Holmes makes inroads with the House of Silk case, he is framed for murder and sent to prison. Meanwhile, Watson meets with a mystery criminal, later revealed as Professor Moriarty, who provides him with a key to free Holmes from prison, before the detective can be assassinated. Professor Moriarty's motives are uncertain, except that he wishes Holmes to rid the world of the House of Silk, whose activities apparently appall even him. When Watson arrives at the prison, he discovers Holmes has escaped of his own accord, disguised as an aide to the prison doctor, whom he had once helped as a client. Various leads draw them to a travelling funfair, where they are ambushed, before being saved by Lestrade. The party (Holmes, Watson, Lestrade) makes its way to the \\"House of Silk\\", a club operated by a pastor and his wife who also govern a boy's orphanage, and rent the boys to wealthy customers. The members are promptly rounded up by Scotland Yard. Despite their arrests, however, the case does not come to trial, due to a royal family member having been purportedly involved. It is eventually revealed that Mrs. Carstairs is the true person responsible for The Flat Cap case, being the second leader of the Irish gang. Critical reception Critical reports were generally positive. On Anthony Horowitz's official site a review of The Guardian was posted, stating: > So, all of the elements are there: the data, the data, the data. Nothing of > consequence overlooked. And yet can Horowitz, like Holmes, make from these > drops of water the possibilities of an Atlantic or a Niagara? Can he > astonish us? Can he thrill us? Are there \\"the rapid deductions, as swift as > intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis\\" that we yearn for? > Emphatically, yes.http://anthonyhorowitz.com/newscentre/sherlock- > holmes/house-of-silk-the-guardian-review/322/ Allusions to other literary works In chapter one there is some mention of C. Auguste Dupin, a character developed by author Edgar Allan Poe, and his ability to make astounding deductions based on visible emotions reflected through the physical medium. Holmes demonstrates this by uncovering Watson's anxiety and the source thereof. This mention of Dupin is in itself a reference to a reference made by Conan Doyle to the character in the first Holmes novel A Study in Scarlet. The supporting character Ephraim Hardcastle (the landlord of the Bag of Nails pub, whose name is revealed in chapter eight) is a reference to the newspaper column of the same name in The Daily Mail as written pseudonymously by Nigel Dempster and subsequently Peter McKay. Sequel Horowitz announced a second installment entitled Moriarty, but this time Holmes only appears at the end. Moreover, those detectives that Holmes had worked with in previous cases, such as Athelney Jones and Lestrade, were present.

Route The Wenzhou–Fuzhou railway follows the rugged but prosperous coast of southern Zhejiang and northern Fujian with in the former and in the latter. Bridges and tunnels account for over 78% of the line's total length. Major cities along route include Rui'an, Cangnan, Fuding, Ningde, Luoyuan and Lianjiang. History The Wenzhou–Fuzhou railway is the first railway to connect the two neighboring provinces. Most high-speed rail lines in China follow the routes of older conventional railroads, but there were no railways on the southeast coast prior to the building of high-speed rail. Historically, the southeast coastal region relied on maritime transportation, and rugged terrain made railway construction more expensive. In the first half of the 20th century, warfare and political instability delayed railway construction. During the Cold War, the southeast coast faced the threat of invasion from Republic of China on Taiwan and all railways were built inland. Only when political tensions across the Taiwan Strait eased in the late 1990s did planning of the Wenzhou–Fuzhou railway take place. In October 2002, the project was initially approved by the National Development and Reform Commission as a single-track railway at the standard. The project was then upgraded to a double-track standard and received State Council approval in 2004. Construction on an experimental basis began in December 2004 and on a full-scale in August 2005. Track-laying was completed in April 2009. Freight and passenger service began, respectively on July 1 and September 28, 2009.

He was the leading sire in North America of 1928 and the leading broodmare sire in both 1936 and 1940. Background High Time was bred in Kentucky by Wickliffe Stud, a partnership between Price McKinney and Ed Corrigan. During his racing career, he was owned by Henry Porter. He was sired by Ultimus, who never raced due to unsoundness but became an influential sire. High Time's dam, Noonday, was a stakes winning daughter of Domino who also produced four other stakes winners (High Noon, Besom, Suffragette and Meeting House) and two notable broodmares, Meridian and Noontide. Her female line is still active, most notably producing Triple Crown winner Justify in 2018. High Time had badly conformed forelegs, magnified by his being a \\"bleeder\\" – he bled through the nostrils during his races – which limited his stamina. His trainer Phil Chinn once commented that High Time was the only horse that he knew of who could enter the stretch leading by 15 lengths only to lose by 80.  Race Career  High Time made seven starts at age two at a time when this was considered a light campaign. His only victory came on June 24, 1918 in the Hudson Stakes at Aqueduct, when he \\"spreadeagled the field\\" to win in :58 2/5 for five furlongs, breaking the stakes record by two seconds and the track record by two-fifths. He also placed third in the Great American Stakes.Kentucky: A Guide to the Bluegrass State By Federal Writers' Project  Stud Career  Little was expected of High Time at stud and he had very limited opportunities in his first few years. This changed when his first crop reached racing age and started to win. Chinn brought a part interest in the stallion and relocated him to his Himyar Stud in Kentucky. In 1926, Chinn paid $50,000 to buy-out the remaining half interest. Chinn was later forced to disperse his stock and High Time was sold in 1931 to Charles T. Fisher for $50,000, an unexpected bargain for a stallion valued at $100,000. High Time stood at Dixiana Farm for the remainder of his career. High Time became known as a source of speed and was the leading sire in North America of 1928. He also ranked in the top 20 on 12 other occasions. His get included Hall of Famer and two-time American Horse of the Year Sarazen and 1928 Champion Two Year Old Colt High Strung. Over half of his 289 progeny won at the age of two. High Time was also the leading broodmare sire in 1936 and 1940. His daughters produced multiple winners such as True North, Top Row and Eight Thirty. High Time died of natural causes on November 23, 1937 at the age of 21. He is buried in an unmarked grave on the grounds of Dixiana Farm in Lexington, Kentucky.tbheritage.com Pedigree High Time is inbred (3S x 3S x 2D) to Domino, meaning this stallion appears twice in the third generation of the sire's side of the pedigree and once in the second generation. Such a high degree of inbreeding is unusual and may have contributed to his unsoundness.

The line, also known as the Yongtaiwen railway, is named after the three primary cities along route: Ningbo, whose abbreviated Chinese name is Yong, Taizhou and Wenzhou. The line has a total length of 282.4 kilometres and forms part of China's Southeast Coast high- speed rail corridor. Construction began in October 2005, and the line opened to commercial service on September 28, 2009. Trains running on the line reach top speeds of 250 kilometres per hour, and the shortest trip between Ningbo and Wenzhou takes 1 hour 12 minutes. Route The Ningbo–Taizhou–Wenzhou railway follows the rugged but prosperous coast of Zhejiang. Major cities and towns along route include Fenghua, Ninghai, Sanmen, Linhai, Taizhou, Huangyan, Luqiao, Wenling, Yueqing, Yongjia, and Ouhai. At Ningbo, the line joins the Xiaoshan–Ningbo railway and the Hangzhou–Ningbo passenger-dedicated line. At Wenzhou, the line joins the Wenzhou–Fuzhou railway. Here you can see the Wenzhou Train Station of the Ningbo–Taizhou–Wenzhou railway line. History The Ningbo–Taizhou–Wenzhou railway is the first railway to be built on the east coast of Zhejiang. Most high-speed rail lines in China follow the routes of older conventional railroads, but there were no railways on the southeast coast prior to the building of high-speed rail. Historically, the southeast coastal region relied on maritime transportation, and rugged terrain made railway construction more expensive. In the first half of the 20th century, warfare and political instability delayed railway construction. During the Cold War, the southeast coast faced the threat of invasion from Republic of China on Taiwan and all railways were built inland. Only when political tensions across the Taiwan Strait eased in the late 1990s did planning of the Yongtaiwen Line proceed. Construction began commenced in 2005 and track-laying was completed on May 15, 2009. Commercial service began on September 28, 2009. Accident On 23 July 2011, CRH train D3115, running from Hangzhou to Fuzhou South came to a halt over a viaduct near Wenzhou South after losing its power. Shortly afterwards, CRH train D301, running from Beijing South to Fuzhou, rear-ended the stationary D3115. The accident led to 35 deaths and 211 injured, raising concerns about the safety of the fast-expanding high-speed railway network of China.

Major cities and towns along route include Zhangzhou, Zhao'an, Raoping, the Chaoshan region (Chaozhou and Shantou), Puning, Shanwei, Huidong and Huizhou. History The Xiamen–Shenzhen railway is the first railway to be built on the southern coast of China. Most high-speed rail lines in China follow the routes of older conventional railroads, but there were no railways on the southeast coast before the arrival of high-speed rail. Historically, the southeast coastal region relied on maritime transportation, and rugged terrain made railway construction more expensive. In the first half of the 20th century, warfare and political instability delayed railway construction. During the Cold War, the southeast coast faced the threat of invasion from Republic of China on Taiwan and all railways were built inland. Only when political tensions across the Taiwan Strait eased in the late 1990s did planning of the Xiashen Line proceed. Construction of the Xiashen Line commenced in November 2007 and the line was initially expected to open in 2011. But the anticipated completion was repeatedly delayed due to further safety reviews and inspections after the Wenzhou High-Speed rail crash. In December 2012, the anticipated opening date was pushed to October 2013.\\"Xiamen-Shenzhen high-speed railway expected to open in Oct, 2013\\" WhatsonXiamen 2012-12-02 Test runs did not commence until November 2013.\\"Rail line starts trial runs\\" Shenzhen Daily 2013-12-02 The line officially opened on December 28, 2013 with trains running from Shenzhen North to Shanghai Hongqiao.\\"New rail brings delta cities closer\\" Shenzhen Daily 2013-12-30 On 2017, cumulative ridership of the line exceeded 53 million passengers, with daily services increased to 101 pairs.

Postproduction release: 1997.\\"http://www.der.org/films/incidents-of-travel.html DER website\\" This ethnographic film can be considered as a combination of the documentary film styles that Bill Nichols calls the participatory and the performative modes.http://www.mediaknowall.com/as_alevel/Documentary/docu_index.php While shooting the film, the filmmakers emphasized techniques of cinéma verité as pioneered in anthropological films by Jean Rouch. It has become a classic film text in the anthropology of tourism for its portrayal of the economic, social, cultural and political conflicts surrounding a major international tourism destination based on archaeological heritage. It is also a classic in the anthropology of religion and used as a vivid ethnographic account of New Age spiritualists and their practices.  Film Locations  This ethnographic film was shot entirely on location at the archaeological and tourism site of Chichén Itzá and the nearby Maya Indian community of Pisté, Yucatán, México, during the spring equinox of 1995 and 1997. The film was shot during the equinox event at Chichen Itza and includes interviews and footage with New Age Spiritualists, State archaeology authorities, secular tourists, artisans, venders, local political leaders.  Ethnographic Analysis of the Spring Equinox at Chichen Itza  The equinox event is a state-sponsored tourism ritual and celebration of the Maya. In 1928 after reconstructing the main pyramid of Chichén Itzá, which is called the Castillo (or Castle) and the Pyramid of Kukulcan, archaeologists noticed a peculiar phenomena involving the setting sun and the pyramid. Specifically, the setting sun casts shadow of the northwest corner of the pyramid onto the balustrade of the north staircase. Beginning in 1974 this began to be interpreted as the symbolic descent of K'uk'ulcan. The name of this god is often translated as Feathered Serpent but is a literal rendition in Maya of the Nahautl name Quetzalcoatl. Beginning in 1984 the State Government of Yucatán, Mexico, in collaboration with the federal National Institute of Anthropology and History, began to develop a tourist ritual celebration that included traditional Yucatec dance called Jarana, reconstructed pre-columbian dances and music, classical Yucatec guitar trios and an explanation of the equinox phenomenon according to the most prevalent and dominant archaeoastronomical interpretation. Performers included both professionals and student groups ranging in age from children to adult dance and music groups throughout the state. It was a general celebration of Maya and Yucatecan cultures. Following the first nationally televised vernal equinox in 1984 and the publications of new age maya books such as José Argüelles, The Mayan Factor, this event began to attract various types of new age religious groups, including contemporary Mexican Gnostics, Aztec Revivialists, US New Age Spiritualists, and other fringe sects. See https://www.flickr.com/photos/der/211080687/in/photostream/ Sources: Quetzil Castaneda, Chapter 6, \\"Vernal Return and Cosmos: That Serpent on the Balustrade and the New Age Invasion.\\" In the Museum of Maya Culture, 1996.\\"In the Museum of Maya Culture, by Quetzil Castaneda (University of Minnesota Press, 1996)\\"  Description of the Ethnographic Film  This original ethnographic video depicts how New Agers, the Mexican state, tourists, and 1920s archaeologists all contend to “clear” the site of the antique Maya city of Chichen Itza in order to produce their own idealized and unobstructed visions of “Maya” while the local Maya themselves struggle to occupy the site as vendors and artisans. The setting is the spring Equinox when a shadow said to represent the Maya serpent-god Kukulkan appears on one temple pyramid. As more than 40,000 New Age spiritualists and secular tourists from the United States and Mexico converge to witness this solar phenomenon, the video depicts the surrounding social event as a complicated entanglement of expected dualisms concerning tourism. Going beyond previous films that reduce tourism to neo-colonial and exoticizing social relations, this video portrays a Maya cultural site where US New Agers — rather than local Mayas — appear as exotic ritualists who are on display for other secular tourists and for local Mayas. While the video does examine representations of Mayas by visiting New Agers as part of globalizing discourses on the exotic and evolution, it also shows how during the ongoing economic crisis resident Mayas struggle against the Mexican state — rather than against tourists — that regularly “sweeps” them from the tourist zone in order to anchor the nation in an image of pure antiquity. This video also asks what kind of fieldwork is possible at such a spectacle and it questions the status of ethnographic authority as people from the various groups converging on the event, including the anthropologist-videomakers, ironically trade positions as well as compete to speak about the Maya. The essay \\"Performative Pilgrims and the Shifting Grounds of Anthropological Documentary,\\" by Luis Vivanco contextualizes this example of cinéma verité filmmaking among anthropological and documentary films and analyzes the film's portrayal of religious pilgrimage.

Location and route  The ridgeway runs parallel to the Salzach valley at a height of around 2,000 metres along the crest that separates the high Alpine valley from the Glemmtal to the north. The entire route lies in the region known as the Pinzgau. The mountain trail begins on the high Schmittenhöhe, the local mountain for the town of Zell am See, which can be reached by cable car. From there it runs westwards over the Kettingtörl (1,780 m) to the Kettingkopf (1,865 m), south of which is the Pinzgau Hut (1,700 m), an important base for the Pinzgau Ridgeway. The ridgeway continues, in places, along the crest itself, but mainly runs just below it on its southern side. Long climbs are rare, the path mainly lying between 1,800 m and 2,000 m. En route there are several refuge huts at crossings such as the 1,993 m high Klammscharte ridge or the 2,059 m high Klingertörl.Pinzgauer Spaziergang at www.almrausch.de. Accessed on 12 Jun 2011. A number of alpine huts (Almhütten) along the ridgeway offer overnight accommodation. Several variations of the route enable summits to be ascended, such as those of the Maurerkogel (2,074 m), the Hochkogel (2,249 m), the Bärensteigkopf (2,225 m), the Manlitzkogel (2,247 m) or the Leitenkogel (2,015 m). The route then via over the 1,699 m high Bürgl Hut through the Mühlbach valley down to Stuhlfelden in the Salzach valley.  Character  The Pinzgau Ridgeway is a relatively easy and well-signed hiking trail without any major technical difficulties; only some of the variations over the summits are more challenging. There are no major differences in height to be conquered; in all the route climbs some 500 metres if the cable car to the Schmittenhöhe is taken at the beginning. Although there are several options to tackle the route over several days, experienced hikers can complete it in just one day. Usually though, walkers stop overnight at the Pinzgau Hut or the Sonnbergalm. The Pinzgau Ridgeway is part of Route 02 A, an Austrian long-distance path. The particular attraction of this trail is its constant view of the highest summits of Austria's High Tauern and the valley of the River Salzach before them. In the western section the ridgeway has impressive views of the Zillertal Alps. The crest itself is part of the Kitzbühel Alps, whose gently, only rarely rocky slate summits, belong to the greywacke zone.  Variations and extensions  The ridgeway may also be joined from the north from the Glemm valley and its western end can be accessed from the hamlet of Lengau in the municipality of Saalbach-Hinterglemm. If only half the route is walked, there is the option of ascending or descending on the cable car from Saalbach-Hinterglemm to the 2,096 m high Schattberg, about four kilometres north of the Hochkogel.Pinzgau Walk at www.schmitten.at.

Dvija Madhab was born in Saptagram-Tribeni region of modern-day Hooghly district of Indian state of West Bengal. His father Parashar, as mentioned in the Sarada Charit, was a Brahmin.

The area is known for its history, particularly regarding Rhaetic, Roman, and Germanic archaeological sites; its trilingualism (German, Ladin, and Italian), and its viticulture; the Gewürztraminer grape originated here. The region should not be confused with the Tyrolean Unterland in the Austrian state of Tyrol. Geography The Adige valley between the Fiemme Mountains in the east and the Nonsberg Group in the west is part of an important north-south transport route, traversed by the Brenner Autobahn (Autostrada A22, part of the European route E45) and the Brenner Railway line from Innsbruck to Verona. Mitterberg seen from Auer The South Tyrolean Unterland comprises the valley municipalities of Auer, Bronzolo, Kurtatsch, Kurtinig, Laives, Margreid, Montan, Neumarkt, Salorno, Tramin, and Vadena as well as the mountain communities of Aldein, Altrei in the Fiemme Valley, and Truden. Neumarkt usually rates as the chief town of the Unterland area, though the largest settlement is Laives (Leifers). The adjacent municipalities of Eppan and Kaltern in the west, beyond the Mitterberg massif, form the separate Überetsch area. Both are part of the South Tyrolean Überetsch-Unterland district.  History  After the fall of the Roman Empire and the Migration Period, the Adige valley south of Bolzano was gradually settled by Bavarian peasants from the 6th century onwards. By 800 AD, the border region with the Italian Duchy of Tridentum was incorporated in the Carolingian duchy of Bavaria, which itself formed a constituent stem duchy of the German kingdom and of the Holy Roman Empire from 962 onwards. In the 12th and 13th century, the Counts of Tyrol continued to expand their dominant possession in the region and finally achieved independency from the Bavarian dukes as well as from the prince-bishops of Trent and Brixen. In 1363 the Tyrolean lands fell to the Austrian House of Habsburg. The Unterland area remained a transition zone between the German and Italian lands for centuries.Hannes Obermair: How to Record a Conflict? The Communities of the German Part of the Diocese of Trent during the Late Middle Ages. In: Marco Bellabarba, Hannes Obermair, Hitomi Sato (eds.): Communities and Conflicts in the Alps from the Late Middle Ages to Early Modernity. (Fondazione Bruno Kessler. Contributi/Beiträge. 30). Bologna-Berlin: Il mulino—Duncker & Humblot 2015. , pp. 101–118 (pp. 103–105). A distinct language border did not develop until early modern times; during rising 19th century nationalism it was consolidated at the Adige narrow south of Salorno (Salurner Klause, Chiusa di Salorno). When after World War I the Tyrolean lands up to Brenner Pass fell to the Kingdom of Italy according to the 1915 Treaty of London, the Italian authorities shifted the border northwards and from 1921 the entire Unterland area up to Bronzolo belonged to the Trentino province. The Fascist regime in Italy decided to force the so-called mixed-language regions to be Italianised while German South Tyroleans insisted on the Salorno border (see Bozner Bergsteigerlied). Castelfeder hill and Adige valley After the war, German- speaking activists again demanded the return of the Unterland to the South Tyrol province. On 30 May 1946 a large protest rally on the Castelfeder hill near Neumarkt was organised by the newly established South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP). By the First Statute of Autonomy of South Tyrol in 1948, the Unterland was finally affiliated with the Bolzano province. Since 1975, the area is part of the South Tyrolean Überetsch-Unterland district.

From 1966 to 1969, he was director of planning at the Office de planification et de développment du Québec. He briefly entered the Canadian federal civil service in 1969 as assistant deputy minister of supply and services, but returned to Quebec in 1970 to become assistant secretary of the province's treasury board. In 1973, he was promoted to secretary.Bernier, \\"Leadership,\\" p. 224.

Wald, \\"New England Will Buy Electricity from Quebec Under Big Contract,\\" New York Times, 15 October 1985.

Ian MacDonald, \\"Winners and losers,\\" Montreal Gazette, 7 November 2001, B3. In 2004, Coulombe was appointed by the Quebec government to chair a commission on the management of the province's public forests. The commission concluded that the forests were over-harvested, recommended a 20 per cent cut in production, and argued for a more ecologically sound and decentralized approach.\\"The QFIC Recommends Making Certification of Forestry Practices Compulsory,\\" Canada NewsWire, 15 April 2004, 11:13; \\"Toward forest management that is integrated, decentralized and transparent,\\" Canada NewsWire, 14 December 2004, 11:01; \\"The main priorities for improving the management of Québec's public forests,\\" Canada NewsWire, 14 December 2004, 11:01; Jocelyne Richer, \\"Quebec forests are overharvested, some cutting should be reduced: report,\\" Canadian Press, 14 December 2004, 21:25; Konrad Yakabuski, \\"Forest industry needs to grow up,\\" Globe and Mail, 6 April 2005, B2.

Archer Fred Robert Archer (December 3, 1889 - April 27, 1963), was an American photographer who collaborated with Ansel Adams to create the Zone System. He was a portrait photographer, specializing early in his career in portraits of Hollywood movie stars. He was associated with the artistic trend in photography known as pictorialism. He later became a photography teacher, and ran his own photography school for many years. Along with Edward Weston, whose portrait he took, Archer was known as one of the \\"two big names in art photography in those days out on the west coast\\". He socialized with and exchanged ideas with many other artists and intellectuals in Los Angeles for decades. He was \\"without a doubt, the individual with the longest history of participation in the Southern California Salon movement.\\" Early life Edward Weston, taken by Fred Archer in approximately 1915 He was born on December 3, 1889 in Georgia, and his family moved to Los Angeles, California. Archer was experimenting with photography as early as 1915, when he made a portrait of Edward Weston. Archer served in a military aerial photography unit in France in World War I, and returned to the United States in May, 1919. He began studying commercial art, and photography was at that time a hobby of his. In less than a year, Archer gained critical attention in two east coast photography journals, American Photography and Photo-era Magazine, which reported that he had exhibited five \\"somber\\" photos of the World War I battlefields of France at the Seventh Pittsburgh Salon. In the early 1920s, he was hired as assistant head of the Art Title Department for Universal Pictures and was promoted to head the department the following year. He soon moved on to motion picture photography. Hollywood portrait photographer He worked for Warner Brothers as a portrait photographer until 1929, and later worked for Paramount Pictures. He also became a pioneer of advertising photography on the west coast. In 1928, he wrote an influential article along with fellow photographer Elmer Fryer called \\"Still photography in motion picture work\\". Fryer succeeded Archer as head of photography at Warner Brothers in 1929. Their article described the importance of still photography in advertising, marketing, production reference work and trick photography. According to Archer and Fryer, \\"A good 'still' will attract and hold attention where many poor ones will receive but a passing glance. Photography has striven for years to gain acceptance among the arts and the struggle has been long and hard. It is only within the last few years that photography has been raised from pure mechanics and given its well deserved place with the other arts.\\" Their slogan was \\"the still sells the movies\\" which was a Hollywood truism for many years. Teacher and photography school In 1935, Archer helped found the photography department and served as professor of photography at the Art Center School. Archer was considered \\"for many years a popular teacher and lecturer\\" who then went on to serve as director of education at his own Fred Archer School of Photography in Los Angeles, which he founded after World War II. Zone System Archer collaborated with Ansel Adams to codify the Zone System, which is a photographic technique for determining optimal film exposure and development. The technique is based on the late 19th century sensitometry studies of Hurter and Driffield, and provides photographers with a systematic method of precisely defining the relationship between the way they visualize the photographic subject and the final results. Although it originated with black- and-white sheet film, the Zone System is also applicable to roll film, both black-and-white and color, negative and reversal, and to digital photography. Archer and Adams formulated the system while teaching together at the Art Center School in Los Angeles. Ansel Adams went out of his way to give Archer equal credit for the Zone System: \\"I take this opportunity to restate that the Zone System is not an invention of mine; it is a codification of the principles of sensitometry, worked out by Fred Archer and myself at the Art Center School in Los Angeles, around 1939-40.\\" Fred Archer on Portraiture Cover of Fred Archer on PortraitureArcher's only book, Fred Archer on Portraiture, was published in 1948. The book was a \\"popular text\\" that \\"remained in print for a number of years\\", and was reviewed in several national photography magazines. Legacy In 1959, Archer won the annual Stuyvesant Peabody Memorial Award, given to a member of the Photographic Society of America \\"who has contributed significantly to Pictorial Photography\\". Archer's photos were featured in a 1980-1981 show \\"Southern California Photography, 1900-1965: An Historical Survey\\" at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, alongside the work of Edward Weston, Man Ray, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, and Imogen Cunningham. The show was part of the bicentennial celebration of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has seven photos by Archer in its permanent collection, including a self- portrait, described as a \\"surrealistic image of his face merging with the front of a large format camera and an obedient fly resting on his trigger finger\\".

She was much admired in her lifetime as a portraitist, although most of her portraits are now lost or unattributed. Her work, such as her many Madonna and Child paintings, earned her a fine reputation as an artist. Life and work Barbara Longhi was born on 21 September 1552 in the northern Italian city of Ravenna, where she spent her entire life. Her father, Luca Longhi (1507–1580), was a well-known Mannerist painter, and her older brother Francesco (1544–1618) was also a painter. Both siblings received painting education from their father and were part of his studio, with Barbara assisting in such projects as work on large altarpieces. She also modeled, and gained some familiarity with the process of marketing her artwork to patrons. Although her training was completed by 1570, her ties to her family and to her father's workshop remained strong. Very little is known of her life, not even whether she was ever married. Virgin and Child with Saint, ca. 1590–95 Longhi was very respected as a portraitist, but only one of her portraits, the Camaldolese Monk, is known today. This is also her only known painting depicting an adult male, and one of only a few that includes a date (although the last digit is not entirely legible; it may be 1570 or 1573). Longhi's father had depicted her as Saint Barbara in his 1570 painting Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints. Longhi also probably modeled for her father's Nuptials of Cana. Her Saint Catherine of Alexandria (above) bears a strong resemblance to her father's depictions of her in the two paintings mentioned above, and it is generally acknowledged as a self-portrait. Of Longhi's portrayal of herself as the aristocratic, cultured Saint Catherine of Alexandria, Irene Graziani writes that \\"when she exhibits an image of herself, Barbara, too, is presented according to the model of the virtuous, elegant and erudite woman, revisiting the themes which Lavinia [Fontana] had developed several years earlier in Bologna, according to a repertoire tied to late Mannerism\\". It has been suggested that Longhi may have presented her self-portrait as the devotional image of a saint in order to avoid the appearance of indulging in the sin of vanity. Originally commissioned for the monastery of Sant'Apollinare in Classe, the painting was acquired by the Museo d'Arte della Città di Ravenna in 1829, and underwent a restoration in 1980. Several other of her depictions of Catherine of Alexandria exist. Most of Longhi's paintings are unsigned, but on one she included the initials \\"B.L.F.\\", standing for \\"Barbara Longhi fecit\\" (\\"made by Barbara Longhi\\") and on another, \\"B.L.P.\\", for \\"Barbara Longhi pinxit\\" (\\"painted by Barbara Longhi\\"). As almost all of her work was unsigned, it is unknown how many paintings she created or are still in existence. Only about fifteen are definitively attributed to her. Of those, about twelve are paintings of the Virgin and Child; such paintings were very popular during the Counter-Reformation. It is thought that some of her works may be erroneously attributed to her father. Among Longhi's paintings which do not depict the Madonna is Judith with the Head of Holofernes (ca. 1570–75). This subject was also painted by other female artists including Fede Galizia, Elisabetta Sirani and Artemisia Gentileschi. Longhi's version differs greatly from two versions painted by Gentileschi in that it does not depict the violent act; instead, her Judith appears to seek forgiveness as she looks heavenward. This is consistent with Counter-Reformation ideas about willingness to admit guilt, and believing in absolution for the penitent. Madonna Adoring the Child, ca. 1600–05 The simplicity of composition and subtle colour palette used in her paintings also reflect the doctrines of the Counter-Reformation. Her relatively small works, as opposed to the large altarpieces created by her father, are indicative of their intended emphasis on devotional thoughts. She sought to evoke empathy in the viewer with her subjects. She resisted the trend to create huge Biblical scenes, instead concentrating on serene depictions of the Virgin and Child. Her artistic influences included Raphael, Antonio da Correggio, Parmigianino, Marcantonio Raimondi, and Agostino Veneziano. The international success of famed female Italian painter Sofonisba Anguissola may have also served as an inspiration. While influenced by these major figures, her own unique style evolved; for example, her delicate rendering of features such as arms and necks on her Madonnas, and her use of a \\"warm and subtle golden palette\\". She \\"links traditional composition with intensity of feeling and innovative colouring.\\" She died in Ravenna on 23 December 1638, at the age of 86. Assessment Longhi is one of the few female artists mentioned in the second edition (1568) of Italian painter and art historian Giorgio Vasari's epic work Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects. Vasari writes that Longhi \\"draws very well, and she has begun to colour some things with good grace and manner\\". But as Germaine Greer discussed in her The Obstacle Race: The Fortunes of Women Painters and Their Work, such \\"haphazard\\" selections of women artists including Longhi rarely offered \\"serious criticism of their achievement.\\" Greer then offered her own assessment: \\"Barbara's output was considerable, all small pictures, remarkable for their purity of line and soft brilliance of colour\\" and \\"Barbara Longhi brings to her extremely conservative picture-making a simplicity and intensity of feeling quite beyond her mannerist father and her dilettante brother.\\" Madonna and Child, ca. 1580–85 Muzio Manfredi assessed Longhi's talent in a 1575 lecture in Bologna: Despite a measure of fame in her home town of Ravenna, Longhi was not well known elsewhere during her lifetime. Her paintings provide some insight into the Counter-Reformation's influence on regional art. Collections The Museo d'Arte della Città di Ravenna owns seven works by Barbara Longhi, as well as eleven of her father Luca's and three by her brother Francesco. Her work is represented in the collections of the Musée du Louvre (Paris), Pinacoteca di Brera (Milan), Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna, Museo Biblioteca del Grappa, Walters Art Museum (Baltimore, Maryland), and Indianapolis Museum of Art, and also in the Santa Maria Maggiore (Ravenna).

It aims to raise awareness on the way violence against women is occurring on ICT platforms such as the Internet and mobile phones, and to call for people to use ICT in activism to end violence against women. It was initiated by the Association for Progressive Communications, Women's Networking Support Programme, in 2006. Since then, the campaign has been taken up and organised by individuals, collectives and non-governmental organizations in at least 24 countries. In 2013, Bytes for All, Pakistan was awarded the Avon Communication Award under the 'Innovative Campaign Award' category for leading an exemplary national campaign in Pakistan. The award was presented by Salma Hayek at the United Nations Headquarters. Issue The campaign highlights the way that violence against women is taking new forms through the use of ICT. This includes: * Online harassment. For example, when a harasser sends repeated, unwanted, threatening and/or sexualised messages through the use of email or SMS. This can also include posting personal information about the victim and/or digitally altered images of the victim on public forums and websites, often accompanied by messages that solicit sexual or violent responses. * Cyberstalking. For example, the use of social networking platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to track a person's activity and movements, the use of spyware to monitor a person's computer and Internet use, and the use of global satellite positioning devices to track a person's physical movement and location, usually by a domestic violence abuser. * Online violation of privacy and blackmail. For example, actual or threatened posting of private photographs and video clips that are usually sexualised in nature on Internet sites with the aim to humiliate another person, or to make the person comply with the demands of the poster. Research indicates that the majority of technology-enabled forms of violence victims are women. The campaign also recognises that the gender digital divide contributes to unequal power relations that creates enabling contexts for violence against women to occur . To address this disparity, campaigners are encouraged to: * Recall and give recognition to the historical contribution that women have made into the development of ICT, such as the contribution of Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper. * Build the capacity of women and girls in the use of new ICT. * Foster an attitude of experimentation and play with new ICT to overcome technophobia. * Engage in activism and advocacy to improve Internet policy development that takes the gendered dimension of ICT into account.

Critical reception  Christopher Monger of Allmusic gave a review: Based on author Mark Peter Hughes' 2007 novel of the same name, Disney’s Lemonade Mouth follows the exploits of five disgruntled Arizona teens who bond during a stint in detention and end up starting a band—it's kind of like The Breakfast Club with a battle of the bands at the end. With 11 original songs that span teen pop, pop punk, hip hop, and rock, Lemonade Mouth (the band) tackle the usual teen subjects (self-esteem, standing by your friends in the face of adversity, following your dreams, being silly) and successfully blend the dewy-eyed romanticism of the Jonas Brothers and the quasi-rebellious angst of early Avril Lavigne, resulting in a winning, if not entirely original, collection of new High School Musical-inspired homeroom anthems.  Commercial performance  The soundtrack debuted at number 18 on the US Billboard 200. Due to strong sales, the soundtrack moved up thirteen places to reach the top five spot. Then the soundtrack finally peaked at number 4. It has also peaked at number three on the US Top Digital Albums and has topped the US Top Soundtracks and US Kid Albums.

This aspect is primarily found in South India and Orissa, but also occasionally in Rajasthan and Nepal. The Ekapada is primarily represented in three iconographical forms. In the Ekapada-murti (\\"one-footed icon\\") form, he is depicted as one-legged and four-armed. In the Ekapada-Trimurti (\\"one-footed Trinity\\") form, he is depicted with the torsos of the deities Vishnu and Brahma, which together with Shiva form the Hindu Trinity (Trimurti) emanating from his sides, waist upwards and with one leg; however, sometimes, besides the central one leg of Shiva, two smaller legs of Vishnu and Brahma emerge from the sides. While some scriptures also call the latter configuration Ekapada-Trimurti, some refer it to as Tripada-Trimurti (\\"three-footed Trinity\\"). In Orissa, where Ekapada is considered an aspect of Bhairava—the fearsome aspect of Shiva—the iconography of Ekapada-murti becomes more fierce, with motifs of blood sacrifice. This aspect is called Ekapada Bhairava (\\"one-footed Bhairava\\" or \\"the one-footed fierce one\\"). The Ekapada form of Shiva originated from the Vedic deity Aja Ekapada or Ajaikapada, a name that Ekapada Bhairava still inherits. Ekapada represents the Axis Mundi (cosmic pillar of the universe) and portrays Shiva as the Supreme Lord, from whom Vishnu and Brahma originate. Ekapada is often accompanied by ascetic attendants, whose presence emphasizes his connection to severe penance. Iconography Rock carved Ajaikapada sculpture in Odisha State Museum The Agama text Amsumadbhedagama mentions that Ekapada-Trimurti is similar to the Ekanetra and Ekarudra aspects of Shiva and is one of the Vidyeshvara aspects. He wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair) and white silken garments. He has three eyes and a pacific appearance. He holds a trishula (trident) and a tanka (small hammer) in two of his four arms and gestures in varada mudra (the boon-giving gesture) and abhaya mudra (the gesture of reassurance).Rao pp. 398, 402–3 Tripada Timurti. Another Agama text, the Uttara-Karanagama, also describes Ekapada-Trimurti as one of the Vidyeshvaras. He stands erect (the samabhanga posture) on his one leg on a lotus pedestal (padma pitha). He has three eyes and four arms and is clear as crystal in color. His back hands carry a trisula or mriga (deer) and a tanka and his four hands gesture in varada mudra and abhaya mudra. He wears ordinary kundala earrings or pearl ones and the jata-mukuta. From the right and left of his body emerge Brahma and Vishnu respectively. They are shown from the waist up and have one of their legs bent held above the ground. Brahma and Vishnu are both four-armed and hold their front hands folded (in anjali mudra). In his back hands, the four-headed Brahma holds a sruk (a large wooden ladle used to offer ghee in fire-sacrifice) and a kamandalu (water- pot), while Vishnu—who is adorned with a kirita-mukuta (conical crown)—holds a shankha (conch) and chakra. Ekapada is surrounded by a huge halo, encompassing all his three torsos. A third Agama text, the Uttara-Kanikagama, mentions that the figures of Brahma and Vishnu are proportionally smaller, similar to the size prescribed for female deities.Rao pp. 398–9 It also associates the one leg of the divinity with the Linga, Shiva's aniconic symbol. The Linga Purana describes Shiva as \\"the lord who has one foot, four arms, three eyes and a trident ... who is stationed after creating Vishnu from his left side and four-headed Brahma from his right side.\\" In South Indian temples, the icon may be accompanied by yogis or ascetics worshipping it and by the vahanas of the Trinity: Brahma's hamsa (swan/goose), Vishnu's garuda (eagle-man), and Shiva's Nandi bull.Rao pp. 400–1 Sometimes, when the legs of Vishnu and Shiva are seen, the icon is called Tripada-Trimurti (\\"three-legged trinity\\") as opposed to the icon when the legs of Vishnu and Shiva are not shown, when it is called Ekapada-Trimurti (\\"one-legged trinity\\"), although the Uttara-Karanagama refers to the former as Ekapada-Trimurti. When the icon is shown without the torsos of Vishnu and Brahma, it is simply called Ekapada-murti (\\"one-legged icon\\"). Another variation of Ekapada, called Mahesha-Ekapada, appears in an 8th- century relief in Mahabalipuram, where he is one-legged and four-armed but also has three visible heads plus a head assumed at the back and top, making it a five-headed icon, resembling the five-headed form called Mahesha or Sadashiva. In Orissa, the iconography of Ekapada is quite different from that in South India. Though he has his characteristic one leg, matted hair and crescent moon headgear, and ascetic attendants, here Ekapada is never depicted with the torsos of Vishnu and Brahma. He may be four-armed or two-armed and is considered a form of Bhairava, the fearsome aspect of Shiva. He sports a short beard and moustache, an open mouth with fangs, and bulging eyes with a wrathful expression. He is ithyphallic (with an erect phallus) and wears a tiger skin around his waist. He wears various ornaments and a long yagnopavita (sacred thread) across his chest. In later images, Ekapada tends to be more terrifying, with a \`garland of skulls, serpentine ornaments and yagnopavita, and a corpse beneath his foot. Early images depict him with a varada mudra gesture and kamandalu; however, in later ones these are replaced by a damaru and a kapala. His other attributes may be an akshamala (rosary), a trishula, a serpent, a deer. His ascetic attendants may hold a trishula and sometimes he is accompanied by a female attendant and his vahana Nandi.Donaldson pp. 153–9 The Vishwakarma-shilpa mentions Ekapada as one of the Rudras and describes his iconography as having 16 arms and holding in his left arms a khatvanga, an arrow, a chakra, a damaru, a mudgara (a mallet-like weapon), an akshamala, and a trisula (trident), with one hand held in varada mudra, and with his right hands holding a bow, a ghanta (bell), a kapala, a kaumudi (crescent moon), a ghata (pot), a parashu (battle-axe), and shakti (power), with one hand in Tarjani mudra (with raised or threatening forefinger symbolizing wrath).Rao p. 388 However, no representation of a sixteen-armed Ekapada is found. Development and worship Ekapada Bhairava in Chausathi Jogini Temple, Hirapur, Odisha The evolution of Ekapada is unclear; however, most scholars agree that he emerged from the Vedic deity Aja Ekapada or Ajaikapada (a sandhi of Aja and Ekapada). The first mention of Aja Ekapada (\\"the one-footed unborn/unmanifested one\\") is found in the Vedas (e.g. Rig Veda 02.031.06, 06.050.14, etc.), Hinduism's earliest scriptures. Aja Ekapada is closely associated with Ahi Budhnya (\\"serpent of the deep ocean\\"), appearing in juxtaposition with the latter in five Rig Vedic hymns and once without him. According to V. S. Agrawala, Aja Ekapada and Ahi Budhnya appear to be twin aspects of the same deity. According to another interpretation, Aja Ekapada appears to be an aerial deity since he is invoked as the supporter of the sky and the thundering flood. In Yaska's Naighantuka (a thesaurus), Aja Ekapada is mentioned with the deities of the celestial realms. The Atharvaveda describes him as made of two worlds. The Taittiriya Brahmana describes him as rising from the east. The commentator of this text interprets Aja Ekapada as a form of the fire-god Agni, as does the modern scholar V. S. Agrawala. Durga on the Nirukta interprets him to be the sun, and some scholars also consider him a solar deity. Some scholars associate him with storms and interpret Aja Ekapada as a lightning strike coming down on earth in a single streak. In the Hindu epics, Aja Ekapada, spelled Ajaikapada, is described as one of the 11 Rudras and an epithet of Shiva, an identification that still is in vogue and is reflected in most of his representations. In the epic Mahabharata, both Ajaikapada and Ahi Budhnya are described as Rudras. The twin deities are characterized as guardians of the gold, with Kubera, the treasurer of the gods. Some Puranas describe Aja, Ekapada (Ekapat), and Ahirbudhnya as three different Rudras. Ajaikapada is described as a Rudra in the Linga Purana too. In most cases Shiva is the governing deity of the Rudras, including Aja- Ekapada. Ekapada icons are found in most of the important Shiva temples in South India, \\"in some place or the other\\", at least carved on a pillar. The Ekapada-Trimurti, found in South India, demonstrates the sectarian mission of the Shaivas (sect of Shiva) to establish their Lord Shiva as the Supreme God and to illustrate that Vishnu and Brahma evolved from him. A similar Vaishnava (sect of Vishnu) icon depicts Vishnu in the central position and Shiva and Brahma emerging from his body. According to another interpretation, the Ekapada icon is that of Shiva in severe penance. Two ascetic attendants, who bow in reverence, emphasize his ascetic nature. In this view, Ekapada is regarded as symbolizing \\"severe asceticism, the granting of wishes or boons, and absolution.\\"Donaldson pp. 158–9 The Vishwakarma-shilpa describes the worship of Ekapada as giving material joys. The Ekapada appears as a secondary deity (avarana-devata) in the northern side niche of temples in Orissa, often next to the central niche depicting the goddess Mahishasuramardini. In Orissa, these icons are known as Aja-Ekapada or Ajaikapada. The earliest Ekapada icons in Orissa date back to the 8th century CE and are also found at the entrance of a caitya or as a guardian-attendant of the Saptamatrika goddesses, as an aspect of Bhairava.Donaldson p. 153 He remains the most popular aspect of Bhairava in Orissa, and was also worshipped by the Kapalika sect. The Ekapada- murti icons found in the Kalinga-era temples of Andhra Pradesh mirror those in neighbouring Orissa. In Orissa, Ekapada-Bhairava is essentially a Tantric deity. Tantric texts explicitly associate him with the Vedic Aja Ekapada, fire/Agni, sacrifice, the cosmic pillar of the universe, and the Yogini goddesses, who are also linked to the Saptamatrikas. As a guardian of the Saptamatrikas, Ekapada became more terrible in appearance, with motifs of blood-sacrifice and his depictions limited to Tantric goddess temples. As Vaishnavism rose in Orissa, depictions of him became increasingly rare. According to one theory, Ekapada may have inspired the popular Vaishnava icon of Jagannath, a deity depicted without legs but a single stump below the waist. Besides in South India and Orissa, images of Ekapada are also found in Rajasthan and Nepal, though rarely.

Robling was born in Ynyshir in the Rhondda, where he attended the local grammar school. His education was interrupted by the Second World War, and upon being called up was accepted for service in the Royal Navy. However, he was selected by ballot to become a Bevin Boy so instead of going to the Navy he was conscripted to work in the coal mines. After the war, he resumed his education and qualified as a teacher after attending Caerleon College and Loughborough University, although instead of teaching he decided on a different career and became a manager at the Lovell's sweet factory in Newport, Monmouthshire. Robling was an outstanding amateur footballer, and was part of the Great Britain squad for the 1952 Summer Olympic Games in Helsinki. He won 13 caps as an amateur international for Wales, and captained the team on one occasion. He also played for Lovell's Athletic, his company's works team which played at a high level in the amateur Southern League. As his playing career wound down he became involved in sports reporting, and in the 1960s he worked part-time for both BBC Wales Radio as a sports commentator as well as writing reports for The Times, but he was still working as a sales manager in 1969, when he won the BBC competition to find an extra person for the BBC's 1970 World Cup television commentary team. Ten thousand people entered, and Robling's rivals in the final six included Ed Stewart, Ian St John and Gerry Harrison. In the final round of judging Robling tied with St John, a Scottish former international footballer, and the casting vote went to the then England football manager Sir Alf Ramsey who was well known for his love of the Welsh accent.Guardian: \\"The forgotten story of the sports broadcasting revolution (and Idwal Robling)\\" After his victory Robling joined the BBC football Match of the Day team, covering matches in the South and West of England area during a short-lived experiment at covering regional matches, and did indeed go to the 1970 World Cup, commentating on a number of first-round games although none of them were broadcast live in the UK. At the start of the 1970/71 season he replaced Wally Barnes as the regular TV football reporter and commentator on BBC Wales, a role he held for the next sixteen seasons, as well as occasionally covering Boxing and Rugby League In those days of limited football coverage he was used mainly as a reporter by BBC Wales and his commentaries were largely restricted to the occasional Match of the Day opt-out, Welsh Cup game or international friendly, but Cardiff City and Wrexham's exploits in the European Cup Winners Cup in the 1970s saw him commentate on some memorable European games against the likes of Real Madrid, Hajduk Split and Anderlecht. He commentated on many Wales' international matches, including Wales' home defeat in the 1978 World Cup Qualifier against Scotland when a controversial refereeing decision saw the Scots being given a late penalty. In the 1976 European Championship Qualifier he had seen Wales become the first team in 30 years to beat Hungary in the Nep stadium, declaring almost incredulously as John Mahoney scored the second goal, \\"and it's 2-0 to Wales...IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT!\\" (probably his most remembered line of commentary for Welsh fans), and in his final major international he commentated on Mark Hughes' \\"wondergoal\\" in a 3-0 win in the 1986 World Cup Qualifier against Spain. It was probably fitting that he lived to see Swansea City win promotion to the Premier League of English football in the spring of 2011, as they started their previous top-flight campaign with an emphatic 5-1 victory over Leeds United on the opening day of the 1981-82 First Division season, a game covered by Robling and which gave him a rare top-billing on the network Match of the Day. With his 60th birthday approaching Robling retired from commentating at the end of the 1984-85 season but he continued covering football as a reporter with a local news agency. He returned to the BBC in an off-screen role as a producer on the Scrum V and Sport Wales programmes, and was still working there until a few months before his death. Robling died in Newport, aged 84, following a short illness.BBC Sport Wales: BBC commentator Idwal Robling, 84, dies He was married with a son and two daughters.

As a member of the Soviet Union's women's gymnastics team, Saadi shared in the team gold medals at the 1972 and 1976 Olympics. She placed 8th in the all-around at the 1972 Olympics and 7th all-around at the 1976 Olympics. Saadi won the all-around, balance beam and floor exercise at the 1973 USSR national championships. That year, she tried for first on vault at the 1973 World University Games, where she also placed 3rd in the all-around. At the 1974 World Championships, she earned a share of the USSR team gold, placed fourth in the all-around and captured the bronze medal on floor exercise. Following the 1976 Olympics, Saadi accepted a coaching position at the Moscow Dynamo Club, where she was the coach of Soviet gymnast Tatiana Groshkova, who placed third all-around in the 1989 U.S.S.R. gymnastics championships and placed first all-around at the 1990 Trophee Massilia. Saadi relocated to Canada in 1991 to become a coach at the Canadian gym Cambridge Kips, where she trained Canadian Olympians Yvonne Tousek and Crystal Gilmore. In June 2011, Saadi announced plans to open her own club, Dynamo Gymnastics. The new club has begun operations on the premises of Revolution Gymnastics in Waterloo, where several top young gymnasts who left Cambridge Kips with Saadi trained. Dynamo Gymnastics opened in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada in 2011. Saadi opened the new club together with the parents of one of the up-and-coming gymnasts, Victoria Moors, who left Cambridge Kips with Saadi. Along with Victoria Moors was Madeline Gardiner. Both Gardiner and Moors went on to qualify for the Canadian London 2012 Olympic team. Moors competed as part of Team Canada and helped to earn Canada 5th place overall in the team final, the best ranking of any Canadian Women's Artistic Gymnastics team to date at the Olympics. Gardiner was an alternate on the team but did not compete. Moors was also the youngest Canadian Olympian competing at the age of 15. Victoria went on to briefly hold the record for a Canadian Women's Artistic Gymnast at the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antwerp, Belgium, in 2013, placing 10th for Canada. The previous best ranking for a Canadian was 14th. (That 10th-place ranking has since been beaten at the 2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships by Halifax's Ellie Black (Moors' teammate at the London Olympics). Victoria also has two eponymous skills, one a dismount from the uneven bars and the other a laid-out double-twisting double somersault on floor which is the hardest ranking floor skill to date. Victoria retired at the age of 18 in the spring of 2015.. Victoria's sister Brooklyn Moors, also coached by Saadi, is a member of the Canadian national team and represented Canada at the 2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships and the 2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. Dynamo with the leadership of Saadi continues to coach elite level athletes and has received numerous awards for their accomplishments.

The character was created by Gossip Girl producer Stephanie Savage and is portrayed by actress Katie Cassidy. The series portrays her as a scheming and secretive but caring woman who develops into a formidable antagonist as her agenda against Serena van der Woodsen progressed. The actions of character has drawn comparisons to another villain of Gossip Girl, Georgina Sparks, and received positive reviews for her inclusion in the series. Juliet only appears during the first half of the fourth season, though she returns in the series finale. Television series =Casting= Prior to the premiere of the fourth season, former Melrose Place star Katie Cassidy joined the cast as Juliet, a student at Columbia University and a potential love interest for Nate, with an agenda against Serena. =Season 4= Juliet has displayed moments of hesitation especially with regards to her relationship with Nate as she develops a soft spot for him when she discovers his being different from most Upper East Siders. When Nate suspects her lying about her residence, he recruits Vanessa and discovers that Juliet is poor and has set up a facade of being a wealthy Upper East Sider, living in a rather small apartment outside of the Upper East Side. =Season 6= On October 12, 2012, it was reported that Cassidy would reprise her role as Juliet in the Gossip Girl series finale. Her brief cameo featured her, once suspected of being Gossip Girl herself, reacting with astonishment to the revelation of Gossip Girl's true identity.

Club Erik Adams praised the casting of Cassidy and the character of Juliet having \\"the most intriguing hand to reveal in coming episodes. Introduced as the cultured, compassionate antidote to the bimbos performing a commercial for Rock Band 3 [...] the character leaves 'Belles du Jour' by flashing a cork-board diagram of the main cast's social circle that would leave The Wires Lester Freamon thoughtfully nodding his head.\\" Steve Marsi of TV Fanatic commended her addition to the cast, stating, \\"There's chemistry between them, but is it all part of some devious plan to ruin Nate ... or Serena? The final shot of Juliet's bulletin board was awesome. We thought for a split second that she just might be Gossip Girl herself. While that might be a stretch, Juliet is clearly plotting something elaborate and we're hooked on her.\\" An interview with the New York Post dispelled rumors when Cassidy jokingly stated that she was not portraying Gossip Girl but understood how the episode had been set up to make fans assume. Judy Berman of the Los Angeles Times labeled her as \\"the season's most mysterious schemer\\" and commended how \\"her true goal remains the biggest mystery of the season so far.\\" With the airing of the mid-season finale, \\"The Townie\\", Berman declared her role in Serena's storyline as \\"the best of the season\\". Following the airing of the Thanksgiving episode, \\"Gaslit\\", Steve Marsi of TV Fanatic named her \\"one of the best villains in Gossip Girl history\\".

Legislative Accomplishments Roberts sponsored legislation to create a “supplemental insurance program — commonly called a Katie Beckett waiver — to assist families of children with medically complex needs, regardless of their income.” Started by President Ronald Reagan, Tennessee was the last state to adopt a Katie Beckett waiver. Roberts sponsored the Fresh Start Act to “ensure that licensing authorities do not deny applications for professional licenses due to prior criminal convictions unless they are directly related to the profession, with the exception of certain felonies.” 2011 Campaign Roberts won the Senate District 18 Republican Primary on January 20, 2011. Roberts won the Senate District 18 General Election on March 8, 2011. 2014 Campaign Roberts announced his campaign for re-election to the Tennessee Senate on May 15, 2013. On September 24, 2013, Representative Joshua Evans of Greenbrier, TN, announced that he was running against Roberts. Other candidates included Tony Gross, Jim Summerville, and Wayne White. Roberts won the August 7, 2014, Republican primary with 42.16 percent of the vote in a highly-contest primary. Representative Joshua Evans (Greenbrier) came in second with 37.82 percent, followed by incumbent Senator Jim Summerville (Dickson) at 15.87 percent, and businessman Wayne White (Dickson) at 4.15 percent. In the November 4, 2014, general election, Roberts defeated Democratic Party nominee Tony Gross with 70.43 percent of the vote, compared to Gross' 29.57 percent.  2018 Campaign  In 2018, Roberts ran for re-election to the Tennessee Senate. He was unopposed in the August 2, 2018, Republican primary. On November 6, he won re- election with 11,392 votes. He defeated Democrat Wade Munday who only had 4,757 votes.  Controversies  =Higher Education= In September 2019 on his weekly talk radio show, The Kerry Roberts Show, Roberts made national news when he claimed that higher education should be abolished to limit the \\"liberal breeding ground.\\" The Tennessee Star Report on Nashville's Talk Radio 98.3 and 1510 WLAC welcomed Roberts to discuss his “hyperbole which was misunderstood by the liberal mainstream media” and incorrectly reported as a policy statement. Roberts’ website posted “His voting record demonstrates consistent support of higher education including the vote to make Tennessee one of the first states in the nation to provide two years of free college or technical education to high school graduates.” =Protestors= In August 2020 during a special legislative session, Roberts was surrounded by protestors in Nashville.

He held positions of power on behalf of King Richard II of England, including two periods as the Sheriff of Anglesey in the 1370s and 80s. Rhys accompanied the king on a military expedition to Ireland in 1398, but in 1400 began to support the revolt of his cousin Owain Glyndŵr against King Henry IV of England. In 1401, he and his brother Gwilym ap Tudur took Conway Castle after infiltrating it, and liaised with Henry Percy prior to his own rebellion in 1403. After being outlawed by the king in 1406, Rhys was captured and executed at Chester in 1412, although later oral tradition claims he returned to Anglesey to die there. Ancestry and early life Rhys was one of five sons of Tudur ap Goronwy and Marged ferch Tomos; alongside Ednyfed ap Tudor, Maredudd ap Tudur, Goronwy ap Tudor and Gwilym ap Tudur. Tudur had served with the forces of King Edward III of England during the campaigns in France in 1337, assuming the rank of knight in the process. Afterwards, he became a royal officer for the island of Anglesey and ensured that all of his sons found similar roles. The family were descended from Ednyfed Fychan, and his son Goronwy ab Ednyfed, the founder of the Tudor family of Penmynydd. Service to the crown Rhys and his brother Goronwy were rhaglaws (bailiffs) for the commote of Dindaethwy across three decades; from the 1370s through to the 1390s. He was made Sheriff of Anglesey twice, first between 1374–75 and again in 1381-84. This was a post more typically held by an Englishman at the time. In 1386, Rhys was one of the leaders of a contingent of soldiers raised in Caernarfonshire to protect against a potential invasion by the French. King Richard II of England paid Rhys £10 a year to retain his service should the crown require it, and accompanied him on a military expedition to Ireland in 1398. However, that same year Rhys was summoned before the king's justicar of North Wales to explain why he had managed to become indebted to the sum of £60 in his role of rhaglaw at Dindaethwy. Rhys held lands in Anglesey and Caernarfonshire which he inherited from his father, and these would have provided a steady income. Revolt In September 1399, King Richard II was overthrown by Henry IV. When Rhys' cousin Owain Glyndŵr began a rebellion the following year, he and his brothers publicly backed him. While Owain's rebellion in North East Wales faltered, Rhys and his family rose up against the king on Anglesey. Henry IV personally took an army to put down the revolt, and harried the island, burning the Franciscan Llanfaes Friary near Bangor, Gwynedd, where the Tudur family were buried. Rhys led troops to ambush them from an advantageous spot on Rhos Fawr. When he engaged Henry's troops, the English fled to the safety of Beaumaris Castle. When Henry issued a general pardon for those of North Wales in March 1401, he purposely excluded Rhys, his brother Gwilym and Owain Glyndŵr. As a result, Rhys and Gwilym hatched an audacious plan. On Good Friday, 1 April 1401, the brothers and 44 men infiltrated Conway Castle. They pretended to be carpenters, and entered the castle while the guard were in church, capturing it. Negotiations began for the return of the castle on 13 April, with the king represented by Henry \\"Hotspur\\" Percy. After seeking a compromise, which would have resulted in pardons being given to the Welshmen, the king overrode Percy's decision on 20 April. An agreement was finally reached on 24 June after several failed attempts when Gwilym began writing to the king directly. Percy subsequently liaised with Rhys in preparation for his own rebellion against the king on 1403, which started and ended with the Battle of Shrewsbury where Percy was killed by the king's forces. All three Tudur brothers were outlawed by the king in 1406. The constable of Welshpool Council arrested several rebel leaders, including Rhys and transported him to Chester. Documents from the era show that Rhys was executed there in 1412. Legacy After the execution of Rhys, his brother Gwilym was given a full pardon a year later. Both their lands had been forfeited when they joined with Owain's rebellion and passed to Gwilym ap Gruffydd, who had married Morfudd, the daughter of Goronwy ap Tudur. Rhys' death was later lamented in a poem by Gruffydd Gryg. =Lineage= Notes References Category:1412 deaths Category:Welsh rebels Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Executed Welsh people Category:15th- century executions by England Category:High Sheriffs of Anglesey ","title":"Rhys ap Tudur"},{"id":"32057400","text":"Andrew Furco (born April 17, 1961) is an American scholar, researcher, and educator in the field of experiential education, whose work has focused primarily on advancing research in service learning.

It is of uncertain placement within the order Ericales, and was described in 2001. Biostratigraphy The specimens of Paradinandra had been naturally fusanised (turned into charcoal), and were recovered by sieving sand and clay. The deposits are thought to be of Late Santonian to Early Campanian age, and are located in a former kaolin quarry owned by Höganäs AB near Näsum, Skåne, Sweden (). The specimens were described by Jürg Schöneberger and Else Marie Friis in 2001 in the American Journal of Botany, and have been deposited at the Swedish Museum of Natural History. Description The flowers of P. suecica are less than long, which is typical for fossil flowers from the Cretaceous. The flowers are organised into whorls of five parts. The sepals are free, lanceolate, and have as obtuse tip. They bear trichomes along the median vein, and become much thinner away from the thickened centre. The petals are thought to be fused together, at least at their bases; they are shaped like a bishop's mitre. Each flower has 15 stamens, which may also be united at the base, and taper towards the attachment of the anther. The filaments of the outer whorl of five stamens are long, while those of the inner whorl are around either or long. This results in the anthers falling into three distinct layers in the bud. It is not known whether the difference is retained on flowering. Pollen grains found associated with the flowers are long, and appear to be tricolpate, which is a characteristic of the eudicots. The gynoecium bears three styles, and the ovules are curved. Affinities In their original description, Schöneberger and Friis noted that the flowers had few features which would allow them to determine the relationships of Paradinandra to other plants. The stamen arrangement seen in Paradinandra and the curved ovules are both seen in various families within the Ericales (sensu lato), and some families, such as Ternstroemiaceae, show both. This suggests that closest relatives of Paradinandra are found among the order Ericales, but the authors could not assign the fossil to any single family, and therefore assigned it incertae sedis (of uncertain placement) within the order.

They are attractive for environmental reasons due to their ease of reuse, their capability of being stacked when full of produce in many different configurations and that they can be flattened when empty for compact return to producers/shippers/growers or for storage purposes. They are highly popular among supermarket retailers when storing packets of fish, meat, or loose fruit and vegetables Controversy Their adoption has generated controversy between developed countries which are consumers of produce and developing countries which are producers, primarily due to the cost of using the trays as opposed to using locally produced containers. In particular, many developing countries lack the capital-intensive infrastructure to develop and support the hi-technology plastic molding machinery necessary to produce the returnable trays. Analysis continues to compare the relative benefits of reusable trays, which require a full cycle (use, cleaning and return) versus one-time-use disposable containers which do not require return to the shipper, but instead are disposed of after one use.

(1925) RAILWAY ACCIDENTS Legislation & Statistics 1825 to 1924. The Raynar Wilson Company, London. The line was operated by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway company at the time. There were nine people killed in the accident and more than fifty people were injured. The cause of the accident was a combination of human error, a defective and inadequate signalling system and an inadequate track layout which could not cope with complex train movements. The Liverpool to Preston line is carried over the Southport to Wigan Line by embankments and a bridge shortly after leaving Burscough Junction Station heading towards Preston, the lines crossing almost at 90 degrees. Two spur lines had been built to connect the Liverpool to Preston railway line to the Wigan to railway line, these spur lines being known as the Burscough Curves. This meant that complicated train movements were being made between the two railway lines, e.g. as both lines were double tracked trains from Southport to Ormskirk, which used the more southerly of the spurs, had first to cross the Wigan to Southport track and then on leaving the spur cross the northbound line from Liverpool to Preston in order to reach the southbound Preston to Liverpool track leading to Ormskirk. At approximately 6:05 pm the southbound train left the station heading for having been turned onto the downline by the signalman on duty at . 200 yards south of the station, adjacent to the Brickfield (Platts Lane) siding, the train collided with the Liverpool to Preston train which had left Liverpool at 5:30 pm. The northbound train was eventually due to carry on to to disembark passengers for the Belfast steamer ferry.Sydney Morning Herald 17 March 1880 The first two carriages of both trains were completely shattered and the passengers thrown about in all directions. Those who could, scrambled out of the wreckage to be met by railway officials who had heard the collision and were making their way toward the site of the crash. A number of medical gentlemen arrived by special train and rendered very valuable services. The injured were taken to Preston Infirmary by special train at 10:00pm. The pointsman, Anthony Melia, from Burscough Junction station was taken into custody and appeared at the subsequent inquiry.Auckland Star 11 March 1880 Anthony Melia was found not guilty, by the inquiry, of criminal negligenceThe Standard (London, England), Friday, 13 February 1880 Dr Hall of Preston, who was a passenger on one of the trains rendered valuable assistance at the scene of the accidentAberdeen Weekly Journal. 16 January 1880 Aftermath As a result of the accident the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway promised to carry out improvements to the station to prevent a similar disaster occurring. Over the next two years new signal boxes were installed and the entire points system reviewed to allow shunting and local train movements to be independent of main line train operations.

History  In 1996 the Australian Government established the Financial System Inquiry following a period of financial deregulation that started in the early 1980s. In 1997, leading business figure Stan Wallis produced a report of his inquiry into Australia's financial system, entitled the Final Report of the Financial System Inquiry and commonly referred to as \\"the Wallis report.\\" Wallis recommended that the best structure for Australia at that time would involve two regulators: one responsible for prudential regulation of any entity that needed to be prudentially regulated; and one responsible for market and disclosure regulation of any financial products being offered to Australian consumers.  Regulators  Financial regulation in Australia is split mainly between the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA). The Australian Securities Exchange has also played a role in regulating market conduct. ASIC has responsibility for market integrity and consumer protection and the regulation of investment banks and finance companies. However, in practice it manifests this function in the oversight of External Dispute Resolution schemes (EDRs).ASIC Regulatory Guide 139Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 912A There is now one ASIC approved EDR scheme operating in Australia, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) was formed to take over from the two previous schemes. Previously there were two ASIC approved EDRs currently operating in Australia. The most prominent is the Financial Ombudsman Service (Australia) (FOS) which receives over 30,000 complaints per year. The second is the Credit and Investment Ombudsman (CIO), which received 4,760 complaints in the 2015/16 financial year. Both the FOS and CIO are not for profit, non governmental organisations funded by members including banks, financial advisers and other financial service providers. Thus, Banking regulators have a significant private and self-regulatory element. The Australian Bankers' Association Inc. is responsible for drafting of the Code of Banking Practice. In 2016 ASIC admitted to the Joint Committee on Financial Services and Corporations that ASIC does not have the power to oversee FOS on a day-to-day basis.Hansard, Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services 16 March 2016. APRA is responsible for the licensing and prudential supervision of Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs), life and general insurance companies and superannuation funds. All financial institutions regulated by APRA are required to report on a periodic basis to APRA. APRA has issued capital adequacy guidelines for banks which are consistent with the Basel II guidelines. Investment banks (which do not otherwise operate as ADIs) are neither licensed nor regulated under the Banking Act and are not subject to the prudential supervision of APRA. However, most investment banks are required under the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001 to provide statistical information to APRA. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) retains its central banking functions including responsibility for most payment systems and setting of monetary policy. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) regulates anti-competitive behaviour. However, it has an agreement with ASIC that ASIC oversees the majority of bank and financial service product and services providers. All of these regulators are independent statutory authorities without direct oversight by a government department. Both the RBA and APRA are managed by boards comprising ex officio and independent non-executive directors or governors appointed by the Treasurer, while ASIC and the ACCC are governed by executive commissioners who also have day-to-day responsibility for its operations. The directors and commissioners have security of tenure, and senior personnel face regular scrutiny by parliamentary committees and are bound by statute to act properly. Nonetheless, there is little direct supervision of the regulators' activities. Senior representatives of the RBA, APRA, ASIC and the Department of the Treasury comprise the Council of Financial Regulators.  Australian financial services licence  The Corporations Act 2001 sets up a uniform approach to the regulation of financial services through a uniform licensing and disclosure regime. The general regulatory position is that a person (whether an individual or corporate entity) carrying on a financial services business in Australia must, unless exempted, hold an Australian financial services licence (AFSL) issued by ASIC. A financial services business, for which an Australian financial service licence is required, includes: * dealing in a financial product * the provision of advice * making a market for a financial product * operating a registered managed investment scheme, or * providing a custodial or depository service in respect of financial products. Central to the regulation is the concept of a \\"financial product\\". Under Australian law, the term is defined very broadly to cover facilities through which a person making a financial investment, manages financial risk or makes non-cash payments. There are also a number of financial products that are currently not regulated as \\"financial products\\" such as many credit facilities. The licensing provisions in the Corporations Act 2001 are expressed to have extraterritorial effect, so as to capture regulated financial services activities conducted outside Australia, which are intended to or likely to have the effect of including persons in Australia to use those services. The Corporations Act draws a clear distinction between the provision of products and services to retail clients and wholesale clients. There are extensive disclosure requirements when financial services are provided to retail clients.  Financial markets  The operation of financial markets (such as exchanges, liquidity pools, crossing systems and other trading platforms) and clearing and settlement facilities in Australia (including clearing houses and other central clearing counterparties), or targeted at Australian users, is subject to a separate licensing regime through the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  Exchange control  Most foreign exchange transactions are free from regulation. The RBA has delegated its control to authorised money market dealers and foreign exchange dealers.  Foreign investment  Foreign investment in the Australian banking sector is subject to review by the Foreign Investment Review Board, and needs to be consistent with the Banking Act, the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998 and banking policy, including prudential requirements. Any proposed foreign takeover or acquisition of an Australian bank will be considered by FIRB on a case-by-case basis and judged on its merits.  Anti-money laundering  Financial service providers (and others) are required by the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Terrorism Financing Act 2006http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/alacfa2006522/index.html#s5 to identify and monitor customers using a risk-based approach, develop and maintain a compliance program, report suspicious matters and certain cash transactions and file annual compliance reports.

Its exhibits include personal objects left over from former lovers, accompanied by brief descriptions. The \\"museum\\" began as a traveling collection of donated items. Since then, it has found a permanent location in Zagreb. It received the Kenneth Hudson Award for Europe's most innovative museum in 2011. In 2017, the museum saw more than 100,000 visitors, making it the 11th most visited museum in Croatia. History The museum was founded by two Zagreb-based artists, Olinka Vištica, a film producer, and Dražen Grubišić, a sculptor. After their four- year love relationship came to an end in 2003, the two joked about setting up a museum to house the left-over personal items. Three years later, Grubišić contacted Vištica with this idea, this time in earnest. They started asking their friends to donate objects left behind from their break-ups, and the collection was born. It was shown to the public for the first time in 2006, in Glyptotheque Zagreb, as a part of the 41st Zagreb Salon. The Museum of Broken Relationships, hosted by the Kunsthaus Tacheles, was a hit with Berlin museumgoers in 2007. In the years that followed, the collection went on a world tour, visiting Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Macedonia, the Philippines, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Between 2006 and 2010, the collection was seen by more than 200,000 visitors. Along the way, it gathered new items donated by members of the public; more than 30 objects were donated by Berliners alone during the exhibition in that city in 2007. In the meantime, after unsuccessful attempts to interest the Croatian Ministry of Culture in finding a temporary location for the museum, Vištica and Grubišić decided to make a private investment and rent a space in Zagreb's Upper Town, making it the city's first privately owned museum. The museum, finally opened in October 2010, proved popular with foreign tourists in particular, not only due to its original subject matter, but also the fact that it is open seven days a week, unlike other museums in the city. This exhibit, labeled \\"ex-axe\\", was donated by a woman from Berlin. She used it to chop her former lover's furniture in frustration after being left for another woman: \\"two weeks after she left, she came back for the furniture. It was neatly arranged into small heaps and fragments of wood. She took that trash and left my apartment for good. The axe was promoted to a therapy instrument\\". In May 2011, the Museum of Broken Relationships received the Kenneth Hudson Award, given out by the European Museum Forum (EMF). The award goes to \\"a museum, person, project or group of people who have demonstrated the most unusual, daring and, perhaps, controversial achievement that challenges common perceptions of the role of museums in society\\", rating the \\"importance of public quality and innovation as fundamental elements of a successful museum\\". The EMF's judging panel noted: :The Museum of Broken Relationships encourages discussion and reflection not only on the fragility of human relationships but also on the political, social, and cultural circumstances surrounding the stories being told. The museum respects the audience's capacity for understanding wider historical, social issues inherent to different cultures and identities and provides a catharsis for donors on a more personal level. Concept The Museum of Broken Relationships is described by its founders as an \\"art concept which proceeds from the (scientific) assumption that objects (in the broadest sense, i.e., matter as a whole) possess integrated fields—‘holograms’ of memories and emotions—and intends with its layout to create a space of ‘secure memory’ or ‘protected remembrance’ in order to preserve the material and nonmaterial heritage of broken relationships\\". The project is divided into several segments: * Material remains layout includes the objects and documents like photographs, letters, or messages. Items are presented with dates and locations of the relationship, and annotations by their anonymous donors. Due to physical space constraints, older exhibits may be archived and transferred to the virtual part of the museum. * Virtual web museum enables the registered visitors to become donors through uploading their images and documents. Donors can decide whether to open their personal collections for viewing by other users of the museum. * Confessional is the interactive part of the museum in which visitors can store their objects or messages, or record their confessions in a restricted and intimate space. Museum of Broken Relationships in L.A. Since 2016 the Museum of Broken Relationships can be found in two cities; the original one is located at the Upper Town in Zagreb, Croatia, while the newly founded one was located in Los Angeles, USA. During his stay in Zagreb, famous American lawyer John B. Quinn visited the Museum of Broken Relationships, and he liked it so much that he decided to start a cooperation with the founders of the Museum. The Museum of Broken Relationships in Los Angeles opened its doors to the public on June 4, 2016 and was located in the heart of Hollywood, with Alexis Hyde as the Director. The size of the venue is around a thousand square meters, and most of the items included in the museum come from the collection initiated in Los Angeles, while a smaller portion of the items were from the Zagreb collection. The Los Angeles location is closed as of November 2017 while looking for a new location.

The HH Tunnel is a proposed series of tunnels under Øresund between Helsingborg, Sweden and Helsingør, Denmark. The connection is planned for passenger trains, and probably for freight trains and for road traffic. There is still no decision on the construction of the HH-route. Neither the Danish nor Swedish governments have committed to scheduling or financing. Local and regional authorities are involved in the project. The largest proposals for connecting railways include new high-speed railways Jönköping–Helsingborg (Europabanan, 250 km) and Helsingør–Copenhagen (50 km) line. A tunnel for freight trains would also need gentle inclines making the tunnel 15 km long and have deeply located rail stations, or to have separate tunnels for freight and passenger trains. If a freight train tunnel is built then the connecting railway Hässleholm–Helsingborg (75 km) would need to be upgraded to double track and a new freight railway Helsingør–Roskilde (60 km) would need to be built. Various Danish governments over the years have rejected the idea, especially freight trains and more road traffic through North Zealand such as the proposed Ring 5 motorway. As such, the project has never been given any high priority in Denmark. After Sweden had a change of government in the 2014 elections, the new Löfven government stated the HH Tunnel project was \\"one of several\\" they have in mind. In 2018 a new prestudy was started by the two national authorities.Fast förbindelse mellan Helsingör och Helsingborg The directives for this prestudy does not contain any freight train adaptation for the tunnel. This study shall be finished by the end of 2020. Previous prestudy was mainly made by the city of Helsingborg.  Landskrona-Copenhagen alternative  Despite the emphasis on the \\"HH\\" route, it has been suggested that a link between Landskrona (in Sweden) and Nordhavn, in north Copenhagen, using a combination of a low level bridge and a short tunnel, below a central shipping lane in Øresund, would be easier to build. The distance is 20 km. Such a route would also cut up to 15 minutes from a journeys between Copenhagen on one hand and Helsingborg, south-west Sweden and Norway on the other – compared to a passenger tunnel between Helsingborg and Helsingør. From Nordhavn a road connection would be needed to leave the city. Since there is no room prepared on the ground for a direct road connection, either a 10 km long tunnel is needed, or using the existing motorway on a long detour past Kongens Lyngby which probably does not have the needed capacity. A ring track connecting Landskrona (Sweden) => Nordhavn Ydre (Denmark) - Østerport - Nørreport - Copenhagen H - Ørestad - Tårnby - Copenhagen Airport => Hyllie (Sweden) - Triangeln - Malmö C - Lund - Landskrona, with Inter Regional trains clockwise and anti-clockwise three or four times per hour, also shortens the time between Lund, Landskrona and the four adjoining stations (in Copenhagen).Swedish - http://framtidensinfrastruktur.se/foretagspresentation/europasparet-avlastar- oresundsbron/Swedish governments reply to this suggestion, PDF atDanish - Svensk by vil grave tunnel til NordhavnDanish - Svensk by vil grave tunnel til Nordhavn It is also considered that Helsingør Station, Helsingør's existing, landmark terminal, may not be suitable for the increased passenger traffic on a direct Helsingborg-Helsingør route. That is, a pure goods line may be the only possibility, unless a new station is built at Helsingør.

The attack was quickly crushed by the numerically superior and better-equipped loyalist forces, who had taken the city earlier in the Libyan Civil War after defeating rebel forces in a major battle that lasted from February to March 2011. Combat New clashes had restarted by early June, with an anti-Gaddafi uprising within the city. On 11 June, a spokesman for the rebel National Transitional Council said that the opposition fighters were in control of a large area on the western side of the city. Later the same day, Reuters confirmed that the coastal road was shut down and deserted, except for a large number of soldiers, police and armed men in civilian clothes. Residents also confirmed that fighting had begun during the morning between loyalist forces and rebels and described the fighting as \\"heavy\\". According to a rebel spokesman within the city, 30 rebels were killed and 20 wounded in two days of fighting. The rebels managed to take control of the western side of the city, but the loyalists remained in control of the city center and eastern side. Also, there were reports that loyalist forces were receiving reinforcements. Guma el-Gamaty, United Kingdom–based coordinator for the National Transitional Council, claimed that rebel fighters in Zawiya consisted of fighters who had trained in the Nafusa Mountains. Moussa Ibrahim, a Libyan government spokesman, insisted that only 20 to 25 rebel guerrilla fighters had infiltrated the city and were being surrounded, and that they posed no threat to the regime. By the evening of 12 June, a government spokesman announced that the rebels were defeated at Zawiya after hours of fighting. A group of foreign reporters were taken from Tripoli to Zawiya for confirmation of the loyalist victory. The reporters saw secure streets and confirmed that the pro- Gaddafi green flag was flying at the main square, where hours earlier rebels had claimed to have surrounded the loyalists and were attacking them from three sides. The government stated that the opposition forces had been pushed out of the city and surrounded on the edge of Zawiya. This was partially confirmed when a reporter heard several gunshots west of the city center, from which the rebels assaulted, and a rebel in the town stated that fighting was still taking place. The rebels claimed that during the battle, a loyalist commander, the high-ranking el-Khouwildy el-Ahmeidy, was seriously wounded in a NATO air-strike while on his way to Zawiya. On 13 June, contact with the rebel spokesman in the city, who was updating journalists on the situation, had ceased and the highway running through Zawiya toward the Tunisian border was re-opened. Foreign journalists were taken on a tour of the highway, confirming that traffic was no longer being re-routed around Zawiya, as was done at the beginning of the fighting.

Built in 1869 by Henry Guest McPike (1825–1910), it is situated on Alby Street on a site of , one of the highest points in Alton, which was called Mount Lookout. History Restored conservatory in 2017 Construction began in 1869 by the architect Lucas Pfeiffenberger. In that year, McPike's Rulander was considered one of the finest in quality at an exhibition of the Mississippi Valley Grape Growers' Association, while his Diana was best on exhibition. McPike served as mayor of Alton and was a notable local businessman, involved in real estate and box making. He also served as the Librarian of the Alton-Southern Illinois Horticultural Society in the late 1880s. He died in 1910. In 1925, the mansion was purchased by Paul A. Laichinger, who rented rooms out to others and lived there until his death in 1945. While the house was abandoned for years thereafter, there was some interest in demolishing it and converting the land into a shopping center, though this fell through due to zoning issues. In the meantime, the house was ransacked for what was left behind, including its furnishings, wooden banisters and even the toilets, becoming a victim of vandalism and negligence. The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 17, 1980 but was left derelict for many years, before being purchased by Sharyn and George Luedke in an auction in 1994. They had intended to convert it into a hotel, but contrary to earlier assurances at auction, they were unable to secure restoration grant money from any federal, state, or local agencies. Despite this, the Luedkes have overseen a restoration process, funded through donations and tours. In 2017, the Alton Historical Commission presented them with an award in preservation for work done on the front porch and conservatory. =Haunting= According to the owner, the mansion is allegedly haunted by the ghost of a former owner and a former domestic servant.

Barber was of All Souls College, Oxford, graduated doctor of civil law and became a member of the College of Advocates in 1532. He was one of Archbishop Cranmer's chaplains, and official of his court at Canterbury, but his special vocation was to advise the archbishop on civil-law matters. In 1537 he was consulted by Cranmer on behalf of Henry VIII, on a subtle point of law touching the dower of the Duchess of Richmond, widow of the king's illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy; and in 1538 the archbishop, in a letter to Thomas Cromwell, requests that Dr. Barbor, ‘his chaplain’ (who Jenkyns says is probably John Barber), may be one of a royal commission to try and examine whether the blood of St. Thomas of Canterbury was not ‘a feigned thing and made of some red ochre, or of such like matter.’ In the same year Cranmer used his influence with Cromwell to obtain for ‘his chaplain, Doctor Barbar,’ a prebendal stall at Christ Church, Oxford. But he does not appear to have been successful, for Dr. Barbar's name is not mentioned by Wood in his account of Christ Church. In this letter to Cromwell the archbishop speaks of Cromwell's knowledge of the ‘qualities and learning’ of Barber, and he himself calls him ‘an honest and meet man.’ Barber is probably identical, too, with the John Barbour who appeared as proctor for Anne Boleyn on the occasion of her marriage's annulment. In 1541 Cranmer appointed him to visit, as his deputy, for the second time, the college of All Souls, whose ‘compotations, ingurgitations, and enormous commessations’ had excited the archbishop's indignation (Strype, Life of Cranmer, i. 131). He is said by Rose to have assisted in the preparation of the famous ‘King's Book,’ a revised and enlarged edition of the ‘Bishops' Book,’ but his name does not appear upon the list of ‘composers.’ He was probably, however, consulted in the matter, for his signature is appended to ‘a declaration made of the functions and divine institution of priests,’ and to a Latin judgment on the rite of confirmation, both documents framed to suit the demands of the time. Barber made a poor return to Cranmer for all his kindness by joining, in 1543, a plot for his ruin. John Foxe, on the authority of Ralph Morice, Cranmer's secretary, tells us that the archbishop elicited from Barber and the suffragan of Dover a condemnation of a hypothetical case of treachery, and then by producing their letters showed that they were the guilty persons, and magnanimously forgave them. Strype says, however, that Cranmer ‘thought fit no more to trust them, and so discharged them of his service.’ Barber died in 1549, and was buried at Wrotham in Kent, of which living—a ‘peculiar’ in the patronage of the Archbishop of Canterbury—he was probably incumbent. Hasted in his list of the rectors and vicars of Wrotham leaves a blank for the period likely to cover Barber's incumbency.

The game was released in Japan on August 11, 2011, in North America on October 24, 2011 and in Europe on December 2, 2011. It is a successor to the 2009 WiiWare release Pokémon Rumble. The game was re-released as a Nintendo eShop digital download for the PAL region on November 29, 2012 and in North America on December 20, 2012. Gameplay Pokémon Rumble Blast features similar gameplay to its predecessor Pokémon Rumble, in which the player's Pokémon explores various areas while battling enemy Pokémon. A boss Pokémon awaits at the end of each dungeon and the difficulty of each boss increases as the player progresses throughout the game. In this game there are towns in the area and each town has machines where you can buy new moves, release Pokémon when you have too many, and a fountain filled with Glowdrops that heal your Pokémon. In the game, Glowdrops are disappearing and you have to find out who took them and catch them. This game includes Toy Pokémon from the first five generations.A Pikachu switching with an Oshawott. When switching the player is delayed. Pokémon Rumble Blast also comes with the option to play against others wirelessly using StreetPass tagging. This allows the player to see other player's Pokémon and Miis. Plot The play starts in Toy Town where they are introduced to the mechanics of the game and the Battle Royale. After winning the Battle Royale, Toy Town's Glowdrops have found to have been stolen. As the game progresses, the player will meet several Pokémon that will contribute various roles to the story. The player will also venture across various towns, each with a different atmosphere. Eventually, the Glowdrop thief (Who is actually Coballion) is found, but he breaks the players wind-up key, delaying switch time. Later in the story, Coballion is encountered again at the World Axle, where he reveals that he has been stealing the Glowdrops to try and fix the World Axle, which has apparently been overrun with rust as well as the pokémon inside. As the player goes deeper into the World Axle, they realize that an entity named Dark Rust is the source of all the rust. Being protected by a force field, Dark Rust is seemingly invincible until Coballion sacrifices his key to destroy the field. After Coballion deactivates the force field, the player battles Dark Rust, and when it is defeated, the rust is removed from the World Axle and all the pokémon previously affected by it, and all the Glowdrop Fountains in the world are restored to normalcy once again. Reception Pokémon Rumble Blast received mixed reviews, with an aggregate review score of 56 on Metacritic. Audrey Drake of IGN gave the game a 6.5/10, concluding her review, \\"As a whole, Pokémon Rumble Blast certainly has more to offer than its predecessor. With more to do, way more Pokémon to collect and far more areas to explore, the game certainly represents a step forward for the series - just not a big enough one. The unrefined graphics and bare bones presentation, paired with the already skimpy gameplay, make for a package that really should have been a 3DSWare title rather than a full release. If simple fun and the inclusion of Pokémon is all you’re looking for, then Rumble Blast is the game for you.\\" Nintendo Power gave the game's highest review score (and the only \\"positive\\" review by Metacritic standards) of 7.5/10, summarizing that the game \\"is a somewhat shallow experience, but the simple action and short levels make it a good pick-up-and-play portable game.\\" The Official Nintendo Magazine gave the game a 68% saying that the game was a little too thin for a full release.

His father, who was living in 1537, amassed a fortune and lived at Chipping Ongar, Essex. His principal duty consisted in supervising the buildings of the countess at Cambridge. The eldest son, William Morice (fl. 1547), was gentleman-usher, first to Richard Pace, and afterwards to Henry VIII, and towards the end of Henry's reign was in gaol and in peril of his life on a charge of heresy. William was father of the ecclesiastical lawyer James Morice. Ralph Morice was educated at Cambridge; he graduated B.A. in 1523, and commenced M.A. in 1526. He became secretary to Cranmer in 1528 before his elevation to the archbishopric, and continued in the office until after Edward VI's death. In 1532 he went with Hugh Latimer, his brother, and others to see James Bainham in Newgate Prison before his execution. On 18 June 1537 he and his father received a grant of the office of bailiff for some crown lands, and in 1547 he was made registrar to the commissioners appointed to visit the dioceses of Rochester, Canterbury, Chichester, and Winchester. His duties while secretary to the archbishop were heavy. In a memorial, printed in the Appendix to John Strype's Cranmer and addressed to Queen Elizabeth, he speaks of writing much in defence of the ecclesiastical changes; much of his work must have been anonymous. He had the farm of the parsonage of Chartham in Kent—that is to say he put in a curate, keeping the rest of the revenues. The curate, Richard Turner, got into trouble for Protestant preaching in 1544, but Morice managed to clear him. The Turner case was part of the serious plot against Cranmer at this time; Morice worked with Anthony Denny and William Butts at court, and played a significant part in the successful counter-attack that secured Cranmer's position with the king. Under Queen Mary, Morice was in some danger. His house was twice searched, and he lost many of his papers and had to flee. He was imprisoned, but escaped. The end of his life he passed at Bekesbourne in Kent. There he fell into poverty, and stated in one of his petitions to Queen Elizabeth that he had four daughters whom he lacked the means to marry. Three of these, however, Margaret, Mary, and Anne, were married in January and February 1571. Alyce Morice, who was buried 25 February 1562, may have been his wife. The date of his own death is uncertain Works Morice, from his official position, was in possession of information, and helped John Foxe and others in their literary researches, mainly by supplying them with his Anecdotes of Cranmer. This compilation was used by Strype in his Memorials of Cranmer, and was reprinted from the manuscript at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in Narratives of the Reformation (Camden Society). Morice gave other assistance to Foxe, and wrote an account of Latimer's conversion, which is printed in Strype's Memorials and in Latimer's Works. Harleian MS. 6148 consists of copies of letters written by Morice on the archbishop's business. Transcripts by Strype of some of these form Lansdowne MS. 1045.

It is located along the Juruena River, in the north of Mato Grosso state and the south of Amazonas state. It forms part of a corridor of protected areas that is meant to contain agricultural expansion into the Amazon rainforest. Location The park covers , mostly in the Amazon biome. It is the third largest in Brazil. It contains parts of the municipalities of Apuí and Maués in Amazonas, and Cotriguaçu, Nova Bandeirantes and Apiacás in Mato Grosso. It adjoins the Sucunduri State Park in the municipality of Apuí. The Igarapés do Juruena State Park to the west overlaps by almost 53% with the Juruena National Park. About 49% of the park is flat plains, 18% gently undulating, 21% undulating, and 10% strongly undulating. 1% is mountainous. Altitudes range from above sea level. The park holds 39 river sub-basins. The largest is that of the São Tomé River, which occupies 23% of the area and has all its sources in the park. The Sucunduri River basin in the north of the park covers 10% of the total area. The rivers are classed as clear water. They are green or olive-green in the dry seasons, muddy in the rainy season. Navigability is poor for vessels of any size due to rocky outcrops, small or large rapids and waterfalls. History Juruena National Park was created by decree on 5 June 2006 and is administered by the federal Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation. It is one of the parks created under the Amazon Region Protected Areas Programme (ARPA) launched in 2002. In 2014 the federal government was considering a proposal to declare the Juruena National Park an area of public utility in preparation for constructing two hydroelectric dams in the site, the São Simão Alto and Salto Augusto Baixo. The planned dams had a forecast capacity of 4,940 MW. The National Council for Energy Policy (CNPE) had two seats for civil society members, but these had not been filled. WWF-Brasil led a campaign against the energy project, which would flood an area of over . In September 2014 the federal government withdrew its proposal. The dams would have flooded parts of the Juruena National Park, Igarapés do Juruena State Park and the Escondido and Apiaká do Pontal indigenous territories in Mato Grosso, and would have affected part of the Sucunduri State Park in Amazonas and other indigenous territories. Conservation The park is classed as IUCN protected area category II (national park). The basic objective is to preserve natural ecosystems of great ecological relevance and scenic beauty such as the waterfalls of the Juruena River at Salto Augusto and San Simon, and to support scientific research, environmental education and interpretation, recreation in contact with nature and ecological tourism. The park aims to protect the biological diversity and natural landscapes of the lower Juruena - Teles Pires and upper Tapajós region. It ensures a healthy ecosystem in the crucial Southern Amazon region between the Tapajós and Madeira rivers. The park protects many endangered species including the jaguar, giant otter and harpy eagle. The park forms part of an ecological corridor, that includes Xingu Indigenous Park in Mato Grosso and Pará, the Terra do Meio Mosaic in Pará, the Juruena National Park in Amazonas and Mato Grosso, the Apuí Mosaic in Amazonas and then the Campos Amazônicos National Park in Amazonas and Roraima. The corridor is intended to contain agricultural expansion into the central Amazon region and deforestation. The conservation unit is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program.  Environment  Average annual rainfall is . Temperatures range from with an average of . The region is a transition zone between the Amazon biome and the xeromorphic formations of the Cerrado biome. The park has of water and of different types of vegetation. 53.4% is dense or open rainforest, and 36.35% consists of contact areas or enclaves of rainforest with other formations such as wooded or park savannah. The remaining land holds semi-deciduous forest or disturbed vegetation.

History Prodo Mach Corporation, the predecessor to Pacific Bearing, was incorporated December 1962 in Rockford, Illinois, before changing its name to Premac, Inc in 1963. The company purchased precision machine shop assets from Harsco Corporation's Globe Imperial division, which had been in the Rockford area since the 1940s. Premac originally manufactured ball valves; through the 1960s and 70s it expanded into making skid plates and contract machined parts for large midwestern companies, including Caterpillar, John Deere, International Harvester, Kendon Exeter and J. I. Case. Premac was purchased by the Schroeder family in 1981 and was nearing bankruptcy by 1982, mainly due to lack of demand when Caterpillar went on strike and International Harvester left the agricultural market. The owner, Robert Schroeder, incorporated the \\"Pacific Bearing Company\\" in 1983 in an attempt to dissociate the business from the Rust Belt. Pacific Bearing was originally created as the sales company for Premac, but the two officially merged in 1985. During the 1980s, the re-formed company shifted focus from metalworking to bearing manufacturing. Its first bearing product was a line of self-lubricating bearings; the company also manufactured bushings, thrust bearings, and skid plates, and continued to produce custom parts. By the turn of the century, Pacific Bearing had reciprocal trade agreements with manufacturers in Japan and Europe, expanding the range of products it could offer and opening new markets for its own products overseas. The company changed names again in 2008, becoming \\"PBC Linear\\". This name change coincided with the opening of a European office under the name \\"PBC Lineartechnik GmbH\\". In 2009, PBC won Design World's \\"Leadership in Engineering\\" award for work in motion control. Products thumb As Premac, the company manufactured ball valves and contract parts for heavy industry. By the 1980s, it was producing round bushings and saddle bearings for hydraulic pumps. Pacific Bearing's initial product line was the Simplicity bearing, a linear bearing that uses a special Teflon compound to provide lubrication and extend product life. The bearings are designed to be size-interchangeable with standard bearings. PBC went on to offer ISO metric and JIS metric versions of its bearings in addition to the original imperial sizes. PBC developed pillow block, flanged, and die set bearings as well. The company holds multiple patents. By 2019, its products included linear guides, linear actuators, rails, bushings, and several types of bearings.

Their principal role was and still is for the prosperity of the country. In this role, they were responsible for predicting the future of kings; the weather to come (for the purposes of agriculture); any natural disaster or political catastrophe that could befall the country; etc. As such, they were frequently consulted by the Serer kings (Maad a Sinig and Maad Saloum)In the Serer language, Maad and very rarely used Maat (though correct) means \\"king\\" i.e. Maad a Sinig (King of Sine), Maad Saloum (King of Saloum). The Lamanes, – the ancient Serer kings and landed gentry, should not be confused with the post-Guelowar Lamanes who were merely the landed gentry and provincial chiefs answerable to the king. There are two types of Lamanes in Serer chronology : Lamanes pre-Guelowar (the original Lamanes, kings and landowners) and Lamanes during and after the Guelowar period (1350–1969) (mere chiefs and landowners) preferably at the beginning of the rainy season.Sarr, Alioune, Histoire du Sine-Saloum, Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. p31 Before a king launches a war against another kingdom, or to repel an attack from another kingdom, the king consults the great assembly of Saltigues to predict the outcome of the battle, as was the case of Saltigué and Diaraf Wassaly Sene and Saltigué Laba Diene Ngom at the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune (18 July 1867), commonly known as the Battle of Somb, during the reign of Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof.Sarr, Alioune .

They are not government ministers or politicians, but spiritual advisors and elders. They are the Serer hereditary \\"Rain priests\\" – guardians of the Serer religion and customs, a birthright they inherited from their ancient Lamanic ancestors.Sarr, Alioune,, Histoire du Sine-Saloum, Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. p31 In the precolonial period, during the Raan FestivalSee Serer religion for Raan Festival. which takes place in Tukar annually on the second Thursday after the onset of the new moon in April, the kings (during the Guelowar periodIn Serer history and chronology, the Guelowar period starts from 1350 during the reign of Maad a Sinig Maysa Wali Jaxateh Manneh – the first Guelowar king to reign in Serer country i.e. the Kingdom of Sine and ends in 1969 following the deaths of Maad a Sinig Mahecor Joof and Maad Saloum Fode N'Goye Joof, king of Sine and Saloum respectively.) will attend the Raan Festival of Tukar, making their way from the capital (Diakhao). However, the king was extremely careful never to arrive before the LamaneThese should not be confused with pre-Guelowar Lamanes, who were the kings and landowners (the landed gentry among the old the Serer noble classes). and always avoid direct encounters with the Lamane of Tukar. Whilst the Lamane was busy self-meditating, touring Tukar and making offerings to the pangool Jegan Joof, the Chief Saltigue and his associates drink sum-sum alcohol all morning before the Festival. It is reported that drinking sum-sum improves the Saltigue's vision of the future and the supernatural world. Having prepared himself sufficiently, the Saltigue and his close associates leave the house and mount their horses, then start their own tour of some of the sacred places of the country. The Saltigué's tour is programmed to follow the king, but ultimately to cross his path at a location known as 'Nenem\\". In this location, the king, aware that the Saltigue is coming, stops the royal entourage. The king and the royal entourage must wait for the Saltigue and his companions to pass. After these high priests and priestesses have passed, the king then gives the signal to the royal entourage to pass as they proceed to their next destination.

It is the twelfth in the series of eighteen benedictions (Shemoneh Esreh) that constitute the core of prayer service in the statutory daily 'standing prayer' of religious Jews. There has been a general consensus that the eighteen benedictions generally go back to some form in the Second Temple period but the origins of this particular prayer and its earliest wording are disputed in modern scholarship, between those who argue for a very early date, either sometime prior to, or roughly contemporary with the Roman conquest of Jerusalem in 70CE, and those who hold that the formulation crystallized several decades or centuries later. Pinning down its date figures prominently since it is widely taken to indicate the moment when a definitive rupture arose between Judaism and Christianity. In the early premodern form in Europe, the malediction was applied to several kinds of people or groups: Jews who apostasized to Christianity; Christians themselves; the enemies of the Jews, and to the governing authorities of the Christian world. From the 13th century, the terminology used in the prayer and rabbinical explications of their referent, Christians, began to undergo a process of censorship, imposed from outside or regulated internally, once Christian authorities learnt of them through information supplied by Jewish converts and from scholars who began to access the texts in the original language. There is no single, uniform Ashkenazi or Sephardic liturgy, and marked differences may exist between prayer books issued by the rabbinates in, for example, England, Israel, or the United States. In modern times, Jews who regularly attend the synagogue only on the Sabbath rarely hear it, if ever since on the Sabbath and holidays an alternative version lacking reference to minim is used. It is mandated for prayer every day among orthodox Jews, and is recited five times by precentors six days every week. Terminology The expression Birkat haMinim, is composed of birkat meaning 'benediction' and minim a plural of min, a plurivalent umbrella term of opprobrium in rabbinic literature meaning 'kinds, sorts'. The birkat haMinim is not specific: the term itself has been called a classic example of '\\"Them,\\" those who disagree with US, heretics, Others.' These minim are one of several classes in the Tosefta and Yerushalmi, the others being perushim (separatists), poshim (sinners) and zedim (arrogant ones). In context it refers to sectarians and heretics, the generic concept being denoted by minut, and came to bear the latter narrow sense when Rabbinic Judaism became normative. The 'benediction' is a euphemism for what is in effect an imprecation against those who are thought to have separated themselves, doctrinally and in practice, from beliefs and observances that came to inform the core of Judaism. Min is one of several terms – apikoros, kofer, meshummadin and tsadoki- used in the Talmud tractates to refer to varieties of freethinkers, religious dissidents and dissenters, or those who subscribe to the notion of the existence of \\"two worlds\\" (thought generally to be a reference to the Sadducees). In one text of the Babylonian Talmud min was even defined as a pagan who worshipped idols. The term could also be used of gentiles whose practices were similar to those Judaism defined as heretical. Some 24 'kinds' or sects are mentioned classically as falling within this category, a calculation attributed to the Palestinian Amora Yohanan ben haNapah, in a context where it was claimed their existence was the cause of Israel's exile Maimonides attampted to sort out and define precisely the distinctions between these groups but modern scholarship has failed to determine the precise original target groups denoted by this terminology. =Heresy= Heresy is 'a method of converting difference into exclusion', The emergence of a concept of heresy in Judaism coincides roughly with the development in Christianity of the same concept, hairesis () – a word that is often translated as 'sect'. In both instances it assumed a pejorative sense. Minim initially were those within the fold halakhically (legally) -perhaps disputative Jewish insiders like the Pharisees and Sadducees – who disagreed with broader rabbinical opinions on doctrine, though probably most Jews in this period were not at all 'rabbinical'. Whatever happened at Yavne, where tradition assigns the composition of the prayer, many scholars, among them Shaye J. D. Cohen, hold that thereafter, the sectarianism of Jewish communities prior to 70 CE was buried, as minim were threshed out: a growing rabbinical \\"grand coalition\\" would have generated a non-sectarian environment with no organized internal challenges, in contrast to the heated sectarian vexations of early Christianity. The process of defining heresy in both Judaism and Christianity nonetheless, have been argued to be virtually identical in developing along similar lines. Text Birkat haMinim. None of the benedictions, it has been affirmed, has exhibited as many textual variations as this particular one, which survives in two core versions, the other being that of the Bavli. In 1898, Solomon Schechter, with Israel Abrahams, published a 9th-10 century CE version of a Hebrew prayer which had been recovered from the Cairo Geniza, and his subsequent findings would revolutionize the study of Jewish liturgy. The peculiarity of this version was that, together with minim, referring to heretics generally, it specifically added a distinct group, Nazarenes. The Genizah actually conserved 86 manuscripts containing six versions of the Birkat haMinim. The Palestinian recension of the Talmud version reads: > For the apostates (meshumaddim) let there be no hope, > and uproot the kingdom of arrogance (malkhut zadom), speedily and in our > days. > May the Nazarenes (ha-naẓarim/noṣrim/notzrim) and the sectarians (minim) > perish as in a moment. > Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written together > with the righteous. > You are praised, O Lord, who subdues the arrogant. This is embedded in a baraita of the tractate on Blessings (b. Ber. 28bb–29a) written during the Mishnaic period. Early modern printed editions, including the Soncino edition of 1484, have a slightly different version in which the minim are identified as the Sadducees. The addition of Nazarenes to the standard reading suggested that, were the Talmudic accounts of the formulation of the prayer historically grounded, a Jewish consensus that Christians in their fold were heretical had consolidated itself already by the first decades after the destruction of the Second Temple. This did not sit well with the fact that formal bans to expel or suspend dissidents from the community were not yet in place in this period. There were two kinds of ban, niddui and ḥerem, neither of which had been formalized in the first and second centuries: further, no good evidence survives of their use against minim at this time. There are no rabbinic references to ḥerem in the sense of an excommunication or ban prior to the 3rd century CE, while niddui appears to reference to disciplinary action to bring obedience, to bring back someone into the fold of the synagogue. Historical context At precisely what stage this specific addition was introduced however is not known: hypotheses vary, from prior to the establishment of Yavne during the Second Temple period, to some time after its establishment in 73 CE, to Ephraim E. Urbach's claim that it was introduced shortly after the revolt of Bar Kochba (ca.135 C.E.), – an hypothesis linked to the first apparent reference to a curse against Christians in a work by Justin Martyr written within some decades of that war. Others such as Pieter W. van der Horst argue for a date just prior to Jerome's time (347–420 C.E.), since, in his commentary on Amos, he first makes explicit a reference to Jewish cursing of (Jewish-Christian) Nazarenes. The earliest rabbinic reference to the blessing is in a passage at Tosefta Berakhot 3:25 redacted in the mid 3rd century, but reflecting an earlier source, where minim are mentioned in a blessing of the Pharisees (פְּרוּשִׁים), implying the two were identical. The wording has long been a stumbling block, and subject to many attempts at emendation. Saul Lieberman has argued that it is to be taken as denoting 'Separatists' generically, and not the particular group known by that appellation in the New Testament and Josephus. The earliest external sources explicitly alluding to this Birkat haMinim content thus date to the 3-4th centuries. It is firmly attested as ensconced in rabbinical liturgy by the middle of the first millenium. Rabbinical texts are not reliable for accurate dating of events for this period. For one, they conflate strata of commentary from distinct historical periods. The problem has been to determine therefore what precise meaning was attached to minim in three distinct periods: (a) in Tannaic texts (b) in the Amoraic literature of Palestine and (c) the Amoraic works produced in Babylon in the last of which the word for Nazarenes finally emerges. In the earliest stratum, of 22 references to minim, most indicate broadly sectarians, Samaritans and also perhaps Jewish Gnostics. Collectively in both the Tanna and Amora references, minim refer almost always to Jewish heretics. On one hand it is argued that backdating later practices and liturgy to the early post-destruction period suited the vested interest of rabbis in securing their authority by appeal to an earlier foundational moment, such as at Yavne. Gamaliel 11 headed the Yavne Academy from approximately 80CE to 115CE, and Martyn speaks of a consensus that the rewording of the benediction dates to around 85 CE, on the assumption that Samuel the Small must have been very old at the time, dying before 90CE or sometime thereafter in Gamaliel's time. The Mishnah in its final redaction by Judah ha-Nasi (ca.200 CE) records that Gamaliel's rule of the full 18 prayers was contested by three rabbis, who proposed a short or summary prayer in their stead. =Yavne= The Babylonian Talmud states that the minim benediction was instituted in Yavne, and preserves a story at Berākhōt 28b-29a about the origin of the 18 benedictions, and specifically, of how the imprecation against heretics emerged: > Our rabbis taught Simeon ha-Paquli (the Cotton-Dealer) organized the > Eighteen Benedictions in order before Rabban Gamaliel in Yavneh. Rabban > Gamaliel said to the sages:'Isn't there anyone who knows how to fix the > Benediction of the heretics?' Shmuel ha Qatonstood up and fixed it, but the > following year he had forgotten it. And he thought about it for two or three > hours, (and he did not recall it), but they did not remove him. Why then did > they not remove him? Did not R. Judah state that Rav said:'If someone (a > precentor) makes a mistake in any of the (eighteen) benedictions, they don't > remove (discharge) him, but if (he makes a mistake) in the Benediction of > the Heretics, they do remove him, since they suspect that perhaps he is a > heretic'? Response Shmuel ha Qaton is different because he formulated it. According to this standard account of the formulation ('fixing' i.e. tiqqen), the prayer emerged after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70CE, when Yohanan ben Zakkai and his disciples were permitted to settle in Yavne, where they are said to have constituted a Torah academy for halakhic study, a bet din to try capital cases, with the issuing of nine enactments (taqqanoth). The assembly gradually came to see itself as a successor to the Sanhedrin of Jerusalem. The specific grounds for the curse, in this traditional view according to Shaye J. D. Cohen, arose from the atmosphere of crisis induced by the catastrophic events earlier, at Yavne the Pharisees interdicted sectarianism, expelled all those who did not belong to their group, excommunicated Jews of Christian observance, expunged the biblical canon of all works written in Greek and having an apocalyptic tone, in order to establish an exclusivist orthodoxy. The introduction of this form of the curse, in one view, functioned to 'smoke out' the minim. If a reader faltered in reciting the prayer, i.e. to curse oneself would be tantamount to thanking God for bringing about their own destruction, they would fall under suspicion, and risk expulsion from the congregation. References to prayers in the Second Temple period often locate them in private homes, and were not typical of synagogue practices, though daily communal prayer was practiced at Qumran. A general consensus was that the mention of Gamaliel 11 supports a date between 80-120CE, though it is possible to argue that he has been confused with his father Gamaliel the Elder, which would imply an earlier date. The reliability of the account has been questioned, and whether such an academy was established and a decision of this kind made at that time remain controversial. Daniel Boyarin, for one, considers it a myth. The words 'they ordained it at Jamnia (Yavne)', together with the anecdote of the role of Simeon ha Paqoli, appear to clash with the reference to 'the men of the great synagogue' who 'ordained Prayers for Israel' mentioned later in the tractate at Ber.33a, and to the comment that 'one hundred and twenty elders, prophets among them, ordained the Eighteen Benedictions in order' in the Megilla tractate (17b), which implies that the prayers date back to the time of Ezra (480–440 BCE), and therefore must be devoid of anti-Christian resonance. The apparent differences can be harmonized if one assumes, on the basis of Megilla 18a, that the benedictions had been forgotten over the centuries and then recalled and reordered at Yavne. Boyarin on the other hand takes the whole passage as apocryphal: there was, he claims, simply no institutionalized rabbinic authority which would have had hegemonic authority to make a binding decree of such a prayer from West Asia to Rome down through to the end of the 2nd century, as implied. The story in this view is the result of a retroactive ascription in which Gamaliel functions as a 'cypher for so-called anti-sectarian activity'. =Eliezer ben Hyrcanus= There is one instance in the Talmud of min being used specifically of Christians, and it concerns one of the Yavne sages in the early period, excommunicated, like Akabia ben Mahalalel, for failing to accept the will of the rabbinic majority. This locus classicus concerns Talmudic accounts of the fate of Eliezer ben Hyrcanus who was arrested on suspicion of minut and subsequently brought to trial on a heresy charge before a Roman judge. The incident may have occurred in the reign of Trajan (98-117 CE). Two versions exist, one at Tosefta Hullin 2:24, the other in a baraita on Avodah Zarah 16b-17a. The charge was dismissed when the governor mistook Eliezer's remark that he put his trust in the judge (God) as a reference to himself. Only later, as he was overcome by depression at being called a min, did he recall, on being prompted by Rabbi Akiva, an incident that occurred in the area of Sepphoris, not far from Nazareth. He had had a casual encounter with a certain Yaakov of Kfar Sikhnin, calling himself a disciple of Jesus, where he experienced pleasure on hearing an halakhic judgment given in the name of Yeshua ben Pantiri/Yeshu ha-notsri. His transgression in listening to and appreciating these remarks, he reflected, consisted in not being mindful of the words of Proverbs 5:8:'Keep your path far from her and do not draw near to the entrance of her house'. =Sadducee hypothesis= The substitution of Sadducees for minim is generally thought to be a result of early modern censorship, However David Flusser, emphasizing as a key piece of evidence a passage in the third 'gate' or chapter of the very early Seder Olam, thought the reading conserved the earliest form, rooted in the Second Temple period, and that the birkat as we now know it was the synthesizing handiwork of Samuel the Lesser. Flusser's argument against the earliest form being directed at Judeo-Christians considers that that it arose, rather, as a response to the Sadducees, considered at the time hellenizing 'separatists' (perushim or porshim). This required him to posit that the earliest form must have been a 'Curse of Separatists'(Birkat al-Perushim). =Hypotheses of contemporary Christian evidence= Prior to 70 CE there is no sure evidence that deviant groups were cut off from the community. On the basis of 2 Corinthians 11:24 and Acts 23:1 the apostle Paul, even as a Christian, is thought to have accepted the synagogue's authority over him, implying that even during the time of Pharisee persecution, members of the early Church were seen as a sect within the Jewish fold, and that Paul remained a 'deviant' Jew, a 'reprobate' within the community. That rabbinical sources were familiar with Paul is suggested for some scholars by the fact that, in discussing minim, a rabbi disarms his students' questions by apparently citing 1 Corinthians 11:11 in Hebrew. Both the Gospel of Matthew and the Didache appear to date to approximately this period of Gamaliel's ascendency, and parts of them can be read as registering a similar paleo-Jewish Christian opposition to these stipulations. In Matthew, as with Paul, =The Gospel of John and Martyn's hypothesis= The Palestinian version of the curse is often discussed in relation to three passages from the Gospel of John (9:22; 12:42; 16:1), dated around 90-100 CE, which speak of Christians being expelled from the synagogue. The influential thesis of J.L.Martyn, advanced in 1968, proposed a link between the curse and passages in this Gospel which speak of Jewish believers in Christ qua Messiah being excluded from the synagogues, implying an authoritative body within the Jewish community has taken some decision of this kind sometime after an authority to do so was established at Yavne. > For the Jews/Judaeans have already agreed that if anyone should confess him > to be Messiah he would become an excommunicate from the synagogue > (aposunágōgos) This, and other passages, for Martyn, reflected not events in Jesus's time, but in the environment of the Johannine community (c.70-100) and the effect of the Birkat haMinim on them. Most scholars have challenged his construal of the 12th benediction. It is argued that rabbinic jurisdiction at that time would not have extended to Asia Minor or Syria, where John appears to have been composed. A dissenting view is that the Johannine passages reflect directly events in Jesus's own lifetime, c.30 CE., and that the Birkat haMinim is an irrelevancy with regard to those passages. Church Fathers =Justin Martyr= In Patristic literature, the curse is first mentioned by Justin Martyr in his Dialogue with Trypho, whose terminus ante quem is ca.160 CE. This text may reflect a real conversation which might have taken place some time shortly after the outbreak of the Bar Kokhba revolt, or in its immediate aftermath (132-136). Neither the Samaria-born Justin nor the figure depicted as his Jewish interlocutor of gentile education, were familiar with Hebrew, something which strongly undermines the hypothesis that Trypho is to be identified with the bitterly anti-Christian contemporary Yavne rabbi, Tarphon. Justin, after charging that Jews dispatched emissaries to calumniate the Christian sect, that rabbis enjoin their flock to avoid getting into discussions with them, and that they mock Jesus, mentions seven times that Jews curse Christ, and in two of these, cursing is said to take place in synagogues. Another four passages relate to this, but lack the word for 'curse'. > Scoff (ἐπισκώψητέ) not at the King of Israel, as the rulers of your > synagogues teach you to do after your prayers.' The fit with the birkat haMinim, in Reuven Kimelman's view, fails on four grounds: (a) Christians are not mentioned (b) the words appropriate to a curse, such as katarâsthai or katanathēmatízein (anathematize) used elsewhere in the dialogue, are not used. Instead we have episkōptein, which is not cursing but mocking; (c) the ridiculing takes place after prayers (metà tēn proseukhēn), not in the midst of them; and (d) the prayer does not name Christ. Barnard however states that Justin's reference is to the birkat, comparing other Christian testimonies, in Cyprian (200 –258), Lactantius (c.250-325) and Gregory Nyssa (c.335–c.395) that appear to reflect a like knowledge of the curse. =Origen and Tertullian= The prolific theologian Origen (ca.184-234), author of the Hexapla, resident in Caesarea and the most eruditely informed Christian thinker on Jewish matters, has been cited for an against the view that he knew of the curse. The scant evidence in the extant corpus of his huge output consists of three brief comments: (a) a remark in his commentary on the Psalms where he notes that the Jews still anathematize Christ, where the passage is to general to allow any such inference, and may merely echo Justin; and two remarks in his Homilies on Jeremiah, one regarding Jewish cursing of Jesus and plotting against his followers (10.8.2), the other stating:'Enter the synagogue of the Jews and see Jesus flagellated by those with the language of blasphemy' (19.12.31)) These pieces of ostensible evidence likewise fail as testimony, Kimelman argues, because it is Christ, not Christians, who are cursed and no connection is made to prayers. Likewise Tertullian (155-ca.240) shows an awareness that the Jewish epithet for Christians is Nazareni, – which could be taken as an echo of some form of the birkat mentioning noṣrim -and that among them there are those who dismiss him as the son of a prostitute (quaesturariae filius). Yet again, noṣrim is rarely attested in rabbinical sources, and whether it refers to Christians broadly, or a Jewish Christian sect, cannot be ascertained. =Epiphanius and Jerome= A strong consensus exists for the view that both Epiphanius (310/320-403) and Jerome (c.347–420), both resident in Byzantine Palaestrina, were familiar with the curse. Epiphanius, a former Jew who converted to Christianity at 16, in his Panarion 29:4 writes: > Not only do Jewish people bear hatred against them, they even stand up at > dawn, at midday and toward evening, three times a day when they recite their > prayers in the synagogues, and curse and anathematize them-saying three > times a day, \\"God curses the Nazoraeans.\\" It is not disputed that the reference is to the birkat haMinim, since only the Amidah is repeated thrice in the liturgy, and cursing is mentioned. Kimelman, noting that the text does not refer to Christians, but a Jewish-Christian sect, argues that whenever the ha-noṣrim ve-ha-minim phrasing was added (ca.290-377)) it referred to this sect, and not Christians. Ruth Langer likewise argues that Epiphanius does not understand by the term orthodox Christians. His near contemporary Jerome writes: > Until now a heresy is to be found in all parts of the East where Jews have > their synagogues; it is called \\"of the Minaeans\\" and cursed by the Pharisees > up to now. Usually they are named Nazoraeans. They believe in Christ, the > Son of God born of Mary, the virgin, and they say about him that he suffered > and rose again under Pontius Pilate, in whom we also believe, but since they > want to be both Jews and Christians, they are neither Jews nor Christians.' The similarity between the two passages suggested to Alfred Schmidtke that they both drew on an earlier source, Apollinaris of Laodicea, for this information. Medieval times The accusation in patristic literature that Jews at prayer blaspheme against Christ and Christians drops from view in the early medieval period, and only reemerges in the 13th century. Pirqoi ben Baboi does mention a prohibition on the tefillah in Palestine, which some think might reflect censure of this particular prayer in an assumed ordinance laid down by Heraclius, but the one exception is Agobard of Lyons who in 826/7 cites Jerome on synagogue maledictions and states Jews he interviewed confirmed the point. It is thought probable that this attests to the birkat minim text. Agobard's remarks were part of a remonstration with the Carolingian monarch Louis the Pious, whom he thought had granted too many privileges to Jews. His appeal failed to resonate among ecclesiastical authorities. It may reflect peculiarities in the local Lyon liturgy prior to the spread of Babylonian geonic authority to Europe marked by the revision of prayer books according to the model formed in the Seder Rav 'Amram Gaon. By the end of the first millenium rabbinical Judaism had spread and penetrated throughout the diaspora. The widespread massacres of Jews that took place with the advent of the First Crusade (1096), and the profound grief these acts engendered among the survivors of numerous devastated communities, heightened whatever negative traditions they may have had about Christianity, and fed into ensuing Jewish polemics against Christians in the medieval world. For Israel Yuval, vengeance on Gentiles as part of a messianic process came to play a key role in Ashkenazi thought as the cursing of non-Jews crystallised into a unique ritual. From the end of the 12th century onwards, dozens of Jewish polemical manuscripts critical of Christianity were produced. Much of this was not simply defensive, or inframural, but arose from genuine attempts to engage with Christian theologians over issues involving the correct interpretation of biblical texts in Hebrew cited in the Greek Gospels. Nonetheless, from this period onwards, the prayer became the object of 'intense apologetic and polemic preoccupation'. Within the Jewish fold in this period, Maimonides explained the prayer as arising from exceptional circumstances that required a community response to the emergence of numerous minim who turned Jews away from God. He nowhere indicates who these minim were, other than sorting them into five classes and excluded them from the 100 blessings Jews were required to recite each day. Talmudic authorities in Christian lands, such as the Provençal rabbi Avraham ben Yiẓḥak, reflect the view that the original and ongoing object of the curse was Christians. Rashi maintained that the benediction was ordained 'when the disciples of Jesus had multiplied', and occasionally glosses minim as referring to galaḥim ('tonsured ones'), i.e. Christian priests. Passages in his commentaries equating minim with Christians were later excerpted as evidence to warrant the Church's crackdown on the circulation of Jewish religious literature. In the late 1230s, a convert from Judaism, Nicholas Donin brought to the notice of Pope Gregory IX a list of 35 passages in the Talmud (Extractiones de Talmud) that might form the ground for questioning that material. One specific passage refers to the Amidah prayer, described as follows: > Three times every day in a prayer which they consider more important than > others, the Jews curse the clergy of the Church, the kings, and all other > people, including hostile Jews. This prayer is in the Talmud and ought to be > recited standing with feet together, and one should not speak about anything > else nor interrupt it until it is completed even if a serpent is wrapped > around one's ankle. This (prayer) men and women recite at least three times > a day, men in Hebrew and women in the vernacular, and in both cases in a > whisper. The result flowing from this information was that the Pope issued apostolic letters in 1239 to many European countries ordering a crackdown and seizure of Jewish books through England, France, Aragon, Navarre, Castile, León and Portugal. Copies of the Talmud were to be seized in synagogues on the first Sabbath of Lent, and consigned to Dominicans and Franciscans. Few followed the ordinance with Louis IX of France alone responding by instituting a Trial of the Talmud the following year, so by 1240 the Birkat haMinim was singled out for condemnation. As a result of conversions, among them that of Pablo Christiani who had disputed publicly with Nachmanides in Barcelona (1263), information about what Jewish texts and prayers, including the Aleinu, stated about or hoped would happen to Christians multiplied, and it is possible that the Birkat haMinim text also influenced moves to insist that what Christians considered as numerous blaspheming passages be removed. One indirect consequence of these discoveries was that calls grew for the creation of chairs in various semitic languages, formalized in 1311, at the Council of Vienne. A papal Bull, Dudum felicis recordationis, (1320) subsequently ordered the confiscation of all copies of the Talmud. Abner of Burgos, a Jewish physician, even before his public conversion at precisely this time, had already begun to write books in Hebrew for the Jewish community in Spain such as the Sefer Milḥamot haShem (Libro de las batallas de Dios) which were highly critical of prayers like the Birkat haMinim. In 1323/4 this prayer, in a Latin translation, was included with several other items in Bernard Gui's guide for inquisitors, Practica officii inquisitionis heretice gravitatis. Gui added a gloss explaining that though the text does not explicitly mention Christians, the wording used makes it clear that this is what is to be understood by asking God to destroy the minim. Shortly afterwards, in 1331, the Franciscan Hebraist Nicolaus de Lyra (1270 – 1349) in his Postillae perpetuae in universam S. Scripturam, – a work that was to become one of the most authoritative Christian exegeses of the bible – stated that 'from the cradle, they (the Jews) have been nurtured in the hatred of Christ, and they curse Christianity and Christians daily in the synagogues'. Around 1400, Yom-Tov Lipmann-Mühlhausen wrote his Sefer haNizzaḥon (Book of Contention/Victory) which, unlike an anonymous Ashkenazi polemical work of the same title, was a prudent and respectful treatise that came to mark a milestone in Jewish- Christian polemics. The work was a refutation of both Christianity and Karaism and affirmed the superiority of rabbinical Judaism. It was composed in the immediate aftermath of the execution of 80 Jews who had languished a year in jail on a charge brought by a convert, Peter, that Jewish rituals and prayers were derogatory of Christians and asked God that the latter be destroyed. The text of the birkat haMinim, together with that of the Aleinu, figured prominently in the accusations. Lipmann-Mühlhausen brushed off the interpretation given, claiming that minim simply meant zweifelte Ketzer heretics whose doubts left them wavering between Judaism and Christianity, and who, having neither religion deserved death. Modern period The effects of censorship continued into the early modern period. The invention of printing coincides with renewed concerns by Church authorities for the content of all books. In Germany another Jewish convert Johannes Pfefferkorn, author of an explicit attack on the Birkat haMinim, called in 1509/1510 for the burning of all Jewish texts save the Tanakh, a position that blew up into a decade-long polemic with the Hebraist Johannes Reuchlin, in which theologians supported Pfefferkorn while Christian humanists sided with Reuchlin. With the advent of the Reformation and its endeavours to restore a pristine version of Christianity, Lutheran scholars in particular came to dominate the field, for Hebrew texts provided extensive witness to the ancient world out of which Christianity emerged and thus served to challenge the distortions of Roman Catholicism. In 1530, a convert to Catholicism from a distinguished Jewish family, Anthonius Margaritha, published a work entitled Der gantz Jüdisch glaub (The Entire Jewish Faith) which translated numerous Jewish prayers, among them the Birkat haMinim, and mentions the daily cursing of Christ. This was to have an important influence on Martin Luther, who quoted extensively from it in his vehemently anti-Judaic excoriation On the Jews and Their Lies (Von den Jüden und iren Lügen) of 1543. Pope Clement VIII's promulgation in 1596 of the Index of Prohibited Books, one of which was the Talmud, rules were set out for how Hebrew texts published within the ambit of the Catholic world were to be edited with regard to passages deemed hostile to Christians or blasphemous of their faith. Guided by the sefer ha-ziqquq (Book of Expurgation) compiled by the apostate rabbi Domenico Gerosolimitano Jewish scholars were required to blot out the word minim, and expunge or substitute words in prayers and commentaries on the Tanakh which Jewish tradition associated with Christians, such as goyim, nokhri, or nokhrit which were understood as vilifying Gentiles. By the 17th century, the Cistercian Hebraist Giulio Bartolocci anticipated the modern view of the primitive text, arguing that the benediction, while targeting Christians, was mainly directed at others, whom both Jews and paleo-Christians would consider heretics, such as Theudas at Acts 5: 36. As mastery of Hebrew progressed, many Christian polemical works against rabbinical Judaism began to emerge. Martí's manuscript had long been lost from view until it was finally printed in 1651, and reprinted in Leipzig in 1678. Shortly afterwards. Johann Christoph Wagenseil's Tela ignea Sanatae ('The Flaming Arrows of Satan', 1681) deployed extensive quotes from Jewish writings in an attempt to skewer Judaism on a charge of enmity against Christianity. This was partly motivated by the requirement of German Protestants in a confessional state to defend their religion.. This vein culminated with the publication of Johannes Eisenmenger's 2 volume Endecktes Judentum, (Judaism Unmasked, 1700) which has an extensive discussion of the 12th benediction. Eisenmenger's work was soon to achieve notoriety as it became the standard source for antisemites opposed to the cause of Jewish emancipation in the 19th century. Post-war The culmination of a millennial history of Christian anti-Semitism in the Holocaust led, in the post-war years, to a re-examination of the anti-Judaic elements at the core of Christian tradition. In 1965, the Second Vatican Council published the encyclical Nostra aetate which disavowed the accusation of deicide, determined that anti-Semitism was incompatible with Christianity and accepted the eternity of God's covenant with the Hebrews in a general affirmation that which recognized all non-Catholic religions contain divine truths. In the Pentateuch, a primary model for reconciliation is that between Jacob and Esau at Genesis 33:3-4, where the latter kisses (nishek) his brother. Rabbinical tradition, unable to alter the sacred text, adds a dotted superscript over the verb, indicating the given reading was to be cancelled, and glossed it with a pun, suggesting that what was actually meant was that Esau had bitten (nashakh) his brother Jacob, who became the patriarch of the forefathers of the Jews, the Israelites. Esau thereafter became a metonym successively for Rome and Christianity. In the prewar writings of Abraham Isaac Kook, the Ashkenazi chief rabbi in Mandatory Palestine and founder of the highly influential Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, Christianity is usually described as minut (heresy). In modern Israel, these Christian overtures, according to Karma Ben Johanan, have met with a chilly reception characterized by increasing hostility among the Orthodox rabbinate, which considers Christianity to be halakhically idolatrous. Tradition excluded the possibility that reconciliation with Rome was on the table. The censorship of contested terms due to Christian pressure has led to moves to restore the original wording. Israel Yuval, reviewing Ben Johanan's book, recalls that even the otherwise liberal Orthodox intellectual Yeshayahu Leibowitz railed, at the time of the Eichman trial, at attempts to justify 'the vermin [sheretz] of Christianity' and reminded his interlocutor, David Flusser, that \\"We curse Christianity three times every day.\\" See also * Pharisees * Split of early Christianity and Judaism * heresy in Judaism * Origins of Rabbinic Judaism * Origins of Christianity * Christianity in the 1st century * History of early Christianity * History of Antisemitism Notes =Citations= Sources                        Category:Early Christianity and Judaism Category:Heresy in Judaism ","title":"Birkat haMinim"},{"id":"32058175","text":"Michael Trubshawe (7 December 1905 - 21 March 1985) was a British actor and former officer in the Highland Light Infantry Regiment of the British Army.

Perkins was a right-handed batsman who bowled both slow left-arm orthodox and left-arm medium pace. He was born in Wollaston, Northamptonshire. On 4 June 2011 he became the 13th former first-class player to reach 100 years of age, and the fourth county cricketer to do so. Following the death of Syd Ward in January 2010, Perkins held the distinction of being the oldest living first-class cricketer. Career Perkins made his first-class debut for Northamptonshire County Cricket Club against Middlesex in the County Championship. He played for Northamptonshire from 1934 to 1937, a period notable in Northamptonshire's history for their astonishing winless run: the county failed to register a win in 99 first-class matches between 1935 and 1939. Perkins' made 56 first-class appearances for Northamptonshire, without ever being on the winning side. Perkins performed well with the ball during his first-class career with the county, taking 93 wickets at an average of 35.58, claiming a five wicket haul on 5 occasions, and taking best figures of 6/54. His best figures came against Worcestershire in 1935, a season which was by far and away his best season with the ball, with Perkins taking 63 wickets at 26.46 a piece. As a tailender, Perkins scored 560 runs with the bat, coming at a batting average of 7.88, with a high score of 29. A handy fielder, he took 30 catches in the field. Perkins left Northamptonshire at the end of the end of the 1937 season, having played his final match against Lancashire at Old Trafford. Moving to Ipswich, he joined minor county Suffolk in 1939, making his debut for the county in the Minor Counties Championship against Lincolnshire. He played throughout 1939, before the Second World War ended county cricket until 1946. During the war, he served with the Royal Artillery, spending time at the end of the war in Cairo, Egypt. Perkins returned to playing minor counties cricket for Suffolk following the war, which he had to balance with his work commitments as cricket coach at Ipswich School. In 1951 he made his final first-class appearance, which came for the Minor Counties cricket team against Kent. In his final first-class match, he scored 8 runs in the Minor Counties first-innings and an unbeaten 21 in their second-innings. However, he went wicket-less with the ball and Kent won by an innings. This meant he went winless in his 57 first-class appearances, a record for the number of first-class appearances without featuring in a win. Perkins continued to play for Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship until 1967, having by then made 105 appearances for the county. By the time of his retirement at the age of 56, he had claimed a record 779 wickets for the county, some way ahead of Colin Rutterford's 431. Such was Perkins' accuracy as a bowler, The Daily Telegraph reporter Simon Parry-Crooke described watching him bowl as: \\"he had this incredible control: he could just drop the ball on a handkerchief.\\" Indeed, he once took 10 wickets in an innings, when playing against Hertfordshire in 1960. He still had the match ball when he celebrated his 100th birthday.

Birth and education Abdu-Lateef Oladimeji Adegbite was born on 20 March 1933 into a strictly Moslem Egba family in Abeokuta, Ogun State. According to one account, he attended Methodist School, Abeokuta. He says himself that he attended Arabic School, then entered St. Paul's Primary School in Igbore, Abeokuta in 1942, when he was aged nine. Adegbite obtained a scholarship to attend King's College, Lagos, where he was co-founder and first National president of the Muslim Students Society of Nigeria, graduating in 1956. In 1959 the Western Region Premier Chief Obafemi Awolowo awarded him a scholarship to travel to England to study for a Law degree under a plan drafted by Chief F.R.A. Williams. Adegbite attended the University of Southampton, graduating with a B.A. in Law in July 1962. He then studied at the College of Law for Solicitors, Lancaster Gate in London, and then at Gray's Inn (1963–1965). Later he won a Commonwealth Scholarship for post- graduate studies in England. He began his career teaching law at the University of Lagos, holding this position until retiring to go into private practice in September 1976. Later career In 1971 Adegbite was appointed Commissioner for Local Governments and Chieftaincy Matters in the old Western Region of Nigeria during the military administration of Brigadier Christopher Oluwole Rotimi. He was then appointed Commissioner for Justice and Attorney- General of the Western Region in 1973. In October 1976 he founded the legal firm of Lateef Adegbite & Co as the Principal Partner, with main office in Lagos and a branch office in Abeokuta, specialising in Commercial and Corporate Law. The Abeokuta office is in Ago-Oba. He was one of the founders of the Abeokuta Social Club in 1972. Adegbite was president of the Nigeria Olympic Committee from 1972 to 1985. He was Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council of the University of Maiduguri from 1984 to 1990. He became a member of the Executive Committee of the Lagos State Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He became a Director of Industrial and General Insurance Plc. Adegbite was appointed a Commander of the Order of the Niger (CON). He holds the traditional titles of Seriki of Egbaland and Baba Adinni of Egba Muslims. On 9 March 2011 President Goodluck Jonathan appointed him Chairman of a Presidential Committee on Public Awareness on Security and Civic Responsibilities. Dr Lateef Adegbite was a brother of the late famous, renowned historian Professor Saburi Biobaku (1918–2001), a former Vice- Chancellor of the University of Lagos. Muslim leader At the constituent assembly in 1976, Adegbite argued in favour of introducing Islamic courts of appeal into the southern states of Nigeria, arguing that Muslims had the right to have their affairs judged according to Sharia law. He has stated \\"Muslims have no other constitution and law apart from what Sharia had laid down. Sharia as a divine law supersedes all other civil and moral laws\\". He was to support efforts by M.K.O. Abiola to introduce Sharia to the southern states in the early 1990s. He reasserted this position in December 2002 during a period of heightened tension between Christians and Muslims. Adegbite was chairman of the Ogun State Pilgrims Board and a member of the National Pilgrims Board. When Ibrahim Dasuki became Sultan of Sokoto in 1988 and President-General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), Adegbite was appointed Secretary-General of the council. Under the leadership of Adegbite and Dasuki the NSCIA, which had been established in 1974, became much more active. In late 2002 and early 2003, Adegbite was engaged in a public dispute with the Nobel Prize–winning author Wole Soyinka, who accused Muslim leaders of inciting violence after rioting in Kaduna had led to many people being killed. The origin was opposition by Muslims to staging the Miss World beauty contest in Nigeria. The riots were triggered by what were taken to be blasphemous statements by a Christian newspaper reporter, Isioma Daniel, who wrote that if the Prophet had attended the event he might have picked one of the contestants as a wife. Later the deputy governor of Zamfara State, Mamauda Aliyu Shinkafi, was reported to have said in a public speech that it might be lawful for a Muslim to shed the blood of Isioma Daniel. Adegbite immediately rejected this position, since the journalist was not Muslim and the newspaper had apologised publicly. Adegbite stated in an October 2003 newspaper article that \\"the US and their allies should be persuaded to accept that the prevailing international terror would reduce considerably if justice is entrenched in the Middle East. Give the Palestinians back their land, there will no longer [be] platforms for the Osama bin Ladens of this world to thrive. Without justice there can be no peace\\". When UNESCO arranged a conference on inter-religious dialogue in Abuja in December 2003, Adegbite was invited to speak on The role of religious leaders in conflict resolution. Death Dr Adegbite died in Lagos on 28, September 2012.

(pronounced and stylized as airbnb) is an American vacation rental online marketplace company based in San Francisco, California, United States. Airbnb offers arrangement for lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking. The company was conceived after its founders rented out an air mattress in their living room, effectively turning their apartment into a bed and breakfast, to offset the high cost of rent in San Francisco. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com. On August 19, 2020, Airbnb announced that it had filed for an initial public offering. The company has been privately valued at $31 billion. History Joe Gebbia, Airbnb founder (right) Shortly after moving to San Francisco in October 2007, roommates and former schoolmates Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia came up with the idea of putting an air mattress in their living room and turning it into a bed and breakfast. In February 2008, Nathan Blecharczyk, Chesky's former roommate, joined as the Chief Technology Officer and the third co-founder of the new venture, which they named AirBed & Breakfast. They put together a website that offered short-term living quarters and breakfast for those who were unable to book a hotel in the saturated market. The site Airbedandbreakfast.com officially launched on August 11, 2008. The founders had their first customers in town in the summer of 2008, during the Industrial Design Conference held by Industrial Designers Society of America, where travelers had a hard time finding lodging in the city. Computer programmer Paul Graham invited the founders to the January 2009 winter training session of his startup incubator, Y Combinator, which provided them with training and funding in exchange for a small interest in the company. With the website already built, they used the Y-Combinator investment to fly to New York to meet users and promote the site. They returned to San Francisco with a profitable business model to present to West Coast investors. By March 2009, the site had 10,000 users and 2,500 listings. In March 2009, the name of the company was shortened to Airbnb.com, and the site's content had expanded from air beds and shared spaces to a variety of properties including entire homes and apartments, private rooms, and other properties. In April 2009, the company received seed money from Sequoia Capital. In November 2010, they raised financing from Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital in a Series A round, and announced that out of 700,000 nights booked, 80% had occurred in the previous six months. At the 2011, South by Southwest conference, Airbnb won the \\"app\\" award. In October 2011, Airbnb established an office in London, its first international office. Due to the growth of international end-users, in early 2012, Airbnb opened offices in Paris, Milan, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Moscow, and São Paulo. These openings were in addition to existing offices in San Francisco, London, Hamburg, and Berlin. In September 2013, the company announced that it would establish its European headquarters in Dublin. In November 2012, Airbnb opened an office in Sydney, Australia, its 11th office location, and announced plans to launch the service in Thailand and Indonesia. In December 2012, Airbnb announced its strategy to move more aggressively into the Asian market with the launch of an office in Singapore. In November 2012, Airbnb launched \\"Neighborhoods\\", a travel guide of 23 cities that helps travelers choose a neighborhood in which to stay based on certain criteria and personal preferences. By October 2013, Airbnb had served 9,000,000 guests since its founding in August 2008. Nearly 250,000 properties were added in 2013. In July 2014, Airbnb revealed design revisions to the site and mobile app and introduced a new logo. The logo, called the, Bélo, is intended to serve as a symbol of \\"belonging\\", and consists of four elements: a head which represents people, a location icon that represents place, a heart to symbolize love, and a letter \\"A\\" to stand for the company's name. In April 2015, following the Obama administration's easing of restrictions on U.S. businesses to operate in Cuba, Airbnb expanded to Cuba, making it one of the first U.S. companies to do so. In the summer of 2016, at the request of three members of the United States Senate, the Federal Trade Commission began investigating how Airbnb affected housing costs. In October 2016, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill charging Airbnb fines for violations of local housing laws. The New York Times reported that these events were related and part of a \\"plan that the hotel association started in early 2016 to thwart Airbnb\\". In January 2017, Airbnb led a $13 million investment in restaurant reservation-booking app, Resy, along with serial entrepreneurs Gary Vaynerchuk, Ben Leventhal and Mike Montero. Airbnb first became profitable during the second half of 2016. Airbnb's revenue grew more than 80% from 2015 to 2016. After a $200 million profit in 2018, Airbnb posted a loss of $322 million in 2019. In February 2018, the company announced Airbnb Plus, a collection of homes that have been vetted for quality of services, comfort and design, as well as Beyond by Airbnb, which offers luxury vacation rentals. By October 2019, two million people were staying with Airbnb each night. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbnb suffered a significant drop in bookings, estimated at between 41% and 96%. In response, the company lowered its internal valuation from $31 billion to $26 billion, and has considered delaying plans for an IPO. On March 30, CEO and Head of Community Brian Chesky penned a letter to hosts, pledging $250 million for widespread guest cancellations. On May 5, 2020, Brian Chesky sent a memo to all employees announcing the company would be laying off approximately 1,900 employees, or about 25% of its workforce in the Americas, Europe, and Asia due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 19, 2020, the company announced that it had filed for an initial public offering. =Funding= In January 2009, the company received $20,000 in venture funding from Y Combinator. In April 2009, the company raised $600,000 from Sequoia Capital, with Youniversity Ventures partners Jawed Karim, Keith Rabois, and Kevin Hartz participating. In November 2010, it raised $7.2 million in a Series A round of funding led by Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital. In July 2011, it raised $112 million in financing led by Andreessen Horowitz. Other early investors included Digital Sky Technologies, General Catalyst Partners, and A Grade Investments partners Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary. In April 2014, the company closed on an investment of $450 million by TPG Capital, with the company value estimated to be approximately $10 billion. Additional funding was provided by Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, T. Rowe Price and Sherpa Capital. In June 2015, Airbnb raised $1.5 billion in Series E funding led by General Atlantic, and joined by Hillhouse Capital Group, Tiger Management, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, GGV Capital, China Broadband Capital, and Horizons Ventures. In September 2016, Airbnb raised $555.5 million in funding from Google Capital and Technology Crossover Ventures, valuing the company at $30 billion. In March 2017, Airbnb raised $1 billion in funding, bringing total funding raised to more than $3 billion and valuing the company at $31 billion. In April 2020, Airbnb raised $1 billion in another round of funding from private equity firms Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners. =Acquisitions= On May 31, 2011, Airbnb acquired a German competitor, Accoleo. This takeover, as well as other similar acquisitions, launched the first international Airbnb office, in Hamburg. Before the 2012 Summer Olympics, Airbnb acquired London-based rival CrashPadder, subsequently adding 6,000 international listings to its existing inventory. This acquisition made Airbnb the largest lodging website in the United Kingdom. In November 2012, Airbnb acquired NabeWise, an online city guide that aggregates curated information for specified locations. The acquisition shifted the company's focus toward offering hyperlocal recommendations to travelers. In December 2012, Airbnb announced the acquisition of Localmind, a location-based question and answer platform. In February 2017, the company acquired Luxury Retreats International, a Canadian-based villa rental company, for approximately $300 million in cash and stock. In February 2017, Airbnb acquired Tilt.com, a social payment startup. On November 16, 2017, the company acquired Accomable, a startup focused on travel accessibility. In March 2019, the company acquired HotelTonight, a website for booking last-minute hotel rooms, for over $400 million. In August 2019, Airbnb acquired Urbandoor, a global online marketplace that offers extended stays to corporate clients. The terms of this deal were not disclosed. Overview Airbnb provides a platform for hosts to accommodate guests with short-term lodging and tourism-related activities. Guests can search for lodging using filters such as lodging type, dates, location, and price, and can search for specific types of homes, such as bed and breakfasts, unique homes, and vacation homes. Before booking, users must provide personal and payment information. Some hosts also require a scan of government-issued identification before accepting a reservation. Guests can chat with hosts through a secure messaging system. Hosts provide prices and other details for their rental or event listings, such as the allowed number of guests, home type, rules, and amenities. Hosts and guests have the ability to leave reviews about the experience. Airbnb Plus designates hosts who provide a verified level of conditions, including a clean refrigerator, full cooking equipment, stocked toiletries, fast Wi-Fi, and strong water pressure. Airbnb Plus listings are marked with a badge to differentiate from standard listings. Airbnb Collections includes Airbnb for Families, Airbnb for Work, and home venues for weddings and other gatherings. In addition to lodging, Airbnb includes listings for specific services on its platform, as Experiences; members may book both virtual and live activities with guides, including cooking classes, tours, and meetups. Terms of use and guest review system Linguist Mark Liberman has criticized the extreme length of the legal agreements that Airbnb members are required to accept, with the site's terms of service, privacy policy, and other policies amounting to \\"55081 words, or about the size of a short novel, though much less readable\\". Its 69 pages have been summarized by a lawyer. Airbnb features a review system in which guests and hosts can rate each other after a stay. Hosts and guests are unable to see reviews until both have submitted a review or until the window to review has closed, a system that aims to improve accuracy and objectivity by removing fears that users will receive a negative review in retaliation if they write one. However, the truthfulness and impartiality of reviews may be adversely affected by concerns of future stays because prospective hosts may refuse to host a user who generally leaves negative reviews. Besides, the company's policy requires users to forego anonymity, which may also detract from users' willingness to leave negative reviews. These factors may damage the objectivity of the review system. In August 2017, Airbnb cancelled numerous bookings and closed accounts belonging to attendees of the white nationalist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, citing its terms of service in which members must \\"accept people regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age.\\" The move was criticized by Jason Kessler, organizer of the rally. = Cancellations = Airbnb allows hosts to choose among three ways of cancellation policies, made to protect both hosts and guests. Options are: Flexible, Moderate, and Strict. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbnb updated its cancellation policy to allow guests to cancel their reservations for a full refund worldwide. According to the statement, \\"This policy applies to existing reservations for stays and Airbnb Experiences made on or before March 14, 2020, with check-in dates between March 14, 2020, and July 31, 2020.\\" The decision was negatively accepted by hosts who charge for cancelation. However, on March 30, Airbnb announced that they set aside US$250 million to help them regain some of the lost income, \\"When a guest cancels a reservation due to a COVID-19 related circumstance, with check-in between March 14 and May 31, we will pay you 25% of what you would normally receive through your cancellation policy.\\"  Flexible  A guest can request a full refund within 24 hours before the check-in time. If so, a guest will be refunded with a full amount of the accommodation fees.  Moderate  This type of cancellation policy is stricter yet lets guests get a refund. A guest can apply a cancellation for 5 days before check-in to be fully refunded the accommodation fees. The cancellation must be initiated by the guest.  Strict  Using Strict cancellation policy, a guest can get a 50% refund if the cancellation is made at least 7 days before the check-in time and charge $100 penalty from the Host as well, it will deduct from the hosts' future payments = Deposits = Airbnb does not charge for the deposit immediately after the reservation has been created. To charge the guest the host claims on the deposit. Also, there is a 14-day period after guest check-out for a host to make a claim on the security deposit in cases of damaging the property by guests. If the host makes a claim, the security deposit is not collected immediately. The host has to collect pieces of evidence of the damage has occurred and to reach Airbnb's Resolution Center providing them. The host has to upload both receipts for repairs and photos. Since January 2018, Airbnb lets guests book with a deposit instead of requiring to pay the full amount in advance. Regulations =Europe= Several European cities such as Barcelona, Amsterdam, Paris, and Venice have enhanced regulations for short- term rentals such as Airbnb to address the increase in the cost of living for locals, as well as the disturbances caused by tourism. In Ireland, laws were introduced to require a change in planning permission for short-term lets, restricting landlords to renting a short-term let for a maximum of 90 days per year for primary residences and requiring registration by landlords with local authorities. Despite this, only a minority of landlords offering properties on Airbnb actually registered by end 2019, prompting calls for stricter enforcement. =United States= In the United States, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Santa Monica, San Francisco, Charleston, and New York have imposed restrictions. Jersey City, New Jersey has the most listings in the state and the number one destination for Airbnb and is also considered part of the New York City Airbnb market. A November 2019 referendum (originally supported by Airbnb) approved regulations for short-term rentals which are considered the most stringent in United States., allowing for only 60 rental days per year. =Japan= In 2018, Japan created new regulations regarding home-sharing, which includes hosts registering and limiting the numbers of days a home can be rented to 180. Controversies =Fair housing implications and discrimination= In July 2016, former Attorney General Eric Holder was hired to help craft an anti-discrimination policy for Airbnb after the company faced many complaints related to racism, including a study by Harvard Business School that showed widespread discrimination by hosts against guests whose names suggested that they were black. Airbnb has also faced complaints of racial discrimination in China. =Housing affordability= Airbnb has been criticized for allegedly resulting in increased housing prices. Since the company's globalization, many governments have passed various regulations limiting operations of short-term housing rental companies, such as Airbnb. In San Francisco, the issue led to protests in November 2015. Several studies found that rental prices in many areas increased due to Airbnb, as landlords kept properties off the longer-term rental market and instead get higher rental rates for short-term housing via Airbnb. Landlords have been accused of illegally evicting tenants in order to convert properties into Airbnb listings. A study published in 2017 found that increasing Airbnb listings in a given neighborhood by 10% leads to a 0.42% increase in rents and a 0.76% increase in house prices. A study found that on Manhattan's Lower East Side, full-time listings earned hosts an average of two to three times the median average rent. A study by the University of Massachusetts Boston Department of Economics found that with every 12 Airbnb listings per census tract, asking rents increased by 0.4%. Similar concerns have been raised in other parts of the world such as Scotland, where, in 2017, an increase in Airbnb listings alarmed the local community. Airbnb has carried out extensive lobbying of Scottish politicians to oppose a law which would restrict short-term lettings.The Times https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/airbnb-lobby-msps-every- month-bs8scg2r5 In late 2019, Airbnb delisted thousands of listings in Boston in preparation for new city rules in December which requires all rental units be registered and limited to 90 days a year. Boston has some of the toughest short term regulations in the US. These new regulations are meant to preserve housing availability by limiting investor units =Negative guest experiences= In 2017, travel blogger Asher Fergusson analyzed 1,021 incidents of negative experiences reported by guests. He found that there are ways for hosts to use fake information to circumvent Airbnb's background checks. He noted several reported incidents including last-minute cancellations, moldy or rodent-infested lodging, theft, invasion of privacy, and even rape and murder. Airbnb responded that the 1,021 incidents are statistically insignificant compared to 260 million check-ins at the time and that the company tries to remedy any problems. =Bait-and-switch scams= A Vice News journalist reported in October 2019 on a bait-and-switch scam in which a network of fake accounts advertised stays at dozens of properties across eight US cities that once booked was said to be unavailable at the last minute. Substandard alternatives were offered in their place, including to the journalist, refunds were refused, fake positive reviews were left for the fake properties, and negative retaliatory reviews were left for customers who complained. Airbnb closed some of the accounts and the FBI began an investigation in response to the report. A Wired journalist reported a similar scam in London in February 2020 run by a German man, Christian Baumann, and his company Continental Apartments. Airbnb closed the accounts, but Wandsworth Borough Council planning office took no action. =Delisting of West Bank settlements= In 2018, Airbnb announced that it will remove the approximately 200 \\"listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians\\".

The move was praised by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, Palestinians, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International. The move was criticized by the Israeli Tourism Minister and the Simon Wiesenthal Center,Airbnb won't operate in Israel's West Bank, prompting calls for a boycott, Los Angeles Times, November 19, 2018 which decried the move as antisemitism. A class action suit in the Jerusalem District Court alleging discrimination based on place of residence was filed against Airbnb by affected property owners.Class Action Suit Filed in Jerusalem Court against Airbnb, Jerusalem Post, November 23, 2018Israeli settlers sue Airbnb for delisting West Bank homes, Deutsche Welle, November 24, 2018 In April 2019 the company announced that it \\"will not move forward with implementing the removal of listings in the West Bank from the platform\\" and that \\"Any profits generated for Airbnb … will be donated to non- profit organizations dedicated to humanitarian aid that serve people in different parts of the world\\". =Regulatory violation= In New York State it is illegal to rent out an apartment for less than thirty days unless the registered tenant is at home. In 2018, New York City passed legislation requiring Airbnb and other short-term rentals/home-sharing services to submit monthly reports to the city. Airbnb contested the law and in January it was blocked from taking effect pending further litigation. In May 2019, Airbnb agreed to turn over some anonymized information for approximately 17,000 listings so that the city could pursue illegal rentals. Similar cases have been settled in Boston and Miami. Philanthropy In November 2012, Airbnb partnered with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to offer free housing for people displaced by Hurricane Sandy. Airbnb built a microsite, where victims registered for housing and property owners offered free housing. Service fees were waived, while the host guarantee was maintained. In 2013, Airbnb launched its Global Citizenship Champion program in cities where its offices are located. In January 2017, the company offered free housing to refugees and any others not allowed into the United States as a result of Donald Trump’s Executive Order 13769, which temporarily banned refugees from the United States. In June 2017, Airbnb launched Open Homes, to connect hosts offering free or low-cost housing to uprooted people, such as refugees and those fleeing natural disasters. In 2018, Airbnb employees provided \\"11,000 hours of service to 250 projects worldwide\\", according to the company, as a result of its policy to provide employees with paid time off to be used for volunteering.  COVID-19 response  In a letter to employees, CEO Brian Chesky said the company was letting 1,900 of its 7,500 workers go due to the COVID-19 pandemic and cutting businesses that don't directly support home- sharing. Those include its investments in hotels, air transportation, and movie production. Other ventures Airbnb runs Rausch Street Films. Its first release which it produced and financed, Gay Chorus Deep South, premiered in film festivals and through its distributor MTV Documentary Films, had a United States limited theatrical run in 2019 and airing on MTV's flagship US network that same year.

Early life He was born April 4, 1862, at the Shields Ranch, which was located near Rancho Cordova, California on the American River, to John Shields who emigrated in 1850 from Donegal, Ireland and Elizabeth (née Bowe) Shields, who emigrated from Waterford, Ireland in 1855. Both parents had survived the Great Hunger or Great Famine which occurred beginning in 1845, and both had walked the Panama Isthmus on foot to arrive in San Francisco, and later, Sacramento. His father, John, had participated in the Gold Rush in California and dug up 80 nuggets to purchase the undeveloped property, which became the Shields Ranch. He was the third child, and named Peter after his mother's first husband, who died of cholera on the ship taking them from the Isthmus of Panama to San Francisco, where she buried him in the sandy cliffs of the new city. Personal life He married Carolee Wiltsie of Sacramento in 1901, and celebrated their 50th anniversary in 1951. The couple had one child who did not survive infancy. Career He earned his first dollar trucking watermelons from the ranch to Sacramento. At 17 he graduated from Christian Brothers College in Sacramento, then studied law reading in the office of the distinguished Jurist Amos Catlin. Illness forced him to quit law during his twenties, but in his thirties, he was the private secretary to Governor James Budd, Secretary of the State Agricultural Society, and a law partner of Hiram W. Johnson who was later elected a governor and a United States senator. In 1900, at 38, he was elected to the Superior Court in Sacramento. During his years on the bench, he took his mother's passion and philosophy for agriculture and became deeply embedded in the California Agricultural Law, policies and culture. Of all his accomplishments, he was most proud of being known as the father of UC Davis, which he helped found in 1906. UC Davis has grown into a major university and hospital. The main UC Davis library and street still bear his name, and on campus there is an oak grove planted in his honor him. After his death, the Shields White Flower Garden was established when his wife of 60 years, Carolee died. Shields helped push through the California State Legislature a bill establishing the UC Davis Agricultural College, fought for the funds and even helped select the site. A Peter J. Shields Scholarship fund of $7500 was established in 1939. He raised a prize-winning herd of Jersey Cattle and won so many prizes at the California State Fair, he finally withdrew to give others a chance to win. During his career, many friends and peers urged him to run for Congress or a higher court, or even another higher political office, but Judge Shields refused, saying his \\"life and service belonged to the people of Sacramento\\". In keeping with this pledge, he wrote an annual birth message in the Sacramento Bee imparting his generous and intelligent philosophy and personal wisdom, applied to the problems of the time and looking into the future. He was active in promoting and establishing the Boy Scout movement in these region, and was an early president of the Golden Empire Council. Other accomplishments include being instrumental in the founding of the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento. When he was 95 years old, there was an article in the Bee citing a huge ovation of over 1000 students at UC Davis in Davis, Yolo County, and the college he established just west of Sacramento. In his annual birthday article, he called \\"The advanced years time to perfect life's work.\\" He died at age 100, and left his entire estate to his widow. Politics A dedicated Jeffersonian Democrat and strong supporter of Congressman John Moss and Governor Edmund Brown of California, Shields served in honorary capacities in the campaigns of the later both for attorney general and for governor. He was known to be a confidant of presidents, senators, governors and educators.

He is best known for the way in which he threw himself into the political and ecclesiastical struggles of his time. Charles Teeling considered him \\"one of the first and boldest advocates of the emancipation of his country and the union of all her sons.\\" Early life Barber was a native of Co. Antrim. He was the younger son of John Barber, a farmer near Killead. He entered Glasgow College in 1757, was licensed 1761 (on second trials 28 August at Larne) by Templepatrick presbytery, and ordained by Dromore presbytery, 3 May 1763, at Rathfriland, Co. Down, where he ministered till his death. He was a good Latinist, Tacitus being his favourite author; his Greek was thin; he was somewhat given to rabbinical studies, having collected a small store of learned books on this subject. Minister and colonel When Lord Glerawley disarmed the Rathfriland regiment of volunteers in 1782, the officers and men chose Barber as their colonel in his stead. In this double capacity he preached (in regimentals) a sermon to the volunteers, in the Third Presbyterian Congregation, Belfast. He sat in the three volunteer conventions of 1782, 1783, and 1793, as a strong advocate of parliamentary reform, catholic emancipation, and a revision of the tithe system, the revenue laws, and the Irish pension list. Lord Kilwarlin, being asked to contribute to the rebuilding of his meeting-house, said he would rather pay to pull it down (broadsheet of August 1783). In 1786 Richard Woodward, Bishop of Cloyne, published his Present State of the Church of Ireland, to prove that none but Episcopalians could be loyal to the constitution. Barber's Remarks in reply showed him a master of satire, and embodied the most trenchant pleas for disestablishment that any dissenter had yet put forth (\\"Must seven-eighths of the nation for ever crouch to the eighth?\\"). Woodward made no response. Imprisonment and later career In 1790 Barber was moderator of the general synod. He took a leading part in the Down election of that year, which returned the Hon. Robert Stewart (afterwards Lord Castlereagh) in the Presbyterian interest, after a contest of thirteen weeks. In 1798 the authorities regarded him as a dangerous man. He was seized by a body of troops at his residence in the townland of Tullyquilly, and lodged in Downpatrick gaol on a charge of high treason. On 14 and 16 July he was tried by court- martial, but nothing was proved against him; he was never a United Irishman. However, he was detained in durance, and his third daughter, Margaret, a girl of sixteen, voluntarily shared his imprisonment. On his release, after a long confinement, he could obtain no redress. In religion, as in politics, he was a pronounced liberal, though no controversialist. His manuscript sermons are unmistakably Arian, and in the original draft of his Remarks he says, \\"Suppose now any legislator should so far forget common sense as to decree three one, and one three, &c.;\\" He was fond of quoting the Greek Testament in his sermons, and (marvellous to say) his draft of a petition to parliament from his presbytery contains two citations from Theodoret in the original. For an incident of his pastoral experience, turning on the difficulties of the then Irish marriage law, can be found in the autobiography of Catherine Cappe. Montgomery assigns to him \\"a singularly vigorous mind, a cultivated taste, a ready wit, a fluent elocution, a firm purpose, an unsullied character, and a most courteous demeanour.\\" Barber died 5 September 1811, in his seventy-fourth year. Family In 1771 Barber married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of the Rev. Andrew Kennedy, of Mourne, and had seven children, but no son survived him. His daughter Margaret, (12 August 1782 – 21 May 1875), married John Galt Smith, of Belfast. George Kennedy Smith, his son, was left Barber's portrait and manuscripts. Publications Barber wrote: *Funeral Sermon for the Rev. George Richey (Job xxxiv. 15), Newry, 1772. *Volunteer Sermon (2 Sam. xiii. 28), 1782 (a very spirited piece, under apprehension of foreign invasion). *Remarks on a Pamphlet … by Richard, Lord Bishop of Cloyne, Dublin, 1787. *Synodical Sermon at Lurgan (Rev. xviii. 20), 1791 (reckons the Nicene council as the beginning of the reign of Antichrist, and the French revolution as the omen of its fall). Nos. 2 and 4 appear to have been published, but were also circulated in manuscript.

Education Chipman attended St. Paul's High School in Winnipeg, graduating in 1979. From 1979 to 1983, he studied economics at the University of North Dakota, while playing football for the Fighting Sioux. He obtained his J.D. degree from the same institution in 1985. Business career =Megill-Stephenson Company= After working as a lawyer in Florida, Chipman returned to Winnipeg in 1988 and joined Birchwood Automotive Group, a group of car dealerships founded by his father, Robert Chipman.Hockey Canada Foundation Board of Directors Since 2001, Mark has been the president of Megill- Stephenson Company, the Chipman family's holding company, whose subsidiaries include True North Sports & Entertainment, the Birchwood dealerships, and Longboat Development Corporation, the company's real estate development division. Megill-Stephenson also founded a financing company called National Leasing in 1977, which it sold in 2009. Its real estate division, the Stevenson Group of companies, was largely divested in 2015. Longboat Development Corporation is currently developing a $75 million mixed-use tower across from the MTS Centre, on the north side of Portage Avenue. The key part of the project is a 20-storey, tower featuring commercial space and a hotel. Most of the tower is occupied by two tenants: Canadian firm Stantec and the Quebec-based Groupe Germain. Stantec has consolidated its Winnipeg operations within the tower's office space, while the Germaine Group has opened an ALT Hotel that occupies the top twelve floors. The rest of the building will be developed into restaurant and retail space. A 450-stall parkade is also under construction. Construction began in early 2012 and some portions of the building opened in Spring of 2015. =True North Sports & Entertainment= After the original Winnipeg Jets left for Phoenix in 1996, Chipman was part of a group that purchased the International Hockey League's Minnesota Moose and moved them to Winnipeg, renaming them the Manitoba Moose. With the demise of the IHL in 2001, Chipman was instrumental in brokering a deal which saw six former IHL teams, including the Moose, accepted into the American Hockey League. Chipman and a group of local investors created True North Sports & Entertainment in 2001 for the purpose of building a new sports and entertainment venue in downtown Winnipeg. Originally called the True North Centre, Bell MTS Place opened in 2004 and became the new home of the Moose. Ownership of the Moose was transferred to True North in 2003 in order to consolidate the operations of the team and new arena. Chipman's ultimate goal was to bring an NHL team back to Winnipeg to fill the void left by the Jets. As early as 2009, True North was reported to be in talks to purchase the Phoenix Coyotes from the NHL and relocate the club back to Winnipeg. At the same time, there were also rumors that the Atlanta Thrashers were up for sale as well. After two years of on-and-off again talks with the NHL regarding the Coyotes, Chipman and True North were presented the opportunity to purchase the Atlanta Thrashers. On May 31, 2011, Chipman and NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced that a deal had been reached to purchase the Thrashers and relocate them to Winnipeg for the upcoming season. The NHL Board of Governors approved the sale and relocation a few weeks later. At the 2011 NHL Draft held in St. Paul, Minnesota; Chipman revealed the franchise's new name just before making its first-round pick. As chairman and principal owner of the Jets, Chipman represents the Jets at the NHL Board of Governors, and is currently a member of the board's executive committee. Honours In 2005, Chipman was awarded the James C. Hendy Memorial Award as the AHL's top executive. He also received the Thomas Ebright Memorial Award in 2011 for his outstanding contributions to the AHL. In 2012, Chipman was made a member of the Order of Manitoba by the Honourable Philip S. Lee, the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. Later in 2012, Chipman was honoured by UND as the recipient of the Sioux Award, the highest award given by university, for his accomplishments and community service. Personal Chipman serves on the board of the Hockey Canada Foundation and the Hockey Hall of Fame Selection Committee. He is married to Patti; they have three daughters.

Each iron atom has octahedral coordination bonds to the oxygen atoms of three oxalate molecules and one water molecule. Two of those three oxalates, lying in approximately perpendicular planes, are tetradentate, and connect the iron atoms into zigzag chains. The third oxalate molecule is bidentate, and connects iron atoms of adjacent chains, creating an open-layered structure. Half of the water molecules lie, unbound, between those chains.

The extant text comprises three khaņḑas (parts): pūrvakhaņḑa, madhyakhaņḑa and uttarakhaņḑa. On the basis of its usage of Sanskrit words with unusual meaning and Sanskrit proverbs popular in Bengal, a number of modern scholars believe that this text was written in Bengal. According to R. C. Hazra, a modern scholar, this text was composed in the second half of the 13th century. He classified it as a non-sectarian Upapurana.Hazra, R. C. (1962, reprint 2003). The Upapuranas in S. Radhakrishnan (ed.) The Cultural Heritage of India, Vol.II, Kolkata:The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, , p.285 Editions and translations The first printed edition of this text was published by The Asiatic Society, Calcutta (1888–97), as a part of their Bibliotheca Indica series. It was edited by Haraprasad Shastri. In 1894, the Vangavasi Press, Calcutta published another edition of this text along with a Bengali translation by Panchanan Tarkaratna, who edited it. In 1915, a free and abridged English translation by Syama Charan Banerji was published from Lucknow by the Indian Commercial Press as the first volume of its Rambles in Scripture Land series. Contents The pūrvakhaņḑa and madhyakhaņḑa of both the Asiatic Society and the Vangavasi edition have 30 chapters. While the uttarakhaņḑa of the Asiatic Society edition comprises 14 chapters, the Vangavasi edition comprises 21 chapters and R. C. Hazra considers these additional 7 chapters (15-21) as the essential part of the text. =The pūrvakhaņḑa= The pūrvakhaņḑa begins at the Naimisha Forest, with Suta reporting to the sages assembled there about Vyasa's discourse to Jabali on dharma and its constituent parts: satya, daya, shanti and ahimsa. In answer to Jabali's next question, Vyasa advises him about the gurus (teachers) in general and particularly the gurus occupying the highest position, one's parents. He illustrated his views on one's duty to his parents with a narrative of hunter Tuladhara and his advice to brahmin Kritabodha. In chapters 5-30, Vyasa, in answer to another question of Jabali, describes the tirthas (sacred places), reporting it as a conversation between goddess Rudrani and her two associates, Jaya and Vijaya. The description starts with a song of praise to Ganga and it includes the origin and sanctity of tulasi (Ocimum tenuiflorum) plant and the bilva (Aegle marmelos) tree. It also comprises descriptions on kalatirthas (auspicious times), which include auspicious times for Devi worship and studying religious texts. =The madhyakhaņḑa= The madhyakhaņḑa begins with Jabali's request for further information about Ganga. Vyasa answers his question in the form of a conversation between sage Śuka and his disciple Jaimini. The first chapter describes the creation as the yoga (union) of Brahma and the prakriti of the three guṇas of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The second chapter has a brief description about Daksha and his daughter Sati. It is followed by a detailed narrative of Daksha, Shiva and Sati from the chapter 3 onwards, which ends in selection of Kamarupa as his abode by Shiva after Sati's yoni fell there, when her body was cut to pieces by Vishnu. In chapter 11, Sati appears before Shiva, who was in a meeting with Brahma and Vishnu and predicts that she will reincarnate as Ganga and Uma. Chapters 12-28 deal with the narratives of Ganga from her birth as daughter of Himalaya and Mena. Chapter 14 describes about Narayana's instruction of music to sage Narada as a related story. These narratives related to Ganga are briefly interrupted in chapter 23, which describes the birth of Uma as the second daughter of Himalaya and Mena. Chapter 29 describes Manus and manvantaras and the kings belonging to solar and lunar dynasties. The last chapter (chapter 30) narrates the story of birth of Ganesha and his acquiring the head of an elephant. =The uttarakhaņḑa= The uttarakhaņḑa starts with the discussion about dharma. A general discussion on dharma followed by the specific dharmas to be followed by the people belonging to four varnas during their various stages of life (ashramas). This discussion includes a passage supporting the practice of Sati which mentions that it is the obligation of a widow to follow her husband in death (Chapter 8, 8-10). The following chapters deal with a number of vratas, hymns to the Navagraha deities, the four yugas and the narrative of Vena which includes his creation of 36 mixed castes, whose members were later assigned specific trades by the Brahmins during the reign of Vena's son Prithu. The chapters 15-21, which are only found in the Vangavasi edition describes the story of Krishna's birth and the role played by Devi in it. They also comprise a description of Kali Yuga. The text ends with a eulogy of the Purana, describing it as a Vaishnava, Shaiva and Shakta shastra (21.5).

It is the third game in the Rhythm Heaven series, following Rhythm Tengoku for the Game Boy Advance and Rhythm Heaven for the Nintendo DS, and was succeeded by Rhythm Heaven Megamix for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016. The game was released in Japan on July 21, 2011, in North America on February 13, 2012, in Europe on July 6, 2012, and in Australia on September 13, 2012. It was digitally re-released for the Wii U in Japan on July 27, 2016, in North America on November 10, 2016 and in Europe on November 22, 2016. Gameplay As with Rhythm Tengoku and its DS sequel, Rhythm Heaven Fever features various levels with their own set of rules, requiring the player to play in time to the rhythm in order to clear them. These levels range from stabbing peas with a fork, to attacking evil spirits with a sword, and playing badminton in midair. The game is played by either tapping the A button, or squeezing the A and B buttons together. At the end of each level, players are ranked on their performance, with at least an 'OK' rank required to clear the level and progress onto the next. Each set of levels culminates in a Remix stage, which combines all of the gameplay elements of the previous levels in one stage. Clearing levels with a Superb rating earns medals which unlock extra content, including Rhythm Toys, Endless Games and four levels from the original Rhythm Tengoku, plus a bonus credits level. Levels that have been cleared with a Superb rating may also be randomly selected for a Perfect attempt, in which the player can try to clear the level without making any mistakes with the maximum of 3 retries before the perfect challenge disappears. Clearing these unlock bonus items such as songs and lyrics. The game also features a Dual Mode in which two players can play simultaneously. Unlike its predecessors, Rhythm Heaven Fever also has a two- player mode. Levels played in this mode require players to earn enough points in total to reach the desired rank and clear each stage, with bonus points awarded based on the harmony of the players that can improve the rank. These levels come with their own set of medals which can unlock multiplayer minigames. Development Producer Yoshio Sakamoto and Nintendo SPD Group No.1 were responsible for the programming, graphic design, and some of the music in the game. Collaborator and musician Tsunku and his music studio TNX created several of the performed vocal songs found throughout the game. In the English versions of the game, an endless minigame based on manzai routines was removed due to the dialogue focused nature of the game and was replaced with another minigame from Rhythm Tengoku known as \\"Mr. Upbeat\\". The European and Australian versions of the game allow players to toggle between English and Japanese voices and songs. Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one nine, two eights, and one seven for a total of 32 out of 40, and it sold over 100,000 copies in its first week there.

Life Barclay entered the Royal Marines in 1755 as a second lieutenant, and became first lieutenant in 1756. He served throughout the Seven Years' War, at first in the Mediterranean, then in the expedition to Belle Île in 1760, and lastly on the coast of Africa; he was promoted captain in 1762. He served with distinction through the American War of Independence, particularly at the Red Bank and in the mud forts, and was in command of the marines on board the Augusta, when the frigate answered the fire of the forts, and was deserted on being herself set on fire in the Delaware River. For these services he was promoted major by brevet in 1777. He was one of the commanding officers of marines in Rodney's great action with De Grasse, and was after it promoted lieutenant colonel by brevet in 1783. Barclay saw no further active service at sea, but was for the next thirty years chiefly employed on the staff of the Marines in England. He became major in the Marines in 1791, and lieutenant colonel, and colonel by brevet in 1794. In 1796 he became major general, and in 1798 second colonel commandant in his corps. In this capacity he had much to do with the organisation of the marines, and effected many reforms in their uniform and drill. In 1803 he became lieutenant general and colonel commandant of the marines, and in 1806 resident colonel commandant. He was now practically commander-in-chief of the whole corps under the admiralty, and the universal testimony borne to its good character testifies to the excellence of its organisation, and it must be remembered that not only in the mutinies of Spithead and the Nore, but in all the mutinous manifestations which occurred, the marines proved that they could be depended on to check mutiny among the sailors. In 1813 he became general, and in 1814 retired from the service after continuous employment for fifty-nine years. He went to live at Taunton, where he died in November 1823.

It attracted media attention in May 2010 when two brothers, Tony and Nayef Saleh, were shot by Hanna al-Bersawi on May 28, apparently for political reasons only days before the municipal polls.Lebanon Daily Star article History of demographic change From recent subdivisions from larger parcels of land that was previously being used for olive harvesting, there have been numerous apartment buildings being built outside of the Dahr Al-Ain main village centre towards the Barsa side of the town (south and south east of the village). The new inhabitants are a mixture of Sunni Muslims (from Tripoli), Eastern Orthodox and Maronites from within and the surrounding areas. The buyers and inhabitants of these 5-6 apartment blocks with 4 apartments in each (6 * 4= 24 new families) are mostly from the Sunni sect of Islam who are now unable to afford higher rents and unable to purchase within the tripoli-Al Mina areas. This change in demographics has the ability to shift the demographics of some smaller villagers and towns found closest to the highway south of Tripoli into the Koura. It is estimated that Dahr Al-Ain has a total resident population of 500-700. With the 34 new families, each with the possibility of containing 4 persons per household, that equates to an increase of 96 persons to the village of varying religions as a result from one large piece of land being sold and further subdivided. It would only require a further 4-5 larger pieces of lands to be sold to developers to shift the demographics of the Maronite majority village to a Sunni majority village. With the increase of Sunni inhabitants into the area (attracted to the cheaper properties and rents or a calculated shift in demographics) services pertaining to the new residents e.g. mosques and schools has the ability to increase sectarian tensions as Dahr Al-Ain does not have a mosque and the closest mosque would be situated 5–10 minutes away in Ras Masqa (above Qalamoun) and one being constructed in Dedde. A similar change in demographics is also occurring but to a higher degree to areas surrounding Qalamoun and Tripoli within Ras Masqa (Orthodox and Maronite with Sunni), Dedde (Orthodox with Sunni), Barsa (Orthodox and Maronite with Sunni), Dahr Al-Ain (Maronite with Orthodox and Sunni), Hret al Khalsa (Sunni) and Semriye (Orthodox with Sunni and Maronites). These areas are accessible within ease to and from Tripoli (where most people work, study and have family ties) by a newly asphalted highway that travels to the south from Tripoli through Bahsas and towards Kousba.

Early life Barclay was born near Strabane in county Tyrone, Ireland, his family being of Scottish extraction. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and proceeded B.A. in 1854 and M.A. in 1857, but showed no particular powers of application or study. In 1854 he was ordained to a curacy at Bagnelstown, county Carlow, and on taking up his residence there began to show very great interest in the work of the London Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews. The question of Jewish conversion was at that time agitating the religious world in England, and Barclay supported the cause in his own neighbourhood with great activity, till in 1858 he offered himself to the London Society as a missionary. He left Ireland, and after a few months' study in London, was appointed to Constantinople. The mission there had been established in 1835, but no impression had been made on the 60,000 Jews calculated to inhabit the town. Barclay stayed in Constantinople till 1861, making missionary journeys to the Danubian provinces, Rhodes, and other nearer districts. Career in the Anglican Church In 1861 he was nominated incumbent of Christ Church, Jerusalem, a position requiring energy and tact to avoid entanglement in the quarrels of the parties whose rivalries Barclay describes as a ‘fretting leprosy’ neutralising his best efforts. In 1865 he visited England and Ireland on private matters, received the degree of LL.D. from his university, and married. On his return he found it impossible to continue in his post unless his salary was increased, and the refusal of the London Society to do this necessitated his resignation. This was in 1870; he returned again to England and filled for a time the curacies of Howe, Lincolnshire and St. Margaret's, Westminster, till in 1873 he was presented to the living of Stapleford in the St. Albans diocese. The comparative leisure thus afforded him enabled him to publish in 1877 translations of certain select treatises of the Talmud with his own prolegomena and notes. Opinion has been much divided as to the value of this work, but Jewish critics are unanimous in asserting that it is marked by an unfair animus against their nation and literature. Later life In 1880 he received the degree of D.D. from Dublin University. In 1879 the see of Jerusalem became vacant, and Barclay's experience and attainments marked him out as the only man likely to fill the post successfully. He was consecrated a bishop, by Archibald Campbell Tait, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 25 July at St Paul's Cathedral. He was most enthusiastically welcomed to Jerusalem, and entered on his duties with his usual vigour, but his sudden death after a short illness in October 1881 put an end to the hopes of those who believed that at last some of the objects of the original founders of the Anglo- Prussian Bishopric in Jerusalem were to be realised. Bishop Barclay's attainments were most extensive. He preached in Spanish, French, and German; he was intimately acquainted with Biblical, Mishnaic Hebrew and Judaeo- Spanish, the dialect spoken by the Sephardic Jews. He diligently prosecuted his studies in Hebrew and at his death was perfecting his knowledge of Arabic; and he had acquired some knowledge of Turkish during his residence in Constantinople.

In 1945 the Argentina national team coach, Guillermo Stábile called Rugilo to play two matches in the United Kingdom, facing England and Ireland.Interview to Rugilo in Siete Días Ilustrados, 1972 Although Rugilo only played four matches for the Argentina national team, he gained recognition on May 9, 1951, when Argentina played against England at Wembley Stadium. Although Argentina was beaten 2-1, journalists praised his performance at the match, nicknaming him \\"El León de Wembley\\" (\\"The Lion of Wembley\\")\\"Rugilo, el León de Wembley\\", by Félix Frascara , El Grafico magazine and he would be called that way until his death in 1993.

It allows users to send text messages and voice messages, make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other media. WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile devices but is also accessible from desktop computers, as long as the user's mobile device remains connected to the Internet while they use the desktop app. The service requires users to provide a standard cellular mobile number for registering with the service. In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app targeted at small business owners, called WhatsApp Business, to allow companies to communicate with customers who use the standard WhatsApp client. The client application was created by WhatsApp Inc. of Mountain View, California, which was acquired by Facebook in February 2014 for approximately US$19.3 billion. It became the world's most popular messaging application by 2015, and has over 2billion users worldwide . It has become the primary means of electronic communication in multiple countries and locations, including Latin America, the Indian subcontinent, and large parts of Europe and Africa.  History  = 2009–2014 = WhatsApp was founded in by Brian Acton and Jan Koum, former employees of Yahoo!. After leaving Yahoo! in September 2007, they took some time off in South America. At one point, they applied for jobs at Facebook but were rejected. In January 2009, after purchasing an iPhone and realizing the potential of the app industry on the App Store, Koum and Acton began visiting Koum's friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose to discuss a new type of messaging app that would \\"show statuses next to individual names of the people\\". They realized that to take the idea further, they would need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum. Koum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \\"what's up\\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept crashing, Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job. Acton encouraged him to wait for a \\"few more months\\". In June 2009, Apple launched push notifications, allowing users to be pinged when they were not using an app. Koum changed WhatsApp so that when a user's status is changed, everyone in the user's network would be notified. WhatsApp 2.0 was released with a messaging component and the number of active users suddenly increased to 250,000. Although Acton was working on another startup idea, he decided to join the company. In October 2009, Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in seed funding, and Acton became a co-founder and was given a stake. He officially joined WhatsApp on November 1. After months at beta stage, the application launched in November 2009, exclusively on the App Store for the iPhone. Koum then hired a friend in Los Angeles, Chris Peiffer, to develop a BlackBerry version, which arrived two months later. In 2010, WhatsApp was subject to multiple acquisition offers from Google which were promptly declined. To cover the primary cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free service to a paid one. In December 2009, the ability to send photos was added to the iPhone version. By early 2011, WhatsApp was one of the top 20 apps at Apple's U.S. App Store. In April 2011, Sequoia Capital invested about $8 million for more than 15% of the company, after months of negotiation with Sequoia partner Jim Goetz. By February 2013, WhatsApp had about 200 million active users and 50 staff members. Sequoia invested another $50 million, and WhatsApp was valued at $1.5 billion. In a December 2013 blog post, WhatsApp claimed that 400 million active users used the service each month. = Facebook subsidiary (2014–present) = On February 19, 2014, just one year after a venture capital financing round at a $1.5 billion valuation, Facebook, Inc. announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 billion, its largest acquisition to date. At the time, it was the largest acquisition of a venture-backed company in history. Sequoia Capital received an approximate 5000% return on its initial investment. Facebook, which was advised by Allen & Co, paid $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in Facebook shares, and (advised by Morgan Stanley) an additional $3 billion in restricted stock units granted to WhatsApp's founders Koum and Acton. Employee stock was scheduled to vest over four years subsequent to closing. Days after the announcement, WhatsApp users experienced a loss of service, leading to anger across social media. The acquisition caused a considerable number of users to try and/or move to other message services. Telegram claimed that it acquired 8 million new users; and Line, 2 million. At a keynote presentation at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February 2014, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp was closely related to the Internet.org vision. A TechCrunch article said this about Zuckerberg's vision: > The idea, he said, is to develop a group of basic internet services that > would be free of charge to use – 'a 911 for the internet.' These could be a > social networking service like Facebook, a messaging service, maybe search > and other things like weather. Providing a bundle of these free of charge to > users will work like a gateway drug of sorts – users who may be able to > afford data services and phones these days just don't see the point of why > they would pay for those data services. This would give them some context > for why they are important, and that will lead them to paying for more > services like this – or so the hope goes. Just three days after announcing the Facebook purchase, Koum said they were working to introduce voice calls. He also said that new mobile phones would be sold in Germany with the WhatsApp brand and that their ultimate goal was to be on all smartphones. In August 2014, WhatsApp was the most globally popular messaging app, with more than 600 million users. By early January 2015, WhatsApp had 700 million monthly users and over 30 billion messages every day. In April 2015, Forbes predicted that between 2012 and 2018, the telecommunications industry would lose $386 billion because of OTT services like WhatsApp and Skype. That month, WhatsApp had over 800 million users. By September 2015, it had grown to 900 million; and by February 2016, one billion. Voice calls between two accounts were added to the app in March and April 2015.WhatsApp finally adds voice calls for all Android users, iOS coming soon – James Vincent, The Verge, March 31, 2015 On November 30, 2015, the Android WhatsApp client made links to another message service, Telegram, unclickable and uncopyable. Multiple sources confirmed that it was intentional, not a bug, and that it had been implemented when the Android source code that recognized Telegram URLs had been identified. (The word \\"telegram\\" appeared in WhatsApp's code.) Some considered it an anti- competitive measure, but WhatsApp offered no explanation. = Recent (2016–present) = On January 18, 2016, WhatsApp's co-founder Jan Koum announced that it would no longer charge users a $1 annual subscription fee, in an effort to remove a barrier faced by users without credit cards. He also said that the app would not display any third-party ads, and that it would have new features such as the ability to communicate with businesses. By June 2016, the company's blog reported more than 100 million voice calls per day were being placed on WhatsApp. On November 10, 2016, WhatsApp launched a beta version of two-step verification for Android users, which allowed them to use their email addresses for further protection. Also in November 2016, Facebook ceased collecting WhatsApp data for advertising in Europe. Later that month, video calls between two accounts were introduced.WhatsApp Is Now Rolling Out Video Calling For iPhone, Android And Windows Phone – Amit Chowdhry, November 15, 2016 On February 24, 2017, (WhatsApp's 8th birthday), WhatsApp launched a new Status feature similar to Snapchat and Facebook stories. On May 18, 2017, it was reported that the European Commission would fine Facebook €110 million for \\"misleading\\" it during the 2014 takeover of WhatsApp. The Commission alleged that in 2014 when Facebook acquired the messaging app, it \\"falsely claimed it was technically impossible to automatically combine user information from Facebook and WhatsApp\\". However, in the summer of 2016, WhatsApp had begun sharing user information with its parent company, allowing information such as phone numbers to be used for targeted Facebook advertisements. Facebook acknowledged the breach, but said the errors in their 2014 filings were \\"not intentional\\". In September 2017, WhatsApp's co-founder Brian Acton left the company to start a nonprofit group, later revealed as the Signal Foundation, which now develops the WhatsApp competitor Signal. WhatsApp also announced a forthcoming business platform to enable companies to provide customer service at scale, and airlines KLM and Aeroméxico announced their participation in the testing. Both airlines previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform. In January 2018, WhatsApp launched WhatsApp Business for small business use. In April 2018, WhatsApp co- founder and CEO Jan Koum announced he would be leaving the company. Facebook later announced that Koum's replacement would be Chris Daniels. Later in September 2018, WhatsApp introduced group audio and video call features. In October, the \\"Swipe to Reply\\" option was added to the Android beta version, 16 months after it was introduced for iOS. On October 25, 2018, WhatsApp announced support for Stickers. But unlike other platforms WhatsApp requires third party apps to add Stickers to WhatsApp. On November 25, 2019, WhatsApp announced an investment of $250,000 into the startup ecosystem through a partnership with Startup India, where it will provide 500 startups with Facebook ad credits of $500 each. In December 2019, WhatsApp announced that a new update would lock out any Apple users who haven't updated to iOS 9 or higher and Samsung, Huawei, Sony and Google users who haven't updated to version 4.0 by February 1, 2020. The company also reported that Windows Phone operating systems would no longer be supported after December 31, 2019. WhatsApp was announced to be the 3rd most downloaded mobile app of the decade from 2010 to 2019. In early 2020, WhatsApp launched its \\"dark mode\\" for iPhone and Android devices – a new design consisting of a darker palette. In March, WhatsApp partnered with the World Health Organization and UNICEF to provide messaging hotlines for people to get information on the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic. That same month, WhatsApp began testing a feature to help users find out more information and context about information they receive.  2019 Lawsuit  In May 2019, WhatsApp was attacked by hackers who installed spyware on a number of victims' smartphones. The hack, allegedly developed by Israeli surveillance technology firm NSO Group, injected malware onto WhatsApp users’ phones via a remote-exploit bug in the app's Voice over IP calling functions. A Wired report noted the attack was able to inject malware via calls to the targeted phone, even if the user did not answer the call. On October 29, WhatsApp filed a lawsuit against NSO Group in a San Francisco court, claiming that the alleged cyberattack violated US laws including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). According to WhatsApp, the exploit \\"targeted at least 100 human-rights defenders, journalists and other members of civil society\\" among a total of 1,400 users in 20 countries.  SMB and Enterprise platforms  Until 2017, WhatsApp was for individual use between two smartphones. This enabled businesses to communicate with customers, but not at scale (e.g. in a contact center environment). In September 2017 WhatsApp confirmed rumors that they were building and testing two new tools for businesses: * A free WhatsApp Business app for small companies * An Enterprise Solution for bigger companies with global customer bases, such as airlines, e-commerce retailers and banks, who would be able to offer customer service and conversational commerce (e-commerce) via WhatsApp chat, using live agents or chatbots. (As far back as 2015, companies like Meteordesk had provided unofficial solutions for enterprises to attend to large numbers of users, but these were shut down by WhatsApp.)  Platform support  After months at beta stage, the official first release of WhatsApp launched in November 2009, exclusively at the App Store for iPhone. In January 2010, support for BlackBerry smartphones was added; and subsequently for Symbian OS in May 2010, and for Android OS in August 2010. In August 2011, a beta for Nokia's non-smartphone OS Series 40 was added. A month later, support for Windows Phone was added, followed by BlackBerry 10 in March 2013. In April 2015, support for Samsung's Tizen OS was added. Unofficial ports, Wazapp and Yappari, have also been released for the MeeGo-based Nokia N9 and the Maemo- based Nokia N900, respectively. The oldest device capable of running WhatsApp was the Symbian-based Nokia N95 released in March 2007. (As of June 2017, WhatsApp is no longer compatible with it.) In August 2014, WhatsApp released an Android update, adding support for Android Wear smartwatches. In 2014, an unofficial open source plug-in, whatsapp-purple, was released for Pidgin, implementing its XMPP and making it possible to use WhatsApp on PCs running Microsoft Windows and Linux. WhatsApp responded by blocking phone numbers that used the plug-in. On January 21, 2015, WhatsApp launched WhatsApp Web, a browser-based web client that could be used by syncing with a mobile device's connection. On February 26, 2016, WhatsApp announced they would cease support for BlackBerry (including BlackBerry 10), Series 40, and Symbian S60, as well as older versions of Android (2.2), Windows Phone (7.0), and iOS (6), by the end of 2016. BlackBerry, Series 40, and Symbian support was then extended to June 30, 2017. In June 2017, support for BlackBerry and Series 40 was once again extended until the end of 2017, while Symbian was dropped. Support for BlackBerry and older (version 8.0) Windows Phone and older (version 6) iOS devices was dropped on January 1, 2018, but was extended to December 2018 for Nokia Series 40. In July 2018, it was announced that WhatsApp would soon be available for KaiOS feature phones. In October 2019, WhatsApp officially launched a new fingerprint app-locking feature for Android users. = WhatsApp Web = WhatsApp was officially made available for PCs through a web client, under the name WhatsApp Web, in late January 2015 through an announcement made by Koum on his Facebook page: \\"Our web client is simply an extension of your phone: the web browser mirrors conversations and messages from your mobile device—this means all of your messages still live on your phone\\". The WhatsApp user's handset must still be connected to the Internet for the browser application to function. All major desktop browsers are supported except for Internet Explorer. WhatsApp Web's user interface is based on the default Android one and can be accessed through web.whatsapp.com. Access is granted after the users scan their personal QR code through their mobile WhatsApp application. As of January 21, 2015, the desktop version was only available to Android, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone users. Later on, it also added support for iOS, Nokia Series 40, and Nokia S60 (Symbian). An unofficial derivative called WhatsAppTime has been developed, which is a standard Win32 application for PCs and supports notifications through the Windows notification area. There are similar solutions for macOS, such as the open-source ChitChat. = Microsoft Windows and Mac = On May 10, 2016, the messaging service was introduced for both Microsoft Windows and macOS operating systems. WhatsApp currently does not allow audio or video calling from desktop operating systems. Similar to the WhatsApp Web format, the app, which will be synced with a user's mobile device, is available for download on the website. It supports OS versions of Windows 8 and OS X 10.10 and higher. = Apple iPad = A story circulated in 2019 that iPad support was coming. However, as of March 2020, WhatsApp does not run on the Apple iPad. From the WhatsApp iOS page (accessed March 2020): \\"WhatsApp is a telephony app, so iPod and iPad are not supported devices.\\" iPad users searching for WhatsApp are shown numerous third-party clients. Several top results have names and logos resembling WhatsApp itself, and some users do not realize they are using a third-party client. Unfortunately, using third-party clients runs the risk to the user of their phone number being permanently banned.  Technical  WhatsApp uses a customized version of the open standard Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).. Upon installation, it creates a user account using one's phone number as the username (Jabber ID: \`[phone number]@s.whatsapp.net\`). WhatsApp software automatically compares all the phone numbers from the device's address book with its central database of WhatsApp users to automatically add contacts to the user's WhatsApp contact list. Previously the Android and Nokia Series 40 versions used an MD5-hashed, reversed-version of the phone's IMEI as password, while the iOS version used the phone's Wi-Fi MAC address instead of IMEI. A 2012 update now generates a random password on the server side. Some Dual SIM devices may not be compatible with WhatsApp, though there are some workarounds for this. In February 2015, WhatsApp introduced a voice calling feature; this helped WhatsApp to attract a completely different segment of the user population. WhatsApp's voice codec is Opus, which uses the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) and linear predictive coding (LPC) audio compression algorithms. WhatsApp uses Opus at 816 kHz sampling rates. On November 14, 2016, Whatsapp added a video calling feature for users across Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone devices. In November 2017, Whatsapp released a new feature that would let its users delete messages sent by mistake within a time frame of 7 minutes. Multimedia messages are sent by uploading the image, audio or video to be sent to an HTTP server and then sending a link to the content along with its Base64 encoded thumbnail (if applicable). WhatsApp follows a \\"store and forward\\" mechanism for exchanging messages between two users. When a user sends a message, it first travels to the WhatsApp server where it is stored. Then the server repeatedly requests the receiver to acknowledge receipt of the message. As soon as the message is acknowledged, the server drops the message; it is no longer available in the database of the server. The WhatsApp server keeps the message only for 30 days in its database when it is not delivered (when the receiver is not active on WhatsApp for 30 days). = End-to-end encryption = On November 18, 2014, Open Whisper Systems announced a partnership with WhatsApp to provide end-to- end encryption by incorporating the encryption protocol used in Signal into each WhatsApp client platform. Open Whisper Systems said that they had already incorporated the protocol into the latest WhatsApp client for Android, and that support for other clients, group/media messages, and key verification would be coming soon after. WhatsApp confirmed the partnership to reporters, but there was no announcement or documentation about the encryption feature on the official website, and further requests for comment were declined. In April 2015, German magazine Heise Security used ARP spoofing to confirm that the protocol had been implemented for Android-to-Android messages, and that WhatsApp messages from or to iPhones running iOS were still not end-to-end encrypted. They expressed the concern that regular WhatsApp users still could not tell the difference between end-to-end encrypted messages and regular messages. On April 5, 2016, WhatsApp and Open Whisper Systems announced that they had finished adding end-to-end encryption to \\"every form of communication\\" on WhatsApp, and that users could now verify each other's keys. Users were also given the option to enable a trust on first use mechanism in order to be notified if a correspondent's key changes. According to a white paper that was released along with the announcement, WhatsApp messages are encrypted with the Signal Protocol. WhatsApp calls are encrypted with SRTP, and all client-server communications are \\"layered within a separate encrypted channel\\". The Signal Protocol library used by WhatsApp is open-source and published under the GPLv3 license. Cade Metz, writing in Wired, said, \\"WhatsApp, more than any company before it, has taken encryption to the masses.\\" = WhatsApp Payments = WhatsApp Payments is a peer-to-peer money transfer feature that is currently only available in India. WhatsApp has received permission from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to enter into partnership with multiple banks in July 2017 to allow users to make in-app payments and money transfers using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). UPI enables account-to-account transfers from a mobile app without having any details of the beneficiary's bank. This feature is being pilot tested with over a million users since April 2019, however there has not been any update on the final roll out. = WhatsApp Cryptocurrency = On February 28, 2019, The New York Times reported that Facebook was “hoping to succeed where Bitcoin failed” by developing an in-house cryptocurrency that would be incorporated into WhatsApp. The project reportedly involves over 50 engineers under the direction of former PayPal president David Marcus. This 'Facebook coin' will reportedly be a stablecoin pegged to the value of a basket of different foreign currencies. = Click to chat = You can directly start a WhatsApp converstation without having the phone number in your address book by opening a special link containing the phone number.  Reception and criticism  = Hoaxes and fake news = Mob murders in India In July 2018, WhatsApp encouraged people to report fraudulent or inciting messages after lynch mobs in India murdered innocent people because of malicious WhatsApp messages falsely accusing the victims of intending to abduct children. 2018 elections in Brazil In an investigation on the use of social media in politics, it was found that WhatsApp was being abused for the spread of fake news in the 2018 presidential elections in Brazil. Furthermore, it has been reported that US$3 million has been spent in illegal off-the-books contributions related to this practice. Researchers and journalists have called on WhatsApp parent company, Facebook, to adopt measures similar to those adopted in India and restrict the spread of hoaxes and fake news. = Security and privacy = WhatsApp was initially criticized for its lack of encryption, sending information as plaintext. Encryption was first added in May 2012. In 2016, WhatsApp was widely praised for the addition of end-to-end encryption and earned a 6 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's \\"Secure Messaging Scorecard\\". WhatsApp was criticized by security researchers and the Electronic Frontier Foundation for using backups that are not covered by end-to-end encryption and allow messages to be accessed by third-parties. In May 2019, a security vulnerability in WhatsApp was found and fixed that allowed a remote person to install spyware by making a call which did not need to be answered. In September 2019, WhatsApp was criticized for its implementation of a 'delete for everyone' feature. iOS users can elect to save media to their camera roll automatically. When a user deletes media for everyone, WhatsApp does not delete images saved in the iOS camera roll and so those users are able to keep the images. WhatsApp released a statement saying that \\"the feature is working properly,\\" and that images stored in the camera roll cannot be deleted due to Apple's security layers. In November 2019, WhatsApp released a new privacy feature that let users decide who adds them to the group. On December 17, 2019, WhatsApp fixed a security flaw that allowed cyber attackers to repeatedly crash the messaging application for all members of group chat, which could only be fixed by forcing the complete uninstall and reinstall of the app. The bug was discovered by Check Point in August 2019 and reported to WhatsApp. It was fixed in version 2.19.246 onwards. For security purposes, since February 1, 2020, WhatsApp has been made unavailable on smartphones using legacy operating systems like Android 2.3.7 or older and iPhone iOS 8 or older that are no longer updated by their providers. In April 2020, the NSO Group held its governmental clients accountable for the allegation of human rights abuses by WhatsApp. In its revelation via documents received from court, the group said that the mobile application periled to disregard its clients’ “national security and foreign policy concerns”. However, the company did not reveal names of the end users, which according to a research by Citizen Lab include, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. NHS In 2018, it was reported that around 500,000 National Health Service (NHS) staff used WhatsApp and other instant messaging systems at work and around 29,000 had faced disciplinary action for doing so. Higher usage was reported by frontline clinical staff to keep up with care needs, even though NHS trust policies do not permit their use. Mods and fake versions In March 2019, WhatsApp released a guide for users that had installed unofficial modified versions of WhatsApp and warned against data loss in case users persisted in using the same as it considered banning such users. NSO Group In October 2019, WhatsApp launched an unprecedented lawsuit against the Israeli surveillance firm NSO Group, accusing that it was behind the highly sophisticated cyber attacks on over 100 human rights activists, journalists, lawyers, and academics. WhatsApp also claimed that the firm violated American law in an “unmistakable pattern of abuse”. On July 16, 2020, a US federal judge ruled that WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook’s lawsuit against NSO group can proceed. The judge in his verdict invalidated most of the arguments made by the NSO group, which itched for a motion to dismiss the allegations in April. Jeff Bezos Phone Hack In January 2020, a digital forensic analysis revealed that the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos received an encrypted message on WhatsApp from the official account of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The message reportedly contained a malicious file, the receipt of which resulted in Bezos’ phone being hacked. The United Nations’ special rapporteur David Kaye and Agnes Callamard later confirmed that Jeff Bezos’ phone was hacked through WhatsApp, as he was one of the targets of Saudi's hit list of individuals close to The Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. = Terrorism = In December 2015, it was reported that Islamic State terrorists had been using WhatsApp to plot the November 2015 Paris attacks. ISIS also uses WhatsApp to traffic sex slaves. In March 2017, British Home Secretary Amber Rudd said encryption capabilities of messaging tools like WhatsApp are unacceptable, as news reported that Khalid Masood used the application several minutes before perpetrating the 2017 Westminster attack. Rudd publicly called for police and intelligence agencies to be given access to WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging services to prevent future terror attacks. In April 2017, the perpetrator of the Stockholm truck attack reportedly used WhatsApp to exchange messages with an ISIS supporter shortly before and after the incident. The messages involved discussing how to make an explosive device and a confession to the attack. In April 2017, nearly 300 Whatsapp groups of strength about 250 members each were reportedly being used to mobilize stone-pelters in Jammu and Kashmir to disrupt security forces' operations at encounter sites. According to police, 90% of these groups were closed down after counselling of admins of these groups. https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/300-whatsapp-groups-used-to- mobilise-stone-pelters-in-trouble-hit-kashmir-cop/story- LCHkmAFAh6FgNGAbfbbgDL.html Further, after a 6 months probe which involved infiltration of 79 of such Whatsapp groups, the National Investigation Agency reported that about of 6386 members and admins of these groups, about 1000 were residents of Pakistan and gulf nations. Further, for their help in negating anti-terror operations, the Indian stone pelters were getting funded through barter trade from Pakistan and other indirect means. https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-used-to-gather-stone-pelters- many-admins-abroad-nia-4828984/ = Scams and malware = It has been asserted that WhatsApp is plagued by scams that invite hackers to spread malicious viruses or malware. In May 2016, some WhatsApp users were reported to have been tricked into downloading a third-party application called WhatsApp Gold, which was part of a scam that infected the users' phones with malware. A message that promises to allow access to their WhatsApp friends' conversations, or their contact lists, has become the most popular hit against anyone who uses the application in Brazil. Since December 2016, more than 1.5 million people have clicked and lost money. Another application called GB Whatsapp is considered malicious by cybersecurity firm Symantec because it usually performs some unauthorized operations on end-user devices. = Bans =  China  WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, whose main social media service has been blocked in China since 2009. In September 2017, security researchers reported to The New York Times that the WhatsApp service had been completely blocked in China. According to Time, Sarsenbek Akaruli, 45, a veterinarian and trader from Ili, Xinjiang, was arrested in Xinjiang on November 2, 2017. As of November 2019, he is still in a detention camp. According to his wife Gulnur Kosdaulet, Akaruli was put in the camp after police found the banned messaging app WhatsApp on his cell phone. Kosdaulet, a citizen of neighboring Kazakhstan, has traveled to Xinjiang on four occasions to search for her husband but could not get help from friends in the Communist Party of China. Kosdaulet said of her friends, \\"Nobody wanted to risk being recorded on security cameras talking to me in case they ended up in the camps themselves.\\"  Iran  On May 9, 2014, the government of Iran announced that it had proposed to block the access to WhatsApp service to Iranian residents. \\"The reason for this is the assumption of WhatsApp by the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is an American Zionist,\\" said Abdolsamad Khorramabadi, head of the country's Committee on Internet Crimes. Subsequently, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani issued an order to the Ministry of ICT to stop filtering WhatsApp.  Turkey  Turkey temporarily banned WhatsApp in 2016, following the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey.  Brazil  On March 1, 2016, Diego Dzodan, Facebook's vice- president for Latin America was arrested in Brazil for not cooperating with an investigation in which WhatsApp conversations were requested. On March 2, 2016, at dawn the next day, Dzodan was released because the Court of Appeal held that the arrest was disproportionate and unreasonable. On May 2, 2016, mobile providers in Brazil were ordered to block WhatsApp for 72 hours for the service's second failure to cooperate with criminal court orders. Once again, the block was lifted following an appeal, after less than 24 hours. Brazil’s Central Bank issued an order to Visa and Mastercard on June 23, 2020 to stop working with WhatsApp on its new electronic payment system. A statement from the Bank asserted the decision to block the Facebook-owned company’s latest offering was taken in order to “preserve an adequate competitive environment” in the mobile payments space and to ensure “functioning of a payment system that’s interchangeable, fast, secure, transparent, open and cheap.”  Sri Lanka  WhatsApp, one of the most activated messaging apps along with other social media networks such as Facebook and Instagram were temporarily blocked, banned and had been unavailable for about two days (March 7–8, 2018) in certain parts of the country to eradicate communal violence, especially the anti-Muslim riots. This was probably the first such instance where social media platforms had been banned in Sri Lanka. The ban was finally lifted on March 14, 2018 around midnight time in Sri Lanka.  Uganda  The government of Uganda banned WhatsApp and Facebook, along with other social media platforms, to enforce a tax on the use of social media. Users are to be charged 200 shilling per day to access these services according to the new law set by parliament.  United Arab Emirates (UAE)  The United Arab Emirates banned WhatsApp video chat and VoIP call applications in as early as 2013 due to what is often reported as an effort to protect the commercial interests of their home grown nationally owned telecom providers (du and Etisalat). Their app ToTok has received press suggesting it is able to spy on users.  User statistics  WhatsApp handled ten billion messages per day in August 2012, growing from two billion in April 2012, and one billion the previous October. On June 13, 2013, WhatsApp announced that they had reached their new daily record by processing 27 billion messages. According to the Financial Times, WhatsApp \\"has done to SMS on mobile phones what Skype did to international calling on landlines\\". By April 22, 2014, WhatsApp had over 500 million monthly active users, 700 million photos and 100 million videos were being shared daily, and the messaging system was handling more than 10 billion messages each day. On August 24, 2014, Koum announced on his Twitter account that WhatsApp had over 600 million active users worldwide. At that point WhatsApp was adding about 25 million new users every month, or 833,000 active users per day. In May 2017, it was reported that WhatsApp users spend over 340 million minutes on video calls each day on the app. This is the equivalent of roughly 646 years of video calls per day. By February 2017, WhatsApp had over 1.2 billion users globally, reaching 1.5 billion monthly active users by the end of 2017. In January 2020, WhatsApp registers over 5 billion installs on Google Play Store making it only the second non-Google app to achieve this milestone. As of February 2020, WhatsApp had over 2 billion users globally. = Specific markets = India is by far WhatsApp's largest market in terms of total number of users. In May 2014, WhatsApp crossed 50 million monthly active users in India, which is also its largest country by the number of monthly active users, then 70 million in October 2014, making users in India 10% of WhatsApp's total user base. In February 2017, WhatsApp reached 200 million monthly active users in India. Israel is one of WhatsApp's strongest markets in terms of ubiquitous usage. According to Globes, already by 2013 the application was installed on 92% of all smartphones, with 86% of users reporting daily use. WhatsApp's group chat feature is reportedly used by many Israeli families to stay in contact with each other. = Competition = WhatsApp competes with a number of messaging services. They include services like iMessage (estimated 1.3 billion active users), WeChat (1.2 billion active users), Telegram (400 million users), Viber (260 million active users), and LINE (217 million active users). Telegram in particular was reported to get registration spikes during WhatsApp outages and controversies. WhatsApp has increasingly drawn its innovation from competing services, such as a Telegram- inspired web version and features for groups. In 2016, WhatsApp was accused of copying features from a then-unreleased version of iMessage.

It began operating in Australia in the late 19th century. There are currently 335 thrift stores and donation bins across Australia. History The first Salvation Army meeting in Australia was held in 1880. Edward Saunders and John Gore led the meeting from the back of a greengrocer's cart in Adelaide Botanic Park with an offer of food for those who had not eaten. In 1883, Major James Barker led the way to establish the first Salvation Army social institution anywhere in the world on a permanent basis, known as the \\"Prison Gate\\" program. Barker saw that prisoners being released from the Melbourne Gaol had nowhere to go and no work, so they inevitably re-offended and returned to gaol. Barker leased a small house in Lygon Street, Carlton, to provide accommodation for prisoners discharged from Melbourne's gaols. This led to the formation of the Prison-Gate Brigade, the members of which met discharged prisoners upon their release and offered them a home and the prospect of a job.http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/en/Who-We-Are/History-and- heritage/Foundation-of-Salvation-Army-social-services/ The Salvos also involved themselves in finding work for the unemployed and in re-uniting families. In Melbourne from 1897 to 1910, the Army's Limelight Department originally established in 1891, was Australia's first film production company. The Army set up Biorama companies with electric generators and projection equipment to travel around Australia, showing films produced by the Limelight Department along with other entertainments. Ninety-four cents in every dollar donated to The Salvation Army goes directly to those in need. It is thought that the name of the popular biscuit by Arnotts, SAO, stands for ‘Salvation Army Officer’.http://superbrands.com.au/index.php/salvation-army The Salvation Army helps more than one million Australians every year. In an average week, the Salvation Army provides an estimated: http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/Who- We-Are/About-Us/ *100,000 meals for the hungry *2,000 beds for the homeless *5,000 to 8,000 food vouchers *1,000 people with assistance in finding employment *Refuge to 500 victims of abuse *Assistance to 500 people addicted to drugs, alcohol or gambling *Several thousand people with counselling *3,000 elderly people with aged care services *1,000 people in the court system with chaplaincy services *Family tracing services which locate 40 missing family members From these diverse activities, The Salvos have grown to be one of Australia's most respected charitable organisations, with a 2009 survey by Sweeney Research and the advertising group Grey Global finding the Salvation Army and the nation's Ambulance Service to be Australia's most trusted entities. Australia's George Carpenter was General of the Salvation Army (worldwide leader) from 1939 to 1946 and Eva Burrows during the 1980s and 1990s.http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/AS10081b.htm On Friday 30 November 2018, General Brian Peddle announced that the two territories of Australia (The Salvation Army, Australian Eastern Territory and The Salvation Army, Australia Southern Territory) were again one territory, to be known as the Australia Territory. =Salvation Army growth, 19th century= The Salvation Army grew quickly within Australia, but it was a growth fraught with difficulty. In its early days The Salvation Army often met with suspicion, derision and violence. Salvationists simply walking down the streets would often suffer abuse and sustain injury from thrown objects. Several local councils even passed by-laws forbidding Salvation Army street processions, and the police were liable to arrest them. From 1881 to 1907, across the country, more than 100 Salvationists were fined or jailed for holding street-meetings and marches. Despite persecution and prosecution the number of Salvation Army Corps grew at an amazing rate, so much so that by 1900 there were over 1,300 Corps and outposts across Australia and New Zealand, and The Salvation Army in Australasia could boast the following statistics:http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/en/Who-We-Are/History-and- heritage/Church-Growth-in-Australia/http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/en/Who-We- Are/History-and-heritage/Opposition-and-acceptance-of-The-Salvation- Army/http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/en/Who-We-Are/History-and-heritage/20th- Century-overview/ *Officers & Cadets & Employees: 1929 *Soldiers (Members) estimated at 50,000 *Corps (Churches): 512 *Outposts: 858 *Training Homes: 2 *Women's Industrial Homes: 4 *Rescue Homes: 16 *Maternity Homes: 7 *Slum Posts & Women's Shelters: 5 *Prison-Gate Brigade Homes: 7 *Men's Shelters & Labour Yards: 6 *Men's Industrial Homes & Farms: 7 *League of Mercy: 4 *Military Home: 1 Australian sex abuse cases From the 1940s to the 1980s the Salvation Army in Australia sheltered approximately 30,000 children. In 2006 the Australian Salvation Army acknowledged that sexual abuse may have occurred during this time and issued an apology. In it, the Army explicitly rejected a claim, made by a party unnamed in the apology, that there were as many as 500 potential claimants. In 2013 it was reported that private settlements totalling 15.5 million had been made in Victoria relating to 474 abuse cases; a Salvation Army spokesman said that \\"This should not have happened and this was a breach of the trust placed in us\\" and that they were \\"deeply sorry\\" whilst claiming that the abuse was \\"the result of individuals and not a culture within the organisation.\\" On 28 January 2014, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, a royal commission of inquiry initiated in 2013 by the Australian Government and supported by all of its state governments, began an investigation into abuse cases at the Alkira Salvation Army Home for Boys at ; the Riverview Training Farm (also known as Endeavour Training Farm) at both in Queensland; the Bexley Boys’ Home at ; and the Gill Memorial Home at both in New South Wales. The investigation also examined The Salvation Army's processes in investigating, disciplining, removing and/or transferring anyone accused of, or found to have engaged in, child sexual abuse in these homes. On 27 March 2014, the Royal Commission began an investigation into the handling by The Salvation Army (Eastern Territory) of claims of child sexual abuse between 1993 and 2014. Many questions were raised during the course of the investigation as to whether high-ranking members of the organisation knew about these cases of child sexual abuse and failed to investigate, discipline, sack and prosecute sex offenders while boys and girls were beaten, bashed and raped.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/shining-the-spotlight-on- salvation-army-abuse/story-fni0cx12-1226810825660 The Royal Commission published a case study report on the findings and recommendations for one of the abovementioned case studies.

Several contemporary portraits of him are known.  Bishop of Freising  Philip defended the diocese of Freising successfully in the turmoil of the German Peasants' War. He managed to keep the Bavarian dukes out of the policy of the bishopric. He initiated many construction projects and is buried in the Freising Cathedral.  Bishop of Naumburg  In 1512, he was appointed Coadjutor of bishop John III of Naumburg. After John died, Philip was appointed Bishop of Naumburg as well. He stayed in Naumburg for ten months. After that, his primary residence was again in Freising, while Naumburg was mostly ruled by administrators. As he enjoyed the good will of the House of Wettin, he took a moderate attitude towards Martin Luther. After the death of Frederick III and the emerging resistance of the Naumburg and Zeitz citizenship, Philip moved to the Catholic camp and paid no more visits to Naumburg. He was tired of ruling and tried to find a successor to the bishopric of Naumburg.

The estate, with the original timber-framed manor house, was purchased by the Wilbrahams from the ancient Rode family in 1669. The medieval manor house was replaced between 1700 and 1708 by a brick-built seven-bay building; a second building, with five bays, was built in 1752; the two buildings being joined together in 1800 to form the present Rode Hall. Both the exterior and interior of Rode Hall have been altered multiples times, including work by Thomas Farnolls Pritchard and Lewis Wyatt, resulting in an irregular and complex layout. The house has large collections of period paintings, furniture, and porcelain by Chelsea, Bow and Royal Worcester. The house is Grade II* listed, and is surrounded by parkland and formal gardens, which are included as Grade II on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. On the site are a grotto, an ice house, and an ornamental obelisk, all Grade II listed structures. Rode Hall is still owned and occupied by the Wilbrahams, currently by the 8th Baronet, Sir Richard Baker Wilbraham, and his wife, Lady Anne Baker Wilbraham. The hall and gardens are open to the public from April to September. History The Rode Estate had been owned by the Rode family since at least the 14th century, when William de Rode bore arms for Edward II. The estate was purchased in 1669 by Roger Wilbraham for the sum of £2,400 (equivalent to £ in 2015), from his cousin Randle Rode. The Wilbrahams were prominent local landowners and descended from Sir Richard de Wilburgham, the Sheriff of Cheshire in the mid 13th century. The estate passed through the male line until 1900 when General Sir Richard Wilbraham died, leaving it to his only daughter Katherine. Katherine's husband, George Baker, assumed by royal licence the surname Wilbraham. In 1910, George succeeded to the Baker baronetcy on the death of his elder brother. Rode Hall consists of two houses, formerly separate, but later joined together. The older house was built for Randle Wilbraham in the early 18th century; it was recorded as being \\"recently completed\\" in 1708 and replaced an earlier timber-framed manor house, thought to have been similar to the nearby Little Moreton Hall. The second house was built for his grandson Randle Wilbraham III, a noted barrister, in 1752. The hall has been updated by successive generations, most notably in the early 1800s, when a bay was constructed to join the two houses, and in 1927, when the front portico was added. Rode Hall was opened to the public in 1980, by Sir Randle John Baker Wilbraham, 7th Baronet. Since then an extensive restoration has been performed with the assistance of English Heritage, including tackling an outbreak of dry rot in the late 1980s. In 1985, the house was designated Grade II* by English Heritage on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England; Grade II* buildings are particularly important buildings of more than special interest. Only 5.5% of listed buildings are Grade II*. Architecture An 1824 engraving of Rode Hall, taken from 'Views of the Seats, Mansions, Castles, Etc. of Noblemen and Gentlemen of England, Scotland and Ireland' by John Preston Neale =Exterior= The older part of the brick-built hall consists of seven bays, over two floors. There are projecting bays at either end of the building, dressed with ashlar quoins. A central doorway is flanked with plain pilasters, also of ashlar. The roof is of a hipped design, with a central octagonal bellcote, topped by a small dome. The newer building, constructed in 1752 under the guidance of architects William Hiorne and his brother David, consists of five bays, with a large bay at the side, constructed around 1800 to connect it to the older building. There is a central portico, with a flat roof supported by four ionic columns, added in 1927. The tripartite windows of the ground floor contrast with the French windows of the first floor, which are fronted by cast iron balconies. The attic floor has small 4 x 2 pane windows. The rear of the house consists of four bays, with a large central window on the first floor and a central door, surrounded with ashlar cornicing. Both sections of the house are constructed in red Flemish bond brick, which, until 1926, was covered with render. The design has received mixed reviews. Architectural historian David Watkin described the house as 'large, irregular and rather featureless' and of a 'dull design'. On the other hand, historian, archivist and Maltravers Herald Extraordinary John Martin Robinson, in The architecture of Northern England, noted the 'complex building history' of the hall, describing it as a 'substantial and elegant Georgian house'. In his early 19th century work 'Views of the Seats, Mansions, Castles, Etc. of Noblemen and Gentlemen of England, Scotland and Ireland', John Preston Neale noted that the house is 'large and handsome'. =Interior= The main family living quarters are located in the 1752 addition. The staircase hall is the only room in the 1752 house to have kept its original, Georgian interior. The rococo plaster ceiling is attributed to Shrewsbury-born architect, Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, who also designed interiors at Tatton Hall, Powis Castle and Croft Castle. Facing the gardens, on the north side of the house, is the library. Remodelled in the early 1800s, this room was previously used by the family as a dining room. It features fitted 19th-century mahogany bookcases, decorated with small acanthus friezes. The white marble fireplace is flanked on either side by family coats of arms. Connecting the library to the staircase hall and the drawing room is the ante-room, which is furnished with pieces commissioned by the family in the late 18th century. Originally, an entrance into the hall was located in this octagonal room, until Randle Wilbraham III relocated it. The room features copies of works by Raphael, attributed to Michelangelo Maestri. The dining room, originally the library, was designed by Lewis Wyatt in about 1808. Wyatt extended the room and added a shallow, semi-circular apse at one end. It features decorative plasterwork on both the ceiling and walls, but is largely unadorned. Wyatt implemented a design featuring gilded acanthus leaves and vines on the ceiling with large- scale egg-and-dart molding around the upper sections of the wall, scagiola columns and a black marble fireplace with bronze ornamentation. Wyatt's alteration works at Rode Hall are influenced by the style of Sir John Soane, and he described his designs for the interiors as an 'experiment in primitive simplicity ... At Rode the primitivist intent is emphasized by the total absence of an entablature.' The room is furnished with original pieces of furniture designed and made by the English manufacturer Gillows of Lancaster and London; of note is the mahogany dining-table and the semi-circular sideboard built into the apse. A Royal Crown Derby dinner service, purchased by Mary Wilbraham-Bootle for her son Randle Wilbraham III in 1809, is on display here. Grounds The grade II listed obelisk, overlooking the larger of the park's two artificial lakes The park, including 10 acres (4 ha) of gardens, are listed as Grade II on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens, and are promoted by the Campaign to Protect Rural England.Members Guide 2012, published by CPRE, 2012 While there is a description in a seventeenth-century survey, describing the 'orchards, gardens and courts within the Greene before the hall', there are no other known records of the gardens until 1790, when gardener Humphry Repton was commissioned to landscape the grounds. Repton's proposal was not implemented until 1803, when Richard Wilbraham III employed a John Webb to construct a new driveway, create two artificial lakes, the smaller one called Stew Pond and the one-mile long Rode Pool, and lay out a \\"Wild Garden\\". The gardens are still maintained by the current owner and his wife and have been recognised as a member of Cheshire's Gardens of Distinction. An Italian Garden was constructed in 2007 and contains olive and cypress trees. The garden's design was inspired by the Garden of Ninfa, an English-style garden outside of Rome which was planted under the guidance of Lady Constance Adela (Ada) Bootle-Wilbraham, a distant relative of the owners. =Kitchen garden= The 2-acre (1 ha) walled kitchen garden was built in the early 1700s to provide fruit and vegetables for the estate. The Victorian head gardener's cottage is built into the southern wall. Alongside the west wall is a private path, known as the Colonel's Walk, used by the family to bypass the kitchen garden on their way to church. There are traces of original chimneys built into the wall supporting espaliered fruit trees, located there in order to maintain an optimum temperature for year-round growth. One of these chimneys has been restored. The garden is still in use today and includes traditional and exotic varieties [of vegetables], and fruit bushes, some of which are used to make jams and chutneys for sale in the hall's tearooms. =Structures= The entrance to the Grotto Four structures in the grounds around the house are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as designated Grade II listed buildings; Grade II listing means that a building or structure is considered to be \\"nationally important and of special interest\\". The red-brick and rubble grotto was constructed in either the 18th or 19th century, and is built around a brick barrel vaulted tunnel, decorated internally with plasterwork and shells. The ice house is also in the garden and is built in brick and covered in earth. A tunnel-vaulted passage leads into a circular chamber with a domed roof. The obelisk is located on the edge of the larger of the two estate lakes, and is in sandstone with chamfered edges. It stands on a square plinth and is constructed in two sections; the upper section was added later. It was originally located at Kent Green, a nearby hamlet. The stable block was built in 1804 to the designs of one John Hope. As with the main house, the block is constructed in red Flemish-bond brickwork, with ashlar quoins and banding and a slate roof. Originally there were a number of open archways, several of which have since been bricked-up. The two central openings are topped with a stone pediment and the roof features an octagonal bellcote, with an ogee dome. =Mow Cop Castle= Mow Cop Castle is an elaborate, Gothic Revival folly, built two miles from Rode Hall, at Mow Cop, land previously belonging to the estate. Dating from 1754, the castle was built by Randle Wilbraham III and designed by the Hiorne brothers, the architects who worked on the 1752 improvements to the hall. It was constructed to improve the view across the valley from the hall. The family often used it as a summer house and for picnics. The castle fell into disrepair a number of times in the 19th century and several programmes of restoration were completed, including the replacement of the doors at a cost of £4 4s. The castle and surrounding land were sold by the Wilbrahams in 1923. The castle is renowned as the birthplace of Primitive Methodism, following a camp meeting there in 1807. Present day Rode Hall is still owned and occupied by the Wilbrahams, currently by the 8th Baronet, Sir Richard Baker Wilbraham, and his wife, Lady (Anne) Baker Wilbraham. The hall and gardens are open to the public from April to September, for an entrance fee. The tearooms, located in the 1752 section of the hall, use and sell the produce from the kitchen garden. Every month a farmers' market is held next to the kitchen garden.

He later pursued postgraduate education in ophthalmology and was admitted as a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. He was appointed as an associate professor at the National University of Singapore and became the medical director of Singapore National Eye Centre. He was also the chief executive of Singapore General Hospital. Prior to the commencement of his political career, he served as the commanding officer of the second Combat Support Hospital of the Singapore Armed Forces. His team was elected uncontested during his first and second candidacy for the Parliament at Holland–Bukit Panjang GRC and Holland–Bukit Timah GRC respectively. In the 2015 general election, Balakrishnan's team, including Liang Eng Hwa, Christopher de Souza and Sim Ann, defeated the opposing team from the Singapore Democratic Party with 66.62% of the votes. He joined the cabinet on 12 August 2004 when Lee Hsien Loong was sworn in as Singapore's 3rd Prime Minister. Early life Balakrishnan was born in 1961 to an Indian Tamil father and a Chinese mother with ancestry from Fuqing, Fujian. He had his primary and secondary education at Anglo-Chinese School, before going on to National Junior College. After graduating from junior college in 1980, he was awarded a President's Scholarship to study medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS). He served two terms as the president of the NUS Student Union, and later served as chairman of the union council. He chose a postgraduate specialisation in ophthalmology and became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1991. Medical career From 1993 to 1995, Balakrishnan worked at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London as a specialist senior registrar, where he subspecialised in paediatric ophthalmology. He later returned to Singapore, where he was appointed as a consultant ophthalmologist at the Singapore National Eye Centre and National University Hospital, and an associate professor of ophthalmology at the National University of Singapore in 1998. In 1999, he was appointed the medical director of the Singapore National Eye Centre, and later became chief executive officer of the Singapore General Hospital in 2000.

Early political career Balakrishnan's political career began at the 2001 general election, when he was part of the PAP's five-member team in the Holland–Bukit Panjang Group Representation Constituency (GRC), which was elected uncontested. In 2002, Balakrishnan was appointed a Minister of State at the Ministry of National Development, and the chairman of the Remaking Singapore Committee. Two years later, he became the Senior Minister of State at the Ministry of Trade and Industry.Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan profile . cabinet.gov.sg, April 2018. In office as full minister Balakrishnan speaks as Foreign Minister at the 2018 East Asia Summit Balakrishnan meets with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in May 2019 In 2004, Balakrishnan was made the Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports. He was made a full member of the Cabinet in 2005. At the 2006 general election, Balakrishnan was a PAP candidate in the Holland–Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency, and was elected in a walkover. During the time he was Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Balakrishnan raised the public assistance scheme from $260 for a single-person household in 2007, to $400 for a single-person household in 2011. In the 2011 general election, Balakrishnan's team, including Liang Eng Hwa, Christopher de Souza and Sim Ann, defeated the opposing team from Singapore Democratic Party with 60.1% of the votes. This was the first time since the seats for the constituency were contested since it was formed in 2001. During the political campaign running up to the 2011 elections, Balakrishnan said that the opposition candidates from the Singapore Democratic Party did not have any plans for the constituency, and their selection of Holland–Bukit Timah GRC was an opportunistic act. He suggested that they were trying to suppress a certain YouTube video featuring a member of the opposition team and that it raised questions about their agenda and motivation. It was later discovered that the video included opposition member Vincent Wijeysingha at a forum discussing issues surrounding gay rights and section 377A of the Penal Code in Singapore. The People's Action Party team issued a statement asking the opposition whether they were pursuing a \\"gay agenda\\". The opposition denied it, saying they were not pursuing the gay agenda and the issue was put to rest. The People's Action Party drew criticism from Internet users in Singapore for their election strategy. The opposition candidates raised the issue of government spending for the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, which Balakrishnan had overseen as the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, saying that the budget exceeded the initial estimates of SGD 104 million by over three times. Balakrishnan acknowledged that they had got the initial estimates wrong as it was the first time that an event of that scale was organized in Singapore. He asserted that the increased budget did not affect other programs of the ministry, and that seventy percent of the spending for the event went into paying local firms for their services. He declared that his team had spent less than the finalized budget amount and did not waste money. On 21 May 2011, Balakrishnan was appointed Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, taking over from Yaacob Ibrahim. After the 2015 General Elections, Balakrishnan was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs. Personal life He is married to Joy Balakrishnan, and they have a daughter and three sons. He is a Christian.

In one of the closest finishes ever seen in a league competition in Britain, Hearts played Kilmarnock at Tynecastle on the last day of the season, holding a two point lead over the Ayrshire club and a slightly better goal average.

Early life Bada was born on 4 December 1930. His father was the Baale, or viceroyal chieftain, of the Ago-Oba area of Abeokuta and the organist of the African Church, Ereko, Lagos, and Bada was brought up in this church. Bada attended St John’s School, Iloro, Ilesa (1936–1942) and Ilesha Grammar School (1943–1949). He began work with Nigerian Breweries in 1950 and was promoted to stock control supervisor in 1952. Church career In mid-1952 he met Superior Evangelist S. O. Ajanlekoko of the CCC, who profoundly influenced him. He left his job to work full-time for the church, becoming a Senior Elder in 1954, Leader in 1955, Senior Leader in December 1960 and Evangelist in 1964. On 24 December 1972 he became a Senior Evangelist, and on 25 December 1980 a Supreme Evangelist, the first person to attain this position which implied that he was next in rank to the pastor Samuel Oshoffa. When Oschoffa died on 10 September 1985 after a car crash without having defined a successor, several of his followers claimed the leadership, leading to a legal conflict that continued for many years. However, the Board of Trustees announced that Bada was the new Pastor and spiritual leader at the annual CCC convocation on 25 December 1985. He was formally installed on 25 December 1987 at the CCC world headquarters at Imeko City in Ogun State, Nigeria, and led the church for the next 15 years. Bada died on 8 September 2000 at Greenwich Hospital, London. His body was returned to Nigeria for burial on the 29th day of September, 2000 at Celestial City, Imeko. Governor Olusegun Osoba represented President Olusegun Obasanjo at the funeral ceremony. Bada was survived by his wives, children and grandchildren. He was succeeded by Philip Hunsu Ajose, who was appointed leader of the Church on 2 October 2000.

He had been the majority owner of Foresight Reserves LP, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. Regarded by Bloomberg as having been the \\"New King Coal\\", Cline was considered to have been responsible for reviving the Illinois coal industry. His company has more than three billion tons of coal reserves across Illinois and the Northern Appalachian Mountains. Early life Cline was born in Beckley, West Virginia, on July 5, 1958. Cline's father was Paul Cline. Cline's mother was Lassie Justice Cline. Cline's grandfather mined for coal with a pickaxe around Beckley, West Virginia, in the early 20th century. At the age of six, Cline's father, Paul, asked him to fill a paper bag with dirt, paying him a penny for each bag. Cline dug the dirt from under the porch of their bungalow in Isaban, West Virginia. His father used the dirt bags in mine-blasting. Within two years, their porch had collapsed. According to Cline, his father had told him to \\"support the roof better\\". In 1980, Cline's father bought out his partner then gave the shares to Cline, who was then 21 years old.  Education  Cline studied psychology at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia.  Career  = Coal mining business = In 1980 at age 22, Cline became an underground miner and founded his own energy development company, the Cline Group in 1990. In 2006 he organized Foresight Energy to manage his Illinois Basin coal rights. Foresight Energy went public in 2014 on the New York Stock Exchange.About, Foresight Energy, 2019 Cline sold off most of his share of Foresight in 2015, for $1.4 billion.Chris Cline Could Be The Last Coal Tycoon Standing, Christopher Helman, Forbes, December 19, 2017 Illinois holds a 250-year supply of coal, providing the state with the largest recoverable coal reserve in the United States. In 2017, the state consumed nearly $1.4 billion of coal, with coal mining operations located in 12 counties. However, Illinois coal has too much sulfur to be burned by most power plants because of pollution control requirements. Cline, who spent $300 million on mining rights and equipment in Illinois in the 1990s, had foreseen that the United States Environmental Protection Agency would require power plants to use scrubbers in removing pollutants, which would bring coal back into viability for electricity generation. In 2005, Cline Group built its Williamson longwall mining operation south of West Frankfort, Illinois. The company SNL Financial reported in 2008 that Deer Run coal mine in Montgomery County, Illinois, a project of Cline's Hillsboro Energy LLC, would produce up to eight million tons annually until 2016. In the same report, Cline's representatives stated he was aiming for an annual coal production of 60 million tons from his Illinois operations. Illinois environmental groups and landowners attempted to block Cline's coal mine operations, and also sought to draw attention to his local political contributions. Cline purchased a Nova Scotia metallurgical coal mine after selling off Foresight stock, as well as rights to coal reserves in Western Canada. Cline defended coal as a source of low-cost energy, saying in a 2010 interview \\"As far as the social acceptability of coal, I like to think I’m part of supplying the cheapest energy in America.\\" Philanthropy In May 2011, the School of Medicine and the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics of West Virginia University received a $5 million donation from Cline through his Cline Family Foundation. The donation created the Christopher Cline Chair in Orthopaedic Surgery and helped fund a new basketball practice facility. In July 2011, Marshall University received a donation of $5 million from the Cline Family Foundation for sports medicine research. Personal life Cline's first wife was Sabrina J. Holley Cline. They had a daughter, Candice. In September 1987, Cline's first wife died from breast cancer. She was 28 years old. In 1993, Cline married Kelly, his second wife. In 2000, Cline divorced Kelly Cline. Cline had two sons and two daughters, Christopher Logan Cline, Alex Tanner Cline, Kameron Cline, and Candice Cline. In 2011, Cline's daughter Candice, a director of a foundation, married James Graham Kenan. Cline owned a mansion in North Palm Beach, Florida, and a home in his native Beckley, West Virginia, with a property. Cline was a charter member of Brenton Southern Baptist Church.Billionaire Chris Cline dies in a helicopter crash near the Bahamas, governor says, CNN, Faith Karimi and Sheena Jones, July 5, 2019 Cline also had a relationship with Elin Nordegren, ex-wife of golfer Tiger Woods. =Mine Games= Cline owned two megayachts that he christened \\"Mine Games\\".

Following the death of his wife Louise in 2004, he began to make music as a way of coming to terms with the tragedy. His music, which uses a number of instruments – principally guitar and violin, has been compared with that of Arvo Pärt among others. His recordings explicitly reference places of emotional resonance, specifically the West Pennine Moors, and the area around the sparsely populated parish of Anglezarke. His album Landings has been compared with Brian Eno's Ambient 4: On Land in its evocation of place and memory. Skelton even goes so far as to include artefacts, such as twigs and alder catkins, from significant places in the packaging of his releases. Most of Skelton's releases have been issued by his own Sustain-Release label – under a range of pseudonyms including A Broken Consort, Carousell and Riftmusic, as well as under his own name – in small editions of CDs with hand-crafted packaging, and often including fragments of poetry. However, some of Skelton's work has attained wider commercial and critical success. In 2011, Skelton archived the material he had released on Sustain-Release. A box set of his complete recordings to date, titled *SKURA and totalling 20 discs of music, followed. Skelton announced that future editions of both his music and writing would be released on the Corbel Stone Press imprint. The first release was Wolf Notes, a collaboration with his new partner, Autumn Richardson, under the name *AR. The album was released on 1 January 2011. To date, a number of print works and another musical collaboration with Richardson, Stray Birds, have been issued. Two more music works are scheduled for release in mid-2012.

Social and political issues, both foreign and domestic, were discussed by a regular panel, including university professors, publishers, and retired military officers. Overview Series regulars included the hosts Hardy Burt and Devin Garrity, a publisher with his family- owned Devin-Adair Company,Alex McNeil, Total Television, p. 53 journalist William F. Buckley, Jr. (prior to his establishment of National Review magazine), professors John K. Norton of Columbia University and Charles Hughes of New York University, and Frank L. Howley, a general in World War II, who at the time was the NYU vice chancellor. Topics on Answers for Americans were taken from the conservative publication Facts Forum, originally subsidized by the Dallas oil billionaire, H. L. Hunt, with steady contributions from commentator Dan Smoot, a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later set out to expose communist infiltration in the United States government. Facts Forum presented conflicting sides of issues, but it increasingly criticized the liberal and moderate positions of both Democrats and Republicans. Its programs were among the first to present conservative ideology to television viewers. Prior to the establishment of the John Birch Society and the rise of U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona as a conservative spokesman and the 1964 Republican presidential nominee, Facts Forum attempted to merge 1930's isolationism, particularly prominent in the Middle West, with the aggressive anti-communism of the Cold War era. Other topics discussed on Answers for Americans were \\"Is Academic Freedom in Jeopardy?\\", with conservative Professor Russell Kirk, and \\"What Next for Formosa?\\", with Tsiang Tingfu, the UN representative from Taiwan. Other journalists who appeared were investigative reporter Ralph de Toledano, then with Newsweek magazine, and Godfrey Smith. Selected subjects presented were \\"Where Does the Eisenhower Administration Stand Today?\\", \\"Should Red China Be Admitted to the United Nations?\\", a determination ultimately made in China's favor in 1971, with the corresponding expulsion of Nationalist China from the world organization, and \\"What Can Be Done About Korea?\\", an examination of the divided North and South Korea, which aired some six months after the negotiation of the cease-fire ending the Korean War.

He was convicted by a TADA court in a 1993 Delhi bomb blast case that left nine people dead and injured 31. The Indian supreme court had confirmed his death sentence in a fractured and divided decision. His death sentence has been commuted to life imprisonment by the Supreme Court of India on 31 March 2014. A chemical engineering professor by profession, he taught in Ludhiana before his conviction for a bomb blast in Delhi. He was declared guilty—under India's Terrorism and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), of killing nine bystanders in a 1993 car bombing intended to kill politician Maninderjeet Singh Bitta, and sentenced to death by hanging by a split decision. The Supreme Court of India commuted his death sentence to life Imprisonment on 31 March 2014, both on the ground of an unexplained and inordinate delay of eight years in deciding his mercy petition and on the ground of mental illness. Crime On 11 September 1993, a car bomb exploded outside the offices of the Indian Youth Congress on Raisina Road in New Delhi, killing nine people. The remote-controlled bomb used RDX as explosive. The primary target for the mid-day bombing was identified as Maninder Singh Bitta, a vocal critic of Khalistani separatists, who was leaving the Youth Congress offices in his car. Bitta survived the attack with shrapnel wounds to his chest. However, two of Bitta's body guards were killed. After investigation, authorities named Bhullar as the bomber responsible for the 1993 Raisina Road car bomb. Bhullar's sympathizers argue that he was targeted solely for supporting the Khalistani separatist cause and for speaking out against injustices in Punjab during the 1980s, in particular students missing after police encounters, Operation Woodrose and the 1984 riots. The prosecution claimed that he was part of the proscribed separatist organization, Khalistan Liberation Force. However, his family and friends deny this claim.http://www.indianexpress.com/news/ludhiana-college-remembers-a-quiet- village-boy-with-no-leadership-qualities/1104243/ In the appellate stage of the trial he was found guilty by a majority of 2-1. The two judges who upheld the death sentence have found his confession admissible. The dissenting Judge, presiding judge of the three-judge bench, however, acquitted the accused, finding that he was not guilty of participating in the 1993 car bomb attack and too much doubt remained on the authenticity of the alleged confession to the Punjab police. However, the other two judges convicted him, arguing that proof \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\" should be a \\"guideline, not a fetish\\". Bhullar was named responsible based on his confession; but the defense claims that it was taken under duress. Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar has gone in appeal over the judgement of the trial court and his conviction was upheld at all the stages. Finally, a Presidential pardon was sought by him and granted on ground of inordinate delay in deciding his mercy petition and his suffering from schizophrenia. Flight to Germany and attempted asylum After the bombing, Bhullar fled to Germany in December 1994 and sought political asylum. His plea was rejected by the German government in 1995 and he was extradited back to India to face charges of terrorism although on the basis of Bhullar receiving a fair trial and not being subjected to capital punishment. Upon his return to India in 1995, Bhullar was immediately arrested and prosecuted for alleged bombings in Delhi. He was treated as a terrorist and prosecuted under the Terrorism & Disruptive Activities Act (TADA). Bhullar has been in prison on death row for the last two decades since being arrested upon arrival after being deported to India.http://www.hindustantimes.com/India- news/NewDelhi/Germany-regretted-deporting-Bhullar/Article1-1044424.aspx Confession On being handed over to the Indian police in Delhi by airline staff, Bhullar was taken into detention. The police alleged that he volunteered a confession, which was typed on a computer while Bhullar spoke but according to the authorities the secretary forgot to save the confession on the computer. Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act requires the confession to be handwritten or an audio/video record of it to be kept. The authenticity of typed confessions is doubted in the courts. Court proceedings In India, Bhullar was prosecuted for the 1993 New Delhi car bombing. He was found guilty by the trial court and sentenced to death by hanging on 25 August 2001. The rest of the accused have been acquitted. Bhullar was then taken before an ‘executive’ magistrate. Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act requires the confession document be sent to the magistrate before appearance of the person so that the magistrate is in a position to examine it. The confession document was not sent to the magistrate nevertheless the magistrate went on to ask him if he had made the confession. Bhullar wrote to the court that the ‘confession’ was involuntary and obtained under torture and fear of death. In a 2002 review of the trial, an appeals court upheld Bhullar's death sentence by a split verdict of 2–1. The presiding judge voted to overturn the death penalty on Bhullar, because the testimony of the prosecution witnesses had been at odds with the account of events in Bhullar's self-confession. However, the other judges upheld the death penalty because Bhullar's confession had not been sent to the trial magistrate, it was not the basis for the conviction and Bhullar had withdrawn his confession. While he was waiting for the death sentence, Bhullar was convicted of other charges by the Punjab Police. However, on 1 December 2006 in the Chandigarh and Haryana High Court the judge acquitted Bhullar on the basis of lack of evidence. R.S. Baswana Additional Sessions Judge held that there was no evidence on file to link the accused with the other alleged crimes and despite the fact that the prosecution had 15 years to gather evidence against Bhullar, they were unable to produce evidence linking Mr Bhullar to the case against him. He had filed a review petition, which was also dismissed on 17 December 2002. Bhullar had then moved a curative petition, which too had been rejected by the Supreme Court on 12 March 2003. Bhullar's appeal against the conviction was dismissed by the Supreme Court of India on 27 December 2006. His plea for clemency was rejected by the President of India in May 2011. In September 2011, the Supreme Court allowed Bhullar to file an unprecedented second appeal against the death sentence. The amendment to the appeal will argue that Bhullar's first appeal against the death sentence should have been heard by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, rather than a Trial Bench. Additional pleas in the appeal will include the arguments that Bhullar's death sentence had been upheld by a 2–1 split verdict and that Bhullar was mentally ill due to the delay in his execution. The appeal will hence request that his death sentence be commuted to life in prison. In April 2013, the Supreme Court upheld his death penalty after considering a mercy plea. The writ petition which was filed in Supreme Court of India in April 2013 was only against the plea that delay in execution of death sentence should be a ground for converting death sentence into life imprisonment. The Supreme Court rejected the plea in April 2013, by holding that in terror crime cases pleas of delay in execution of death sentence cannot be a mitigating factor. In 2005, Bhullar wrote to the German chancellor to put diplomatic pressure on Indian Government to release him. Bhullar Letter to German Authorities. The letter was later made public. Bhullar appealed against his execution on the grounds that his petition for mercy was kept pending by the President of the country for eight years, an unnecessary delay. On 31 January 2014, the Supreme Court of India issued notice to Central Government on Bhullar's curative plea seeking commuting his death sentence to life imprisonment. The plea was on the grounds of inordinate delay in deciding his mercy plea by the President and his mental health. On 31 March 2014, a bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice P Sathasivam, commuted Bhullar's death sentence to life Imprisonment on the grounds of inordinate delay in deciding his mercy petition and his suffering from schizophrenia.

Since a mole of calcium carbonate weighs 100.09 grams, 1 dKH is equivalent to 0.17832 mmol per litre. dKH are the same as °fH, degrees of French hardness.

The first aircraft carrier commissioned into the People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force, she was originally classified as a training ship, intended to allow the Navy to experiment, train and gain familiarity with aircraft carrier operations. Following upgrades and additional training in late 2018, Chinese state media announced that the ship would shift to a combat role in 2019. Originally laid down in 1985 for the Soviet Navy as the aircraft cruiser Riga, she was launched on 4 December 1988 and renamed Varyag in 1990. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, construction was halted and the ship was put up for sale by Ukraine. The stripped hulk was purchased in 1998 and towed to the Dalian naval shipyard in northeast China. The ship was rebuilt and commissioned into the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) as Liaoning on 25 September 2012. Its Chinese ship class designation is Type 001. In November 2016, the political commissar of Liaoning, Commodore Li Dongyou, stated that Liaoning was combat ready. Classification The Kuznetsov-class ships were originally designated by the Soviet Navy as \\"\\" (tyazholiy avianesushchiy kreyser, TAKR or TAVKR), meaning \\"heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser\\". In addition to aircraft, the ships were designed to carry P-700 Granit anti-ship cruise missiles that also form the main armament of the s. This multirole capability allowed the ships to avoid classification as aircraft carriers, thus allowing them to pass through the Turkish Straits between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Under the Montreux Convention, aircraft carriers larger than 15,000 tons are not permitted to pass through the Straits, but there is no displacement limit on other types of capital ship from Black Sea powers.14 San Diego L. Rev. 681 (1976–1977) Kiev and the Montreux Convention: The Aircraft Carrier That Became a Cruiser to Squeeze through the Turkish Straits; Froman, F. David In contrast, the People's Liberation Army Navy considers Liaoning to be an aircraft carrier. Since China is not located on the Black Sea and thus not considered a Black Sea power under the Montreux Convention, it does not need and cannot use the tonnage exemption for non- aircraft carrier capital ships. The ship was completed as an aircraft carrier, and cruise missiles were never installed. Liaoning is equipped only with air defence weapons and must use its aircraft for surface attack. History =Origin= The ship was laid down as Riga at Shipyard 444 (now Mykolaiv South) in Mykolaiv, Ukrainian SSR, on 6 December 1985. Design work was undertaken by the Nevskoye Planning and Design Bureau. Launched on 4 December 1988, the carrier was renamed Varyag in late 1990, after a previous similarly- named cruiser launched in 1899. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the ship was only 68% complete. Construction was halted, and the ship was put up for sale. The name Varyag was then adopted by another cruiser launched in 1983. =Sale= Ukraine approached China, India, and Russia as potential buyers. China sent a high-level delegation in 1992, which reported that the ship was in good condition and recommended a purchase. However, the Chinese government declined to purchase the ship because of the international diplomatic situation at the time. Unable to find a buyer, Ukraine left the ship to deteriorate in the elements. In 1998, the rusting hulk was sold at auction for $20 million to Agencia Turistica E Diversoes Chong Lot Limitada, a company from Macau. Chong Lot proposed to tow Varyag to Macau, where the ship would be converted into a $200 million floating hotel and casino. Western observers were suspicious, since Chong Lot had no listed telephone number, was not located at its listed address, and was run by former officers in the Chinese Navy. Officials in Macau also denied Chong Lot's application to operate a casino. However, analysts noted that Varyag had deteriorated too much to be used as an operational warship and pointed out that the Chinese Navy was concentrating on submarines. The Soviet carriers and had also been sold to China as tourist attractions. In January 2015, further details emerged in an interview with Hong Kong-based businessman Xu Zengping by the South China Morning Post. Xu, a former military basketball player, reported that he had been commissioned by the PLAN to purchase the vessel on its behalf, with the floating hotel and casino as a cover story. He was warned that the Chinese Navy did not have the budget to buy the ship, and the Chinese government did not support the purchase. However, Xu was so impressed when touring the ship that he resolved to purchase it using his personal funds. The previous year, Xu had borrowed HK$230 million from a Hong Kong business friend, spending HK$6 million to create Chong Lot as a Macau shell corporation. He described a harrowing negotiation in Kiev, lubricated by bribery and liquor, which helped to arrange victory at the auction. As a precaution, he shipped 40 tonnes of the carrier's blueprints to China overland in eight trucks. =Transfer to China= Ex-Varyag under tow in Istanbul in 2001 The passage from Ukraine to China was even more troublesome than the purchase. In June 2000, Varyag was taken under tow. As the tugboat approached the Bosphorus, Turkey denied permission for the ship to pass through, citing the risk that a gust of wind would turn the ship widthwise and block the entire strait. Varyag spent the next 16 months being towed around the Black Sea, accruing towing charges of $8,500 a day as Chong Lot stopped paying its bills. The tugboat operator compared its fate to the Yellow Fleet that was stuck in the Suez Canal for eight years, and French thrillseekers even landed a helicopter on the ship. Meanwhile, Chinese officials negotiated with Turkey, offering trade and tourism concessions. In August 2001, Turkey relented and agreed to allow the ship to pass. On 1 November 2001, the Bosphorus was cleared of all other traffic as Varyag was towed through. On 2 November, Varyag also passed through the Dardanelles without incident. On 4 November, Varyag was caught in a force 10 gale and broke adrift while passing the Greek island of Skyros. The ship was taken back under tow on 6 November, after one sailor died while attempting to attach the tow lines. The Suez Canal does not permit passage of \\"dead\\" ships – those without an on-board power source – so the hulk was towed through the Strait of Gibraltar, around the Cape of Good Hope, and through the Straits of Malacca at an average speed of across the journey. The tugboat fleet called for supplies en route at Piraeus, Greece; Las Palmas, Canary Islands; Maputo, Mozambique; and Singapore. Varyag entered Chinese waters on 20 February 2002, and arrived 3 March at the Dalian naval shipyard in northeast China. The costs included $25 million to the Ukrainian government for the hull, nearly $500,000 in transit fees and $5 million for 20 months of towing fees. Xu Zengping estimated in 2015 that his total out of pocket cost was at least US$120 million. He insisted that he had never been reimbursed by the Chinese government, and had spent the last 18 years repaying his debts, in part by selling properties such as his home. A source familiar with the acquisition explained that the naval official, Ji Shengde, who initiated the mission had been in prison because of smuggling. Contrary to initial reports that the ship had no engines, Xu reported that all four original engines remained intact at the time of purchase, but had been shut down and preserved in grease seals. A refit restored them to working order in 2011. =Modernization and refit= 701st Institute was tasked to redesign Varyag with Zhu Yingfu (朱英富) and Wu Xiaoguang (吴晓光) were assigned respectively as the general designer and deputy general designer. Wang Zhiguo (王治国) was assigned as the general system engineer, and Yang Lei (杨雷) was assigned the general supervisor. The workload of converting Varyag for operational use was equivalent to building ten new destroyers. Varyag was moved in June 2005 to a dry dock at Dalian (). Her hull was sandblasted, scaffolding erected, and the ship's island was painted in a red marine primer to treat metal corrosion. Liaoning at Dalian, China Observers have noted the installation of Type 348 active electronically scanned array (AESA) Radar (four arrays) and Sea Eagle radar. The air defence system consists of the Type 1130 CIWS and the HQ-10 missile system. The anti- ship missile tubes would not be used, freeing up internal space for hangar or storage use. Russia has explored similar modifications to her sister ship Admiral Kuznetsov. On 8 June 2011, General Chen Bingde made the first public acknowledgement of the ship's refit. On 27 July 2011, the Chinese Defence Ministry announced it was refitting the vessel for \\"scientific research, experiment and training\\". In 2018, Asia Times reported that Sun Bo (executive), a general manager of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, had allegedly passed on technical details of the Liaoning to the Central Intelligence Agency. Sun was a general manager at the Dalian shipyard where the ship's refurbishment was done. =Sea trials and handover= The ship undertook her first sea trials from 10 August 2011 to 15 August 2011. On 29 November 2011 the carrier left port for her second set of trials. The carrier completed her eighth sea trial between 7 and 21 June 2012 and returned to Dalian. In July 2012, the ship set out for the longest trials thus far, 25 days. The carrier completed sea trials in early August 2012 and loaded Shenyang J-15 aircraft and KJ-88, YJ-83K and YJ-91 missiles in preparation for weapons systems trials. During sea trials, Liaoning experienced a steam burst in the engine compartment which forced crew to evacuate some parts of the ship, and the ship lost power. The problem was ultimately resolved and power was restored, although the time duration of the problem has not been released by military officials. On 23 September 2012, the aircraft carrier was handed over to the PLAN, and was commissioned on 25 September 2012. At the commissioning ceremony, the carrier was officially named Liaoning, in honour of the province in which she was retrofitted. On 26 December 2012, the People's Daily reported that it would take four to five years for Liaoning to reach full capacity. As it was a training ship until 2018, Liaoning was not assigned to any of China's operational fleets. According to geopolitical analysts, China could use Liaoning and its future carriers to intimidate other smaller countries that have territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as extending air control further south of the disputed region. In December 2016 the ship exercised in the Western Pacific, including passing through the Miyako Strait between the Japanese islands of Miyako-jima and Okinawa. On 18 April 2018, Liaoning took part in the navy's live-fire exercises in the South China Sea, involving 76 fighter jets and 48 warships and submarines. The drills came after a large military display presided over by Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping, and were condemned by Taiwan as \\"military intimidation\\". In August 2018, South China Morning Post reported that Liaoning was berthed at Dalian undergoing its first refit since its commissioning in 2012. The radar above Liaoning's bridge and the air traffic control at the rear of the island superstructure was noted to have been removed, and scaffolding was also noted around the command centre. On 21 January 2019, state-run tabloid Global Times reported that Liaoning had completed maintenance and modifications which lasted more than half a year, and had departed Dalian for a possible sea trial in the north Yellow Sea near Dalian, noting that changes were made to the superstructure. Aircraft handling On 4 November 2012, the People's Liberation Army's website () reported that Shenyang J-15s had performed carrier touch-and-go training. On 25 November 2012, China announced that J-15s had made five successful arrested landings on Liaoning. In June 2013, a second round of flight tests began on board Liaoning, with personnel from the fleet air arm of the Brazilian Navy providing carrier training support to the People's Liberation Army Navy Air Force who operate the J-15s. In August 2014, based on an article from Chinese state media, Western news outlets reported that two pilots had been killed testing jets slated to operate from Liaoning. Chinese military officials stated such reports were misleading, and clarified that deaths were in fact unrelated with tests on the carrier. The original Chinese article from Xinhua also did not link the deaths with the J-15 nor mention any loss of such aircraft. In August 2014, the Chinese- language Shanghai Morning Post listed that Liaoning would carry 36 aircraft: 24 Shenyang J-15 fighters, six Changhe Z-18F anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, four Changhe Z-18J airborne early warning helicopters and two Harbin Z-9C rescue helicopters. The Chinese carrier aircraft inventory is similar to a balanced combat and support aircraft approach intended for Soviet aircraft carriers, which supported nuclear submarines, large surface combatants, and land-based strike bombers performing anti-access roles. The air wing lacks long-range radar and anti-submarine fixed-wing aircraft, needing support from shore-based aircraft such as Tupolev Tu-154 ASW and Shaanxi Y-8 AWACS aircraft. The U.S. Department of Defense noted that J-15s will have below normal range and armament when operating from the carrier, due to limits imposed by the ski-jump takeoff system. The lack of a carrier onboard delivery aircraft like the United States Navy (USN) Grumman C-2 Greyhound also limits logistics capabilities. Liaoning would need extensive land-based support to oppose a USN carrier strike group; however, it would be potent against the Vietnam People's Navy and the Philippine Navy. Deficiencies will likely be corrected with future aircraft carriers, which are expected to be larger with conventional takeoff decks and catapult launching for heavier fighters, plus fixed-wing radar and anti-submarine patrol aircraft.

Many of his wartime talks appeared also in print. He was widely known simply as \\"Mr. Middleton\\".Daniel Smith (2011) The Spade as Mighty as the Sword Background Middleton was born in Weston by Weedon, Northamptonshire on 22 February 1886. Gardening was the family trade. Middleton was the son of John Robert Middleton, who was employed as head gardener at Weston Hall by Sir George Sitwell, father of the talented trio of Edith, Osbert and Sacheverell, all of whom Cecil Middleton came to know well as a child, probably as a playmate.Leslie Geddes Brown in Country Life, 20 March 2013 (reviewing Ursula Buchan, A Green and Pleasant Land) On his marriage certificate on 10 August 1912 in London to Rosa Annie Jenkins, Middelton was listed as a Horticultural Instructor.London Metropolitan Archives, Saint Mark, Myddleton Square, Register of Marriages, P76/MRK, Item 029 He left Northampton to work first in the seed trade, then spent time as a student at Kew Gardens.Jennifer Davies, The Wartime Kitchen and Garden, BBC books, 1993, p.43 Broadcaster and wartime fame =In Your Garden and Dig for Victory= Middleton's broadcasting career began when Colonel Frank Rogers Durham (1872–1947), Secretary of the Royal Horticultural Society, recommended him to the BBC for radio talks.Miles Hadfield (1960) A History of British Gardening Others considered for the role had included the seasoned broadcaster Vita Sackville-West who, in the coming years, created a world-famous garden at Sissinghurst.Joe Moran (2013) Armchair Nation: An intimate history of Britain in front of the TV Middelton's first programme was on 9 May 1931 and, from 1934 onwards, he broadcast regularly on Sunday afternoons at 2.15 p.m. a series of gardening talks entitled In Your Garden.Vita Sackville-West later used this as the title of her famous weekly column in The Observer. These talks continued until 1939 when the BBC and Ministry of Agriculture extended the series to include topical advice about what became the \\"Dig For Victory\\"An enduring phrase that appears to have originated with the future leader of the British Labour Party, Michael Foot, who was working on the London Evening Standard in the early years of the war: see Smith (2011) The Spade as Mighty as the Sword campaign and launched the complementary Kitchen Front programme. By 1940, 3.5 million listeners were tuning in to hear Middleton's 15 minute talks from the BBC's studios at Evesham (the corporation having dispersed or evacuated many of its departments in wartime). These broadcasts, which were extremely successful and listened to both by practical gardeners and those who \\"only dreamed of gardening\\", were published in book form during World War II and have since been reprinted. Hs innate humour, which he deployed when allowed to do so, once led him to remark (with reference to the consequences of German bombing) on the availability of mortar rubble for liming soil. In 1942 research into listening habits suggested that over 70% of people in Britain with wireless sets listened to advice about gardening; of these, almost 80% referred specifically to In Your Garden, which was far and away the best known programme dealing with the subject. When the Allotments Bill was debated in Parliament in 1950, the Minister of Agriculture Tom Williams recalled that \\"until his death [in 1945], Mr. Middleton stimulated and encouraged us all by his avuncular advice every Sunday after lunch\\".Quoted in Daniel Smith (2011) The Spade as Mighty as the Sword In addition to giving practical advice, Middleton was unafraid to confront issues of public policy: for example, as early as 1940, he was concerned that the Dig for Victory campaign was focused too much on urban areas, thus tending to overlook the contribution of rural gardeners who often had more space available, with the potential for greater yields. He was also comparatively adventurous for his time, for example, advising listeners in 1940 to sow a row of garlic. However, although his influence on wartime food cultivation was considerable, Middleton's personal passion was for flowers, one colleague later remarking that \\"he could not love an onion where a dahlia might grow\\".Unnamed Daily Express colleague quoted in Daniel Smith (2011) The Spade as Mighty as the Sword =Early television= Television gardening broadcasts began on 21 November 1936 when Middleton presented In Your Garden from a purpose-built plot at Alexandra Palace in the first month of the BBC's official television service. Such was Middelton's fame, even at this stage, that a comic actor, Nelson Keys, dressed in a mangy coat, impersonated him on television, making such irreverent observations as \\"the thistles are doing nicely today\\".Moran, op.cit. At the annual Radiolympia exhibition in August 1939,At the Olympia exhibition hall in Kensington, London. just before the outbreak of war, Middleton appeared in 'Television Avenue', tending a replica of the garden at Alexandra Palace, of which there was also a sixty-five-foot high model.Moran, op.cit. At Radiolympia in 1938 Middleton gave a presentation entitled 'In the Garden', for which he was assisted by BBC announcer Elizabeth Cowell. After the suspension of television the following month, Middleton never used that medium again.Middleton had died by the time the network resumed in 1946. =Relationship with the BBC= Despite his evident popularity, Middleton's relationship with the BBC was sometimes a little strained and he was treated with a degree of meanness and condescension. For example, during a spell of bronchitis, when his talks had to be relayed by an announcer, his fee was reduced and, after his home was bombed in 1940, obliging him to live with relatives in Northamptonshire, his claim for additional travelling costs was dismissed in an internal memorandum as \\"grabbing\\". He was also prevented from appearing on the rather highbrow discussion programme The Brains Trust on the basis that \\"he is an amateur expert\\". Even so, towards the end of the war, the corporation acknowledged the importance of his contribution: > Special series of talks for 'back-yarders' have ... for four years guided a > new national movement towards self-sufficiency; it would be hard to write a > social history of the war years without mentioning Mr. Middleton.John Green > (BBC Talks Department) in BBC Year Book 1945 =Other work= Middleton wrote for the Daily Express and was also an advisor and writer for publications by Boots stores, which promoted itself as 'The Gardener's Chemist'.Twigs Way & Mike Brown, Digging for Victory: Gardens and Gardening in Wartime Britain, Sabrestorm, 2011, p. 15 and 84 He also appeared in British Pathe Newsreels.British Pathe Newsreel, 1944 Film ID 1289.04 Other films included Ministry of Information film shorts such as Blitz on Bugs as a voice or in animated cartoon form.Twigs Way & Mike Brown, Digging for Victory: Gardens and Gardening in Wartime Britain, Sabrestorm, 2011, p. 79 Death and legacy Middleton died of a heart attack outside his house at Princes Villa, Surbiton on 18 September 1945. Warm tributes were paid to him and flowers were sent to his funeral from all over Britain, although an obituary in the Daily Express noted that, ironically, his own front garden was noticeably unkempt. Middleton is remembered in the allotment gates of the Weston and Lois Weedon Horticultural Society, Northants, where he was a founder member in 1940. This Society still remembers him at their annual horticultural shows, as he did much to promote the horticultural shows and societies continuing in wartime. Middleton was the first in a long line of British \\"celebrity\\" gardeners,See, for example, D.G. Hessayon (1983) The Armchair Book of the Garden. from Percy Thrower to Geoff Hamilton and Alan Titchmarsh, who became famous through radio or television.Even in 2000, 55 years after his death, Middleton was ranked 9th (immediately below Gertrude Jekyll and Charles, Prince of Wales) in a poll of readers of Amateur Gardening Magazine who voted for their \\"Gardener of the Millennium\\": see Vicky Bamforth (ed. 2004) The Gardener's Companion. The recently deceased Geoff Hamilton (1936–96) was top of the list with 70% of votes cast. He received much fan mail and letters relating to gardening, and listeners and readers contributed by public subscription towards a set of memorial gates to his radio garden allotment in London near the Old Langham Hotel in London.Langham Hoteal Middleton Rose Garden, 2011 These have since been moved to BBC Written Archives Centre at Caversham, near Reading. Describing Middleton as \\"the Gert and Daisy of the gardening world\\", historian Philip Ziegler cited the immense popularity of his wartime broadcasts which \\"did as much as anything to convince doubters that running an allotment was a pleasant and profitable pursuit\\".Philip Ziegler (1995) London at War 1939–1945. Gert and Daisy were characters played by Elsie and Doris Waters in the radio variety show Workers' Playtime that did much to lift morale during the war. Indeed, such was his contemporaneous fame that, in 2008, author Byron Rogers observed that Middleton was \\"the first English national working class hero, apart from footballers and hangmen\\".

The main idea of the eXoSkeletal Model is that Lexical items do not have a syntactic category. Rather, they take on whatever syntactic category is imposed on them by their syntactic context. The framework is detailed in Borer's two 2005 books In Name Only and The Normal Course of Events, part of a trilogy entitled Structuring Sense, and a number of her and others' papers in morphosyntax. Main Idea The main idea of the eXoSkeletal Model is a divorce between the structure and the lexicon, but a strong correspondence between structure and meaning. Words in isolation have no syntactic category, it is only when they appear in a structure that they acquire these categories. More specifically, words in and of themselves are not nouns or verbs, nouns are not themselves mass or count, and verbs are not themselves telic or atelic. Rather it is the noun phrase (DP) as a whole that is mass or count, and the verb phrase (VP) that is telic or atelic. The framework is implemented so that it avoids type-shifting and lexical ambiguity. Selected bibliography *Borer, H. (2005a). In Name Only. Structuring Sense, Volume I.

The project was announced in 2011 by eFive Telecoms (Pty) Ltd, who led the project during the early feasibility studies. In November 2013 South Atlantic Express Cable Company (Pty) Ltd took over responsibility and was renamed to SimplCom South Africa (Pty) Ltd after SimplCom Inc. (Canada) acquired a controlling shareholding in the former. In April, 2011 the Bank of China announced that it was interested in investing 60% of the funds required for the project while the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa also had expressed interest in providing funding. As of May 2014 the project had funding interest from numerous private and public financial institutions. In June 2011 the project was expected to cost R3 billion to complete. A revised configuration (cable branch to Namibia instead of Angola and additional branch to Saint Helena and four instead of three fibre pairs), technological improvements and lower costs of technology are expected to reduce the projected capacity prices of the original design. As of October 2018, desktop surveying had begun. Overview Proposed route SAEx is conceived as a system to link the developing economies of southern Africa and South America independently of traditional hubs and so to contribute to a link between BRICS economic regions without recourse to traditional northern hemisphere hubs. It will also form a sub-sea route from Indian Ocean network nodes in the Gulf region, India and Eastern Asia to South America and the USA while avoiding geological and geopolitical hazards present on other paths, such as the oceanic trenches of the Pacific Ocean, the Red Sea, the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea and transits through potentially unstable countries and unreliable overland transit networks. Currently, internet traffic bounded from South Africa to the Americas routes through Europe. The SAex cable if constructed, will reduce latency and bandwidth costs associated with the distance that internet traffic currently has to travel by providing the shortest route possible from South Africa to the Americas. The initial design capacity of the cable is 40 TBit/s and will be over 10,000 kilometres in length (7,400 km from South Africa to Brazil and 3,000 km from Cape Town to Mtunzini). It will consist of four fibre pairs, each capable of carrying 10 TBit/s of data using 100 GBit/s wavelength technology. The branch to Namibia will stretch over 1,050 km while that to Saint Helena will have a length of less than 50 km. According to a memorandum of understanding closed in April 2010 Main One and SEACOM will interconnect their cables with SAex and so form a pan-African fibre-optic ring. Through SEACOM the cable could also supply India with bandwidth towards the Americas by onward connectivity to the United States through the existing GlobeNet cable system. At Yzerfontein SAEx would be able to interconnect to WACS while at Mtunzini SAFE, EASSy and SEACOM could provide onward connectivity to Asia, East Africa and India. The cable system is expected to be operational in 2020 (originally by mid-2014, later 2017). Campaign to connect St. Helena There were originally no plans to land the cable and install a landing station in Saint Helena. If this were done, however, the cable could supply the island's population with sufficient bandwidth to fully leverage the benefits of today's information society. Since January 2012 a campaign called Move This Cable launched by A Human Right, a San Francisco-based NGA working on initiatives to ensure all people are connected to the Internet, has been lobbying for a branch of the SAex cable to land on the remote island of Saint Helena in order to provide high-speed Internet access to the island's small population of 4,200 people and so to foster socio-economic development.campaign website Move This Cable! On October 6, 2012, eFive agreed to reroute the cable through Saint Helena after successful lobbying efforts. Islanders have sought the assistance of the UK Department for International Development and Foreign and Commonwealth Office in funding the £10m required to install a branch from an underwater OADM branching unit on the main cable to the island. The UK Government have announced that a review of the island's economy would be required before such funding would be agreed to. On 27 October 2017 St Helena Government announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding for a branch from the SAex cable to the island to be delivered in early 2020 which would be largely funded by the European Development Fund. Parallel projects In November 2011 former eFive CEO Mulaudzi stated that having the first-mover advantage was vital for the project since there is no need for two separate cable systems connecting Angola with Brazil. On Friday, 23 March 2012, the president of Angola Cables, António Nunes and the president of Telebrás, Caio Bonilha, signed a deal to construct a cable of about 6000 km length linking Fortaleza in Brazil with the Angolan capital Luanda named South Atlantic Cable System (SACS). IHS Global Insight lists four concurrent projects to lay new undersea cables between South America and Africa. Due to this competing project in 2014 the SAex' design was modified to now include a branch to Namibia instead of a dedicated fiber pair running from Fortaleza to Angola forking off mid- Atlantic. In October 2014 Angola Cables announced that South Atlantic Cable System (SACS) would be completed by end of 2016, taking the first mover advantage.

It has a Maronite and Greek Orthodox population.  Etymology  The word Bdebba has Syriac origins and is formed of two parts “Bet Dibba”. “Bet” means “house”(مكان ) and “Dibba” means “bear” (الدب). Hence, Bdebba is the house of the bear(مأوى الدب). This etymological analysis can be supported by archeological finding in the area. Indeed, an excavation by a team from Tokyo University Scientific Expedition to Western Asia in the Keoue area, a river bed that separates Bdebba and Bterram, and the artifacts found led to the conclusion that the occupants of the site were probably big bear hunters using small points.Hitashi Watanabe.

Lorch was a teacher in Boston and served as President of the Boston Teachers Union and as a member of the Boston Central Labour Council. She was the first teacher to challenge a Boston school regulation that female teachers resign after marriage, although unsuccessfully. Grace Lonergan married her husband Lee Lorch in 1943 as he was about to leave for military service in World War II. Despite having been a teacher for two decades she was dismissed due to an 1880s era rule of the Boston School Committee that banned teachers from marrying. Lorch appealed but the committee upheld the rule in 1944 and the publicity around Lorch's case led to a campaign to end the prohibition which was successful nine years later when, in 1953, the legislature voted to end the ban on married female teachers. The Lorches were activists in the civil rights struggle in the 1940s and 1950s. They and their infant daughter, Alice, moved into New York City's Stuyvesant Town and fought to desegregate the housing development bringing the issue to a head by allowing a black family to live in their apartment as guests. The controversy cost Lee Lorch his job as a math professor and the Lorches moved to the South where Lee found work with historically black colleges ultimately ending up at Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Arkansas. Two weeks after moving to Little Rock, Grace Lorch wrote a letter to the local school superintendent asking that eleven-year-old Alice be allowed to attend the neighbourhood school: \\"Since we live at 1801 High Street, located in a Negro neighborhood, this would be a Negro school,\\" she wrote, adding that it \\"might also provide a useful and unobtrusive example of benefit to the process of integrating Little Rock schools.\\" The request was denied. In 1957, the Lorches were involved in the Little Rock branch of the NAACP and were intimately involved in the Little Rock Nine's struggle to desegregate Little Rock Central High School. On their first day of school, the Nine were to arrive together; however, this instruction never reached fifteen- year-old Elizabeth Eckford who arrived separately and found herself facing an angry mob threatening to lynch her. Grace Lorch arrived, having just dropped off her daughter at a nearby junior high, rescued Eckford and escorted her home. Lorch's rescue of Eckford made the Lorches a target. Dynamite was placed in their garage, they were harassed in the press, Alice faced bullying at school and Grace was subpoenaed by the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. By 1959, Lee Lorch found himself blacklisted, and the family moved to Canada, where Grace died in 1974. References External links *\\"Grace K.

Site and history The forest occupied an area fourteen miles long and four miles wide between the River Soar and Rothley Brook, and covered 5,000 acres.Fox, Levi & Russell, Percy (1948) Leicester Forest, Edgar Backus, p. 19, 20, 23, 28Squires, Anthony & Jeeves, Michael (1994) Leicestershire and Rutland Woodlands Past and Present, Kairos Press, , p. 43-48 It was described in Domesday Book as 'Hereswode'. Once owned by Hugh de Grandmesnil, ownership passed to successive Earls of Leicester. In the thirteenth century Leicester townsfolk had rights to acquire wood in part of the forest known as the Frith, an area now occupied by western districts of the city of Leicester and Glenfield. The wooded nature of the area declined, resulting in several areas being enclosed to preserve them and the establishment of hunting parks. In 1265 the ownership passed to Edmund Crouchback, and in the fourteenth century it became important as an area for hunting. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the woodland declined due to over-exploitation, unlicensed felling and sheep grazing. In John Leland's Itinerary, he identified four parks within the forest - 'The Parke of St. Mary Abbey' (Abbey Park), 'Bellemonte's Leye' (Beaumont Leys), 'Barne Park' (also known as Barrons Park, between Desford and Kirby Muxloe), and 'Tooley Park' (near Earl Shilton).Shirley, Evelyn Philip (1867) Some Account of English Deer Parks: With Notes on the Management of Deer, p. 142 Also within the forest area were Frith Park (the 'New Park', now partly occupied by the New Parks housing estate), Lubbesthorpe Park, Brokensale Park, West of Thurlaston, and Newhall Park at Normanton. Disafforestation and riot In 1628, King Charles sanctioned the disafforestation of the area. During the 17th century the forest was sold in parts. The process of disafforestation caused riots among those affected by loss of rights to pasture and resources, as with other forests in the period, mainly in the west of England, where it was known as the Western Rising. Sir Miles Fleetwood was commissioned to survey and disafforest Leicester in December 1626 and March 1627. Commoners were to receive compensation where they could show a valid claim; many would not be able to, if they had settled of their own accord. The Attorney General then ensured that the arrangements were confirmed by the court of Exchequer in February 1628. The King then let 1,598 acres to nearby landowners for 'fines' of £7,760 and small annual rents. Riots occurred in response, destroying existing enclosures in spring 1627 and again in 1628 following the final division of the lands.Sharp, p58-59 Legal challenges were also made, against both the rioters and the enclosures. The enclosures were challenged by local inhabitants, the Corporation of Leicester and borough residents who submitted petitions to the King and Privy Council. The Privy Council found nothing unjust about the dealings of Fleetwood however, so challenges were made in the House of Lords in June 1628. the Lords however supported Fleetwood. An order was then made by the Lords praising Fleetwood for adding substantial income to the Crown but however to halt Star Chamber proceedings against the rioters. Buchanan Sharp concludes that \\"it may be surmised that a quid pro quo had been worked out: if the forest's inhabitants stopped rioting and petitioning, the government would drop all legal proceedings\\".Sharp, p70-71 =Compensation= The Crown made considerable compensation to local manorial lords and tenants as well as other residents. Five lords claimed around 2,755 acres were in use by their manors; of these 1,030 went to the King, and the rest to the manorial lords. The landowners had in turn to compensate their tenants for their losses. 554 acres went to tenants according to the size of their holdings, at around 4-6 acres to the yardland. Around 1.5-2 acres went to each cottage in addition. The Crown also compensated freeholders in other townships at a similar rate and gave 40 acres to the borough of Leicester for the maintenance of their poor.Sharp, p88 However, compensation would not have been made to the many families who had established homes on assart land (i.e., those who were occupying part of the forest without permission). The June 1628 petition to the House of Lords claimed that the families in 100 ancient cottages would not be compensated and neither would many more living in newly built cottages.Sharp, p95 After disafforestation In the following centuries, much of the area was cleared to provide land for farming and housing. The forest's name persists in the name of two settlements - the village of Leicester Forest East and the hamlet Leicester Forest West. A47 road towards Earl Shilton in Leicester Forest.

Both religions coexist peacefully. It is beautiful and lush, and the jaouz river (/nahr-el-jaouz/; ) surrounds it. History of the village's name is unknown, but some say it refers to the unique trees that branch over the river. Melhem (مِلحم) is the biggest family in Ejdabrine.  Etymology  The root of the name is yet hindered unknown, so the only reasonable analysis of the village's etymology, for now, would be the dissection of the name. Although, it is possible that the name of the village comes from the unique trees near the jaouz river. Equidistantly, the village shares similarity in name with two other villages not geographically far from it. Abrine and Ijdabra are the two villages, both of which are located in the Batroun District. Since all three names are a transliteration from Arabic, the connection is closer than is made out to be. Abrine (), Ijdabra (), and Ejdabrine (). ِ\\"Abr\\" () means across. \\"Ijd\\" or \\"Ejd\\" () means [go] find. The \\"ine\\" () is a common Arabic tool used to make a word refer to two in which \\"Abrine\\" would mean \\"two paths\\". So Ejdabrine in whole would literally mean, \\"[go] find two paths\\". If the meaning of the name truly is this, geographically speaking, one logical explanation would go back to the jaouz river trees in which the name is in reference to that. Another possibility of the name is the literal entrance to the village, which, in turn, is hard to explain how it might reference to the name, and that might be a reason why the name may not actually refer to the village's entrance. Of course, the translation is not limited to that as \\"Ejd\\" could mean a variety of things. Several of those meanings could be \\"renewed\\", \\"grandfather\\", \\"[I] found\\", and, in Arabic, the word is a variation of \\"prowess\\" or \\"strength\\". Same with \\"Abr\\" in which the word could also mean a variety of things. Another possibility is that this name comes from another language or is a mix of Arabic with a different language. The different languages could vary from Phoenician (Greek), French, Spanish, and Aramaic. All of this is speculation and the only possible analysis until a reference is taken hold of; the village is a place of simple-times where people go to farm and spend time with family and members of the community.  Geography  = Abrine & Ijdabra = Ejdabrine being at Southernmost of the Koura District, the villages, Abrine and Ijdabra, are located in the Batroun District. Abrine is about 26 km Southwest of Ejdabrine, and Ijdabra is right below Abrine, the two separated only by the Batroun-Tannourine Road and the Cross of Hope in between the two villages, leaning more into Ijdabra. = The Jaouz River = Geographically tucked below the rise of the mountain in this area, this river is not central to the village and it can rarely be seen, save at the site itself. That being said, the jaouz river is not solely for Ejdabrine. 1,000m above sea level and 38 km long, the river starts along from Tannourine El-Tahta in the Batroun District, passes through Boustane El-Assi, then Ras Nhach, goes further North into the Koura District along South of Ejdabrine, and meets the Mediterranean Sea in Western Batroun, near Seaside Road.

Biography He was born in Taranto, Apulia, Southern Italy, but later moved to Naples to attend jurisprudence studies. His life takes place during the conspiracy plots which characterised the south of Italy from 1848 to 1870. Little is known about Benedetto Musolino e Luigi Settembrini's “Figlioli della Giovane Italia” (Little sons of the young Italy) sect, however Mignogna's collaboration with Settembrini is documented in the “Unità d'Italia” (Italy's Unity) sect in the years 1848-49Settembrini, p. 453; compare documents from State Archive of Naples reported in Lisi, L'Unità e il Meridione. Nicola Mignogna (1808-1870), pp. 32-38. with his task being the typographical reproduction of the revolutionary flyers and its spreading in the provinces. Mignogna was arrested with Settembrini on June 23, 1849, but was released a few months later; while Settembrini, recognised as the leader, was condemned to capital punishment, sentence later reduced to life imprisonment. Arrested in 1851, Mignogna was released months later as his crimes were considered unproven. Coordinator of the revolutionary Neapolitan committee, Mignogna conspired between May 1854 and the beginning of 1855 with Casimiro De Lieto, in exhile in Genoa, to overthrow Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, plan which seemed to initially have, thanks to the political movement originated with Lucien Murat, a small chance of being successful.Documents from Murat archive reported in Lisi, L'Unità e il Meridione. Nicola Mignogna (1808-1870), pp. 131-181 He was arrested again on July 26, 1855, but he didn't reveal the conspiracy plot nor the collaborators' names, even under torture. Other defendants confessed and, also through the deciphering of certain letters, it became clear that Mignogna was at the core of the revolutionary machine in the Neapolitan's region.Corciulo M.S. (2004).

Nicola Mignogna (1808-1870),pp. 54-79 he was condemned to exile. In Genoa, in the years 1856-1857, Carlo Pisacane made use of Mignogna's Neapolitan logistics knowledge to study with Giuseppe Mazzini a new insurrectional plan which, according to the conspirators' intentions, should have involved Naples and the regions of Cilento, Calabria and Basilicata, which were the centers where the feelings against the near-dictatorial power of Ferdinand II were felt the most. Pisacane refused the help of Lucien Murat's collaborators and his expedition (which did not see Mignogna's direct involvement) ended unsuccessfully, for various reasons and unfortunate coincidences. During the preparation of Pisacane's expedition, the assistance from the employees of Naples's embassy was valuable, as they were responsible for the mail delivery between Genoa and Naples, redirecting it first to Malta, where it was marked as diplomatic mail, therefore hiding the true conspiratory contents of the letters.Pisacane, Epistolario, p.525 It is worth to note that English Ambassador William Temple, brother of Prime minister Lord Palmerston, helped by his secretary George Fagan, despite never being directly involved, greatly supported the Neapolitan's patriots. In 1859, Mignogna often travelled between Genoa e Florence, remaining in contact with Mazzini, to support the insurgence which arose in the Tuscany and Romagna regions in that year. This movement was however suddenly stopped by the king of Sardinia Victor Emmanuel's warning to Giuseppe Garibaldi.Pupino-Carbonelli, Nicola Mignogna nella storia dell'unità d'Italia, pp. 143-173; compare Lisi, L'Unità e il Meridione. Nicola Mignogna (1808-1870), pp. 88-93 In February 1860, representing the Genoa's revolutionaries, Mignogna went to Caprera to relief Garibaldi (disappointed by his failed marriage with Giuseppina Raimondi) and encourage him to resume his fight for Italy's unification. Mignogna's support towards Garibaldi led to a first few steps towards an expedition to Sicily, which later became the Expedition of the Thousand.Garibaldi, Epistolario, p.39 As part of the Expedition of the Thousand to Marsala, he followed Garibaldi to Palermo, covering the charge of the Thousand's treasurer.Bevilacqua,I Mille di Marsala, p. 252 He was later sent to Genoa by Garibaldi to plan an insurgence in the region of Lazio. Ultimately, he travelled to Naples to promote the revolution in the region of Basilicata; together with a few thousands of patriots he easily conquered the city of Potenza where a dictatorial government was proclaimed and established with Mignogna and Giacinto Albini as their leaders in support of Garibaldi. In 1862 Mignogna was with Garibaldi in Aspromonte. He died in 1870 in Giugliano in Campania, near Naples.

It is constructed in brick, which has been rendered, with stone dressings and a slate roof. It is in two storeys, and has four-storey towers. The house is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. Its stable block is listed separately at Grade II. Features of the estate include an arched stone bridge, a ha-ha, a woodland garden and parkland. History The Toft estate came into the Leycester family when Ralph Leycester of Tabley married heiress Joan Toft of Toft in the late 14th century during the reign of Richard II. The hall itself was built in the later part of the 17th century \\"to an extremely old-fashioned layout\\". Ralph Leycester (1763–1835), MP for Shaftesbury (1821–1830),History of Parliament Online: Ralph Leycester (1763-1835), accessed October 2017. commissioned the London architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell to renovate the hall between 1810 and 1813. These improvements included the addition of a library, dining-room and twin towers. Ralph was succeeded by his only son, Ralph Gerard Leycester (1817–1851) who was succeeded in turn by his son, Rafe Oswald Leycester (1844–1929). Rafe died childless and left the estate to his nephew, Cyril Leycester Maude Roxby (1877–1942) and in 1949 it was inherited by Cyril's nephew, Edmund Roxby (b. 1913). During the Second World War Toft Hall was the site of a prisoner of war camp. In 2010–12 the Hall was extensively renovated and extended with a rear orangery, to the designs of Mason Gillibrand Architects of Lancaster.

It is a dense forest, with an area of 422.95 square kilometers, which is about 40% of the total land area of the district. The land is undulating because of the confluence of three different formations — Malwa Plateau, the Vindhyachal Hills and Aravali mountain ranges. Location The sanctuary is located between 74 degrees 25' E and 24 degrees 04' N in Pratapgarh and Chittaurgarh districts of Rajasthan. The average elevation ranges between 280 and 600 metres above mean sea level with an average rainfall of 756 mm annually. The temperature variation during winter is between 6 and 14 degrees Celsius and in summer is between 32 and 45 degrees. The thickly wooded Sita Mata Wildlife Sanctuary sprawls over the Aravali ranges and the Malwa plateau, with the seasonal rivers Jakham, Karmoi, Sitamata, Budhho, and Tankiya flowing through the forest. Jakham is the largest. It is located about 45 km from Pratapgarh and 108 km from the divisional headquarters. Udaipur, the sanctuary, covering 423 km2 of mainly dry deciduous vegetation has exceptionally rich flora and fauna. The Champion and Seth forest type of Sita Mata is \\"IInd Dry Tropical Forest\\".

Its feeding activities are nocturnal and therefore it hides during the day time in its hollow in a Mahua tree. The best time to watch flying squirrels is between February and March, when most of the mahua trees shed their leaves and it is easier to spot the squirrel gliding between branches of leafless trees. There are a variety of deer at the sanctuary, including the Chousingha (four-horned antelope) and spotted deer. Caracal, wild boar, pangolin, Indian leopard, striped hyena, golden jackal, Bengal fox, jungle cat, porcupine, sloth bear, and nilgai are also present. =Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project= The Asiatic lion, which used to occur in Rajasthan, is now confined to Gujarat.

Life Fortescue was the third and youngest son of Sir Adrian Fortescue, was educated at Winchester College. Unlike his elder brother Sir John Fortescue, chancellor of the exchequer, Sir Anthony adhered to the Roman Catholic church. During the reign of Queen Mary he married Katharine Pole, granddaughter of Margaret, countess of Salisbury, and received the appointment of comptroller of the household of his wife's uncle, Cardinal Pole. After the accession of Elizabeth, Sir Anthony and his brothers-in-law Arthur and Edmund Pole plotted against the new sovereign. In November 1558 Fortescue was taken into custody along with several persons whom he was accused of causing to cast the horoscope of Elizabeth and to calculate the length of her life and the chances of the duration of her government; he was, however, released on bail on 25 November, and no further action seems to have been taken in the matter (Strype, Annals, ed. 1825, vol. i. pt. i. pp. 9–10). Three years later, in October 1561, Arthur and Edward Pole and Fortescue were arrested as they were on the point of sailing to Flanders; they were kept in prison until February of the next year, when they were tried upon a charge of high treason at Westminster Hall. There is no complete record of the trial extant; from the accounts given in Strype's ‘Annals’ (vol. i. pt. i. pp. 555–6), and Wright's ‘Queen Elizabeth’ (i. 121, 127, 129), their plan seems to have been wild. They proposed as soon as they arrived in Flanders to proclaim Arthur Pole, the elder of the brothers, Duke of Clarence; to persuade Mary Queen of Scots to marry Edmund Pole the younger brother, Arthur being already married to a daughter of the Earl of Northumberland; to obtain from the Duc de Guise a force of five or six thousand men, with whom they hoped to return to Wales, proclaim Queen Mary, overthrow the existing government, and restore the ancient religion. Before setting out on this expedition they had consulted two conjurers, by name John Prestall and Edward Cosyn, who, with two servants of Lord Hastings and a person named Barwick, were arrested and included in the indictment. These conjurers had succeeded in raising a ‘wicked spryte’ who prophesied that all would go well with their designs, and that Queen Elizabeth would die a natural death before the next summer. A more serious clause of the accusation charged Fortescue with obtaining countenance and help from the French and Spanish ambassadors. All the accused were convicted and condemned to death, but their lives were spared by the queen, and their sentences commuted to imprisonment in the Tower. There, between 1565 and 1578, both the Poles died, while Fortescue, at what date is unknown, was released or allowed to escape. He probably owed his freedom to the influence of his brother Sir John, who was highly esteemed by Elizabeth. Of the remainder of his career nothing is known; he is spoken of as living, probably abroad, in his brother Thomas Fortescue's will, dated May 1608. Family Sir Anthony left three sons, Anthony, John, and George; his grandson Anthony, son of his eldest son, was appointed by Charles III, Duke of Lorraine, his resident at the English court, and was expelled from the country by a resolution of the House of Commons, 16 Oct. 1644.

Karen was a graduate student at Rutgers University, studying computers. On December 24, 1983, Karen was reported missing by her parents after she failed to show up at their home for dinner in Bricktown, New Jersey. The next day, her body was found in her apartment on her bedroom floor. She had been stabbed with a knife several times to death. She was also strangled. Karen's ex-boyfriend, Ned Snelgrove, was the prime suspect in her murder, but was not charged until several years later, after attacking another New Jersey woman.

Attack on Mary Ellen Renard In August 1987, Snelgrove encountered a 44-year-old divorcee named Mary Ellen Renard at a New Jersey nightclub. Snelgrove and Mary Ellen conversed over the course of the night. Snelgrove had told Mary Ellen that he was a recent Rutgers graduate working at HP. At the end of the night, when Mary Ellen was preparing to leave, her car would not start. Snelgrove helped her get her car started, and offered to follow her home to make sure she arrived there safely. When they got back to Mary Ellen's Elmwood Park, New Jersey apartment, Snelgrove asked to use her bathroom, so she let him in. After getting into Mary Ellen's apartment, Snelgrove sexually assaulted and stabbed her several times. Mary Ellen fought back and was able to get into the apartment below her, whose owner called the police. Mary Ellen survived the attack, and was able to identify Snelgrove as her attacker. He was later apprehended and charged. Snelgrove wrote the following in a 1992 letter about the assault on Mary Ellen Renard: \\"I botched it up. She didn't die. If she had died, my name wouldn't have even made the suspect list\\". Prison In 1988, Snelgrove was to stand trial for the attack on Mary Ellen Renard. Instead of going to trial Snelgrove pleaded guilty to assaulting Mary Ellen Renard and to murdering Karen Osmun. He was convicted of aggravated manslaughter, aggravated criminal sexual contact, and criminal attempted homicide. On June 24, 1988, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. During his incarceration, he wrote many letters to a former classmate George Recck. He had compared himself to serial killer Ted Bundy and mused how he should emulate Bundy's practice of choosing victims far from his home. After serving 10 years and 11 months, Snelgrove was released from prison on May 26, 1999 for good behavior. Prosecutors repeatedly claimed to have objected to Snelgrove's early release from prison, yet the New Jersey Department of Corrections reviewed Snelgrove's records and determined he was eligible for early release based on time served and good behavior. Murder of Carmen Rodriguez After Snelgrove's 1999 release from prison, he moved to Connecticut with his parents. However, prison proved not to rehabilitate Snelgrove. He was later linked to the September 2001 disappearance of 32-year- old Carmen Rodriguez. Rodriquez was last seen alive leaving a bar with Snelgrove in Hartford, Connecticut. Rodriquez's body was found January 6, 2002 in Hopkinton, Rhode Island. Her body was hog-tied in 11 trash bags, and was not identified until police recognized her tattoo. Snelgrove was charged with Rodriguez's murder in October 2003, and the case went to trial in 2005. The trial judge, Carmen Espinosa, permitted evidence of Snelgrove's prison letters and past convictions at his murder trial, and combined with the circumstantial evidence, Snelgrove was convicted of the murder of Rodriguez. Aftermath On April 15, 2005, Snelgrove was sentenced to life in prison, which is defined by state law as a term of 60 years. Snelgrove filed an appeal, claiming that his past criminal history should not have been introduced at his 2005 murder trial. In September 2008, the Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed Snelgrove's convictions. The case has been profiled on the Oxygen Network series Captured and the Investigation Discovery series On the Case with Paula Zahn. In both programs, Mary Ellen Renard provides statements about her horrifying ordeal with Snelgrove.

Structure The commission is under the [Ministry of Transport] of the Republic of Ghana. Functions of the commission The mandate of the commission allows the NRSC to promote and coordinate Road Safety activities in Ghana. Road accident statistics The function of the commission is important to all aspects of the Ghanaian economy. This is because road accidents are a national issue in Ghana. Statistics show that four people die daily on Ghanaian roads due to road accident. Estimates show that Ghana loses over 230 million dollars yearly due to road accidents with more than 1600 deaths. The loss correlates to 1.7% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product. The NRSC announced in 2010 that there were 19 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in Ghana. Statistics showed that 43% of the fatalities involved pedestrians and 53% involved occupants of vehicles. 23% of all pedistrain fatalities involved children below the age of 16 years. The major cause of road accidents in Ghana is due to over speeding. This accounts for 60% of car crashes in the country.https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Road- accidents-696-die-in-2019-first-quarter-747721 Collaborating agencies The NRSC collaborates various state agencies to ensure road safety.

Therefore, the term New Jersey English is diverse and may refer to any of these dialects of American English, or even intermediate varieties that blend features of these multiple dialects. Mid-Atlantic or Philadelphia dialect The regional dialect of the southern Mid-Atlantic States, in this case Philadelphia English specifically, is spoken in South Jersey and some parts of Central Jersey, including most of Ocean County. Generally, the closer a speaker was raised to the city of Philadelphia, the more features their variety will share with the Philadelphia sub-dialect, such as use of the term hoagie to mean submarine sandwich (or sub). In Vineland in South Jersey and in some areas of Central Jersey, a nasal short-a system has been reported (in which is tensed only before a nasal consonant), rather than the defining Philadelphia split-a system typical of South Jersey. New York dialect The dialect of greater New York City is spoken in northeastern New Jersey, plus Middlesex and Monmouth Counties. Therefore, the short-a system of these areas of New Jersey is most similar to the New York City split-a system, however with some variation. East of the Hackensack River, William Labov finds the short-a system to occur with no more variation than in New York City proper. However, west of the Hackensack River, he finds that the normal function word constraint of New York City English is lost and the open syllable constraint becomes variable.http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonoatlas/PLC3/Ch15.pdf While most of the New York metropolitan dialect heard in New Jersey is rhotic, that of Newark and Jersey City (just across the Hudson River from New York City) may be non- rhotic or \\"r-dropping\\". Northern dialect Outside of the New York metropolitan area, regional English of North Jersey was classified as part of the broad Northern U.S. phonological region by The Atlas of North American English in 2006 and part of the Hudson Valley lexical region by Hans Kurath in 1949. Here, the vowel remains very far back in the mouth. Like Inland Northern English but unlike New York City English, the accent backs and fronts , so that both vowels are centralized, distinguished from each other only by height. However, unlike the Inland Northern accent, this accent uses the nasal short-a system. African-American dialect Working- and middle-class African Americans throughout New Jersey commonly speak African-American Vernacular English, regardless of the area of the state in which they were raised.

Members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist organization, are alleged to have killed over 600 unarmed Sri Lanka Police officers in Eastern Province, Sri Lanka. Some accounts have estimated the number killed as high as 774. Background =Indian intervention= According to the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) arrived at Sri Lanka in July 1987. Their presence in the country was not very popular among the Sri Lankan public and the politicians. In January 1989, President Ranasinghe Premadasa's government was elected. President Premadasa's initial intention was to work out a peace plan with the LTTE, which was waging a bloody separatist campaign in the country's north and east. Premadasa too was unhappy with the Indian presence in Sri Lanka. In June 1989, he entered into a ceasefire agreement with the LTTE. In an attempt to win over its leadership, Premadasa transferred a large quantity of weapons to the organization (at their request), to fight against the IPKF. And in late 1989, Premadasa asked the IPKF to depart, due to the adverse public opinion. Indian Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh consented and withdrew his force. =Breakdown of peace talks= Meanwhile, a Sri Lankan government delegation led by Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdul Cader Shahul Hameed held peace talks with the LTTE. Although the talks seemed successful at the initial stages, no agreement was made on critical issues like the dissolution of the Northeast Provincial Council and repealing of the Sixth Amendment to the constitution. LTTE chief political strategist and chief negotiator Anton Balasingham threatened the government, stating that \\"this is the last chance we give you. If you fail, we are prepared to wage war\\". The situation worsened after Sri Lankan Minister of Defence Ranjan Wijeratne asked the LTTE to lay down arms. LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran refused and hostilities between the government and the LTTE began to increase. =Preceding events= During this time, the Army was confined to the military camps. No action was taken against any of the LTTE activities for fear that peace talks would break down. But tension began to escalate by late May 1990. The army found that LTTE had constructed bunkers, dug trenches and implemented other defense measures closer to the camps. But the Defense Ministry had instructed the Army to keep mute. Thandikulam incident On 7 June 1990, a vehicle carrying Army personnel from Vavuniya to Mullaitivu was fired at by the LTTE. One soldier died and nine were injured. But the Defense Ministry instructed to take no action. Massacre On 11 June 1990, at about 6:00 a.m., LTTE surrounded the Batticaloa police station and abducted 3 policemen. About an hour later, around 250 armed LTTE cadres occupied the police station. Then the Sinhalese police officers along with their families were sent to the airport. Tamil Police officers were taken to the St Mary's Church, with their families. The acting Officer-in-Charge and four other policemen were detained. LTTE also removed Rs. 45 million in cash, gold jewellery, 109 T 56 rifles; 77 T 84S rifles; 28 light machine guns; 29 self-loading rifles; 65 sub machine guns; 78 .303 rifles and 78 SAR 80 guns from the police station. LTTE ordered all police stations in Eastern Province to be vacated by 2:30 p.m. or face the consequences. The Inspector General of Police, Ernest Perera, also instructed the police officers to surrender, at the request of President Ranasinghe Premadasa. Police officers laid down their arms after being promised safe conduct and subsequent release. Then the Sinhalese officers were sent to the Army or Air Force camps while Tamil officers were accommodated at schools. Meanwhile, the LTTE abducted 899 officers. About 125 were able to escape. Prisoners were taken to the Vinayagapuram and Trincomalee jungles. Once they had arrived, the LTTE cadres lined up the officers, tied their hands behind their backs and shot them dead. In all, 600 to 774 police officers died. But not all the officers complied at once. ASP Ivan Boteju, who was the OIC of Kalmunai police station, refused to surrender and kept on fighting with the LTTE from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. He protested insisting that they \\"would be tortured if not killed [if they surrendered]\\". Within that period, he repeatedly requested air support and artillery support but was denied. At about 5:20 p.m. the IGP personally contacted Botheju, ordered to cease firing and surrender. When they had laid down their arms, LTTE took over and all communications with the Colombo Police headquarters were lost. Then the LTTE cadres took them to the Tirukkovil jungles and executed them. In Kalmunai, LTTE also fired at an Army convoy, killing ten Army soldiers. It was reported that 324 police officers who died were Sinhalese and Muslim. All of them were taken to the Tirukovil jungles by the LTTE, blindfolded, hands tied, made to lie down on the ground, and shot. Aftermath Sri Lanka's chief peace negotiator Minister Shahul Hameed's attempts to rescue the officers in detention went in vain. This massacre officially put an end to the ceasefire between government and the LTTE. On 18 June 1990, the Minister of Defence Ranjan Wijeratne announced from the floor of the parliament, \\"From now on, it is all out war and no half ways\\". It was the start of the Eelam War II. As a result of the LTTE attacks, Army had to abandon camps including Kokavil, Mankulam, Killinochchi, Kondachchi and Silavathurai. This, together with the abandonment of Police stations, resulted in a huge loss of territory to the government. LTTE had also managed to cut-off the land route to Jaffna Peninsula. LTTE was in-charge of most of the area in North and Eastern provinces by July 1990. Before this incident, LTTE had no conventional fighting capabilities. During Eelam War I, LTTE was merely a guerilla Outfit. At the time of this massacre, LTTE's peace delegation comprising Jude – an LTTE communication specialist – and two military wing cadres were at Hilton Hotel, Colombo. Then they were moved to a military camp at Kalutara, under heavy security of Special Task Force. They were returned to the LTTE a few days later without any harm. According to Major General Sarath Munasinghe's book A Soldiers Version, the LTTE radio operator [Jude] had a message from Prabhakaran: \\"Whatever happens, ensure that the money offered is brought with you\\". The massacre provoked revenge riots in the Gal Oya valley, instigated by policemen. 26 Tamils were killed by Sinhalese mobs. Further reading * Gunaratna, Rohan. (1998).

It has been performed in Orissa for centuries by young boys, who dress as women to praise Jagannath and Krishna. The dance is executed by a group of boys who perform acrobatic figures inspired by the life of Radha and Krishna. The boys begin to learn the dance at an early age until adolescence, when their androgynous appearance changes. In the Odia language, Gotipua means \\"single boy\\" (goti-pua). Raghurajpur, Odisha (near Puri) is a historic village known for its Gotipua dance troupes. The dance of the Gotipuas is accompanied by traditional Odissi music with the primary percussion being the Mardala. Dancers To transform into graceful feminine dancers the boys do not cut their hair, instead they style it into a knot and weaving garlands of flowers into it. They make up their faces with mixed white and red powder. Kajal (black eyeliner) is broadly applied around the eyes to give them an elongated look. The bindi, usually round, is applied to the forehead, surrounded with a pattern made from sandalwood. Traditional paintings adorn the face, which are unique to each dance school. The costume has evolved over time. The traditional dress is a Kanchula, a brightly coloured blouse with shiny decorations. An apron-like, embroidered silk cloth (nibibandha) is tied around the waist like a ruffle and worn around the legs. Some dancers still adhere to tradition by wearing a pattasari: a piece of thin fabric about long, worn tightly with equal lengths of material on both sides and a knot on the navel. However, this traditional dress is often replaced by a newly designed cloth which is easier to put on. Dancers wear specially designed, beaded jewellery: necklaces, bracelets, armbands and ear ornaments. Nose-piercing jewellery has been replaced with a painted motif. Ankle bells are worn, to accentuate the beats tapped out by the feet. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet are painted with a red liquid known as alta. The costume, jewellery and bells are considered sacred. History Long ago, the temples in Orissa had female dancers known as devadasis (or mahari), who were devoted to Jagannath, which gave rise to Mahari dance. Sculptures of dancers on bas-reliefs in temples in Orissa (and the Konark Sun and Jagannath Temples in Puri) demonstrate this ancient tradition. With the decline of mahari dancers around the 16th century during the reign of Rama Chandra Dev (who founded the Bhoi dynasty), boy dancers in Orissa continued the tradition. Gotipua dance is in the Odissi style, but their technique, costumes and presentation differ from those of the mahari; the singing is done by the dancers. Present-day Odissi dance has been influenced by Gotipua dance. Most masters of Odissi dance (such as Kelucharan Mohapatra, from Raghurajpur) were Gotipua dancers in their youth. Odissi dance is a combination of tandava (vigorous, masculine) and lasya (graceful, feminine) dances. It has two basic postures: tribhangi (in which the body is held with bends at the head, torso and knees) and chouka (a square-like stance, symbolising Jagannath). Fluidity in the upper torso is characteristic of Odissi dance, which is often compared to the gentle sea waves which caress the Orissa beaches. Each year, the Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra Odissi Research Centre organises the Gotipua Dance Festival in Bhubaneswar. Repertoire The dance typically begins with a vandana prayer (an invocation, with prayers of gratitude to Mother Earth, Jagannath and one's guru and welcoming the audience). The dancers perform a three-step salutation: the first above their heads towards God, the second in front of their faces for the guru and the third in front of their chests for the audience. The Sarigama is a dance celebrating beauty, and highlighting the mastery of technique; it is portrayed by dancers and musicians carved into the outer walls of ancient temples. The Abhinaya is the enactment of a song and interpretation of ancient poetry. This dance depicts Radha Krishna-oriented poems, such as the 12th-century Gita Govinda. The verses used for narration are extremely ornate in content and suggestion. Graceful, fluid, and sensual, the Abhinaya resembles a moving love poem with its facial expressions, eye movement and mudra gestures: \\"Come and see, my love Here comes Krishna, the flute player, the Supreme Performer Come and see, my love He dances wearing ankles bells So lovely rhythmic patterns he makes Listen to his melodies, the mardala beats Listen to his flute and clappings.\\" An interesting part of Gotipua is Bandha Nrutya, the presentation of acrobatic yogic postures (referring to mythological scenes from the life of Krishna) similar to visual presentations by the pattachitra artists of Orissa. The difficult and intricate poses (requiring suppleness of limb) are known as bandha (\\"acrobatic\\" in the Odia language). To perform this dance, boys need to start learning it at the age of five or six. Musical accompaniment is provided by the mardala (a two-headed drum, a percussion instrument in Orissa), gini (small cymbals), harmonium, violin, bansuri and one or two vocalists. Abhinaya Chandrika (a 15th-century text on Odissi dance by Maheshwara Mahapatra) provides a detailed study of the movements of the feet, hands (mudras), the standing postures, movement and repertoire; it mentions more than 25 varieties of bandha including Gagana, Dhurmukha, Torona and Shayana. Sangita Darpana, a 17th-century text about music and dance, gives a complete repertory and overall style of presentation. Some bandhas are found in oral tradition; these include: *Chira (welcome pose) *Padmasana (lotus pose) *Hansa (swan; represents wisdom, grace and beauty and is a vehicle for the goddess Saraswati) *Mayura (peacock; sacred bird of Hindu mythology, whose feathers adorn Krishna's head) *Chara Mayura (grazing peacock, representing splendor and majesty) *Keli kadamba (holy tree under which Krishna played) *Garuda (mythical eagle; vehicle of Vishnu) *Kandarpa Ratha (chariot of Kandarpa, god of love) *Sagadi (wheel, representing the wheels of Jagannath's chariot) *Nauka (boat) *Kaliyadalana (the defeat of Blacksnake by Krishna) *Bakasura (Bhima killing Bakasura in the Mahabharata) Maguni Charan Das, Padma Shri awardee and a recipient of the Odisha Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, was one of the masters of the Gotipua dance.

Previously an active shipping pier and warehouse, Pier 54 was originally known as Pier 3 until it was renumbered during World War II. This pier was also known as Galbraith dock and the Galbraith Bacon dock. Because of the large number of smaller local steamships, generally built of wood, that used the pier up until the 1930s, the pier was also known as the “Mosquito Fleet dock”. Location Pier 54 is located at the foot of Spring Street.Beaton, Welford, ed. Frank Waterhouse & Company's Pacific Ports: A Commercial Geography (1917), at pages 27-37. (accessed 06-09-11). The current dock for the fireboats of the Seattle Fire Department is located immediately to the south of Pier 54. Pier 55 is the next pier to the north.

History Pier 54 (then Pier 3) circa 1901, with steamer T.W. Lake alongside. Starting in 1900, Pier 3 was leased by Galbraith, Bacon & Co. The principals of this firm were James Galbraith and Cecil Bacon. They were wholesale dealers in grain, hay, plaster, concrete, and building materials.Dorpat, Paul, “Seattle's Belltown Fire of 1910”, HistoryLink.org Essay 4180, (May 23, 2003). (accessed 06-12-11).Faber, Steamers Wake, at pages 130, 131, 134, and 192-193. In 1910, the pier narrowly escaped destruction in the Belltown fire, although the nearby Galbraith, Bacon warehouse was destroyed. In 1917, like Pier 1 and Pier 2, Seattle, Pier 3 was owned by the Northern Pacific Railway. Pier 3 was the terminal for Island Transportation Co., Merchants Transportation Co., Puget Sound Naval Station Route, Kitsap County Transportation Co., Pollard Steamship. Co., and other Puget Sound local shipping lines. The Kitsap County Transportation Company, run by James Galbraith's son Walter Galbraith, competed against the Puget Sound Navigation Company running from the Colman Dock. As such it was home pier for wooden steamships such as the Kitsap, the Utopia, the Reliance and the Hyak. Other Puget Sound steamers known to have called at Pier 3 included Magnolia, Mohawk, Florence K, Dode, and Monticello 2.Newell, Gordon R, and Williamson, Joe, Pacific Steamboats, Bonanza Books, New York, NY 1958, at page 120 (showing photograph of Monticello at Pier 3) Pier 3 was within walking distance of Pike Place Market where much of the local groceries brought in by the steamers were sold. Typically this would have been done by the farmers themselves or their wives, who would ride the steamers into Pier 3 in the morning and depart in the evening. Live hens, slaughtered poultry, eggs, milk in galvanized cans, sacks of potatoes, rhubarb in bundles and fruit in crates. Dockside travel facilities offered few comforts then, but Pier 3 was one of the first to offer a small waiting room. From 1929 to the mid-1930s Pier 3 was general headquarters for Gorst Air Transport, who operated a seaplane service from there, using Keystone-Loening planes. They also operated out of Bremerton across the Sound. Through this period, the Northern Pacific still owned the pier, but by 1944 the Washington Fish and Oyster Company (now Ocean Beauty Seafoods) had purchased the pier and was its main tenant. Engineering firm Reese and Callender Associates helped them reinforce the pier and to adapt it to its new use.Summary for 1003 Alaskan WAY / Parcel ID 7666202495, Seattle Department of Neighborhoods.

It dates from the late 16th to the early 17th century, with additions made in the 18th and 19th centuries. The house is historically important because it was here that the Cheshire gentlemen met in 1715 to decide whether to support the Stuarts or the Hanoverians. They decided on the latter and later commissioned a set of portraits, which now hang in Tatton Hall. The house is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. Also listed at Grade II are the gate piers to the forecourt of the building, a carriage house in the forecourt, the kitchen garden wall, and the stable block. For the 2019 biopic Tolkien, 15 acres of the Tatton Estate were used to recreate the trenches of the First World War.Freer, I. (2019). Tolkien. Picturehouse Recommends. May/June/July: 34-35.

In any given year, it is estimated that 1400 Iranians sell one of their kidneys to a recipient who was previously unknown to them. Iran currently is the only country in the world that allows the sale of one's kidney for compensation (typically a payment); consequently, the country does not have either a waiting list or a shortage of available organs. According to an article in Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, the model has avoided many problems associated with organ trade but all models used in other developing countries have failed to slow down the worsening of transplant queues. Background The first kidney transplantation in the Middle Eastern region was conducted in 1967 in Iran. It was not until the mid-1980s that these operations became commonplace. Iran allows kidney donations from both cadavers and compensated donors. Before the April 2000 law passed by parliament justifying the procurement of organs from those deemed clinically brain-dead, donor-compensated transplants represented over 99 percent of cases. It is now estimated that 13 percent of donations come from cadavers. Market proponents, such as the Cato Institute, claim that after financial incentives were introduced into the kidney market, Iran eliminated their transplant waiting list by 1999. However, a closer examination reveals that many Iranians afflicted with end-stage renal disease don't receive a diagnosis and aren't referred for dialysis, so therefore would never be eligible for a transplant. Ahad Ghods, from the Hashemi Nejad Kidney Hospital in Iran, admitted \\"This is the main reason that the renal transplant waiting list was eliminated quickly and successfully in Iran.\\" Regulation The model is organised through voluntary worker organizations. The receivers and the government pay for the donors. Charity organizations help those who cannot pay themselves.The Meat Market, The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 8, 2010. The Charity Association for the Support of Kidney Patients (CASKP) and the Charity Foundation for Special Diseases (CFSD), under control of the Ministry of Health, regulates the trade of organs with the support of the government. The organizations match donors to recipients, arranging for tests to ensure compatibility. In order to prevent corruption or inequality “neither the transplant center nor transplant physicians are involved in identifying potential vendors” The amounts paid to the donor vary in Iran; however, the average figures are between $2,000 to $4,000 for a kidney donation. In contrast, a compatible kidney sold on the global black-market can cost in excess of 160,000 in some cases. Islamic views In 1996, Islamic religious scholars from the Muslim Law Council of Great Britain issued a fatwa allowing the practice of organ transplants. However; as this decree allows donation to help save the life of another, it disallows acts of commerce, trade, or compensation in donations. Similar Middle-eastern models In Saudi Arabia, transplants are performed using medicinal cadavers rather than living donors. The practice is sponsored and regulated by the government, through the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation (SCOT). The organization is also responsible for the standards of care, public and formal education, regulations, and monitoring of all types of organ transplants. Because of the limited number of cadaver candidates, there are not enough donations to satisfy demand.
