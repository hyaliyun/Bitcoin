Roberts was a cousin to character actor Theodore Roberts with whom she had appeared on the stage. Roberts' greatest stage success was in The Strength of the Weak, performed on Broadway in 1906. That same year Lewis Morrison died and she later remarried, to an actor named Frederick Vogeding. Later years In 1912 she was one of the first famous stage stars to appear in a film version of a famous play, in this case an independent production of Sapho which had made actress Olga Nethersole famous in the early 1900s. Roberts appeared in four more silent pictures up to 1925 before dying in 1927.

Artists' model Sketch of Florence Allen by Eleanor Dickinson, 1965. Allen began modelling in 1933, motivated by monetary need, and worked for painters such as Mark Rothko, Diego Rivera, Gertrude Murphy and Wayne Thiebaud. She also modeled for art school classes at the San Francisco Art Institute, University of California-Berkeley, Stanford University, the California College of Arts and Crafts and Mills College. Allen preferred to model in the nude acknowledging that successful modeling was strenuous, involving discipline and thought. As she stated, \\"You can't think with your clothes on.\\" Modeling in the nude also earned her more money; she was paid 75 cents an hour versus 50 cents an hour for clothed modeling. In 1945 she led the founding of the San Francisco Models' Guild, an extant entity currently known as the Bay Area Models' Guild. It was influential for improving the pay for artists models. In 1965 the University of California-San Francisco held an art exhibition titled \\"Florence Allen Herself\\" which showcased Allen's thirty year modelling career. In 1987 she became the Model Coordinator and teacher of the Model Certification Workshop at the California College of the Arts.

Mostly they feed up in the water column on a range of insects including: termites, mayflies, dragonflies, caddisflies, beetles and terrestrial midges. They also feed on the bottom materials like algae.Froese, Rainer, and Auda Ortanez. \\"Luxilus chrysocephalus summary page.\\" FishBase. N.p., n.d. Web. 7 May 2014. . They feed continuously day and night but feed more on the bottom at night. Habitat These shiners can be found in the mid to upper regions of streams and rivers. They can also be found in rocky pools in clear and turbid creeks. Distribution They can be found in the Gulf Coast drainages from Texas to Alabama and upwards to Tennessee. Striped shiners can be found in the Great Lakes, New York and Wisconsin. Reproduction and Life Cycle The breeding season of striped shiners occurs from March to July but can extend into October. During this time male and female colours change from silver to gold and all fins change to orange with the exception of their tail, They spawn in shallow waters over gravelly bottom streams with depressions and over other fishes nests. The males make the depressions by pushing the gravel out with their nose or picking up pieces with their mouths. Males are aggressive towards other males and may bite or attack them with the breeding tubercles they develop on the head and body. The males swim down and tilt to the side while the females swim up along the side of the males. The males then swing their caudal peduncle onto the females back. This posture lasts for several seconds but may be interrupted by other aggressive males. Etymology Luxilus is derived from lux meaning \\"light\\" and illus meaning \\"little\\" while chrysocephalus means \\"golden head\\".

It is common in the upper Tennessee River basin as well as in the Savannah River, the Santee River, and the New River in North Carolina. Adults have a mean length of and can reach a maximum length of . The maximum age reported for this species is 4 years. Warpaint shiners live in cool streams with gravel and rubble beds. They feed on aquatic insect larvae and on terrestrial insects they catch on the water surface. The warpaint shiner provides forage for sport fish such as small and large mouth bass. Importantly the warpaint shiner acts as host to the federally endangered freshwater mussels known as heelsplitters. Range and breeding Warpaint shiners were originally found only in the Tennessee River drainage. Due to human activity, the species has been introduced into the Upper Savannah, the Santee, and the New River drainages.Jenkins, R., N. Burkhead (1993) Freshwater Fishes of Virginia. Bethseda, Maryland: American Fisheries Society. Warpaint shiners inhabit moderate to high gradient creeks, streams, and rivers with clear, cool water where they feed on aquatic insects.Outten, L. (1957) \\"A Study of the Life History of the Cyprinid Fish Notropis Coccogenis.\\" Journal of the Elisha Mitchell Science Society, 73: 68‚Äì84. Their life expectancy is from two to four years during which they grow to between 65 mm and 95 mm in length. The breeding season for warpaint shiners spans from May to June, during which time an individual will produce an average of 750 offspring. Importantly the warpaint shiner acts as host to the federally endangered freshwater mussels known as heelsplitters. Heelsplitter populations have been adversely affected by human activities, such as the construction of dams and the pollution and siltation resulting from large scale agriculture. Heelsplitters have been extirpated from much of their native range. This mussel species depends on the warpaint shiner to act as a host to larval mussels that attach to the fish gills during their maturation. Further information is needed to establish the importance of the warpaint shiner as a species, and how it should be managed and protected.  Geographic distribution of species  The warpaint shiner is indigenous to the Upper Tennessee River drainage, Western Virginia, Western North Carolina, Northern Georgia and Northern Alabama. It may also be found in adjacent tributaries of the Savannah River in North Carolina and South Carolina,Page, L.M. and B.M. Burr (1991) A field guide to freshwater fishes of North America north of Mexico. Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. 432 p. the Catawba, Savannah, and Broad River drainages. Warpaint shiners have been introduced (it is suspected due to bait bucket release) in the New River drainage in North Carolina and Virginia, and the Santee drainage in South Carolina.Menhinick, E. F. (1991) The freshwater fishes of North Carolina. North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. Raleigh, NC. The impact of these introductions is not known. The warpaint shiner is listed as ‚Äúpresent and probably introduced‚Äù in the Kanawha River drainage, above the falls.Hocutt, C.H., R.E. Jenkins, and J.R. Stauffer, Jr. (1986) \\"Zoogeography of the Fishes of the Central Appalachians and Central Atlantic Coastal Plain\\". In C.H. Hocutt and E.O. Wiley (eds.) The Zoogeography of North American Freshwater Fishes. pp. 161‚Äì212. The warpaint shiner persists in its historical range although populations have been negatively affected by damming activity, siltation, and pollution in some locations and are currently threatened in Alabama.  Ecology  Adult warpaint shiners are a pelagic freshwater fish found in rubble and gravel riffles and the pools of fast creeks with high clarity. They prefer cool, clear, and small to medium-sized rivers and streams with rocky substrates. The warpaint shiner is an insectivore. During the spring the warpaint shiner uses its large terminal mouth to primarily feed on aquatic insect larva from the order Ephemeroptera, such as mayfly nymphs. During the summer warpaint shiners feed mostly terrestrial insects, taken at the surface belonging to the orders Hymenoptera and Coleoptera. Largemouth bass and smallmouth bass are the two primary predators of the warpaint shiner. Associates of the warpaint shiner include the saffron shiner and the river chub. These small forage fish are often found together in small schools. Warpaint shiners have been observed spawning over the circular nests of the river chub. The warpaint shiner's dependence on clear running water and a rocky substrate to spawn successfully makes it susceptible to the slowing or stopping of rivers and streams by dams and the siltation resulting from river bank destabilization due to farming operations and land development.Herbert, Matthew E.; Frances P. Gelwick and W. L. Montgomery (2003) \\"Spatial Variation of Headwater Fish Assemblages Explained by Hydrologic Variability and Upstream Effects of Impoundment\\". Copeia, 2: 273‚Äì284. Life history Warpaint shiners reach sexual maturity at two years of age spawning for the first time in their third summer. Spawning occurs in clear running water over the margins of circular rock nests constructed by river chubs and takes place in May and June. Males will hover over the nest in groups of eight to ten with the largest male at the front. Females approach from behind the males and they pair off and settle into a crevice where sperm and eggs are released. Other males will crowd around a spawning pair and attempt to fertilize the eggs. There is no parental care after spawning. Each spawning can result in 300 to 1600 offspring. Warpaint shiners in the wild live to be around four years of age, slightly longer lifespans have been recorded for specimens in captivity. Current management Currently there are no active management initiatives specifically for the warpaint shiner. Though the warpaint shiner is considered a ‚Äúspecial concern‚Äù in parts of Alabama and South Carolina, global populations are considered stable and secure. Habitat destruction resulting from deforestation, loss of riparian cover, siltation and the creation of impoundments pose the greatest risk to the warpaint shiner.Sutherland, A. B., J. L. Meyer, and E. P. Gardiner (2002) \\"Effects of land cover on sediment regime and fish assemblage structure in four southern Appalachian streams\\". Freshwater Biology, 47: 1791‚Äì1805. The warpaint shiner is not a valued sport or pan fish and the population is relatively stable in most of its range. The management measures necessary to preserve these fish are beneficial not only to the warpaint shiner but to a myriad of stream dwelling fishes. The warpaint shiner also provides important forage for very popular sport fish such as the largemouth bass and smallmouth bass. Additionally, the warpaint shiner is known to be a host for the Tennessee heelsplitter, a federally endangered freshwater mussel.Steg, M. (1998) \\"Identification of Host Fish and Experimental Culture of Juveniles for Selected Freshwater Mussel Species in Virginia.\\" Master's Thesis, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 0: 79. In their larval stage these mussels are parasitic and need to attach to the gills or fins of fish in order to mature into juveniles. Because freshwater mussels are the most endangered category of animals in North America, the protection of the fishes that act as hosts for the mussel larva is essential for the recovery of the species.

As required by the 114th article of the Constitution of Turkey, the calling of a snap general election by the President necessitates the forming of an interim election government, in which all parties represented in Parliament are given a certain number of ministers according to how many MPs they have. If a party refused to send ministers to the interim cabinet, then independents must take their place. As an independent politician, Top√ßu was appointed as the Minister of Culture and Tourism by Davutoƒülu on 28 August 2015, a move which came as a general surprise to many political observers and commentators.http://www.haber3.com/gecici-kabinenin-en-supriz- ismi-3547242h.htm See also *Felicity Party *Turkish nationalism References External links *Collection of all relevant news items at Haberler.com Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:People from Ardahan Category:Great Unity Party politicians Category:Leaders of political parties in Turkey Category:Members of the 63rd government of Turkey Category:Turkish civil servants Category:Ministers of Culture and Tourism of Turkey ","title":"Yal√ßƒ±n Top√ßu"},{"id":"32107227","text":"Craig Hill may refer to: * Craig Hill (actor) (1926‚Äì2014), American film actor * Craig Hill (comedian), Scottish comedian, TV presenter and actor * Craig Hill (rugby union) (born 1982), Welsh rugby union player * Craig Hill (soccer) (born 1987), American soccer player * Craig Hill (footballer) (born 1991), Northern Irish footballer * Craig L.

They also have fewer anal fin rays, averaging nine to eleven. Non- breeding males and females still have the silver-blue coloration and the typical cryptic coloration of dark on top and lighter white or cream colored belly.

Retrieved October 27, 2013, from http://www.fishbase.org.summary/62431 Scarlet shiners thrive in waterways that have clear water, and they tend to occupy the higher gradient streams with coarser substrates. Typically, the scarlet shiner's habitat is situated around the Ohio River basin, but they range down as far as Eagle Creek in Kentucky.Hopkins II, R. L.; Eisenhour, D. J.; Hopman, L. J.; Peyton, D. K. (2009). Morphological analysis of a hybrid minnow swarm. Northeastern Naturalist, 16 (4), 621-192 The species can be found specifically in the southwestern part of Ohio down to the Scioto River and westward, reaching the Little River basin in Tennessee then connecting to the Tennessee River to flow down into the northernmost parts of Alabama and some areas within West Virginia and Virginia.Nico, L. (2013). Lythrurus fasciolaris. U.S. Department of Interior: U.S. Geological Survey. Retrieved October 27, 2013, from https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=567 Scarlet shiners have also been thought to be introduced in certain waterways in Ohio, such as the Ohio River basin to the Muskingum River drainage. Other areas where one may encounter scarlet shiners are in the Cumberland drainages in Kentucky and Tennessee along with the ones in Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia.  Ecology  Adult scarlet shiners typically feed on aquatic invertebrates. There are a variety of species that the scarlet shiner is a natural host for, such as for the glochidia of the Pyramid Pigtoe mollusk in Kentucky.Culp, J.; Shepherd, A. C.; McGregor, M. A. (2009). Fish hosts and conglutinates of the pyramid pigtoe (Pleurobema rubrum). Southeastern Naturalist 8 (1): 19-22 Scarlet shiners inhabit small to medium-sized sluggish to clear-water streams where the substrate is coarser, such as rocks, pebbles, or gravel, with medium current flow.Schade, J.; Stallsmith, B. (2012). Investigation of the relationship between the steroid hormone 11-ketotestosterone and reproductive status in the fish Lythrurus fasicolaris. The American Midland Naturalist, 168 (1), 218-230 Though this species can tolerate a little murky water, they cannot survive in water that is heavy in silt or sediment, which deprives them and their eggs of oxygen. They are intolerant to high turbidity, siltation, and low-dissolved oxygen levels. In midwinter, scarlet shiners inhabit deeper, quieter pools of water. Predators of the scarlet shiner are bigger fish, like trout, that inhabit the same streams they do. Often, scarlet shiners are absent from waters hosting trout, especially those at high elevations. Competitors of the scarlet shiner are other fish that inhabit the same stream waters it does. A few examples are the striped shiner (Luxilus chrysocephalus), bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus), and the telescope shiner (Notropis telescopes).Holmes, B.; Whittington, L.; Marino, L.; Adrian, A.; Stallsmith, B. (2010). Reproductive timing of the telescope shiner, Notropis telescopus, in Alabama, USA. The American Midland Naturalist, 163 (2), 326-334 The main competitor of the scarlet shiner is the closely related species, the redfin shiner (Lythrurus umbratilis). They tend to inhabit the same types of waterways, though the redfin shiner habits clearer and lower located streams. Abundance of scarlet shiners populations reduce when silt deposits from human development of land near their streams are above their tolerance levels. Introduction of invasive species, like rainbow trout, to various streams by humans have caused for decline or fragmentation of scarlet shiner populations across their geographical distribution. However, the scarlet shiner has also been introduced in areas where it is not native, more often in Ohio areas.  Life history  Scarlet shiners are seasonal spawners that spawn once throughout the late spring and summer months over clean sand or fine gravel substrates in faster currents of riffles and pools. On occasions, scarlet shiners have been known to use the nest of larger minnows for their own offspring. Their nests are similar to other Lythurus species. Like many species, the scarlet shiner undergoes sexual dimorphism during the breeding months, in which breeding males often have a bright blue, shiny coloration with their bright red fins while females have red fins that are much less visible than the males. The average life span of scarlet shiners is three years. After their first year, they are reproductively mature or capable. However, reproductive success depends on the environmental conditions since scarlet shiners undergo physiological changes and reproductive traits and behaviors in response to these conditions. Populations of scarlet shiners remain relatively stable or somewhat declining after spawning periods. A decline in number can be traced back to being introduced into larger bodies of water, where schools are often smaller, or an increase in predators or invasive species that compete with the species for resources. Siltation of stream waters also decreases the number of scarlet shiners since heavy silt can suffocate their eggs, reducing their reproductive success. Another reason that could decline their numbers is a change in the environment. If the environment is not the right temperature for the scarlet shiners during their spawning season, then they will not spawn until the water reaches their favorable temperature.  Management  Currently, scarlet shiners are a least concern species. States with scarlet shiner populations have begun actively researching the species to collect more data on it, such as Kentucky and Ohio, where they are native and introduced respectively. Scarlet shiners were never an endangered or threatened species since their numbers have been relatively stable or increasing in areas where they are native or introduced, where they have become problematic in some areas. Problematic areas include Lake Barkley in Kentucky, a human created lake, where scarlet shiner and other fish populations become abundant due to the recent construction of the lake which increases biodiversity at certain times during the seasons. However, at other times, the lake causes species biodiversity to degrade due to hydrologic regimes, channel morphology, high siltation, nutrient loading, low-dissolved oxygen, and high turbidity, which many species cannot tolerate.Hendricks, S.; Timmons, T. (2008). Fish species of the Little River basin, Western Kentucky, 2000-2003. Journal of the Kentucky Academy of Science, 69 (2): 187-192 Though the species is listed as least concern, scarlet shiners do have the tendency to hybridize with its close relative, the redfin shiner, in areas where their populations mix, like the Little River basin in Kentucky. The hybridization is a result of the introduction of scarlet shiners into streams where they were previously never found, allowing for them to interact with the redfin shiner and cross-breed with them.Hopkins II, R. L.; Eisenhour, D. J. (2008). Hybridization of Lythrurus fasciolaris and Lythrurus umbratilis (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae) in the Ohio River basin. Copeia 2008 (1): 162-171 There has not been significant research done to determine if this hybridization will cause for either species' abundance to decline since both can be found in isolated areas where their numbers are stable or abundant. Taxonomy Lythrurus fasciolaris was originally named by Gilbert in 1891 as a subspecies of Notropis umbratilis but in 1996 it was named as a valid spcecies. The type species for the genus Lythrurus is Semotilus diplemia but when you follow the synonymy of this name then it is currently recognised as a synonym of Chrosomus erythrogaster. When Jordan coined Lythrurus it is now thought he may have been referring to the species named by Rafinesque as Rutilus ruber as he notes that the species he describes as Lythrurus diploemus is Rafinesque's Ruitlis ruber and not Kirtland's Leuciscus diplemius. The Catalog of Fishes gives Rutilus ruber as being a synonym of L. fasciolaris, albeit with some uncertainty.

The species is that not much data has been collected on in the years past. With a monitoring plan that could change. It is found in three main states Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia. In Tennessee and Alabama the species is located in common rivers, and in Virginia the species can be found in drainages in Virginia, Tennessee and Northwestern Georgia. In addition, the species is nearly restricted to the Coosa River system above the Fall Line in the Alabama River drainage. The environment of the species is fresh benthopelagic water, and lives in a temperate range, 38¬∞N-33¬∞N.Lythrurus Lirus, Mountain Shiner. http://www.fishbase.org/summary/2873. Lythrurus lirus typically prefers clear flowing creeks and/or small rivers. These waters typically have moderate gradients and bottom materials that range from sand- gravel to rubble-boulders. The population of this species is represented by large subpopulations and locations. However, the total adult population is not known specifically, it is speculated to be large.The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/202146/0. The normal length of the species is typically 6 cm but it has been recorded that the maximum length to me 7.5 cm, which was a male. The peak of their mating season is between the months of May and June.Facts about Mountain Shiner (Lythrurus lirus). http://eol.org/pages/217918/details. The threat of the species is more localized than any other type of threat. However, on a wide- range threat level no threat is actually known to the Lythrurus lirus. Currently the species is on a low conservation concern and is not in any dire significant need of managing or monitoring at the moment. Geographic distribution The species of the genus Lythrurus are commonly found in small streams that are distributed mainly in drainages of the Gulf Coast, locations in the Mississippi Valley, and the Piedmont region of the Atlantic Seaboard. The mountain shiner normally located above the Fall Line in Tennessee region, and prefers freshwaters that are of temperate climate. The geographical range which it inhabits is from 38¬∞N to 33¬∞N. Now, the exact population size is not known, however, it is assumed to be fairly large. The temporal variation of population size could be subjected to extrinsic factors. An example of this for the population size variance would be the annual, seasonal and even daily level changes that occur in aquatic systems. These fluctuations are a possibly explanation of why there are sometimes subpopulations that are isolated from other populations within the same river or streams.C. Alana Tibbets and Thomas E. Dowling Evolution, Vol. 50, No. 3 (Jun., 1996). Effects of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors on Population Fragmentation in Three Species of North American Minnows (Teleostei: Cyprinidae):1280-1292. These fluctuations would explain the distribution of some of the populations to be scattered within the regions that it inhabits and also the same rivers and streams of different populations. Ecology It prefers benthopelagic freshwater. These waters are typically clear flowing, riffle-type creeks, streams or small rivers. Which these types of waters can range from sand-gravel to rubble-boulder bottoms, and contains moderate levels of gradients. The mountain shiner and the redfin shiner are considered \\"sister taxa\\". Since these two species are sister taxa it is safely assumed that they both have similar feeding habits and most likely feed on the same organisms.ARKive. http://www.arkive.org/redfin- shiner/lythrurus-umbratilis/ . Now the competition of the mountain shiner consists of mainly of the other species within the same subpopulation of Lythrurus and also other species like darters that are located within the same region. The main predators of this species are larger taxa of fish, which include the different species of trout. Life history Little data has been recorded on the life history, specifically, but data has been collected on its size, spawning and migrating patterns. The mountain shiner is a native species to North American and is not documented in other countries. According to a paper done by Shmidt, he states that the maximum length for most species in the genus Lythrurus is less than 70mm. For the mountain shiner specifically, the average adult size is between 35-55mm.Mountain Shiners in Alabama. http://www.outdooralabama.com/fishing/freshwater/fish/other/minnow/shiner/mountain/ . However, some male specimens have been documented to reach a maximum size of 75 mm (Facts about mountain shiner). This rare maximum length could be due to the environment as well as nutrients that are available and maybe limited pressure from predators within the aquatic system. The typically mating season for the mountain shiner is in between the time span of May and can end between the months of June/July, depending on location. Now the species does make seasonal migrations throughout the year. However these migrations are not of extensive distances. They travel approximately less than 200 km from their original location. The locations that they will migrate to are normally for either breeding or are winter grounds for hibernation. Current management Currently, mountain shiners are a least concern species on the red list. With its status as a low conservation concern, the species does not have any significantly required management or monitoring. However, some research actions are being conducted on the species. The mountain shiner though has some localized threats that are not a major problem for the species as a whole. However, there seems to be an active production of research to collect more data to help better understand the patterns and habits of this species that is common in approximately 3 states. Even though the species was never listed as a truly endangered species on the Red list, it was listed as low concern species. The main assumption for a problem towards the species is human interference. One reason for this would be our morphology of the habitats. This can occur with the reduction of streams, dams placed changing the flow of streams connected to rivers and containments that we introduce to the aquatic systems from run off from agriculture lands. These are just a few ideas of what could be the reason for the reduction of the populations due to human interference rather than the natural course of fluctuating water levels that was mention before.

The redfin shiner is most commonly found in the Ohio and Mississippi River basins, as well as in drainages of the Great Lakes, all of which are in the United States. The diet of the redfin shiner consists mostly of algae and small insects. This species prefers calm water in low-gradient streams over substrates of gravel or sand with some vegetation. Description The average adult redfin shiner is long. The redfin shiner is easily identifiable with its deeply compressed body, large eyes and attractive colors. Its body is a light olive color with a dusky stripe along the spine of the fish. The sides often appear very silvery with a reddish tint in the breeding males. Geographic distribution and habitat The redfin shiner occurs in the Great Lakes and their tributaries, as well as in the Mississippi River Basin; and south throughout the Ohio and Mississippi River basins west to Texas. These river systems are considered the geographic range of the species; however, the distribution throughout specific streams is still largely unknown.Eisenhour, David J., and Lynn V. Eisenhour. \\"Clinal Variation in Ohio River Basin Populations of the Redfin Shiner (Lythrurus Umbratilis)\\"]. Northeastern Naturalist 14(4):519-530. 2007. The species is most prominent in small- to medium-sized streams in a variety of ecological settings. The redfin shiner can be found anywhere from slow moving bays to high-gradient upland streams.Nelson, SS, and WL Pflieger. \\"Redescription of the redfin shiner, Notropis umbratilis, and its subspecies in the central Mississippi River Basin\\". Copeia' 1975:231-249. The species is generally considered to be a pool dweller, and can potentially be found in any streams in these systems that contains large, slow-moving pools. These slow moving pools are considered their microhabitat since they spend much of their lives in these same relatively small areas. The species prefer pools with a temperature near and a neutral pH. They also tend to favor calm water in low-gradient streams over sand or gravel substrates with some vegetation.Jennifer B. Pramuk et al. \\"Phylogeny of finescale shiners of the genus Lythrurus (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae) inferred from four mitochondrial genes\\". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 2007 Feb;42(2):287-97. While redfin shiners prefer calm slow moving pools, they can tolerate some faster moving water. Ecology The redfin shiner is a surface feeder, mainly preying on aquatic and terrestrial insects and other small invertebrates but will often feed extensively on algae. The species is not particular on its diet, feeding mostly on whatever is available. The redfin shiner has numerous competitors which it has to outcompete for resources such as food and spawning grounds. In the competition for food, the redfin shiner competes most directly with other members of the genus Lythrurus as well as with numerous other members of the order Cypriniformes. In addition to having numerous competitors, the redfin shiner also has a large number of predators. Predators of this species consist of almost any piscivorous fish species that have a jaw gape large enough to fit the 3.5-inch redfin shiner. Redfin shiners are an important species since they are a significant part of the diet of numerous game fish in the eastern United States. Other predators consist of any mammals, reptiles, and birds that feed on small fish in the areas that the redfin shiner inhabits. Life history Redfin shiners reach sexually maturity at the age of two to three years. Most individuals of this species only spawn one summer since the life span of this fish is only three years. Spawning occurs from the beginning of June through the middle of August in shallow sunfish nests. The redfin shiner spawns at the same time and in the same locations as many sunfish species. While redfin shiners and sunfish, most often the green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus), are able to coexist, they still compete against each other for space on the spawning beds.\\"Redfin Shiner Fact Sheet\\". NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation. Accessed 16 Nov. 2013. Redfin shiners and sunfish are able to coexist on these beds made by the sunfish during the spawn. Average clutch size is not known since the species has been studied very little; however, it is expected that their clutch size would be similar to other members of the family Cyprinidae. Redfin shiners' use of sunfish beds is the primary microhabitat used for breeding. Sunfish beds are utilized because they offer a safe silt-free location where eggs can hatch. Sunfish tend to use sand and gravel when making their nests, which facilitates the protection and viability of redfin shiner eggs by concealing them as well as keeping them up out of the silt. Another great advantage to laying eggs in an occupied sunfish nest is that the sunfish are already there protecting their own eggs. The presence of redfin shiners does not seem to bother the sunfish. Since there is a real lack of research on this species, there are no known human induced activities influencing the species‚Äô life history.M. Melissa Matthews and David C. Heins. \\"Life History of the Redfin Shiner, Notropis umbratilis (Pisces: Cyprinidae), in Mississippi.\\" Copeia 1984:2 (May 1, 1984), pp. 385-390 Management There are not any current management efforts being enacted for the species. This is because the redfin shiner is believed to be sustaining its populations in most of its native range. There are not any real threats, human induced or otherwise, that have been linked to adversely affecting the species. Due to the fact that populations have sustained in most areas this species is not listed as state or federally endangered in any of its geological range. While there are no large-scale threats to the species, localized threats such as habitat destruction could cause a decline in some tributaries. The only human use for the redfin shiner is as bait in the recreational fishing industry. While the species is sometimes used as bait, it is not among the most common species used as bait.

Kaler (born September 23, 1956) is a chemical engineer, professor and former university administrator. From 2011 to 2019, Kaler served as the 16th president of the University of Minnesota before returning to scientific research and teaching in the University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering in January 2021. Before coming to Minnesota, Kaler served from 2007 to 2011 as provost and senior vice president for academic affairs and vice president for Brookhaven affairs at Stony Brook University, New York. In the latter role he oversaw interactions with Brookhaven National Laboratory, which Stony Brook University co-manages with Battelle Memorial Institute. In July 2018, Kaler announced that he plans to resign as president of the university at the end of academic year effective July 2019, one year before his contract is supposed to expire. Kaler plans to return to the Chemical Engineering faculty. Joan Gabel was appointed in December 2018 and succeeded Kaler as President on July 1, 2019.  Early life and education  Kaler was born in Burlington, Vermont, in 1956 as an only child in a military family that moved around a lot while his father served as a noncommissioned officer in the United States Air Force. Kaler received his B.S. (1978) from California Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. in chemical engineering (1982) from the University of Minnesota under the direction of H. T. Davis and L. E. Scriven.  Career  He was an assistant professor (1982‚Äì87) and associate professor (1987‚Äì89) of chemical engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. He joined the chemical engineering faculty of the University of Delaware in 1989 and was promoted to professor in 1991. He was named the Elizabeth Inez Kelley professor of chemical engineering in 1998, and was chair of the chemical engineering department from 1996 to 2000. He served as dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Delaware from 2000 to 2007 before moving on to Stony Brook to become Provost. He was a visiting professor at the University of Graz, Austria in 1995.  Priorities and initiatives  When Eric Kaler took office on July 1, 2011, he became only the second alumnus to rise to the position of University of Minnesota president. In his first year on the job, Kaler emphasized his commitment to academic excellence and rigor by investing in new faculty positions. He stressed the importance of the University's groundbreaking research enterprise. He led a campaign to contain costs and operate the University more efficiently and effectively, with the goal of freeing up resources for the University's core teaching, research, and public engagement and service mission. He acted on a pledge to keep the University accessible to students of all economic backgrounds by increasing financial aid and limiting the University's 2012 tuition increase to the smallest this century.http://www.startribune.com/local/158267945.html?refer=y In his second academic year, Kaler and the University, in partnership with the Minnesota Legislature, froze tuition for Minnesota-resident students. He proposed a set of innovative tax and tuition relief initiatives to aid students, their families, and donors, and also proposed performance measures that the University must meet to gain some of its state support. The State of Minnesota also invested in a new research program known as MnDRIVE, in the amount of about $18 million per year. MnDRIVE in its first funding cycle, was focused on research around clean water, robotics, neuroscience, and food. That request was expected to be heard by the DFL Party controlled Minnesota Legislature and Governor Mark Dayton during its 2013 session. Kaler's outreach to the Minnesota business community has earned him and the University recognition by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the White House. In 2012, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano named Kaler to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Academic Advisory Council.  Challenges and controversies  Kaler was appointed President of the University of Minnesota after Robert Bruininks during a period of decreased funding from the state legislature to the University of Minnesota. During his first year in office the state legislature reduced appropriations to higher education down to a level that were equivalent to the funding amounts from 1998. In 2012, the Minnesota Daily, the University student newspaper, criticized the University athletic department, under then-Athletic Director Norwood Teague, for deciding to spend $800,000 to reschedule a football game with North Carolina to increase the football team's rankings. The University of Minnesota was recently profiled in a Wall Street Journal analysis of higher education spending and mismanagement. According to the Journal, the University of Minnesota salary and employment records from 2001 through the spring of 2012 show that the University system added more than 1,000 administrators over that period. Their ranks grew 37%, more than twice as fast as the teaching corps and nearly twice as fast as the student body, the Journal reported.https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB20001424127887323316804578161490716042814 Growing under previous president Robert Bruininks, the Journal reported that under Kaler the University of Minnesota has the largest share of employees classified as \\"executive and managerial\\" among the nation's 72 \\"very-high- research\\" public universities in the 2011‚Äì12 academic year. In the wake of the Wall Street Journal story and a commentary in the Washington Post (that was reprinted in the Minneapolis Star Tribune), Kaler wrote a response, detailing many of the accomplishments of the University in reducing administrative spending and holding down tuition. In it, Kaler wrote: \\"The articles did not report that, despite stunning state disinvestment, the university is more productive than at any time in recent history.\\"  Research and publications  Kaler's research interests are in surfactant and colloid science, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and materials synthesis. His work has focused on complex fluids, which are characterized by changes of composition or density over length scales comparable to molecular dimensions. Examples are liquid crystals, microemulsions and micelles, some polymeric solutions, vesicles, emulsions, and protein solutions. He has supervised 37 Ph.D. students and numerous postdoctoral researchers, and has served as a consultant to numerous industrial laboratories and legal firms. Kaler is coeditor of the book Giant Micelles and is author or coauthor of more than 200 papers. He holds 10 U.S. patents.  Awards and activities  Kaler received one of the first Presidential Young Investigator Awards from the National Science Foundation in 1984 and has received numerous awards for his research, including the American Chemical Society (ACS) Award in Colloid or Surface Chemistry in 1998. He became a fellow of both the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2001 and the ACS in 2010. He has served in a variety of positions in several professional societies, including the leadership ladder in the ACS Division of Colloid and Surface Chemistry, of which he was chair in 2006. He was cochair of both the 1997 and 2007 Colloid Symposia, held at the University of Delaware. He has chaired or cochaired three Gordon Research Conferences. Kaler was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Engineering in 2010. Among other leadership activities, Kaler is a member of the Guthrie Theater Board, the co-chair of Generation Next ‚Äî which is a community partnership committed to closing the education achievement gap ‚Äî Chair of the NCAA Division I Board of Directors, and Chair of the Big Ten Council of Presidents and Chancellors. In April 2014 Kaler was named to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the nation's most prestigious honorary societies. He was elected in two categories: for his work as a chemical engineer and as a higher education administrator.  References   External links  Eric W.

The Gothic town hall built from the 13th century is one of the main landmarks of the city. The Old Town Hall's long history reflects developments that have taken place in the city since its initial construction. The town hall serves the city of Wroclaw and is used for civic and cultural events such as concerts held in its Great Hall. In addition, it houses a museum and a basement restaurant. History Old Town Hall at night Old Town Hall, west elevation. The bright building on the left is New Town Hall built in 1860-1864 Old Town Hall in 1800 Old Town Hall in 1900 Old Town Hall in 1945 Clock, east elevation The town hall was developed over a period of about 250 years, from the end of 13th century to the middle of 16th century. The structure and floor plan changed over this extended period in response to the changing needs of the city. The exact date of the initial construction is not known. However, between 1299 and 1301 a single- storey structure with cellars and a tower called the consistory was built. The oldest parts of the current building, the Burghers‚Äô Hall and the lower floors of the tower, may date to this time. In these early days the primary purpose of the building was trade rather than civic administration activities. Between 1328 and 1333 an upper storey was added to include the Council room and the Aldermen‚Äôs room. Expansion continued during the 14th century with the addition of extra rooms, most notably the Court room. The building became a key location for the city‚Äôs commercial and administrative functions. The 15th and 16th centuries were times of prosperity for Wroc≈Çaw as was reflected in the rapid development of the building during that period. The construction program gathered momentum, particularly from 1470 to 1510, when several rooms were added. The Burghers‚Äô Hall was re-vaulted to take on its current shape, and the upper story began to take shape with the development of the Great Hall and the addition of the Treasury and Little Treasury. Further innovations during the 16th century included the addition of the city‚Äôs Coat of arms (1536), and the rebuilding of the upper part of the tower (1558‚Äì59). This was the final stage of the main building program. By 1560, the major features of today‚Äôs Old Town Hall were established. The rapid development of the city meant that the Town Hall had to accommodate more administrative functions. During the 17th century, the allocation of space within the building was changed to ensure that all the town offices could be housed there. The ground floor was allocated for military purposes and the general public had access only to the basement, where alcohol was served. The second half of the 17th century was a period of decline for the city, and this decline was reflected in the Old Town Hall. Perhaps by way of compensation, efforts were made to enrich the interior decorations of the hall. In 1741, Wroc≈Çaw became a part of Prussia, and the power of the City diminished. Much of the Town Hall was allocated to administering justice. During the 19th century there were two major changes. The courts moved to a separate building, and the Town Hall became the site of the city council and supporting functions. There was also a major program of renovation because the building had been neglected and was covered with creeping vines. The town hall now has several en-Gothic features including some sculptural decoration from this period. In the early years of the 20th century improvements continued with various repair work and the addition of the Little Bear statue in 1902. During the 1930s, the official role of the Town Hall was reduced and it was converted into a museum. Toward the end of World War II, the Town Hall suffered minor damage ‚Äì an aerial bomb pierced the roof (but did not explode) and some sculptural elements were lost. Restoration work began in the 1950s following a period of research, and this conservation effort continued throughout the 20th century. It included refurbishment of the clock on the east facade. Today, the Old Town Hall is open to visitors as the Museum of Bourgeois Art and is also the venue for temporary exhibitions and cultural events. Architecture and Chambers The Old Town Hall sits in the Market square at an angle. It is considered as a fine example of bourgeois Gothic architecture. Originally, it was a single story building and was expanded over the years. The current form dates from the late 15th century with ornaments on the Eastern and Southern facades. The entrance is from the western side and it leads into the Burghers‚Äô Hall. The Burghers‚Äô Hall dates from the turn of the 14th century when it housed public gatherings and ceremonies. It was later used for commercial purposes. Today, it includes a map of Wroclaw (a modern copy of a 16th-century map). The next room is the Aldermans‚Äô Hall, also known as the Court Room. It dates from 1299, and was used by members of the municipality. It has a special podium for the administration of justice. Beyond that lies the Council Chamber, dating from the first half of the 14th century. Here, important city decisions were made and you can find a Renaissance portal from 1528, probably painted by Andreas Walter. Until 1945, this room was richly decorated but some of the elements, such as wood paneling, furniture, and paintings, have been irretrievably lost. The wall paintings and baroque cocklestove, however, have survived. Next is the Council Office, where the council secretary and receiver once worked. This was a popular office for clerks and was seen as a high-status profession. Architecturally, it still has its padded doors from 1429 and portraits of eminent town councilors. Upstairs is the Grand Hall, which dates from the second half of the 15th century. Here, official ceremonies took place.

Pratt House, also known as Ship on the Desert (sometimes hyphenated), was the residence of Wallace Pratt in what is now Guadalupe Mountains National Park in far western Texas. Pratt, a petroleum geologist for the Humble Oil & Refining Company, had previously built the Wallace Pratt Lodge in McKittrick Canyon a couple of miles to the north in the Guadalupe Mountains. Finding the cabin site to be remote and prone to being cut off by flooding, Pratt started construction of a new, modern residence on the east slope of the mountains. Work on the residence started in 1941. The house was designed by Long Island architect Newton Bevin, who lived for a time at the site with his wife, and built by contractor Ed Birdsall. Work was stopped by World War II, but resumed in 1945 and was completed the same year. In contrast to Pratt's rustic canyon cabin, the house, which Pratt named the Ship On The Desert, is an International Style house with horizontal lines and extensive glazing. Only wide and long, the house provides broad views to the east over the plains and the west to the mountains. The majority of the house is on a single level, with a \\"captain's bridge\\" over the dining room giving access to a rooftop terrace. A detached garage contained a guest bedroom. Apart from glass, the predominant material was local limestone in several shades. right left Pratt and his wife, Iris, lived at the Ship On The Desert until 1963, when Pratt's health dictated a move to Tucson, Arizona. The house was donated to the new park along with of lands in the northern part of the proposed park by the Pratts between 1959 and 1961. It was used as a residence for National Park Service employees. The house is occasionally open for tours sponsored by the National Park Service.

Music is by Nisar Bazmi.  Plot  Umrao Jaan is born as Amiran () to a modest family in Faizabad, India. After the criminal Dilawar Khan is released from jail he decides to get revenge as her father had earlier testified against him in court. Khan kidnaps Amiran and decides to sell her in Lucknow. She is imprisoned with another girl, Ram Dai, but the two are separated when Dilawar Khan takes her to Lucknow. There she is sold for 150 rupees to Khanum Jaan, the head tawaif of a kotha. She is renamed Umrao and begins to study classical music and dance. Together with the other apprentice tawaif and Gauhar Mirza, the mischievous illegitimate son of a local Nawab, she is taught to read and write in both Urdu and Persian. As Umrao grows up, she is surrounded by a culture of luxury, music and poetry. She eventually gains her first client, (earning her the suffix of jaan) but prefers the impoverished Gauhar Mirza,as her friend. Umrao Jaan attracts the handsome and wealthy Nawab Sultan. The couple fall in love, but after a jealous customer tries to start a fight with Nawab Sultan, he shoots him and the jealous customer Zabardast Khan dies. He no longer comes to the kotha and Umrao Jaan must meet him secretly, by the help of Gauhar Mirza. As Umrao Jaan continues to see Nawab Sultan and also serve other clients, she supports Gauhar Mirza with her earnings. A new client, the mysterious Faiz Ali, showers Umrao Jaan with jewels and gold, but warns her not to tell anyone about his gifts. When he invites her to travel to Farrukhabad, Khanum Jaan refuses, so Umrao Jaan had to run away. On the way to Farrukhabad, they are attacked by soldiers and Umrao Jaan discovers that Faiz is a dacoit and all of his gifts have been stolen goods. Faiz Ali escapes with his brother Fazl Ali and she is imprisoned, but luckily one of the tawaif from Khanum Jaan's kotha is in the service of the Raja whose soldiers arrested her so Umrao Jaan is freed. As soon as she leaves the Raja's court, Faiz Ali finds her and gets her to come with him. He is soon captured and Umrao Jaan, reluctant to return to Khanum Jaan, sets up as a tawaif in Kanpur. While she is performing in the house of a kindly Begum, armed bandits led by Fazl Ali try to rob the house, but leave when they see that Umrao Jaan is working there. Then Gauhar Mirza comes to Kanpur and she decides to return to the kotha. Umrao Jaan performs at the court of Wajid Ali Shah until the Siege of Lucknow forces her to flee the city for Faizabad. There she finds her mother, but is threatened by her brother who considers her a disgrace and believes she would be better off dead. Devastated, Umrao Jaan returns to Lucknow now that the mutiny is over. She meets the Begum from Kanpur again in Lucknow and discovers that she is actually Ram Dai. By a strange twist of fate Ram Dai was sold to the mother of Nawab Sultan and the two are now married. Another ghost of Umrao Jaan's past is put to rest when Dilawar Khan is arrested and hung for robbery. With her earnings and the gold that Faiz Ali gave her, she is able to live comfortably and eventually retires from her life as a tawaif.

The Libro del Conos√ßimiento de todos los rregnos or Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms, also known as the Book of All Kingdoms, is an anonymous 14th- century Castilian geographical and armorial manual (dated to ca. 1385). It is written in the form of imaginary autobiographical travelogue of a Castilian mendicant friar, as he travels through the entire world, known and fanciful, from the westernmost Atlantic islands, through Europe, Asia, Africa and the Arctic, identifying all the lands, kings, lords and their armorial devices as he passes them. The only explicit information is that the anonymous author claims to have been born in Castile in 1305. The full title is also cited as \\"Book of the Knowledge of all the Kingdoms, Lands and Lordships that are in the World, and the arms and devices of each land and lordship, or of the kings and lords who possess them\\" (Markham 1912). The book's principal objective may have been as an armorial roll. Its choice of presenting itself in the form of an imaginary travelogue may have been whimsical, to tap into the fashionable travel literature of the era, popularized by Marco Polo and John Mandeville. Its geographical features are closely related to those of the Medici Atlas (notionally dated 1351, but probably c.1370). Also near-contemporary is the Catalan Atlas. Four manuscripts of the work are known, designated \\"Z\\", \\"N\\", \\"R\\" and \\"S\\". A manuscript copy of the Libro, once owned by the 16th-century historian Jer√≥nimo Zurita y Castro, and subsequently held by the count of San Clemente in Zaragoza, was reported lost sometime around 1680. It is believed this was the manuscript that resurfaced in London in 1978, popularly known as Manuscript \\"Z\\", currently held by the Bavarian State Library in Munich, as \\"Cod.hisp. 150\\". This manuscript, written in the late 14th century, is replete with miniature illuminations drawn by an Aragonese illustrator. A facsimile was published in 1999. In the introduction to that edition, editor Lacarra doubts the original c.1350 dating, and proposes instead that the Libro was probably composed a bit later, probably around 1385. Manuscripts \\"N\\" and \\"R\\" are kept in the British Library. A further manuscript of the Libro was discovered in 1874 and compiled and published in 1877 in Madrid, by Marcos Jim√©nez de la Espada. This is the most complete of the extant copies, known as Manuscript \\"S\\", kept in the Spanish National Library.El Libro del Conos√ßimiento de todos los rregnos et tierras e se√±or√≠os que son por el mundo et de las se√±ales et armas que han cada tierra y se√±or√≠o por sy y de los reyes y se√±ores que los proueen, escrito por un franciscano espa√±ol √° mediados del siglo XIV (Marcos Jim√©nez de la Espada ed., 1877, Madrid: Impr. de T. Fortanet online) In his introduction, the editor presented the book as an authentic travelogue of a Castilian Franciscan mendicant friar written around 1350. However, immediately upon its appearance, contemporary scholars (not without a touch of mockery at the editor) noted the travelogue was largely fantastical and imaginary, and that there was no clear indication that the author was a friar, Franciscan or otherwise.

It was part of the Jacobite rising of 1715 and pitted Highlanders loyal to the British-Hanoverian Government of George I of Great Britain against Highlanders loyal to the Jacobite House of Stuart. Background William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth, chief of Clan Mackenzie allied himself with John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar who was the leader of the rebel Jacobite army. Mackenzie of Seaforth proceeded to Inverness and took over the town. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet, chief of the rival Clan Munro, who supported the British Government was secretly assembling his clansmen with the intention of taking Inverness. Mackenzie of Seaforth on hearing of this sent out messengers, one of whom met Munro on his march towards Dingwall. He gave Munro the message that \\"he should return home peacefully unless his intention was to throw his lot in with the Jacobites.\\" Munro obliged and returned to his seat at Foulis Castle. The next day Mackenzie of Seaforth set off from Inverness with a large force, leaving his relative John Mackenzie of Coul in control of Inverness. Great expectations were placed on John Gordon, 16th Earl of Sutherland, chief of Clan Sutherland, who like the Munros supported the government. Munro of Foulis had applied to both the Earl of Sutherland and Lord Reay for their support. The Earl of Sutherland gathered his forces and was joined by George Mackay, 3rd Lord Reay, chief of the Clan Mackay and a force from the Clan Ross who also supported the government. They arrived at Alness on 5 October and the Earl reviewed his forces and counted a force of 1800 men. They formed up in order of battle with the Mackays and the Rosses on the right, the Sutherlands in the centre and the Munros on the left. It is said that the Rosses were only armed with sharpened wooden poles as they had previously agreed to give up their weapons to the government. The Munros by contrast had six pieces of cannon, which according to Mackenzie of Seaforth, they had \\"boasted\\" that they would use to batter down his home at Brahan Castle. The conflict Mackenzie of Seaforth on hearing of this gathering that opposed him was determined to disperse it. He had been joined by Sir Donald MacDonald, chief of the Clan MacDonald of Sleat, as well as a number of other clans and proceeded to Alness. Mackenzie‚Äôs force consisted of 3000 men. With this superior force he bore down upon the Earl of Sutherland's camp at Alness. According to one contemporary account, on hearing of the much larger force that opposed them the Earl of Sutherland and Lord Reay retreated to Bonar Bridge with 40 men leaving the rest to make their own way. Only one person died in this encounter. However, Munro of Foulis did not desert his men. The Munros who had also been left behind later marched back to Foulis Castle which had been garrisoned and fortified by Munro‚Äôs father (Sir Robert Munro, 5th Baronet, the blind baron). A force from the Clan Grant who were on their way to support the Earl of Sutherland's force turned back and did not arrive, even though they may have evened the numbers on each side. A council of war A council of war was held between the leaders of the two sides in which the Earl of Sutherland and Lord Reay decided that due to their enemy's superior numbers it would not be wise to fight. However, Munro of Foulis and his cousin George Munro, 3rd of Newmore were up for fighting. Munro of Newmore apparently protested that although the enemy was superior in numbers that it was still their business to fight them because they might have a chance of beating them, and if not they would still be able to \\"scatter\\" them. In a letter from Thomas Robertson in Inverness, dated 30 January 1716, the writer says that Mackenzie of Seaforth demanded hostages to ensure that the Earl of Sutherland and Munro of Foulis would not trouble his lands while he was absent in the south. In the end the pro government clans marched off back to their homes. Aftermath The Munros and Rosses returned home to find that their lands had been plundered. However, according to historian DM Rose, it is proved by contemporary evidence that Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet had greatly exaggerated the excesses that Mackenzie‚Äôs men had committed on his lands. According to Rose an account given by Munro‚Äôs cousin, Munro of Culcairn, is more to be relied on, in which he states: \\"a few men of disreputable character did damage wantonly, and their proceedings are said by Seaforth's enemies to have been countenanced by him\\". However, it was enough for Sir Robert Munro to gather his forces and retaliate in the Siege of Brahan where the Munros and Sutherlanders laid waste to Mackenzie‚Äôs lands at Brahan Castle. This followed the Siege of Inverness (1715) where Mackenzie of Coul had been holding out but was forced to retreat on 13 November and the main Jacobite army, which included Mackenzie of Seaforth was defeated at the Battle of Sheriffmuir on the same day.

It is found on the middle and lower regions of the shore, under stones and in shingle and is common round the coasts of Britain and Ireland. Description Like other ribbon worms, this species is not divided into segments but is long, thin and contractile. It is usually ten to fifteen centimetres long but can extend to thirty centimetres. The head is bluntly pointed and has a slit at the front. It bears many eyes, usually in two groups, but these are hard to see because of the worm‚Äôs colouring and texture. There is an extensible proboscis above the mouth. The head is delineated by a pale streak where it joins the body. The dorsal surface of the body is rounded and brown with longitudinal streaks and a faint iridescence. The ventral surface is off white and flattened.John Barrett and C M Young, Collins Pocket Guide to the Sea Shore (1958) p.48 Distribution and habitat E. neesii is restricted to the Atlantic, Irish Sea and North Sea coasts of Europe. It occurs from Iceland to the Mediterranean Sea. It is found in the littoral zone and at a depth of up to thirty metres. It is usually beneath stones and boulders, in rock crevices and fissures, among the holdfasts of Laminaria, among the byssus threads of Mytilus colonies or on a variety of soft substrates including sand, silty- sand, shelly-gravel and shingle.Marine Species Identification Portal Biology When disturbed, this worm tends to curl up, writhe and wriggle. Movement is performed by small waves of muscular contraction that flow along the body from tail to head. Several waves may occur simultaneously and the worm glides forward slowly and smoothly, the swellings running evenly along the body. It is carnivorous, being both a predator and a scavenger.

Twenty-six copies of the manuscript survive; six of those were copied before 800 CE. It is possible that the penitential, which extends its scope beyond monasticism to include clerics and lay people, has a connection to Saint Boniface and his efforts to reform the Frankish church in the first half of the eighth century. Geographic spread by the end of the eighth century and continued copying of the manuscript into the 9th and 10th centuries have been interpreted to mean the work was considered \\"by the Christian authorities\\" a canonical text. It was used as late as the eleventh century, \\"as the main source of the P. Parisiense compositum\\". Genesis and authorship A penitential is a set of church rules concerning the Christian sacrament of penance; such sets were first developed by Celtic monks in Ireland in the sixth century AD. Unofficial handbooks compiled by monks were authorized by bishops, with the aim of enforcing uniform disciplinary standards within a given district. Notable early Irish penitentials were written by Finnian of Moville and his pupil Columbanus. The practice soon spread to the Anglo-Saxon church and reached the Continent in the eighth and ninth centuries. The Excarpsus Cummeani derives its name from the association with the so-called Penitential of Cummean (c. 650), a series of iudicia', or decisions, on matters of penance, attributed to an Irish abbot named Cummean or Cominianus\\". Though the Excarpsus is not a Roman penitential, it references one‚Äîin fact, however, it cites not a Roman text but the Paenitentiale Theodori (attributed to Theodore of Canterbury), possibly to enhance its status: Theodore, a Greek and originally a Mediterranean monk before he became the eighth Archbishop of Canterbury, took twenty years of knowledge of Roman church and penitential traditions with him when he was sent to Canterbury. Rob Meens refers to the Excarpsus as a \\"tripartite penitential\\", since it \\"draw[s] upon three traditions: Irish, Anglo-Saxon, and Frankish\\". Corbie and Boniface Part 3.1 of the Excarpsus is derived from a collection of canonical judgments called the Iudicium Canonicum, to which are added penances for lay people, subdeacons, and bishops. This expansion meant that the penitential could be used for clerics and lay people as well as monks. Ludger K√∂rntgen argues that such a penitential, which indicates a desire for stricter and practical guidelines especially for clerics, fits well with the kind of reform proposed by Saint Boniface, who had complained in his correspondence (letter from Pope Zachary, 5 November 744) about how the pallium was bestowed‚Äîa matter taken up in the Excarpsus as well as in the Vetus Gallica, which also derives from Corbie. Additional proof for the connection and the role of the penitential in the reform of the Frankish church is provided by the abbot of Corbie: most scholars agree that this abbot, Grimo, is the same Grimo appointed by Boniface as Archbishop of Rouen in 744. Related texts Related texts include a revision of the Collectio Vetus Gallica and the Rheims Penitential.

Emperor Wen believed his son was at fault for Liu Xian's death and did not hold Liu Pi accountable for his aggressive actions. After Crown Prince Qi ascended to the throne and became Emperor Jing of Han, based on the advice from Chao Cuo, Emperor Jing began to centralize power in an attempt to reduce the strength of the regional princes. In 154 BC, Liu Pi convinced six other princes to rebel against the emperor, thereby starting the Rebellion of the Seven States. The emperor appointed Zhou Yafu as commander and he defeated Liu Pi's army. Liu Pi was killed during the battle and his title was abolished.

Predecessor Organisation Having gained consent from the French authorities, in 1939, to establish Flying Training Schools in France, the next step was to construct aerodromes. The RAF approached the army and were rebuffed. As a consequence, No. 1 Air Ministry Works Unit was established, its aim being to manage these construction projects, with French and Belgian civil engineering companies carrying out the construction. The unit was evacuated to the UK following the Fall of France in June 1940. The unit was occupied in overseeing runway repairs for the rest of that year, with some assistance in filling-in craters being provided by the Royal Pioneer Corps. The latter were withdrawn at the end of 1940, which resulted in the RAF forming Nos. 1 & 2 Works Squadrons. By the end of 1941, this had grown to six squadrons and, in July 1942, these units were officially given the title of the RAF Works Service. Airfield Construction Service The service had grown to 19 squadrons and was re-titled RAF Airfield Construction Service in May 1943. The Service was now grouped into Wings, each wing consisting of four squadrons; one plant and three construction. The organisation grew to a point where it employed 30,000 people. It became clear that, when a second front opened in Northern Europe, there would be a need for the services of the ACS to deploy overseas. Acknowledging this, the RAF created No. 85 (Base) Group HQ at the end of 1943, and allocated five of the seven Wings to this Group, which deployed to Normandy after D-Day. It was perceived that the Luftwaffe would not be idle following the landings, and the two remaining wings were to be used repairing damage from Luftwaffe attrition raids. In preparation for the landings, in 1943, the RAF Airfield Construction Service built 23 Advanced Landing Grounds in Southern England. The first overseas deployment was in May 1942 in Iceland, with 5201 Squadron being formed for that task. Similarly, the requirement to build and maintain an airstrip in the Azores saw the formation of 5020 Squadron in September 1943. An eighth Wing (5358) was created for deployment to the Far East, alongside 5353 Wing. Airfield Construction Branch At the time of the Berlin Airlift, the service was renamed the Airfield Construction Branch. Its Wings were responsible for the construction and maintenance of RAF infrastructure in Germany (2nd TAF), until the Wings themselves were disbanded in 1957. The Branch Depot moved three times, starting first at RAF Church Lawford with plant training at Ryton-on-Dunsmore. It then moved to RAF Wellesbourne Mountford, using the sand and gravel quarries at ClaverdonRAF Wellesbourne Mountford before it moved finally with the plant training to RAF Waterbeach. The Squadrons were to support RAF operations in overseas deployments until 1966. = Airfield Construction Squadrons 1951-66 = In November 1951, 5355 Wing was established at RAF Kasfareet, Suez, with Nos. 1 and 2 Squadrons. In June 1953, the Squadrons were renamed respectively Nos 5001 and 5002 Airfield Maintenance Squadrons. 5001 Squadron was based at Kasfareet, 5002 Squadron at RAF Abu Seir. 5002 Squadron was disbanded in October 1955 and in October 1956, it was re-formed at RAF Wellesbourne Mountford to prepare for duty in Egypt in support of British forces following President Nasser's nationalisation of the Suez Canal. The British action in Egypt was halted before the Squadron could be deployed and it was disbanded again in 1958. In May 1954, 5001 was renamed 5001 Airfield Construction (Light) Squadron. In August 1955, it moved to RAF El Adem and in September to RAF Idris at Tripoli. In April 1959, it moved to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. In 1961, 5001 Squadron, based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, had a large, long term detachment at RAF El Adem south of Tobruk in Libya. In addition to carrying out a variety of construction tasks in Cyprus and at El Adem, the Squadron undertook work at Tabriz and Babol-Sar in Iran. In 1962, in Exercise Egg Flip, a detachment of the Squadron constructed a large earth landing strip at Bomba on the Libyan coast near Derna. Later that year, a small detachment marked out a landing strip in the far south of Libya at Kufra as an emergency diversion for planes unable to land at El Adem. In 1963, a large detachment of the Squadron moved at short notice to the Far East to undertake work at Kuching in Sarawak and at Labuan and Tawau in North Borneo in support of RAF operations following the Indonesian confrontation in Borneo. In September 1963, the Squadron moved to RAF Seletar in Singapore where it remained until the Branch was disbanded. In September 1953, 5003 Squadron was formed at RAF Lichfield but, in November 1957, it completed a move to RAF Wellesbourne Mountford, where it became part of Training Wing and numbered up to 500 personnel. Its detachments undertook a variety of construction tasks in the UK. Between 1958 and 1961, these included projects at RAF Acklington, Abingdon, Booker, Coningsby, Faldingworth, Finningley, Hemswell, Lindholme, Lyneham, Martlesham Heath, Nocton Hall, North Luffenham, Swinderby and Syerston. In November 1953, 5004 Squadron was formed at RAF Bruggen in Germany. It undertook a variety of tasks in RAF Second Tactical Air Force including improvements to the runway at RAF Bruggen. In 1956, the Squadron returned to the UK to be based at RAF Wellesbourne Mountford. The Squadron formed the major part of Operation Hardrock Task Force on St Kilda in 1957 and 1958. Operation Hardrock Task Force was formed at RAF Wellesbourne Mountford early in 1957, to construct, for the Army, a missile-tracking radar station on the island of St. Kilda, an uninhabited rocky outcrop some 60 miles west of the Outer Hebrides. A temporary RAF mainland base was established at Cairnryan and personnel, plant and transport were shipped to the island by Army tank landing craft (LCTs), based in Portsmouth, but sailing from Cairnryan, near Stranraer via Baenbecula. The task required the opening of a quarry out there and the construction of buildings and a road to the mountain- top radar site. The task was challenging because of the unpredictable, adverse nature of weather conditions out there, which precluded work being done throughout the Winter months. However, the task was completed by Autumn 1958. In April 1959, 5004 Squadron moved to RAF Khormaksar in Aden. It returned to the UK in December 1964 and was disbanded at RAF Waterbeach in May 1965. Disbandment The Airfield Construction Branch was disbanded on 1 April 1966. Its responsibilities were transferred to the Royal Engineers.

History =1940 to 1950= While the idea of a public library had been talked about by the residents of Brooks, no serious discussions were held by any groups until 1949. At the December 1949 meeting of the Junior Chamber of Commerce (the Jaycees), Misters Yoshito (Winky) Kimura, Roy McNair, and Ed Jahraus presented a preliminary report on the feasibility of creating a local library.\\". . . art Planning Local Community Library Project.\\" The Brooks Bulletin (Brooks, Alberta). 1 December 1949. The Restroom Society (a local service club) also expressed an interest in incorporating a reading room and library with its own building which was to be built in 1950. A committee was formed, and general meetings were held to convince the public of the value of a community public library.\\"Local Groups In Favor of J.C. Library Program\\" The Brooks Bulletin (Brooks, Alberta). 16 March 1950 On April 18, 1951 the first Brooks Public Library Board was formed.\\"Eleven Chosen to Organize Local Library\\" The Brooks Bulletin (Brooks, Alberta). 20 April 1950 =1951 to 1966= The Brooks Public Library opened its doors for the first time on March 10, 1951. Established with the fundraising efforts of the Jaycees, the library initially had a budget of $300.00. The library was located in the basement of the County Rest Room. The library had a starting collection of 2000 books, half of which were supplied by community members while the remaining 1000 were donated by the Medicine Hat Public Library. George Bolton and his wife Margaret were hired to be the caretakers of the Rest Room building,\\"Many Attend Restroom, Library Official Opening Last Saturday\\" The Brooks Bulletin (Brooks, Alberta). March 15, 1951. and Mollie Gray, Fay Marcy, and Ellen Martin volunteered their time to act as librarians.\\"Long-Felt Need Filled As Public Library Opened Last Saturday\\" The Brooks Bulletin (Brooks, Alberta). 15 March 1951. The Brooks Public Library received a certification of incorporation on April 23, 1957, providing the Brooks Library Board with the authority to act as a corporate body. A few years later, the town of Brooks enacted Bylaw No. 470 which officially established Brooks Public Library as the town's municipal library. During this time period, the library hired Margaret Bolton to act as Head Librarian. In 1962, Robbie Best took over the post of Head Librarian. =1967 to 1973= On February 2, 1967, Brooks Public Library opened in its second location under the supervision of Head Librarian Orelee Grosfield. The new building was the former Clancy School, which had previously been used as a health unit and a Scout Hall. In 1970, Karen Armbruster was hired to take over as Head Librarian. =1974 to 1992= The Brooks Public Library in its third location at the newly constructed Brooks Civic and Library Building. 1974 On August 1, 1974, the library moved a third time into the newly constructed Town Civic Building. At this time, the library had a collection of 8,000 books and 2,600 registered patrons. Membership was free to residents of Brooks and non- residents paid a fee of only $5.00. Patrons were, however, limited in the number of books that they could take out: only four items were allowed per patron. Overdue items cost $0.05 per day to a maximum of $2.00 per book. By 1980, the Town and County had a combined population of 14,850 people and 6,179 of those people had library memberships.Brooks Public Library - About Us ‚Äì History of Brooks Public Library. Retrieved 2011-02-04 In 1988, the municipalities of Brooks, Medicine Hat, Redcliff, Foremost, Bow Island, and the County of 40 Mile formed the Shortgrass Library System (SLS). The municipality of Brooks put in a bid to have Brooks become the home of the future SLS Headquarters, but after much deliberation Medicine Hat was chosen instead with Medicine Hat Public Library established as the SLS resource centre. At this time, non-resident memberships increased to $35.00 per individual and $50.00 per family, with the cost being set by the Shortgrass Library System. Also in 1988, the Brooks Library Foundation was formed to raise funds for a library expansion. Cramped quarters in the Town Civic Building meant that the library staff members were using Town Council chambers as a makeshift programming room and there was no room for expansion of the collection. =1993 to present= In 1993, Brooks Public Library moved to the former Eastern Irrigation District (EID) office building in Evergreen Park. A total of $300,000.00 had been raised by the Brooks Library Foundation to help facilitate the move including renovations. The new building increased square footage from 5,000 to 8,000. The grand opening took place on June 30, 1993. In the early 1990s, provincial funding to libraries decreased and municipal funding was frozen by the town of Brooks. In 1994, the Brooks Library Board made the decision to begin charging $12.00 for individual memberships. A few years later, a family membership fee was added at a price of $18.00. In 2000, Karen Armbruster retired after serving the library for thirty years as its Head Librarian. Laura Taylor was chosen as her replacement and stayed for a period of nine months. In October 2001, Julia Reinhart moved from Ontario to take over the helm. The next few years saw a rapid increase in the use of the library's computers and Internet services. The establishment of the Alberta SuperNet in 2005, a service that provided all Alberta public libraries with high speed Internet, added to the demand for the libraries' computer services. Programming also developed rapidly at this time, particularly in 2003 with the development of the annual Medieval Faire. In 2003, Alcoma Community Library, Bassano Memorial Library, and Rolling Hills Public Library joined the Shortgrass Library system. Non-resident fees were again increased by the Shortgrass Library System, jumping to $60.00 for an individual and $80.00 for a family membership. At this time, The Alberta Library (TAL) was also developed. Brooks Public Library joined The Alberta Library initiative, allowing their patrons to apply for TAL cards that could be used at libraries across the province. In 2006, Julia Reinhart was offered the position of Public Services Librarian at Shortgrass Library System. Shannon Vossepoel, a former CAP intern for Brooks Public Library and a recent graduate of the School of Library and Information Studies in Edmonton, took over as Head Librarian. By this time the City and County had a combined population of 22,452 people [7] and roughly 1,900 of those people had Brooks Public Library memberships. In 2008 the Brooks Library Board made the decision to raise the price of memberships to $15.00 for individual memberships and $20.00 to family memberships. Overdue items at this time cost $0.25 per day for all adult and young adult materials, and $0.10 a day for all children's material to a maximum of $5.00 per user. In 2009 the library transferred management of the Medieval Faire over to an independent volunteer governing body. In that same year the library's board was honoured the Alberta Association of Trustees Award of Excellence. In 2010 the library was honoured again, this time with the Government of Alberta Municipal Affairs Minister's Award for Excellence in Public Library Service. In 2012, Sarah McCormack was hired to take over as Head Librarian. In 2014 George Hawtin took over as Head Librarian. On his first day in the position the City of Brooks announced funding to build a new library building at the Lakeside Leisure Centre.

This was the worst performing release by Fox Film that year.Solomon The Broadway musical Music in the Air opened at the Alvin Theatre in New York City on November 8, 1932 and ran for 342 performances. Plot Aspiring songwriter Karl Roder (Douglass Montgomery) travels to the big city, along with a girl he is in love with, Sieglinde Lessing (June Lang), and her Father Walter Lessing (Al Shean) who has just written a new song that he thinks will take the world by storm (with lyrics by Karl). They stumble into the stormy relationship of Opera star Frieda Hotzfelt (Gloria Swanson), and librettist Bruno Mahler (John Boles) who constantly bicker and make up. When the composer for their new show suddenly leaves town, they decide to use Walters song, partially out of convienince, and party due to the fact that Bruno has fallen in love with Sieglinde, and Frieda has fallen in love with Karl, though he does not reciprocate. Karl, realizing the city is no place for him, decides to go back to the village, but Bruno convinces Sieglinde that she is destined for the stage, and she stays behind to replace Frieda as the Prima Donna in the opera. However, as the opening night approaches, the cast and crew all determine that Sieglinde can not act, and they ask Frieda to come back and star in the show. Walter calls them all cruel for breaking his daughters heart, but they tell him that the audience is crueler, and they are being spared the worst of it. At the end of the day, the feelings of two amateurs are not more important than the livelihood of the crew who deserve to put on a good show. Sieglinde and Walter return to their town, and Sieglinde goes to apologize to Karl with her tail between her legs for not listening to him, but Walter can still be proud that his music is featured in a real show, and the whole town listens to it together on the radio.

Gluck is a professor of neuroscience at Rutgers‚ÄìNewark in New Jersey, director of the Rutgers Memory Disorders Project, and publisher of the public health newsletter, Memory Loss and the Brain. He works at the interface between neuroscience, psychology, and computer science, studying the neural bases of learning and memory.

Learning and Memory: From Brain to Behavior. New York: Worth.  Graduate and postdoctoral training  Gluck attended Harvard University as an undergraduate pursuing majors in both Psychology and Computer Science. During these years, Gluck worked under the supervision of William Kaye Estes on connectionist models of basic levels in category hierarchies. After graduating from Harvard University, Gluck pursued a Ph.D. degree at Stanford University in Cognitive Psychology, under Gordon H. Bower's tutelage. His dissertation focused on using network models to seek a rapprochement between theories of animal and human learning. It also included several experimental studies of human learning that validated predictions of the probabilistic category learning model that Gluck and Bower designed, and which was based on a generalization of the Rescorla‚ÄìWagner model of Pavlovian conditioning.Gluck, M. A., & Bower, G. H. (1988). \\"Evaluating an adaptive network model of human learning\\"] Journal of Memory and Language, 27, 166-195Gluck, M. A. & Bower, G. H.

Thompson on computational models of the neural bases of Pavlovian conditioning.  Rutgers‚ÄìNewark  Gluck became a faculty member of the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience at Rutgers University-Newark in New Jersey. Gluck began exploring the functional role of the hippocampus in learning and memory in collaboration with his new postdoctoral fellow, Catherine E. Myers. The following year, Gluck and Myers proposed a theory that argued that a wide range of superficially disparate conditioning behaviors that depend on an intact hippocampal region can be understood as being those that require adaptive changes in the underlying representation of stimulus events.Gluck, M. A. & Myers, C. (1993). \\"Hippocampal mediation of stimulus representation: A computational theory\\" Hippocampus 3(4): 491-516] Over the past two decades, Gluck has concentrated on understanding the fundamental principles and mechanisms of learning and memory through the integration of behavioral, biological and computational approaches. By utilizing novel cognitive tasks, Gluck has studied many disorders that are not traditionally viewed as learning disorders. One area of his lab concentrates on frontostriatal circuits and dopamine, and their role in learning new associations, skills, and habits; this includes clinical studies of patients with Parkinson's disease, dystonia, frontotemporal dementia, and drug addiction. Another focus is on the hippocampus and medial temporal lobes and their role in supporting new learning by providing contextual and representational constraints on what is learned; this includes clinical studies of patients with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, global anterograde amnesia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. = Research =  Parkinson's disease  Gluck and his lab members are studying memory impairments in patients with Parkinson's disease, a condition characterized by the death of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra. He is studying the cognitive effects of this dopaminergic cell death, as well as cognitive effects from the dopamine-replenishing medications.http://www.gluck.edu/parkinsons.html Utilizing computational modeling as well as studying patient populations, Gluck and his lab members have uncovered novel findings with regards to Parkinson's disease. Specifically, Gluck has studied the effects of dopaminergic medication on reward and punishment learning in patients with Parkinson's disease.N. Bodi, S. Keri, H. Nagy, A. Moustafa, C. E. Myers, N.

It is the 189th ILO convention and was adopted during the 100th session of the International Labour Organization. It entered into force on 5 September 2013. Rights The main rights given to domestic workers as decent work are daily and weekly (at least 24 h) rest hours, entitlement to minimum wage and to choose the place where they live and spend their leave. Ratifying states parties should also take protective measures against violence and should enforce a minimum age which is consistent with the minimum age at other types of employment. Workers furthermore have a right to a clear (preferably written) communication of employment conditions which should in case of international recruitment be communicated prior to immigration. They are furthermore not required to reside at the house where they work, or to stay at the house during their leave. Adoption and entry into force The convention was put to vote on 16 June 2011 by a vote at the ILO conference in Geneva. As ILO is a tripartite organization, for every country the government, employers and workers' representatives are entitled to vote. The convention was adopted with 396 votes in favour and 16 against (and 63 abstentions). All Persian Gulf states voted in support, while abstentions were cast by (amongst others) the United Kingdom. The convention entered into force one year after ratification by two countries, which is a standard entry into force condition for ILO conventions. Ratifications are to be communicated to the Secretary- General of the ILO. On 26 April 2012, the Uruguayan parliament approved the convention and thereby became the first country to ratify it, followed by presidential assent on 30 April 2012 and deposit of its instrument of ratification in June 2012. As of October 2020, it has been ratified by 30 states.

He enjoyed a successful legal career in Ireland, holding office as Attorney General for Ireland and as a justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). For a time he acted as Deputy to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland.  Family and early career  He was born around 1570, sixth son of John Ryves of Damory Court, near Blandford, Dorset, and Elizabeth Mervyn. He belonged to a gifted family: one of his brothers, Sir Thomas Ryves, was considered to be the leading expert on ecclesiastical and Admiralty law of his time, and another brother George was Master of New College, Oxford. Dr. Bruno Ryves, royal chaplain and later Dean of Windsor, was his first cousin, and Sir John Davies, whom William replaced as Irish Attorney General, was his uncle by marriage.DNB William entered the Middle Temple in 1593 and was called to the Bar in 1600. He was made a Bencher of the Middle Temple in 1619. He lived for some years at Oxford and owned property at St. Giles His first judicial appointment was as a justice of the Carmarthen circuit.  Irish career  William and his brother Thomas both made full use of their family connection with Sir John Davies, and on Davies' recommendation William succeeded him as Attorney-General for Ireland in 1619, and was given a knighthood. As Attorney General he acted regularly as an extra judge of assize, and sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Belturbet in the Parliament of 1634-5. He was granted the right to hold a fair and weekly market at Rathsallagh, County Wicklow in 1632. He became Treasurer of the King's Inns in 1639. While he had depended on the Davies connection for his early advancement, his subsequent promotion was due to the patronage of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, the all-powerful Lord Deputy of Ireland.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 On Strafford's recommendation Ryves became second justice of the King's Bench in 1636. Strafford's downfall in 1640-41 did not damage Ryves' career as it did that of some of his colleagues, notably Sir Richard Bolton, the Lord Chancellor. Parliament resolved in May 1641 that Bolton was unfit to preside as Speaker of the Irish House of Lords, and Ryves was appointed to act in his place. He acted in this capacity in 1641-2 and again in 1644. He visited England for the last time in 1643. He died in Dublin in 1648 and was buried in the Church of St. John the Evangelist, Dublin. Character  Ryves has been described as one of the most gifted members of a gifted family. Elrington BallThe Judges in Ireland however criticizes him as one of those judges who owed everything to Strafford, and later betrayed his trust by working closely with Parliament in bringing down both Strafford and Bolton.  Family  Little is known of Ryves' first wife: her family name is variously given as Jackson and Latham. By this marriage he had three daughters and six sons, including Charles, father of Sir Richard Ryves, Commissioner of the Great Seal for Ireland. Ryves' second wife was Dorothy Waldron.

Its discovery was reported in June 2011, although it was suspected to be a planet as early as 2004. The planet is about three-fourths the mass of Jupiter, but is almost eighty percent larger than Jupiter is; this inflation has, as with the discovery of similar planets WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b, raised the question of what (other than temperature) causes these planets to become so large. HAT-P-33b was difficult to confirm because its star experiences high jitter, which disrupted the ability to obtain accurate measurements. As such, a greater number of radial velocity observations were collected to make the confirmation, although it was later determined that HAT-P-33b could not be determined using the radial velocity method. The planet's confirmation came about after the planet's light curve was collected, and the Blendanal process ruled out most false positive scenarios. Discovery HAT-P-33b's existence was first suggested after observations by the six-telescope HATnet collaboration, a project that searches the sky for planets in transit of, or crossing in front of, their host stars. The presence of a planet in HAT-P-33's orbit had been suspected as early as 2004, although high levels of jitter were detected. This jitter, or a random and shaky appearance that clouds the accuracy of measurements, made it difficult to easily verify the radial velocity of the planetary candidate's host star, which usually leads summarily to the planet's confirmation. The W.M. Keck Observatory was used to collect data on HAT-P-33's radial velocity. As a start, the spectrum of HAT-P-33 was composed using the digital speedometer at the 1.5-meter Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona. The collected data found that the star was a single dwarf star exhibiting a slight rotation. Several of its parameters, including its effective temperature and surface gravity, were found. Additionally, the SOPHIE √©chelle spectrograph at a 1.93-meter telescope at France's Haute-Provence Observatory was used to observe the star. The resulting data invited the possibility that radial velocity measurements, which can exhibit anomalies that often indicate the presence of a planet, may have been because of background distortion (and not a planet). This possibility significantly complicated the ability of scientists to verify this planet. After the observations, follow-ups were postponed for several years. Between September 2008 and December 2010, twenty- two spectra were collected using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) instrument at Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory. This data was used to derive HAT-P-33's radial velocity. A far greater number of spectra were gathered for HAT-P-33 than the number usually gathered for planetary candidates to compensate for the data's jitter effect. It was concluded that the jitter in the data was caused by stellar activity and not the presence of other planets. It became apparent to the investigating science team that radial velocity data alone could not prove the existence of HAT-P-33b. As such, photometric observations of HAT-P-33 were conducted using the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory's 1.2-meter telescope, which hosted the KeplerCam CCD instrument. This data was used to create the light curve of HAT-P-33. In doing so, a slight dimming was observed where HAT-P-33b was believed to have transited its star. Using a program called Blendanal, similar to the Blender technique used to verify the planets discovered by Kepler, the astronomers observing HAT-P-33 hoped to rule out false positive alternatives that could explain the planet-like signal seen in HAT-P-33's light curve and radial velocity. The use of Blendanal ruled out the possibilities that the signal was caused by that of a hierarchical triple star or a mixture between a bright star and a binary star in the background. The possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star whose secondary companion is too dim to be distinguishable from the brighter star could not be ruled out. However, the data indicated that the planet HAT-P-33b did indeed exist. HAT-P-33b is 1.8 times the size of Jupiter (left), and slightly larger than WASP-17b (right). The discoveries of the high-radii planets HAT-P-33b and HAT-P-32b, along with that of WASP-17b, contributed to the question of what factors, besides temperature, contribute to the large radii of these inflated planets. The discrepancy lies in planet WASP-18b, which is far hotter than the newly discovered HAT planets and WASP-17b, but has a far smaller radius. The discoveries of HAT-P-33b and HAT-P-32b were reported together in the Astrophysical Journal. The paper was submitted on June 6, 2011. The authors of the discovery paper of the planets suggested the usage of the Spitzer Space Telescope to observe the occultation of HAT-P-33b behind its star to better define its characteristics. Host star HAT-P-33, or GSC 2461-00988, is an F-type star that lies approximately 401 parsecs (1,310 light years) away from Earth. The star has 1.403 solar masses and 1.777 solar radii; the star is, in other words, 40% more massive than and 77% larger than the Sun. With an effective temperature of 6401 K, HAT-P-33 is hotter than the Sun. It is also more metal-rich, with a metallicity that is measured at [Fe/H] = 0.05. This means that HAT-P-33 has 12% more iron than the amount measured in the Sun. HAT-P-33 is younger than the Sun, at an estimated age of 2.4 billion years. The surface gravity of the star is determined to be 4.09. All the values above are determined with the assumption that planet HAT-P-33b has an irregular, or eccentric, orbit. HAT-P-33 has an apparent magnitude of 11.89. It cannot be seen from Earth with the naked eye because it is so dim. Because high levels of jitter have been detected in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system would have to have a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative. It is possible that other planets with shorter orbital periods than HAT-P-33b exist in the system. However, at the time of HAT-P-33b's discovery, not enough radial velocity measurements had been collected to determine if this is so. Characteristics HAT-P-33b is a planet that has 0.764 Jupiter masses and 1.827 Jupiter radii. In other words, it is about three-fourths as massive as Jupiter, but is slightly less than twice Jupiter's size. HAT-P-33b orbits its star at an average distance of 0.0503 AU, which is about 5% of the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This orbit is completed every 3.474474 days (83.39 hours). HAT-P-33b has an equilibrium temperature of 1838 K, which is almost fifteen times hotter than the measured equilibrium temperature of Jupiter (124 K). The best fit for the shape of HAT-P-33b's orbit suggests that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148. However, because the star HAT-P-33 has such a high level of jitter, it is difficult to constrain the planet's eccentricity with accuracy. Most of the planet's defined characteristics are based on the assumption that HAT-P-33b has an elliptical orbit, although the planet's discoverers have also derived HAT-P-33b's characteristics on the assumption that the planet has a circular orbit. The elliptical model has been chosen because it is considered to be the most likely scenario. HAT-P-33b has an orbital inclination of 86.7¬∫ as seen from Earth. The planet is, thus, almost edge-on when seen from Earth. The planet has been observed to transit its host star.

The title wang is written identically in Chinese, but it is common in English to distinguish between the scions of the imperial dynasties (translated \\"prince\\") and the dynasties of independent lords (translated \\"king\\"). History According to traditional Chinese historians, the title was first used by two refugee princes from Zhou who were credited with civilizing the barbarian Wu (and sometimes Japan as well). Their state of Wu had its capital first at Meili (traditionally held to be Meicun in modern Wuxi), then at Gusu (within modern Suzhou) and Helu City (present-day Suzhou). It was established independently but became a vassal to Zhou after its conquest of Shang. It became independent again during the Spring and Autumn period, but was annexed by Yue in 473 BC. The title was somewhat infelicitous for the early Kings of the Han dynasty, who were quite autonomous and powerful before being reined in after an unsuccessful revolt in 154 BC. Therefore, the early princes are sometimes counted as \\"kings\\" as well. After the rebellion, the Wuyue region was divided up among different princes and the title was abolished until it was recreated during the Three Kingdoms era when Cao Cao recommended Sun Ce to be Marquis of Wu in 197. Sun Quan was created as King of Wu in 220 as Cao Wei vassal kingdom, which translated as Prince of Wu. He later declared himself an independent king in 222 and proclaimed as emperor of Eastern Wu in 229. The Prince of Wu title was recreated during the Tang dynasty for 14th son of Emperor Gaozu, Li Yuangui. Li Ke was created as Prince of Wu in 636. The title was suspended in 653 when Li Ke ordered to commit suicide. He was found innocent in 705, and his son Li Kun was posthumously honored as Prince of Wu. The title remained suspended until near the end of Tang dynasty, Yang Xingmi was created Prince of Wu in 902, and his successor kept the Wu title even after end of Tang in 907. They remained independent as Southern Wu as King of Wu until Yang Pu declared himself an emperor. During the Red Turban Rebellion, Zhu Yuanzhang declared himself King of Wu during the late phases of against the Yuan, just prior to his establishment of the Ming dynasty. His fifth son, Zhu Su, received the title as Prince of Wu after he became emperor in 1370. The title was vacated in 1378 after Zhu Su's title changed to Prince of Zhou.

While marketing research employs techniques like focus groups, surveys and observation to better understand consumer decision-making, virtual store research uses these standard research techniques within a simulated store setting, delivered via computer. Virtual store research uses 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional computer simulation technology to create retail contexts that are as close to the real shopping experience as possible. This allows test consumers within the virtual environment to interact with store merchandise and make purchase decisions in a way that closely resembles real in-store behavior. Additionally, virtual store technology can help consumer packaged goods companies and retailers make daily business decisions without the need for physically changing stores and products.  History  Prior to the emergence of virtual store technology, the only way to get in- store behavioral data was through in-person store research. In-person store research is the acknowledged gold standard for testing the impact of changes in price, planograms, product packaging, or new products on consumer behavior. A controlled store test requires a change to be made in one set of stores but not in another similar set of stores. The sales results are then compared to determine if the change was beneficial. This approach is often paired with intercept research, which requires the researcher to station data collectors in actual stores and interrupt shoppers to ask questions about their shopping experience. These types of tests take place at the time of purchase and are widely considered to yield the most accurate insights about actual consumer behavior. However, they are very expensive and time consuming, and the tests themselves are considered by many shoppers and storeowners to be highly intrusive. Virtual store research emerged as a more cost-effective alternative that could address the drawbacks of in-person store research through controlled simulations. Methodologies for simulating a shelf set in a virtual environment first emerged in the 1990s, led by academic research labs like Harvard Business School‚Äôs Marketing Simulation Lab. In 1996, Harvard Business Review published a seminal article by Professor Raymond R. Burke called ‚ÄúVirtual Shopping: Breakthrough in Marketing Research,‚Äù which established empirically that ‚Äúlaboratory data can accurately predict the brand market share and consumer price sensitivity observed in the supermarket. Those predictions were most accurate when the simulation reproduced the visual cues that consumers used to make their purchase decisions.‚Äù His data indicated that virtual store sales correlate closely with sales in actual stores (correlation scores ranged from 0.90 for beauty categories to 0.94 for cleaning products in one test). However, Burke was a decade early with his article. In a 2008 survey of researchers, only 3.7% of respondents reported using virtual testing techniques. The reason for the slow initial adoption of virtual store research is that these tests were still performed in remote labs, requiring consumers to come to specific locations. Early adopter Kimberly-Clark was featured on the front page of The Wall Street Journal in 2007 for its use of virtual store technology in marketing research, but mainstream market penetration remained low. For solution vendors virtual store technologies tend to fall into one of two categories: * Early market entrants took a realistic 3D shelf set out of the lab and allowed consumer testing in the field using a laptop running the technology. Respondents were recruited ad hoc at grocery stores to participate in tests. * Others saw the Internet as a way to draw on larger samples more quickly and cost-effectively ad optimized 2D, rather than 3D, product images in a lightweight store simulation so that surveys could be executed efficiently through web browsers using the dial-up Internet connections still prevalent in the early 2000s. In 1996, Buzz 3D Ltd., a general-purpose B2B 3D Solutions developer, started their own in-house development of their Buzz 3D software \\"engine\\", which was one of the first to leverage the higher power of the newly emerging GPU-accelerated 3D gaming cards. Designed specifically for mainstream hardware, Buzz 3D's capabilities scaled over time to encompass greater functionality. In 2010 Buzz 3D began working with Perception Research Services International, a US-based leading FMCG market research provider, for whom they modified their engine to provide category-level supermarket- simulation capabilities twinned with data-capture from shopper behaviour. A breakthrough moment arrived in 2016 when Buzz 3D extended their technology to integrate Tobii Eye Tracking, and enable Full Store Shopping on regular 3D gaming hardware. Instead of managing a few hundred Skus within a limited section of a store, and requiring a secondary and time-intensive eye-tracking analysis process, the technology could now record and process eye tracking data in a single sweep, accommodate an unlimited store size with tens of thousands of Skus, whilst maintaining full data-capture in real-time without sacrificing performance. For the first time, large shopping environments became possible to simulate within a superior data-capture and insights workflow on low cost hardware. Today, Buzz 3D is focused on bringing these capabilities out of the Virtual Store Research sector, and into mainstream retail as a Direct-To-Market 3D Virtual Shopping capability closely aligned with Burke's original predictions. In 2002, NORM Research & Consulting, a shopper insight agency founded in Sweden, began the development of Simstore. Simstore is a technological platform and methodology for conducting virtual store research. It was developed in partnership with Arla Foods and the Stockholm School of Economics. NORM was one of the first agencies to offer a unique browser-based solution that enables the FMCG industry to easily test multiple scenarios by measuring actual shopping behaviour, using online panellists. Simstore started as an online 2D research tool and, in 2011, NORM added Simstore 3D solutions to the offer. NORM continues to challenge the market with new and innovative ways to conduct virtual store research and helps clients worldwide to get a better understanding of the complexity of shopper decision-making. At the end of 2005, ACTIPLAY, a technology company based in France, with a history in Advergames, developed ACTISKU, one of the first online solutions to enable brands and research companies to test out new marketing concepts in a 3D virtual context using online panelists. Originally created for the Carlsberg group, the technical challenge was and remains, being able to keep the download times for panelists to a minimum while maintaining the highest levels of realism. Since then several versions have been launched, the latest including a powerful Shop Editor, allowing direct interaction with the 3D environments prior to creation of final consumer version. Comparing one 3D store environment against another helps brands understand which in-store concept work more effectively. In 2005 FACTBOY, using ACTISKU technology, started selling online 3D virtual research and has grown knowledge and expertise with a high number of online shopper market research projects and became pioneers in this area with a serious number of project in the field. After moving to its own platform in 2007 and continuous platform improvements Factboy has today a performing platform and found a good trade off between performance and quality. FACTBOY based the on development on the 3D engine from Unity3D to ensure seamless web-player installation and content streaming in the background and provides the full production service to clients from store content collection up to data analytics. In 2006, a new player called Red Dot Square Solutions emerged from the UK operating initially in the North American market. Red Dot's emphasis was on creating a complete virtual store fully stocked with 3-dimensional objects where shoppers could wander at will. Consumer product companies could then test multiple variables within the full virtual store environment. The company established a network of more than 60 on-site test centers to field research studies using eye tracking technology alongside virtual aisles where respondents interacted with touch screens to examine products. Red Dot Square Solutions was acquired by WPP in 2009. The technology is continually developing as companies were eager for the realistic experience of 3D environments combined with lower costs and quicker turnaround times. As a result, in 2009, InContext Solutions developed a technology to stream data-rich, complex 3D objects over the Internet, the solution allowed consumer packaged goods companies to put their consumers in a realistic 3D in-store shopping context, yet still leverage the scalability of online research, enabling them to increase sample sizes, field studies anywhere in the world, and realize significantly faster project completion times while approximating the accuracy levels of in-person store research. In 2012 all Factboy activities moved to the operational Team of Factboy and continues the service and solution under ShopperFact brand. ShopperFact and Factboy is managed by ShopperFact, Inc. ( a company owned by the operational, production and R&D; Factboy Team) with presence in New York, Miami, Cancun, Mexico City and Germany. The long-term promise of virtual store research remains as articulated by Burke in 1996: ‚ÄúOne day, the virtual store may become a channel for direct, personal, and intelligent communications with the consumer, one that encompasses research, sales and service.‚Äù  Usage  Marketing research Virtual store technology is generally used to answer questions regarding customer decisions within an in-store setting. This includes all of the following: * New product placement * Packaging changes * Pricing studies * In-store marketing levers, including displays, promotions and messaging * Merchandising strategies * Planogram or shelf-set changes * In-store events * Product or category findability studies Integration with point of sale data In 2011, InContext Solutions introduced Visualize InContext, a software tool that allows companies to view actual point-of-sales data within the virtual store environment. Through Visualize InContext, marketers and retailers can see in real time what is happening on the shelf, enabling them to tune their shelf restocking schedules and better optimize planograms for the most efficient product sell‚Äìthrough using actual point-of- sale data. Fusion with Online Shopping In 2017, Buzz 3D introduced their Buzz 3D Retail Suite, which as well as providing 3D Planogram creation, Store Planning and Virtual Store Research functions, leveraged 3D Cloud functionality to permit live access to the Virtual Store from any video- capable device. By defining products within the store individually, and making it simple and cost-effective to create from photography, retailers now have a means of selling through a Virtual Store in addition to just conducting research studies alone. Additional applications Virtual store technologies have additional applications as visualization tools for internal marketing and product development efforts, including the following: * Collaboration between manufacturers and suppliers for package design and product development * Collaboration between manufacturers and retail partners * Visualization of in- store marketing and promotional ideas within marketing departments * Virtual store displays to showcase products at trade shows or with outside partners * As a visualization aid for professional sales forces  See also  * A/B testing * List of marketing research firms * Market analysis * Market research * Marketing * Marketing Research Association * Marketing research * Neuromarketing * Quantitative marketing research  References  Category:Market research ","title":"Virtual store research"},{"id":"32108293","title":"List of alumni of Girton College, Cambridge"},{"id":"32108299","text":"WSG Swarovski Tirol is an Austrian football club located in Wattens, a town in the state of Tyrol in the west of the country.

Its most successful period was in 1968‚Äì71, when it competed in the Austrian Bundesliga. Between 1971 and 1984 it merged with FC Wacker Innsbruck to form SSW Innsbruck (the merged team went on to win the Bundesliga five times and reached the quarter finals of the 1977-78 European Cup). In this period the club retained its identity with distinct youth teams. From 1984, WSG Wattens have played in the Austrian Regional League West and the second tier First League. In 2019, they were promoted to the Bundesliga. After promotion, the club announced that their name would be changed to WSG Swarowski Tirol.

Created by Chris Matonti, J.D. Matonti, and Julia Coppola, he first appeared in NEW-GEN #1 (2010). He is a sentient robot from the world of NEW-GEN, and a member of the A.P.N.G. since its founding. Fictional character biography =Construction and early life= Roboduck was assembled on New-Gen, as a first generation combat robot, equipped with an advanced weapons system. When Deadalus released a nanobot plague throughout New-Gen, the miniature robots wrought havoc on Roboduck's A.I. programming. Instead of altering his physical appearance and capabilities, the nanobots transformed Roboduck's mind to operate much like that of a human. Gabriel took Roboduck in after his transformation, in order to train him to use his powers and abilities responsibly.NEW-GEN #1 =Training with A.P.N.G.= As the human members of the A.P.N.G. grew up, Roboduck joined them in their combat training and school studies. As he is unable to learn like a normal New-Gen robot, via uploads and downloads, Roboduck lacks the vast informational wealth available to other robots, like Nate Guard, another member of the A.P.N.G. With his hyperactive and improvisational mind, he quickly established himself as the class clown of the A.P.N.G., wisecracking and causing mischief throughout much of their education.NEW-GEN #3 =Battle with Sly= After Sly burrowed out of the underworld onto Zadaar IV with his army of MetalMites and microbots, Roboduck was sent, along with the rest of the members of the A.P.N.G. to fight, after Sly's forces proved to powerful for Mini to beat on his own. Throughout the course of the battle, Roboduck destroyed several MetalMites with his weapons array. He also allows Mini to use him as a cannon of sorts, Mini aiming him at enemies and squeezing him so a more powerful plasma burp can be shot.NEW-GEN #5 When Sly uses his specialized laser and deactivates the nanobots inside the A.P.N.G., he also disables Roboduck's entire operating system, rendering him inert for a brief period of time. Gabriel resurrects Roboduck when he arrives and gives all the members of the A.P.N.G. specially designed nano-gloves, restoring them to full power. As Gabriel fights Sly, Roboduck resumes destroying MetalMites with his teammates, eventually emerging victorious and returning home to New-Gen.NEW-GEN #6 Powers and abilities As a first generation battle robot, Roboduck possesses an advanced, plasma based, weapons system for use in ranged combat. His right arm transforms into a plasma cannon from which he can fire bolts of energy. He can also burp a more powerful plasma blast from his mouth, but he has trouble controlling it. If he is squeezed hard while firing his plasma burp, the power of the attack is increased by a drastic margin. Roboduck is also capable of flight, enabled by thrusters in his feet and elbows. After he was infected by Deadalus' nanobots, Roboduck lost the ability to gain and process information like a robot. However, the nanobots gave Roboduck the ability to learn and think like a human. This allows him to think more analytically, feel more emotion, and improvise more effectively than most other robots on New-Gen. It also allows him to disobey orders and seek attention through fooling around.

It was designed to test the idea of \\"slip-wings\\", where the aircraft could take off as a biplane, jettison the upper, disposable wing, and continue flying as a monoplane. A single example was built, which successfully demonstrated jettisoning of the slip wing in flight. Design and development In the 1930s, as take-off weights of aircraft continued to increase, designers grew increasingly concerned about the effects that these weights would have on take-off runs, and several designers investigated the concept of a \\"slip- wing\\", which could be jettisoned after take-off. Amongst the proponents of the \\"slip-wing\\" was Noel Pemberton Billing, the founder of Supermarine, who wrote several articles in the aviation press promoting the idea, either with a manned, reusable auxiliary wing, or a disposable or \\"scrap-wing\\".Jarrett Aeroplane Monthly April 1990, p. 204.Jarrett Air Enthusiast August to October 1993, pp. 3‚Äì7. Blackburn Aircraft also investigated \\"slip-wings\\".Ellis Air Enthusiast September/October 2003, p. 49. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, F Hills and Son, a light aircraft manufacturer based at Trafford Park, Manchester offered a design for a light fighter aircraft to the British Air Ministry. The fighter would be cheap to build and could be operated from small fields or open roads. To give the required take-off performance, the design was to be fitted with a disposable \\"slip-wing\\". While the proposal was not accepted by the Air Ministry, Hills and Sons decided to continue with the project as a private venture, and so built a scale test-bed, to prove the slip-wing process. The test bed, known as the Bi-mono, was a small tractor monoplane with a fabric-covered steel-tube construction fuselage and a wooden wing. It had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage while an enclosed cockpit was provided for the pilot. The auxiliary wing was attached to the top of the cockpit canopy and to the lower wing by interplane struts. Two different upper wings were flown. The one used initially had a wingspan of but the later, shorter wing's span of was the same as that of the lower one. The aircraft was powered by a single de Havilland Gipsy Six engine.Jarrett Aeroplane Monthly April 1990, p. 205.Ellis Air Enthusiast September/October 2003, p. 50. The Bi- mono was not the only slip-wing project built by Hills and Sons, as they were also contracted by Pemberton Billing to build his PB.37 design for a slip-wing dive-bomber, with a pusher monoplane lower component powered by a 290 hp (216 kW) engine, while the manned slip-wing upper component was a tractor monoplane powered by a 40 hp (30 kW) engine. Construction work started on the PB.37 early in 1940, but work was abandoned in July 1940 when construction was almost finished but the aircraft was unflown.Jarrett Air Enthusiast August to October 1993, pp. 3‚Äì4. Operational history The Bi-mono, which carried no serial number or civil registration, made its maiden flight from Barton Aerodrome during 1941.Ellis Air Enthusiast September/October 2003, p. 51. Test flights were made both as a monoplane and as a biplane, with the shorter upper wing being chosen. In order to avoid the potential hazards to people on the ground of dropping the wing, wing jettisoning tests were carried out from Squires Gate Airport, Blackpool, with the upper wing being successfully dropped over the Irish Sea on 16 July 1941. The test proved successful, with no great change in trim and a few hundred feet in altitude being lost when the upper wing was jettisoned.Jarrett Aeroplane Monthly April 1990, p. 206. The Bi-mono was subject to further testing by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down from October 1941. The A&AEE; found that the maximum speed of the biplane configuration was slower than the stalling speed of the monoplane configuration. Its landing characteristics were likened to a kangaroo.Mason The Secret Years: Flight testing at Boscombe Down p209 Hills and Sons went on to further develop the slip-wing concept, flying the Hillson FH.40, a Hawker Hurricane fitted with a slip-wing.Ellis Air Enthusiast September/October 2003, pp. 50‚Äì51.

In real systems, several of the hydrogens are replaced with other functional groups. In organic chemistry, negative hyperconjugation is the donation of electron density from a filled œÄ- or p-orbital to a neighboring œÉ*-orbital. This phenomenon, a type of resonance, can stabilize the molecule or transition state. It also causes an elongation of the œÉ-bond by adding electron density to its antibonding orbital. Negative hyperconjugation is most commonly observed when the œÉ*-orbital is located on certain C‚ÄìF or C‚ÄìO bonds, and does not occur to an appreciable extent with normal C‚ÄìH bonds. In negative hyperconjugation, the electron density flows in the opposite direction (from œÄ- or p-orbital to empty œÉ*-orbital) than it does in the more common hyperconjugation (from œÉ-orbital to empty p-orbital).

Her father, a peasant, served as an army clerk, for a while under the Decembrist leader Pavel Pestel. Her mother was of Swedish descent. She married Lazar Shapir in 1872. The couple had connections with several prominent revolutionaries. They lived for a time in a commune in Saint Petersburg, where they were associated with the Kornilova circle, one of whose members was Sofia Perovskaya. They were also on the fringes of a group ran by Sergey Nechayev. Lazar spent eight months in the Peter and Paul Fortress for radical activities before his marriage to Olga. Her first work of fiction was published in 1879. In her fiction she defended the Russian revolutionary movement against its critics. She wrote her novel The Stormy Years to counteract what she saw as the distortions of Fyodor Dostoyevsky (in The Possessed) and others. After this her works were published in many of the most popular journals of the time, including Otechestvennye Zapiski, Severny Vestnik and Vestnik Evropy. Her ten- volume collected works were published in 1910. Her primary public activity was in feminist organizations.

Holiday writes candidly of sexual abuse, confinement to institutions, heroin addiction, and the struggles of being African American before the rise of the Civil Rights Movement. According to an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, Dufty's aim was \\"to let Holiday tell her story her way. Fact checking wasn't his concern.\\" Since its publication, the book has been criticized for factual inaccuracies. In his introduction to the 2006 edition of Lady Sings the Blues, music biographer David Ritz writes: \\"(Holiday's) voice, no matter how the Dufty/Holiday interviewing process went, is as real as rain.\\" Despite some factual inaccuracies, according to Ritz, \\"in the mythopoetic sense, Holiday's memoir is as true and poignant as any tune she ever sang. If her music was autobiographically true, her autobiography is musically true.\\" In his 2015 study of Holiday, Billie Holiday: The Musician and the Myth, John Szwed argues that Lady Sings the Blues, is a generally accurate account of Holiday's life, and that Holiday's co-writer, William Dufty, was forced to water down or suppress material by the threat of legal action. The New Yorker reviewer Richard Brody writes: \\"In particular, Szwed traces the stories of two important relationships that are missing from the book‚Äîwith Charles Laughton, in the nineteen-thirties, and with Tallulah Bankhead, in the late nineteen- forties‚Äîand of one relationship that‚Äôs sharply diminished in the book, her affair with Orson Welles around the time of Citizen Kane.\\" References External links *Lady Sings the Blues at Google Books Category:1956 non- fiction books Category:Billie Holiday Category:Books adapted into films Category:Doubleday (publisher) books Category:Show business memoirs Category:Books about singers Category:Literary collaborations ","title":"Lady Sings the Blues (book)"},{"id":"32108636","text":"Savvas Siatravanis (, born 24 November 1992) is a Greek professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Super League 2 club Xanthi.

It is located in the Swiss cantons of Ticino and Graub√ºnden and flows through the valleys Val Cadlimo and Val Medel. Rein da Medel is the local Sursilvan, (i.e. Romansh) name in Graub√ºnden, which is commonly used to denote the Ticino part as well.For example, by cantonal and federal authorities The most important places along the river are the villages Curaglia and Platta in the municipality of Medel.  Course of the river  The headwaters of the Rein da Medel flow through the Val Cadlimo, a valley south of the main Alpine ridge in the municipality of Quinto in the canton of Ticino. This is officially Italian-speaking territory; the Italian name of the river is . There are three almost equally strong source streams: * The southern spring stream flows through the Lago Scuro (2451m, between Punta Negra and Bassa del Lago Scuro) * The central spring stream rises on the Botta di Cadlimo (2534m) and shortly thereafter flows through the Lago di Dentro * The northern spring stream rises beneath the Pizzo Curnera. The northern spring stream is about 640 meters long. The southern and western spring streams are about 1,000 meters from the spring to the confluence at . About a kilometer after the confluence of these spring creeks, the Reno di Medel flows through the Lago dell'Isra (2322m). A gorge runs under the Gotthard Base Tunnel and marks the transition from the Val Medel to the Val Cadlimo. Just below the gorge opens out, a tributary flows in from the south, which comes down from the Passo dell'Uomo via the Val Termine valley. In this area, the Reno di Medel form the boundary between the municipalities of Quinto and Blenio. A few meters north of the inflow into the Lai da Sontga Maria reservoir (1908m), the boundary between Ticino and Graub√ºnden is a straight line between Lukmanier Pass and Pizzo Scai, which ignores the local topography. In Graub√ºnden, the river flows through the Sursilvan speaking part of the canton. The middle section of the river is called Froda; the lower section is called Rein da Medel. The name change takes place at the confluence of major tributary Rein da Cristallina. The middle and lower sections of the river are in the Val Medel valley. Most of this section is in the municipality of Medel, except the uppermost bit is in Ticino and the last kilometer is in the municipality of Disentis/Muster. A small valley branches off to the south-east from the Val Medel towards the Lukmanier Pass. The entrance to this valley is covered by the Lai da Sontga Maria reservoir. Numerous small tributaries flow into the Reno di Medel throughout the entire Val Medel. The last two kilometers are through a canyon named Las Ruinas (), where the Reno di Medel flows into the Anterior Rhine at about 1075 m above sea level, just below the road bridge across the Anterior Rhine in the road to the Lukmanier Pass.  Flow lengths  The total flow length of the net since Medel is about 25.4 km. The lengths of the various sections are approximately: * Southern headwater: 0.99 km * Western headwater: 1.00 km * Northern headwater: 0.64 km * Reno di Medel (upper reaches of the Val Cadlimo, plus part of the middle reaches in Ticino, excluding Lai da Sontga Maria): 6.76 km * Lai da Sontga Maria: 2.67 km * Froda (dried part of the middle reaches without Lai da Santa Maria): 5.91 km * Reno di Medel (lower reaches): 9.05 km  Neighboring river basins  The key neighboring river basins in the Rhine system, those of the Reno Anteriur (Anterior Rhine), the Reno da Nalps and the Reno da Sumvitg and in the catchment area of the Po the rivers of Canaria, Murinascia Grande and Brenno.

His tutors thought well of himRoyal Naval Service Record ADM 196/55 and in 1907 he progressed to RNC Dartmouth where he continued to get good grades in everything except engineering. He completed his cadet training on HMS Cumberland and passed out as a midshipman in 1910. One of his first postings was to HMS Cochrane, which was one of the ships that escorted George V and Queen Mary to the Delhi Durbar of 1911. He was promoted to Sub- lieutenant in 1912 and at the beginning of 1914 he was appointed to HM Yacht Victoria and Albert on which his father had also served. At the outbreak of World War I, all Royal Yachtsmen were transferred to two ships in the Grand Fleet, HMS Agincourt and HMS Erin. Cunninghame Graham served on HMS Agincourt and saw action at the Battle of Jutland in command of number 4 gun turret. He specialised in signals and was promoted to Flag Lieutenant in 1917. After the war, he held a number of brief appointments, including a period as tutor at HM Signal School, before being appointed, despite his lowly rank, to HMS Iron Duke in the Spring of 1922 as Fleet Signal Officer of the Mediterranean Fleet, under the command of Admiral Sir Osmond Brock C-in-C. He gained the rank of Lieutenant-Commander in 1924 just prior to his marriage to Patricia Hanbury, the sister-in-law of Herbert Fitzherbert, the Executive Officer of the Iron Duke and was made a Commander in 1928. Cunninghame Graham had the unusual experience of attending all three staff colleges: Naval at Greenwich 1929-30; Army at Camberwell 1930-31; and Air Force at Andover 1934. Between 1931 and 1934, he served as Executive Officer on the cruiser HMS Cardiff on the South Africa station . He was appointed Staff Officer (Operations and Intelligence) at Nore Command in 1935. Having resigned himself, as had happened to his father, to remain a Commander for the rest of his naval service, he was promoted to Captain, at the last possible juncture under the batch system then in force, on 31 December 1935. In January 1936, George V died and Cunninghame Graham, awaiting his first command, acted as Aide-de-camp to Prince Paul of Greece during his visit to London for the state funeral. He was appointed in the autumn of 1936 to HMS Tarantula as Senior Naval Officer on the West River in China. This was the time of the Second Sino-Japanese War.Obituary: Patricia Cunninghame Graham The Independent, 5 June 1998 On his return from China, he was offered the post of Captain of the \\"stone frigate\\" HMS President, which he declined, going on Half-pay at his own request from 14 April 1938 until 2 March 1939, when he was appointed Captain of HM Signal School. During World War II he held four commands. When war was declared he was serving as Captain of HM Signal School, which also entailed being Deputy to the Commodore of Royal Naval Barracks, Portsmouth, and, thus, oversaw the research into the development of naval RDF. His next appointment, in 1941, was as Captain of the cruiser HMS Kent on the Russian convoys. HMS Kent was selected to carry a diplomatic party which included: H.E. Ivan M Maisky, the Soviet Ambassador; Rt Hon Anthony Eden, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; Sir Alexander Cadogan, Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office; and Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Nye, VCIGS, to Murmansk from where they would travel by train to Moscow for talks with Stalin. As the diplomatic party were without any ciphering staff, it fell to Cunninghame Graham to inform the Foreign Secretary that the UK had declared war on Japan. In the Autumn of 1942, he became Flag-Captain to Rear-Admiral Louis ‚Äò‚ÄôTurtle‚Äô‚Äô Hamilton who had chosen to hoist his flag in HMS ‚Äò‚ÄôKent‚Äô‚Äô. In August 1943, he was promoted to Commodore (2nd Class) in charge of the Royal Naval Barracks, Chatham, in command of 20,000 officers, men and women with a daily turnover of 1,000. Also during this time, he was an Aide-de-Camp to the King (his father had been a Groom-in-Waiting to Edward VII and an Equerry to George V) and was appointed a CBE in the 1944 New Year's Honours List. In January 1945, there came a second promotion to Rear-Admiral in command of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, and Second in Command of the Home Fleet, hoisting his flag first in HMS ‚Äô‚ÄôDiadem‚Äô‚Äô and then in HMS ‚Äô‚ÄôBirmingham. After the War he continued to command the 10th Cruiser Squadron (later 2nd Cruiser Squadron with his flag in HMS Superb), during which time, he took part in the victory celebrations in the Netherlands and had the honour of having Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhardt as dinner guests; he was also dispatched to Sweden on an official goodwill visit, being granted a private audience with King Gustav V. In 1947, he became Admiral Superintendent at HM Dockyard, Rosyth., receiving a CB, and was promoted to Vice Admiral a year later. He was appointed Flag Officer, Scotland in 1950. He was advanced to KBE in the 1951 New Year Honours and retired in October of the same year.Listing compiled by historian Colin Mackie He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for the County of Dumabarton on 4 March 1952,The London Gazette: no. 39491. p. 1468. 14 March 1952. and received his final promotion to Admiral on 15 March of the same year.

The series, which premiered November 27, 2008, uncovers the stories behind once well-known R&B; and soul music artists, bands, or groups who exploded onto the Billboard music charts with a string of hits, only to have their career derailed by a major crisis that caused them to be essentially unappreciated by later generations of contemporary R&B; and soul music listeners. The series is produced by production company A. Smith & Co. Productions.http://www.asmithco.com  Format  Each episode usually begins with an artist's upbringing and family, painting a picture of the issues driving them in their music career. Themes of \\"escaping the hard life of the streets\\" and \\"experiencing physical abuse\\", as well as \\"signs of musical genius\\", can be found in many of the lives of Unsung's subjects. Those interviewed in this segment of the show typically are relatives and friends, although some celebrities may be interviewed depending on their relation to the artist. The story then progresses into the trials and triumphs of the artist's early days in the music business, as the artist chases their \\"big break\\" which propels them into the limelight on the way to stardom. Fellow artists, music producers, and managers of that time pepper this section of the show with anecdotes of the artist's musical prowess and potential, and possible hints to any problems or issues the artists may have faced in their personal life or in the music business. The next stage highlights the pinnacle of the artist's fame with the perks and perils that come with it. The show then details a turning point in the artist's life that may have affected their career, some aspect of their personal life or their health. The final act of the show typically highlights a new chapter in the artist's life, new music and plans for the future, or in the case of deceased or retired artists, pays tribute to their musical contributions. Unsung has tailored this formula, depending on the show's subject, to portray artists whose \\"turning point\\" occurred for more business or personal reasons, and who may have recovered from it to continue a far less famous, but rewarding, career. An example includes The Spinners, a legendary R&B; group with 17 Billboard Top 40 hits (7 of which were in the top 10) between 1961 and 1980, yet they have never received a Grammy Award nor been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.  Reception  As of 2010, Unsung has enjoyed steady growth, particularly in African-American households, as each season has aired. After four seasons, Unsung won an NAACP Image Award in the \\"Outstanding Information Series or Special\\" category. Others nominated in this category for 2011 were Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ and Washington Watch with Roland Martin. And as of 2018, the series has garnered six NAACP Image Awards. The Unsung series has provided a platform for artists to tell their own stories as well as given a sense of closure to both the series' fans and the families of the artists who have died, as in the case of Roger Troutman of Zapp. Troutman's brother stated that the public was finally realized the uncertainty about what happened between Roger and Larry Troutman the fatal morning of the 1999 incident that led to death. While the show has enjoyed strong ratings and critical acclaim, it has also on occasion been criticized for not including some important facts. Jody Watley underscored these assessments in a series of YouTube videos made after the Shalamar episode premiered. (Shalamar was a popular R&B; group which included Watley among its members). Similarly, some relatives of David Ruffin made their complaints known after his Unsung episode premiered. Recording artist Stephanie Mills has stated she is not a fan of the show. She admits that she has been approached by producers of the series to either be a commentator or the star of an episode, but she denied their requests. She does not believe she is \\"unsung\\".  Unsung Hollywood  In October 2013, TV One announced Unsung would receive a spin-off titled Unsung Hollywood, to premiere on February 26, 2014. Unsung Hollywood focuses on actors and comedians, as well as prominent films and TV shows influential in the African American community.

Wittman says he wrote the song in 20 minutes, and that it contains musical references to songs by Snoop Dogg.

History The Campton Town Hall has been operating continuously since 1874, primarily as the administrative offices for Campton Township in Kane County, Illinois. Settlers first arrived in Campton Township in 1835 and originally held town meetings in the home of Ever Chafee. The meeting place later bounced between different schools before the local citizens decided to construct a township meeting hall in 1874. This was an unusual step, as most unincorporated, rural areas of the time only held meetings in schools. A parade was held for the structure in 1935 in honor of its service. In 1975, plans for a new town hall were drawn and the Campton Town Hall was in danger of demolition, primarily due to its lack of heating and sanitation. However, the locals were able raise enough money to install these facilities in the building, and the town hall continued to serve the community. On November 24, 1980, the U. S. Department of the Interior recognized the Campton Town Hall as a Historic Place. Architecture The building is rectangular with a wood frame and riverstone foundation. The frame is covered in clapboard painted white. Sets of three four-over-four windows are on the north and south. The east side of the hall is the entrance and faces Town Hall Street just south of Illinois Route 64. The pair of doors each have four panels and sit under individual transoms. Originally, the building had a wood platform on this exposure, but this was replaced with concrete steps around 1940. The original chimney was altered to a two-flue chimney to allow for a heating system. Louver vents were also installed on the east and west around this time. The original roof had cedar shingles, but these were replaced with grey asphalt shingles. The interior has ceilings above pine flooring. wooden wainscotting is present up to above the floor and is painted glaucous. Doors and windows are trimmed with wood moulding. There is a chimney on the west wall. A door was added on the west wall during restoration to allow access to the utility room.

He served as Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire during five separate terms. He was preceded by Midhat Pasha. Mehmed Rushdi Pasha was a fervent supporter of the Tanzimat. He believed that the empire would lag behind the West if no attempt was made to modernize itself. He served as a Translator of Military texts as well as a military colonel in his youth. He was born in 1811, and died on 27 March 1882. Early life Mutercim Rushdie Pasha was born to a poor boatman in 1811 in the town of Ayancik. When he was three years old his family moved to Istanbul circa 1814. In Istanbul Rushdie Pasha studied in the local school system. As he got older he was recruited by the military and studied under a man named Lord Tanase. Under the guidance of Lord Tanase he mastered the ability to read write and speak the French language. After working together with Lord Tanase, Rushdie Pasha was discovered to be an asset to the Ottoman Empire. He caught the eye of Sultan Abdulhamid. Sultan Abdulhamid assigned Rushdie Pasha a translation position with some of the best translators in the Ottoman Empire. Rushdie became very well known in the Empire for his translations. Two of his most important translated texts were manuals of French military tactics and military training. After these translations he was once again promoted and sent along to England to study and translate more western works. Rushdie was surrounded by western ideas similar to his reformist colleagues that would later push for Tanzimat reforms. Military career In 1839 at the age of 28 he was promoted to the rank of Colonel. Rushdie Pasha continued his military career and in 1843 he became a leader in the military council. He continued to contribute his talents to the military until he resigned from his position at the age of 42 in 1853. He was nominated to be the Governor of Damascus but Rushdie Pasha denied the position. He even declined other government positions to avoid working with Mehmed Ali Pasha. First term * During Abd√ºlmecit's reign: 24 December 1859 ‚Äì 28 May 1860 On 24 December 1859, Mutercim Rushdie Pasha was appointed as the Grand Vizir of the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Abdulmecit for the first time. Rushdie Pasha was constantly involved in internal conflicts having to do with the policy of the Ottoman government. There was a notable friction between Rushdie Pasha and Mehmed Pasha as well as other officials who wanted to do things differently from Rushdie Pasha. This internal drama made it difficult for Rushdie Pasha to hold on to his position of Grand Vizier for very long and was replaced on 28 May 1860. This will continue to me a motif in Rushdie Pasha's service; his controversial viewpoints and strong will lead to other short lived terms as the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire. After his first stressful service as Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, Rushdie Pasha took an excursion to Berlin in 1860. Shortly after visiting Berlin, he visited Paris and even toured other European countries. In 1861 Rushdie Pasha returned to Istanbul. Second term * During Abd√ºlaziz's reign: 5 June 1866 ‚Äì 11 February 1867 On 5 June 1866, Rushdie Pasha was appointed as Grand Vizier to the Ottoman Empire for the second time in his career despite the anti-reformist opposition in the government. Even Though Rushdie beat his rivals in the Government for the seat of Grand Vizir, the internal resistance to reform led to his removal from the seat of Grand Vizier for the second time on 11 February 1867. Third term * During Abd√ºlaziz's reign: 19 October 1872 ‚Äì 15 March 1873 On 19 October 1872 Sultan Abdulaziz appointed Rushdie Pasha as Grand Vizier for the third time in his now politically oriented career. This was This term was short lived and only lasted approximately four months. Rushdie Pasha was removed once again due to his reformist viewpoints. There was insurrection and uprisings inside of the empire during this time. Students were performing demonstrations and spreading reformist ideals. The civil uproar and unrest lead to Rushdie Pasha being once again appointed as Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire for his first term on 12 May 1876. This was done to appease the reformists and to stabilize the unrest. However this did not save Sultan Abdulaziz, he was assassinated by his ministers on 30 May 1876. The Sultan's assassination was played off as a Suicide. Fourth term * During Murat V's and Abd√ºlhamit II's reign: 12 May 1876 ‚Äì 19 December 1876 After the disposal of Abdulaziz, officials of the Ottoman Empire appointed Murad V as the new Sultan. Sultan Murad V was young, and heavily influenced by the ideas of the Tanziamat reforms. Sultan Murad V was heavily influenced by the French and other Western cultures as well. Rushdie Pasha continued to serve as Grand Vizier under Sultan Murad V. Sultan Murad V was supposed to pass a constitution. However even with the support of Rushdie Pasha, Murad V was not able to pass reforms and was replaced by his brother Sultan Abdulhamit II. Abdulhamit II was not favored by Rushdie Pasha. Rushdie Pasha did not agree with Abdulhamit II's indulgent and lack of focus in the affairs of the government. He confronted Abdulhamit II about skipping a conference meeting due to claiming \\"illness.\\" Rushdie Pasha resigned from the position of Grand Vizir on 19 December 1876 at the age of 65 due to his lack of tolerance for Sultan Abdulhamit II. Abdulhamit II was centralizing power and removing any reforms accomplished. Abdulhamit II took power away from the government and suspended the constitution. Fifth term and death * During Abd√ºlhamit II reign: 28 May 1878 ‚Äì 4 June 1878 . Rushdie Pasha was appointed for his fifth and last term on 28 May 1876. He immediately began investigating the recent assassination of former Sultan Abdulmecit. After making a few accusations and pursuing the investigation of the assassination, he was removed from office after only one week. After making his accusations he was tried by the court of the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Abdulhamit sentenced Rushdie Pasha to a life of exile. Mutercim Rushdie Pasha died from a disease in his nervous system in Manisa shortly after his sentenced exile on 27 March 1882 at the age of 71. His body was buried in the garden of Hatuniye Mosque.

As individual females synchronize with males nearby, waves of alternating bright light and darkness seem to travel across the landscape. Firefly displays typically occur in early June near Elkmont, Tennessee, in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, near Gatlinburg. Description A typical Photinus is a \\"lightning-bug firefly\\" (as opposed to the so-called \\"glowworm firefly\\") because it emits light in its winged (imago) stage. Both male and female adults produce mating signals with an abdominal light organ or \\"lantern\\". Members of Photinus are called \\"rover fireflies\\" because typically males fly about singly, not in groups, flashing a species-specific pattern until a receptive female responds with her species-specific flashing signal. Photinus Carolinus fireflies in Pennsylvania, 2013 P. carolinus was the first North American species found to show synchronized flashing behavior. Synchronized flashing by male fireflies is common in South Asia, where huge aggregates of males perch on specific trees to create a bright display of flashing. The synchronized flashing of P. carolinus males occurs in aggregates of flying fireflies. The timing of flashing depends somewhat on temperature, but the flash pattern of a male P. carolinus is typically four to eight very bright flashes emitted over two to four seconds, followed by a dark period of eight to 12 seconds. The female reply is much less bright, a pulsed signal during the dark period of the male. Scientists have suggested one reason for the synchronized flashing is to create a synchronized dark period, during which males can search for female responses without being distracted by signals from other males. When males of P. carolinus detect a female response, a cluster of males will form surrounding the female, with as many as 20 males energetically walking, flashing, and attempting to mount the female or nearby males. The female does not necessarily mate with the first male to reach her, but may show avoidance behaviors to several males before permitting one to begin copulation. In the early stages of copulation, other males may try to separate the couple, but once the mating pair has moved to stage 2 copulation (tail-to- tail), the unmated males fly off to seek females elsewhere. Habitat One of its small population ranges is Elkmont, Tennessee. The species is also found elsewhere in the Smoky Mountains, usually at elevations near , and has been observed as far north as Pennsylvania. Tourist attraction Increasing numbers of people come each year to a trailhead near Elkmont to see them. Scientists use a degree day model to try to predict the onset of each year's peak display. Driving and parking near Great Smoky Mountains National Park are strictly regulated during the two-week P. carolinus mating season. Would-be visitors are required to park at the Sugarlands Visitor Center and wait for a trolley to take them to the viewing site. On weekends there may be a four-hour wait for transportation. The firefly display near Elkmont attracted more than a thousand visitors nightly in early June 2011. A biologist who has studied the fireflies expressed concern about increased crowds at the park, saying, \\"The bulk of people are respectful ... But the total number of people is obscene.\\" References External links Category:Lampyridae Category:Bioluminescent insects Category:Beetles of North America Category:Beetles described in 1956 Category:Natural history of the Great Smoky Mountains ","title":"Photinus carolinus"},{"id":"32109051","text":"Li Chengpeng () (born September 22, 1968) is a prominent writer and social critic in the People's Republic of China.

In 1945, the first Tongan was sent to train as a weather observer in Suva, monitored by the Fiji Government and the New Zealand Air Force. The South Pacific Air Transport Council (SPATC) was established a year later by New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom, France and other Oceanic islands many islands of the Pacific which enabled new weather stations to be built across the Pacific, including Tonga. In 1948, the first educated weather operator in Tongo set up the Fuaamotu Airport Weather Station, but closed down three years later, so in October 1951, two more officers were recruited to form the Nuku‚Äôalofa weather office. It became the Tonga Meteorological Service when the Tongan government took control in 1970, although New Zealand were active until 1986 in allocating funds and paying the wages of the meteorologists who worked at the centre.

History La Tech won the first game of the series 27‚Äì0 on November 28, 1935. La Tech and USM were conference foes in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association from 1935‚Äì41. In addition, La Tech and USM were both founding members of the Gulf States Conference, which began play in 1948. The two football programs competed against each other every season from 1946‚Äì72. The Bulldogs and Golden Eagles played 11 times from 1975‚Äì92. The name of the rivalry was coined by Mississippi Southern alumnus and Louisiana Tech head football coach Maxie Lambright. Following the Bulldogs' 23‚Äì22 victory over the Golden Eagles in 1976, Lambright declared, \\"This is the finest rivalry in Dixie.\\" Thereafter, the event became known as \\"Rivalry in Dixie.\\" The word \\"Dixie\\" refers to privately issued currency from banks in Louisiana.\\"Dixie\\" Originated From Name \\"Dix\\" An Old Currency ‚Äì New Orleans American May 29 1916, Vol. 2 No. 150, Page 3 Col. 1 Louisiana Works Progress Administration (WPA), LOUISiana Digital Library These banks issued ten-dollar notes,Ten Dollar Note George Francois Mugnier Collection, Louisiana Digital Library labeled \\"Dix\\", French for \\"ten\\", on the reverse side. The notes were known as \\"Dixies\\" by English-speaking southerners, and the area around New Orleans and the French-speaking parts of Louisiana came to be known as \\"Dixieland\\". Eventually, usage of the term broadened to refer to most of the Southern United States. Southern Miss is known for the \\"World-Famous Dixie Darlings.\\" The USM dance team was established in 1954 as the Dixie Maids. However, after only one week of existence, the band director Dr. Raymond Mannoni decided to change their name to the Dixie Darlings after a Mobile reporter remarked \\"Look at those delightful darlings of Dixie\\" after seeing the Dixie Darlings perform. The Dixie Darlings debuted at the Mississippi Southern vs. Alabama game in Montgomery on September 17, 1954. Since then, the Dixie Darlings have become a fixture at Golden Eagle football games. In addition, the Pride of Mississippi Marching Band plays \\"Are You from Dixie?\\" following the extra point attempt following a Golden Eagle touchdown. Dixie Theatre in Ruston, Louisiana. The historic Dixie Theatre is a landmark in the heart of downtown Ruston, Louisiana. The theater was built in 1928 as the Astor Theater and showed films and presented concerts. The theater was renamed in 1932 as the Rialto and become the Dixie Theatre in the 1950s after being purchased by the Dixie Theater Corporation of New Orleans. The famous flashing star crowning the marquee was added in 1956. In 1996, the Dixie Center of the Arts was established to reinstate the Dixie Theatre as a center for entertainment and the arts in downtown Ruston as it hosts full seasons of events, parties, and concerts. In 2008, La Tech athletics director and head football coach Derek Dooley and USM athletics director Richard Giannini signed a four-game contract to renew the rivalry. Giannini stated, \\"We look forward to renewing our series with Louisiana Tech, one of our oldest rivalries in terms of games, and a quality opponent in the Western Athletic Conference.\\" In 2010, Southern Miss won the first game of the renewed series, 13‚Äì12 on a rainy night in Ruston. The two teams opened their 2011 season in Hattiesburg in spite of heavy rain and high winds from Tropical Storm Lee on Saturday, September 3, 2011 on Fox Sports Net. Southern Miss won a nail-biter 19‚Äì17 thanks to a last minute field goal by Danny Hrapmann. With Louisiana Tech's move to Conference USA in 2013, Rivalry in Dixie is once again a conference rivalry. Currently, Southern Miss leads the series 35‚Äì17 over Louisiana Tech.

A kitchenette is equipped with counter top, sink, refrigerator, microwave, and ice maker. History The museum began in the 1950s from the avocations of Norman Herrett (1904-1979), owner/operator of a Twin Falls, Idaho jewelry store. Herrett's astronomical interests led him to construct a small building behind the store with an observatory on the roof and a home- built planetarium on the ground floor. He also built a room adjoining the store to exhibit the anthropological artifacts he collected on trips through the Americas, and later, the works of local artists. The Herrett Arts and Science Center, as it was known, featured an eclectic blend of exhibit styles, including a number of interactive displays with motorized action. The planetarium featured a variety of purpose-built projectors and special effects, and the observatory housed a 12.5\\" Newtonian and 10\\" Maksutov telescope. Local students were trained to present programs for school groups in the planetarium and museum. In 1972, Herrett forged an agreement with the fledgling College of Southern Idaho to transfer his collections to the College in exchange for the construction of a building on the campus to house them.

It is an early example of a blues which incorporates Afro-Cuban rhythms and percussive instruments. \\"Early in the Mornin'\\" became a hit, reaching number three in Billboard magazine's race records chart. Jordan and his band later performed the song in the 1949 film Look Out Sister. It served as inspiration for James Brown and Chuck Berry. Various artists have recorded renditions of \\"Early in the Mornin'\\", often spelled as \\"Early in the Morning\\" (not to be confused with the earlier Sonny Boy Williamson I song \\"Early in the Morning\\"). Original song \\"Early in the Mornin'\\" has the structure of a twelve-bar blues with a strong rhythmic element. It is credited to Jordan, Tympany Five bassist Dallas Bartley, and Leo Hickman and has been variously described as a rumba, a samba, a calypso- influenced song, and a \\"Caribbean-flavoured number\\". As with many Jordan songs, it also has a comic element. The song begins with Latin-style percussion and Jordan calls out \\"Hey Pedro! ... Where is Lolito?\\" After a twelve-bar piano solo intro, Jordan's vocal begins: Backing Jordan on vocal and alto sax are Wild Bill Davis on piano, Bartley on bass, and Christopher Columbus on drums. Percussion is provided by band members Aaron Isenhall, Eddie Johnson, and Carl Hogan. Look Out Sister Poster for the 1949 Louis Jordan film Look Out Sister Louis Jordan recorded a second version of \\"Early in the Mornin'\\" in 1949 for Look Out Sister \\"a sixty-seven-minute picture that featured Louis as a musical cowboy\\". His performance of the song was filmed in front of a U.S. southwestern-style ranch house with the band dressed in 1940s Hollywood cowboy garb. In his autobiography, James Brown recalled seeing Jordan's films when he was young and was inspired by the showmanship of performances such as \\"Early in the Mornin'\\" and especially \\"Caldonia\\".

Their first album, Belongs to the Dead, was released in 2006. They released a 7\\" single, \\"Spirit Desire\\", in 2009, on Tiny Engines. They released two more albums before announcing a hiatus in March 2013; however, their record label Run for Cover Records announced in August 2013 that the band's breakup was not official. Their fourth album, Charmer, came out in June 2014, and their fifth, Spin, in 2017. History =Early years and Tigers Jaw (2006‚Äì12)= The band's name is a reference to a song by lo-fi band The Microphones. They also have a number of songs whose titles reference songs by the band. Members Ben Walsh and Adam McIlwee started the group during high school, with Brianna Collins joining the after the first couple of months. They have cited Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance as early musical influences. AbsolutePunk gave their self-titled album a generally positive review, noting that \\"Tigers Jaw is fueled by emotionally-driven lyrics brought to life by vocalist Adam McIlwee, whose voice is one of those that reveal passion while at the same time giving the impression that he's barely trying. Aforementioned opener \\"The Sun\\" is one of the better tracks on the album, offering up a well-organized mix of Tigers Jaw's two personas.\\" Another punk music website, Punknews.org, in their critique of the band's second eponymous album, felt that the tracks \\"'Plane vs. Tank vs. Submarine' and 'Chemicals' were particularly notable for \\"solid guitar work in the form of weeping, goosebump-inducing solos. Strong vocal harmonies and bouncy guitar work carry both 'I Saw Water' and 'Heat' to heights other bands would have a hard time reaching.\\" In November 2012, the group supported Title Fight on their headlining US tour. =Charmer (2013‚Äì2016)= On March 21, 2013, Tigers Jaw made an announcement on their Tumblr: Many fans interpreted this announcement to mean that the band was breaking up. However, both Walsh and Collins clarified that they would continue with Tigers Jaw as a two-piece. Members of Basement filled in during their 2013 UK tour, while members of Balance and Composure filled in for the US dates. After the announcement, Brianna did an interview, where she said that \\"I know Ben and I really want to work on a new record, put something out. It‚Äôll happen.\\" After leaving Tigers Jaw, Adam McIlwee pursued his experimental solo project Wicca Phase Springs Eternal. Under this name, McIlwee blended emo and goth esthetics with cloud rap and trap, became a key member in musical groups such as THRAXXHOUSE and GothBoiClique, and famously collaborated with the late Lil Peep. Tigers Jaw announced their next studio album, Charmer, on March 21, 2014, along with the single \\"Nervous Kids\\". Charmer reached #49 on the Billboard Charts. They played a U.S. tour with Touch√© Amor√© and Dads in the summer of 2014. They went on a U.S. tour with Lemuria and Somos in spring 2015. In May 2015, it was announced that Tigers Jaw would be touring the U.S. with New Found Glory and Yellowcard in the fall of 2015. In June 2015, the band played in Brazil and performed three acoustic shows in New York, Philadelphia, and Somerville. Tigers Jaw toured Australia in July 2015. In August 2015, they toured in the UK/Europe with Foxing. The band then performed various acoustic shows before undertaking another UK/Europe tour with Basement in February and March 2016. =spin, Eyes Shut, and sixth studio album (2017‚Äìpresent)= On March 22, 2017, spin was announced for release on May 19 through Black Cement Records, with a U.S. tour starting the same day. The album saw the release of three singles: \\"Guardian,\\" \\"June\\" and \\"Window.\\" In 2018, the band also performed several shows commemorating the ten-year anniversary of the band's self-titled album. In 2019, the band released a new stand-alone single, \\"Eyes Shut.\\" The track was recorded in the sessions for spin, but did not make the final cut. The single served as the title track of a new EP, which paired it with acoustic versions of \\"Guardian,\\" \\"Follows\\" and \\"Eyes Shut.\\" 2019 also saw the addition of touring musicians Teddy Roberts and Colin Gorman as full-time members of Tigers Jaw. In 2020, the band released a new song entitled \\"Warn Me.\\" It marked the band's first release as part of the Hopeless Records roster. Although \\"Warn Me\\" does not appear on the band's as-yet-untitled sixth studio album, the band confirmed they had been in the studio with Will Yip working on it.

Life and times Meyer was born in Ramos Mej√≠a, a western suburb of Buenos Aires, and was raised in Puerto San Juli√°n, in remote Santa Cruz Province. He completed four years of a Licentiate course in hospitality management studies in Buenos Aires, though he did not ultimately graduate. Meyer became a tour guide in 1979, and was later the proprietor of a Santa Cruz tour operator. He married the former Mar√≠a Lavirgen Enr√≠quez, and they had three children. Meyer entered public service upon his appointment as Provincial Minister of Tourism by the newly elected Governor N√©stor Kirchner, in 1991. He worked closely with private investors from early in his tenure, notably with the founder of The North Face outfitters, Douglas Tompkins, who in 1992 purchased a ranch along the Santa Cruz River to establish the first of numerous nature preserves owned by Tompkins in Argentina. He focused promotional efforts on El Calafate and the neighboring Los Glaciares National Park, and approved the construction of the Comandante Armando Tola International Airport at El Calafate, opened in 2000. Kirchner became President of Argentina in 2003. A subsequent dispute with the Vice President, Daniel Scioli, led to the dismissal of the Secretary of Tourism, Germ√°n P√©rez, and of a number of other officials recommended by Scioli. Citing the need to \\"retake control of an office which needed a change in personnel,\\" Kirchner named Meyer to the post on August 21. Meyer took office amid a strong recovery in tourism in Argentina. He and Presidential Spokesman Enrique Albistur sought to further promote the sector by announcing the Marca Pa√≠s (\\"Country Brand\\") initiative, a concept akin to \\"nation branding\\" which served the dual purpose of obtaining political support from well-known figures in Argentine sports. Kirchner's wife and successor, President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, had the Tourism Secretariat elevated to a cabinet-level post, and on July 1, 2010, Meyer was sworn in as the first Minister of Tourism.

Folkerts worked for Central States Aero in Davenport, Iowa designing and building the prototype Monocoupe Model 22 in four months for Donald Arthur Luscombe. The Monocoupe would go on to become a popular racing aircraft of the 1920s and 1930s. By the end of 1928, 90% of all light planes and 10% of all licensed airplanes owned in the U.S. were Monocoupes, which remained in production until 1950. Folkerts designed a series of winning air racers, the Folkerts SK-1, Folkerts SK-2, and Folkerts SK-3 that won at the National Air Races.

He was born in Koblenz-Ehrenbreitstein, the son of Franz Josef M√§hler and Anna Johanna, n√©e Vacano. He first served an apprenticeship in Dresden with Anton Graff to become a painter and later on, he continued with his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. M√§hler then decided to start a civil career and he became an officer of the secret service Geheime Kabinettskanzlei (secret chancellery) in Vienna, while painting in his spare time. M√§hler was introduced to Ludwig van Beethoven by Beethoven's school day friend Stephan von Breuning in the winter 1803/04. He painted his first portrait of Beethoven, which shows three quarters of the composer's body in an Arcadian landscape, holding a lyre-guitar in his hand. (Today, the painting is located in the Beethoven Memorial, the Pasqualati House in Vienna.) In the 19th century, this illustration ‚Äì one of just a few depictions of Beethoven when he was young ‚Äì mainly became famous due to a lithograph by Josef Kriehuber. Around 1815, M√§hler produced a series of portraits showing contemporary Viennese composers. As written in the Allgemeine Musikzeitung (General music journal) in August 1815, \\"all of them distinguish themselves in a most creditable way through the effectual brush stroke, the descriptive resemblance and the distinctive expression of their soul\\". A half length portrait of Beethoven was part of the series.

As of 2018, Access Now received approximately $5.1 million in funding. __TOC__  History  Access Now was founded by Brett Solomon and Cameran Ashraf in 2009, after the contested Iranian presidential election of that year. During the protests that followed this election, Access Now played a noted role in disseminating the video footage which came out of Iran.  Policy objectives  Access Now has five primary policy areas: * Business and Human Rights - Access Now works with companies to make their practices more transparent, accountable, and human rights-respecting. * Digital Security - Access Now works to ensure that individual online activities are private, safe, and secure. * Freedom of Expression - Access Now advocates for the right of individuals to speak freely, which is critical for disseminating dissent, guaranteeing a free press, and defending human rights. * Net Discrimination - Access Now advocates for a free and open internet, advocating for the net neutrality principle that Internet access should be offered to everyone on a non-discriminatory basis, without favoring certain websites, applications, or services. * Privacy - Access Now defends the right of individuals to privacy. In addition, Access Now has campaigned against internet shutdowns, online censorship, international trade agreements, and government surveillance. Access Now has also supported the use of encryption and thoughtful cybersecurity laws and regulations.  Goals and conference To achieve its goals, Access Now has organized itself into three main programmatic arms: * Policy: Access Now provides principled, pragmatic, and tech-driven policy guidance to governments, corporations, and civil society organizations. * Advocacy: Access Now draws on technological, policy, and campaign expertise to engage the global community in the fight to defend and extend the digital rights of users at risk around the world. * Technology: Access Now provides technology solutions and real-time advice for activists and civil society in circumstances where communications are not open, free, and secure. Access Now maintains a Digital Security Helpline to offer real-time, direct assistance and advice to activists, independent media and civil society organizations. One other activity that Access Now runs is the annual conference, RightsCon, a multistakeholder event that features participants from civil society, tech companies, and users at risk. The conference was first held in Silicon Valley in 2011, followed by events in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2012), Silicon Valley (2014), Manila, Philippines (2015), and Silicon Valley (2016), thus alternating between Silicon Valley and a key city in the Global South. After being held in Brussels and Toronto, RightsCon 2019 took place in Tunis, Tunisia (11-14 June). In 2020, RightsCon was scheduled to be held in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, but as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the meeting will instead take place in a modified online format.  Funding  The majority of Access Now's support comes from foundations and development agencies, with the rest coming from companies, courts, individuals, and civil society organizations. To ensure the independence, and integrity of Access Now, it accepts support contingent upon the following non-negotiables: * Access Now does not accept funding that places its staff, partners, supported communities, or mission at risk. * Access Now does not accept funding that jeopardizes its relationship with its partners, stakeholders, or supported communities and networks. * Access Now does not accept funding that compromises its organizational independence, including funding relationships that may influence its priorities, policy positions, advocacy efforts, regions of focus, or direct action work. * Access Now does not accept funding that poses a risk to its reputation more broadly or with respect to specific programmatic areas of work.

The work of the Circle contributed to the foundation of the integrative science of mind, brain, and behavior in their cultural and bio-social development also known under somewhat vague and imprecise name of cultural-historical psychology. The Vygotsky Circle, also referred to as \\"Vygotsky boom\\" incorporated the ideas of social and interpersonal relations, the practices of empirical scientific research, and \\"Stalinist science\\" based on the discursive practices of the Soviet science in the 1930s.Yasnitsky, A.

A problem with the theories of the Vygotsky Circle and connecting it to the present generation is the biases and misconceptions with the history of Soviet Psychology. The Circle included altogether around three dozen individuals at different periods, including Leonid Sakharov, Boris Varshava, Nikolai Bernstein, Solomon Gellerstein, Mark Lebedinsky, Leonid Zankov, Aleksei N. Leontiev, Alexander Zaporozhets, Daniil Elkonin, Lydia Bozhovich, Bluma Zeigarnik, Filipp Bassin, and many others. German-American psychologist Kurt Lewin and Russian film director and art theorist Sergei Eisenstein are also mentioned as the \\"peripheral members\\" of the Circle.  History of the Circle  The Vygotsky Circle was formed around 1924 in Moscow after Vygotsky moved there from the provincial town of Gomel in Belarus. There at the Institute of Psychology he met graduate students Zankov, Solov'ev, Sakharov, and Varshava, as well as future collaborator Aleksander Luria. The group grew incrementally and operated in Moscow, Kharkiv, and Leningrad; all in the Soviet Union. From the beginning of World War II 1 Sept 1939 to the start of the Great Patriotic War, 22 June 1941, several centers of post-Vygotskian research were formed by Luria, Leontiev, Zankov, and Elkonin. The Circle ended, however, when the Soviet Union was invaded by Germany to start the Great Patriotic War. However, by the end of 1930s a new center was formed around 1939 under the leadership of Luria and Leontiev. In the after-war period this developed into the so- called the \\"School of Vygotsky-Leontiev-Luria\\". Recent studies show that this \\"school\\" never existed as such. There are two problems that are related to the Vygotsky circle. First was the historical recording of the Soviet psychology with innumerable gaps in time and prejudice. Second was the almost exclusive focus on the person, Lev Vygotsky, himself to the extent that the scientific contributions of other notable characters have been considerably downplayed or forgotten.

She is considered a pioneer of the feminist movement in Telugu literary criticism and poetry. Jayaprabha's poetry focusses on women's issues, their problems and stregnths and often attacks established gender norms.  Biography  Jayaprabha was born on 29 July 1957. She did her master's degree in Telugu literature and acquired a Ph.D. from Osmania University for her thesis on the progress and status of Telugu drama. She currently lives in Secundrabad.  Professional career  In 1981 Jayaprabha and K. Satyavathi started a feminist monthly Lohita. Her first collection of poems \\"Yuddhonmukhamga\\" (Towards War) was published in 1984. Jayaprabha's second book of poems \\"Vaamanudi Moodo Paadam\\" (Third foot of Vamana) was published in 1988. This collection contained two of her landmark feminist poems 'Chupulu' (Stares) and 'Pytani tagaleyyali' (Burn the saree). Chupulu translated as 'looks' or sometimes 'stares' is a poem about the male gaze. It begins with the poet-persona describing the assault of stares she endures daily and ends with the poet hoping for the day when women can return the stares and reclaim public spaces for themselves. In 'Pytani tagaleyyali' (Burn the saree) Jayaprabha equates the saree with confirmity to traditional gender norms and says women must abandon the saree in order to break free from traditional gender norms. In 1988 Jayaprabha published \\"Bhavo Kavitvamlo Stri\\" a critique of women in Telugu romantic poetry. The study criticised the representation of women in the works of major male poets. Considered a pioneering work of feminist criticism of Telugu literature, it attracted both controversy and accolades. For a while it was prescribed reading in Bangalore University. In 1991 another collection of poems \\"Ikkad Kursini Varsham, Ekkadi Maghanidi?\\" (The Rain that Falls Here, Where is The Cloud From?) was published. She also published a revised version of her Ph.D. thesis on Telugu theatre \\"Naalugo Goda\\" (Fourth Wall) in the same year. \\"Unforeseen Affection And Other Poems\\" was published in 2005.

Background In the 1990s Arizona's public university system hosted two large public universities in Tucson and Phoenix (University of Arizona and Arizona State University), the smaller Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, and a number of community colleges. There was no teaching-intensive, liberal arts college. In 1990, the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) began exploring the establishment of a liberal arts institution, in part due to anticipated growth in student numbers in the state. A formal proposal was made in 1994.New University in Pima Country: A Report of the Community Advisory Committee to Manuel T. Pacheco, President, The University of Arizona and for Consideration by the Arizona Board of Regents, The University of Arizona, July 1994 AIC was established as \\"Arizona International University\\" in an old IBM plant in Eastern Tucson, where the University of Arizona hoped to later establish a research park, and began to admit students in 1996. Seven faculty were hired, on one-year contracts only, working under a Provost, the sociologist Celestino Fern√°ndez. Fern√°ndez returned to his tenured position at the University of Arizona after a year of poor results, and was replaced at AIC by Paul Rosenblatt. Reorganisation After two more years of low enrollments, a re-organisation took place and AIU was renamed as a \\"College\\". In summer of 1998, AIC lost its independent status and became a college of the University of Arizona.University of Arizona General Catalog 2000-2001 AIC was relocated to a building near the UofA campus on East Helen Street. This was to benefit from economies of scale - facilities for students and administration procedures could be shared with the main campus operations. Curriculum By 1999 a liberal arts curriculum with personalized plans of study was attracting more students. Details from the 2000-2001 Academic Catalog show sixteen faculty members teaching the following degree concentrations Arizona International College, UA Catalog: *Fine & Performing Arts (B.A.) *Humanities (B.A.) *Language & Culture (B.A.) *Liberal Studies (B.A.) *Natural Sciences & Mathematics (B.A.) *Social Sciences (B.A.) Students began with \\"On Becoming a Fully Educated Person\\" Other core classes were \\"Critical Writing and Communication\\", \\"Introduction to Global Perspectives\\", \\"Statistical Techniques for Problems of the Modern World\\", \\"Human Consciousness and the Formation of World Views\\", and a Symposium. Second language and regional study was required. After completing the core, students worked with faculty advisors to design an individual course of study. They also had to satisfy competency in six essential skills, and complete two supervised internships. There were established student exchange relationships with colleges in Mexico, Canada and elsewhere. The student experience was reported as positive. According to the Catalog, \\"AIC prepares students for rich personal, professional, and civic lives in an increasingly complex and integrated world. The College accomplishes this mission in good part through a curriculum designed to ensure the development of a global perspective through an interdisciplinary study of the Liberal Arts and the improvement of specific skills and competencies. AIC is characterized by small classes and frequent faculty/student interaction, required service-learning and career internships, and a senior capstone project allowing students to integrate their undergraduate experience with future educational and/or career goals.\\". AIC stood for \\"Academics, Innovation, Community\\". The end Plans to eventually co-locate AIC with a branch of Pima Community College, in northern Tucson, were mooted but never came to fruition. The President of The University of Arizona, Peter Likins, \\"disestablished\\" Arizona International College in November 2001, just five years after it opened its doors, at the height of severe budget shortfalls in Arizona following the 9-11 attacks and the US fiscal crisis.U. of Arizona Closes Experimental College. The Chronicle of Higher Education. Vol. 48, Iss. 10; pg. A.33 2001. A program of cuts called \\"Focused Excellence\\" was the pretext, along with the claim that too many AIC students tended to transfer to UofA to complete their degrees after their sophomore year. The decision to close was ratified by the Arizona Board of Regents. Strong student protests to keep the College open and to support the faculty were unsuccessful. Existing contracts for the Faculty, some of them lasting until the mid-2000s, were honored (but there were no extensions thereafter). Some continued offering classes until 2005 when the last student graduated. AIC students were 'taught out', although the majority eventually transferred to other faculties at the University of Arizona to complete their degrees. Former AIC Professor Kali Tal notes that although the budget crisis in Arizona was real, AIC was an easy target for closure because none of the faculty had tenure and therefore could easily be dismissed (she does not mention the loss of students to UofA, however).Tal, K. 2000. It's a Beastly Rough Crowd I Run With: Theory and the \\"New University. In P.C. Herman (ed.) Day Late, Dollar Short: The Next Generation and the New Academy. New York: State University of New York Press. Criticisms AIC suffered from its position vis a vis the established Arizona state university system. The faculty in particular felt unsecure, and it took protests at the end of the first year (organised by Kali Tal who was denied a contract renewal), for them to obtain multi-year contracts with advanced notice of termination. Opinion differed on the lack of tenure, with former faculty member Paul Burkhardt saying \\"I believe that the faculty evaluation, reward, and multi-year contract system served AIC faculty well.\\"Burkhardt, P. 2006. Administering Interdisciplinary and Innovative Programs: Lessons from the Rise and Fall of Arizona International College. Issues in Integrative Study 24: 159-172. With hindsight, it appears AIC was established with the aim of offering liberal arts education without adequate recognition of the costs - intensive teaching, small classes, and internships were expensive to operate. The quality of the teaching was good, but only temporary contracts with relatively low pay were offered initially, and the faculty had high teaching loads. There was little or no support to them at the end of their contracts. The main University of Arizona campus was generally hostile to the new upstart institution, intervening to 'manage' it on several occasions. Student numbers were not given a chance to build to sustainable levels before closure was announced. Because AIC was a public institution, there were constraints on increasing student fees to support rising costs. Tal said \\"It would, however, be a case of weeping crocodile tears were I to lament AIC's passing too loudly: at root, the college made promises to students and faculty that were impossible to fulfill. The bottom line is that one can't provide a quality liberal arts education to students on the cheap, even by grossly exploiting the college's faculty.\\" Legacy There have been no efforts to repeat the AIC model in Arizona. Perhaps the closest alternative is the private Prescott College in Prescott, AZ, which preceded AIC and offers a liberal arts model with progressive teaching approaches. Some AIC faculty left academia or retired. The exceptions include founding AIC faculty member Melissa Fitch, who is a University Distinguished Professor at the University of Arizona, Jude Fernando, now Associate Professor of International Development at Clark University, and Paul Burkhardt, now Provost at Prescott College. In 2011 Joisane Peltier was teaching French at Aalto University in Finland. Kali Tal is an editor and researcher at the University of Bern in Switzerland. Edwin Clausen left in 2000 for Daemen College in Amherst, NY and became its President in 2011. References Further reading *Scott, A. & Fern√°ndez, C. 2001.

It was formed on 4 November 1920 as the Votyak Autonomous Oblast (\\"Votyak\\" is an obsolete name for Udmurts, \\"Vot\\" being the obsolete name for Udmurt people) and renamed as the Udmurt Autonomous Oblast in 1932.

An article from the \\"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\\" In 1937, the Constitution of Udmurtia was created and the Supreme Soviet of the Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic gained power. The Supreme Council of Udmurtia declared state sovereignty on 20 September 1990 and the Udmurt ASSR was renamed as the Udmurt Republic on 11 October 1991. History On 27 October 1917, the Bolsheviks gained power in Izhevsk and established a territorial government. The First Congress resolved to join the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in June 1918. In April 1919, Udmurtia was seized by Alexander Kolchak. The Red Army removed Kolchak from power 2 months later, in June 1919. In 1920, the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR established the Votskaya Autonomous Region. In 1932, the Votskaya Autonomous Region was renamed the Udmurt Autonomous Region. On 27 February 1921 the first Regional Communist Conference declared the territory to be an autonomous region. Under the five-year plans from 1929 to 1940, Udmurtia became industrialised. By 1940, literature and professional art grew, and educational and scientific institutions were created. In March 1937 the Second Congress ratified the Udmurt constitution. During World War II, the workers of Udmurtia produced weapons for the Red Army. Udmurtia produced 11,000,000 rifles and carbines in the war, surpassing Germany's industry output. Industrial factories were evacuated from Ukraine to Udmurtia, thus increasing the ethnic Russian population and stimulating economic growth. In 1969, oil plants were established in Udmurtia.

PPP is a combination of several relatively sophisticated GNSS position refinement techniques that can be used with near-consumer-grade hardware to yield near-survey-grade results. PPP uses a single GNSS receiver, unlike standard RTK methods, which use a temporarily fixed base receiver in the field as well as a relatively nearby mobile receiver. PPP methods overlap somewhat with DGNSS positioning methods, which use permanent reference stations to quantify systemic errors.  Methods  PPP relies on two general sources of information: direct observables and ephemerides. Direct observables are data that the GPS receiver can measure on its own. One direct observable for PPP is carrier phase, i.e., not only the timing message encoded in the GNSS signal, but also whether the wave of that signal is going \\"up\\" or \\"down\\" at a given moment. Loosely speaking, phase can be thought of as the digits after the decimal point in the number of waves between a given GNSS satellite and the receiver. By itself, phase measurement cannot yield even an approximate position, but once other methods have narrowed down the position estimate to within a diameter corresponding to a single wavelength (roughly 20 cm), phase information can refine the estimate. Another important direct observable is the differential delay between GNSS signals of different frequencies. This is useful because a major source of position error is variability in how GNSS signals are slowed in the ionosphere, which is affected relatively unpredictably by space weather. The ionosphere is dispersive, meaning that signals of different frequency are slowed by different amounts. By measuring the difference in the delays between signals of different frequencies, the receiver software (or later post- processing) can model and remove the delay at any frequency. This process is only approximate, and non-dispersive sources of delay remain (notably from water vapor moving around in the troposphere), but it improves accuracy significantly. Ephemerides are precise measurements of the GNSS satellites' orbits, made by the geodetic community (the International GNSS Service and other public and private organizations) with global networks of ground stations. Satellite navigation works on the principle that the satellites' positions at any given time are known, but in practice, micrometeoroid impacts, variation in solar radiation pressure, and so on mean that orbits are not perfectly predictable. The ephemerides that the satellites broadcast are earlier forecasts, up to a few hours old, and are less accurate (by up to a few meters) than carefully processed observations of where the satellites actually were. Therefore, if a GNSS receiver system stores raw observations, they can be processed later against a more accurate ephemeris than what was in the GNSS messages, yielding more accurate position estimates than what would be possible with standard realtime calculations. This post-processing technique has long been standard for GNSS applications that need high accuracy. More recently, projects such as APPS, the Automatic Precise Positioning Service of NASA JPL, have begun publishing improved ephemerides over the internet with very low latency. PPP uses these streams to apply in near realtime the same kind of correction that used to be done in post- processing.  Applications  Precise positioning is increasingly used in the fields including robotics, autonomous navigation, agriculture, construction, and mining. The major weaknesses of PPP, compared with conventional consumer GNSS methods, are that it takes more processing power, it requires an outside ephemeris correction stream, and it takes some time (up to tens of minutes) to converge to full accuracy. This makes it relatively unappealing for applications such as fleet tracking, where centimeter-scale precision is generally not worth the extra complexity, and more useful in areas like robotics, where there may already be an assumption of onboard processing power and frequent data transfer.

It is part of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway. The largest portions are operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. It is separated from motor traffic, and many sections also separate pedestrians from cyclists. The greenway is parallel to the Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive for a majority of its length. Parts of the greenway were built at different times. Most of the greenway was built in the 1930 to 1950s in conjunction with the nearby FDR Drive, with exceptions: * Waterside Plaza: 1973 * East River Waterfront: Late 1990s * Stuyvesant Cove: 2002 * United Nations portion (under construction): 2015-24 Route New York City Waterfalls along the East River Greenway at Pier 35 The greenway runs along the East Side, from Battery Park and past South Street Seaport to a dead end at 125th Street, East Harlem with a gap from 41st to 60th streets in Midtown where pedestrians use busy First and Second Avenues to get around United Nations Headquarters between the Upper East Side and Kips Bay portions of the Greenway. Some places are narrow due to sinkholes being blocked off by protective fencing, and one part squeezes between the highway and the dock of Con Edison's East River Station, requiring slower speeds. Other parts are shared space with motor access to Waterside Plaza or a filling station. Approximately near the southeast end is in the shadow of the elevated FDR Drive. This part is to be improved by the East River Esplanade project. In February 2019, NYC Parks allocated $75 million to complete the esplanade within East Harlem, East Midtown, and the Lower East Side. In the summer of 2008 the East River Greenway, along with the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, provided viewing locations to see the New York City Waterfalls. Components =East Harlem= Section in East Harlem with a sinkhole The East Harlem section runs from the Triborough Bridge ramp at 124th Street to the Gracie Mansion site at 90th Street. It contains four footbridges across the FDR Drive as well as a footbridge, the Wards Island Bridge, to Randalls and Wards Islands at 103rd Street. A connection to the Harlem River Greenway at 132nd Street is expected to be built between 2021 and 2024. Although the park is in East Harlem, where all residents have access to a pocket park, neighborhood park, or major park within , amenities are limited in this section of the greenway. This decrepit portion of the East River Greenway has little open space and is poorly maintained; it also has no recreation facilities. the section between 107th and 114th Streets is closed off and construction is not expected to begin until 2021. NYC Parks had budgeted $25 million for renovations to this section of the esplanade. At 90th Street the Greenway rises to a walkway above the double-decker FDR Drive that resembles the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. = Carl Schurz Park = John Finley Walk in the park, a promenade named after John Huston Finley, is also for bicycles The East River Greenway then passes along Carl Schurz Park at , near the location of Gracie Mansion, and overlooks the waters of Hell Gate and Wards Island in the East River. The Greenway is also the park's waterfront promenade, a deck built over the FDR Drive. The park is bordered on the west by East End Avenue and on the south by Gracie Square, the extension of East 84th Street to the river. =Upper East Side= 81st Street ramp replaced stairway in 2017 This section continues at 81st Street and goes down to the Queensboro Bridge, with footbridges at 78th, 71st, and 63rd Streets. The part of the greenway nearest the Queensboro Bridge was the topic of 197-a plans released by Community Board 8 in 2002, and again in 2006. Proposals include reusing a heliport New York City Department of Sanitation building at 59th Street, renovating existing parks nearby (including the Andrew Haswell Green Park between 60th and 62nd Streets), and using a disused vehicular ramp to connect the greenway to York Avenue at 60th Street. This renovation was funded by a development project at 73rd Street by the City University of New York and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Further, $23 million from NYC Parks and $15 million from Rockefeller University were allocated to complete renovations to the section of the greenway between 62nd and 63rd Streets, which started in 2015. =United Nations= South of 60th Street, to 38th Street, the greenway enters its only undeveloped section, save for a small section accessed by a footbridge at 50th Street. In October 2011, the city and state reached an agreement to use the western portion of Robert Moses Playground at 41st Street for an expansion of the United Nations Headquarters campus. In exchange, the United Nations Development Corporation would pay $73 million to fund the development of the gap in the Greenway between 38th and 60th streets. Designs for this part of the greenway were revealed in November 2013. The new design, which incorporates an amphitheater and a floating pier, is proposed to open in three phases. The first was to open in 2015 and the last by 2024. The three parts are between 38th, 41st, 53rd, and 60th Streets, with three gathering nodes along the way. In April 2017, the city committed $100 million in funding toward building this part of the greenway. The greenway section between 53rd and 60th Streets began construction in November 2019 with expected completion in 2022, and will include an ADA-accessible bridge at 54th Street. =Kips Bay/Waterside= This approximately portion of the greenway, accessed by a pedestrian crosswalk at 37th Street, contains both the East 34th Street Ferry Landing and the East 34th Street Heliport, and formerly also was near the East 34th Street Ferry Landing. The greenway portion and the apartment buildings that make up Waterside Plaza (as well as the neighboring United Nations International School) were constructed on top of platforms supported by over 2,000 concrete piles sunk into the East River. Developed by Richard Ravitch, the first apartment buildings opened in 1973 and the complex and greenway section was completed the following year. = Stuyvesant Cove Park = Looking south from Stuyvesant Cove Park The greenway enters Stuyvesant Cove Park (at ), a public park that runs from 23rd Street to 18th Street, east of Avenue C. It is located to the south of Waterside Plaza and to the north of the East River Park, connecting to the Captain Patrick J. Brown Walk on the south end. Dance company rehearsing on the stage at Stuyvesant Cove Park The park is located on the former brownfield site of a cement plant and a parking lot. A Riverwalk mixed-use development that would have included residential units, offices, a hotel and a marina was proposed in the 1980s but abandoned in 1992. A plan released in 1997 gave way to the current park. Surplus cement dumped from trucks into the East River has created a small beach in the middle of the park near the end of 20th Street. The park, which was completed in 2002, cost $8.3 million and was designed by Donna Walcavage Landscape Architecture. Solar 1, an environmental learning center with a small outdoor stage for public performances, is located at the north end of the park. =Captain Patrick J. Brown Walk= Captain Patrick J. Brown Walk The next part of the greenway is the Captain Patrick J. Brown Walk (at ), a brick-paved walkway that connects Stuyvesant Cove Park on the north to East River Park to the south. Designed for use by pedestrians and cyclists, it runs approximately between 15th and 18th streets, and Avenues C and D, and was named in 2002. 15th Street bottleneck It was named after Captain Patrick J. Brown, a firefighter who died in the September 11 attacks, and who lived in nearby Stuyvesant Town. The East River Blueway plan between 38th Street and the Brooklyn Bridge, released on February 7, 2013, would elevate the walkway above the FDR Drive, with ramps rising to a gradual pedestrian bridge located where the 15th Street bottleneck is now.Blueway website Then-Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer pledged $3.5 million toward the whole plan. =East River Park= Then, the greenway goes into East River Park (at ), which is a public park located on the Lower East Side. The park stretches from East 12th Street down to Montgomery Street on the east side of the FDR Drive. The southern entrance boasts good views of the Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge. The amphitheater, built in 1941 just south of Grand Street, has been reconstructed and is often used for public performances. The park includes football, baseball and soccer fields, tennis, basketball and handball courts, a running track, and bike paths. Fishing is another popular activity. The park is bisected by the Williamsburg Bridge. =East River Waterfront= Construction site, 2013 The last part of the greenway is the East River Waterfront Project, also referred to as the \\"East River Esplanade\\", though the latter name includes other features along the waterfront. It consists of along the East River waterfront between Montgomery Street, along South Street, to the Battery Maritime Building east of Battery Park. A bike lane in Pike Street connects to the Manhattan Bridge. The project aims to rehabilitate the existing waterfront space and connect it to two existing waterfront parks, Battery Park and East River Park. Upon completion in 2015, the East River Esplanade is slated to feature three rebuilt piers (14, 15, and 35) new glass pavilions underneath the elevated FDR Drive, new bike lanes, recreational facilities, and waterfront seating.  Origins  The East River waterfront in Lower Manhattan was known for heavy maritime activity, with over 40 piers in operation by the later 1950s. The busy waterfront provided easy access to New York Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean in the south, the Hudson River on the west, with a connection to the Erie Canal. However, the rise of truck traffic and the transfer of port activity to the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal drastically reduced maritime traffic on the river after the middle 20th century. With many piers now defunct, ambitious plans have been made to reclaim and reuse the pier space. The north-south arterial highway, the FDR Drive, was moved to an elevated location to allow convenient access to the piers.\\"Transforming the East River Waterfront\\", Sec. 2, pg. 14 New York City Department of City Planning In the 1970s, the Water Street Access Plan was drafted to extend the confines of the traditional Financial District eastward and create a new business corridor along Water Street, south of Fulton Street. Noting the success of the World Financial Center, the East Side Landing plan was created in the 1980s to add commercial and office buildings along the waterfront, again south of Fulton Street, similar to Battery Park City. This plan never materialized. In 1982, there was a plan to expand the Seaport Museum of New York and attract tourist activity. Parts of the district were devoted to retail, including the main building of the Fulton Fish Market. A modern shopping mall was then built on Pier 17 and was opened in September 11, 1985.Richard F.

New York Times, 12 September 1985. Proquest Furthermore, the Fulton Fish Market formerly located around South Street and Fulton Street, was pressured to relocate in 2005 to Hunts Point in the Bronx due to plans for the redevelopment of the Manhattan waterfront. The pedestrian and bike path was first established in the late 1990s between Montgomery Street in the Lower East Side and Broad Street in the Financial District. Benches were also added along the partially restored waterfront. The pedestrian path/bikeway has been well received by community members. Drawbacks exist however:\\"Transforming the East River Waterfront\\", Sec. 2, pg. 20 New York City Department of City PlanningDunlap, David W. (August 1, 2002). \\"Plans for the Neglected East River Shoreline\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 2012-07-24. *The pedestrian path and bikeway are not segregated from each other; there is one lane in each direction which is shared by pedestrians and bikers. *The path curves around FDR Drive viaduct pillars. *The path occupies a narrow portion of the space below the viaduct; in most cases, the rest of the space is used as parking facilities and storage space. *Amenities are few. *Its legacy as a service and commercial zone offer limited pedestrian access. *City services, such as the Department of Sanitation, use the waterfront for equipment. During Michael Bloomberg's tenure as mayor, he spearheaded the PlaNYC 2030 initiative, which highlights projects and plans to transform the city by the year 2030. An important focus was put on the waterfront, including the East River waterfront. Bloomberg also stressed the importance of ferry transport, as an alternative to existing land transport options. The Pier 11/Wall Street ferry terminal has long operated East River waterfront, with regular trips to New Jersey. In June 2011, a ferry service to piers on Brooklyn's waterfront started.

A year-long study was undertaken in 2004, allowing designers to derive ways that would \\"enhance waterfront access\\". Other groups critical to the project's planning phase include the New York City Department of Transportation, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Economic Development Corporation, the Department of City Planning and other agencies and groups. $137 million was secured with the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, and work began on a \\"pilot section\\" in 2009 between John Street and Wall Street. According to the Department of City Planning, the overall plan is listed as: *The esplanade itself: The new esplanade will consist of a recreation zone along the water's edge with seating and plantings, pavilions under the FDR Drive to support outdoor activities, and a bikeway along South Street that ties into the Manhattan Greenway. Consistent paving, seating, railings, and lighting will be used throughout. *Pavilions and \\"get-downs\\": New, proposed pavilions will help reconnect the city to the river's edge, creating concentrated areas for recreation where appropriate. At Peck Slip and Rutgers Slip, the new esplanade design will mark historic locations by carving steps into the bulkhead line‚Äîcreating means to \\"get down\\" to the water. *Archipelago: In order to provide a continuous greenway between Battery Park and the new East River Waterfront, the path between the Battery Maritime Building and Old Slip will be extended over the existing shoreline, creating a walkway out over the water with a view of the city. *Pier 15: The proposed pier will lift its primary recreation area to a second tier, offering new and intimate views of the tall, historic ships that could be docked in this location. *Pier 35: This large pier will be opened to the public with a second tier, which will function as an amphitheater that faces west-southwest toward Governors Island, Brooklyn, Battery Park and the New York Harbor. It is connected to the greenway by a bridge. *Sustainability: In keeping with the City's PlaNYC initiatives, the East River Waterfront project will seek LEED certification for its pavilions and park uses. Plans aim to reduce energy demand and consumption, conserve natural resources, improve air quality, and catch and reuse rainwater water. The FDR Drive viaduct will be clad, and South Street will be narrowed for much of its length to make room for additional sidewalk space. The glass pavilions will be located underneath the viaduct, and the bike lanes would be moved to the side of the pavilion, underneath the FDR Drive. The piers would be reconstructed to encourage marine growth, by having reef balls to attract fish populations.\\"Transforming the East River Waterfront\\", Sec. 3, pp. 27-37, New York City Department of City Planning\\"Transforming the East River Waterfront\\", Sec. 4, pp. 39-45, New York City Department of City Planning Access to the Esplanade from the neighboring areas would be undertaken with the redevelopment of \\"slips\\" - wedge-shaped road shapes which previously allowed ships to berth. Some of these slips have been used as parking facilities, while others are the southern termini for critical north-south thoroughfares. Reconstructions of the existing slips in the Financial District, the Lower East Side and Chinatown will feature bikeways and landscaped medians. Five of these slip projects are at varying stages of construction. From east to west, they are Montgomery Slip, Rutgers Slip, Pike Slip, Peck Slip, and Burling Slip.\\"Transforming the East River Waterfront\\", Sec. 6, pp. 59, New York City Department of City PlanningDunlap, David W.

Retrieved 2012-07-24. =Renovation phases= The project is being undertaken in three phases, with first phase completed (including Pier 15). Second phase construction started in summer 2011 (from Old Slip to the Battery Maritime Building). Construction on the third phase (Pike Slip to Pier 35, Montgomery Slip) began in fall 2011. This phase will last until 2014 and will cover the rehabilitation underneath the FDR Drive from Maiden Lane to Pier 35. Phase 4 between Catherine and Pike Slips was completed in 2015. U-shaped barrier There are plans for a new storm barrier along the southern third of the greenway, between West 57th and East 42nd Streets. The final proposal, which is geographically U-shaped, will include many features. Under the elevated FDR Drive structure above South Street will be storm barriers hanging from the viaduct's ceiling, which will drop down in case of a storm. A \\"Battery Berm\\" will be located at Battery Park, and a maritime museum will be opened on the site of a former Coast Guard building there. The proposal, by Rebuild by Design, will also include components for storm barriers in Hunts Point, Bronx and on Staten Island. The first component, a barrier on the Lower East Side between Montgomery and East 13th Streets called \\"The Bridging Berm\\", will cost $335 million. In addition to storm protection, the berm‚Äîthe first of three of the barrier's components‚Äîwill also provide a pedestrian pathway and bikeway on top of berm, boating and fishing docks, a slope down to current sports fields, upgraded ADA-accessible ramps for bridges across the FDR Drive, and construction materials such as \\"slurry walls, concrete blocks, a compacted embankment, a clay cap, topsoil and salt-tolerant landscaping.\\" The total cost of the project is over $3.5 billion.

For sister parties in other Arab states, see Arab Socialist Union (disambiguation). The Iraqi Arab Socialist Union (, Al-Itti·∏•ƒÅd Al-I≈°tirƒÅkƒ´ Al- øArabƒ´ Al-Iraqi) was an Iraqi political party based on the principles of Nasserist Arab socialism. It was a sister party to the Arab Socialist Union parties that formed in other Arab countries.  History  In Iraq after the overthrow of the Baathists, between the Ramadan and the revolt of President Abdul Salam Arif, the ASU was the only officially authorized party, but it could not effectively compete with the traditionally influential parties and power groups. The launch of the Arab Socialist Union as the sole legal party in Iraq was announced on July 14, 1964, with a charter akin to that of the Arab Socialist Union in the United Arab Republic. Later the same day the Arab Nationalist Movement and a number of minor political organizations (the Democratic Socialist Unionists, the Arab Socialist Party and the Socialist Union Movement) merged into the Arab Socialist Union. The long term intent of the party was to promote the gradual economic, military and political union of Egypt and Iraq. The party Chair was the former secretary general of the Iraqi Baath Party, Fuad al-Rikabi. The General Secretary and Information Minister was Abdul Karim Farhan. In September 1964 the Egyptian and Iraqi ASU were combined in a joint Executive Committee under Nasser's leadership. As of February 1965 the Iraqi Arab Socialist Union claimed around 70,000 members. After coup attempts by Prime Minister Nasser Arif Abd ar-Razzaq (September 1965, July 1966) and Abdul Karim Farhan (October 1965) and the failure of the Egyptian-Iraqi union plans the Iraqi ASU in October 1966 was put under the government. A group led by al- Rikabi split to form the Arab Socialist Movement (ASM). Arif was overthrown in July 1968 by a Baathist military coup, which immediately dissolved the IASU Preparatory Committee. Ar-Rikabi was imprisonrisoned (where he died in 1971).

It is based on the novella Paranoia in the Launderette by Bruce Robinson, writer and director of Withnail and I. It has been described as a low-budget \\"semicomedy\\" about a children's author-turned-crime-novelist who has become obsessed with murder and murdering. It was released on 8 June 2012 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and received a limited U.S. theatrical release on 7 February 2014. The BBFC classified the film a 15 certificate in the UK, while the MPAA rated the film R in America. Principal photography began on 6 July 2011. Filmed at Shepperton Studios, the film was the first to be backed by Pinewood Studios' initiative to support low-budget British films. It was released by Universal Pictures in the UK and Indomina Releasing in the US. Plot Jack B. Nife is a children's author whose happy marriage has been destroyed by his obsession with his unpublished first book, Harold the Hedgehog. He is working on a series of manuscripts titled Decades of Death, about Victorian era serial killers. He has become obsessed with serial killers and paranoid that people are watching him and trying to kill him, which isn't helped by the fact that a serial killer called the Hanoi Handshake Killer, who cuts off the fingers of his victims, has been active in his neighbourhood. While trying to give money in a sock to carolers, Jack is startled by a phone call from his agent, Clair. She tells him that Harvey Humphries, the head of scripts at the BBC, is interested in Jack's scripts and arranges a meeting between the two in just a few hours. Jack convinces himself that Humphries is a serial killer but plans to attend the meeting anyway. Jack tries to clean his clothes in the oven to be presentable for his meeting with Humphries, only to find that he has super-glued a carving knife to his hand. After trying to remove the knife, he discovers that his clothes are ruined. Jack realises that he has to go to the laundrette. Since he is terrified of the prospect, he calls Professor Friedkin, an old friend, and asks for help. After listening to Jack's traumatic memories of the launderette, Friedkin convinces Jack that he must confront his fears and go there. While at the laundrette, he doesn't understand how the machines work. Frustrating the fellow patrons, he decides to just dry the clothes because he doesn't have time to wash them again. A beautiful young woman then enters, causing Jack further distress, so he rushes to remove his damp clothes from the dryer so he can leave. Forgetting that the carving knife is still glued to his hand, he removes his hand from his pocket and causes the other customers to panic and lock him in the laundrette. The police arrive, break into the laundrette and subdue Jack. The police remove the knife from his hand and treat his wounds. They are about to take him to the police station when a helicopter flies over and announces that there is an emergency and they are needed elsewhere. They hastily throw Jack into the back of the police van and drive off, but he falls out of the vehicle as it begins driving. Perkins, a community support police officer, follows the young woman while Jack returns to the laundrette to get his clean shirt for his meeting. While Jack is changing into his shirt, he notices that a back door that had been locked is now open. He goes through the door and finds a hatch in the floor. As he looks through the hatch, someone hits him from behind. Jack wakes up in the basement of the laundrette tied up next to the young woman. As they begin to panic, Perkins comes down the stairs. They urge him to get help but he reveals that he is the Hanoi Handshake Killer; he cuts the fingers off of his victims and blames the killings on the Vietnamese mafia. Perkins says the laundrette used to belong to his grandmother until the Vietnamese immigrants pushed her out, and he now murders for revenge. He then goes upstairs to sharpen his knife. Jack tells the woman about the traumatic events in his childhood regarding the launderette, and she comforts him and urges him not to give up hope. She says her name is Sangeet and Jack asks her if she will have dinner with him if they survive. Perkins returns carrying a boombox playing the song \\"The Final Countdown\\" by Europe. Perkins and Jack argue about the song's genre, causing Perkins to tell them about his childhood. His mother died when he was very young and his grandmother took him in and gave him a room in the cellar. During this story we see that this was the same launderette that Jack was abandoned in and he was being watched by Perkins from the back room. Jack and Sangeet try to get Perkins to admit that his grandmother did not take proper care of him. Jack argues that Tony is not a good serial killer because he is not original (he supposedly has his grandmother's body in a rocking chair, which references the film Psycho). Sangeet frees herself and injures Perkins as he is about to murder Jack. Sangeet tries to escape but Perkins recovers and drags her back into the cellar. As Perkins is struggling with Sangeet, she frantically suggests that Jack tell a story. Jack convinces Perkins to listen to a story as his final request. Jack tells a story called Brian the Hedgehog; Perkins relates to the story and cries, admitting that he didn't kill the first victim and he had only found the body. The owner of the launderette opens the hatch, prompting Jack and Sangeet to scream for help. Several months later, we see a well- groomed Jack reading his book about Harold and Brian to a group of children. Sangeet and Professor Friedkin are there. Clair finally introduces Jack to Humphries, causing Jack to become briefly fearful. Sangeet reminds Jack that they are going to dinner, and so they leave the event and catch a taxi as the credits roll over the frame.

Biography Fredrik Wedel Jarlsberg was born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. He was the son of Baron Frederik Joachim Wedel Jarlsberg (1819‚Äì1880) and Baroness Juliane Wedel Jarlsberg (1818‚Äì1872). On both his father and mother side, he was a member of a branch of Norway's foremost nobility. He maintained the title of baron in Denmark, which had not abolished nobility titles following the separation of Denmark-Norway. Earlier in Norway, his family was officially recognised as barons. He studied law at the University of Christiania and graduated Cand.jur. in 1879. He first became a professor and then entered diplomacy service. He was Norwegian-Swedish Minister in Madrid 1891-97 and 1902-05. In 1882 Wedel became secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Stockholm. He came to Vienna in 1885 and in 1888 to London as Charg√© d'affaires. He became a Swedish-Norwegian minister in the Spanish court in 1891. He was active in Norwegian-Swedish diplomacy and played a central role in the 1905 dissolution of the union between these countries. He was offered the post as minister of foreign affairs three times. He played a key role in the Svalbard Treaty of 1920, which granted Norway sovereignty over Svalbard. From 1898-1908, he established residence at Palsg√•rd on the east coast of the Jutland. In his time as owner, a large park was built between 1898-1900 by the English landscape architect Edward Milner (1819-1884). In 1908 he sold Palsg√•rd and in 1909 he bought Skaugum in Asker. The estate had a large main building, which Wedel redesigned in French architectural style. He donated it to Crown Prince Olav at the time of his wedding to Princess M√§rtha of Sweden in 1929. Personal life Wedel Jarlsberg was married twice. In 1883 he was married with Alice Thekla Louise von Wagner (1861‚Äì1913) from one of Germany's industrial families. After her death, he was married in 1916 with an American heiress, Mary von Andr√©, n√©e Palmer (1859‚Äì1941). He was the author of Reisen gjennem Livet (1932) and 1905 og Kongevalget (1946). He became a knight of the Order of St. Olav in 1892 and also held a number of foreign orders. Wedel Jarlsberg Land on the southwestern part of Spitsbergen in Svalbard is named after him. Wedel Jarlsberg vacated his Paris residence in Paris in 1940 when the German Military invaded France. He and his wife relocated to Lisbon, Portugal where he died during 1942.

Early life A native of Hot Springs, Arkansas, Moss attended horse races at Oaklawn Park Race Track during his youth, often sneaking into the track despite being underage. During high school and college he assisted Daily Racing Form columnist Don Grisham on an Oaklawn handicapping column in the Arkansas Gazette. Moss then spent one semester in pharmacy school at the University of Arkansas before Gazette sports editor Orville Henry hired him to work for the paper full time. Print In 1984, Moss left the Gazette for the Arkansas Democrat after the Democrat offered to double his salary due to his popularity as a handicapper. From 1989 to 1995 he worked for The Dallas Morning News. Moss left journalism in 1995 and returned home to work as the director of operations for Oaklawn. In 1996, Moss returned to sports writing as a reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. He left the Star-Telegram in 1999 after he subbed as an ESPN analyst for that year's Preakness Stakes coverage and subsequently was offered a full-time job by the network. For thirty years, Moss has been part of Andrew Beyer's team that calculates for Daily Racing Form the iconic Beyer Speed Figures, a mathematical index measuring racehorse speed that is widely considered the most popular handicapping tool in thoroughbred racing. He also created the \\"Moss Pace Figures\\" published online by Daily Racing Form. Television In June 1999, Moss became ESPN's primary horse racing analyst. In August 2008, he joined the NFL Network, where for three years he was studio host for \\"Team Cam\\" and \\"Around the League\\" and now is primarily a remote reporter. In 2011, Moss began as an analyst for the Triple Crown for NBC and NBC Sports Network and now covers horse racing exclusively for those networks. In addition to his horse racing analyst duties, Moss has handled reporter, host or play-by-play duties for a wide variety of other sports broadcasts on the NBC family of networks including college football, college basketball, golf, show jumping, two Super Bowls and three Olympic games (2012, 2014 and 2016).

Published by the William Morrow and Company in March/April 1998, the 272-page English-language novel's title was the translation of the Tagalog-language phrase \\"Tago nang tago\\". Abbreviated as \\"TNT\\", the phrase is a moniker for \\"an illegal alien in the United States\\" who always has to hide and be cautious in his/her movements so as not to be found and caught by immigration authorities. Plot The main protagonist in Romero's novel is Violetta Rosario \\"Viola\\" Dananay. Viola narrates her life in the Philippines and her eventual move to the United States. Viola was conceived before the marriage of her parents who belong to Manila's socialite class. Viola grew up in Manila during the regime of former Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos. Her life was complicated by her quarrelsome parents. One of the main reasons for the disagreements between Viola's parents was her father's reputation as a womanizer and philanderer. Viola's father left the family to live with a pregnant mistress. Viola's mother, Ludy, left for the United States to escape the indiscretions of her husband, leaving Viola behind. Upon arrival in America, Viola's mother became an undocumented immigrant working as a maid in New York City. After the fall of the Marcoses, Viola's father was implicated in charges of corruption committed by the Marcos government. Viola's father decided to send Viola, already a teenager, to the United States to live with her mother. Viola obeyed her father but with a \\"secret agenda\\": to return to the Philippines together with her mother. Analysis According to Publishers Weekly the female character and narrator Viola felt inferior and ‚Äúmorally rudderless‚Äù, without direction because of her physical features, comparing herself from the Caucasian features of the Europeans. She was a teenage protagonist that ‚Äúnever seems to grow up‚Äù or mature, self-centered, and a person who suffered from ‚Äúshallow self-dramatizations‚Äù. Booklist described Viola as a young woman focused on her own feelings of recklessness and abandonment, and \\"couched\\" or stuck in using \\"stolen\\" American phrases but with a firm grip of Filipino values. Although ‚Äúsmoothly but predictably written‚Äù and ‚Äúwith blatant symbolism‚Äù, the author of Always Hiding was not able to ‚Äúfully exploit her plot‚Äôs full potential resonance‚Äù. One particular example was that Romero was able to present the evident parallels between the political and personal circumstances that ruined Viola's family, as well as the situations that divided the Philippines, but Romero was not able to utilize such conditions in order to make the story line reverberate further. Thus, Romero (a Filipino American) was not able to reveal enough of the Filipino-American experience or the contributions of the Filipino immigrant to the history of the United States. Romero was also not able to provide Viola, the character, with the ‚Äúdignity‚Äù of an ‚Äúunsympathetic heroine‚Äù. Despite this literary criticism, the Library Journal described Always Hiding as a novel \\"about family, love, honor, and modern Filipino life‚Äù in the Philippines and in the United States. According to Booklist, there were abrupt changes in the direction of the plot and the dialogue between the characters reflects the \\"tumultuous feelings\\" of the young heroine, but the author was able to maintain her emotional closeness to the reader. The novel brings ‚Äúsparkling humor and fresh perspective‚Äù and a portrayal of ‚Äúdangerous situations‚Äù that reveals the strength and potency of the characters, not their fear and apprehension.

As noted in the registration form supporting the inclusion of the two church buildings as contributing structures in the historic district, the two extant church buildings \\"are typical of those along the Central Avenue corridor in that they have been occupied by several congregations, reflecting the changing demographics of the neighborhood.\\" Crouch Memorial Church Church at 1001 E. 27th St. The 27th Street Historic District includes the Crouch Memorial Church of God and Christ, a Romanesque Revival style church located at the northeast corner of E. 27th Street and Paloma Avenue. It was built from 1895 to 1896 for the Haven Methodist Episcopal Church.(reporting that a building permit was issued the previous day for Haven Methodist Episcopal Church to build a church building on 27th and Paloma Streets \\"to cost $1,000\\")(\\"The Haven Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles has filed articles of incorporation, with the object of establishing a church on the corner of 27th and Paloma Streets ...\\") In the early 1900s, the church was a center of the city's prohibition movement. In October 1902, the church hosted a speech by a member of the Anti-Saloon League. In July and November 1902, the church was the site of all-day meetings of the city's federation of Women's Christian Temperance Unions. One of the members gave a talk on the effect of the corset on the body, asserting that \\"good men will not select the girl with a wasp-like waist for a wife and as a mother to his children.\\" The Haven Methodist congregation celebrated 20 years on the site in September 1915 with anniversary and homecoming services. In the early 1920s, as the demographics of the neighborhood changed, the Haven Methodist congregation moved to a new location on South Normandie, and the church building at 21st and Paloma was sold to the Beth Eden Baptist Temple, an African-American congregation. In August 1925, the 34th annual convention of the Western Baptist Association drew several hundred delegates from 48 \\"colored Baptist churches\\" in Southern California to Beth Eden. In July 1927, the relocated Haven Methodist congregation became the first church in Los Angeles to file a bankruptcy petition. The Los Angeles Times reported that the congregation had been divided by ultra-modernism and \\"circus ballyhoo\\" methods. Nueva Iglesia Bautista en Cristo Since 1906, the Gothic Revival church at 1001 E. 28th Street has served white, Armenian, African-American, and Hispanic congregations. The second contributing church building in the district is now known as the Nueva Iglesia Bautista en Cristo, a Gothic Revival structure located at the northeast corner of East 28th Street and Paloma Avenue. The structure was built in 1906 for the Salem Congregational Church, a congregation serving the white population that initially settled in the neighborhood. The church as dedicated in May 1906 with seating for 1,000 persons and, according to the Los Angeles Times, \\"everything being modern and up-to-date.\\" In 1911, the Salem Congregational Church successfully lobbied for an ordinance permitting the display of \\"moving pictures\\" in churches after the pastor, Rev. B. H. Reutepohler, hit upon a play to illustrate his Sunday evening sermons with motion pictures. After the ordinance passed, Salem Congregational became the first church in Los Angeles to take advantage of the new law. The church building was purchased in January 1917 by a group of Armenian Congregationalists and was renamed the Armenian Gethsemane Congregational Church. From 1917 to 1944, the church served the influx of Armenian immigrants in the area. In October 1942, the church hosted the 56th Annual Convention of the Los Angeles Association of Congregational Churches. In 1944, the church building was sold to an African-American congregation and was renamed the E. 28th Street Christian Church. Since 2003, the church building is operated as a Spanish-language church, the Nueva Iglesia Bautista en Cristo, serving the neighborhood's Hispanic population.(\\"The mission of the Convention Baptist Church is to unite Hispanic Baptist churches in fellowship, cooperation and service to more effectively reach the southwestern United States to the Kingdom of God.\\") 28th Street YMCA The 28th Street YMCA, listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places, also lies within the borders of the 27th Street Historic District. The YMCA building, sometimes referred to in its early years as the \\"Colored YMCA\\", was built in 1926 based on a design by the African American architect Paul R. Williams. The YMCA provided a swimming pool for use by the African American community in an era when the city's public swimming pools were racially segregated. Historic significance The 27th Street Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009 pursuant to the registration requirements for residential districts set forth in a multiple property submission study, the African Americans in Los Angeles MPS. The neighborhood was originally occupied exclusively by white residents. Its period of historical significance begins in 1923, when an African-American congregation acquired the church at the corner of East 27th Street and Paloma Avenue, and as African-Americans began to move into the neighborhood and build important cultural and business institutions along the nearby Central Avenue Corridor. The district represents \\"one of the few neighborhoods along the Central Avenue corridor to retain sufficient integrity for listing in the National Register.\\" The Central Avenue Corridor became the cultural and business hub of the African-American community in Los Angeles from the 1920s to the 1950s. Other buildings along this corridor which were listed pursuant to the African Americans in Los Angeles MPS include the Lincoln Theater (located a short walk from the district on Central Avenue), Second Baptist Church (located four blocks north of the district along Griffith Avenue), Prince Hall Masonic Temple, 52nd Place Historic District, and two historic all-black segregated fire stations (Fire Station No. 14 and Fire Station No. 30).

It is played by one participant throwing a ball, and others catching it for points. Rules The players include a thrower and many catchers. The thrower will decide if points will be awarded if the ball is caught directly ('alive'), if the ball must be picked up after it hits the ground ('dead'), or either. The thrower also has the responsibility to determine the number of points that should be distributed. For example, a thrower calls out, \\"100, dead!\\" and throws the ball straight up in the air. All the catchers must wait until the ball touches the ground before they pick it up in order to receive the 100 points at stake. If a catcher's score goes over 500, that person will revert to 0 and will become the thrower, and the thrower will in turn become a catcher. Variations The game can be played using a frisbee instead of the ball. Mystery Ball is a variation based on the same premise, but along with calling out a number of points, the thrower has the ability to instead call out \\"mystery ball.\\" Once a player has the ball, the thrower says what the mystery ball was worth, being an unknown (to everyone but the thrower) number of points. Negative Points: To make the mystery ball more risky, the unknown number of points could also be a negative number, taking away from the total score of the player who got the ball. One must trust the thrower that they did not change this preset number of points after seeing who ended up with the ball, or having the thrower look away so that there is no way to see who has the ball, so that they cannot favor any player. Kick Ball 300 is a variation where the ball is kicked as well as being thrown and caught. It was designed as a training exercise to promote cooperation in competitive games.

Was the first female white settler of Monmouth County, New Jersey. According to History of the Baptists Benedict (cited in Stout and Allied Families by H.F. StoutStout, Herald F.) she lived to the age of 110.

Here the old Native Chief warns Penelope to escape a planned attack. Her story In 1643 Stillwell estimates 1643/44; controversial Penelope and her husband took a ship from the Netherlands to New Amsterdam. With their ship foundering, she and her husband, John Kent, and several others made land at Sandy Hook. Her husband was not able to travel due to illness and she remained with him. After the couple were abandoned on shore by the other passengers looking for safety and shelter, she and her husband were attacked by natives and her husband was killed. She was gravely injured and left for dead. She took shelter in a hollow tree until she made herself known to the Navesink tribe of Leni Lenapi. They bound up her wounds, and when she was well enough to travel she was released to the Dutch at New Amsterdam (now New York City). There in 1644 at the age of 22, she married Richard Stout (1615 - 1705), son of John Stout (1584 - 1620) and Elizabeth Bee (1591 - 1685) of Nottinghamshire, England. They had a large family (7 sons and 4 daughters) mostly born at Gravesend in the current area of Coney Island, Brooklyn. They moved to Middletown Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey around 1665. This was where the Leni Lenapi who had earlier helped her were from, and they were still living there when the Stouts arrived. It is said that Benedict Penelope had 502 direct descendants when she died at the age of 110. The surnames for Penelope are quite variable in several references; Van Princis, Princis, Prince, Princes, Princess, Van Prinzen, Prinzen, Kent. The Gravesend Town RecordsGravesend Town Records as written by Englishmen at the time of a trial in September 1648 name the defendant as 'Penelope Prince'. However, this does not necessarily mean that she had not yet married Richard Stout, as married Dutch women in that time period traditionally kept and used their maiden names. In honor of her being a pioneer in Middletown, NJ, 'Penelope Lane' off of Kings Highway is named after her.  Children  John Stout (1645 - 1724) m.

It is now the site of the headquarters of Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, west-southwest of Cadiz. Golden Pond was established in the 19th century and became known for its moonshining activity during the Prohibition era. This town was in an area altered during the 1930s and later by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which constructed dams to control flooding and generate electricity for a large rural area. The TVS evicted the last residents of Golden Pond in 1969, when the recreation area was established. Origin Golden Pond shares its name with a pond located at , west of the town. The most accepted account of the name's origin says that residents named the pond when sunshine on its surface resembled melted gold. Another story, likely to be legend, says that residents named the community for a man who placed gold dust in the vicinity of the pond in an attempt to trigger a gold rush and boom in property values. Another account said that the town was purportedly named Fungo for the entertainment at the local saloon. This name may have referred to a community further west, which later merged with Golden Pond, and may never have been used at all. Geography Golden Pond is located at , in western Kentucky near the Tennessee border. It is situated in what is now the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, on a peninsula lying between Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley. These were manmade, formed by dams on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, respectively; the town lies west of the latter lake. The two lakes isolate the peninsula from the rest of Kentucky, as the region can be accessed only via roads from Tennessee or by crossing the lakes. U.S. Route 68 and Kentucky Route 80 pass through the community concurrently, providing access to Marshall County to the west and the remainder of Trigg County to the east. When active, Golden Pond ran for almost along this highway. Another road, known as The Trace, runs west of Golden Pond and connects the peninsula to Livingston County, Kentucky to the north and Stewart County, Tennessee to the south. Golden Pond is west-southwest of Cadiz, the county seat of Trigg County. The area is served by the Cadiz post office; the name Golden Pond is still accepted by the U.S. Postal Service and is used in the recreation area's mailing address. History The name Golden Pond was first applied to an area United States post office on December 28, 1848. The site of the post office is unknown, although it may have been near the pond of the same name. Early post offices were often operated out of stores or private homes. The town at the recognized location was established by European Americans in 1882. The early town's economy was based on the area's natural resources, which included timber, iron ore, and fertile soil for agriculture. In 1898, a fire destroyed Golden Pond, which was subsequently rebuilt. In 1936 the town suffered a second major fire but it again rebuilt. During the Prohibition era, Golden Pond was known nationally for distilling moonshine whiskey, which was later sold in speakeasies in Midwestern cities such as Chicago, Detroit, and St. Louis. In 1964, the Tennessee Valley Authority opened the first office for the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area at Golden Pond. The federal government either purchased or forcibly purchased through eminent domain all lands within the recreation area. The homes of some residents who resisted purchase were burned before completion of legal condemnation.Nickell, David (May‚ÄìAugust 2007). \\"Between the Rivers: A Socio-historical Account of Hegemony and Heritage\\".

Early life and influences Perlotti was born into a family of Italian immigrant workers. His father, a shoe cobbler, died in 1899, and young Luis Perlotti was compelled to find work. He was employed at the Rigolleau glass factory, and later at a cabinet maker, where he developed skills in polishing and shaping. He began his studies as a craftsman and sculptor at the Unione e Benevolenza mutual aid society, and was later accepted into the National Academy of Fine Arts, where he was trained by painters P√≠o Collivadino, Pablo Ripamonti, and by sculptor Lucio Correa Morales. He soon received commissions to create busts and memorials for the National Military College, and in 1914, exhibited for the first time at the National Salon. He became acquainted with other Argentine artists, including painter Benito Quinquela Mart√≠n, poet Alfonsina Storni, and others, who would gather at the Caf√© Tortoni. The archaeological findings of Eduardo Holmberg and Juan Bautista Ambrosetti, as well as the regionalist fiction of Ricardo Rojas, would influence Perlotti to incorporate indigenous motifs in which developing style, and a tour of the Andes in 1925 would further influence his work in subsequent years. Works He would be commissioned to create large-scale works for both public display and for private clients, notably the Mar del Plata monument to his friend, the poet Alfonsina Storni, which would be placed in 1942 opposite the place where she had committed suicide; Perlotti engraved her 1925 poem, Pain, upon the memorial. Other notable works would include the Monument to Bartolom√© Mitre, in the city of Corrientes; the monument to Los Libres del Sur, in the city of Chascom√∫s; Return to the Fatherland, in Tunuy√°n, Mendoza; The Dance of the Arrow, in Paran√°, Entre R√≠os (which had earned a gold medal in the Ibero- American Exposition of 1929, in Seville); the monument to the Andes, Los Andes Park, in the Chacarita ward of Buenos Aires; La Piedad, in Chacarita Cemetery; memorials to Generals Juan Lavalle and Pablo Riccheri, and boxer Luis Firpo, in La Recoleta Cemetery; a monument to motherhood, in Rivadavia Square; relief in homage to Lady Liberty on the base of the Plaza Arenales flag pole; a monument to Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, located in the Supreme Court; and the Mart√≠n Fierro Award, among numerous other works. Museum Perlotti donated his house and workshop in the Caballito ward of Buenos Aires in 1969 for its use as a museum. Vacationing in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in January 1969, the noted sculptor died in an automobile accident. The Luis Perlotti Museum became the municipal museum of sculpture of Buenos Aires, and was reopened in 2008 following a four-year refurbishment and expansion.

It was named for author Mark Twain whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens. Clemens lived in Hannibal from 1839 to 1853, age 4 to 17. It is the oldest operating show cave in the state, giving tours continuously since 1886. Along with nearby Cameron Cave, it became a registered National Natural Landmark in 1972, with a citation reading \\"Exceptionally good examples of the maze type of cavern development.\\" The cave ‚Äî as \\"McDougal's Cave\\" ‚Äî plays an important role in the novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) by Mark Twain and was renamed in honor of the author in 1880. Early history = Geology = Geologically Mark Twain Cave and its nearby neighbor Cameron Cave differ from most of the 6,500+ caves found in Missouri. Both are believed to be remnants of a much larger cave system cut apart by a glacier and millions of years of erosion, leading to speculation by geologists and common citizens alike that there may be further undiscovered caves in the Hannibal region. This speculation was heightened in 2006 when the entrance to a previously unknown cave was found during construction of a new elementary school.\\"Cave found at school site\\".Publisher: Hannibal Courier- Post. April 22, 2006. A major difference is that Mark Twain Cave has a near total lack of speleothems, mineral deposits like stalagmites and stalactites in large open areas. Mark Twain Cave and Cameron Cave instead have a multitude of narrow, winding passages. The caves are made mostly of a soft limestone called Louisiana Lithographic Limestone that is found only in a area around Hannibal and Louisiana, Missouri. The limestone has been estimated by geologists to be about 350 million years old, while the cave passages were formed some 100 million years ago. Mark Twain Cave covers some with four entrances and 260 passages and has a year around temperature of . alt= = Discovery and first uses = While it is possible that prehistoric Native Americans were aware of the cave, the earliest documentation claims that Mark Twain Cave was discovered in the winter of 1819-1820 by a local hunter, Jack Simms, when his dog chased an animal into a small hillside opening south of current-day Hannibal. Upon investigation with torches, he and his brothers found that the small opening led to a large underground labyrinth. The cave proved a popular diversion for mid-19th century Hannibal residents, especially children, including the young Sam Clemens. These childhood explorations would later reappear in five of Mark Twain's books. The proximity to the Mississippi River and its cooling breezes made the small valley between the river bluffs containing the caves a popular site for family picnics and church outings in the summertime. = The mad scientist and the outlaw = Hannibal physician Joseph Nash McDowell purchased the cave in the late 1840s and used it for several years as a laboratory for experiments on human corpses. His most notable experiment involved an attempt to petrify the remains of his deceased daughter. Twain's book Life on the Mississippi offered a description of the activities: > In my time the person who owned it [the cave] turned it into a mausoleum for > his daughter, age fourteen. The body of this poor child was put in a copper > cylinder filled with alcohol, and this suspended in one of the dismal > avenues of the cave. After two years, the experiment proved a failure and the girl's body was forcibly removed by angry Hannibal citizens who learned about it from children who had discovered it while exploring the cave and who sometimes used the body to enhance the spooky atmosphere during the telling of ghost stories.Missouri Caves in History and Legend by H. Dwight Weaver. Page 15. Published 2008. University of Missouri Press Many townsfolk also believed that Dr. McDowell used bodies stolen from area graves for other experiments, a not uncommon practice prior to the 20th century. Twain would weave that suspicion into the plot of Tom Sawyer in a grave robbing scene involving Injun Joe. alt= According to folklore, McDowell also used it as a secret Confederate weapons storage cache during the American Civil War. McDowell was an ardent southern supporter and was proven to have stockpiled guns and ammunition for the rebels in his St. Louis medical college. One of the former Confederates who likely had knowledge of the cave from his war service is the legendary outlaw Jesse James. James had ridden with Quantrill's Raiders and Bloody Bill Anderson throughout the Little Dixie area southwest of Hannibal. In September 1879, following the robbery of a train in nearby Saverton, Missouri, the cave proved a ready and secure hideout for few days rest. James even signed and dated one of the caves walls using a pencil. That section of the cave used to be open to tours but has since been excluded from the tour because the pencil marks have faded. Advent of tourism Tom Sawyer, an explorer of MacDougal's Cave The cave was little known outside of the immediate Hannibal region until 1876, when Twain's landmark novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer was published. Soon tourists worldwide were making the journey to see the real-life cave that provided the basis for the novel's fictional \\"MacDougal's Cave\\", where Tom and Becky Thatcher's lives were endangered by Injun Joe. The first regular tours by paying customers began in 1886 when local farmer John East charged tourists a dime to see some of the places inside the cave made famous by the novel. At that time the original opening was still being used, but proved impractical for large crowds, so in 1890 a new entry to the cave was created nearby. For over fifty years tourists saw the cave much as Twain had in his youth, by candlelight or lantern. That changed in 1939 when electric lights were added to the tour areas of the cave by the Cameron family. The cave had been purchased in 1923 by Judge E.T. Cameron, who had been a guide at the cave as a young man. Through a succession of owners in the late 1800s and early 1900s, Cameron had served as manager of the cave property. He was the first to establish standardized tour routes within the cave, construct a small building near the entrance for ticket sales, and advertise the cave in newspapers as \\"Mark Twain Cave\\".Missouri Caves in History and Legend by H. Dwight Weaver. Page 97-98. Published 2008. University of Missouri Press = Discovery of Cameron Cave = One cold winter day in 1925, Judge Cameron's son Arch was caring for the family's cattle herd when he noticed steam rising from a sinkhole in the ground across the valley from Mark Twain Cave. After some digging, he discovered a large natural underground room. Further exploration found a cave even larger than Mark Twain Cave, with more twisted pathways. This \\"sister\\" cave was named for the Cameron family. Tours of Cameron Cave are offered, but are of a more primitive nature. The cave has no electric lights, and the only modifications made have been those mandated by law for safety. =Current status= The entire cave complex is privately owned by the Coleberd family, descendants of Judge Cameron. It includes Mark Twain and Cameron caves, a campground, a gift shop/visitors center, a candle shop, and a winery. Other available activities include The Life and Times of Mark Twain, a one-man stage performance that covers various highlights and the humor of the author's life from a first-person perspective. One of the newest additions to the cave complex is Sticks & Stones, an interactive gem shop where children and adults can sluice for semi-precious stones, much like Twain did in his brief gold panning career. One of the most notable visitors was U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who toured Mark Twain Cave with his family in 1979. The guided tour of Mark Twain Cave takes approximately 55 minutes, while the larger Cameron Cave tour averages one hour twenty minutes in length. Mark Twain Cave is open year-around except Thanksgiving and Christmas days. Cameron Cave is open from Memorial Day through Labor Day only. =Discovery of Clemens signature= For decades, cave owners, scholars, and visitors searched for the signature of Sam Clemens inside the cave among the 250,000 signatures visitors had written on the walls in candle smoke, pencil, paint, and even berry juice. On July 26, 2019, Cindy Lovell, former director of both the Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum in Hannibal and Mark Twain House in Hartford, Connecticut, discovered \\"Clemens\\" written on the cave wall during a special tour for Twain scholars. She and owner Linda Coleberd had been searching for the signature for decades. Twain scholars Alan Gribben and Kevin Mac Donnell authenticated the signature.

After he performed before Queen Victoria in 1844 at Windsor Castle, Wallett began promoting himself as \\"the Queen's Jester,\\" and described himself this way in the title of his 1870 autobiography.Wallett, front cover For many years, he performed in the circus owned by his good friend Pablo Fanque (whose name is familiar to many today from his mention in The Beatles song, Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!) Wallett also helped manage Fanque's circus. In his 1870 autobiography, Wallett shares many anecdotes that reflect the powers of observation, humor, and pathos of an effective clown. While often a rolling stone, Wallett frequently found himself working with Pablo Fanque, and thus, many of his most noteworthy stories either concern Fanque or his time performing in Fanque's circus. Wallett speaks of a routine he devised for a show in Oxford concerning freehold land rights: > I remained in Oxford till Pablo's benefit came on, when I appeared for that > night only, and delivered a mock electioneering speech. In it I proposed to > solve the vexed question of freemen's right to vote for the county as well > as for the city. I had primed myself with facts and figures, had compared > the number of freemen with the number of acres of freehold land belonging to > the corporation, and consequently their property, and was able to show that > there was land enough, in fact more than twice enough, to constitute each > freeman a forty-shilling ‚Ä¢ freeholder. This I intended for a joke, but it > turned out something better‚Äîit was good law. Some ten or fifteen years > afterwards, when the question came before a high tribunal, the judge came to > the same decision that I had delivered in jest.Wallett, p. 73 He claims to have observed the following while fishing with Fanque on The Isis, the stretch of The Thames that runs through Oxford: > For a few days I amused myself with Pablo Fanque fishing in the Isis. Pablo > was a very expert angler, and would usually catch as many fish as five or > six of us within sight of him put together. This suggested a curious device. > You must know that Pablo is a coloured man. One of the Oxonians, with more > love for angling than skill, thought there must be something captivating in > the complexion of Pablo. He resolved to try. One morning, going down to the > river an hour or two earlier than usual, we were astonished to find the > experimental philosophic angler with his face blacked after the most > approved style of the Christy Minstrels.Wallett, p. 73 Then, he describes how he responded to the most unusual event that occurred during his performance with Pablo Fanque's circus in Wakefield: > After leaving Oxford, I went to Wakefield, Yorkshire, to join Pablo Fan que, > who had erected a fine circus in Wood Street. Here I passed through one of > the most severe trials of my professional life. A christening party, > consisting of a young father and mother, with their little babe, and its old > grandmother, were finishing the day at the circus. During the time I was in > the ring, the old lady appeared to be in an ecstacy of enjoyment‚Äîso much so, > that her hearty laughter attracted the attention of the whole audience and > myself. But her laughter suddenly ceased, and her head fell back. I felt > convinced that something serious had happened. So I stepped into the pit, > took the old lady in my arms, and carried her into the lobby. I sat down on > the steps, with the old lady on my knee, when she lifted her head, gave a > gentle sigh, her head fell back on my shoulder, and her dear spirit had > fled. I carried her body across to the Woodman Hotel, kept by Mr. Briggs, > where a coroner's inquest was afterwards held. When I returned to the > circus, I found they had not proceeded with the entertainment, but had > stopped where I left them. Oh, what a difficult task it was to speak to the > audience on the awful event that had occurred! To treat the subject with due > solemnity, and yet to show the folly of grieving overmuch for what is > inevitable. As each one could say: \\"I know that somewhere in the dark, The > Shadow sits and waits for me.\\"Wallett, p. 74 Wallett was on-hand for another tragedy that befell Pablo Fanque's Circus in Leeds in March 1848. This occurred during a benefit for Wallett. He describes it in his autobiography: > I next visited Leeds with Pablo Fanque. I had become a popular favourite, > and crowded houses nightly were the result of the announcement of my name. > So much so, that on my benefit night at the circus in King Charles'croft, > when the house was crowded to excess, there were thousands outside, unable > to gain admission.

She was found in an unhealthy condition, severely underweight and malnourished. She lived several months at the Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands. After it became clear that the basin at Dolfinarium was too small, multiple options were considered, including releasing Morgan and transferring her to another facility. Over a year later, after litigation and debate between scientists, a Dutch court ruled that she was to be moved. Morgan was transported to the Loro Parque in Spain in November 2011. History The orca, now named Morgan, was administered medical assistance and provided with food. The reason for the orca's rescue was emaciation (weighing approximately ) and likely also dehydration. Her body length was . Public controversy Controversy surrounds Morgan, as she was rescued with the provision that she was not to be displayed to the public and that she would be released back into the wild when she had recovered. However, the Harderwijk Dolfinarium and the Free Morgan Foundation, composed of independent international experts, have come to loggerheads over Morgan's future. The Free Morgan Foundation includes the orca research and education organisations of Orcalab, Orca Network, Orca Research Trust, Centre for Whale Research, and Project SeaWolf Coastal Protection. It also includes the conservation and animal welfare groups the Cetacean Society International, Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society and the International Marine Mammal Project of Earth Island, as well as their affiliated scientists and experts. Currently, the Harderwijk Dolfinarium has advised that they wish to ship Morgan to another captive marine mammal facility after an independent team of experts concluded that she is not a suitable candidate for release into the wild. Yet the Free Morgan Foundation presented a detailed rehabilitation and release plan which to date (June 2011) has not openly been considered by those who hold her. The Free Morgan Foundation rehabilitation and release plan included a number of phases with contingency plans. The plan incorporated a ‚Äòsoft-release‚Äô where Morgan would first be moved to a sea-pen and care for her would continue. The process would, should her health allow, also involve taking Morgan out into the open sea to increase her fitness and reacquaint her with the area. During that time she would be provided with food whilst she continued to readapt to the wild (somewhat like a half-way house for people who are in the process of reintegrating into society). An attempt to release a captive orca back into the wild has only been conducted once ‚Äì resulting in a partial success for Keiko, the star in the movie Free Willy. The Canadian and United States governments have also successfully released and reintegrated a rescued orca named A73, or Springer, a situation which bore certain similarities to that of Morgan. Springer, like Morgan, was found alone, many miles from where her family pod is resident and in an emaciated condition. After being kept in a sea pen in Puget Sound and nursed back to health, Springer was then transferred to a sea pen off of northern Vancouver Island from where she was ultimately released. She successfully reintegrated with a resident British Columbia orca pod and is still with that pod today. Morgan's case, however, has some key differences to that of Springer. The Northern Resident population of orcas which Springer is a part of have been intensively studied for many decades, with all individuals and the majority of family relations known to researchers. Although Morgan has been reliably established to be a member of the Norwegian fish eating population from call analyses, it has proved impossible to establish her family group. This has tremendous complications for release with animals as family focused as orcas. Despite some similarities, Morgan's situation is different from that of Luna, a young male orca who became isolated in the Nootka Sound area of Vancouver Island, Canada. In that instance, Luna was never taken into captivity of any form and no official attempts were made to rehabilitate him back into the orca society he came from. Luna died when he was presumed to be run over by a tugboat. Luna's case does show, however, that a young stranded orca is capable of surviving and hunting on its own, an argument that the Dolphinarium attempted to ignore. Despite the original agreement that she would not be shown to the public, Morgan was displayed by the Dolphinarium only two months after she was taken into captivity. The dolphinarium made no attempt to pursue any rehabilitiation and release plan despite the arguments of the Free Morgan Foundation that Morgan was an excellent candidate for a rehabilitation attempt similar to the successful rehabilitation of Springer. Support for Morgan's release has also come from another group called The Orca Coalition (comprising seven organisations), which has employed a lawyer through funding raised by donations. The Orca Coalition is now intending to confront the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation to prevent Morgan from being transferred to another marine mammal captive facility and instead for her to be moved to the proposed site of the sea-pen (Deltapark Neeltje Jans in The Netherlands), where she can begin her rehabilitation. Great emphasis is placed on finding the family or home range of rehabilitated animals of all species which are returned to the wild. The advantage for the animals is wide-ranging and can have many spin-offs to assist them in their return. This includes the social support and local knowledge (such as places to find food). Orca are well known for their strong social networks, with some populations having such strong bonds that individuals only join a group by being born into it and only leave by dying, whilst others have more of a fluid society with long-term and semi-long term bonds formed. Morgan has been identified as belonging to the Norwegian fish-eating orca community (based on DNA analysis and supporting evidence from acoustical matching). The social structure of the Norwegian orca has been studied to some degree,Bisther, A., & Vongraven, D. (1995). Studies of the social ecology of Norwegian killer whales (Orcinus orca). Developments in Marine Biology, 4, 169-176.Ugarte, F. (2001). Behaviour and social organisation of killer whales in Northern Norway. Masters, University of Troms√∏, Troms√∏, Norway. and both studies suggest that the \\"groups seem to be social units based at least partly on stable membership\\". One study also noted that there was communal care of young which may bode well for Morgan if she is given the opportunity to re-integrate into the population. Individual Norwegian orca are known to travel some distance from the site of their original identification.Lyrholm, T. (1988). Photoidentification of individual killer whales, Orcinus orca, off the coast of Norway, 1983-1986. Rit Fiskideildar, 11(North Atlantic killer whales), 89-94.Simil√§, T., Holst, J. C., & Christensen, I. (1996). Occurrence and diet of killer whales in northern Norway: seasonal patterns relative to the distribution and abundance of Norwegian spring-spawning herring. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 53, 769-779. One orca was photographed from its previous sighting a year earlier, not to mention that Morgan herself has travelled from Norway to the Wadden Sea, a distance (depending on exact locations) of approximately . Additionally, there have been sightings of orca in the North Sea since Morgan's capture. There are many issues surrounding keeping orcas in captivity, including a reduced lifespan compared to orca in the wild. Morgan has been in captivity since June 2011. Her exact age is unknown, but when she was captured, she was estimated to be between one and four years old based on her size. The reason for her ill- health and separation from her family remains unknown. Morgan's young age offers both advantages and disadvantages to the arguments for her release. Being young she is likely to still have a flexible attitude and therefore an ability to adapt to a return to the wild. Against her release is, as previously mentioned, the lack of a positive identification of her family group and even that she may be too young to know the complete home range of her family, making it harder for her to find them. This last issue could possibly be solved with a ‚Äòsoft-release‚Äô program which would allow Morgan to slowly build up her stamina as well as her knowledge of the area, albeit with the option to always return for food. A critical flaw in the release plan, however, has always been a lack of funding. Despite extensive effort by both the Orca Coalition and the Free Morgan Foundation to raise awareness and interest in their cause, funds raised did not even cover their legal fees. This led to a lesser case in court than their otherwise considerable presence in the case would have warranted. If moved to another marine mammal captive facility, Morgan is likely to eventually be used in the captive breeding programs which many aquariums now advocate. She would provide much-needed ‚Äònew blood‚Äô to prevent a population (or genetic) bottleneck in the captive orca population, as she presumably comes from an orca population not related to those orca currently in captivity. On Wednesday, October 12, 2011, Agricultural Secretary Henk Bleker announced that Morgan would be transferred to a Spanish marine park known as Loro Parque. Animal activists involved within the Free Morgan Foundation continued their effort to stop the transfer of Morgan to the park, but Morgan was transferred on November 29, 2011. She joins a pod of second generation captive born orcas born in the Sea World Parks in the USA, and a third generation calf born in 2010. On January 3, 2014, one of the activists against Morgans captivity, Geoffrey Deckers, said that an orca like Morgan has a value of $7 million. He said that the park's focal reason to adopt Morgan was to bring fresh DNA to their breeding program and to bring an attraction to their park. He instead argued for a policy to euthanize stranded orcas if they could not be returned to the ocean., [frontierworld.nl/radio/?p=2173 Radio Actief 3 januari 2014]. Radio Actief, Frontier Radio, 4 januari 2014 On April 23, 2014, the Council of State judged that the transfer to Loro Parque was lawful. The Council reasoned that the park had sufficient knowledge on the treatment of orcas. According to the Council a release Morgan was not an alternative for reasons that she belonged to a species of social animals while her family was not located and; that Morgan was young and it was unclear whether she could feed herself.Verhuizing orka Morgan naar Tenerife 'terecht'. De Stentor.nl, 23 april 2014 Life at Loro Parque Upon Morgan's arrival at Loro Parque, she was introduced to one- year-old Ad√°n and seven-year-old Skyla. Morgan was eventually introduced to the park's oldest female, Kohana (along with Skyla). According to various photographic sources, as of December 7, Morgan has also been introduced to eleven-year-old Tekoa, the park's second oldest male. Morgan has been introduced to sixteen-year-old Keto, the park's oldest male. In May 2012 Loro Parque announced that Morgan is partially deaf as she suffers a profound hearing deficit that could even be full deafness, as probed by electrophysiological methods., Telegraaf newspaper (in Dutch), Aquatic Mammals Journal According to the trainers at the park, Morgan barely responds to whistle signals, but she does respond well to hand and arm gestures. In June 2016, video surfaced of Morgan supposedly beaching herself on stage. The video was released by the animal rights group, the Dolphin Project, along with a video of Morgan banging her head repeatedly against a metal gate inside her enclosure. On December 3rd, 2017, it was announced that Morgan was pregnant. Morgan gave birth to her calf on September 22, 2018. She immediately took to the calf and the two are bonding. The calf was later named Ula and the father is Keto.

She is a biology graduate student, investigating the BRCA1 breast cancer gene. Background Seif grew up in a family of activists, and politics was a constant topic of discussion during her childhood. Her father, Ahmed Seif, who died in 2014, was a human rights attorney and opposition leader who spent five years in prison during the Mubarak regime. During his detention, he was tortured. Her mother, Laila Soueif, is also an activist and a mathematics professor. She helped organize demonstrations against the Mubarak regime over the decades before his downfall. Her mother is \\"known on the streets as brash and courageous, and has on numerous occasions faced down baton-wielding policemen with nothing but her scolding, scathing, booming voice and steely eyes\\". Seif's brother Alaa Abd El-Fattah co-created the Egyptian blog aggregator Manalaa and in 2005 began to document abuses by the Mubarak regime. Alaa was arrested at a demonstration in 2006 and imprisoned for 45 days, during which Mona and his wife Manal helped organize an online campaign to free him. Seif's younger sister, Sanaa Seif, has also been an opposition activist and protester. Seif is a graduate student in cancer biology.

In the year leading up to the revolution Mona became involved in the dissident movement, spreading awareness and attending demonstrations. Between January 25 and February 5, the members of her immediate family and many members of their extended family participated in the Tahrir Square protests. Mona recalls \\"It was a life-changing moment for most of the people in Tahrir Square. You could see the gunshots at people...\\". Post-Mubarak Dr. Aida Seif El Dawla and Mona Seif at the Anti-Torture conference Seif is a founding member of No to Military Trials for Civilians, a group pushing for the release of those detained during the revolution; and end to trials of civilians by military courts; transfer of all such civilian facing trial to the jurisdiction of civilian courts; and the investigation of torture allegations involving military police. Seif wrote on her blog Ma3t, about the military police during crackdowns on Tahrir protesters, requesting people come forward with their stories. She has been critical of the actions of Egypt's interim ruling body the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) saying, of the release of protesters without full exoneration: ‚ÄúThe fact that they have suspended sentences does not give them the pride they deserve as revolutionaries who did nothing wrong.\\" Seif estimates that military courts have sentenced 7,000 civilians since former Hosni Mubarak's ouster in February, 2011. She notes that there has been a shift in the SCAF's approach since March and that protesters are now getting suspended sentences rather than the 3-5-year sentences they were previously getting. She speculates that this may be an attempt to stop the regular marches and may also be due to the pressure applied by international human right groups. She has continued to criticize tactics of the SCAF: \\"We have evidence that the military right now is targeting protesters. ... They selected known figures of the Tahrir protest. They selected people who were known and they tortured and beat them up...and if you read or listen to the testimonies of those who were released, which are a few, we still have a lot of people detained unconstitutionally. And you see that it's not just that they're getting tortured or beaten up, but there's an element of the Army trying to break the revolutionary spirit.\\" Part of Seif's project involves asking detainees who have been released to record what happened to them. In some cases she says she has managed to get their testomies immediately after their release and so record bruise marks and burns. It is Seif's opinion that with these cases the only way to fight them is via the internet. In 2012, she was a finalist for the Front Line Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk, which ultimately went to Syrian blogger Razan Ghazzawi. Controversy When it was announced in April 2013 that Seif was a finalist for the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders presented by Human Rights Watch, both she and HRW were criticised for what some considered taking a firm pro-Palestinian stance. The specific accusations, made by the pro-Zionist UN WATCH were that she tweeted support for violence in the form of attacks on the Egypt-Israel-Jordan gas pipeline; invasion of the Israeli embassy in Cairo and missile attacks on Israel. The accusations were examined and dismissed in detail by Scott Long, who denied the 3 tweets, of 93,000 examined, showed any evidence whatsoever of support for violence.Scott Long, Hillel Neuer: Liar.

The tower stands on the territory of the town of L√ºbbecke. The stone tower was built in 1857 by the barons (Freiherrn) of Bussche-M√ºnch from Benkhausen and was completely renovated in 1996. The tower was erected in response to the increasing gymnastics and hiking movement in Germany at that time. During the Nazi era and the Second World War the tower acted for a time as a training area for the Hitler Youth as well as an observation point, for which purpose it had been increased in height by the addition of a wooden superstructure. In 1986 a radio competition took place at the Wartturm. In the early to mid-1980s a very high transmission mast stood next to the tower, that was significantly higher than the tower itself and, unlike the Wartturm, could be clearly seen from L√ºbbecke. The uninformed often say that the tower is linked to the medieval castle of Reineberg because of its castle-like appearance but are then often surprised to find that it is a product of the Modern Age.The terms Wartturm, Warte, Warth or Burgwarte refer to an isolated watchtower surrounded by ramparts and ditches. They were erected in the Late Middle Ages, for example, on trading routes as toll stations or outside of towns, in order to give early warning of the approach of enemy troops using flag or light signals. This helps to explain why people sometimes mistake when the L√ºbbecke Wartturm was built. The Wartturm has since become the landmark of the traditional Wartturm Run (Wartturmlauf). This fun run takes place annually in June, beginning in the centre L√ºbbecke, is 13.9 kilometres long and climbs a total height of 346 metres.  External links  * Ein Aussichtsturm wie viele andere.
