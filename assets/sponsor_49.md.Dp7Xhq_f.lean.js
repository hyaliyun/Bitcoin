Y31  The Y31 was built from late 1987 through 1991 available in either Sedan or Hardtop guises. The sporty Gran Turismo SV version (discontinued in 1991) had short bumpers with a body kit, and was powered by the 2.0 liter VG20DET engine. The sedan version of the Y31 was facelifted at the launch of the Y32, which replaced the four-door hardtops. The Cedric is mechanically related to the Crew, although the Crew is slightly more compact in size. June 1987 saw a special-edition Cedric built for parade usage. The sedan remained with unchanged body appearance and ceased production in 2015. Private Cedrics were only available in four-door hardtop guise and the wagon and van versions are no longer sold. Engines available continued to be the newly developed VG series engine, with the VG20DET adding DOHC, another first for Nissan. In June 1989 the Nissan Cedric with the VG20DET offered the world's first full range electronically controlled 5-speed automatic transmission. The four-speed automatic transmission is now computer controlled for smoother shifts. The transmission now exclusively uses a floor mounted gearshifter, and a 5-speed manual transmission is still available. The rear suspension was upgraded to multi-link independent setup. Trim levels start with the Super Custom at the bottom, followed by Classic, Classic SV, Gran Turismo, and the VIP Brougham at the top. The Gran Turismo received more sport-oriented styling, adding a youthful appearance, which found new, younger, buyers. The Cedric competed for buyers with related Nissan vehicles that shared platforms used for the Cedric, specifically, the Nissan Cima, Nissan Leopard and the Nissan Gloria, as well as other sport-oriented vehicles, such as the Nissan Cefiro, Nissan Skyline and Nissan Laurel. The Cedric Y31 can be distinguished from its sibling, the Gloria Y31, by the taillights at the back. The vehicle's air conditioning could be adjusted by an infrared remote controlled hand held unit from the rear seat, located in a separate compartment attached on top of the rear armrest at the front. Separate air conditioning and heating vents were provided for rear seat passengers. Nissan Cedric sedan (Japan) Nissan Cedric hardtop sedan 2nd generation Y31 Nissan Cedric Brougham VIP  Second Generation Y31  The Nissan Cedric Y31 remains in production after the launch of the Y32 in 1991. It is targeted for fleet and taxi use. The taxi version Y31 was essentially a trimmed-down version of the upper trim Y31. The fleet taxi Y31 was last updated in 2012, and was in production until 2014. The police car was used by police departments, particularly in Japan, where it was used as a marked police car and an unmarked police car by the Japanese police. The car is popular with taxi companies, particularly in Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong, where a LPG version was used due to laws requiring cabs to run on LPG only. In Jakarta, Indonesia, the diesel powered Cedric Y31 was used as an executive taxi from 1993 to 2009 before replaced by the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Toyota Camry (XV40). The taxi Y31 sold poorly in Hong Kong during the later years as the Toyota Crown Comfort became the preferred choice of taxi operators, due to the very spacious rear cabin and lower running costs.  Gloria Y31  The Gloria Y31 was the sibling of the Cedric, with a similar appearance, albeit with different taillights.

They form one of the necessary elements of a working petroleum system. They are organic-rich sediments that may have been deposited in a variety of environments including deep water marine, lacustrine and deltaic. Oil shale can be regarded as an organic-rich but immature source rock from which little or no oil has been generated and expelled. Subsurface source rock mapping methodologies make it possible to identify likely zones of petroleum occurrence in sedimentary basins as well as shale gas plays.  Types of source rocks  Source rocks are classified from the types of kerogen that they contain, which in turn governs the type of hydrocarbons that will be generated. * Type I source rocks are formed from algal remains deposited under anoxic conditions in deep lakes: they tend to generate waxy crude oils when submitted to thermal stress during deep burial. * Type II source rocks are formed from marine planktonic and bacterial remains preserved under anoxic conditions in marine environments: they produce both oil and gas when thermally cracked during deep burial. * Type III source rocks are formed from terrestrial plant material that has been decomposed by bacteria and fungi under oxic or sub-oxic conditions: they tend to generate mostly gas with associated light oils when thermally cracked during deep burial. Most coals and coaly shales are generally Type III source rocks.  Maturation and expulsion  With increasing burial by later sediments and increase in temperature, the kerogen within the rock begins to break down. This thermal degradation or cracking releases shorter chain hydrocarbons from the original large and complex molecules occurring in the kerogen. The hydrocarbons generated from thermally mature source rock are first expelled, along with other pore fluids, due to the effects of internal source rock over-pressuring caused by hydrocarbon generation as well as by compaction. Once released into porous and permeable carrier beds or into faults planes, oil and gas then move upwards towards the surface in an overall buoyancy-driven process known as secondary migration.  Mapping source rocks in sedimentary basins  Areas underlain by thermally mature generative source rocks in a sedimentary basin are called generative basins or depressions or else hydrocarbon kitchens. Mapping those regional oil and gas generative \\"hydrocarbon kitchens\\" is feasible by integrating the existing source rock data into seismic depth maps that structurally follow the source horizon(s). It has been statistically observed at a world scale Gerard Demaison: \\"The Generative Basin Concept\\" in: American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Memoir #35 : \\"Petroleum Geochemistry and Basin Evaluation\\", 1984 , Edited by Gerard Demaison and Roelof J. Murris, that zones of high success ratios in finding oil and gas generally correlate in most basin types (such as intracratonic or rift basins) with the mapped \\"generative depressions\\". Cases of long distance oil migration into shallow traps away from the \\"generative depressions\\" are usually found in foreland basins. Besides pointing to zones of high petroleum potential within a sedimentary basin, subsurface mapping of a source rock's degree of thermal maturity is also the basic tool to identify and broadly delineate shale gas plays.  World class source rocks  Certain source rocks are referred to as \\"world class\\", meaning that they are not only of very high quality but are also thick and of wide geographical distribution. Examples include: * Middle Devonian to lower Mississippian widespread marine anoxic oil and gas source beds in the Mid-Continent and Appalachia areas of North America: (e.g. the Bakken Formation of the Williston Basin, the Antrim Shale of the Michigan Basin, the Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian Basin). * Kimmeridge Clay ‚Äì This upper Jurassic marine mudstone or its stratigraphic equivalents generated most of the oil found in the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea.Kimmeridgian Shales Total Petroleum System of the North Sea Graben Province ‚Äì USGS Bulletin * La Luna Formation ‚Äì This Late Cretaceous (mostly Turonian) formation generated most of the oil in northwestern Venezuela.James, K.H. 2000.

Affiliated to the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Center (IDSC), the POPC was established in 2003, as the first poll center in Egypt responsible for studying trends of Egyptian public opinion towards different internal social, political and economic affairs. Such trends are forwarded to decision makers to use them in the preparation of different plans and policies. The POPC also measures public opinion preferences in order to understand priority issues and put them on the priority list of decision makers. The POPC aims to provide accurate and fast measurement of Egyptian public opinion trends in a way that helps decision makers take accurate decisions. The POPC tries to reinforce the role of polls in supporting decision makers and achieving comprehensive development, strengthening the bond between the government and the people and building a social culture that accepts the idea of public opinion polling and encouraging positive participation. The POPC depend on telephones in their data collection process. A data base compromising ten millions publicly listed landline telephone numbers is used. Telephones have been proven to be less costly and time and effort saving. A uni-stage stratified sample is designed for Egyptian households in different governorates after being divided into three areas: urban governorates, Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. Relative weights are then given to each area according to their actual representation in society. Sample size used by the POPC ranges from 1 to 2 thousand, depending on the nature of the poll. A factor analysis method is used to calculate the economic class of households, depending on the ownership of certain possessions, and dividing them into three economic classes: low, middle and high. An Electronic Poll Management System has been used by the POPC since 2006. This system is considered as one of the pioneer systems in the field of public opinion poll management in the Middle East due to its high capabilities in completely automating the work flow. The EMS is the first Arab professional effort done to provide an integrated surveying solution based on the use of the latest technologies and supported by theoretical and scientific standards and specifications. Polls conducted by the POPC cover a wide range of topics, particularly pertaining to economic, social and political matters. Polls conducted include subsidies, healthcare, investment, education, unemployment, the job market, political participation, political amendments, women's participation in political life, role of women in society, and many others. The Public Opinion Poll Center has many national, regional and international partners. On the international level, POPC has previously conducted polls in cooperation with the UNDP, WTO, Globescan, and several others. On the national level, POPC works with all different ministries, government institutions such as the Social Fund for Development (SFD) and National Council for Childhood and Motherhood (NCCM), as well as local and research centers and national councils.

It was renamed as \\"Shahnoor\\" by Islamic rulers but again acquired, rebuilt and got its name \\"Narnala\\" by ruler RaoRana Narnal Singh II Solanki, who migrated from Rajasthan, Tonk district, originally by Patan, Gujarat and was a descendant of Narnal Singh Swami. Rulers of Narnala Briefly, the fort was first established in around 10 century A.D. by Gond Kings and major fortifications were made by Narnal Singh Swami and some by RaoRana Narnal Singh II Solanki, like the Mahakali Gate. It was then taken over by other Islamic rulers. In the mid 15th Century, it was occupied and rebuilt by the Mughals, becoming one of Berar Subah's thirteen sarkar. Later, in late 17th century, it was under Maratha Empire, controlled by Bhosale of Nagpur Kingdom and their reliable regent and Sardar, earlier the ruler of Narnala, the Solanki Rajput Killedar family of RaoRana mentioned above. After built by RajGond People, 1) A Somvanshi Kshatriya, Chaulukya Rajput ruler Narnal Singh Swami 2) Rajgond of Devgarh-Nagpur (around 1400 CE) 3) Bahamani Sultanate (1422‚Äì1436) 4) Farooqui dynasty (1437) 5) Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk (1490) 6) RaoRana Narnal Singh II Solanki (1512) 7) Burhan Imad Shah, Imad Shahi Dynasty (1572) 8) Ahmadnagar Sultanate 9) Mughals (1597‚Äì98) 10) Maratha Empire (1701‚Äì1803), Raje Parsoji Bhosale's, regent RaoRana Thakur Rajput Killedar and their descendants, until 1803. About Narnal Singh Raja Narnal Singh or Narnal Singh Swami was a scion of Somvanshi Kshatriya Rajput Chaulukya ruler, on whose name the fort is named. The fort was ruled by several rulers and killedars after him thus making a lot of changes in the original Rajput style. After him, his descendant from the north, the younger brother of the ruling family of Rao Raja of Tonk, Rajasthan came to this fort. Rao Bairam Singh, was the younger brother from the \\"Rao Raja of Tonk\\", migrated from Rajasthan, to Narnala, Maharashtra. His grandson Rao Narnal Singh, earned the title \\"Rana\\", thus becoming \\"RaoRana\\" of the Narnala, and was granted the Jagir of 4 Mahals (58 villages) in Narnala and some special rights and privileges of the fort, by son of Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk, ruler of Berar Sultanate a Kanarese Hindu, converted to Islam. After Imad Shahi Dynasty, the family continued to rule the fort, but then later they had a disagreement with the later rulers, the Mughal subhedars, over some issue and they lost the rights in a small battle to Mughal rulers, declining there sovereignty, therefore, losing all the land rights as well. They fought against mughals alongside Rani Durgawati, and were granted the title Thakur and Zamindari, by the ruler RajGond Raja of Devgarh. They were invited to join Marathas by Parsoji Bhosale who discovered this family to be of great valour. Raorana Thakur joined Parsoji Bhosale and served Maratha Empire, after knowing that the Bhosales are descendants from Maharanas of Mewar. Raghoji I Bhonsle, granted them the title \\"Killedar\\" of Narnala again, along with the Sar Patilki rights of 12 villages and Deshmukh of 10 villages in Malkapur pargana in the sarkar of Narnala. Till date, the family carry the surname Patil along with Rana, with due respect of the trust shown by the Raghoji I Bhonsle, the Raje Bhosale of Nagpur Kingdom. A younger brother of the then Killedar Sriman Thakur Rao Rana Sar Patil (Deshmukh), shifted his capital to Nadgaon, dividing the family in two parts. There are 8 houses of the family for till now. The title holder Zamindars of which are as follows: 1) From the Nadgaon branch of Zamindars, carried the title Vatandar, Rao and Patil. Later, the descendants earned various titles in pre- independance period like Rao Sahib, Diwan Bahadur, Rao Bahadur,etc. Most honoured and notable person of this family is Smt. Pratibha Patil, the ex- President of India. 2) From the Malkapur branch of the Zamindars, carrying the titular rights of Vatandar Thakur Rao Ranapatil. After the khalsa of the watan rights and the pargana officer's responsibilities of his grandfather, the elder descendant, Sriman Thakur Rao Onkarsingh Patil / Ranapatil, with the suggestion from HH Rana of Barwani and help from Rana of Pratappur and Bargal Jagirdar of Talode, permanantly shifted to Talode, Khandesh in late 19th century.  Details It consists of three small forts: Zafarabad (or Jafarabad) fort on the east, Narnala in the centre and Teliagarh to the west. The lake within the centre of the complex is said to possess healing properties and according to legend contained the philosopher's stone, though no stone was found when the lake dried up in the drought and Indian famine of 1899-1900. Occupied since at least the Khalji dynasty, the fort is well known for the Muslim saint Burhanuddin, \\"Bagh Sawar Wali\\", and it is said that many white tigers were seen with him at that time. Adli Beg or Atalu Beg carved many Arabic inscriptions into the fort and the Kadak Bijli cannon. It is also the birthplace of the Mughal Aurangzeb's great-grandson. Location The fort is located in the Akot Taluka of Akola district, Berar at coordinates of 20.703 N and 76.997 E. The closest city is Akot, which is 18 km away. It is at the southernmost tip of the Satpura Hills at an elevation of 912 meters above sea level. Currently the fort falls within the Melghat Tiger Reserve. The third-longest cannon in India, at 27 feet History Narnala fort, circa 1860 Mahakaali gate is Beautifully carved Shows the fortification of Narnala The exact date of construction is not known. The first fortifications, according to local legend, were made by Naryendrapai or Narnal Singh Swami, a descendant of the Somvanshi Kshatriya Pandavas and at the time Emperor of Hastinapur, (Delhi), a branch from Somvanshi Kshatriya Chaulukya ruler of Ayodhya, whose descendant \\"Raorana Narnal Singh II Solanki\\", later in early 16th century ruled Narnala for some years. It likely predates 1400 CE as Firishta -the Persian historian- records that Ninth Badshaha Shahbudeen Ahmad Shah I Wali (1422 CE to 1436 CE) during construction of the Gawilgarh fort, made repairs to Narnala fort when he camped at Achalpur (Elichpur) from 1425 to 1428. This would mean that the Narnala fort was constructed before Bahmani rule. In 1437, when Nashir Khan the subhedar of Khandesh invaded Berar, the governor of the province (also called Khan-i-Jahan), remained loyal to his master, Ala-ud-din Ahmad Shah II (son of Ahmad Shah I Wali) and retreated to Narnala. He was besieged by disaffected nobles and Nashir Khan, but managed to break through the besieging force with help of Khalaf Hasan Basri who was sent by Ala-ud-din Ahmed Shah II. Nasir Khan was defeated. In 1487 CE Narnala along with Gawilgarh came under the control of Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk, the founder of Imad shahi dynasty at Ellichpur (or Achalpur). In 1572 Burhan Imad Shah (also of the Imad Shahi dynasty) was confined in Narnala by his minister Tufal Khan. This gave Murtaza Nizam Shah of Ahmadnagar a pretext to lay siege to the fortress. He captured both king and minister, subsequently putting them to death. Thus the fort passed into the hands of the Ahmednagar kings. In 1597‚Äì98, the fort was captured by Akbar's officers, Saiyid Yusuf Khan Mashhad and Shaikh Abul Fazl, and renamed Shanur. from the officer who held it for the Sultan of Ahmadnagar. During Akbar‚Äôs rule, Narnala was one of the Sarkars of Berar Subah (see Berar Subah). Sardar Beg Mirza and Qader Beg Mirza, hereditary descendants of the Mughal dynasty in the 18th century, stayed near Argaon because Shah Beg Subedar of Berar held the fort. Narnala was captured by Parsoji Bhosale in 1701 CE and remained with the Marathas till it was taken over by the British in 1803 CE. The Islamic architecture It is also said that the Shahnoor fort is modified /built by the Sultan Mahmoud Gazhnavi because he is a follower of Bagh-sawar wali Burhanuddin, maintained after Imad shahi dynasty and after this Akbar invaded Berar and was maintained by Mughals. Mughals recreated the Narnala Fort with Mughal architecture and built mosque at the fort. By his killedar, Shah Dulha Rehman Ghazi of Ellichpur (now Achalpur) was maternal cousin of Sultan Mehmood Ghaznavi and maternal grandson of Sultan Nasiruddin. He marched for battle against Rajah Eil. Through the route of Shahnoor Fort he stayed here threefold night and prayed. Ahmad Shah Bahamani got the fort repaired around 1425 when he constructed Gavilgad with a view to obstructing the invaders from the north frontier of his kingdom. Nearly all the present buildings seem to be of Islamic origin as the later Islamic rulers modified them. The fort passed on to Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk when he became an independent ruler by 1490 as he was the Subhedar of Berar under the Bahamanis. Gavilgad was also passed on to him. Later, Burhan Imad Shah was imprisoned on this fort by one of his Amirs Tufalkhan who crowned himself. In the battle that was fought between Tufalkhan and Murtaza Nizam Shah in 1572 Tufalkhan was defeated and had to flee and took asylum with Muhammad Shah of Khandesh. On being threatened by Murtaza Nizam Shah of dire consequences if the asylum was continued, Muhammad Shah of Khandesh, refused to give refuge to Tufalkhan who was forced to return to Narnala fort and stay there. The fort was invested by the army of Murtaza. The fort surrendered and Tufalkhan and also Burhan Imad Shah were imprisoned along with 40 others. They were confined in the fort of Lohagad where they died while in captivity. Some historians say that all of them were poisoned under the orders of Murtaza Nizam Shah. After the battle that was fought between the armies of the Ahmadnagar kingdom and the Emperor Akbar on 26 January 1597 in which the armies of the Adilshahi Emperor who along with the Kutub Shah of Golconda was an ally of Nizamshah emerged successful. The fort can now ho ascended by a motorable road. About halfway up it crosses first one and then another piece of level ground, each thickly sprinkled with Islamic tombs. The path passes two other strong gateways and one slighter one before entering the heart of the fort, and climbs meanwhile to the uppermost glials. Between the last two gateways are the domed tombs of Bagh Savar Wali and Gaz Badshah Wali, the former not only rode a tiger in his life but the old Gazetteer slates \\"even now a tiny white tiger may be seen at night going to and from his tomb.\\" Passing the last gateway one comes almost at once before the Ambar Bangala, the kacheri of former days. After his expedition across the Gangetic plains in 1017, of Al-Biruni to compose his Tarikh Al-Hind in order to understand the Indians and their beliefs. Major features The fort covers an area of . The major features and architecture were done by Hindu rulers, mainly the Solanki Rajput Killedars and the rulers of Gondwana, I.e., the RajGond, but modified by Islamic rulers into Islamic style by the time. It has 360 watchtowers, six large and twenty-one small gates. The large gates are called the Delhi darvaza, the Sirpur darvaza, the Akot darvaza, and the Shahanur darvaza. The innermost of the three gate-ways is the Mahakali gate named by Killedar family as Goddess Mahakali is their family deity. It is built of white sandstone and is highly ornate. It is decorated with conventional lotus flowers, a rich cornice, and later flourished with Arabic inscriptions, and flanked by projecting balconies with panels of stone lattice-work displaying considerable variety of design. It is considered an example of Sultanate style of architecture. An inscription records the fact that the gate was built in the reign of Shahab-ud-din Mahmud Shah (Bahmani) by Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk in 1486. A short verse from the Quran is also inscribed. The fort still display \\" Ashtakamal\\" eight petals Lotus which was the symbol of Narnal Singh's Solanki dynasty goddess Khimaj or Mahalaxmi. These lotuses are visible on the mosques and many other places. Hence it is evident that Islamic rulers made changes in Narnal Singh's original architectural construction and converted the place in Moghul/Islamic form. It was impossible for any ruler to rebuild the entire fort considering the geographical location of the fort. It has an aqueduct and drains to catch rainwater. Along with 19 tanks, four of which are full throughout the year, this ensured a plentiful water supply to the fort residents. Other buildings within the complex There was a Mahakali Goddess Temple in the staircase of Gate. The idol was possibly destroyed by Mughal rulers This is Palace which was for Queens * Mahakali Temple - The Mahakali Dwar or door named after a temple of Mahakali in the beginning of fort which is in ruins now. It has been said that the temple had idols of deities which was later stolen. * Rani Mahal - Rani Mahal or Rani Palace is still standing. It was the place of residence for the Ranis, Conquibines and guest women. * Peshva Mahal - Peshva came here and stayed along with the Bhosale Maharaja of Nagpur for an important meeting, the place is called Peshva Mahal also in ruins now. * Baradari * Sarrafkhana * Arsenal of old guns called nau-gazi tope, meaning 9-yard gun, a reference to its length and not range * Elephant stables of Narnal Singh and Bhosale Maharaja. * The ruins of a palace erected specially in honour of Raja Raghuji Bhonsle * Another mosque on Teliagad built by Bahamanis. * The Jama Masjid, now in ruins, is said to have borne an Arabic inscription recording its construction in 1509 by Mahabat Khan, but this has disappeared. * A small mosque attributed to Aurangzeb.

The Gesta Hungarorum (\\"Deeds of the Hungarians\\") mentions that the ancestors of the family, the brothers Hont (Hunt) and P√°zm√°ny (Pazman), originally from the Duchy of Swabia in the Holy Roman Empire, arrived in the late 10th century to the court of Grand Prince G√©za of the Magyars: > The next arrivals were Hunt and Pazman, two half-brothers, courageous > knights of Swabian origin. These two and their retainers had been journeying > through Hungary with the intention of passing over the sea when they were > detained by Duke G√©za, and finally they girded King Stephen with the sword > of knighthood at the river Hron, after the German custom. The clan Hontpaznan was mentioned for the first time in 1226 in a charter. Several prominent families of the kingdom (e.g., Szentgy√∂rgyi and Forg√°ch) descended from the gens. The branches of the clan By the 13th century, the clan divided into 12 branches: *the branch of Boz√≥k held possessions in Hont County and they had two castles; *the possessions of the branch of F√∂d√©mes (now Ipeƒæsk√© √öƒæany) were located in Hont and Borsod counties and their castle in Borsod County was built without royal authorization and therefore, it was demolished in 1298; *the members of the branch of B√©ny owned lands in Hont and Nyitra counties and they held three castles; *the branch of Csalomja (today Mal√° ƒåalomija) held possessions in Hont county; *the lands of the members of the branch of G√≠mes (now Jelenec) were located in Nitra County and they had a castle built there; *the branch of Szeg possessed lands in Nitra County; *the members of the branch of Szentgy√∂rgy and Csekl√©sz (today Bernol√°kovo) held possessions in Pre≈°porok County and they had three castles by the end of the 13th century; *the possessions of the branch Pog√°ny of Garadna were located in Trencs√©n county; *the members of the branch of √öjhely owned lands in Bihar County where they had a castle built; *the branch P√°zm√°ny of Panasz held possessions in Bihar County; *the members of the branch of Beszterce owned lands in Bihar County; *the possessions of the branch of Czibak-Batthy√°nyi were also located in Bihar County. Notable members of the clan The first notable members of the clan were the brothers Hont and P√°zm√°ny who assisted G√©za's son, the future King Stephen I of Hungary against his relative, the pagan Kopp√°ny who claimed for G√©za's inheritance. The deed of foundation of the Pannonhalma Archabbey (issued in 1001) referred to both brothers as the king's military leaders (duces). The brothers were granted possessions on the north-western parts of the kingdom (primarily in present-day Slovakia). Hont County was named after one of them. Lampert (?-1132) founded the Abbey of Boz√≥k. His first wife was the sister of King Ladislaus I of Hungary. He held about 30 possessions and thus he was one of the wealthiest landowners of the kingdom. In 1124, he took part in the campaign of King Stephen II of Hungary against Dalmatia. Lampert was murdered by the followers of King B√©la II the Blind, because he was suspected of supporting Boris Kalamanos's claim to the throne. Around 1201, Martin (?-1236/1245) held the office of count (comes) at the court of the future King Andrew II of Hungary, and served as the Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia. In 1202 and between 1212-1213, Martin was the Ban of Slavonia and he was styled Ban also in 1224 and 1234. In 1214, he held the office of judge royal (orsz√°gb√≠r√≥). He founded the Abbey of Ipolys√°g (today ≈†ahy in Slovakia). Achilles (b. 1210-1252) was bishop of P√©cs between 1251 and 1252. Lampert (of the branch of Csalomja) was bishop of Eger from 1247 to 1275. Iv√°nka II from the Szeg branch was Judge royal sometime before 1289. =G√≠mes branch= Andrew I was a confidant of B√©la IV of Hungary. He erected the castles of G√≠mes (Jelenec) and Tur√≥c (Zniev). His sons were John, archbishop of Kalocsa from 1278 to 1301, and Thomas III, an influential baron. Both were strong partisans of King Andrew III of Hungary. Another sons were Andrew II and Iv√°nka III, who were killed by Matthew III Cs√°k. Alternate theory on their origin Honta Swabian knight, according to medieval chronicles, a \\"Slovak nobleman\\", according to Slovak historiansdepicted in the Chronicon Pictum Some modern authors suggest that the clan Hont-Poznany was formed by intermarriages of two separate families, the Hunts and the Poznans (\\"P√°zm√°nys\\", \\"Posnans\\") when the latter's male line died out in the mid-12th century. They claim that the ancestors both of the two families were already nobles at the time of Great Moravia and preserved their possessions after the incorporation of their territories into the arising Hungarian state. The theory suggests that they kept their Christian faith during the 10th century and its followers claim that the foundation deed of the Benedictine monastery of Bzov√≠k proves that hereditary estates from the time before the arrival of the Magyars prevailed in the Hunts' property. The P√°zm√°nys oversaw the Benedictine monastery below Zobor hill near Nitra and became its secular patrons. According to the theory, the seat of the Hunt family was the Hont castle and they ruled in the Central Ipeƒæ region in today's southern Slovakia, while the P√°zm√°nys ruled in the region of today's north western Slovakia in the 10th century. Both families acknowledged the sovereignty of Michael of the House of √Årp√°d and thus they became nobles at his court in Nitra. After Michael's death, the new ruler, Vajk (Stephen I) and the local nobility, spearheaded by the P√°zm√°ny and Hunt houses, developed very close personal ties and while fighting the Kopp√°ny rebellion in 997, Stephen took shelter with P√°zm√°ny and Hunt (\\"Poznano\\" and \\"Cuntio\\"); they in turn added their troops to the retinue of Stephen's Bavarian wife Giselle. The united forces then defeated Kopp√°ny, making Stephen the sole ruler of the emerging Hungarian state. In the 11th and 12th century the Hunts owned estates mainly in the county of Hont and along the Ipeƒæ river. By the 11th and 12th centuries the P√°zm√°ns' estates were mainly in the valley of the Nitra river. According to the alternate theory, the P√°zm√°ns' male line died out in the mid-12th century; allied by marriage to the Hunts, the line became \\"Hont-P√°zm√°ny\\". The oldest genealogic data about the Poznans are preserved in the Zobor charters (1111-1113). The charters contain names at least of fourth nobles from the Poznan family - Una, Bacha (Baƒça) and two sons of Bukven - Deda (Dedo) and Caca (Kaƒç√§). The high number of Slavic names in the Hunt-Poznan family is obvious until the 14th century (Stojslav, Vlk, Dr≈æislav, etc.). The character of their hereditary property also indicates pre-Hungarian origin Naturally, those who belonged to the royal court or obtained property in Hungarian ethnic territories self-identified with the majority population in the area.

Since 1987 it is directed by Eugenio Alipede. History The Corale Alpina Savonese was founded in November 1949 by a group of university students, very fond of popular music typical of northern Italian area, surrounded by mountains. Since 1951 the group has been exhibiting in public, at first locally and then later both in Italy and abroad. It received high scores in several national musical competitions for popular music. Exhibitions abroad began in 1969, in France, at Grenoble and at the Castle of Lesdigui√®res, in Vizille. From 1983 to nowadays the choir performed six times (in 1983, 1988, 1989, 1993, 1997 and 2002) at Villingen-Schwenningen (in the Black Forest, Germany), twin town of Savona. In 1985 it held some concerts at Reutlingen (Germany). In May 2006 the group sang in the Cathedral of Orange (France), guests of the choir La Cl√® de Chants. Since 1978 the Corale Alpina Savonese have organised important choir festivals in the theatre ‚ÄúGabriello Chiabrera‚Äù in Savona; several well-known Italian choirs have performed in this musical event in the past, including I Crodaioli of Bepi de Marzi, author of several famous popular and traditional Italian songs like Signore delle cime, translated in several languages, and the choir of Alpine Brigade Taurinense. The group sang in several national and international musical events. Lastly it performed during the international festival ‚ÄúSingen in den Bergen‚Äù at Wolfsberg (Austria) in 2003, twice, in 2005 then again in 2006, at the ‚ÄùInternational Choir Festival‚Äù in Puster Valley, a prestigious international event with choirs from all over the world. There are two particularly important concerts to mention: in 1960, at Imperia, in honour of Achille Compagnoni, the Italian conqueror of K2, and in 1972, at Savona, on board Impavido class destroyer Intrepido, of the Italian Navy, during the ceremony for assignment of battle ensign. The Corale Alpina Savonese is associated to Feniarco (Federazione Nazionale delle Associazioni Corali Regionali, Italian for National Federation of the Regional Choral Associations). Repertoire The repertoire ranges over from Alpini songs to spirituals, from typical Italian popular/traditional music to sacred music and to songs, some of them almost unknown, of the tradition of Liguria.

The business was established in London in 1947 to service the UK market but has since grown to become a global company with sales offices in six countries. History Panorama Antennas Ltd. was founded in 1947, under the name of J.F.J. Products, by a group of ex-servicemem, including Leon Jesman. J.F.J. was a light engineering company that manufactured a diverse range of products from mop heads to Perspex cake stands to the kind of dolls‚Äô eyes that close when the toy is laid flat. In 1949, to improve the quality and reduce the cost of the company‚Äôs dolls‚Äô eyes, which were initially machined out of plastic blocks, Jesman designed and built a plastic insert injection moulding machine from surplus aeroplane parts, thereby becoming one of the pioneeres of practical insert injection moulding.The Sunday Times, 11 October 1998. Business (Section 3) page 13. JFJ‚Äôs newfound injection moulding capabilities, which were virtually unique at the time for a company of its size, led to a radical rethinking of its manufacturing activities. Its work became centred upon producing parts for the expanding television market such as cable assemblies, connectors and, most notably, set-top antennas. With this change of focus came a change of name and in 1952 the business began trading as the Panorama Radio Company. From this point on, supplying the growing demand for antennas in the European market became increasingly central to Panorama‚Äôs operations, with the company eventually abandoning its other manufacturing activities to focus on this one aspect of the business. The kind of work Panorama performs in this field has changed over the years to keep pace with the emergence of new technologies. The company provided for TV in the 1950s and 1960s, supplied car antennas for portable transistor radios from the early 1960s, developed antennas for hand held VHF and UHF devices used by groups such as the Ministry of Defence and emergency services during the 1970s and, finally, dedicated its production activities to providing for the new cell phone systems which spread across Europe in the 1980s and 1990s. The complete transformation of the company from general manufacturing to specialist antenna production was acknowledged in 1974, when the old partnership was reorganised and the current company, Panorama Antennas Limited, was formed as a concern wholly owned by the Jesman family. Current operations GSM was integral to Panorama‚Äôs operations until the late 1990s. The company was the first organisation to design and produce mobile antennas ready for the UK launch of the UK 900 MHz cellular network on 1 January 1985 and by 1998 had captured 75% of the market for external aerials used by mobile phone operators. It also became a founding member of the Federation of Communications Services Ltd.http://www.fcs.org.uk/Members/MembersDirectory.aspx?MembersCriteria=&Page;=4 Panorama particularly came to specialize in providing GSM glassmount antennas for car kits and was not only the first company in Europe to sell glassmounts but also developed the first solid state coupling circuit for glassmounts in the world. With the expansion of Panorama‚Äôs operations as a result of the GSM boom came an increased attention to quality control and testing. In 1989 Panorama became the first European company to achieve ISO 9002 accreditation for antenna manufacture and during the 1990s began testing its attennas with an on-site anechoic chamber, another 'first of its kind' for antenna design in Europe. Today Panorama provides a wide range of antennas to cope with the diverse needs of the modern communications industry. The company manufactures antennas to suit all frequencies from 150 MHz to 5 GHz, covering a wide range of applications including 3G, DAB, GPRS, GPS, in-building, ISM Band, M2M, GSM, P25, PMR, TETRA UHF, TETRA 800 and LAN.http://www.arabianbusiness.com/499752-headline-tuning-into-a-booming- market Panorama is based in Wandsworth, London, has sales offices in seven countries and an online store specialising in 3G and WLAN.

Biography Peter Elfelt was born Peter Lars Petersen in Denmark on 1 January 1866. (He changed his name to Elfelt when he began making films.)Fru Anna Larssen I Sit Paakl√¶dningsv√¶relse, K√∏benhavn Avis, January 1901, retrieved 2008-05-27 from Stumfilm Website He apprenticed in photography in Hiller√∏d in 1893 with the photographer Carl Rathsack. He also studied with the camera builder Jens Poul Andersen. In 1893, Elfelt opened his own atelier in Copenhagen with his two brothers as his assistants. As his photographic skills became appreciated, his business flourished and by 1901 Elfelt was named \\"Kongelige Hoffotograf\\" (Royal Court Photographer). During a trip to Paris in 1896, Elfelt obtained a set of detailed Cinematographe plans from the French inventor Jules Carpentier. He had a film camera constructed by Jens Poul Andersen. In the beginning of 1897, he shot the first Danish film -- a one-minute sequence called K√∏rsel med Gr√∏nlandske Hunde (Traveling with Greenlandic Dogs). During the following 15 years, he made short nature films and newsreels about the Danish royal family. Elfelt shot almost 200 short films in all. In 1903 Elfelt filmed his only drama. The short film, titled Henrettelsen (Capital Execution), was the first fiction film made in Denmark. Based upon the actual execution of a French woman who murdered her two children, it starred the singer Francesca Nathansen and was filmed in the arcade of the Christiansborg Castle. There is some doubt whether the film was ever shown in public. When Elfelt was asked in 1926 if he had ever filmed a drama, he remembered being reluctant about this film. Elfelt also shot the first advertising film. There is a 1904 example which advertises bock beer for the Svendborg Brewery. Elfelt opened the \\"K√∏benhavn Kinoptikon\\" movie theater in 1901. Although Elfelt was Denmark's first pioneer of filmmaking, he considered film as secondary to his work as a photographer.McKernan, Luke, Ole Brage (ed.), Danmarks Radio Praesenterer Elfelt Film (Copenhagen: Danmarks Radio, 1975)Marguerite Engberg, Dansk Stumfilm I (Copenhagen: Rhodos Forlag, 1977) Elfelt died on 18 February 1931.

This is the comb space with the line segment \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\times (0,1) deleted.

The deleted comb space, D, is connected: ::Let E be the comb space without \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\times (0,1] . E is also path connected and the closure of E is the comb space. As E \\\\subset D \\\\subset the closure of E, where E is connected, the deleted comb space is also connected. 3\\\\. The deleted comb space is not path connected since there is no path from (0,1) to (0,0): ::Suppose there is a path from p = (0, 1) to the point (0, 0) in D. Let ∆í : [0, 1] ‚Üí D be this path. We shall prove that ∆í ‚àí1{p} is both open and closed in [0, 1] contradicting the connectedness of this set. Clearly we have ∆í ‚àí1{p} is closed in [0, 1] by the continuity of ∆í. To prove that ∆í ‚àí1{p} is open, we proceed as follows: Choose a neighbourhood V (open in R2) about p that doesn‚Äôt intersect the x‚Äìaxis. Suppose x is an arbitrary point in ∆í ‚àí1{p}. Clearly, f(x) = p. Then since f ‚àí1(V) is open, there is a basis element U containing x such that ∆í(U) is a subset of V. We assert that ∆í(U) = {p} which will mean that U is an open subset of ∆í ‚àí1{p} containing x. Since x was arbitrary, ∆í ‚àí1{p} will then be open. We know that U is connected since it is a basis element for the order topology on [0, 1]. Therefore, ∆í(U) is connected. Suppose ∆í(U) contains a point s other than p. Then s = (1/n, z) must belong to D. Choose r such that 1/(n + 1) < r < 1/n. Since ∆í(U) does not intersect the x-axis, the sets A = (‚àí‚àû, r) √ó \\\\R and B = (r, +‚àû) √ó \\\\R will form a separation on f(U); contradicting the connectedness of f(U). Therefore, f ‚àí1{p} is both open and closed in [0, 1]. This is a contradiction. 4\\\\.

Lodge Freeway access road. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The Virginia Park Historic District is an example of a well‚Äìpreserved late nineteenth to early twentieth century residential community. The residences are testimonials to the wealth of early Virginia Park residents, as the area was conceived as an upper-middle class enclave. Many homes were completed by prominent Detroit architects, and display a diversity of architectural styles.  History  The district was laid out in 1893 by developed by John W. Leggett, Frank E. Snow, and Joseph C. Hough. Ninety-two lots were platted and each given a name (such as Tanglewood, Thisteldown, and Sorrento) in the original plat. The developers placed a number of restrictions on the area to ensure an attractive community. This quiet boulevard attracted a mix of businessmen and professionals. The first houses were constructed in 1895, and by 1908 more than two dozen houses had been constructed in the district. By 1910, homeowners became concerned about the effect of the increasing commercialization of Woodward Avenue on property values, and they formed the Virginia Avenue Improvement Association. The association proposed to re-landscape the subdivision, and it developed an attractive entrance to the community. The neighborhood continued to thrive during the 1920s, but in the 1930s it suffered from the Great Depression, the effects of which continued through the 1940s. By the 1950s and 1960s, many of the houses had absentee landlords, or were divided into rooming houses. The Algiers Motel, at one time located at the corner of Virginia Park and Woodward, was the scene of an incident of police brutality during the 1967 Detroit riot where three men were killed and others were beaten. In 1979, General Motors announced its plan to renovate the area north of its World Headquarters. This fostered rehabilitation in the Virginia Park district. The Algiers Motel was demolished in 1979, and replaced with a park space. The Virginia Park Historic District is considered to mark the northern boundary of the New Center area of Detroit. Description The Virginia Park District was platted as a series of lots 50 feet wide and 163 feet deep. The original restrictions in the neighborhood ensured a uniformity in the streetscape. All buildings are constructed of brick or stone, and have the same setback from the street. All are single family houses, with no more than one house on each fifty foot lot. At the time of its historic designation, the district included 57 structures, all but three of which contribute to the historic character of neighborhood. Non-contributing structures included an apartment building at 650 Virginia Park, an office building at 613 Virginia Park, and a hospital (demolished in 2014) at 801-831 Virginia Park. Fifty-one of the contributing structures were used as homes, two as offices and one as a rest home. The residences were constructed between 1895 and 1915, with the older structures placed closer to Woodward, and newer ones, in general, farther westward.

The soldiers, after being misinformed that they were being transported to Southampton to be demobilized, were then ordered to board troop ships for France. The mutiny was brought to an end without bloodshed when General Sir Hugh Trenchard threatened lethal force. Events On 13 January 1919, around 5,000 soldiersIt was initially reported that 20,000 soldiers had mutinied. Boyle states that Trenchard later put the figure at 5,000 (p. 324) mutinied in Southampton, taking over the docks and refusing to obey orders. The former Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force General Sir Hugh Trenchard arrived in Southampton in mid-January after Sir William Robertson, the Commander-in-Chief of Home Forces asked him to take charge. Trenchard had witnessed mutinies among French troops during World War I, and was quite prepared to be ruthless in his dealings.Lamb, Dave 1919: The Southampton mutiny 2005 After speaking to the ineffective camp commandant and sizing up the situation, Trenchard marched out onto the docks and personally issued a loud summons for the men to assemble. He then informed the soldiers that he would hear their grievances but only after they had returned to their duties. This resulted in much heckling and Trenchard almost knocked over by the restless surging crowd. Leaving the scene in some disorder, he decided force would be needed, and arranged for 250 soldiers, including military policemen, to be sent to the docks. Whilst they were en route, the General Officer Commanding Southern Command telephoned Trenchard in the middle of the night, and after hearing Trenchard's plan, insisted that Trenchard must under no circumstances order the security detachment to open fire on the mutineers. Trenchard replied that he was not seeking the G.O.C.'s approval, merely informing him of his intentions. After the security detachment arrived at the docks, Trenchard spoke to his men, explaining his plan and issuing them with extra ammunition, and ordering them to fix bayonets. The security detachment was then deployed to the open front of the huge customs shed where the mutinying soldiers were gathered. Trenchard ordered the detachment to load and make ready, he then ordered on the mutineers to surrender. In response a sergeant shouted obscenities. Trenchard's military policemen seized the sergeant, none of the sergeant's fellow mutineers resisting in the process. Trenchard re-issued his order for submission, and the crowd gave their assent. Trenchard spent the rest of the day hearing each man in turn. The majority were prepared to return to France and Trenchard granted such men a conditional discharge from charges of insurrection in military law that they were liable to. He also discovered that they were in fact going to be transported back to France. Those ring leaders who had been in the customs shed were confined aboard the troop ship. Some other ring leaders were holding out in nearby huts and Trenchard obtained firehoses and had the windows of the huts smashed. The remaining ring leaders were then drenched in ice-cold water and they surrendered, being detained aboard the troop ship.

Plot introduction The Wyrmling Horde is an epic fantasy novel set in a land where men can bestow to each other a number of endowments, granting the recipient of the endowment attributes such as increased strength, a more acute sense of hearing, or better eyesight. The novel combines traditional sword and sorcery elements of fantasy with its own unique magic system of endowments. Plot summary Vulgnash delivers Fallion to Lord Despair, who tortures human beings and then endows Fallion with a rune of compassion from each person, effectively transferring their pain to him. In a flashback it is revealed that when Yaleen shattered the world, all of the Bright Ones traced the rune of compassion on her cheek, punishing her. This pain eventually broke her, converting her into Lord Despair. However, Fallion refuses to break; to prevent him from using his flameweaving skills, Vulgnash keeps him nearly frozen. Meanwhile, the wyrmling, Cullossax, is charged with delivering an unruly wyrmling girl, Kirissa, to Vulgnash so he can feed on her soul, but instead he helps her to escape‚Äîeventually giving his life to stop her pursuers. Daylan Hammer takes the leaderless humans of Caer Luciare to the world of the Bright Ones for a brief respite, but it is more fraught with danger than they'd imagined. It is revealed that Daylan was banished for teaching rune lore to the inhabitants of shadow worlds. Despite this, the humans manage to forge an alliance with some of the Bright Ones, led by Erringale, after revealing that the True Tree and an Earth King are found on Fallion's shadow world. The Bright Ones warn them that killing another person damages your soul, no matter what your motive was for taking their life. Some of the humans begin taking endowments, including Talon and the Emir (who many fear will become a new Raj Ahten). Talon steals some sunstones from the Bright Ones' habitation. On the shadow world Rhianna flies to the Courts of Tide, seeking an alliance to prevent the wyrmlings from reaching a mountain of blood metal, but they attack her. So she seeks help, instead, from the horse sisters, who welcome her and grant her endowments, turning her into a runelord. The horse sisters capture Kirissa and learn from her where Fallion is being kept. On their way to rescue Fallion, the horse sisters take over Beldinook. Lord Despair also begins taking endowments, from his human prisoners, and must also grapple with the benevolent influence of the Earth Spirit. To spite the Earth Spirit, he chooses the most evil of his followers for the Earth; he also chooses Fallion so he can keep track of him. Despair also brings awful creatures, called the Thiss, from another world to help him in his conquest of all the shadow worlds. However, he is low on blood metal because the Fang Guards at Caer Luciare have Rhianna's rune staff and have decided to rebel against Lord Despair. Vulgnash is sent to subdue them, which he quickly and easily does. When Talon and the Emir return to their shadow world, the Emir begins to develop his abilities as a flameweaver. Erringale comes with him and he and the wizard Sisel set out in search of the True Tree; when they find it they are dismayed to see that it has been cursed and is dead. Talon and the Emir meet up with Rhianna and the horse sisters. Kirissa agrees to go back so that Rhianna can track her to where Fallion is being held. However, in their attack on the wyrmling stronghold they are tricked by Despair‚Äîthe Earth had warned him they were coming‚Äîand only Rhianna escapes. Determined to go back and rescue Fallion and the others, Rhianna realizes that she must evade Despair's Earth senses by not harming any of the wyrmlings he has chosen for the Earth. In this way she is able to re-enter the wyrmling keep, free her friends, and help them to escape. As soon as Despair realizes what has happened, he sends Vulgnash after them. The wizard Sisel confronts Vulgnash, but rather than destroy him he turns Vulgnash mortal. Nevertheless, Fallion realizes he's been chosen by Despair and so cannot truly escape‚ÄîDespair will always know where he is. So Fallion exchanges endowments of wit with the Emir, promising to teach him the rune for binding worlds, and then subjects himself to Vulgnash who takes him back to Despair. Despair opens a rift in the fabric of the world, letting in thousands of Darlking Glories.

It is located in the H√¥tel de Saint-Aignan in the Marais district in Paris. The museum conveys the rich history and culture of Jews in Europe and North Africa from the Middle Ages to the 20th century. Its fine collection of religious objects, archives, manuscripts, and works of art promotes the contributions of Jews to France and to the world, especially in the arts. The museum's impressive collections include works of art from Marc Chagall and Amedeo Modigliani. The museum has a bookshop selling books on Jewish art and history and Judaica, a media library with an online catalogue accessible to the public, and an auditorium which offers conferences, lectures, concerts, performances, and seminars. It also provides guided weekly visits in English during the tourist season (April to July) for individuals as well as students and teachers, and workshops for children, families, and adults.  History of the museum  In 1985 Claude-G√©rard Marcus, Victor Klagsbald, and Alain Erlande-Brandenburg launched a project to create a museum of Jewish art and history in Paris, backed by the City of Paris and the ministry of Culture, represented by Jack Lang, Minister of Culture. The project had two goals: first, to provide Paris with an ambitious museum dedicated to Judaism and second, to present national collections acquired from the reserves of the national museum of the Middle Ages. At the time, only a modest museum devoted to Judaism existed in Paris, on the rue des Saules. The project was led by Laurence Sigal starting in 1988. The mayor of Paris at the time, Jacques Chirac, provided the Hotel de Saint-Aignan in the Marais as a site for the future museum. The Mus√©e d‚Äôart et d‚Äôhistoire du Juda√Øsme finally opened in 1998. The decision to set up the museum in the Marais was a conscious one. Since the end of the 18th century, a large population of Jews has lived in the Marais. At first, these were immigrants from Eastern Europe, and later from North Africa during decolonization. Today, the Marais has been profoundly transformed: traditional shops have been largely replaced by trendy designer boutiques. However, the neighborhood is also a cultural center for museums such as the mus√©e Carnavalet, the mus√©e Picasso, and the M√©morial de la Shoah (Memorial for the Holocaust). The two architects in charge of redesigning the interior of the building, Catherine Bizouard and Francois Pin, not only crafted the areas for the permanent collections but also created a media library, an auditorium, a bookshop, and an area dedicated to educational workshops. The museum provides areas for temporary exhibitions, educational activities, and research, making it a dynamic and innovative cultural venue.  History of the collection  The museum's permanent collection was assembled from three main sources. The first is the Mus√©e d‚Äôart juif de Paris, whose collection was given to the mahJ. It consisted mainly of European religious objects, graphic works by Russian and German Jewish artists and artists from the School of Paris, and architectural models of European synagogues destroyed by the Nazis. The second source is the Mus√©e national du Moyen-Age in Paris, known as the mus√©e Cluny. This collection was built up by Isaac Strauss, a French Jew from the 19th century. He collected 149 religious objects during his travels throughout Europe, including furniture, ceremonial objects, and Hebrew manuscripts. A Holy Arch from Italy from the 15th century, wedding rings, and illuminated ketubbot (marriage contracts) are examples of artefacts in his collection. Strauss is regarded as the first collector of Jewish objects. Part of his collection was displayed during the 1878 Exposition Universelle, provoking a strong interest. After his death, his collection was acquired by Baroness Nathaniel de Rothschild in 1890. She then gave it to the State to be donated to the Mus√©e Cluny.Jarrasse, Dominique, Guide du patrimoine juif parisien, √©ditions Parigramme, 2003, pages 213-225 Sixty six rare medieval funeral steles, discovered in 1894 rue Pierre- Sarrazin, are on a long-term loan from the mus√©e Cluny. Finally, the third source is a set of long-term loans from museums such as le Centre Pompidou, the Mus√©e d'Orsay, the Mus√©e du Louvre, and the Mus√©e national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Oc√©anie. The museum's collection was also enriched by loans from the Consistory of Paris, the Jewish Museum in Prague and donations from the Fondation du Juda√Øsme fran√ßais. The museum also acquired a large photography collection. The collection has over 1500 photographs, mainly of Jewish communities from the past and present, of historical events, and of Jewish architectural heritage.  Missions  = Official missions= At its creation, the museum outlined five missions that it seeks to fulfill: #Present two thousand years of history of Jewish communities in France and contextualize them in the overall history of Judaism. #Conserve, study, diffuse, and promote the museum's collection, archives, and documents relating to Jewish history and art. #Make the collection as accessible as possible to a large public. #Organize the diffusion of all forms of artistic expressions relating to Jewish culture in all its diversity. #Create and execute educational operations, activities, and enterprises to promote Jewish culture. = Purposes = The mahJ chose a time period covering Jewish history from its beginnings in France until the birth of the State of Israel, without including the Holocaust. The project for the M√©morial de la Shoah, which is now located 800 yards from the museum, already existed when the mahJ was created, with the goal of commemorating the Holocaust. The mahJ and the Memorial complement each other. The museum explores Jewish history and identity without the memory of the Holocaust being the main element. The Holocaust is such a singular and momentous event that it can overshadow the rich heritage of Judaism outside of it, and deserves its own focused space.Interview with Paul Salmona, \\"Museum of Jewish art and history\\" (2016), Connaissance des arts, Special issue n¬∞708, Furthermore, the museum favors a historical approach to Judaism. The museum collection is organized in a chronological order and the works of art presented are always situated in their historical context. Differently from other European Jewish museums, the mahJ does not follow the phases of religious life. It is not a didactic presentation of the religious cycle in Judaism, and is neither a community nor a confessional museum, but instead shows the historical destiny of Jewish communities through time and space. The museum also explores fundamental questions about Judaism and Jewish identity. Is Judaism a religion, the history of a particular nation, a culture or a civilization? Is there a unity that transcends the diversity within Jewish communities? Finally, a considerable part of the museum's collection is made up of works of art from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 20th century. Thus the question: What is Jewish art? Is it liturgical or religious art; art depicting Jewish themes and ways of life; or is it enough if the artist is Jewish?Kelif, Fabienne, \\"Le mus√©e d'art et d'histoire du juda√Øsme: De l'origine √† l'aboutissement \\", Monographie de mus√©ologie, sous la direction de Krzysztof Pomian, Paris, Ecole du Louvre, 1999, p. 7-24  Key exhibits  = Marc Chagall, The Gates of the Cemetery = Chagall's representation of a Jewish cemetery is part of a rediscovering of Jewish heritage by artists of the beginning of the 20th century. Chagall had recently discovered his grandfather's tomb: this painting is in part a reaction to this event. The artist associated the themes of death and resurrection through a quote from the prophet Ezekiel: \\"I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people! And I will bring you back into the land of Israel.\\" (Ezekiel, 37:12)\\"Museum of Jewish art and history\\" (2016), Connaissance des arts, special issue n¬∞708, p. 56-57 Marc Chagall, The Gates of the Cemetery, Vitebsk, 1917, Oil on canvas, 87 x 68.5 cm, Gift of Ida Chagall, on a long- term loan from the Mus√©e National d‚Äôart Modern, Centre George Pompidou, Paris = Medieval gravestones = The remains of a Jewish cemetery in Paris from the 13th century were discovered in 1849. A large set of exceptional gravestones that were found are now displayed in the room dedicated to French Jewry in the Middle Ages. They serve as a testimony to Jewish presence in Paris during the Middle Ages, despite many persecutions. All the gravestones are engraved with Hebrew inscriptions and are thus historical documents of a Jewish community.\\"Museum of Jewish art and history\\" (2016), Connaissance des arts, special issue n¬∞708, p. 16-17 Medieval gravestones, Paris, 13th century, limestone, on a long-term loan from the Mus√©e national du Moyen-age, Paris = Sukkah = This remarkably well-preserved sukkah of exceptional quality from the 19th century was used for the festival of Sukkot, one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals. The panels are decorated with paintings of an Austrian village, the first few words of the Decalogue, and a view of Jerusalem.Museum Guide, Mus√©e d'art et d'histoire du judaisme, 2003, p. 66 Booth for the feast of Tabernacles, Sukkah, Austria or South Germany, late 19th century, painted pine, 220 x 285.5 cm = Ceremonial dress = The Kswa el Kbirah, also known as \\"berberisca\\", is a bridal dress typical of the big coastal cities of Western Morocco. It is made up of three parts: the skirt, the bodice, and the embroidered bolero. Its design demonstrates the Spanish heritage that influenced the making of the costume. In many Moroccan families, the ceremonial dress is handed down from mother to daughter. Many similar costumes were donated to the museum by Jewish Moroccan families living in France after decolonization.Museum Guide, Mus√©e d'art et d'histoire du judaisme, 2003, p. 90 Ceremonial dress, Kswa el Kbirah, Tetuan, Morocco, late 19th century, silk velvet, gold braid, and lining of printed pattern, 111 x 329 cm = Holy Ark = This piece from a synagogue in Modena, Italy, is the only Ashkenazi ark from the 15th century that has survived. Its structure and design are reminiscent of the shape of a fortified tower. A painted inscription reinforces this allegory: \\"The name of the Lord is a tower of strength where the righteous may seek refuge.\\"Museum Guide, Mus√©e d'art et d'histoire du judaisme, 2003, p. 37 It was probably made by the Italian artists Lorenzo and Cristoforo Canozzi. They excelled in the art of marquetry, which flourished during the Italian Renaissance. This Ark demonstrates the way Jews asked the most reputable artists of the time to execute synagogue furniture. (Proverbs, 30:10) Holy ark, Aron ha-Kodesh, Modena, 1472, Carved and inlaid wood, 265 x 130 x 78 cm, On long-term loan from the Mus√©e national du Moyen-Age, Paris  Permanent collection  Each room of the permanent collection brings together three dimensions: a historical perspective of a certain time, a theme in some area of Judaism, and a specific place.Kelif, Fabienne, \\"Le mus√©e d'art et d'histoire du juda√Øsme: De l'origine √† l'aboutissement \\", Monographie de mus√©ologie, sous la direction de Krzysztof Pomian, Paris, Ecole du Louvre, 1999, p. 33 The goal is to highlight the diversity and unity in rituals, beliefs, art, and material culture of Jewish communities in Europe and North Africa. The situation of Jews in France is original because both Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews coexist and the two traditions mingle. Alm box for the festival of Purim, Spain, 1319, carved stone, 13,2 x 12.5 cm = Introductory room = The visit begins with a presentation of symbolic objects and fundamental documents to show the permanence of Jewish identity and civilization in spite of- and through- the diaspora. = French Jews in the Middle Ages = French Jewry had a rich cultural life in the Middle Ages, as witnessed by the work of Jewish thinkers such as Rashi, a rabbi from the 11th century. In 1306, Philippe Le Bel made an edict expelling Jews from France, and in 1394 Charles VI banned them completely. The central exhibit of the room is a collection of gravestones from a 13th-century Jewish cemetery in Paris. These gravestones have exceptional value, as they are the largest archeological set ever discovered on French soil. At the far end, valuable manuscripts are displayed in a presentation counter. Four rare ritual objects dating from the period before the Jews' expulsion from France illustrate the depth of medieval Jewish life. The visitor sees how communities were organized, how knowledge was shared in networks, and how Jews were present in the Christian world. = The Jews in the Italian Renaissance = During the Renaissance up until the 19th century, Italy was not a unified country, so the life and presence of Jews was different in every region. This room shows the cultural splendor of certain cities, such as Modena and Venice. It is devoted to synagogue furnishings, including a rare Holy Ark from Modena in Italy, silverware, and liturgical embroideries from the Italian Jewish world. These beautiful objects show the refinement of Italian art in the Renaissance. Jewish life cycle events ‚Äì birth, circumcision, bar mitzvah, and marriage ‚Äì are illustrated by objects, jewelry, and manuscripts. Illuminated marriage contracts (ketubbot) are displayed in frames. Several paintings from the 18th century, attributed to Marco Marcuola, depict religious scenes from Jewish life in Venice. A 1720 masterpiece by Alessandro \\"il Lissandrino\\" Magnasco depicts a Jewish funeral in late-Baroque style. The painting is extremely expressive and tormented, but doesn't lack realism as certain details accurately represent Jewish customs. Magnasco was very interested in Jewish subjects, and especially depicted many synagogues in his work.

It includes a lovely series by Bernard Picart entitled Ceremonies and Religious Customs of all Peoples of the World and shows how Portuguese Jews integrated into the communities in Amsterdam, London, and Bordeaux after their expulsion in 1496/97. This area focuses on the importance of relationships between communities. Finally, a display case showcases the development of Hebrew printing through rare books which are printing press masterpieces. = Next year in Jerusalem = One of the museum's central pieces is a completely restored 19th century Sukkah from Austria decorated with places that matter in Judaism, such as the Old City in Jerusalem. Along with other ritual objects and texts, it depicts the Three Pilgrimage Festivals - Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot -, and highlights the central place that Jerusalem occupies in Jewish consciousness. = The Ashkenazi world = The Father, Marc Chagall (1911) Several scale models of synagogues from Eastern Europe, most of which were destroyed by the Nazis, remind us of a world that has now disappeared. A haunting painting entitled Jewish Cemetery (1892) by Samuel Hirszenberg depicts the difficult living conditions of Jewish communities in Poland and Russia caused by the pogroms at the end of the 19th century. Two paintings by Marc Chagall bring to life the existence of Jews in the shtetls. The display cases exhibit works around the theme of Shabbat, prayer, and liturgy. They provide a brief overview of religious study and movements of religious thought in the 19th century. In addition, an exceptional collection of mappot, linen sashes used to swaddle a baby boy when he is circumcised, is displayed. Mappot were exclusively used in Eastern France. Jewish Cemetery, Samuel Hirszenberg (1892) = The Sephardic world = Torah scroll, Ottoman Empire, 1860 The Sephardic collection touches on the same themes evoked in the Ashkenazi collection to show the kinship and contrasts between the two traditions. The geographical contrasts in religious customs among Sephardic Jews are highlighted through a variety of textiles, synagogue silverware, ordinary domestic objects, and popular art. The collection contains a wide range of ethnographic objects illustrating the wealth of traditions and family ceremonies and the opulent costumes of Jews of the Maghreb, the Ottoman Empire, and the Middle East. Orientalist paintings and engravings, as well as old photographs, complete this journey among the communities of the Diaspora.

This section offers a panorama of French Judaism in the 19th century. It focuses on important moments of the Jews‚Äô integration into modern society, including the creation of the consistories (1808) under the auspices of Napoleon Bonaparte which organized French Judaism, as well as the establishment of state secularism in 1905. These moments are illustrated by works depicting Jewish themes by French and European artists including Alphonse Levy, Edouard Brandon, Edouard Moyse, Samuel Hirszenberg, Maurycy Gottlieb, and Maurycy Minkovski. These works of art show that Jewish art is not simply liturgical or traditional. Jews were finally permitted to study at L‚ÄôEcole des Beaux-Arts and many Jewish artists from the time were interested in staying faithful to the traditions of the Beaux Arts. The social ascent of many Jews in France is illustrated by a number of portraits of prominent political, economic, and cultural figures, such as Rachel, Adolphe Cr√©mieux, and the Pereire brothers.Benbassa, Esther, The Jews of France. A History from Antiquity to the Present, Princeton University Press, translated by M.B. DeBevoise, 1997, p. 84-95 This section also includes items from the Fonds Dreyfus, an exceptional archive donated by the grandchildren of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. The Dreyfus affair was a major event of the end of the 19th century in France: a Jewish Captain of the French Army was accused of high treason and was only cleared years later. The museum's archive consists of more than three thousand manuscripts, letters, photographs, family heirlooms, and official documents.

A small section is dedicated to the creation of the state of Israel. =Jewish presence in 20th century art= This area contains works on paper and books from the beginning of the 20th century that highlight the Jewish cultural renaissance in Germany and Russia at the time. One of the missions of the museum is to deepen the public's knowledge of the major formal and stylistic directions of important and sometimes forgotten artists. These works focus on folklore, ornamental motifs, Biblical subjects, and calligraphy with Jewish theme. This section shows the contribution of Jewish artists to world art of the early 20th century. It features artists of the School of Paris, such as Amedeo Modigliani, Pascin, Chaim Soutine, Michel Kikoine, Jacques Lipschitz, and Chana Orloff. The diversity of their individual artistic developments and their confrontation with modernity show the transition of Jewish art into art that is no longer exclusively religious.Jarrasse, Dominique, Guide du patrimoine juif parisien, √©ditions Parigramme, 2003, p. 213-225 The museum acquired an archive collection of over a thousand documents related to the artist Jacques Lipschitz, including many photographs and manuscripts.

The museum offers a documented itinerary of the lives of twelve Jewish immigrants to Paris, illustrating Jewish life in the Marais, community organizations, and the last part of the life of these exterminated communities before deportation. To complete this presentation, the contemporary artist Christian Boltanski created a poignant installation placed in a small courtyard inside the museum made up of the names of the inhabitants, both Jews and non-Jews, of the Hotel Saint-Aignan on the eve of WWII. The installation reveals the history of the humble people who lived in the building before the war. The people of the H√¥tel de Saint-Aignan in 1939, Christian Boltanski (1998)  The Dreyfus affair  The museum created an online platform in 2006 dedicated to the Dreyfus affair, giving the public access to more than three thousand documents, letters, photographs, and historical archives, donated by Captain Dreyfus‚Äô grandchildren. These documents are all accessible on the webpage Fonds Dreyfus. The donations made by his grandchildren are the most important contributions to the historical collection of the museum since its creation. The museum has one of the largest collections of documents concerning the Dreyfus affair in France, including letters written by Alfred Dreyfus and his wife to each other, legal documents and photographs of his trial, writings by Dreyfus during his time in prison, and personal family photographs. The finest pieces of this exceptional archive are displayed in a dedicated area in the museum as part of the permanent collection. The museum's library has over three hundred publications related to the Dreyfus affair. An 8-foot tall reproduction of a statue of Alfred Dreyfus holding his broken sword, made by the French artist Louis ‚ÄòTIM‚Äô Mitelberg in 1986, stands in the center of the museum courtyard.

He helped Cardinal Richelieu and Cardinal Mazarin negotiate the treaties of Westphalia in 1648. The mansion was designed by the French king's architect Pierre Le Muet (1591-1669). The H√¥tel was bought by Paul de Beauvilliers, Duke of Saint-Aignan, in 1688. He began a campaign to refurbish and modernize the mansion. The second floor was turned into apartments and the gardener Andr√© Le N√¥tre redesigned the garden as a French formal garden. The H√¥tel de Saint-Aignan was confiscated by the French state in 1792 following the French Revolution. It became the headquarters of the seventh municipality of Paris in 1795, then of the seventh arrondissement until 1823. It was then divided into various commercial premises. Pictures from the early 20th c., especially those taken by Eug√®ne Atget and the Fr√®res Seeberger, show the life of Jewish artisans from Russia, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine who lived in the building. During the roundups of Jews of 1942 by the French Vichy government, several inhabitants of the building were arrested and deported. Thirteen Jewish inhabitants of the Hotel were murdered in the Nazi death camps. The H√¥tel de Saint-Aignan was bought by the City of Paris in 1962 and was classified as a historical monument in 1963. A first restoration campaign began in 1978 directed by Jean-Pierre Jouve, Chief Architect of the National Office of Historic Monuments and Sites. The second restoration campaign opened in 1991, directed by Bernard Fonquernie, also Chief Architect of the National Office of Historic Monuments and Sites. At the initiative of the mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac, the H√¥tel was chosen in 1986 for the installation of a museum dedicated to Jewish civilization: the Museum of Jewish Art and History. = Architecture = The mansion was built on a large irregular plot of land occupied by the townhouse Claude d‚ÄôAvaux inherited in 1642. Pierre Le Muet demolished the old building and followed the usual ground plan for large aristocratic mansions: the residence itself set back from the street with a large rectangular courtyard at the rear. The right wing's ground floor housed the kitchen, the servants‚Äô rooms, and the dining room. This area is now the museum's bookshop, where the public can admire a number of exceptional frescos discovered when the building was being restored. An archway led through to a second, smaller courtyard, where the outhouses and stables had their own street entrance. To create a sense of symmetry, Le Muet decorated the blank wall of the adjoining property on the left with pilasters and false windows imitating the right wing. This wall was a remain from a wall built under Philippe-Auguste at the end of the 12th century. Paul de Beauvilliers, Duke of Saint-Aignan, bought the mansion in 1688. He undertook a campaign to refurbish and modernize the building, extending the right wing with rooms on the garden side. He built a grand staircase and set up apartments in the old gallery on the second floor. The restorations made in the 20th century used the end of the 17th century as a reference period.  Status  The Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda√Øsme is as a non-profit organization. It is a public museum subsidized by the City of Paris and the ministry of Culture. Its board of directors is made up of five representatives from the ministry of Culture, five from the City of Paris, six from Jewish institutions; and four people chosen by the Fondation Pro mahJ.  The Foundation Pro mahJ  The Foundation Pro mahJ is a foundation created in 2003 whose purpose is to support the activities of the museum, especially to finance exhibitions and publications, as well as to enrich the collection. It was created at the initiative of Claire Maratier (1915-2013), the painter Michel Kiko√Øne's daughter. The foundation receives donations and legacies to financially support the museum. It regularly organizes special events for its donors. Every two years a prize Maratier is awarded to a contemporary artist.  Exhibitions and installations  The museum promotes contemporary Jewish art by organizing temporary exhibitions. For example, in November 2016, a temporary installation by contemporary Israeli artist Sigalit Landau called Miqlat (Shelter) was displayed in the museum's courtyard. The museum also presented two works by the Israeli artist Moshe Ninio: Glass(es) and Morgen. In the past, the museum has exhibited modern and contemporary artists such as Sophie Calle, Gotlib, Christan Boltanski, Michel Nedjar, and Micha Ullman.

He has composed several songs that are used in contemporary worship, by Christians today, including \\"All Heaven Declares\\", \\"By Your Side\\", \\"Restorer of My Soul (My Lips Shall Praise You)\\" and \\"You Laid Aside Your Majesty\\". Biography Noel Richards is Welsh. He was born in Llantrisant near Cardiff. When he was eight or nine years old, he became a Christian. He entered into a deeper sense of commitment to God at the age of fifteen, following which he began to look upon John Glass as a role model. John Glass was a young pastor who had just arrived at Richards' church from Bible college. Glass taught Richards to play the guitar, sing and to present himself. =Musical career= Glass introduced Richards to the contemporary Christian music of that time, in 1971. Richards attended his first Christian music concert at the Colston Hall, Bristol. The event called \\"It's Buzz\\" was hosted by Pete Meadows. One of the performers at the event was Graham Kendrick. While watching Kendrick perform at the event, Richards thought to himself that that was what he wanted to do. Following this event, Richards began singing at his own church. He also accompanied John Glass and other members of his own church when they set out on trips to other churches. On one of these trips, Glass introduced Richards to the man who was running the Youth for Christ operations in Bristol. This introduction became a turning point in Richards' life, as he became involved with evangelism before finally devoting his life to ministry. =Personal information= Richards has been married to his wife, Tricia since 1978. She has sung on many of his songs with him, complementing his vocals. They have two children together, Sam and Amy.

Under varying titles, it was one of the longest-lived formations of the Royal Navy. It was also often known as the Cape of Good Hope Station. History Admiralty House, Simonstown From 1750 to 1779 the Cape of Good Hope became strategically important due to the increasing competition between France and Great Britain for control of the seas. In 1780 Holland joined the American Revolutionary War in alliance with France and Spain against Great Britain; the British Government were aware of the consequences should the Cape of Good Hope fall and the impact it would have on its trade links with India and put a plan into place to capture the Cape and circumvent its use by the enemy. The first attempt was subject to prolonged delays and the fact that the French were able to reinforce their defences enabled them to successfully defend it from the British attack. From 1781 to 1791 various attempts were made to capture the station: all failed and it remained under the control of France and the French were successful in attacking and disrupting the trade cargo of the East India Company's ships that were travelling between Asian subcontinent and Europe. In 1792 hostilities temporarily ceased and by 1793 the Directors of the East India Company expressed their concern about the cape being retained by the French. The British government and the Admiralty decided to act and successfully retook it in 1795: the first Naval base was established at Table Bay. In 1802 the British government agreed to restore the Cape to the Dutch control but this was not finalized until 1803 and lasted until 1806, when a new British Administration under William Pitt cancelled the agreement between both countries and re-took the Cape once more in 1807, which effectively from this point on remained under British control. In 1811 the Royal Navy decided it wanted to move from its current base to a new base at Simon's Town bay; however the initial facilities took approximately three years to complete and were not ready until 1814. From 1815 to 1849 the base was mainly used for re- fitting and repair work on vessels and acted as a port of call for nautical surveyors who were mapping the region. During the 1850s and 1860s improvements were made to the dockyard facilities with some being re-built in order to accommodate larger ships. On 17 January 1865, it was combined with the East Indies Station to form the East Indies and Cape of Good Hope Station; however, the station was recreated as a separate station on 29 July 1867. From 1870, it absorbed the former West Africa Squadron.West Africa Squadron By the start of the Second Boer War in 1899 a long period of relative peace had existed; the station became the main base for British Forces disembarking and embarking during the war and for supplies and equipment being shipped from Britain for the duration of the conflict. In 1910 a new East Dock was built together with a dry dock facility which proved timely in the event of the breakout of the First World War. From 1914 to 1919 its primary tasks was to seek out and destroy German commerce raiders. During the interwar period it resumed the work of maintaining and refitting vessels stationed there and those travelling en route to Asia. In 1939, at the start of the Second World War, the base played an early prominent role in the Battle of the Atlantic, and the hunt for the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, that led to the Battle of the River Plate. After the conclusion of that engagement the station ceased as a command operations center with the senior naval staff moving to the newly formed South Atlantic station headquartered at Freetown. The naval base remained as part of that command until 1957. In 1958 the British government handed over the facility to the South African Navy.

Identification According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Carem has been identified by some scholars with Beit HaKerem (Bethhaccerem), a town that is mentioned in the biblical Book of Jeremiah and Book of Nehemiah . It is most often associated with Ein Karem, a town currently included in the municipality of Jerusalem. From the twelfth century CE onward there are many Christian writers who claim that Carem/Ein Karem was the \\"city of Judah\\" in the \\"hill country\\" mentioned in , the home of Zechariah and Elizabeth, parents of John the Baptist, where Elizabeth received the visit of her cousin, the Virgin Mary. The tradition thus identifies Ein Karem as the birthplace of John the Baptist. Many Christians cite the existence of manuscripts as evidence in favour of this tradition. However, early writers such as St. Jerome and later scholars like Baronius contradict this theory by citing the breadth of the term 'city of Judah' and the unlikelihood that it necessarily refers to this particular city.

It began operating in October 2007. The tram is operated by TUSSAM (Transportes Urbanos de Sevilla, Sociedad An√≥nima Municipal), which is a municipally owned corporation tasked with the operation of the bus and tram system of Seville. The tram has connections with the Seville Metro and Cercan√≠as Sevilla (commuter rail). Overview At the present time, the service consists of just five stops, Plaza Nueva, Archivo de Indias, Puerta de Jerez, Prado de San Sebasti√°n and San Bernardo, as part of Phase I of the project. The service is expected to be extended to Santa Justa AVE station, including four new stops: San Francisco Javier, Eduardo Dato, Luis de Morales and Santa Justa. This Phase II was due to start in late 2008, but was postponed until 2018. City council gave priority to extending the lines of the Seville Metro. The project works began in mid-2005 and its first phase was completed by Autumn 2007. It covers 1.4 km and is served by 7 Urbos trams, all of which were manufactured by the Spanish company Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles. Movement without catenary A tram passing the Cathedral in 2014 From the start it was envisaged that part of the Metrocentro system should be able to run free from using the overhead contact wire for power. The city had initially forecast that the catenaries would be removed from the area surrounding the cathedral by 2008. On several occasions the City of Seville administration had to dismantle the overhead wires to allow, at Easter, processions to pass without restriction; the builder of the rolling stock paid the extra cost for this. Initially, the system operated using the vehicles of the Seville Metro, which did not start operating until 2009. The final system, which is now in use since the Holy Week in 2011, uses a technology called ACR (Acumulador de Carga R√°pida), which are fast charging batteries that were developed and patented by the Spanish company CAF. Expansion plans The Seville city government announced in March 2018 that the tram line would be extended from its current terminus at San Bernardo station to the Santa Justa train station, facilitating transfers with high- speed AVE and other intercity lines. The extension would be tunneled for a short distance on Avenida de Ram√≥n y Cajal to Avenida San Francisco Javier and otherwise run in the median of the street. In total, four additional stops would be added to the line. The project is projected to cost 49 million euros with completion in 2020.

Playing career McGonigal was a striker with Stenhousemuir (playing only one game for the club as a 16-year-old), Falkirk (where his development was stalled by a badly broken arm), East Stirlingshire, Meadowbank Thistle, Cowdenbeath and East Fife. He was in the Meadowbank side that were runners-up to Hamilton Academical in the First Division in 1987‚Äì88, although he scored a hat-trick against the Accies in a 5‚Äì1 win earlier in that season. In 1990, he moved down to the Junior level, playing with Linlithgow Rose and Camelon, winning several trophies with the latter including the Scottish Junior Cup in 1995 plus a losing appearance in its final the following year. He retired from playing altogether aged 32 to concentrate on coaching and other interests. Managerial career As well as starting a business running a chain of Post Offices, McGonigal became assistant manager to George Fairley at Camelon then moved with him to Linlithgow Rose in 1999, becoming manager there himself soon after.

The temple complex is spread of of the Shivalik foothills in the village of Bilaspur, near Sector 13 (earlier known as Mani Majra) of Chandigarh, and Panchkula, 10 km from Chandi Mandir, another noted Devi shrine in the region, both just outside Chandigarh.Mansa Devi Contemporary Hinduism: ritual, culture, and practice, by Robin Rinehart. Publisher ABC-CLIO, 2004. . Page 83.Mansa Devi temple to get wall cover The Times of India, 18 June 2009. It is one of the prominent Shakti temples of North India involving 7 goddesses, namely Mata Mansa Devi, Naina Devi, Jawalamukhi, Chintpurni, Brajeshwari, Chamunda Devi and Jayanti Devi. Thousands of devotees visit the shrine from various parts of the country, and especially during the Navratra mela, this number rises to lakhs every day for the nine auspicious days.  History  There are 3 temples in the complex and main temple is the oldest. Maharaja Gopal Das Singh of Mani Majra, who was enthroned in 1783, constructed the present main temple of Shri Mansa Devi, which is situated on the Shivalik foothills in village Bilaspur, Tehsil and District Panchkula, during the period 1811‚Äì1815. At a distance of 200 meters from the main temple is the Patiala Shivalaya temple which was constructed by Karam Singh, a Jat Sikh, the then Maharaja of Patiala in the year 1840. This temple had the patronage of Manimajra Princely State.Haryana Samvad , Oct 2018, p39. There are 38 panels of wall paintings as well as floral designs painted on the ceiling and arches leading to the temple, which according to an inscription were painted by Anged in Vikram Samvat 1870 (813 CE).Haryana Gazateer, Revennue Dept of Haryana, Capter-V. After the merger of Princely states into PEPSU the Patronage of State Govt. ended and the temples remained neglected. The Raja of Manimajra then appointed pujari as ‚Äòkhidmatuzar‚Äô to serve this temple whose duty was to worship the deity of the temple. After the merger of princely State into PEPSU these pujaris became independent in the matter of controlling and managing the affairs of the temple and the land attached to the temple. They could neither maintain this temple nor provide necessary facilities to the visiting devotees and thus the condition of the temple deteriorated day by day. So much so that there were no proper arrangements for pilgrims visiting the temple during Navaratra melas. As a result, the Government of Haryana took over the temple and set up the Shri Mata Mansa Devi Shrine Board (SMMDSB) Panchkula trust to manage the temple. The complex was in awfully neglected condition till the establishment of the Board.  Temple management  The temple complex and its environment are presently looked after by Shri Mata Mansa Devi Shrine Board (SMMDSB) Panchkula which is a trust. In view of the popularity of the temple for its mythological and historical significance and also for fulfilling the wishes of the lakhs of devotees thronging to the complex, the Government of Haryana by an enactment (Haryana Act No. 14 of 1991) christened as Shri Mata Mansa Devi Shrine Act 1991 took over the control of this temple to provide for better infrastructure development, management, administration and governance of Shri Mata Mansa Devi Shrine and its endowments including lands and buildings attached to the Shrine. A Shrine Board with Chief Minister of Haryana as Chairman was constituted for running of the Temple and preserving the heritage of the region.  Navratra Melas  Main shrine of the temple.

Washington Park was the site of the first Lincoln- Douglas debates of 1858 and is surrounded by several historic structures. The park was platted in 1831 and the historic district was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Boundaries The boundaries of the Washington Park Historic District are limited to the area around Washington Park, known as Washington Square. On its north, the district is bounded by the east-west Lafayette Street, on the south by Jackson Street. The east side of the district is bounded by Columbus street, and the west side by LaSalle Street. The historic district includes seven separate properties as contributing members, there were originally eight but one has been demolished since the district was designated. History Washington Park was platted in 1831 and created by the Illinois-Michigan Canal Commission when the \\"states addition\\" of Ottawa was laid out. This was part of the original plat for the city. The park is probably most famous as the site of the first Lincoln- Douglas debate in 1858, but has served other civic functions through the years. In 1973 the park and surrounding area was designated a historic district by the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and several of the properties have local landmark designations as well. In 2002 a project to install Lincoln-Douglas debate statues was undertaken and completed. Washington Park Statues of Lincoln and Douglas near the site of their 1858 debate Washington Park occupies a square of one city block on the edge of downtown Ottawa and is surrounded by several significant historic structures. Within the park are objects and structures such as the 1873 Civil War Memorial, cannons from the Civil War, World War I and World War II, and a marker noting the site of the first Lincoln-Douglas debate. The park's central patio is dominated by a fountain and reflecting pool centered with larger- than-life depictions of Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas.\\"Attractions\\", Ottawa Visitors Bureau, official site, accessed May 12, 2008. The fountain and reflecting pools, and thus, the statues, are in a plaza which is surrounded by limestone. The statue project was completed by artist Rebecca Childers Caleel with metal casting completed by Art Casting of Illinois. The bronze statues were completed under the guidance of the city's historic preservation commission and dedicated on September 14, 2002. The Lincoln statue is tall and the Douglas statue is tall. Because of their recent installation, the statues are not part of the historic district. The park has been popular during the holiday season as well as being a major focus of civic life in Ottawa from the 1850s into the present. In addition to the historical features within and surrounding the park there are features more traditional to parks such as greenspace, benches, lighting and walkways. Plant life includes well-manicured lawns, shade trees, evergreens, and tea roses.

The central portion was built during the original construction period at a cost of nearly US$230,000. The building's wings were added on in 1877. The building is constructed of red brick and detailed in Joliet limestone. These features, coupled with the Classical elements give the structure an architectural harmony. Because of this harmony the Ottawa Community Art Council has deemed the Third District Appellate Courthouse, \\"one of Ottawa's most handsome public buildings\\". =Civil War Memorial= The Civil War Memorial in Washington Park is a marble memorial column erected in 1873.

He kept a detailed daily diary of his life in the west, especially while he lived in Tombstone, Arizona Territory from 1879 to 1887. He described life in Tombstone in detail, including his interaction with individuals who became famous such as Wyatt Earp and Ike Clanton.  Early life  Parsons was born in Washington, D.C., and raised to practice law in his father's law firm. However, he became disillusioned with that field of work, and for a time he worked as a salvager in Florida, salvaging shipwrecks, beginning around 1874. After a near death experience while working in Cape Sable, during a hurricane, Parsons decided to find another line of work, and moved to California, where he worked as a bank clerk for three years in Los Angeles, starting in 1876. He then began working for the National Gold Bank & Trust Co., but when the bank closed down in 1880 he found himself out of work.  Diary  He began keeping a diary in 1869 following the death of his mother, an event that profoundly affected him and which he noted on its anniversary every year. He wrote in the diary every day for sixty years, from 1869 to 1929.  Life in Tombstone  Parsons moved with his friend Milton Clapp to the boomtown of Tombstone, Arizona. He worked as a laborer at first in the mines and later partnered with J. L. Redfern as mining agents. He became acquainted with John Clum, who was mayor as well as editor of The Tombstone Epitaph. The events he witnessed in Tombstone made the diaries interesting to researchers. He became a member of the \\"Committee of Vigilance\\" and served on its leadership \\"Council of Ten.\\" Parsons was good friends with Wyatt Earp and John Clum. He knew lawmen Fred White, Virgil Earp, Johnny Behan, and Morgan Earp. He was also acquainted with men on the other side of the law, including Ike Clanton, \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius, Johnny Ringo and others of note. For the next seven years Parsons would keep daily records of his day, and detailed what happened leading up to, during, and after the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. During the Tombstone fire in June 1881, Parsons helped tear down a balcony to prevent the fire from spreading when he was struck by the falling wood. Parson's upper lip and nose were pierced by a splinter of wood, severely flattening and deforming his nose. Dr. George E. Goodfellow devised a wire framework and in a series of treatments and plastic surgery successfully restored Parson's nose to his pre-injury profile. He refused payment because Parsons had been hurt as he was assisting others. His diary gives valuable insight into the personalities and characters involved in those events. He also documented and described other notable events, including the grand opening of the Oriental Saloon, which later become famous in Old West history. He became friends with Reverend Endicott Peabody during his six months of residence in Tombstone during early 1882, and when Parsons learned the Reverend was a pretty good boxer, arranged a match between him and the Methodist minister, Joseph P. ‚ÄúMac‚Äù McIntyre. Endicott won. Parsons was, in 1885, the first librarian for the Tombstone Library, and in 1887 he left Tombstone, which by that time was on the decline.  Later life  Parsons moved to Los Angeles, California in 1887. He became director of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and served as president of the Los Angeles Mining and Stock Exchange. Portions of the diary was donated to the Arizona Pioneers Historical Society during the 1930s by Emma Parsons, his widow. Parsons stopped writing in his diary in 1929. Editor Carl Chafin later spent several years researching the diary, and later published the portions covering 1879 to 1887. Parsons died in Los Angeles, and was buried in \\"Evergreen Cemetery\\". His diaries are still published, most notably in the book A Tenderfoot in Tombstone, the Private Journal of George Whitwell Parsons: The Turbulent Years, 1880-82, authored by Lynn R. Bailey. Period account of his passing Even at the time of Parson's death, he was recognized for his place in history. The following account appeared on page 11 of The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, on 7 January 1933:Staff, \\"Desert Pioneer Is Dead in Los Angeles\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Saturday 7 January 1933, Volume 39, page 11. \\"Desert Pioneer Is Dead in Los Angeles \\"Known as 'the man who sign-posted the desert waterholes,' George Whitwell Parsons, pioneer, is dead in Los Angeles at the age of 82. \\"He was born in the District of Columbia, and came to the West by way of Panama and San Francisco in 1876.

During his term in office, Duby was a member of the Independents Group and the Hare-Clark Independent Party. Duby was the Minister for Finance and Urban Services and briefly was the Minister for Housing and Community Services in the Kaine ministry. For part of one day, he served as the Leader of the Opposition. Biography Born on 20 February 1949 in Brisbane, Queensland, Duby attended St Columban's College in . Prior to entering politics, Duby worked as a real estate manager and public servant in the ACT Administration. Duby was elected to the inaugural ACT Legislative Assembly in 1989 general election on a platform that was critical of the decision by the Australian Government to replace direct administration of the Territory with self- government. The anti-self-government movement carried significant popular weight; an advisory referendum held in 1978 concluded that only 30.5 per cent of electors were in favour of self-government; and Duby plus two other members of his No Self Government Party and a representative of the Abolish Self- Government Coalition were elected to the inaugural 17-member Assembly. However, once elected, reversal of the move to self-government proved impractical. Duby resigned from the No Self-Government Party, along with Carmel Maher and David Prowse, to form the Independents Group on 3 December 1989. Duby left the Independents Group to found the Hare-Clark Independent Party on 19 November 1991. Duby served as Minister for Finance and Urban Services in the first Kaine ministry. In 1989 and 1990, he was convicted of two offences of driving under the influence, during the period when he was the minister with responsibility for road safety. A censure motion was moved against Duby in the Assembly; resolved in the negative: As Minister for Finance and Urban Services one of his more notable achievements was the construction of a cover for the Canberra Olympic Swimming Pool permitting its year-round use, dubbed the \\"Duby dome\\". Commenting on the Duby dome in 1996, Liberal leader Gary Humphries said: In the last days of the Kaine ministry, Duby served as Minister for Housing and Community Services; and then, for part of one day, as Leader of the Opposition.

The story is set in the same world as Howl's Moving Castle and Castle in the Air. Summary Charmain Baker has led a respectable, and relaxing sheltered life. She has spent her days with her nose in a book, never learning how to do even the smallest household chores. When she suddenly ends up looking after the tiny cottage of her ill Great-Uncle William she seems happy for the adventure, but the easy task of house-sitting is complicated by the fact that Great-Uncle William is also the Royal Wizard Norland and his magical house bends space and time. Though she is supposed to clean up the mess William has left the house in, Charmain knows next to nothing about magic, and yet she seems to work it in the most unexpected way. The house's single door can lead to almost any place ‚Äì from other rooms like the kitchen, to faraway places like the Royal Palace, and even other time periods. In her first days in the magical house she ends up looking after a magical stray dog named Waif, encounters a horrible lubbock, has to share a roof with a confused young apprentice wizard named Peter, tries to work some spells from William's library, and deals with a clan of small blue creatures called Kobolds. When Charmain is caught up in an intense royal search to remedy the kingdom's financial troubles, she encounters Sophie Pendragon, her son Morgan, a beautiful child named Twinkle, and their fire demon Calcifer. One of the messes Twinkle gets Charmain into results in Twinkle climbing onto the roof of the Royal Mansion. She is soon involved in curing the kingdom of its ills and rediscovering the long-lost mystical Elfgift. Main characters ; Charmain Baker : She is a thin-faced, ginger-haired girl who is also known as \\"Miss Charming\\", most likely due to the similarity to her name, in her mid-teens. She grew up in a \\"respectable\\" family environment to be \\"respectable\\"; as a result, she does not know how to do much besides reading (e.g. she does not know how to use hot water to make tea), and has little interest in anything but reading books. Because she often is so focused on only one aspect of a situation, she can fail to see the larger picture. She has the abilities of a witch, inherited from her family on her father's side, who revealed to her that he uses magic in his cooking, but she was raised by her mother to think that magic was vulgar ‚Äì when angry, she can literally force anything to happen by yelling what she wants out loud, a technique which she herself admits to be rather crude. Charmain's ambition is to become a librarian and she becomes entangled in the mystery of the missing royal gold when she comes to aid the king in sorting out documents at the royal library. She is ultimately apprenticed to her uncle, along with Peter, to nurture her magical gifts. She and Peter begin with a difficult relationship that slowly gets better; she also befriends Howl (as \\"Twinkle\\"), Calcifer and Sophie. ; Peter Regis : He is a boy of about Charmain's age who arrives at Wizard Norland's house while she is looking after it, claiming that he is to be the Wizard's apprentice. Charmain confirms this by reading a letter that Peter wrote on Great-Uncle William's desk, which she had missed before his arrival, due to the fact that there were many letters containing the words \\"apprentice\\" and \\"hopeful\\", so she had assumed his letter was another one begging for an apprenticeship. For some reason he cannot ever get a spell right - though he does it perfectly, something bad always happens - and causes trouble left and right, which he cannot tell apart, and has to tie coloured strings to his thumbs to tell left from right. However, Peter is more experienced in practical household tasks than Charmain, though he has no idea how to cook. The two initially have trouble getting along because of Peter's confidence and Charmain's haughtiness, but they gradually start getting along better. His mother is Matilda, the Witch of Montalbino, and his father died in an avalanche. ; William Norland : The royal sorcerer of High Norland is sent away to be cared for by the elves when he falls sick (this is discovered to be caused by Lubbock eggs). It is arranged that Charmain, a distant relation, will take care of his house while he is away. Charmain knows him as Great-Uncle William and though he is not present in the house, he leaves magical instructions for Charmain if she has trouble managing things in the house. His voice is described as kindly and he is well respected by many, including the Wizard Howl. ; Sophie Pendragon : She was known as Sophie Hatter prior to her marriage. A lovely, powerful witch with red-gold hair from Ingary, Sophie is able to talk life into objects. She has a young son named Morgan and is married to the Wizard Howl. She takes on the task of trying to solve a mystery for the King of High Norland, but is dismayed when her husband decides to follow her to High Norland, bringing Calcifer and Morgan along in order to help her. She is reluctantly amused by her husband's antics as \\"Twinkle\\", and thoroughly annoyed at the extent of his enjoyment of his second childhood. ; Howl Pendragon : Known also as the Wizards Pendragon and Jenkins and one of the Royal Wizards of Ingary, Howl is a flamboyant, handsome and incredibly clever sorcerer of great magical ability, who is also Sophie's husband. He transforms himself into the ridiculously adorable lisping child, Twinkle, and claims that Sophie is his aunt in order to meddle with the mystery that only Sophie was supposed to be involved in, as the King cannot \\"poach\\" someone else's Royal Wizard into helping. Howl figures out where the king's lost gold was hidden and where the Elfgift is, with the aid of Sophie (who is reluctantly forced to keep his secret) and Charmain, in whom he recognises latent magical ability. ; Calcifer : He is a powerful multicolored fire demon, who was originally a falling star, that lives with Sophie and Howl and moves their castle. Because of his tremendous powers, he is able to perceive Charmain's inherent magical nature, much like he did with Sophie Hatter. He proves to be essential at thwarting the Lubbock's plans. Sophie also believes that he collaborated with Howl in giving no effort to stop Morgan crying, and therefore using him as an excuse to join Sophie on her task. ; Morgan Pendragon : Howl and Sophie's firstborn child is almost two, extremely noisy, and is rather mischievous with a slight problem pronouncing \\"T\\"s. When Sophie leaves for High Norland, she leaves Morgan in the care of Howl and Calcifer and is outraged by Howl's decision to follow her. Howl uses Morgan as an excuse to be \\"Twinkle\\", as they could not get him to stop crying for Sophie (though he later admits he did not even try.) When Howl transforms back, Morgan is glad to see his father again, but after a while whines for the lisping toddler, \\"Dinkle\\". He has inherited his parents' magic, as when he demanded toys in the palace and was refused them, he threw a tantrum and made toys appear from nowhere. ; Waif : She is a rare enchanted dog who befriends Charmain. Charmain realises that Waif most likely possessed magical powers throughout the book, and this is confirmed when the Witch of Montalbino tells Charmain that Waif has rare magical qualities. One such quality is that when Charmain first arrived, Waif was taken to be a male dog, but then she changed her gender to match Charmain's, the reason being that Waif was so fond of her. Great-Uncle William originally brought Waif to his house as a stray dog shortly before Charmain came to look after his house. Waif is more than meets the eye, and though small in size, she consumes large quantities of food, though this may be because she becomes pregnant, the father being the royal cook's dog (an event which Charmain only realises at the end of the book). ; King Adolphus X : The elderly and impoverished monarch of High Norland lives in the Royal Mansion. He has a daughter, Princess Hilda, and is a good friend of Great-Uncle William. He and Princess Hilda have been struggling to organize the books in the Royal Library in order to find the king's lost gold, but have had little progress. He is very fond of cakes and crumpets, and is good- humoured. He shows kind hospitality and patience to Charmain, who assumes that she is a commoner imposing on a royal, though impoverished, family. ; Princess Hilda : She is the elderly and unmarried Princess of High Norland and King Adolphus's daughter. She was one of the princesses kidnapped by the djinn Hasruel in Castle in the Air and responsible for bringing Abdullah's friend Jamal, accompanied by his dog, to be the royal family's cook. Since she is acquainted with Sophie, Hilda invites Sophie to High Norland to solve the mystery of the missing royal treasury. ; Lubbock : He is a horribly evil man- like creature with purple skin, wings, and the face of an insect. Lubbock can \\"lay\\" eggs inside creatures without them noticing. For males, the egg that hatches first consumes the other lubbock eggs and the male dies. For a female, the egg that hatches first consumes the other lubbock eggs and she gives birth as normal and then usually dies. The result of the birth from a human female is a lubbockin that looks mostly human except for purple eyes or purple tinted skin. The lubbock seen in the book wishes to rule High Norland by placing the lubbockin Ludovic on the throne and using him as a puppet king. External links * .

It was also called the 1920 Gansu earthquake because Ningxia was a part of Gansu Province when the earthquake occurred. Earthquake The earthquake hit at 19:05:53 Gansu-Sichuan time (12:05:53 UTC), reportedly 7.8 on the Richter magnitude scale, and was followed by a series of aftershocks for three years. Today's Chinese media claim the earthquake was of magnitude 8.5, although the seismic scale is not specified. It caused total destruction in the Lijunbu-Haiyuan-Ganyanchi area and was assigned the maximum intensity on the Mercalli intensity scale ‚Äì (XII Extreme). =Damage= Over 73,000 people were killed in Haiyuan County. A landslide buried the village of Sujiahe in Xiji County. More than 30,000 people were killed in Guyuan County. Nearly all the houses collapsed in the cities of Longde and Huining. Damage (VI‚ÄìX) occurred in seven provinces and regions, including the major cities of Lanzhou, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Xining and Yinchuan. It was felt from the Yellow Sea to Qinghai (Tsinghai) Province and from Nei Mongol (Inner Mongolia) south to central Sichuan Province. =Casualties= Total casualties were reported as 200,000 in a summary published by the United States Geological Survey, and 235,502 according to the Catalog of Damaging Earthquakes in the World (through 2008) maintained by the International Institute of Seismology and Earthquake Engineering. Many more perished because of cold: frequent aftershocks caused the survivors to fear building anything other than temporary shelters, and a severe winter killed many who had lived through the original earthquake.Close, Upton, and Elsie McCormick. \\"Where the Mountains Walked\\". National Geographic 41.5 (1922): 445‚Äì464: 451. Chinese seismologists published a revised estimate in 2010 of 273,400 deaths. The Sufi Jahriyya Muslim Hui leader Ma Yuanzhang and his son died in the earthquake when the roof of the Mosque they were in collapsed in Zhangjiachuan. =Ground effects= About 200 km (125 mi) of surface faulting was seen from Lijunbu through Ganyanchi to Jingtai. There were large numbers of landslides and ground cracks throughout the epicentral area. Some rivers were dammed, others changed course. Seiches from this earthquake were observed in two lakes and three fjords in western Norway. Aftermath The Muslim General Ma Fuxiang was involved in relief efforts in Lanzhou during the earthquake.

Pope Benedict XIV approved his \\"cultus\\" and beatified him on 7 July 1745. Life Sommola di pacifica coscienza, 1497 Pacificus Ramati was born in Novara in 1424. He was orphaned at some point in his childhood. Ramati decided to become a monk in the Order of Saint Benedict at their San Lorenzo convent but opted against it and decided to become a Franciscan. He entered the Order of Friars Minor - their Observants convent of San Nazario - in Novara in 1445. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1452 and then served as a preacher in which field the Observants of that time were quite prominent. Pacificus also had a share in the preaching of the crusade against the Turks that his order undertook. He had received a doctorate from the Sorbonne in Paris in the Kingdom of France. The General Chapter of the order held in Ferrara - on 15 May 1481 - sent him as a commissioner to Sardinia to administer and inspect the Franciscan monasteries in that area where he later died on 4 June 1482; Pope Sixtus IV reinforced the request for Pacificus to go there. According to his wish his remains were brought to Cerano and were buried in the church attached to the Franciscan convent. His head was given to the parish church of that place as a relic. =Beatification= Pope Benedict XIV - on 7 July 1745 - approved his \\"cultus\\" and therefore beatified him as a subsequent result of this recognition. Published works He is known as the author of a dissertation written in Italian and named after him as the Summa Pacifica which elaborates on the proper method of hearing confessions. It was first printed at Milan in 1479 under the title: \\"Somma Pacifica o sia Trattato della Scienza di confessare\\".

It was also designed for quickly turning any 80386 or later computer into a temporary, powerful Linux machine, along with system repair, education, forensic analysis and what the developer called proselytizing. In 2004 reviewer Paul Zimmer wrote, \\"Although there are several other single-floppy Linux distributions, none can match muLinux's extensive and unique combination of useful features.\\"Zimmer, Paul, muLinux: A Brief Introduction, The Linux Information Project, 2004, retrieved 16 August 2008 The last version update was in 2004, when further development of this \\"linux-on-a-floppy\\" distribution ended. Name The name muLinux comes from the Greek letter mu which is the SI symbol meaning one millionth, harking to the very small size of this OS.mulinux.sunsite.dk, muLinux official web page , retrieved 16 August 2008 Minimalist design muLinux was based on the Linux 2.0.36 kernel.Saunders, Mike, \\"Roundup: MiniDistros \\", Linux Format, July 2005, retrieved 16 August 2008 Development was frozen in 2004 at version 14r0, with some of the code and packages taken from software releases going back to 1998 (owing only to their smaller sizes). An experimental, unstable version called Lepton had the 2.4 kernel. muLinux could be both booted or installed to a hard drive on an obsolete machine from floppy disks. A highly functional UNIX-like, network- enabled server with a Unix shell could be had from but one floppy disk. Another floppy disk added workstation functionality and a legacy X Window VGA GUI came with a third floppy. One reviewer noted, \\"It's not gorgeous, but the whole X subsystem fits onto a single floppy. Egad.\\" muLinux could also be unpacked and installed by a self-executable archive, or extracted directly, onto an old DOS or Windows 9x (umsdos) partition without harming the current OS. If the machine had a floppy disk drive muLinux also would run on an otherwise diskless computer and no CD-ROM drive was needed. Owing to its minimalist design muLinux was a single-user OS, with all operations performed by the root user. It used the ext2 Linux native file system (rather than the slower Minix file system seen in other single-floppy takes on Linux). The OS was robust when used for text-based tasks along with basic file, light web page or email serving. It could also be adapted as a very tiny, stand-alone embedded system.ACM Indexed scientific database (abstract): \\"Linux Journal\\" Volume 2000, Issue 75es Using Linux in Embedded and Real-Time Systems, July 2000, retrieved 16 August 2008 muLinux was sometimes installed by Windows users who wanted to learn about the commands and configuration of a Unix-like operating system before taking the step of installing a full Linux distribution or BSD release, although on later computers this could easily be done with any one of many live CD distributions. Since the distribution was always wholly targeted at old hardware and meant to have a tiny footprint, Andreoli warned at the time that muLinux should not be used to evaluate Linux or open source software. The OS came with a lean and pithy online help system which also happened to be an introduction to UNIX, written in an English which the developer called \\"fractured.\\" The OS had \\"cheery dialogues\\" and a friendly sense of humour sprinkled throughout. System requirements muLinux needed only minimal hardware, hence it would run on many thoroughly obsolete but still-working computers. Some machines from the later 1980s or very early 1990s may have needed additional SIMMs for enough RAM but overall, the requirements were only slightly higher than those for Windows 3.1 so a still- working machine which when new in 1992 ran Windows 3.1 would likely be able to handle a hard drive installation of muLinux: * 4 MB RAM if run from a hard drive * 16 MB RAM if booted from floppies, can boot from floppy with only 8MB * about 20 MB of hard drive space * an Intel 80386 or later processor Packages muLinux came with many packages, each of which fit on one floppy. muLinux was somewhat unusual in that all of the packages were wholly optional. * SRV - basic server package with a web server, mail, samba and more * WKS - basic work station package with mutt, lynx, ssh, pgp and many other Unix shell applications * X11 - legacy X Window 16 colour VGA environment (see below for SVGA) along with early versions of both fvwm95 and Afterstep window managers (based on the Windows 95 and NeXTSTEP GUI respectively) * VNC - for virtual network computing * GCC - C compiler * TCL - Tcl/Tk+ scripting language, which also brings a few more X applications and tools * TEX - TeX typesetting system * PERL - Perl interpreter with modules * EMU - Wine and Dosemu emulators * JVM - Kaffe Java virtual machine * NS1 - SVGA X server along with part of a small but highly obsolete version of Netscape Navigator * NS2 - second part of Netscape Navigator Packages by other authors were also made available.

It is a member of a class of antiviral drugs known as protease inhibitors. Specifically, telaprevir inhibits the hepatitis C viral enzyme NS3/4A serine protease. Telaprevir is only indicated for use against hepatitis C genotype 1 viral infections and has not been proven to have an effect on or being safe when used for other genotypes of the virus. The standard therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is less effective than telaprevir in those with genotype 1. Clinical trials and approvals In a randomized controlled trial (PROVE3) of patients in whom standard treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin had failed, repeat treatment with the addition of telaprevir was more likely to have a sustained virological response (SVR) than repeat treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin alone. In patients who received peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for a year, the addition of telaprevir for 24 weeks achieved an SVR of 53% compared to 14% in patients who did not receive telaprevir. In that study, shorted treatment with only three months of telaprevir and six months of treatment peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin achieved an SVR of 51%. In a second randomized controlled trial (REALIZE) of patients who had previously relapsed or had only a partial response, rates of SVR were higher in patients treated with telaprevir (83% to 88%) compared to 24% in controls. In a third trial (ADVANCE) for previously untreated patients, patients taking telaprevir had a SVR (69% to 75%) versus 44% in the control group. On April 28, 2011, the FDA Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee voted 18‚Äì0 to recommend approval telaprevir for people with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. The committee reviewed clinical trial data (including findings from the phase-III ADVANCE, ILLUMINATE, and REALIZE studies) showing that combining telaprevir with pegylated interferon and ribavirin produced a higher cure rate--and in less time--than standard therapy alone. This improvement is most notable for hard- to-treat patients including those with HCV genotype 1, people with liver cirrhosis, and those who did not respond to a prior course of interferon-based therapy. Merck's boceprevir, also a new antihepatitis C drug, was given a positive recommendation by the same committee, on the previous day. Telaprevir was fully approved for use in the United States in May 2011. The hypothesis that host genetics play an essential role in the ability not only to clear acute hepatitis C infection, but also to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) to interferon-based therapy has been proved with the recent discovery of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 19. Variants in the minor allele rs8099917 and the proximate polymorphism rs12979860, 3 kb upstream of the interleukin (IL)-28B gene, which encodes the endogenous antiviral cytokine IFN-Œª, are associated with SVR and with natural viral clearance. The disparate frequencies of these alleles in ethnic groups worldwide may well explain differing rates of SVR among them. The test for one of these polymorphisms is now commercially available and can serve as a powerful predictor of a patient's chance of achieving SVR. Perhaps more importantly, the test can help the clinician personally tailor the duration and even the type of therapy most appropriate for an individual patient, newly or chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus. Adverse effects The most common adverse effect is rash. Grade 3 adverse events (mainly anemia and leukopenia/neutropenia) were more frequent in the telaprevir groups than in the control group (37% vs. 22%). After receiving reports of serious skin reactions, some fatal, in patients taking the hepatitis C drug Incivek (telaprevir) in combination with drugs peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (Incivek combination treatment), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has added a black box warning to the label of this Vertex Pharmaceutical Inc. product. 1 On December 19, 2012, Vertex announced it would add a boxed warning of possible side effects on the US labels of telaprevir, following \\"reports of a small number of fatal skin reactions in patients who continued to receive Incivek combination therapy after a serious skin reaction was identified.‚Äù The FDA reported two people had died from serious skin reactions caused by the Incivek combination treatment and a total of 112 patients had developed serious skin reactions of two different types.Staff, Boston.com. December 19, 2012. Vertex updates label of hepatitis C drug after reports of a ‚Äòsmall number of fatal skin reactions‚Äô Availability The cost of telaprevir-based triple therapy for hepatitis C is $189,000 per sustained viral response. On August 12, 2014, Vertex Pharmaceuticals announced that it would discontinue production of its brand of telaprevir, Incivek, due to falling demand for the drug caused by competition from newer hepatitis C treatments.

He is regarded as one of the greatest contemporary poets of the Arab world and was known for his defence of women's rights. Biography Zahawi was born on 18 June, 1863 in Baghdad. His father, of Iraqi Kurd origin, was the Mufti of Iraq and a member of the scholarly Baban clan; a powerful and prominent family in Kurdish Iraq. His mother was a Turkmen. His parents separated soon after the children were born and the children's mother returned to her family, taking her children with her. His father, who was partial to Jamil's intelligence and quick temper, decided to raise the boy himself. His father taught him poetry from a very young age and encouraged him to develop an inquisitive mind.Badawƒ´, M. M., A Critical Introduction to Modern Arabic Poetry, Cambridge University Press, 1975, p. 45; Na Na, Autobiography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East, Springer, 2016. pp 111-112 He was raised in Baghdad, where he was initially educated in kuttab (Q'ranic school). He did not receive a formal education; instead his father engaged private tutors to teach him science, rhetoric and grammar. He may have gained some formal education in jurisprudence, logic, astronomy and exegesis, although details are sketchy. However, it is clear that he was mostly self-taught, using books, especially translations of European works on science and philosophy. Through his father, he participated in Baghdad's literary society by attending majalis (social gatherings of the literary elite) for discussions of various topics. The informal nature of his education combined with his early exposure to debating societies, contributed to his love of debate and his inquisitive attitude.Na Na, Autobiography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East, Springer, 2016. pp 112-113 In 1896, he was invited to Istanbul. Between 1896 and 1898, he based himself in Istanbul but also travelled to Yemen on an Imperial decree, as part of a delegation to carry out reforms. In Istanbul, he was appointed Professor of Islamic Studies at the Malakki School and Professor of Arabic Literature at the University of Istanbul.Khoury D.R., \\"Looking for the Modern: A Biography of an Iraqi Modernist\\", in: Fay M.A. (ed), Auto/Biography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East, New York, Palgrave Macmillan, pp 109-124, DOI:10.1007/978-1-349-62114-9_8 During this period, he came into contact with the Turkish literary society and was exposed to those Turkish poets who were experimenting with modern poetry and seeking to liberate their work from the constraints of meter and rhyme. He also had the opportunity to read Arabic translations of works by Shakespeare and Western poetry. These encounters exposed him to new ideas about modern poetry and its role in political debate, and would subsequently inform his work in terms of both its form and the choice of subject matter.Moreh, S., Modern Arabic Poetry: 1800 - 1970; the Development of Its Forms and Themes Under the Influence of Western Literature, Brill, 1976, pp 136-137; Na Na, Autobiography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East, Springer, 2016. pp 117-118 He returned to Baghdad briefly, but he was exiled for his outspoken views, by the despotic Hamidi regime and forced to return to Istanbul in around 1908.Who's Who in Iraq, 1936, p. 587 In Istanbul, he worked for the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), also known as the Young Turks, where he met with prominent members of the Union movement. He became highly politicised by the relationships formed at this time and remained committed to social reform throughout his life. To this end, he regularly contributed regular articles to various publications in Iraq and in Istanbul.Moreh, S., Modern Arabic Poetry: 1800 - 1970; the Development of Its Forms and Themes Under the Influence of Western Literature, Brill, 1976, pp 136-137; Na Na, Autobiography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East, Springer, 2016. pp 117-118 Following his return to Baghdad, he held numerous government positions: as a member of the Baghdad Education Council, where he championed education for women and as an editor of the only newspaper in Baghdad, al- Zawra.Khoury D.R., \\"Looking for the Modern: A Biography of an Iraqi Modernist\\", in: Fay M.A. (ed), Auto/Biography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East, New York, Palgrave Macmillan, pp 109-124, DOI:10.1007/978-1-349-62114-9_8 He was appointed a Professor of law at Baghdad University, but his tenure was short-lived. A controversial article on women's emancipation which exhorted women to give up the veil and called for reforms to the existing divorce laws, caused a public outcry, resulting in his home being mobbed for an entire week. In order to appease the public, al-Zahawi was dismissed from his academic position in 1910. Following this incident, he fled Iraq and resided first in Egypt and later in Turkey.

He clung to his principles of simplicity in poetry and the avoidance of the artifice and false conceits that had preoccupied traditional poets. He also stressed the importance of poetry as a vehicle for social commentary. However, his work attracted literary criticism in the period following the first World War, when a wave of nationalism began to influence the arts. By this time, his forthright language and prose-like verse began to look unsophisticated and outdated. Moreover, his use of blank verse, which had always been experimental, began to look naive and clumsy. Although he lost favour with critics, he remained popular with the people because of his gifts as an orator and the accessibility of his writing.Na Na, Autobiography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East, Springer, 2016. pp 121-122 Towards the end of his life, he was largely ostracised by the new literary elite.Badawƒ´, M. M., A Critical Introduction to Modern Arabic Poetry, Cambridge University Press, 1975, pp 51-52 In the 1930s, because of his political views, he was also marginalized by the political establishment. He was embittered by the way he was treated and cast himself as the \\"misunderstood poet/philosopher with a perpetually wounded ego.\\" Khoury D.R., \\"Looking for the Modern: A Biography of an Iraqi Modernist\\", in: Fay M.A. (ed), Auto/Biography and the Construction of Identity and Community in the Middle East, New York, Palgrave Macmillan, pp 109-124, DOI:10.1007/978-1-349-62114-9_8 Work Al-Zahawi wrote poetry in Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Kurdish. Some of his works, such as The True Dawn in Refuting Those Who Deny the Seeking of Intercession and the Miracles of Saints (1905) have been translated into English, but he himself never learned any European language.Moreh, S., Modern Arabic Poetry: 1800 - 1970; the Development of Its Forms and Themes Under the Influence of Western Literature, Brill, 1976, p. 136 Egyptian writer Taha Hussein said of him: \\"Zahawi wasn't only the poet of Arabic language or the poet of Iraq, he was also the poet of Egypt and of other countries... he was a poet of the mind... the Ma'arri of this era... but he is the Ma'arri who connected to Europe and used knowledge as a weapon.\\" The English writer, Gertrude Bell was present at a dinner in 1921, when al-Zahawi read an ode to Faisal ibn Hussein. Bell writes:Gertrude Bell, Letters from Baghdad cited in: Muhanna, E., \\"What Gertrude Bell‚Äôs Letters Remind Us About the Founding of Iraq\\", The New Yorker, 14 June, 2017, Online: He was the first Kurdish poet to introduce sh'ir musal (blank verse; free of rhyme, no adherence to rhyme or composed of different rhyme) and was an enthusiastic proponent of the form arguing that it liberated poets to focus on expressing their ideas rather than being locked into searching for a rhyming word or phrase. His philosophy and style made him one of the early modern poets in the Arab world and he was lauded as such during the Ottoman era.Sperl, S., Classical Traditions and Modern Meanings, BRILL, 1996, p.11; Moreh, S., Modern Arabic Poetry: 1800 - 1970; the Development of Its Forms and Themes Under the Influence of Western Literature, Brill, 1976, pp 133-135 He also published a number of works on the subject of astronomy including: The Universe, Gravitation and its Explanation, General Repulsion and Natural and Astronomical Phenomena, which expounded theories which were ultimately shown to be fundamentally flawed.Who's Who in Iraq, 1936, p. 587 Selected works Al- Zahawi's most celebrated works include: Badawƒ´, M.

Julie got afraid of her husband and tried to persuade him to go into therapy. When his daughter marries Rodney Harrington, George was one of the few who supported it. They get involved in a car accident, and George blames Rodney for it. Betty suffers a miscarriage, but George persuades his daughter to lie about it. Leslie disapproved of Betty as his daughter-in-law. This was the cause for many clashes between him and George. At one point, George became bad at doing his job.

The group created a sound that spanned updated British Merseybeat and stripped-down punk-like rock to psychedelia. Inspired by the Beatles, Cream and 1960s California folk rock bands such as The Byrds, their guitar-based music had wide exposure during the early 1980s on non-commercial campus radio and new wave music stations. The group's stripped-down music and sometimes ironic and disturbing existentialist lyrics may have been a precursor to alternative rock. History The four- piece band was formed in Los Angeles in 1979 when singer/songwriter/guitarist Steve Barton linked up with Larry Dekker on bass and Dave Scheff on drums. A second singer/songwriter/guitarist, Robert Darlington, joined soon after and completed the lineup. The combination of 2 talented songwriters and a powerful energetic rhythm section became the key to their success. Translator then relocated to San Francisco where they were signed to Howie Klein's independent label, 415 Records, on the strength of the demo tape they sent to college radio station KUSF: the loose and rambling yet laconic \\"Everywhere That I'm Not\\" has remained the band's signature tune. The song was featured on Translator's debut album Heartbeats And Triggers, which was recorded with the widely respected producer David Kahne. As a result of 415 Records' national distribution arrangement with Columbia Records the debut album received strong promotion and became an underground and College radio hit in 1982. ‚ÄúI remember being on our first tour when we were playing at the Ritz (in New York) and thinking no one was gonna come,‚Äù recalled Barton. ‚ÄúAnd I remember coming around the corner and seeing this line going out the door and down the block and it was like ‚ÄòOh my God...we sold the place out!‚Äô. Between 1983 and 1986, the band completed three more albums for the same label. They received significant airplay for \\"Un-Alone\\", from the second album No Time Like Now (1983), once again produced by Kahne. For the third and fourth albums Translator worked with the Ramones' producer Ed Stasium. The self-titled third album Translator (1985) contained fan-favorites \\"Gravity\\", \\"O Lazarus\\" and \\"Fall Forever\\". The video for the LP's single, \\"Come With Me\\", was filmed on location in India. Their fourth album, Evening of The Harvest (1986), featured \\"Standing In Line\\" and \\"Stony Gates of Time.\\" Translator's music was featured on at least 3 different compilation albums during the 1980s and 1990s. In 2007 all four original albums were re-issued on CD by Wounded Bird Records with previously released bonus tracks. This series put their entire 1980s work on CD for the first time. Translator released a new album, Big Green Lawn, on April 17, 2012 through Redeye Distribution. The album is the band's first since 1986. In 1996, ten years after their official breakup, the band was paid its \\"highest compliment\\" when Beatles fans mistook their take of the instrumental \\"Cry for a Shadow\\" for a new recording by the Fab Four from the Anthology sessions; in fact it was a Translator B-side from 1983. In March 2015, Omnivore Recordings released a 22-song compilation of Translator's studio demos, spanning 1979‚Äì1985, titled Sometimes People Forget. The well- received album sparked a tour by the band, which included San Francisco, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Portland, and Seattle. Previous Translator reunion shows include the South By Southwest festival in Austin in 2006, and shows in Los Angeles and a sold out date at Slim's in San Francisco in September 2009. 2016 was a busy year for the band. They released four new recordings (three brand new songs, and a live cover of John Lennon's \\"Remember\\" from a 1982 show). These were all mastered at Abbey Road Studios by Sean Magee.  Solo careers and other projects  Steve Barton works as a solo recording artist. He recently completed his latest album, Before I Get Too Young, produced by Marvin Etzioni from Lone Justice and Willie Aron. The band for this album is made up of Dave Scheff on drums, Derrick Anderson on bass, Willie Aron on piano, organ and guitar, Marvin Etzion on guitar. Nelson Bragg plays percussion, and Pete Thomas from Elvis Costello's band plays drums on three of the songs. Also, he has two more brand new albums ready to go. All of these records will be available in 2017. Barton's other solo albums are The Boy Who Rode His Bike Around The World (1999), Charm Offensive (2004), Flicker Of Time (2007) and Projector (2012). In 2010, a 20-song CD on Spectra Records titled Gallery was released, featuring tracks from his three initial solo albums, plus four new songs with his solo band at the time, Steve Barton and the Oblivion Click, which included Barton, Robbie Rist, and Derrick Anderson. Dave Scheff has continued drumming, most recently with the orchestra at Teatro ZinZanni, on a 2008 summer UK tour with Dead Kennedys, and (together with Larry Dekker, guitarist Peter Wiley and keyboardist and singer Cynthia Haagens) in Bang Bang Men, and SF soul-pop group Half True. Robert Darlington released his first solo album, Prism, in 2012. He is also a published author, beginning with a collection of his poetry titled Ether. Larry Dekker continues to provide his powerful and melodic bass playing for various bands.

The Kollatt family are natives of Kadakkarapally, a coastal village, north-west of Cherthala town, in Kerala, South India. Contributions to Hortus Malabaricus Itty Achudan co-authored with the three Konkani BrahmanasAppu Bhat, Vinayaka Pandit and Ranga Bhatthe work of ethno-medical information titled Hortus Malabaricus. This 17th-century botanical treatise on the medicinal properties of flora in Malabar (present day Kerala) was compiled by the Dutch Governor of Malabar, Hendrik van Rheede, and published posthumously in Amsterdam between 1678 and 1693. The ethno-medical information presented in Hortus Malabaricus was extracted from palm-leaf manuscripts maintained by Achudan, who was introduced to van Rheede by Veera Kerala Varma the then ruler of the erstwhile state of Kochi. Volume 1 of the Hortus Malabaricus contains an original note by Achudan, dated 20 April 1675, in which he describes his contribution to the work. Achudan is credited with having dictated the material, in his native Malayalam language, which was then translated into Latin. Part of the botanical information was scrutinised by the three Brahmanas and compared to a Konkani textbook \\"Mahanikhandu\\" (meaning \\"the great lexicon\\") followed by a process of thorough verification, discussion with other scholars and general agreement certified and signed in Konkani language with Devanagari Sript . Kollatt family tradition Historically the head medical practitioner of the Kollatt family was known as Kollatt Vaidyan. When a Kollatt Vaidyan died, his practice and title was inherited by his eldest son. The Kollatt Vaidyans maintained a family medical chronicle consisting of several volumes of palm-leaf manuscripts in Malayalam Kolezhuthu script. In these manuscripts were recorded names of medicinal plants, methods of preparation and application of drugs and the illnesses for which they were used. The Kollat family chronicle is said to have served as a compendium of ethno-medical knowledge, updated and enriched from time to time by recording the experiences of the individual incumbent Kollat Vaidyan.

Manilal's work is also of historic and socio-cultural importance, as it brought insights into the life and times of Achudan and the Ezhavas of 17th century Malabar, information concerning the former being previously known only to the Kollat family. In 1996, Manilal also authored a separate book in the Malayalam language; the title which translates as A Study on the Role of Itty Achuden in the Compilation of Hortus Malabaricus.This book was the result of specific additional research undertaken with the objective of collecting factual evidence and clarifying various misconceptions, about the original Hortus Malabaricus, that had crept in through news media. It clarifies matters such as the number of pages per volume, the number of pictures, the publication date of the first volume, the publication date of the twelfth volume, and most importantly about the roles played by Achudan and others associated with assisting van Rheede with the compilation. Memorial Itty Achudan's Vilakku Maadam (lamp house) at the Kollatt house Although none of the Kollatt family members today practise ayurvedic medicine, the family house at Kadakkarapally still has an ancient vilakku-maadam (lamp house) maintained, over the centuries in honour of Itty Achudan. The family home also has remains of a grove (kaavu) which includes ancient trees and medicinal plants. Recognition During the 19th century, Carl Ludwig Blume named a genus of plants Achudemia in honour of Achudan. This has now been included under Pilea (Urticaceae). Over the last two decades, the Kollat family members have set up a socio-charitable trust in honour of Itty Achudan. The Government of Kerala announced that, in his honour, a portion of the Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute in Thiruvananthapuram would be set aside to introduce plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus.

It was designed by Stephen Broadbent. Origins and design The statue was commissioned in 2005 by The Liverpool Echo Newspaper and paid for by the people of Liverpool, to mark the life and work of Bishop David Sheppard and Archbishop Derek Worlock. The aim of the statue was to create a lasting memorial to the work of the two religious leaders whose presence towered over Liverpool during the dark days of the 1970s and 1980s. Despite coming from two different churches in a city which, over the years, has seen deep religious divisions, Bishop David and Archbishop Derek together, and working with other religious leaders, were a uniting force. Sculptor Stephen Broadbent won the commission with his design of two 15ft bronze ‚Äúdoors‚Äù decorated with symbols and newspaper headlines from the two men‚Äôs lives and ministry. Through the open doors the viewer can see both cathedrals signifying the unity the churchmen, affectionately dubbed ‚Äúfish and chips‚Äù as they were always together and never out of the papers, strove to achieve. Liverpool council has now accepted the statue as a gift to the city and people of Liverpool. written by Revd Phil Jump and Bishop Tom Williams Unveiling The church leaders of all the mainstream Christian denominations, led a procession of up to 3,000 Christians through Liverpool on Sunday 11 May on a Walk of Witness.

Formerly part of the Rockingham Estate laid out by the King family, it is open to the public. What remained of the estate was sold by Sir Cecil Stafford-King-Harman, 2nd Bt., to the Irish Land Commission, an Irish Government agency, in May 1959.John Clapison and Tr√≠ona Mullaney-Dignam, Rockingham: Memories of a vanished mansion (Third Edition), pps. 26-27. King House, Boyle, County Roscommon, 2013. The Land Commission officially took control of the estate in November 1959.John Clapison and Tr√≠ona Mullaney-Dignam, Rockingham: Memories of a vanished mansion (Third Edition), p. 26. King House, Boyle, County Roscommon, 2013. The part of the estate that later became Lough Key Forest Park was handed over by the Land Commission to the Forestry Commission a few years later. In 1988, the Forestry Commission became Coillte, a State company. Lough Key Forest Park has been owned and run by Coillte since that time. Rockingham House had burned down in a fire started by an electrical fault in 1957. The house had been designed by John Nash. After the ruins of the house were demolished in 1971, the Moylurg Viewing Tower was built on the site in 1973.Official site's history page The servant's tunnels still exist, with one entrance near the tower. The Forest Park has been in operation since 1972 and contains a visitor centre with a restaurant and a number of nature trails and walks including the tree canopy walk, which is a short elevated walkway through the tree canopy and opened in 2007. The forested section of the park contains a mix of non-native evergreen trees and native deciduous trees. In particular, a number of impressive large cedars are found within the park. The Forest Park also contains a number of attractions, some dating from the time the park was part of the Rockingham Estate, and others from when the park was developed in the 1970s. These include the Ice House, Gazebo, Ruined Church, Stables, Tunnels, the Bog Gardens, Wishing Chair, the Fairy Bridge, Drummans Bridge and the deer paddock. In addition, there are a number of short canals that are lined with walkways. Drummans Island was a peninsula that was formed into an island by the creation of a short canal and is connected to the remainder of the Park by Drummans Bridge. There are a number of wharves for pleasure cruising boats to moor at the Forest Park, as Lough Key is part of the Shannon Navigation system. The Forest Park is a popular destination for boaters on the Boyle River and wider Shannon system. The park also contains facilities for camping and caravans. In 2006-7, the Park was redeveloped with the demolition of the original 1970s shop and restaurant complex and its replacement with a new visitor centre. In addition, the Boda Borg adventure house was constructed, along with a children's outdoor playground. The controversial Moylurg Tower, a 'brutalist' concrete observation tower dating from the early 1970s, was refurbished and provided with a passenger lift. The tunnels were also refurbished and lit as part of the redevelopment. In the years succeeding the Park's redevelopment, a number of further attractions have been established on the grounds. 2011 saw the opening of \\"Zipit\\", a series of high-wire courses winding through the canopy of the forest. In 2014, \\"Woodland Segway\\"http://www.woodlandsegway.com and \\"Electric Bike Trails\\"http://www.electricbiketrails.com were set up. The former of these two neighbouring businesses provides guided Segway tours of the woods, while the latter permits rental of both electric and regular bicycles to Park visitors. Lough Key Forest Park is one of the biggest tourist attractions in County Roscommon and remains a popular location for day trips.

He is remembered primarily as a leader of the Baekje Revival Movement to restore the kingdom after the capital fell in 660 to the Silla‚ÄìTang alliance. Background The Gwisil clan was a collateral branch of the royal family descending from a younger son of the 26th king, Seong of Baekje. Boksin was therefore a distant cousin of Baekje's last recognized king, Uija of Baekje. His father was named Gwisil Jeongin (È¨ºÂÆ§Ë≤û‰ªÅ) and seems to be the first to take the name \\"Gwisil\\". His name is also romanized as \\"Kwisil Poksin\\" and in Japan his name is read \\"Kishitsu Fukushin\\". As a relative to the royal family he held the highest rank in court as a minister (Sahe, ‰ΩêÂπ≥). The earliest mention of him is on August 28, 627 when \\"Baekje Jeongeuro\\" (Î∞±Ï†úÏ†ÑÏúºÎ°ú) is dispatched as an envoy to the court of the Tang dynasty. At this time he held the rank of Dalsol (ÈÅîÁéá, 2nd court rank). Emperor Taizong of Tang dictated that Baekje and Goguryeo would stop their attacks on Silla but in February, 628 Baekje underwent a military coup and they attacked Silla, breaking the agreement. ÌïòÏ†ïÎØº (2015ÎÖÑ 7Ïõî 22Ïùº). ‚ÄúÌïúÍµ≠ÏóêÏÑ† ÏûäÌòÄÏßÑ Î∞±Ï†ú ÏôïÏ°±‚Ä¶ Êó•ÏÑú 1500ÎÖÑÍ∞Ñ Ï°∞ÏÉÅÏã† Ï∂îÎ™®‚Äù. ÎèôÏïÑÎã∑Ïª¥. 2015ÎÖÑ 10Ïõî 11ÏùºÏóê ÌôïÏù∏Ìï®. Fall of Baekje In 660, Baekje was attacked by the allied armies of Silla and Tang dynasty China. The capital, Sabi, was taken, but Boksin resisted near modern-day Yesan. After King Uija's surrender to Tang dynasty China, Boksin and the monk Dochim kindled a restoration movement. They sent for the prince Buyeo Pung, who had been living as a hostage in Yamato period Japan, an important Baekje ally. With some Japanese aid, they gathered the remnants of the Baekje army and launched a series of attacks on the Silla-Tang forces.Samguk Sagi, Scroll 28 Death Juryu Fortress today. In 663, Silla and Tang counterattacked, and besieged the restoration movement at a fortress known as Juryu Castle (Ï£ºÎ•òÏÑ±/Âë®ÁïôÂüé). At this point Boksin appears to have betrayed the restoration movement. He had Dochim killed and sought to slay Prince Pung as well. However, Pung killed him first, and fled to Goguryeo. The restoration movement was destroyed shortly thereafter at the Battle of Baekgang. Excerpt from Nihon Shoki: *\\"Vanguard shogun Kamitsukeno no Kimi Wakako took Silla‚Äôs twin castles in Sabikinue. The Baekje King Pungjang suspected Boksin of treachery, and so made holes in the palms of his hands and bound him with a leather cord. Then he asked the myriad ministers, ‚ÄúBoksin‚Äôs crime is this. Shall we behead him or no?‚Äù Then Tatsusotsu Deok Jipdeuk said, ‚ÄúThis evil betrayer cannot be released.‚Äù Then Boksin spat on Jipdeuk and said, ‚ÄúYou rotten dog.‚Äù The king ordered a strong man to behead Boksin and pickle his neck.\\"Nihon Shoki, Scroll 27 The location of Juryu Castle, at which Boksin's life came to an end, is now generally believed to be Ugeumam Mountain Fortress in Buan County, North Jeolla. Rites to propitiate the spirits of Boksin and Dochim are still held annually at the village of Eunsan-ri in Buyeo County, near the ancient Baekje capital. Legacy He had two sons, Gwisil Jipsin (È¨ºÂÆ§ÈõÜ‰ø°) and Gwisil Jipsa (È¨ºÂÆ§ÈõÜÊñØ) who both settled in Japan. Jipsa is recorded in the Nihon Shoki as coming to Japan in the eight year of Emperor Tenji (676) and became ancestor of several Japanese clans including the Kikuchi clan of Higo Province, Kyushu.Hong, Wontack.

He was the first head of the English College, Rome. He was born at Ll≈∑n or Eifionydd (present-day Gwynedd) circa 1525 and died at sea in 1581. Life He was educated at the University of Oxford, where he was admitted Bachelor of Canon Law in 1548. During the reign of Mary I of England he became almoner and secretary to Cardinal Pole, prebendary of York, rector of Orpington (Kent), and dean of Shoreham and Croydon, and chancellor of the prerogative court of Canterbury. In 1556 he was made rector of Corwen in the Diocese of St. Asaph, and on the death of the Bishop of Bangor in 1558 was nominated to the vacant see, but was never consecrated, owing to the change of religion under Elizabeth I of England. Surrendering all his preferments, he accompanied Thomas Goldwell, Bishop of St. Asaph, to Rome, where they resided in the English hospital, of which Clenock was camerarius in 1567. In 1578 he was made its warden. At the same time Pope Gregory XIII ordered the hospital to be converted into a college, until England should return to the Catholic Church. The warden was made the first rector of the college by the pope; but Cardinal Allen judged him unfit, though he described him as \\"an honest and friendly man and a great advancer of the students' and seminaries' cause\\" (Letter to Owen Lewis, 12 May 1579). Despite his personal good qualities he did not prove a competent ruler. He was accused of unduly favouring his fellow-countrymen at the expense of the English students, who numbered thirty- three as against seven Welsh students. Allen wrote, \\"Mischief and murder had like to have been committed in ipso collegio\\" (letter cited above). The students, having unsuccessfully appealed to the pope, left the college, and finally the pope, in April, 1579, appointed Father Alfonso Agazzari, S. J., rector, leaving Dr. Clenock still warden of the hospital. He retired, however, in 1580 to Rouen, where he took ship for Spain, but was lost at sea, drowned early in 1581 on a sea voyage to Spain. In contemporary documents he is frequently referred to as \\"Dr. Morrice\\". Works He was a friend and associate of Welsh Catholic priest and scholar Gruffydd Robert and spent time in exile with him in Milan where he published Athrawaeth Gristnogawl, a Welsh Catechism.Athrawaeth Gristnogawl, 1568, [by] Morys Clynnog, [and], A myrrhine posie, 1639, by Matthew Kellison; [and], An epistle of a Catholicke young gentlemen, 1623, by N.N.

Yogmaya is considered to be among the pioneer female poets in Nepal with her only published book of poems, the Sarwartha Yogbani (In Nepali: ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§• ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§µ‡§æ‡§£‡•Ä) considered to be her most notable contribution. Yogmaya's poems are set around the time when Nepal was ruled by the Rana regime and when India was ruled under the British raj. Her style, characterized by the cultural and political oppression of the time was distinctly original and courageously outspoken. Despite putting a significant focus on the Hindu religious context as a religious leader, her poems and activism themes heavily revolved on female and minority rights in the region, which appealed to a lot of people around the time. In her later years, her activities were heavily monitored by the government and her works were banned by the authorities under the command of the Rana rulers and despite the persecution of her group, she is notable for opting to remain in Nepal and spending her last days around her birthplace in Eastern Nepal. It is also regarded that Yogmaya founded the first organization of Nepali women, the Nari Samiti for women's rights in 1918, which was considered to be the main lobby behind the abolition of the Sati Pratha in Nepal in 1920. Yogmaya's activism begun after she declared renunciation and returned to Nepal. With the authorities increasingly harsh towards Yogmaya and her group of supporters, as well as, unwilling to reform their brutal and corrupt approach to governance, Yogmaya and her 67 disciples consciously committed the biggest mass suicide (Jal-Samadhi) in Nepali history by jumping into the Arun River in 1941. In January 2016, the Nepal Government issued a postage stamp recognizing her contributions.  Biography  = Early life and family (1867-1872) = Yogmaya was born into a Brahmin family in Majhuwabeshi, Nepaledada at 1867. She was born as the eldest child and the only daughter from her parents, father Shrilal Upadhyaya Neupane and mother Chandrakala Neupane, among three children. According to the prevalent Brahmin customs of the period, Yogmaya was married off by her parents to a boy named Manorath Koirala, when she was just 7 years old. However, throughout her stay with her in-laws, she had a hard time adjusting in the home because and it's believed that she was a victim of domestic violence. Around her mid-teen years, Yogmaya decided to flee from the abusive house and return to her maternal home. However, Yogmaya wasn't easily welcomed at home by her father and her community, and they instead insisted on her returning to her in-laws. But with the in-laws refusing to accept her back in their home, her father hesitatingly decided to let her stay at his house. There are two contrasting assumptions about the fate of Yogmaya's husband Manorath Koirala. The popularly narrated versions mention him dying at age 10 and Yogmaya consequently being a child widow, attributing her widowed status to be the reason behind her in-law's barrage of abuses. However, some modern literature around Yogmaya state that she was actually never a child widow and her husband instead married another woman after Yogmaya escaped the home. = Migration to Assam and re-marriage (1872-1917) = In her mid-teen years, despite being a single woman in the highly conservative and repressive Brahmin society of the time, Yogmaya secretly developed a relationship with a neighborhood Brahmin boy with the surname Kandel (name unidentified). As remarriage or widow marriage wasn't regarded positively in the Hindu society, Yogmaya decided to flee from her home at Bhojpur and she later married her lover at Assam. After over a decade of being together, its believed that Yogmaya separated from her second husband and left with her daughter. Some sources mention her second husband dying, while others mention the two actually separating in good terms. Some literature mention her marrying a third husband with the surname Dotel after the demise of her second husband. Historians have disputed about whether Yogmaya gave birth to two daughters or one, but the existence of Nainakala Neupane as her daughter has been recorded. = Renunciation and return to Nepal (1917) = After deciding that she had enough of marriages and the worldly ways, Yogmaya decided to adopt a life of renunciation and live the rest of her life as an ascetic. While it was fairly common for males to become ascetics in the Hindu society during the time, it was very rare for females being so. Yogmaya then returned to Nepal with her daughter Nainakala to her home village at Majhuwabesi and handed over daughter Nainakala to her brother Agnidhar Neupane and sister-in-law Ganga. She hence gave up all her responsibilities and fully assumed the life of an ascetic. It was during this period that Yogmaya began composing her religious poems. Analysis of her earlier themes has pointed out scholars to assume that Yogmaya was heavily influenced by the principles of reformist Hindu leader Dayananda Saraswati, who had gained immense popularity across India when Yogmaya resided in Assam. = Ascetic journey within Nepal (1917-1918) = Yogmaya later commenced her ascetic journey across different parts of Nepal. During her journey she came in contact with many renowned religious leaders, including Swargadwari Mahaprabhu Abhayananda Second, who was highly appreciative of her devotion and thus guided her with the Yogic spiritual education under the Joshmani saint tradition. After her journey, Yogmaya decided to vigorously practice her meditative Sadhana by returning to her home village. = Return to Majhuwabesi, popularity of activism and opposition of local feudal lords (1918-1930) = Yogmaya practiced some extremely difficult meditation techniques during her Sadhana, including meditating for days on end near fire during summers and then without thickly covered clothes inside cold caves during winters. Sometimes she would even meditate while fasting and only drinking water for several weeks. At other times, she would meet with people and her relatives to whom she would recite her poems. Unlike anything the people in Majhuwabesi had ever heard or known, her poems influenced many locals and her following steadily began to grow. One of her disciples, Bhim Bahadur Basnet later constructed a hut for Yogmaya and also compiled her poems and later published them from Sikkim. The tragedies and discrimination faced by Yogmaya in her pre-ascetic life heavily defined her outlook on the injustices present in the Nepali Hindu society. Despite being a follower and preacher of Hindu spiritual philosophy, she felt that the patriarchal society around the time was unfairly discriminatory towards women, lower caste groups and in the case of Nepal, towards the lower economic class as well. Her poems attempted to make the masses around Bhojpur aware of such underlying discrimination, which resonated with large number of locals. Following the publication of her poems, people from as far away as Darjeeling and Kathmandu began to become her disciples. Although Yogmaya's teachings easily influenced many underprivileged and politically isolated masses, many local feudalistic landlords belonging to the Basnet lineage, as well as, local people close to the central administrators in Kathmandu considered the ascetic and her followers a threat to their patriarchal privileges and vehemently started opposing her. Ultimately, her activism and popularity gained the attention of the administrators of the brutal Rana Regime as well. = Contact with the state (1930-1936) = Yogmaya believed that the administration had become extremely corrupt and had added to the misery of the common people by not adhering to the Dharma, despite propagating to the public that they adhered to the Hindu religious code. She also openly criticized the bureaucrats who were thriving from bribery and denying people even the basic rights through her poems. With a view to promote and preach her ideas as well convince the administrators in Kathmandu to change their discriminatory and corrupt policies Yogmaya sent one of her disciples Premnarayan Bhandari to Kathmandu in 1931, who later began to be known popularly by the masses in Kathmandu as Hareram Prabhu. The then Prime Minister of Nepal, Juddha Shumsher Rana also decided to meet Bhandari following which he gave a spoken assurance to adhere to the holy vow of truth and sent him to give the message to Yogmaya. However, the administrators didn't reform any of their brutal and corrupt techniques in the next four years. Dejected by the attitude of the rulers in Kathmandu, Yogmaya once again sent Bhandari to Kathmandu in 1936 and then later that year the leader herself came to Kathmandu with her daughter. She was welcomed by Juddha Shumsher during her visit there, where he reportedly asked what she wanted and in response Yogmaya replied 'the alms of the holy order of truth and justice' (in Nepali: ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§≠‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ). The prime minister gave her his assurance again, but didn't implement any concrete reform as her group had expected. Then, before leaving the Kathmandu Valley, Yogmaya handed a 24-point appeal to the prime minister detailing the reforms she and her followers wanted to see in the country. This alarmed Juddha Shumsher and his followers, who began seeing Yogmaya as a threat to their political establishment and so made special preparations to send her back to Bhojpur that year. = Dissatisfaction with the state and threat of mass suicide on pyre (1936-1939) = Dissent against Rana Regime had begun to increase in the late 1930s, primarily influenced by the Freedom Movement in India. As a response, the then government resorted to using more brutal techniques against dissidents. The reforms demanded by Yogmaya and her followers were repeatedly ignored by the state and the activities of her group was consistently being monitored. In 1935, Yogmaya began publicly opposing the corrupt and brutal administration. She declared that it was time to establish a new era by destroying the injustices, superstitions and corrupt practices that had taken hold of the Nepali society. She further declared that she didn't wish to be entangled in the changing era as she was already nearing salvation and she thus was soon willfully going to sacrifice herself in the name of god. In the pretext of Juddha Shumser not fulfilling his assurances, Yogmaya made a plan to sacrifice herself by sitting on a giant pyre along with 240 willful disciples in a ritual called the Agni Samadhi and thus commanded her followers to post a public appeal to the common people for any kind of alms they could give to her group by the Kartik Shukla Purnima. She also sent personal appeals for alms to Madhav Shumsher, the then head administrator of Dhankuta district and Juddha Shumser. With the administrators not paying heed to her appeal yet again, Yogmaya set the date for her sacrifice to November 12, 1938 and publicly began making preparations for the same. = Interference by the state and arrest of her followers (1939-1941) = Fearing a mass rebuttal if the mass sacrifice was allowed to happen, Juddha Shumser ordered the disruption of the event by deploying around 500 security personnel to the event venue on November 11, following which 11 male disciples were jailed at Dhankuta while most female participants of the disrupted agni samadhi ritual, including Yogmaya and Nainakala were kept in close arrest in the Radhakrishna Temple at Bhojpur. The administrators released the female members from detention after three months, while most of the male followers were released from jail three years later on April, 1941. = Mass Suicide (Jal Samadhi) (1941) = After the release of all her disciples Yogmaya decided to continue with her self-sacrificing plans, but this time she ordered to keep the plans an in-group secret. She set the new date of the event to July 5, 1941, which was the day of the holy Harisayani Ekadasi and personally allowed only a select group of disciples to join in with her. The religious ritual for the Jal Samadhi began on the night of July 4, 1941 and in the morning of July 5 at around 4AM, Yogmaya led the ritualistic mass suicide by climbing on a rock placing a plate with firelit oil lamps on her head at the banks of the raging Arun River. After Yogmaya, 65 of her disciples then jumped on the river in succession on that day and the next day 2 more of her disciples followed suit. Ultimately, the total death count from the event stood at 68.  Legacy  Sample of official stamp published by the Nepal Government for use in public domain in 2017. Actress Mithila Sharma playing the title role in the theater play 'Yogmaya' directed by Tanka Chaulagain, based on the 2018 Madan Purashkar winning novel of the same name written by novelist Neelam Karki Niharika which was screened at Shilpee Theatre, Kathmandu on 22/06/2019 Yogmaya and her daughter Nainakala were illiterate. Her poems were compiled and published by her literate disciples. In fact, the Yogbani is considered to be a small part of her poem collections, which she continued to compose until the year of her Jal Samadhi. News and materials on Yogmaya and the mass suicide were aggressively censored by the Rana Regime until they were overthrown in 1951. However, even during the first multi-party democracy era (1951-1960) and the Panchayat Era (1960-1990), mention about Yogmaya's activities were generally discouraged by the state. Yet, her disciples, who were scattered around Bhojpur, Khotang and Sankhuwasabha continued the tradition locally through the 1990s. Some of Yogmaya's disciples, mostly female, also lived in the Manakamana Temple in Tumlingtar. After travel restrictions for foreign visitors to Nepal were gradually lifted around the Panchayat Era, scholars from outside Nepal also began pursuing Yogmaya. After the 1980s, notable Western scholars, including Barbara Nimri Aziz and Michael Hutt researched and published their literary works based on Yogmaya. Topics on Yogmaya have been also included in the curriculum in specific Social Science based disciplines in different universities in Nepal including Sociology, Anthropology and Women's Studies. A local organization has also been formed in Bhojpur by relatives and locals of Yogmaya Neupane called the ‚ÄòYogamaya Shakti Pith Tapobhumi Bikash Tatha Vikas Sanstha‚Äô, to promote her work and activities as well as preserve the places where Yogmaya spent a significant time during her ascetic life around Nepaledada and Dingla. On November 16, 2016, the Nepal Government issued a postal stamp in recognition of her contributions to the history of Nepal. The Nepali novelist Neelam Karki Niharika was awarded the top prize in the 2018 edition of the Madan Puraskar for her biographical novel 'Yogmaya'. Nepal- based playwright Tanka Chaulagain later adopted the storyline of the book to create a theater play which was initially screened at Shilpee Theater in Kathmandu on June 2019.

The method is able to observe molecules in a distance of less than 100 to 0 nanometer from the surface even in presence of high concentrations of fluorescent species around. Using an aspheric lens for excitation of a sample with laser light, fluorescence emitted by the specimen is collected above the critical angle of total internal reflection selectively and directed by a parabolic optics onto a detector. The method was invented in 1998 in the laboratories of Stefan Seeger at University of Regensburg/Germany and later at University of Zurich/Switzerland. Polar plots of the direction of fluorescence (dipole) at the interface between water and glass  SAF microscopy principle  The principle how SAF Microscopy works is as follows: A fluorescent specimen does not emit fluorescence isotropically when it comes close to a surface, but approximately 70% of the fluorescence emitted is directed into the solid phase. Here, the main part enters the solid body above the critical angle.J. Enderlein, T. Ruckstuhl, S. Seeger: Highly Efficient Optical Detection of Surface-Generated Fluorescence. Appl. Opt. 38 (4) 724-32 (1999) When the emitter is located just 200 nm above the surface, fluorescent light entering the solid body above the critical angle is decreased dramatically. Hence, SAF Microscopy is ideally suited to discriminate between molecules and particles at or close to surfaces and all other specimen present in the bulk.T. Ruckstuhl, M. Rankl, S.

The lens focuses the laser beam in the sample, causing the particles to fluoresce. The fluorescent light then passes through a parabolic lens before reaching a detector, typically a photomultiplier tube or avalanche photodiode detector. It is also possible to arrange SAF elements as arrays, and image the output onto a CCD, allowing the detection of multiple analytes.

History Antique Indian purse, used by women. The oldest known purse was found with √ñtzi the Iceman who lived around 3,300 BC. Another early example is on Egyptian hieroglyphs, which show pouches worn around the waist. The purse- lid from the Sutton Hoo burial is a very elaborate, probably royal, metalwork cover for a (presumably) leather Anglo-Saxon purse of about 600 AD. In Europe they often showed social status based on the embroidery and quality of the bag. In the 15th century, both men and women wore purses. They were often finely embroidered or ornamented with gold. It was also customary for men to give their new brides purses embroidered with an illustration of a love story. In the 17th century, bags became more complex and elaborate. Girls were taught skills such as embroidery and needlework that could assist them in finding a husband. These skills gave rise to stitched artwork on bags. Around the year 1670, men's breeches were made with built-in pockets, which caused them to stop carrying purses. They did however carry little netted purses in their pocket to carry money. In 1974, the first appearance of the Hello Kitty character was printed on a coin purse.

Based upon a true story, the short 15-minute film relates the execution of a French woman who is condemned to death for killing her two children. It was the first dramatic movie made by a Danish filmmaker, and is notable as an early example of a dramatic film that referenced action outside the picture frame.. Elfelt used a typical stationary, one-shot camera position, but directed the actors to gesture and enter and exit with reference to things happening outside of the audience's view. This allowed for the development of the story beyond what was captured by camera, and expanded the dramatic scope of film. Known footage The only known copy of the film is incomplete, comprising only 25 meters of film, while the original length was 40 meters.Tybjerg, Casper, 100 √Örs Dansk Film, Rosinante, 2001, p. 18 According to later descriptions, the film showed a murderess seated inside a prison cell, then being ushered to her place of execution.

As they come through the gangway, a man in a top hat waits for them in the foreground. When they approach, he removes his hat and joins the guard in ushering the woman out of the picture.

Making his professional debut in 1979, he reached the top division in 1985. His highest rank was sekiwake and he won five special prizes in his top division career. He was one of the lightest wrestlers in the top division, and very popular with tournament crowds. In his later career he suffered from a number of injuries, particularly to his knee, and he retired in 1990 at the age of 29. He was the head coach of ≈ånomatsu stable and a director of the Japan Sumo Association until 2019 when he left for health reasons. Career In his youth he excelled at judo but was persuaded to give sumo a try by Oshiogawa Oyakata, the former ≈çzeki Daikirin. He entered sumo after his second year of high school, and fought his first match, under the name Tejima, at age 17 in the March tournament of 1979. In 1985 he entered the makuuchi ranks, having already taken the name Masurao. He won his first special prize in November 1986, and his first kinboshi in January 1987. The March tournament of 1987 saw Masurao ranked in the titled san'yaku ranks for the first time, at komusubi. In the first seven days he defeated two yokozuna (Chiyonofuji and Futahaguro) and four ≈çzeki (Hokuten'y≈´, future yokozuna ≈ånokuni, Asashio, and Wakashimazu). Despite these six victories over higher-ranked opponents, he began losing in the second week and ended the tournament with a 9‚Äì6 record. In the next basho in May he beat two more yokozuna (Chiyonofuji and, for the third time in a row, Futahaguro) and two more ≈çzeki and scored 10‚Äì5. He then advanced to sekiwake, the highest rank he attained. However he finished the July 1987 tournament with a 4‚Äì11 record and never made sanyaku again. In the following September tournament he injured his knee in a bout with Onokuni and was forced to withdraw, falling to the bottom of the division. In May 1988 he injured the knee again in a bout with another heavyweight, Konishiki, and ended up dropping out of that tournament too. His knee continued to trouble him for the rest of his career, and he was demoted to the second j≈´ry≈ç division on several occasions. He ended up winning the j≈´ry≈ç division championship five times, which is a record. Masurao retired from wrestling in July 1990 at the age of just 29. He left a record of 387 wins, 329 losses, missing 86 bouts. His career spanned eleven years and 68 tournaments, 20 in the makuuchi division, where his record was 111-125-64. He received several honors: the shukunsh≈ç twice, the kant≈çsh≈ç twice, and the gin≈çsh≈ç once. He was known as the \\"White Wolf,\\" after Chiyonofuji who was nicknamed \\"Wolf.\\" He has the fewest tournaments in the top division of any sekiwake since the introduction of the six tournaments per year system in 1958. Fighting style Masurao was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, favouring grappling and throwing rather than pushing techniques. His favourite grip on his opponent's mawashi was migi-yotsu, a left hand outside, right hand inside grip. Aside from yori- kiri, or force out, he also regularly used sukuinage, the scoop throw, and shitatenage, the underarm throw. After retirement After leaving the ring, Masurao remained in sumo. He became head of the ≈ånomatsu stable, which he founded in 1994. He produced five makuuchi wrestlers, Katayama, Wakak≈çy≈´, Daid≈ç, Am≈´ru and ≈ånosh≈ç. He was forced to leave the Nishonoseki ichimon or group of stables in January 2010 after declaring his support for Takanohana's unsanctioned bid to be elected to the board of directors of the Sumo Association. After Takanohana's group formed its own ichimon in 2014, he was selected as their candidate for director in the 2018 elections and won a seat on the board in February 2018. He was also the chief of the judging department. After the May 2019 tournament he was criticized by the chairman of the Yokozuna Deliberation Council for giving confusing explanations of the judges' conference to the audience after the Asanoyama-Sadanoumi match on Day 11 and the Asanoyama-Tochinoshin match on Day 13. He withdrew from judging duties for the next two tournaments, citing high blood pressure. On 26 September 2019 it was announced that he was leaving the Japan Sumo Association for health reasons, being replaced as head of the ≈ånomatsu stable by Otowayama Oyakata, the former maegashira Daid≈ç.

Modern scholars are nearly unanimous that the book was in fact written by someone other than Manethon, considering it a forgery written before the fifth century. Its contents are consequently regarded as being of little value to Egyptology, although a classic of pseudepigraphy.Adler, W., Berossus, Manetho, and 1 Enoch in the World Chronicle of Panodorus, The Harvard Theological Review, 1983 - Cambridge Univ Press. While the unknown author is considered to have displayed a thorough knowledge of Manethon, the best indication of forgery is the introductory dedication to Ptolemy II Philadelphus, referring to him as \\"œÉŒµŒ≤Œ±œÉœÑ·ø∑\\" (sebast≈çi) -- i.e. \\"august\\" or Augustus, a Roman title that was not used until centuries after Manethon's death. However, since the original text hasn't been found, all claims of pseudepigraphy rely on the assumption that Syncellus' transcription of the text was equal to the original text, ruling out that he might have gotten an adapted version or that he might have paraphrased himself. Indeed, the main argument against it seems to be its controversial content, with the purported inconsistencies being merely auxiliary to the argument. Syncellus states that Manethon included information from monuments in \\"the Siriadic land\\" (variously conjectured to be Assyria, Arabia or Egypt), that had been engraved before the Deluge, but afterward had been translated and stored in hieroglyphic books in Egyptian temples.

Merrie Melodies theatrical cartoon directed by Chuck Jones and written by Tedd Pierce. The short was released on October 1, 1955, and stars Bugs Bunny.  Plot  Loosely based on Mark Twain's 1889 novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, the cartoon begins with Bugs Bunny, who is reading a book on the Knights of the Round Table under a hairdryer. While reading, an apple falls and hits his head and he is somehow transported to the time of King Arthur. When he wakes up, he finds himself at the pointy end of a knight's lance. Bugs asks him: \\"What's up, Duke?\\" and the knight commands Bugs to surrender as a prisoner of his lance. The knight identifies himself as \\"Sir O of Kay, Earl of Watercress, Sir Osis of The Liver, Knight of the Garter, and Baron of Worcestershire.\\" Ready to take Bugs' challenge to tilt with him for the insult of Bugs' friends, the Duke of Ellington, Count of Basie, Earl of Hines, Cab of Calloway and Satchmo of Armstrong who the knight never heard of and called them \\"upstarts and rogues\\", the knight offers Bugs a too heavy sword, then begins to charge at him, during several comedic attempts by Bugs to get the sword off the ground. At the last second, Bugs puts his leg out tripping the knight's horse. The horse falls and the knight pole vaults on his lance over the castle wall and into a high window of a castle tower, falling loudly to the bottom inside the tower. Bugs is later chased by a fire-breathing dinosaur-type dragon. He manages to defeat him by spraying seltzer into his mouth. With his fire lost, the powerless dragon whimpers and flees. Bugs later goes to another castle, the residence of a warlock (or wizard) named Merlin of Monroe. Merlin changes Bugs into a pig with some \\"magic powder\\", but as Merlin laughs, Bugs simply unzips the \\"costume\\" into his normal self. He later tricks the warlock (or wizard) into becoming a horse. Merlin tries hard to change himself back to normal by also \\"unzipping\\", but only ends up with the same horse appearance, then continues to keep unzipping the same costume no matter how many times he unzips the costume until he fails. To try to return to the present, Bugs Bunny throws an apple in the air to hit him on the head (\\"Well, why not? After all, they've laughed at the man when he discovered penicillin\\"); he is successful in this attempt. Walking down the country road, he approaches a farmer tending to a horse who looks exactly like the one he turned Merlin into. He walks on by, convincing himself that it is not the same horse, proclaiming \\"Nah, that's silly. Couldn't be him\\", then is shocked upon hearing the farmer say, \\"Come along, Merlin, giddy up, get along now\\" ending the cartoon.

He made eleven appearances in the Football League for Watford, Lincoln City and Plymouth Argyle, before retiring due to injury in 1999. Early life Flash was born in Birmingham. As a schoolboy he was scouted by Liverpool, Arsenal, Aston Villa and Manchester United; Manchester United scout Geoff Watson persuaded him to sign schoolboy forms, and he went on to captain United's West Midland youth team, the Manchester Eagles, for three years, winning the Keele Classic at under-14 level. In 1990, he turned down the opportunity to move to the F.A's National School of Excellence at Lilleshall to train locally with Aston Villa and Birmingham City, in addition to Manchester United. However, an injury to his right knee at age 14 hampered his development. Youth career In 1992, he joined the ranks at Manchester United with Michael Appleton, Terry Cooke, David Johnson and Jovan Kirovski. During his seven-year club career, he played at youth team and reserve level. However, another knee injury sustained early in his Manchester United career, this time a dislocated right patella, forced him onto the sidelines for two years. Senior career In 1995 Flash was signed by Graham Taylor and moved to reserve team level at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Graham Taylor re-signed him at Watford, where he made his senior debut as a substitute on 5 May 1997, but this was his only appearance for the club. After a brief spell on loan at Lincoln City he was injured again and sidelined for 6 months.

He and his brother Tom owned a ranch outside Tombstone, Arizona, Arizona Territory during the 1880s, and had ongoing conflicts with lawmen Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan Earp. The McLaury brothers repeatedly threatened the Earps because they interfered with the Cowboys' illegal activities. On October 26, 1881, Tom, Frank, and Billy Clanton were killed in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.  Early life  Frank (born Robert Findley McLaury and known as \\"Rob\\" when younger) was born in Kortright, New York. He was one of eleven children born to Margaret Rowland and Robert Houston McLaury, a descendant of Matthew McClaughry of Ireland and his son Thomas McClaughry of Kortright, New York. The McLaury family worked a farm in Merideth, Delaware County, New York. The father Robert moved the family to a new farm near Belle Plaine in Benton County, Iowa, in 1855, where Robert also practiced law. His mother Margaret died when an epidemic of typhoid swept through their community on October 11, 1859 when Frank was 9. Franks' father Robert was 65 years old in August 1875. By that time he had lived as a widower for over 15 years. He was the father of 11 children, six of them sons. But by 1875, two of his sons had already died. His father remarried widow and neighbor Jane Arbuthnot on September 13, 1860. Eight of his siblings including Frank were still living at home, as were eight of Jane's children. Frank's older brother Edwin McLaury joined the 14th Iowa Volunteers, which saw action at the battle of Fort Donelson and Pittsburgh Landing (Shiloh). Edwin was captured and imprisoned at Macon, Georgia, and after he was paroled he came home but died in October 1862 from the effects of starvation and disease. Another brother, Will, was still serving in the Union Army and could not attend Edwins' funeral. After the war, the McLaury family moved north to Buchanan County, Iowa, to farm land in an unincorporated portion outside Hazelton Township known as Buffalo. Tom and Frank helped their father work the farm. By 1859, only Frank (known as \\"Rob\\" within the family because his name, like his father's, was Robert), Christiana (known as \\"Anna\\"), Tom and Sarah Caroline, the youngest of the clan, who they called Carrie, were living on their father's farm. In 1872, the elder McLaury, aged 65, remarried 35-year- old widow Anna Lavina (Miller) Leigh; she was two years younger than Frank. Only Frank, Tom and Carrie remained at home. She had five children from two 13 years old. By 1875, the youngest daughter of Robert and Margaret, Anna, married and moved away, and by this time two of her brothers had died. Frank had 13 siblings and half-siblings. Frank and his brother Tom left Iowa in 1878 for Fort Worth, Texas. Their older brother Will had completed college and moved with his family to Fort Worth where he opened a law practice. Around the time he was in Fort Worth, Robert Findley stopped using his given name and began going by Frank, a modern derivative of his middle name, Findley. Will later became a judge in Fort Worth, and both Frank and his younger brother Tom McLaury studied pre-law. In 1878, Frank and Tom may have joined a cattle drive working for either John Slaughter or John Chisum and they moved to Hereford, Arizona, where they got a job working for Old Man Clanton. The Clanton family owned one of the largest cattle operations in Arizona. When Old Man Clanton sold his ranch to purchase another holding along the San Pedro River in southern Arizona, Ike Clanton remained behind. The McLaury brothers and Ike became fast friends.  Move to Arizona  By 1879 the two brothers were experiencing some success in their cattle business, and they purchased land and built a house at Soldiers Hole along the Babocomari creek, a tributary of the San Pedro River. Another account says they never held title to the land, but that it was owned by Frank Patterson. Nearby Tombstone, Arizona, was just beginning to see its population explode due to the silver rush. Frank briefly assisted local constable Melvin Jones in apprehending soldiers who had stolen government horse harnesses. The soldiers attempted to bribe the two men but McLaury and Jones both insisted they submit to arrest. Sometime after their arrival in the San Pedro River valley they met \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius. On October 27, 1880, the two brothers were with Brocius when he accidentally shot and killed Tombstone Marshal Fred White. The two men were briefly detained. Before he died, White stated that the shooting was accidental and Brocius was released. = Livestock theft = The McLaury brothers were suspected of stealing cattle from Sonora, Mexico and re-selling them to Old Man Clanton and local butchers. On July 25, 1880, Captain Joseph H. Hurst requested the assistance of Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, who brought Wyatt and Morgan Earp, as well as Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams, to track the thieves of six U.S. Army mules stolen from Camp Rucker. This was a federal matter because the animals were U.S. property. Acting on a tip, they found the animals on the McLaury's Ranch on the Babacomari River and the branding iron used to change the \\"US\\" brand to \\"D8\\". To avoid bloodshed, Cowboy Frank Patterson promised to return the mules and Hurst pressed the posse to withdraw. The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Captain Hurst and the Earps. Hurst responded by printing and distributing a handbill describing the theft and promising a reward for the \\"trial and conviction\\" of the thieves. It said, \\"It is known that the stolen animals were secreted at or in the vicinity of the McLaury Brothers ranch, and it is also believed that they were branded on the left shoulder over the Government brand. \\" Hurst specifically charged Frank McLaury with assisting with hiding the mules. It was reprinted in The Tombstone Epitaph on July 30, 1880. Frank McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly Nuggett, calling Hurst \\"unmanly, \\" \\"a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar, \\" accusing Hurst of stealing the mules himself. Virgil reported that Frank accosted him and warned him \\"If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then you will have to fight anyway.\\" = Tensions with the Earps = In November 1879, shortly after arriving in Tombstone, a prize horse of Wyatt Earp's was stolen. More than a year later, he learned the horse had been seen in Charleston and was in the possession of Ike Clanton and his brother Billy. Earp and Doc Holliday rode to the Clanton ranch near Charleston to recover the horse. On the way, they overtook Sheriff Johnny Behan, who was riding in a wagon. Behan was also heading to the ranch to serve an election-hearing subpoena on Ike Clanton. According to Wyatt's testimony later, 18-year-old Billy Clanton asked him insolently if he had any more horses to \\"lose\\", but he gave the horse up without first being shown the ownership papers, demonstrating to Wyatt that Billy knew to whom the horse belonged. = Move to Sulphur Springs = Early in 1881, shortly after Cochise County was created, Tom and Frank moved their ranching operations to the Sulphur Springs Valley. They dug a well and built a substantial adobe ranch house, a barn, corrals, and irrigation ditches for farming. They owned eight horses, two mules, and 140 cattle. They began planning a visit to their sister Sarah Caroline McLaury in Iowa, who was set to be married on November 30.  Shootout at the O.K. Corral  Graves of Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury in Boothill Cemetery, Tombstone, Arizona. On October 26, 1881, the McLaury brothers were in Tombstone to conclude a cattle deal. Tensions between the Earps and Cowboys had escalated. Ike Clanton had been cited earlier in the day for carrying a weapon in town, after which Tom McLaury had arrived to get Ike. Wyatt Earp and McLaury had a heated exchange. and Wyatt later testified he saw a pistol in Tom's waistband and buffaloed Tom. Later in the day the Clantons and McLaurys, along with Billy Claiborne, faced off against the Earps and Doc Holiday in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Some witnesses testified that Frank and Billy Clanton drew their weapons first, while others loyal to the Cowboys supported their version of events in which Tom opened his coat to show he was unarmed. The Earps and Holiday killed Frank and Tom McLaury along with Billy Clanton. All three were buried in Tombstone's Boot Hill cemetery. Their brother William McLaury spent most of his finances in pursuing charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday. Tom left his pistol at a nearby saloon at some point that afternoon, but the Earps had no way of knowing that. Tom McLaury had $3,000 in his possession when he died during the shootout, a fact that the prosecution emphasized during the preliminary hearing that followed the shoot out. His brother William, who joined the prosecution team, wrote in a letter home to Texas that his brothers had just sold their herd of cattle and were leaving Tombstone shortly to come be with him in Fort Worth. He said that they were in Tombstone on business, with plans to depart shortly afterward to visit him in Texas. They may have been arranging a cattle deal with their neighbor E. B Frink with butchers Bauer & Kehoe. Although modern historians have called him a gunfighter, others say he was not. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral is believed to have been his only violent confrontation.

Blakes is also an advisory member of TechLaw Group, Inc. Since 2009, the Chair of Blakes is Brock Gibson, and Bryson Stokes is the new Firm Managing Partner.  History  Blakes was launched in 1856 after Dominick Edward Blake was called to the bar and entered into partnership with Stephen M. Jarvis in Toronto.Joseph Schull, Edward Blake: Leader and Exile, 1881-1912 (Toronto: MacMillan of Canada, 1976). Soon it was Blake & Blake when brother Samuel Hume Blake joined. In 1867, Blakes incorporated what would become Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The bank remains one of the firm's oldest clients. In 1878, Blakes was the first business in Canada to install a telephone system that provided a direct link to the offices of the Ontario Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada at Osgoode Hall. In 1882, Zebulon Aiton Lash joined Blakes and began building a corporate law practice.Christopher Moore. The Law Society of Upper Canada and Ontario's Lawyers, 1797-1997. University of Toronto Press; 1997. . p. 153‚Äì. By 1885, with 15 lawyers, Blakes was among the largest corporate law firms in the young Canadian Confederation. In 1894, Clara Brett Martin articled at Blakes. She was called to the bar in 1897, becoming the first woman lawyer in Ontario and the British Empire. In 1953, the firm's name was changed to Blake, Cassels & Graydon.T.D.

The results of this case determined when a taxpayer has a separate business. In 1968, Blakes represented the defendant in the case of Composers, Authors and Publishers Assoc. of Canada Limited v. CTV Television Network Limited et al., S.C.R. 676. The plaintiff's contention that the defendants had infringed section 3(1)(f) of the Copyright Act by communicating the named musical works by radio communication could not be supported on the literal meaning of the statute because, in view of the statutory definitions, what was communicated was not \\"the works\\" but \\"a performance of the works\\". By 1970, Blakes had grown to 66 lawyers. In 1979, Blakes represented the defendant in R. v. Chapin, 2 S.C.R. 121. After two trials and two appeals, it was determined that the Migratory Birds Convention Act is a regulatory statute enacted for the general welfare of the Canadian public and its wildlife. Section 14(1) creates a \\"public welfare offence\\" and it is not subject to the presumption of full mens rea. The next year, Blakes was part of Labatt Breweries of Canada Ltd. v. Attorney General of Canada 1 S.C.R. 914. The firm won the case for the appellant as it was determined that section B.02.130 to B.02.135 of the Food and Drug Regulations are invalid and that Sections 6 and 25(1)(c) of the Food and Drugs Act are ultra vires Parliament in so far as they relate to malt liquors. In 1985, the firm opened an office in Calgary, where it became an adviser to the energy sector. A year later, Blakes was among the first Canadian law firms to expand internationally with an office in London, England. The firm continued to expand, opening an office in Vancouver in 1989, which focuses on natural resources companies, financial institutions, technology businesses and governments. Its Ottawa office, opened in 1990, serves clients interfacing with lawmakers, federal agencies and technology companies. In 1994, Blakes represented the respondent in Schmidt v.

It is the home of St Mirren. The stadium is the sixth home of the club and replaced Love Street. History View of the stadium during construction Talks over a new stadium began on 15 January 2003, when the club met representatives from Aldi and Lidl. The club were looking to sell their ground at Love Street for retail development. Selling Love Street would secure the necessary funding to build the new stadium. Planning applications for a retail development at Love Street were passed on 24 May 2005 and the club subsequently sold the ground to Tesco on 25 April 2007 for ¬£15 million. The new stadium site broke ground on 7 January 2008 and was officially opened on 31 January 2009 at a cost of ¬£8 million. Before the first game at the new stadium there was a parade from Love Street to Greenhill Road to celebrate the opening of the stadium. Club chairman Stewart Gilmour and First Minister Alex Salmond were also present at the first match at the new ground. Alex Salmond unveiled a plaque before the game to commemorate the opening. The game between St Mirren and Kilmarnock finished in a 1-1 draw, with the first goal at the new stadium being scored by Kilmarnock striker Kevin Kyle. Dennis Wyness scored St Mirren's first goal at the new ground, in the same match. The opening match set the record attendance of 7,542, and was only surpassed in the Scottish Premiership play-off match against Dundee United, when 7,732 fans attended on 26 May 2019. St Mirren Park has also become the regular home of the Scotland national under-21 football team. In November 2015, St Mirren agreed a two-year sponsorship deal with Renfrewshire Council to rename the stadium as the Paisley 2021 Stadium. This was to promote Paisley's bid to become a UK City of Culture in 2021. In June 2018, the stadium was renamed as The Simple Digital Arena as part of a four- year deal with Glasgow-based IT firm Simple Digital Solutions. Construction St Mirren Park is built on a 12.5 acre site on Greenhill Road in the Ferguslie Park area of the town. The previously unused site is less than a mile from the club's former ground. Barr Construction were responsible for the design and construction of the stadium. Their design consisted of four grandstands with a total capacity of . The East Stand is the Main Stand. The North Stand is used by away fans. Larger away supports can also be seated in a section of the West Stand. The West Stand has the largest capacity of all the stands. Whilst the South Stand is the Family Stand. *East Stand (Greenhill Road) - capacity 2,220. (Main Stand) *West Stand (Craigielea Drive) - capacity 2,516. (2 sections for Away Stand Overspill or small away support) *North Stand (Ferguslie Park Avenue) - capacity 1,633. (Away Stand) *South Stand (Drums Avenue) - capacity 1,654. (Family Stand) Facilities On the outside of the stadium, promotional plaques have been constructed on the wall including fans names and loved ones. In the undercroft areas under each of the home support sections, large plaques dedicated to the members of the club's 'Hall of fame' have been erected by members of the supporters association and the website team, detailing player profiles and stats. Also, a 7-a-side pitch behind the North Stand is covered by the Airdome and can be hired by the public. Transport Paisley St James Railway Station, which is served by trains on the Inverclyde Line from Glasgow Central, is adjacent to St Mirren Park. Since the stadium opened, some supporters campaigned for the local transport authorities to rename the station to Paisley St Mirren. Following station improvements, the signage of the station was updated to read as \\"Paisley St James, alight here for St Mirren Park\\", as a compromise between supporter groups and the local transport regulators SPT. Paisley Gilmour Street is a 15-minute walk from St Mirren Park, but has a much more frequent service from Glasgow Central. The ground is very near to the M8 Motorway and is accessed via junction 29. Fans travelling from North Ayrshire can also access the ground via the A737 road. There is a car park at the stadium for permit holders, and street parking is also available.

He and his brother Frank owned a ranch outside Tombstone, Arizona, Arizona Territory during the 1880s. He was a member of a group of outlaws Cowboys and cattle rustlers that had ongoing conflicts with lawmen Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan Earp. The McLaury brothers repeatedly threatened the Earps because they interfered with the Cowboys' illegal activities. On October 26, 1881, Tom and Frank were both killed in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. The Tombstone shootout was his only gunfight.  Early life  Born Thomas McLaury in Meredith, New York, he was two years old when his family moved to Belle Plaine, Iowa. Both he and his older brother Frank McLaury studied pre-law, and their oldest brother William McLaury eventually became a judge in Fort Worth, Texas. Tom was 5' 3\\" tall and his brother Frank was 5'4\\" tall.  Move to Arizona  In 1878 he and Frank moved to Hereford, Arizona, where they first met Ike Clanton and became associated with the Clanton family. At the time, the Clanton family owned one of the largest cattle operations in the Arizona Territory, although their success was based at least in part on stealing cattle from Mexico Rancheros and later U.S. ranches. By 1879 the two brothers cattle business was growing and they purchased land and built a house at Soldiers Holes. Their ranching operation was near the silver-mining boomtown of Tombstone, Arizona Territory, as its population soared due to the silver rush. They became associated with \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius. On October 27, 1880, the two brothers were briefly detained when Brocius accidentally shot and killed Tombstone Town Marshal Fred White.  Outlaw activity  Tom McLaury was involved in several outlaw activities that brought him into conflict with the Earps. = Steals U.S. mules = On July 25, 1880, U.S. Army Captain Joseph H. Hurst asked Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp to assist him in tracking Cowboys who had stolen six U.S. Army mules from Camp Rucker. Virgil requested the assistance of his brothers Wyatt and Morgan, along with Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams, and they found the mules at the McLaurys' ranch. McLaury was a Cowboy, which in that time and region was generally regarded as an outlaw. Legitimate cowmen were referred to as cattle herders or ranchers. They found the branding iron used to change the \\"U.S.\\" brand to \\"D.8.\\"From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Stealing the mules was a federal offense because the animals were U.S. property. Cowboy Frank Patterson \\"made some kind of a compromise\\" with Captain Hurst and persuaded the posse to withdraw with the understanding that the mules would be returned. The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Captain Hurst and the Earps. In response, Capt. Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and specifically charged McLaury with assisting in hiding the mules. He also reproduced the flyer in The Tombstone Epitaph, on July 30, 1880. McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy- friendly Nuggett, calling Hurst \\"unmanly,\\" \\"a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar,\\" and accused Hurst of stealing the mules himself. Capt. Hurst later cautioned Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan that the cowboys had threatened their lives. Virgil reported that Frank accosted him and warned him \\"If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then you will have to fight anyway.\\" A month later Earp ran into Frank and Tom McLaury in Charleston, and they told him if he ever followed them as he had done before, they would kill him. = Stage robberies = Tensions between the Earps and both the Clantons and McLaurys increased through 1881. On March 15, 1881 at 10:00 pm, three Cowboys attempted to rob a Kinnear & Company stagecoach carrying US$26,000 in silver bullion (about $ in today's dollars) near Benson, during which popular driver Eli \\"Budd\\" Philpot and passenger Peter Roerig were killed. Tensions further increased between the Earps and the McLaurys when a passenger stage on the Sandy Bob line headed for Bisbee was robbed in the Tombstone area on September 8. The masked robbers shook down the passengers and robbed the strongbox. They were recognized by their voices and language. They were identified as Pete Spence (an alias for Elliot Larkin Ferguson) and Frank Stilwell, a business partner of Spence who had shortly before been fired as a deputy of Sheriff Behan's (for county tax \\"accounting irregularities\\"). Spence and Stilwell, friends of the McLaury brothers, were arrested by sheriff's deputies Breakenridge and Nagel for the stage robbery, and later by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp on the federal offense of mail robbery. Released on bail, Spence and Stilwell were re-arrested by Virgil for the Bisbee robbery a month later, October 13, on the new federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The newspapers, however, reported that they had been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred (October 8) near Contention City. Occurring less than two weeks before the O.K. Corral shootout, this final incident may have been misunderstood by the McLaurys. While Wyatt and Virgil were still out of town for the Spence and Stilwell hearing, Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp, telling him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again.  Shootout in Tombstone  By October 1881, tensions between the Earps and Cowboys had increased dramatically. Ike Clanton, a good friend of Tom's, had repeatedly threatened the Earps. On October 26 he had been drinking most of the previous night and that morning. He was armed and told others he was looking for Holliday or an Earp. At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Ike on 4th Street and Virgil buffaloed (pistol-whipped) him from behind. Disarming him, Virgil took Ike to appear before Judge Wallace for violating the city's ordinance against carrying firearms in the city. While Wyatt waited with Clanton, Virgil went to find Judge Wallace so the court hearing could be held. On the morning of October 26, 1881, the McLaury brothers were in Tombstone and armed in violation of a city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons in town. It is not known who started shooting first. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory. Those loyal to one side or the other told conflicting stories and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. Most witnesses reported the first two shots were so close together that they could barely be distinguished. Some witnesses testified that Morgan and Doc fired across one another at Billy and Frank, respectively. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Wyatt later testified that he and Billy Clanton fired the first two shots. Virgil said one of the first shots was Billy Clanton's. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) All witnesses agreed that general firing almost immediately commenced. Witnesses could not agree on whether Tom McLaury was armed. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Tom McLaury; Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton Graves of Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury in Boothill Cemetery, Tombstone, Arizona. = Role in the gunfight = On October 30, 1881, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday. Justice of the Peace Wells Spicer convened a preliminary hearing to determine if the charges had merit. Various witnesses offered conflicting testimony about whether Tom was armed. When the gunfight ended, a gun was not found near Tom McLaury or on his body. Wyatt Earp later insisted that someone had removed Tom's weapon and that the Cowboys lied during the O.K. Corral hearing. At the time, The Tombstone Epitaph was loyal to the business owners and the Earps, while the Tombstone Nugget favored rural interests and the Cowboys. Wyatt testified afterward that he saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury in Spangenberger's gun and hardware store on 4th Street filling their gun belts with cartridges. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Clara Spalding Brown, the wife of mining engineer Theodore Brown, was a correspondent for the San Diego Union and other California newspapers. She wrote that Tombstone residents were divided about the justification for the killings. Based on the initial testimony given by Ike Clanton during the preliminary hearing, she reported to the San Diego Union that only two of the Cowboys were armed. Saloon owner Andrew Mehan testified that an hour before the gunfight Tom McLaury had checked his pistol with him at Mehan‚Äôs Saloon. Wyatt Earp testified that Tom McLaury fired one or two rounds at them from behind a horse, and that if he was unarmed he did not know it. In an 1896 interview with the San Francisco Examiner, Earp further claimed that Tom McLaury had shot Morgan Earp from behind the horse. In two of Wyatt Earp's three biographies he indicated that Tom McLaury fired the first shots. However, some historians have suggested that Wyatt Earp's claims about his deeds were often flawed and could not be corroborated. One eyewitness, Mrs. J.C. Colyer, was only a short distance away sitting in a buggy when the shootout took place. Although never called to testify at the subsequent inquest, her account of the shooting was published in the Epitaph a few weeks after the event. In her recount of the events she witnessed she said that it was in fact the Cowboys who fired first, and in that interview she said that one Cowboy used a horse as a barricade, firing from under the horses neck. It has since been confirmed that neither Billy Clanton nor Frank McLaury ever came near a horse during the shootout, so if her statement is to be believed, it could only have been Tom McLaury to which she was referring. She knew none of those involved, and was only in Tombstone to visit her sister, therefore making her an unbiased witness. Another eyewitness, laundryman Peter H. Fellehy, testified that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. Fellehy said after the man fell he still held his pistol in his hand. Though saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan had seen Tom deposit his pistol after his beating by Earp and before the gunfight, none of the Earps had any way of knowing that Tom had left his revolver at the saloon. Hotel keeper Albert \\"Chris\\" Billickie, whose father Charles owned the Cosmopolitan Hotel, saw Tom McLaury enter Bauer's butcher shop about 2:00 p.m. He testified that Tom's right-hand pants pocket was flat when he went in but protruded, as if it contained a pistol (so he thought), when he emerged. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Retired army surgeon Dr. J. W. Gardiner also testified that he saw the bulge in Tom's pants. However, the bulge in Tom's pants pocket may have been the nearly $3,300 in cash and receipts found on his body, perhaps in payment for stolen Mexican beef purchased by the butcher. Frank McLaury had told others that he had decided to remain in town to take care of some business. His brother Will McLaury, a judge in Fort Worth, Texas, claimed in a letter he wrote during the preliminary hearing after the shoot out that Tom and Frank were planning to conduct business before leaving town to visit him in Fort Worth. He wrote that Billy Clanton, who had arrived on horseback with Frank, intended to go with the McLaurys to Fort Worth. Author Paul Johnson believes that the McLaurys were about to leave for Iowa to attend the wedding of their sister, Sarah Caroline. Tom and Frank were especially close to Sarah, one of their 14 siblings and half-siblings.

A Victorian interstate football representative, Fleming was a member of Geelong's 1925 premiership side. Fleming was involved in an unusual incident during Geelong's Round 12 match of the 1924 season against Fitzroy. With Geelong trailing by 3 points, Fleming took a mark near goal just before the final siren sounded. Play was held up while the umpire endeavoured to move no fewer than 11 Fitzroy players back from the mark. To Fleming's amazement, three Fitzroy players attempted to build a human pyramid to stop him scoring. Fleming kicked the goal and Geelong won 9.14 (68) to 9.11 (65). A rule change was made allowing only one defending player to stand on the mark. He joined VFA club Oakleigh in 1929 and played at centre half forward in their 1930 and 1931 premierships.

(formerly known as San Jose High School) is a private Catholic school located in the municipality of La Trinidad, Benguet, Philippines.  History  In 1960, Rev. Fr. John Wageners, C.I.C.M., was appointed the parish priest of La Trinidad Mission. At that time, there was no Catholic school yet in the parish, so he decided to put one up. He contacted Brother Peter Verhaegh, C.I.C.M., who created plans. Construction got underway on March 21, 1964. The eastern wing was completed in four months, and the school was formally opened with 101 students on August 3, 1964, while construction was still underway. The first second-year students were all transferees, mostly from private schools in Baguio. When the school building was finally finished, it had 14 classrooms, a library, a laboratory, offices, a gymnasium, a stage, social halls, vocational rooms, and some storerooms. The first group of 41 students graduated in 1967. The number of students tripled over the next ten years. Because of restrictions on further expansion because of the size of the property, some offices were converted into classrooms. During the 1988‚Äì1989 school year, the student population had reached over a thousand. Rev. Fr. Brigido Galasgas, D.D., then the school director, converted the social halls and vocational rooms into classrooms to accommodate the 20 section students. There was still a need for more classrooms and offices, so Fr. Galasgas put up another building on the only available space‚Äîbehind the Father's Rectory. During the Silver Jubilee year (1989‚Äì1990), 1,037 students were enrolled at San Jose High School. San Jose Preparatory School also opened that year. On July 16, 1990, an earthquake damaged the main school building beyond repair. The building had to be demolished. Temporary classrooms were constructed on the playground and in the open gymnasium to hold regular classes. Construction of the new school building started in 1991 and was completed in 1994. Recently, the school administration changed its original name of San Jose High School to \\"San Jose School of La Trinidad Inc.\\" wherein it was divided into two departments; San Jose School of La Trinidad Inc.

Wise was a sensation as a high school player at Dunbar High School in Baltimore, Maryland. In his junior year in 1973, Wise led Dunbar to a victory over DeMatha High School, led by future NBA star Adrian Dantley. Wise then played at Clemson University and was the first freshman to win first team all-conference honors in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Wise left Clemson after his freshman year, signing with the Baltimore Claws of the American Basketball Association in 1975. However, drugs impaired his play; in Terry Pluto's book on the ABA, Loose Balls, a coach found Wise shivering in the locker room, suggesting heroin use. The Claws folded after playing three preseason exhibition games, so Wise then signed with the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors cut him after a few days, however, with Wise's drug use as a major reason (allegedly, Warriors coach Al Attles caught Wise using heroin in the team locker room). Later in the 1975-76 season, Wise hooked on with the San Antonio Spurs, playing two games, his only games as a professional. Wise eventually served prison time for drug-related crimes in the 1970s and 1980s, before returning home to Baltimore and working in a local community center.

Prior to his Parliamentary career, he became well known as the quizmaster for the Bournvita Quiz Contest and other shows.

He later wrote that he was drawn to the charisma and personality of the Trinamool Congress leader (now chief minister of Bengal) Mamata Banerjee, and felt she was the only one who could defeat the then CPI(M)-led Communist government in the state. O‚ÄôBrien soon became a spokesperson for the Trinamool Congress and was identified as the rare white-collar, English-speaking politician in the party. He came to national media attention during Mamata Banerjee's protest against the CPI(M) government's land acquisition attempt in Singur (2006), and then in the run-up to the 2009 Lok Sabha election, in which Trinamool Congress handed the CPI(M) its first defeat in West Bengal since 1977.

The museum exhibited the Canterbury Cross and contained a gallery dedicated to Rupert the Bear, whose creator Mary Tourtel lived in Canterbury. It held regular events and exhibitions of local and national interest. The museum closed in 2018. It has since re-opened as The Marlowe Kit; an escape room, exhibition and creative space.

Dictionary of British & Irish Botanists & Horticulturists, p.475. Taylor & Francis, and Natural History Museum, London. Retrieved on December 18, 2016 =Poor Priests' Hospital= The museum was in the medieval Poor Priests' Hospital with two adjoining buildings, backing on to the River Stour. From 1174 to 1207 the long, low block parallel to Stour Street was the stone house of a tanner, a rich minter and the minter's son, Alexander, who converted it into an almshouse in the name of the Virgin Mary for old and poor priests. The priests used the house as a hall, living, eating and sleeping around a central fire. In 1373 the solar and undercroft were added opposite the present gateway, to give privacy on the upper floor to the master of the hospital. At the other end of the original hall was the service quarter for servants with kitchen, pantry and buttery. Next to the solar is the Chapel of St Mary, which was designed as a single open space with a back kitchen. Two upper floors were later inserted, with windows and chimney. This set of buildings became secular in 1575: a school, poorhouse, workhouse and clinic. The museum was previously at the Beaney as the Heritage Museum, then was established in Stour Street in 1987 to celebrate local history, and the building restored to show the interior crown-post roof. =Closure and reopening= The museum was closed in 2018 following a campaign by local institutions, including Canterbury Archaeological Trust, to keep it open.Kent Messenger as Kent Online: \\"Campaign to stop the closure of the Canterbury Heritage Museum in Stour Street has widespread support\\", Gerry Warren 27 February 2017 The official Museums and Galleries website gives no mention of the museum or its closure On 6 April 2019, the museum reopened with a year- long exhibition called The Marlowe Kit. Exhibits =Canterbury Heritage Museum= Modern replica brooch in the style of the Canterbury Cross Exhibits in galleries and displays dated from pre-Roman to the present, and were arranged as a time walk from the earliest to latest, with a prehistoric and Anglo-Saxon display, medieval discovery gallery, Marlowe whodunit display, wartime Blitz experience, Joseph Conrad gallery, Bagpuss and Clangers display, Rupert Bear Museum, and an exhibitions gallery. There were interactive displays involving a microscope, a treasure chest and World War II plane- spotting. There was also a wing housing The 1900 House Victorian collection. There was a tapestry, covering three walls, which showed the life-story of Thomas Becket. There was a display of bones found locally, with forensic analysis and reconstructed faces from the Meet the Ancestors show. A prized exhibit in the Saxon gallery was the Canterbury Cross, an 850 AD Saxon brooch found in St Georges Street in 1867. It is in the form of a consecration cross: traditionally one of twelve similar crosses marked on church walls to represent the apostles and the twelve anointings of the building by the bishop at consecration. Invicta locomotive There was also furniture, household objects, arms and armour, as well as the Canterbury Pendant: a Saxon silver portable sundial which was lent briefly in 2009 to Canterbury Cathedral for an exhibition. It was made in the form of a pendant, is ascribed to the silversmith St Dunstan (909‚àí988 AD), and could probably only indicate the time accurately at noon. It was used to measure the time of prayer. It was found in the Cathedral cloisters during excavations in 1948. Information from Canterbury Museums Department The Invicta locomotive was housed here. Between 2009 and 2012, Canterbury Heritage Museum held many of The Beaney's exhibits during its refurbishment, including the Sir Basil Dixwell by Van Dyck bought for ¬£1 million by Canterbury in 2004; Sir Basil had lived at Broome Park near Canterbury. =Rupert Bear Museum= Rupert Bear exhibit The Rupert Bear Museum was opened in 2003 with a ¬£500,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant. The creator of Rupert Bear, Mary Tourtel, grew up and attended art school in Canterbury, and a 1921 first-edition Rupert annual was one of the exhibits. The Rupert Bear Museum involves activities for children on the themes of play, entertainment and education. It includes the Bagpuss and Clangers display with items from the original television shows, such as the Emily shop-window from the opening scene of Bagpuss, because its creators Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate filmed the programmes at Firmin's house near Canterbury. The museum was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund and Express Newspapers. Exhibitions, events and accessibility Regular family interactive events were scheduled. In June 2008 there was a two-day celebration of the centenary of Ian Fleming's birth and of the James Bond films. In November 2008 there was a Rupert Bear Day, with the cartoon's new illustrator Stuart Trotter signing Rupert books. In July 2009 the museum celebrated the anniversary of Neil Armstrong's first moonwalk in 1969. It was an interactive event with the public chatting to astronomers and an astrodome showing a 3D tour of night sky and Solar System. In 2009 the museum celebrated an exhibition and a 40th anniversary of the Clangers TV show with two interactive events which included meetings with Peter Firmin, the show's co-creator. Oliver Postgate, the other creator of Bagpuss and the Clangers, lived locally and died in 2008, but his creations were given to the museum during his lifetime. The museum was open seasonally between March and September and was also open during school holidays, with disabled access. An entrance fee was charged.

Borah was a leading figure in American foreign policy in the years after World War I, contributing to the American non-acceptance of the League of Nations and the acceptance of the Washington Naval Treaty of the early 1920s. This apartment is the best-preserved surviving residence of Borah; for its association with his life, the entire building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and Description and history The apartment complex formerly known as Windsor Lodge is located in Washington's Kalorama Heights neighborhood, at the northeastern corner of Wyoming Avenue NW and Thompson Place NW. It consists of two four-story buildings joined by a party wall in a rear connecting section to form a U shape. Its walls are formed out of red brick that has been painted a cream color. The two halves of the building are stylistically similar, but are not identical, differing in plan and detail. Each has its main entrance in the center of its front facade; that on the left is sheltered by a wide bracketed hood that also forms a balcony on the second floor, while the right one has a more elaborate porch. William Borah's apartment was the one on the second floor right side of the eastern half. Borah, a native of Illinois, studied law with his brother-in-law, and established a successful criminal law practice in Boise, Idaho in 1890. He soon became active in Republican Party politics, and won election to the United States Senate in 1907. There he became an influential member of the Foreign Relations Committee. He reluctantly supported US entry into World War I, but vociferously opposed the Treaty of Versailles and the creation of the League of Nations. He was somewhat maverick in his positions, frequently butting heads with party leadership, and sometimes supporting Democratic legislations. He was an outspoken progressive in the party when many of its members were more conservative. This apartment served as William Borah's principal residence from 1913, not long after it was built, until 1929. It is one of two residences closely associated with his life; the other is also nearby in Washington. He did not own a home in Idaho.

This reservoir complex has facilitated with a stone made spillway and three main sluices. From the central major sluice, a 40 feet wide central conveys water to feed thousands of acres of paddy lands and ends at the historical capital Anuradhapura city tank Tissa Wewa meandering over at a slope of 6 inches per mile and is another wonder of primeval hydraulic engineering facility in ancient Ceylon. History This reservoir was built by the King Dhathusena who ruled the country during 455 ‚Äì 473 CE in the 5th century. Tamil invaders who arrived from South India ruled the north part of the country during the period from 429 to 455 AD. King Dhathusena defeated the invaders and united the country and then he wanted to rebuild the irrigation system by constructing several tanks, canals, etc., in and round the kingdom of Anuradhapura. After completion of construction of Kala Wewa, the king built another tank called () nearby and connected the two tanks together making the biggest tank in Sri Lanka.King Mahinda II who ruled the country during 777 ‚Äì 797 CE expanded the tank further. Water of the tank was transferred to the Thisa Wewa () in Anuradhapura by an ancient long canal called Jaya Ganga alias () which has a fine slope of one foot per mile but according to some historians it is one inch per mile. Legends King Dhathusena was very keen on information with regard to a spot very suitable to construct a tank to be the massive one in the history of Sri Lanka. There are some folklore on how the king was able to find a place for the tank he imagined. There was a man called who left his family and went to live in the jungle due to his wife's unbearable and repeated insults and disrespects towards him. After some years in the jungle he was well accustomed with wild animals and lived with a flock of deer. One day a hunter suddenly noticed this strange man living with animals in the jungle; went to the palace and told the king that it seems that this strange man lives in the forest in order to guard an unknown treasure there. King sent his army to catch him. was caught and brought to the palace. When the king questioned him of the treasure, revealed his true story and told real reason for his leaving the city and living in the jungle. Then king asked him of any interesting thing he had seen while living in the jungle. said, \\"No sir, I have not seen anything interesting but in a brook somewhere in the jungle, water is being blocked by the flora called ' that has been grown across that stream. According to this legend, it was the spot wherein the king created the Kala' Wewa. Renovation First restoration to the tank is done by King Parakramabahu I in the 12th century. The tank was renovated several times in the past as in the period of British Governor Sir William Henry Gregory (1872‚Äì1877 and Sir Arthur Hamilton-Gordon (1883‚Äì1890).

Purpose The reservoir served as one of largest irrigation tanks in ancient time. While supplying water also for the small tanks in rural areas on the way, the canal Jaya Ganga carried water from Kala Wewa and stored enough water in the ThisƒÅ Wewa for the population of then capital city of Anuradhapura. Being one of main storages in the Mahaweli Irrigation Scheme since 1976, the tank serves to the population in the North Central Sri Lanka. It is used for fresh water fishing and the flora, specially the grasses in its valley, is the main sources of silage for the herds of cattle in the area.

The aircraft's main designer was Stanis≈Çaw Jachyra. The first prototype was flown on 26 June 1958 (registration SP-PAC) with the second prototype flying on 13 September that year (registration SP-PBA). The aircraft was of relatively modern, all-metal construction. Its major drawback was its engine, an imported Praga Doris flat-six piston engine, which caused vibration and was not suitable for aerobatics. This limited the potential use of the aircraft. It was proposed to substitute the Polish designed and built Narkiewicz WN-6 flat-six engine, but this was still under development and was never perfected. Due to these problems with the powerplant, the development of the aircraft was delayed, and in the meantime, the Polish Aero Club changed its preferences to aircraft with a tricycle landing gear and withdrew its interest in the M-2. As a result, the M-2 did not enter production and further works were abandoned. A development of the M-2 was the PZL M-4 Tarpan, with a retractable tricycle landing gear. = Description = Metal construction low- wing monoplane, conventional in layout, metal covered.

At its release, the album was controversial for its innovative use of technology, with Tristano overdubbing piano and manipulating tape speed for effect on the first four tracks. The final five songs are concert recordings. Originally released as Tristano's Atlantic Records debut, the album was released on CD in 1994 by Rhino Records in combined form with Tristano's 1960 follow-up, The New Tristano, and as part of a collection, The Complete Atlantic Recordings of Lennie Tristano, Lee Konitz & Warne Marsh, in 1997. It was subsequently re-issued in original form and track-list order by Warner Jazz (2002), Rhino (2003) and Collectables (2004). In 1997, The New York Times dubbed the album a masterpiece. AMG describes the album as \\"gorgeous... with a beautiful juxtaposition between the first half and the second half between the rhythmic and intervallic genius of Tristano as an improviser and as a supreme lyrical and swinging harmonist on the back half\\". Controversial innovation According to Ira Gitler in The Masters of Be-Bop, the overdubbing and tape speed manipulation on this album unleashed a furor. Tristano had begun experimenting in 1951, when he had additional piano tracks, some of which had been speeded up by engineer Rudy van Gelder, added to his recording of the songs \\"Ju Ju\\" and \\"Pastime\\". Tristano later recalled that not a single reviewer questioned the multitracking of those songs. According to Tristano, questions began to arise six months to a year later. At the time, Tristano declined to discuss it. In an interview years later, he described a private incident where Leonard Bernstein and Willie Kapell debated the topic in his home. After Bernstein declared his certainty that the songs were multitracked, Kapell demonstrated that the speed was possible by playing a Mozart tune 16 times faster than it would generally be played. Following the release of Lennie Tristano, the usage of multitracking and tape speed was widely questioned and criticized on the songs \\"Line Up\\", \\"Turkish Mambo\\" and \\"East Thirty-Second\\".Gitler, 238. In the case of \\"Turkish Mambo\\", Tristano played three separate and conflicting piano tracks, with left-hand rhythms of five, six and seven beats beneath right-hand improvisation. Tristano made specific reference to that song in defending his choice, stating that \\"[i]f I do multiple tapes, I don't feel I'm a phony thereby. Take \\"The Turkish Mambo\\". There is no other way I could do it so that I could get the rhythms to go together the way I feel them.\\" On the question of tape speed, he added, \\"If people want to think I speeded up the piano on \\"Line Up\\" and \\"East Thirty- Second\\", I don't care. What I care about is that the result sounded good to me.\\" Contributing bassist Peter Ind, inspired to later use the same technique on his own album Looking Out, argued on the contrary to those who feel this is a deceptive technique that it is simply another tool an artist may use to craft his work. Though controversial immediately on release, Tristano's decision to use the technique was described in 1997 by The New York Times as \\"celebrated\\".

Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo's \\"Cantares de los pajes de la nao\\" by Coro Estable de Rosario, conducted by Cristi√°n Hern√°ndez Largu√≠a, was Qualiton's first recording in 1961. Soon, the idea of producing other choruses became a perfect venue to establish the company in the local arena. Limited editions, of no more than 300 units, were quickly absorbed amongst the members of the chorus ensemble and their relatives.La Prensa, October 30, 1967. Article by Eduardo Lagos. Title: @Tango y Folklore By 1965, the early catalog of Discos Qualiton produced by Fondo Cultural, was beginning to develop into a greater ordeal. Fondo Cultural became extinct and Fonema incorporated thus allowing Nora Raffo and Carlos Melero, newest members of the Qualiton team, to join in the corporation.Lahiteau, Luciano. \\"Carlos Melero y su tesoro privado del jazz local\\" Diario Clarin, Revista √ë / Escenarios. Buenos Aires 03/06/2019La Naci√≥n, Nov. 24, 1967 The following years were mostly dedicated to producing classical music with a particular emphasis in baroque and colonial periods in Latin America. Also worth mentioning are the recordings of ethnographic music harvested in the field and gathered under the label Serie del Conocimiento and the unique recordings of literary works known as Juglar√≠a.  The 1970s  By the late 1960s, the record label had already relocated from Rosario to Buenos Aires and expanded its catalog. New investors were seduced by the idea of creating a major independent label. Curt von Simpson and Gertrudis Moser joined Fonema executive leadership providing the needed contacts with local banks (namely Banco Oddone).Luis Oddone (CEO Oddone Group), interviewed by the author of this article.

Take one, which would eventually become a landmark of the record industry was located at Fonema's HQ on Per√∫ 375 in Buenos Aires historical district known as MonserratLuis Maria Cosenza (producer) interviewed by the author of this article. The original concept of a small and family orientated garage experiment born in Rosario had grown out of proportion. However, by 1976, a military putsch, led by Jorge Rafael Videla, ousted Argentine president Isabel Per√≥n making life quite difficult for the arts at large, and in particular for domestic labels linked to the previous years of social unrest. On October 22, 1976, an unsigned article denouncing \\"Marxist Penetration\\" was published in the newspaper La Raz√≥n. The clipping inspired a paramilitary group to target the studios of Discos Qualiton, then located in Calle Per√∫ 365, Buenos Aires, and also members of the board of directors. The artists involved in the actual creation of the songs reproduced in the LP as denounced in the article published by La Raz√≥n were forced into exile. Author Vico Ciliberti fled to Rome.In an interview with Vico Ciliberti and Eduardo Montes-Bradley on January 23, 1986, The final days of Discos Qualiton came about in 1978.Luis Mar√≠a Cosenza (producer), interviewed by the author of this article. Only a few complete collections of Discos Qualiton and other labels associated with Fonema and Fondo Cultural have survived and are available in a handful of libraries, private collections, and research institutes throughout Europe and the US. It is worth noticing that up to 1977, the artistic direction of Discos Qualiton was mostly the result of the expertise of Ivan Cosentino as a musician and recording engineer, while the publishing, editorial presentation, production, and marketing was carried out by Nelson Montes-Bradley.La Naci√≥n, Monday, July 5, 1999. http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=144699  Catalogue  left According to what has been reconstructed from catalogs,Discos Qualiton.

Each LP jacket was carefully designed with the works of local artists such as Mele Bruniard, Battle Planas, Luis Seoane, Antonio Berni and Mario Loza. The graphic corporate image of Qualiton was created by Oscar D√≠az. D√≠az was a prestigious local graphic artist who also conceived the unique logo of Discos Qualiton, Juglar√≠a, and Colecci√≥n Privada. Qualiton's logo, a spiral to its center representing the groove in a vinyl record, incorporated the illusion of a human eye. The concept merged the idea of music and the visual arts in one label. Pablo Barragan, also a graphic designer, joined Qualiton as the in-house artist during the last years of Fonema.

It is located in an ethnically diverse mountainous region of Sichuan. Its Chinese name literally means \\"North\\" (bei) \\"River\\" (chuan). Its new county seat is located at Yongchang after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Geography Beichuan County has an area of . The county varies in elevation from 540 to 4,769 meters in height. The county's major rivers, which include the , the , and the Pingtong River () belong to the larger Fu River watershed. History and culture The first administrative county of Beichuan was set up in 564 A.D. during the Northern Zhou dynasty. The Tang dynasty first created another county, Shiquan () inside the original Beichuan county in 634 A.D., then in 651 A.D. merged Beichuan county into Shiquan. The Republic of China changed the county name back to Beichuan in 1914 because there had been a Shiquan county in Shaanxi province before 564 A.D. In 1988, the China granted Beichuan county the status of Qiang autonomy. The Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County was formally created on July 6, 2003. =Claim to Yu the Great= Beichuan was the first county in Sichuan to make the claim as the birthplace of Yu the Great, founder of the Xia dynasty and traditionally regarded as the first hereditary sovereign in Chinese history. Although this claim is probably more commercial than historical, Beichuan was part of West Qiang () that some ancient records accredited as Yu's birthplace, just like the other three locations in Sichuan, namely Wenchuan, Dujiangyan, and Shifang, that raised similar claims. Many places in other parts of China have made similar claims. =Great Sichuan Earthquake= The old Downtown of Beichuan County being destroyed during 2008 Sichuan Earthquake Also like the other three counties and towns in Sichuan holding claims to be the birthplace of Yu the Great, Beichuan is among the most severely hit of all disaster regions following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, including the Beichuan High School campus, where more than 1,000 students lost their lives after two main buildings collapsed. Beichuan's Party and government building also collapsed, and Yang Zesen, Beichuan's vice mayor then was among the victims. 80% of the county's buildings are said to have collapsed. The county town, which prior to the earthquake had a population of 20,000, is to be made into a memorial park, as the site has been deemed too vulnerable. The survivors of the quake have been relocated.Beichuan county town to be made a memorial, China Daily, May 23, 2008. The earthquake also caused a landslide on Mount Tangjia which dammed the Jian River and created the Tangjiashan Quake Lake. The lake was once in danger of causing the Tangjiashan Dam to collapse and catastrophically flood downstream communities, totalling over a million persons. On June 10, 2008, the lake spilled through an artificially constructed sluice channel and flooded the evacuated town. No casualties were caused. Beichuan was at the center of one of two zones where seismic intensity were the highest at XI liedu during this earthquake and its aftershocks. Since the earthquake, the central government has increased fortification intensity for seismic design for the old county town from VI to VIII. Partially revised in 2008 Administrative divisions Beichuan County has 9 towns, 9 townships, and 1 ethnic township.

The first facsimile edition of the manuscripts was made in a project led by the cartographer Henry James in the 1860s. An English translation of the Latin text for most counties was published by Victoria County History (VCH) during much of the 20th century. A new English translation of the entire text was prepared for the Phillimore Edition, published 1975-1992 for Phillimore & Co under the general editorship of John Morris. The Phillimore Edition is synoptic, placing its translation alongside a facsimile of Farley's edition, and is published in a separate volume for each county. The Phillimore translation did not, however supersede the VCH one as the most authoritative. The Alecto Editions are a series of high-quality bibliophile facsimiles published 1985-1992, with a new English translation in two separate volumes. The Alecto editorial board produced a corrected and standardized translation based on the VCH text. Penguin Books reprinted the Alecto Editions translation in a single volume published in hardback in 2002 and in paperback in 2003. A digital edition of manuscript facsimile images alongside the text of the Phillimore translation was published as the \\"Domesday Explorer\\" on CD-ROM in 2000, publicly accessible as an online database since 2008.  Abraham Farley's edition (1773-1783)  Domesday Book was an item of great interest to the antiquarian movement of the 18th century. This was the age of the county history, with many accounts of the English shires being published at this time, and Domesday Book, as a property record of early date that happened to be arranged by county, was a major source for the medieval history of all the counties encompassed by the survey. The reconstituted Society of Antiquaries of London, founded in 1717 by Humfrey Wanley, John Bagford and John Talman, made it part of its mission to work towards the publication of a wide variety of ancient records, including Domesday. The Society struggled to achieve its aims, however, being afflicted by its members' limited resources and sheer lack of enthusiasm.,Sweet 2004, p. 87. Nevertheless, after the purchase of a Royal Charter in 1751, the possibility of publishing Domesday became more realistic. In 1756 Philip Carteret Webb read a paper to the Society emphasising the great value of Domesday Book, and by implication the urgent need for a published edition: this paper was printed by the printing press of William Bowyer. The following year, in response to Webb's request, members reported back to the Society regarding existing printed and MS transcripts from Domesday Book, with the intention of compiling material that might be of assistance in the task of compiling an edition.Condon and Hallam 1984, pp. 374‚Äì5. This effort did not bear fruit. In 1767, however, for reasons that may be connected to this renewal of interest in Domesday Book, plans were set in motion for the publication of a complete, scholarly edition of Domesday: this coincided with a programme of publication of other public records, including the Parliament Rolls.Condon and Hallam 1984, pp. 363‚Äì76. Entries for Croydon and Cheam, Surrey, in Farley's edition of Domesday Book In March 1767 Charles Morton (1716-1799), a librarian at the British Museum, was put in charge of the scheme; a fact which caused resentment towards him from Abraham Farley, a deputy chamberlain of the Exchequer who for many years had controlled access to Domesday Book in its repository at the Chapter House, Westminster, and furthermore had been involved in the recent Parliament Rolls printing operation.Condon and Hallam 1984, p. 377. In 1768 Farley complained to the Treasury that he, not Morton, should be in charge of the project, while Morton, for his part, complained that he was being obstructed in his work by the staff at the Chapter House.Condon and Hallam 1984, pp. 376‚Äì77. The government, meanwhile, had become concerned at the spiralling cost estimates ‚Äì Morton indicated in 1770 that to continue would cost ¬£4,525 on top of the ¬£2,810 he had already spent. At this point, Farley was remembered, and he became co-editor of the work. Farley and Morton's rivalry precluded an enduring, constructive relationship, and after 1774 Farley was effectively in sole charge.Condon and Hallam 1984, p.378. Farley pursued the task with a single-minded devotion born of long involvement with the public records, and Domesday Book in particular. One of his closest associates during the project was the printer John Nichols, inheritor of William Bowyer's London printing press, who in 1773 had developed the special \\"record type\\" typeface that was used in the published edition to represent as closely as possible the script in Domesday Book itself.Condon and Hallam 1984, pp. 378‚Äì9. Ultimately, Farley's edition of Domesday was completed by 15 March 1783.Condon and Hallam 1984, p. 380. Although of a high standard, Farley's work lacked supplementary material and indices. In 1800, therefore, the Record Commission ordered the printing of indexes to Farley's work. These were compiled under the direction of Sir Henry Ellis and published in 1816, together with an edition of four \\"satellite surveys\\" - the Exon Domesday, the Liber Winton, the Inquisito Eliensis and the Boldon Book.  The photozincographic edition (1861-1863)  A page from the photozincographic edition of Domesday Book for Somersetshire (published in 1862), showing entries for some of the landholdings of Glastonbury Abbey The circulation of Farley's edition was so limited that it could not be truly accounted a work that significantly increased public access to Domesday Book. That was to take place only in 1861, with the production of the first photozincographic facsimile edition of Domesday. The driving force behind the project was Colonel Henry James, the Director General at the Ordnance Survey. The process involved the transferring of a photograph onto zinc or stone, which could then be used directly for printing or, alternatively, onto the waxed surface of a copper plate where the image formed a guide for engraving. It was a system that enabled facsimile reproduction en masse and thus, following a meeting with William Ewart Gladstone in 1859, in which James was allegedly asked by the then-Chancellor of the Exchequer, whether he \\"knew of any process by which some of our ancient manuscripts in the Record Office could be copied\\", James emphasised the superiority of this process over other reproductions, such as lithography, which used heavy and brittle stone blocks and claimed that the process would be ideal for making cheap facsimile copies of Domesday Book. In a letter to the assistant Secretary to the Treasury, George Hamilton in October 1860, James outlined the cost of a complete reproduction of Domesday Book as an estimated ¬£1575 for 500 copies or, alternatively, ¬£3. 3s. per copy. James further outlined the cost of a single county to demonstrate the affordability of the process, using Cornwall as an example of one of the shorter entries in the volumes (eleven folio pages) and estimating the cost of 500 copies to be ¬£11. 2s. 4d. On 14 January 1861, James was granted permission to photo-zincograph the Cornwall fragment of Domesday Book as a Treasury-funded experiment to determine the success of the process and, consequently, by 1863 the Ordnance Survey had photozincographed Domesday Book in its entirety, publishing it in 32 county volumes. Two colours (red and black) were used, replicating those used in the original manuscript. The general public were excited about the invention of photozincography. Newspapers such as the Photographic News reported on the events surrounding the invention and even supplied their readers with an example of a document which had undergone the process.The Photographic News, vol. 3, no. 82, 30 March 1860, p. 360. English translations =Victoria County History (1900-1969)= The Victoria County History (VCH) was founded in 1899 as a project to publish an encyclopaedic history of each of the historic counties of England to a uniform plan. From the outset, it was intended that this plan should include English translations of the relevant county sections of the Domesday Book, with a scholarly introduction and a map. J. H. Round was appointed editor for the Domesday sections. He translated the texts and wrote the introductions for Hampshire (published 1900), Worcestershire (1901), Northamptonshire (1902), and Essex (1903); wrote the introductions for Hertfordshire (1902), Surrey (1902), Bedfordshire (1904), Warwickshire (1904), Buckinghamshire (1905), Somerset (1906), Berkshire (1907), and Herefordshire (1908), though the translations were by others; and he oversaw work on Cumberland (by J. Wilson, published 1901), Derbyshire (by Frank Stenton, published 1905), Sussex (by L. F. Salzman, published 1905), Devon (by O. J. Reichel, published 1906), Lancashire (by William Farrer, published 1906), Norfolk (by Charles Johnson, published 1906), Nottinghamshire (by Frank Stenton, published 1906), Leicestershire (by Frank Stenton, published 1907), Rutland (by Frank Stenton, published 1908), and Shropshire (translation by C. H. Drinkwater, introduction by James Tait, published 1908). Round also began a translation of Domesday for Lincolnshire, but this remained unfinished.Powell 2001, p. 154. Round retired from the project in 1908, but the VCH subsequently published translations of Domesday for Suffolk (translation anonymous, introduction by B. A. Lees, published 1911); Yorkshire (by William Farrer, published 1912); Cornwall (translation by T. Taylor, introduction by L. F. Salzman, published 1924); Huntingdonshire (by Frank Stenton, published 1926); Kent (translation by F. W. Ragg, introduction by N. Neilson, published 1932); Cambridgeshire (translation by J. Otway-Ruthven, introduction by L. F. Salzman, published 1938); Oxfordshire (by Frank Stenton, published 1939); Wiltshire (by R. R. Darlington, published 1955); Staffordshire (by C. F. Slade, published 1958); Dorset (translation by A. Williams, introduction by Ralph Pugh, published 1968); and Middlesex (by T. G. Pinder, published 1969). Independently of the VCH, translations were published for Cheshire by James Tait for the Chetham Society in 1916; for Lincolnshire by C. W. Foster and T. Longley for the Lincoln Record Society in 1924 (reprinted 1976); for the East Riding of Yorkshire by A. B. Wilson-Barkworth in 1925; and for Staffordshire by H. M. Fraser in 1936. This left only Gloucestershire without a published 20th-century translation. = The Phillimore Edition (1975‚Äì1992) = The Phillimore Edition is a parallel-text Latin and English edition of Great Domesday Book, published by the local-history specialist publishers Phillimore & Co under the general editorship of John Morris. Each county occupies a separate volume. The first volumes to appear were those for Middlesex, Surrey and Huntingdonshire, all in 1975; and the last those for Lincolnshire, Yorkshire (both counties occupying 2 volumes each), Shropshire, and Suffolk, all of which were published in 1986. The Latin text, printed on the left-hand pages, is a facsimile of Farley's edition; the translation, on the right-hand pages, was prepared by a team of volunteers, who (to ensure uniformity) worked within standardised guidelines for syntax, punctuation and the rendering of proper names and technical terms. Each volume includes notes, tables of tenants' names and place-names, and a map. Uniform with the edition, a one- volume Guide to Domesday Book by Rex Welldon Finn was published in 1973. A 3-volume set of indexes was published in 1992. Although the Phillimore edition rapidly became the most readily accessible and widely used version of Domesday Book, scholars criticised the translation for over-simplifying complex historical concepts: David Bates, for example, described it as \\"unconvincingly and unhelpfully 'modern'\\".Bates 1985, p.34.  The Alecto Editions (1985-1992) Alecto Millennium Edition binding Published between 1985 and 1992, the Alecto Edition is the most complete facsimile of Domesday Book to date. There are three types of Alecto edition, the \\"Penny Edition\\", the Millennium Edition and the Domesday Book Studies edition. It has been called an \\"indecently exact facsimile\\" by Professor Geoffrey Martin, then Keeper of Public Records and custodian of the original Domesday.Addison Publications: Domesday Book This edition was accompanied by a volume of indices, a two- volume English translation and a box set of Ordnance Survey Maps with the Domesday sites overlaid on the modern maps.http://addisonpublications.com/books/dmillennium.html Addison Publications: Domesday Book: Millennium Edition] =Facsimile= In order to produce this extremely high quality reproduction, the original Domesday Book was unbound to allow each page to be photographed. The camera used for this process was the same size as a Ford Fiesta, and for security reasons was only operated in a sealed cage. The Penny Edition was printed on a specialist paper made from cotton from the American Deep South to give something of the same weight and feel as the parchment of the original. These pages were then bound between sheets of 15th-century oak set with a silver penny of William I and another 1986 Elizabeth II penny minted specially for the occasion. Because of the vast expense involved each copy of the Penny Edition cost ¬£5750 and only 250 were produced. The later Millennium Edition used the same high quality images and paper was bound into two volumes of calfskin in the style of the 12th-century binding. This edition was limited to 450 copies at a cost of ¬£6750 for Greater Domesday and ¬£5750 for Little Domesday.Revealed: The inside story of the making of the Domesday Book, Times Online, 8 December 2002. The Library Version of Domesday used the same paper as the Penny and Millennium versions but was bound in a linen cover and boxed to provide durability. This edition came with indices, translations and maps. =Translation= Cover of Penguin Edition (UK) The Alecto Historical Editions translation, published in two companion volumes to the facsimile, was intended to supersede the VCH translation, which, although of high quality, suffers from inconsistencies due to its publication history being spread out over more than 80 years. The editorial board, consisting of Ann Williams (editor-in-chief), G. H. Martin (general editor), J. C. Holt, Henry R. Loyn, Elizabeth Hallam-Smith (Assistant Keeper of Public Records), and Sarah Tyacke (Keeper of Public Records, the National Archives) produced a rigorously standardized and corrected translation based on the VCH text. Penguin Books reproduced the Alecto translation in a single volume, published in 2002 in hardback and in 2003 in paperback, with an introduction by G. H. Martin. It is the first edition to omit the Latin text entirely, and the first single-volume edition of the translated text. The paperback was originally priced at ¬£25.Penguin UK  Digital editions ;The Domesday Explorer Screen shot of the Domesday Explorer The Domesday Explorer was developed by John Palmer of University of Hull and his son Matthew Palmer as a private project beginning 1986 and using Microsoft Access, later turned into a publicly funded project, receiving a grant of ¬£250,000 from the British Arts and Humanities Research Council.

The Hospitals goal was to provide patients with competent female physicians, educate women in the study of medicine and train nurses to care for the sick. Until 1951 the hospital remained dedicated to women, it was then renamed to New England Hospital to include male patients. The hospital was renamed again to The Dimock Community Health Center in 1969. At present The Dimock Community Health Center provides a range of healthcare services including Adult & Pediatric Primary Care, Women‚Äôs Healthcare and HIV/AIDS Specialty Care. New England Hospital for Women and Children History = Founding = Susan Dimock Marie Zakrzewska was born on September 9, 1829, in Berlin. In one of her memoirs she wrote ‚ÄúI prefer to be remembered only as a woman who was willing to work for the elevation of woman.‚Äù She did just that by starting the hospital. As a child she followed her mother (a midwife) around the school of midwifery where she worked. Once she was 18 she applied to study midwifery, which was the only part of medicine women were allowed to work in, at the Royal Charit√© Hospital in Berlin. She was rejected, however, she continued to apply at ages 19 and 20, but was still rejected. It was only once Dr. Joseph Hermann Schmidt, who worked at the school, used his influence to get her in that she finally was able to study medicine. Later, she moved to America, where women were allowed to be doctors. Once in New York, she met Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, who helped her to become a doctor. The two of them opened the New York Infirmary for Women and Children on May 1, 1857. This lead her to go to Boston to meet with the board at the New England Female College, where she was offered, and accepted, a position as a professor of Obstetrics, and Diseases of Women and Children and the head of the clinical program. She eventually resigned. With the help of members of the board of the New England Female College as well as Ednah D. Cheney (legal sponsor), Lucy Goddard (legal sponsor), Mrs. George G. Lee (donated $3000), and Samuel E. Sewall (donated $1000), she opened the New England Hospital for Women and Children on July 1, 1862. = Hospital = The goal of the hospital was ‚Äú1) to provide for women medical aid of competent physicians of their own sex; 2) to assist educated women in the practical study of medicine; and 3) to train nurses for the care of the sick.‚Äù Dr. Zakrzewska was devoted to providing obstetric care to all who needed it, regardless of race or economic status. At the start of the hospital, the staff consisted of Dr. Zakrzewska, two interns, and two consulting physicians. By 1900 there was a resident physician, 54 attending, assisting, and advisory physicians, and 13 consulting physicians. All staff and doctors that worked there were women until 1950 when a lack of money led the board to reverse the policy. The policy was again reversed in 1952 to only allow women to be on the staff. This was reversed a final time in 1962 when the by-laws were rewritten. In 1864, the Massachusetts state legislature gave the hospital a grant of $5000, allowing it to expand down Pleasant street. The hospital also acquired property behind the hospital at the end of 1864. This allowed the hospital to split into 3 parts. A hospital, a dispensary, and an inpatient facility. In 1865, Dr. Anita Tyng was hired as a surgeon. She was the first woman in the US to ever be listed as specializing in surgery by a hospital. She is one of the women who sent a letter to the founder of the MIT, in January 1867,requesting to \\"continue the study of Chemistry in the Technological Institute.\\" In 1872, the hospital moved to Codman Avenue in suburban Roxbury, and the dispensary stayed in the center of Boston. This new hospital opened a nursing school, the first in America. The first American trained nurse, Linda Richards (graduated 1873) and the first African American trained nurse, Mary Eliza Mahoney (graduated 1879) were both trained at the nursing school. Unfortunately, the nursing school was closed in 1951. The hospital remained dedicated to women and children until 1951 when it was renamed the New England Hospital. Part of this decision was to reflect that it was now open to men as well as women and children. The decision to open the hospital to men also resulted from its financial difficulties. In 1969, the hospital was renamed again. This time it was named The Dimock Community Health Center. It was named after Susan Dimock, a resident doctor (surgeon) at the hospital who drowned in the shipwreck of the SS Schiller on May 7, 1875, when she was just 28. Because of its history, the clinic's buildings are listed as a National Historic Landmark. All of the buildings at the Dimock Center are named after women. = Current day = From the Center‚Äôs historic nine-acre campus located in the Egleston Square section of Roxbury, MA, and several satellite locations, The Dimock Center provides access to high-quality healthcare and human services that include: Adult & Pediatric Primary Care, Women‚Äôs Healthcare, Eye and Dental Care, HIV/AIDS Specialty Care, Outpatient Mental Health services, Residential Programs, The Mary Eliza Mahoney House shelter for families, pre-school, Head Start programs, after-school programs and Adult Basic Education & Workforce Training programs.

Haemozoin is a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by some blood-feeding parasites. These hematophagous organisms such as malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.), Rhodnius and Schistosoma digest haemoglobin and release high quantities of free heme, which is the non-protein component of hemoglobin. Heme is a prosthetic group consisting of an iron atom contained in the center of a heterocyclic porphyrin ring. Free heme is toxic to cells, so the parasites convert it into an insoluble crystalline form called hemozoin. In malaria parasites, hemozoin is often called malaria pigment. Since the formation of hemozoin is essential to the survival of these parasites, it is an attractive target for developing drugs and is much-studied in Plasmodium as a way to find drugs to treat malaria (malaria's Achilles' heel). Several currently used antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and mefloquine, are thought to kill malaria parasites by inhibiting haemozoin biocrystallization. Discovery Black-brown pigment was observed by Johann Heinrich Meckel in 1847, in the blood and spleen of a person suffering from insanity. However, it was not until 1849 that the presence of this pigment was connected to infection with malaria. Initially, it was thought that this pigment was produced by the body in response to infection, but Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran realized in 1880 that \\"malaria pigment\\" is, instead, produced by the parasites, as they multiplied within the red blood cell. The link between pigment and malaria parasites was used by Ronald Ross to identify the stages in the Plasmodium life cycle that occur within the mosquito, since, although these forms of the parasite are different in appearance to the blood stages, they still contain traces of pigment. Later, in 1891, T. Carbone and W.H. Brown (1911) published papers linking the hemoglobin degradation with pigment production, describing the malaria pigment as a form of hematin and disproving the widely held idea that it is related to melanin. Brown observed that all melanins were bleaching rapidly with potassium permanganate, while with this reagent malarial pigment manifests not the slightest sign of a true bleach reaction. The name \\"hemozoin\\" was proposed by Louis Westenra Sambon. In the 1930s several authors identified hemozoin as a pure crystalline form of Œ±-hematin and showed that the substance did not contain proteins within the crystals, but no explanation for the solubility differences between malaria pigment and Œ±-hematin crystals was given. Formation Human red blood cell infected by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, showing a residual body with brown hemozoin. During its intraerythrocytic asexual reproduction cycle Plasmodium falciparum consumes up to 80% of the host cell hemoglobin. The digestion of hemoglobin releases monomeric Œ±-hematin (ferriprotoporphyrin IX). This compound is toxic, since it is a pro-oxidant and catalyzes the production of reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress is believed to be generated during the conversion of heme (ferroprotoporphyrin) to hematin (ferriprotoporphyrin). Free hematin can also bind to and disrupt cell membranes, damaging cell structures and causing the lysis of the host erythrocyte. The unique reactivity of this molecule has been demonstrated in several in vitro and in vivo experimental conditions. Transport vesicle delivering a heme detoxification protein (hdp) to a malaria food vacuole (fv) containing crystals of hemozoin (hz). Scale bar is 0.5 ¬µm. The malaria parasite, therefore, detoxifies the hematin, which it does by biocrystallization‚Äîconverting it into insoluble and chemically inert Œ≤-hematin crystals (called hemozoin). In Plasmodium the food vacuole fills with hemozoin crystals, which are about 100-200 nanometres long and each contain about 80,000 heme molecules. Detoxification through biocrystallization is distinct from the detoxification process in mammals, where an enzyme called heme oxygenase instead breaks excess heme into biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the production of hemozoin in Plasmodium, and the area is highly controversial, with membrane lipids, histidine-rich proteins, or even a combination of the two, being proposed to catalyse the formation of hemozoin. Other authors have described a Heme Detoxification Protein, which is claimed to be more potent than either lipids or histidine-rich proteins. It is possible that many processes contribute to the formation of hemozoin. The formation of hemozoin in other blood-feeding organisms is not as well-studied as in Plasmodium. However, studies on Schistosoma mansoni have revealed that this parasitic worm produces large amounts of hemozoin during its growth in the human bloodstream. Although the shapes of the crystals are different from those produced by malaria parasites, chemical analysis of the pigment showed that it is made of hemozoin. In a similar manner, the crystals formed in the gut of the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus during digestion of the blood meal also have a unique shape, but are composed of hemozoin. Hz formation in R. prolixus midgut occurs at physiologically relevant physico-chemical conditions and lipids play an important role in heme biocrystallization. Autocatalytic heme crystallization to Hz is revealed to be an inefficient process and this conversion is further reduced as the Hz concentration increases. Isolated P.falciparum hemozoin Several other mechanisms have been developed to protect a large variety of hematophagous organisms against the toxic effects of free heme. Mosquitoes digest their blood meals extracellularly and do not produce hemozoin. Heme is retained in the peritrophic matrix, a layer of protein and polysaccharides that covers the midgut and separates gut cells from the blood bolus. Although Œ≤-hematin can be produced in assays spontaneously at low pH, the development of a simple and reliable method to measure the production of hemozoin has been difficult. This is in part due to the continued uncertainty over what molecules are involved in producing hemozoin, and partly from the difficulty in measuring the difference between aggregated or precipitated heme, and genuine hemozoin. Current assays are sensitive and accurate, but require multiple washing steps so are slow and not ideal for high-throughput screening. However, some screens have been performed with these assays. Structure Structure of hemozoin, showing hydrogen bonds between hematin units as dotted lines, and coordinate bonds between iron atoms and carboxylate side chains as red lines Electron micrograph of crystals of hemozoin isolated from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Magnified 68,490 times. Hemozoin is produced by template mediated crystallization (\\"biocrystallization\\"). Œ≤-Hematin crystals are made of dimers of hematin molecules that are, in turn, joined together by hydrogen bonds to form larger structures. In these dimers, an iron-oxygen coordinate bond links the central iron of one hematin to the oxygen of the carboxylate side-chain of the adjacent hematin. These reciprocal iron‚Äìoxygen bonds are highly unusual and have not been observed in any other porphyrin dimer. Œ≤-Hematin can be either a cyclic dimer or a linear polymer, a polymeric form has never been found in hemozoin, disproving the widely held idea that hemozoin is produced by the enzyme heme-polymerase. Hemozoin crystals have a distinct triclinic structure and are weakly magnetic. The difference between diamagnetic low-spin oxyhemoglobin and paramagnetic hemozoin can be used for isolation. They also exhibit optical dichroism, meaning they absorb light more strongly along their length than across their width, enabling the automated detection of malaria. Hemozoin is produced in a form that, under the action of an applied magnetic field, gives rise to an induced optical dichroism characteristic of the hemozoin concentration; and precise measurement of this induced dichroism (Magnetic circular dichroism) may be used to determine the level of malarial infection. Inhibitors Drug heme interaction Hemozoin formation is an excellent drug target, since it is essential to malaria parasite survival and absent from the human host. The drug target hematin is host-derived and largely outside the genetic control of the parasite, which makes the development of drug resistance more difficult. Many clinically used drugs are thought to act by inhibiting the formation of hemozoin in the food vacuole. This prevents the detoxification of the heme released in this compartment, and kills the parasite. The best-understood examples of such hematin biocrystallization inhibitors are quinoline drugs such as chloroquine and mefloquine. These drugs bind to both free heme and hemozoin crystals, and therefore block the addition of new heme units onto the growing crystals. The small, most rapidly growing face is the face to which inhibitors are believed to bind. Role in pathophysiology Hemozoin is released into the circulation during reinfection and phagocytosed in vivo and in vitro by host phagocytes and alters important functions in those cells. Most functional alterations were long-term postphagocytic effects, including erythropoiesis inhibition shown in vitro. By contrast, a powerful, short-term stimulation of oxidative burst by human monocytes was also shown to occur during phagocytosis of nHZ.

Underwood House is a historic house located in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood Northwest, Washington, D.C.. It is nationally significant for its association with Major Archibald Butt, (Military Aide to both Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft), and painter Francis Davis Millet, (both who died in the Titanic disaster on April 15, 1912) and also Alabama politician Oscar Underwood (1862-1929) who lived here 1914-25, also as the first long-term home of the Washington College of Law, the nation's first law school founded and run by women. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and The building presently houses a legal aid clinic operated by George Washington University. Description and history The Oscar Underwood House stands in Washington's Foggy Bottom neighborhood, at the southwest corner of G and 20th Streets NW. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a mansard roof providing a full third floor over its main block. It is one of three similar row houses extending along G Street. Its main facade is three bays wide, with the entrance in the rightmost bay. The entrance and windows are set in segmented-arch openings with bracketed and eared stone hoods, the windows with bracketed sills. The mansard roof is pierced by dormers on both the front and side, with round-arch windows framed by pilastered and pedimented gables. The interior retains some of its original finishes, with larger rooms subdivided into offices. The house is the only known residence to survive relatively intact from the period of its association with Oscar Underwood. Underwood was a rare conservative Southern Democrat at the height of his influence in the first decades of the 20th century. He served in major leadership positions in both houses of Congress, and was several times a serious contender for the Democrat nomination for President of the United States. In 1926 he retired to the Woodlawn plantation. After Underwood left the house, it was acquired by the Washington College of Law. It was founded in 1898 by Ellen Spencer Mussey and Emma Gillett, who were both refused admission to several law schools but eventually entered the bar despite that handicap. Working with limited financial resources, the school occupied a number of inadequate quarters for the first quarter century of its existence, eventually raising funds in 1920 for its first permanent home on K Street. It soon outgrew that, and purchased this building from Senator Underwood in 1924. It remained the school's home until 1952, having merged into the American University in 1949. Some of the school's many early female graduates were instrumental in legal aspects of gaining women's suffrage in the 1910s and 1920s.

She was Kammers√§ngerin at the Vienna State Opera and performed internationally.  Early life  Zadek, the oldest of three daughters of Elizabeth (Freundlich) and Alex Zadek, was born in Bromberg, Province of Posen, on 15 December 1917. After her hometown became Polish after World War I, her parents moved to Stettin in 1920, where Zadek spent her youth.

Like his two previous novels, it is an eponymous tale (the title of the novel is the same as the name of the hero). More than either Caleb Williams or St. Leon, however, Fleetwood is intended as a criticism of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his ideas about the virtue of natural man. Like Emile, the protagonist of Rousseau's treatise on education, Fleetwood is raised in the supposedly ideal world of nature. However, what is ideal for Rousseau turns out to be problematic in Fleetwood. The novel, in a bildungsroman style, follows the problematic consequences of the hero's natural education.  Plot  Casimir Fleetwood lives in Merionethshire, North Wales, on a large estate near Cader Idris in the early to mid-eighteenth century and is brought up as an only child. While on the grand tour, he visits his father's old friend, Monsieur Ruffigny, in Switzerland, who is a thinly disguised portrait of Rousseau. While he is there, his father dies, and Ruffigny decides to accompany Casimir back to Wales and tells the story of his life and how he became friends with Casimir's father during the journey. At 45 years old, he marries Mary Macneil, whose family have all died in a shipwreck. Casimir finds it difficult to adjust to married life and his wife is much younger. He invites his distant cousins, Kenrick and Gifford. Casimir is unaware that Gifford's aim is to discredit his brother, and to become Casimir's heir. Mary becomes pregnant by the time the men come to stay, but Casimir imagines she is having an affair with Kenrick, prompted by Gifford's insinuations. Casimir frequently alludes to Othello in his account of this affair. After acting as a go-between for Kenrick and her friend, Louisa Scarborough, Mary is accused of adultery and is divorced by her husband, who goes to France. Kenrick and Casimir arranges to meet Gifford in Paris. As he approaches the city, however, Casimir is set upon by men who drag him from his carriage. Louisa's father arrives, denounces Gifford and reveals that Kenrick rescued Casimir from the attackers and Gifford was the shooter. Scarborough has proof that Kenrick and Mary are innocent. Casmir forgives Kenrick and is introduced to his baby son. He makes a will, giving his wife his possessions, Kenrick an estate worth ¬£18,000, and says he plans to live in the Pyrenees on ¬£400 a year. Mary arrives and they are reconciled. Gifford is executed in France as a highwayman and a swindler. Kenrick and Louisa marry.  Sources  *Godwin, William. Fleetwood: Or, The New Man of Feeling. Ed. Gary Handwerk and A. A. Markley.

Located from Stortinget, the station is served by Line 3 of the metro, normally with a fifteen-minute headway. Travel time to Stortinget is 22 minutes. The station is a popular park and ride site, with 200 parking places. The station opened on 4 November 1924 as part of the Lilleaker Line. It has since 1942 been connected to the city via the Common Tunnel, thus becoming part of the Kols√•s Line. The station was closed due to budgetary cuts for part of 2003 and 2004, and then closed for renovations from 1 July 2006. The station opened, along with the upgraded track from Bekkestua, on 8 October 2012, after investments of 113 million were used on the section. The upgrades included lengthening the station to six-car platforms and making it accessible. History Class C train approaching Gj√∏nnes in 1980 Gj√∏nnes Station was built as part of what was then part of the Lilleaker Line. The tramway had been built to Lilleaker in 1919. However, there were also proposals of extending the R√∏a Line along the western end of the Kols√•s Line. After a major debate the Lillaker alternative was selected by the municipal council in 1921. At first only the extension to Bekkestua was permitted, but on 28 December 1922 B√¶rum Municipal Council approved a further extension past Gj√∏nnes to Haslum. Construction was carried out by Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei, which later became B√¶rumsbanen. The original station received a small building with a kiosk, telephone, ticket sales and freight handling. The line past Gj√∏nnes opened on 4 November 1924. At the time the line was only single track and the station platforms were long enough to handle one-car trains. Development of housing in the area commenced in 1928, when L√∏n√•s bought a forest and started redeveloping it into lots for single dwellings. Freight handling was terminated in 1947. With the delivery of the T1300, the Gj√∏nnes Station was upgraded to handle the new units ahead of 1981. This included raising the platforms height and lengthening them. Budgetary disagreements between local politicians in Oslo, B√¶rum and Akershus led to the closure of the Bekkestua to Kols√•s leg on 1 July 2003. The move was little popular with the patrons and followed by protests. A political agreement was thereby struck, allowing services to Kols√•s to resume from 20 November 2004. However, the line was in such poor shape that the speed was reduced several places. With the opening of the Ring Line on 20 August 2006, the Kols√•s Line's trains were needed there and services along the line were closed. Akershus County Municipality considered several options, including connection the line to the tramway, before settling on upgrading the line to full metro standard. Damage to the station after the 19 October 2008 incident During the construction of the B√¶rum Tunnel of the Asker Line, Gj√∏nnes was used as a storage area for earthwork. This caused a land slip which pressed up earthwork a long section of one platform and track was pressed up , resulting in the other track lying on its side. During planning the municipality had considered lowering the parking lot. This would allow a second story to be built on top should there be need for increased capacity, while avoiding this structure from dominating the skyline. However, to not delay the construction process, this arrangement was dropped from the plans. The construction contract was awarded to Veidekke for 113 million Norwegian krone. This included construction of of right-of-way, including laying of new ballast, tracks and third rail. It also involved construction a culvert under the tracks for access to Gj√∏nnesparken and a bridge for B√¶rumsveien. Construction ran from May 2011 through August 2012. An all-new station structure was included in the work. Construction was made more complicated because of difficult geological conditions. The upgraded station was officially opened on 8 August 2012. Its opening was the shortest of the eight steps which the Kols√•s Line was reopening in. Because of this Sporveien T-banen skipped using a pilot on board the trains for the first time the train drivers ran on the new line. The opening did not alter the number of trains used on Line 2. Gj√∏nnes was the terminus of the Kols√•s Line until 15 December 2013. STBO tram at Gj√∏nnes in 1977 The park and ride facility at Gj√∏nnes was popular and became congested. A contributing cause was that Gj√∏nnes is located within fare zone 1, but close to the border of zone 2. Thus people living across from the border could save 500 kroner each month by driving to Gj√∏nnes. This spurred Akershus County Municipality to question whether free park and ride was a good solution. Each parking place costs on average 250,000 kroner and many people drove short distances to reach the station. In addition it receives a fair amount of traffic from Rykkinn and Lommedalen. The pressure on the park and ride was significantly reduced after the line was extended to Haslum and Avl√∏s on 15 December 2013, where a combined 200 new parking places were built. The station is located next to Gj√∏nnes Farm, which is situated between it and Bekkestua. A section of the farm was sold to Skanska in 2011 to allow construction of housing. It was originally zoned for single dwellings, but in December 2012 the municipal council approved that the section closest to the station could be used for condominiums, increasing the number of residences from 40 to 150. This results in eight condo buildings with up to five stories. The remaining part of the lot will be used for 50 single dwellings and semi- detachments. Allowing apartments was controversial; neighbors protested, arguing that the condos would be visible and that it would encourage elderly to settle in the area. The municipal council's majority underlined the need for dense development close to transit stations and that apartments would, unlike houses, allow middle-income families and pensioners to live in the vicinity of Bekkestua. Service T1300 train at Gj√∏nnes in 2006 Gj√∏nnes is served by Line 3 of the Oslo Metro. During regular hours, is operates at a 15-minute headway. Travel time to Stortinget is 22 minutes. Operations are carried out by Sporveien T-banen on contract with Ruter, the public transport authority in Oslo and Akershus. The infrastructure itself is owned by Sporveien, a municipal company. Service is provided using MX3000 three- and six-car trains. The station had an average 169 boarding passengers in 2002, making it the least-used station on the Kols√•s Line and the fourth-least busy on the entire metro network. It is located in fare zone 1. Facilities Gj√∏nnes is a rapid transit station situated on the Kols√•s Line, from Stortinget in the city center. The station meets the metro standard of the Oslo Metro. This includes two side platforms and an overpass. The station is constructed in massive concrete. Gj√∏nnes is one of the main park and ride stations along the Kols√•s Line. Next to the station is a parking lot with 200 free parking spaces.

It connects Wandsworth High Street to Tooting Broadway and is approximately long. It passes through Earlsfield and Summerstown, before their late 19th century development, fields of Wandsworth.  Description  Garratt Lane has mixed usage along its length. In the north it contains newly developed stores including a large single-storey shopping mall with parking above. The stretch between Allfarthing Lane and Burntwood Lane is mainly diverse shophouses including a few professional services. The southern portion is mainly residential, although around Summertown there are a few light industries and the Wimbledon Stadium. The southernmost part of Garratt Lane is unusual in that two parallel streets exchanged names. The original Garratt Lane was a narrower street than Garratt Terrace, which was the main connection to Tooting Broadway. Many people mistakenly called it Garratt Lane, so it was agreed to exchange the names. The south-east end of Garratt Lane, running from the junction with Fountain Road and Upper Tooting Road was previously called Defoe Road. Garrat Elections The Leather Bottle, Earlsfield Most large public houses have survived along Garratt Lane, including The Old Sergeant and the Leather Bottle, both of which date to the 18th century. The latter figured in the mock Garrat Elections of the late 18th century, which were featured in the play The Mayor of Garratt by Samuel Foote.The Mayor of Garratt Google books. Retrieved 2014-11-12  Transportation  Garratt Lane is one of three major north‚Äìsouth routes in south-west Inner London, i.e. between the Lambeth/Southwark south bank areas and the gradual widening and receiving of local roads to the arterial A3, west of Wandsworth. The Lane follows a bank of the River Wandle so has quite a consistent rise as with the parallel A218 on the higher, western bank. Industries grew up in the 18th and 19th centuries along this east bank, which led to its prominence. A 1741 map of Rocque shows a road with a near identical orientation, which strongly implies the road had early origins. A 1786 map Carey's map of The Environs of London sheet 34 shows and names Garratt Lane running approximately on its present route. This map also shows two lanes that intersect named: Half Farthing (now Allfarthing) and Burnt Wood (now one word). The sub-settlement on its length was Garratt Green, Wandsworth. In 1803 the first commercial railway in Britain was opened along much of the northern section. This was the Surrey Iron Railway which connected the Thames at Wandsworth with these industries, and those in Merton and Croydon. No sign remains of the railway which was horse-drawn. Public transport in the form of horse buses was placed on the street in the latter part of the 19th century, and in 1903 the London County Council (LCC) extended and electrified the tramways. The trams started at the Thames near Westminster and went west and southwest on three route, one through Clapham Junction to Wandsworth, another through Brixton to Streatham, and one through Balham to Wimbledon. The routes through Garratt Lane connected all three with the focal point being Tooting. When the London Passenger Transport Board was formed in 1933 to control all of London's transport, route 12 (from Tooting to London Bridge via Wandsworth & Battersea) and route 30 (from Tooting to Shepherds Bush via Putney) ran the length of Garratt Lane. These routes were transformed to trolleybus (612 and 630) routes in 1937. Again the mode of transport changed in 1960s, with buses (No 44 & 220 (later replaced by the 270) respectively) replacing the trolleybuses. This pattern of change occurred throughout London although now there is a tendency towards tramway (or street railways) existing in Croydon and proposed elsewhere. The railway crosses Garratt Lane at Earlsfield Station and the nearest Underground station is Tooting Broadway just opposite the south end of Garratt Lane.  Buildings listed by the Borough  There are four listed properties on Garratt Lane: * The Old Court House near Wandsworth High Street is set back from Garratt Lane by a small public garden. It held the Wandsworth Museum until 2008, when it was converted into a public library. * St Andrews Church is in Earlsfield and is the Church of England parish church * The Leather Bottle Public House, at Summers Green, has historic connections. It is documented as being in existence in 1745, but is probably older. Its appearance has changed little over the last 150 years. One of the engravings by Valentine Green, shows election of a Mayor of Garratt (1781) in front of the Leather Bottle. * St Clement Danes Almshouses is also known as Diprose Lodge. It is within a walled estate in Earlsfield. The Almshouses are now owned and operated by the Borough of Merton.

O'Conor III House, also referred to as \\"Riverbend\\" and \\"Buena Vista,\\" is a historic home in the city of Ottawa, Illinois, United States. The structure that exists today was originally constructed in 1848 and underwent major remodeling in 1922. The house was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1993. History The original house at the site was constructed sometime in the early 1840s by Henry Green, a New Hampshire native who settled in Ottawa around 1834. While Green had built three different homes on the site, the Italianate mansion he completed by 1848 is the only structure that still exists. Henry Green sold this Italianate mansion to William H.W. Cushman in 1848. Cushman named the home \\"Buena Vista,\\" and lived there with his family until he sold it to N.B. Bristol in 1869. The property changed hands several times, and passed under the ownership of Oliver Cromwell Gray, Hiram Thornton Gilbert, James W. Duncan, and Martha L. Buell. Ottawa attorney Andrew J. O'Conor III bought the house and property in 1920. The O'Conor's, who renamed the home \\"Riverbend,\\" completed an extensive renovation of the home in 1923. The result was a house surrounded by a spacious yard with a commanding view of the Fox River.Koban, Andr√©e-Marie A. \\"Andrew J. O'Conor III House\\", (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, March 12, 1993, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, accessed May 12, 2008. Architecture The O'Conor House was designed by native Ottawan Norman Cook, a lifelong friend of the O'Conor family who designed several other significant buildings in LaSalle County. The Colonial Revival O'Conor House has in its windows, cornices and entrances the principal areas of Colonial Revival style. Historic significance The Andrew J. O'Conor was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on April 22, 1993. It is most significant for its architecture, which is one of the best remaining examples of the colonial revival style in the area. Several of its previous owners have served in the Illinois General Assembly. While there are many anecdotes and stories about President Abraham Lincoln visiting the home on several occasions when he was in Ottawa throughout his life, including appearances in Ottawa before the Illinois State Supreme Court in June 1851 and December 1852, so far there is no definitive documentary evidence that proves Abraham Lincoln visited or stayed in the home, but there is a strong likelihood. Ottawa businessman William H.W. Cushman and his third wife, Anna Caesaria Rodney, lived in the home from 1848 until it was sold in 1869. Rodney, the daughter of U.S. Attorney General Caesar Augustus Rodney and granddaughter of Thomas Rodney, was well connected to the prominent political figures and families of the United States throughout the 19th Century, including Mary Todd and her future husband, Abraham Lincoln. Prior to her 1843 marriage to Cushman, Rodney was one of three bridesmaids to Mary Todd Lincoln in her wedding to Abraham Lincoln in Springfield, Illinois on November 4, 1842.

Plot Ankit (Nikhil) is a carefree youngster who likes to live on his terms. He aspires to become a renowned musician. His parents support him. Pallavi (Megha Burman) is an exact opposite of Ankit. While Ankit believes in living life to the fullest, without a care in the world, Pallavi is seen working hard all the time. She is a software engineer in a big multinational. The two are childhood friends and they have three other common friends. One wants to go to the US at any cost and is all the time making trips to the US consulate for a visa. The other wants to do social service. The third dreams of starting his own business but does not know what business to enter. Over a period of time, Ankit and Palavi fall in love. But Pallavi does not like the carefree attitude of Ankit and his casual approach to life. She chides him for this and tells him that unless he takes his life seriously, she will leave him.

It is known from fewer than 500 plants growing along a single drainage line in the Croajingolong National Park. Description Banksia croajingolensis is usually a small, spreading shrub that typically grows to high, wide, forms a lignotuber and produces suckers. It has narrow egg-shaped leaves, narrower at the base, long and wide. The leaves are dark green on the upper surface, covered with white hairs on the lower surface and sometimes have a few short teeth on the edges. The flowers are yellow, borne on a spike long and wide when the flowers open. Each flower has a perianth long a pistil long. Flowering occurs from June to August and the fruit is an elliptical follicle long, high and that usually open when mature. This banksia is similar in appearance to B. paludosa (swamp banksia), and to a lesser extent B. integrifolia (coast banksia) and B. marginata (silver banksia). However it differs from these species in having flowers that open from the top of the inflorescence, rather than from the bottom up. It is also known to hybridise with B. integrifolia. Taxonomy The Gippsland banksia was first formally described in 2007 by Bill Molyneux and Susan G. Forrester, based on specimens they collected above Shipwreck Creek in Croajingolong National Park on 24 August 2005. The specific epithet is from Croajingolong, an English corruption of Krowathunkoolong, the Gunai name for the region in which the species occurs, and -ensis, a Latin suffix meaning \\"originating from\\". The specific epithet croajingolongensis was unappealing, so Molyneux and Forrester followed the lead of Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill, who used the contracted form croajingolensis when they published Eucalyptus croajingolensis in 1990. Molyneux and Forrester did not attempt an infrageneric placement for B. croajingolensis, but noted that all characters except the flowering sequence are consistent with its placement within B. sect. Banksia in George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia. There was no attempt to place it within the phylogenetics-informed arrangement of Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges. Distribution and habitat Banksia croajingolensis is known to occur only along a single drainage line in coastal heathland above the south bank of Shipwreck Creek in Croajingolong National Park, East Gippsland. About 480 individual plants are known. Conservation status The species has not been formally assessed for the IUCN Red List, but Molyneux and Forrester assessed it against the Red List criteria as warranting \\"Vulnerable\\" ranking, because of its small population size and its restricted range.

It is a partial agonist of benzodiazepine receptors and was shown in 1984 to possess both anxiolytic and sedative properties in humans but was never marketed. Properties The initial doses of premazepam given to human test subjects demonstrated similar psychological test results to those produced by diazepam. It was also demonstrated that initial dosing with premazepam produces similar sedative effects as compared with diazepam, although psychomotor impairments are greater with premazepam than with diazepam after initial dosing. However, with repeated dosing for more than one day premazepam causes less sedation and less psychomotor impairment than diazepam. Premazepam possesses sedative and anxiolytic properties. Premazepam produces more slow wave and less fast wave EEG changes than diazepam. Tests have shown that 7.5 mg of premazepam is approximately equivalent to 5 mg of diazepam. Pharmacology Premazepam is a pyrrolodiazepine benzodiazepine and acts as a partial agonist at benzodiazepine receptors. The mean time taken to reach peak plasma levels is 2 hours and the mean half life of premazepam in humans is 11.5 hours. About 90% of the drug is excreted in unchanged form. Of the remaining 10% of the drug none of the metabolites showed any pharmacological activity. Thus premazepam produces no active metabolites in humans.

In 1942 he made a series of renowned recordings conducting the orchestra of the State Opera with the Austrian soprano Maria Reining.Austro Mechana: Lebendige Vergangenheit recordings no.LV1315. A reliable, unaffected and deeply sympathetic conductor, Moralt was responsible for a high standard of repertory performances in Vienna for almost twenty years. Though overshadowed by the more famous conductors of his time, he nevertheless achieved many notable performances, especially of works by Mozart, Wagner, Strauss, Pfitzner. He appeared frequently at the Salzburg Festival, and as guest in many other European cities and in South America. His records include a celebrated Ring Cycle, a notable Don Giovanni and a superbly played Salome which shows how exceptional his musicianship could be when he had adequate rehearsal time. This little-known recording is amongst the best realizations of the opera, marred only by the fresh but slightly flat singing of Wegner. He died in Vienna, aged 56.

She was a daughter of silk manufacturer William Skinner (1824-1902) and his second wife, the former Sarah Elizabeth Allen (1834-1908). Belle Skinner was a humanitarian and music-lover whose life her brother William memorialized in the construction of the Skinner Hall of Music at Vassar College in 1932. She lived most of her life at the family home, Wistariahurst, in Holyoke, Massachusetts, now a historic site. She renovated and expanded this house to reflect her interests, including adding the music room, where she housed her musical instrument collection, now housed at Yale University. In 1902 she and her sister Katherine established the Skinner Coffee House in honor of their late father, the coffee house initially hosted women working in the Skinner mills for social, service, and educational activities but gradually became a meeting place for dozens of men's and women's clubs, the 4-H Club, neighborhood organizations, children's groups, and dancing clubs. After the first world war, Belle Skinner helped rebuild the small town of Hattonch√¢tel and Ch√¢teau de Hattonch√¢tel. In return for her efforts following the war, Ms. Skinner was presented the M√©daille de la Reconnaissance fran√ßaise by future French president and then-commissioner general of Alsace-Lorraine, Alexandre Millerand, in January 1919, at the ministry of foreign affairs in Paris. She also led the effort to rally American cities to adopt French villages during the postwar reconstruction, establishing the American Committee of Villages Lib√©r√©s in New York City later that year. Holyoke would be the first city to take part in the program, providing a water supply to the village of Apremont-la-For√™t. Two years later on January 26, 1921, she was decorated with the rank of Chevalier in the L√©gion d'honneur for her continued aid to the French people. While her acts of charity to the French village received general praise and influenced other towns and cities to follow suit, they also drew the ire of nativists and anti- Catholicists, the Klan publication The Fiery Cross lambasted Skinner's efforts \\"to throw away one million excellent American dollars on two hundred French peasants when a few thousands of that sum would have built them good comfortable homes...is little less than a crime against one's country\\". Ultimately Skinner would contribute greatly to her alma mater, providing Vassar College with the first fellowship for foreign studies in 1926, $10,000 for graduates to study history in France, as she had spent time in Paris as a young girl herself soon after her own graduation. While travelling to France to oversee the completion of the Hattonch√¢tel restoration, Ms. Skinner contracted pneumonia and died on April 9, 1928, her death being reported by papers all across France and the United States.

After playing in the orchestra of The Grange Cinema, Kilburn, she played in Harold Ramsey's Girl Friends, and Teddy Foster's Band. She formed her own band in 1938 and won a contract, against great competition, in 1942, to provide a 12-piece girls' band at The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, which was converted into dance-hall for British and American service personnel. She featured in regular radio broadcasts, including Saturday night at the Palais, Ocean Revue of 1946 and the Sandown Summer Show (1947). In 1947 her band was the resident band at 'Radio-Olympia' designed to stimulate interest in the newly revived BBC TV service. After this she led the resident band in Beach Ballroom Aberdeen, between 1948 and 1950 with John Hanson, a popular guest singer. In the early 1950s, after much seaside work, she and her band were invited to entertain the US Army in Germany.

The home ground of Workington A.F.C., it has a capacity of 3,101, of which 500 is seated. History Borough Park was built with the assistance of the local council, and opened in 1937, with Workington moving from their previous Lonsdale Park ground, which was next to Borough Park. The ground initially consisted of a 1,000 seat main stand on the western touchline, and banking around the remainder of the pitch, but by 1951 the embankments had been converted to terracing, and two more stands erected in the north-west and south-west corners of the ground.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888‚Äì2005, Yore Publications, p26, Workington were elected to the Football League in 1951, and the first League match at Borough Park saw them defeat Chesterfield 3‚Äì1 in front of 11,000 spectators. The ground underwent further expansion during the 1950s as the main stand was extended and the terracing on the eastern side of the pitch was roofed in 1956. The record attendance of 21,000 was set on 4 January 1958 for an FA Cup match against Manchester United. The League record attendance of 18,628 was set for a local derby against Carlisle United on 26 December 1963. Workington were voted out of the League in 1977 and replaced by Wimbledon F.C. The main stand was closed and the roof removed in 1988. Borough Park was also the home of the town's rugby league club Workington Town from when they formed after the Second World War in 1945 until they moved out in 1956 and into their own new ground nearby, Derwent Park, where they remain today.

P. Lovecraft and contributions to David Day's Tolkien- inspired compendiums, work for Fighting Fantasy gamebooks and various role- playing and wargaming publications, as well as contributions to the Ralph Bakshi films Wizards and Cool World.  Early life  Miller was born in 1946, and raised predominantly in London and Manchester. His mother, who encouraged the artistic vocation, was a theatrical milliner for one of the leading costumiers to the film industry, which, with cinema, he cites as an early inspiration: As a child Miller experimented with coloured pencils and poster paints producing images of Ancient Egyptians during something he refers to as his 'Ancient Egyptian Phase', followed later by an obsession with cowboys and Indians. At the age of nine Miller attended Mortbane Academy for Boys in Invernesshire, Scotland, where he recalls regular painting expeditions to the surrounding countryside under the tutelage of the art master, nicknamed 'Old Dribble'. Between 1964 and 1967 he enrolled at Northwich School of Art, before embarking on a degree at Saint Martin's School of Art in London, where he began in sculpture before switching to painting, and graduating with honours in 1970. Shortly after this he was taken on by an agent and began working in London as a professional illustrator.  Career  Miller's earliest work included magazine and book jacket illustrations, including a host of illustrations for paperback titles by H.P.Lovecraft, and work for Men Only and Club International. In 1975 and 1976 whilst Miller was staying in San Francisco, he was approached by Ralph Bakshi and invited to contribute to the film Wizards. Miller relocated to Los Angeles and worked on the animated movie, later citing it as an experience that left a profound impression upon him. He later went on to work on Bakshi's film Cool World in the 1980s, produce pre-production work for the film Shrek in the 1990s, and contribute designs and illustrations to the 2005 film MirrorMask. Death on the Reik, which featured as the cover of the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay campaign instalment of the same name, and exhibiting Miller's line and wash method, restricted use of colour and the 'gnarled trees' Patrick Woodroffe refers to below. Miller is well known for his work for the Fighting Fantasy gamebooks which rose to popularity in the mid-1980s, providing covers for early titles in the series like The Citadel of Chaos, House of Hell and Creature of Havoc. He has also contributed to the Games Workshop-published fantasy gaming periodical White Dwarf in which he was featured in an Illuminations expos√© in issue 86, and provided numerous illustrations for various role-playing and war gaming books and supplements published by Games Workshop during the latter half of the 1980s, including the covers for Terror of the Lichmaster, Death on the Reik and Warhammer City for Warhammer, and a host of illustrations for the Realm of Chaos supplement and the first edition of Warhammer 40,000. In the following decades Miller went on to provide further illustrations for gaming lines published by other companies, including the Everway, Shadowrun, and Earthdawn RPGs. Miller has illustrated cards for the Magic: The Gathering collectible card game. Miller is also noted for his Tolkien-inspired illustrations, and contributed to the lavishly illustrated A Tolkien Bestiary and Characters from Tolkien ‚Äì A Bestiary, and has provided illustrations for British science fiction periodical Interzone and cover and interior images for SF titles like Alien Stories 2 by Dennis Pepper. A number of anthologies of Miller's work have been published over the years. His first, with James Slattery, The Green Dog Trumpet and Other Stories, was published by Dragon's Dream in 1979, and was followed by another, Secret Art, and a third, entitled Ratspike, co-authored with fellow illustrator and Games Workshop art director John Blanche and published by GW Books. Miller has also produced imagery for two graphic novels, the first, The Luck in the Head, with writer M. John Harrison and a second with James Herbert called The City, as well as working on an unpublished third called Suzie Pellet. Miller has exhibited frequently during his career in both solo shows and group exhibitions in Britain and internationally. Current projects include the production of a series of black and white panel drawings called Corpus Pandemonium, and a book called The Broken Novel, a reworked film project called The Confessions of Carrie Sphagnum, a set of Tarot cards, and a theatre project entitled The Shingle Dance. Style and technique Miller's style is variously described as surreal, gothic and nightmarish or grotesque. \\"Edgy and surreal, Miller combines intelligent geometric exactness with a messy, fluid sense of what it means to be human.\\" As fellow contemporary illustrator Patrick Woodroffe comments in the introduction to Blanche and Miller's Ratspike: An illustration from Miller's Hollywood Gothic series, combining forms derived from fish and mechanical elements. According to Miller, his illustrations have a tendency to the 'frontalistic', and are also noted to often feature recurrent elements inspired by fishes, flies and robotic forms, and the gnarled haunting trees which he claims originated in an attempt to cover failures of draughtsmanship. Says Miller of his work: Miller cites amongst his principal artistic influences Albrecht D√ºrer and Leonardo da Vinci, the German Expressionists and French Impressionists, as well as an early predilection for Japanese landscape artists. Other sources include the formative influence of writer Alfred Bester, and a love for the Flash Gordon RKO Radio serials, and his early exposure to the cinematic medium in general which he feels lent a narrative quality to his work, as well as, of course, the every day world itself: Miller has experimented with various media during his career, but has a preference for pencils, technical pens, watercolour, and charcoal. \\"I found self- expression with the pen ‚Äì with oils it was quite the opposite.\\" He also occasionally combines collage and photography into his pieces. His best-known published work has tended to be characterised by a trademark pen-and-ink and wash technique executed on line board and which he refers to as his 'Tight Pen Style', emphasising line detail and a restricted use of colour, something he views as a result of both short-sightedness and Northern European proclivities: More recently he has taken to adding an Apple Macintosh computer to his range of tools.

Originally formed in June 1943 as the 93d Troop Carrier Squadron, the squadron participated on the Western Front flying Douglas C-47 Skytrains dropping paratroopers and releasing gliders during Operation Overlord, Operation Market Garden and the Siege of Bastogne before being inactivated in June 1946. The Makos were reactivated as a reserve squadron in June 1949, which they continue to be as of 2019. Between 1949 and 1989, the squadron flew a variety of types such as the Curtiss C-46 Commando, Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star and McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II. Since 1995, the Makos have flown the General Dynamics F-16C/D Fighting Falcon, in which they have conducted air superiority missions over Iraq as part of Operation Northern Watch and Operation Iraqi Freedom. History =World War II= The squadron was initially activated on 1 June 1943 under I Troop Carrier Command and equipped with Douglas C-47 Skytrains as the 93d Troop Carrier Squadron. It trained in various parts of the eastern United States until the end of 1943 when it was deployed to the United Kingdom and assigned to IX Troop Carrier Command. Prepared for the invasion of Nazi- occupied Europe. Began operations by dropping paratroops of the 101st Airborne Division in Normandy on D-Day (6 June 1944) and releasing gliders with reinforcements on the following day. The unit received a Distinguished Unit Citation and a French citation for these missions. After the Normandy invasion the squadron ferried supplies in the United Kingdom. After moving to France in September, the unit dropped paratroops of the 82nd Airborne Division near Nijmegen and towed gliders carrying reinforcements during the airborne attack on the Netherlands. In December, it participated in the Battle of the Bulge by releasing gliders with supplies for the 101st Airborne Division near Bastogne. When the Allies made the air assault across the Rhine River in March 1945, each aircraft towed two gliders with troops of the 17th Airborne Division and released them near Wesel. The squadron also hauled food, clothing, medicine, gasoline, ordnance equipment, and other supplies to the front lines and evacuated patients to rear zone hospitals. It converted from C-47s to C-46s and the new aircraft to transport displaced persons from Germany to France and Belgium after V-E Day. Returned to the U.S. during the period July‚ÄìSeptember 1945, and trained with Curtiss C-46 Commando aircraft until inactivated. =Air Force Reserve= Roosevelt Roads during Exercise Patriot Pearl, 1988. The squadron was reactivated as part of Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) at Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan, on 27 June 1949. From here they once again operated the C-46 Commando, training in troop carrier operations up until 3 April 1951. The squadron was reactivated as the 93d Fighter-Bomber Squadron on 15 June 1952, equipped with the North American F-51 Mustang. These were operated for only a year until the unit converted to their first jet ‚Äì Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star, which was operated up until 1956. Converting to the Republic F-84 Thunderjet, the squadron continued fighter-bomber operations up until 16 November 1957 when they were inactivated. After lying dormant for almost 21 years, the unit was reactivated at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, as the 93d Tactical Fighter Squadron on 1 October 1978. Initially assigned to the 915th Tactical Fighter Group, the Makos were equipped with the McDonnell Douglas F-4C Phantom II. On 1 April 1981, the 93d TFS were reassigned to the 482d Tactical Fighter Wing. Between 9 to 22 August 1980, the Makos deployed 12 F-4Cs to Bod√∏ Main Air Station, Norway, as part of Exercise Coronet Mil. The squadron converted to the F-4D Phantom II in 1983, continuing to maintain combat readiness in tactical fighter operations. The 93d TFS participated in Exercise Patriot Pearl at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, Puerto Rico in 1988. The Makos began to convert to the General Dynamics F-16A/B Fighting Falcon in November 1989. The squadron was re-designated as the 93d Fighter Squadron on 1 February 1992, the designation it holds to this day. The 93rd FS deployed eight F-16As to Aviano AFB, Italy, between 16 August and 12 September 1992. On 24 August 1992, Homestead Air Force Base was hit by Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, heavily damaging the base. The 93d FS evacuated the base and briefly operated from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, between September and December 1992 before relocating to MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, in February 1993 where the Makos remained until March 1994. The 93d FS finally returned home on 1 April 1994, when Homestead was reopened as Homestead Air Reserve Base. The Makos deployed eight F-16As to Karup Air Base, Denmark, between 5 and 18 June 1994 as part of Exercise Central Enterprise. The squadron converted over to the F-16C/D Fighting Falcon in 1995, with most of their old F-16A/B aircraft being retired to AMARC. The 93d FS were deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, to enforce the no-fly zone over northern Iraq as part of Operation Northern Watch in 1997, 1999 and 2000. They later deployed to Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, in 2001 as part of Operation Southern Watch. The squadron participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom when they were deployed alongside the 457th Fighter Squadron to Balad Air Base, Iraq, in 2007 and later in 2009. The 93rd FS participated in Exercise Iniohos at Andravida Air Base, Greece, between 27 March and 6 April 2017. While deployed they operated alongside the Hellenic, Israeli, Italian and the United Arab Emirates Air Forces. The Makos deployed 12 F-16Cs to RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk, in the United Kingdom between 5‚Äì21 May 2019 where they carried out dissimilar air combat training with F-15E Strike Eagles of the 492nd Fighter Squadron and RAF Typhoons. Across the two week deployment, the 93rd FS flew more than 180 hours across over 136 sorties.

It was written in 1938-39 as an \\"educational history film\\" for film director Gabriel Pascal in the aftermath of Pygmalions cinema triumph. The cast of the proposed film were to be sumptuously clothed in 17th century costumes, far beyond the resources of most theatre managements. However, by the time of its completion in May 1939, it had turned into a Shavian Restoration comedy.Bernard Shaw, Volume 3: The Lure of Fantasy by Michael Holroyd, Chatto and Windus, London (1991) The title of the play is taken from the first line of the traditional song \\"The Vicar of Bray\\".  Plot  A discussion play, the issues of nature, science, power and leadership are debated between King Charles II ('Mr Rowley'), Isaac Newton, George Fox and the artist Godfrey Kneller, with interventions by three of the king's mistresses (Barbara Villiers, 1st Duchess of Cleveland; Louise de K√©rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth; and Nell Gwynn). The short second Act involves Charles in conversation with his queen, Catherine of Braganza. Original production Billed as 'A history lesson in three scenes by Bernard Shaw', the first production was at the Malvern Festival Theatre on 12 August 1939, directed by H K Ayliff and designed by Paul Shelving. Cast: *Mrs Basham: Isobel Thornton *Sally: Betty Marsden *Isaac Newton: Cecil Trouncer *George Fox: Herbert Lomas *Mr Rowley (King Charles II): Ernest Thesiger *Nell Gwynn: Eileen Beldon *Barbara Villiers, 1st Duchess of Cleveland; Daphne Heard *Louise de K√©rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth: Ina De La Haye *James, Duke of York: William Hutchison *Godfrey Kneller: Alec Clunes *Queen Catherine of Braganza: Violet Vanbrugh Ayliff's production first transferred to the Streatham Hill Theatre on 15 April 1940, then to the New Theatre in London on 9 May 1940. James Agate, writing for The Sunday Times, noted that the play was the best to have \\"come from the Shavian loom since Methuselah\\". Revivals Ernest Thesiger, who again played 'Mr Rowley', revived the play at the Malvern Festival on 11 August 1949. It was also revived at the Malvern Festival Theatre in 1983. The first North American production was on 24 January 1957 at the Downtown Theater on New York's East 4th Street, where it ran for nearly two years, one of the longest runs of any Shaw play in the USA (as noted by Lawrence Langner). A BBC production in the Play of the Month series, starring Sir John Gielgud as King Charles, was broadcast in February 1970.

History The Fisher‚ÄìNash‚ÄìGriggs House, named for its first three owners, was built c. 1852-57 on Ottawa Avenue in Ottawa, Illinois. Between its construction and 1916 the home underwent a number of additions and renovations, all styled in Classical or Greek Revival.Gurlacz, Betsy. \\"Fisher‚ÄìNash‚ÄìGriggs House\\", (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, July 29, 1998, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, accessed May 12, 2008. George Smith Fisher had the northern part of the house built in the mid-1850s. It is thought to have been designed by Sylvanius Grow, who also designed the nearby John Hossack House. At some point before 1857, the Fishers added a dining room on the south. The house was expanded again in the early 1860s, extending farther south and adding a western bedroom and a summer kitchen. John Fiske Nash purchased the house in the 1870s and added a bathroom and vault area on the west wing. In 1910, the added an eastern bathroom, then extended the front porch with Ionic order columns two years later. In 1915, they added the porte-cochere on the east. The next year, they extended the east side and added a second floor. These were the last significant changes to the architecture of the house. Architecture The house is setback from Ottawa Avenue about ; the street itself is a boulevard and one of the widest in the city. Ottawa Avenue is divided by a grassy tree- dotted median which is crowned on its west end by a Classical Revival war memorial. The house, of brick construction, is an example of high-style Greek Revival architecture. Historic significance The house is significant for its architecture as a good local example of high-style Greek Revival architecture with Classical Revival updates.

The film is considered to be Gallaga's most significant contribution to the Philippine cinema. Set in the Philippine province of Negros during World War II, it tells the story of how two haciendero families cope with the changes brought about by the war. In translation, the movie is also known either as \\"Gold, Silver, Bad Luck\\" or \\"Gold, Silver, Death.\\" The title refers to an old Filipino architectural superstition saying that design elements in a house (particularly staircases) should not end in a multiple of three, in keeping with a pattern of oro (gold), plata (silver), and mata (bad luck). The film is structured in three parts that depict this pattern played out in the lives of the main characters, from a life of luxury and comfort in the city (\\"oro/gold\\"), to a still- luxurious time of refuge in a provincial hacienda (\\"plata/silver\\"), and finally to a retreat deeper into the mountains, where they are victimized by guerilla bandits (\\"mata/bad luck\\"). In 2013, ABS-CBN Film Archives in partnership with Central Digital Lab digitally restored and remastered the film and was subsequently released in select theaters for a limited period of time. The digitally restored version was also released on DVD and iTunes.  Plot  Oro, Plata, Mata traces the changing fortunes of two aristocratic families in Negros during World War II. The Ojeda family is celebrating Maggie Ojeda's (Andolong) debut. In the garden, Trining (Gil) receives her first kiss from Miguel Lorenzo (Torre), her childhood sweetheart. Don Claudio Ojeda (Ojeda) and his fellow landowners talk about the impending war. The celebration is cut short by news of the sinking of SS Corregidor by a mine. As the Japanese invasion force nears the city, the Ojedas accept the invitation extended by the Lorenzos, their old family friends, to stay with them in their provincial hacienda. Nena Ojeda (Lorena) and Inday Lorenzo (Asensio) try to deny the realities of war by preserving their pre-war lifestyle. Pining for her fianc√©, Maggie goes through bouts of melancholy. Miguel and Trining turn from naughty children into impetuous adults. Two more family friends, Jo Russell (Valdez)and Viring (Villanueva) join them. As the enemy advance, the families move to the Lorenzos forest lodge. A group of weary guerrillas arrive and Jo tends to their injuries. The guerrillas leave Hermes Mercurio (Lazaro) behind. Miguel endures more comments of the same kind when he fails to take action against a Japanese soldier who came upon the girls bathing in the river. It is Mercurio who kills the Japanese. Maggie comforts Miguel, who decides to learn how to shoot from Mercurio. Later, Viring's jewelry is stolen by Melchor (de la Cruz), the trusted foreman. He justifies his action as a reward for his services. He tries to break the other servants loyalty by telling them to join him, but they did not forcing Melchor to leave. Later, Melchor and his band of thieves return and make revenge to them. They raid the food supplies, rape Inday and chop off Viring's fingers when she does not take off her ring. Trining unexpectedly goes with the bandits despite all the crimes they have committed against her family. These experiences committed Maggie and Miguel closer together. Miguel urges the survivors to resume their mahjong games to help them cope with their trauma. Miguel is determined to hunt the bandits down and bring Trining back. He catches them in an abandoned hospital, but his courage is replaced with bloodlust, driving him to a killing spree. An epilogue follows the violent climax where Miguel and Mercurio finally killed Melchor and their remaining men. At last, in 1945, the Americans have liberated the Philippines from Japan. A party is held in the Ojeda home to announce Maggie and Miguel's betrothal. The survivors attempt to reclaim their previous lifestyle, but the war has changed the world, just as it has forever changed each of them.  Awards  The movie won the 1982 Gawad Urian awards for Best picture, direction, cinematography, production design, musical score, and sound. In the same year, it won the Luna Awards for Production Design and Best Supporting Actress (Liza Lorena). It is marketed as one of the top ten best films of the 1980s.Oro, Plata, Mata (1982) - Awards  Cast  *Cherie Gil as Trinidad \\"Trining\\" Ojeda *Sandy Andolong as Margarita \\"Maggie\\" Ojeda *Liza Lorena as Nena Ojeda *Fides Cuyugan-Asencio as Inday Lorenzo *Manny Ojeda as Don Claudio Ojeda *Maya Valdez as Jo Russell *Lorli Villanueva as Viring Ravillo *Ronnie Lazaro as Hermes Mercurio *Joel Torre as Miguel Lorenzo *Abbo de la Cruz as Melchor *Jaime Fabregas as Minggoy *Robert Antonio as Carlos Placido *Agustin Gatia as Lucio *Kuh Ledesma as a diwata *Dave Muller as a fisherman  Symbolism  From the time the film was written to the people after Martial Law, Melchor's manners can be seen in two ways: * Socio-Political Perspectives of the '80s: In the era of civilization, the people's armies were not foreign, and by chance, the hostile foreign armies were weak (symbolizing the dying Japanese soldier that Miguel failed to kill). The cows of the people then are their own countrymen: Marcos' military and police forces. * Melchor's Marxist behavior: It was a warning that could happen to those at the highest levels of society, who dominated Filipino politics at the time. Meanwhile, the work of the New People's Army (NPA) (the terrorist army of the Communist Party of the Philippines) was at its strongest at the time of the film's release.

His style is awkward and unrefined, unlike the work of his contemporary, the Master of the Playing Cards. The drapery in his prints is stiff, and there is only a limited suggestion of space, creating an illusion that the figures are floating in mid-air.

In humans, it is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, below the diaphragm. Its other roles in metabolism include the regulation of glycogen storage, decomposition of red blood cells, and the production of hormones. The liver is an accessory digestive organ that produces bile, an alkaline fluid containing cholesterol and bile acids, which helps the breakdown of fat. The gallbladder, a small pouch that sits just under the liver, stores bile produced by the liver which is afterwards moved to the small intestine to complete digestion. The liver's highly specialized tissue, consisting of mostly hepatocytes, regulates a wide variety of high- volume biochemical reactions, including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex molecules, many of which are necessary for normal vital functions. Estimates regarding the organ's total number of functions vary, but textbooks generally cite it being around 500. It is not yet known how to compensate for the absence of liver function in the long term, although liver dialysis techniques can be used in the short term. Artificial livers are yet to be developed to promote long-term replacement in the absence of the liver. , liver transplantation is the only option for complete liver failure. Structure The liver is a reddish-brown, wedge-shaped organ with two lobes of unequal size and shape. A human liver normally weighs approximately and has a width of about . There is considerable size variation between individuals, with the standard reference range for men being and for women . It is both the heaviest internal organ and the largest gland in the human body. Located in the right upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity, it rests just below the diaphragm, to the right of the stomach and overlies the gallbladder. The liver is connected to two large blood vessels: the hepatic artery and the portal vein. The hepatic artery carries oxygen-rich blood from the aorta via the celiac trunk, whereas the portal vein carries blood rich in digested nutrients from the entire gastrointestinal tract and also from the spleen and pancreas. These blood vessels subdivide into small capillaries known as liver sinusoids, which then lead to lobules. Lobules are the functional units of the liver. Each lobule is made up of millions of hepatic cells (hepatocytes), which are the basic metabolic cells. The lobules are held together by a fine, dense, irregular, fibroelastic connective tissue layer extending from the fibrous capsule covering the entire liver known as Glisson's capsule. This extends into the structure of the liver by accompanying the blood vessels, ducts, and nerves at the hepatic hilum. The whole surface of the liver, except for the bare area, is covered in a serous coat derived from the peritoneum, and this firmly adheres to the inner Glisson's capsule. =Gross anatomy= Terminology related to the liver often starts in hepat- from ·º°œÄŒ±œÑŒø-, from the Greek word for liver. Lobes The liver, viewed from above, showing the left and right lobes separated by the falciform ligament The liver, viewed from below, surface showing four lobes and the impressions The liver is grossly divided into two parts when viewed from above ‚Äì a right and a left lobe - and four parts when viewed from below (left, right, caudate, and quadrate lobes). The falciform ligament makes a superficial division of the liver into a left and right lobe. From below, the two additional lobes are located between the right and left lobes, one in front of the other. A line can be imagined running from the left of the vena cava and all the way forward to divide the liver and gallbladder into two halves. This line is called Cantlie's line. Other anatomical landmarks include the ligamentum venosum and the round ligament of the liver, which further divide the left side of the liver in two sections. An important anatomical landmark, the porta hepatis, divides this left portion into four segments, which can be numbered starting at the caudate lobe as I in an anticlockwise manner. From this parietal view, seven segments can be seen, because the eighth segment is only visible in the visceral view. Surfaces On the diaphragmatic surface, apart from a triangular bare area where it connects to the diaphragm, the liver is covered by a thin, double-layered membrane, the peritoneum, that helps to reduce friction against other organs. This surface covers the convex shape of the two lobes where it accommodates the shape of the diaphragm. The peritoneum folds back on itself to form the falciform ligament and the right and left triangular ligaments. These peritoneal ligaments are not related to the anatomic ligaments in joints, and the right and left triangular ligaments have no known functional importance, though they serve as surface landmarks. The falciform ligament functions to attach the liver to the posterior portion of the anterior body wall. The visceral surface or inferior surface is uneven and concave. It is covered in peritoneum apart from where it attaches the gallbladder and the porta hepatis. The fossa of gall bladder lies to the right of the quadrate lobe, occupied by the gallbladder with its cystic duct close to the right end of porta hepatis. Impressions Impressions of the liver Several impressions on the surface of the liver accommodate the various adjacent structures and organs. Underneath the right lobe and to the right of the gallbladder fossa are two impressions, one behind the other and separated by a ridge. The one in front is a shallow colic impression, formed by the hepatic flexure and the one behind is a deeper renal impression accommodating part of the right kidney and part of the suprarenal gland. The suprarenal impression is a small, triangular, depressed area on the liver. It is located close to the right of the fossa, between the bare area and the caudate lobe, and immediately above the renal impression. The greater part of the suprarenal impression is devoid of peritoneum and it lodges the right suprarenal gland. Medial to the renal impression is a third and slightly marked impression, lying between it and the neck of the gall bladder. This is caused by the descending portion of the duodenum, and is known as the duodenal impression. The inferior surface of the left lobe of the liver presents behind and to the left of the gastric impression. This is moulded over the upper front surface of the stomach, and to the right of this is a rounded eminence, the tuber omentale, which fits into the concavity of the lesser curvature of the stomach and lies in front of the anterior layer of the lesser omentum. =Microscopic anatomy= Cells, ducts, and blood vessels Microscopic anatomy of the liver Types of capillaries‚Äìsinusoid on right Microscopically, each liver lobe is seen to be made up of hepatic lobules. The lobules are roughly hexagonal, and consist of plates of hepatocytes, and sinusoids radiating from a central vein towards an imaginary perimeter of interlobular portal triads. The central vein joins to the hepatic vein to carry blood out from the liver. A distinctive component of a lobule is the portal triad, which can be found running along each of the lobule's corners. The portal triad, consists of the hepatic artery, the portal vein, and the common bile duct. The triad may be seen on a liver ultrasound, as a Mickey Mouse sign with the portal vein as the head, and the hepatic artery, and the common bile duct as the ears. Histology, the study of microscopic anatomy, shows two major types of liver cell: parenchymal cells and nonparenchymal cells. About 70‚Äì85% of the liver volume is occupied by parenchymal hepatocytes. Nonparenchymal cells constitute 40% of the total number of liver cells but only 6.5% of its volume. The liver sinusoids are lined with two types of cell, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and phagocytic Kupffer cells. Hepatic stellate cells are nonparenchymal cells found in the perisinusoidal space, between a sinusoid and a hepatocyte. Additionally, intrahepatic lymphocytes are often present in the sinusoidal lumen. =Functional anatomy= Hilum of the liver, circled in yellow The central area or hepatic hilum, includes the opening known as the porta hepatis which carries the common bile duct and common hepatic artery, and the opening for the portal vein. The duct, vein, and artery divide into left and right branches, and the areas of the liver supplied by these branches constitute the functional left and right lobes. The functional lobes are separated by the imaginary plane, Cantlie's line, joining the gallbladder fossa to the inferior vena cava. The plane separates the liver into the true right and left lobes. The middle hepatic vein also demarcates the true right and left lobes. The right lobe is further divided into an anterior and posterior segment by the right hepatic vein. The left lobe is divided into the medial and lateral segments by the left hepatic vein. The hilum of the liver is described in terms of three plates that contain the bile ducts and blood vessels. The contents of the whole plate system are surrounded by a sheath. The three plates are the hilar plate, the cystic plate and the umbilical plate and the plate system is the site of the many anatomical variations to be found in the liver. =Couinaud classification system= Shape of human liver in animation, with eight Couinaud segments labelled In the widely used Couinaud system, the functional lobes are further divided into a total of eight subsegments based on a transverse plane through the bifurcation of the main portal vein. The caudate lobe is a separate structure that receives blood flow from both the right- and left-sided vascular branches. The Couinaud classification divides the liver into eight functionally independent liver segments. Each segment has its own vascular inflow, outflow and biliary drainage. In the centre of each segment are branches of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct. In the periphery of each segment is vascular outflow through the hepatic veins. The classification system uses the vascular supply in the liver to separate the functional units (numbered I to VIII) with unit 1, the caudate lobe, receiving its supply from both the right and the left branches of the portal vein. It contains one or more hepatic veins which drain directly into the inferior vena cava. The remainder of the units (II to VIII) are numbered in a clockwise fashion: = Gene and protein expression = About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and 60% of these genes are expressed in a normal, adult liver. Over 400 genes are more specifically expressed in the liver, with some 150 genes highly specific for liver tissue. A large fraction of the corresponding liver specific proteins are mainly expressed in hepatocytes and secreted into the blood and constitute plasma proteins. Other liver specific proteins are certain liver enzymes such as HAO1 and RDH16, proteins involved in bile synthesis such as BAAT and SLC27A5, and transporter proteins involved in the metabolism of drugs, such as ABCB11 and SLC2A2. Examples of highly liver-specific proteins include apolipoprotein A II, coagulation factors F2 and F9, complement factor related proteins, and the fibrinogen beta chain protein. Development Organogenesis, the development of the organs, takes place from the third to the eighth week during embryogenesis. The origins of the liver lie in both the ventral portion of the foregut endoderm (endoderm being one of the three embryonic germ layers) and the constituents of the adjacent septum transversum mesenchyme. In the human embryo, the hepatic diverticulum is the tube of endoderm that extends out from the foregut into the surrounding mesenchyme. The mesenchyme of septum transversum induces this endoderm to proliferate, to branch, and to form the glandular epithelium of the liver. A portion of the hepatic diverticulum (that region closest to the digestive tube) continues to function as the drainage duct of the liver, and a branch from this duct produces the gallbladder. Besides signals from the septum transversum mesenchyme, fibroblast growth factor from the developing heart also contributes to hepatic competence, along with retinoic acid emanating from the lateral plate mesoderm. The hepatic endodermal cells undergo a morphological transition from columnar to pseudostratified resulting in thickening into the early liver bud. Their expansion forms a population of the bipotential hepatoblasts. Hepatic stellate cells are derived from mesenchyme. After migration of hepatoblasts into the septum transversum mesenchyme, the hepatic architecture begins to be established, with liver sinusoids and bile canaliculi appearing. The liver bud separates into the lobes. The left umbilical vein becomes the ductus venosus and the right vitelline vein becomes the portal vein. The expanding liver bud is colonized by hematopoietic cells. The bipotential hepatoblasts begin differentiating into biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes. The biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins, first producing a monolayer, and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells. In ductal plate, focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer, become surrounded by portal mesenchyme, and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatoblasts not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange into cords lined by sinudoidal epithelial cells and bile canaliculi. Once hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion, they begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte, and eventually mature hepatocytes appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant glycogen accumulation. In the adult liver, hepatocytes are not equivalent, with position along the portocentrovenular axis within a liver lobule dictating expression of metabolic genes involved in drug metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, ammonia detoxification, and bile production and secretion. WNT/Œ≤-catenin has now been identified to be playing a key role in this phenomenon. At birth, the liver comprises roughly 4% of body weight and weighs on average about . Over the course of further development, it will increase to but will only take up 2.5‚Äì3.5% of body weight. =Fetal blood supply= In the growing fetus, a major source of blood to the liver is the umbilical vein, which supplies nutrients to the growing fetus. The umbilical vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus and passes upward along the free margin of the falciform ligament of the liver to the inferior surface of the liver. There, it joins with the left branch of the portal vein. The ductus venosus carries blood from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein and then to the inferior vena cava, allowing placental blood to bypass the liver. In the fetus, the liver does not perform the normal digestive processes and filtration of the infant liver because nutrients are received directly from the mother via the placenta. The fetal liver releases some blood stem cells that migrate to the fetal thymus, creating the T-cells or T-lymphocytes. After birth, the formation of blood stem cells shifts to the red bone marrow. After 2‚Äì5 days, the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are completely obliterated; the former becomes the round ligament of liver and the latter becomes the ligamentum venosum. In the disorders of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the umbilical vein can open up again. Functions The various functions of the liver are carried out by the liver cells or hepatocytes. The liver is thought to be responsible for up to 500 separate functions, usually in combination with other systems and organs. Currently, no artificial organ or device is capable of reproducing all the functions of the liver. Some functions can be carried out by liver dialysis, an experimental treatment for liver failure. The liver also accounts for about 20% of resting total body oxygen consumption. =Blood supply= Liver veins The liver receives a dual blood supply from the hepatic portal vein and hepatic arteries. The hepatic portal vein delivers around 75% of the liver's blood supply and carries venous blood drained from the spleen, gastrointestinal tract, and its associated organs. The hepatic arteries supply arterial blood to the liver, accounting for the remaining quarter of its blood flow. Oxygen is provided from both sources; about half of the liver's oxygen demand is met by the hepatic portal vein, and half is met by the hepatic arteries. The hepatic artery also has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors; therefore, flow through the artery is controlled, in part, by the splanchnic nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Blood flows through the liver sinusoids and empties into the central vein of each lobule. The central veins coalesce into hepatic veins, which leave the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava. =Biliary flow= Biliary tract The biliary tract is derived from the branches of the bile ducts. The biliary tract, also known as the biliary tree, is the path by which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. The bile produced in the liver is collected in bile canaliculi, small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes. The canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule, where they merge to form bile ducts. Within the liver, these ducts are termed intrahepatic bile ducts, and once they exit the liver, they are considered extrahepatic. The intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left hepatic ducts, which exit the liver at the transverse fissure, and merge to form the common hepatic duct. The cystic duct from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. The biliary system and connective tissue is supplied by the hepatic artery alone Bile either drains directly into the duodenum via the common bile duct, or is temporarily stored in the gallbladder via the cystic duct. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct enter the second part of the duodenum together at the hepatopancreatic ampulla, also known as the ampulla of Vater. =Synthesis= The liver plays a major role in carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. The liver performs several roles in carbohydrate metabolism: The liver synthesizes and stores around 100 g of glycogen via glycogenesis, the formation of glycogen from glucose. When needed, the liver releases glucose into the blood by performing glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen into glucose. The liver is also responsible for gluconeogenesis, which is the synthesis of glucose from certain amino acids, lactate, or glycerol. Adipose and liver cells produce glycerol by breakdown of fat, which the liver uses for gluconeogenesis. The liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein metabolism, synthesis as well as degradation. It is also responsible for a large part of amino acid synthesis. The liver plays a role in the production of clotting factors, as well as red blood cell production. Some of the proteins synthesized by the liver include coagulation factors I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, as well as protein C, protein S and antithrombin. In the first trimester fetus, the liver is the main site of red blood cell production. By the 32nd week of gestation, the bone marrow has almost completely taken over that task. The liver is a major site of production for thrombopoietin, a glycoprotein hormone that regulates the production of platelets by the bone marrow. The liver plays several roles in lipid metabolism: it performs cholesterol synthesis, lipogenesis, and the production of triglycerides, and a bulk of the body's lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver. The liver plays a key role in digestion, as it produces and excretes bile (a yellowish liquid) required for emulsifying fats and help the absorption of vitamin K from the diet. Some of the bile drains directly into the duodenum, and some is stored in the gallbladder. The liver produces insulin-like growth factor 1, a polypeptide protein hormone that plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adults. =Breakdown= The liver is responsible for the breakdown of insulin and other hormones. The liver breaks down bilirubin via glucuronidation, facilitating its excretion into bile. The liver is responsible for the breakdown and excretion of many waste products. It plays a key role in breaking down or modifying toxic substances (e.g., methylation) and most medicinal products in a process called drug metabolism. This sometimes results in toxication, when the metabolite is more toxic than its precursor. Preferably, the toxins are conjugated to avail excretion in bile or urine. The liver converts ammonia into urea as part of the urea cycle, and the urea is excreted in the urine. = Blood reservoir= Because the liver is an expandable organ, large quantities of blood can be stored in its blood vessels. Its normal blood volume, including both that in the hepatic veins and that in the hepatic sinuses, is about 450 milliliters, or almost 10 percent of the body's total blood volume. When high pressure in the right atrium causes backpressure in the liver, the liver expands, and 0.5 to 1 liter of extra blood is occasionally stored in the hepatic veins and sinuses. This occurs especially in cardiac failure with peripheral congestion. Thus, in effect, the liver is a large, expandable, venous organ capable of acting as a valuable blood reservoir in times of excess blood volume and capable of supplying extra blood in times of diminished blood volume. = Lymph production= Because the pores in the hepatic sinusoids are very permeable and allow ready passage of both fluid and proteins into the spaces of disse, the lymph draining from the liver usually has a protein concentration of about 6 g/dl, which is only slightly less than the protein concentration of plasma. Also, the high permeability of the liver sinusoid epithelium allows large quantities of lymph to form. Therefore, about half of all the lymph formed in the body under resting conditions arises in the liver. =Other= * The liver stores a multitude of substances, including vitamin A (1‚Äì2 years' supply), vitamin D (1‚Äì4 months' supply), vitamin B12 (3‚Äì5 years' supply), vitamin K, iron, and copper. * The liver is responsible for immunological effects ‚Äì the mononuclear phagocyte system of the liver contains many immunologically active cells, acting as a 'sieve' for antigens carried to it via the portal system. * The liver produces albumin, the most abundant protein in blood serum. It is essential in the maintenance of oncotic pressure, and acts as a transport for fatty acids and steroid hormones. * The liver synthesizes angiotensinogen, a hormone that is responsible for raising the blood pressure when activated by renin, an enzyme that is released when the kidney senses low blood pressure. * The liver produces the enzyme catalase in order to break down hydrogen peroxide, a toxic oxidising agent, into water and oxygen. =With aging= The oxidative capacity of the liver decreases with aging, and therefore any medications that require oxidation (for instance, benzodiazepines) are more likely to accumulate to toxic levels. However, medications with shorter half- lives, such as lorazepam and oxazepam, are preferred in most cases when benzodiazepines are required in regard to geriatric medicine. Clinical significance =Disease= Left lobe liver tumor The liver is a vital organ and supports almost every other organ in the body. Because of its strategic location and multidimensional functions, the liver is also prone to many diseases. Cirrhosis Overview National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse. Retrieved 2010-01-22 The bare area of the liver is a site that is vulnerable to the passing of infection from the abdominal cavity to the thoracic cavity. Liver diseases may be diagnosed by liver function tests‚Äìblood tests that can identify various markers. For example, acute-phase reactants are produced by the liver in response to injury or inflammation. Hepatitis is a common condition of inflammation of the liver. The most usual cause of this is viral, and the most common of these infections are hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. Some of these infections are sexually transmitted. Inflammation can also be caused by other viruses in the family Herpesviridae such as the herpes simplex virus. Chronic (rather than acute) infection with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus is the main cause of liver cancer.Hepatitis A, B, and C Center: Symptoms, Causes, Tests, Transmission, and Treatments . Webmd.com (2005-08-19). Retrieved on 2016-05-10. Globally, about 248 million individuals are chronically infected with hepatitis B (with 843,724 in the U.S.), and 142 million are chronically infected with hepatitis C (with 2.7 million in the U.S.). Globally there are about 114 million and 20 million cases of hepatitis A and hepatitis E respectively, but these generally resolve and do not become chronic. Hepatitis D virus is a \\"satellite\\" of hepatitis B virus (can only infect in the presence of hepatitis B), and co-infects nearly 20 million people with hepatitis B, globally. Hepatic encephalopathy is caused by an accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream that are normally removed by the liver. This condition can result in coma and can prove fatal. Budd‚ÄìChiari syndrome is a condition caused by blockage of the hepatic veins (including thrombosis) that drain the liver. It presents with the classical triad of abdominal pain, ascites and liver enlargement. Many diseases of the liver are accompanied by jaundice caused by increased levels of bilirubin in the system. The bilirubin results from the breakup of the hemoglobin of dead red blood cells; normally, the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and excretes it through bile. Other disorders caused by excessive alcohol consumption are grouped under alcoholic liver diseases and these include alcoholic hepatitis, fatty liver, and cirrhosis. Factors contributing to the development of alcoholic liver diseases are not only the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, but can also include gender, genetics, and liver insult. Liver damage can also be caused by drugs, particularly paracetamol and drugs used to treat cancer. A rupture of the liver can be caused by a liver shot used in combat sports. Primary biliary cholangitis is an autoimmune disease of the liver. It is marked by slow progressive destruction of the small bile ducts of the liver, with the intralobular ducts (Canals of Hering) affected early in the disease. When these ducts are damaged, bile and other toxins build up in the liver (cholestasis) and over time damages the liver tissue in combination with ongoing immune related damage. This can lead to scarring (fibrosis) and cirrhosis. Cirrhosis increases the resistance to blood flow in the liver, and can result in portal hypertension. Congested anastomoses between the portal venous system and the systemic circulation, can be a subsequent condition. There are also many pediatric liver diseases, including biliary atresia, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, alagille syndrome, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis and hepatic hemangioma a benign tumour the most common type of liver tumour, thought to be congenital. A genetic disorder causing multiple cysts to form in the liver tissue, usually in later life, and usually asymptomatic, is polycystic liver disease. Diseases that interfere with liver function will lead to derangement of these processes. However, the liver has a great capacity to regenerate and has a large reserve capacity. In most cases, the liver only produces symptoms after extensive damage. Hepatomegaly refers to an enlarged liver and can be due to many causes. It can be palpated in a liver span measurement. =Symptoms= The classic symptoms of liver damage include the following: * Pale stools occur when stercobilin, a brown pigment, is absent from the stool. Stercobilin is derived from bilirubin metabolites produced in the liver. * Dark urine occurs when bilirubin mixes with urine * Jaundice (yellow skin and/or whites of the eyes) This is where bilirubin deposits in skin, causing an intense itch. Itching is the most common complaint by people who have liver failure. Often this itch cannot be relieved by drugs. * Swelling of the abdomen, and swelling of the ankles and feet occurs because the liver fails to make albumin. * Excessive fatigue occurs from a generalized loss of nutrients, minerals and vitamins. * Bruising and easy bleeding are other features of liver disease. The liver makes clotting factors, substances which help prevent bleeding. When liver damage occurs, these factors are no longer present and severe bleeding can occur.Extraintestinal Complications: Liver Disease Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. Retrieved 2010-01-22 * Pain in the upper right quadrant can result from the stretching of Glisson's capsule in conditions of hepatitis and pre-eclampsia. =Diagnosis= The diagnosis of liver disease is made by liver function tests, groups of blood tests, that can readily show the extent of liver damage. If infection is suspected, then other serological tests will be carried out. A physical examination of the liver can only reveal its size and any tenderness, and some form of imaging such as an ultrasound or CT scan may also be needed.Liver Information HealthLine.

This is, however, not true regeneration but rather compensatory growth in mammals. The lobes that are removed do not regrow and the growth of the liver is a restoration of function, not original form. This contrasts with true regeneration where both original function and form are restored. In some other species, such as zebrafish, the liver undergoes true regeneration by restoring both shape and size of the organ. In the liver, large areas of the tissues are formed but for the formation of new cells there must be sufficient amount of material so the circulation of the blood becomes more active. This is predominantly due to the hepatocytes re-entering the cell cycle. That is, the hepatocytes go from the quiescent G0 phase to the G1 phase and undergo mitosis. This process is activated by the p75 receptors. There is also some evidence of bipotential stem cells, called hepatic oval cells or ovalocytes (not to be confused with oval red blood cells of ovalocytosis), which are thought to reside in the canals of Hering. These cells can differentiate into either hepatocytes or cholangiocytes. Cholangiocytes are the epithelial lining cells of the bile ducts. They are cuboidal epithelium in the small interlobular bile ducts, but become columnar and mucus secreting in larger bile ducts approaching the porta hepatis and the extrahepatic ducts. Research is being carried out on the use of stem cells for the generation of an artificial liver. Scientific and medical works about liver regeneration often refer to the Greek Titan Prometheus who was chained to a rock in the Caucasus where, each day, his liver was devoured by an eagle, only to grow back each night. The myth suggests the ancient Greeks may have known about the liver's remarkable capacity for self-repair.An argument for the ancient Greek‚Äôs knowing about liver regeneration is provided by Counterarguments are provided by and by =Liver transplantation= Human liver transplants were first performed by Thomas Starzl in the United States and Roy Calne in Cambridge, England in 1963 and 1967, respectively. After resection of left lobe liver tumor Liver transplantation is the only option for those with irreversible liver failure. Most transplants are done for chronic liver diseases leading to cirrhosis, such as chronic hepatitis C, alcoholism, and autoimmune hepatitis. Less commonly, liver transplantation is done for fulminant hepatic failure, in which liver failure occurs over days to weeks. Liver allografts for transplant usually come from donors who have died from fatal brain injury. Living donor liver transplantation is a technique in which a portion of a living person's liver is removed (hepatectomy) and used to replace the entire liver of the recipient. This was first performed in 1989 for pediatric liver transplantation. Only 20 percent of an adult's liver (Couinaud segments 2 and 3) is needed to serve as a liver allograft for an infant or small child. More recently, adult-to-adult liver transplantation has been done using the donor's right hepatic lobe, which amounts to 60 percent of the liver. Due to the ability of the liver to regenerate, both the donor and recipient end up with normal liver function if all goes well. This procedure is more controversial, as it entails performing a much larger operation on the donor, and indeed there were at least two donor deaths out of the first several hundred cases. A 2006 publication addressed the problem of donor mortality and found at least fourteen cases. The risk of postoperative complications (and death) is far greater in right-sided operations than that in left-sided operations. With the recent advances of noninvasive imaging, living liver donors usually have to undergo imaging examinations for liver anatomy to decide if the anatomy is feasible for donation. The evaluation is usually performed by multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MDCT is good in vascular anatomy and volumetry. MRI is used for biliary tree anatomy. Donors with very unusual vascular anatomy, which makes them unsuitable for donation, could be screened out to avoid unnecessary operations.

Society and culture Some cultures regard the liver as the seat of the soul. In Greek mythology, the gods punished Prometheus for revealing fire to humans by chaining him to a rock where a vulture (or an eagle) would peck out his liver, which would regenerate overnight. (The liver is the only human internal organ that actually can regenerate itself to a significant extent.) Many ancient peoples of the Near East and Mediterranean areas practiced a type of divination called haruspicy or hepatomancy, where they tried to obtain information by examining the livers of sheep and other animals. In Plato, and in later physiology, the liver was thought to be the seat of the darkest emotions (specifically wrath, jealousy and greed) which drive men to action. The Talmud (tractate Berakhot 61b) refers to the liver as the seat of anger, with the gallbladder counteracting this. The Persian, Urdu, and Hindi languages (ÿ¨⁄Øÿ± or ‡§ú‡§ø‡§ó‡§∞ or jigar) refer to the liver figurative speech to indicate courage and strong feelings, or \\"their best\\"; e.g., \\"This Mecca has thrown to you the pieces of its liver!\\".The Great Battle Of Badar (Yaum-E-Furqan) . Shawuniversitymosque.org (2006-07-08). Retrieved 2013-03-19. The term jan e jigar, literally \\"the strength (power) of my liver\\", is a term of endearment in Urdu. In Persian slang, jigar is used as an adjective for any object which is desirable, especially women. In the Zulu language, the word for liver (isibindi) is the same as the word for courage. =Food= Maksalaatikko, a Finnish liver casserole Humans commonly eat the livers of mammals, fowl, and fish as food. Domestic pig, ox, lamb, calf, chicken, and goose livers are widely available from butchers and supermarkets. In the Romance languages, the anatomical word for \\"liver\\" (French foie, Spanish h√≠gado, etc.) derives not from the Latin anatomical term, jecur, but from the culinary term ficatum, literally \\"stuffed with figs,\\" referring to the livers of geese that had been fattened on figs. Animal livers are rich in iron, vitamin A and vitamin B12; and cod liver oil is commonly used as a dietary supplement. Liver can be baked, boiled, broiled, fried, stir-fried, or eaten raw (asbeh nayeh or sawda naye in Lebanese cuisine, or liver sashimi in Japanese cuisine). In many preparations, pieces of liver are combined with pieces of meat or kidneys, as in the various forms of Middle Eastern mixed grill (e.g. meurav Yerushalmi). Well-known examples include liver p√¢t√©, foie gras, chopped liver, and leverpastej. Liver sausages, such as Braunschweiger and liverwurst, are also a valued meal. Liver sausages may also be used as spreads. A traditional South African delicacy, skilpadjies, is made of minced lamb's liver wrapped in netvet (caul fat), and grilled over an open fire. Traditionally, some fish livers were valued as food, especially the stingray liver. It was used to prepare delicacies, such as poached skate liver on toast in England, as well as the beignets de foie de raie and foie de raie en croute in French cuisine. =Giraffe liver= 19th century drinking scene in Kordofan, home to the Humr tribe, imbibers of a drink prepared from giraffe liver. Plate from Le D√©sert et le Soudan by Stanislas d'Escayrac de Lauture The Humr, one of the tribes in the Baggara ethnic grouping, native to southwestern Kordofan in Sudan and speakers of Shuwa or Chadian Arabic, prepare a non-alcoholic drink from the liver and bone marrow of the giraffe which they call umm nyolokh, and which they claim is intoxicating ( Arabic ÿ≥ŸÉÿ±ÿßŸÜ sakran ), causing dreams and even waking hallucinations.Rudgley, Richard The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances, pub. Abacus 1998 pps. 20-21. Anthropologist Ian Cunnison, who accompanied the Humr on one of their giraffe-hunting expeditions in the late 1950s, notes that: > It is said that a person, once he has drunk umm nyolokh, will return to > giraffe again and again. Humr, being Mahdists, are strict abstainers [ from > alcohol ] and a Humrawi is never drunk ( sakran ) on liquor or beer. But he > uses this word to describe the effects which umm nyolokh has upon > him.Cunnison, Ian 1958 Giraffe Hunting among the Humr Tribe, SNR 39, pps. > 49-60. Cunnison's remarkable account of an apparently psychoactive mammal found its way from a somewhat obscure scientific paper into more mainstream literature through a conversation between Dr. Wendy James of the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology at the University of Oxford and specialist on the use of hallucinogens and intoxicants in society Richard Rudgley, who considered its implications in his popular work The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances. Rudgley hypothesises that the presence of the hallucinogenic compound DMT might account for the putative intoxicating properties of umm nyolokh. Cunnison himself, on the other hand, had found it hard fully to believe in the literal truth of the Humr's assertion that their drink was intoxicating: > I can only assume that there is no intoxicating substance in the drink and > that the effect it produces is simply a matter of convention, although it > may be brought about subconsciously. The study of entheogens in general - including entheogens of animal origin ( e.g. hallucinogenic fish and toad venom ) - has, however, made considerable progress in the sixty-odd years since Cunnison's report and the idea that some intoxicating principle might reside in giraffe liver no longer seems as far- fetched as it was in Cunnison's day, although conclusive proof ( or disproof ) will have to await detailed analyses of the animal organ in question and the drink prepared therefrom. =Arrow/bullet poison= Certain Tungusic peoples formerly prepared a type of arrow poison from rotting animal livers, which was, in later times, also applied to bullets. Russian anthropologist Sergei Mikhailovich Shirokogorov notes that: > Formerly the using of poisoned arrows was common. For instance, among the > Kumarƒçen, [ a subgroup of the Oroqen ] even in recent times a poison was > used which was prepared from decaying liver. * ( Note ) This has been > confirmed by the Kumarƒçen. I am not competent to judge as to the chemical > conditions of production of poison which is not destroyed by the heat of > explosion. However, the Tungus themselves compare this method [ of poisoning > ammunition ] with the poisoning of arrows.Shirokogoroff S.M., Psychomental > Complex of the Tungus, pub. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., Ltd. 1935 p. > 89. Other animals Sheep's liver The liver is found in all vertebrates and is typically the largest visceral (internal) organ. Its form varies considerably in different species, and is largely determined by the shape and arrangement of the surrounding organs. Nonetheless, in most species it is divided into right and left lobes; exceptions to this general rule include snakes, where the shape of the body necessitates a simple cigar-like form. The internal structure of the liver is broadly similar in all vertebrates. An organ sometimes referred to as a liver is found associated with the digestive tract of the primitive chordate Amphioxus. Although it performs many functions of a liver, it is not considered a true liver but a homolog of the vertebrate liver. The amphioxus hepatic caecum produces the liver-specific proteins vitellogenin, antithrombin, plasminogen, alanine aminotransferase, and insulin/Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) References =Works cited= External links * Liver at the Human Protein Atlas * VIRTUAL Liver ‚Äì online learning resource * Liver enzymes Category:Organs (anatomy) ","title":"Liver"},{"id":"17384316","text":"Stavroula Kozompoli (born January 14, 1974) is a female Greek water polo player and Olympic silver medalist with the Greek national team.

It was divided into two distinct kingdoms, north Tethba, ruled by the Cen√©l Coirpri, and south Tethba, ruled by the Cen√©l Maini. It covered parts of County Westmeath and much of County Longford, counties which today are the far north-west part of the province of Leinster. In some cases Tethbae may refer to south Tethbae only. Two Tethbae In Early Christian times, Tethba lay within the lands of the southern U√≠ N√©ill and the ruling dynasties of both kingdoms were reckoned members of the U√≠ N√©ill kindred in medieval genealogies. North Tethba‚ÄîTethbae Th√∫aiscirt‚Äîwas centred on Granard, while south Tethba‚ÄîTethbae Deiscirt‚Äîlay around Ardagh.Byrne, Irish Kings, p. 89; Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 16 & 33; McKillop, \\"Tethbae\\". The division of Tethbae into northern and southern regions was attested in the 7th century. It was not only a political and dynastic division. The chief churches of the two-halves belonged to different church confederations. North Tethbae's principal church at Granard was associated with Saint Patrick from the earliest written records. Bishop Tirech√°n's hagiography refers to \\"the two Tethbae\\" and claims that Patrick established bishops at both Granard and Ardagh. But although Granard is included among the network of Patrician churches, Ardagh is not.Charles- Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, p. 36; De Paor, Saint Patrick's World, pp. 159 & 198. The key figure in Ardagh tradition was its founder, Bishop M√©l, according to Patrician accounts a nephew of Patrick. Ardagh, by the time of Tirech√°n and the earliest records, was a part of the confederation of churches which took Brigit of Kildare as chief patron and looked mainly to the church at Kildare for leadership.Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 33 & 260. Cen√©l Coirpri Medieval Irish traditions presented the lands of the U√≠ N√©ill as conquests by Niall of the Nine Hostages and his sons. Niall's son Coirpre was the eponymous ancestor of Cen√©l Coirpri. Along with Fiachu, he may have led the earliest U√≠ N√©ill conquests in the midlands.Byrne, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 84 & 90-91; Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 447-451. North Tethbae, Cen√©l Coirpri M√≥r, was one of three kingdoms named for Coirpre mac N√©ill. To the north-west of Tethbae, on the shore of Donegal Bay, was the kingdom of Cen√©l Coirpi Dromma Cl√≠ab. To the south-east, in County Kildare, around Carbury, itself named for Coirpre, was a third branch of Cen√©l Coirpi but this was not established until much later. This alignment of territories, together with the evidence of the Irish annals, which include a series of entries crediting Coirpre with the conquest of the midlands, suggests that the kingdom of Coirpre once extended over 100 miles across Ireland.Byrne, Irish Kings, pp. 84-91 & additional notes at p. xvi; Charles- Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, p. 469. Apart from Coirpre himself and his grandson T√∫athal M√°elgarb, no king of Cen√©l Coirpri is included in later lists of High Kings of Ireland. Later kings of Cen√©l Coirpri are mentioned in the Annals of Ulster and other Irish annals with some frequency, although usually only to report their deaths. Most kings are simply called \\"king of Cen√©l Coirpri\\", although Conaing (died 752) is specifically called \\"king of Coirpri of Tethbae\\". An entry in 799 reporting the deaths of two kings of Coirpri, Murchad ua Cathail and Dub Innrecht mac Artgaile, shows that the kingship could be shared. In addition to the usual annalistic reports, √ìengus Bronbachall, grandson of T√∫athal, is mentioned in Adomn√°n's Life of Saint Columba.Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 607-68, genealogical table VI (Cen√©l Coirpri) & notes; for √ìengus Bronbachall, see the Life of Saint Columba, book I, chapter 13. At least in earlier historical times, Cen√©l Coirpri may have been of sufficient importance to attract the attention of largely hostile writers. Tirech√°n's life of Patrick states that Coirpre was cursed by the saint, at the hill of Tara, that none of his descendants would be High King.De Paor, Saint Patrick's World, p. 156. The obvious omission, an explanation for the rule of T√∫athal M√°elgarb, was corrected by later hagiographers; Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 33-34\\\\. In the earliest surviving list, that in the Baile Chuind, T√∫athal appears not under his own name but as √ìengarb; Byrne, Irish Kings, pp. 90-92. T√∫athal M√°elgarb is portrayed in a poor light by later writers dealing with the life of Diarmait mac Cerbaill, his perhaps-kinsman whose descendants, Clann Cholm√°in and the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine, replaced the kindreds of Coirpre and Fiachu as rulers of the midlands.Byrne, Irish Kings, pp. 90-92; Charles-Edwards, p. 468. In the 11th century, north Tethbae was largely absorbed by the expanding kingdom of Br√©ifne, ruled by the Ua Ruairc branch of the Connachta kindred of U√≠ Bri√∫in, and its clients the Conmaicne R√©in.Byrne, Irish Kings, p. 92 & 233-237; MacKillop, \\"Conmaicne\\". It may be that the Conmaicne R√©in were simply retaking lands which had once been theirs. Cen√©l Maini While Coirpe mac N√©ill is a major figure in the annals and appears in Tirech√°n's hagiography, Maine son of Niall is not mentioned by Tirech√°n, nor is their any record of his conquests. It may be possible, and is perhaps even probable, that descent from Niall of the Nine Hostages through an otherwise poorly attested line of descent is a genealogical fiction designed to strengthen U√≠ N√©ill control of the midlands. The Cen√©l Maini probably originated as part of a much larger U√≠ Maine kingdom extending from the eastern part of modern County Galway through County Roscommon, across the River Shannon, and into County Longford.Byrne, Irish Kings, pp. 85 & 92-93; Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 96 & 548; √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, Early Medieval Ireland, p. 61. Although officially incorporated into the U√≠ N√©ill, no king of Cen√©l Maini was ever reckoned a High King of Ireland. The Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii does, however, say that the kings of Cen√©l Maini had a privileged place in choosing and inaugurating High Kings, much like the Airg√≠alla, another group believed to have been associated with the Connachta, of which the U√≠ N√©ill were only the leading group, by genealogical fictions.Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 34-35, 96 & 548-549. The Cen√©l Maini are still represented today among the Irish nobility and Chiefs of the Name by the O'Kearney or √ì Catharnaigh family, the head of whom is traditionally styled The Fox.

Built between 1915 and 1917, it serves both as a memorial to women who served in the American Civil War and as the headquarters building for the American Red Cross. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. and Description The national headquarters of the American Red Cross is located in central Washington, on the east side of a city block bounded by 17th, D, and E Streets NW. This block, on the west side of The Ellipse south of the White House, is entirely devoted to Red Cross facilities. The main headquarters building is a large stone structure, faced in white Vermont marble. It is three stories in height, its third floor recessed behind a balustrade. Its east-facing main facade has a central classical temple portico, with six Corinthian columns supporting a gabled pediment with a red cross at the center. The flanking building bays are articulated by attached Corinthian columns. The main bronze doorways lead into a large central marble entrance hall, with a broad stairway to the second floor. Niches in the hall are filled with sculptural depictions of \\"Faith\\", \\"Hope\\", and \\"Charity\\", executed by Hiram Powers. =Tiffany windows= The Board of Governors room contains three Favrile windows by designer Louis Comfort Tiffany. The windows are notable for being the largest suite of Tiffany windows outside a religious building. Unlike many other Tiffany windows, these windows have remained in their original setting. The costs of these windows were donated by two organizations of Civil War women: the Woman's Relief Corps of the North and the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The left panel was based on Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem, Santa Filomena, that honored the work of Florence Nightingale. The center panel depicts the conception of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement at the Battle of Solferino near Solferino, Italy. The right panel depicts a scene from Edmund Spenser's epic poem The Faerie Queene. History The American Red Cross was founded in 1881 in the aftermath of the American Civil War as a unique public-private partnership for providing disaster relief and medical support for military forces. This headquarters building was built between 1915 and 1917 to a design by Trowbridge and Livingston. It cost approximately $800,000 and was dedicated on May 12, 1917.

It was felt that a number of the tasks carried out by the previous Australian Wheat Board would not be appropriate for a privately owned body; thus, the WEA was established. The WEA's role was determined by the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 and its operations were funded by a charge on Australian wheat exports. The WEA was controlled by a five-member board of directors, appointed for a period of up to three years by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. They were supported by a 16-person Canberra-based Secretariat, headed by a Chief Executive Officer. The WEA was an agency under the Commonwealth Authorities and Corporations Act 1997. The WEA had two major functions, including monitoring and reporting to the government and growers on AWB(I)'s performance in managing the National [wheat] Pool. This was done through a commercial-in- confidence report to the Minister and a public report, known as the Growers Report. Through its second function, the WEA also considered export applications from parties other than AWB(I) [known as non-AWB(I) exporters] to export wheat from Australia, usually in bags and containers. Since 17 August 2007, the export of wheat in bags and containers has been deregulated. Non- AWB(I) exports, are permitted in limited volumes to protect the integrity of the National Pool and make up about 4% of total exports. In December 2006 the Government amended the Act transferring the power of veto over bulk exports from AWB(I) to the Minister, on a temporary basis until 30 June 2007. This has since been extended to the end of June 2008. The Government then established a Wheat Export Marketing Consultation Committee which consulted with wheat growers across Australia and presented its finding to the government on 29 March 2007. The government is using this report as the basis for its consideration of new wheat export marketing arrangements. The WEA was succeeded by the Export Wheat Commission in 2007. AWB Iraqi kickbacks scandal In the course of the Cole inquiry into allegations that AWB paid kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq for wheat shipments under the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program, it was revealed that the WEA board, upon hearing of the allegations through media sources, asked AWB(I) to show them Iraq wheat sales contracts. The WEA had limited powers and resources, far below those of the Cole Inquiry, and its examination of material provided to it by AWB at that time failed to reveal information of concern. During the Inquiry the Grain Board of Iraq ceased to deal with AWB. This resulted in the establishment of the Wheat Australia consortium to export wheat to Iraq in 2006, with special approval from the WEA and Australian Government. The temporary wheat export arrangements allow other exporters to apply for consents to export in bulk. However, of 77 applications received by the WEA since December 2006, just two had been approved by the end of March 2007.

Travelling from Wicklow, Ireland, to Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, it features him completing the journey using 112 modes of transport and only travelling by plane when absolutely necessary. Background After Long Way Round and Long Way Down, Boorman and producer Russ Malkin conceived By Any Means in late 2007. Travelling across 24 countries, the crew comprised only Boorman, Malkin and a cameraman, Paul \\"Mungo\\" Mungeam. Journey =Episode 1= (4 June 2008) The expedition got under way on 12 April 2008 from Boorman's father John Boorman's house in Wicklow. They rode their motorbikes up to Kilkeel before crossing the Irish Sea by fishing boat to the Isle of Man, and then by ferry to Liverpool. There they took a combination of taxis and a train down to the Coventry Transport Museum to spend the night, where Boorman was reunited with the motorcycle he rode on Long Way Down, before riding again on motorcycle down to The Ace Cafe in London the next day. From there they drove an AEC Routemaster bus down to Dover and boarded a small sailboat across to Calais which they completed in five hours. =Episode 2= Boorman in 2008 (11 June 2008) From Calais the expedition drove down to Paris in a 1969 Citro√´n DS and boarded the Venice-Simplon Orient Express which took them across France, Switzerland and Austria to Venice, Italy. They spent some time in Venice, experiencing the daily lives of people on the Venetian canals before boarding a catamaran to Poreƒç, Croatia. From there they travelled to Zagreb in a Yugo and then to Vukovar where they spoke to locals about the devastating Croatian War of Independence and the city's water tower with over 600 bullet holes in it that still failed to collapse it. They then boarded a train which took them through Serbia and Belgrade and they took a boat down to the Danube. Later they travelled through Bulgaria by train, where they compared the hills and pastures on the landscape to the Lake District in England, through Sofia where they stopped very briefly for refreshments before continuing on to Istanbul. In Istanbul they experienced Turkish cuisine such as Turkish delight and apple tea which is sold in abundance in the country and they boarded a boat across the Bosphorus and drove across the coast of Northern Turkey in a minibus. It was designed as a public service bus with notices of the towns they would pass on their journey on the windows. They encountered some memorable passengers along the way including one passenger named Fatih (the pronunciation of which is \\"Farty\\" ‚Äì a euphemism for flatulence common in England), this unfortunate conflict of dialect/pronunciation caused some amusement to the team and consequently some upheaval to the point the passenger felt offended and had to depart the bus. They crossed into Georgia to Batumi, where they resumed their journey in an old Russian UAZ and across to the Caspian Sea in Baku, Azerbaijan. They noted how polluted the city was, and the difficulties of the everyday lives of the workers who worked in the multibillion-dollar oil industry despite earning very little. They then travelled down the coast of the Caspian Sea to Astara, Iran but on the way they had to switch transport to an old Russian car (GAZ Volga) which was regarded as a Rolls-Royce of Russian automobiles and quite a privilege. They reached Iran, where they joined a truck cargo with over one million kilometres to its name and its drivers who took them through to Tehran, on the way noting how the journey seemed split by lush green countryside in which tea was grown, and suddenly juxtaposed against the desert landscape by only a tunnel which they encountered on the second half of the leg. In Tehran they took a taxi through the city, driven by a tough Iranian female driver and boarded the Iranian Express which took them down to Esfahan, Qom and down to Bandar Abbas on the southern coast, travelling with the Bakhtiari along the way. =Episode 3= (18 June 2008) From Iran the team took a catamaran across to Dubai which Boorman described as \\"paradise\\" before boarding a 270 metre long cargo ship across the pirate waters of the Gulf and the Arabian Sea to Mumbai, India. Boorman found Mumbai extremely crowded and hot, but took the time to visit some pottery makers in the city. He then took a cab to the train station where he boarded a train for the 852 miles journey to Delhi that took 19 hours. In Delhi they took a tuk tuk across the city, where they picked up Royal Enfield Bullet 500cc motorcycles to take them to Agra. During this time the cameraman, Mungo, learned of his grandfather's death and seriously injured his leg meaning he had to return to London to receive treatment whilst the others continued. They took a taxi to Kanpur and then boarded a Tata Truck which Boorman was emphatic about through Allahabad to Mirzapur. There they switched transport to Mahindra Jeeps for some 42 miles to Ramnagar Fort. There they boarded a rowing boat on the Ganges for the five miles journey to Varanasi, one of India's holiest cities for both Hindus and Buddhists. Boorman found the city extremely spiritual and a moving experience, witnessing the Sandhya Aarti and cremations at the river side at night and the cleansing. =Episode 4= (31 January 2009) After some time driving a tuk tuk themselves, the team caught the Gorakhpur Express train to Gorakhpur and then an Ambassador 1800 to Sunauli across into Nepal. Due to heavy rainfall the 68 mile trip to Tharu lodge in the Royal Chitwan National Park was a difficult one and they were forced to use 6 different modes of transport in 24 hours including a minibus, Mahindra 275 jeep, a tractor, a Chitwan dugout canoe and even elephants towards Kathmandu in which they eventually caught a taxi. On 28 May it was announced that the old monarchy was coming to an end and a new Republic with a president would be replacing it and they experienced massive crowds in the streets proclaiming the end of the monarchy. After visiting a UNICEF site in the city they took one of the UNICEF minibuses to Kodahi. Later they took a helicopter trip to Tengboche in the Himalayas which Boorman described as \\"the most awesome flight he had ever taken in his life\\" due to the scenery of the green valleys, the looming mountains and Mount Everest. During their time there it coincided with the 55th anniversary of Sir Edmund Hillary's ascent of Everest, and they met his son, Peter Hillary who was visiting with family. They witnessed a marathon being held there, always won by the Sherpas due to them being accustomed to the thin air at that altitude. They were also under scrutiny on the Tibetan border by the Chinese army as their helicopter teetered marginally into Chinese airspace. Lijiang River Back in Kathmandu, due to the natural disasters that has devastated Burma and Sichuan, they caught a plane to Guangzhou in south-east China, where Boorman received treatment for his painful wisdom tooth. They then caught a cement barge along the Lijiang River in a westerly direction through Xijiang to Wuzhou in Guilin province, spending time with a family who live the entirety of their lives going back and forth along the polluted river. In Wuzhou they caught a bus to Yangshuo where they experienced village life in the area and the rice fields, exploring the deep pot hole mud caves, and enjoying a balloon ride. They then took a minibus through Nanning and Guangxi province to Pingxiang on the border with Vietnam. =Episode 5= (31 March 2010) From the Chinese border they rode Minsk motorbikes down to Hanoi, where they spent some time learning about the Vietnam War. They then took the 75 miles to H·∫° Long by bus and went out onto H·∫° Long Bay in a shuttleboat to experience the local pearl trade. The engine of their boat was drenched by a passing wave and they had to be rescued by fishermen, later catching a passenger boat to safety. They then caught a minibus to Nam ƒê·ªãnh and then the Reunification Express train from Haiphong to ƒê√¥ng H√†, a trip of 289 miles. They then rode 19 miles in an open top U.S. jeep to a village named V·ªãnh M·ªëc which had experienced extreme bombing during the Vietnam War as it was a landmark between North Vietnam and South Vietnam. During the war the local villagers built many tunnels to hide, and 17 babies were born beneath the ground between 1966 and 1972. They then visited the Khe Sanh base for further war history. They then reached Dongpanh in Laos and after some part travelled on a Lao Songthaew to Phnom Keng, and they caught a Lod Mei bus through Savannakhet Province. They later travelled down the Mekong past Pakse to Champasak and by minibus to visit the Khon Phapheng Falls in southern Laos near the border with Cambodia, the largest waterfall in southeast Asia. Then via minibus to Veren Kham in Cambodia, they took a rocket boat for two hours which was equipped with a powerful road engine, leaving Boorman confessing it was the greatest mode of transport to date. Past Stung Treng they used dirt bikes to travel across much of Cambodia, including a ferry to transport their bikes across the river, through Kratie and up to Beng Mealea to visit the ruins before continuing on to visit the grand Angkor Wat site, encountering a monsoon along the way. Boorman took the time to ascend the steps of Angkor Wat After some time visiting the ruins of Angkhor and the surrounding temples, they continued on to Phnom Kulen and rode on an elephant truck to Chang Neas, witnessing the primitive rice farming livelihoods of the Cambodians on their way to Sisophon. In Sisophon they rode about on an old bamboo cart train, and remarked that the town was very dirty and undeveloped. They then reached Aranyaprathet on the border with Thailand by minibus, before boarding a Mercedes Bus to take them four hours west to Bangkok. In Bangkok, Boorman was surprised by the level of commercialisation of the city, comparing the difference between the vastly undeveloped parts of Cambodia like \\"chalk and cheese\\" . He caught the Bangkok Skytrain to beat the heavy traffic congestion and took the time to see Thai boxing. They departed Bangkok on the International Express Train in which due to the tight schedule travelled a 24-hour journey down to Butterworth on the border with Malaysia, from which they caught a coach directly down to Kuala Lumpur, leaving Boorman disappointed that they couldn't have experienced that leg further. After seeing the Petronas Towers and a mosque they used a hire car down to Danga Bay, and then Boorman became the first man in history to wakeboard from Malaysia across the bay 12 miles to Singapore. In Singapore he met with old friends and family and their colonial black and white home there, before boarding the Indera Supala ferry to Bintan. They then drove in a 1971 Holden Kingswood, an Australian car across the island, and then caught a water taxi to Nikoi Island before continuing to the mainland on Borneo. =Episode 6= (23 December 2011) Boorman went to Pontianak in West Kalimantan, and visited a UNICEF tetanus vaccination facility in the area before catching a flight on a Boeing 737 to Bali where he caught up with Russ. He rode in an X2K speedboat for the 68 miles to the Gili Islands as night was falling. On the Gili Islands he rode in a horse and cart (known to locals as a Cidomo) before resuming a 218-mile journey in the speedboat the following day, arriving 9 hours later in Bima. From Bima he boarded a 222 ft Phinisi wooden sailing ship, crammed with people across the Flores Sea where he stopped off at Komodo Island before returning to Bima to resume the trip to Kupang, in West Timor, East Nusa Tenggara on the Pelni ferry, equally as populated. There Boorman then boarded a small iron wood ship named the Oelin helmed by an experienced Australian and they crossed the 643 miles to Darwin in six days at an average speed of 7 knots. On the way Boorman witnessed dolphins swimming around the ship, remarking it was the closest he had ever been to them. Uluru/Ayers Rock, where Boorman and crew camped out From Darwin they drove in an old camper van for the 906 miles to Alice Springs, where they took the time for some camel riding and for meeting up with a group of old touring Australian bikers, during which they rode around an old airstrip. They then resumed in a modern pickup can/truck and detoured to visit Uluru/Ayers Rock, camping in the vicinity in the outback, resuming the next day and experiencing some enormous modes of transports such as a road grader and a road train which Boorman compared with his boyhood dream when he would play with Tonka trucks. They resumed in the pickup van to Coober Pedy and William Creek, reportedly the smallest town in Australia located near the world's biggest cattle run, the size of Belgium but only farmed by three people. Boorman then drove in an old 1953 classic Holden which was a popular family car in Australia in the 1950s to Quorn where he tested out a solar car which had been used in the World Solar Car Challenge. Near Woolshed Flat, he and Russ rode in a steam train, and then resumed in the pick-up van. On the way to the Snowy Mountains, they stopped at a garage where one of the owners was a specialist steel carver who had made many 3D-looking figures out of steel. Russ purchased a large steel carving of a biker who was renowned in Australia in the 1950s and put it on the back of the pick-up van and resumed. In the Snowy Mountains, Boorman went horse riding, before driving up into the peaks via a Ski Tube and then a snowmobile at the top. After descending, they resumed the journey to Wollongong, on the coast where they caught up with their families. They then met up with a rally of bikers in a fashion that emulated Long Way Round, and Boorman on a BMW motorcycle with gang rode the 76 miles north along the coast to Sydney. There, the journey finished in Sydney Harbour opposite the Sydney Opera House. In total they used 112 modes of transport that took them through 24 countries in 102 days. Release and tie-ins The show premi√®red on 7 September 2008 on the BBC and will be shown at a later date on the National Geographic Channel. The book By Any Means was published on 23 September and the DVD set has been released on 3 November.Mungothecameraman.com ‚Äì Mungo's Latest Adventure Music The theme music for By Any Means was performed by Jamiroquai.

Like all Plasmodium species P. gabaldoni has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are birds.  Description  The parasite was first described by Garnham in 1977. The trophozoites are round, have a large vacuole and a large nucleus. Up to five pigment granules may be present clumped into a single mass. Multiple trophozoites may be found within the same host cell. Each trophozoite gives rise to 12-36 (average 24) merozoites. The meronts surround the host nucleus and frequently induce rounding of the host cell. Merogony usually takes 24 hours. Gametocytes surround the host nucleus and cause rounding of the host cell.  Geographical occurrence  This parasite is found in Venezuela.  Clinical features and host pathology  P. gabaldoni infects muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) and rock pigeons (Columba livia).

It was built as a joint project of the Government of Kerala, the Greater Cochin Development Authority and Gammon India. Old Bridge Old Harbour bridge also known as Thoppumpady bridge The old Mattancerry Bridge was built in 1940 by Sir Robert Charles Bristo. This bridge connects Willingdon Island with Fort Kochi and crosses Vembanadu Lake. The bridge was built in 16 span with Steel and Wood. The center span of the bridge is designed in such a way that it can be raised using a spring mechanism. As it resembles the British construction of bridge in London, It is also known as London bridge of Kochi. The bridge was commissioned on 13 April 1943 and it was a part of NH-47 later.

The plot concerns a group of terrorists who try to extract a large sum of money from two governments. Plot A small group of terrorists have seized the British ambassador to the fictitious country of \\"Scandinavia\\", and are holding him hostage in his residence. Scandinavia's head of security, Col. Nils Tahlvik (Sean Connery), wants to take an uncompromising position, but he is overruled by the governments of both Scandinavia and Britain, who insist that all of the terrorists' demands be met. Boeing 737-200 of Mey-Air, prominently featured in the film A passenger aeroplane arriving at the airport of Scandinavia's capital city is hijacked by another small group of (purported) terrorists, led by Ray Petrie (Ian McShane). The aeroplane ends up parked on an isolated taxiway, and Petrie demands that he be put in touch with Martin Shepherd (John Quentin), leader of the group holding the British ambassador hostage. Petrie, who is known by Shepherd, convinces Shepherd that his group and his hostages should leave on the hijacked airplane, not on a military plane as originally planned. Tahlvik and his group of military commandos make several attempts to thwart the terrorists' plans, but nothing seems to work out for them. At the last minute, Tahlvik figures out that the \\"terrorists\\" on the airplane are actually British secret operatives intent on capturing Martin Shepherd, and that the British officials have been misleading the Scandinavian authorities and undermining Tahlvik's efforts to capture the two terrorist groups. He boards the aeroplane alone just before it is to take off, precipitating a shootout between the two groups that leaves both Shepherd and Petrie dead. Cast * Sean Connery as Col.

According to Michael Deeley, managing director of British Lion Films, the film was put together by British producer Peter Rawley. He arranged the script and engaged Sean Connery and Ian MacShane, then went to British Lion, who agreed to provide the $1.5 million budget. They sold US and Canadian rights to 20th Century Fox for $800,000, and sold the rights for the rest of the world for $1 million, making a comfortable profit. Filming was carried out in Norway, with a large part of the filming taking place at Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Technical services were contracted to Norsk Film. The aircraft displayed in the hijacking is a Boeing 737-200 in the livery of Mey-Air. Production started in January 1974. During production, Mey-Air defaulted on their payments to Boeing Commercial Aircraft, who sent representatives to Fornebu to repossess the aircraft on 26 February. Filming of the aircraft shots had begun but were not completed.  Media releases  In 2003, the film made its region 1 DVD debut from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in a dual-sided disc with an anamorphic 1.66 widescreen version on side A, and a 1.33:1 full frame version on side B. This release sports the original English mono and is the US version with \\"The Terrorists\\" title and opens with the Fox logo. In Europe, the first region 2 DVD release was by Scanbox Entertainment utilizing a 1.33 transfer, followed by a German DVD release by StudioCanal in 1.66:1 anamorphic widescreen; both carry the UK \\"Ransom\\" title. In Australia, Umbrella Entertainment (under licence from StudioCanal) had put out a DVD release under \\"The Terrorists\\" title using the same transfer as the Fox DVD. In 2012, Anchor Bay (under licence from 20th Century Fox) reissued it on DVD and gave it a Blu-Ray debut in the US. This release is the same transfer of \\"The Terrorists\\" US version as the 2003 Fox DVD, only with a 5.1 upmix in lieu of the original Mono and no other supplements. This release is now Out of Print. In the UK, it received its DVD and Blu-ray debut by independent label Network (under licence from StudioCanal, owners of the British Lion/EMI catalog) in August 2014. Network's release utilizes a new 2k restoration of the UK \\"Ransom\\" version and opens with the British Lion logo. Its supplements are UK Teaser and Theatrical trailers under its \\"Ransom\\" title.

Quasilinear preferences can be represented by the utility function u(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) = x_1 + \\\\theta (x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) where \\\\theta is strictly concave. A useful property of the quasilinear utility function is that the Marshallian/Walrasian demand for x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n does not depend on wealth and is thus not subject to a wealth effect; The absence of a wealth effect simplifies analysis and makes quasilinear utility functions a common choice for modelling. Furthermore, when utility is quasilinear, compensating variation (CV), equivalent variation (EV), and consumer surplus are algebraically equivalent. In mechanism design, quasilinear utility ensures that agents can compensate each other with side payments. Definition in terms of preferences A preference relation \\\\succsim is quasilinear with respect to commodity 1 (called, in this case, the numeraire commodity) if: * All the indifference sets are parallel displacements of each other along the axis of commodity 1. That is, if a bundle \\"x\\" is indifferent to a bundle \\"y\\" (x~y), then \\\\left ( x+ \\\\alpha e_1 \\\\right ) \\\\sim \\\\left ( y+ \\\\alpha e_1 \\\\right ), \\\\forall \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, e_1= \\\\left ( 1,0,...,0 \\\\right ) * Good 1 is desirable; that is, \\\\left ( x+ \\\\alpha e_1 \\\\right ) \\\\succ \\\\left ( x \\\\right ), \\\\forall \\\\alpha>0 In other words: a preference relation is quasilinear if there is one commodity, called the numeraire, which shifts the indifference curves outward as consumption of it increases, without changing their slope. In two dimensional case, the indifference curves are parallel; which is useful because the entire utility function can be determined from a single indifference curve. Definition in terms of utility functions A utility function is quasilinear in commodity 1 if it is in the form : u \\\\left ( x_1, \\\\dots ,x_L\\\\right ) = x_1 + \\\\theta \\\\left (x_2, ..., x_L \\\\right ) where \\\\theta is an arbitrary function. In the case of two goods this function could be, for example, u \\\\left ( x,y \\\\right ) = x + \\\\sqrt{y} . The quasilinear form is special in that the demand functions for all but one of the consumption goods depend only on the prices and not on the income. E.g, with two commodities with prices px = 1 and py , if : u ( x,y ) = x + \\\\theta(y) then, maximizing utility subject to the constraint that the demands for the two goods sum to a given income level, the demand for y is derived from the equation :\\\\theta^\\\\prime (y) = p_y so :y(p,I) = (\\\\theta^\\\\prime)^{-1}(p_y), which is independent of the income I. The indirect utility function in this case is :v(p,I) = v(p) + I, which is a special case of the Gorman polar form.  Equivalence of definitions  The cardinal and ordinal definitions are equivalent in the case of a convex consumption set with continuous preferences that are locally non-satiated in the first argument.

He spent much of his career in Spain and played in M√°laga during three different periods. After his retirement, he managed Almagro and Murcia, and had spells as sporting director at M√°laga. Playing career Husillos started his professional playing career in 1977 with Boca Juniors, where he was part of the squad that won the Copa Libertadores in 1978. The 1977‚Äì78 season also saw the club win the Liberty Cup and the Intercontinental Cup. He played for Real Madrid Castilla during the 1978‚Äì79 season, returning to Boca for 1979‚Äì80. This was followed by a spell at Loma Negra, where his 11 goals in the 1983 Nacional championship earned him top scorer honours. He also played for San Lorenzo, where Rub√©n Cousillas was a goalkeeper and trainer, and later with Real Murcia, Estudiantes de La Plata and New York Cosmos, where he had a brief spell with the exhibition side of 1985. He moved to CD M√°laga and saw the club win promotion to the Spanish First Division in 1987‚Äì88. After three years at Malaga, he moved to CD Tenerife and saw the club also achieve promotion. This was followed by two seasons at C√°diz CF. Husillos then played for Cartagena FC, returning to CD M√°laga during the 1991‚Äì92 season. After a spell at CD Cieza, he ended his career at M√°laga club Atl√©tico Malague√±o in 1993‚Äì94. Managerial career Husillos served as director of youth football at Deportivo Mor√≥n, before moving to Tigre, where he was assistant coach. He returned to Mor√≥n as head coach, and then moved to Almagro, earning his first managerial appointment after a year as a trainer. He guided the club to promotion from the Primera B Nacional to the Argentine Primera. He resigned ten games into the Apertura 2000 tournament. After spells at Uni√≥n Central in Bolivia as head coach, a return to Almagro as coach, and then Real Murcia as athletic director and coach, he joined Al-Ittihad Jeddah in Saudi Arabia as director of football for the 2008‚Äì09 season. He managed M√°laga B between 2006 and 2007. In August 2012, Husillos joined M√°laga CF, then managed by Manuel Pellegrini, as sporting director, with a contract that ran until June 2013. In December 2013, he returned for a second spell in the role. He returned to M√°laga, again as sporting director, in October 2017. He came in for criticism for his transfer selections in a season that ended in relegation to the Segunda Division. He left the role on 8 June 2018. The following week, he was appointed director of football for English Premier League club West Ham United. Following the sacking of Manuel Pellegrini in December 2019, Husillos also left the club.

A choral symphony is a musical composition for orchestra, choir, and sometimes solo vocalists that, in its internal workings and overall musical architecture, adheres broadly to symphonic musical form.Kennedy, Oxford Dictionary, 144. The term \\"choral symphony\\" in this context was coined by Hector Berlioz when he described his Rom√©o et Juliette as such in his five-paragraph introduction to that work.\\"Avant-Propos de l'auteur\\", Reiter-Biedermann's vocal score (Winterthur, 1858), p. 1. As quoted in Holoman, 262. The direct antecedent for the choral symphony is Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Beethoven's Ninth incorporates part of the Ode an die Freude (\\"Ode to Joy\\"), a poem by Friedrich Schiller, with text sung by soloists and chorus in the last movement. It is the first example of a major composer's use of the human voice on the same level as instruments in a symphony.Peter von Winter's Schlacht-Sinfonie also uses a concluding chorus. Written in 1814, it predates Beethoven's Ninth by a decade. However, as an occasional work written in one movement, the Schlacht-Sinfonie \\"stands outside the generic tradition of the symphony\\". Bonds, New Grove (2001), 24:836. A few 19th-century composers, notably Felix Mendelssohn and Franz Liszt, followed Beethoven in producing choral symphonic works. Notable works in the genre were produced in the 20th century by Gustav Mahler, Igor Stravinsky, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Benjamin Britten and Dmitri Shostakovich, among others. The final years of the 20th century and the opening of the 21st century have seen several new works in this genre, among them compositions by Peter Maxwell Davies, Tan Dun, Philip Glass, Hans Werner Henze, Krzysztof Penderecki, William Bolcom and Robert Strassburg.\\"Robert Strassburg\\" by Neil W. Levin, Milken Archive of Jewish Music The term \\"choral symphony\\" indicates the composer's intention that the work be symphonic, even with its fusion of narrative or dramatic elements that stems from the inclusion of words. To this end, the words are often treated symphonically to pursue non-narrative ends, by use of frequent repetition of important words and phrases, and the transposing, reordering or omission of passages of the set text. The text often determines the basic symphonic outline, while the orchestra's role in conveying the musical ideas is similar in importance to that of the chorus and soloists.Kennedy, Vaughan Williams, 444. Even with a symphonic emphasis, a choral symphony is often influenced in musical form and content by an external narrative, even in parts where there is no singing. History Ludwig van Beethoven redefined the symphony genre by introducing words and voices in his Ninth Symphony. The symphony had established itself by the end of the 18th century as the most prestigious of instrumental genres. While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists.Larue and Wolf, New Grove (2000), 24:812 Because of its lack of written text for focus, it was seen as a vehicle for entertainment rather than for social, moral or intellectual ideas. As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, thanks in part to efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige. A concurrent change in attitude toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, once seen as a handicap, became considered a virtue.Bonds, New Grove (2001), 24:835. In 1824, Beethoven redefined the symphony genre in his Ninth by introducing text and voice into a previously instrumental genre. His doing so sparked a debate on the future of the symphony itself. Beethoven's use of words, according to Richard Wagner, had shown \\"the limits of purely instrumental music\\" and marked \\"the end of the symphony as a vital genre\\".As cited in Bonds, New Grove (2000), 24:837. Others were not sure how to proceed‚Äîwhether to emulate the Ninth by writing symphonies with choral finales, or to develop the symphony genre in a purely instrumental fashion.Bonds, New Grove (2001), 24:837. Eventually, musicologist Mark Evan Bonds writes, the symphony was seen \\"as an all-embracing, cosmic drama that transcended the realm of sound alone\\".Bonds, New Grove (2001), 24:838. Some composers both emulated and expanded upon Beethoven's model. Berlioz showed in his choral symphony Rom√©o et Juliette a fresh approach to the epic nature of the symphony as he used voices to blend music and narrative but saved crucial moments of that narrative for the orchestra alone. In doing so, Bonds writes, Berlioz illustrates for subsequent composers \\"new approaches for addressing the metaphysical in the realm of the symphony\\". Mendelssohn wrote his Lobgesang as a work for chorus, soloists and orchestra. Labeling the work a \\"symphony-cantata\\", he expanded the choral finale to nine movements by including sections for vocal soloists, recitatives and sections for chorus; this made the vocal part longer than the three purely orchestral sections that preceded it.Todd, New Grove (2001), 16:403. Liszt wrote two choral symphonies, following in these multi-movement forms the same compositional practices and programmatic goals he had established in his symphonic poems. Krzysztof Penderecki wrote his Seventh Symphony to celebrate the third millennium of the city of Jerusalem. After Liszt, Mahler took on the legacy of Beethoven in his early symphonies, in what Bonds terms \\"their striving for a utopian finale\\". Towards this end Mahler used a chorus and soloists in the finale of his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\". In his Third, he wrote a purely instrumental finale following two vocal movements, and in his Fourth a vocal finale is sung by a solo soprano.Bonds, New Grove (2001), 24:839. After writing his Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Symphonies as purely instrumental works, Mahler returned to the vein of \\"festival-symphonic ceremonial\\" in his Eighth Symphony, which integrates text throughout the body of the work.Franklin, New Grove (2001), 15:622. After Mahler, the choral symphony became a more common genre, taking a number of compositional turns in the process. Some composers, such as Britten, Rachmaninoff, Shostakovich and Vaughan Williams, followed symphonic form strictly. Others, such as Havergal Brian, Alfred Schnittke and Karol Szymanowski, chose either to expand symphonic form or to use different symphonic structures altogether.MacDonald, notes for Naxos 8.570308, 3.Samson, 122, 126.Weitzman, notes for Chandos 9463, 5. Throughout the history of the choral symphony, works have been composed for special occasions. One of the earliest was Mendelssohn's Lobgesang, commissioned by the city of Leipzig in 1840 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type. More than a century later, Henryk G√≥recki's Second Symphony, subtitled \\"Copernican\\", was commissioned in 1973 by the Kosciuszko Foundation in New York to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus.Kosz, notes for Naxos 8.555375, 2. In between these two works, in 1930, conductor Serge Koussevitzky asked Stravinsky to write the Symphony of Psalms for the 50th anniversary of the Boston Symphony OrchestraSteinberg, Choral Masterworks, 265. and, in 1946, composer Henry Barraud, then head of Radiodiffusion Fran√ßaise, commissioned Darius Milhaud to write his Third Symphony, subtitled \\"Te Deum\\", to commemorate the end of World War II.Palmer, New Grove (1980), 12:306.Penguin, 774. In the final years of the 20th century and the early years of the 21st, more such choral symphonies were written. Krzysztof Penderecki's Seventh Symphony was for the third millennium of the city of Jerusalem.Whitehouse, notes to Naxos 8.557766 2. Tan Dun's Symphony 1997: Heaven Earth Mankind commemorated the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong that year to the People's Republic of China.Author unknown, notes for Sony Classical SK 63368, 4. Philip Glass's Fifth Symphony as one of several pieces commissioned to celebrate the beginning of the 21st century.Glass (1999) Paul Spicer's choral symphony Unfinished Remembering (2014, libretto by Euan Tait) was commissioned to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. General features Like an oratorio or an opera, a choral symphony is a musical work for orchestra, choir and (often) solo voices, although a few have been written for unaccompanied voices. Berlioz, who in 1858 first coined the term when describing his work Rom√©o et Juliette, explained the distinctive relationship he envisaged between voice and orchestra: > Even though voices are often used, it is neither a concert opera nor a > cantata, but a choral symphony. If there is singing, almost from the > beginning, it is to prepare the listener's mind for the dramatic scenes > whose feelings and passions are to be expressed by the orchestra. It is also > to introduce the choral masses gradually into the musical development, when > their too sudden appearance would have damaged the compositions's unity.... Unlike oratorios or operas, which are generally structured dramaturgically into arias, recitatives and choruses, a choral symphony is structured like a symphony, in movements. It may employ the traditional four-movement scheme of a fast opening movement, slow movement, scherzo and finale, or as with many instrumental symphonies, it may use a different structure of movements.Bonds, New Grove (2001), 24:833. The written text in a choral symphony shares equal standing with the music, as in an oratorio, and the chorus and soloists share equality with the instruments.Steinberg, Choral Masterworks, 268; Kennedy, Vaughan Williams, 444. Over time the use of text allowed the choral symphony to evolve from an instrumental symphony with a choral finale, as in the Beethoven's Ninth, to a composition that can use voices and instruments throughout the entire composition, as in Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms or Mahler's Eighth Symphony.Kennedy, Mahler, 151. Sometimes the text can give a basic outline that correlates to the four-movement scheme of a symphony. For instance, the four-part structure of Edgar Allan Poe's The Bells, a progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death, naturally suggested the four movements of a symphony to Sergei Rachmaninoff, which he followed in his choral symphony of the same name.Steinberg, Choral Masterworks, 241‚Äì242. The text can encourage a composer to expand a choral symphony past the normal bounds of the symphonic genre, as with Berlioz for his Rom√©o et Juliette, yet stay within the basic structural or aesthetic intent of symphonic form. It can also influence the musical content in parts where there is no singing, as in Rom√©o et Juliette. There, Berlioz allows the orchestra to express the majority of the drama in instrumental music and saves words for expository and narrative sections of the work. Relation of words and music As in an oratorio, the written text in a choral symphony can be as important as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, as in the case of Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, as in the case of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass. =Musical treatment of text= Walt Whitman's use of free verse became appreciated by composers seeking a more fluid approach to setting text. Vaughan Williams' program note for A Sea Symphony discusses how the text was to be treated as music. The composer writes, \\"The plan of the work is symphonic rather than narrative or dramatic, and this may be held to justify the frequent repetition of important words and phrases which occur in the poem. The words as well as the music are thus treated symphonically.\\"Kennedy, Vaughan Williams, 444 Walt Whitman's poems inspired him to write the symphony,Cox, The Symphony, 2:115. and Whitman's use of free verse became appreciated at a time where fluidity of structure was becoming more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. This fluidity helped facilitate the non-narrative, symphonic treatment of text that Vaughan Williams had in mind. In the third movement in particular, the text is loosely descriptive and can be \\"pushed about by the music\\", some lines being repeated, some not consecutive in the written text immediately following one another in the music, and some left out entirely.Ottaway, Vaughan Williams Symphonies, 17. Vaughan Williams was not the only composer following a non-narrative approach to his text. Mahler took a similar, perhaps even more radical approach in his Eighth Symphony, presenting many lines of the first part, \\"Veni, Creator Spiritus\\", in what music writer and critic Michael Steinberg referred to as \\"an incredibly dense growth of repetitions, combinations, inversions, transpositions and conflations\\". He does the same with Goethe's text in Part Two of the symphony, making two substantial cuts and other changes.Steinberg, The Symphony, 335. Other works take the use of text as music still further. Vaughan Williams uses a chorus of women's voices wordlessly in his Sinfonia Antartica, based on his music for the film Scott of the Antarctic, to help set the bleakness of the overall atmosphere.Ottaway, 50, 53. While a chorus is used in the second and third movements of Glass's Seventh Symphony, also known as A Toltec Symphony, the text contains no actual words; the composer states that it is instead formed \\"from loose syllables that add to the evocative context of the overall orchestral texture\\".Freed (2005) =Music and words as equals= Igor Stravinsky used chorus and orchestra in his Symphony of Psalms \\"on an equal footing\\". Stravinsky said about the texts of his Symphony of Psalms that \\"it is not a symphony in which I have included Psalms to be sung. On the contrary, it is the singing of the Psalms that I am symphonizing\\".White, Stravinsky, 321. This decision was as much musical as it was textual. Stravinsky's counterpoint required several musical voices to function simultaneously, independent melodically and rhythmically, yet interdependent harmonically. They would sound very different when heard separately, yet harmonious when heard together.Sachs and Dahlhaus, New Grove (2001), 6:564‚Äì569. To facilitate maximum clarity in this interplay of voices, Stravinsky used \\"a choral and instrumental ensemble in which the two elements should be on an equal footing, neither of them outweighing the other\\".Stravinsky, Chronicles, as cited in White, Stravinsky, 321. Mahler's intent in writing his Eighth Symphony for exceptionally large forces was a similar balance between vocal and instrumental forces. It was not simply an attempt at grandiose effect, though the composer's use of such forces earned the work the subtitle \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\" from his press agent (a name still applied to the symphony).Kennedy, Mahler, 100. Like Stravinsky, Mahler makes extensive and extended use of counterpoint, especially in the first part, \\"Veni Creator Spiritus\\". Throughout this section, according to music writer Michael Kennedy, Mahler displays considerable mastery in manipulating multiple independent melodic voices.Kennedy, Mahler, 152. Musicologist Deryck Cooke adds that Mahler handles his huge forces \\"with extraordinary clarity\\".Cooke, 93. Vaughan Williams also insisted on a balance between words and music in A Sea Symphony, writing in his program note for the work, \\"It is also noticeable that the orchestra has an equal share with the chorus and soloists in carrying out the musical ideas\\". Music critic Samuel Langford, writing about the premiere of the work for The Manchester Guardian, concurred with the composer, writing, \\"It is the nearest approach we have to a real choral symphony, one in which the voices are used throughout just as freely as the orchestra.\\"Cited in Kennedy, Vaughan Williams, 99. In his Leaves of Grass: A Choral Symphony, Robert Strassburg composed a symphonic \\"musical setting\\" in ten movements for the poetry of Walt Whiteman while balancing the contributions of a narrator, a chorus and an orchestra. =Words determining symphonic form= Yevtushenko's poems about the terror under Stalin (pictured) and other Soviet abuses inspired Shostakovich to write his Thirteenth Symphony Rachmaninoff's choral symphony The Bells reflected the four-part progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death in Poe's poem. Britten reversed the pattern for his Spring Symphony‚Äîthe four sections of the symphony represent, in its composer's words, \\"the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means.... It is in the traditional four movement shape of a symphony, but with the movements divided into shorter sections bound together by a similar mood or point of view.\\"Britten, Benjamin, \\"A Note on the Spring Symphony\\", Music Survey, Spring 1950. As quoted in White, Britten, 62. The gestation of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, was only slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with \\"A Career\\" as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: \\"'At the Store' is a tribute to the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity\\".Maes, 366. Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.Schwarz, New Grove (1980), 17:270. In other cases, the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures. Havergal Brian allowed the form of his Fourth Symphony, subtitled \\"Das Siegeslied\\" (Psalm of Victory), to be dictated by the three-part structure of his text, Psalm 68; the setting of Verses 13‚Äì18 for soprano solo and orchestra forms a quiet interlude between two wilder, highly chromatic martial ones set for massive choral and orchestral forces.Truscott, The Symphony, 2:143‚Äì144; MacDonald, notes for Naxos 8.570308, 3. Likewise, Szymanowski allowed the text by 13th- century Persian poet Rumi to dictate what Dr. Jim Samson calls the \\"single tripartite movement\\"Samson, 122. and \\"overall arch structure\\"Samson, 126. of his Third Symphony, subtitled \\"Song of the Night\\". =Words expanding symphonic form= Mahler first expanded the model set by Beethoven's Ninth, then abandoned it. A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Rom√©o et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement ‚Äì the \\"Queen Mab Scherzo\\" ‚Äì to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows.Holoman, 262‚Äì263. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \\"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five- movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\\"Holoman, 263. Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\", the vocal fourth movement, \\"Urlicht\\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale.Franklin, New Grove (2001), 15:618. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone.Mitchell, New Grove, 11:515. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Gothic\\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture.MacDonald, New Grove (2001), 4:341. The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the Te Deum. Symphonies for unaccompanied chorus A few composers have written symphonies for unaccompanied chorus, in which the choir performs both vocal and instrumental functions. Granville Bantock composed three such works‚ÄîAtalanta in Calydon (1911), Vanity of Vanities (1913) and A Pageant of Human Life (1913). His Atalanta, called by musicologist Herbert Antcliffe \\"the most important [work of the three] alike in technical experiment and in inspiration\\",Antcliffe, 337. was written for a choir of at least 200, the composer specifying \\"'not less than 10 voices for each part,'\\" a work with 20 separate vocal parts.Cited in McVeagh, 5. Using these forces, Bantock formed groups \\"of different weights and colors to get something of the varied play of tints and perspective [of an orchestra]\\".Musicologist Ernest Newman, cited in McVeagh, 6. In addition, the choir is generally divided into three sections, approximating the timbres of woodwinds, brass and strings.Antcliffe, 338. Within these divisions, Antcliffe writes, > Almost every possible means of vocal expression is employed separately or in > combination with others. To hear the different parts of the choir describing > in word and tone \\"laughter\\" and \\"tears\\" respectively at the same time is to > realize how little the possibilities of choral singing have as yet been > grasped by the ordinary conductor and composer. Such combinations are > extremely effective when properly achieved, but they are very difficult to > achieve. Roy Harris wrote his Symphony for Voices in 1935 for a cappella choir split into eight parts. Harris focused on harmony, rhythm and dynamics, allowing the text by Walt Whitman to dictate the choral writing.Profitt, notes for Albany TROY 164. \\"In a real sense, the human strivings so vividly portrayed in Whitman's poetry find a musical analog to the trials to which the singers are subjected\\", John Profitt writes both of the music's difficulty for performers and of its highly evocative quality. Malcolm Williamson wrote his Symphony for Voices between 1960 and 1962, setting texts by Australian poet James McAuley. Lewis Mitchell writes that the work is not a symphony in any true sense, but rather a four-movement work preceded by an invocation for solo contralto.Mitchell, 2. The text is a combination of poems celebrating the Australian wilderness and visionary Christianity, its jagged lines and rhythms matched by the music. Mitchell writes, \\"Of all his choral works, with the possible exception of the Requiem for a Tribe Brother, the Symphony is the most Australian in feeling\\".Mitchell, 2‚Äì3. Programmatic intent Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem. Penderecki's Seventh Symphony, subtitled \\"Seven Gates of Jerusalem\\", is \\"pervaded by the number 'seven' at various levels\\". Some recent efforts have paid less attention to symphonic form and more to programmic intent. Hans Werner Henze wrote his 1997 Ninth Symphony in seven movements, basing the structure of the symphony on the novel The Seventh Cross by Anna Seghers. The novel recounts the flight of seven fugitives from a Nazi prison camp, the seven crosses symbolizing the seven death sentences; the ordeal of the one prisoner who makes it to freedom becomes the crux of the text.Schluren, notes to EMI 56513, 13. Penderecki's Seventh Symphony, subtitled \\"Seven Gates of Jerusalem\\" and originally conceived as an oratorio, is not only written in seven movements but, musicologist Richard Whitehouse writes, is \\"pervaded by the number 'seven' at various levels.\\" An extensive system of seven-note phrases binds the work together, as well as the frequent use of seven notes repeated at a single pitch. Seven chords played fortissimo bring the work to a close.Whitehouse, notes to Naxos 8.557766, 2. Philip Glass's Fifth Symphony, completed in 1999 and subtitled \\"Requiem, Bardo and Nirmanakaya\\", is written in 12 movements to fulfill its programmatic intent. Glass writes, \\"My plan has been for the symphony to represent a broad spectrum of many of the world's great 'wisdom' traditions\\", synthesizing \\"a vocal text that begins before the world's creation, passes through earthly life and paradise, and closes with a future dedication\\". Glass writes that he considered the millennium at the beginning of the 21st century to be a symbolic bridge between past, present and spiritual rebirth. More recently, Glass based the philosophical and musical structure for his Seventh Symphony on the Wirrarika sacred trinity. Glass wrote about the work's respective movement headings and their relation to the overall structure of the symphony, \\"'The Corn' represents a direct link between Mother Earth and the well-being of human beings.... 'The Sacred Root' is found in the high deserts of north and central Mexico, and is understood to be the doorway to the world of the Spirit. 'The Blue Deer' is considered the holder of the Book of Knowledge. Any man or woman who aspires to be a 'Person of Knowledge' will, through arduous training and effort, have to encounter the Blue Deer....\\" =Words changing programmatic intent= Addition of a text can effectively change the programmatic intent of a composition, as with the two choral symphonies of Franz Liszt. Both the Faust and Dante symphonies were conceived as purely instrumental works and only later became choral symphonies.Shulstad, 217, 219. However, while Liszt authority Humphrey Searle asserts that Liszt's later inclusion of a chorus effectively sums up Faust and makes it complete,Searle, The Symphony, 1:269. another Liszt expert, Reeves Shulstad, suggests that Liszt changed the work's dramatic focus to the point of meriting a different interpretation of the work itself. According to Shulstad, \\"Liszt's original version of 1854 ended with a last fleeting reference to Gretchen and an ... orchestral peroration in C major, based on the most majestic of themes from the opening movement. One might say that this conclusion remains within the persona of Faust and his imagination\\".Shulstad, 217. When Liszt rethought the piece three years later, he added a \\"Chorus mysticus\\", the male chorus singing the final words from Goethe's Faust. The tenor soloist, accompanied by the chorus, sings the last two lines of the text. \\"With the addition of the 'Chorus Mysticus' text\\", Shulstad writes, \\"the Gretchen theme has been transformed and she no longer appears as a masked Faust. With this direct association to the final scene of the drama we have escaped Faust's imaginings and are hearing another voice commenting on his striving and redemption\\".Shulstad, 219. From Paradiso Canto 31 by Dante Alighieri. Illustration by Gustave Dor√©. Dante's hearing the music of Heaven from afar. Likewise, Liszt's inclusion of a choral finale in his Dante Symphony changed both the structural and programmatic intent of the work. Liszt's intent was to follow the structure of the Divina Commedia and compose Dante in three movements‚Äîone each for the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a Magnificat, at the end of the second.Shulstad, 220. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at the heights of Heaven and hear its music from afar.Searle, \\"Liszt, Franz\\", New Grove, 11:45. Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise. Conversely, a text can also spark the birth of a choral symphony, only for that work to become a purely instrumental one when the programmatic focus of the work changes. Shostakovich originally planned his Seventh Symphony as a single-movement choral symphony much like his Second and Third Symphonies. Shostakovich reportedly intended to set a text for the Seventh from the Ninth Psalm, on the theme of vengeance for the shedding of innocent blood.Volkov, Testimony, 184; Arnshtam interview with Sofiya Khentova in Khentova, In Shostakovich's World (Moscow, 1996), 234, as quoted in Wilson, 171‚Äì172. In doing this he was influenced by Stravinsky; he had been deeply impressed with the latter's Symphony of Psalms, which he wanted to emulate in this work.Volkov, Shostakovich and Stalin, 175. While the Ninth Psalm's theme conveyed Shostakovich's outrage over Stalin's oppression,Volkov, St. Petersburg, 427. a public performance of a work with such a text would have been impossible before the German invasion. Hitler's aggression made the performance of such a work feasible, at least in theory; the reference to \\"blood\\" could then be associated at least officially with Hitler. With Stalin appealing to the Soviets' patriotic and religious sentiments, the authorities were no longer suppressing Orthodox themes or images.Volkov, St. Petersburg, 427‚Äì428. Nevertheless, Shostakovich eventually realized that the work encompassed far more than this symbology.Steinberg, The Symphony, 557. He expanded the symphony to the traditional four movements and made it purely instrumental. =Supplanting text wordlessly= While Berlioz allowed the programmatic aspects of his text to shape the symphonic form of Rom√©o and to guide its content, he also showed how an orchestra could supplant such a text wordlessly to further illustrate it. He wrote in his preface to Rom√©o: Berlioz allowed text to dictate symphonic form in Rom√©o but allowed the music to supplant the text wordlessly. > If, in the famous garden and cemetery scenes the dialogue of the two lovers, > Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets > of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and > easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a > symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been > handled vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as > well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because > the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the > musician that he had to give his imagination a latitude that the positive > sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to > instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by > its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case. As a manifesto, this paragraph became significant for the amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition.Holoman, 261. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express the majority of the drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words.MacDonald, New Grove (1980), 2:596. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Rom√©o, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the structure of a choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony.Temperley, New Grove (1980), 18:460. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz. More recently, Alfred Schnittke allowed the programmatic aspects of his texts to dictate the course of both his choral symphonies even when no words were being sung. Schnittke's six- movement Second Symphony, following the Ordinary of the Mass of the Roman Catholic Church, works programmatically on two levels simultaneously. While soloists and chorus briefly perform the mass, set to chorales taken from the Gradual,Ivashkin, notes for Chandos 9519, 5. the orchestra provides an extended running commentary that can continue much longer than the section of the mass being performed. Sometimes the commentary follows a particular chorale but more often is freer and wider ranging in style. Despite the resulting stylistic disparity, biographer Alexander Ivashkin comments, \\"musically almost all these sections blend the choral [sic] tune and subsequent extensive orchestral 'commentary.'\\" The work becomes what Schnittke called an \\"Invisible Mass\\",As cited in Ivanskin, notes to Chandos 9519, 5. and Ivashkin termed \\"a symphony against a chorale backdrop\\". The program in Schnittke's Fourth Symphony, reflecting the composer's own religious dilemma at the time it was written, is more complex in execution, with the majority of it expressed wordlessly. In the 22 variations that make up the symphony's single movement,The actual number of variations in the Schnittke Fourth Symphony is \\"a subtle non-synchronicity\\" of the piece, considering the \\"3 by 5 scheme\\" of the Rosary these variations are reportedly based on. Weitzman, notes for Chandos 9463, 5. Schnittke enacts the 15 traditional Mysteries of the Rosary, which highlight important moments in the life of Christ.Weitzman, notes for Chandos 9463, 6. As he did in the Second Symphony, Schnittke simultaneously gives a detailed musical commentary on what is being portrayed. Schnittke does this while using church music from the Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Orthodox faiths, the orchestral texture becoming extremely dense from the many musical strands progressing at the same time.Moody, New Grove (2001), 22:566.Ivashkin, Schnittke, 161. A tenor and a countertenor also sing wordlessly at two points in the symphony. The composition saves words for a finale that uses all four types of church music contrapuntallyWeitzman, notes for Chandos 9463, 7. as a four-part choir sings the Ave Maria. The choir can choose whether to sing the Ave Maria in Russian or Latin. The programmatic intent of using these different types of music, Ivashkin writes, is an insistence by the composer \\"on the idea ... of the unity of humanity, a synthesis and harmony among various manifestations of belief\\".Ivashkin, Schnittke, 165.

Biography  According to Barthelemy-Charles Dumortier, Philippe Mouskes belonged to a family of French aristocrats and was born in the city of Tournai around the end of the 12th century.Mortier, B. C. du, \\"Sur Philippe Mousk√©s, auteur du po√´me roman des Rois de France\\", Compte rendu des s√©ances de la Commission royale d'histoire ou recueil de ses bulletins, 9, 1844, pp. 112‚Äì145 He is often confused for Philippe le Gande, bishop of Tournai from 1274, who was also called Muus.  Work: the Chronique rim√©e  Philippe Mouskes is known for his Chronique rim√©e (rhymed chronicle) of 31,150 verses, first complete versified chronicle of the kings of France, from the beginnings until Mouskes's time, probably composed between 1242 and 1272. The Chronique starts with the legend that, following the model of the Eneid, makes the Franks siblings of Trojan exiled after the fall of Troy. The most important part (a third) is devoted to the reign of Charlemagne. It ends with the reign of Louis IX, in 1242. Imitating versified chronicles like Wace's chronicle of the dukes of Normandy (12th s.), Mouskes reworks materials from the abbey of Saint-Denis. The direct historic value and the literary value of the work appear rather weak and it seems that the Chronique, judging from the number of remaining manuscripts, was \\"coldly received\\". It is known essentially by the extracts that du Cange gives in his Glossarium mediae and infimae latinitatis and in his edition of the Conquest of Constantinople by Geoffrey of Villehardouin. On the other hand, it presents a certain value as a testimony of the ideology of the French leading classes in the years following the Albigensian Crusade.

Efron It was an early example of the Moorish Revival style of synagogue architecture. History and destruction The synagogue was destroyed in 1938 on Kristallnacht. Members of the SA and SS burned down the synagogue on the night of 9 November 1938, almost one hundred years after the opening of the synagogue. A few days after the burning, the ruins were carried away \\"professionally\\" and the bill to cover these costs was handed to the Jewish congregation.

Architecture =Interior= Interior of the Synagogue in 1898 While the exterior was Romanesque, its interior featured the richly ornamented style that was to become the hallmark of Moorish Revival architecture. The elaborate Arabic-style interior had a two-tiered balcony supported by columns copied from the Alhambra. The arches and balcony fronts were richly worked with intricate polychrome foliate and lattice designs in the Moorish style.Harold Alan Meek, The Synagogue, Phaidon, London, 1995, p. 188, includes photo of interior According to Harry Frances Mallgrave, most of the ornaments \\"were painted on the plaster surfaces in imitation of more costly materials.\\"Gottfried Semper, Architect of the nineteenth century, Harry Frances Mallgrave, Yale, 1996, P.100 =Exterior= The synagogue was situated along the old city ramparts, along the river, some five hundred meters from the new theatre (known as the Semperoper) that Gottfried Semper was constructing at the same time he built the synagogue.

The abuse took place from 1971 to 1999. Background and disappearance Lydia gave birth to six children, all by her stepfather. During her imprisonment, she escaped and phoned legal aid, but her stepfather recaptured her in a family residence in Melun. She was finally freed in 1999 when her stepfather died. Abuse took place from when she was eight years old. Lydia claimed to have run away from her stepfather when he hit her too hard but was always brought back by the police when she was a minor. She claimed to have not realized that the abuse was unusual. She bears the scars of her torture from her neck to her ankles from where her captor burned her with boiling water and hydrochloric acid. She still lives in the same house with the attic where she was locked up in, but she does not venture up there anymore. Aftermath She wrote a book about her story, Le silence des autres (The Silence of Others), with the French journalist and writer Jean-Michel Caradec'h in 2008. She admitted that it was the worldwide news of the Fritzl case that made her talk; she said she wanted to be friends with Elisabeth Fritzl because she would feel less alone and she could support her. Gouardo believes the world \\"ignored her ordeal\\" as an incest and abuse victim. In her book she criticizes the media and authorities for neglecting her case, if it were not for the Fritzl case. Her stepmother Lucienne was convicted in a closed-door trial for failure to report the crimes she was aware of and for sexual abuse against one of Lydia's children, and was given a three-year suspended jail sentence, however the prosecution appealed and her sentence was increased to a four-year suspended jail sentence.¬´ Condamn√©e pour avoir ni√© les viols de sa fille ¬ª, Le Parisien, 13 March 2007.

She appeared in 13 films between 1930 and 1938. Related to Andrea Danielle Featherstone, Amaya Diane Murray, Liberty Lynn Rice, and others. Early years She was born as Bernice Jahnigen (surname later mistranscribed as Janighen) to Adolph and Clara (n√©e Sternitzky) Jahnigen in 1906 in Oakland, California. She had an elder brother, Earl. Her birth name is also sometimes found as Bernice Jahnigan. An article in the June 18, 1950, issue of the Oakland Tribune reported, \\"It was in 1918 that she first appeared as a juvenile, a pert little one with curled tresses who made an immediate impression on all who saw and heard her perform at Eastbay theaters and at lodges and veterans' gatherings.\\" She attended Oakland High School, where she studied dramatics and was active in musical comedy productions. Career With a clear coloratura, Claire took to the stage performing light opera and had no difficulty singing demanding roles. In 1927, she appeared in her first vaudeville production. She met then-leading singer Alexander Gray; they appeared in three Pre-Code films together in 1930 for Warner Bros. Gray and Claire became film's first operetta team, predating Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. Her first screen appearance was in the original film version of No, No, Nanette in the title role. (A post-Code version was made in 1940.) The other two films she made with Gray were Spring is Here and Song of the Flame. Operettas began losing popularity with audiences so Warners tried Claire in dramatic parts without much success. Claire made several more musical shorts up through the late thirties (some again with Gray), later becoming a radio and orchestra singer. In 1934, she appeared on Broadway in a short-lived musical, The Chocolate Soldier. Later life Claire was married twice but had no children. Her second marriage was to Dr. Douglas P. Morris. Death On January 17, 2003, ten days before her 97th birthday, Bernice Claire died from pneumonia in her adopted hometown of Portland, Oregon, where she had lived for many years.

In it, Brand advocates for a non-violent social revolution based on principles of spirituality and the common good. Critical response to the book was divided. While some reviewers praised its \\"charm\\" and Brand's \\"distinctive\\" voice, others complained about a lack of style and substance Context Russell Brand had been well known for some years as a comedian and actor: he had performed stand-up at the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year in 2000, and took his one-man show, the confessional Better Now, to the Edinburgh Festival in 2004; after various roles on British TV, he had gained critical acclaim for his starring role in Forgetting Sarah Marshall in 2008 and had regular roles in Hollywood comedies thereafter. He had also hosted a variety of radio shows (though had been forced to resign from the BBC after a scandal over prank phone calls) and published a memoir, My Booky Wook, and its sequel, Booky Wook 2. But increasingly he had also become known for his political views and activism: in 2009, for instance, he attended the G-20 London summit protests, and in 2012 he testified to a parliamentary committee about drug addiction. In October, 2013, Brand was offered a stint as the guest editor of an issue of the New Statesman, which he chose to dedicate to the topic of \\"revolution.\\" As he wrote in the issue's editorial, \\"Imagining the overthrow of the current political system is the only way I can be enthused about politics.\\". That same week, Brand was interviewed by Jeremy Paxman on BBC Two's current-affairs programme, Newsnight. Paxman posed to Brand the problem: \\"How, may I ask, is this revolution going to come about?\\". See also The book Revolution, then, is presented as an extended response to that question.As Brand puts it in the final sentence of the book's prologue: \\"I've given it some thought, so, here we go, sit down and strap in\\" (). Synopsis Revolution draws on Brand's own experiences and observations both as someone who has experienced considerable social mobility in his life‚Äîfrom a working class upbringing with a single mother in Grays, Essex, to Hollywood fame and fortune‚Äîand as a former drug addict who has found solace in twelve-step movements and in spirituality. \\"Change is something I'm good at,\\" Brand claims. It also draws on a range of counter-cultural authors such as Noam Chomsky, David Graeber, and Helena Norberg-Hodge, as well as on historical events from the Spanish Revolution of 1936 to Che Guevara's reflections on the Cuban Revolution of 1959, and contemporary practices such as participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre or direct democracy in Switzerland. The book argues that contemporary capitalism is manifestly unequal and unfair, to the detriment of society's winners as much as to its many victims. It also claims that contemporary democracy is a sham, and so conventional politics will never bring about real change: \\"That is why I do not vote; that is why I will never vote.\\" Instead, Brand advocates a social revolution based on two principles: \\"1) nonviolence, and 2) the radical improvement of the quality of life for ordinary people.\\" It proposes a society of \\"self-governing, fully autonomous, ecologically responsible, egalitarian communities.\\" Reception Revolution was criticised by reviewers for its lack of substance and style of writing. The writing was described as \\"atrocious: long-winded, confused and smug; filled with references to books Brand has half read and thinkers he has half understood\\" by Nick Cohen in The Observer. Robert Colville in The Daily Telegraph wrote that although \\"he comes across as palpably sincere in his convictions,\\" Brand \\"has not even the faintest fragment of an inkling of how his Revolution will come about\\" and \\"[a]s for how things would work afterwards, don‚Äôt ask.\\" Colville called the book \\"sub-undergraduate dross\\". The Atlantic magazine wrote \\"Revolution preaches but doesn't practice. There's a reason Brand‚Äôs most recent standup show is called 'Messiah Complex.' He has the zeal of the missionary and the charisma of the cult leader, along with a newfound commitment to imposing his vision upon society through deliberately undemocratic means. If he ever figures out how to communicate that vision in a less abstract and imperious way he could indeed change the world, although for better or for worse is anyone‚Äôs guess.\\"Sophie Gilbert \\"Russell Brand's Revolution Isn't About Revolution\\", The Atlantic, 5 November 2014 Notes References * External links * Revolution at Random House website * \\"Russell Brand: 'I want to address the alienation and despair'\\".

Built in 1912 as the home of the University Club, a private social club, it was from 1936 to 1999 as the international headquarters of the United Mine Workers. Under the leadership of John L. Lewis, the union played a major role in improving working conditions and pay for a large number of mine workers, with Lewis eventually founding the Congress of Industrial Organizations to improve conditions for other types of laborers. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005. The upper floors of the building have been converted to residences. Description and history The former United Mine Workers of America Building is located in downtown Washington, at the northwest corner of \\"I\\" and 15th Streets NW. One facade faces east toward McPherson Square across 15th Street, the other toward I Street. It is a six- story masonry structure, with a frame of steel and terra cotta blocks and an exterior facing of brick, limestone and bluestone. It is essentially Renaissance Revival in style, with tall rounded-arch windows on the second level, which serves as a piano nobile. The first two levels are finished in limestone, the ground floor with a rusticated finish, while the upper floors are mainly clad in buff brick. The building was originally constructed in 1912 as a five-story building to a design by George Totten, for the University Club, a private social club whose membership included many of the leading men in the city. At that time the second level was primarily a large social space, and the upper floors housed private rooms for the membership. In 1936, the club sold the building to the UMW. It restyled the interior of the building, converting the second floor into a series of meeting spaces and the office of the union president, while the upper levels were used for offices. It also added the sixth floor, removing an elaborate cornice in the process. The UMW vacated the building in 1999, and it has since been adapted for use as a primarily residential space, in part by connecting it to adjoining buildings. The building's historic significance comes mainly from its role as the UMW headquarters. The union was a major in lobbying for labor-friendly legislation during the New Deal years, and its president, John L. Lewis, was influential in broader labor organizing, founding the CIO in 1935 when the American Federation of Labor refused to support the organization of semi-skilled laborers. Lewis served as the UMW president from 1920 until 1960. The UMWA building from McPherson Square.

Usually this is an inertial reference frame or \\"inertial observer\\". Less often an observer may be an arbitrary non- inertial reference frame such as a Rindler frame which may be called an \\"accelerating observer\\". The special relativity usage differs significantly from the ordinary English meaning of \\"observer\\". Reference frames are inherently nonlocal constructs, covering all of space and time or a nontrivial part of it; thus it does not make sense to speak of an observer (in the special relativistic sense) having a location. Also, an inertial observer cannot accelerate at a later time, nor can an accelerating observer stop accelerating. Physicists use the term \\"observer\\" as shorthand for a specific reference frame from which a set of objects or events is being measured. Speaking of an observer in special relativity is not specifically hypothesizing an individual person who is experiencing events, but rather it is a particular mathematical context which objects and events are to be evaluated from. The effects of special relativity occur whether or not there is a sentient being within the inertial reference frame to witness them. History Einstein made frequent use of the word \\"observer\\" (Beobachter) in his original 1905 paper on special relativity and in his early popular exposition of the subject.Albert Einstein, Relativity: The Special and the General Theory. However he used the term in its vernacular sense, referring for example to \\"the man at the railway-carriage window\\" or \\"observers who take the railway train as their reference-body\\" or \\"an observer inside who is equipped with apparatus\\". Here the reference body or coordinate system‚Äîa physical arrangement of metersticks and clocks which covers the region of spacetime where the events take place‚Äîis distinguished from the observer‚Äîan experimenter who assigns spacetime coordinates to events far from himself by observing (literally seeing) coincidences between those events and local features of the reference body. This distinction between observer and the observer's \\"apparatus\\" like coordinate systems, measurement tools etc. was dropped by many later writers, and today it is common to find the term \\"observer\\" used to imply an observer's associated coordinate system (usually assumed to be a coordinate lattice constructed from an orthonormal right- handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector (a frame field), see Doran.). Where Einstein referred to \\"an observer who takes the train as his reference body\\" or \\"an observer located at the origin of the coordinate system\\", this group of modern writers says, for example, \\"an observer is represented by a coordinate system in the four variables of space and time\\" or \\"the observer in frame S finds that a certain event A occurs at the origin of his coordinate system\\". However, there is no unanimity on this point, with a number of authors continuing a preference for distinguishing between observer (as a concept related to state of motion) from the more abstract general mathematical notion of coordinate system (which can be, but need not be, related to motion). This approach places more emphasis on the many choices for description open to an observer. The observer is then identified with an observational reference frame, rather than with the combination of coordinate system, measurement apparatus and state of motion. It also has been suggested that the term \\"observer\\" is antiquated, and should be replaced by an observer team (or family of observers) in which each observer makes observations in their immediate vicinity, where delays are negligible, cooperating with the rest of the team to set up synchronized clocks across the entire region of observation, and all team members sending their various results back to a data collector for synthesis. \\"Observer\\" as a form of relative coordinates Relative direction is a concept found in many human languages. In English, a description of the spatial location of an object may use terms such as \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" which are relative to the speaker or relative to a particular object or perspective (e.g. \\"to your left, as you are facing the front door.\\") The degree to which such a description is subjective is rather subtle. See the Ozma Problem for an illustration of this. Some impersonal examples of relative direction in language are the nautical terms bow, aft, port, and starboard. These are relative, egocentric-type spatial terms but they do not involve an ego: there is a bow, an aft, a port, and a starboard to a ship even when no one is aboard. Special relativity statements involving an \\"observer\\" are in some measure articulating a similar kind of impersonal relative direction. An \\"observer\\" is a perspective in that it is a context from which events in other inertial reference frames are evaluated but it is not the sort of perspective that a single particular person would have: it is not localized and it is not associated with a particular point in space, but rather with an entire inertial reference frame that may exist anywhere in the universe (given certain lengthy mathematical specifications and caveats.)  Usage in other scientific disciplines  The term observer also has special meaning in other areas of science, such as quantum mechanics, and information theory. See for example, Schr√∂dinger's cat and Maxwell's demon. In general relativity the term \\"observer\\" refers more commonly to a person (or a machine) making passive local measurements, a usage much closer to the ordinary English meaning of the word. In quantum mechanics, \\"observation\\" is synonymous with quantum measurement and \\"observer\\" with a measurement apparatus and observable with what can be measured. This conflict of usages within physics is sometimes a source of confusion.

In the early 1980s, after learning Mandarin Chinese, she was one of the first foreign students at the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing, where she learned to act in the Chinese theatre (example pictured at right). She has since then helped teach and direct traditional Chinese theatre in Salzburg, Mainz, and Bayreuth. She's also been at intercultural workshops with Cardiff Laboratory Theatre and Pan Projects at Goldsmiths College, London.

In a 1999 review for the Asian Theatre Journal, China specialist Prof. Colin Mackerras (author of The Cambridge Handbook of Contemporary China, brother of Malcolm Mackerras) noted how the book \\"looks at the skills of the Chinese actor from the insider's point of view ‚Äì not that of the Westerner or the student of China.\\"Mackerras 1999.

It originally aired on May 5, 2008. Plot When Ted rejects Barney's attempts to reconcile with him, Robin is confused as to why he is more mad at Barney than her for their one-night stand. Lily reasons that it is because Ted is more focused on his relationship with Stella. After two months, Ted wants to take things to the next level, but she is reluctant and tells Ted a secret: she has not had sex in five years. When Stella comes over on the night that she is meant to have sex with Ted, Marshall and Lily accidentally reveal they know her secret. Stella is upset that Ted betrayed her trust and says she cannot trust him. When Ted asks Stella if she is looking for a reason not to sleep with him and whether it scares her that things between them are getting serious, Stella storms off without answering. Barney tries to find a \\"rebound bro\\" to whom he can be a wingman to help him get casual sex with women. He puts applications up on his blog and receives few responses except for an enthusiastic proposal from his colleague Randy. After unsuccessfully resorting to calling up old friends and previous wingmen, he decides to be the \\"bro\\" to Randy and give him a chance. Randy hasn't had sex in thirteen years and Barney is repeatedly unsuccessful at getting him together with a woman, since Randy is uncomfortable with talking to women, and gets nosebleeds whenever he gets an erection. Barney then enlists Robin's help to make Randy comfortable with small talk with women, telling Robin that he may have a sex tape with her to convince her. After another bad attempt, Robin points out that Barney is trying to fill the void left behind by Ted by rushing into wingmanship with Randy as a rebound bro. Barney agrees and tells Randy it isn't working out, but when Randy admits he was a police officer, but was fired for incompetence, Barney, knowing being in the 'force' impresses women, finds a woman who takes Randy home with her. However, he gets emotional when Robin tells him that Ted doesn't know what he's missing. Stella comes to Ted's house and admits that Ted is right: she was looking for a reason not to get too close, but has realized that she is ready to take the next step with him. Ted and Stella's relationship goes even further than expected as Ted meets Stella's daughter and gets to know her. Stella tells Ted that her sister is still in town and can take care of Stella's daughter. Stella and Ted rush to a motel, where they consummate their relationship. When Ted jokingly picks up the phone to tell Marshall and Lily about it after the deed is done, Stella pushes him off the bed in a lighthearted manner. Critical response Donna Bowman of The A.V.

He was the chief engineer of the Aristocratic Revolution initialized upon the attempted assassination of King Radama II. His excesses and participation in the regicide saw him fall from favor, ultimately being relieved of his position and replaced as Prime Minister by his younger brother Rainilaiarivony. Rainivoninahitriniony died in exile on May 5, 1868, shortly after an attempted coup meant to enable him to regain his position upon the death of Queen Rasoherina ended in failure. Early years Born in 1824, Rainivoninahitriniony was known in childhood as Raharo. He and his younger brother Rainilaiarivony were sons of Rainiharo, of the Tsimiamboholahy clan, Prime Minister to Queen Ranavalona I from 1833 to 1852. His mother was Rabodomiarana, a daughter of Ramamonjy. Their family were not andriana (nobles) by blood, but rather belonged to the class of Hova (freemen). Their family had gained a prominent position at court when Rainiharo's father was chosen by King Andrianampoinimerina to serve as a favored adviser on account of his keen acumen and unwavering loyalty. Throughout his childhood, Rainivoninahitriniony had access to the education provided by the Protestant missionaries of the London Missionary Society and was favorable to European influences and the modernization of Madagascar. As a young man, Rainivoninahitriniony became a Field Marshal in the army of Queen Ranavalona I, where he was best known for putting down a revolt of the Antefasy and Antesaka in the southeast of the island in 1852. He served as Commander-in-Chief of the army from 1852 to 1862, as well as Minister for War (1861‚Äì62) and Minister for the Interior (1862), being awarded 14 state honors in 1861 and 15 honors in 1862. Rise to Prime Minister Upon his father's death in 1852, Rainivoninahitriniony succeeded to the position of Prime Minister. He advised Queen Ranavalona I and conducted the administrative business of the state jointly with another of the Queen's long-standing advisers, a conservative elder named Rainijohary. Rainivoninahitriniony gained notice for his talents as an administrator and for his ability to work in the best interests of the State. With the death of Ranavalona in 1861, many of the old guard of conservatives who had supported her regressive policies were sidelined by her progressive son and successor Radama II. The new king favored the counsel of his entourage of young friends, known as the menamaso (\\"red- eyes\\"), to the point of undermining Rainivoninahitriniony's authority as Prime Minister - a position he now held alone after the dismissal of Rainijohary.De La Vaissi√®re, Camille. Histoire de Madagascar: ses habitants et ses missionnaires, Volume 1. At the same time, a growing faction of nobles was growing increasingly concerned with the drastic nature of Radama's reform policies. These included the Lambert Charter, which had given the French disproportionate rights to the exploitation of the island's resources, and which Rainivoninahitriniony attempted fruitlessly to contest. Rainivoninahitriniony united this group of nobles under his leadership and acted as their spokesperson in communicating their increasing frustrations to the king. Aristocratic Revolution Tension between the nobles and the king came to a head when Radama refused to reconsider his decision legalizing duels. The nobles, under the leadership of Rainivoninahitriniony, conspired to assassinate the king. At the time, the coup was generally believed to have been successful, although 20th century evidence suggests the rumors at the time that Radama had actually survived the attack and went on to live to old age as a regular citizen were in fact true. The conspirators decided to transfer the crown to Radama's apparent widow Rabodo, on the condition that power would be henceforth shared jointly between the monarchy and the nobles, symbolically represented in Rainivoninahitriniony's marriage in September 1863 to Rabodo, who took the throne name Queen Rasoherina. Under Rasoherina's reign, Rainivoninahitriniony effectively operated unhindered in his running of state affairs. At court, the conservative faction was still present under the leadership of the former co-Prime Minister to Ranavalona I, Rainijohary. However, Rainivoninahitriniony's progressives formed a majority in the Queen's Council and their advocacy for a moderately pro-European policy of modernization won out over the reversal of the policies of Radama II that were demanded by Rainijohary's conservatives.Ade Ajayi, J.F.Africa in the nineteenth century until the 1880s. UNESCO, 1989. His contemporary critics accused Rainivoninahitriniony of increasing despotism, habitual drunkenness and frequent violence as his power grew, reportedly threatening the queen at knife point on several occasions. Downfall and death Rainivoninahitriniony's involvement in the regicide plot had made him deeply unpopular among the people, and his excesses turned the opinion of many nobles against him. His fate was sealed during a visit to Ambohimanga when, upon receiving the names of individuals accused of intentionally setting a series of house fires that had ravaged Antananarivo, he sought to ensure the rapid arrest and execution of the accused conspirators. Rasoherina opposed these executions, however, sparking Rainivoninahitriniony's anger and prompting him to declare violent threats to her sovereignty. Immediately afterward, Rasoherina set about to remove Rainivoninahitriniony from power with the support of Rainivoninahitriniony's younger brother Rainilaiarivony, Commander- in-Chief of the army and influential leader among the andriana. The queen addressed the public at Andohalo, first releasing zebu into the crowd for public consumption in a bid to ensure popular approval of the transition, then announcing the deposition of Rainivoninahitriniony in favor of Rainilaiarivony, relieving the Prime Minister of his post and stripping him of his ranks on July 14, 1864. He was consequently sent into exile in Ambohimandroso, in Betsileo country, on February 20, 1865. In the final months of his life, Rainivoninahitriniony is believed to have participated in an attempted coup against the administration of his brother and the queen. On Friday, March 27, 1868, at two in the afternoon, a massive crowd armed with guns and swords attempted to storm the seat of government at the Rova of Antananarivo in the interest of exerting control over the succession of the queen, who had been growing ever weaker from dysentery since October 1867. The leaders of the group successfully captured a number of key figures, including the head of the Queen's Guard. A group of guards, however, managed to escape and raced to notify Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony, who was visiting the countryside estate where Queen Rasoherina was convalescing. The Prime Minister gave the order to arrest the conspirators, several of whom were promptly captured upon the soldiers' return to the city. At five in the evening, Rasoherina delivered a public address, asking those favorable to her rule to walk with her through the capital; a massive crowd paraded with her through the city, demonstrating their support for her continued authority. The queen then delivered a speech at Andohalo ordering the public to turn in any known conspirators to bring them to justice, before re-entering her residence at the Rova to reassure the public with her presence. However, the windows along the route to the Rova were reportedly all ordered shut, whether to protect the Queen from projectiles or to keep the nobles of the upper town from viewing the advanced state of her infirmity. The physical and emotional exertion further weakened the queen, who died four days later, on April 1, 1868. Two main theories about the role of Rainivoninahitriniony in the coup against Rasoherina were proposed although the truth was never confirmed. One theory offered that Rainivoninahitriniony had intended to establish a republic in Madagascar with himself as its president. An alternate and more probable theory maintained that Rainivoninahitriniony had formed an alliance with Protestant leaders who wished to see a male prince named Rasata placed on the throne. This prince would have been a puppet to Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, who was committed to serving the interests of his Protestant allies. Rainivoninahitriniony died in exile in Ambohimandroso on 5 May 1868.

It was a home of civil rights leader Mary Church Terrell (1863-1954), the first black woman to serve on an American school board, and a leading force in the desegregation of public accommodations in the nation's capital. Her home in the LeDroit Park section of Washington, DC was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975. and The building is a contributing property in the LeDroit Park Historic District. Description The Mary Church Terrell House stands in Washington's LeDroit Park neighborhood, southeast of Howard University, on the south side of T Street between 3rd and 4th Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story brick half-house, set on a nearly full-height raised basement. The front facade has a single bay, consisting of a polygonal window bay at the basement and first level, and a large segmented-arch window on the second floor. A smaller window is located in the half-gable above, with half of a round window set in a bed of Victorian shingles at the peak. The main entrance is via a porch on the left side; the right side of the building is a plain brick party wall for a non-existent right side. History Mary Church Terrell was born in Tennessee and educated at Oberlin College. She became a school teacher in Washington 1887, and married Robert Terrell, a prominent African-American attorney, in 1891. She stopped working at that time, but remained engaged in efforts to improve the district's schools. In 1895 she was appointed to the district's school board, the first African- American woman in the nation to sit on such a board. She served two terms, seeking to improve the quality of the district schools. She was a founder and first president of the National Association of Colored Women, and supported broad-based efforts at achieving women's suffrage. In the 1950s she was involved in efforts to challenge the district's lack of enforcement of public accommodation laws originally passed in the 1870s, participating in actions resulting in the favorable District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co. decision. Restoration Since the house has been unoccupied for a number of years, the condition was degrading and apparent to even a casual observer. In the summer of 2008 a restoration was started primarily supported in by a grant from the National Park Service Save America's Treasures program. Additional support came from Howard University, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, the DC Office of Planning and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Based on outside observation, it appears the brick work was repaired and re-pointing, major structural problems on outside porches, windows support and trim were fixed, the roof was repaired and the windows were covered properly using plywood. Since this was finished in the Summer of 2009, no more work appears to have been done. Additional information A call to the National Park Service in November, 2019 confirmed that the home is privately owned and not open to the public.

A surviving portion of the camp, now mostly demolished, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History The vast training camp built at Davisville, Rhode Island in 1942, provided more than 100,000 men of the U.S. Navy's Construction Battalions, better known as \\"Seabees,\\" with construction training during World War II. During the Vietnam War, eight Naval Mobile Construction Battalions representing some 4,000 Seabees were homeported at Davisville, in addition to 1,200 civilians. Named in honor of Rear Admiral Mordecai T. Endicott, the first Civil Engineer Corps Officer to be appointed Chief of the former Bureau of Yards and Docks, Camp Endicott (later established as the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center, Davisville) was also the birthplace of the Quonset hut. These semi-cylindrically shaped, prefabricated, portable buildings were designed and produced at Davisville and shipped to various places throughout the world. Because of its design and worldwide dispersion, the Quonset Hut is considered one of the most universal structures in the world. The Camp Endicott Historical District at Davisville was established to preserve some of these structures as well as a portion of the former Camp that played a vital role in World War II. The seven-acre District, located at the southern boundary of the Center, contained 17 huts. When the area was slated for demolition, a few of the surviving huts were relocated to the Seabee Museum and Memorial Park elsewhere on the former camp grounds.

He is also known by his Breton language pseudonym Jean-Yves Keraudren. Born in Rennes on 25 April 1910, Jeusset adopted militant Breton nationalism from his youth. Initially associated with the Breton Autonomist Party, Jeusset broke away from it to form the fascistic Breiz da Zont movement and its political wing, the Parti nationaliste int√©gral breton (Breton Integral Nationalist Party: PNIB). The party was, however, tiny. Jeusset later joined with fellow nationalist extremists Gwilherm Berthou and C√©lestin Lain√© to found Kentoc'h Mervel (Sooner Death), a group dedicated to direct action.

Jeusset linked Breton nationalism to antisemitism, writing in 1931: > It is due to our particular resistance to the conquest of sovereign French > territory by the corrupting ideas which emanate more or less from the Jews - > 'freemasonry', 'secularism' - etc, that the Bretons were decimated during > the last world war: over 200,000 of them.

Jeusset eventually joined Lain√©'s Bezen Perrot militia, which was affiliated to the SS. Captured after the war, Jeusset was sentenced to forced labour for life.

It is located at 1816 12th Street NW in the U Street Corridor (Cardozo/Shaw) neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The building was reopened on February 20, 2000 as the Thurgood Marshall Center in honor of the first African American Associate Justice to serve on the United States Supreme Court. The Thurgood Marshall Center now serves as a community center for residents of the U Street Corridor and Shaw neighborhoods. The permanent organization of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity was established in the Bowen Room. Completed in 1912, the Renaissance Revival building was designed by William Sidney Pittman, one of the United States' first African American architects and a son-in-law of Booker T. Washington. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1994 and is a contributing property to the Greater U Street Historic District. and Description and history The Thurgood Marshall Center is located on the west side of 12th Street NW, between S and T Streets. It is a large rectangular four-story masonry building, built out of red brick with trim of limestone and gray brick. Its main facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a Tuscan portico with entablature, modillioned cornice, and low balustrade above. The ground floor is finished in bands of gray brick arranged to appear as rough stone, while the upper floors are red brick with gray brick corner quoining. Limestone stringcourses serve as a water table between the basement and first floor, between the first and second floors, and above the top floor. The building is crowned by a modillioned and dentillated cornice and a low balustrade. Windows are set in pairs in each bay, with limestone keystones. The international YMCA was founded in Great Britain in 1844, and its first American branch opened in 1851. Anthony Bowen founded the first African-American branch of the organization in 1853 in Washington, one year after a branch for whites was opened in the city. The organization struggled financially in its early years, and was not formally incorporated until 1892. The organization moved into its first permanent home on 11th Street in 1891, which it soon had sell due to declining membership. After a membership drive revitalized the organization, it secured a pledge from John D. Rockefeller Sr. of $25,000, which was matched by fundraising from across the nation's African-American community. It is believed to be the first such campaign of its type in that community. This building was completed in 1912 to a design by African-American architect William Sidney Pittman. In 1973 Twelfth Street YMCA was officially renamed Anthony Bowen YMCA in honor of its founder. It closed in 1982, suffering from declining membership and mounting building maintenance costs. After undergoing restoration, it reopened in 2000 as the Thurgood Marshall Community Center.

Physically, Wotan was a tall man with a slender build and green skin. He had black hair and purple eyes. He dressed in a red costume with a green cape and green boots. Wotan first appeared in 1940 and has featured in a number of storylines. Publication history Wotan first appeared in More Fun Comics #55 (May 1940) and was created by Gardner Fox and Howard Sherman. Fictional character biography =Wotan I= The being now known as Wotan started out life as a Stone Age woman who was raped by someone claiming to be a servant of God. She studied the black arts and became such a powerful sorceress that she was worshiped as a goddess. She later learned how to switch from body to body and then to direct her own reincarnation, eventually becoming the male being now known as Wotan.Doctor Fate Vol. 2 #14. DC Comics. In the Golden Age, Wotan encountered first Green Lantern and then the sorcerer known as Doctor Fate where he became Fate's nemesis.Secret Origins Vol. 2 #24. DC Comics. At one point, he was pulled back in time with other JSA enemies by the time-traveller Per Degaton to assist in capturing the JSA and stop them from interfering in his attempt to change the events of Pearl Harbor. Wotan uses his magic aura to hold the JSA captive in caves beneath an island. The plan is foiled by the actions of the All-Star Squadron. When the Spectre is released from the aura and frees the other members, Per Degaton goes back in time, thus erasing everybody's memories of this event and returning them to their proper places.All-Star Squadron #1-3. DC Comics. During the second volume of The Spectre in the eighties, he tries to take over the body of the sorceress Zatanna, but fails.The Spectre (vol. 2) #7-8. DC Comics. In the early nineties, Wotan discovers the temple where the last body of the being known as Yahweh - God Himself - lay entombed, still seething with mystical power. While fighting the current Doctor Fate and the Justice League, Wotan enters the tower with the intention of absorbing the power, confronting God himself, and supplanting Him. Instead, he emerges blinded, his evil having been burned out by God's power. Declaring that Wotan will never menace anybody again, one of Yahweh's servants spirits Wotan away.Doctor Fate Vol. 2 #15.

As the group idolized Earth's villains, Wotan II idolized the original Wotan.Adventures of the Super Sons #7. DC Comics. Powers and abilities Wotan is a master sorcerer and a brilliant scientist who has created technological wonders that are far in advance of 20th century science. Through centuries of study, Wotan has mastered the black art of sorcery, becoming powerful enough to challenge even Doctor Fate. Wotan's magic lets him project powerful bolts of mystical force, fly, travel between dimensions, change shape, and cast a wide range of spells. His magical aura was able to hold the JSA and All-Star Squadron, and even Superman and the Spectre were unable to break loose without outside help. He can absorb the souls and powers of other beings, transfer his soul into other bodies, and even direct the course of his own reincarnation. Other versions In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Wotan is reintroduced in issue #9 of Earth 2 as Karel Wotan. Appearing once again as a woman, Wotan is \\"the mage of an organization that seeks to augment its control of magic in the world.\\" She is portrayed as an ancient sorcerer who started life as a female Viking and later mastered the arts of sorcery having lived several lifetimes with altered genders.

They started working on a similar (although smaller) idea in Avil√©s. In the summer of 1997 the project received a small budget from the Asturian regional government and another one from Avil√©s Town Hall. The festival was held again in the following year. In 2006, 1,175 people took part in the festival with 150 acts and performances over eleven days. There were 800 musicians, dancers and actors in the parade. In 2008 it was officially named by the Regional Authorities of the Principality of Asturies, as the \\"Fiesta de Inter√©s Tur√≠stico Regional\\"(Celebration of Regional Tourist Interest). In 2010 choirs from Wales participated in the festival, namely The Port Talbot Cymric Male Choir and Cor Meibion Y Fflint (Flint Male Voice Choir).

The estate, which originally included a 3-1/2 story Queen Anne/Stick style residence, gatehouse, and other buildings, was designed by John M. Merrick and was built in 1883. Dunmere was commissioned by Robert G. Dun (of Dun and Bradstreet fame) and served as his summer home until his death. It consisted of with of ocean frontage. Major buildings included the main home, located close to the ocean, The Gardener's Cottage, located atop the hill, overlooking the property, the stable and the impressive stone archway, traversing Dunmere's entrance gates. In addition to a mosaic swimming pool and vast gardens, Dunmere featured a pond on the waterfront, man-made from an unsightly swamp at the same location. Following a massive and all-engulfing fire of the main house, the property has since been split into three residential properties. Only the Gardener's Cottage and entrance gates remain standing today. The surviving elements of the estate were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

At its 1883 dedication, Commissioner George Carmichael, Jr. referred to it as \\"the oldest military post on the Atlantic coast.\\" History Archaeological excavations have shown that people lived on Fort Neck long before the Europeans arrived, although this was never a large village. But around 1620, many Niantic people settled at this place (cousins and allies of the larger Narragansett tribe), growing corn, making wampum (shell beads used as money in trade with the settlers), and trading with the Dutch and English Colonists for such things as beads, pipes, and copper kettles. Ninigret, for whom the fort was named, was the sachem of the Niantics by the 1630s. Most historians believe that the fort was built by the Dutch West India Company or by Portuguese explorers prior to 1637, in addition to the earlier trading post on nearby Dutch Island. One of the first printed references to Dutch forts in Rhode Island was Samuel Arnold's 1858 History of the State of Rhode Island. In 1921‚àí22, a European sword and cannon were found at an Indian cemetery near the site, along with many other goods which demonstrate that this was a European fort. The artifacts are now in the possession of the Rhode Island Historical Society. King Philip's War (1675‚Äì76) cemented Colonial rule over most of the Indian lands of Rhode Island, but a reservation was set aside for the tribe encompassing much of today's Charlestown. Many Narragansetts had joined Ninigret's people for safety, and soon the name Niantic fell out of use. At Fort Ninigret, tribal members lived in wigwams into the 18th century. Nearby stood the European-style house of the sachems, who sold off tribal property to the Colonists to pay their debts. By the 19th century, Fort Neck was the last piece of land held in common by the Narragansett tribe which had access to salt water. In 1883, the state abolished relations with the tribe, instead conferring upon its members the rights and duties of US citizenship. As part of this process, the state transformed the remains of Fort Ninigret into a monument to the 250 years of positive relations between the Narragansett Indians (and their modern descendants) with their non-Indian neighbors. The state reshaped the earthen banks of the fort, under the direction of the commissioners of the Narragansett Indian Tribe, planted evergreens, and erected an iron fence along the outlines of the old fort. A boulder was moved from the nearby hills and inscribed with these words: > Fort Ninigret Memorial of the Narragansett and Niantic Indians Unwavering > Friends and Allies of Our Fathers Erected by the State of Rhode Island > Dwight R. Adams, William P. Sheffield, Jr., George Carmichael, Jr.: Comrs > 1883 Acts and Resolves of the General Assembly of the State of Rhode Island > and Providence Plantations, 1883. Henry Ward, Secretary. Gideon L. Ammons and Joshua H. Noka spoke at the monument's dedication, both members of the Indian Council. In 1983, the federal government acknowledged that the Narragansetts were still alive and well in Rhode Island, and they were once again recognized as a tribe. Today Fort Ninigret is maintained by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and the Charlestown Historical Society. Fort Ninigret was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Archaeological excavations were conducted there during the 1970s by the Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission and by archaeologists from New York University.

Service recipients are generally employers, but those who hire independent contractors are also service recipients. Service providers include executives, general employees, some independent contractors and board members, as well as entities that provide services (an LLC, for example, could be a service provider). History Section 409A was added to the Internal Revenue Code, effective January 1, 2005, under Section 885 of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The effects of Section 409A are far-reaching, because of the exceptionally broad definition of \\"deferral of compensation.\\" Section 409A was enacted, in part, in response to the practice of Enron executives accelerating the payments under their deferred compensation plans in order to access the money before the company went bankrupt, and also in part in response to a history of perceived tax-timing abuse due to limited enforcement of the constructive receipt tax doctrine. Basic summary Section 409A generally provides that \\"non-qualified deferred compensation\\" must comply with various rules regarding the timing of deferrals and distributions. Under regulations issued by the IRS, Section 409A applies whenever there is a \\"deferral of compensation,\\" which occurs whenever an employee has a legally binding right during a taxable year to compensation that is or may be payable in a later taxable year. There are various exceptions, excluding from the Section 409A rules compensation that would otherwise fall within this definition, including: qualified plans like the pension and 401(k) plans, and welfare benefits including vacation leave, sick leave, disability pay, or death benefit plan. Other exceptions include those for \\"short-term deferrals\\" (i.e. payments made within 2.5 months of the year in which the deferred compensation is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture), certain stock option and stock appreciation rights and certain separation pay plans. Qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation Section 409A makes a distinction between deferred compensation plans and deferral of compensation. The term \\"plan\\" includes any agreement, method, program, or other arrangement, including an agreement, method, program, or other arrangement that applies to one person or individual. Section 409A specifies that unless any deferred compensation falls into a specified set of \\"qualified deferred compensation\\" categories, the IRS will automatically consider it unqualified deferred compensation. The qualified deferred compensation categories are: * Qualified employer plans (these are basically employer retirement plans) * Certain foreign plans * Section 457 plans * Certain welfare benefits * Stock options Timing restrictions Section 409A's timing restrictions fall into three main categories: * restrictions on the timing of distributions * restrictions against the acceleration of benefits * restrictions on the timing of deferral elections Distributions under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan can only be payable upon one of six circumstances: * the employee's separation from service * the employee's becoming disabled * the employee's death * a fixed time or schedule specified under the plan * a change in ownership or effective control of the corporation, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation * the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency In addition, Section 409A provides that with respect to certain \\"key employees\\" of publicly traded corporations, distributions upon separation from service must be delayed by an additional six months following separation (or death, if earlier). Key employees are generally the top 50 employees with pay above $150,000. The rules restricting the timing of elections as to the time or form of payment under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan fall into two categories: * initial deferral elections * subsequent deferral elections As a general rule, initial deferral elections must be made no later than the close of the employee's taxable year immediately preceding the service year. The term \\"initial deferral elections\\" includes all decisions, whether made by the employee or employer, as to the time or form of payment under the plan. Once the initial deferral election is made, a change to the time or form of payment under the plan can only be made under the rules governing subsequent deferral elections. Penalties Section 409A assigns compliance-failure penalties to the recipient of deferred compensation (the \\"service provider\\") and not to the company offering the compensation (the \\"service recipient\\"). The sanctions for non-compliance can be severe. The specific penalties written into law are: * all compensation deferred for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years becomes includible in gross income for the taxable year to the extent the compensation is not subject to a \\"substantial risk of forfeiture\\" and has not previously been included in gross income * accrued interest on the taxable amount * an additional penalty of 20% of the deferred compensation which is required to be included in gross income Impact on privately-held companies One area of concern in early drafts of 409A was the impact on companies with stock that is not readily tradeable on an established securities market and these companies' employees. As of 2014, approximately 8.5 million American workers held stock options. Since options often vest and become taxable more than 1 year after they are granted, it would seem that 409A would apply to this as a form of deferred compensation. However, 409A specifically does not apply to incentive stock options (ISOs) and non-qualified stock options (NSOs) granted at fair market value. However, if a company issues options to a service provider at a valuation below fair market value, section 409A will apply. The fair market value of an option on common stock is defined as the fair market value of the common stock (the underlying security) on the date of issuance. Therefore, the valuation of common stock is critical. Anticipating this problem, those drafting the regulations created a set of valuation standards for companies. The code provided a way for companies to achieve a safe-harbor valuation. A safe-harbor valuation is one where the IRS must accept the valuation as valid unless the IRS can demonstrate that the valuation is \\"grossly unreasonable\\". The code provides three possible ways for companies to achieve a safe-harbor valuation of their common stock: * Securing an independent appraisal * Using a generally applicable repurchase formula * In the case of an illiquid startup, securing a valuation by a qualified individual or individuals applied at a time that the corporation did not otherwise anticipate a change in control event or public offering of the stock The code defines \\"illiquid stock of a startup corporation\\" as stock of a corporation that meets the following criteria: * the corporation is less than 10 years old * the corporation has no class of equity security that is publicly traded * the stock granted is not subject to a put, call or similar derivative * neither the company nor the stock recipient could reasonably anticipate that the company would be acquired within 90 days or go public within 180 days Industry commentators pushed for specific guidelines regarding the definition of a \\"qualified individual\\" who could perform the valuation for an illiquid startup. The final regulations did not provide specific examples of the qualifications necessary to perform a 409A valuation for an illiquid startup, highlighting that the requisite experience \\"could be obtained in many ways\\". However, the final regulations clarified that: * the standard to be applied is whether it would be reasonable to rely on the advice of the person performing the valuation in deciding whether to accept an offer to purchase or sell the stock being valued and * having the requisite experience generally means having at least five years of relevant experience in business valuation or appraisal, financial accounting, investment banking, private equity, secured lending, or other comparable experience Given the small budgets of illiquid startups, many industry participants (including companies and their investors) became frustrated by the need to pay for potentially costly valuations by independent valuation firms. Some valuations could initially cost $50,000, a sum that most startups could never pay. However, recent 409A valuation prices for startup companies have decreased to $1,500‚Äì5,000 range, depending on the stage of the company receiving the valuation. For pre-IPO companies and very late-stage companies the prices can be significantly higher as the need for more frequent valuations increases. Criticisms of IRC 409A Industry commentators have had ongoing concerns with Section 409A. From its announcement and finalization, the IRS itself has recognized that many industry commentators have expressed concerns about the complexity and reasonableness of several aspects of the law. Particular criticisms have included: * 409A adds complexity and cost to some business transactions that do not even create tax advantages * 409A's scope is too broad and captures non-tax-motivated transactions * Its technical complexity can be a trap to the unaware or unsophisticated * Its complexity may also limit the ability for people to engage in legitimate deferred compensation transactions  See also  * Nonqualified deferred compensation References  External links  * Internal Revenue Code Section 409A at Cornell's Legal Information Institute * 10 Year Expiration of Incentive Stock Options 0409a Category:Employee compensation in the United States ","title":"Internal Revenue Code section 409A"},{"id":"17385739","text":"The Gladstone Springhouse and Bottling Plant is an historic water bottling facility at 145a Boon Street in Narragansett, Rhode Island. The springhouse was constructed in 1899 by T. G. Hazard, Jr. The bottling plant building may date from as early as 1911. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Gladstone Springhouse The springhouse collects the water of Gladstone Springs. It contains about seven and a half feet of water. It is a round stone structure, in diameter and standing only about above grade, and is covered by a conical roof. A projecting gable-roof dormer contains the doorway to the building. Southwest of the spring house stands a two-story wood frame structure with a large single-story concrete-block addition, which has seen a variety of uses. The first floor is believed to have originally housed offices, but has been converted to apartments. The upstairs appears to have always been an apartment, probably for the facility manager. The concrete block structure is where bottling and shipping took place.  History  The availability of fresh spring water via Gladstone Springs was significant to the development of Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island, as a resort area in the decades following the Civil War. In 1899, T. G. Hazard, Jr., built the springhouse to enlarge and cover a pit previously used to collect the spring water. In 1911, the property was purchased by Syria W. Mathewson, William R. Sweet, and Frederick C. Olney, who formed the Gladstone Springs Water Company. They built the bottling plant structure and enlarged the facilities, intending to begin the production of bottled sodas as well as spring water.

The pond has a small channel on its north west shore connecting it with Block Island Sound. The opening is artificial and was dug out in 1895 to make a harbor in the south part of the pond. The shores of the pond have a long history of human use, as the area was one of the primary areas of residence by Native Americans both before and after contact with Europeans. Evidence of occupation dates as far back as the Middle Woodland Period, and includes the site of a palisaded fortification.

It was first published in 1971 and was reissued in a special edition by Ewelme School in 2002. Setting Ewelme School The events of the novel take place in the 15th century and primarily in the village of Ewelme in Oxfordshire, England. It is part of a tetralogy, or a four-part story, each of which is self-contained. The story features the village school, built by Alice Chaucer, granddaughter of Geoffrey Chaucer, and the adjoining village church. At the time of setting (1437) the school was newly built, one of the first brick-built buildings in the country. The buildings are still in use as a school, making it the oldest school building still in permanent use in the UK, possibly in the world. Characters *Stephen is a boy whose mother and father are dead and who is sponsored by the local lord once his sister is in a convent. *Meg is an old woman who lives up in the woods. She is kind and good at healing, but seems involved in some kind of witchcraft, claiming she can see the future in a pool of water. *Dame Alice is the wife of the Lord of Suffolk and it is principally she who persuades her husband to take Stephen on, partly in memory of the service his father had offered his Lord. Plot summary Stephen, whose father was bodyguard to his Lord of Suffolk, is under taken into the Lord's household when his stepfather remarries and his sister enters a convent. Stephen is keen to learn and to enter the University at Oxford under the patronage of his Lordship's chaplain, but he becomes embroiled in some mild political intrigue when he believes he has let a copy of an indiscreet letter fall into the hands of his Lordship's enemies. Themes As with most of Cynthia Harnett's books, there is edification galore in this 15th-century story. The thinnest of plots is merely a line on which to hang a wealth of historical detail about the politics and the day-to-day circumstances of the years around 1440. The author's clear purpose, stated several times in the book, is that people ‚Äî and in particular Stephen ‚Äî learn to sift Good from Evil. And she uses the device of possibly witchcraft, dealing with the devil, to force her characters to consider such things. Although sensible points of view are held by those people in the story to whom we look for wisdom, it is the tiniest bit unclear at the end what we are supposed to believe about Meg, the old woman in the woods who seems to see the future in a pool of water.

Technical characteristics Almirante Oquendo was built at Bilbao, Spain. The ship's keel was laid down in January 1889. The vessel was launched in 1891, and completed in 1893.The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Almirante Oquendo She had two funnels and was fast and well armed. Her main armament was mounted on the center line in single barbettes fore and aft. Her armor was poor: her guns had only lightly armored hoods, her guns were mounted in the open on the upper deck, her armor belt was thin and protected only two- thirds of her length, and she had a high, unprotected freeboard that took much damage during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, p. 382 Like other nineteenth-century warships, she was heavily furnished and decorated with wood, which the Spanish failed to remove prior to combat and which would feed fires during the battle. She was named for the victorious commander of the 1633 battle of Perambuko. Operational history S√£o Vicente in the latter half of April 1898. Profile of Almirante Oquendo with its appearance in 1898 Almirante Oquendo was in Havana, Cuba, in the spring of 1898 as tensions rose between the United States and Spain. After the battleship exploded and sank at Havana on 15 February 1898, Almirante Oquendo rendezvoused there with her sister ship, the armored cruiser . Ordered back across the Atlantic as war approached, both ships were assigned to the Spanish Navy's 1st Squadron, which was concentrating at S√£o Vicente in Portugal's Cape Verde Islands under Vice Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete. They arrived at S√£o Vicente on 19 April 1898. It was noted that Almirante Oquendo needed drydocking because of a badly fouled bottom which slowed her to a maximum speed of , her guns had defective breach mechanisms and had been supplied with defective ammunition, and the fleet had a shortage of stokers. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began while Almirante Oquendo was at S√£o Vicente. Ordered by neutral Portugal in accordance with international law to leave S√£o Vicente within 24 hours of the declaration of war, Almirante Oquendo and the rest of Cervera's squadron departed on 29 April 1898, bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico. Cervera's ships reached French-owned Martinique in the Lesser Antilles on 10 May 1898. While Almirante Oquendo and the other large ships loitered in international waters, two Spanish destroyers went into Fort-de- France to ask for coal. France was neutral and would not supply coal, so the Spanish squadron departed on 12 May 1898 for Dutch-owned Cura√ßao, where Cervera expected to meet a collier. Cervera arrived at Willemstad on 14 May, but the Netherlands also was neutral, and strictly enforced its neutrality by allowing only Vizcaya and the armored cruiser to enter port and permitting them to load only 600 tons of coal. On 15 May, Cervera's ships departed, no longer bound for San Juan, which by now was under a U.S. Navy blockade, but for as-yet unblockaded Santiago de Cuba on the southeastern coast of Cuba, arriving there on 19 May 1898. Cervera hoped to refit his ships there before he could be trapped. His squadron was still in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba when an American squadron arrived on 27 May 1898 and began a blockade which would drag on for 37 days. Almirante Oquendo and the other ships endured occasional American naval bombardments of the harbor. Almirante Oquendo still had one 140 mm gun out of commission, 80 percent of the 140 mm ammunition was defective, and nothing could be done under the circumstances about her fouled bottom. Some of her men joined others from the fleet in a Naval Brigade to fight against a U.S. Army overland drive toward Santiago de Cuba. By the beginning of July 1898, that drive threatened to capture Santiago de Cuba, and Cervera decided that his squadron's only hope was to try to escape into the open sea by running the blockade. The decision was made on 1 July 1898, with the break-out set for 3 July 1898. The crew of Almirante Oquendo spent 2 July 1898 returning from Naval Brigade service and preparing for action. Almirante Oquendo was to be the fourth ship in line during the escape, following Cervera's flagship Infanta Maria Teresa, Vizcaya, and the armored cruiser , with the destroyers and bringing up the rear. While Infanta Maria Teresa sacrificed herself by attacking the fastest American ship, the armored cruiser , Almirante Oquendo and the others were to put on all the speed they could and run westward for the open sea. At about 0845 hours on 3 July 1898, the Spanish ships got underway. The U.S. squadron sighted the Spanish ships in the channel at about 0935, and the Battle of Santiago de Cuba began. While Infanta Maria Teresa and Vizacaya charged Brooklyn and the two destroyers turned westward farther inshore, Almirante Oquendo followed Cristobal Colon in a dash to the west. When Brooklyn turned away to the east, Vizcaya and Infanta Maria Teresa also turned west, brushing past the last obstacle in the path of the four Spanish armored cruisers, the armed yacht . Almirante Oquendo now found herself back in the line-ahead formation the squadron had formed when it left its anchorage, in fourth place behind the other three armored cruisers, although now without the following destroyers, which were being chased farther inshore. The U.S. squadron gave chase as the Spanish ships made an all-out break for the west, with the American ships about a mile to port of and slightly astern of the Spanish ships. At 1035, the sinking Infanta Maria Teresa was driven ashore with heavy damage and fires. The wreck of Almirante Oquendo in 1898. The wreck of Almirante Oquendo, circa 1899. As last ship in the Spanish line during a stern chase, Almirante Oquendo naturally drew more than her share of attention from her pursuers. The battleship was only off her port quarter, while the battleships and also were closing from that direction, and Brooklyn was on her port bow. Concentrated fire from the three battleships punished Almirante Oquendo. Iowa scored 43 six-pounder hits which killed or wounded most of the sailors on the Spanish cruiser's upper decks, where her 5.5-inch guns were mounted without protection, and one of her own 5.5-inch shells exploded prematurely in the gun's breach, killing the gun's crew. Almirante Oquendo drew admiration from her opponents by lashing back with a high volume of shell- and machine-gun fire. But she took three 8-inch (203 mm), one 6-inch (152 mm), one 5-inch (127 mm), and nine 4-inch (102 mm) hits, and soon a fire started in her after torpedo room that could not be brought under control and threatened to spark an ammunition explosion that would have wrecked the ship. Her mortally wounded captain ordered her to be scuttled, and she turned out of the line and ran for shore, beaching about offshore, a few hundred yards (meters) to the west of Infanta Maria Teresa and about west of Santiago de Cuba, at around 1030 hours. Some of her sailors made it ashore, although they had to beware of Cuban insurgents, who began to shoot the survivors of the wrecked Spanish ships. Others were rescued by American sailors who brought small boats alongside the wrecks to take off survivors. Almirante Oquendo lost 80 dead in the engagement. Postwar, a U.S. Navy survey team evaluating Spanish wrecks for their potential for being raised and put in American service concluded that Almirante Oquendo was beyond salvage.

A 2004 report by Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn was very critical of the Texas foster care system. A follow-up statement with continued criticisms of the Texas foster care system was made in 2006 by the Comptroller and renewed a request to have the governor create a Family and Protective Services Crisis Management Team. The Comptroller stated that in fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively 30, 38 and 48 foster children died in the state's care. The number of foster children in the state's care increased 24 percent to 32,474 in Fiscal 2005, while the number of deaths increased 60 percent. Compared to the general population, a child is four times more likely to die in the Texas foster care system. In 2004, about 100 children were treated for poisoning from medications; 63 were treated for rape that occurred while under state care including four-year-old twin boys, and 142 children gave birth. A 12-year-old boy died in December 2005, suffocated while being restrained from behind by an employee of the facility. Another died May 30, after drowning in a creek during a bicycle outing. A three-year- old was treated for poisoning from an atypical, mind-altering anti-psychotic drug. The Comptroller's office also found significant financial problems in a 2005 audit of DFPS. =YFZ Ranch FLDS raid= Gene Grounds of Victim Relief Ministries reported no hysteria or crying children from children removed from the ranch. He commended CPS workers as exhibiting compassion, professionalism and caring concern. John Kight, chairman of an organization that provided mental health workers to assist FLDS children and mothers from the YFZ Ranch recounted to the Texas governor's office that DFPS' Child Protective Services had seemed out of control at the temporary shelters, describing \\"how abusive CPS was and how they've trampled all over their rights.\\" One of the workers who assisted at the shelter remarked that \\"wonderful loving women and children are being treated like convicts in a concentration camp by the state of Texas\\". Some quotes found in two of the original affidavits linked to from this article titled: \\"This incident... is not what America or Texas stands for.\\" and \\"Even the simplest request was discounted.\\" Another wrote \\"I have never seen women and children treated this poorly, not to mention their civil rights being disregarded in this manner\\" after assisting at the emergency shelter. \\"The CPS workers were openly rude to the mothers and children, yelled at them for tryin to wave to friends.. threatened them with arrest if they did not stop waving\\" Workers took notes on everything the \\"guests\\" said. Some compared it to a prison or concentration camp. By contrast, one worker noted the children were \\"amazingly clean, happy, healthy, energetic, well behaved and self-confident,\\" while the mothers were \\"consistently calm, patient and loving with their children.\\" Ultimately, both the Court of Appeals for the Third District and the Texas Supreme Court found that CPS improperly removed all the children and ordered them returned to their parents. Caregivers who were previously forbidden to discuss conditions working with CPS later produced unsigned written reports expressed anger at the CPS traumatizing the children, and for disregarding rights of mothers who appeared to be parents of healthy, well-behaved children. CPS threatened some workers with arrest, and the entire mental health support was dismissed the second week due to being \\"too compassionate.\\" Workers believed poor sanitary conditions at the shelter allowed respiratory infections and chicken pox to spread. After being removed from the temporary shelters the FLDS children were placed in 16 group shelters and foster homes. Minors with children were sent to the Seton Home in San Antonio, older boys to Cal Farley's Boys Ranch in Amarillo. Some parents stated on the Today Show that they were unable to visit their boys due to a shortage of CPS staff. Newspapers released names of facilities caring for the FLDS children that have requested donations of specific items, help or cash. By Julia Lyon, Brooke Adams and Nate Carlisle =2011 lawsuit= The DFPS has also been the subject of a recent lawsuit alleging, among other complaints, that foster children are inappropriately placed in restrictive institutional settings. In 2011, Children's Rights, a New York-based national advocacy group working to reform child welfare systems, filed a federal class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas alleging the DFPS routinely fails to either return children who've been in foster care at least a year safely to their families or to find them safe, appropriate, and permanent new families.PLAINTIFFS‚Äô ORIGINAL COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF AND REQUEST FOR CLASS ACTION, M.D. v. Perry (S.D. Tex. 2011) They also claim that after approximately one year, or a maximum of 18 months, without successfully reunifying children with their birth families or finding them adoptive homes, children become permanent wards of the state, a status known as \\"permanent managing conservatorship\\" (PMC), and that after entering this permanent foster care status, many children have little hope for stable, permanent families and instead are shuffled between a variety of foster and institutional placements that are poorly supervised by the state.

Just over 34,800 people took part in the 68th edition of the march in 2014. The march is one of several events attended by veterans, living relatives, soldiers and British army cadets plus RAF and air cadets from the United Kingdom together with Dutch military, police and civilians to commemorate the 1,750 British and Polish soldiers and airmen who lost their lives at the Battle of Arnhem during the Second World War and who are buried at the Airborne Cemetery at Oosterbeek. The march is also meant to remind one and all, especially the post-war generations, of the sacrifices man was ready to make for the restoration of democracy. In 1947 the Police Sports Association 'Renkum' Organised the 'Airbornewalk' for the first time, to honour those who fought for our freedom enduring the September days in 1944, in and around Oosterbeek and Arnhem. Over 2,000 participated in this first march, so it was a success from the beginning. Later the event was named 'Airborne March', with the permission of Major-General Roy Urquhart, CB, DSO, commander of the 1st Airborne Division, whereby the Pegasus emblem could be used by the organization. From the beginning the net revenues of the Airborne March are used to enable veterans and next of kin with poor means, to come over to The Netherlands and attend the annual Airborne-commemorations in and around Arnhem. As of 2011 other charities are supported, provided that they are in accordance with the ideology of the Airborne March and comply with the policy's rules and regulations. The Airborne March has 4 distances: 10, 15, 25 and 40 km. The longest distance is for individuals only. The routes lead you through the woods of the Veluwezoom and the municipality of Renkum and the great views over the river Rhine. Over 17 nationalities participate in this march every year; individuals as well as groups. The groups normally choose the longer distances. It is organised every year at the sports park Hartenstein in Oosterbeek, just beyond the Airborne Museum, the former Hartenstein Hotel, which was used as Divisional H.Q. by Major General Roy Urquhart CB, DSO at the time of the battle. The routes lead past the most important wartime locations in the Oosterbeek area: *the former Hartenstein Hotel, which was the Divisional H.Q. at the time of the battle and is now the Airborne Museum *the Airborne Cemetery, where over 1,700 British and Polish soldiers are buried *the dropzones on the Ginkel Heath near Ede *the vast woods of the \\"Bilderberg\\" where troops fought a hard battle *the drop and landing zones of Wolfheze, Renkum, Heelsum and Ginkel Heath near Ede. *the Old Church where troops gathered during the retreat At least 10,000 British Army, Air Force and Navy Cadets have attended in the last 25 years and have experienced battlefield tours and many other educational events during their stay.

It is part of an experimental research project developed by the University of Washington, Center for Game Science, in collaboration with the UW Department of Biochemistry. The objective of Foldit is to fold the structures of selected proteins as perfectly as possible, using tools provided in the game. The highest scoring solutions are analyzed by researchers, who determine whether or not there is a native structural configuration (native state) that can be applied to relevant proteins in the real world. Scientists can then use these solutions to target and eradicate diseases and create biological innovations. A 2010 paper in the science journal Nature credited Foldit's 57,000 players with providing useful results that matched or outperformed algorithmically computed solutions.  History  = Rosetta = Prof. David Baker, a protein research scientist at the University of Washington, founded the Foldit project. Seth Cooper was the lead game designer. Before starting the project, Baker and his laboratory coworkers relied on another research project named Rosetta to predict the native structures of various proteins using special computer protein structure prediction algorithms. Rosetta was eventually extended to use the power of distributed computing: The Rosetta@home program was made available for public download, and displayed its protein-folding progress as a screensaver. Its results were sent to a central server for verification.Howard Hughes Medical Institute \\"Protein-folding game taps power of worldwide audience to solve difficult puzzles\\" Eurekalert!, August 4, 2010 Some Rosetta@home users became frustrated when they saw ways to solve protein structures, but could not interact with the program. Hoping that humans could improve the computers' attempts to solve protein structures, Baker approached David Salesin and Zoran Popoviƒá, computer science professors at the same university, to help conceptualize and build an interactive program, a video game, that would appeal to the public and help efforts to find native protein structures. = Foldit = Many of the same people who created Rosetta@home worked on Foldit. The public beta version was released in May 2008Hickey, Hannah. \\"Computer game's high score could earn the Nobel Prize in medicine\\" University of Washington, May 8, 2008 and has 240,000 registered players. Since 2008, Foldit has participated in Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments, submitting its best solutions to targets based on unknown protein structures. CASP is an international program to assess methods of protein structure prediction and identify those that are most productive.  Goals  Protein structure prediction is important in several fields of science, including bioinformatics, molecular biology, and medicine. Identifying natural proteins' structural configurations enables scientists to understand them better. This can lead to creating novel proteins by design, advances in treating disease, and solutions for other real-world problems such as invasive species, waste, and pollution. The process by which living beings create the primary structure of proteins, protein biosynthesis, is reasonably well understood, as is the means by which proteins are encoded as DNA. However, determining how a given protein's primary structure becomes a functioning three-dimensional structure, how the molecule folds, is more difficult. The general process is understood, but predicting a protein's eventual, functioning structure is computationally demanding.  Methods  Similarly to Rosetta@home, Foldit is a means to discover native protein structures faster through distributed computing. However, Foldit has a greater emphasis on community collaboration through its forums, where users can collaborate on certain folds. Furthermore, Foldit's crowdsourced approach places a greater emphasis on the user. Foldit's virtual interaction and gamification create a unique and innovative environment with the potential to greatly advance protein folding research. = Virtual interaction = Foldit attempts to apply the human brain's three-dimensional pattern matching and spatial reasoning abilities to help solve the problem of protein structure prediction. 2016 puzzles are based on well-understood proteins. By analysing how humans intuitively approach these puzzles, researchers hope to improve the algorithms used by protein-folding software. Foldit includes a series of tutorials where users manipulate simple protein- like structures and a periodically updated set of puzzles based on real proteins. It shows a graphical representation of each protein which users can manipulate using a set of tools. = Gamification = Foldit's developers wanted to attract as many people as possible to the cause of protein folding. So, rather than only building a useful science tool, they used gamification (the inclusion of gaming elements) to make Foldit appealing and engaging to the general public. As a protein structure is modified, a score is calculated based on how well-folded the protein is, and a list of high scores for each puzzle is maintained. Foldit users may create and join groups, and members of groups can share puzzle solutions. Groups have been found to be useful in training new players. A separate list of group high scores is maintained.  Accomplishments  Results from Foldit have been included in a number of scientific publications. Foldit players have been cited collectively as \\"Foldit players\\" or \\"Players, F.\\" in some cases. Individual players have also been listed as authors on at least one paper, and on four related Protein Data Bank depositions. *An August 2010 paper in the journal Nature credited Foldit's 57,000 players with providing useful results that matched or outperformed algorithmically computed solutions, stating \\"[p]layers working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies\\". *A November 2011 article in PNAS compared \\"recipes\\" developed by Foldit players to Rosetta scripts developed by members of the Baker Lab at the University of Washington. The player-developed \\"Blue Fuse\\" recipe compared favorably with the scientists' \\"Fast Relax\\" algorithm. *In 2011, Foldit players helped decipher the crystal structure of a retroviral protease from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV), a monkey virus which causes HIV/AIDS-like symptoms, a scientific problem that had been unsolved for 15 years. While the puzzle was available for three weeks, players produced a 3D model of the enzyme in only ten days that is accurate enough for molecular replacement. *In January 2012, Scientific American reported that Foldit gamers achieved the first crowdsourced redesign of a protein, an enzyme that catalysed the Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions widely used in synthetic chemistry. A team including David Baker in the Center for Game Science at University of Washington in Seattle computationally designed the enzyme from scratch but found its potency needed improvement. Foldit players reengineered the enzyme by adding 13 amino acids, increasing its activity by more than 18 times. *A September 2016 article in Nature Communications detailed a \\"crystallographic model-building competition between trained crystallographers, undergraduate students, Foldit players and automatic model- building algorithms\\" in which \\"a team of Foldit players achieved the most accurate structure\\" fitting a protein to the results of an X-ray crystallography experiment. *A July 2018 article in Nature Communications reviewed the collaboration between Foldit players and teams in the WeFold consortium in biennial CASP competitions CASP11 and CASP12. *A June 2019 letter in Nature described the analysis of proteins designed by Foldit players. Four player-designed proteins were successfully grown in E. coli and then \\"solved\\" via X-ray crystallography. The proteins were added to the Protein Data Bank as 6MRR, 6MRS, 6MSP, and 6NUK. *In November 2019, an article in PLOS Biology reported how Foldit players were able to \\"build protein structures into crystallographic, high-resolution maps more accurately than expert crystallographers or automated model-building algorithms\\" using data from cryo EM experiments.  Future development  Foldit's toolbox is mainly for the design of protein molecules. The game's creator announced the plan to add, by 2013, the chemical building blocks of organic subcomponents to enable players to design small molecules.

Hope Village is located on a bend in the North Pawtuxet River in the southeastern corner of Scituate. Industrial activity has occurred in Hope Village since the mid-eighteenth century. Surviving industrial and residential buildings in the Historic District date back to the early 19th century. The village center sits at junction of Main Street (Rhode Island Route 115) and North Road (Rhode Island Route 116). Hope Village radiates out from the center with houses on several smaller side streets in a compact configuration. Currently there is little commercial or industrial activity in Hope Village and none in the Historic District. The present stone mill building on the south side of Hope Village was built in 1844 by Brown & Ives of Providence, expanded in 1871 and modified in 1910. Approximately one quarter of the village's current housing stock was built as mill worker housing by various owners of Hope Mill. Hope Furnace An iron furnace called the Hope Furnace was constructed in 1766, shortly after the discovery of iron ore nearby in 1765. The factory produced household goods and pig iron, and received a contract to produce cannon for the Rhode Island General Assembly to manufacture cannon for use in the American Revolutionary War. The factory eventually produced 270 cannon. Hope Furnace stopped production around 1801, and the property was sold to Silvanus Hopkins in 1806. Hope Mill In 1806, the Hope Cotton Factory Company built a textile mill building along the Pawtuxet River, southeast of the site of the Hope Furnace in a settlement that later came to be called Hope Village. The mill was constructed out of wood. Between 1806 and 1844 the mill buildings passed through several hands. In 1844, the mill buildings burned down and the buildings were replaced by a large, four-story gabled roof stone building with a belfry tower on its west face and roof dormers by the Providence firm of Brown and Ives, which had purchased the mill property in 1844. Around 1900, a 40,000 square foot one story brick mill building was added to the south of the stone mill buildings. The gabled roof of the stone mill building was replaced by a flat roof and a fifth floor was added to the original stone mill. The Hope Mill buildings were used to weave textile until 2007. The last textile manufacturing occupant of the mill was Just-A-Stretch, a weaver of elastic fabrics. Between 2016 and 2019 the roofs and walls of the brick building and roofs of several stone mill buildings collapsed. The Hope mill property has been in receivership since 2008 (except for the period of January to August 2010) and has been badly neglected since 2010. Hope Village After the 1844 mill purchase by Brown and Ives, several houses were built in the periphery of the mill property to house executives of the Hope Mill. In 1874, a church was built next to the mill. A library was established in the basement of the church. Thirteen double-tenement houses were also built for employees on Mill Street north of the mill on land originally owned by the Hope Furnace. By the early 1880s Hope Village had established itself as a bustling village at the terminus of the Pawtuxet Valley Railroad. The Pawtuxet Valley Railroad began operation in Hope Village in 1874. Several shops opened in Hope Village. The rail line in Hope was removed in the 1950s. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 8, 1995.

Best known for her songs in Breton, with her musicians or in a duet with guitarist So√Øg Sib√©ril, she released four albums, regularly performs in concerts, and also keeps acting in plays and films.  Biography  Nolwenn Korbell spent her childhood in Douarnenez with her younger brother and her parents, gwerz singer Andrea Ar Gouil and Herv√© Corbel, also a Breton music amateur. All four of them spoke Breton in their daily life, and Nolwenn learnt French at school. She followed her mother during her tours in the Celtic nations, where she heard Welsh, Irish and Scottish people sing in their respective languages. She began taking theatre classes in her teens. At 16, she played in sketches during the ', a pastiche of the C√©sar Awards ceremony. Youenn Gwernig, the head of Breton language programs of France 3 Ouest, noticed her. In 1984, France 3 bought the rights of a Welsh cartoon in order to dub it in Breton, and Gwernig gave her the female character's role. During two years, she studied modern languages at University of Rennes 2, learning German, Breton and Welsh. She spent three years in the Dramatic Arts Conservatory in Rennes, learning lyrical singing, and performing as a soprano in the band Arsis Th√©√¢tre Vocal. She hosted television programs on France 3 Ouest. Between 1991 and 1999, she lived between Brittany and Wales, the home land of her partner, Twm Morys. She sang in his band, '. At that time, she played in short and long films by Olivier Bourbeillon, Simon Hymphries. In 1997, she competed in the Kan ar Bobl, a Breton singing contest that brought to fame, among others, Yann-Fa√±ch Kemener and Denez Prigent. There, she sang ' (My seamstress), a song she wrote as a tribute to her grandmother, and won the first prize. In 2000, after the birth of her son Gwion, she went back to France in order to devote herself to theatre and singing. In 2002, she sang during the '. The two heads of Coop Breizh were in the audience and offer her to record an album.  Music  Nolwenn Korbell and So√Øg Sib√©ril = ' = ' (It is not over), her first album, was released in the end of 2003. This title was chosen so that anyone can find their own meaning in it: it can, for example, refer to the end of a love relationship that leaves some hope, to the Breton language and culture that are still alive, or to a work of art, like the album itself, that is never over because it is always possible to give a new interpretation of it. All the songs are in Breton, except ' (\\"The new world\\"), which is in Welsh. All the lyrics were by Nolwenn Korbell, except those of ' (\\"The girl of the closed bed\\", by Bernez Tangi), ' (Twm Morys) and ' (\\"Come with me\\", traditional). Korbell cited as her main source of inspiration the songs, often from the Barzaz Breiz, that her mother sang to her. She wrote using simple words, following the example of Bernez Tangi, who, in addition to a song, wrote the poem that serves as a preface to '. Because of her training as an actress, she took great care of pronouncing correctly, which is part of her effort in making her songs understandable by the largest audience. She expressed one of her strongest convictions: the importance of Breton, and of languages in general: \\"I would like the world to keep all the colours that are under the sun\\", she said in an interview. She included in the album \\"\\", a traditional song that her mother taught her, also sung by the Goadec sisters. Another traditional theme is the subject of \\"\\" (Song of the girl who had nothing), inspired from a nursery rhyme designed to teach children the days of the week, the name of farm animals and the sound they make: everyday, the narrator goes to the fair and buys an animal. In Nolwenn Korbell's version, starting on Wednesday, the narrator buys something that cannot be bought: a husband, a son, a heart, a voice and a life. According to the author, \\"this song is a parable which demonstrates that what makes the salt of life is not negotiable\\". The band that performed on ' included Fr√©d√©rique Lory on the piano, Tangi Le Dor√© on the bass, and d'Antonin Volson on drums. This team remained with her until 2010. This album received France 3's Priz (award) of the best CD in 2003 and the ' (made in Brittany) disc grand award in 2004. In 2004, Nolwenn Korbell received the Imram award, given each year to a Breton language author for his or her whole work. Her shows were produced by Big Bravo Spectacle, a company based in Saint-Quay-Portrieux.Booklet of ' She sang in many events, such as the Vieilles Charrues Festival in 2004, the Festival du bout du monde, the Nuit celtique in Bercy in 2005 and 2006.

The district is centered on the junction of Rhode Island Route 3 with Woodville Road, Clark Falls Road, Townhouse Road, and Old Rockville Road. It is a relatively modest town center, with twenty residences, two church buildings (one of which is no longer used as a church), the town hall, and post office. The most imposing house in the district is the Thurston-Wells House, a c. 1800 structure which was given a Victorian treatment in the mid-19th century; it stands opposite the 1836 Greek Revival First Baptist Church. The area was a major stop on the stagecoach route (now Route 3), and was eclipsed in the 20th century by the construction of Interstate 95, which passes nearby.

It was developed and published by Mindscape in 1992 for the Mega Drive/Genesis and in 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was originally developed under the title The Road Warrior, based on the film of the same name; however, Mindscape lost the rights to the license when the game was almost complete, so the title was changed to Outlander to avoid legal issues. Gameplay In Outlander, the player drives along a post-apocalyptic road in either first-person view (Genesis) or third-person (Super NES). Bikers and trucks attack the player's car with gunfire or ramming. To fend them off, a car window is displayed allowing the player to fire a shotgun to the left or right. The car is also armed with a forward-firing machine-gun. Enemy vehicles destroyed in this way result in an explosion that may damage the player's car. The car's fuel is consumed over time, and the player may either stop to refill, or run out of fuel. In either case, on-foot gameplay ensues. In this section, the player must avoid chain or petrol-bomb wielding bikers, landmines, and armed hillbillies. There is also opportunity to collect health, fuel, and ammunition before returning to the car. The player may also stop at towns, another on-foot section that allows resource gathering. Items include ammunition, food, water, fuel, surface-to-air missiles, armour, windshields, fuzzy toys, tires, and geiger counters. The geiger counter is used to detect contaminated food.

As part of the prize, his debut album 10 Letters was recorded with Sony Music Australia featuring the single Day After Day. The following year, Jones returned to the 2005 Musicoz Awards to perform Day After Day and co-present an award with Yumi Stynes. In 2007, Jones composed and arranged the music for Centrelink The Musical which made its debut at the 2008 Adelaide Fringe Festival. According to the show's creator, Jones \\"was keen to just work on something fun\\" after complications with a record deal. The musical was generally well-received, with a score that was \\"beautifully timed and refreshingly snappy\\". Later that year, Jones relocated to New York City and began to work on some new music at The Cutting Room Studios. As a result, the pop-heavy single Lip Sync was released in September 2008. Speaking with The Sydney Morning Herald about the independent release, he said: ‚ÄúAt this stage in my career, especially after receiving some limiting contracts from labels, I actually can't think of anything more freeing.‚Äù =2009‚Äì2013= In 2010, Jones arranged and produced a remake of the song That's What Friends Are For featuring David Raleigh, Billy Porter, Ari Gold and Alan Cumming.

His thesis gave the first empirical demonstration that lyrics have an effect on felt emotion above and beyond the actual sound of the music.

Crocker, the warden of the jail. He presents with the petition the record of his conviction and sentence in the Supreme Court of the District to imprisonment for five years under an indictment for embezzlement, and this record and the petition of the applicant present all that could be brought before the court on a return to the writ, if one were awarded.. Background The petitioner relies on a single point from the facts which occurred at the trial. Pending before the court, there were fourteen indictments against the petitioner for embezzlement as an officer of the Bank of the Republic; and an order of the court had directed that they be consolidated under the statute and tried together. A jury was then impaneled and sworn, and the district attorney had made a statement of his case to the jury, when the court took a recess. When the court reconvened a short time later, it decided that the indictments could not be tried together and so directed the jury to be discharged from further consideration of them, and rescinded the order of consolidation. The prisoner was thereupon tried before the same jury on one of those indictments and found guilty. All of this was against his protest and without his consent. The judgment was taken by appeal to the supreme court in general term, where it was affirmed. It was argued that the impaneling and swearing the jury and the statement of his case by the district attorney put the prisoner in jeopardy with regard to all the offenses charged in the consolidated indictments, within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, so that he could not be again tried for any of those offenses. That amendment declares, among other things, that no person It is said, that the court below exceeded its jurisdiction, and that this Court has the power, in such case and for that reason, to discharge the prisoner from confinement under a void sentence. The proposition itself is sound if the facts justify the conclusion that the court of the district was without authority in the matter. But that court had jurisdiction of the offense described in the indictment on which the prisoner was tried. It had jurisdiction of the prisoner, who was properly brought before the court. It had jurisdiction to hear the charge and the evidence against the prisoner. It had jurisdiction to hear and to decide upon the defenses offered by him. The matter now presented was one of those defenses. Whether it was a sufficient defense was a matter of law on which that court must pass so far as it was purely a question of law, and on which the jury under the instructions of the court must pass if we can suppose any of the facts were such as required submission to the jury. Article V of the Amendments, and Articles VI and VII, contain other provisions concerning trials in the courts of the United States designed as safeguards to the rights of parties. Do all of these go to the jurisdiction of the courts? And are all judgments void where they have been disregarded in the progress of the trial? Is a judgment of conviction void when a deposition has been read against a person on trial for crime because he was not confronted with the witness, or because the indictment did not inform him with sufficient clearness of the nature and cause of the accusation? Decision The high court confessed that it is not always very easy to determine what matters go to the jurisdiction of court so as to make its action when erroneous a nullity. But the general rule is that when the court has jurisdiction by law of the offense charged, and of the party who is so charged, its judgments are not nullities. There are exceptions to this rule, but when they are relied on as foundations for relief in another proceeding, they could be clearly found to exist. In this case, no verdict nor judgment was rendered, no sentence enforced, and it remained with the trial court to decide whether the acts on which he relied were a defense to any trial at all. The court was of the opinion that what was done by that court was within its jurisdiction. That the question thus raised by the prisoner was one which it was competent to decide, which it was bound to decide, and that its decision was the exercise of jurisdiction. Ex Parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 202; Ex Parte Parks, 93 U. S. 23; Ex Parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 653; Ex Parte Crouch, 112 U. S. 178. Without giving an opinion as to whether that decision was sound or not, the court decided it could not grant the writ being asked for, and it was denied.

The property is all that remains of an original parcel purchased by Simon Lillibridge in the 1810s. The main house, a two-story wood frame structure, was either built by Lillibridge, or was already on the property when he bought it. Architectural analysis of the house suggests that at least portions of it were built in the 18th century, with hand-hewn (instead of later sawn) beams, and other stylistic elements suggesting construction during the Georgian period. The farm complex includes other 19th- century buildings, including a barn, shed, wagon shed, and outhouse, as well as a family cemetery. The property was in regular agricultural use until about 1935, and was used thereafter as a summer residence. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

History The association was founded in 1928 and the name means 'Macedonian'. At the time of its formation the club's original name was Prosfygiki Enosis (Refugees Union - the founders were Greek refugees who came from Turkey after the 1922 war disaster) but they were forced to change it in 1936 after the Metaxas government suggestion. The name of the team inspired many regional teams and as a result there are more than twenty Macedonian teams who also use it (Olympiacos and PAOK are also common names for Greek football clubs). The club's best moments were in the 1940s when the team was struggling for the Greek Championship (1947) but didn't make it and in the 1980s when Makedonikos took part in the Super League (1st Division Championship) (1982‚Äì83) and was relegated after a play-out match against Panionios (3-2 final score). Makedonikos still stands out as the only Greek team who managed not to be beaten by Olympiacos (0-0 in Efkarpia and 1-1 in Karaiskakis Stadium). They also managed not to lose a game in Efkarpia against PAOK (0-0), Aris (1-0), Iraklis (0-0), AEK (1-0), Panathinaikos (3-0), the most famous clubs of the Greek League. They also made it to the 1980 Greek Cup semi-final where they were eliminated by Kastoria F.C., who finally won the Cup. Makedonikos F.C. was also one of the strongest clubs in the 2nd Division throughout the 1980s, the late-1970s and in the early-1990s. In 2008, they managed to ascend to the soccer league, after fourteen years of absence in the national leagues, with Marcelo Zuleta as technical director. As for 2016, the club won the EPSM Cup by winning 2-1 in the final at Toumba Stadium and were also champions of the EPSM A1 Division having lost only twice. In the play-off match against Apollon Paralimnio (which was crucial for both teams for their promotion), chairman Pavlos Andronis withdraw the team due to bad arbitration, and so the team lost the chance to promote. However, during the 2016-17 season, Makedonikos finished on top of the league and promoted to the Third National Division (Gamma Ethniki) having won the play-off match against Olympiacos Kimina (3-1). Many great Greek football players joined Makedonikos F.C. over the years. Giorgos Karamihalos, Fanis Tountziaris, Nikos Sakellaridis made their name wearing the green shirt of Makedonikos while other famous footballers played in Efkarpia sometime in their career. Giannis Damanakis, Giannis Gounaris, Christos Giannakoulas, Kostas Iliadis, Theodoros Apostolidis, Thomas Beltsos, Grigoris Fanaras, Panagiotis Kermanidis, Kostas Drambis, Kostas Tsironis, Giorgos Koulakiotis, Takis Nikoloudis, Christos Terzanidis, Michalis Iordanidis are some of them.

A pass differs from a shot, in that a pass is typically weaker than a shot and is not directed at the opponent's net with the intention of scoring a goal. The function of passing in ice hockey during gameplay strongly resembles the role of passing in other goal sports such as soccer and lacrosse. Passing (along with skating, shooting, and stick handling) is one of the most fundamental skills in hockey. An effective pass is described as being \\"stick to stick\\" or \\"tape to tape\\", referring to the tape on the blade of a hockey stick. Effective passing requires good vision, anticipation, and timing, as well as execution. A player that is an effective passer will normally record many assists, which are awarded to the second and third to last player to touch the puck before a goal. The National Hockey League record for most career assists is 1,963 by Wayne Gretzky, who is considered one of the best passers of all time. Different types of passes are employed in different situations or using different techniques: ; Backhand pass : using the back side of the blade of the stick. ; Centering pass : to the put the puck into the centre of the ice (the \\"slot\\"). This is the most dangerous pass in hockey both because it provides the best opportunity to score and because if the intended receiver misses it, there is a strong likelihood that the puck will come to an opponent with few obstacles to the net. ; Clear-out or clearing pass: a pass out of a team's defensive zone. Its primary purpose is defensive, to prevent the opposition from getting the puck for the opportunity to score. ; Cross-ice pass : a pass that traverses the width of the ice surface (e.g. from the left winger to the right winger). ; Drop pass : when a player passes the puck directly behind him to a teammate. If executed properly, the puck stops moving and the pass's receiver catches up to it. ; Hand pass : a pass made with the hand. It is legal when both passer and recipient are inside the defending zone, otherwise illegal. An illegal hand pass results in a stoppage of play and a faceoff at the position where the puck was passed from. ; Headmaning the puck : (a.k.a. a stretch pass, an outlet pass, or a long bomb) a long pass that allows one's team to move out of their defensive zone and start a rush. An especially long and well executed one that results in a breakaway is then called a breakaway pass. ; No-look pass : made while not looking at the receiver. ; Offside pass : a pass to a player who is offside. This can mean a two-line pass(no longer current in the NHL since 2005), a pass that crosses two lines marked on the ice for such purposes. Depending on the era and league, the centre red line may or may not count as such a line. Or, it can refer to a pass to a player who has entered the offensive zone before the puck. This type of pass is always offside no matter how many lines it crosses. ; Saucer pass : an airborne pass from one player to another. It is called a saucer pass because the puck resembles a flying saucer in mid-air. ; Slap pass : a hard shot aimed at a teammate's stick. It is a shot that is intentionally aimed away from the net to an open teammate's stick. ; Suicide pass : a pass that forces the receiver to look down or away from the play in order to find the puck, leaving him vulnerable to a powerful body check. ; Tic-tac-toe : a play that involves two quick passes and a shot and results in a goal.

He is said to have arrived in the Languedoc in 681 and, at some point, adopted or inherited his uncle's titles, duke of Raz√®s and count of Rhedae. He is also said to have adopted the surname, or nickname, of ‚ÄúPlant-Ard‚Äù (subsequently Plantard) from the French appellation ‚Äòrejeton ardent‚Äô ‚Äòardently flowering shoot‚Äô of the Merovingian vine. Under this name, and under the titles acquired from his uncle, he is said to have perpetuated his lineage. Journalists and scholars who have debunked the Priory of Sion hoax argue that Pierre Plantard created the Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau and the fictitious biography of Sigebert IV to support his false claim that he was a descendant of the extinct Merovingian dynasty through this figure.Jean-Luc Chaumeil, The Priory of Sion - Shedding Light on the Treasure and Legacy of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau and the Priory of Sion (Avalonia, 2010). In 1990, Plantard revised himself by claiming he was only descended from a cadet branch of the line of Dagobert II, while arguing that the direct descendant was really Otto von Habsburg, who, according to Plantard, was descended from Sigebert I (the son of Bera II and the grandson of Wamba), who married Magdala, the granddaughter of Dagobert II.Jean-Luc Chaumeil, Le tr√©sor du Triangle d'Or, page 163 (Nice: Alain Lefeuvre, 1979).

It is located on the Common Tunnel of the Oslo Metro and on the Briskeby Line of the Oslo Tramway. Also located at the same place is Nationaltheatret Station of the Drammen Line. The station is served by all six lines of the metro, and lines 13 and 19 of the tramway. In addition, several bus services call at the station. It is named for the National Theatre located nearby. The tram stop in the area opened in 1894. Nationaltheatret was the first underground station in the Nordic Countries; construction of a tunnel from Majorstuen to the city center started in 1912, but was not finished until 1928. Until the 1987 opening of Stortinget, Nationaltheatret was the city terminus for the four western light rail lines: the Holmenkollen Line, the R√∏a Line, the Sognsvann Line (from 1934) and the Kjels√•s Line (from 1942). The mainline railway station opened in 1980, and in 1993, the light rail station was upgraded to allow metro trains to run through it. Facilities Nationaltheatret is Norway's only underground mainline railway station, located within the Oslo Tunnel on the Drammen Line. At ground level, there are three entrances to the station: on the west side of the station, the main entrance is from beneath 7. juni-plassen and Victoria Terrasse, facing Rusel√∏kkveien; there is an entrance from Johanne Dybwads plass, which is the site of the National Theatre. From the east, there is an entrance from Henrik Ibsens gate. There is a large, open vestibule near the surface at the entrance to Rusel√∏kkveien. It has high-mounted windows facing south, giving natural lighting. The area features escalators and elevators to the platforms, manned ticket sale, lockers, kiosks and caf√©s. The station is also equipped with ticket machines and features baggage trolleys, washrooms, automated teller machines and a Western Union bank. Parking is available away at Vika, where car rental is also provided. Bicycle parking and taxi stands are located at street level. Service All five lines of the Oslo Metro, numbered 1 through 5, run through Nationaltheatret. Each service has a 15-minute headway, which is reduced to every 30 minutes in the late evening and early on Sundays. Thus the station is served by up to 24 trains per hour per direction. Lines 13 and 19 of the Oslo Tramway run along the line, with line 13 serving the Sk√∏yen Line, the Lilleaker Line and the Ekeberg Line, and line 19 serving the Briskeby Line and the Ekeberg Line. It is served by Ruter bus lines, 30 Nydalen-Bygd√∏y, 31 (Grorud T)-Tonsenhagen‚ÄîFornebu-(Snar√∏ya), 32 Kv√¶rnerbyen-Voksen skog, 33 Ellingsrud√•sen T-Filipstad, and more. The railway station located below the metro station serves trains operating west of Oslo Central Station. All eight lines of the Oslo Commuter Rail stop at Nationaltheatret. However, not all services of all line operate west of Oslo S. The Airport Express Train operates direct, high-speed services to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen every 20 minutes, with the journey taking 28 minutes. The Norwegian State Railways' (NSB) intercity services along the S√∏rland Line and Bergen Line call at Nationaltheatret, as does NSB's regional service along the Vestfold Line. Eastwards, these continue past Oslo S and serve the southern part of the Dovre Line until Lillehammer. The tram stop at ground level, with SL95 (left) and SL79 (right) trams Ã¨ History Tram at Nationaltheatret in 1928 The tramway past Nationaltheatret was opened on 2 March 1894, when Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei opened the Briskeby ine from Oslo East Station via Briskeby to Majorstuen. In 1898, the Holmenkollen Line was opened, a light rail running from Majorstuen to Holmenkollen. The terminus at Majorstuen was a major hassle for passengers; most people were bound for the city center, and these had to change to the street trams at Majorstuen. For Holmenkolbanen, there were two ways to solve the issue. Either sign trafficking rights with Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei to use their tracks on the Briskeby Line to reach the city center. Alternatively, a tunnel could be built to an underground station in the city center. Applications for a tunnel were sent to the municipality in 1901. However, disagreements as to whether the tunnel was to be considered a railway or tramway halted progress. The city considered the line a tramway while the company considered the tunnel a railway. A new application was sent in 1907. It was proposed as a single track line which would run to the intersection of Karl Johans gate and Fredriks gate, and estimated to cost 1.5 million Norwegian krone (NOK). The plans were opposed by some in the city, who stated that the line would take passengers from the street trams, and stimulate migration to the areas along the Holmenkollen Line in Aker, and thus reduce the tax income for the city. In 1909, the municipal council stated that they were opposed to the tunnel. On 9 June 1911, the city council voted that they would accept the tunnel if the terminus was moved to the intersection of Karl Johans gate and Rusel√∏kkveien, but this was rejected by the company. Aker Municipal Council voted on 27 May 1909 that they were in favor of the tunnel, and on 9 June 1911 the proposal was passed by the Parliament of Norway. Both municipalities wanted the redemption right, but this given to the state. Holmenkolbanen received a concession for 60 years from the date of opening. Entrance to Nationaltheatret in 1935 Construction started in 1912 in the central part of the tunnel. At the time, an agreement had not been reach with the municipality about the location of the terminus. By October 1914, the tunnel works had been completed from Rosenborggaten to the statue of Karl Johan in Slottsparken. The issue of the terminus was still not completed, and work was therefore halted. Holmenkolbanen were planning on building the line through the city center, and therefore wanted the terminus at Fredriks gate, while the municipality wanted it at Rusel√∏kkveien. In 1915, a competition for a plan for the city's tramway light rails was launched, although it took two years for the invitation to be issued. In July 1918, the winner was announced, and in September 1919 a committee made a suggestion for how to expand the light rail network. It proposed connecting the Lilleaker Line to Majorstuen, a tunnel through the city center from Majorstuen to Stortorvet and Vaterland, and onwards as an elevated line eastwards, along routes that closely resemble the current metro lines and the Ekeberg Line. From Stortorvet, there was proposed a northern branch which would be built northwards towards Kjels√•s. In addition, a route close to the current Ring Line was proposed. Following a competition for the design of a new light rail network in the city, which was concluded in 1919, the municipality to again consider the terminus of the tunnel. The executive committee supported terminating the tunnel at Eidsvolls plass, but this was rejected by the city council on 13 July 1920. Holmenkolbanen convinced the municipality to establish a committee to look into the specific issue. In September 1921, the committee proposed creating a temporary terminus, following Holmenkolbanen's route, in the square behind the National Theatre. This was under the condition that experts concluded that construction would be done without damage to surrounding buildings. The proposal was passed by the city council on 13 October 1921. In June 1922, an expert committee concluded that construction would be satisfactory. In June 1923, the executive committee voted to allow a temporary terminus at Nationaltheatret, while Holmenkolbanen were obliged to continue the line onwards to Studenterlunden. The company did not accept the new terms, and the city council could finally pass a proposal the company would accept on 3 April 1924. However, by then traffic had increased on the Holmenkollen Line, and the R√∏a Line had been connected to Majorstuen, while the Sognsvann Line was under planning. This made Holmenkolbanen change the tunnel to double track. To finance the construction, the company borrowed NOK 11.5 million. Concession was granted on 15 January 1926, which demanded that the tunnel open by the end of 1928. Past Slottsparken the original track had been built with increased depth to allow a potential extension of the Drammen Line of the Norwegian State Railways to run above the light rail tunnel. By 1926, these plans had been discarded, and the second track was not made as deep. The station officially opened on 27 June 1928 by King Haakon VII. It became the first underground railway in the Nordic Countries, five years before Stockholm and six years before Copenhagen. The tunnel was long and trams used three to four minutes to run the length. The station would be used by two companies: Holmenkolbanen and Akersbanerne. Holmenkolbanen operated both the R√∏a Line and the Holmenkollen Line, but from the Sognsvann Line was connected to the tunnel from 10 October 1934, a financing solution needed to be made. People waiting at Nationaltheatret in 1928 In 1931, Aker Municipality purchasing the majority of Holmenkolbanen, and merging the R√∏a Line and Sognsvann Line into the company. In 1939, B√¶rumsbanen started the construction of a branch from the Lilleaker Line to Majorstuen. From 15 June 1942, the Kols√•s Line, as it was renamed, started running via the tunnel to Nationaltheatret. B√¶rumsbanen became part of Oslo Sporveier in 1971. By the 1930s, Oslo had two main railway stations, Oslo East Station and Oslo West Station. Serving as the terminal station of the Drammen Line, Oslo West Station (Oslo V) was located in Vika. The much larger Oslo East Station (Oslo √ò) served most commuter, regional and intercity trains. In 1938, the Station Committee of 1938 was established to look into a possible connection of the Drammen Line to Oslo √ò. Led by Axel Grenholm, the committee recommended building a branch from the Drammen Line as a tunnel under the city center, allowing all trains would terminate at Oslo √ò. The proposal was presented to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel, Oslo Central Station and Nationaltheatret was passed unanimously. Entrance to the eastbound platform During the 1960s, the Oslo Tunnel was being planned to connect the Drammen Line to Oslo East Station. This would make Oslo West Station unnecessary, and would allow a central station to be built at the location of the East Station. The tunnel was planned to run in a similar route as would be necessary to connect Jernbanetorget to Nationaltheatret, and a railway station was planned to connect to Nationaltheatret. Simultaneously, Oslo Sporveier worked with possibilities to connect their eastern and western networks, and get both into the city core. During the 1960s, the planning office for the metro proposed to build a connecting tunnel between Nationaltheatret and Jernbanetorget. However, the initial plans involved creating a station close to Nationaltheatret, named for Slottsparken, which would serve as the transfer point between the two systems. This station had a planned dimension to hold 25,000 people. At the time, the western and eastern networks were incompatible; in addition to different platform heights, the eastern network used six-car trains with a third-rail power supply, while the western network used overhead wires and two-car trains. The initial plans were met with criticism, following media's discovery that the main planners had not consulted several hired specialists, and that alternatives to the preferred route had not been made. As a consequence, several engineers working for the Norwegian State Railways made two alternative suggestion for the route. By 1975, the plans were changed so Nationaltheatret would become the transfer station, by building a balloon loop for the eastern trains, while the western trains would terminate as before. This solution would allow the two networks to be connected later. Entrance The decision to build Sentrum, located west of Jernbanetorget, was taken by the city council on 22 May 1969; the decision also involved that the transfer station be placed at Slottsparken/Nationaltheatret. Construction started in 1972, and the first leaks were revealed. By the time the station opened on 9 January 1977, the leaks had not been removed. In 1978, the city planner discarded the proposal from Oslo Sporveier to build a new station at Slottsparken, and instead decided that Stortinget would become the interchange between the two systems. This would allow the western network to later be upgraded to metro standard and allow through trains. The proposal was supported by all political parties except the Labour Party. The railway station and the Oslo Tunnel was taken into use on 1 June. On 20 February 1983, Sentrum was closed to finally remove all leaks. The station reopened on 7 March 1987, with the new name Stortinget. The Common Tunnel was completed, and the trains from the western network terminated where at the old platforms, where the eastern trains had previously terminated. The eastern trains instead operated through a balloon loop. On 27 May 1989, Oslo V was closed and all traffic started running via Nationaltheatret. Airport Express Train at the railway station On 7 October 1987, the city decided to connect the four light rails west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line was selected as the first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line, including the Common Tunnel and Nationaltheatret, were upgraded to metro standard by replacing the overhead wire with a third-rail power supply and installing automatic train protection. The platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting six-car trains, and the platform height increased. From 4 April, the line started operating through the Common Tunnel and connected to the Lambertseter Line. From 1998, the Airport Express Train would start operating, and more capacity would be needed, both at Nationaltheatret and through the Oslo Tunnel. In 1995, NSB held an architecture competition to expand the station complex, which was won by LPO Arkitektur og Design and their design \\"Next To Nothing\\". Most of the work involved the railway station, which received four platforms, escalators and art. However, it also involved a larger vestibule and easier access between the two stations. The upgrades cost NOK 920 million and was officially opened by King Harald V on 16 December 1999.

Additionally, the house is listed as built in 1712 by Stephen Northup Jr. who is actually most likely the second owner resident on this property. Stephen Northup (Northup Jr.'s father) came to America in 1650 building a home on this land in 1660. Due to the destruction during King Phillips War, there is speculation about whether the original Northup home survived the local Native American attacks which burned many settlers properties to the ground. However, extensive renovation and property study indicates the southwestern portion of the home is original to the 1660 building standards with additions made around 1712 and 1850. The present home may have portions of its current form rooted in the year 1660. History  The original house on the site may have been built in 1660 with an addition around 1712 most likely completed by Stephen Northup Jr. The original building may have burned during King Philip's War, which destroyed most of the houses in the state in the 1670s.http://my02818.com/articles/2009/07/31/people/doc4a7105008f0a4138729342.txt Later owners made additions to the structure. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The house is owned by the Bogue family. They have added two sizable additions to the house and have restored all of the interior. Stephen Northup family  In 1645 Stephen Northup emigrated from Great Britain to New England. He became the Town Sergeant of Providence in 1660, and took an Oath of Allegiance on 19 May 1671 in Kingstowne. Stephen Northup Jr. was born 1660, the first son of Stephen Northup Sr. Stephen Northup Sr. lived at North Kingston but conflicting records have him living in Providence at the same time.http://www.northupfamily.com/Genealogy/stephen.html He was granted a plot of land (25 acres) on October 2, 1655 by the \\"Towne Meeting of Providence, R.I.\\" At another \\"Towne Meeting\\" on Aug 27, 1656, he was granted commonage equal to any other townsman, the right to vote, the right of being a \\"freeman\\" and proprietor in the town of Providence. On February 8, 1662 Northup Sr. sold a plot of land (possibly that same 25 acres) in the Providence region and moved to Kingstowne. What is known is the Northup family started with the seniors marriage to Sarah Elizabeth Harrington in about 1654, and gave birth to their first child (Stephen Jr.) in 1660 with records indicating birth in the town of Kingstowne (North Kingstown) and Providence. Stephen Sr. officially moved to Kingstowne in 1662 but clearly had an established residence in place since his second son, Benjamin, was born that same year in the town of North Kingstown (according to town records). The likely scenario of events to help to accurately date this home is to project that Stephen Sr. acquired the North Kingstown property at, or around, the year of 1660 with the intention of moving his new family there. However, his official record of North Kingstown residency is not until 1662. With these facts at hand, one can surmise that during this two-year period, Northup prepared his North Kingstown property for construction of his home completing it early 1662. This places the actual beginning construction of the Stephen Northup House within the time period of 1660, or 1661.

The trail is promoted and maintained in part by the 'Friends of the Riverfront'. Their stated mission is to increase awareness and engagement with the region's rivers and riverfronts through activities and stewardship, and to extend the water and land trails on the major rivers within Allegheny County. At the Pittsburgh Point State Park, there are three rivers: the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which unite to form the Ohio River. The Three Rivers Heritage Trail extends three miles (5 km) up the north side of the Allegheny River to Millvale, and also three miles (5 km) down the north bank of the Ohio River to Brunot Island. On the Monongahela River, the trail goes five miles (8 km) upriver from Station Square to a point just short of the Waterfront Shopping District. Within the city, the trail takes the names of neighborhoods through which it passes. The north bank of the Allegheny River is Pittsburgh's North Side also known as Northside, and the trail is referred to locally as the 'North Shore Trail'. On the north bank of the Ohio River, the trail is called the 'Chateau Trail' after the neighborhood along which it runs. On the south bank of the Allegheny, it goes through the food market area and is called the 'Strip District Trail'.Strip District On Monongahela River's north bank, it is called the 'Eliza Furnace Trail' because it passes the site where the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company once had its Eliza Furnaces. Some people call this section the 'Jail Trail' because it also passes the Allegheny County Jail on its way to Oakland, the university center of the city. A branch that extends into Schenley Park in Oakland is called the 'Junction Hollow Trail'. As it moves further up the Monongahela River towards Frick Park, it is called the 'Duck Hollow Trail', because that is where a stream exits the park into the Monongahela. On the south bank of the Monongahela in Pittsburgh's South Side, it is called the 'South Side Trail'. The trail hosts public art and has 61 interpretive signs along the trail, highlighting the region's heritage and riverfront ecology. Pittsburgh is one terminus of the long 'Great Allegheny Passage' (GAP)GAP that connects the city to Cumberland, Maryland and Washington, D.C. The route of the GAP uses five miles (8 km) of the 'Three Rivers Heritage Trail'. Within the city, the GAP goes from the Waterfront Mall and Sandcastle upstream on the Monongahela River, and then at the SouthSide Works crosses the river on the Hot Metal Bridge. Finally, it uses the north bank of the Monongahela to reach the Pittsburgh Point. The 'Friends of the Riverfront' have also developed and administer the 'Three Rivers Water Trail',http://www.friendsoftheriverfront.org/new_pages/watertrail.htm ] along the riverfronts of Allegheny County, for kayakers and canoeists, with access points, parking areas, and boat racks. For many years, the trail hosted the annual 'Pittsburgh Triathlon',http://www.pittsburghtriathlon.com a competition for top athletes who use the land and water routes to bike, run, and swim for this Olympic qualifier. A less demanding version is the 'Adventure Race', for friends, families, and teams who wish to paddle, bike, and run a shorter yet challenging course.

J. Schleiden (1804‚Äì1881). The Mesozoic Marine Revolution (MMR) is the rapid adaption to shell-crushing (durophagous) and boring predation in benthic organisms throughout the Mesozoic era (251 Mya to 66 Mya). The term was first coined by Geerat J. Vermeij, who based his work on that of Steven M. Stanley. While initially restricted to the Late Cretaceous (145 Mya to 66 Mya), more recent studies have suggested that the beginning of this ecological arms race extends back into the Norian (Late Triassic) It is the important transition between the Palaeozoic evolutionary fauna and the Cenozoic evolutionary fauna that occurred throughout the Mesozoic. The Mesozoic Marine Revolution was not the first bout of increased predation pressure; this also occurred around the end of the Ordovician. There appears to be some evidence of adaption to durophagy during the Palaeozoic, particularly in crinoids. Causes Skull of the Middle Triassic placodont Placodus gigas, showing their massive flat teeth specialized for crushing the shells of their prey The Mesozoic Marine Revolution was driven by the evolution of shell-crushing behaviour among Mesozoic marine predators, the technique being perfected in the Late Cretaceous. This forced shelled marine invertebrates to develop defences against this mode of predation or be wiped out. The consequences of this can be seen in many invertebrates today. Such predators are thought to include: Triassic placodonts, Triassic ichthyosaurs, Triassic Omphalosaurus, Triassic plesiosaurs, Jurassic pliosaurs, Late Cretaceous mosasaurs and Cretaceous ptychodontoid sharks. It is also thought that the break-up of Pangaea throughout the Mesozoic brought together previously isolated communities, forcing them to adapt. The increased shelf space caused by sea- level rise and a hyper-greenhouse climate provided more iterations and chances to evolve, resulting in increasing diversity. Another proposal is the evolution of hermit crabs. These exploit the shells of dead gastropods, effectively doubling the life-span of the shell. This allows durophagous predators nearly twice the prey, making it a viable niche to exploit. Effects The net result of the Mesozoic Marine Revolution was a change from the sedentary epifaunal mode of life of the Palaeozoic Evolutionary Fauna to the infaunal/planktonic mode of life of the Modern Evolutionary Fauna. Non- mobile types that failed to re-attach to their substrate (such as brachiopods) when removed were picked off as easy prey, whereas those that could hide from predation or be mobile enough to escape had an evolutionary advantage. Three major trends can be associated with this: 1) Reduction in suspension feeding epifauna 2) Increasing abundance of infauna 3) An intermediate stage of mobile epifauna. Major casualties of the Mesozoic Marine Revolution include: sessile crinoids, gastropods, brachiopods and epifaunal bivalves. Affected taxa comatulid crinoids, like this Antedon mediterranea specimen, only have vestigial stalks and can actively move around to avoid predation =Gastropods= Benthic gastropods were heavily preyed upon throughout the MMR, the weaker shelled types being pushed out of the benthic zone into more isolated habitats. The Palaeozoic archaeogastropods were subsequently replaced by neritaceans, mesogastropods and neogastropods. The former typically have symmetrical, umbilicate shells that are mechanically weaker than the latter. These lack an umbilicus and also developed the ability to modify the interior of their shells, allowing them to develop sculptures on their exterior to act as defence against predators. Another development among Muricidae was the ability to bore through shells and consume prey. These marks (while relatively rare) generally occur on sessile invertebrates, implying that they put pressure on Palaeozoic-type faunas during the MMR =Crinoids= The MMR heavily affected the crinoids, making the majority of forms extinct. Their sessile nature made them easy prey for durophagous predators since the Triassic. Survivors (such as the comatulids) could swim or crawl, behaved nocturnally or had autotomy (the ability to shed limbs in defence). The shift in the range of sessile stalked crinoids during the late Mesozoic from the shallow shelf to habitats further offshore suggests that they were forced by increased predation pressure in shallow water to migrate to a deep water refuge environment where predation pressure is lower and their mode of life more viable. =Brachiopods= Brachiopods, the dominant benthic organism of the Palaeozoic, suffered badly during the MMR. Their sessile foot- attached nature made them easy prey to durophagous predators. The fact that they could not re-attach to a substrate if an attack failed meant their chances of survival were slim. Unlike bivalves, brachiopods never adapted to an infaunal habit (excluding lingulids) and so remained vulnerable throughout the MMR. =Bivalves= Bivalves adapted more readily than the Brachiopods to this transition. The majority of bivalves adopted an infaunal habit, using their siphons to gather nutrients from the sediment-water interface while remaining safe. Others like Pecten developed the ability to jump a short distance away from predators by contracting their valves. Like brachiopods, epifaunal varieties of bivalves were preyed upon heavily. Among epifaunal types (such as mussels and oysters), the ability to fuse to the substrate made them more difficult to consume for smaller predators. Epifaunal bivalves were preyed on heavily pre-Norian but extinction rates diminish after this. =Echinoids= Echinoids do not suffer major predation (save for general infaunalisation) during the MMR but it is clear from bromalites (fossilised ‚Äòvomit‚Äô) that cidaroids were consumed by predators. Echinoids radiate into predatory niches and are thought to have perfected coral grazing in the Late Cretaceous. Cidaroids also are thought to have contributed to the downfall of the crinoids.

The EP was the band's third release to develop their innovative production and sample-based approach. After initially recording sessions for the EP with their original producer Charlie McIntosh, the band's label Rough Trade Records were unsatisfied with the sessions and instead the band worked with a new producer, Michael Johnson, famous for his work with New Order. His production ethic included a period of pre-production, the first time the band had used this process. The EP consists of four tracks and is considered by music journalists to be a highly eclectic release. It was released by Rough Trade Records in November 1993 in the UK alone, with the title track released as a white label single. The EP cover was the band's first of many of the band's artworks designed by Fuel with photography from David Spero. The EP was mostly overlooked upon its release but has subsequently been praised, alongside the rest of the band's output in this era, to be highly innovative. The EP was taken out of print shortly after release but was remastered and re-released as part of the compilation The 5 EPs in November 2011.  Background  Disco Inferno formed in 1989 in Essex by teenagers Ian Crause (guitars and vocals), Paul Willmott (bass), Daniel Gish (keyboards) and Rob Whatley (drums), although Gish soon quit the band to join Bark Psychosis, leaving Disco Inferno to become a trio. Although the band was initially a post-punk band heavily influenced by bands such as Joy Division and Wire, Crause soon became infatuated with the unique sounds of bands My Bloody Valentine and the Young Gods, as well as the Bomb Squad's revolutionary production and sampling on the music of Public Enemy, and with the release of the Summer's Last Sound EP, released later on in 1992 by, the band's musical style changed towards sample-based electronic sounds. The band \\"hit upon a seemingly simple but ultimately world-opening idea\\" with the EP: to write their instruments through samplers, and unlike their contemporaries who sampled elements of music, film dialogue or other media, Disco Inferno \\"engaged with the whole world\\", using their set up to record sounds ranging from running water, the wind, whistling birds, boots, car crashes and angry voices. Although it was not a commercial success, the uncompromising, innovative and experimental sound of Summer's Last Sound was praised, leading the group to expand the approach with their next release, the EP A Rock to Cling To (1992), their first release on Rough Trade Records after their previous label Cheree closed. According to Andy Kellman of Allmusic, the new label \\"saved the band's life, as the members believed that they were too challenging for anyone else to understand or care for.\\" The band became characterized as one of the first post-rock bands. Rather than release another full-length album, they decided to release another EP in the sample-based approach, beginning work on The Last Dance in 1993.  Recording  The band initially recorded sessions for The Last Dance with Charlie McIntosh, but these session were rejected by the band's label Rough Trade, so for the first time in the band's career, they worked with a different producer‚ÄìMichael Johnson, most famous for his engineering work with New Order, with the further assistance of engineer John Rivers. Nonetheless, MacIntosh is still credited as a producer and engineer in the EP's liner notes. Paul Wilmott recalled that he initially felt that working with Johnson \\"was a betrayal to Charlie\\", whilst Ian Crause commented that \\"it did feel strange,\\" adding that he thought McIntosh \\"was a bit hurt, but our manager rallied us, and we did it. It was definitely the right thing to have done.\\" Johnson's approach was different than McIntosh's for numerous reasons; most unusually for the band, Johnson arranged a period of pre-production for them, something they had not done before. The band and Johnson booked into a rehearsal room in Walthamstow, East London, and spent a couple of days working on the title track, largely putting together a drum track with Johnson's drum machine. Wilmott recalled that he \\"thought Crause embraced it more than [Wilmott] did purely for the New Order connection,\\" with him commenting that: \\"I was a little unsure as it seemed to go against what we were working towards. But once we got in to the studio, it became more exciting.\\" In 2011, Crause recalled: that, \\"along with Second Language, The Last Dance was probably the most painless time in the studio. We were in a semi-rural location in the Midlands. Rob and I even managed to go out for a long countryside drive one evening, which would have been out of the question in [London] unless we wanted to see a wild kebab wrapper in its natural habitat.\\" In retrospect, Johnson commented that he always found working with bands inspired by Joy Division and New Order to be a positive thing, saying \\"it meant they were open to my ideas and weren't suspicious or too wary about my methods and suggestions. The bands always had plenty of originality, so they were trying to do their own thing, too.\\" Crause said that \\"When Michael suggested something, we just did it. I probably flinched when he said Rob should play a normal drum kit again but I wouldn't have said anything. The pre-stated aim was to let him take us away from our rehearsal- room sound into a pop sound. It's probably safe to say that we entered Planet Normal during these sessions and did what everyone else was doing.\\"  Music  The Last Dance was the band's first EP to contain four songs instead of two, although as with the band's other EPs, it is sometimes considered a single. According to Ned Raggett of Pitchfork Media, \\"The Last Dance was in many ways a profound change from the group's previous releases\\" and ranges \\"from the serene sonic calm\\" of \\"Scattered Showers\\" to the \\"extreme frenzy\\" of \\"D.I. Go Pop.\\" Writing for Allmusic, he said that The Last Dance was \\"a teaser for the astonishing D. I. Go Pop album (as with all the threesome's other singles, it contained nothing from an actual album)\\" which \\"captured the band perfecting the low-key, crisp sound that characterized their more accessible numbers and their total, uncompromising extremism.\\" According to Jonny Mugwamp of Fact Mag, \\"The Last Dance features two similar versions of the title song that find the band working in unexpectedly melodic and relatively sample-free New Order-ish territory ‚Äì sonically, at least\\" which are \\"offset by two other songs.\\" He considered the EP to be an \\"overload.\\" Dan Cooper-Gavin of Drowned in Sound called the EP the band's most \\"difficult\\" so far, saying \\"The Last Dance is significant, then, as the concept of radio-friendliness enters the band‚Äôs consciousness.\\" = \\"The Last Dance\\" = Unlike other songs by the band in this era, the title track contains few samples, the most prominent being a ticking clock. The EP opens with the title track. Music journalist Tom Ewing called it \\"the least formally groundbreaking of DI‚Äôs records,\\" but noted that \\"the moment [he] heard it I was floored by its originality and sense of purpose.\\" Unlike the band's other songs in the era, the amount of samples in the song is kept to a minimum, with the only apparent samples being a constant ticking of clocks and a crowd chanting in the distance. Nonetheless, Ewing stated that \\"The Last Dance\\" is also the band's \\"wisest, most moving song, a meditation on history, on the impossibility of making something new in art and on the need to try and do so anyhow. It‚Äôs also their most musically endearing, a tune as taut and poignant as anything Wire ever recorded, with delicate guitar lines meshing and weaving, always pretty but always understated.\\" Although Crause's singing \\"was barely singing at all,\\" \\"he made it a virtue, his slightly breathless voice sounding urgent, desperate to communicate, but at the same time faltering.\\" On \\"The Last Dance\\", he sighs \\"Was there ever a time / Like this?\\", just before the guitars \\"skid all over the track,\\" and according to Ewing, \\"it's as inspiring as it is heartbreaking.\\" Raggett noted that had another band recorded the song, the result \\"would have been a pleasant post-punk slice of energy, something which could have been recorded by New Order, Echo and the Bunnymen, or perhaps even the Field Mice. Here, though, limits are pushed just enough. Crause's voice sounds just alien enough with subtle distortion -- the samples he triggers with his guitar -- rather than the lovely, echoed chiming itself -- help carry the song. Wilmot's bass and Whatley's drums are very much to the fore, disturbing the expected mix as a result.\\" Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine called the song \\"straight-ahead post-punk pop music but re-imagined and reconstructed with added detail taken from the world outside.\\" = \\"D. I. Go Pop\\" = My Bloody Valetine (pictured). \\"D. I. Go Pop\\" was \\"essentially put together like a garage band\\" and consists of a second-long sample of the My Bloody Valentine song \\"You Made Me Realise\\", taken from the band's 1988 EP of the same name, pitched across Crause's guitar \\"with the unpredictable fret release firing off samples at a much higher pitch by chance,\\" giving it an even more chaotic feel. Raggett described the song, saying \\"after a pleasant radio announcer sample, an incredibly messed-up loop of sound -- the band is in it somewhere, but not as much as all the other strange noises and notes crammed into the music -- serves as the bed for a perversely simple but completely uneasy listening melody. Crause delivers his lyrics with a slight urgency, but no more, over the bedlam.\\" In 2011, Mugwamp of Fact Mag said the song is \\"like a hyper- compressed, furious and deadly serious Butthole Surfers circa Locust Abortion Technician\\" which \\"still prompts one of my fondest memories of what were truly horrible times in my life, when a bewildered house mate stormed into my room yelling \\"Why the fuck are you listening to three songs at once!\\".\\" Crause recalled that \\"That sample does make you jump, doesn't it? I sometimes dreaded starting it off, especially when it was coming through a full PA. It's like waiting for a firework to go off-- you know the bang's coming, it's just the waiting for it that does your nerves in. I can't remember the exact lyrics, but we were starting to laugh between ourselves about our lack of success and I was also beginning to increasingly think of us as a cartoon band to reflect our total hopelessness, which I got from Paul, who was the chief giggler. So you pretend it wasn't that important all along, even though it's killing you. Cartoon purgatory would be where this obviously made-up tale put us: a world of black irony.\\" The song shares its name with the band's second album D. I. Go Pop, also recorded in 1993 but released afterwards in 1994. Mugwamp stated the song \\"revealed exactly what was to be waiting\\" on the album. Andrew Unterberger of Stylus Magazine said the sound of the song \\"is something like a Buzzcocks single whose RPM can‚Äôt seem to remain steady, constantly spinning faster and slowing down again. The stuttering guitar riff is absolutely mesmerizing, sounding like the group is struggling to get it out as quickly as possible. How the song manages to unearth some really gorgeous hooks out of the mess is just unbelievable.\\" Jon Dale of Dusted Magazine, interpreting the song's lyrical content, said: = \\"The Long Dance\\" = \\"The Long Dance\\" is an extended remix of the title track remixed by Johnson. The idea for the song came about because the band had extra studio time booked, and Johnson \\"wanted to play around\\" with the title track in a similar style to how he approached the remixes he had previously produced for New Order. The band were against the idea of remixing themselves prior to the sessions, but found that \\"working backwards to get \\"The Last Dance\\" didn't feel like [they] were remixing anything.\\" In 2011, Ian Crause recalled that he was not initially a fan of the remix, but that his opinion had become more positive over time, saying \\"I thought it was a bit tacky. I was never a massive fan of even the New Order 12\\" remixes. The other guys wouldn't have had any qualms about it as they were both well into dance music. Now, I think it's a pretty good track and Michael did a great job.\\" Unterberger considers this version to have \\"a better intro\\" than the original and \\"an extra two minutes of blissful instrumental interplay.\\" = \\"Scattered Shadows\\" = \\"Scattered Showers\\" closes the EP and was the band's first ever track that was put together with Wilmott doing the majority of the sampling featured on an Akai S3200. Wilmott himself considers the song a \\"missed opportunity\\", which him commenting in 2011 that \\"it creates an interesting atmosphere but doesn't really do anything. The guitar makes it sound too ethereal. There are songs that we could have been braver with, such as this. If we had treated this in the same way as \\"Lost In Fog\\", whereby there is no true root of traditional instrumentation, the result could have been realized to a greater level.\\" Crause also has reservations about the song, saying it \\"was driven by a sense of absence. It was all stuff about conformity and a black storm coming to instill fear into those who were complacent. It's vague and hazy, adolescent. There's possibly something beautiful in it, but it is too long.\\" Nonetheless, music journalist Ned Raggett commented positively that it \\"rides a soft, lovely combination of acoustic guitar, piano, and samples, growing thicker and more involved with time, all treated with the combination of intimacy and distance the band excels in.\\" Douglas Walk of Trouser Press said the song is \\"nearly consumed in an avalanche of sound effects.\\"  Release  The EP was the band's second release on Rough Trade Records and was released on 18 November 1993 in the UK alone on CD and LP. A white label twelve-inch single of \\"The Last Dance\\" and \\"The Long Dance\\" was also distributed by the label to promote the EP. The Last Dance, along with the band's other EPs, was not a commercial success, was soon taken out of print following its release. According to Matthew Olmos of The 405, for many years afterwards, \\"most modern fans have been passing around increasingly shitty mp3s sourced from a single bootleg CD-R rip of the original vinyl releases [of the EPs].\\" Music critic Ned Raggett used to personally burn people copies of a compilation CD of the EPs for people requesting them, effectively creating a bootleg. Niany Hong of PopMatters said that \\"it's unknown how many people were influenced by this bootleg record.\\" However, a remastered compilation of the band's five sample-based EPs, including The Last Dance, was released as the critically acclaimed The 5 EPs released as a CD, 2xLP and digital download on 14 November 2011, marking the first time the songs from the EP had been in print in some twenty years. After hiring Andrew Swainson to design the cover at for the all of the band's previous release, Disco Inferno hired design agency Fuel to design the artwork and packaging for The Last Dance, which features a logo for the band resembling a radar superimposed over a seascape. Fuel were originally contacted by the band's manager Mike Collins, who had seen their work through a piece about them in The Sunday Times, and thought their aesthetic matched that of the band. Fuel desired to design a bold logo for the band to give the band a strong identity from the start, with the original symbol dating back to the 1930s and having a \\"simultaneous clarity and ambiguity that complimented their sound.\\" The seascape was photographed by photographer David Spero, whose landscape photographs were described as \\"quite unusual for a record sleeve at the time; they were beautiful images of nothingness.\\" Fuel subsequently designed the band's following album and EP covers, with the covers of the two direct following releases, the D. I. Go Pop album and Second Language EPs, also featuring photography from Spreo and following the same template as the cover for The Last Dance.  Critical reception and legacy  = 1990s and 2000s = At the time of the release, the EP was mostly overlooked by the music press just as it was not a commercial success. Ned Raggett of Allmusic reviewed the EP later on in the 1990s, rating it four stars out of five, saying it \\"captured the band perfecting the low-key, crisp sound that characterized their more accessible numbers and their total, uncompromising extremism\\", and after praising the title track, \\"The Long Dance\\" and \\"Scattered Showers,\\" noted that \\"the jaw-dropper is \\"D. I. Go Pop\\" itself.\\" However, in a 2014 article for Pitchfork Media, Raggett said that the \\"centrepiece is the title song itself, showcasing the band both at its most tensely propulsive and, thanks to a powerful lyric on the oppressive weight of political and cultural history, its most cutting and observational.\\" Following its release, the EP came to be regarded, alongside the band's other sample- based EPs, as a highly innovative release, with Andy Kellman of Allmusic calling the EPs \\"remarkable\\", Jon Dale of Dust Magazine calling them \\"breathaking collections\\", and Ned Raggett calling them \\"brilliant.\\" Writing for Freaky Trigger in 1999, music journalist Tom Ewing placed \\"The Last Dance\\" at number 2 on his list of the \\"Top 100 Singles of the 90s,\\" saying although it is \\"the least formally groundbreaking of DI‚Äôs records,\\" it is \\"also their wisest, most moving song, a meditation on history, on the impossibility of making something new in art and on the need to try and do so anyhow. It‚Äôs also their most musically endearing, a tune as taut and poignant as anything Wire ever recorded, with delicate guitar lines meshing and weaving, always pretty but always understated. [..] On \\"The Last Dance\\", [Crause] sighs ‚ÄúWas there ever a time / Like this?‚Äù, just before the guitars skid all over the track, and it's as inspiring as it is heartbreaking.\\" He further commented: In a 2005 article for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterbeger considered \\"The Last Dance\\" and \\"D. I. Go Pop\\" to be the band's greatest songs. He described \\"The Last Dance\\" as \\"truly one of the great singles of the mid-90s\\" with its \\"gorgeous jangling guitars, driving percussion and the most heartbreaking lyrics Crause ever penned.\\" Meanwhile, writing in 2005 about \\"D. I. Go Pop\\", he said that \\"Is it sad, that 11 years after its release, this is still the first song I think of when I think of music that sounds ahead of its time? But that‚Äôs just how fucking mind-blowing this song is.\\" Also writing for Stylus Magazine in 2005, Nick Southall revealed that the EP was a possible choice for inclusion his list of the \\"Top Ten EPs\\" of all time, but instead he included the band's subsequent EP Second Language (1994) into the list because The Last Dance \\"has thus far evaded my greedy little eBay-scouring mitts.\\" = 2010s = \\"D. I. Go Pop\\" has been praised by the likes of Dean Spunt of No Age. After the EP was included on The 5 EPs in 2011, many more critics took notice to the EP. Dan Cooper-Gavin of Drowned in Sound called The Last Dance \\"significant\\", \\"the lead track being the best single that New Order never released. And yet, this being Disco Inferno, things are never quite that straightforward. Not only is \\"The Long Dance\\", the track's alternate take, actually much punchier (and, indeed, New Order-ier) than \\"The Last Dance\\", but then sandwiched between the two is \\"D. I. Go Pop\\", which, if the title is to be taken at face value, must mark history's single most misguided attempt at cracking the mainstream. Crause spits out his lyrics amidst a woozy cacophony akin to a Walkman warping and unspooling, to create a truly exhilarating rollercoaster ride. Bruno Brookes wouldn't have known what hit him.\\" Jon Dale of Dusted Magazine regarded the title track to be \\"Disco Inferno at their most wide-eyed and populist, like New Order taking a crash course in Marx.\\" Songs on the album have been cited by musicians as influences. Dean Spunt of the American noise rock duo No Age said in 2011 that \\"D.I. Go Pop\\" is a song he \\"can listen to 50 times in a row and not get sick of. There is so much to decipher and read into. An amazing piece of music.\\" Double Denim Records owner and Pitchfork Media writer Hari Ashurt said \\"D.I. Go Pop\\" has \\"that effect where on first listen it races ahead of you before you can arrange it into something that makes sense,\\" noting \\"I had the same feeling listening to Loveless for the first time-- listening to it loudly almost triggers motion sickness.\\" Contact Music described \\"D. I. Go Pop\\" as being \\"made like mutated strains of C86 that, instead of bursting out into a controlled mushroom cloud, reached critical mass and became black-holes, devouring anything nearby.\\"  Track listing  All tracks were written by Ian Crause, Paul Wilmott, and Rob Whatley # \\"The Last Dance\\" ‚Äì 4:11 # \\"D.I.

Career Barry trained as a dancer in a John Tiller troupe. In August 1923, when she was 12, her mother brought her to Australia, where she was known as Phyllis du Barry.All the Australian events are documented in contemporary newspapers published in digital form by the National Library of Australia By September, she was the lead dancer in a cabaret troupe at the Wentworth Cafe, until May 1925, when she made her first film, Painted Daughters. Engagements followed with the Frances Scully Pony Ballet and as a dancer at the Ambassadors' Club. In July 1926, she joined the Fuller Brothers, touring with Chefalo and Palmer, the Moon and Morris Revue Company and the Zig Zag Revue Company. Her second film, Sunrise, was made in 1926.

After the battle, graves of fallen Confederate soldiers were placed around the area. During the battle, James Madison Griffin had seen his house used as a hospital. In 1872 he decided to donate some land for the use of a Confederate cemetery. Various troops were reinterred here, and the monument was placed as the focus point of this small cemetery. In 1872, a public subscription sought funds to build a memorial in memory of the Confederate soldiers located there. The original monument, which cost $500, was a simple granite obelisk with inscription and a small base. On June 3, 1911, over 4,000 people from the surrounding counties gathered for Confederate Decoration Day at the monument, with the keynote speakers being ex-Union officers. The monument eventually fell into disrepair. It would be restored in the 1930s, with the enclosure gone and the obelisk placed on a wide concrete base.

History John Baker's Mill was built in 1829. The mill was known as Feaver's Mill in the 1860s. In 1890, the mill tower was raised by and completely refitted by J W Holloway, the Shoreham millwright. It was worked by wind until the early 1920s and by engine until 1963. The sails and fantail were removed in August 1958. On 16 January 2008, Arun District Council gave Listed Building Consent for the windmill to be converted to a dwelling, despite strong opposition from the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. In January 2014 the Windmill was purchased by Bolrush Developments Ltd who specialize in listed building development. Description John Baker's Mill is a four storey flint and stone tower mill with a stage at first floor level. When built, it had two Ccmmon sails and two spring sails. These were replaced with four patent sails carried on a cast iron windshaft, in 1890. The mill is fitted with Holloway's screw brake. The cap is a beehive shape, winded by a fantail. The mill originally drove two pairs of millstones, and Holloway's added a third pair. Currently, the stocks for the sails are on the mill, but the sails have not been erected yet.

The farm consists of of rolling fields and woodlands on the west side of the road. The main farm complex includes a wood- frame house, barn (since adapted for residential use), a caretaker's residence, and a number of other outbuildings, accessed via a winding private lane. The main house, a two-story gambrel-roofed structure, is of uncertain construction date, and is generally dated to either 1785 or 1815. It has been extensively altered, and been the subject of well-meaning but historically problematic restorations in the first half of the 20th century. The property's significance lies in its association with members of the Perry family, specifically Oliver Hazard Perry, the United States Navy commodore responsible for the American victory in the 1813 Battle of Lake Erie, and Admiral Matthew C. Perry, who was responsible for the Opening of Japan in 1854. It is plausible that Oliver Hazard Perry was born on this property, which belonged to his grandfather, and that he built the now-standing house on the site of his grandfather's mansion after acquiring the property at auction in 1814. The property was acquired in 1865 by George Tiffany, the son-in-law of Matthew Perry, and was used as a rental property until the 1920s. In the late 1920s it underwent a \\"restoration\\" guided by Tiffany's widow, which brought the house interior into a romanticized Colonial Revival state, and was open for a time as a museum to the two leading figures of the Perry family. After again falling into decline, it underwent a second rehabilitation in 1944-45 by private owners. A area of the farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

He was the first appointed agent to the Winnebagos, as well as the Sauk and Fox, and one of the earliest pioneers to settle in present-day Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. His sons Nicholas Boilvin, Jr. and William C. Boilvin both became successful businessmen in Wisconsin during the mid- to late 19th century.Rice, James M.

(WHC v.10, p. 222) His daughter Catherine Boilvin Myott‚Äîalso M√©tis, by her father's marriage to a Ho- Chunk woman, became prominent as a cultural mediator with early settlers in the next wave in the American era in Wisconsin, such as Henry and Susan Hempstead Gratiot of the founding family of St. Louis. Biography Boilvin was born to a soldier residing in Quebec during the Seven Years' War. His father had gained \\"a good record by great kindness to a wounded American surgeon\\" who was held as a prisoner-of-war after his capture in the failed invasion of Canada in 1775. Boilvin traveled to the Northwest Territory after the signing of the Second Treaty of Paris in 1783 and, after settling in the Illinois Territory, he began trading with the local tribes in the Prairie du Chien area around February 1810. He was also a justice of the peace, being appointed in St. Clair County on May 3, 1809 and in Madison County on June 12, 1814. In a chance meeting while in St. Louis, he met with the American surgeon whom his father had befriended in Quebec. The surgeon was able to arrange for Boilvin to be appointed the principal Indian agent for the Prairie du Chien region on March 14, 1811. Observing the lead mining activity in the area by the Iowas, the Sauk and Fox as well as Canadians during this time, he communicated the future importance of the lead mining region to Secretary of War William Eustis.Mahoney, Timothy R. Provincial Lives: Middle-Class Experience in the Antebellum Middle West. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999. (pg. 20) He also reported the growing unrest and militantism among the Winnebago and other local tribes prior to Tecumseh's War and was told to him that the nations would: He resided there for several years however, during the War of 1812, he and his family were forced to leave the village and evacuated onto an American gunboat during the attack on Prairie du Chien by Lieutenant Colonel William McKay on July 14, 1814. Prior to the attack, Boilvin had directed a local resident to drive up his cattle, wishing to kill one of the heifers for some fresh meat. When the man spotted the approaching British forces, he returned to warn Boilvin. Going out to see for himself, Boilvin returned to raise the alarm and assisted in the evacuation of the settlement. The officers stationed at the garrison had been preparing to go riding in the countryside and, had McKay's forces arrived an hour or two later, it is thought the garrison would have been without an officer during the subsequent battle.Tuttle, Charles R. An Illustrated History of the State of Wisconsin: Being a Complete Civil, Political, and Military History of the State. Madison: B.B. Russell & Co., 1875. (pg. 123) Boilvin's house was destroyed during the attack, and a second house was built at the site in 1816. Boilvin studied the customs and culture of the Winnebago and provided the Department of War with a written vocabulary of the Winnebago language. His administration was supported by Eustis who provided him with considerable funding. In 1815, he became involved in a feud between Eustis and Governor William Clark who, according to a report he sent, accused Clark of abusing his position by \\"improperly using Indian goods and public property\\" for the benefit of his nephew Benjamin O'Fallon.Foley, William E. Wilderness Journey: The Life of William Clark. Columbia, Missouri: University of Missouri Press, 2004. (pg. 210) In the years prior to the Black Hawk War, he had the trust and confidence of many of the tribes in the Upper Mississippi. A skilled interpreter, he was present at several treaties signed between the Winnebago and the United States during the 1810s and 1820s. He and Maurice Blondeau often negotiated directly with tribes on behalf of the federal government. Boilvin was also a close friend of Michel Brisbois, who resided near Boilvin's home in Prairie du Chien during his later years. During the summer of 1827, Boilvin drowned while traveling upriver on a keel boat to St. Louis and was later buried there. His sub-agent John Marsh was in charge of the agency until the appointment of Joseph M.

A relative of the ruling Heraclian dynasty, Gregory was fiercely pro-Chalcedonian and led a rebellion in 646 against Emperor Constans II over the latter's support for Monothelism. Soon after declaring himself emperor, he faced an Arab invasion in 647. He confronted the invaders but was decisively defeated and killed at Sufetula. Africa returned to imperial allegiance after his death and the Arabs' withdrawal, but the foundations of Byzantine rule there had been fatally undermined. Biography Gregory the Patrician was related by blood to Emperor Heraclius (r. 610‚Äì641) and his grandson Constans II (r. 641‚Äì668), and was possibly the son of Heraclius' cousin Niketas.Hollingsworth (1991), p. 875Moore (1999) Gregory is first attested as Exarch of Africa (\\"patrikios of Africa\\" in Theophanes) in July 645,Winkelmann et al. (2000), pp. 49‚Äì50Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 554 but may have been appointed already under Heraclius.Pringle (1981), p. 46 The Exarchate at this time was in internal turmoil due to the conflict between the mainly Orthodox Chalcedonian population and the supporters of Monotheletism, an attempt at compromise between Chalcedonianism and Monophysitism devised and promoted by Heraclius in 638. In Africa, the latter was mostly advocated by refugees from Egypt. In an effort to lessen the tensions, in July 645 Gregory hosted a theological dispute in his capital Carthage between the Chalcedonian Maximus the Confessor and the Monothelite former Patriarch of Constantinople, Pyrrhus. Gregory helped to bring about a reconciliation between the two, and Pyrrhus re-embraced the Chalcedonian position. Over the next few months, several local synods in Africa proceeded to condemn Monotheletism as heresy. The Mediterranean world at the time of Gregory's rebellion In 646, Gregory launched a rebellion against Constans. The obvious reason was the latter's support for Monotheletism, but it undoubtedly was also a reaction to the Muslim conquest of Egypt, and the threat it presented to Byzantine Africa. Given the failure of the imperial government in Constantinople to stop the Muslim advance, it was, in the words of Charles Diehl, \\"a great temptation for the powerful governor of Africa to secede from the feeble and remote empire that seemed incapable of defending its subjects\\". Doctrinal differences, as well as the long-established autonomy of the African exarchate, reinforced this tendency.Diehl (1896), pp. 554‚Äì556 The Arab chronicler al-Tabari on the other hand claims that Gregory's revolt was provoked by a levy of 300 pounds of gold demanded by Constans. Arab sources claim that after he was proclaimed emperor he minted coins with his own effigy, but none have so far been found.Diehl (1896), p. 557cf. It seems that both Maximus the Confessor and Pope Theodore I encouraged or at least supported Gregory in this venture. Thus the Pope supposedly sent an envoy to convey a dream by Maximus, according to which two rival choirs of angels shouted \\"Victory to Constantine [Constans] Augustus\\" and \\"Victory to Gregory Augustus\\", with the former gradually falling silent and the latter winning out.Diehl (1896), pp. 556‚Äì557 The revolt seems to have found broad support among the populace as well, not only among the Romanized Africans, but also among the Berbers of the interior. In 642‚Äì643, the Arabs seized Cyrenaica and the eastern half of Tripolitania, along with Tripoli. It was only an order from Caliph Umar (r. 634‚Äì644) that halted their westward expansion.Diehl (1896), pp. 557‚Äì558 In 647, however, Umar's successor Uthman ordered Abdallah ibn Sa'ad to invade the Exarchate with 20,000 men. The Muslims invaded western Tripolitania and advanced up to the northern boundary of the Byzantine province of Byzacena. Gregory confronted the Arabs on their return at Sufetula, but was defeated and killed.Diehl (1896), pp. 558‚Äì559Pringle (1981), p. 47 Agapius of Hierapolis and some Syriac sources claim that he survived the defeat and fled to Constantinople, where he was reconciled with Constans, but most modern scholars accept the Arab chroniclers' account of his death in battle. The Arab accounts also claim that the Muslims captured Gregory's daughter, who had fought at her father's side. She was carried along back to Egypt as part of the booty, but she fell from her camel on the march and was killed.Diehl (1896), p. 559 After Gregory's death, the Arabs sacked Sufetula and raided across the Exarchate, while the Byzantines withdrew to their fortresses. Unable to storm the Byzantine fortifications, and satisfied with the huge amounts of plunder they had taken, the Arabs agreed to depart in exchange for the payment of a heavy tribute in gold.Diehl (1896), pp. 559‚Äì560 Despite the fact that the Arab raid was not followed up for some time, and the restoration of ties with Constantinople, Byzantine rule over Africa was shaken to its roots by Gregory's rebellion and the Arab victory. The Berber tribes in particular shook off their allegiance to the Empire, and most of southern Tunisia seems to have slipped outside the control of Carthage.Diehl (1896), pp. 560‚Äì561 Thus the Battle of Sufetula marked \\"the end, more or less near, but inevitable, of Byzantine domination in Africa\\" (Diehl).Diehl (1896), p. 562 References Sources   Category:647 deaths Category:7th- century Byzantine people Category:Byzantine usurpers Category:Exarchs of Africa Category:Heraclian Dynasty Category:Byzantines killed in battle Category:Byzantine people of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars Category:Patricii Category:Monarchs killed in action Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Gregory the Patrician"},{"id":"17386715","text":"F-105D, 60-0508, at Wings Over the Rockies Museum, Denver, CO, formerly with 49th TFW (see photo details for service history) This article lists all known surviving Republic F-105 Thunderchief complete airframes in the world (as of May 2008) along with their serial number, location, and any notes of significance about that airframe.

It lies mainly in Richmond, but extends along the road running southwest and southeast from the two crossings. Two mill complexes are the visual focal points of the village: the Carmichael plant on the west, and the Columbia Narrow Fabrics Company complex near the village center. The buildings in the village are predominantly residential worker housing set close to the road, which were built in the second half of the 19th century. There are two imposing Greek Revival houses, both built c. 1850, and one Late Victorian house, all of which belonged to mill owners.

Biography Born in Columbus, Ohio, Gordon in 1911 starred in Vitagraph Studios' screen portrayal of the Lady Godiva legend. Perhaps her most memorable performance, however, is as Richard Arlen's mother in the World War I silent film Wings (1927), which won the first Academy Award for Best Picture. In a highly dramatic scene in that acclaimed production, Gordon bids farewell to Arlen as he departs for combat flight training in France, tearfully packing him off with his favorite childhood toy. Gordon died in Los Angeles, California.

It came to light on May 7, 2008, when DEA/FBI agents raided nine business establishments targeted in the operation. Although the raids were not in the Western District of Pennsylvania, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Mary Beth Buchanan, is overseeing the operation. Mary Beth Buchanan also oversaw Operation Pipe Dream which targeted companies that sold water bongs and pipes. Through Operation Pipe Dream, comedian Tommy Chong was incarcerated for 9 months for violating drug paraphernalia laws. In executing their search warrant in Operation True Test, the federal agents seized over 10,000 copies of Tommy Chong's yet to be released documentary, a/k/a Tommy Chong. It has yet to be determined exactly why the DVDs were seized during the raid. Tommy Chong has speculated that the seizure may rest with prohibitions against one benefiting financially from a crime; however Mr. Chong has not released publicly that he has been charged with such an offense. In a statement released to the press, Tommy Chong stated \\"It's (the seizure of the DVDs) a way to punish the distributor financially. There's no way to get the DVDs back until the investigation is over.\\" Mr. Chong also stated that he has no ownership in the film, a/k/a Tommy Chong.

It is a -story, wood- shingled, gambrel-roofed residence, with a large, stone chimney; a simple entry at the left side of a 3-bay, south-facing fa√ßade; and a 1-story wing at the left side. The house was probably built between 1685 and 1713, probably by Joseph Stanton (1646-1713), the third son of Thomas Stanton (1616-1677), one of the original settlers in this area. Joseph's son Thomas (1691 aft. 1720), had no surviving sons, so the farm was deeded in 1753 to his son-in-law Nathaniel Sheffield (1712-1790) the husband of Rebecca Stanton (1713-1775). Today the house is called the Stanton-Sheffield house. Since 1845, when the Sheffields sold the house, it has been in the hands of several owners, all of whom have respected its integrity. The Sheffield House is an outstanding example of a Rhode Island farmhouse which has remained relatively unaltered from its construction at the turn of the 17th century. Said to be the oldest home in Charlestown and in an excellent state of preservation, it is a living document of early settlement and vernacular architect. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
