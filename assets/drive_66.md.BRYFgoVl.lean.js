A vote in 1991 to join neighboring Issaquah failed, as did a vote on incorporation the following year. A renewed movement to become a city, born of frustration with development policies set by the county government, met with voter approval in 1998. Sammamish was officially incorporated on August 31, 1999. The city annexed Klahanie on January 1, 2016.

The population was 198 as of the 2010 census, down from an estimated peak of \\"several thousand\\" in the 1920s. Located in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, 49 miles east of Everett, Washington, on the South Fork of the Skykomish River, Skykomish was founded as a railroad town. Today, it is mainly a stopping point for recreational access to the surrounding mountains, including skiing at nearby Stevens Pass. Being located in the far northeastern corner of King County, mountains deny Skykomish any road access to the rest of the county. Instead, U.S. Highway 2 (known in the area as the Cascade Highway) connects it with Snohomish County to the north and through Stevens Pass (17 miles east of town) to Chelan County. History The name \\"Skykomish\\" derives from the Skykomish or Skai-whamish tribe (originally considered a subdivision of the Snoqualmies) who inhabited the area before European settlement.Ruby, Robert H. and John Arthur Brown. (1992.) A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest, 2nd ed. University of Oklahoma Press. p. 211. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 2009-12-13. The townsite was settled in 1889 by John Maloney, a guide for the surveying team on the Great Northern Railway. The town of Skykomish was officially incorporated on June 5, 1909. From the 1890s to 1974, Skykomish was a maintenance and fueling station for the Great Northern Railway, which eventually became part of the Burlington Northern Railroad, and presently the BNSF Railway. It was also once the western terminus for electric operations (1909‚Äì56) on the Cascade Tunnel route all the way to Wenatchee. Here, steam or diesel locomotives were changed or coupled to electric locomotives.Middleton, William D. When the Steam Railroads Electrified. Indiana University Press: 2002. The town gained a public library in 1945, operated by the King County Rural Library District and located in the city hall. It was replaced with a separate building in 1994. Skykomish's population peaked at around 8,000 in the 1920s and shrank to under 300 by 1990 due to the loss of businesses and jobs. Waste disposal practices, common during that era, resulted in the contamination of its soil, its groundwater, and the Skykomish River by oil and heavy metals. BNSF (then BN) and the Washington State Department of Ecology began remediation discussions in the mid-1980s, and in 2006, agreed to a plan whereby the railroad would pay up to $50 million to clean up the area over a three-year period (completed in 2009). This effort involved massive excavations‚Äîessentially removing the contaminated soil and replacing it with clean soil‚Äîand the rebuilding of a levee. (The eventual total cost of the cleanup exceeded $100 million.) Twenty two of Skykomish's buildings ‚Äî both homes and business ‚Äî were temporarily moved during the cleanup process. After the contaminated soil under them was removed, the buildings were moved back to their original locations on new foundations and utilities connections. The town was restored with modern conveniences such as sidewalks and street lights, but the historic character of Skykomish was maintained. The greatest benefit of the cleanup to every resident and business in town was the installation of the new Waste Water Treatment system connected to every building. Geography Skykomish is located at (47.710048, -121.355695). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Elementary schools include Beverly Park Elementary, Mount View Elementary, Southern Heights Elementary, and White Center Heights Elementary. Secondary schools include Cascade Middle School, New Start High School, and Evergreen High School. History=Incorporation White Center is one of only two heavily urbanized areas in King County that is not incorporated as part of a city (the other being Skyway). Seattle has been working towards incorporating the area since the mid-2000s. An area south of White Center, known as North Highline, was annexed by neighboring Burien on April 1, 2010. The Seattle city council rejected annexation of White Center in 2009, and a measure to annex White Center to Burien was rejected by voters in 2012. Plans to annex White Center got a boost in March 2016 when the state legislature directed that $7 million go to the city of Seattle if it annexes the area. Completing annexation would require approval by the voters in the area as well as by the Seattle City Council, and would not be completed before 2017. Notable people * David S.

The population was 23,025 at the 2010 census and an estimated 25,298 in 2019, making Bainbridge Island the second largest city in Kitsap County. The island is separated from the Kitsap Peninsula by Port Orchard, with Bremerton lying to the southwest. Bainbridge Island is connected to Seattle via the Washington State Ferries system and to Poulsbo and the Suquamish Indian Reservation by State Route 305, which uses the Agate Pass Bridge. In July 2005, CNN/Money and Money magazine named Bainbridge Island the second-best place to live in the United States. In August 2013, Bainbridge Island was recognized by Google with an eCity Award.Google eCity Awards Retrieved December 16, 2013 This award recognizes the strongest online business community in each state. History For thousands of years, members of the Suquamish people and their ancestors lived on the land now called Bainbridge Island. There were nine villages on the island; this included winter villages at Port Madison, Battle Point, Point White, Lynwood Center, Port Blakely, and Eagle Harbor, as well as summer villages at Manzanita, Fletcher Bay, and Rolling Bay. In 1792, English explorer Captain George Vancouver spent several days with his ship HMS Discovery anchored off Restoration Point at the southern end of Bainbridge Island while boat parties surveyed other parts of Puget Sound. Vancouver spent a day exploring Rich Passage, Port Orchard, and Sinclair Inlet. He failed to find Agate Passage, and so his maps show Bainbridge Island as a peninsula. Vancouver named Restoration Point on May 29, the anniversary of the English Restoration, in honor of King Charles II. In 1841, US Navy Lieutenant Charles Wilkes visited the island while surveying the Pacific Northwest. Lt. Wilkes named the island after Commodore William Bainbridge, commander of the frigate USS Constitution in the War of 1812. Settlers originally used Bainbridge Island as a center for the logging and shipbuilding industries. The island was known for huge and accessible cedars, which were especially in demand for ships' masts. The original county seat of Kitsap County was at Port Madison on the island's north end. In 1855, the Suquamish tribe relinquished their claim to Bainbridge Island by signing the Point Elliott Treaty. The Suquamish agreed to cede all of their territory (which included Bainbridge Island) to the United States in exchange for a reservation at Port Madison and fishing rights to Puget Sound. The first generation of Japanese immigrants, the Issei, came in 1883. During World War II, Japanese-American residents of Bainbridge Island were the first to be sent to internment camps, an event commemorated by the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial, which opened in 2011. They were held by the US government through the duration of the war for fear of espionage. A High-frequency direction finding (HFDF) station was established here by the Navy during the war. These radio intercept sites along the West Coast were used to track Japanese warships and merchant marine vessels as far away as the Western Pacific. The other West Coast stations were in California at Point Arguello, Point Saint George, Farallon Islands and San Diego. The city of Bainbridge Island has occupied the entire island since February 28, 1991, when the former city of Winslow (around 1.5 square miles (3.9 km2) of land on Eagle Harbor, incorporated August 9, 1947) annexed the rest of the island. Since the 1960s, Bainbridge Island has become an increasingly affluent bedroom community of Seattle, a 35-minute ride away on the Washington State Ferries.

Bainbridge Island is located within the Puget Sound Basin, east of the Kitsap Peninsula, directly east of the Manette Peninsula and west of the city of Seattle. The island is approximately wide and long, encompassing nearly , and is one of the larger islands in Puget Sound. Bainbridge Island shorelines border the main body of Puget Sound, as well as Port Orchard Bay, a large protected embayment, and two high-current tidal passages, Rich Passage and Agate Pass. The island is characterized by an irregular coastline of approximately , with numerous bays and inlets and a significant diversity of other coastal land forms, including spits, bluffs, dunes, lagoons, cuspate forelands, tombolos, tide flats, streams and tidal deltas, islands, and rocky outcrops. The high point is Toe Jam Hill. On the Kitsap Peninsula, Bremerton and Poulsbo lie across the Port Orchard channel to the west, and the city of Port Orchard lies across Rich Passage to the south. The island is quite hilly and is known for its popular Chilly Hilly bicycle ride every February. This ride has been the unofficial start to the bicycling season in the Pacific Northwest since 1975. Bainbridge Island is connected to the Kitsap Peninsula by the Agate Pass Bridge, carrying SR 305 over Agate Passage. The only other public way off the island is by the Seattle‚ÄìBainbridge ferry, the Washington State Ferries service from the dock at Winslow in Eagle Harbor to Colman Dock (Pier 52) in Seattle.

The population was 37,729 at the 2010 census and an estimated 41,405 in 2019, making it the largest city on the Kitsap Peninsula. Bremerton is home to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and the Bremerton Annex of Naval Base Kitsap. Bremerton is connected to downtown Seattle by two ferries: a 60-minute ferry that carries both vehicles and walk-on passengers, and a 28-minute Fast Ferry that carries passengers and a limited number of bicycles. Geography Bremerton, the largest city in Kitsap County, is located directly west of Seattle across Puget Sound on the Kitsap Peninsula. It is bounded on the southeast and east by Sinclair Inlet and the strait of Port Orchard respectively. The city is divided by the Port Washington Narrows, a strait spanned by two bridges that connect the eastern and western sides of the city. The part of the city northeast of the narrows is referred to as East Bremerton. The city limits extend to the southwest as far as the Mason County line and include Bremerton National Airport. Bremerton is bordered to the south, across Sinclair Inlet, by the city of Port Orchard. According to the United States Census Bureau, Bremerton has a total area of , of which are land and are water. NeighborhoodsDowntown= The ferry terminal and waterfront are the heart of downtown. As Bremerton's historic center, downtown has seen the most dramatic change over the last decade, with blighted blocks being replaced by new apartments, and older buildings being restored. Attractions include Harborside Fountain Park, a boardwalk, and multiple naval history museums. The Admiral Theatre, a restored 1942 Art Deco theater, is Bremerton's most prominent venue for live music and entertainment. The district is known for breweries, coffeeshops, art galleries, and restaurants showcasing diverse cuisines. The city is in the beginning stages of creating a public square on Fourth Street to honor local music icon Quincy Jones. =Manette= Across the water from Downtown is Manette, a neighborhood on a separate peninsula that functioned as its own town from 1891 to 1930. It was annexed by Bremerton in 1918, and the first Manette Bridge was completed in 1930. Today, Manette is connected to Bremerton via the new Manette Bridge, completed in 2011. =Charleston= Charleston was formerly an independent town built to house and entertain sailors, and was annexed by the city in 1927. The neighborhood's center is Callow Avenue, a retail corridor anchored by The Charleston music venue. Charleston is a designated center in Bremerton's comprehensive plan, and has seen recent improvements to its streetscape. Charleston is casually defined by 11th Street to the north, Naval Avenue to the east, 1st Street to the south, and Cambrian Avenue to the west. Union Hill's sequoias and Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic church, as seen from the upper deck of Kiwanis Park =Union Hill= Between Charleston and Downtown is the Union Hill neighborhood. Its borders are Naval Avenue to the west, 11th Street to the north, Warren Avenue to the east, and the Naval Shipyard to the south. Union Hill is a predominantly residential neighborhood, showcasing Bremerton's most historic churches and a synagogue along Veneta Avenue. Near Veneta and 6th is a popular local diner, Noah's Ark; Bremerton's most architecturally notable place of worship, Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic Church; non-native towering sequoias; and a large park. =Evergreen= North of downtown's 11th Street boundary is the Evergreen neighborhood, anchored by Evergreen Park and bordered to the west by Warren Avenue. Evergreen Park offers beach access and a boat ramp, and hosts a weekly farmer's market in the summer. Evergreen is characterized by residential neighborhoods and water views. =Haddon= West of Evergreen and north of Union Hill and Charleston is Haddon. Haddon's center is Lulu Haddon Park, but Bremerton High School and Olympic College's campus are main focal points as well. Though it is an older, sleepier neighborhood traditionally more connected with the shipyard and local business, the Haddon neighborhood has recently gained notice for quirky local breakfast diner Hi-Lo's and an English style barrelhouse, Hale's Ales. Politics Bremerton is divided among three state legislative districts in Kitsap County, the 23rd legislative district to the north, 35th legislative district in the center and 26th legislative district to the south. Before redistricting in 2012, the line separating the first and sixth Congressional districts ran through East Bremerton. As a result of the 2012 redistricting, all of Bremerton now lies within the sixth Congressional district. The district is represented by Derek Kilmer, who was first elected to that position in 2012. Prior to Kilmer, Norm Dicks served as sixth district Representative from 1977 to 2013. The mayor is Greg Wheeler, Incorporated as a first-class city, Bremerton has been governed by a nonpartisan strong mayor and seven-member city council since 1985. Each member is elected from one of seven districts who in turn elect one member as President. The current form of government was established by a 1983 charter that eliminated a decades-old city commission composed of a mayor, public works commissioner and finance commissioner. Each member of the Kitsap County Board of Commissioners represents a portion of the city of Bremerton. This arrangement was an attempt to balance Bremerton's commercial influence with the remainder of the county, though most of its sales tax base has since relocated to unincorporated areas. Bremerton politics can vary in intensity, with some city council positions regularly unopposed and others having as many as four candidates in the 2005 primary election. Redevelopment projects have been a major source of debate, including the 2007 construction of a federally funded tunnel that would route ferry traffic under the downtown core as well as a planned waterfront boardwalk extension. As with most cities in the region, Bremerton precincts have historically been more favorable for Democratic candidates in state and federal elections, contrasting with more conservative-leaning voters in rural areas of the county. History \\"In the Navy Yard of Puget Sound\\", in Seattle and the Orient (1900). Two ships are shown in drydock; the two circular insets are titled \\"Iowa coming up the Sound\\" (upper) and \\"Torpedoboat Rowan\\" (lower). 1890s Bremerton is within the historical territory of the Suquamish people. The land was made available for non-Native settlement by the Treaty of Point Elliott of 1855. Bremerton was planned by German immigrant and Seattle entrepreneur William Bremer in 1891. In that year, Navy Lieutenant Ambrose Barkley Wyckoff purchased approximately of waterfront land on Sinclair Inlet. This land was owned by the Bremer family. Three years earlier, a U.S. Navy commission determined that Point Turner, between the protected waters of the Sinclair and Dyes inlets, would be the best site in the Pacific Northwest on which to establish a shipyard. Recognizing the large number of workers such a facility would employ, Bremer and his business partner and brother-in-law, Henry Hensel, purchased the undeveloped land near Point Turner at the inflated price of $200 per acre. In April 1891, Bremer arranged for the sale of to the Navy at $50 per acre. This land became part of the initial footprint of the Puget Sound Navy Yard. 1900‚Äì1930 Bremerton was incorporated on October 15, 1901, with Alvyn Croxton serving as the city's first mayor. Progress in the new city soon faced a major crisis, as Assistant Secretary of the Navy Charles Darling moved all repair work to the Mare Island Navy Yard in California in November 1902. Darling cited reports from commanders that the Bremerton waterfront was rife with prostitution, opium houses and frequent strongarmed robberies of sailors. Politics were probably also at play, as local newspapers reported that the city's incorporation left the shipyard essentially landlocked without room to expand. A dispute ensued between Mayor Croxton, who wanted to shutter all saloons in Bremerton, and three members of the city council, who attempted to block his efforts. Croxton eventually won out, and the council voted to revoke all liquor licenses in June 1904. With the ban, Darling reestablished the navy yard as a port of call. Saloons had begun to return to business within two years, however. In 1908, the city library and Union High School were established to serve the educational needs of the 2,993 residents recorded in the 1910 U.S. Census. During World War I, submarine construction and the addition of a third drydock caused the shipyard's workforce to balloon to over 4,000 employees. Growth due to the war effort and the 1918 annexation of the city of Manette, east of Bremerton on the Port Washington Narrows, can be seen in the 1920 census, which reported a population of 8,918. Bremerton absorbed Charleston, its neighboring city to the south in 1927. The population reached 10,170 in 1930. 1930s Manette was linked to Bremerton by the Manette Bridge, a bridge constructed in June 1930. Prior to this time, the trip could only be made by ferry or a long trip around Dyes Inlet through Chico, Silverdale, and Tracyton on mostly unimproved roads. This wooden bridge was replaced with a concrete and steel structure in October 1949. It was replaced by the new Manette Bridge in 2011. At the shipyard, the Hammerhead Crane No. 28 was completed in April 1933. One of the nation's largest, it is capable of lifting 250 tons and continues to dominate the Bremerton skyline. 1940s Bremerton's Admiral Theater opened in 1942 as a cinema; in the 1990s it was remodeled for performances and banquets. At the peak of World War II, the Bremerton area was home to an estimated 80,000 residents due to the heavy workload of shipbuilding, repair and maintenance required for the Pacific war effort. Most of the relocation was temporary, though, and only 27,678 citizens were left in the city by 1950. During the 1940s, presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman both visited Bremerton. Roosevelt made a campaign stop at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on August 12, 1944, giving a national radio address in front of a backdrop of civilian workers. During the course of his 35-minute speech, it is believed the president suffered an angina attack, experiencing severe chest and shoulder pain. An electrocardiogram was immediately administered once he left the podium, but it showed nothing abnormal. President Truman took a two-day tour of Washington state in 1948, speaking from the balcony of the Elks Club on the morning of June 10. Local legend has it that a man in the large Pacific Avenue crowd yelled the infamous \\"Give 'em hell, Harry!\\" line for the first time. This is a matter of dispute, however, as local newspapers quoted the man as having shouted \\"Lay it on, Harry!\\" Despite this, there is a bronze plaque attached to the corner of the building declaring that spot to be the place where the phrase \\"Give 'em hell, Harry\\" was first uttered. With the return of World War II GIs to the homefront, the need for post-secondary education became evident to officials of the Bremerton School District. Olympic Junior College (now Olympic College), a two-year institution, opened its doors to 575 students in the fall of 1946. Initially, it operated in the former Lincoln School building, gradually moving operations to World War II‚Äìsurplus Quonset buildings at its current 16th & Chester site. About 100 students received associate degrees at the first commencement exercises held June 10, 1948. President Truman was in attendance and received the college's first honorary degree. Operation of the college transferred from the school district to the state of Washington in 1967. 1950‚Äì1970 The 1950s and 1960s were a period of stability for the city. A second high school opened in 1956,Bremerton School Board Minutes and two comprehensive high schools operated in the city until 1978. Growth in East Bremerton necessitated the construction of another span across the Port Washington Narrows in 1958. The $5.3 million, four-lane Warren Avenue Bridge allowed for increased traffic on State Highway 21-B (now State Route 303). The battleship USS Missouri, site of the Japanese surrender treaty signing that ended World War II, was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet at PSNS in 1955. For 30 years, she served as the city's primary tourist attraction. Hundreds of thousands of visitors walked the \\"surrender deck\\" before the ship was recommissioned in 1985. She was decommissioned on March 31, 1992 (final), and her name was struck off the register on January 12, 1995. In 1998 \\"Mighty Mo\\" was donated to the USS Missouri Memorial Association and became a museum ship at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Population growth was flat, with 26,681 enumerated in the 1960 census, leading Bremerton leaders to annex the shipyard the following year in an effort to include stationed sailors in those figures. While the Vietnam War spawned protests and sit-ins on the Olympic College campus, the city was relatively free of civil disorder during the 1960s. 1970s With the 1973 selection of the Bangor Ammunition Depot northwest of Bremerton as the Pacific home of the new Trident submarine fleet, residential and commercial development began to move north, closer to Silverdale, and farther from the Bremerton downtown core. Numerous failed proposals were made at redevelopment beginning in the early 1970s, including discussions of a waterfront hotel and the erection of a large canopy over the central business district. Meanwhile, most of the city's office and retail space remained in the hands of Edward Bremer, son of William Bremer and the sole remaining heir to his wealth. (In order to receive their inheritance, William Bremer's three children were honor-bound to never marry.) Bremer began to neglect his properties, never increasing decades-old lease rates and failing to make necessary maintenance upgrades. In 1978, the Bremerton City Council passed an ordinance declaring the entire downtown a \\"blighted area\\". 1980s In 1985, Safeco subsidiary Winmar Corporation developed the Kitsap Mall in Silverdale. With lower taxes and minimal planning regulations in the unincorporated town, Silverdale achieved virtually unfettered growth. Sears, J.C. Penney, Montgomery Ward, Nordstrom Place Two, Woolworth and Rite Aid all closed their downtown Bremerton stores in the 1980s and '90s. Upon the death of Edward Bremer in 1987, the Bremer properties were placed under the complete control of a trust held by Olympic College. Not being in the real-estate business, the college did not actively market its holdings, and the downtown was composed almost entirely of very large empty storefronts. , many buildings remained vacant. 1990‚Äìpresent The Norm Dicks Government Center In recent years Bremerton has seen its share of community setbacks. Like many other West Coast cities, Bremerton school teachers were pitted against their district's administration for nearly a month in September 1994 during a contentious strike. Four elderly residents were killed in an enormous three-alarm fire that destroyed the 165-unit Kona Village apartment complex in November 1997. Damages were estimated at $7.5 million. A replacement senior apartment building has since been built. Despite a hard-fought battle throughout the mid-1990s by local politicians to have the decommissioned and mothballed USS Missouri, already in the Bremerton Navy Yard, stay in Bremerton as a museum ship and tourist attraction, Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton awarded the ship to the Pearl Harbor Naval Base, Hawaii, in 1998. It now sits near the USS Arizona Memorial to demonstrate where U.S. involvement in World War II started on December 7, 1941, and where it ended by the signing of the instrument of surrender by the Japanese on board the USS Missouri, on September 2, 1945. Beginning with the building of a waterfront boardwalk and marina in 1992, Bremerton had begun the process of revitalizing its downtown community. That same year, the Bremerton Historic Ships Association opened the destroyer to public tours at the end of the boardwalk; the ship was built in the Puget Sound area in 1958, commissioned in 1959, and had played a back-up role in the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident that further escalated U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War with the Congressional passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, allowing President Lyndon B. Johnson to send fighting troops in addition to the \\"advisors\\" already on the ground in Vietnam. In 2000, Bremerton saw the opening of the waterfront multimodal bus/ferry terminal and a hotel/conference center complex in 2004. The high-rise Norm Dicks Government Center also opened that year, housing City Hall and other government offices. The Waterfront Fountain Park and Naval History Museum adjacent to the Bremerton Bus/Ferry Terminal opened in 2007, and a newly expanded marina with more boat capacity was completed in 2008. Plans to build an extension to the current boardwalk from the USS Turner Joy to Evergreen Park is in the litigation stage. Even though the boardwalk extension project is fully funded, opposition to the extension by the Suquamish Tribe concerning the impact to treaty fishing rights threatens the project. Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott, a 132-room hotel, opened in March 2010 on the site of the old City Hall building made obsolete by the new Norm Dicks Government Building. Condominiums were built on the waterfront to lure more people to live and shop in the downtown area as part of the revitalization effort. However, construction delays and economic downturn forced the builder of the publicly funded Harborside Condominium complex, the Kitsap County Consolidated Housing Authority, to fall $40.5 million in debt. That debt later was taken on by Kitsap County, which hired a marketing firm to sell the remaining units at a lower-than-anticipated price.Kitsap County Likely to Take on Debt for Bremerton Condos The privately built 400-condominium complex north of the Harborside complex opened shortly before the Harborside complex and also didn't sell as well as projected. The remaining empty condos were eventually sold at auction for a lower cost. The Harborside Fountain Park opened on May 5, 2007. Located on the waterfront just steps away from the Kitsap Conference Center, the park features five large copper-ringed fountains, wading pools, and lush landscaping. The park will also be home to the Harborside Heritage Naval Museum. A tunnel underneath downtown, traversing from the ferry terminal to Highway 304 (Burwell Street), has been newly opened that allows for a smoother egress for vehicles exiting the car ferry and makes for a more pedestrian friendly downtown. A new fountain park above the tunnel blends water and art, along with the bow of a ship and the conning tower of a submarine as a tribute to the workers at the Bremerton Naval Shipyard over the years. The stations along the walk include pictures of the shipyard, workers, and shipbuilding and repair statistics. The popular Blackberry Festival is held annually during Labor Day weekend on the waterfront boardwalk to celebrate everything blackberry. Local residents, shopkeepers and growers bring their blackberry ice creams, pastries, pies, jams, jellies, candies, and even ciders and wines to this annual event. Free entertainment includes music by local musicians and entertainers performing throughout the three-day festival, the Berry Fun Run, and the Blackberry Criterium Bike Race. Bremerton National Airport sponsors the annual Blackberry Festival Fly-In, with shuttle service provided by Kitsap Transit to the festival. As the festival's background story goes, the downtown waterfront of Bremerton where the festival takes place was a massive overgrowth of wild blackberry bushes that were removed to build the waterfront Fountain Park, Boardwalk, Marina and Bus/Ferry Terminal.

KaKue died in December 1886 leaving no will and his wife Tu Tue Tue was sole heir. Tu Tue Tue died four years later in 1890 leaving a brother and a sister Tar-de-blu & a daughter Katie. After the death of Tar-de-blu the estate was settled in 1909 leaving Chief Jacob the son of Tar-de-blu as sole heir. When Katie died childless in 1896 her husband Alpheus Loughrey was sole heir. Alpheus had four sons from a previous marriage and the allotment eventually passed to his sons, Alpheus was a white man who had married Katie, the daughter of KaKue aka Beedee and Tu-Tue-Tue. KaKue aka \\"Beedee\\" was not related to Cyrus Beede Pickrell who was an Indian agent in Suquamish from 1906-1916 or to Cyrus Beede who was at the time the US Indian Inspector. Development began in 1916 with the formation of the Indianola Beach Land Company by W. L. Gazzam to promote real estate sales on the land owned by the Loughreys. A dock and a store were built as amenities to attract buyers; a second store, the Beachcomber, was built the next year. From the beginning, Indianola has been a vacation community, with its population inflating considerably in the summertime. In the early 20th century, most transportation on Puget Sound was by steamer, and a community‚Äôs dock was often its only lifeline to the outside world. Such was the case for the young community of Indianola Beach, and by 1918 a steamer was docking there every weekend. Daily ferry service was initiated in 1919 when Carl Hendrix organized twelve passengers to pay in advance for one year‚Äôs daily service between Indianola Beach and Seattle. Hendrix and his wife established a school the same year. Cyrus Beede Pickrell, who had been Indian Agent for the Port Madison Reservation, moved to Indianola Beach from Suquamish with his family in 1920. Postal service had been discontinued, so when the Pickrells opened a new store, they housed the postal operation at Indianola Beach with Cyrus as Postmaster. Around this time, the Postmaster General took issue with the double name of Indianola Beach and the post office was renamed Kitsap in honor of Chief Kitsap of the Suquamish tribe. Plans to establish a library and community hall were cause for much activity and development in the 1920s. Lots were auctioned off and a carnival was held in 1927 to raise funds. The Indianola Beach Improvement Club was incorporated in 1928 to raise more building money. The Club acquired some lots from W. L. Gazzam, which were raffled off with the proceeds going toward the purchase of property on which to build the structure. The Indianola Clubhouse was finally built in 1930. By 1929, three passenger boats left the Indianola dock for Seattle every day, and the 1930s brought more connections to the outside world. A power line was strung in 1930, and phone service was established in 1934. The Port of Indianola was established in 1933 after a special election. The dock, which had previously only accommodated passengers, was widened and reinforced to allow auto access. In 1935, Kitsap County began taking surveys to build a road to connect Indianola and Suquamish; when the road was completed in 1939, it was the first time Indianola was accessible by other means of transportation than boat. Road access to Indianola changed the character of the community somewhat, as the community now had access to more amenities in Kitsap and was no longer self-contained. The school closed in 1941 after more than twenty years of classes. Kitsap County‚Äôs naval bases and facilities brought a population boom during World War II, and many families settled in Indianola. Ferry service was discontinued in Fall of 1951 after the Agate Pass Bridge opened and the Washington State Ferries took over ferry service on Puget Sound. It was not until after 1957 that the name of the post office was changed from Kitsap to Indianola, due to the confusion caused by its sharing a name with the county.

ClimateHistory Founded in 1853 by Benjamin Bannister, the community was originally known as \\"Appletree Cove\\". By 1880 it was a lumber town until the mill closed down in the early 20th century. Known as the \\"little city by the sea\\", Kingston is a northern gateway to the Olympic Peninsula and is the social and economic center of the north end of the Kitsap Peninsula. King's Town In 1869, W.S. Ladd and his wife Caroline built a cabin on Appletree Cove. Michael King then bought the cabin nine years later. He moved in along with ten oxen and ten men. They slowly logged the hills around Appletree Cove. King built many small buildings and shacks along the shore for his men and animals. In 1882, he was done and moved on. The shacks and bunkhouses were left behind and lived in by drifters, squatters and old loggers. People living in the area often referred to this as \\"King's Town\\", probably as a joke. The name slowly evolved into Kingston and stuck. Resort town The Kingston townsite was platted on April 24, 1890, by C.C. Calkins and Samuel B. Brierly. Calkins dreamed of Kingston as a resort town for vacationers from Seattle. Calkins called it \\"the Monterey of Washington\\". Calkins had drawings and designs for a giant hotel on the waterfront, with a boat launch, a church on the hill, and a college. After Calkins and Brierly platted the town, a lower than expected number of people showed up to settle there. Calkins then gave up and left. The town slowly grew, but not at the pace that Calkins had dreamed. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 1,611 people, 685 households, and 452 families residing in the CDP.

Transportation Kingston has a Washington State Ferries terminal for auto/passenger service to Edmonds. In September 2012, due to financial losses, the Port of Kingston discontinued its SoundRunner Kingston‚ÄìSeattle passenger- only system. One of the former vessels, the Spirit of Kingston, was transferred to the King County Ferry District on March 18, 2013, for service as part of the King County Water Taxi fleet. In January 2016 Kingston accepted delivery of a new modern fireboat. The new vessel is long, can travel at , and can pump 2,700 gallons per minute. The Department of Homeland Security has provided small ports with grants to equip themselves with modern fireboats, with sealed cabins, that can also help counter other threats, like oil spills, or attacks by chemical or biological weapons. Two thirds of the cost of this fireboat, $409,813, were paid by a federal grant. The vessel also has modern infrared sensors, which can help in search and rescue missions, and search for the hot spot at the center of a fire. Kingston had a smaller, slower, less capable older fireboat. Both vessels can project fire suppressant foam, less likely to sink flaming vessels, but experience with the older vessel suggests most of the fires the new vessel will fight will be on the shore, near the water. Kitsap Fast Ferries began service from Kingston to Seattle in November 2018. Education Public education is provided by the North Kitsap School District. Kingston's schools include Kingston Co-op Preschool, Gordon Elementary, Kingston Middle School, Spectrum Community School, Wolfle Elementary and Kingston High School. Popular culture Taree is a popular American Rock song by the band Soundgarden named after the Taree neighborhood in Kingston..

The name was changed to \\"Manchester\\" in 1892 in honor of the city of Manchester, England. Manchester was accessible by land via Shelton/Allyn/Belfair, but the main population center in the region, Seattle, had only boat access. After a permanent dock was built in 1908, regular steamboat service connected Manchester to nearby communities like Colby, Southworth, and Harper, and to Seattle across the water. From 1925 to 1936, a ferry route across Puget Sound connected Manchester with Alki Point in West Seattle. When the Alki Point dock washed away in 1936, the Seattle terminus was shifted to Colman Dock on the Seattle central waterfront.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats-A Legend on Puget Sound, at pages 134, 135, 211, and 374.

In grammar school and Ephrata High School, he received \\"all A's\\", He credits his 12th grade teacher, Elizabeth Schaub, for his love \\"of language, thought, and writing.\\" In 1975, he started attending the University of Maryland as a pre-med student where his hours away from the gym were spent in the study of \\"genetics, physical chemistry, and organic chemistry.\\" After three years he left the university. He said his ultimate goal during that period was to become a psychiatrist.Mike Mentzer ‚Äì Bodybuilder, Writer, and Philosopher by Bob BurnsGraduates of Ephrata High School Bodybuilding career=Amateur Mentzer started bodybuilding when he was 12 years of age at a body weight of after seeing the men on the covers of several muscle magazines. His father had bought him set of weights and an instruction booklet. The booklet suggested that he train no more than three days a week, so Mike did just that. By age 15, his body weight had reached , at which Mike could bench press . Mike's goal at the time was to look like his bodybuilding hero, Bill Pearl. After graduating high school, Mentzer served four years in the United States Air Force. It was during this time he started working out over three hours a day, six days a week. Mentzer started competing in local physique contests when he was 18 years old and attended his first contest in 1969. In 1971, Mentzer entered and won the Mr. Lancaster contest. In 1971 he suffered his worst defeat, placing 10th at the AAU Mr. America, which was won by Casey Viator. Mentzer considered his presence at this contest important later on, as he met Viator, who gave Mentzer the contact information for his trainer Arthur Jones. Due to a severe shoulder injury, he was forced to quit training from 1971 to 1974. In early 1975, however, he resumed training and returned to competition in 1975 at the Mr. America contest, placing third behind Robby Robinson and Roger Callard. Mentzer went on to win that competition the next year, in 1976. He won the 1977 North America championships in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and competed a week later at the 1977 Mr. Universe in N√Æmes, France, placing second to Kal Szkalak. In 1978, Mentzer won the Mr. Universe in Acapulco, Mexico with the first and only perfect 300 score. He became a professional bodybuilder after that 1978 Universe win. Professional In late 1979, Mentzer won the heavyweight class of the Mr. Olympia, again with a perfect 300 score, but he lost in the overall to Frank Zane who was awarded the title for a third time that year. In the 1980 Mr. Olympia he placed fourth (in a tie with Boyer Coe) behind Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chris Dickerson and Frank Zane. Retirement He retired from competitive bodybuilding after that show at the age of 29. He maintained that the contest was rigged until the day he died. While he never said he thought that he should have won, he maintained that Arnold should not have, though he eventually got on good terms with Schwarzenegger. Legacy In 2002, Mentzer was inducted into the IFBB Hall of Fame. Bodybuilding philosophy Mentzer was an Objectivist and insisted that philosophy and bodybuilding are one and the same. He said \\"Man is an indivisible entity, an integrated unit of mind and body.\\" Thus, his books contain as much philosophy as they do bodybuilding information. Mentzer took the bodybuilding concepts developed by Arthur Jones and attempted to perfect them. Through years of study, observation, knowledge of stress physiology, the most up-to-date scientific information available, and careful use of his reasoning abilities, Mentzer devised and successfully implemented his own theory of bodybuilding. Mentzer's theories are intended to help a drug-free person achieve his or her full genetic potential within the shortest amount of time.The Wisdom of Mike Mentzer High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way was Mentzer's final work. In it, he detailed the principles of high intensity weight training. Weight training, he insisted, had to be brief, infrequent, and intense, to attain the best results in the shortest amount of time. Heavy Duty II also espouses critical thinking. In this book, Mentzer shows why people need to use their reasoning ability to live happy, mature, adult lives, and he shows readers how to go about doing so. Bodybuilding was endorsed as only one potential component of an individual's existence, encouraging many other worthwhile pursuits throughout his books.High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way Diet and nutrition Diet has always been as important, if not more, as weight-training for bodybuilders. However, in his book Heavy Duty Nutrition, Mentzer demonstrated that nutrition for athletes did not need to be nearly as extreme as the bodybuilding industry would lead one to believe. His recommended diets were well balanced, and he espoused eating from all four food groups, totaling four servings each of high-quality grains and fruits, and two each of dairy and protein daily, all year-round. Mentzer believed that carbohydrates should make up the bulk of the caloric intake, 50‚Äì60%, rather than protein as others preferred. Mentzer's reasoning was simple: to build 10 pounds of muscle in a year, a total of 6000 extra calories needed to be ingested throughout the year, because one pound of muscle contains 600 calories. That averages 16 extra calories per day, and only four of them needed to be from protein‚Äîbecause muscle is 22% protein, about one quarter.Mike Mentzer ‚Äì Heavy Duty Nutrition Mentzer's heavy-duty training system While Mike Mentzer served in the US Air Force, he worked 12-hour shifts, and then followed that up with 'marathon workouts' as was the accepted standard in those days. In his first bodybuilding contest, he met the winner, Casey Viator. Mentzer learned that Viator trained in very high intensity (heavy weights for as many repetitions as possible, to total muscle fatigue), for very brief (20‚Äì45 minutes per session) and infrequent training sessions. Mentzer also learned that Viator almost exclusively worked out with the relatively new Nautilus machines, created and marketed by Arthur Jones in DeLand, Florida. Mentzer and Jones soon met and became friends.The New High Intensity Training, Ellington Darden Jones pioneered the principles of high- intensity training in the late 1960s. He emphasized the need to maintain perfectly strict form, move the weights in a slow and controlled manner, work the muscles to complete failure (positive and negative), and avoid overtraining. Casey Viator saw fantastic results training under the direction of Jones, and Mentzer became very interested in this training philosophy. Eventually, however, Mentzer concluded that even Jones was not completely applying his own principles, so Mentzer began investigating a more full application of them. He began training clients in a near-experimental manner, evaluating the perfect number of repetitions, exercises, and days of rest to achieve maximum benefits. For more than ten years, Mentzer's Heavy Duty program involved 7‚Äì9 sets per workout on a three-day-per-week schedule. With the advent of \\"modern bodybuilding\\" (where bodybuilders became more massive than ever before) by the early 1990s, he ultimately modified that routine until there were fewer working sets and more days of rest. His first breakthrough became known as the 'Ideal (Principled) Routine', which was a fantastic step in minimal training. Outlined in High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way, fewer than five working sets were performed each session, and rest was emphasized, calling for 4‚Äì7 days of recovery before the next workout. According to Mentzer, biologists and physiologists since the nineteenth century have known that hypertrophy is directly related to intensity, not duration, of effort (Mentzer 2003;39). Most bodybuilding and weightlifting authorities do not take into account the severe nature of the stress imposed by heavy, strenuous resistance exercise carried to the point of positive muscular failure. Mentzer's training courses (books and audio tapes), sold through bodybuilding magazines, were extremely popular, beginning after Mentzer won the 1978 IFBB Mr. Universe contest. This contest gathered a lot of attention, because at it he became the first bodybuilder ever to receive a perfect 300 score from the judges. Some time later, Mentzer attracted more attention when he introduced Dorian Yates to high-intensity training, and put him through his first series of workouts in the early '90s. Yates went on to win the Mr. Olympia six consecutive times, from 1992 to 1997.

Years later, Mike said that his father \\"unwittingly ... was inculcating in me an appreciation of capitalism.\\" According to David M. Sears, a friend of Mentzer and an editor and publisher of his Muscles in Minutes book, he stated that: Regarding what he learned from Ayn Rand, Mentzer said in an interview: In his last interview before his death, Mentzer said he was delighted to get so many phone clients and close personal bodybuilding friends, such as Markus Reinhardt, who had been influenced by him to become Objectivists. He described Objectivism as the best philosophy ever devised. He also criticized the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, which he described as an \\"evil philosophy,\\" because according to him Kant set out to destroy man's mind by undercutting his confidence in reason. He also criticized the teaching of Kantianism in schools and universities and said it's very difficult for an Objectivist philosopher with a PhD to get a job in any of the universities. Final years and death In the late '80s, Mentzer returned to training bodybuilders and writing for Iron Man magazine and spent much of the 1990s regaining his stature in the bodybuilding industry. Mike had met Dorian Yates in the 1980s and made an impression on Dorian's bodybuilding career. Years later when Yates won Joe Weider's \\"Mr. Olympia\\", he credited Mike's \\"Heavy Duty\\" principles for his training. Mike, his brother Ray, and Dorian formed a clothing company called \\"MYM\\" for Mentzer Yates Mentzer, also known as \\"Heavy Duty Inc\\", in 1994. MYM was based on the success of Don Smith's \\"CrazeeWear\\" bodybuilding apparel. The three principals wanted to capitalize on the physically fit lifestyle, which today has gone mainstream. With the blessing and promotion of Joe Weider, the trio manufactured and distributed their own line of cut-and- sew sportswear. Mentzer died on June 10, 2001 in Rolling Hills, California. He was found dead in his apartment, due to heart complications, by his younger brother and fellow bodybuilder Ray Mentzer. Two days later, Ray died from complications from his long battle with Berger's disease.

It is located due west of West Seattle and is connected to Seattle and Vashon Island via the Washington State Ferries run to Southworth. It is named after Port Orchard, the strait that separates Bainbridge Island from the Kitsap Peninsula. As of the 2010 census the population was 11,144, and in 2019 the population was an estimated 14,597. History The first European-Americans to settle in what is now Port Orchard were William Renton and Daniel Howard, who set up a sawmill there in 1854. The town that was to become Port Orchard was originally platted in 1886 by Frederick Stevens, who named the new location after his father, Sidney. The town of Sidney was incorporated September 15, 1890, and was the first in Kitsap County to be both platted and incorporated. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Navy sought a suitable location for another installation on the West Coast, and found it with the assistance of Sidney's residents in Orchard Bay (this installation would later become the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton). The county seat was originally in Port Madison, but moved to Sidney after a popular vote in 1892. In December of that same year, the residents of Sidney petitioned both the state legislature and the Post Office Department to rename the city \\"Port Orchard\\". The legislature refused, as Charleston (now West Bremerton) had also requested that name. The Post Office Department, however, went through with the name change, and as a result the Port Orchard post office ended up in Sidney, and the Charleston post office ended up in Port Orchard. It wasn't until 1903 that local politician Will Thompson convinced the state legislature to correct this confusing situation, and relocated the Charleston post office to Charleston, at the same time renaming Sidney \\"Port Orchard\\", as it is known today. 2018 tornado On December 18, 2018, a cul-de-sac in Port Orchard was struck by an EF-2 tornado with winds between , the strongest tornado in Washington since 1986.

It is the smallest of the four cities in Kitsap County. The population was 9,200 at the 2010 census and an estimated 10,927 in 2018. The area was historically inhabited by the Suquamish people, many of whom moved to the Port Madison Indian Reservation after the signing of the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855. Poulsbo was founded in the 1880s by Norwegian immigrant J√∏rgen Eliason, who was joined by other Scandinavians who relocated from the Midwestern states. They were drawn here by the availability of land, by the area's rich resources, and by a landscape similar to their native home. The settlement was connected by boats to other areas of the region, including the Puget Sound mosquito fleet, which was eventually usurped by highways built in the early 20th century. Modern-day downtown Poulsbo maintains a Scandinavian theme to honor its early immigrant history and is a popular regional tourist destination. One of its local products, Poulsbo Bread, is made locally at Sluys Bakery and used to be sold internationally. Many visitors arrive by boat; there are three marinas near the town, and the town's harbor is an excellent anchorage. History First Lutheran Church of Poulsbo The Suquamish people inhabited the area at the north end of Liberty Bay for millennia and had several names for modern-day Poulsbo; one of those names, tcu-tcu-lats, means \\"place of the maples\\". The Suquamish occupied villages on the Liberty Bay shoreline ‚Äî among them, ho-CHEEB ‚Äî for at least 5,000 years, hunted in local forests and floodplains, fished in bays and streams here, and harvested shellfish along the shoreline. After the signing of the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, most Suquamish people here relocated to the Port Madison Indian Reservation, although the Suquamish Tribe reserved ‚Äî and to this day exercises ‚Äî certain cultural and natural resource rights in its historical territory, including Poulsbo. Oyster farming in Poulsbo, 1920 Founded by Norwegian immigrant J√∏rgen Eliason in the 1880s, Poulsbo was settled in its early years by a large number of Norwegian and other Scandinavian immigrants because of its similarities to their native countries. In 1886, I.B. Moe, one of the early Norwegian settlers, suggested that the community should have a post office. Moe suggested the town be named \\"Paulsbo\\" (which translates as \\"Paul's place\\"), after the village in Halden, Norway, where Moe spent his early years. The community's petition for a post office was granted and Moe became the first postmaster, but authorities in Washington, D.C. misspelled the town's name, likely misreading Moe's handwriting, and the community became known as \\"Poulsbo\\" thereafter. Poulsbo was incorporated on December 18, 1907. Until World War II, many Poulsbo residents retained Norwegian as a primary language. However, during World War II, the military constructed about 300 residential units to provide housing for workers at the nearby Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton. The population of Poulsbo almost tripled over three years, and the diversification of the population led to the dominance of English as the primary language. On October 22, 1975, King Olav V of Norway visited Poulsbo as part of the celebration of 150 years of Norwegian immigration to the United States. His son, Harald, visited 20 years later. Schools Poulsbo is home to many different public schools in the North Kitsap School District. North Kitsap High School, Poulsbo Middle School, Poulsbo Elementary School and Vinland Elementary School are located within the city limits, while Pearson Elementary School lies south of town.

The population was 1,872 at the 2010 census. About by car from Seattle, Cle Elum is a popular area for camping and outdoor activities. History=Early years and industries Some assert that the selection of the Stampede Pass was determined by the coal discovery. In the spring of 1886 the railroad engineers under Mr. Virgil Bogue and Mr. Herbert Huson were making their survey through the region with the intent of establishing a station. At the site of the future city, a Northern Pacific Railway station was named Clealum after the Kittitas name Tle-el-Lum (tliell…ôm), meaning \\"swift water\\", referring to the Cle Elum River. In 1908, Clealum was altered to Cle Elum. The name was given to the river, the city, and Cle Elum Lake. Walter Reed entered into a partnership with Thomas Johnson of Ellensburg and laid out sixty-five acres as a site. This was legally dedicated on July 26, 1886. Mr. Johnson had owned a sawmill on Wilson Creek, in Grant County and he moved the mill to the new location in the vicinity of the new town. The partners, Reed and Johnson, established what was undoubtedly the largest mill up to that time in central or Eastern Washington, cutting 40,000 feet of board lumber per day. At the same time, Frederick Leonhard, who, with his brother-in-law, Gerrit d'Ablaing, had been carrying on a mill on Cooke Creek and later on the Naneum, moved to the vicinity of Cle Elum. They cut a large part of the lumber for the Stampede Tunnel. The early 20th century Cle Elum was officially incorporated on February 12, 1902. Tragedy struck the area when on July 16, 1908, two carloads of blasting powder being unloaded by the Northwest Improvement Company exploded, killing at least nine people including miners, NIC store employees and a family with children living in a tent near the building. The explosion, located about three-quarters of a mile from Cle Elum's downtown, scattered debris and human remains and shattered windows across town. Accounts from residents equated the explosion to an earthquake.\\"Powder Blows Bodies to Bits; Magazine explodes near Cle Elum Wash. The Oregonian 17 July 1908. In December 1910, loggers working for the Cascade Lumber Company near Cle Elum went on strike after the company reduced pay and began charging $5 per week for board. () In 1913, steps were taken to improve automobile access across the Cascade Mountains via Snoqualmie Pass. A $1,500,000 levy () was approved in 1913 to improve and expand the state's highways. The majority of the levy ($590,743) went to construction of the Sunset Highway between Spokane and Seattle. This major cross-state highway would pass directly through Cle Elum's business district, and as it was one of the first towns reached after traveling east across the pass, would greatly benefit from its construction.\\"Good Roads O.

Great fire of 1918 Cle Elum's greatest disaster occurred on June 25, 1918, when a huge fire wiped out over seventy acres of the city (29 city blocks) causing over $500,000 (about $ today) in damages. The cause was later determined to most likely to be a cigarette butt thrown into a pile of garbage behind a theater. Thirty businesses and 205 houses were destroyed, leaving more than 1,800 people homeless. Following the incident, aid from across the state began pouring in. The Red Cross brought tents from Camp Lewis to house displaced citizens while soldiers were sent from Ellensburg to guard businesses. Yakima and Portland also sent aid to the city. No lives were lost in the incident.\\"City Of Tents Is Rising American Red Cross Sends Shelters From Camp Lewis\\" The Oregonian 28 Jun. 1918.

Most anthropologists and historians concede that each interpretation has some validity depending upon the particular dialect spoken.\\" History Kittitas was established in 1883 and officially incorporated on December 9, 1931. It was founded as part of the westward expansion of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. The Kittitas Yard and Depot became the center of the community of Kittitas, one of the many small, agricultural towns that sprang up along the railroad lines. The railroad linked Kittitas to other small communities and the rest of the country, providing farmers and business people a way to sell their products in other towns and cities. A post office, general merchandise and drug store, a Baptist church, agricultural warehouses, and other small businesses were built around the small depot. Along with the depot, the Kittitas Yard included storage and maintenance buildings, a water tower, and other structures necessary for the maintenance of a major transcontinental railroad. The depot is the only significant structure still intact at the Kittitas Yard. It is an excellent example of turn-of-the-century railroad architecture, and as such was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The depot is owned and managed by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission. The Olympian or The Columbian. The Milwaukee Road, the popular name for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad, was founded in 1847 to serve the area from Mississippi to Wisconsin. Within 50 years, it became one of the most prosperous railroads in the country. In 1905, Milwaukee Road officials began expanding west, running lines from Chicago to Seattle. At the same time, they decided to electrify the lines through the western mountains, to increase operating efficiency. Despite the increased efficiency, the financial stability of the railroad began to crumble, prompted by the high cost of the western expansion, electrical expenses, and competition with other railroads and ships using the newly opened Panama Canal. In 1980, the last Milwaukee train traveled over the Cascades, and thereafter the system served only the Midwest. The Milwaukee Road once served as a vital link, providing economic and social connections between small, scattered communities in Washington. Today, it is once more a link between these communities, for people who hike, bike, or ride horses along the route.

Much of the town's history is preserved, and its downtown was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History Immaculate Conception Church is featured in the 1979 film The Runner Stumbles, starring Dick Van Dyke and Kathleen Quinlan. Early history Coal deposits were first noted in the Roslyn area in 1883, with a large vein discovered at the upper Smith Creek canyon in 1885 by C.P. Brosious, Walter J. Reed, and Ignatius A. Navarre. Roslyn was platted in 1886 by Logan M. Bullet, vice president of the Northern Pacific Coal Company, at the time that the company initiated the first commercial coal mining operations there, to support railway operations.Goodloe, Trevor. \\"Roslyn, Washington (1886-- )\\". BlackPast.org. Retrieved 2018-01-19. Throughout the mid-1880s, the Northern Pacific Railway, the parent of Northern Pacific Coal Company, pushed from the east to reach Puget Sound across the Cascade Mountains. The Northern Pacific began building across Stampede Pass just west of Roslyn, approaching from Wallula in the east and Tacoma in the west. A 77-mile (124-km) gap remained in 1886. In January of that year, Nelson Bennett was given a contract to construct a 9,850 foot (3,002 m) tunnel under Stampede Pass, completing it in 1888. Roslyn, which lies on the route to Stampede Pass, provided the coal for the railway construction work as well as the continuing railroad operations. Between 1886 and 1929, immigrant workers from countries such as Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Germany, Lithuania, Slovenia, Serbia and Croatia as well as from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales came to work in the mines. These immigrants maintained the traditions of their homelands, as seen in the historic Roslyn Cemetery, with its 26 sections for distinct ethnic and lodge cemetery areas. Many Roslyn residents today are descendants of these immigrant miners. Roslyn's peak coal mine production of nearly 2 million tons was reached in 1910. As coal-fired steam trains were being replaced by diesel power, the mines began to shut down in the 1920s. Although the local coal mines were far from played out (approximately 80% of the coal in the Roslyn mines remains unextracted), the last mine in the area closed in 1963 as business became unprofitable. With the loss of jobs, an exodus of residents ensued. In the mid-1970s, Roslyn began to flourish again as artists and others rehabilitated the town's houses and commercial buildings and settled there. Some individuals own second homes in Roslyn, while working and living full- time in Seattle or Tacoma, for instance. As Roslyn was a \\"company town\\", life in the early years was centered around the production of coal. Most of the citizens of the town worked either for the Northern Pacific Coal Company or in one of the smaller businesses monopolized by the company, or were family members of someone who did. A hub of life in the town was the Northwestern Improvement Company Store, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it still stands at the corner of First Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. Like many 19th-century American towns and cities, where risk of fires was high, Roslyn had a major fire in 1888, which destroyed most of its commercial district. Many buildings constructed after the fire used fire-resistant brick and sandstone. Some of these historic structures are still in use, including the 1889 Brick Tavern and the circa-1890 Fischer Building. During its days of prosperity, the Northern Pacific Coal Company built the Roslyn Athletic Club for miners and their families. It was completed in 1902 and contained a gym, meeting rooms, and a bowling alley. Roslyn's public library, which was founded in 1898, moved into the Roslyn Athletic Club building in 1918. It continues to serve the community from this location. Most of the town's 500 homes were built in the 1920s on land owned by the railroad. The 1920s-era commercial district consisted of four square blocks, of which about one dozen buildings remain as representatives of western frontier commercial architecture. Roslyn has many examples of Victorian elegance in its surviving buildings, as well as simple miner's shacks. The town of Roslyn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Recently, Roslyn became a Certified Local Government. Its Historic Preservation Commission restored the Roslyn Cafe, a local landmark. Roslyn's railroad tracks have been removed and replaced by the Coal Mines Trail which runs from Cle Elum through Roslyn to Ronald. A walk on the trail affords visitors a look at the remains of Roslyn's mines and railroad depot site. The Roslyn Museum houses an extensive collection of photos and mining memorabilia, and features an exhibit on Roslyn's unique ethnic cemeteries. Most recently, recreation and tourism have become the chief drivers of the economy. The business community has worked to bring in more visitors through annual festivals, including the Manly Man Festival in June, the Pioneer Days Picnic, and a Coal Mining Festival associated with Coal Mining History Week each August. Knights of Labor Strike of 1888 and African American migration The Brick Tavern is the oldest continuously operating tavern in the state, and was featured prominently in Northern Exposure (1990 to 1995). Roslyn was used as the site for filming the fictitious town of Cicely, Alaska, in the hit CBS television series. Tensions between management and labor in the Roslyn mines began spilling over in the summer of 1888, when management laid off a number of labor union workers who were petitioning for eight-hour work days and higher wages. These layoffs led to a labor strike by the Knights of Labor, which shut down the mines. Northwest Coal Company, which conducted mining operations at Mine No. 3, a few miles away in nearby Ronald, responded by recruiting strikebreakers. This included 50 black laborers from the East and Midwest who were transported by train with almost 40 private armed guards. The recruitment of these armed forces raised the interest of Territorial Governor Eugene Semple when he heard that they harassed area residents calling themselves U.S. Marshals. This was considered a paramilitary challenge to Washington Territory authority and Semple ordered the local sheriff to disperse the unit. Semple visited Roslyn to investigate Northwest Coal Company's practices and condemned the company for hiring a private militia on suppositions that the white strikers would attack black laborers and overpower police forces. Semple's report describes the residents as \\"intelligent\\" and \\"law-abiding,\\" and the company's suppositions as erroneous. He did not intervene on the labor disputes, and strikers continued to lose ground in negotiations. In a span of two years, the company recruited more than 300 black laborers from Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky. Many relocated with families, and this migration was the largest increase in the African-American population of Washington Territory up until that time. Sheriff Packwood of Kittitas County reported to Semple that relations between out-of-work white workers and the black population were strained with potential to turn violent. However, after the strike broke tensions reduced, and whites reconciled with working along black miners. As the regional coal industry boomed, competition for employment reduced, and eventually workers organized as equals with United Mine Workers. The Coal Miners' Memorial in Roslyn. Note the radio station film set from the Northern Exposure television series in the background. Mine accident of 1892 In 1892, 45 miners were killed in an explosion at Mine No. 1 near Roslyn, the deadliest mining accident in Washington history. 1892 Ben E. Snipes and Co. bank robbery On September 24, 1892, a group of five bandits, known criminals and affiliates of Butch Cassidy, held up the Roslyn branch of the Ellensburg-based Ben Snipes Bank. Two of the men stood guard with the horses while the other three went inside. One of the men approached the cashier asking for what ever was in the already open vault. The other two men kept the customers in the store quiet, one of them was Dr. Lyon who would later be murdered and the case never solved. The five men rode away with $5,000 or $10,000, depending on the source. It is thought that the men were expecting the coal miner's pay, $40,000 coming from Tacoma, would have been held in the bank. However, the money was sent directly to the coal company. The sheriff and his posse soon chased after the men and into the hills of Teanaway. In November 1892, three men were brought into the jail and were asked to be identified by the witnesses of the robbery. Cal, Kimize, and Zachary Hale were taken in and arrested. Cal was the only one of the three men to be charged and found guilty of the crime. A couple of months later, the Kittitas County Courts, received a letter from Utah, telling them that they had convicted the wrong man. Cal Hale was set free and the search for Tom, George, William and Fred McCarthy, as well as Ras Lewis (alias Ras Christiansen and Matt Warner). In April 1893, a posse traveled down into Oregon looking for these bandits. George and William went with the men without a fight. Tom, Fred and Ras took off and were soon lost. Later that month the Yakima County Attorney received a letter from Rosa Lewis, Ras Lewis' wife, stating that she knew that the men had done it and she was tired of her husbands battle with the law. Soon after the Sheriff and his posse went to the cabin at the \\"7 U Ranch\\", owned by Fred Beezley, that Ras and his wife were leasing. All five men were eventually taken into custody and tried. George and Ras attempted to break free and ran around the city of Ellensburg until the sheriff was able to detain them. There were two separate trials that would take place. This first was dismissed due to being a mistrial and the second one ending without any answers. It is rumored that the lawyer simply asked the men to tell them where the money had been stored. Court records state that they simply did not have witnesses that were able to testify. The trials and all other fees associated with bringing justice to the county nearly bankrupted Kittitas County. Ras Lewis changed his name to Matt Warner, he was involved in a shoot out in 1895 and was arrested, serving 4 years. After that he became a Justice of the Peace and Sheriff of Price, Utah until his death in 1938. Several of the McCartys were later killed during an attempted bank robbery in Colorado.  African American population  In 1890, Roslyn's African American population was 22%, one of the highest in the state. Black fraternal organization lodges and civic institutions were established, including Prince Hall Masons, Knights of Pythias, Eastern Star, Daughters of Tabernacle, and African Methodist Episcopal Church. The Black population began to decline after the mines closed in 1963, and by the early 1970s only the Craven family remained. William Craven was elected mayor of Roslyn in 1976, and was the first African American mayor in the state of Washington. The Roslyn Black Pioneers was established by Ethel Florence Craven to preserve and promote black history in Washington. The organization received a grant from Humanities Washington to build educational floats for Washington parades. Roslyn's ethnic cemeteries Roslyn's historic cemetery is divided into 26 ethnic plots like the one depicted here. The Roslyn Cemetery is composed of 26 separate but adjacent cemetery plots, reflecting the diversity of early immigrant society. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Clustered on of woods and hills above the town's main street, the land was donated by or purchased from the Northern Pacific Company by fraternal, ethnic and civic organizations for burial of their deceased members. The Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF), Knights of Pythias Lodge, Soloka Lodge, Wanapum Tribe 28, Improved Order of Redmen, Cacciatori d‚ÄôAfrica (literally Hunters of Africa ‚Äì an Italian lodge), Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge No. 56, SNF Lodge No. 79 (Serbian), St. Barbara Lodge No. 39 (Greek Catholic), and Dr. David Starcevich Lodge No. 56 (Croatian) are among the organizations and ethnicities represented at the cemetery. At least 24 nationalities are represented among the nearly 5,000 graves. Post mining era Lake Cle Elum near Roslyn is a year-round recreational destination. Although Roslyn clings to its coal mining and timber harvesting past, it has become a tourist and recreation destination. Tourism to the town received a boost when it was feature as the filming location for The Runner Stumbles and Northern Exposure. The town's proximity to Seattle makes it a popular destination for recreational travelers. As many as 2,000 luxury homes are being developed nearby, potentially adding to the old town's population. Forests once owned and managed by Plum Creek Timber Company have been sold to two development companies, which are in the process of developing an extensive golf course community with houses and condominiums on the boundary of Roslyn. The new community is called Suncadia. As in similar small towns being transformed by large-scale capital projects and outside investment, these changes are expected to significantly improve Roslyn.The Economist, Volume 379, Number 8481, pp. 30-31, 10 June 2006 Roslyn's railroad tracks have been removed and replaced by the Coal Mines Trail which runs from Cle Elum through Roslyn to Ronald.

It includes the unincorporated community of Hyak. The population was 311 at the 2010 census. The CDP is named for the mountain pass that carries Interstate 90 across the Cascade Range, which itself is named for the Snoqualmie tribe, a Native American tribe indigenous to the Snoqualmie Valley located west of the pass. The portion of the mountain pass west of the height of land, in King County, is not part of the Snoqualmie Pass CDP. Based on per capita income, Snoqualmie Pass ranks 8th of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked. It is also the highest rank achieved in Kittitas County.  Recreation  The area consists of mountain chalets and condominiums that are mainly seasonally occupied by residents of the Seattle metropolitan area, with approximately 300 year-round residents. Winter sports are the main draw, but outdoor recreation is available year-round. The Pacific Crest Trail crosses through Snoqualmie Pass, and a variety of other trails are also available for hiking and climbing in the summer and cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the winter. Snoqualmie Pass is the site of the Summit at Snoqualmie, a group of alpine ski areas managed by Boyne USA Resorts. The Summit consists of four ski areas: Alpental, Summit West (formerly named Snoqualmie Summit), Summit Central (formerly Ski Acres), and Summit East (formerly Hyak). The Summit at Snoqualmie is the closest ski area to Seattle, so it is often crowded on weekends. Iron Horse State Park in Hyak offers groomed cross-country ski trails, sledding and snowshoeing in winter and hiking and a gravel railroad bed for hiking and bicycling in the summer.https://parks.state.wa.us/521/Iron-Horse Snowmobiling just east of the pass is also popular during the winter months. Also in the summer and fall, paragliders and hang gliders may be seen flying above the valley, along the ridge and landing at Lake Keechelus. Geography Location of Snoqualmie Pass, Washington The community is in westernmost Kittitas County, on the east side of Snoqualmie Pass. Its western border follows the King County border, which is also the height of land of the Cascade Range. The CDP extends southeast as far as Keechelus Lake, the source of the Yakima River. The unincorporated community of Hyak is in the southeast part of the CDP. Interstate 90 passes through the community, with access from Exits 53 and 54. I-90 leads west to Seattle and southeast the same distance to Ellensburg, the Kittitas county seat. Washington State Route 906 serves as a local main road through the Snoqualmie Pass community, connecting with I-90 at both of its exits. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Snoqualmie Pass CDP has a total area of , all of it land. Situated at a main crossing point of the Cascade Range, Snoqualmie Pass is located along the Mountains to Sound Greenway, which spans parts of King and Kittitas counties. The eastern portal of the Snoqualmie Tunnel is in the CDP at Hyak. Climate Due to its elevation, Snoqualmie Pass experiences significantly lower temperatures than Seattle, and receives much more precipitation, much of it being snow. Snoqualmie Pass has a humid continental climate (Koppen: Dfb) with cold, very wet and snowy winters, and mild to warm, relatively dry summers.

The population was 74 at the 2010 census. History The area around Vantage has been occupied by the Wanapum Native Americans since prehistory. A number of well-preserved rock-paintings have been found on the cliff walls. They also used the abundant petrified wood in the area for arrowheads and other tools. The site where these petroglyphs were found was inundated by the rising waters behind Wanapum Dam in the 1960s. About 60 of the more than 300 carvings were cut from the basalt cliff face and saved.http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=7396 The nearby Ginkgo Petrified Forest site is one of the most unusual fossil forests in the world, and was designated a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1965.http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=7484 In the early part of the 20th century, residents in nearby Ellensburg needed a more direct route when traveling east. So in 1914, a car ferry was established to carry traffic across the Columbia River at Vantage. This ferry was really just a small barge with wooden ramps at either end, and could carry only two cars at a time across the river. After several cars (some with occupants still in them) were lost overboard from the tiny ferry, the State Highway Department decided to construct a bridge over the Columbia.http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=5373 In 1927, the 1640-foot bridge was opened at Vantage. This was an important link in the Sunset Highway, the major east-west thoroughfare in Washington State at the time (now I-90). The construction of the bridge required workers to enter pressurized caissons 70 feet under the riverbed via airlocks. Some workers became seriously ill from the effects of the pressure. Once completed, the bridge had a 70-foot clearance on the center span, allowing for river traffic to pass under the bridge. This cantilever bridge served until 1962, when it was replaced with the current bridge. The original bridge was dismantled, and moved to the crossing at Lyons Ferry, where it still stands today as the oldest extant steel cantilever bridge in Washington, and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. With completion of the Wanapum Dam in the early 1960s, the townsite was relocated further up the hill above the rising water to the current location.

Bickle, who established a trading post and livery stable at the site. He also served as the area's first postmaster. In 1879, the town was named after Bickle. The town's economy was initially based largely on cattle ranching and wheat farming. A series of fires in 1937 and 1947 destroyed many of the town's original buildings. The oldest surviving building in Bickleton is the Bluebird Inn, a tavern which first opened in 1882. It is billed as the oldest functioning tavern in the state, although it has changed ownership numerous times and operated under different names throughout its history.The Brick Tavern in Roslyn claims the title of the oldest continuously operating tavern in the state of Washington, opening in 1889 and operating under a single name since 1898. The Bluebird Inn, according to its owners, is the state's oldest functioning tavern, having first opened in 1882; however, it has operated under numerous names and has not been continuously licensed to operate since its founding. The tavern includes a 1903 Brunswick pool table, which is still used by regulars. The town has held an annual picnic and rodeo continuously since 1910. The festival also features a 1905 Herschell-Spillman carousel, which the town purchased from Oaks Amusement Park in Portland, Oregon, in 1928.

Although the Wishrams were included in the Treaty of Yakima, they resisted removal to the Yakama Reservation. Indian burials from Memaloose Island in the Columbia were removed to the Wish-ham Cemetery near Dallesport prior to the filling of Lake Celilo. The loss of their traditional fishing grounds at Celilo Falls during the construction of The Dalles Dam in March 1957 dealt both a spiritual and an economic blow to the tribe.http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=7800 Originally called \\"Rockport\\" or \\"Rockland Flats\\", Dallesport was the site of the first ferry crossing in the area, beginning in 1854. Rockland Flats was the original seat of Clickitat County (the name of the county was spelled with a \\"C\\" until an official name change in 1869), and remained so until 1878. Riverboat traffic moved up and down the river, but could not pass the falls at the Dalles and Celilo Falls. Portage was originally via a wagon road circumventing the falls. The Oregon Portage Railroad allowed passage of goods and travelers by rail beginning in 1863, but shippers chafed at the monopoly. In 1905, Congress approved an canal with locks on the north shore to bypass the falls. The Dalles-Celilo Canal opened May 5, 1915. The canal incorporated five locks with a total lift.

His home at Columbus Street and Collins Street remains standing in downtown Goldendale. The town was designated as the county seat of Klickitat County in 1878. Goldendale was officially incorporated on November 14, 1879. Much of the young town, including the county courthouse, was destroyed in a devastating fire on May 13, 1888. On June 9, 1918, William Wallace Campbell, director of the Lick Observatory, and astronomer Heber Curtis journeyed to Goldendale to view a total solar eclipse. The purpose of the observation was to photograph the sun's corona and the apparent distorted placement of stars due to the sun's gravitational pull on those star's rays while passing by the sun. Lacking proper equipment and instead only using multiple cameras Campbell and Curtis were unable to confirm stars' deflection. However, by November 1919, their efforts would be vindicated by British astronomers and Einstein's Theory of Relativity was confirmed.Campbell, W.W. \\"Clouds Fall Away For Solar Eclipse\\", \\"The New York Times\\", June 10, 1918, accessed December 2, 2010.Crelinsten, Jeffrey. \\"Einstein's Jury: The Race to Test Relativity\\". Princeton University Press, 2006. Goldendale was also under the path of totality for another total eclipse on February 26, 1979, which drew thousands of visitors to the Goldendale Observatory. In 2008 Goldendale hosted the International Gravity Sports Association's 'Festival of Speed,' on a segment of the historic Maryhill highway.IGSA Homepage Goldendale has remained the employment, business, commercial and banking center for the valley and, as the county seat, is the location for Klickitat County's courts and government offices. In recent years this small community has suffered from severe economic decline. After a local aluminum plant that once employed many residents closed, the small community struggled economically. The loss of tax base has taken its toll on the funds available for maintaining the city's infrastructure. In recent years there has been an interest in installing wind turbines that would generate power. While it has provided some jobs, this industry has not been the economic solution for which many residents hoped. Geography Main Street, Goldendale Goldendale is located at (45.821, -120.821). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Goldendale's elevation at the County Courthouse is . The Little Klickitat River flows roughly east-to-west across the northern portion of the city. Bloodgood Creek, an entirely spring-fed year-round water source, runs through the northwest part of town and intersects with the Little Klickitat just west of the city. Both are sources of rainbow trout as well as being home to waterfowl such as the great blue heron and several species of duck. Bloodgood Creek provides a portion of Goldendale's drinking water and is capped at the source for that purpose. U.S. Route 97 runs along the eastern boundary of the city and connects Goldendale with Interstate 84, south in the state of Oregon and State Route 14, which is south and runs along the Washington side of the Columbia River. State Route 142 creates a major east- west route through Goldendale, beginning at US 97 on the north end of town. Climate Goldendale has a continental Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen Dsb). The rain shadow of the Cascades creates distinct and visible difference between the arid and dry areas south of the community, and the more lush treed areas to the north. This produces a landscape of open bunch-grass prairies dotted with sagebrush and rabbit brush containing the occasional juniper tree, while the more sheltered areas consist of ponderosa pine and oak savannahs. Overcast days are rare, occurring mostly in late fall and throughout winter. Summer temperatures can reach well over , while winter, when most of the annual precipitation of around occurs, can see temperatures below , particularly in January. Summer thunderstorms occur intermittently, particularly in July and August, but due to high cloud bases, rain seldom reaches the ground in any appreciable amount. Lightning-caused range and forest fires are a common occurrence during this time of year. Spring flowers and green meadows and prairies make Goldendale a particularly beautiful site. Spring and summer can be very blustery since the Chinook winds off the Pacific Ocean are funneled through the Columbia Gorge. Fall tends to be almost windless, and the autumnal oak leaves add a lovely touch of golden rust red to Observatory Hill on the north side of town.

Industry The Klickitat County Court House A lumber mill and logging used to be major industries in the area but have since ceased to exist. Timber cutting, ranching, farming, agriculture are still key industries in the area, but have seen some hard times over the years. Many farms are being sold off and developed by local and non-local investors. Once beautiful farmland is now divided up into residential tracts. Industrial Plant A closed aluminum processing plant had a big economic impact for 35 years and continues to impact the area as pensioners still draw benefits from the decades of operations. The John Day area aluminum reduction plant was built by Harvey Aluminum (later Martin Marietta, forerunner to conglomerate Lockheed Martin) at an industrial site adjacent to the John Day Dam in 1968. The industrial development and resulting jobs brought an era of growth and prosperity to Goldendale for 35 years, which brought the area new levels of prosperity from the high paying industrial jobs with significant benefits. This plant added payroll strength and diversity of the timber- and agricultural-based Goldendale area economy. Many area residents still enjoy pension and healthcare benefits from the 35 years of the industrial operations. The aluminum facility with 3 shifts of employment at its peak in the '70s and '80s was employing about 1,400‚Äì1,800 people and about 800 in the years from 1990 to 2003. The facility had been awarded a large allotment of low cost power from the hydro electric dam system that was nearby, with the assumption this would encourage industrial development and create jobs and resulting economic development. In 2003, the aluminum smelter closed operations. Reasons cited were high electricity costs and low world prices for aluminum. Many of the workers moved while others remained while they went back to school and retrained for other occupations. The closing of the aluminum plant caused serious economic stress in the area. At this time Rabanco Regional Disposal is the largest single employer of residents in the Goldendale area. Culture Aerial view of Goldendale from the northeast, 2015 Goldendale has many annual civic activities including the Klickitat County Fair & Rodeo, the Goldendale Community Days, held on the Goldendale Courthouse lawn, and holiday parades. Tourism Goldendale's tourist attractions include the Goldendale Observatory, the nearby Maryhill MuseumMaryhill Museum Homepage with a collection of 87 works by Auguste Rodin & a contemporary architectural construction by Portland-based firm Allied Works Architecture, and the Maryhill Stonehenge, a life-size cement replica of the original Stonehenge,Washington State Legends \\"An American Stonehenge in Maryhill\\" situated ten minutes south of Goldendale. The replica, completed in 1930, is a memorial of those who died in World War I. In downtown Goldendale, the Presby Mansion, now the Presby Museum, is also a tourist attraction featuring a newly restored 1898 Russel Steam Tractor and housing the Klickitat County Historical Society.Presby Museum Homepage Media The town has a weekly newspaper, the Goldendale Sentinel, which is published on Wednesdays and has a readership of approximately 3,200 subscribers across Klickitat County. It was established in 1879 as the Klickitat Sentinel and absorbed several rival newspapers in Goldendale and the county by the mid-1910s. The newspaper remains locally owned by its publisher.

History  The site where the town is located was originally called \\"Wrights\\" after one of the original settlers. This was the name given to the rail stop there. The rail stop down the river at milepost 7.2 was named \\"Klickitat\\", and the railroad later switched the two signs when the carbonated beverage company Klickitat Pop (operating near the town) gained fame. On February 7, 1910, the name of the town post office was officially changed to \\"Klickitat\\".Niels, Selma. So This Is Klickitat (1967) [p. 62] The first non-native settlers arrived in 1890 seeking land to homestead. The abundance of timber drew in other settlers during the early 1900s. Travel through the Klickitat canyon and up to the plateau was arduous until the completion of a rail line in 1903.[4, p. 47] The rail line eased travel and facilitated the transportation of people, crops, livestock and timber. The lumber mill was the primary employer in town, with the first major mill formed 1909, until 1994 when the mill was permanently closed.http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=7800 The naturally carbonated Klickitat Mineral Springs just east of town gave rise to health spas, a carbonated beverage company, and a large dry ice plant which operated until 1957.https://web.archive.org/web/20120305024600/http://www.walkaboutmag.com/19footpaths.html  Recreation  The area surrounding the town of Klickitat and the river which shares its name are renowned for their seasonal hunting and fishing. During summer, popular activities on the Klickitat River include recreational drift boating, kayaking, and rafting. Paths and trails provide opportunities for scenic hikes. The Klickitat Trail is on the route of the former railroad tracks, now a biking and hiking trail. The trail follows the Klickitat River north from the Columbia River past the town of Klickitat.http://www.klickitat- trail.org/ Washington State Route 142 provides a scenic drive through the canyon.

The population was 499 at the 2010 census.  History  Established around 1859, the community was originally called \\"Klickitat Landing\\". The first European settler was Egbert French, who arrived from Ohio. In 1866, French sold his holdings to James O. Lyle from The Dalles, Oregon, who moved to the north bank of the Columbia River. A post office was soon established with Lyle as the first postmaster, and with mail delivered by steamer from the opposite shore. Steamboat operation lasted until the North Shore Railroad was completed. When the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway came to town in 1907, its line passed somewhat north of the town. The present townsite was plotted in 1909, and the older townsite became known as \\"downtown\\". In 1941 there was a small airport in Lyle. Lyle today Lyle has two main areas: that part which is built on the north bank of the Columbia River, including the \\"downtown\\", and that part which is built on the hills above the river. The downtown area has one grocery store (which is a super-sized quick-mart), two churches, a museum, a tavern, a restaurant/cafe, a gas station and vehicle repair shop, a second-hand store, an espresso stand, and a historic hotel with restaurant and bar. Other small businesses come and go, and all are located in the downtown area. Residential areas flank downtown and extend east and west. Newer residences have sprung up on the northern hill overlooking downtown, with row upon row of homes on terraces. Less than 30 years ago, there were fewer than half a dozen homes on the entire hill. Now there are dozens, all seemingly vying for the best view of the Columbia River. Prices for hillside property are high for such a small town, and are based primarily on the view. Although Lyle is more than east of Portland/Vancouver, it can be considered a bedroom community. The ease of freeway transportation on the \\"Oregon side\\" makes the commute a mere 60 minutes. The Lyle Community Schools Campus includes three independent, small, rural schools: the area's elementary, middle school and high school, which incorporate students from Dallesport and Murdock. ( east of Lyle) The campus is located at the northernmost part of town, high on the hill overlooking Lyle. The student body is small and combines with nearby towns to make up teams for some sports. Although tiny, somewhat rustic, and usually quiet, Lyle has attracted some attention because it lies very near several popular windsurfing beaches, including Doug's Beach. The area is also home to six boutique wineries: Cor Cellars, Domaine Pouillon, Jacob Williams Winery, Klickitat Canyon Winery, Tetrahedron Wines and Syncline.

History White Salmon was first settled in 1852 by Erastus Joslyn and his wife. White Salmon was officially incorporated on June 3, 1907. White Salmon was part of the home of the Klickitat Tribe, now a part of the Yakama Confederated Nations. The Klickitat Tribe sold some land to the Joslyns. They were generally Native advocates for the time. The area was thrown open on October 31, 1858 for white settlement after the Klickitat and Yakama lost the fight for their homelands in the Yakama War. Within the same year, the region was very rapidly and heavily settled by white immigrants making land claims. The Klickitat were forced to relocate to the Yakama Reservation.http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/WHQ/article/viewFile/6477/5551 White Salmon was named after the White Salmon, a now-extinct species of salmon that lived in the Columbia and surrounding area.

The population was 342 at the 2010 census, up from 213 at the 2000 census. The site of the historic Celilo Falls is nearby. The community was originally named \\"Fallbridge\\"; it was changed to \\"Wishram\\" to honor the Wishram tribe of Native Americans. The Dalles Dam, downstream on the Columbia River, was completed in 1957, and began filling Lake Celilo. The original fishing village near this location was inundated. Geography Wishram is located in southern Klickitat County, sitting on the north bank of the Columbia River at (45.661198, -120.958788). State Route 14 runs east‚Äìwest through the community, traveling west towards Vancouver and Dallesport and east towards Maryhill; it intersects with two U.S. highways that provide access to Oregon via bridges over the Columbia River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Wishram CDP has a total area of , all of it land. Geology Wishram's location results from two major geological features: the location of the Celilo Falls on the Columbia River, and the access to the Central Oregon Plateau via the Deschutes River just across the falls from Wishram. The falls not only provided early peoples a reliable source of food, but it later provided a convenient location for an easily constructed railroad bridge crossing the Columbia. The Deschutes valley just to the south of the falls provided a route for rail access to the south, and ultimately to California. Extensive erosion is visible across the river from Wishram near the mouth of the Deschutes River. Note the interstate highway along the far side of the river. Wishram lies toward the upper end of the Columbia River Gorge, which began forming as far back as the Miocene (roughly 12 - 17 million years ago), depositing thick layers of Columbia River Basalt, and continued to take shape through the Pleistocene (700,000 - 2 million years ago). During this period the Cascade Range was forming, slowly moving the Columbia River's course north to its current location. Although the river slowly eroded the land over this period of time, the most drastic changes took place at the end of the last Ice Age when the Missoula Floods cut the steep, dramatic walls that exist around Wishram today. During the flood, the water level rose to above the current level, violently eroding and exposing the layered basalt. This quick erosion left many layers of volcanic rock exposed. History Wishram as seen from above. Note the rail bridge across the Columbia River in the west and Mount Hood in the distance. Wishram railway yard with a BNSF freight train with Oregon cliffs and Mount Hood in the background. The area of Wishram was located above the head of the great Celilo Falls on the Columbia, and as a result has been populated for an extended period. For around 15,000 years, native peoples gathered to fish and exchange goods. They built wooden platforms out over the water and caught salmon with dipnets and long spears on poles as the fish swam up through the rapids and jumped over the falls. Celilo Falls and The Dalles were strategically located at the border between Chinookan and Sahaptian-speaking peoples and served as the center of an extensive trading network across the Pacific Plateau. It was noted by early explorers and historians of the area.Washington: A Guide to the Evergreen State, Federal Writers' Project - Page 397 In 1892 the U.S. government completed a set of locks to bypass Celilo Falls on the southern shore, across from Wishram. Built at a cost of $5,000,000, these locks saw limited service as much of the freight in and out of the Pacific Northwest began to travel by rail. In 1912 the unincorporated town was known as \\"Fallbridge\\", named in recognition of the southern extension of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, which crossed the Columbia on the Oregon Trunk Rail Bridge constructed on the basalt rock of Celilo Falls.Railway Age Gazette, Volume 52, March 22, 1912 Lewis and Clark Lewis and Clark mentioned the site of Wishram in their journal. In his journal for October 22, 1805, Clark recorded: > \\"below this Island on the main Stard Shore is 16 Lodges of nativs; here we > landed a fiew minits to Smoke, the lower point of one Island opposit which > heads in the mouth of Towarnehiooks River (Deschutes River) which I did not > observe until after passing these lodges about 1/2 a mile lower passed 6 > more Lodges on the Same Side and 6 miles below the upper mouth of > Towarnehiooks River the comencement of the pitch of the Great falls, opposit > on the Stard.

University of Nebraska Press, 1996 Early history The American author Washington Irving also mentioned the Native Americans resident at Wishram in his history of the Northwest titled Astoria or, Anecdotes of an Enterprise Beyond the Rocky Mountains and published in 1836. He stated: > \\"For like reason we would make especial mention of the village of Wishram, > at the head of the Long Narrows, as being a solitary instance of an > aboriginal trading mart, or emporium.

Visitors included Thomas Farnham, Hudson's Bay Company Governor Sir George Simpson, Alexander Ross, Father Pierre De Smet and Joseph Drayton's party of the Wilkes Expedition, among others. Ross reported that at Wishram the summer encampments when the salmon were running could swell to 3,000 natives. Father De Smet described it as a glorious time of rejoicing, gambling and feasting. There have been village sites at the Wishram location for millennia. Archeologists in the 1950s identified a multilevel site with centuries of waste accumulated in middens as well as petroglyphs and other indications of dense population. Most of the densely populated areas were close to the river and convenient to fishing. This lower area was flooded in 1957 by water backed up behind The Dalles Dam. The pioneer memorial raised in 1926. In 1926 a pioneer memorial was raised at Wishram/Fallbridge. Still located in its original position east of the passenger train station today, it consists of two columns of basalt bound together with iron straps and mounted on a pedestal. A bronze plaque recognizing various pioneers who have been to Wishram begins with Meriwether Lewis and ends with John C. Fremont. It originally marked the beginning of a path from that monument to Celilo Falls; that path is now covered by the backwaters from The Dalles Dam. Wishram/Fallbridge as a rail center The Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway was chartered in 1905 by James J. Hill for the purposes of connecting the two transcontinental railroads owned by him, the Northern Pacific and Great Northern, to Portland, Oregon from Spokane, Washington, in order to gain a portion of the lumber trade in Oregon, a business that at the time was dominated by E. H. Harriman's Union Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads. Construction began in 1906 under the name Portland & Seattle Railway, proceeding eastward from Vancouver, Washington. 1906 also saw the start of construction of the line between Vancouver and Portland. This railroad included the first bridge of any kind to be built across the lower Columbia River:\\"Finish Bridge Over Columbia; Steel Structure of the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railroad Completed‚ÄîLast Bolt In Yesterday\\". (June 26, 1908). The Morning Oregonian (Portland), p. 11. the bridge now known as the BNSF Railway Bridge 9.6, in Vancouver. Oregon Trunk Rail Bridge Within a year, and despite legal challenges from Harriman, who wished to block its construction, the line had been built as far as Pasco, Washington, along the Columbia River, where there was a connection with Northern Pacific lines. The first section to open was from Pasco west through Wishram to cliffs (near Maryhill), a length of , on December 15, 1907.\\"History of North Bank Road\\". (November 6, 1908). The Morning Oregonian, p. 12. Operation was extended west to Lyle, for a total of , on January 15, 1908, as construction continued on the section from there to Vancouver. The town of Wishram (then known as Fallbridge) was fortuitously situated at a location which made bridging the Columbia River relatively easy. It was possible to construct a bridge that had piers resting on normally exposed basalt rock above the waterfall during low water periods such that during periods of high water, when this stretch of the Columbia River became raging rapids, the piers supported a bridge spanning the entire flood. This bridge over Celilo Falls became known as the Oregon Trunk Rail Bridge or the fallbridge. The location of this bridge also allowed construction of rail through the Deschutes River canyon, allowing access to eastern Oregon's high desert plateau and the eastern side of the Cascade Range. As a result, the SP&S; was extended southward from Wishram toward Bend, Oregon. Hill and Harriman engaged in a head-to-head battle up the Deschutes grade, with intense competition for any advantageous routing. After the competition reached what has been described as ridiculous levels, Hariman died in 1909 and an agreement was reached that the extension was to be jointly operated with a Union Pacific subsidiary, the Oregon-Washington Railway & Navigation. This southern extension relied upon the Oregon Trunk Rail Bridge ‚Äì the \\"fall bridge\\" ‚Äì constructed just downstream of Wishram at the waterfall on the Columbia. James J. Hill inaugurated this route, driving a golden spike in Bend in 1912. Fallbridge served as a passenger terminal, roundhouse and freight switch yard for traffic into Bend. Recognizing its central location, a 300-ton automatic coaling station was erected for the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railroad at Fallbridge in 1920.Iron Age, Volume 106, p. 1716 The name was officially changed to \\"Wishram\\" in 1926. However, the name of Fallbridge continues to appear in various documents. In 1931 the official schedules for the railway used \\"Wishram (Fallbridge)\\" as the designation for the stop at Wishram.Official Guide of the Railways and Steam Navigation Lines of the United States, Porto Rico, Canada, Mexico and Cuba, 1931 The town still appears as \\"Fallbridge\\" in 1940 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers port directories,United States. Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors, United States Army Corps of Engineers, Port Series: Issue 32 and in 1941 in standard textbooks.Nichols' Standard Railroad Textbook, Railroad Textbook Co., Inc., 1941 In 1931 the SP&S; line to Bend was connected via Klamath Falls, Oregon, to Bieber, California, providing a shortcut to connect with the Western Pacific Railroad in northern California.

It is located along Interstate 5 near the midpoint between Seattle and Portland, Oregon. The city had a population of 16,336 at the 2010 census. Centralia is twinned with Chehalis, located to the south near the confluence of the Chehalis and Newaukum rivers. History In the 1850s and 1860s, Centralia's Borst Home, at the confluence of the Chehalis and Skookumchuck Rivers, was the site of a toll ferry, and the halfway stopping point for stagecoaches operating between Kalama, Washington and Tacoma. In 1850, J. G. Cochran and his wife Anna were led there via the Oregon Trail by their adopted son, George Washington, a free African-American. The family feared Washington would be forced into slavery if they stayed in Missouri after the passage of the Compromise of 1850. Cochran filed a donation land claim near the Borst Home in 1852 and was able to sell his claim to Washington for $6,000 because unlike the neighboring Oregon Territory, there was no restriction against passing legal ownership of land to African Americans in the newly formed Washington Territory. Upon hearing of the imminent arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway (NP) in 1872, Washington and his wife, Mary Jane, filed a plat for the town of Centerville, naming the streets after biblical references and offering lots for $10 each, with one lot free to buyers who built houses. Washington also donated land for a city park, a cemetery, and a Baptist church. Responding to new settlers' concern about a town in Klickitat County with the same name, the town was renamed Centralia by 1883, as suggested by a recent settler from Centralia, Illinois, and officially incorporated on February 3, 1886. The town's population boomed, then collapsed in the Panic of 1893, when the NP went bankrupt; entire city blocks were offered for as little as $50 with no takers. Washington (despite facing racial prejudice from some newcomers) made personal loans and forgave debt to keep the town afloat until the economy stabilized; the city then boomed again based on the coal, lumber and dairying industries. When Washington died in 1905, all businesses in the town closed, and 5,000 mourners attended his funeral. The boom lasted until November 11, 1919, when the infamous Centralia Massacre occurred. Spurred on by local lumber barons, American Legionnaires (many of whom had returned from WWI to find their jobs filled by pro-union members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)), used the Armistice Day parade to attack the IWW hall. Marching unarmed,https://magazine.atavist.com/the-free-and-the-brave- centralia-american-legion-wesley-everest-wobblies the Legionnaires broke from the parade and stormed the hall in an effort to bust union organizing efforts by what was seen to be a Bolshevik-inspired labor movement. IWW workers including recently returned WWI veteran Wesley Everest, stood their ground, engaged and killed four Legionnaires. Everest was captured, jailed and then brutally lynched. Other IWW members were also jailed. The event made international headlines, and coupled with similar actions in Everett, Washington and other lumber towns, stifled the American labor movement until the economic devastation of the 1930s Great Depression changed opinions about labor organizations.Wobbly War: The Centralia Story, John McClellan, The town's name was originally a reference to the town's location as the midway point between Tacoma and Kalama (which were originally the NP's Washington termini), but proved to have longevity when it became the midpoint between Seattle and Portland, Oregon as well during the development of Washington's I-5 portion of the Interstate Highway System. As extractive industries faced decline, Centralia's development refocused on freeway oriented food, lodging, retail and tourism, as well as regional shipping and warehousing facilities, leading to 60 percent growth in population over the past four decades. Economy and employment Founded as a railroad town, Centralia's economy was originally dependent on such extractive industries as coal, lumber and agriculture. At one time, five railroad lines crossed in Centralia, including the Union Pacific Railroad, Northern Pacific Railway, Milwaukee Road, Great Northern Railroad and a short line. The construction of Interstate 5 and its predecessor, U.S. Route 99, made Centralia the halfway point for motorists traveling between Seattle and Portland. The explosion of Mt. St. Helens on May 18, 1980 devastated the local lumber industry, as 12 million board feet of stockpiled lumber and 4 billion board feet of salable timber was damaged or destroyed.https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/msh/impact Unemployment surged to double digits, and the town lost most of its retail base. In 1988, London Fog opened the first factory outlet store in the Northwest, choosing the location because it was the midpoint between major northwest cities. Their success spawned the region's first factory outlet center, creating a tourist shopping destination. This led in turn to the redevelopment of the vintage downtown marketplace as an antique, art and specialty store destination. On November 28, 2006, it was announced that TransAlta Corp., the largest employer in Centralia and operator of the Centralia Coal Mine and Centralia Power Plant, would eliminate 600 high-paying coal mining jobs.Daily Olympian article Despite fears to the contrary, there has been little noticeable economic effect upon the City of Centralia as a result. Data indicates that Centralia is experiencing growth both in its light industrial areas as well as its core business district, historic downtown Centralia.Boone, Rolf. Unemployment claims dropped more than 300 from peak, report says. The Olympian. May 17, 2007.

Government and politics Centralia is a noncharter code city with a council‚Äìmanager form of government. The City Council consists of seven members with positions one through three being at-large positions. Although slightly less so than Lewis County as a whole, Centralia is conservative and leans Republican. Media Centralia's leading newspaper is The Chronicle, ranked seventeenth in the state based on weekday circulation, and serves most of Lewis County. There are also several community-based newspapers that are published bi-weekly, such as The Lewis County News and The East County Journal.

Its first classes were held in the top floor of the Centralia High School building, and classes were taught by part-time teachers who also taught high school students. The college found its beginning in large part due to the efforts of C. L. Littel, Centralia Public Schools Superintendent and Dean Frederick E. Bolton of the University of Washington School of Education. During the early years Centralia College prepared students who would later go on to enroll at the University of Washington, and a special partnership between the colleges remained in place until 1947. The following year Centralia College earned its accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. Two years later the college's first major campus building, Kemp Hall, was constructed in the heart of Centralia. The effort to expand and develop a separate campus was largely influenced by the end of World War II and the newly enacted GI Bill. This created an oversupply of new students ready to train for their careers, with limited space to do so. Just prior to this, enrollment had been shrinking, as many young Centralians and other residents of Lewis County had left to join the war effort. Prior to the war, the college's future had been in jeopardy during the Great Depression and resulting local bank closures. From approximately 1925 through the 1940s the college was primarily funded through private loans and donations from local businesses and community members, but steady funds were not always readily available. Credit for Centralia College surviving during these difficult times is in part given to Margaret Corbet, administrator, faculty member, and namesake of Corbet Hall, due to her efforts to keep the college financially afloat. Centralia College panorama Today, Centralia College is greatly expanded, both in physical plant with a campus covering several blocks and in curriculum offerings, including a full range of distribution classes for two-year AA degrees, a select few four-year degrees and a variety of technical skill sets taught at the college. Culture Seattle-based rock band Harvey Danger used Centralia as a metaphor in its song \\"Moral Centralia,\\" found on the 2005 album Little by Little. Local landmarks Centralia Timberland Library Borst Home Built in 1864 at the site of the toll ferry crossing at the confluence of the Chehalis and Skookumchuck rivers, the Borst Home fulfilled a promise by Joseph Borst to his young wife Mary to build her the finest home along the Washington extension of the Oregon Trail. The original home is open to tour as part of the large Borst Park complex along I-5 exit 82.The historic Borst family home in Centralia. Carnegie Library is located in Washington Park and was originally built in 1913 followed by a remodel in 1977‚Äì78. The building houses a large chandelier taken from the old Centralia High School. The library is now part of the Timberland Regional Library system. Centralia Square Built in 1920 by Joseph Wohleb, Washington's first professional architect, this long-time Elks Lodge was restored in 2015 to its original glory, including a 9-room boutique hotel with ballroom, two restaurants and the town's original antique mall. The building also features a mural depicting the laborer's side of the Centralia Massacre as a counterpoint to the statue commemorating the American Legionnaires slain in that incident, which stands in the Carnegie Library park across the street. The interior of Centralia Union Depot Centralia Union Depot was built in 1912 and features red brick architecture, vintage oak benches, and internal and external woodworking throughout. In 1996, restoration projects were started. They finished in 2002. The depot is currently served by Amtrak as the midpoint between stations in Kelso and Olympia. The depot is also served by connections to the Twin Transit Transportation system and is located within walking distance to Carnegie Library, Historic Fox Theater, McMenamin's Olympic Club Hotel & Theater, and Santa Lucia Coffee Company, as well as various eateries, shops and antique vendors. Fox Theater originally opened on September 5, 1930. It was built with approximately 1,200 seats over three seating levels. The first film seen by the public was Buster Keaton in Doughboys. In 1982 the theater underwent renovations and separated the main stage into three smaller screening areas. The theater closed in 1998 and was purchased by Opera Pacifica in 2004 and underwent initial stages of restoration. In 2007 the City of Centralia bought the theater and it is currently being further restored by the Historic Fox Theatre Restorations. Limited film performances began again in 2009. McMenamin's Olympic Club Hotel & Theater opened in 1908 followed by an extensive remodel in 1913. Since then much of the building has remained unchanged. The hotel hosts 27 European-style guestrooms. Each room is named after a person of interest, including Roy Gardner, a train robber caught behind the hotel in 1921. The club was originally only frequented by gentlemen but has been opened to families for many years. The theater shows second run films, musical and comedy performances, and some televised sports events. The theater has replaced theater seating with various chairs and couches throughout. The pub serves Terminator Stout, Hammerhead, Ruby and other beverages and food items. Adjoining the pub and dining area is a 6-table poolroom and snooker table that was recently rated in the top 5 for \\"Best Pool Hall in Western Washington.\\" Every April or May the Olympic Club host its annual Brewfest, where local, import and guest brews are highlighted. Public art Murals are found throughout historic downtown Centralia. Examples include murals depicting the founder of Centralia (Centerville) named George Washington, Buffalo Bill and his Wild West Show and an abstract mural depicting the 1919 Armistice Day Centralia Massacre, also known as the Wobbly War.

Amtrak train 11, the southbound Coast Starlight, is scheduled to depart Centralia at 11:45am with service to Kelso-Longview, Portland, Sacramento, Emeryville, California (with bus connection to San Francisco), and Los Angeles. Amtrak train 14, the northbound Coast Starlight, is scheduled to depart Centralia at 5:57pm daily with service to Olympia-Lacey, Tacoma and Seattle. Amtrak Cascades trains, operating as far north as Vancouver, British Columbia and as far south as Eugene, Oregon, serve Centralia several times daily in both directions. BNSF trains in Centralia's downtown rail yard and on the mainline serve local and regional shippers, but can affect the timeliness of Amtrak service and are a noisy reminder of the days of the town's heyday as the crossroads of four major railroads (Union Pacific, Milwaukee Road, Great Northern and Northern Pacific).

The population was 7,259 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Lewis County. Etymology The Native American Chehalis people described, using their language and pronunciation, a location and village in present-day Westport, Washington that translates to American English as \\"place of sand\\" or \\"shifting sand\\". Early non-native explorers of the Pacific Northwest vocalized the words as \\"Chehalis\\" and proceeded to describe the original inhabitants as such. In 1879, the town of Saundersville, Washington, named after S.S. Saunders on whose donation land claim it was founded, began to officially use the word \\"Chehalis\\" to denote its location to the Chehalis people and the Chehalis River. The translations were also fitting for the growing town due to the muddy bottomland along the Chehalis River which had long vexed stagecoach travelers on the Washington arm of the Oregon Trail between Kalama and New Market (now Tumwater). History Chehalis began as a settlement around a warehouse beside a railroad track in 1873, when the Northern Pacific Railroad built northward from Kalama to Tacoma, and ignored Claquato, then the county seat three miles to the west. After the Northern Pacific bypassed Claquato, the county seat was moved to Chehalis, leaving Claquato little more than a historical landmark. By 1874, a store was added to the warehouse, and a courthouse and several houses were constructed. Chehalis was incorporated on November 23, 1883. Logging soon began in the nearby forests. Lumber workers of Scandinavian, English, and Scots-Irish descent arrived and settled in the neighboring valleys. In 1940, the chief local industries were: dairying, poultry raising, fruit growing, milk condensing, fruit and vegetable packing, brick and tile manufacturing, coal mining, portable house manufacturing, and fern shipping. Geography According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The city straddles Interstate 5 at a point almost exactly halfway between Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon. The historic downtown and most of the city's amenities lie on the east side of the freeway, nestled at the base of a small range of forested hills. On the west side of the freeway are parks, farms, a few subdivisions developed in the hills to the west, and a centralized shopping district, the Twin City Town Center. The Chehalis‚ÄìCentralia Airport (CLS) is located immediately west of the freeway towards the northern end of the city. From numerous vantage points in the hills just west of town, one can see Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, and Mount St. Helens--weather permitting. Chehalis is a frequented stop by bicyclists while on the annual Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic. The Chehalis River winds its way through the valley in which the city resides, and is joined by a tributary, the Newaukum River. This confluence of waters, along with the intersections of tributaries and railroads within Chehalis, helped the city become known as \\"The Maple Leaf City\\". Both the Chehalis and Newaukum rivers are prone to flooding during periods of abnormally heavy or persistent rain, and the lowlands from the freeway westward are particularly susceptible to inundation. A variety of local groups, scientists, and government have organized a partnership called \\"The Chehalis Basin Strategy\\" to propose and research a combination of plans along the Chehalis River to mitigate flooding and to restore aquatic habitat for local Chinook salmon. The current proposal outlines several flood control reduction measures, including levee improvements at the local airport and a flood retention dam in Pe Ell. Climate This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 ¬∞F. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Chehalis has a warm- summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csb\\" on climate maps.

Historic buildings and sites Vernetta Smith Timberland Library The Chehalis Theater * Vernetta Smith Chehalis Timberland Library - The library is named in honor of the mother of former Chehalis resident, Orin Smith, the new library's chief donor. This library was completed in 2008 after the original Chehalis Library and Chehalis City Hall was torn down in September, 2007. Originally part of the Carnegie library movement, the first library was built in 1910 and survived a major 1949 earthquake. * Lewis County Historical Museum - The building, built and opened in 1912, was originally known as the Northern Pacific Railway Depot. The Lewis County Historical Society and Museum currently occupies the site, celebrating the storied history of Lewis County, Washington. The society \\"mobilized to save the depot\\" beginning in 1972 after the city was informed that the building would be torn down. Renovation began in 1978 and a five-day grand opening began on September 18, 1979. * Chehalis Theater - Built as a car dealership in 1923, the building was converted into a movie house and opened as such on December 7, 1938 under the name, Pix Theater. Renamed in its current form in 1954, the Chehalis Theater saw an uninterrupted run into the 1980s. From then until 2018, the theater had been used for various business ventures, and had been reopened and closed several times, with a last use of it as a movie theater in 2008. Major restoration began anew in 2016 and in 2018, a Chehalis family purchased the building while continuing the remodeling efforts. The theater has been reopened to offer \\"a variety of both performance and cinema-based entertainment\\" and displays its original Art Deco lighting. * Claquato Church - The oldest continuously used church in Washington state. * Washington Hotel - Built in 1889, with a vaudeville and movie house, named the Dream Theatre, added to its spacious first floor in 1911, the building currently houses several small businesses, including the current site of the Vintage Motorcycle Museum. A major fire in 1997 brought near demise to the structure, but a local family worked to save and restore the historic site, and were recognized for their work in 1999 by receiving a Washington State Preservation Award. Ghost signs are visible on the north side of the structure. Parks and recreation * Gail and Carolyn Shaw Aquatics Center - Opened in August, 2014, it replaced the original 1959 Chehalis Community Pool. Funds to build the center were raised primarily thru the citizens and local businesses of Chehalis, to a tune of over $2.7 million. The aquatics center has slides, water toys, a beach-entry-style pool, new fencing, concrete walkways and benches. The Chet and Henrietta Rhodes Spray Park, completed in 2007, adjoins the aquatic center, geared mostly for \\"young children‚Äôs outdoor water play\\". * Recreation Park and Penny Playground - Located in Chehalis' South Market district, the parks adjoin one another and are home to a complex of softball and youth baseball fields, picnic areas, paved walking paths, and a community center and kitchen that can be rented. A renovation on Recreation Park began in August, 2019, using monies raised from a variety of grants, local volunteer drives, and state funds. It is expected to be completed in March, 2020, with future plans to once again host softball and youth baseball tournaments, while continuing to be the home field of the W.F. West Bearcats softball team, an overall four-time state champion. Penny Playground, built originally through community initiative and fundraising in 1992 and completed in 1993, is currently under a new fundraising and renovation drive to upgrade and remodel the park. * Stan Hedwall Park - Officially under Chehalis ownership beginning in January, 2014, the park is a combined 200 acres of ball fields, RV parking, trails, and open and forested areas. The Newaukum River, accessible to visitors, winds thru the southern portion of the park. * Westside Park - Located in Chehalis' Historic District, the small park contains basketball courts, a playground, and picnic areas. Local residents recognize the park for its blossoming cherry trees in the spring. * Lintott- Alexander Park - Partially open, the park was built on land donated over a century ago by a Chehalis family. It once housed bath houses and a wading pool before the park became \\"overgrown and abandoned\\" after it was closed in 1988 stemming from budget and maintenance issues. Currently being restored by \\"a nonprofit organization of local citizens\\", that began with a large donation of a local resident in 2004, the almost 6 acre park will fully reopen with playgrounds, sport courts, picnic areas, and a perimeter walking path. * John Dobson and McFadden Parks - Once the epicenter of the Chehalis park system, the neighboring parks are a combined 56 acres. Begun as memorials to well respected Chehalis residents in 1905 (Dobson) and 1912 (McFadden), they are located in the Hillside district. Despite the local community continuing to legally use the parks, they are technically closed as the city does not budget for maintenance except for efforts to clear brush to lower the risk of wildfire. A shared trail, the Dobson-McFadden, bridges the parks and leads to open views to much of Chehalis, including downtown, and the Newaukum River valley. * Millett Field - Notably home to a Chehalis semi-pro baseball team in the first half of the 20th century, and regularly used as the central hub of Chehalis sporting activity for decades, the park began in 1898 as a land donation to the city. An official grand opening took place in 1908. Instructions written in the deed require the park to be used for \\"athletic and playground recreation types of activities\\". A basketball court and a playground area, both created by local charitable acts in the early 2000s, dominate the 3 acre park today. Notable trails not located within a Chehalis park include: * Airport Levee Trail - Mixed paved-gravel trail that loops for up to 3 1/2 miles, it is situated between farm land and the Chehalis-Centralia Airport. * Airport Road Trail - Paved, 2 mile biking trail that parallels Interstate 5 on the west, it is part of a long-term plan to link the Twin Cities under a \\"TransAlta Trail\\" system. * Willapa Hills Trail - At 56 miles, this trail stretches from Chehalis to South Bend, Washington. Built over a late 19th century railroad, it is now a mix of paving and compact gravel and is open to hikers, bicyclists, and horse riding. A Lewis County non-profit hosts an annual, two-day \\"Ride the Willapa\\" bike event in early summer to raise funds to maintain and complete the trail. The trail is under the maintenance auspices of the Washington State Park System.

Points of interest World's Largest Egg The Winlock Egg was listed as the world's largest egg by Ripley's Believe It or Not! in 1989. The current structure is the fourth reincarnation of the original egg. The first egg was built for a celebration of the opening of the Pacific Highway Bridge over the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon. The idea of an egg came from John G. Lawrence, the manager of the newly formed egg and poultry co-op as a way to represent the growing industry centered in Winlock in the 1920s. During that time farmers in Winlock were shipping as much as a quarter million cases of eggs to market a year. The first egg was made of an egg shaped wood frame stretched with canvas and painted white. It was mounted onto a truck as part of a parade of floats and vehicles that traveled from Olympia, Washington to Salem, Oregon on October 23, 1923, to celebrate the expansion of trade between Washington and Oregon through the railroad. After the parade, the egg was placed on a platform near the train depot, and has since remained a source of local pride. The first egg was covered with plaster but after 20 years in the elements the egg had deteriorated and was replaced by a plastic version made by a new company to the area, the Johnny Simpson's Plastic Company. This version also lasted about 20 years when it fell from its platform and cracked. A fiberglass replacement was made that some people thought looked more like a football than an egg. Then in 1991, a new replacement egg was part of the Egg Day Parade before it was placed in the Vern Zander Memorial Park. After the 9/11 attacks on the world trade center the egg was painted as a red, white, and blue American flag.http://www.winlockwa.govoffice2.com/vertical/Sites/%7B131FF39D-640A-4A04-8D6F-F1B120929459%7D/uploads/%7BAF9467A8-11F6-435F-B3B2-5C830CF7957E%7D.PDF In 2014, the Seattle Seahawks logo was painted on the egg after they won the Super Bowl.

The population was 284 at the 2010 census. In the 2004 US presidential election, Almira cast 62.22% of its vote for Republican George W. Bush . History The area that would become Almira was first settled in the 1880s by Charles C. Davis purchased land and erected a small store to serve the few settlers living in the area. With the imminent construction of the Central Washington Railroad (later acquired by the Northern Pacific) through the area in 1889, Davis was approached by land developers Odgers and Reed who were looking to start a town on the site. The developers and Davis agreed to christen the new town Almira, after Davis' wife's given name. His farm had previously been called \\"Davisine\\". With the railroad assured, Almira was platted and lots begin to sell quickly. Contractors and businessman began to build temporary buildings for their stores. The railroad reached Almira in the Fall of 1889, where it would serve as the line's temporary terminus before being extended to Coulee City the following summer. Until the road was completed to the Grand Coulee Almira remained the terminus. All trains ran to this point, connections by stage being made to points westward. These factors made the town furiously active but a harsh winter prevented any building boom from taking place, leaving Almira as a collection of temporary shacks until the weather improved. Despite the end of Almira as a rail terminal, it continued to thrive through 1890 with the establishment of a newspaper and the construction of many new buildings. The town's population was 156. In November 1890, Almira citizens voted for prohibition and the city temporarily became the only dry town in the Big Bend Country. After the Panic of 1893, growth in Almira like all across the country, came to a standstill. Most of the undeveloped lots in town were either in foreclosure or completely worthless. This changed in 1900 when the economy began to improve following several years of prosperous wheat harvests. The next several years saw Almira grow from a temporary village to a more substantial city. In 1902, the city's population was 289 only counting citizens living on the platted town site. Almira was visited by fires twice in 1903. The first on March 21 destroyed several buildings including the office of the Almira News. The second fire in October started in the Almira Hotel and was much more destructive, destroying a whole block's worth of buildings. These blocks were rebuilt with more permanent brick buildings which still stand today. Steps were taken towards incorporation in April 1903 but were initially unsuccessful because of disagreements in the town's incorporation boundaries. The second try was successful and Almira was officially incorporated on February 1, 1904. U.S. Post office in Almira Geography Almira is located at (47.710419, -118.941762).

The population was 236 at the 2010 census. History Creston sprang up with the arrival of the Central Washington Railroad in 1889. It was named so because of its high altitude, because it was thought to be the highest town between Cheney and Coulee City, Washington, along the railroad grade. In the spring of 1890, a town site was platted by H.S. Huson and registered with the state on June 23 of that year. The first structure in town was a small store building moved to the site by Henry Verfurth from the nearby village of Sherman, 5 miles northwest of Creston. A post office was established shortly thereafter whose jurisdiction extended to the Columbia River on the North and the railroad tracks on the South with ten miles East and West. Henry Verfurth was appointed as postmaster. Following the Panic of 1893 and the bankruptcy of the town site owner, Creston remained dormant until a bumper wheat crop in 1897 gave a boost to the regional economy, bringing thousands of new settlers to the region. The results of the strong harvest were immediate with new businesses, grain elevators, public buildings, churches and the towns first bank and newspaper. At the same time, Creston was given a boost by a new road and ferry connecting it to the rich mineral belts in the nearby Colville Indian Reservation. Between 1900 and 1903, Creston's population doubled to 102. In August 1902, the last surviving member of the infamous Hole in the Wall Gang, Harry Tracy, was shot at a Creston ranch and killed himself there to avoid capture.

The population was 1,734 at the 2010 census. History Davenport was first settled in 1880, and was named in 1882 for resident J.C. Davenport. The city was made the county seat of Lincoln County on December 15, 1896, after an election that had chosen Davenport over then-seat Sprague, which had been destroyed in a fire, and Harrington. Davenport was officially incorporated on June 9, 1890. Davenport gained early prominence in the north central part of the Columbia Basin of eastern Washington, with its citizens successfully lobbying to receive the Seattle Lake Shore & Eastern Railway (SLS&E;) in 1889 in place of rival Wheatdale. The transcontinental Northern Pacific Railway (NP) established a subsidiary, the Central Washington Railroad (CW), to build a competing railroad line that reached Davenport in February 1889. A branch line of the Great Northern Railway (GN) was built to Davenport from Bluestem in the 1920s. Davenport is centrally located in the northern wheat belt of the Columbia Basin, where dryland wheat farming on the hills not washed away in the great Missoula Floods some 14,000 years ago, is critical to the agricultural economy of the region. Davenport Union Warehouse and Odessa Union Warehouse operate multiple elevators of varying age and design on the southern part of the city. A few of these structures date to the early days of the city. Davenport still serves as a central collection point for wheat, with most of it shipped out by truck or railcar. While most of the wheat goes to export, some of it does find its way to the ADM flour mills in Spokane and Cheney. Locally grown barley also finds its way to various west coast breweries and other users. Primary State Highway #2 (a.k.a. \\"Sunset Highway\\") closely followed the CW railroad from Coulee City through Davenport to Spokane. The route is now known as U.S. Route 2, but does not follow the original Sunset Highway in many places. Primary State Highway #7 also intersected with PSH #2 in Davenport, and is now part of State Route 28. PSH #22 ran north from Davenport to the Canada‚ÄìUS border near Northport. This is State Route 25 now. Geography Davenport is located at (47.651157, -118.151627). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

The population was 884 at the 2010 census. History Just prior to the construction of the Central Washington Railroad line in 1889, no towns existed west of Davenport in Lincoln County. One place along the line, \\"Wild Goose Bill's Ranch,\\" run by Samuel Wilbur Condit, was assigned a post office by the Federal government. Condit was 62 years old and known throughout the region as Wild Goose Bill when he and another man shot each other to death on Jan. 21, 1895 http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1995/may/18/wilbur-revels-in-its-legacy-wild- goose-bill-days/ Condit platted the town that bears his middle name \\"Wilbur,\\" though he didn't have anything to do with the naming. Goosetown was a consideration, until the blacksmith's wife complained that she would never live in a place with such a silly name. Instead, the name Wilbur was chosen by town surveyors. It had been located on the stage line between Davenport and the Mines in northern Washington and with the speculation of the railroad arriving soon seemed a likely place for a town. The town grew in earnest and was platted in April 1889. With the arrival of the railroad later that year, Wilbur's growth increased rapidly with the establishment of bigger hotels, a bank, a lumber mill and countless other businesses. After several failed attempts to incorporate in 1889, Wilbur was officially incorporated on August 11, 1890. The boom had slowed by 1891 and came to a halt with the Panic of 1893. A fire in October 1891 caused damage to the town, killing 4. Wilbur was brought out of the hard times of the 1890s during a record wheat harvest in 1897 which brought over $1,000,000 to circulation in the town. The construction of a road to Republic then a flourishing mining camp in what was to become Ferry County was expected to increase traffic to Wilbur, but the expected benefit never materialized. After a July 5, 1901 fire destroyed several city blocks, causing $155,000 in damage ($3.9 million in 2017 dollars), a water works was established in 1903. Wilbur was electrically lighted in October 1903 by the Wilbur Electric Company.An Illustrated History of The Big Bend Country, Embracing Lincoln, Douglas, Adams and Franklin Counties. Spokane, WA: Western Historical Publishing Company, 1904. Print. Wilbur gained news coverage in July 2007 as a result of crop circles found roughly 10 miles north of town, just off of Highway 2. The origin of these depressions in the wheat crop of local farmer Jim Llewellyn is unknown, and the phenomenon was covered by new stations as well as newspapers. More crop circles were discovered in August 2009. See this link: On July 31, 2012, crop circles appeared for the third time in wheat fields near the town.

With an estimated 4,845 residents as of 2010, distributed over a land area of , Omak is the largest municipality of Okanogan County and the largest municipality in Central Washington north of Wenatchee. The Greater Omak Area of around 8,229 inhabitants as of the 2010 census is the largest urban cluster in the Okanogan Country region, encompassing most of its twin city of Okanogan. The population has increased significantly since the 1910 census, reporting 520 residents just prior to incorporation in 1911. The land that is now Omak had been inhabited by various Native American tribes before the arrival of non- indigenous settlers in the early 19th century. The city began to develop after the completion of the Okanogan Irrigation Project affecting the Grand Coulee Dam and other nearby electric facilities. The housing and municipal infrastructure, along with regional infrastructure connecting the new town to other municipalities, were built simultaneously in 1908 supported by the local agricultural industry. The name Omak comes from the Okanagan placename [um√°k], or the Salishan term Omachewhich is said to mean \\"good medicine\\" or \\"plenty\\", referring to its favorable climate, with an annual high of around . Omak acts as the gateway to the Okanogan National Forest and consists of a central business district and residential neighborhoods. Omak is a code city governed by a seven-member council and the state's 4th district. Omak's economy is dominated by the primary industries of agriculture and forestry, although economic diversification has occurred with sawmills and recreational tourism. Nearby recreational destinations include walking trails, state parks and national forests, such as Conconully State Park, Bridgeport State Park and Osoyoos Lake State Park. The city is home to a weekly newspaper, the Omak‚ÄìOkanogan County Chronicle, and a Wenatchee Valley College campus. Standards for education in Omak are higher than the state's average, though drugs and alcohol remain a problem among students. U.S. Route 97 passes through the town, while Washington State Route 155, as well as Washington State Route 215, connects the city to Okanogan and Nespelem, respectively. By road, Omak is located approximately from Seattle, Washington, from Spokane, Washington and from Kelowna, British Columbia. History=Origin The Okanogan Valley was the traditional homeland of the Syilx (also called Okanogan) Native Americans, whose territory extended north into what is now British Columbia. The Syilx acquired horses in the mid-18th century, which helped them expand northward. They first met non-native traders and missionaries in the early 19th century. The Syilx participated in trade fairs held at Kettle Falls and at the mouth of the Fraser River. Trading networks strengthened after the acquisition of horses in the mid-18th century. In 1811, Fort Okanogan was built by the Pacific Fur Company at the confluence of the Okanogan and Columbia Rivers. The fort's ownership passed to the North West Company, then the Hudson's Bay Company. Fort Colvile, near Kettle Falls, was another important fur trading outpost. The Okanogan River was used by fur brigades traveling between Fort Okanogan and Kamloops. In the late 1850s this route became known as the Okanagan Trail and was widely used as an inland route to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. In the 1850s, European-Americans settled in the area that is now Omak and built houses and inaugurated mining, logging and agricultural activities. As more white settlers arrived, a dispute about land ownership arose between them and the Native Americans. Ben Ross' cabin In response, a treaty stating that an Indian reservation would be formed on some of the disputed land while the European-Americans would own the remaining land was signed. The Indian land was later reduced to about . Colville Indian Reservation was developed around 1872 during the Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. In 1887, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, a federally recognized tribe, was formed by executive order from 12 individual bands as per the General Allotment Act of 1887. The federal government decided to move Colville Indian Reservation's location west of Columbia River, reducing its area to . It would continue to be reduced for the next 60 years. Nearby Alma was platted as an unincorporated community around 1886. Alma was renamed Pogue in honor of orchardist J.I. Pogue, and was later renamed Okanoganthe present name. J.I. Pogue was upset that his name was replaced, and requested that surveyor, civil engineer and settler Ben Ross establish another town to the north. Born in Bureau County, Illinois, Ross worked for the Great Northern Railroad shortly before moving to Okanogan County. He decided to found a new community at Pogue's proposed location during 1907. It was named Omak, supposedly for the Salishan word Omachesaid to mean \\"good medicine\\" or \\"plenty\\"and referring to the town's favorable climate; although according to William Bright the name comes from the Okanagan placename [um√°k]. Ross sold various items on the present townsite, trying to have his town recognized, and built a cabin in 1907 to provide shelter for his daughter, son and grandchildrenbecoming one of the first white men to settle the area. Growth Omak Schoolhouse, 1910 The town began to develop after the completion of the Okanogan Irrigation Project, which was designed to facilitate farming. At this time, many farmers came to Omak looking for homes. Fruits including apples, berries, peaches, plums and watermelons were cultivated after 1910. Omak served as a census-designated place (CDP) in 1910, and incorporated as a city on February 11, 1911. Omak and Okanogan have shared a rivalry in high school sports. During the Great Depression of 1933, several residents of Omak were forced to work in nearby communities. As a result, the United States Bureau of Reclamation promoted work which was available as part of an improvement project at Grand Coulee Dam in nearby Coulee Dam, which employed approximately 5,000 people between 1933 and 1951 when the megaproject ended. By 1950, the city was home to various buildings and structures including the St. Mary Mission church, which satisfied residential needs. View of Omak, 1909 In the 1910s, Omak was chosen as the location for a sawmill to expand economic growth. Omak Fruit Growers controlled the mill and a nearby orchard processing factory. The Biles-Coleman Lumber Company bought out the organization and built a sawmill outside municipal boundaries on the nearby Omak Mountain in 1924. A secondary sawmill was constructed in the Omak area. The company and their mills were purchased in 1975 by Crown Zellerbach and thus an associated organizationCavenham Forest Industriesacquired the mills. The company ultimately went bankrupt, and in response, employees purchased the mill for 45 million dollars and renamed it Omak Wood Products in an attempt to save their jobs. Omak Woods Products' payroll decreased to 480 in the early 1990s and later went bankrupt themselves, along with Quality Veneer, who later owned the property for 19 million dollars until 2000. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation later purchased the mill for 6.6 million dollars, having closed in 2009 because of low demand, ending over 130 jobs. As of 2013, there are proposals to reopen the mills during the summer season.

The population was 643 at the 2000 census and increased 3.7% to 667 in the 2010 census. History The Hotel Ives, circa 1910 Weeks after a wildfire in 2014 destroyed much of the town of Pateros, this was all that remained of several blocks that were burned down to the foundations. Pateros was originally established as Ive's Landing in around 1886 by Lee Ives. Ives began farming the area near the confluence of the Methow and Columbia Rivers, which was populated by a small band of Native Americans and around 20 Chinese miners. Ives also built an 18-room hotel at the town site and operated a ferry crossing. The first post office was built in 1895. In 1900, Charles Nosler acquired most of the townsite. He renamed the town to Pateros, after a village in the Philippines he previously visited. In 1903, the city consisted of four commercial establishments and nine residences and the town was sold to J.C. Steiner. Steiner vigorously promoted the town, making Pateros the principal rail shipping point between Oroville and Wenatchee. Pateros was officially incorporated on May 1, 1913. In 1962, the Federal Power Commission granted the Douglas County Public Utility District a 50-year license to build and operate Wells Dam about 8 miles downstream of Pateros.

The population was 938 at the 2000 census and decreased to 919 at the 2010 census. History On July 30, 1897, Henry C. Glover platted a town in the Methow Valley he called Gloversville, in which a small store and post office were soon established. In 1898, Glover became postmaster of the town, which was now called Twisp, the origin of which is unclear. The common explanation is that it comes from the Okanagan placename /tx ∑…ôc'p/, which possibly translates to wasp, yellowjacket, or the sound made by a wasp. On June 29, 1899, Amanda P. Burgar platted the town of Twisp adjacent to the original Gloversville site, which was thereafter considered part of Twisp. Twisp soon contained a population of miners and ranchers who were supported by many local businesses, including a drug store, a bank, a hotel, two saloons and a Methodist church. The Methow tribe was also a common sight, who continued to camp in their traditional sites and traded with the settlers. On August 6, 1909, the town was incorporated and elected its first officers. One of the first issues the five-member town council faced was liquor licenses for the two saloons, and a 1910 election was held to determine whether Twisp would implement Prohibition. The saloons served free drinks on election day, which allegedly all 88 voters partook in, and Prohibition was rejected by a vote of 56-32. In 1911, electricity was brought to Twisp and the first movie house opened. On January 15, 1912, the Twisp School, constructed at a cost of $12,109.68, opened its doors. Twisp was largely built of wood and shortly after midnight on July 24, 1924 a fire broke out in downtown Twisp, which burned down two houses and 23 buildings. Only the Filer and McAlister grocery store and the Commercial Bank's vault survived within the fire zone, which were both built of red brick. In 1940, a $50,000 addition to the Twisp School building was completed, which included a library, study hall and gymnasium, and the Twisp High School was relocated to a new wing. By the early 1940s, logging was a large business in Okanogan County and Ernest and Otto Wagner, a father and son team, owned the second largest operation. After their Okanogan mill burned in 1943, they eventually moved all their operations to Twisp and in 1963 a local newspaper reported that \\"its payroll [was] the life blood of the biggest per cent of the people, not only of Twisp but of the entire Methow Valley.\\" In 1948, the Columbia River and its tributaries, including the Twisp and Methow rivers, flooded and the damage in the Methow Valley was estimated to be $4 million, which lost power, telephone service, all its bridges and multiple houses. The opening of the North Cascades Highway in 1972 brought an influx of full-time resident retirees and seasonal recreationalists, which led to an increase of jobs. In 1973, a new high school located between Twisp and neighboring Winthrop was completed and that year's class was the last to graduate from Twisp High School, which was then abandoned and sat vacant for five years. In 1979, the building reopened as the Methow Valley Community Center. In 2009, the vacant ranger station in Twisp was converted to a campus (entitled TwispWorks) where local businesses, community organizations, artists and producers could operate. Twisp, along with several neighboring towns in Okanogan County, was evacuated in August 2015 as a result of the Okanogan Complex Fire. Three firefighters were killed while battling one of the complex's fires near Twisp on August 19. Geography Twisp is located at (48.363971, -120.119620).

It is east of Mazama and north of Twisp. The population was 349 at the 2000 census, and it increased to 394 at the 2010 census. History The town of Winthrop on a snowy day Winthrop was officially incorporated on March 12, 1924. Native Americans were the first inhabitants of Winthrop. They lived along the banks of the Methow, Twisp, and Chewuch rivers, digging camas root, picking berries, fishing and hunting. The first white men to visit the valley were trappers in the 19th century. In the spring of 1868, placer gold was discovered in the Slate Creek District. In 1883, the lure of gold brought the first permanent white settlers, three of whom were James Ramsey, Ben Pearrygin, and Guy Waring. Waring stopped at the forks of the Chewuch and Methow rivers in 1891. His family settled into the \\"Castle\\" (now the Shafer Museum). Although Waring is the acclaimed founding father, the town is named after Theodore Winthrop, a Yale graduate, adventurer/traveler and gifted 19th century author. The town was rebuilt after a devastating fire in 1893. Waring's original Duck Brand Saloon was built in 1891. It survived the fire and is now Winthrop's Town Hall. In 1894, a flood carried away the bridge at the north fork of the river at Winthrop. Colonel Tom Hart rebuilt the bridge in 1895 at Slate Creek. The industry of Winthrop at this time consists of a well-equipped saw mill, several important dairies, raising cattle, and supplying the local mines with goods. Owen Wister, Waring's Harvard roommate, wrote The Virginian, America's first western novel, after honeymooning in Winthrop. By 1915, most of the mines, except for a few in the Slate Creek area, had shut down. In 1972, when State Highway 20 was nearing completion over the North Cascades, several business people began planning for travelers passing through the town. They agreed to the idea of a western-themed restoration which still exists. In 2012, Winthrop was ranked #2 in a National Motorists Association listing of its \\"Worst Speed Trap Cities\\" in North America (qualification of a population less than 50,000). Local attractions Oldest legal saloon in Washington Winthrop is known for the American Old West design of all the buildings in town, making it a tourist destination. The town theme idea was inspired by the example of Leavenworth, Washington, which in turn was heavily based on Solvang, California. Winthrop is a popular cross-country skiing site, with over 120 miles (200K) of groomed trails., Other popular activities include rock climbing, hiking, mountain biking, river rafting, horse-back riding, hunting and fishing, golfing, spectacular sight-seeing and other outdoor activities. Events include the Winthrop Rhythm and Blues Festival, the Methow Valley Chamber Music Festival, live theatre and many art galleries. Winthrop is home to the oldest legal saloon in Washington state.

The population was 936 at the 2010 census. Founded in 1890, the city was home to the Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company along the Long Beach Peninsula, with its core economy based on logging and timber rafting. The city is located on the southern edge of the Long Beach Peninsula, on the north bank of the Columbia River where it meets the Pacific Ocean. It is near the city of Astoria, Oregon, which lies to the southeast on the southern bank of the Columbia. History Colbert House in Ilwaco, a National Register of Historic Places site Ilwaco was first settled by Henry Feister in 1851, and was named for Elwahko Jim, the son in law of Chief Comcomly. Ilwaco was officially incorporated on December 16, 1890. A narrow gauge railway, Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company, ran for over thirty years. Similarly to the nearby city of Astoria, Oregon, and the surrounding communities, Ilwaco historically had a significant population of Finnish immigrants. The railroad ran north up First Street in Ilwaco. A published photo shows the railroad's Ilwaco facilities, including a gallows turntable and elevated watering trough, were located on the southwest corner of the intersection of First and Spruce streets. The depot was built nearby on Spruce Street. A siding was built for the Ilwaco Mill and Lumber Company. A published photo shows the passenger depot on the west side of First Street, at a point 14.8 miles (23.8 km) from the Ilwaco Depot to Nahcotta. The Ilwaco freight depot was in a different building. The freight depot survived to modern times, and has been relocated to become part of the Columbia Pacific Heritage Museum. The train ran out on the dock in Ilwaco. Floating logs were stored behind log booms on the west side of the Ilwaco dock. At some point after 1890, First Street had been covered with wooden planks, and remained so until 1916, when it was paved over. By 1915, a published photo shows many more businesses along First Street. In addition to the city's logging industry, it has had a history as a cranberry producer, with cranberry bogs located immediately north of its downtown.

The population was 151 at the 2010 census, a sharp decrease from the 194 at the 2000 census. The town was named after Chief Toke, an Indian chief of the 19th century., accessed on 2007-08-15 Geography Tokeland is located at (46.709115, -123.987763), in Willapa Bay, by the mouth of the Cedar River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 0.5 square miles (1.3 km2), all of it land. History Tokeland is named after Chief Toke of the Shoalwater Bay Tribe. Toke made the area a summer home for himself and his family, and his presence was first documented there by Lieutenant John Meares after Toke approached Meares' ship in his canoe at the mouth of Willapa Bay in 1788. In 1854, J. F. Barrows settled on Toke Point, but left only a few years later. No other known settlers appeared in the area until the arrival of George Brown in 1858. In 1885, Brown's daughter Lizzie, and her husband, William Kindred, built the Kindred Inn, which still stands as the current-day Tokeland Hotel. When the town's first post office was established in 1894, the Kindreds operated it, and continued doing so for 17 years. Lizzie Kindred was also partial owner of the Tokeland Oyster Company when it opened in 1905. Tokeland became a popular enough destination that in 1910, a group of investors from Portland, Oregon sought to develop an amusement park there that would resemble Coney Island, although these plans never materialized. Similarly to North Cove and other towns on the north side of Willapa Bay, coastal erosion became a serious concern for Tokeland. This, combined with the overall economic pressure affecting the nation during The Great Depression, caused a decline in the area's tourism industry in the 1930s and 1940s. The area's economy received a small boost starting in the 1950s, as recreational boating and fishing, combined with a surge in once-dwindling oyster harvests, rekindled many businesses. This led to the Port of Willapa Harbor making many improvements to Tokeland, including the 1974 addition of a new jetty, moorage, boat ramp, timber seawall, and fish buying station. Climate This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 ¬∞F.

Metaline Falls was officially incorporated on 3 May 1911.https://www.digitalarchives.wa.gov/Record/View/628B65AE67A9E11E1A4A11EC3DCC424C The name Metaline comes from the abundance of lead ore, galena, found in the region. Though these lead deposits were known since 1869, mining did not commence until 1886. Then in 1910, Metaline Falls was connected with the Idaho and Washington Northern Railroad. The Lehigh Portland Cement Co. plant was soon built, taking advantage of the region's limestone deposits. The Pend Oreille Mine was developed in 1929 by Lewis P. Larsen, and combined with production from the Grandview Mine and the Metaline Mine, the area became the state's largest producer of lead and zinc. The train sequences of the 1993 film Benny & Joon were filmed in the Metaline Falls area; the 1997 film The Postman was filmed in part in the area.

Newport began a tourism campaign in 1987 that involved planting hundreds of national, state, and city flags to transform itself into the \\"City of Flags\\". The scheme was abandoned a decade later after issues with theft and maintenance. Geography Newport is located at (48.180634, -117.047407) at an elevation of 2,160 feet (658.5 m). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. The town of Oldtown, Idaho, is just to the east of Newport, and on the Pend Oreille River. There are no natural or physical barriers between the two towns, and it is strictly a political division, separated by the straight-line state boundary. About one-half mile north of Newport, the Pend Oreille River enters Washington State and flows north to Canada. The watershed of the Pend Oreille in the Newport- Oldtown area west of the river is extremely limited. This is due to a small depression of no more than , which begins about one-half mile from the river. Unable to flow uphill, the waters (from natural springs, rainfall runoff, etc.) eventually form the Little Spokane River, and flow southwest towards Spokane. Diamond Lake, WA (elevation 2,345 ft.) is about to the southwest, and is also part of the Little Spokane River watershed (outflow only) via a creek runoff from the uninhabited far west end of the lake.

The population was 12,653 at the 2010 census. Based on per capita income, Artondale ranks 82nd of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked. Parks and green spaces Artondale has several parks and some other green spaces. The largest \\"green space\\" is the Gig Harbor Golf Club, located in the valley of Artondale Creek where the first school on the Gig Harbor peninsula was built. Access to the golf club, the ground and the parts of the creek it contains is restricted to due-paying members, limiting who can enjoy this green space. Artondale contains several PenMet Parks. Wollochet Bay Estuary Park is a 20.3-acre park with 854 feet of shoreline located to the east of Wollochet Dr NW. The park contains and protects the saltwater marsh where freshwater from Artondale Creek mixes with saltwater from Wollochet Bay, creating a unique ecosystem important to the area's bird population. The park is considered to be \\"undeveloped\\", consisting mainly of an open grassy area with some crabapple trees. Views of the estuary and access to the creek and the bay are limited by trees and other foliage. The park is most easily accessed when heading north on Wollochet Dr NW, where one can make a sharp right curve into the gravel road adjacent to a private driveway. This gravel road is the only parking available. Parking is not usually an issue at this park. Harbor Family Park, located at the intersection of 70th Ave NW and 32nd St NW, is a relatively recent addition to the park system made up of areas that were once private residences. Now the houses are gone, and only a few concrete foundations and traces of old, dirt driveways remain, though neighboring houses can often be glimpsed through the trees. The park consists of dirt trails that wind their way through 18.7 acres of lush, second-growth forest. The gravel parking lot can be accessed via either 70th Ave NW or 32nd St NW. At the parking lot, a trashcan and entrance sign mark the start of the trails. Trails can also be accessed by foot at several places along 70th Ave NW. The trails are popular with dog-walkers and runners. The trails are unmarked and often diverge and converge unexpectedly, so users unfamiliar with the area may want to stick to the trails close to 70th Ave NW, where the sounds and glimpses of cars keep one from getting lost. Hales Pass Park is technically a part of the Artondale CDP, though it is traditionally associated with the community of Arletta. The stone building and attached picnic shelter on the site were originally constructed by the Civilian Conservation Core in 1938 to serve as the Arletta School. The building currently houses the Arletta Montessori preschool. Adjacent to the school building is a small baseball field. Tucked away off 36th St NW behind a bus barn are two public tennis courses. Most users park across the street at the Arletta Store parking lot. Schools The Artondale CDP is home to several schools. Artondale Elementary School is a public school offering kindergarten through fifth grade for youngsters within the Peninsula School District. In addition to providing an education for its \\"Otters\\", the adjacent playing fields and playground equipment function as an additional park for the area. On snowy days, toddlers and teens alike flock to the hills on the playfields to sled, build snowmen, or have snowball fights. In the summertime, neighborhood kids will scramble over the jungle gyms while nearby, community sports teams practice and compete at one of the four baseball diamonds. The Artondale Elementary School Campus also houses several classes of the Gig Harbor Coop preschool. Voyager Elementary School and Kopachuck Middle School sit near the Western edge of the Artondale CDP. Both schools serve students of the Peninsula School District. Voyager offers grades from kindergarten-5th grade, while Kopachuck offers 6-8th grade. The majority of Kopachuck students are graduates of either Voyager or Artondale, both of which funnel into Kopachuck Middle School. Most students from Kopachuck will go on to Gig Harbor High School for grades 9‚Äì12. Voyager's mascot is the Vikings, while Kopachuck is the home of the Coyotes. Both schools are across the street from Kopachuck State Park, the only state park on the Gig Harbor Peninsula. Other notable places The Artondale Grange is the most historic building in Artondale. Even as farming has declined in the area, the Grange has remained as a landmark and community center, housing everything from Girl Scout meetings to Haunted Houses. In 2016, Artondale Farm's Scott and Jessica Hogan purchased the building and property and added it to their surrounding farm property. Artondale Farm currently operates a seasonal farm stand at the site and is working on restoring the building. Artondale also has its own community cemetery, located off of Hunt St NW. This small, historic cemetery offers grassy, shaded plots. The cowfarm located near where 40th St NW becomes Wollochet Dr NW also serves as an iconic landmark and a reminder of the agrarian roots of the Artondale community. Also off of Wollochet Dr NW, the Safe Harbor Child Development Center provides daycare and preschool to local children, and the former Peninsula Gardens store, taken over by PenMet parks, serves as an indoor craft and antique marketplace. Other small businesses to be found along Wollochet Drive include Cummings Inc Heating and Cooling and the Center for Ministry Development. Geography Artondale is located at (47.300052, -122.629242). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 13.8 square miles (35.8 km2), of which, 13.6 square miles (35.2 km2) of it is land and 0.25 square miles (0.7 km2) of it (1.82%) is water. The Artondale CDP encompasses parts of other communities not normally considered a part of Artondale by locals, such as parts of Cromwell, Warren and Arletta to the south, Sylvia Lake and Rosedale to the northwest, and Wollochet and Midway to the northeast. The more \\"traditional\\" area of Artondale is usually considered to be the portions of the CDP south of Hunt St NW, west of Wollochet Dr NW, north of 32nd St NW, and east of 92nd Ave NW. Artondale Creek runs through Artondale, before emptying out into Wollochet Bay. Public access to the creek is very limited, though the creek and the opening into Wollochet Bay can be viewed from the pedestrian sidewalk near the intersection of Wollochet Drive NW and Artondale Drive NW, or by exploring through Wollochet Bay Estuary Park. Artondale Creek is known to be a salmon spawning site. Students from Artondale Elementary School have sometimes been invited by residents with creek access to view salmon in the creek during spawning season. Climate Similar to most of the Puget Sound region, Artondale has a wet and mild climate. Though rainfall per year is only slightly above average (41.67 inches vs. 39.2 in.), this rainfall is spread out, creating a higher average number of days with precipitation (131.5 days compared to the national average of 102 days), and a lower-than-average number of \\"sunny\\" days (142 days compared to a national average of 205 days). Many days are both \\"sunny\\" and \\"cloudy\\", with clouds moving quickly in and out of the area. The three months with highest rainfall are January, November, and December. Snow is a rare occurrence in Artondale, with an average of less than 2 inches per year. The snow that does fall tends to be very wet, and snowfall often occurs when temperatures are hovering right around freezing, which can lead to the formation of black ice and dangerous driving conditions. This does not mean that below-freezing days are rare. It's not uncommon to have week-long spells of winter days with lows in the 20s and highs in the mid-to-low 30s. However, usually when the temperature drops, the clouds break up leading to two common winter weather scenarios: cold and clear, or warm and rainy. The coldest month of the year is December, with an average high of 45 ¬∞F and an average low of 36 ¬∞F. Windstorms are a fairly regular occurrence, especially from October to January. The main hazards created by windstorms are related to natural debris (such as branches or small trees) falling onto homes, roadways or power lines. The \\"dry\\" season lasts from May to September, with an average of less than 3 inches of rain falling per month. The driest month of the year is July. Though overall precipitation in August is low, this is also the month with the most thunderstorms (both \\"wet\\" and \\"dry\\"). These storms are often accompanied by sheet lightning; fork lightning is rare. June and early July tend to be cloudy or overcast in the morning, with the cloud cover burning off as the day goes on. The hottest time of the day tends to be in the late afternoon, between 2 and 4 pm. Houses with air-conditioning are few and far between, so on the rare days when the temperature soars above 85 degrees, locals tend to flock to the water or places known to have air-conditioning, such as the movie theater. Kopachuck State Park is an especially popular destination for those with neither air- conditioning, nor waterfront access. The hottest months are July and August, which both have average lows in the mid-50s and an average high of 75 ¬∞F. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 12,653 people, and 4,585 households with about 2.91 persons per household residing in the CDP.

Carbonado is located near the Carbon River in northern Pierce County, approximately 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Seattle. Carbonado is the last town before entering Mount Rainier National Park and is also a popular spot for jeeping. Carbonado served as an important coal mining community in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the town operated the largest coal mine in Pierce County. The population was 610 at the 2010 census. History Carbonado was one of quite a few towns in the Carbon River valley to be settled during an economic boom in the region. The boom was brought on by raw material demands in nearby growing towns such as Seattle and Tacoma. Starting with the town of Wilkeson and moving on through Burnett, Carbonado, Montezuma, Fairfax, and finally Manley Moore, these settlements sprawled up the valley to the very boundary of Mount Rainier National Park. Most of these towns were company towns, meaning that they specialized in the harvest of raw materials on the plot of land that the town was situated on which was owned by a commercial company. Often‚Äîand such was the case of Carbonado‚Äîthe company also owned the houses and the energy resources as well. The energy resource in Carbonado was also the raw material that the citizens of the company town were harvesting, coal. More than 100 miners died in mining accidents in and around Carbanado, including 31 killed in an explosion in Carbon Hill Coal Company's Mine Number 7 on December 9, 1899. During the time of the initial boom in the valley Carbonado grew to rival the size of Tacoma at the time. The railroad, which was integral to the transportation of people, of the raw materials harvested and the supplies need by the towns, stretched all the way up the valley too. Not only did it service the towns but also several homesteads farther up the valley. These homesteads were settled predominantly by Polish immigrants. They supplied the towns down the valley with fresh milk and eggs. Two survive to present day, one known as Carbon River Ranch (the main house is the old Fairfax school and can be seen from the highway) and the other formerly known as Huckle-Chuck. At Huckle-Chuck the original homesteaders house and one of their barns are still used and functional. At the peak of the boom both of these homesteads and the towns which they supplied were quite productive and lively. However, the boom did not last as the economy took a downturn and with it came the end of the need for the lower grade coal being mined at Carbonado and the timber being harvested for use in the settlements further up the valley. Since the decline of the mining era, Carbonado has experienced extreme shrinking and small booms ultimately ending with a steady population. All of the current residents work elsewhere and what was once an economic center for the valley is now a residential community. The railroad also pulled out and destroyed its towns quite recently. The Rails to Trails project has most of the actual rail line land in its possession. The time that Carbonado did spend as a coal mining town is forever kept by the cemetery, abandoned mines, a grown-over coal slag pile, a school, and the company houses left behind. The cemetery holds the memories of older and more recent dead with many of the graveholders family still living nearby. Huge concrete monoliths that once held that cables for the mining carts, point straight towards the old mine shafts and openings and stand overgrown and utilized now only by the town's children. One hill in town started out as the coal slag pile and now has been carpeted by ivy and trees. The school makes up what is known as the Carbonado Historical School District and grades K-8th still attend there. Many of the houses that the company built and originally owned still line main street. They look very similar to each other as was the style of the company builders at the time. And though many of the miners abandoned the town, in some of those houses still live the direct descendants of the original miners. Carbonado was officially incorporated on September 13, 1948. Geography Carbonado is located at (47.079724, -122.051433). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

The population was 8,199 at the 2010 census. Originally a company town, the city is named after the DuPont chemical company which operated an explosives manufacturing plant in the area from 1909 to 1975. History For 10,000 years the Nisqually Tribe lived in relative peace and prosperity in its aboriginal homeland of about two million acres near the present-day towns of Olympia, Tenino, and DuPont, and extending to Mount Rainier. Tribal life changed radically with the advent of Euro-American settlement about 150 years ago. Forced to compromise its interests and rights over the years, the Tribe always sought to maintain its integrity and dignity. Subsisting on shellfish from the beaches and salmon from Sequalitchew Creek. Captain George Vancouver mapped the area in 1792, and in 1833, the Hudson's Bay Company established a fur trading post at Fort Nisqually as a halfway point between Ft. Vancouver and Ft. Langley. The fort was relocated upstream in 1843.Hudson's Bay Company Era, DuPont Museum It was relocated to expand on the fort to house more workers and to have better access to fresh water. Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition held the first American Independence Day celebration west of the Mississippi River in the present-day DuPont area on July 5, 1841. The first school in the area was the Nisqually Methodist Mission school, which operated from 1840 through 1842. Chloe A. Clark was appointed teacher at the school. The first public school was established in 1852. By 1869 the Hudson Bay Company had to sell the land to the U.S. government for $650,000. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 gave the land of the Oregon Territory to the U.S. but still allowed the HBC to continue operating in the area. American farmers in the area resented this decision and pushed out the company by establishing their own market place and squatting on company land. By 1865 there were about 150 illegal squatters on company property who would harass the livestock of the Hudson's Bay Company. A few of the farmers urged Congress to remove the fort as well as the Puget Sound Agricultural Company from the Pacific Northwest. These conditions made it hard to continue operations in the region so the fort was closed. The land was up for grabs once Hudson's Bay Company left and many farmers bought the land. In 1906, the DuPont chemical company purchased a area from the farmers for construction of an explosives plant, as the company was in the midst of expanding into the west. The plant was built on the initial 1833 Ft. Nisqually site and was completed in 1909. During its nearly 70-year history, the plant produced dynamite for the U.S. military as well as for the construction of various civilian projects including the Grand Coulee Dam, the Alcan Highway, and the Panama Canal. A company town was set up about a mile east of the explosives manufacturing facility. By 1909, the village had two houses for the plant managers and 58 houses for the workers, which increased to over 100 houses by the end of 1917.The DuPont Era, DuPont Museum The village was re-designated as the town of DuPont on March 26, 1912, but it was not officially incorporated as a town until 1951, when the company started selling the houses to the employees. The original company town, roughly bounded by Santa Cruz St, Penniman St, Brandywine Ave, and DuPont Ave, was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the DuPont Village Historic District in 1987. The dynamite plant was shut down in 1975 and the land was subsequently purchased by the Weyerhaeuser company for $12 million. The initial plan was to use the 3,000 acres of land to construct a lumber export plant, but the company eventually decided to further develop the town under a New Urbanism model. DuPont, Weyerhaeuser, and the state Department of Ecology began decontamination of the original explosives plant site in 1991, with a golf course being built on the former location of the plant. In recent years DuPont has undergone a transformation with the realization of the modern planned community of \\"Northwest Landing\\". The city is expected to have a built-out population of more than 12,000. In 1975, the midden for the Sequalitchew Archeological site was added to the National Register of Historic Places, it being the oldest known midden in Washington state. Present day DuPont remains a growing community. The elementary school in DuPont, Chloe Clark Elementary (which hosted kindergarten through fifth grade), reached capacity in the 2007‚Äì2008 school year. As a result, starting from the following school year, Steilacoom School district realigned all three elementary schools. Chloe Clark Elementary and Cherrydale Primary in Steilacoom now only have students from grades K-3. Saltar's Point Elementary in Steilacoom now serves 4th and 5th grades. Pioneer Middle School relocated from Steilacoom to DuPont in August 2008. The new school received the LEED award for its \\"Green\\" Design elements.Steilacoom School District Timeline, 2008 Entry DuPont is divided into several subdivisions, each with its own design style and/or building contractors. Northwest Landing is the most visible due to a sign along the freeway drawing attention to it. Several businesses have opened in the downtown area, but development has slowed in recent years. Hoffman Hill is the largest in area, and houses about 60% of the total population. The Historic Village, a residential area which is on the registry of historic places, is the only part of DuPont that is not a modern planned community. Bell Hill is considered the most expensive area of the city. DuPont features trails and green belts throughout, and is about 95% built-out according to the master plan.City of DuPont Master Building Plan On December 18, 2017, an Amtrak train derailed near DuPont, killing three people and injuring more than 100 others.

Sequalitchew Creek trail and beach Within the city limits of DuPont, next to the city hall, lies the Sequalitchew Creek trail which can be accessed by the old narrow gauge railway roadbed which ran from the old Powderworks plant to Puget Sound. The trail leads to Sequalitchew Beach. The creek corridor hosts hundreds of species, including bald eagles, hawks, McKay's bunting, song birds, herons, ducks, owls, frogs, salamanders, snakes, beaver, raccoons, coyotes, deer, and rabbits. The waters off Sequalitchew Beach are inhabited by harbor seals, marbled murrelet and gray whales.Sequalitchew Creek CouncilWeyerhaueser Export Facility Plan, Final Environmental Impact Statement Other trails and wildlife areas DuPont's other trails and its parks offer similar access to wildlife and exceptional opportunities for outdoor activity.

It is south of Seattle. The population was 2,758 at the 2010 census. The town motto is \\"Better Together\\". History For centuries, Nisqually people roamed the rivers and streams of the Eatonville area. Leschi, one of the main leaders of Nisqually was born in this area in 1808. In 1889, Indian Henry was one of the Nisqually who guided the town's Euro-American founder, Thomas C. Van Eaton, from Mashell Prairie to the present site of Eatonville. Legend has it that upon arrival Henry declared, \\"This is a good place. Not much snow.\\" Area white settlers and the accompanying Nisqually were in need of goods, which \\"T.C.\\" provided at his trading post. Supplies were carried by his stage from Spanaway over a rough trail through dense forest. In 1891, the settlers built the town's first school, which is still in use. For years Eatonville was a waypoint for visitors to Mount Rainier. In 1902, the Tacoma Eastern Railroad arrived, providing freight and passenger service and a vital link to Tacoma. Soon after the railroad's arrival, several small mills sprang up in the vicinity. In the 1970s, the Wildlife park of Northwest Trek was opened and it remains to be one of the most popular tourist attractions in the area, other than Mount Rainier itself. Eatonville was officially incorporated on October 28, 1909, after the Eatonville Lumber Company brought in more people to work in its mill. The mill's closure in 1954 was a blow to the town, but community spirit and good schools have kept Eatonville alive and growing. On April 27, 2014, an EF0 tornado briefly touched down and caused some minor damage near Eatonville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 0.0 square miles (0.1 km2), all of it land. Elbe is located approximately 76 km south of Seattle and approximately 140 km north of Portland, Oregon. Mount Rainier, a volcano that is not active, is about 34 km northeast of the village. An eruption of Mount Rainiers is not ruled out by experts for the future. Climate Elbe has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen Csb) typical for the North Coast, characterized by warm (occasionally hot) dry summers, and mild to chilly, rainy and snowy winters. In Elbe's case the climate is moderated by the proximity to the Pacific Ocean with small temperature variations on average throughout the year, resulting in mild year-round temperatures, although winter months can get quite cool with freezing and snowing conditions. Average high temperatures range from in December to in August. Elbe on average has very wet winters and summers with a few days of rainfall, also representative for the region. Temperatures of above are common with measurable snowfall. History Elbe was known as Brown's Junction after the Tacoma & Eastern Railway was built in the region. When a post office was requested a shorter name was demanded. A meeting of settlers decided to honor the pioneer settler Henry C. Lutkens who had come from the valley of the Elbe in Germany. In 1888 the first settlers came to the forests on the Nisqually River. It was the German emigrants Karl L√ºtkens and Adam Sachs. Karl L√ºtkens, who was only 19 at the time, was so enthusiastic about his new home that he persuaded his parents Heinrich and Christina L√ºtkens to come to America as well. These left their previous home in Todendorf in the district Stormarn in Schleswig-Holstein and arrived in America in 1891. The first settlers in this area also included Ferdinand Selle, Christian Fritz, Louis Schuffenhauer, Christian Kruse, Max Ogans, Hans Bartels, Fred Duke, W. Lawrence, Levi Engel, Vincent Rotter, R. Schmidt, Frank Salzer, Gus Stoll and Christian Weilandt. The small town grew, and on June 4, 1892, a post office was already established here. During this time, the place that was previously called Brown‚Äôs Junction received its current name. It is no longer known exactly how the naming came about. Many of today's residents believe that Heinrich L√ºtkens suggested the name Elbe. However, everyone agrees that the name was chosen because the landscape of the Nisqually River at that time was reminiscent of the Elbe in the old homeland. The economic development of the place in the following years was good. Nearby Mount Rainier was the destination of many tourists who took a break on their way to Elbe. In 1894 Heinrich L√ºtkens and his son Karl built a tourist hotel with 48 rooms. Ferdinand Selle had previously built a hotel, but it burned down after a short time. At that time, the village blacksmith Levi Engel was temporarily the editor of a newspaper called \\"Elbe Union\\". With his plate camera Levi Engel accompanied the village life for many years. In 1894 a town hall was also built, in which various events, including A. Dance events took place. In 1895 Heinrich L√ºtkens and his family had a special reunion. From Hamfelde in the district Duchy of Lauenburg in Schleswig-Holstein was Carl B√∂ttcher, the brother-in-law von L√ºtkens, emigrated with his family and settled in a neighboring town of Elbe. In 1904, the town of Elbe was connected to the \\"Tacoma Eastern Railroad\\" rail network, after which the number of tourists increased rapidly. Another large hotel and several restaurants were built. The local co-founder Adam Sachs opened a department store during this time. Two years later, the villagers built a church. The building material and the plot of land were donated by Heinrich L√ºtkens. Until the opening of the church, the residents of Elbe had celebrated their services in private houses or in the town hall. In 1909 Elbe already had 250 inhabitants and in the course of the 20th century the population rose to 437. In 1945 the Alder Dam was built on the Nisqually River, approximately 9.6 km northwest of Elbe. As a result, the water of the river built up and the Alder Lake , the eastern side arm of which reached as far as the Elbe area, was created. Elbe, WA train depot.

The population was 9,173 at the 2010 census, estimated to have increased to 10,191 as of 2018. Fife is contained within the Puyallup Indian Reservation. History The lower Puyallup basin is the ancestral home of the Puyallup people, who were relocated after the signing of the Medicine Creek Treaty in 1854. The treaty ceded Puyallup lands and created the Puyallup Indian Reservation, which was expanded to include modern-day Fife. The land on which the city sits was lost after the signing of the General Allotment Act in 1887 and other land transfers that were later resolved in a 1990 claims settlement. In 1940, Fife was described as \\"at a valley crossroads in the midst of a thickly settled berry growing and truck-gardening district is represented by a string of markets, taverns, shops, and a large, balloon- roofed dance hall along the highway.\\" The 1940 population was 135.Washington - A guide to the Evergreen State, WPA American Guide Series, Washington State Historical Society, 1941 Fife was officially incorporated on February 11, 1957. Due to the increased traffic volume traveling from Puyallup and Tacoma, Fife felt the need to establish itself as autonomous community, not just as an intermediate area between Interstate 5 (I-5) and State Route 167. Fife may have been named for William J. Fife, a prominent Tacoma lawyer, Yukon prospector, once head of the Washington National Guard, and a lieutenant colonel in the field during the Philippine Insurrection. There is also a historic county of Scotland and former Pictish kingdom called Fife, which could also be a source of the city's name. Economy Fife, an eastern suburb of Tacoma, consists primarily of businesses such as car dealerships, warehousing and industrial facilities, motels, drive through smokeshops, quick-dining restaurants as well as an Indian casino and various other highway-side businesses. Its proximity to the Port of Tacoma, Interstate 5, and Highway 167 has contributed to the large number of freight forwarding companies.

History Camp Lewis c. 1917 Camp Lewis during World War I construction MIM-14 Nike Hercules anti-aircraft missile at the Fort Lewis Military Museum Fort Lewis was originally established in 1917 with the passage of a Pierce County bond measure to purchase of land to donate to the federal government for permanent use as a military installation. A portion of the initial land was taken from the Nisqually tribe's reservation. (The Nisqually people would later petition unsuccessfully for the return of this land.) In 1927, Pierce County passed another bond measure to establish a military airfield just north of Fort Lewis. The airfield, called Tacoma Field, opened in 1930 and was renamed McChord Field in 1940. McChord Field separated from Fort Lewis when the U.S. Air Force was created in 1947 and was subsequently renamed McChord Air Force Base. The two bases operated independently of one another for more than 60 years before merging in 2010. Fort Lewis began as Camp Lewis in 1917 when the citizens of Pierce County voted by an eight to one margin to bond themselves for to buy of land. They donated the land to the federal government for military use. The only stipulation was that the tract be used as a permanent army post. Captain David L. Stone and his staff arrived at the camp site 26 May 1917, and a few days later the initial construction began. As work on the camp was pushing forward, the War Department named it \\"Camp Lewis\\" after Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The entire camp was ready for occupancy a month ahead of schedule. In 90 days, Stone had supervised the construction of a \\"city\\" of 757 buildings and 422 other structures, all lighted and heated for 60,000 men. The first recruits moved into their new barracks on 5 September 1917, exactly two months after the post building plan had been handed to the contractors. When they implemented auction of the new cantonment, workmen subscribed $4,000 to build the main gate ‚Äì which is still standing. The arch was built of fieldstone and squared logs resembling the old blockhouses which stood in the northwest as forts. Some 60,000 men, including the 13th and 91st Divisions, moved into the hastily constructed cantonment to train for World War I. Recruited largely from the northwest, the 91st was considered \\"Washington's Own.\\" In 1917, Pierce County, through the process of condemnation proceedings (eminent domain), took of the Nisqually Indian Reservation (14 km2) for the Fort Lewis Military Reserve. The following two years saw tremendous activity at Camp Lewis as men mobilized and trained for war service. Thousands of the nation's youth learned to know Camp Lewis and the state of Washington. With the conclusion of the war, activities at Lewis ground to a standstill. Camp Lewis passed from the hands of Pierce County and became the property of the federal government when the deed for 62,432 acres (253 km2) was recorded in the county auditor's office in Tacoma. When the Great War ended in 1918, the Nisqually people petitioned for their land to be returned to them, but the request was denied by the Secretary of War, Newton Baker. Brigadier General David L. Stone, who had supervised the original construction of Fort Lewis as a captain, returned as its commanding general in 1936, serving until 1937. The project of constructing an army airfield, which later became McChord Air Force Base, directly north of the Fort Lewis installation, received approval as a WPA project in January 1938, and $61,730 was allocated for construction. The allocation provided for clearing, grading, and leveling a runway long by wide. From 1942 to 1943, forty-two Japanese, German and Italian Americans were held at Fort Lewis as part of the government's \\"enemy alien\\" internment program during World War II. The Japanese and Italian internees were transferred to Fort Missoula and the Germans to Fort Lincoln, and the temporary detention facility closed on March 30, 1943.\\"Fort Lewis (detention facility)\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 25 July 2014. Italian prisoners of war, organized into units, were trained as quartermaster units at Fort Lewis, since after Italy surrendered to the Allies and declared war on Germany, they were not strictly held to the work requirements that prohibited prisoners of war from working on items directly headed for the war or in the war effort. At the conclusion of World War II, the northwest staging area of Fort Lewis became a separation center and discharged its first soldiers in October 1945. Sometime in the early 1960s Interstate 5 was built through the fort separating the northwest corner of the fort, and creating \\"Northfort\\". With the departure of the 4th Infantry Division (United States) for Vietnam in 1966, Fort Lewis once again became a personnel transfer and training center. David H. Hackworth described his service commanding a training battalion at the Fort during the Vietnam War in his memoir \\"About Face\\". In 1972, the 9th Infantry Division (United States) was reactivated, and trained there until its deactivation in 1991. The Fort Lewis Military Museum was established in 1972 to preserve and document the post's history.

On 12 October 1999, General Eric K. Shinseki, Chief of Staff of the Army, announced I Corps would lead the acceleration of Army transformation, training and the initial creation of the first two Stryker Brigade Combat Teams at Fort Lewis. Since 11 September 2001, I Corps and Fort Lewis assets have been active in providing support for Global War on Terrorism operations, including Operation Noble Eagle (Homeland Defense), Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) and Operation Iraqi Freedom. On 5 February 2004, Task Force Olympia was activated, as a sub-element of I Corps headquarters with the mission to command forward- deployed units in Iraq. This marked the first time that I Corps had forward soldiers in combat since the end of the Korean War. Task Force Olympia included units from all three components of the Army (Active, Reserve and National Guard) as well as Marine and Australian officers. Task Force Olympia's subordinate units included the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, which deployed for Iraq on 8 November 2003, and returned to Fort Lewis after one year of combat duty, and the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, which departed Fort Lewis on 15 September 2004, for one year and returned September 2005.

The post supports over 120,000 military retirees and more than 29,000 family members living both on and off post. Fort Lewis proper contains 86,000 acres (350 km2); the Yakima Training Center covers 324,000 acres (1,310 km2). JBLM Main & North have abundant high-quality, close-in training areas, including 115 live fire ranges. Additional training space is available at the Yakima Training Center in eastern Washington, including maneuver areas and additional live fire ranges. In 2009, the former Fort Lewis Regional Correction Facility was remodeled and renamed the Northwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility (NWJRCF). The facility houses minimum and medium security prisoners from all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. During the summer months (June, July, August), JBLM North hosts the Leader Development and Assessment Course, a capstone program for the U.S. Army's ROTC program. Also adjacent to the post is Camp Murray (Washington National Guard). Yakima Training Center ROTC cadets compete at the water confidence course during Leader Development and Assessment Course training The Yakima Training Center is a major sub-installation of JBLM, and provides a full range of training lands and ranges to active and reserve component units. Encompassing more than , YTC is a world-class facility. The training center is high desert, and is covered with sagebrush, volcanic formations, dry gulches and large rock outcroppings. YTC has vast flat valleys separated by intervening ridges which are suited to large-scale mechanized or motorized forces. Much of the steeper terrain resembles areas of Afghanistan. Twenty- five ranges, including the state-of-the-art Multi-Purpose Range Complex and Shoot House, are available for individual or collective training. Prior to 1941, the area consisted of ranches and a few scattered silica mines. Just before World War II, the Army's need for a large training and maneuver area became apparent, and the Army negotiated with landowners to lease for the Yakima Anti-Aircraft Artillery Range. Military organizations in the Pacific Northwest used the center for range firing and small unit tests. The first range was constructed in 1942 on Umtanum Ridge, northeast of the present cantonment area. In 1947, approximately were cleared of unexploded ammunition and returned to the original owners. During 1949 and 1950, the state of Washington used the center for summer training of its National Guard units and regular Army troops were permanently assigned to the center. At the start of the Korean War, the Army decided to expand Yakima Training Center. In 1951, the Installation was enlarged to and construction of the current cantonment area began. In 1986, a further expansion was initiated, and in 1992, the Army acquired additional land to enlarge YTC to . The Multi-Purpose Range Complex opened in 1989, and the Shoot House and Urban Assault Course opened in 2005. YTC has an AAFES shoppette, a recreation center and a gymnasium available to soldiers and their families. The Firing Point community club, with cafeteria, opened in February 2009.  Gray Army Airfield  Chinook helicopters over Gray Army Airfield at Ft. Lewis in 1977 Gray Army Airfield , is a military airport located within Fort Lewis. The field is named in honor of Captain Lawrence C. Gray, who lost his life during a free balloon flight at the field on 4 November 1927. It is used by Army helicopters.Gray Army Airfield Helicopters based at the airfield assisted with medical evacuations at Mount Rainier National Park on numerous occasions in the 1970s. Army helicopters were also used to insert search-and-rescue [SAR] teams into inaccessible areas on the east, north, and west sides of the mountain, lowering rangers to the ground by a cable device known as a \\"jungle penetrator\\". Helicopters began assisting with high altitude (above 10,000 feet) SAR operations in the 1980s. Helicopters were also used for \\"short haul\\" rescue operations, in which a ranger and litter were carried in a sling below the helicopter to the scene of the accident. During World War II the Air Transport Command 4131st Army Air Force Base Unit used GAAF as the CONUS hub for the Alaskan West Coast Wing, ferrying supplies, equipment and aircraft to Eleventh Air Force at Elmendorf Field, near Anchorage. Also used by Air Technical Service Command as an aircraft maintenance and supply depot; primarily to service aircraft being sent to Alaska. The Army Air Force closed its facilities in 1947. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 15.9 square miles (41.2 km2), of which, 15.3 square miles (39.6 km2) of it is land and 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2) of it is water. The total area is 3.78% water. The military base is, as previously stated, much larger than the CDP defined by the Census Bureau. Fort Lewis' terrain is primarily a mixture of dense conifer woods and open Puget prairie-garry oak woodlands. Invasive Scotch Broom has taken over many areas. The landscape is very rocky from glacial meltwater deposits. Poison oak is found in the training areas. Canada Thistle grows thickly in some areas. All trees are to be left standing; post policy prohibits cutting or trimming them. The temperatures during summer vary from the mid 40s at night to the mid 70s during the day, occasionally peaking over . Although July and August are the driest months. Fort Lewis, due to its size and reserved land, serves as an important habitat for amphibian development and study. Demographics The census-designated place (CDP) Fort Lewis is located within the installation's area.Map of Fort Lewis CDP vs. Fort Lewis Military Reservation U.S. Census Bureau As of the 2000 census, the CDP, which includes the most densely populated part of the base, had a total population of 19,089.

It is located approximately 5 miles (8 km) from Gig Harbor. The island was named Fox by Charles Wilkes during the United States Exploring Expedition, to honor J.L. Fox, an assistant surgeon on the expedition. The population was 3,633 at the 2010 census. Geography Fox Island is located at (47.244053, -122.619906). There is a dock on the north side of the island. The waters around the island are used for fishing and scuba diving. According to the United States Census Bureau, the census- designated place has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (18.31%) is water. Fox Island is separated from the mainland by Hale Passage to the north. The Fox Island Bridge crosses that passage to connect the road network to the mainland at Artondale. A small inhabited island named Tanglewood lies just off Fox Island along the Hale Passage; it was included as part of the Fox Island CDP for the 2010 Census. To the southwest, Carr Inlet separates Fox Island from McNeil Island. History In 1792, during the Vancouver Expedition, Peter Puget led an exploration party through southern Puget Sound. After an encounter with local Native tribes ended with Puget ordering a musket fired as warning, the exploration party retreated to Fox Island, where they made camp for the night. In 1856, during the Puget Sound War, most of the Puyallup and \\"non-hostile\\" Nisqually Indians, totaling about 500 people, were removed from their homelands and displaced to Fox Island. John Swan was assigned to supervise the internment camp and distribute food rations provided by the government (territorial government). On January 5, 1856, Chief Leschi and other \\"hostile\\" Indians arrived at Fox Island with a flotilla of canoes. Trusting Swan, they had come to talk about the war and how to resolve it. While the hostile Indians were on Fox Island, Captain Maurice Maloney took the steamship Beaver to the island, hoping to rescue Swan, but forgot to bring landing craft and was unable to send men ashore. Before Maloney could figure out what to do, Swan came to the shore and paddled a canoe to the Beaver. He told Maloney that there had been no violence, urged him to not come ashore, and said he had promised to return to the island, which he did. Maloney returned to Steilacoom and, along with other military officers, took another steamship, the USS Active from Steilacoom to Seattle to get a howitzer (which they failed to acquire), then back to Fox Island, hoping to capture Chief Leschi. But by the time the Active returned, more than 30 hours after Leschi had arrived on Fox Island, the hostile Indians had left. By August 1856 the war was essentially over. Governor Isaac Stevens went to the Indian encampment on Fox Island to renegotiate the 1854 Treaty of Medicine Creek, which had been a major factor in the outbreak of war. Stevens agreed to new, larger reservations for both the Puyallup and Nisqually tribes. The first non-Indians settled on Fox island in 1856, just after the war ended. One of the first real estate transactions was in 1881 when 56.5 acres (22.6 hectares) were sold for $118. By 1908 there were about 60 homes scattered across the island. The most important change to this community happened in 1954 when the Fox Island Bridge was completed, connecting Fox Island to the mainland. This allowed easy access to businesses, schools, and medical facilities outside the island. During the construction a historical Indian canoe was found preserved in the mud, which can be visited in the Fox Island history museum. In 1956 the population of the island was 120, by 2000 it had grown to more than 2,800. Cartoonist Gary Larson visited Fox Island frequently as a child. He has called Fox Island a \\"wondrous place\\" and credits the island's swamps and wildlife with inspiring his interest in nature. On April 29, 1988, at 6 PM local time, a nuclear-powered US Navy submarine, the USS Sam Houston (SSBN-609), ran aground on Fox Island while operating in nearby Carr Inlet. The ship remained aground for approximately 10 hours until high tide returned and tugboats were brought in to unstick the ship. No damage was done to the island, and the ship entered a drydock at the Bangor Naval Submarine Base for minor repairs to its hull. In recent years, Fox Island has become a wealthy exurb of Tacoma, largely because of the amount of waterfront property on the island and because of the island's location between the Olympic Mountains and Mount Rainier; a large number of the island's residential properties have views. Based on per capita income, one of the more reliable measures of affluence, Fox Island ranks 29th of the 522 ranked areas in the state of Washington. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 2,803 people, 1,048 households, and 847 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 536.3 people per square mile (206.9/km2).

The population was 7,126 at the 2010 census. Gig Harbor is one of several cities and towns that claim to be \\"the gateway to the Olympic Peninsula\\". Due to its close access to several state and city parks, and historic waterfront that includes boutiques and fine dining, it has become a popular tourist destination. Gig Harbor is located along State Route 16, about 6 mi (10 km) from its origin at Interstate 5, over the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. A $1.2 billion project to add a second span to the bridge was completed in 2007.WSDOT - SR 16, Tacoma Narrows Bridge Project From Gig Harbor, Tacoma can be reached in under 20 minutes and Seattle in under an hour. History During a heavy storm in 1840, Captain Charles Wilkes brought the captain's gig (small boat) into the harbor for protection. Later, with the publication of Wilkes 1841 map of the Oregon Territory, he named the sheltered bay Gig Harbor. In 1867, fisherman Samuel Jerisich came to the Gig Harbor area, along with many other immigrants from Sweden, Norway, and Croatia. The town was platted in 1888 by Alfred M. Burnham. Gig Harbor was officially incorporated on July 12, 1946. Commercial fishing, boat building, and logging dominated the economy until the construction of the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940. Until then, the primary method of transportation between Gig Harbor and the economic center of nearby Tacoma was by steamship. Starting in 1836, steamships started plying the waters of Puget Sound and quickly developed into what was eventually dubbed the \\"Mosquito Fleet\\". Gig Harbor, isolated from Tacoma and Seattle by Puget Sound and the Tacoma Narrows, could not be reached by automobile or horseback except by a very long and arduous trip south around Puget Sound and Hammersly Inlet. The boom was to be short lived, as the first bridge collapsed just months after it was completed. The resource demands of World War II prevented another bridge from being built until 1950. Between the time when the first bridge collapsed and when the second bridge was completed, a state-run ferry service delivered drivers directly into downtown Gig Harbor. Remains of the ferry dock can still be seen just outside the mouth of the harbor at the southeast end of Harborview Drive. The area has been turned into a small park, where the public can see a panoramic view of the Cascade Mountains, Point Defiance, and Mount Rainier. After the completion of the replacement bridge in 1950, Gig Harbor and the surrounding area quickly began to develop as a suburb of neighboring Tacoma. First, the area had substantial residential development as families retreated from Tacoma in favor of the tree-lined neighborhoods and waterfront lots available on the Gig Harbor Peninsula. What had once been summer cabins became primary residences for people who commuted daily over the bridge to Tacoma. Medium-sized housing development sprang up across the peninsula. The 1980s and 1990s had substantial retail development near State Route 16 to serve the growing residential population, shifting the economic center of Gig Harbor out of downtown. For some time, city leaders were unsure how to handle the growth while maintaining the character of the city. Ultimately, the city decided to aggressively annex the surrounding rural areas and convert them into high- density commercial and housing districts, forever changing the rural character of the area, but assuring that little new development happens in the historic downtown area, preserving its history and charm. By the 1970s, local merchants had begun actively promoting the downtown area for its historic value, and tourism became prominent on the list of economic engines in Gig Harbor. Today, downtown Gig Harbor is a very active place for tourists with shopping, dining, and recreation on every block. The last large swath of undeveloped waterfront property at the south end of downtown was recently developed into the headquarters of the Russell Foundation, named for George Russell, founder of Russell Financial. Boats in Gig Harbor Today, despite a long history of boat building, very little manufacturing exists in Gig Harbor. The only remaining boatbuilder is Gig Harbor Boatworks, which builds rowing and sailing dinghies in classic style using modern materials. Until recently, Tiderunner Boats maintained a manufacturing facility at the north end of the bay. The historic Skansie boatyard is now primarily a maintenance facility for yachts and pleasure craft. The Glein/Eddon/Gig Harbor boatyard was recently purchased by the city after spending many years sitting idle. The city intends to use it as a working waterfront museum. Commercial fishing is still of great cultural, if somewhat lesser economic, importance to Gig Harbor, and many commercial fishing boats make it their home port. Most, however, do not rely on Puget Sound to gather their catch, instead finding it more profitable to venture north to Alaska to fish in the summer. Gig Harbor's fishing fleet still gathers the first weekend in June (during the Maritime Gig Festival) in the center of the bay for the annual Blessing of the Fleet ceremony. In recent years, due to the dwindling number of remaining fishing boats, pleasure craft have been allowed to participate in the ceremony, somewhat lessening its authenticity, but increasing its visibility and participation. A new Tacoma Narrows Bridge has been built alongside the existing bridge and opened July 2007, doubling past capacity. Skansie shipyard Aerial view, looking northwest, of the harbor and town of Gig Harbor, Washington, with Henderson Bay in the background In 1905, the Skansie brothers were the first in the area to build a gasoline-powered fishing boat. They did so at first by refitting boats with a gasoline-powered engine. Usually the motors were quite small, between 6 and 8 horsepower; the Skansie brothers originally used a 7-horsepower engine. Although these were powerboats, neither masts nor a turntable to hoist in the nets were used. This work was all done by hand. However, with the introduction of a motor, the boats were not able to go as far as Alaska. Skansie shipyards built fishing vessels from the late 1910s to the early 1950s.

Government and politics The city was incorporated in 1996. Police The City of Lakewood contracted with the Pierce County Sheriff's Office for police services between 1996 and 2004. The city created the LPD in 2004. According to the City of Lakewood website, The Lakewood Police Department started independent police and patrol operations on November 1, 2004. =2009 shooting= On November 29, 2009, four LPD officers were shot and killed. Maurice Clemmons walked into the Parkland Forza Coffee shop at around 8:15 a.m. After approaching the counter, he turned and started shooting. Dead at the scene were Sergeant Mark Renninger, 39, and officers Tina Griswold, 40, Ronald Owens, 37, and Greg Richards, 42. Each of them had served with the department since its inception. Two baristas and several customers in the shop were not injured. Clemmons was shot and killed by a Seattle police officer two days later. The shooting is believed to be the most deadly attack on law enforcement in the state of Washington, and the second deadliest attack on law enforcement in the United States (the Dallas attack on July 7, 2016 had 5 officers killed and 2 wounded) since the March 21, 2009 shootings that left four Oakland, California police officers dead. The four were the first Lakewood police officers to be killed in the line of duty since the department's establishment in 2004. Education The Clover Park School District operates all public schools within Lakewood. Lakewood is also home to Pierce College Fort Steilacoom and Clover Park Technical College.

History= Origins  Program for the opening of McChord Field, In , the citizens of Pierce County, Washington approved a bond measure for to buy of land to be donated to the Federal Government for use as a military reservation. This land became Camp Lewis (and later Fort Lewis). Ten years later, in , another bond measure was passed to establish an airfield just north of the military reservation. The airfield, named Tacoma Field, officially opened .McChord AFB Museum history section On the airfield was officially transferred to the federal government. Three years after the transfer, on , the airfield was renamed McChord Field, in honor of Colonel William Caldwell McChord,William Caldwell McChord who had been killed in an accident near Richmond, Virginia on . Col. McChord, (1881‚Äì1937), rated as a junior military aviator in , died while trying to force-land his Northrop A-17 near Maidens, Virginia. At the time of his death, he was Chief of the Training and Operations Division in HQ Army Air Corps. Tacoma Field was renamed McChord Field, .Mueller, Robert, \\"Air Force Bases Volume 1: Active Air Force Bases Within the United States of America on 17 September 1982\\", United States Air Force Historical Research Center, Office of Air Force History, Washington, D.C., 1989, , page 391. Over the subsequent two decades McChord Field grew to roughly , encompassing the northern tip of the Ft. Lewis. It became independent of Ft. Lewis in following the creation of the Air Force under provisions of the National Security Act of 1947 and was subsequently named McChord AFB. World War II In , McChord Field became the headquarters of the GHQ Air Force Northwest Air District, with a mission for the defense of the Pacific Northwest and Upper Great Plains regions of the United States. The 17th Bombardment Group was moved to the new airfield from March Field, California and was equipped with the Douglas B-18 Bolo medium bomber. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on , the 17th Bombardment Group flew anti-submarine patrols off the West Coast of the United States with the new North American B-25 Mitchell medium bomber. As the first unit to operate the B-25, the 17th achieved another first on 24 December 1941 when one of its Mitchells dropped four bombs on a Japanese submarine near the mouth of the Columbia River. The 17th Bomb Group was reassigned in February 1942 to Columbia Army Air Base in South Carolina, where crews from the group were selected to carry out the Doolittle Raid on Japan in April. With the departure of the 17th Bomb Group, the mission of McChord Field became supporting the Army Air Forces Training Command's mission of training of units, crews, and individuals for bombardment, fighter, and reconnaissance operations. Northwest Air Force was re-designated as the Second Air Force, and became the training organization of B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator heavy bombardment groups. Nearly all new heavy bomb groups organized after Pearl Harbor were organized and trained at Second Air Force Bases, by II Bomber Command operational training units (OTU) then were deployed to combat commands around the world. McChord trained numerous bombardment squadrons during the war, receiving graduates of AAF Training Command's flight and technical schools and forming them into operational squadrons which were then sent on to second and third phase training prior to being deployed to the overseas combat air forces. Starting in mid-1943 the training of B-17 and B-24 replacement crews began to be phased out, as the Second Air Force began ramping up training of B-29 Superfortress Very Heavy bomb groups, destined for Twentieth Air Force. Under the newly organized XX Bomber Command, B-29 aircraft were received from Boeing's manufacturing plants at Seattle and Wichita, Kansas and new combat groups were organized and trained, primarily in Kansas and Nebraska. McChord also had large maintenance facilities for Air Technical Service Command during the war, serving as a P-39 Airacobra modification center April 1944 ‚Äì May 1945 for lend-lease aircraft being sent to Russia via the Alaska Territory. Following the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, McChord redeployed thousands of troops arriving from the European theater to the Pacific as part of Air Transport Command in anticipation of invading the Japanese home islands scheduled for November 1. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 forced the surrender of Japan, cancelling the planned operation altogether. Cold War In 1945 McChord was designated as a permanent station by the Army Air Forces. It was assigned to Continental Air Forces in April 1945, becoming headquarters of the 1st and 2d Bomb Wings after their return from combat in Europe. In 1948, the field was re-designated McChord Air Force Base. =Air Defense Command= : see also: 25th Air Division 319th Fighter Squadron (All Weather) North American F-82F Twin Mustang 46-494 at McChord AFB, Washington, October 1949 On 1 August 1946, McChord was assigned to the new Air Defense Command, with a mission of air defense of the United States. During the Cold War, numerous fighter-interceptor squadrons were stationed at the base, as well as Radar and Command and Control organizations, the 25th Air Division being headquartered at McChord from 1951 until 1990. The 325th Fighter Group (All-Weather) operated two squadrons of F-82F Twin Mustangs from McChord between 1948 and 1950, the first postwar fighter optimized for the air defense interceptor mission. Designed for very-long range bomber escort missions in the Pacific during World War II, the design became operational too late to see service and was adapted for the air defense mission. Other interceptor squadrons stationed at McChord were: * 64th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron * 317th Fighter Interceptor Squadron * 318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron * 465th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron * 498th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron The base was the location of the first of twenty- eight stations built by ADC as part of the permanent air defense radar network, and was the top-priority site for ADC radars.A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946 ‚Äì 1980, by Lloyd H. Cornett and Mildred W. Johnson, Office of History, Aerospace Defense Center, Peterson Air Force Base, ColoradoWinkler, David F. (1997), Searching the skies: the legacy of the United States Cold War defense radar program. Prepared for United States Air Force Headquarters Air Combat Command. The 505th Aircraft Control and Warning Group, the first postwar general surveillance radar organization was activated at McChord on 21 May 1947. Defensive warning radars became operational at McChord on 1 June 1950 with World War II-era AN/CPS-4 and AN/CPS-5 radars being operated by the 635th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. ADC completed installation of two AN/CPS-6B medium-range search and height-finder radars in February 1951. Performance of these new radars was deemed inferior to the World War II vintage models and the calibration process delayed operational readiness at this and other sites. An AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar was installed in the mid-1950s. In 1958, a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC-12), and Combat Center (CC-3) was established at McChord. It became operational in 1960. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. It was initially under the command of the Seattle Air Defense Sector (SeADS), activated on 8 January 1958. The ADC radar site (P-1) was deactivated 1 April 1960 and repositioned to Fort Lawton AFS (RP-1) where the Air Force consolidated its anti-aircraft radars with the United States Army Seattle Defense Area Army Air-Defense Command Post (AADCP) S-90DC for Nike missile operations. SeADS was inactivated on 1 April 1966 and the SAGE headquarters combat center came under the 25th Air Division. The Command Center (CC-3) was active until 30 June 1966 when it was inactivated as part of an ADC reorganization. The Data Center (DC-12), with its AN/FSQ-7 computer remained active until 4 August 1983 under the 25th AD when technology advances made the SAGE system obsolete. Today, the successor organization to the 25th AD, the Western Air Defense Sector (WADS), is a major tenant organization at McChord, being one of two air defense sectors responsible for the security and integrity of continental United States air space. WADS is staffed by members of the Washington Air National Guard (WANG) and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Operationally, WADS reports to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. =Military Airlift Command= McChord Main Gate in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Mount Rainier is in the background. In 1947 Tactical Air Command moved the 62d Troop Carrier Group to McChord Field from Bergstrom Field, Texas. Headquarters Army Air Forces directed each Army Air Force have a tactical group assigned to establish a Wing headquarters. Thus, the 62nd Troop Carrier Wing (TCW), constituted on 28 July 1947, was activated at McChord Field on 15 August. The new Wing was assigned to Twelfth Air Force, with the 62d Troop Carrier Group becoming one of the Wing's subordinate units; its flying arm, being equipped with Curtiss C-46 Commandos. In 1948, 62nd TCW assets were tapped to support the now famous Berlin Airlift. More than 100 men, primarily mechanics, aerial engineers, and truck drivers were identified for a 90-day temporary tour of duty in Europe, to bolster airlift resources. On 6 October 1949, the 62nd received its first four-engine Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport. By Thanksgiving of that same year, the Wing was equipped entirely with C-54s, and its designation was changed from 62nd Troop Carrier Wing (Medium), to (Heavy). On 1 June 1950, the Wing was inactivated due to budget reductions. However, as a result of the Korean War, on 17 September 1951, the Wing was once again activated at McChord AFB. Shortly thereafter, the Group and its three flying squadrons, the 4th, 7th, and 8th, again assigned to the Wing, returned to McChord. Not two years had passed, however, before the Wing was once again on the move. Now flying the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II. During 1952 and 1953, the 62nd airlifted troops, blood plasma, aircraft parts, ammunition, medical supplies, and much more, to the Far East, in support of the war in Korea. In April 1954, the 62nd transported a replacement French garrison to Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina. Operation Bali Hai saw the Globemasters fly around the world in a period of 8 to 10 days. By 1955 the Cold War was well under way, and the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) set out to build a chain of radar stations on the northernmost reaches of the continent. This chain of radars, known as the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, was to detect incoming Soviet missiles and bombers, and give the U.S. forces enough warning to launch a counterattack, and get the National Command Authorities to safety. Between 1955 and 1957, the 62nd began to fly missions to the Alaskan arctic regions, carrying 13 million pounds of supplies and equipment to build the DEW Line. The resupply of the DEW Line stations kept the Wing occupied until 1969. The 62nd Troop Carrier Wing (Heavy) was reassigned to the Military Air Transport Service Continental Division on 1 July 1957 as TAC realigned its transport units. Meanwhile, the Air Force reorganized the structure of its wings, and the 62nd Troop Carrier Group, was inactivated 8 January 1960 when squadrons were assigned directly to the wing as part of the Air Force tri-deputate reorganization. During the International Geophysical Year 1957‚Äì1958, and subsequently through 1962 the 62d TCW supported scientific stations in the Arctic Ocean by airlanding and airdropping supplies on the drifting ice. It helped transport United Nations troops and supplies to the Congo in 1960. In 1963 the wing assumed responsibility for worldwide airlift of nuclear weapons and associated equipment, continuing this mission through early 1971. In 1968, McChord AFB was relieved of its assignment to the subsequently renamed Aerospace Defense Command and was reassigned to Military Airlift Command (MAC) as one of three MAC bases in the western United States operating the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter. ADC, and later Tactical Air Command (TAC) continued to maintain a fighter alert detachment at McChord with Convair F-106 Delta Dart and later McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle aircraft. On 18 September 1969 a United States Air Force twin engine Douglas C-47 Skytrain crashed just after takeoff from McChord. It came down in the wooded area just south of the runway. Five men died and seven other men were injured. In 1975, TAC divested itself of its Lockheed C-130 Hercules tactical airlift fleet, transferring all tactical airlift wings, groups and squadrons to MAC. For the 62 AW, this resulted in a significant increase in the wing's total mission capabilities beyond strictly strategic airlift with the arrival of the 36th Tactical Airlift Squadron (36 TAS) and their C-130E aircraft and personnel from Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. In 1980, following the eruption of Mount St. Helens, a 36 TAS C-130 crew provided communications support during the search for survivors. One week after St. Helen's first eruption, a second one occurred. All of the base's flyable aircraft were evacuated following reports that ash was drifting northwest toward McChord. In 1988 McChord became involved in combating devastating Yellowstone National Park forest fires, carrying troops from Fort Lewis to the fire areas. In 1991, Clark Air Base in the Philippines was evacuated due to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. By 16 June, the evacuation order was issued and the first plane load of evacuees arrived at McChord on the 18th. In 1992, with the disestablishment of Military Airlift Command, McChord became an Air Mobility Command base. In November of that same year, two McChord C-141 Starlifters, participating in an air refueling training mission over north central Montana, collided in mid-air, killing all 13 crewmen. Modern era As the C-141 was phased out at McChord during the 1990s, it was replaced with the C-17 Globemaster III. McChord AFB and its 62 AW was the second AMC base to receive this aircraft for active duty, the first having been the 437th Airlift Wing (437 AW) at Charleston AFB, South Carolina. McChord has been the host base for the Air Mobility Rodeo in 1998, 2005, 2007 and 2009. On 1 February 2010 it again joined with Fort Lewis to become Joint Base Lewis-McChord, per the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Like most US military installations, McChord is closed to the general public, other than during their annual Open House. The McChord Field Historic District was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 12 December 2008.

It was named in honor of Colonel William Caldwell McChord, former Chief of the Training and Operations Division in HQ Army Air Corps. Much of the base is a census-designated place (CDP), which had a population of 4,096 at the 2000 census. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 4,096 people, 1,004 households, and 978 families residing on the base. The population density was 272.7/km2 (706.5/mi2). There were 1,010 housing units, with an average density of 67.2/km2 (174.2/mi2). The racial makeup was 76.5% White, 8.5% African American, 0.7% Native American, 4.2% Asian, 0.7% Pacific Islander, 3.2% from other races, and 6.3% from two or more races. 8.1% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. There were 1,004 households, out of which 77.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 89.9% were married couples living together, 4.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 2.5% were non-families. 2.0% of all households were made up of individuals. The average household size was 3.46 and the average family size was 3.49. On the base the population was spread out, with 36.3% under the age of 18, 22.2% from 18 to 24, 39.5% from 25 to 44, 1.8% from 45 to 64, and 0.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females, there were 127.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 137.1 males. The median income for a household was $35,319, and the median income for a family was $35,205. Males had a median income of $23,004 versus $22,216 for females. The per capita income for the base was $12,454. About 5.5% of families and 7.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.5% of those under the age of 18 and none of those 65 and older.

The population was 7,414 at the 2000 census. Geography Midland is located at (47.171510, -122.411060). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 3.0 square miles (7.8 km2), all of it land. History The area that we have come to know as Midland in part was often referred to by the pioneers as Puyallup Hill. Taking advantage of the Governments Donation Land Grant of 1850, both Ezra Meeker and his older brother Oliver Meeker settled in the area in 1855. This was after their father, Jacob Meeker came west. Jacob settled in the area of South Tacoma. Not wanting to cross the sound Jacob talked both sons into moving to the mainland from their island home on McNeil Island. With this Ezra and Oliver staked out claims on the mainland next to each other. Ezra located his claim on the north side of Oliver‚Äôs claim. These claims were described as the forest between Nisqually Plain and the Puyallup River. Hudson Bay employees often referenced the northern end of Nisqually Plain as the Puyallup Plain, which is all of South Tacoma and Lakewood. Just to the east of this was called the Puyallup Swamp, that area to the north of Wapato Lake and south following the base of the Puyallup Hill. The claims' combined borders are starting from the north and moving clockwise. The North border is now the 88th hundred block. The East border is now 24th Avenue E. jogging over at 96th to Swan creek, and south to 104th Street E. The South border is now 104th Street E. jogging over at 14th Avenue E to roughly 109th Street E. and west to Golden Given Road E. The West border is now Golden Given Road E. Golden Given Road E is also the east border of the Jessie Dunlap Donation Land Claim with the north and south borders roughly the same as the combined Meeker claims. Ezra talked of how his three closest neighbors were connected by a road and trails. The forest was so tall and thick that it was impossible to see any of the neighbors' houses. Come night it was impossible to see for the stars and moon could not penetrate the tree canopy. A few years after the local uprising of the native populace more commonly known as the Indian War of 1855 & 56 and the death of his brother Oliver while on a family business trip in San Francisco, Ezra became disenchanted with his claim and in 1862 moved to Puyallup. Years later with the claims finally secured from the government both by Ezra and Oliver‚Äôs wife Amanda, the claims were then sold. In September 1888, Joesephus S. Howell and Dr. Charles H. Spinning developed both claims into lots with streets, the Plat of Southeast Tacoma. The water company that served the area for many years prior to Tacoma Power & Water was named after this plat, the Southeast Tacoma Mutual Water Company. 97th Street E, also known in the past as Mount Tacoma Drive, was originally platted as Division Avenue. It was also the dividing line between Ezra‚Äôs and Oliver‚Äôs claims. North from Division the streets that run from east to west were North 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Street. South of Division was South 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Street. Streets that ran from north to south were named after the presidents of the United States, and most of these streets retained their presidents‚Äô names well into the 20th century. The changes to the current numbered streets took place when Pierce County updated its addressing system for the 1982 Enhanced 911 Emergency Dispatch system. Within a year of the Southeast Tacoma Plat, a Railroad and Trolley would come to the area. The western part of the Washington Territory became the State of Washington on 11 November 1889. One railroad was already here and others wanting to come. Land speculation was riding high and it was no different for the Midland area. In 1889 three Railroads came to this area, well, at least on paper, and they secured their rights of way. This was the Tacoma Puyallup Railway, Tacoma Eastern Railroad, and the Portland & Puget Sound Railroad. The first was the Tacoma Puyallup Railway incorporated by a man named Randolph Foster Radebaugh. R.F. Radebaugh came to Tacoma from San Francisco in 1880 and was one of Tacoma‚Äôs best promoters from the very start. He was the father of the Daily Ledger, Tacoma‚Äôs first daily newspaper. In 1889 Randolph put together the street car line, named the Tacoma and Fern Hill Railway for the area it served. Later within the same year, that line was extended into Midland and on towards Puyallup. The name was changed to Tacoma Puyallup Railway. If you lived in Tacoma or on the hill, the line was generally referred to as the Puyallup Hill Line. If you lived in Puyallup it was affectionately called the Grapevine Line. Later, Puyallup was served by another railway called the Short Line. So then, the old line became the Old Grapevine Line. This streetcar line was initially powered by a steam dummy on a narrow gauge 40 lb. rail. The steam dummy at the time was an eight-ton locomotive that from the outside looked like a coach rail car. In later years, the rail line became part of Tacoma Railway & Power Company. The line was then converted to standard gauge and electrified. Upon completion of the initial line the last spike was driven by the nephew of Ezra Meeker, Frank Oliver Meeker on June 29, 1890. Frank owned the land near the southwest corner of the newly incorporated City of Puyallup and near where the street car line first entered the city limits. This was also the same area where years later in 1919, the rail lines were washed out, never to be replaced. With the Short Line in place and serving Puyallup from the north, the old line was abandoned up to Woodland and the tracks removed. The communities from Woodland to Tacoma would still be served for a few more years by the Puyallup Hill Line. The second rail line into Midland was that of the Hart brothers‚Äô railroad. Incorporated as Tacoma Eastern Railroad, this was to serve their saw mill operation at 46th St. E. and McKinley. Within a short time it was extended into the forests of the Midland area. On paper the right of way continued out to what is now the 23 hundred block of 112th St. E. This is close to where the Washington State Patrol building is now. Over time the ownership changed and the line was completed to Ashford. By 1905 the line was extended across the river into Lewis County and on into Mineral. Within a few years, the end of the line had reached the logging town of Morton. The third rail line into the area never got past the surveying of the right of way. This was the Portland and Puget Sound Railroad out of Portland, Oregon. This was a disguised Union Pacific rail line. The Union Pacific had been trying to access the Puget Sound region for a number of years. If people got wind of another major railroad coming to town, land prices would escalate. So, a lot of railroad companies would try to hide the fact that a major railroad was coming in. They would disguise themselves as a newly formed, on a shoestring budget-type railroad. In actuality, by 1889 the Union Pacific Rail Road was having genuine financial difficulties and was on a shoe string budget anyway. In 1890 Jay Gould and John D. Rockefeller pooled their money and gained control of the Union Pacific, halting further progress of the Portland and Puget Sound Rail Road. However, after the death of Jay Gould and some years later, the plans for the Union Pacific to gain access to the Puget Sound Region were revived, under the new name of the Oregon & Washington Rail Road, later changed to the Oregon & Washington Railroad & Navigation Company. In the beginning, with multiple speculated routes, the Union Pacific was serious enough to start digging tunnels in the hills of both major cities: Tacoma and Seattle. Before the tunnels could be finished an agreement was made with Northern Pacific to use the water line route and gain access to Tacoma through the Bennett Tunnel that runs under Pt. Defiance. This, however, did not stop any rumors of the Union Pacific building their shops in the Midland area using the old Portland and Puget Sound right of way. \\"Midland\\" first shows up in writing on the Midland Townsite Plat of 1890, by the Olympic Land Company. The Plat‚Äôs northern border is 104th St. E. from the 14 hundred block on the west to a half block east of 26th Ave. E. This street was named \\"Achilles\\" (104th St. E.), and was also the southern border of the Southeast Tacoma Plat from the year before. The North/South street names followed suit with Southeast Tacoma Plat(president‚Äôs names). Where there were extra streets, they were named after trees. The southern border is 112th St E with the 14 hundred block on the west to just past 22nd Ave E, then north to the 107 hundred block, and West to half a block east of 26th Ave. E. This puts Midland Elementary School in the Northeast area of the plat, Ford Middle school in the Northwest corner of the plat and Franklin Pierce High School in the Southwest corner of the plat. The consensus of the people in the area has always been that Midland was named for the midpoint of the Old Trolley Line. The actual midpoint centers on 97th St E. and Portland Avenue, almost a ¬Ω mile nearer to Tacoma from the townsite plat where Midland school is located. When comparing dates, the town site of the Midland Plat was signed and notarized on the 10th of April 1890. Frank Meeker drove the customary last spike on June 29, 1890, making the track still under construction when the plat was signed. Because the Plat of Midland was close to the center of the street car line, it is most likely that the Midland Townsite was named by its planners for the midpoint of the new trolley line. In 1900, the centralized community of Midland was centered on the corner of Achilles (also known as Summit Road) and Van Buren St. known today as 104th St E. and Portland Ave E. The Midland Community of today now centers closer to the actual midpoint of the old trolley Line at 99th St E. and Portland Ave.Compiled from the following: *Ox-Team Days on the Oregon Trail, by Ezra Meeker *Pioneer Reminiscences of Puget Sound - The Tragedy of Leschi, by Ezra Meeker *Puget‚Äôs Sound, by Murray Morgan *Origins, by Gary Fuller Reese *Tacoma Daily Ledger *Puyallup a Pioneer Paradise, by Lori Price and Ruth Anderson *Puget‚Äôs Sound, by Murray Morgan *Railroadman, by Clauncey Del France *Orphan Railroad, by Kurt E.

As of the 2010 census, the city's population is 7,983. History The first recorded claims for land in Orting were made in 1854 by William Henry Whitesell, Thomas Headley, Daniel Lane, and Daniel Varner. Streets in the modern city are named after the four men, and a monument in Orting City Park commemorates them. Orting was officially incorporated as a city on April 22, 1889. Early growth surrounded the area's production and logging industries. Later, Christmas tree and bulb farms also became part of the local economy. Orting was also a supply town for the coal mining towns Wilkeson and Carbonado. The first railroad in the city was built in 1877 by the Northern Pacific Railway, called \\"Whitesell's Crossing\\" because it ran right through the Whitesell property. Because railroads eased transportation, Orting's population quickly increased. Remaining parts from the railroad are part of the Meeker Southern Railroad, which runs between Puyallup and McMillin. Geography Its coordinates are (47.096071, ‚àí122.205401). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Mount Rainier Mount Rainier as seen from the High Cedars Golf Course in Orting, bordering the Puyallup River The city sits in a fertile valley between two major rivers, the Carbon and Puyallup. It is built entirely on several layers of lahar deposits. Orting is located about from Mount Rainier. Based on studies of past lahar flow and the mountain's structure, Orting has been designated the most at-risk city from Mount Rainier's lahar activity; scientists predict that lahar could reach Orting in 30 minutes from the mountain. The Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System has installed sirens throughout the area, activated by sensors on Mount Rainier. Local schools regularly stage lahar evacuation drills, and residents are informed of lahar escape routes. Local citizens are designing the Bridge for Kids, a walking bridge across the Carbon River that could be used for recreation and rapid evacuation toward Cascadia, Washington.

It had a population of 37,022 at the 2010 Census, with the Washington State Office of Financial Management estimating an increase to 42,361 as of 2019. The city's name comes from the Puyallup Tribe of Native Americans and means \\"the generous people\\". Puyallup is also home to the Washington State Fair, the state's largest fair. History Ezra Meeker (near lower right) at the 1926 dedication of his own statue by Alonzo Victor Lewis in Puyallup's Pioneer Park, on the site of his original cabin The Puyallup Valley was originally inhabited by the Puyallup people, known in their language as the spuyal…ôpab≈°, meaning \\"generous and welcoming behavior to all people (friends and strangers) who enter our lands.\\" The first white settlers in the region were part of the first wagon train to cross the Cascade Range at Naches Pass in 1853. Native Americans numbered about 2,000 in what is now the Puyallup Valley in the 1830s and 1840s. The first European settlers arrived in the 1850s. In 1877, Ezra Meeker platted a townsite and named it Puyallup after the local Puyallup Indian tribes, 11 years after departing from Indiana. The town grew rapidly throughout the 1880s, in large part thanks to Meeker's hop farm, which brought in millions of dollars to Puyallup, leading to it eventually being incorporated in 1890, with Ezra Meeker as its first mayor. The turn of the 20th century brought change to the valley with the growth of nearby Tacoma and the interurban rail lines. The Western Washington Fairgrounds were developed giving local farmers a place to exhibit their crops and livestock. During the early part of World War II, the fairgrounds were part of Camp Harmony, a temporary Japanese American internment camp for more than 7,000 detainees, most of whom were American citizens. Subsequently, they were moved to the Minidoka relocation center near Twin Falls, Idaho. Geography Puyallup is located at (47.1757,-122.2936). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water, mainly consisting of the Puyallup River estuary. Puyallup is 12.2 mi2 (31.6 km2). As it is bordered largely by unincorporated Pierce County, the closest neighbors include the city of Sumner to the northeast, Fife and Edgewood to the north, Tacoma to the northwest, Summit and Midland to the west, South Hill, Graham and Frederickson to the south, McMillin and Orting to the southeast, and Alderton to the east. Downtown and the valley neighborhoods of Puyallup would likely be damaged or destroyed in a moderate or large eruption of nearby Mount Rainier. Climate Puyallup experiences an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen classification: Csb; Trewartha classification: Do). Winters are cool and wet, with high temperatures averaging in the mid to upper 40s and lows near freezing. The surrounding hills (averaging 500 feet (150 m) above sea level) often experience the extremes of winter, with more frequent lows below freezing and greater snowfall. Snowfall is rare, and often only occurs on a few days a year, sometimes as early as November, and as late as April. Spring brings less rain and milder temperatures, with highs regularly in the mid 50s (12‚Äì14 ¬∞C), to around 60 (15 ¬∞C). Spring often records the first 70 ¬∞F (21 ¬∞C) temperature. Summers are warm and dry, with highs in the 70s most days. Many days can max out in the 80s, and occasionally the 90s. Readings above 100 ¬∞F (37.7 ¬∞C) are very rare; on July 29, 2009, during a prolonged period of hot weather, Puyallup recorded a temperature of 105 ¬∞F (40.5 ¬∞C), the warmest since records have been kept. Summer thunderstorms happen occasionally, but are often isolated and rarely (if ever) severe. Storms often roll off the Cascades and into the surrounding areas; they are usually a result of warm moist air from monsoons in the southwestern United States. Summer is warmest in July and August, and occasionally September. By October and the fall season, temperatures start to drop and precipitation increases.

Culture=Puyallup valley The valley in which Puyallup was originally settled forms the town. Its fertile soil is optimal for the acres of daffodils which were grown for distribution worldwide, and are featured in the town's annual spring parade. The Puyallup River meanders between the hills, through the glacial basin, from its namesake glacier on Mt. Rainier, terminating in Puget Sound at the Port of Tacoma. It is cold, silty, and brown, sometimes green. From most perspectives in the town of Puyallup, Mt. Rainier is visible to the southeast. Downtown Puyallup has several notable landmarks, including Ezra Meeker's mansion, which was built and inhabited by one of the town's founding families, who made their way to Puyallup via the Oregon trail. The downtown shopping district is made up of historic buildings, which date to the town's origin. Pioneer Park is a community focal point, which boasts a public library, a park with a playground, and walking paths. As the focal point of the park, there is a bronze statue honoring Ezra Meeker. A new element is the public stage by the public library. At the public stage local musicians put on free shows for the public. Southeast Puyallup is also where the Pierce County Foothills Trail begins. Ezra Meeker's mansion Ezra Meeker Mansion in 2015 The Ezra Meeker Mansion is an Italianate Victorian building completed around 1890, which was the home of Oregon Trail pioneer Ezra Meeker and his wife Eliza Jane. Known as the ‚ÄúHop King‚Äù, Meeker ultimately lost a fortune due to a disease in the hops. He became well known for tracking the Oregon Trail over the years and erecting monuments along its course in an effort to memorialize it. The mansion functions today as a small house museum owned and operated by the Puyallup Historical Society at Meeker Mansion (formerly the Ezra Meeker Historical Society). The building can also be rented out for weddings, teas and other social events. Washington State Fair Puyallup is home to the Washington State Fair. It is one of the ten largest U.S. state fairs, attracting over one million people each year. The city itself is built around the Puyallup Fairgrounds, which can be seen prominently from neighboring South Hill. The fair traditionally runs for 21 days in September; there is also a \\"Spring Fair\\" which takes place for four days in April. The fair serves as an anchor for local businesses and restaurants. Previously named the \\"Puyallup Fair\\", it received its current name in 2013. \\"Do the Puyallup\\" has been its long-standing promotional slogan. During World War II, the Puyallup Fairgrounds became the Puyallup Assembly Area (euphemistically referred to as \\"Camp Harmony\\") and were used as an internment camp for United States citizens or residents of Japanese descent or origin. Daffodil Festival parade Puyallup also hosts and is origin of the annual four-part Daffodil Parade, which takes place every year in Tacoma, Puyallup, Sumner, and Orting. The parade includes many groups and has many floats, most of which are covered in daffodils, or are themed in the daffodil season. Most of the local junior high and high school marching bands also march. Car clubs, veteran groups and also some businesses are a part of the parade. Antique district East side of 100 block of S. Meridian; in foreground, an antique shop in a former J.C. Penney. Puyallup is known for its myriad antiques stores, many of which are located next to each other on the main north-south street of Meridian.

Roy was one of the early communities in the area, a prosperous boom-town and a major stop on the railroad line. But 3 major blows reduced this once-thriving town to its current form. A major fire in 1929 wiped out most of the downtown businesses just before the Depression started. The railroad eventually discontinued using Roy as a main stop. The Army annexed most of the surrounding land to the north and west, limiting expansion and the local tax base, and erasing the nearby community of Loveland.

The population was 749 at the 2010 census. Although it is nearly indistinguishable from the adjacent city of Tacoma, the predominantly residential area still retains its status as a separate municipality long after it ceased to be a company town. The local government opted to reclassify Ruston as a city in late 2012. History In 1890 industrialist W.R. Rust established Tacoma Smelting & Refining Company and a company town for his employees, naming the place \\"Smelter\\". On October 22, 1906, residents voted to change the name to Ruston, in honor of Mr. Rust. Ruston was officially incorporated on November 10, 1906. It is surrounded on one side by Commencement Bay and all other sides the city of Tacoma. The primary industry for decades was the ASARCO copper smelting plant on the waterfront. The smelter and its landmark smokestack, however, were demolished in 1993. A massive Superfund cleanup at the site has been underway since the early 1990s. This area has been renamed \\"Point Ruston\\", as a large residential and commercial center on the waterfront is under construction as of 2017, which could add over 1,000 residents to the city. The Ruston town council passed a measure to become a noncharter code city under Washington law in late 2012. Officials indicated that the \\"Town of Ruston\\" moniker will continue to be used, however. Mixed use buildings containing movie theater, stores, and apartments, constructed 2008-ongoing.

The population was 27,227 at the 2010 census. Spanaway is an unincorporated area near Tacoma, and is often identified together with the more urban, less wealthy Parkland. Spanaway's main business thoroughfare is Pacific Avenue South, which is a north‚Äìsouth road that coincides with State Route 7 through the Spanaway area. The song \\"The Needle Has Landed\\" from Neko Case's album Fox Confessor Brings the Flood mentions Spanaway in passing. Tacoma alternative pop/rock band Seaweed also released an album entitled Spanaway. Long Island, New York band The Movielife also has a song called \\"Spanaway\\". History Etymology: The Hudson's Bay Company, headquartered at Fort Nisqually, had control of this region until 1863. Company maps and journals show the company's subsidiary, the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company, raised cattle, grain, and sheep at \\"Spanueh Station\\" on the south and east shores of \\"Spanueh Lake.\\" Spanueh is the Hudson Bay Company's spelling of the native Lushootseed spadue, which means \\"dug roots\\" referring to an area where camas and other edible roots can be found. Lushootseed underwent a loss of nasal consonants in the 1800s, so \\"Spanueh\\" simply transcribes an older pronunciation of what is now \\"Spadue\\". The first white settler to take a donation claim by the lake, Henry de la Bushalier, tried to rename the lake after himself. That faded away with his death one year later. In 1890 the area was renamed \\"Lake Park\\" as a planned community by the Lake Park Land, Railway and Improvement Company, which bought all the nearby land east of the lake and built a rail line to its \\"recreation mecca\\" on the shore of \\"Spanaway Lake.\\" When Mount Rainier National Park was established in 1899, tourists would take the train to its terminus in Lake Park and from there make the two-day journey to Mount Rainier, making Spanaway the original \\"gateway\\" to Mount Rainier. The journey was made by stagecoach, with an overnight stop in Eatonville; the route was in operation as early as 1893.http://earlyeatonvillewa.blogspot.com/p/settlement-of-eatonville-prior- to.html Early Eatonville Although the U.S. Board on Geographic Names recognized the community of \\"Lake Park\\" in 1897, it had to very belatedly reverse its decision in 1970 to accept common usage: Spanaway (Spanueh).

The population was 477 at the 2010 census. History Downtown Wilkeson Holy Trinity Orthodox Church, built 1900, is a legacy of the many Eastern Europeans who came to work in the mines and quarries around Wilkeson. Wilkeson was officially incorporated on July 18, 1909 and boasts an elementary school building dating from 1909. The town is named for Samuel Wilkeson, father of journalist and pioneer settler Frank Wilkeson. The following passage is from an online biography of Frank Wilkeson: \\"[In] his 1869 report of the Cascades mountain range, Frank [Wilkeson]'s father, Samuel, wrote: 'these forests of trees ‚Äî so enchain the senses of the grand and so enchant the sense of the beautiful that I linger on the theme and am loathe to depart ‚Äî surpassing the woods of all the rest of the globe...' Like many writers of that time, Samuel indulged in hyperbole, but his love of the Cascades seems very genuine. Sometime in the period of 1876-78, four large coal veins were discovered and mined near a region known as Carbonado in the Cascade foothills. A small village formed and was named for Samuel after NP extended a rail line there from Tacoma in 1877. He was appointed secretary of the NP board in March 1869. The area became well known for its coal coking ovens as well as the natural sandstone formations that were the source of material for facing the new capitol in Olympia. At one time the town of Wilkeson had a population of about 3,000, but today it hovers around 400. Many of the same principals of the Wilkeson operation built the coking ovens at Cokedale, about 80 miles north in Skagit County, which led to the creation of the town of Sedro, now Sedro- Woolley. As far as we can determine, neither Frank nor any member of his family actually ever lived in the namesake town, but his brother, Samuel G. Wilkeson, invested substantially in coal companies that operated there.Abandoned coal works in Wilkeson. \\"Frank's father died in 1889 but by then another Wilkeson was investing financially in the Puget Sound: Samuel Gansevoort Wilkeson, Frank's older brother. Samuel G. first came to Tacoma in 1873, the year that town was chosen as the terminus for the Northern Pacific. He was a contemporary of Tacoma boomer Leonard Howarth and became wealthy in his activities with the same companies as Howarth ‚Äî the St. Paul & Tacoma Lumber Co. and the Wilkeson Coal & Coke Co. That company mined coking coal in the town of Wilkeson, the town near Enumclaw that was named to honor Frank's and Sam's father.\\" There are still several existing relics from Wilkeson's mining past, including bee hive coke ovens, a gated mine shaft on the other side of Wilkeson Creek and an abandoned concrete coal works.http://www.townofwilkeson.com/sample-page/wilkeson-coke-ovens/ Wilkeson hosts the annual Handcar Races on the third Saturday of July.http://www.townofwilkeson.com/sample-page/wilkeson-national-handcar- races/ Geography Near the towns of Buckley and Carbonado, Wilkeson is located at (47.107066, -122.048263).

The town's name originates from Joseph Poalie Friday, a native Hawaiian. Friday worked at the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company's Fort Cowlitz, from 1841 to 1859‚Äì60 and later moved north to San Juan Island, raising and herding sheep around the harbor. After the peaceful settlement obtained following the Pig War, the San Juan Islands became a separate county in 1873. Friday Harbor was named the county seat. Friday Harbor was officially incorporated on February 10, 1909. It remains the only incorporated town in the San Juan Islands. Sailing ships, and later, the steamships of the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet, visited the harbor on a regular basis hauling passengers, mail and freight. Freight from the island would include apples, pears, cherries, strawberries, peas, cream, eggs, chickens, grain, salmon, and lime. All were produced on or around San Juan Island. The Great Depression, World War II, the pea weevil, and competition from Eastern Washington growers brought about the decline of traditional island industries, diminishing Friday Harbor's export trade. The 1970s brought new industries - tourism, retirement, real estate, and construction. Today, Friday Harbor is again busy and prosperous. Osamu Shimomura harvested jellyfish from the docks of the harbor. Eventually he purified the proteins that allow the jellyfish to fluoresce green when exposed to blue light. One of them, green fluorescent protein, is now widely used as a marker of molecular activity.

Rosario Strait and the San Juan Islands are to the West while to the South, Deception Pass separates Fidalgo and Whidbey Islands. To the East, the Swinomish Channel separates Fidalgo Island from the mainland. The weather is milder than other areas of the Pacific Northwest, because it lies within the Olympic Mountain rain shadow. Fidalgo Island gets 21 inches of rain per year, only half as much as Seattle. First known as Ship Harbor, Anacortes was established with a name and a post office in 1879 in the vain hope that it would be selected as the western terminus of the transcontinental railroad.

The population was 705 at the 2010 census. The town of Concrete is included in the Mount Vernon-Anacortes, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area. Early history This Boy's Life The town of Concrete has undergone several incarnations, the earliest being a settlement at the northwestern junction of the Baker and Skagit Rivers, known as \\"Minnehaha.\\" Amasa \\"Peg-Leg\\" Everett was one of the earliest settlers and in 1890, the townsite was platted by another settler, Magnus Miller. Shortly thereafter, a post office was established and the town name changed to \\"Baker.\\" In 1905, a settlement across the Baker River came into being due to the building of the Washington Portland Cement Company and was named \\"Cement City.\\" After the Superior Portland Cement Company plant was built in Baker in 1908, it was decided to merge the two towns. Inhabitants of the new community settled on the name \\"Concrete\\" and the town was so christened and officially incorporated on May 8, 1909.\\"Skagit Settlers: Trials and Triumphs, 1890‚Äì1920\\", Published by Skagit County Historical Society, 1975 Notable buildings and landmarks The town of Concrete is home to many old and original buildings, as well as a couple of engineering milestones:All information on these buildings and landmarks have been referenced from the local history book, \\"So They Called The Town Concrete,\\" written by Charles M.

Henry Thompson Bridge Henry Thompson Bridge Built in 1916‚Äì1918 and so named for the Scottish immigrant, local settler, and Skagit County Commissioner who promoted its construction. The naming occurred after Henry Thompson was killed by a logging train in 1918. At the time, its graceful arch was the longest single-span reinforced concrete bridge in the worldThe Concrete Herald, October 16, 1968 or perhaps just in the West and has been listed on the Washington State and National Historic Register since 1976. Until 1972, when the Washington State Department of Transportation re-routed Highway 20 (then known as Star Route 20) outside the town, the Thompson Bridge was the only connecting thoroughfare across the Baker River and into eastern Skagit County. The bridge was originally designed by Bowerman and McCloy Consulting Engineers of Seattle, and built by J.R. Wood Contractors also of Seattle. It underwent a complete rehabilitation in 2003-2004. The engineer for the rehabilitation was Entranco, Inc. of Bellevue, Washington (who has since been acquired by AECOM) and the contractor for the rehabilitation was One Way Construction of Sedro-Woolley, Washington. Concrete High School Concrete High School Concrete High School was built in 1952. Constructed with the typical and necessary scholastic appointments and one visible and unusual difference: the central portion of the building was built over the road leading to it. To make the best use of the property, South Superior Avenue passes beneath the building. The building replaced the previous high school building in the center of town. The hallways and the wood shop were used during the filming of the Michael Caton-Jones film, This Boy's Life in 1993. Concrete High School's school colors are purple and gold and their team mascot is the Lion.

Concrete Herald building Concrete Herald Building Located in the heart of Concrete Town Center on Main Street, the Concrete Herald Building was originally built in 1918 as a Model T Ford garage complete with a gas-station out front. When the building was later converted to be the Brommer Logging facility, a large apartment was added to the upper story. It was shortly after this that Concrete Herald owner and editor Charles M. \\"Chuck\\" Dwelley took over the building and made it into a modern printing facility and new home of The Concrete Herald (established in 1910). When Robert and June Fader purchased the newspaper upon Dwelley's retirement in late 1970, the building remained the home for the weekly. When the building and newspaper were sold in 1990, the facility became a printing shop until the current owners turned the first floor into a liquor store franchise through the state liquor control board. The Concrete Herald Building has remained a liquor store to this date. As for Concrete Herald, Concrete Mayor Jason Miller has given rebirth to the newspaper after purchasing the Upriver Community News from another local resident. As of May 6, 2009, Concrete Herald began a monthly publication schedule. The newspaper is sold in various locations throughout Skagit County. Town Hall Concrete's Town Hall Originally built in 1908 as a grade-school, this wooden, clapboard building was originally located on Main Street across from the bank where classes were taught until 1910. When the building was no longer used as a schoolhouse, it was moved to its present location on West Main Street, next to the current post office. In its present location, the building has served alternately as a library, senior-citizen center, the city's current town hall with a satellite office for the Skagit County Sheriff's Department. Concrete Theatre Originally built in 1923, the stage of the Concrete Theatre has entertained audiences with vaudeville, boxing matches, silent films and later what were known as \\"the talkies\\".

Flooding As part of the Skagit River floodway, the town of Hamilton faces significant flooding every few years, most notably in 2003, 2006, and 2017. The frequent flooding has forced residents to adopt a routine of moving their furniture from the ground floor and evacuating to a local church until the waters recede. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimates it has spent $4.6 million in the town over the last several years. Support has been building for a plan to move the entire town to a nearby hill. The Hamilton Public Development Authority was established in 2004 to purchase the land necessary for moving the town, which was achieved with assistance from conservation group Forterra in 2018. Forterra purchased a farm north of State Route 20, which it aims to develop into a green city with housing for the relocated townspeople.

The population was 31,743 at the 2010 census. It is one of two principal cities of and included in the Mount Vernon-Anacortes, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area. Downtown Mount Vernon is known for its annual Tulip Festival Street Fair, which is part of the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival. The climate of Skagit County is similar to that of Northern France, with millions of tulips grown in the Skagit Valley. In 1998, Mount Vernon was rated the #1 \\"Best Small City in America\\" by the New Rating Guide to Life in America's Small Cities. History=Early days Mount Vernon in 1880 Jasper Gates and Joseph Dwelley first settled on the banks of the Skagit River, where the city of Mount Vernon now lies, in 1870. Later on, Harrison Clothier came to the community in 1877 to teach school and join in business with a former student, E.G. English. They were later recognized as the city's founders and pioneer businessmen. A post office was established in November 1877 with Clothier appointed postmaster. The city was named after Mount Vernon, the plantation estate and resting place of George Washington. The two men laid out the city's first plan while the area was still heavily timbered.An Illustrated history of Skagit and Snohomish Counties : their people, their commerce and their resources : with an outline of the early history of the state of Washington. Chicago, Illinois: Interstate Publishing Company, 1906. Print. Mount Vernon's first industry was logging; camps were set up to log the townsite. The community grew quickly following the loggers, and hotels and saloons opened up along the Skagit River next to English & Clothiers' store. While poised to grow, river access to the community was stymied by a massive and ancient log jam in the river which prevented large ships from being able to port. Mail carriers instead had to paddle canoes down-stream to nearby Skagit City. The mining activity at nearby Ruby Creek spurred growth for a short time in 1880, gaining the city a new hotel, but little else was accomplished when the mines proved to be shallow. More logging operations were established but were not profitable due to the low price of logs at the time. By 1881, Mount Vernon's permanent population was 75. Growth in the 1880s was steady. In 1882, the Odd Fellows Lodge was established, followed by the first newspaper in 1884, The Skagit News. The first church, Baptist, was also established in 1884 but wouldn't build a permanent building for several years. In November 1884, Mount Vernon's future was secured when it was chosen for the new Skagit County seat, taking the designation from La Conner. The Odd fellows building, built the following year, served the county's needs until a permanent building was built. Railroad and growth into the 20th century Mount Vernon's growth was helped by its central location in reference to the mining, logging and farming communities of the eastern and central parts of the county as well as its access to Puget Sound. The only thing it was lacking was a railroad connection to the outside world, especially, Everett, Seattle and Vancouver, B.C.. A committee was appointed in 1889 to negotiate with railroads on line placement. Their efforts paid off when the Great Northern Railway agreed to lay their line through the city. This was completed in 1891. The city was also in the process of convincing the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway to come to Mt. Vernon. This deal fell through after the railroad was acquired by Northern Pacific Railway who chose to lay tracks further east through Sedro- Woolley in 1896. The railroad's arrival caused great commotion in Mount Vernon, bringing hundreds of new businesses and residents. Mount Vernon was officially incorporated on July 5, 1893. That same year, a large brick courthouse was built on Main street, which still stands today. Due to the area's stable economy, Mount Vernon never boomed in the 1890s like many other speculative settlements in the region, all vying for a railroad terminus. The city experienced its first of many fires in 1891 when several blocks along the waterfront were destroyed. The same year the city's riverfront eroded taking away Front Street and the west side of Main Street.\\"The History of Mount Vernon Washington From the City of Mount Vernon 2005 Comprehensive Plan\\" Downtown and Waterfront Master Plan-June 11, 2008 Live Mount Vernon website Retrieved 30 November 2017. The boost from the railroad's construction quickly replaced these buildings. 1891 also saw the construction of several large civic structures such as a large brick schoolhouse on the hill above the city as well as the Mount Vernon Opera House, designed by Peacock & Dalton. Growth slowed considerably after the Panic of 1893. Following a large flood in 1894, the first dike was built along the Skagit River. Another great fire in 1900 wiped out all of Mount Vernon's original structures including English & Clothiers' store and the Ruby Hotel. Fire would destroy more downtown businesses in 1903. The city finally received a water system in 1902 after a failed attempt in 1894. Later events and transportation The city again grew in the 1910s when it became the southern terminus for the Bellingham & Skagit Railway's interurban railroad line, which would carry passengers as well as freight between Bellingham and Mount Vernon as well as Burlington and Sedro-Woolley. The line opened on August 31, 1912, with passenger trips to Bellingham every two hours during the day and freight operating at night. Mount Vernon business owners soon began pressuring the railway company, since renamed the Pacific Northwest Traction Company, to extend the rails south to connect with the interurban line in Everett. Plagued by a weakening economy, the onset of America's entrance into World War I in 1917, and numerous infrastructure failures that led to line closures for months at a time, extension of the interurban was put off indefinitely. The completion of the Pacific Highway between Seattle and Bellingham in 1920 posed a great threat to the still incomplete interurban line. After a series of accidents and bridge wash outs, passenger service on the money-losing line was permanently suspended in June 1930. In 1969, Interstate 5 was built through downtown, severing it from most of the residential district and opening the farm lands north of the city to urban development, where many of Mount Vernon's downtown businesses moved. Notable buildings left The Historic Lincoln Theatre on First Street in downtown Mount Vernon was originally built in 1926 as a vaudeville and silent movie house. Through the early 1980s, the Lincoln was a movie theater showing first-run films and now hosts live theatrical performances and concerts while also showcasing classic, as well as contemporary, movies year-round. The Lincoln is one of only 98 theaters in the United States that still possesses its original Wurlitzer theatre organ, which is often played prior to a show.Historical Information Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Climate Like much of the Pacific Northwest, according to the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Vernon falls within a cool dry-summer subtropical zone (Csb), with \\"cool\\"-summer Mediterranean characteristics. Other sources classify it as belonging in the marine west coast climate (K√∂ppen Cfb) zone, with cool, wet winters and warm, distinctly drier summers. Flood control and waterfront redevelopment The Skagit River, which flows through Mount Vernon, is prone to flooding during periods of heavy rain in the Cascades. In October 2003 the townspeople of Mount Vernon turned out to build a sandbag dike along the river in anticipation of a flood. Since this city was founded, the downtown area of Mount Vernon bordering the Skagit River has been plagued by flooding, especially during times of heavy rain. Each time the water rises above a certain level, citizens historically had to join to build a sandbag wall that stretches six city blocks and can be as high as . In the spring of 2007, the city council authorized the mayor to purchase a mobile flood wall from Norway- based company AquaFence, the first such flood wall sold in the United States. The flood wall is high and can be assembled in as little as three hours by a handful of volunteers as opposed to the up to 12 hours and hundreds of volunteers required by the traditional sandbag wall. The flood wall completed in 2019. After adequate flood control is in place, a Citizens' Advisory Committee plans to enhance the city's use of the revetment, which is currently used mostly for parking and a seasonal farmer's market. Current plans call for a promenade with condos or mixed-use development facing the river. A two- or three-story parking garage is planned to replace the revetment parking lost due to development. During Thanksgiving 2017 the city, as well as Lyman and Hamilton, experienced flooding.Boer, Katie. (24 November 2017). \\"Highest river level in decades puts Mt.

It is part of the Mount Vernon-Anacortes, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area and had a population of 10,540 at the 2010 census. The city is home to North Cascades National Park. History Sedro-Woolley in 1906 Officially incorporated on December 19, 1898, Sedro-Woolley was formed from neighboring rival towns known as Bug and Woolley in Skagit County, northwestern Washington, inland from the Puget Sound, south of the border with Canada and north of Seattle. Four British bachelors, led by David Batey, homesteaded the area in 1878, the time logjam obstructions were cleared downriver at the site of Mount Vernon. In 1884‚Äì85, Batey built a store and home for the arrival of the Mortimer Cook family from Santa Barbara, California where Cook had been mayor for two terms. Cook intended to name his new Pacific Northwest town Bug due to the number of mosquitos present, but his wife protested along with a handful of other local wives. Cook was already the namesake for the town Cook's Ferry on the Thompson River in British Columbia. With \\"Bug\\" being so unpopular, Cook derived a town name from Spanish; knowing \\"cedro\\" was the word for cedar, he replaced one letter to make the name unique, settling on \\"Sedro\\". Sedro, on the northern banks of the Skagit River, proved susceptible to floods. In 1889, Northern Pacific Railway developer Nelson Bennett began laying track from the town of Fairhaven, northwest on Bellingham Bay, and real estate developer Norman R. Kelley platted a new town of Sedro on high ground a mile northwest of Cook's site. The Fairhaven and Southern Railroad arrived in Sedro on Christmas Eve 1889, in time for Bennett to receive a performance bonus from the towns at both ends, and a month after Washington became the 42nd state in the Union. Within months, two more railroads crossed the F&S; road bed a half mile north of new Sedro, forming a triangle where 11 trains eventually arrived daily. Railroad developer Philip A. Woolley moved his family from Elgin, Illinois, to Sedro in December 1899 and bought land around the triangle. He built the Skagit River Lumber & Shingle Mill next to where the railroads crossed and he started his namesake company town there that was based on sales of railroad ties to the three rail companies, including the Seattle and Northern Railway (forerunner of the Great Northern Railway) and the Northern Pacific Railroad. Shops on Metcalf Street, downtown Sedro- Woolley, May 2009. Meanwhile, a fourth town rose nearby when the F&S; laid rails on a \\"wye\\" that led northeast from Sedro about four and a half miles to coal mines. Bennett bought the mines, along with Montana mining financier Charles X. Larrabee, and they soon sold their interests to James J. Hill, owner of the Great Northern. The resulting ore soon turned out to be more suitable for coking coal and a town began there named Cokedale. Cokedale faded in importance when the mine declined and the other towns all merged on December 19, 1898, as Sedro-Woolley.There are extensive articles about these occurrences and local and Skagit River history at the online Skagit River Journal of History & Folklore (http://www.skagitriverjournal.com/). On May 15, 1922, a large circus elephant known as Tusko escaped from the Al G. Barnes Circus, which was making one of its stops in Sedro-Woolley, at that time. The elephant stomped his way through the little logging town and right into local history, demolishing fences, knocking over laundry lines and trees, telephone poles, and a Model T along the way. After logging and coal-mining declined, the major employers and industries became the nearby Northern State Hospital (a mental-health facility) and Skagit Steel & Iron Works, which rose from the back room of a local hardware store to become a major supplier of implements and parts for logging and railroad customers and which manufactured machines and parts for the war effort in World War II and artillery shells, starting in 1953. By 1990, that company was gone and the hospital was closed but new industry, including robotics and aerospace, is developing north of town and on the campus of the old hospital.

The population was 593 at the 2000 census and 956 at the 2010 census. History The community of North Bonneville developed as a construction town next to the massive Bonneville Lock, Dam, and powerhouse project begun in late 1933. Federal legislation in 1937 also authorized a second Powerhouse, although the need was not then immediate. North Bonneville was officially incorporated on June 25, 1935. The Columbia's north shore where North Bonneville had grown was selected by federal agencies in 1971 as the site for the second Powerhouse. Faced with the prospect of being displaced and disbanded the townspeople determined to relocate as a community. Intense efforts by citizens‚Äô groups and planning assistance from state sources finally led to agreements with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to hire professionals for the design and construction of a new town. Contractors then prepared the chosen town site for the initial community of 600 people as the old town was devoured by the enormous excavation for the new powerhouse. Federal responsibility for the North Bonneville relocation was expanded in 1974 with enactment of Public Law 93-251, referred to as the McCormack legislation. This law specifically broadened the Corps' authority and obligation in relocation assistance to North Bonneville . The $35 million relocation project included raising the new town site above the 100-year flood plain, construction of streets, utilities, lighting, sewage system, water supply and sewage treatment plant, flood protection, parks, a central business district and all public buildings. Town sitting required highway and railway relocation. And residents and business were furnished temporary housing until they could build their own permanent homes and facilities. The new town was built to accommodate 1500 residents. A celebration of the successful relocation was held on July 29, 1978.

The Stevenson family, who settled in the Gorge in the 1800s from Missouri, founded the town of Stevenson on the old Shepard donation land claim. Under the auspices of the Stevenson Land Company, George Stevenson purchased the original town site for $24,000 in 1893, building the town along the lower flat near the river. Settlers expanded the original dock to serve the daily arrivals of sternwheelers unloading passengers, cargo and loading logs. In 1893, in a dispute over rental fees, an unknown crew transported the county records from the town of Cascades to Stevenson. Stevenson became the county seat of Skamania overnight. Stevenson was officially incorporated on December 16, 1907. In 1908 the SP&S; Railroad arrived, pushing the town up the hill away from the river. Streets were graded, wooden sidewalks constructed and the city asked residents to keep their cows from roaming the streets. Geography Stevenson is located at (45.696203, ‚àí121.888424).

The city lies on the Stillaguamish River in the western foothills of the Cascade Range, adjacent to the city of Marysville. It is approximately north of Everett, the county seat, and north of Seattle, the region's largest city. As of the 2010 U.S. census, Arlington has a population of 17,926. Arlington was established in the 1880s by settlers and the area was platted as two towns, Arlington and Haller City. Haller City was absorbed by the larger Arlington, which was incorporated as a city in 1903. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Arlington area was the site of major projects undertaken for employment under the direction of federal relief agencies, including construction of a municipal airport that would serve as a naval air station during World War II. Beginning in the 1980s, Arlington was affected by suburbanization due to the expansion of Seattle, growing by more than 450 percent by 2000 and annexing the unincorporated area of Smokey Point to the southwest. The economy of the Arlington area historically relied on timber and agriculture. In the early 21st century, it has transitioned to a service economy, with some aviation industry jobs near the municipal airport. The city is governed by a mayor‚Äìcouncil government, electing a mayor and seven city councilmembers. The municipal government maintains the city's parks system and water and wastewater utilities. Other services, including public utilities, public transportation, and schools, are contracted to regional or county-level agencies and companies. History=Exploration and settlement Prior to American settlement in the 19th century, the Puget Sound region was inhabited by indigenous Coast Salish peoples. The Stillaguamish and Sauk peoples had prominent camps at the confluence of the two forks of the Stillaguamish River when they followed fish runs; the Stillaguamish named the campsite . Arlington was later developed at this site. They also had a major village at upriver near modern-day Trafton. American exploration of the area began in 1851, when prospector Samuel Hancock was led by Indian guides on a canoe up the Stillaguamish River. The area was opened to logging after the signing of the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855 between the United States government and the Stillaguamish tribe, who were relocated to trust lands and the Tulalip Indian Reservation. The U.S. Army built a military road connecting Fort Steilacoom to Fort Bellingham, crossing the Stillaguamish River near the confluence. In the 1880s, wagon roads were constructed to this area from the towns of Marysville to the south and Silvana to the west, bringing entrepreneurs to the logging camps, informally named \\"The Forks\\". The area's first store was opened in 1888 by Nels K. Tvete and Nils C. Johnson, and was followed by a hotel with lodging and meals for loggers. alt=A map of modern downtown Arlington, with the locations of Arlington and Haller City highlighted. Two settlements were established on the south side of the confluence in anticipation of the Seattle, Lake Shore & Eastern Railroad building a track through the area. G. Morris Haller, son of Colonel Granville O. Haller, founded a settlement on the banks of the Stillaguamish River in 1883, naming it \\"Haller City\\". The Seattle, Lake Shore & Eastern Railroad chose to build its depot on higher ground to the south of Haller City, leading contractors Earl & McLeod to establish a new town at the depot on March 15, 1890. The new town was named \\"Arlington\\" after Lord Henry Arlington, member of the cabinet of King Charles II of England. Arlington and Haller City were platted within a month of each other in 1890, quickly developing a rivalry that would continue for several years. Arlington and Haller City grew rapidly in their first years, reaching a combined population of 500 by 1893, relying on agriculture, dairy farming and the manufacturing of wood shingles as their main sources of income. Both towns established their own schools, post offices, saloons, general stores, churches, social clubs, and hotels. The two towns were separated by a tract claimed by two settlers in 1891, preventing either town from fully absorbing the other. During the late 1890s, the claim dispute was settled and merchants began moving to the larger, more prosperous Arlington, signalling the end for Haller City. Today, Haller City is memorialized in the name of a park in downtown Arlington, as well as a middle school operated by the Arlington School District. Incorporation and early 20th century alt=A small, two- story building with a sign for \\"Arlington Hardware & Lumber\\" facing a city street, joined by similar-sized buildings with business of their own. Arlington was incorporated as a fourth-class city on May 20, 1903, including the remnants of Haller City (located north of modern-day Division Street). The incorporation came after a referendum on May 5, in which 134 of 173 voters approved the city's incorporation. The new city elected shingle mill owner John M. Smith as its first mayor. In the years following incorporation, Arlington gained a local bank, a cooperative creamery, a city park, a library, electricity, and telephone service. During the early 20th century, Arlington's largest employers remained its shingle mills and saw mills. Other industries, including dairy processing, mechanical shops, stores, and factories, became prominent after World War I, during a period of growth for the city. The Great Depression of the 1930s forced all but one of the mills to close, causing unemployment to rise in Arlington and neighboring cities. The federal government established a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp near Darrington to create temporary jobs; the young men built structures and conducted firefighting in the Mount Baker National Forest. The Works Progress Administration and Civil Works Administration funded the construction of the city's sidewalks, a high school, and a municipal airport that opened in 1934. The entry of the United States into World War II brought the U.S. Navy to Arlington, resulting in the conversion of the municipal airport into a naval air station in 1943. The Navy constructed new runways and hangars and, beginning in 1946, the municipal government was allowed to operate civilian and commercial services. Ownership of the airport was formally transferred from the federal government back to the city of Arlington in 1959. On October 19, 1959, a Boeing 707-227 crashed on the banks of the Stillaguamish River's North Fork during a test flight, killing four of eight occupants. The plane, being flown by Boeing test pilots instructing personnel from Braniff International Airways, lost three engines and suffered a fire in the fourth after a dutch roll had been executed beyond maximum bank restrictions. The plane made an emergency landing in the riverbed while unsuccessfully trying to reach a nearby open field. Suburbanization and present day The completion of Interstate 5 and State Route 9 in the late 1960s brought increased residential development in Arlington, forming a bedroom community for commuters who worked in Everett and Seattle. Despite the influx of commuting residents, Arlington retained its small-town image while unsuccessfully attempting to lure new industries and a state college. Suburban housing developments began construction in the 1980s and 1990s, driving a 450 percent increase in Arlington's population to 15,000 by 2007. In 1999, Arlington annexed the community of Smokey Point, located along Interstate 5 to the southwest of the city, after a lengthy court battle with Marysville, which instead was permitted to annex Lakewood to the west. The city began developing a large business park around the municipal airport in the 1990s, bringing the city's number of jobs to a total of 11,000 by 2003. The city of Arlington celebrated its centennial in 2003 with a parade, a festival honoring the city's history, sporting events, and musical and theatrical performances. The centennial celebrations culminated in the dedication of the $44 million Arlington High School campus, attended by an all-class reunion of the old school. In 2007, the city of Arlington renovated six blocks of downtown's Olympic Avenue at a cost of $4.4 million, widening sidewalks, improving street foliage, and adding new street lights. The project was credited with helping revitalize the city's downtown, turning Olympic Avenue into a gathering place for residents and a venue for festivals. On March 22, 2014, a large landslide near Oso dammed the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, with mud and debris covering an area of . A total of 43 people were killed and nearly 50 structures destroyed. The landslide closed State Route 530 to Darrington, cutting the town off, leaving Arlington as the center of the coordinated emergency response to the disaster. Arlington was recognized for its role in aiding victims of the disaster and hosted U.S. President Barack Obama during his visit to the site in April. The city has continued to grow in the late 2010s, with new apartment buildings constructed in Smokey Point, including those designed as retirement communities. The Cascade Industrial Center, located on between Arlington and Marysville, was designated by the Puget Sound Regional Council in 2019 and is planned to house manufacturing and other industrial uses. Geography alt=A small town surrounded by farmland and forestland, crisscrossed by rivers and roads. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Arlington has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city is in the northwestern part of Snohomish County in Western Washington, and is considered part of the Seattle metropolitan area. It is approximately north of Seattle and north of Everett. Arlington's city limits are generally defined to the south by Marysville at State Route 531 (172nd Street NE) and roughly 165th Street NE, to the west by Interstate 5, to the north by the Stillaguamish River valley, and to the east by the Cascade Range foothills. The city's urban growth boundary includes within and outside of city limits. The city lies on a glacial terrace formed during the Pleistocene epoch by the recession of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. Arlington covers a series of hills that sit at an elevation of above sea level. Downtown Arlington is situated on a bluff above the confluence of the Stillaguamish River and its North and South Forks. Most of Arlington sits in the watersheds of the Stillaguamish River, Portage Creek, and Quilceda Creek. From various points in Arlington, the Olympic Mountains, Mount Pilchuck, and Mount Rainier are visible on the horizon. The Stillaguamish River valley and floodplain, including Arlington, lies in a lahar hazard zone downstream from Glacier Peak, an active stratovolcano in the eastern part of the county. During an eruption 13,000 years ago, several eruption-generated lahars deposited more than of sediment on modern-day Arlington. Subareas and neighborhoods The city of Arlington publishes a decennial comprehensive plan, which divides the urban growth area into ten planning subareas, each containing neighborhoods and subdivisions. * Old Town consists of downtown Arlington and surrounding residential neighborhoods built during the early 20th century. The northern reaches of Old Town include commercial areas developed during the post-war period that are distinct from older buildings along Olympic Avenue. * Arlington Bluff is a residential area between the Stillaguamish River floodplain and the Arlington Municipal Airport industrial center. * Kent Prairie, a residential area south of Old Town, was developed in the early post-war period. The subarea also includes retail stores centered around the intersection of State Route 9 and 204th Street NE. The area was once home to a Stillaguamish village, as well as Arlington's first schoolhouse, built in 1884. * The designated Manufacturing Industrial Center is an industrial district southwest of Old Town, surrounding the Arlington Municipal Airport and the city's only active railroad. * Hilltop consists of Arlington's largest planned residential subdivisions, including Gleneagle, Crown Ridge, and the Magnolias. It is south of Kent Prairie on a large terrace on the west side of State Route 9. Gleneagle is Arlington's largest single development, with over 1,000 homes and a private golf course. * The Brekhus/Beach subarea, also known as Burn Hill, is a residential area southeast of Old Town and is centered along Burn Road. The West Arlington Subarea, designated in 2011, combines several neighborhoods annexed by Arlington in the 1990s and 2000s, including Smokey Point and Island Crossing. * Smokey Point, annexed by Arlington in 1999, is a major commercial and residential area at the junction of Interstate 5 and State Route 531, southwest of Arlington. Portions of Smokey Point extend south and west into the city of Marysville, which annexed the area in the 2000s. * Island Crossing, at the junction of Interstate 5 and State Route 530, is a rural community with a cluster of retail stores. It was annexed by Arlington in 2008, and has been re-designated for commercial development. * The proposed King-Thompson subarea is northwest of Smokey Point and lies outside of Arlington's city limits and urban growth boundary. It has been identified as a potential area for extensive residential development. The municipal government applied to annex the area into the city's urban growth area in 2013, but withdrew the application in 2016. Climate Arlington has a general climate similar to most of the Puget Sound lowlands, with dry summers and mild, rainy winters moderated by a marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. The majority of the region's precipitation arrives during the winter and early spring, and Arlington averages 181 days of precipitation per year. Arlington's location in the foothills of the Cascade Range brings additional precipitation compared to nearby communities, with annually compared to in Everett.

Arlington's early economy relied heavily on timber harvesting and processing, notably the production of red cedar wood shingles at mills that closed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Locally, Arlington was known as the \\"Shingle Capital of the World\\", although mills in Everett and Ballard produced more shingles at the time. Agriculture and dairy farming emerged as significant industries to Arlington during the early 20th century, with farms lining the floodplain of the Stillaguamish River. A major cooperative creamery and condensery was established in Arlington during the 1910s, but later moved to Mount Vernon after World War II. The transformation of Arlington into a bedroom community for Everett and Seattle during the 1980s and 1990s came with it a move towards a service economy. Among the largest employers of Arlington residents are the Boeing Everett Factory and Naval Station Everett. The expansion of the aerospace industry in the Seattle region led Arlington to develop its own municipal airport into an aerospace job center, which includes a high concentration of Boeing subcontractors. , the airport has 130 on-site businesses that employ 590 people, with an annual economic output of $94.5 million. The city of Arlington plans to increase the number of jobs within the city to over 20,000 by 2035, bolstered by the designation of the Cascade Industrial Center by the Puget Sound Regional Council in 2019. The industrial center, located between the two cities near Smokey Point, already includes major distribution centers and other light industry. Government and politics alt=A two-story, white building with large windows at the corner of two streets. Arlington is defined as a non-charter code city and operates under a mayor‚Äìcouncil government, with an elected mayor and an elected city council. The mayor serves a four-year term and has no term limits. The current mayor of Arlington is Barbara Tolbert, who was elected in 2011 and re-elected in 2015 and 2019.

According to the Washington State Auditor, Arlington's municipal government employs 128 people full-time and operates on an annual budget of $50 million. The city government switched to a biennial budget in 2017, after an ordinance was passed by the city council in 2016. The municipal government provides emergency services, as well as water and sewage utilities, street maintenance, parks and recreation, an airport, and a cemetery. Arlington was proposed as the county seat of the secessionist Freedom County in the 1990s and 2000s, but the proposal was struck down by state courts. In response to the regional homelessness crisis, Arlington deployed embedded social workers alongside police officers to offer assistance and services, which reduced crimes and recidivism.

Culture=Arts Public art has been mandated for public construction projects in Arlington since a 2007 ordinance setting 1 percent of the budget for new artworks. The Arlington Arts Council, a volunteer organization established in 2004, has acquired 30 sculptures and murals that form the city's Sculpture Walk in downtown Arlington and along the Centennial Trail. The Arlington High School campus has a performing arts venue, the Byrnes Performing Arts Center, which opened in 2007. A fine arts and crafts festival has been held annually at Legion Park since 2008 and is organized by the Arlington Arts Council. The city is also located near the Pilchuck Glass School, a rural art school that focuses on glass art. Parks and recreation Arlington has 17 city-maintained parks with over of public open space within its city limits and urban growth boundary. Park facilities include nature preserves, neighborhood parks, sports fields, playgrounds, boat launches, and gardens. The Arlington School District also has of sports fields and playgrounds that are open to public use during non-school hours. Arlington's largest park is the County Charm Park and Conservation Area, located east of downtown Arlington along the South Fork Stillaguamish River. The park was purchased from the Graafstra family in 2010, and is planned to be developed into sports fields, hiking trails, camping areas, and a swimming beach, in addition to a riparian habitat. Across the South Fork is Twin Rivers Park, Arlington's second-largest park, a park with sports fields that is owned by Snohomish County but maintained by the city of Arlington. The city's third- largest park, Bill Quake Memorial Park, consists of soccer and baseball fields on near Arlington Municipal Airport. The county government also owns the Portage Creek Wildlife Area, a wildlife reserve located outside of city limits near downtown Arlington. The reserve was originally a dairy farm that was restored into wetland habitat in the 1990s and 2000s. Arlington is at the intersection of two major county trails used by cyclists, pedestrians, and horseback riders: the Centennial Trail, which runs from Bryant to Snohomish; and the Whitehorse Trail, which will run east from Arlington to Darrington. Both trails use right of way acquired by Snohomish County after they were abandoned by the Burlington Northern Railroad in the late 20th century. The city of Arlington also maintains a unpaved walking trail around the Arlington Municipal Airport. Festivals and events The Arlington Municipal Airport hosts the annual \\"Arlington Fly-In\\" air show during the summer, traditionally the weekend after Independence Day but later changed to August. The Fly-In has operated annually since 1969 and is the third-largest event of its kind in the United States, with over 50,000 visitors and 1,600 planes participating. The Downtown Arlington Business Association hosts several annual events in downtown Arlington, including a car show in June, a street fair on Olympic Avenue in July, and a Viking festival in October. Legion Park hosts a weekend farmers' market from June to September and is also used as a staging ground for holiday parades. The Stillaguamish Tribe hosts an annual powwow and festival of the river at River Meadows County Park on the South Fork of the Stillaguamish River in August. Media alt=A two-story building with a painted marquee and vertical sign reading \\"Olympic Theatre\\". Arlington has one weekly newspaper, The Arlington Times, which has been published in the Arlington area since 1890. It has been under common ownership with the Marysville Globe since 1964, and both were acquired by Sound Publishing in 2007. The Herald in Everett serves the entire county, including Arlington, and prints daily editions. Arlington is also part of the Seattle‚ÄìTacoma media market, and is served by Seattle-based media outlets including The Seattle Times; broadcast television stations KOMO-TV, KING-TV, KIRO-TV, and KCPQ-TV; and various radio stations. Arlington has been part of the Sno-Isle Libraries system, which operates public libraries in Island and Snohomish counties, since its inception in 1962. A library was built near downtown Arlington in 1981 and holds over 54,000 items, but has been in need of replacement or renovation since the 2000s. Sno-Isle identified the Arlington Library as a top priority for renovation and expansion in 2016, while also emphasizing the need for a new library to serve Smokey Point. A pilot library for Smokey Point opened in January 2018, using a leased retail space. Arlington had a single- screen, 381-seat movie theater, the Olympic Theatre in downtown Arlington, that operated from 1939 to 2014. Historical preservation The volunteer- operated Stillaguamish Valley Pioneer Museum, southwest of downtown Arlington, opened in 1997. The museum overlooks the Stillaguamish River and features preserved household items, logging equipment, and vehicles, historic newspapers and images from the Arlington area, and a model railroad. The Arlington area has two properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The Trafton School in Trafton was built in 1888 and re-built in 1912 after a fire. It was listed as a historic place in 2006, shortly before it was closed by the Arlington School District. The Arlington Naval Auxiliary Air Station (part of the modern-day Arlington Municipal Airport) was listed as a historic place in 1995. Notable residents Notable people from Arlington include: * Kenneth Boulton, pianist * Bob Drewel, former County Executive * Celia M. Hunter, environmentalist and conservationist * John Koster, former state legislator and County Councilmember * Rick Larsen, U.S. Congressman * Erik Norgard, American football player Education alt=A three-story tan-and-beige building on the side of a road. Public schools in Arlington are operated by the Arlington School District, which covers most of the incorporated city and also includes the outlying areas of Arlington Heights, Bryant, Getchell, and Sisco Heights. The district had an enrollment of approximately 5,528 students in 2014 and has nine total schools, including one high school, two middle schools, four elementary schools, and two alternative learning facilities. In the early 2000s, the school district opened four new schools to replace other facilities as part of a $54 million bond measure passed by Arlington voters in 2000. The Smokey Point neighborhood is served by the Lakewood School District, which is in unincorporated North Lakewood and served the area prior to its annexation by Arlington. Arlington is located approximately away from the Everett Community College, its nearest post-secondary education institution, situated in northern Everett. The college has offered basic skills and job training courses at Arlington's Weston High School since 2016, including a branch of its Advanced Manufacturing Training & Education Center. In 1966, the Smokey Point area was proposed as the location of a four-year public college, with offered by the city of Arlington to the state government. The Washington State Legislature decided to build the college instead in Olympia, becoming The Evergreen State College. The Smokey Point area was again offered by Arlington and Marysville as the site of a University of Washington branch campus in the 2000s, but the project was put on hold and later declined by the state legislature in favor of a Washington State University branch campus in Everett. Infrastructure=Transportation Arlington Municipal Airportalt=An airport with three angular runways, surrounded by hangars, warehouses, and open grass fields. Mountains and forestland can be seen in the background. Downtown Arlington is located near the junction of State Route 9 and State Route 530, which serve as the main highways to the city. From Arlington, State Route 9 travels north into Skagit County and south to Snohomish; and State Route 530 travels west to an interchange with Interstate 5, the main north‚Äìsouth highway between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, and east to Darrington. Within the city is an additional state highway, State Route 531, which connects Smokey Point, the municipal airport, and Gleneagle to Interstate 5 and State Route 9 in the southern part of the city. Other major arterial roads include Smokey Point Boulevard and 67th Avenue NE, which serve as north‚Äìsouth thoroughfares within Arlington. Public transportation in Arlington is provided by Community Transit, a public transit authority that operates in most of Snohomish County. Community Transit runs all-day local bus service on one route from Downtown Arlington to Smokey Point, as well as four other routes to Marysville, Everett, Lake Stevens, Lynnwood, and Stanwood from a transit center in Smokey Point. During peak hours, Community Transit also provides local service from Darrington, and commuter service to the Boeing Everett Factory from a park and ride in downtown Arlington. Arlington has one active railroad, a spur line from Marysville to downtown Arlington operated by BNSF Railway (the successor to Burlington Northern). As part of the development of the Arlington Airport business park, BNSF Railway will build two rail spurs leading to the airport in the near future. Arlington does not have passenger rail service, but is near Amtrak stations in Everett and Stanwood. Historically, Arlington developed along several railroads that have since been abandoned or re- purposed. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, which spurred the establishment of Arlington in the 1880s, ran north‚Äìsouth through Arlington on its main line between Snohomish and the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. In 1892, it was acquired by the Northern Pacific Railway, which was acquired by Burlington Northern in 1970. Burlington Northern abandoned the railroad in 1972, favoring a parallel route to the west through Marysville, and it was converted into the Centennial Trail in the 1990s and 2000s. A Northern Pacific branch to Darrington, following the modern-day State Route 530, was built in 1901 and abandoned in 1990; the county government plans to use the right of way for the Whitehorse Trail, a multi-purpose trail. The city of Arlington owns the Arlington Municipal Airport, located southwest of downtown Arlington. The airport is primarily used for general aviation and light business, and is home to 475 aircraft, including 10 helicopters, 20 gliders, and 23 ultra-light aircraft. Approximately 130 businesses are located on airport property, of which one-quarter are involved in aviation-related uses directly impacting the airport. In the 1990s, the airport was explored as a candidate for expansion into a regional airport to relieve Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport. The plan was ultimately abandoned by 1996, as the Puget Sound Regional Council instead chose to construct a third runway at Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport. Utilities Electric power in Arlington is provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that purchases most of its electricity from the federal Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The BPA operates the region's system of electrical transmission lines, including Path 3, a major national transmission corridor running along the eastern side of Arlington towards British Columbia. Cascade Natural Gas and Puget Sound Energy provide natural gas to Arlington residents and businesses north and south of State Route 531, respectively; two major north‚Äìsouth gas pipelines run through Arlington and are maintained by the Olympic Pipeline Company, a subsidiary of BP, and the Northwest Pipeline Company, a subsidiary of Williams Companies. Arlington is served by three telephone companies and internet service providers: Comcast (Xfinity), Frontier Communications (including Verizon FiOS), and Wave Broadband. The city of Arlington provides water and water treatment to approximately 5,548 customers within a service area within the city limits and some surrounding areas. The city's water is sourced from groundwater deposits near Haller Park on the Stillaguamish River and near Arlington Municipal Airport, as well as water purchased from the Snohomish County PUD that is sourced from Spada Lake. The Smokey Point neighborhood is served by the City of Marysville's water system. Wastewater and stormwater are collected and treated by the municipal government before being discharged into the Stillaguamish River basin. Arlington's municipal solid waste and single-stream recycling collection and disposal services are contracted by the municipal government to Waste Management; the Snohomish County government and Republic Services also operate a transfer station in Arlington. Health care Arlington is part of the Snohomish Public Hospital District No. 3, which operates the Cascade Valley Hospital, a 48-bed general hospital. The hospital was established in 1909 and was the last independent hospital in Snohomish County at the time of its acquisition in 2016. The city is also served by community clinics operated by Cascade Valley (and Skagit Regional Health) as well as The Everett Clinic and the Community Health Center of Snohomish County.

It is located in a North Cascades mountain valley formed by the Sauk and North Fork Stillaguamish rivers. Darrington is connected to nearby areas by State Route 530, which runs along the two rivers towards the city of Arlington, located to the west, and Rockport. It had a population of 1,347 at the 2010 census. Non- indigenous settlement in the area began in 1891 at the site of a Skagit campsite between the two rivers, near the traditional home of the Sauk- Suiattle tribe. Prospectors had arrived in the area during the 1880s while looking for gold and other minerals, but were quickly displaced by the logging industry that would come to dominate Darrington for much of the 20th century. The Northern Pacific Railway built a branch line to the town in 1901 and ushered in several years of growth. During the Great Depression, Darrington hosted a Civilian Conservation Corps camp that improved roads, trails, and firefighting infrastructure in the nearby Mount Baker National Forest. Several waves of Appalachian emigrants arrived in the area from North Carolina, forming a culture that is seen in the town's annual bluegrass festival and rodeo. Darrington was incorporated as a town in 1945, under a mayor‚Äìcouncil government. Its economy has transitioned away from logging and towards tourism, particularly outdoor activities such as hiking, mountain climbing, and fishing, due to its proximity to the Mount Baker‚ÄìSnoqualmie National Forest. The Darrington area is above sea level and receives significantly more precipitation and snowfall than the Puget Sound lowlands. History=Prehistory and early exploration The upper Stillaguamish and Sauk valleys on the Sauk, Suiattle, and White Chuck rivers were historically inhabited by various Native American Coast Salish groups, including the Stillaguamish, the Sauk-Suiattle, and the Upper Skagit. The Sauk-Suiattle maintained a village site and burial ground near modern-day Darrington, while the Skagits used the plain between the Stillaguamish and Sauk rivers as a portage for overland transport of canoes. The portage, named or , was also used as a transiting point for travelers from Eastern Washington on their way to and from the Puget Sound coast. The area was known as Burn or Sauk Portage to early surveyors and visitors from towns along the Puget Sound coastline. A group of railroad surveyors for the Northern Pacific Railway arrived in modern-day Darrington in 1870 while plotting the potential route for a railroad crossing the Cascades to Lake Chelan, but ultimately chose Stampede Pass to the south. The North Stillaguamish Valley was nicknamed \\"Starve Out\\" by early settlers, who arrived alone and underprepared for the area's conditions, leading to several difficult winters. Soldiers sent to the area by the valley settlers threatened to evict the Sauk-Suiattles were threatened with eviction; this did not occur as the settlers' claim that the SAuk- Suiattle had attacked them hostile people was determined to unfounded. The tribe later hired surveyors to record their claims to the eastern side of the Sauk River, lands that currently comprise their Indian reservation. The discovery of gold and other valuable minerals in the Monte Cristo area in 1889 lured prospectors into the North Cascades and stimulated the development of the surrounding valleys. A wagon road along the Sauk River connecting Monte Cristo to Sauk Prairie and the settlement of Sauk City on the Skagit River was built in 1891, later forming part of the modern Mountain Loop Highway. It was only used for three years before being replaced by the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway to the south; until that time, the Sauk Prairie at the modern site of Darrington was an overnight camping spot for prospectors. Nearby areas were explored by prospectors who made over a hundred claims to tracts of land in the highlands around the valley, including Gold Hill. Establishment and early development A group of packhorses pictured outside a general store in Darrington, 1905 The Sauk Prairie campsite evolved into a settlement that was known as \\"The Portage\\" and developed around several homesteads established between 1888 and 1891. A vote on a name was held by several pioneer residents in July 1891 in advance of the establishment of a post office. The vote was tied between two options, Portage (in some accounts, Norma) and Darrington, the maiden name of settler W. W. Cristopher's mother. According to some reports, the name was originally to be \\"Barrington\\" but was changed due to a mistake from the Postal Department or by the townspeople to resemble the word \\"dare\\". By the end of the decade, the town had gained a schoolhouse, a general store, a hotel, and a postmaster, Fred Olds, whose horse inspired the naming of Whitehorse Mountain. Darrington's residents lobbied the Seattle and International Railway for the construction of a branch line from Arlington to the town as early as 1895, offering a 15-year contract to ship 75 percent of the area's extracted ores. The railroad agreed to the offer and began construction in 1900. It later merged with the Northern Pacific Railway, outpacing Great Northern and their plans to build a railroad to their timber holdings in the Sauk River valley. Railway crews arrived in the Darrington area by the following year and the first train arrived at the town's depot in 1901. Several sawmills and other timber industries began in the years following the railroad's completion, as mining fortunes in the surrounding area dwindled. Most of the original prospectors had left the Darrington area during the Klondike gold rush of the late 1890s, while those who remained established a single smelter in the mountains. By 1906 Darrington had more than a hundred residents; a second hotel and the town's first social club had been built. A Bornite mine was developed at Long Mountain in hopes of reviving mining in the area. After its mineral deposits were found to be smaller than expected, it was abandoned. The U.S. Lumber Company, which began in 1901 as the Allen Mill, was the largest employer in Darrington during the early 1910s, producing 23,000 board feet (54.28 m) of wood per day. U.S. Lumber angered the townspeople by hiring 21 Japanese laborers at similar wages to their white counterparts. In June 1910, a mob of white men rioted and drove the Japanese out of town after little resistance, paying for their train fare to Everett after allowing them to retrieve their belongings. A report by Seattle-based vice-consul Kinjiro Hayashi was forwarded to the Japanese ambassador and state government. The company filed for an injunction after rioters had threatened to burn its Darrington mill and other properties should it attempt to return the Japanese laborers. The injunction was denied, but the townspeople relented and allowed 20 Japanese laborers to return to the mill a week later following Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu's visit to Seattle. Early 20th century The entrance to Camp Darrington, established in 1933 by the Civilian Conservation Corps Darrington's residents resisted the county government's plan to become dry, prohibiting sales of alcohol and closing the town's saloons. They circulated a petition to incorporate Darrington as a fourth-class city in order to continue alcohol sales, but the attempt at incorporation was thwarted after protests by U.S. Lumber and several civic leaders. In 1910, the town voted 46‚Äì35 in favor of remaining a \\"wet\\" settlement, but the countywide plebiscite the same day passed in favor of prohibition. The town grew substantially in the early 1920s, with new sawmills attracting more residents and businesses. The wagon road along the North Fork (now part of State Route 530) was improved. A local improvement club established a fire department, a municipal water supply, and electricity. Standard Oil built an auxiliary gas station in 1922 to serve the area, and a stagecoach service started at the same time. Darrington's first movie theater was built in 1923, a high school in 1925, along with a purpose-built jail that replaced a disused boxcar. Falling lumber prices during the Great Depression led several small sawmills in the Darrington area to suspend operations for a full year and laying off most of the town's workforce in late 1930. The town suffered outbreaks of scarlet fever and smallpox in 1931, followed by winter storms that damaged bridges and roads in the Sauk valley. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) work program established Camp Darrington on in 1933 to provide employment for up to 200 men from northern Snohomish County. The townspeople established a local cooperative association in 1935 to create jobs, including 33 at an independent sawmill, and provide services at a shared cost. Camp Darrington was primarily used to fight wildfires and develop infrastructure in the Darrington district of the Mount Baker National Forest, including roads, trails, and a series of fire lookout towers atop nearby mountains. Among its projects was the Mountain Loop Highway, which provided connections between ranger stations in Darrington and Granite Falls and also opened up the Cascades backcountry to logging and recreation. The camp employed the first wave of Appalachian emigrants from North Carolina, who would eventually form a majority of the town's population. Camp Darrington workers also assisted in the creation of two winter sports areas that were equipped with ski runs, toboggan trails, and a ski jump. The Works Progress Administration, another federal jobs program, provided funds to replace the town's overcrowded high school in 1936. Incorporation and decline of lumber Darrington reached a population of 600 residents in 1945 and was officially incorporated as a fourth-class town in 1945, following a 96‚Äì60 vote in favor . The townspeople celebrated by establishing an annual summer festival, the Timberbowl, which ran until 1967 and was initially used to raise funds for a fire engine and other equipment. A two-story town hall was built in 1947, housing the town council chambers, offices for town officials, the police department, the fire department, and a public library. In 1952 the town built a dedicated community center to serve as a venue for various social functions and a general gymnasium with seating for 1,200. A new high school and municipal airport opened in 1958 at opposite ends of the town. Railroad companies with large timber holdings in the area began to leave in the 1960s, leading to the rise of independent \\"gyppo\\" loggers who salvaged discarded timber while under contract to regional paper mills. A large open-pit mine on Miners Ridge planned by Kennecott in the late 1960s was halted after intervention from environmental activists and local politicians. Northern Pacific ended passenger rail service to the Darrington area in the 1960s, and the passenger depot was demolished in 1967. The railroad was eventually abandoned in 1990 and its right-of-way was acquired by the county for conversion into a rail trail. The gyppo operations gave way to a small local timber company, Summit Timber, which acquired the largest sawmill in Darrington, now the Hampton mill. Several smaller mills in Darrington and surrounding communities, including four for cedar shakes, closed during the 1960s, leading to further population decline. The area's timber industry was also adversely affected by tighter logging restrictions on federal lands during the 1980s and 1990s meant to protect the mountain habitats of threatened and endangered species, including the northern spotted owl. In response, Summit transitioned to processing private forests and lands managed by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, maintaining its position as the town's largest employer. The loss of timber-industry jobs led to local protests, part of the \\"timber wars\\" that erupted across logging communities in the Pacific Northwest during the 1990s. Tourism economy and modern Darrington Darrington Street in downtown Darrington The town government sought to diversify Darrington's economy and focus on tourism as an alternate industry, creating new festivals and promoting its existing bluegrass festival and rodeo. It adopted strong land use controls to preserve its rural character in the 1970s, which prevented new development until 2002. Darrington developed into a bedroom community for commuters working in Everett and Marysville. Opposition from residents forced the town government to drop plans for a 400-bed minimum-security prison work camp in 1990. The town government unsuccessfully campaigned for a NASCAR racetrack and regional swimming center in the early 2000s, aiming to become an all-year destination for the county. Several major floods in the late 1990s and early 2000s damaged properties along the rivers; in 2003 one washed out part of the Mountain Loop Highway. The highway was not restored until 2008, costing Darrington approximately $750,000 in tourist revenue and forcing several businesses to close. Darrington's main lumber mill laid off 67 workers in 2011, citing the effects of the Great Recession and declining demand. The town government, running on a small budget of $1.6 million, accepted several grants from the state to upgrade its water system and repair streets during the recession. In 2014, a major mudslide on a hillside near Oso, west of Darrington, destroyed dozens of homes and a section of Route 530, cutting off direct road access between Arlington and Darrington for two months. It killed 43, becoming the deadliest landslide in U.S. history and the deadliest natural disaster in state history since the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Darrington was one of the main staging areas for disaster response workers and supplies; the community center was used as an emergency shelter for victims and the rodeo grounds became an animal shelter and housing for workers. Route 530 was partially reopened by early June; a permanent replacement was built over the summer months and opened in September. The increased costs to local businesses resulting from the long detour via State Route 20 were mitigated with low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration and recovery funds, including $9.5 million in private donations. The tourism industry in Darrington also received a state-funded advertising campaign over the summer months, keeping revenue and visitation for local events at pre-slide levels. The state government, together with the Economic Alliance Snohomish County and Washington State University, drafted a $65 million economic recovery plan that was put into effect in 2016. Geography Whitehorse Mountain seen from Old School Park Darrington is located in the northeastern reach of Snohomish County in Western Washington, just south of the Skagit County border. It is east of Arlington, the nearest city, and northeast of Seattle. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Darrington is situated on a plain between the North Fork Stillaguamish River to the west and the Sauk River to the east. The plain is long and wide, at approximately above sea level in a valley between foothills of the Cascade Mountains, including the Whitehorse Mountain. The plain was formed by lahar deposits from several eruptions of Glacier Peak, to the southeast. The area remains in the volcano's lahar hazard zone and also lies on a fault line that last produced a major earthquake less than 500 years ago. Soil in The Darrington area is primarily composed of glacial sands and gravels that have deposits of various mineral ores, including gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, antimony, arsenic, mercury, and iron. Climate Darrington has a general climate similar to most of the Puget Sound lowlands and the Cascades foothills, with dry summers and mild, rainy winters moderated by a marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. Temperatures in Darrington typically differ by 10 ¬∞F (5 ¬∫C) from Everett and other coastal cities in the county, with colder winters and warmer summers. The majority of the region's precipitation arrives during the winter and early spring, and Darrington averages 152 days of precipitation annually that totals on average‚Äîsignificantly higher than areas in lowland Snohomish County. Darrington also receives significantly more snowfall than other cities in the county due to being in the mountains, with 10 to 15 days on average and approximately of snowfall annually since 1911.

The highest recorded temperature, , occurred in 2007, and the lowest, , in January 1950. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Darrington has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb). Economy The Hampton lumber mill, Darrington's largest employer Darrington's largest industry remains logging, centered around several small companies and the Hampton sawmill, the town's largest employer at 130 jobs. Hampton acquired the disused sawmill from Summit Timber in 2002 and reopened it the following year after $15 million in renovations. The sawmill primarily processes western hemlock and Douglas fir from nearby state and local lands. Other major industries in the town include tourism and outdoor recreation, educational services for the Darrington School District, and forestry management. The town has a grocery store, a bakery, several restaurants, a bookstore, and a microbrewery. The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe has a small casino and bingo hall that employs 50 people.

Demographics Darrington is the third-smallest incorporated place in Snohomish County, ahead of Woodway and Index, with an estimated population of 1,421 in 2019. Historically, the Darrington area's population peaked at an estimated 3,500 to 4,000 in the early 20th century during the heyday of logging in the area, which also attracted Scandinavian and Western European immigrants. The town saw an influx of Appalachian transplants from North Carolina (particularly the area around Sylva) in the 1940s and 1950s, whose families remain in the Darrington area, influencing traditions and local culture. The town's population has remained relatively stable since the 1960s, declining by 230 residents by 1990 and rebounding since then.

Government and politics Darrington's town hall, which also houses a public library operated by Sno-Isle Libraries Darrington is an incorporated town that operates under a mayor‚Äìcouncil form of government. It is one of two towns within Snohomish County, the other being Index, the only incorporated place in the county with a smaller population than Darrington. The five town council members regularly meet twice per month and are elected to four-year terms alongside the mayor. The current mayor, Dan Rankin, a sawmill owner and former councilmember, was elected in 2011; he has twice been re-elected. The town government handles and manages public safety, public works, administration, and parks and recreation. It also operates a public cemetery, the municipal airport, and contracts for utility services. The mayor and town council appoint a clerk treasurer and the heads of various government departments. , the town government employs seven people and has an annual budget of $3 million. The town has an independent fire department with two stations, but contracts with the Snohomish County Sheriff for policing and emergency services. The town also has a public library branch operated by the Sno-Isle Libraries system and located in the town hall complex, which was built in 1990 and expanded in 2008. While Snohomish County as a whole favors the Democratic Party in elections, Darrington has generally supported Republican candidates. It is represented at the county and state levels by officials from that party. Nate Nehring is county councilman for the 1st district, which includes Darrington, since his appointment in 2017. The town is within the state's 39th legislative district, currently represented by senator Keith Wagoner, and representatives Robert J. Sutherland and Carolyn Eslick, all Republicans. At the federal level, Darrington is represented by Democrats. It is part of Washington's 1st congressional district, which has been represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Democrat Suzan DelBene since 2012. Two other Democrats, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, represent all of Washington in the United States Senate. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Darrington had the highest percentage of votes in Snohomish County for Republican Donald Trump, at 61 percent compared to 33 percent for Democrat Hillary Clinton, who carried the county. Similarly, in the same year's gubernatorial election, 59 percent of Darrington voters preferred Republican Bill Bryant over incumbent Democrat Jay Inslee, who was re-elected. Some Democrats have succeeded in Darrington, however. In the 2012 presidential election, Barack Obama won the town with 52 percent of the vote. Culture Darrington describes itself as a self-sufficient and tight-knit community, owing to its isolation and small population. Descendants of emigrants from North Carolina, particularly the Sylva area, after World War II, shaped many of the traditions and customs in the Darrington area. The term \\"going down below\\" is sometimes used among Darrington residents to refer to trips outside of the town. Memorial dinners and fundraisers during funerals are hosted by its residents, typically attended by up to a fourth of the town's population. Darrington also has a strong tradition of volunteerism, which it sometimes relies on in lieu of municipal services. Events and festivals The host grounds of the Darrington rodeo Darrington has a community events complex and park located west of the town, which is home to several annual events, including a rodeo and a Bluegrass festival. The Darrington Timberbowl Rodeo began in 1964 and typically draws over a thousand spectators during its two-day run in late June. The rodeo was cancelled in 2013 after an inspection found the venue's bleachers to be unsafe, but $25,000 in repairs funded by state grants allowed it to resume the following year. The Timberbowl Rodeo is named for a former festival that was held annually in late June from 1946 to 1967, and featured various logging events and competitions in addition to a town parade. The Darrington Bluegrass Festival is held for three days every July and was started in 1977 by descendants of Appalachian transplants to the area. The festival draws around 10,000 people, including visitors who use an adjacent campground and participate in communal jam sessions. Prominent Bluegrass groups, including Bill Monroe, the Gibson Brothers, and Rural Delivery, have performed at Darrington's Whitehorse Mountain Amphitheater. Since 2006, the amphitheater has also been used to host the Summer Meltdown jam festival in early August, which attracts a wide variety of musical acts. The four-day event typically draws 4,000 visitors and 40 acts, as well as art pieces that are installed around the campgrounds. Both festivals were cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The town also has several other annual events, including Darrington Day in late May, a Fourth of July parade, and a street fair in July. Darrington formerly hosted an annual wildflower festival and an annual Christian music festival in the 1990s during the transition to a tourism-based economy. Media With no local newspaper, events in Darrington are covered by Everett's daily newspaper, the Herald, a daily publication from Everett, and the weekly Arlington Times. The town's first newspaper, named The Wrangler, was published from 1907 to 1915 by the Darrington Literary Society. A second newspaper, The Darrington News, was published for two years from 1947 to 1949 and was followed by the Timber Bowl Tribune, which was printed in Darrington and Concrete using a plant owned by The Concrete Herald. The Tribune was active from 1955 to 1958, when it was folded into the Arlington Times. Parks and recreation The headquarters of the Darrington Ranger District, a unit of the Mount Baker‚ÄìSnoqualmie National Forest Darrington is surrounded by the Mount Baker‚ÄìSnoqualmie National Forest and serves as the headquarters of the Darrington Ranger District, a unit of the U.S. Forest Service. The area includes three designated wilderness areas, Glacier Peak, Henry M. Jackson, and Boulder River, and over of hiking and backcountry trails that are also open to mountain biking and horseback riding. Darrington has several campgrounds, roadside recreational areas, fishing areas, and whitewater rafting courses along the Sauk and Suiattle rivers. The Mountain Loop Highway connects Darrington to various scenic areas, including birdwatching hotspots and the Pacific Crest Trail system. The town government also maintains several small parks in Darrington, totaling of open space. Old School Park sits within view of Whitehorse Mountain and has a gazebo, a playground, a skate park, and a pump track for bicycles. Harold Engles Park has a disc golf course and a lawn, and Nels Bruseth Memorial Garden has historic exhibits and a rhododendron garden. The Snohomish County government owns and operates Whitehorse Community Park, which includes several baseball and softball fields on north of the town that opened in 2007. Darrington is the only town in the state to have a permanent archery range, which is one of three that regularly hosts events organized by the National Field Archery Association. The archery complex includes six full ranges, trails, concession stands, and of reserved space. The town also has a community center that was built in 1954 and typically functions as a gymnasium and gathering space. Historic preservation The town has a small historical society that preserves photographs and other documents for research. The Darrington Ranger District has four structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The ranger station in Darrington was listed in 1991, while the fire lookouts on Three Fingers, Miners Ridge, and Green Mountain were listed in 1987 and 1988. The Green Mountain lookout was to be removed since its maintenance requires helicopters and other machinery, until passage of the Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act by the U.S. Congress in 2014 provided funds for a restoration project. Notable people *Bob Barker, former game show host of The Price Is Right; born in Darrington *Nels Bruseth, forest ranger, artist, and naturalist Education The Darrington School District operates two public schools in the town that enroll 414 students during the 2016‚Äì17 school year. It employs 31 teachers and administrations, and 50 other staff members. The district primarily serves Darrington and areas east of Oso, as well as areas in Skagit County that are near the Sauk-Suiattle Reservation. The town's elementary school, serving kindergarten through eight grade, was opened in 1990 and shares its campus with the high school. The mascot for the school is the Darrington Loggers, named after the town's historic principal industry. Loggers teams have won state championships in various sports during the 1950s, 1980s, and 1990s. Infrastructure=Transportation Looking westbound on State Route 530 as it leaves Darrington Darrington is located along State Route 530, which travels west towards Arlington and north to State Route 20 at Rockport. The highway carries a daily average of approximately 3,300 vehicles west of the town and 2,300 vehicles north of the town towards the Sauk-Suiattle Reservation. Darrington has a third highway connection through the Mountain Loop Highway, a backcountry scenic byway that runs south through the Cascades and west to Granite Falls. It is closed in the winter and is considered unsuitable for commercial traffic, in part due to a dirt and gravel section. The area is also served by Community Transit, the main public transportation agency for most of Snohomish County. Route 230 connects Darrington to Oso, Arlington, and a transit center in Smokey Point twice a day during rush hour. The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe operates a bus route serving Darrington, its reservation, and Concrete. It has six daily round trips and launched in 2016 with grants from the state and federal governments. The Whitehorse Trail, a recreational trail for hikers, cyclists, and horseback riders, is being developed by the county government to connect Darrington with Arlington. It follows the Northern Pacific's 1901 route, sold to the county in 1993. The town government operates a small airport, Darrington Municipal Airport, which has a single paved runway suitable for general aviation and other activities. Utilities Electric power for Darrington residents and businesses is provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County. The PUD operates a small biomass cogeneration plant in Darrington that produces electricity from steam power by burning wood from the Hampton Lumber sawmill. The 7 MW plant was installed in 2006 after an earlier proposal by the National Energy Systems Company (NESCO) for a similar plant that would have generated up to 20 MW was rejected. The NESCO proposal was withdrawn in 2004 over local concerns about air pollution and environmental degradation to the nearby National Forest lands. The town lacks natural gas service and relies on wood- burning stoves for building heat, some of which have been replaced by the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency due to their impact on air quality. Frontier Communications is the only land-based provider of Internet and telephone service to Darrington, using a fiber-optic cable laid along State Route 530. The town government provides water from a pair of wells, and water treatment, to 534 structures. Darrington is one of several small communities in Snohomish County without a municipal sewer system, instead relying on septic tanks. The town government has considered installing a sewage system several times in the 1990s and 2000s, but those plans have stalled due to the $6.5 million cost (as estimated in 2000) and the land needed for a treatment plant. Solid waste and recycling collection is contracted out by the town government to Waste Management. Health care Darrington's nearest general hospital is the Cascade Valley Hospital in Arlington. The town also has a medical clinic operated by Skagit Regional Health and staffed by a single doctor. The clinic was established in 1958 and operated by Cascade Valley Hospital until it was absorbed into the Skagit system. The town has periodically gone for years without a doctor, notably substituting a registered nurse to provide the majority of medical care in the early 1970s.

It is located in the southwest corner of the county, facing Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains to the west. The city is part of the Seattle metropolitan area and is located north of Seattle and southwest of Everett. With a population of 39,709 residents in the 2010 U.S. census, Edmonds is the third most populous city in the county. The estimated population in 2019 was 42,605. Edmonds was established in 1876 by logger George Brackett, who bought the land claim of an earlier settler. It was incorporated as a city in 1890, shortly before the arrival of the Great Northern Railway. Early residents of the city were employed by the shingle mills and logging companies that operated in the area until the 1950s. The hills surrounding Edmonds were developed into suburban bedroom communities in the mid-to-late 20th century and subsequently annexed into the city. Edmonds is a regional hub for the arts, with museums, specialized facilities, and major annual festivals within the city's downtown area. The city is connected to nearby areas by two state highways and the state ferry system, which operates a ferry route to Kingston on the Kitsap Peninsula. Public transit service in Edmonds is centered around the downtown train station, served by Amtrak and Sounder commuter trains, and includes several Community Transit bus routes that travel through outlying neighborhoods. History=19th and early 20th centuries Main Street in downtown Edmonds Prior to the 19th century, the Edmonds area was inhabited by the Suquamish tribe, who foraged and fished near the flat beach forming modern-day downtown. No archaeological evidence of a permanent settlement in Edmonds has been found, despite claims that a fishing village had existed near the modern-day downtown. An exploratory expedition of Puget Sound led by Charles Wilkes charted the Edmonds area in 1841, naming \\"Point Edmund\\" (now Point Edwards) to the southwest of the modern-day downtown. A land claim for the area was filed by Pleasant Ewell in 1866 and was sold to various landowners before being eventually purchased by Canadian-born logger George Brackett in 1872 for $650. Brackett had allegedly found the future site of Edmonds in 1870 while searching for potential logging areas on his canoe, which was blown ashore during a storm. Brackett and his family moved from Ballard to Point Edmund in 1876, intent on creating a town. He drained a marshland near the waterfront and began logging the area, then known as \\"Brackett's Landing\\". Additional settlers arrived over the next few years, necessitating the construction of a wharf and general store by 1881. In 1884, the settlement was platted and gained its first post office, christened with the name \\"Edmonds\\", either a misspelling of Point Edmund or the name of George Franklin Edmunds, a U.S. Senator from Vermont who Brackett admired. By the end of the decade, Edmonds had gained its first schoolhouse, sawmill, hotel, and drug store. The Town of Edmonds was formally incorporated as a fourth-class village of on August 14, 1890, following an election by residents on August 7. To meet the minimum population of 300 residents required for incorporation, a popular legend states that Brackett added the names of his two oxen to the census conducted prior to the election. Edmonds is the oldest incorporated city in Snohomish County. Brackett was elected as the town's mayor for several months and the new town council passed ordinances to regulate or ban saloons, gambling establishments, and boarding houses. The same year, Edmonds was selected as a stop on the Seattle and Montana Railroad (later absorbed into the Great Northern Railway), sparking interest from real estate investors. The Minneapolis Realty and Investment Company bought of the townsite from Brackett for $36,000 and built a new hotel and wharf. The railway arrived in 1891, but failed to spark a land rush and the investment plan fell apart during the Panic of 1893, leaving Brackett to foreclose on the land. shingle mill on Lake Ballinger, pictured in 1907 Edmonds was supported by four shingle mills that prospered in the 1890s, along with an iron foundry that manufactured steel plates for shingles. By 1908, the town had gained its own water system, electricity, paved streets, and telephone service. In September 1908, Edmonds voted to become a third-class city, with a reported population of 1,546 residents. The city unsuccessfully lobbied for a branch of the interurban line from Everett to Seattle, which would have supplemented passenger steamships on the Mosquito fleet and passenger trains operated by Great Northern. A major fire on July 8, 1909, destroyed one block of buildings on Main Street and caused $20,000 in damage. After the fire, the destroyed buildings were bought by a city councilman and was replaced by a two-story concrete building. The first automobile owned by an Edmonds resident arrived in 1911 and was followed by the completion of the North Trunk Road through modern-day Lynnwood. A branch road to Edmonds was completed in 1915 and stagecoach lines were extended to the city. Automobile ferry service began in 1923, with the inauguration of the Kingston ferry, which would be acquired by the Puget Sound Navigation Company and continue to serve the city after the decline of the Mosquito fleet. During the 1920s, Edmonds expanded its wharf and ferry dock, while a site on the south end of the waterfront was acquired by the Union Oil Company (later Unocal) for the construction of an oil terminal in 1922. A second major fire struck downtown Edmonds on April 11, 1928, damaging several buildings on the same block of Main Street as the 1909 fire. Despite the increasing scarcity of local timber, the sawmills on the Edmonds waterfront remained the city's main industry in the 1920s. During the Great Depression, all but two mills continued to operate and were supplemented by local improvement projects organized by the federal Works Progress Administration, including regraded streets, new parks, and the addition of an auditorium and sportsfields to the high school. Late 20th and early 21st centuries The popularity of new materials for roof shingles and scarcity of available timber in the state forced most of Edmonds' mills to close by 1951. New companies were established in place of the mills, including an aluminum fabricator and an asphalt refinery at the Unocal terminal. The now vacated waterfront was redeveloped under the direction of the Port of Edmonds, established in 1948 by a public referendum. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Port constructed a breakwater, marina, public beach, and a new ferry terminal for the Washington State Ferries system. The hills surrounding downtown Edmonds to the north and east were developed into suburban subdivisions, centered around small commercial centers, and were annexed by the city. Edmonds reached its present eastern boundary along State Route 99 in May 1959, a few weeks after the incorporation of Lynnwood as a city. By 1963, the city had completed its largest annexations and petitioned to become a first-class city, with a population of 19,000 that placed it second among cities in Snohomish County. Despite the population growth, Edmonds restricted the construction of multi- family dwellings in an effort to keep the downtown area and older neighborhoods \\"rural-like\\" and low density. By the end of the 1960s, Edmonds had also gained a new hospital, a community college, and civic center campus. Brackett's Landing Park, a public beach developed in the 1970s In the 1970s, the number of businesses in downtown Edmonds declined as suburban shopping centers lured away customers. After a number of buildings in the downtown area were demolished and replaced with condominiums and office buildings, a movement to preserve and restore historic buildings emerged with the support of the city government. The \\"Main Street Project\\", funded by local businesses, restored empty storefronts and attracted restaurants to the city in the late 1980s, fueling a downtown revival. Portions of the waterfront were acquired by the city and redeveloped into a public beach, named Brackett's Landing Park, and a public fishing pier was opened in 1979 as the first saltwater fishing pier in the state. Edmonds celebrated its centennial in 1990 with a series of events and the dedication of the Centennial Plaza. Several neighborhoods in southern Edmonds were annexed between 1995 and 1997, forming the city's southern boundary at the King County line. The Point Edwards oil terminal on the city's waterfront was closed by Unocal in 1991 and the site was sought by Edmonds and Snohomish County for redevelopment. The city favored the construction of a new multimodal transportation hub at the site, including a ferry terminal and commuter rail station, while the county proposed the construction of a sewage treatment plant to be used by King and Snohomish counties. The sewage treatment plant was opposed by the city government and citizen groups, and was ultimately moved to an alternative site near Woodinville in 2003. The transportation plan was put on hold after costs increased and the state ferry system diverted funding to other projects. The hilltop portion of the site was cleaned up in the 2000s and redeveloped into condominiums that opened between 2007 and 2008.

History=Annexation Five times in the last 50 years, the City of Edmonds has looked at annexing Esperance into the city. In each case, voters in the enclave have rejected the annexation. Issues for annexation include a desire for a contiguous City of Edmonds, continuity of services and a belief that services will be easier to provide. Arguments against annexation include desire to remain part of unincorporated area of Snohomish county, an expectation that taxes may rise with annexation, and the desire to take part in activities that are possible in the county that would not be permitted under city regulations. The latter includes less regulation for building certain structures and the ability to keep animals.

It is located between the Pilchuck and Stillaguamish rivers in the western foothills of the Cascade Range, northeast of Lake Stevens and Marysville. The city is named for a waterfall north of downtown on the Stillagumish River, also accessible via the Mountain Loop Highway. It had a population of 3,364 at the 2010 census. The site of Granite Falls was originally a portage for local Coast Salish tribes prior to the arrival of American settlers. The settlement was founded in 1884 and prospered after the discovery of gold and silver in the Monte Cristo mines located east of Granite Falls on the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway. Granite Falls was platted in 1891 and incorporated as a fourth-class town on November 8, 1903. History The Pilchuck River and Upper Stillaguamish basin was historically inhabited by the Skykomish people, who used the modern-day site of Granite Falls as a portage along with other Coast Salish tribes. Several Skykomish archaeological sites were discovered in the 1970s between modern-day Granite Falls and Lochsloy, with over 700 artifacts recovered from later excavation. The first permanent European settler was Joseph Sous Enas, who staked a homestead claim in 1884 on land south of the present city. The townsite was platted in 1891, following the construction of a post office and general store. The Everett and Monte Cristo Railway reached Granite Falls on October 16, 1892, building a station for the town on the route between the mining area of Monte Cristo (now a ghost town) and the county seat of Everett. The city was officially incorporated on December 21, 1903. He was quickly followed by other homesteaders, benefiting from \\"the Big Burn\\", a forest fire that cleared the heavily forested land and made it easier for settlers to stake claims. By 1896, there were enough residents to petition the state of a school district (Granite Falls District #1)School District Boundary Record, Record of Eighth Grade Graduation 1898-1903, and Snohomish County Register of Teachers (p. 83), Educational Service District (ESD) 189, Snohomish County Public Schools, Multiple Series Box 1, Washington State Archives, Northwest Regional Branch; David Cameron, email to Janet Oakley, March 3, 2008, in possession of Janet Oakley; The discovery of gold and other minerals in 1889 in the Cascade Mountains East of Granite Falls was a boon to Granite Falls. Mines needed a railroad and the settlers of Granite Falls stepped up to provide railroad ties cut from the nearby forests, supplies for fortune seeking miners, a doctor, and other necessities. In 1890, a post office was opened and the first commercial establishments opened on what is now South Granite Ave and Pioneer. The Everett and Monte Cristo Railway came to town in 1892 from its start in Hartford, Washington (near today's Lake Stevens) and through to its terminus at Monte Cristo. Partially funded by John D. Rockefeller and others, the train carried supplies, passengers, and ore up and down the Stilly Valley.The Everett & Monte Cristo Railway; Philip R. Woodhouse, Daryl Jacobson, and Bill Petersen; Oso Publishing, September 2000. The Granite Falls townsite was platted in 1891 from portions of the Wright and Anderson homesteads and on November 8, 1903, Granite Falls was incorporated as a fourth-class city. Electricity, sewers, sidewalks, telephones, cars, and all the amenities of modern life soon followed. By World War I, the once bustling mining towns of Monte Cristo and Silverton were no longer shipping out ore. The railroad, now owned by Northern Pacific, stopped running and the tracks were torn out in the early 1930s to make way for the Mountain Loop Highway. Granite Falls between the world wars was a lumber town; logging companies felled trees, sawmills created lumber and shingle mills created shingles. The Great Depression, however, took its toll. By 1935, the population of Granite Falls was half what it was in 1925. Mills closed and people left to find work elsewhere. On April 26, 1933, a fire destroyed the Cascade Hotel in downtown Granite Falls and threatened other buildings. The historic hotel was rebuilt at the same site. At the end of World War II, things looked bleak. The opening of Miller Shingle in 1946 (now the country's largest specialty lumber mill) meant jobs both in the woods and at the mill. Construction booms through Snohomish and King counties also meant jobs at the gravel pits dotted around Granite Falls. The city later became a bedroom community for commuters working in Everett and Lake Stevens for large companies. Hard times would come again. In 1986, the United States Forest Service severely limited logging in old-growth forests under its protection in an effort to save the Northern Spotted Owl from extinction.U.S. Forest Service protects the northern spotted owl by limiting timber sales on August 7, 1986. HistoryLink.org Essay 5319; accessed Nov. 11, 2010 at http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=5319 In June, 1990, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department declared the spotted owl an endangered species, and in 1991, a federal court judge ruled the Forest Service's logging plan to save the owl was inadequate. Over one-fourth of old- growth forest on both public and private land were put off-limits to logging.\\"The Northern Spotted Owl\\", Forest History Society Website (www.lib.duke.edu/ forest/usfscoll/policy /northern_spotted_owl /index.html). In the 21st century, Granite Falls has focused on attracting visitors to the natural environment and recreational opportunities along the Mt. Loop Highway. Expanded housing development has brought an increased population of families who commute to Everett, Seattle, and the Eastside to work. In 2001, the Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America was given a 17-acre (7 ha) plot of land next to Kannagara Jinja (built by the Reverend of the shrine) in Granite Falls, which was built upon, combining the two places.Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America website (http://www.tsubakishrine.com/history/index.html). A truck bypass around the north side of downtown Granite Falls opened in 2010 to serve several quarries to the northeast. A new high school campus was built near the bypass, along with a housing development with 327 homes in the late 2010s. A downtown revitalization project began in the 2000s with renovations to buildings and a small city park. A new civic center is planned along South Granite Avenue, including a city hall that opened in 2019, a public plaza, a community center, and a gymnasium for the Boys & Girls Club that will also serve as an emergency shelter. The city government has also proposed promoting Granite Falls as a location for outdoor recreation retailers and businesses.

The Skykomish had a village along the north bank of the river named , located at the present site of Index. Logging and lumber booms in the latter half of the 19th century led to the growth of minor settlements in the eastern part of what became Snohomish County in 1861. A gold strike in 1889 at nearby Monte Cristo fueled another influx of prospectors and settlers.http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=7877 Index was founded in 1889 on the homestead of Amos Gunn in 1889, whose home was also a hotel for prospectors and surveyors. The town was named for nearby Mount Index (later renamed Baring Mountain), itself named for its resemblance to an index finger. The settlement gained a post office in 1891 and saw major growth after the arrival of the Great Northern Railway. Gunn filed his town plat for Index on April 25, 1893, three months before a major fire on July 22 destroyed most of its buildings. Index was officially incorporated on October 11, 1907. Its population peaked during the decade at 1,000 and has since declined to 200. The Index area had few jobs and services, with only a single restaurant and general store by the 1980s to serve a population of around 150. The Snohomish County Public Utility District had planned to build a hydroelectric power plant at Sunset Falls near Index in the early 2010s, but abandoned the project after it was opposed by environmentalists and local residents. Geography Index is located in the western foothills of the Cascade Mountains; the summit of Mount Index is located south of the town. The Index Town Walls, granite cliffs up to high, are located on the northern edge of the town. These walls are popularly used for rock climbing, offering a variety of high-quality cracks for this purpose.

It is located east of Everett and borders the cities of Marysville to the northwest and Snohomish to the south. The city's population was 28,069 at the 2010 census, but has since grown to an estimated 33,911. The lake was named in 1859 for territorial governor Isaac Stevens and was originally home to the Skykomish in the Pilchuck River basin. The first modern settlement on Lake Stevens was founded at the northeastern corner of the lake in 1889. It was later sold to the Rucker Brothers, who opened a sawmill in 1907 that spurred early growth in the area, but closed in 1925 after the second of two major fires. The Lake Stevens area then became a resort community before developing into a commuter town in the 1960s and 1970s. Lake Stevens was incorporated as a city in 1960, following an exodus of businesses from the downtown area to a new shopping center. The city has since grown through annexations to encompass most of the lake, including the original shopping center, and quadrupled in population from 2000 to 2010. A revitalized downtown area is planned alongside new civic buildings in the 2020s. History Lake Stevens was named in 1859 for territorial governor Isaac Stevens and was originally listed as \\"Stevens Lake\\" on early maps. The area around the lake was used for berry gathering by the indigenous Skykomish, who also used most of the Pilchuck River basin for hunting. The first homesteads around the lake were established by emigrants in the 1880s, beginning with Joseph William Davison's claim along the east shore filed in 1886. A two-block townsite at the northeast end of the lake named \\"Outing\\" was claimed on October 8, 1889, by Charles A. Missimer and platted the following year. The construction of the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway along the eastern side of the Pilchuck River Valley in 1889 spurred the creation of more settlements in the area. Among them were Machias in 1890, which was followed by Hartford (originally named \\"Ferry\\"), later a major junction for the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway completed in 1892. North Cove Park, near the former site of the Rucker Brothers sawmill Outing was later vacated and sold between various investors before the townsite was acquired in 1905 by the Rucker Brothers, who planned to build a sawmill after a previous venture by Jacob Falconer had failed. The Rucker Brothers constructed a railroad spur from Hartford and redirected the flow of Cassidy Creek, the main outlet of the lake, to prepare land for their shingle mill, which opened in 1907. A plat for the town of Lake Stevens was filed by the Rucker Brothers on February 8, 1908, including a business district and residences to accommodate the mill's 250 workers. The sawmill, one of the largest in the United States, was partially destroyed in a 1919 fire and later rebuilt. It was permanently closed after a second fire in 1925 and dismantled, causing many residents to leave the area. One of the remnants from the old mill was a locomotive that sunk in the early 1910s and was rediscovered in 1995 by a U.S. Navy training team, following a request from the local historical society. By the mid-1920s, the entire shoreline of Lake Stevens had been divided into small lots and tracts for summer homes and resorts. Following the demise of the Rucker mill, Lake Stevens was primarily a resort community that drew 3,000 visitors on busy days to fish, swim, and water-ski on the lake. While the major lakeside resorts were successful, the Lake Stevens area saw little residential and commercial development for several decades as the downtown area stagnated. The first Hewitt Avenue Trestle was completed in 1939, providing an elevated highway over the Snohomish River floodplain between Everett and Cavalero Hill, with onward connections to areas around Lake Stevens. Suburban development around Lake Stevens began in the 1950s, shortly after plans were announced to build a large shopping center named Frontier Village at the intersection of two state highways west of the lake (later State Route 9 and State Route 204). Business owners in downtown Lake Stevens proposed incorporation in 1958 to prevent retailers from relocating to the new shopping center, offering local control of policing and street maintenance with no increase in taxes. On November 19, 1960, Lake Stevens voted 299‚Äì40 in favor of incorporating as a city, which was certified by the state government on November 29. The town boundaries were set around downtown and included an estimated 900 residents. The city government purchased a former post office building for use as a city hall, which included a jail that was never used due to a change in state laws. The development of resorts around Lake Stevens also caused water quality to deteriorate, necessitating the creation of a voluntary drainage district in 1932 to manage runoff and pollution. It was replaced in 1963 by an independent sewer district, which mandated vegetation buffers for homes and later installed a large aeration system to slow the growth of algae in the lake. Frontier Village opened in 1960 and later expanded as State Route 9 and State Route 204 were improved through the area. A new highway bypassing downtown, State Route 92, opened at the end of the decade. The area around Frontier Village was developed into a suburban commuter town in the 1970s and 1980s with the construction of several residential subdivisions. Hewlett-Packard won approval from the county government to build a manufacturing plant northwest of Lake Stevens in 1983, despite opposition from local residents looking to preserve the area's rural character. By the late 1990s, the city had over 5,700 residents and was among the fastest-growing cities in the state. The unincorporated areas to the west of the lake also grew to over 20,000 people, adding multi-family housing to its existing inventory of single-family neighborhoods, and rejected an attempt to build a second shopping center and commercial complex on Cavalero Hill. Lake Stevens unsuccessfully attempted to annex the western neighborhoods in 1993, but adopted plans to create \\"one community around the lake\\" and revitalize its downtown. The first major annexations were completed in 2006, adding around Frontier Village and the north end of the lake. From 2000 to 2010, the city quadrupled in population to nearly 30,000 people and added . The largest annexation, consisting of in the southwest corner of the Lake Stevens urban growth area, was completed in December 2009 and added more than 10,000 residents. Further annexations of areas to the southeast of the lake are planned to complete the full encirclement of Lake Stevens. The city government adopted plans in 2018 to redevelop downtown Lake Stevens with denser housing and commercial use, including mixed-use buildings and walkable streets. The former city hall in downtown was demolished in 2017 as part of an expansion for North Cove Park, with city services temporarily relocated at an adjacent building until a permanent replacement is built. The police station was relocated to an abandoned fire station and will open a new headquarters building on Chapel Hill in the 2020s. An earlier plan to combine city services, the police station, and a new library at a civic campus on Chapel Hill fell through after the failure of a library bond measure. Geography Lake Stevens is located northeast of Seattle and northeast of Everett, between the cities of Marysville and Snohomish. The city's boundaries are generally defined to the north by State Route 92, to the east by the Centennial Trail, to the south by 28th Street Southeast, and to the west by State Route 204. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The unincorporated urban growth area covers several neighborhoods on the southeast side of the lake, which has been sought for annexations. The city lies on a plateau between the Snohomish River delta, which separates it from Everett and Ebey Island to the west, and the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. It surrounds the north and east sides of Lake Stevens, the largest and deepest lake in Snohomish County, with an area of and an average depth of . The lake has of shoreline and is fed by Lundeen Creek, Mitchell (Kokanee) Creek, and Stitch Creek. It drains into Catherine Creek, which then flows to the Pilchuck River. The lake's relatively small watershed, at , minimizes the effect of upstream pollution but reduces flow to remove pollutants. Lake Stevens installed aeration system in the 1990s to control the release of phosphorus from lake sediments, which caused unwanted algae growth. Most of the shoreline is heavily developed, with little remaining native vegetation, and Lake Stevens is used for recreational fishing, swimming, boating, and skiing. Lake Stevens has two major commercial centers: downtown and Frontier Village. Downtown Lake Stevens is located on the northeastern arm of the lake and has been undergoing redevelopment since the 1990s. Frontier Village is located west of the lake at the intersection of State Route 9 and State Route 204 and is a traditional suburban shopping center with strip malls and big box stores. The city government also has several designated neighborhoods and planning areas: Cavalero Hill, Frontier Village, the Hartford Industrial Area, and Machias. Economy , Lake Stevens has an estimated workforce population of 23,393 people, of which 15,084 are employed. The largest sectors of employment are manufacturing (18%), followed by educational and health services (17%), retail (13%), and professional services (11%). The majority of workers in the city commute to other areas for employment, including 20 percent to Everett, 13 percent to Seattle, and 4 percent to Bellevue. Approximately 6.3 percent of Lake Stevens residents work within the city limits. Over 81 percent of workers commute in single-occupant vehicles, while 2 percent take public transportation and less than 10 percent use carpools. The city had 1,553 registered businesses with 4,202 total jobs, according to 2012 estimates by the U.S. Census and Puget Sound Regional Council. The largest provider of jobs in Lake Stevens came from businesses in the services sector, at 1,595, followed by education (991) and retail (696). The city's largest employer is the Lake Stevens School District, followed by aerospace manufacturer Cobalt Enterprises, which is headquartered in the Hartford industrial area and expanded its facilities in 2016. Over 20 percent of people with jobs based in Lake Stevens live within city limits, while the rest commute from nearby cities in northern Snohomish County. Hewlett-Packard opened a large manufacturing facility on Soper Hill northwest of Lake Stevens in 1985 for its test and measurement division, following a planning dispute with the county government. The test and measurement division was later spun off into Agilent and shared its Lake Stevens facility with Solectron. The plant had 1,000 employees at its peak, but was closed in 2002 after several rounds of layoffs. The site was later redeveloped into a suburban housing complex in the mid-2000s. Lake Stevens is home to a large retail district centered around Frontier Village, located at the intersection of State Route 9 and State Route 204. It was developed beginning in the 1960s and now encompasses more than of retail space, spread across several strip malls. A Costco store is planned to be constructed at the intersection of State Route 9 and 20th Street Southeast with a building, a gas station with 30 pumps, and 800 parking stalls. A development agreement was approved by the city government in December 2019 after several public meetings that drew dozens of residents. Demographics Lake Stevens is the fifth-largest city in Snohomish County, with an estimated population of 33,378 in 2018. The city is the fastest growing in Snohomish County since 2000, increasing by 18 percent from 2010 to 2018 through new residential development in the southwest and annexation of other areas.

Government and politics Lake Stevens is a non-charter code city with a mayor‚Äìcouncil system of government. The city council serves as the legislative body of the city government and has seven members who are elected at-large to four-year terms in staggered elections. The council holds regular meetings twice a month at the Lake Stevens School District administrative headquarters and a work session during other weeks as needed. The mayor is a part-time position that is also elected by Lake Stevens residents and serves as the executive of the city government during a four-year term. Former city councilmember Brett Gailey, who was also employed by the Everett Police Department, was elected as mayor in 2019. The city government has budgeted expenditures of $50.4 million and revenues of $43.4 million in 2020, largely funded by sales, property, and utility taxes. It has 85 employees organized into departments of economic development, finance, human resources, parks and recreation, planning, policing, and public works. Lake Stevens has several non-elected executive positions, including the city administrator, city clerk, police chief, planning director, public works director, and community programs planner. Several regional agencies provide other services, such as fire protection, library access, and water management. In addition to elected and executive positions, Lake Stevens has seven boards and commissions that advise the city council on a variety of specific issues. They are composed of volunteer citizens who are appointed to set terms by the mayor with the approval of the city council. The boards and commissions are tasked with managing arts, civil service and police, the public library, parks and recreation, planning, city salaries, and veterans' rights. At the federal level, Lake Stevens is part of the 1st congressional district, which includes the northeastern areas of the Puget Sound region and is represented by Democrat Suzan DelBene. The city was part of the 2nd congressional district until a redistricting in 2012 that split most of Northwestern Washington. At the state level, Lake Stevens shares the 44th legislative district with Snohomish and Mill Creek. The city lies in the Snohomish County Council's 5th district, which also includes Maltby and the Skykomish Valley. Culture The city's annual summer festival, Aquafest, is held at North Cove Park in downtown Lake Stevens over a three-day weekend in late July. It was founded in 1960 and includes a boat parade, carnival rides, a car show, and a circus. The 2018 festival was attended by 30,000 people. An annual Ironman 70.3 triathlon was added to Aquafest in the 2000s and features a course with swimming, cycling, and running segments. The triathlon also serves as a qualifier for the Ironman World Championship. Parks and recreation Cascade Mountains seen from Wyatt Park Lake Stevens has of parks and open space managed by the city government, Snohomish County, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. The city government owns and has nine parks that are categorized as community parks, neighborhood parks, mini-parks, and other facilities. In addition to public facilities, the Lake Stevens area has of private parks and open spaces that are owned by homeowner associations and other entities. The largest city-owned park is Eagle Ridge Community Park, located on near the northwest shore of the lake, but largely undeveloped. The county government owns three community parks in the Lake Stevens area. Cavalero Community Park opened in 2009 and consists of two fenced dog parks, an open field, and a planned skate park on . Lake Stevens Community Park is located east of downtown and includes several soccer and baseball fields on of former timber land. Wyatt Park lies at the foot of Chapel Hill on the western lakeshore and includes a beach, boat launch, and a boathouse for rowing teams. Several city parks are located along the shore of Lake Stevens, providing beaches with swimming areas and fishing docks. Lundeen Park is the largest of the city's beaches and was developed out of a former resort that opened in 1908. It also offers paddleboard and kayak rentals, a visitors center, and a concession stand. At the northeast end of the lake is North Cove Park, a downtown park that is planned to be developed into an urban gathering space. A disc golf course was opened in 2000 at Catherine Creek Park, a small park with hiking trails and natural areas. The county government also owns Centennial Trail, an inter-city hiking, bicycling, and equestrian rail trail. It travels between Arlington and Snohomish, passing through the east side of Lake Stevens. The city has several short trails that are owned by the Lake Stevens School District and private housing subdivisions, along with informal trails along a transmission line corridor. The city government also manages a community center near the city hall and library. Several local rowing clubs use Lake Stevens, including the in-city Lake Stevens Rowing Club that was founded in 1997. Historical preservation The Lake Stevens Historical Museum, opened in 1989 The local historical society operates a museum adjacent to the city library that opened in 1989 and includes exhibits with fixtures from historic buildings and a collection of documents and photographs. The museum grounds also includes the Grimm House, a historic house that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house was constructed in 1903 for a mill worker and moved to the museum grounds in 1996, later undergoing extensive renovations before opening for public tours in 2004. The Grimm House is owned by the city government and is planned to moved to a new location at North Cove Park as part of a redevelopment initiative. Notable people * Travis Bracht, singer * Jacob Eason, professional American football player * Cory Kennedy, professional skateboarder * Chris Pratt, actor Education The Lake Stevens School District operates a system of public schools within the city and surrounding areas, including a portion of southeastern Marysville. The school district had an enrollment of approximately 8,838 students in 2016, with 436 total teachers and 239 other staff. It has one high school, Lake Stevens High School, which opened at its current campus in 1979 and was approved for renovation work in 2016. The renovation cost $116 million and began construction in June 2018, opening its first phase in November 2019. The school district also has one mid-high school for grades 8‚Äì9, two middle schools, and seven elementary schools. The newest elementary school, Stevens Creek, opened in 2018 alongside an adjacent early learning center. The city's nearest post-secondary educational institutions are Everett Community College and Edmonds Community College. During the late 2000s, Lake Stevens was a leading candidate for a proposed branch campus of the University of Washington (UW). The city government presented a site on the southwest side of Cavalero Hill that was among the four finalists in 2007, but attracted controversy from neighbors for using land promised for a county park. The Lake Stevens proposal scored the lowest in a survey of the finalists and the project was abandoned entirely in 2008 due to a state budget shortfall. Library The Lake Stevens library, opened in 1985 and managed by Sno-Isle Libraries The city's public library is operated by Sno-Isle Libraries, an inter-county system that annexed Lake Stevens in 2008. Prior to the annexation, Sno-Isle was contracted to provide library service to the city-owned library, which opened in 1985 at a former pharmacy building. The downtown library building is the smallest in the Sno- Isle system and was determined to be unable to support the community's needs, necessitating plans for a replacement in the 2010s. Sno-Isle proposed a larger library with of space as part of a civic campus on Chapel Hill near Frontier Village, which would cost $17 million and be financed by a bond issue paid through property taxes. The bond was approved by voters in the February 2017 election, but fell 749 votes of meeting the turnout requirement to pass. A second attempt in February 2018 was also rejected after failing to meet the 60 percent threshold for bonds. Infrastructure=Transportation Looking west from Lake Stevens at the Hewitt Avenue Trestle, which carries U.S. Route 2 towards Everett Lake Stevens is traversed by three state highways that connect the area to other parts of Snohomish County: State Route 9, running north‚Äìsouth through the west of the city and continuing to Snohomish and Arlington; State Route 92, which continues northeast to Granite Falls; and State Route 204, which connects Frontier Village to U.S. Route 2 (US 2). The intersection of State Route 9 and State Route 204 and several roads around Frontier Village are planned to be replaced by a series of roundabouts after a proposed interchange was scrapped. The Hewitt Avenue Trestle, which carries US 2 to Everett, is a four-lane freeway that is frequently congested and is planned to be rebuilt to fix capacity issues. The city is also served by Community Transit, which operates bus routes between cities in Snohomish County. The agency provides all-day bus service from Lake Stevens to Everett, Granite Falls, Lynnwood, Marysville, and Snohomish. The city has a small park and ride that opened in 2004 and is served by direct commuter routes to the Boeing Everett Factory and Downtown Seattle during peak hours. Utilities The city's electric power and tap water are provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County. The PUD sources its water from the City of Everett system at Spada Lake and Lake Chaplain, which is delivered to Lake Stevens and Granite Falls. The city is also bisected by a pair of north‚Äìsouth electrical transmission lines operated by the Bonneville Power Administration that travel towards British Columbia. Natural gas for Lake Stevens residents and businesses is provided by Puget Sound Energy. The city government contracts with Republic Services and Waste Management to provide curbside collection and disposal of garbage, recycling, and yard waste for different areas of Lake Stevens. The Lake Stevens Sewer District, established in 1957, operates the city's sewer system and is planned to merge with the city government in 2032. The sewer district built a treatment plant in 2013 at a cost of $100 million, and the debt payments on the project have caused disputes with the city. Healthcare Lake Stevens has two urgent care centers that also provide medical services: a branch of The Everett Clinic (part of UnitedHealth Optum); and a MultiCare Indigo Urgent Care Clinic that opened in 2017.

The five lemma is not only valid for abelian categories but also works in the category of groups, for example. The five lemma can be thought of as a combination of two other theorems, the four lemmas, which are dual to each other. Statements Consider the following commutative diagram in any abelian category (such as the category of abelian groups or the category of vector spaces over a given field) or in the category of groups. file:5 lemma.svg The five lemma states that, if the rows are exact, m and p are isomorphisms, l is an epimorphism, and q is a monomorphism, then n is also an isomorphism. The two four-lemmas state: (1) If the rows in the commutative diagram file:4 lemma right.svg are exact and m and p are epimorphisms and q is a monomorphism, then n is an epimorphism. (2) If the rows in the commutative diagram file:4 lemma left.svg are exact and m and p are monomorphisms and l is an epimorphism, then n is a monomorphism. Proof The method of proof we shall use is commonly referred to as diagram chasing. We shall prove the five lemma by individually proving each of the two four lemmas. To perform diagram chasing, we assume that we are in a category of modules over some ring, so that we may speak of elements of the objects in the diagram and think of the morphisms of the diagram as functions (in fact, homomorphisms) acting on those elements. Then a morphism is a monomorphism if and only if it is injective, and it is an epimorphism if and only if it is surjective. Similarly, to deal with exactness, we can think of kernels and images in a function-theoretic sense. The proof will still apply to any (small) abelian category because of Mitchell's embedding theorem, which states that any small abelian category can be represented as a category of modules over some ring. For the category of groups, just turn all additive notation below into multiplicative notation, and note that commutativity of abelian group is never used. So, to prove (1), assume that m and p are surjective and q is injective. A proof of (1) in the case where t(c')=0. A proof of (1) in the case where t(c') eq 0. :file:4 lemma right.svg * Let c‚Ä≤ be an element of C‚Ä≤. * Since p is surjective, there exists an element d in D with p(d) = t(c‚Ä≤). * By commutativity of the diagram, u(p(d)) = q(j(d)). * Since im t = ker u by exactness, 0 = u(t(c‚Ä≤)) = u(p(d)) = q(j(d)). * Since q is injective, j(d) = 0, so d is in ker j = im h. * Therefore, there exists c in C with h(c) = d. * Then t(n(c)) = p(h(c)) = t(c‚Ä≤). Since t is a homomorphism, it follows that t(c‚Ä≤ ‚àí n(c)) = 0. * By exactness, c‚Ä≤ ‚àí n(c) is in the image of s, so there exists b‚Ä≤ in B‚Ä≤ with s(b‚Ä≤) = c‚Ä≤ ‚àí n(c). * Since m is surjective, we can find b in B such that b‚Ä≤ = m(b). * By commutativity, n(g(b)) = s(m(b)) = c‚Ä≤ ‚àí n(c). * Since n is a homomorphism, n(g(b) + c) = n(g(b)) + n(c) = c‚Ä≤ ‚àí n(c) + n(c) = c‚Ä≤. * Therefore, n is surjective. Then, to prove (2), assume that m and p are injective and is surjective. A proof of (2). :file:4 lemma left.svg * Let c in C be such that n(c) = 0. * t(n(c)) is then 0. * By commutativity, p(h(c)) = 0. * Since p is injective, h(c) = 0. * By exactness, there is an element b of B such that g(b) = c. * By commutativity, s(m(b)) = n(g(b)) = n(c) = 0. * By exactness, there is then an element a‚Ä≤ of A‚Ä≤ such that r(a‚Ä≤) = m(b). * Since is surjective, there is a in A such that . * By commutativity, . * Since m is injective, f(a) = b. * So c = g(f(a)). * Since the composition of g and f is trivial, c = 0. * Therefore, n is injective. Combining the two four lemmas now proves the entire five lemma. Applications The five lemma is often applied to long exact sequences: when computing homology or cohomology of a given object, one typically employs a simpler subobject whose homology/cohomology is known, and arrives at a long exact sequence which involves the unknown homology groups of the original object. This alone is often not sufficient to determine the unknown homology groups, but if one can compare the original object and sub object to well- understood ones via morphisms, then a morphism between the respective long exact sequences is induced, and the five lemma can then be used to determine the unknown homology groups.

It is located between the cities of Everett and Lynnwood, approximately northeast of Seattle. The city has a population of 18,244 as of the 2010 census, and is estimated to have over 20,000 residents as of 2018. The city lies along State Route 527 and North Creek, a tributary of the Sammamish River, on the east side of Interstate 5. The city is one of the wealthiest suburbs in the Seattle metropolitan area and was originally a planned community conceived in the 1970s. The planned development was centered around a country club and golf course, with other development occurring nearby in later phases. It was incorporated as a city in 1983, shortly after the completion of the first phase of development, and underwent major population growth due to continued suburban development and annexation of nearby areas. The city's downtown area is centered around the Mill Creek Town Center, a mixed-use lifestyle center and retail complex that opened in 2004. History=Development The Mill Creek area was originally settled in the early 20th century by various farming families, from whom several local placenames are now derived. After the construction of the Bothell‚ÄìEverett Highway in 1913 as part of the Pacific Highway, two junctions at Murphy's Corner and Wintermute's Corner gained small stores and gas stations to serve visitors. In 1931, Doctor Manch N. Garhart acquired in the area and used it to grow Gravenstein apples and Bartlett pears while also raising cattle. The Garhart property, named Lake Dell Farm for a small reservoir built by local families, was later sold in 1967 to real estate developers after the market for local lumber and fruits had declined. The Garhart property, along with several neighboring farms, were optioned by various real estate developers in the 1960s and 1970s as a potential master planned community due to its proximity to the recently completed Interstate 5. It would be the first modern planned city in Washington state, following in the footsteps of earlier planned cities like Longview, built in 1918. The community, named \\"Olympus\\", was planned to include in its first phase with for homes, an industrial park, a shopping center, and a golf course. After a local recession in the early 1970s, the development project was sold in 1973 to Tokyu Land Development and designed by a subsidiary of the Obayashi Corporation named United Development. The development was renamed \\"Mill Creek\\", beating out the Chinook Jargon word \\"Klahanie\\", although there had never been a mill in the vicinity and a waterway of that name was not present in the area until the 2000 renaming of Smokehouse Creek. Mill Creek's master plan was submitted to the county council in January 1974. A homeowners association was established in December 1974 with funding from United Development to manage the area's security patrol, street maintenance, and other tasks. The initial plan included consist of 4,600 homes, with eventual plans to house 12,000 people, a park, and an 18-hole golf course. Construction began in early 1975 on the golf course and adjoining country club, while the first homes were under construction by the following year. The first set of homes were designed to resemble country residences, with large floorplans and prominent use of wood furnishings, and sold for an average of $65,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars). Tokyu Land Development later re-used these home designs for the domestic market in Japan, where they were sold under the \\"Mill Creek\\" brand in the 1990s. The final phase of the original Mill Creek development, consisting of 33 condominiums, was completed in late 2003. Incorporation and annexations A majority of the first phase's 1,767 homes and condominiums were completed by early 1983, when an incorporation petition was submitted by residents after reaching the population threshold of 3,000 needed for cityhood. At the time, the homeowners association and county government had already provided much of the area's infrastructure and maintenance requirements, but local residents resisted attempts to raise property tax assessments. Mill Creek was officially incorporated as a city on September 30, 1983, ten days after a vote of residents passed, and encompassed . Mill Creek was the first new city to be incorporated in Snohomish County since Brier in 1965 and the newest in the state since Ocean Shores in 1970. In the years following incorporation, Mill Creek reduced its property tax rates and formed its own police department, library, postal address, and land-use board. The city's telephone system was split between three long-distance calling areas by GTE until the state utilities and transportation commission approved a consolidated calling area for toll-free service. Sid Hanson, the chairman of the incorporation committee, was elected as the city's first mayor and served a single term until declining to run for re-election in 1987. The city government's offices moved four times by the end of the decade, between various leased buildings that all served as temporary city halls. A separate post office serving the city was promised at the time of incorporation, but was not opened until 1994. The city attempted its first annexations in 1986, but an advisory vote of existing residents rejected one proposal and the city council deferred action on another. Mill Creek approved its first annexation, a parcel southeast of the main development, in July 1987, while the nearby city of Everett began its own annexations of areas to the north of Mill Creek. In 1989, the city proposed a major annexation of , a 25 percent increase in size, to add undeveloped commercial parcels on the west side of the Bothell‚ÄìEverett Highway. The western annexation was initially opposed by the county government, but was approved alongside four other annexations after Mill Creek agreed to share costs for road improvements to handle additional traffic demand. Everett attempted to annex the entire Murphy's Corner area in the late 1980s, but was forced to split the neighborhood at 132nd Street with Mill Creek after a decision by the state court of appeals and additional arbitration by boundary review boards. The Henry M. Jackson High School was opened in 1994 and is located on the Mill Creek side of Murphy's Corner, which was annexed the following year. A private high school, Archbishop Murphy High School, was opened in 1999 on a campus in northeastern Mill Creek. The Thomas Lake area in the northeastern corner of the city, bordered to the north by 132nd Street and east by Seattle Hill Road, was annexed in 2005 and added 2,200 residents to the city's population. The annexations of other developed subdivisions, lacking the original development's upscale image, created a divide between residents on the issue of further growth. Residents in several potential annexation targets preferred to be left alone by Mill Creek, due to its \\"snobbish\\" reputation, which faded as new neighborhoods were absorbed into the city. 21st century In the late 1980s, Mill Creek drafted a comprehensive plan that would transform its newly-annexed commercial area into a mixed-use downtown area to support the growing city. The downtown development would include a large public park, shopping areas, recreational facilities, multi-use trails, and office buildings. After difficulty in finding a suitable developer, the Mill Creek Town Center began construction in 2001 and the first phase opened three years later. The second phase was completed in 2007, with 26 retail buildings, a medical clinic, condominiums, and a downtown plaza. The Bothell‚ÄìEverett Highway (State Route 527) remained a two-lane rural highway through Mill Creek until the start of an expansion and improvement program in the 1990s. It was widened to four lanes with a center turn lane, and also gained bicycle lanes, sidewalks, and new landscaping features. The section through Mill Creek, from 164th Street to 132nd Street, was completed in 2006 and required the construction of retaining walls and detention ponds due to the limited space for the road. The project also included new bus stops that were later upgraded with the opening of the Swift Green Line bus rapid transit system in March 2019. The city government began planning for a second urban village, to be located in newly-annexed areas at the northeast edge of the city, in 2007. The retail and residential development, named the East Gateway, would have been located on along 132nd Street, and was originally slated to be anchored by a Wal-Mart until the company scrapped plans after protests from local residents. The eastern half of the development began construction in 2012 and will encompass 210 apartments, 104 townhouses, office space, and retail. Development of the remaining western half was approved in 2019 and branded as \\"The Farm at Mill Creek\\", consisting of 350 apartments, retail space, workforce housing units, and office space.

Monroe's population was 17,304 as of the 2010 census and was estimated to be 19,776 in 2019. Monroe was originally founded in 1864 as the town of Park Place, located at the river confluence among several existing settlements in the Tulaco Valley. The townsite was previously a trading post used by the indigenous Skykomish people. Park Place was renamed to Monroe in 1890 to honor U.S. President James Monroe, and was moved northeast to be near the tracks of the Great Northern Railway, which was constructed in 1892. Monroe was incorporated in 1902 and was selected as the home of a major condensed milk plant and the state reformatory. Monroe became a suburban bedroom community in the late 20th century, serving commuters to Everett, Seattle, and the Eastside. It is home to the Monroe Correctional Complex, which absorbed the original reformatory in 1998, and the Evergreen State Fair, which runs annually in late summer. The city is located at the junction of two highways, U.S. Route 2 and State Route 522, which were expanded in the late 20th century to serve commuters. History=Origins and establishment of Park Place The confluence of the Skykomish and Snoqualmie rivers had originally belonged to the indigenous Skykomish tribe, who predominantly occupied the area between modern-day Monroe and Index. The confluence itself was known as Tualco (Lushootseed: ), and a nearby Skykomish village named acted as a trade post between several Coast Salish groups. A separate settlement near modern-day Monroe was used by the S'dodohobc band of the Snohomish people. The land around the confluence was cleared into a prairie and used to cultivate berries, hazelnuts, and other plants. The Skykomish were among the tribes to sign the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855, effectively ceding their traditional territories, including the Tulaco and confluence areas. The area around modern-day Monroe was surveyed by George B. McClellan and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during their expedition to find a suitable pass for a railroad across the Cascade Mountains. The Treaty of Point Elliott was not fully ratified until 1859, but the first American settlers had already arrived and claimed squatters rights to homestead in the Skykomish Valley. Robert Smallman, an English immigrant, arrived in 1855 and was the first to homestead on the land around modern-day Monroe. He was followed by Henry McClurg, an appointed county commissioner, who settled in the area with his wife Martha in 1860. McClurg later founded the settlement of Park Place in 1864, on a site west of modern-day downtown Monroe. Two other settlers arrived in 1860: Salem Woods, who claimed a small prairie to the northeast of Tualco and was later elected county sheriff; and Charles Harriman, a territorial legislator who settled in Park Place. Park Place and Tulaco, located on opposite sides of the Skykomish River, grew with the arrival of more settlers in the 1860s and 1870s. A local school district, the second in the county, was established in 1869 by McClurg, and Park Place gained a post office in 1877 with Woods as postmaster. A ferry crossing the Skykomish River was established in 1882, several years prior to the start of regular steamship service on the river as far east as Sultan. The first roads in the area were surveyed in 1882, including an wagon road connecting Park Place to Snohomish in the west. During the 1880s, settlers in Park Place and Tulaco received their first shipment of dairy cattle and also began planting hops, which would briefly become a cash crop until the arrival of the hop aphid and economic panic of the 1890s ruined the harvest. Renaming and relocation The Wagner and Wilson sawmill, one of the largest in Monroe at the beginning of the 20th century The original Park Place post office and general store were abandoned and replaced by a new building that opened in 1890. John Vanasdlen, operator of new store, petitioned for the reopening of the post office but was rejected by the U.S. Post Office Department, which only allowed a single-word name for new offices. \\"Monroe\\" was chosen by Vanasdlen, with the input of McClurg, to honor of U.S. President James Monroe. The new post office for Monroe was granted by the U.S. Post Office Department on March 19, 1890. The Great Northern Railway chose a route over Stevens Pass in the late 1880s for its transcontinental railroad connecting Seattle to St. Paul, Minnesota, bringing new development to the Skykomish Valley. Monroe at Park Place was platted in 1890 and gained several new businesses, including a blacksmith, grocery store, a second hotel, and a butcher. The final survey for Great Northern in 1891 placed the railroad tracks northeast of Park Place, bypassing the settlement in favor of a straighter alignment to cross the Snohomish River south of downtown Snohomish. The railroad built a small depot named \\"Wales\\" on the homestead of Jack Stretch, who platted a settlement on the north side of the tracks that he named \\"Tye City\\" for Great Northern's locating engineer George Tye. Great Northern completed their railroad through the Skykomish Valley in January 1893, following additional work near Snohomish to rebuild a bridge that had been destroyed in a flood. In late 1892 and early 1893, several merchants in Park Place moved their buildings to the south side of Tye City using teams of oxen, horses, and a steam thresher. After the relocation of Vanasdlen's general store and post office, the settlement became known as Monroe. The completion of the railroad attracted lumber operations to the Monroe area, boosted by the opening of the first shingle mill in 1894 and the first sawmill on Woods Creek in 1897. A bridge across the Skykomish River was opened in 1894 to replace the ferry and the town's first church was established two years later. The county government chose a site north of Monroe for a 20-bed poor farm at the modern-day site of the Evergreen State Fairgrounds; it later became the Valley General Hospital. A cooperative of Monroe-area farmers built the city's first creamery in 1895, which was destroyed in a fire four years later and later rebuilt. By the end of the decade, Monroe had also gained a new school building, telephone service, a local newspaper, a full-time doctor, and paved sidewalks. Incorporation and new industries The freestanding Carnation Condensery Stack, constructed for a condensed milk plant that closed in 1928 and burned in a fire in 1944 On the morning of September 16, 1901, a fire started at the Odd Fellows community hall and spread to nearby buildings, destroying the only complete block of businesses in Monroe. The fire caused an estimated $8,100 in damage, but the businesses and buildings were rebuilt and within two years a permanent fire department was established. Monroe was incorporated as a fourth-class town on December 20, 1902, following an 88‚Äì37 vote in favor. At the time of incorporation, the area around Monroe had over 900 residents, five general stores, eight saloons, six restaurants, four sawmills, and five shingle mills. A new town hall building was completed in November 1908, costing $7,000 and paid for using a saloon license tax; the building now serves as the home of a local history museum. The new town government granted a municipal water franchise to a private company in 1903, sparking a conflict with local water companies. A competing water company unsuccessfully sued the town for franchise rights, but later acquired the original franchised company to operate Monroe's water. The town government proposed to acquire the system through a buyout, but their offers were rejected. A separate gravity water system was constructed by the town in 1923 that bankrupted the private system. The town government also granted franchises to private companies for electricity and a hospital in 1903. Monroe gained a new road to Snohomish in 1904, which was followed a year later by a new bridge over the Skykomish River on Lewis Street (now State Route 203). The state government chose Monroe as the site of the state's second reformatory in 1907, ahead of competing bids from Arlington and Sultan. The first inmate at the facility's temporary buildings in August 1908; construction of a permanent building, now part of the Monroe Correctional Complex, began in May 1910 and was completed later that year at a cost of $1.5 million. The Pacific Coast Condensed Milk Company opened a milk condensery in Monroe on August 29, 1908, serving 2,000 visitors on \\"Condenser Day\\". The plant was the largest producer of Carnation brand condensed milk and brought the city's population to 2,500 within two years of opening. Within a year, the plant was producing of condensed milk per day; the Carnation condensery was later closed in 1928 and destroyed in a fire on March 23, 1944. By the early 1910s, Monroe and the Cherry Valley were home to seven school districts serving rural communities in the surrounding area. A union high school was proposed to serve the students graduating from the seven districts and was opened on September 1, 1911. A new train depot was constructed by the Great Northern Railway in 1909 to serve the mainline as well as a branch line traversing the Snoqualmie Valley that was opened two years later by the Milwaukee Road. The local timber industry declined and was replaced by a larger reliance on agriculture, namely dairy, vegetable, and berry farms on the logged-off lands around Monroe. One of the largest farms in the area was a lettuce farm and meat-packing plant owned by Charles Frye, later the benefactor of the Frye Art Museum in Seattle. Civic projects and fairs During the 1920s, several of the larger industrial employers in Monroe expanded their operations and attracted new businesses to the area, including an early radio station. The county government opened a new 100-bed hospital on the poor farm complex in 1925 at a cost of $92,000, to provide services to local residents. By the end of the decade, the town had gained new churches, a new masonic hall, a larger condensery plant, and a movie theater. A greenhouse operated by the Great Northern Railway was established in 1926 to supply passengers and decorate trains with fresh flowers. The complex later expanded to include ten greenhouses, but were demolished in 1962. At the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, several lettuce farms in the Monroe area had folded and been acquired by the Frye Company, which provided employment through the decade for 1,000 residents. The farm was foreclosed in the late 1930s by a subsidiary of Great Northern after lettuce prices had declined. Service organizations in the town ran charity assistance programs for unemployed residents and their families, raising money from large employers to fund food and clothing donations. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) began civic improvement projects around Monroe in 1933, including repairs to damage caused by a major flood in February 1932. The WPA also funded road improvements and a new middle school with a small auditorium that is now home to the Wagner Performing Arts Center. The local granges of the Monroe area began organizing agricultural fairs and parades in the 1930s on a semi-regular basis. The county also had its own regular fair that was hosted in Snohomish and Granite Falls until the 1920s. The granges hosted the first Cavalcade of the Valleys in 1941, which was followed by the Snohomish County Fair at the poor farm grounds in 1946. The event was renamed the Evergreen State Fair in 1949 and has been hosted annually in Monroe ever since. The fairgrounds were bisected by U.S. Route 2, the successor to an earlier highway across Stevens Pass, which opened in 1949. Following the Great Depression and World War II, Monroe's economy became more reliant on agriculture and smaller industries. A frozen food processing facility was located in Monroe until 1958 and was later replaced with a seafood processor. By 1949, the local government had twice rejected proposals to become a third-class city because of the increased operating costs needed; it also lacked a full-time fire department. The Valley General Hospital was established in 1961 to replace the county-run general hospital on the poor farm complex. A major earthquake struck the Puget Sound region on April 29, 1965, causing severe damage to the original Monroe High School and its annex. The high school campus was demolished and replaced by a new building that opened in October 1968 and served the city until the modern campus was built in 1999. Great Northern was consolidated into the Burlington Northern Railroad in 1970, and the Monroe train depot was demolished in October of that year. Suburban growth State Route 522, a new state highway connecting Monroe to Bothell, was opened to traffic on February 10, 1965. The easier car access made Monroe into a bedroom community for Everett, Seattle, and the Eastside region, with new suburban subdivisions being built around the city and annexed by the end of the decade. A new state prison, the Twin Rivers Corrections Center, was opened in 1984 and brought new jobs to the area despite opposition from residents. The former Frye lettuce farm in western Monroe was sold in the late 1980s to an Eastside-based real estate developer, which proposed the \\"Fryelands\\" residential and industrial neighborhood. The Fryelands industrial park, once proposed for a Boeing 777 parts facility, was developed adjacent to another industrial park that was opened a decade earlier. The residential component of the development sold out in 1993 and began construction that year alongside other subdivisions in western Monroe. As part of mitigation for the Fryelands project, an artificial lake named Lake Tye was created to provide wetlands and a park for residents. Between 1990 and 2000, the population of the city doubled to over 13,000. The increased residential development in Monroe caused worsened congestion on State Route 522, which was named one of the most dangerous highways in the United States. The state government began a widening and safety improvement program in 1995 that has continued since then, gradually building four-lane sections for the highway and upgrading the remaining two-lane sections. During the 1990s and 2000s, several large strip malls and big-box stores were built along U.S. Route 2 north of downtown. The North Kelsey development in the early 2010s brought a controversial Walmart to Monroe, which was challenged by neighborhood activists for violating the city's plans for a pedestrian- friendly retail neighborhood. Since 2000, the Downtown Revitalization and Enhancement Association of Monroe (DREAM) has sponsored revitalization projects in downtown Monroe to preserve the city's main street. More recent development in Monroe has been concentrated in the northern hills, which were annexed into the city in the 2000s. Geography Aerial view of Monroe, looking east from Fryelands and Lake Tye Monroe is located in south-central Snohomish County near the confluence of the Skykomish and Snoqualmie rivers, which form the Snohomish River.

The city lies at the eastern end of the Snohomish River floodplain, with elevations that range from . The south and east edges of the city along the Skykomish River are within a 100-year flood hazard zone and also include habitats for migratory birds and game animals. The residential neighborhoods of Monroe lie within the watersheds of French Creek and Woods Creek, which both drain into the Skykomish River before its confluence with the Snoqualmie and Snohomish rivers. The surrounding area includes hills and plateaus that were formed from glacial till and gravel deposits from the Skykomish River. Monroe also sits on a local fault line that produced a pair of minor earthquakes on July 12, 2019, that were felt as far as Seattle and Vancouver without causing damage. Climate Monroe has a general climate similar to most of the Puget Sound lowlands, with dry summers and mild, rainy winters moderated by a marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. The majority of the region's precipitation arrives during the winter and early spring, and Monroe averages 177 days of precipitation per year. Monroe's location in the foothills of the Cascade Range brings additional precipitation compared to nearby communities, with annually compared to in Everett. Monroe rarely receives significant snowfall, with an average of per year since 1929. July is Monroe's warmest month, with average high temperatures of , while January is the coolest, at an average high of .

According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Monroe has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb). On March 30, 2017, an EF0 tornado struck Monroe and damaged several recreational vehicles at a dealership, but did not injure any people. Tornadoes are a rare occurrence in Western Washington, but the Puget Sound Convergence Zone is able to provide the necessary conditions to create one.

The district has one middle school and three elementary schools within Monroe city limits, several of which were renovated in 2018 using $111 million in bonds. It also operates alternative education centers for multiple grade levels, including the Sky Valley Educational Center in the former Monroe Middle School building, which was closed after the consolidation of the three middle schools into two buildings. The school district's administrative offices are located in the former Central Grade School building, which opened in 1916. Monroe is also home to the East Campus of Everett Community College with 400 enrolled students. The branch campus opened in 1999 as part of an agreement with the Monroe School District and relocated to a new building near Lake Tye in 2010. Infrastructure=Transportation Monroe is located at the intersection of three highways: U.S. Route 2 (US 2), which travels eastward from Everett and over Stevens Pass to Eastern Washington; State Route 203, which follows the Snoqualmie River south towards Fall City and North Bend; State Route 522, an expressway which terminates in Monroe and connects the area to Seattle and Bothell to the southwest. Other major roads in Monroe include Main Street, which continues beyond the city limits towards Snohomish and Sultan; North Kelsey Street, which continues north to Chain Lake; and Fryelands Boulevard on the west edge of the city. US 2 is routinely congested through the Monroe area and plans for a highway bypass have been proposed since the 1970s, but it remains unfunded. The city is bisected by the Scenic Subdivision, a major railroad owned by BNSF Railway that is used for freight and Amtrak's Empire Builder passenger service. Public transit in Monroe is provided by the countywide Community Transit system, with two local bus routes traveling along the US 2 corridor between Everett and Gold Bar, with some trips during peak periods continuing to the Boeing Everett Factory. A commuter bus route from Snohomish to Downtown Seattle runs during peak periods on State Route 522 and Interstate 405, stopping at a park and ride lot in Monroe with 102 stalls. Snoqualmie Valley Transportation operates a daily shuttle service between Monroe and Duvall on weekdays. Monroe also has a privately owned airfield, First Air Field, located adjacent to the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The single-runway facility handles an average of 50 takeoffs and landings per day and has 73 aircraft based there. Utilities The city's public utilities are provided by the municipal government, regional agencies, and private companies. Electrical services in Monroe are provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County. The Snohomish County PUD delivers electricity to Monroe via a transmission corridor from their Snohomish substation to two substations in the city. Puget Sound Energy provides natural gas service to the city's residents and businesses using a pipeline from Canada. Telecommunications services, including telephones, cable television, and internet, are split between Verizon and Comcast. The city government has a waste disposal contract with Waste Management, which provides curbside garbage, recycling, and yard waste collection. The city government manages tap water and sewage services, which includes treatment and delivery. Monroe's tap water is purchased from the City of Everett and sourced from Lake Chaplain in the Sultan River basin, which travels via a pipeline to the north of the city. Sewage and wastewater is collected and cleaned at a sewage treatment plant that discharges into the Skykomish River. The largest customer for the city's water services is the Washington State Department of Corrections, which also has its own sewage treatment system. Health care The EvergreenHealth Monroe Medical Center Monroe has a 112-bed general hospital operated by EvergreenHealth and formerly known as the Valley General Hospital. It was opened in 1949, replacing a facility at the State Poor Farm, and was expanded several times with funds from voter-approved tax levies. It was merged into the EvergreenHealth system, based out of Kirkland, in 2014 and renamed to EvergreenHealth Monroe Medical Center the following year. The city also has several small medical clinics, including those operated by Providence Health & Services and SeaMar Community Health Centers.

It is located on the Puget Sound between Edmonds and Everett, approximately north of Seattle. The city had a population of 20,254 at the 2010 census and an estimated 2019 population of 21,441. The current site of Old Town Mukilteo was inhabited by the Snohomish people prior to the arrival of American settlers in the 19th century. The Treaty of Point Elliott was signed in Mukilteo in 1855, opening the region to settlement. A new town was founded at Mukilteo and became the provisional county seat of Snohomish County in early 1861. The area remained a trading post for loggers and was home to other industries, but was overshadowed by Everett and grew slowly. Mukilteo was used during World War II as an auxiliary fueling facility, due to its proximity to the newly built Snohomish County Airport (now Paine Field). Mukilteo was incorporated as a city in 1947 and saw new suburban development, which accelerated after the opening of the nearby Boeing Everett Factory in the late 1960s. The city annexed large suburban areas on the west side of Paine Field in the 1980s and 1990s, including Harbour Pointe and the State Route 525 corridor, while also revitalizing the Old Town area in the 2000s. Today, Mukilteo is a bedroom community with a small job base centered around manufacturing industries. It is also a major transportation hub, with connections to Whidbey Island via the Washington State Ferries system, Sounder commuter trains to Seattle, and public transit services to nearby cities. The city is recognized for its quality of life and is one of the most affluent in Washington state, with a high median income. History=Establishment and early history A photograph of American settlers and Native Americans on the beach in Mukilteo, 1861‚Äì62 The Lushootseed name Muckl-te-oh or Buk-wil-tee-whu (), meaning \\"good camping ground\\" or \\"narrow passage\\" according to some sources, was given to the headland and nearby waters by the Snohomish people. The Snohomish had a year-round village in the area for at least 600 years before the arrival of European and American explorers in the 19th century. Early artifacts uncovered during waterfront construction in the 2010s were carbon dated to 1,000 years before present. The Vancouver Expedition, led by British explorer George Vancouver, visited the area on May 30, 1792, and landed at modern-day Mukilteo the following day. Lieutenant William Robert Broughton and botanist Archibald Menzies named the site \\"Rose Point\\" after the wild Nootka roses that grew along the shore. An American expedition led by Charles Wilkes in 1841 renamed the headland \\"Point Elliott\\" for Samuel Elliott, a midshipman. After its 1853 establishment, the Washington territorial government looked to negotiate treaties with the local tribes of the Puget Sound region to secure land for settlement. On January 22, 1855, representatives from the territorial government and 82 local tribes signed the Treaty of Point Elliott, which ceded tribal territories in exchange for compensation, the establishment of Indian reservations, and access to traditional hunting and fishing areas. An American settlement at Point Elliott was established two years later by Morris H. Frost and J. D. Fowler, two merchants from New York. The two men established a store and saloon on the southwest side of Point Elliott, which was renamed to Mukilteo in 1860 by Fowler, using an anglicized name of the Lushootseed campsite. Mukilteo was the area's first trading post and served as the interim county seat of the newly created Snohomish County beginning January 14, 1861. In the first county elections on July 8, 1861, the county seat was moved to Cadyville (now Snohomish) by a 17‚Äì10 vote. Mukilteo remained the county's only port and a major trading post for the Possession Sound region, and soon after received the county's first post office and telegraph station. The town was relocated to another, more protected side of Point Elliott and supported the regional lumber industry, including regular shipments to Whidbey Island and a sawmill of its own. By the 1880s, it had also gained a brewery, a gunpowder plant, and the Puget Sound region's first cannery. Mukilteo was planned to become the largest port on Possession Sound, with a summer resort accessible by steamship, but the efforts ceased after the establishment of nearby Everett by East Coast industrialists. Early 20th century The former Rosehill School, constructed in 1928 and later converted into a alt=A three-story building painted light blue with a brown roof, seen from a nearby street. The Seattle and Montana Railroad (later part of the Great Northern Railway) was completed in 1891, connecting Mukilteo with Everett, Edmonds, and Seattle. Mukilteo was platted in anticipation of the railroad and was on the shortlist of towns considered for the terminus of the Great Northern, but lost out to Tacoma in 1873. Following the 1890s economic depression, the town experienced a major employment and population boom, with a larger lumber mill and gunpowder factory both built along the shore. The iconic Mukilteo Lighthouse was built in 1906 by the federal Lighthouse Service to serve the increased maritime traffic in the area. Japanese immigrants arrived to work in Mukilteo's mills after the turn of the century, establishing a Japantown in modern-day Japanese Gulch. Passenger ferry service between Mukilteo and Whidbey Island began in 1911 and was followed by the introduction of automobile ferry service in 1919. The town also gained a highway connection in 1914 with the completion of Mukilteo Boulevard, which traveled east to Everett. Until the closure of the lumber mill in 1930, Mukilteo was a company town that relied on the Crown Lumber Company to assist in civic endeavors, including its parks, fire department, and water district; at its peak, it employed 250 men. During the Prohibition Era, Mukilteo became a major transiting point for rum-running and was a stopover for smugglers transporting alcohol from British Columbia to Seattle. The town's gunpowder plant was destroyed on September 17, 1930, in an after-hours explosion that leveled or damaged dozens of homes, causing $500,000 in damage. It was felt as far as downtown Everett and injured eight people, but none were killed. On August 30, 1938, the vacant lumber mill was destroyed in a fire during dismantling work. The fire came weeks after a mail ferry rammed into the town's wharf, which was destroyed in the collision. After the United States entered World War II, the site of the former lumber mill was acquired by the federal government and rebuilt as a ammunition loading dock for warships. The recently built Snohomish County Airport (later renamed Paine Field) southeast of the city was converted into a military base while retaining some civilian uses, including passenger service provided by Alaska Airlines. During the early 1950s, the loading dock was expanded with ten large storage tanks that were used to store jet fuel for military planes until 1989. Incorporation and late 20th century Aerial view of alt=Aerial view of an airport with several runways and taxiways, surrounded by warehouses and other buildings. On April 29, 1947, Mukilteo residents voted 223 to 137 in favor of incorporating as a fourth- class city and elected school administrator Alfred Tunem as its first mayor. The incorporation was certified by the state government on May 8; at the time, Mukilteo had an estimated population of 775 people and encompassed . The new municipal government took over services that were previously handled by the self-organized Mukilteo Improvement Club, which was established in the 1930s. The area experienced additional population and commercial growth after the opening of Boeing's Paine Field factory for passenger jetliners in 1967, which was connected to Mukilteo by a short railroad along the floor of Japanese Gulch. The Boeing Freeway was opened in 1969, linking southern Mukilteo and the Boeing plant to a junction with Interstate 5 near the newly built Everett Mall. Mukilteo completed its first major annexation in November 1980, adding 2,500 people living on to the south along State Route 525. This annexation nearly tripled the city's population and doubled its land area. Additional annexations and natural growth by the end of the decade brought the city's population to 6,000. The annexation of the large Harbour Pointe community was completed in 1991 and doubled the city's size to . A competing proposal had sought to incorporate the planned community into a new city of 24,000 people, tentatively named Highland Bay, but residents supported annexation as a mutually agreeable option to reduce their taxes and benefit from city services. The annexation was also influenced by the county government's plans to allow passenger flights from Paine Field, which residents in Mukilteo and Harbour Pointe opposed alongside other nearby cities. The county ultimately withdrew their proposal to introduce passenger flights. Several parties that opposed the annexation, including the county fire district, withdrew their complaints and allowed Mukilteo to annex Harbour Pointe on March 26, 1991. The annexation added 4,779 residents and to Mukilteo, doubling the city's population to 6,662 and size to . It required the construction of two new fire stations, three schools, and a new city hall to house new employees. Kamiak High School was built in the Harbour Pointe area and opened in 1993 to serve Mukilteo, which had outgrown Mariner High School, and featured a technology- oriented curriculum. The full build-out of Harbour Pointe increased the city's population to over 18,000 by 2000, a 1,164 percent increase from 1980. The geographic and commercial center of Mukilteo was shifted further south towards Harbour Pointe, leading to cultural clashes with residents of older neighborhoods. 21st century alt=A ferry boat stopped at a wooden pier with a bridge, pilings, and a tower. An agreement to transfer ownership of the Mukilteo Lighthouse from the U.S. Coast Guard to the city government was signed in 1999 after a decade of partial use as a museum by the local historical society. The changeover was made in 2001, with the Coast Guard retaining use of the working lights and the city government planning rehabilitation work to support the building's use as a tourist landmark. The adjacent Mukilteo State Park was transferred to the city government in February 2003, following an offer from the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission to donate the park in order to stave off a budget shortfall. The new city park, named Mukilteo Lighthouse Park, underwent $6.6 million in renovations that were completed in 2008 to add a playground and other park amenities. The decommissioned fuel storage tank complex on the city's waterfront was identified for potential redevelopment in the 1990s, including use for a new ferry terminal. The Port of Everett led environmental cleanup of the site and constructed a new pier to transport large airplane sections for the Boeing 787 project, replacing the existing pier. The cleanup was completed in late 2006 after several delays due to the discovery of Indian artifacts that triggered an archaeological investigation. The existing pier was demolished in 2015 to make way for the new ferry terminal, which is planned to cost $167 million and open in 2020. The new terminal will include connections to the city's commuter rail station, which opened in 2008 and was expanded in 2016. A research station for the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (part of NOAA) on the tank farm site is planned to be moved into a new facility in 2020. On July 30, 2016, a mass shooting occurred at a house party in the Chennault Beach neighborhood of Mukilteo, around midnight. Three people were killed using an AR-15 style rifle and another was left with serious injuries. The perpetrator, a graduate of Kamiak High School, was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Mukilteo shooting, one of several mass shootings in the state in the 2010s, was cited as the inspiration for an assault weapons restriction that was rejected by the state legislature and passed by voters in 2018 as Initiative 1639. In February 2018, an Everett resident was arrested prior to a planned school shooting that would have targeted ACES Alternative High or Kamiak High School. On May 2, 2017, a small airplane taking off from Paine Field crashed into several cars and an overhead power line at the intersection of Harbour Pointe Boulevard and the Mukilteo Speedway. There were no fatalities and only two minor injuries, while the pilot and sole passenger were unhurt. Geography Aerial view of Mukilteo's downtown waterfront, with Whidbey Island in the background Mukilteo is located in southwestern Snohomish County, approximately north of Seattle. The city generally runs north‚Äìsouth, with a length of and a width of . It is bordered to the west by the Possession Sound, a section of the Puget Sound, and to the north by Port Gardner Bay. Mukilteo's eastern border with Everett is defined by 44th Avenue and Japanese Gulch until it reaches State Route 526. From there, the city's eastern boundary continues along State Route 525 along the west side of Paine Field in unincorporated Snohomish County. Mukilteo's southern border, also facing unincorporated neighborhoods, is defined by Beverly Park Road, the Picnic Point Ravine, and Hulk Creek, which drains into Possession Sound. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Mukilteo also has a designated urban growth area that extends south to 148th Street Southwest, bordering Lynnwood, and east to State Route 99. An advisory vote on whether to annex the entire urban growth area (with a population of 11,000 people) was rejected by city voters in 2010. The majority of Mukilteo is located on a plateau overlooking Possession Sound and the Olympic Mountains to the west and Port Gardner Bay to the north. A major railroad runs along the shore, which is situated below a set of tall bluffs that are divided by ravines and gulches along several creeks. The bluffs were formed approximately 5,000 years before present and eroded away over time to form beaches and Point Elliott itself. The city has several recognized drainage basins, including Japanese Gulch, Big Gulch, the Chennault Ravines, and Picnic Point Gulch. Mukilteo is also traversed from northwest to southeast by the Southern Whidbey Island Fault, a shallow earthquake fault zone discovered in 1996. Neighborhoods The Mukilteo alt=A building with a triangular, green roof and several windows. With the exception of Old Town Mukilteo, the city is divided into several large neighborhoods that are named for various developed subdivisions that were annexed in the late 20th century. Among these subdivision neighborhoods are Chennault Beach, Harbour Pointe, Olympus Terrace, and Picnic Point. Mukilteo's urban growth area includes the neighborhoods of Lake Serene, Meadowdale, and Lake Stickney. Old Town Mukilteo is located at the north end of the city, between Port Gardner Bay and 5th Street (Mukilteo Boulevard). The city's landmark lighthouse is located on Point Elliott at the northwest corner of Old Town, adjacent to the Washington State Ferries terminal and commuter train station. The waterfront's sole connection to the rest of Mukilteo is via the Mukilteo Speedway (State Route 525), which also serves ferry traffic; a second street, Mukilteo Lane, was closed in 2008 after severe erosion was discovered along the road. Mukilteo's largest neighborhood is Harbour Pointe, located on in the south-central part of the city between Possession Sound and State Route 525. It is bordered to the south by South Gulch and Picnic Point and to the north by Big Gulch and Olympus Terrace. The site was originally owned by the Port Gamble Lumber Company and was sold to Standard Oil in 1952 as part of a plan to build an oil refinery at Picnic Point. After protests over a similar proposal for Kayak Point in the 1960s, Standard Oil abandoned plans to build refineries in Snohomish County and turned over the Picnic Point site to the county government and private real estate developers. Development of Harbour Pointe began in 1978 and its first phase was completed in 1989 with the opening of the neighborhood's golf course. A public marina was proposed for the development's Chenault Beach section in 1983, but was rejected due to concerns from fisheries officials over potential impacts on Indian fishing. Harbour Pointe was annexed by Mukilteo in 1991 and is now home to Kamiak High School, the city library, and a large industrial district. Climate Mukilteo has a general climate similar to most of the Puget Sound lowlands, with dry summers and mild, rainy winters moderated by a marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. On average, the area gets of annual precipitation, spread over approximately seven months. Mukilteo lies within the Puget Sound Convergence Zone, a local weather phenomenon that affects areas of Snohomish County. Economy Mukilteo is primarily a bedroom community, with a concentration of employers at an industrial park near Harbour Pointe and several small office parks. The Puget Sound Regional Council estimated that the city had a total of 10,557 jobs , with the largest share in the manufacturing and services sectors. The largest employer in Mukilteo is the Mukilteo School District, followed by the Boeing Technical Center in Harbour Pointe, with over 1,200 employees. Mukilteo also has several companies that are headquartered or based in the city, including aerospace firm Electroimpact, audio equipment manufacturer Rane, laser manufacturer Synrad, and stovemaker Travis Industries. , Mukilteo has an estimated workforce population of 16,935 and an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent. Under 7 percent of the city's workers have jobs located within Mukilteo city limits, with the majority commuting to employers in other cities. Over 26 percent of workers commute to Everett, home to the Boeing Assembly Plant and the county government. An estimated 19 percent travel to Seattle, 6 percent to Bellevue, and 5 percent to Lynnwood. Demographics Mukilteo is the ninth largest city in Snohomish County, with an estimated population of 21,240 in 2017. The city has a significant population of Asian American residents, which began growing in the late 1980s.

Government and politics alt=A brown building with two stories, a large glass atrium, and a flagpole. The City of Mukilteo operates as a non-charter code city with a mayor‚Äìcouncil government, consisting of a mayor and a seven-member city council who are elected to four-year terms. Elections for the at-large positions are held in odd-numbered years and conducted in a nonpartisan manner, with city council seats staggered for a maximum of four seats per election. Former city councilwoman Jennifer Gregerson was elected as mayor in 2013 and re-elected in 2017. Management of the city government was also delegated to a full-time city administrator until the position was eliminated in 2014. A proposal to create the position of city manager and change to a council‚Äìmanager form of government was rejected by voters in the November 2019 elections. The city government has 113 full-time employees and operated in 2016 on a budget of $32 million that is predominantly funded by sales taxes. Mukilteo maintains its own police and fire services, as well as departments for recreation, planning, and public works. Other services, including utilities, garbage collection, public transportation, and the library, are contracted to regional agencies and organizations. Mukilteo's city hall is located in Harbour Pointe and was constructed in 2008, costing $8.5 million and integrating recycled materials and other environmentally friendly features. The city hall was formerly housed at the Rosehill Community Center in Old Town and was temporarily moved to a leased Harbour Pointe warehouse in 1992 to accommodate more employees. After initially approving a site near the Rosehill Center in Old Town, the city government chose the Harbour Pointe site in 2006 as a compromise between disagreeing factions of the city council. At the federal level, Mukilteo has been part of the 2nd congressional district since 2012 and is represented by Democrat Rick Larsen of Arlington. Prior to post-census redistricting in 2012, Mukilteo was part of the 1st congressional district and was represented by Jay Inslee. At the state level, the city and Edmonds comprise the 21st legislative district, which is represented by senator Marko Liias and representatives Strom Peterson and Lillian Ortiz-Self. Mukilteo is wholly part of the Snohomish County Council's 2nd district, represented by former mayor and state legislator Brian Sullivan. Culture=Events The city's main annual festival is the three-day Mukilteo Lighthouse Festival, held at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park in late August or early September. It was established in 1965 and features a parade, fireworks, a fishing derby, and fun runs. The city also organizes a farmers' market at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park that runs on weekends during the summer months; the 2019 season of the farmers' market was canceled due to a shortage of volunteers and a declined request for city officials to take over the event. Parks and recreation alt=A sandy beach on an overcast day, with people fishing and wandering about. Pieces of driftwood litter the beach, but have been cleared away near the water. Mukilteo has of total open space, including of public parks and of privately owned open spaces, that occupy 13 percent of the city's total land area. The city's largest open spaces are conservation areas in the Big Gulch and Japanese Gulch drainage basins. Mukilteo's parks are maintained by a city department that is also tasked with organizing recreational programs for citizens; it was funded by a 1996 ballot measure that was approved by voters. In addition to city-owned parks and public spaces, Mukilteo is also located near Picnic Point Park, a county park along Puget Sound southwest of Harbour Pointe. The Old Town neighborhood has several of the city's major parks, including Mukilteo Lighthouse Park, a former state park that was acquired by Mukilteo in 2003 and is the city's most-used park facility. The park includes a beach, boat launch, playground, and picnic areas. To the southeast of the waterfront park is the Rosehill Community Center, the city's main multi-purpose recreation center. It was built in 2011 to replace the existing community center, a former school that opened in 1928 and was re-purposed for various uses between the 1970s and its demolition in 2010. The Japanese Gulch conservation area, located between Old Town and Paine Field, is the most-used natural area in Mukilteo. The area is predominately forests and wetlands that are home to a variety of birds, as well as salmon, deer, and mountain beavers. It has several hiking trails that were developed by Japanese immigrants who settled in the gulch in the early 20th century. The city government acquired land in the gulch in stages between 1996 and 2014. The city's largest conservation area, Big Gulch, is located near Harbour Pointe and comprises of protected land and of trails. At the northeast corner of Big Gulch is Mukilteo's largest neighborhood park is 92nd Street Park, which spans along the Mukilteo Speedway. It includes a playground, hiking trails, picnic tables, and a dog park. Media Mukilteo's public library is operated by the inter-county Sno-Isle Libraries system and is located in Harbour Pointe. It was opened in 1998 after the city's voters approved an annexation into the library system, two years after the city-run library was closed due to budget cuts. The city's main newspaper is the Mukilteo Beacon, a weekly publication founded in 1992 that has sister papers in Edmonds and Mill Creek. Mukilteo is also covered by The Everett Herald and The Seattle Times, the region's daily newspapers.

It serves a population of 93,222, or nearly quintuple the city population, across and has a student enrollment of approximately 15,000. Seven of the district's 24 schools are located within Mukilteo city limits, including Kamiak High School, two middle schools, and four elementary schools. Kamiak High School opened in 1993 to relieve the overcrowded Mariner High School and boasts a high student graduation rate of 94 percent. Mukilteo is located near two community colleges‚ÄîEdmonds and Everett‚Äîthat offer two-year degree programs. The city also has three private schools catered towards preschool and kindergarten education. Infrastructure=Transportation alt=A train station with two tracks and two platforms on each side, connected by an overhead glass bridge Downtown Mukilteo is a multimodal transportation hub that is served by state highways, ferries, commuter trains, and buses. The city is bisected from north to south by State Route 525, also known as the Mukilteo Speedway, which connects the downtown ferry terminal to Harbour Pointe, State Route 99, and Interstate 5. State Route 526 (the Boeing Freeway) travels from west to east and provides direct connections to the Boeing Everett Factory and Interstate 5. Other major roads include Mukilteo Boulevard, which connects the city to Everett, and Harbour Pointe Boulevard, which encircles the eponymous neighborhood and golf course. State Route 525 continues north from Mukilteo to Whidbey Island on the Clinton ferry, which is operated by Washington State Ferries. The Clinton‚ÄìMukilteo ferry route is the state's busiest for automobiles and second-busiest overall, carrying 4 million passengers and 2.2 million vehicles annually. The Mukilteo ferry terminal was built in 1952 and is planned to be replaced with a new terminal, which began construction in 2018 and is scheduled to open in 2020. The city is also served by three public transportation agencies: Sound Transit, which runs Sounder commuter trains from Mukilteo station to Seattle during peak periods on weekdays; and local buses operated by Community Transit and Everett Transit. Community Transit's buses include a local route connecting Mukilteo and Harbour Pointe to Lynnwood; commuter express routes to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington campus; and a commuter bus connecting Lynnwood Transit Center to the Boeing Everett Factory. Everett Transit operates a single route in Mukilteo, connecting downtown and the ferry terminal to Everett via Mukilteo Boulevard. Mukilteo is the largest city in Snohomish County without a dedicated park and ride facility for Community Transit. Paine Field is located southeast of Mukilteo and serves the Boeing Everett Factory, as well as general aviation and passenger flights, which resumed in 2019. The passenger terminal and general aviation facilities are located on the east side of the airport, facing Everett, while the west side in Mukilteo has two museums, the Future of Flight Aviation Center (which includes a tour of the Boeing factory) and the Historic Flight Foundation. The Mukilteo city government has opposed the airport's use for passenger flights since the 1990s, citing concerns about noise pollution and traffic congestion. Utilities Electric power in Mukilteo is provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County. Puget Sound Energy provides natural gas service to the city's residents and businesses. The city government also contracts with Waste Management and Rubatino Refuse Removal for curbside garbage, recycling, and yard waste collection and disposal. Mukilteo's tap water and sewage systems are managed by the Mukilteo Water and Wastewater District and the Alderwood Water District, two independent municipal corporations. The Mukilteo district, founded in 1920, serves most of the city and part of south Everett; the Alderwood district extends into Edmonds and Lynnwood. The city government formerly operated its own sewage treatment plant and the wastewater system until contracting in the 1990s with the Olympus Terrace Sewer District, which was merged into the Mukilteo district in 2007. The Big Gulch Wastewater Plant near Harbour Pointe was opened in 1970 and now serves as the main outflow from Mukilteo and the rest of the water district. A major submarine communications cable system named Pacific Crossing (operated by TE Connectivity) uses fiber- optic cables that travel from Mukilteo and Grover Beach, California, to the Japanese cities of Hitachinaka and Shima. The cable's switching center is in Harbour Pointe and provides 80 gigabyte per second for data transfers. Health care Mukilteo is located near two general hospitals: the Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett and Swedish Edmonds Hospital in Edmonds.

The area, developed as a suburban bedroom community in the late 20th century, was annexed into the nearby cities of Arlington and Marysville in the 1990s and 2000s. History Smokey Point was settled in the early 20th century and was originally known as Rex Corner, named in the 1930s after the owner of a restaurant located at U.S. Route 99 and Lakewood Road (present-day Smokey Point Boulevard and 172nd Street NE, respective). The restaurant was sold to Eric and Pearl Shurstad in 1946, who renovated it to a barbecue restaurant and renamed it the \\"Smokey Point Caf√©\\". U.S. Route 99 was bypassed by Interstate 5 in the late 1960s, constructing an interchange at Smokey Point and creating the Gissberg Ponds (now Twin Lakes) out of a gravel excavation site. In 1966, the area was proposed as the location of a four-year public college, with offered by the city of Arlington. The state legislature decided to build the college instead in Olympia, becoming The Evergreen State College. By 1977, the population of the unincorporated area between Arlington and Marysville, including Smokey Point, had increased to 16,000 people as the result of suburban development. In 1979, the Snohomish County Sherriff's Office established a precinct in Smokey Point at an existing fire station. By the early 1990s, Smokey Point was rezoned to support industrial development to offset a regional shortage of affordable land for industrial use. After the opening of a new naval base in Everett in 1994, the U.S. Navy selected Smokey Point to house a support complex with a commissary, offices and a college. The support complex broke ground in 1993 and opened in 1995. The Puget Sound Regional Council explored the expansion of Arlington Municipal Airport into a regional airport in the 1990s to relieve Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport, but decided instead to build a third runway at Sea-Tac because of existing traffic and local opposition. In September 2004, Marysville won a bid to build a NASCAR racetrack (to be operated by the International Speedway Corporation) south of Smokey Point. The project was cancelled two months later after concerns about traffic impacts, environmental conditions, and $70 million in required transportation improvements arose. The NASCAR site was later pitched as a candidate for a new University of Washington satellite campus (known as UW North Sound) in the late 2000s, competing with downtown Everett, before the project was put on hold in 2008 and cancelled in 2011. Annexation dispute In the early 1990s, after a controversial land-use was proposed for the area, several property owners began an effort to petition the City of Arlington to annex a large portion of the Smokey Point community. Around the same time, another group of property owners began an effort to annex much of the same territory into the City of Marysville. The group working on annexing into Arlington was able to reach the required 60% assessed value threshold first, enabling their annexation to move forward. The City of Marysville, having a vested interest by being the sewer and water utility provider for the area and having an interest in annexing Smokey Point, challenged the annexation, along with the residential community whose property was added to the annexation boundaries by the state Boundary Review Board for Snohomish County. At that time, there was a single Arlington-Smokey Point-Marysville Urban Growth Boundary, causing confusion as to what city could potentially annex which area of Smokey Point. After many meetings with Snohomish County officials, the two cities ended up with separate urban growth boundaries for future annexation. Arlington was given the northeast portion of Smokey Point; Marysville was given the western and southern portions. However, when this proposal was presented to the local community, there was overwhelming opposition, as the community desired to have their entire community be annexed into one city, not split between two. The County Council had the final say and approved the territory divisions. To further complicate things, there was a little-known state law on the books that would have transitioned the annexed territory from the Lakewood School District that served Smokey Point to the school district of the annexing city. Being that nearly all of the commercial area of Smokey Point was petitioned to be annexed into Arlington, the loss of such a tax base would have been devastating to the Lakewood School District. Local residents in Smokey Point and Lakewood also circulated petitions to incorporate the area as a separate city to preserve the school district's taxing base. Because of these issues, local residents in the area formed a group called Save Our Community and Schools (SOCS). SOCS worked tirelessly with their local state representatives to change the law to protect the Lakewood School District. Those efforts were successful, and the Lakewood School District remains intact today. After receiving much input from the local community with the desire to keep their community intact, SOCS filed a Notice of Intent for Incorporation, which would create the City of Smokey Point-Lakewood. The proposal was put on hold, however, since state law mandated that incorporations cannot occur while an annexation involving land in the same area is still pending. After years of controversial court battles, lawsuits, redrawn boundaries, and strong opposition by the residential community, the annexation question was finally resolved in 1999, when the City of Arlington annexed the northeast portion of Smokey Point. The actual land annexed was but a small percentage of the originally-petitioned area, due to the redrawn urban growth boundaries. As a result of the annexation, the effort to keep the Smokey Point community intact ended, along with the hopes of incorporation. As expected, in the years since then, the southern and western portions of Smokey Point have been annexed into the City of Marysville. Recent commercial growth There has been substantial commercial growth in Smokey Point in recent years. Most recently, the western side of Smokey Point (within the City of Marysville) has received much of this growth. In late 2006, the commercial area called \\"Lakewood Crossing\\" opened, just west of the Interstate 5 exit to Smokey Point (exit 206), with Costco and Target, and Red Robin as the first tenants to open. Best Buy, Office Depot, and Petco are among some of the other businesses located here. On the eastern side of Smokey Point (within the City of Arlington), a Wienerschnitzel and Taco Del Mar restaurant opened in May 2007, a Wal-Mart opened in Winter 2010 and in 2011 Smokey Point Bakery Cafe opened. A stretch of Smokey Point Boulevard was developed into an auto row in the late 2010s, with several car dealerships relocating from Marysville.

Snohomish is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. The population was 9,098 at the 2010 census. It is located on the Snohomish River, southeast of Everett and northwest of Monroe. Snohomish lies at the intersection of U.S. Route 2 and State Route 9. The city's airport, Harvey Airfield, is located south of downtown and used primarily for general aviation. The city was founded in 1859 and named Cadyville for pioneer settler E. F. Cady and renamed to Snohomish in 1871. It served as county seat of Snohomish County from 1861 to 1897, when the county government was relocated to Everett. Snohomish has a downtown district that is renowned for its collection of antique shops and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The mayor of Snohomish is John T. Kartak and the city administrator is Steve Schuller. History The Snohomish River Valley was originally inhabited by the Snohomish people, a Coast Salish tribe who lived between Port Gardner Bay and modern-day Monroe. An archaeological site near the confluence of the Snohomish and Pilchuck Rivers has indications of human habitation that began as early as 8,000 years before present. The Snohomish had contact with white explorers in the early 19th century, with their name recorded as \\"Sinnahamis\\" by John Work of the Hudson's Bay Company, among the first to also use the name to describe the river. The Snohomish were signatories of the Point Elliott Treaty in 1855, which relocated the tribe to the Tulalip Indian Reservation. In the early 1850s, the territorial government planned to construct a military road connecting Fort Steilacoom to Fort Bellingham, with a ferry crossing of the Snohomish River at Kwehtlamanish, a winter village of the Snohomish people. The road, proposed in the wake of the Pig War, was intended to be built far enough inland to be safe from British naval attacks. The confluence of the Snohomish and Pilchuck rivers, located near Kwehtlamanish, was sought by several American settlers from Steilacoom who arrived in 1859 to file homestead claims. Edson F. Cady and Heil Barnes, representing carpenter Emory C. Ferguson, settled near the proposed ferry landing, while Egbert H. Tucker filed a claim for a plot on the other side of the Snohomish River. The settlement was originally known as \\"Cadyville\\" and changed its name to Snohomish City in 1871. The name Snohomish comes from the name of the dominant local Native American tribe \\"sdoh-doh-hohbsh\\" (), whose meaning is widely disputed. Although the military road was never completed, Snohomish quickly became a center of commerce in the expanding region. In 1861, Snohomish County separated from Island County and the Village of Snohomish was voted the county seat. It remained so until 1897 when the county seat was relocated to the larger, yet much newer neighboring city of Everett, Washington after a controversial and contested county-wide vote. Snohomish's first school was organized in either 1867 or 1869. The Village of Snohomish was incorporated in 1888 and re-incorporated as a city in 1890 due to the transition from territory to state. Hyrcanus Blackman was elected mayor, having already been Police Chief for two years. 1893 saw the construction of a roller skating rink and 1894 the first graduations from Snohomish High School. By 1899 the city of Snohomish was a prosperous town with a population of 2,000, 25 businesses and 80 homes. steamboat Marguerite at Snohomish, Washington, sometime before May 24, 1907 1901 brought Snohomish the first motor car in the county. In 1903 First Street was paved with brick. When it was finished, there was a three-day celebration, and for years afterward, the city's residents remained so proud of the street that they washed it every week with a fire hose. Emma C. Patric was appointed the town's first librarian in 1901, an event that lead to the 1910 grand opening of the town's first public library, The Carnegie Library. It is now the oldest remaining public building in the city. In 1911 a disastrous fire struck First Street and everything between Avenues B and C was destroyed. The fire began when a small blaze in the Palace Cafe on the South side of the street got out of control on Memorial Day, 1911 at about four a.m. Thirty-five business structures were put out of business, with $173,000 worth of goods destroyed. Despite the disaster the town continued to grow and by 1920 the population grew to a little over 3,000. The population would remain relatively stable for the next 40 years. The city was connected to Everett by an interurban railway that ceased operations in 1921 after a trestle was damaged during a major flood. The Great Depression was not acutely felt in Snohomish because its economy was mostly agrarian with many family farms. One of the town's largest employers, Bickford Ford, was founded in 1934 by Lawrence Bickford; the dealership flourished in a period when many auto dealerships failed. The 1930s brought Snohomish national notice as the hometown of baseball great Earl Averill, the only Washingtonian in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Averill played from 1929 to 1941, mostly with the Cleveland Indians. The 1960s saw the city of Snohomish enter a period of decline. As the Boeing Company fell on hard times, many people were laid off and had to move away to seek other work. A commonly heard phrase was, \\"Will the last person out of Seattle please turn off the lights?\\" Snohomish fought back with a redevelopment plan in 1965 that proposed the destruction of the historic structures along First Street to make way for an enclosed mall. The plan was not carried out due to lack of funds, and the area remains today as it has through much of its history. The Alcazar Opera House, built in 1892, later became an agricultural supply store and is now one of Snohomish's many antiques stores. The town's economic malaise continued throughout much of the '70s, with the downtown area given over to mostly bars and small shops. In 1973 the city adopted a Historic District Ordinance protecting historic buildings and structures from inappropriate alterations and demolitions and encouraging the design of new construction in keeping with the district's historic character. In 1974, the Historic Business District, a 36-block area, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Larger stores moved away from First Street into newer developments and strip malls that spread out along Second Street and Avenue D. In 1974 the Seattle-Snohomish mill was gutted by fire and rebuilt by its owners. In 1975 a severe flood struck the area, damaging over 300 homes and killing 3,500 head of livestock, but the community rallied to support those who were affected. The 1980s saw renewed vigor in Snohomish when, along with other developments, two 7-Eleven convenience stores and a McDonald's franchise opened during the first part of the decade. Around 1985, the U.S. Route 2 bypass was completed, allowing traffic which had until then been forced to pass through the town to circumvent the city. In the 1990s, First Street was redeveloped to take advantage of its historic buildings as a tourist attraction. Its sidewalks were rebuilt and public restrooms added. The city hall and police station were moved away from First Street and a new fire station was built, allowing those historic buildings to be renovated as well. Today, Snohomish is a model of how cities can reinvigorate their business districts by preserving their historic charm. It has continued to grow, with much of its development spread out along the former Route 2, now known as Bickford Avenue. Snohomish has conscientiously maintained a balance between its regular businesses in modern facilities, serving the local community, and the specialty shops in the town's historic areas, serving visitors. Geography Snohomish is located along the north bank of the Snohomish River near where it is joined by the Pilchuck River. The city lies on the Getchell Hill Plateau, a low hill in the Snohomish River Valley that interrupts the wide, flat river valley. Some neighborhoods of the city are on a ridge that is west of the Pilchuck River, as well as Dutch Hill on the opposite bank. Blackmans Lake (formerly Stillaguamish Lake) is located north of downtown Snohomish and has a boat launch maintained by the city government. The river valley was formed approximately 14,000 years before present by the outflow of a glacial lake during the Vashon Glaciation event. The river itself floods during the winter season, occasionally breaching the dikes in Downtown Snohomish. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The historic business and residential center of the town constitutes the Snohomish Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Many houses bear plaques with the year the house was built and the name of the people who originally occupied it. Each year the city gives tours of the historic houses; one of them, the Blackman House, is a year-round museum.

The city is located north of Seattle, at the mouth of the Stillaguamish River near Camano Island. As of the 2010 census, its population is 6,231. Stanwood was founded in 1866 as Centerville, adopting its current name in 1877 after the arrival of postmaster Daniel O. Pearson. It was platted in 1889 and incorporated as a city in 1903. The city was bypassed by the Great Northern Railway, which built a depot east that grew into its own separate town, incorporated in 1922 as East Stanwood. The two Stanwoods were civic rivals for several decades, until their governments were consolidated after a 1960 referendum was approved by voters. The city was historically home to several food processing plants, which were its largest employers, and was mainly populated by Scandinavians. Since the 1990s, Stanwood has grown into a bedroom community for Seattle and Everett and has annexed uphill areas that were developed into suburban subdivisions. Stanwood is primarily served by State Route 532, which connects Camano Island to Interstate 5, and also has a train station that opened in 2009. History Looking west on 271st Street Northwest, formerly the main street of East Stanwood Prior to European exploration and settlement in the 19th century, the Puget Sound region was inhabited by indigenous Coast Salish peoples. The modern-day site of downtown Stanwood was home to a Stillaguamish village named , with an estimated 250 people and three large potlatch houses. The area's first European Americans, George O. and G. L. Wilson, were led on a guided canoe expedition up the Stillaguamish River in 1851 and reported of its economic potential. The first permanent American settlement at the mouth of the Stillaguamish River was Centerville, a trading post established in 1866 by Robert Fulton on the south side of the river. Centerville gained a post office in 1870, and the settlement was moved to the north side of the river three years later. The post office was renamed to Stanwood in 1877 by its sixth postmaster Daniel O. Pearson, after his wife Clara's maiden name; Pearson also ran a general store and built a new steamboat wharf on the Stillaguamish River shortly after arriving. The surrounding area was cleared by loggers and managed using a series of levees along the Stillaguamish River before being opened for settlement by farmers and ranchers. The establishment of a Norwegian Lutheran church in 1876, the first to be built in the Pacific Northwest, brought the area's first wave of Scandinavian immigrants. The townsite's plat was filed by Pearson and W. R. Stockbridge in 1889, ahead of a failed attempt to petition the county commission for incorporation as a city. Stanwood suffered from a major fire on June 2, 1892, which destroyed the church and thirteen buildings and caused damages of approximately $26,100 ( dollars); several businesses and the town's liquor supply were saved by volunteers from the town's Good Templars lodge, who had been at a regular meeting. By the end of the decade, the town had rebuilt its main street and gained a weekly newspaper, cannery, horse racing track, creamery, and a shingle mill. Stanwood was officially incorporated on October 19, 1903, a month after the town's men voted 74‚Äì16 in favor of becoming a city. Stanwood's businesses relocated a block away from the riverfront in the 1920s and 1930s after the main flow of the Stillaguamish River shifted to another slough. The change in the river rendered the wharf too shallow for steamboats and damaged dikes after several major floods. The Seattle and Montana Railroad (later absorbed into the Great Northern Railway) was constructed through the Stanwood area in 1891, but bypassed the town to the east, where it built a depot on ground that was less prone to flooding. Several businesses relocated to the area around the depot, including a bank and Washington state's first cooperative general store. Merchants in the old town boycotted the railroad and acquired a steamboat, the City of Stanwood, in 1893; the ship was lost after catching fire on Port Susan the following year. A short railroad, known as the Hall and Hall Railway, was constructed in 1904 between the depot and downtown Stanwood and would operate until 1938. The community around the depot was platted in 1906 as \\"East Stanwood\\", but initially relied on a commercial club to govern in lieu of a formal town government. East Stanwood was incorporated on February 7, 1922, after a series of civic disputes highlighted the need for a city government. East Stanwood was eventually bisected by the Pacific Highway in the 1920s and connected to Stanwood and Camano Island by paved roads constructed a decade earlier. The \\"Twin City\\" maintained separate government facilities, schools, banks, sawmills, creameries, and frozen food plants. The school systems for the two cities were merged in 1944, ending a decades-long football rivalry between the two high schools. By the early 1950s, the competitiveness between merchants and citizens of both Stanwoods had softened and groups cooperated on events and various initiatives. A formal merger of the two cities was proposed in 1954 and placed on the April 30 ballot; Stanwood voted in favor of the merger, but it failed to reach a majority in East Stanwood. The high cost of a modern sewage treatment system, required by the state government before further expansion could occur, spurred leaders in both cities to place a second consolidation referendum before voters on March 8, 1960. The referendum was passed by an overwhelming majority of voters in both cities and the merged government immediately approved a $520,000 sewer installation contract. Development of a new suburban commercial center east of the city began in the 1980s, centered around the relocated Stanwood High School campus. A farm at the intersection of State Route 532 and 72nd Avenue Northwest was redeveloped into a $50 million shopping and entertainment center. The commercial center opened in 1995 and has 50 businesses, 10 restaurants, office buildings, a movie theater, and an arcade. The development was later expanded to include multi-story condominiums and upscale apartments with ground-floor retail space. The area surrounding the center was developed into suburban subdivisions, contributing to a doubling of the city's population to nearly 4,000 people by 2000. The subdivisions were annexed by the city government in the early 2000s, despite testimony from citizens against further growth. In 2005, the city rejected a bid by Wal-Mart to build a store in Stanwood after public outcry from supporters of downtown businesses. Geography A section of the Stillaguamish River delta south of downtown Stanwood during a flood in 2015 According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Stanwood has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city is at the northwestern corner of Snohomish County, and is considered part of the Seattle metropolitan area. It is west of its nearest neighboring town, Arlington, and north of Everett, the county seat. The city is also north of Seattle and south of Mount Vernon. Stanwood's city limits are generally defined to the south by the Stillaguamish River; to the west by 104th Drive Northwest; to the north by 276th Street Northwest and 290th Street Northwest; and to the east by 68th Avenue Northwest. Approximately 59 percent of land within Stanwood city limits is used for housing, while 10 percent is zoned for commercial use and 7 percent for industrial uses. The urban growth area of Stanwood consists of an additional outside city limits, including the unincorporated area of Northwest Stanwood. The city is located at the mouth of the Stillaguamish River, where it flows into Port Susan, an arm of the Puget Sound, and Skagit Bay, the mouth of the Skagit River. To the west is Davis Slough, which separates Stanwood from Camano Island, and forms the border between Snohomish and Island counties. Elevations in Stanwood range from above sea level near the Stillaguamish River to in the northeastern hills. The city is home to five creeks and drainage basins that flow into the Stillaguamish River and Puget Sound: Church Creek, Douglas Creek, Irvine Slough, the Skagit River, and the Stillaguamish River. The Stanwood area was formed during the Pleistocene glaciation and was further shaped through the rise and fall of the sea level as well as sedimentary deposits from the Skagit and Stillaguamish rivers. Much of downtown Stanwood is located in a 100-year flood zone and is at risk of flooding from the Stillaguamish River, as well as the Skagit River. Much of the Stillaguamish delta was reclaimed using a series of levees and dikes that were built in the 1870s and improved by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s and the city government in the 1990s. Some of the failure-prone dikes were later removed in the 2010s to restore habitat areas for native wildlife. Several civic buildings have also been relocated uphill from the downtown area to prevent floods from hampering the city's vital functions. In 2020, the city government began construction of flood controls to redirect stormwater into the Stillaguamish River rather than the sloughs to prevent flooding. The project is expected to cost $11 million and take 10 years to complete over six phases. Economy , Stanwood has an estimated workforce population of 4,644 and an unemployment rate of 4.1 percent. The most common occupations for Stanwood residents are in the education and health care sector, which employs 24.1 percent, followed by manufacturing (17.5%), retail (13.3%), and entertainment and food services (11.2%). Only 14 percent of employed residents work within Stanwood city limits, while the rest commute to other cities for work. The most common commuting destinations for Stanwood residents include Everett, with 15 percent of traffic, Seattle (8.5%), Mount Vernon (5%), Arlington (4.6%), and Marysville (4.5%). The average one-way commute for the city's workers was approximately 27.5 minutes; 83.5 percent of commuters drove alone to their workplace, while 7.4 percent carpooled and 2.8 percent used public transit. The city's largest employers are the Stanwood- Camano School District and the Josephine Sunset Home, which provide approximately 550 and 303 jobs, respectively. One of the city's other large employers was the Twin City Foods frozen food processing plant, which packaged frozen vegetables and fruits until it ceased operations in 2017. The original plant was destroyed in an accidental fire on April 28, 1996, causing $50 million in damage and leaving 111 full-time workers unemployed until a new plant opened the following July. Demographics Stanwood is among the smallest cities in Snohomish County, with an estimated population of 7,287 people in 2019. By 2035, the city and its surrounding urban growth area is expected to have a population of 11,085. The greater Stanwood area, which includes Camano Island and other nearby communities, has a total population of 33,000 people. Stanwood was noted for its historically large Scandinavian population, particularly Norwegians, who settled in the region in the early 20th century. As late as 1949, over 60 percent of Stanwood residents were of Norwegian, Swedish, or Danish descent. By 2000, however, only 17.6 percent of residents identified themselves as having Scandinavian ancestry. 2010 census As of the 2010 U.S. census, there were 6,231 people, 2,388 households, and 1,541 families residing in the city.

Government and politics Stanwood's city hall, built in 1939 Stanwood is a non-charter code city that operates under a mayor‚Äìcouncil government. The city council's seven members and the mayor are elected to four-year terms in non- partisan elections. City councilmember Elizabeth Callaghan was appointed as mayor in July 2020, following the resignation of mayor Leonard Kelley due to health reasons. The council conducts regular meetings twice per month at the Stanwood-Camano School District administrative offices. The city hall was built in 1939 and renovated in the 1960s and 2013, but remains too small to host city council meetings. The city has long-term plans to relocate the city hall out of the downtown flood zone to a property near Church Creek Park. The city government employs 28 people full-time and operates on a biennial budget with annual expenses of $16.2 million. The budget funds various departments run by the government, including water utilities, parks and recreation, development planning, and clerks. Stanwood also outsources its policing services to the county sheriff's office and its fire and emergency services to the North County Regional Fire Authority. The sheriff's office provides several deputies and officers, while the vehicles and uniforms are marked with the city logo. At the federal level, Stanwood is part of Washington's 2nd congressional district, (Inset map) which has been represented by Democrat Rick Larsen since 2001. At the state level, the city is part of the 10th legislative district, which also includes all of Island County and part of southwestern Skagit County. The district is represented by three Republicans: senator Barbara Bailey and representatives Norma Smith and Dave Hayes. Stanwood is wholly part of the Snohomish County Council's 1st district, represented by Nate Nehring since his appointment in 2017. Culture=Arts and events Stanwood's arts community is centered around the Stanwood‚ÄìCamano Arts Guild, which organizes an annual spring art show and the Art by the Bay festival in the summer. The guild also programs public art at local businesses and public venues. Stanwood is also a center for glass artwork due to its proximity to the Pilchuck Glass School, founded in 1971 by a group of glassblowing artists led by Dale Chihuly. Stanwood also hosts several annual festivals and events that are organized by community groups and the city government. In February, the area hosts a glass treasure hunt and a birding festival to coincide with the migration of snow geese and other winter flocks. During the summer months, the city organizes weekend concerts at various venues around downtown and hosts a farmers' market on Fridays from June to October. Stanwood's two late summer festivals, the Community Fair and Harvest Jubilee, are focused around the region's agricultural tradition. The Community Fair, held since 1932 in early August and billed as the \\"Best Lil' Fair in the West\\", draws 12,000 visitors annually and features 4-H presentations, livestock exhibitions, a parade, and carnival rides.

In 2014, the city began development of new multi-million dollar parks at the former Hamilton lumber mill and Ovenell dairy farm, both located along the Stillaguamish River near downtown. The Hamilton site includes an iconic smokestack that is decorated during the holiday season and will be incorporated into the new park, which will include a boat launch and public dock. The Ovenell site was cleared of its historic barn in 2017 and will include a boat launch, natural habitats, and a demonstration farm when fully completed in the 2020s. Media The Stanwood Community Library, operated by the Sno-Isle Libraries system Stanwood has one weekly newspaper, the Stanwood Camano News, which originated in 1893 as the Stanwood Tidings and later ran under the name of the Twin City News. The newspaper was acquired by the Pioneer News Group, publishers of the Mount Vernon-based Skagit Valley Herald, in 2015. At the time, the News had a weekly circulation of 2,200. Stanwood's public library is operated by the countywide Sno-Isle Libraries system and is housed in a building. The city's first library was built in 1922 and replaced in 1970 with the modern building, which was expanded in 1986. Historic buildings The twin downtowns of Stanwood and East Stanwood have several blocks of historic buildings that date back to the early 20th century and were preserved by the city's residents. A portion of the eastern downtown was nearly destroyed in a two-alarm fire on August 27, 1997, which burned through three shops. Stanwood has two buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), which evaluates historic sites under private ownership. The D. O. Pearson House, was built in 1890 as the home of the founding Pearson family and was listed in 1973. It was acquired by the Stanwood Area Historical Society in 1975 and now serves as a pioneer museum. The city's other NRHP listing, the three-story Stanwood IOOF Public Hall, was built in 1903 for use by various fraternal organizations (including the International Order of Odd Fellows) until it was acquired by the historical society in 1996. The IOOF building was reopened in 2003 as the Floyd Norgaard Cultural Center and now serves as a museum, community center, and events venue.

It is located approximately east of Everett at the confluence of the Skykomish River and the Sultan River, a minor tributary. The city had a population of 4,651 at the 2010 census. The city was founded in 1880 at the site of a Skykomish village and initially settled during a small gold rush. Sultan was platted in 1889, just prior to the arrival of the Great Northern Railway, and was a hub for mining and the lumber industry. It was incorporated on June 28, 1905, with a population of 700. The city was home to a Civilian Conservation Corps camp during the Great Depression and undertook several civic improvements in the post-war years. Sultan has since become a bedroom community for large employment centers in the Puget Sound region. The city has several public parks, a historic museum, and is located near outdoor recreation areas in the Cascade Mountains. It is connected to nearby cities by U.S. Route 2. History The area around the Sultan and Skykomish rivers was occupied by the Skykomish, a branch of the Snohomish people, prior to the arrival of American settlers. The Skykomish had a permanent village at the confluence named , along with a nearby fishery named . Following the discovery of a rich gold vein along the Sultan River, the land around the confluence was claimed for a homestead by John Nailor and his wife in 1880. Among the first arrivals to the area were Chinese prospectors, who later settled the land but were evicted in 1885. Nailor built a small store and hotel to serve miners and loggers, eventually serving as the first postmaster after the settlement received a post office in 1885. The town and river were named \\"Sultan\\", an anglicization of (also known as Tseul-dan), then chief of the Skykomish tribe. Main Street in Sultan, 1913 The Nailors sold of their homestead to William B. Stevens in 1889, who filed the first plat for Sultan City that October. The Great Northern Railway placed a supply depot for its railroad workers in Sultan in 1891, meeting river steamboats and contributing to the town's early growth. Sultan gained its first sawmill in 1891 and a shingle mill in 1895, as the local economy transitioned away from mining and towards logging. Sultan was officially incorporated as a city on June 28, 1905. At the time, the city had a population of 700 people and three general stores, along with a variety of small industries. By 1912, the city had a public library, electrical service, paved streets, and was considering a plan to build a hydroelectric dam that would also provide municipal water service. A bridge across the Skykomish River was built in 1908 to connect to new farms on the south bank. An economic slowdown after World War I led to a population decrease in the Skykomish Valley, causing Sultan voters to approve a reduction in the city's size in June 1920. The area was home to various illicit industries during the Prohibition era and experienced several major crimes, including the murder of town marshal Percy Brewster on March 2, 1927, by a serial robber who later escaped from prison before being re-captured. The area also experienced an economic downturn during the Great Depression and was home to a Civilian Conservation Corps camp that primarily dealt with firefighting and forest management. The Works Progress Administration also completed several projects in the city, including two expansions of the high school and its gymnasium in 1929 and 1939. Several major fires struck Sultan in the 1940s, including one in October 1945 that destroyed a block of buildings on Main Street and another in 1947 that decimated the Sultan Union High School. Sultan residents participated a civic improvement program during the 1950s and 1960s that upgraded or replaced several major facilities, often with assistance from the state government. A new city hall was opened in 1954, the elementary school was expanded in 1957, and a new landing field for airplanes and helicopters opened in 1958. The city annexed of rural land to the southeast in 1958 and it was subsequently developed for housing. The Skykomish River Bridge was also replaced by a new span in 1961. The Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD) constructed the Culmback Dam on the Sultan River, creating the Spada Lake reservoir and providing electricity and drinking water for Everett and much of the county beginning in 1965. The Sky River Rock Festival and Lighter Than Air Fair, one of the first outdoor U.S. music festivals, was hosted at a raspberry farm south of Sultan beginning August 30, 1968. The three-day festival, organized by radio station KRAB and the Helix newspaper, attracted an estimated 20,000 hippies, of whom 13,000 had paid tickets, and was considered to be a forerunner for later festivals like Woodstock. Musical acts at the festival included Santana, the Grateful Dead, Country Joe McDonald, Muddy Waters, Buffy St. Marie, and John Fahey, among others. The Sultan city government declined to allow the festival to return the following year due to the traffic and logistical issues that were experienced, including the venue running out of drinking water. The event was largely forgotten by local residents, but was revived for a one-time festival in 2017. Aerial view of Sultan, showing suburban development from the 1990s and 2000s Sultan has since developed into a bedroom community for workers commuting to Everett, Seattle, and Bellevue. Several suburban subdivisions were built in the 1990s and early 2000s, contributing to a population boom and political strife over the area's rural and small-town character. The Department of Veteran Affairs considered the Sultan area for a new national military cemetery, but ultimately chose a site near Kent. Sultan celebrated its centennial in 2005 with several festivals and the dedication of a new visitor's center. Despite the population growth, the city's traditional businesses have left Sultan and caused a decline in local employment options. In an effort to resolve development issues and a city budget shortfall, a Monroe city councilmember unsuccessfully suggested merging the two cities during the 2007 financial crisis. The Sultan city government instead began outsourcing its policing and library services to county agencies while undergoing other reforms. The city government has endorsed schemes to lure new industries, including offering tracts of land and opening new parks and a shooting range in a bid to appeal to outdoor recreation companies.

The city funds various departments and services, including public sanitation, water and sewer systems, planning, and parks. Other services, including fire services and the library, are contracted out to regional agencies. The local police department was disbanded in 2008 and transitioned to services from the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office for public safety. Sultan's public library was established in 1927 by the Women's Improvement Club, but was later transferred to city control. It is currently operated by the countywide Sno-Isle Libraries system and located in the city hall building in downtown. The library was formerly operated by the city government, but was annexed into the Sno-Isle system in March 2008 due to a potential shutdown caused by the budget shortfall.

The Sky Valley Historical Society maintains a small local museum in the city's post office building in downtown Sultan. Infrastructure=Transportation The Sultan River bridge carrying U.S. Route 2 west of downtown Sultan Sultan is connected to nearby communities by U.S. Route 2 (US 2), which runs east‚Äìwest along the Skykomish and Snohomish rivers from Everett to Eastern Washington via Stevens Pass. The nearest cities on the highway are Monroe, to the west, and Gold Bar to the east. The highway carries daily average of approximately 18,000 vehicles through Sultan, with higher volumes during summer months and ski season. Due to its high rate of accidents, including more than 2,600 in the county in the early 2000s and 100 within Sultan city limits from 1999 to 2000, the highway is considered one of the most dangerous in the state. Sections of US 2 near Sultan were rebuilt to add safety features, including roundabouts, rumble strips, warning signage, and additional policing. The BNSF Railway's Scenic Subdivision also runs along U.S. Route 2, connecting Everett to Eastern Washington and also carrying Amtrak's Empire Builder train. The highway and railroad cross over the Sultan River on a pair of truss bridges, while a third is planned to be built for pedestrians and bicyclists. Public transit service along US 2 is operated by Community Transit and consists of two routes that travel from Everett Station to Snohomish, Monroe, Sultan, and Gold Bar. The city also has a small park and ride lot that is served by Community Transit. A private airfield, Sky Harbor Airport, is located near Sultan and is open to small aircraft. It has a single, unpaved runway.

The population was 3,652 at the 2010 census, up from 3,017 in 2000. History North of Spokane, the city of Deer Park was officially incorporated on June 24, 1908. Deer Park got its name when railroad surveyors saw deer grazing in the area. It was settled in 1889 when a railroad siding was built for the Spokane Falls & Northern Railway. Soon the Standard Lumber Company sawmill was established by William Short and George Crawford to provide the lumber needed to rebuild the nearby city of Spokane Falls (later renamed Spokane) following the great fire of 1889. By 1900 the population of Deer Park was approximately 300 residents. In addition to the sawmill, the community consisted of three general stores (owned separately by P. Kelly, Dan Weis, and A. Baldwin), a blacksmith and harness shop, a livery and feed stable, Jeff Moore's hotel, Dr. Prince's drug store, a public school with approximately 75 students, and a Congregational church led by Rev. F. McConaughy. By this time there were as many as eight sawmills within ten miles of Deer Park, all of which got their supplies in, and employed residents of, the town. Arcadia Apple Orchards Company was established around 1906, and orchards of apple trees were planted on the land surrounding Deer Park which had been cleared by the logging activity. The municipal airport east of the city was built during World War II and dedicated in August 1944 with three paved runways, all at in length. During the early 1960s, an Atlas missile site (567-1) near the airport was operated by the 567th Strategic Missile Squadron of Fairchild AFB. Soon obsolete, the site was decommissioned in 1965 and sold for salvage in 1967. Community events Deer Park has a number of annual events. Settlers Days takes place on the 4th weekend in July, Summer Concert Series in Mix Park Saturday nights through the summer; a citywide yard sale on the first weekend of August; Roundabout 5k in September, Winterfest in January and Pumpkin Lane is held the Saturday Before Halloween.

Entrance to Fairchild AFB in 2008 Fairchild Air Force Base (AFB) is a United States Air Force base, located approximately southwest of Spokane, Washington. The host unit at Fairchild is the 92d Air Refueling Wing (92 ARW) assigned to the Air Mobility Command's Eighteenth Air Force. The 92 ARW is responsible for providing air refueling, as well as passenger and cargo airlift and aero-medical evacuation missions supporting U.S. and coalition conventional operations as well as U.S. Strategic Command strategic deterrence missions. Fairchild AFB was established in 1942 as the Spokane Army Air Depot. and is named in honor of General Muir S. Fairchild a World War I aviator, he was the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force at the time of his death. As of 2018, the 92d Air Refueling Wing was commanded by Colonel Derek Salmi Its Command Chief Master Sergeant was Chief Master Sergeant Lee Mills. History General Muir S. Fairchild Fairchild AFB is named in honor of General Muir S. Fairchild (1894‚Äì1950). Born in Bellingham, he graduated from Olympia High School and attended the University of Washington in Seattle. Fairchild received his wings and commission in 1918, and served as a pilot during World War I. He held various air staff positions during World War II and received his fourth star in 1948, and died on 17 March 1950 while serving as USAF Vice Chief of Staff. Operational history Since 1942, Fairchild Air Force Base/Station has been a key part of the United States' defense strategy‚Äîfrom World War II repair depot, to Strategic Air Command bomber wing during the Cold War, to Air Mobility Command air refueling wing during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. Today, Fairchild's aircraft and personnel make up the backbone of the Air Force's tanker fleet on the west coast. Fairchild's location, west of Spokane, resulted from a competition with the cities of Seattle and Everett in western Washington. The War Department chose Spokane for several reasons: better weather conditions, the location from the coast, and the Cascades Mountain range providing a natural barrier against possible Japanese attack. As an added incentive to the War Department, many Spokane businesses and public-minded citizens donated money to purchase land for the base. At a cost of more than $125,000, these people bought and presented the title to the War Department in January 1942. That year, the government designated $14 million to purchase more land and begin construction of a new Spokane Army Air Depot. Spokane Air Depot was served by a rail connection to the Great Northern Railway.Staff, \\"Align Rail Route To Air Depot\\", The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Washington, Wednesday 13 May 1942, Volume 59. Number 364, page 6. From 1942 until 1946, the base served as a repair depot for damaged aircraft returning from the Pacific Theater. The depot command at the base went through several name changes, at one point being designated the Spokane Air Technical Service Command. Effective at 2359L on 31 August 1947, the base was transferred to the Strategic Air Command (SAC) and assigned to the 15th Air Force (15 AF). Beginning in the summer of 1947, the 92nd and 98th Bomb Groups arrived. Both of the units flew the most advanced bomber of the day, the B-29 Superfortress. In January 1948, the base received the second of its three official names: Spokane Air Force Base. With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, both groups deployed to Japan and Guam. The 92d departed on 4 July 1950 and the 98th followed in August. After only a few months, General MacArthur released the 92nd to return to the states while the 98th remained in the Far East. The 98th was then reassigned to Nebraska. Upon its return to Fairchild, the 92nd was re-designated the 92d Bombardment Wing (Heavy). In November 1950, the base took its current name in memory of Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, General Muir S. Fairchild, a native of Bellingham. The general entered service as a sergeant with the Washington National Guard in June 1916 and was an aviator in World War I. He died at his quarters at Fort Myer while on duty in the Pentagon in March 1950. The formal dedication ceremony was held 20 July 1951, to coincide with the arrival of the wing's first B-36 Peacemaker. B-52 Stratofortress and KC-135 Stratotanker In 1956, the wing began a conversion that brought the first of 45 B-52 Stratofortress bomber on 26 March 1957 to Fairchild, followed by first of twenty KC-135 Stratotanker on 21 February 1958. In 1961, the 92d became the first \\"aerospace\\" wing in the nation with the acquisition of the Atlas-E intercontinental ballistic missile, operated by the 567th Strategic Missile Squadron. With the new role and the addition of missiles, the 92d Bomb Wing was re-designated the 92d Strategic Aerospace Wing. However, the designation remained longer than the missiles, as the Atlas missiles were soon obsolete and removed in 1965. The weapons storage area (WSA) for the bombers was located south of the runway at Deep Creek Air Force Station, a separate installation constructed from 1950 to 1953 by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and operated by the Air Materiel Command. The facility was one of the thirteen original sites built for storage, maintenance, and operational readiness of the nuclear stockpile. Deep Creek became part of Fairchild AFB on 1 July 1962, with operations transferred to SAC. On 15 March 1966, the 336th Combat Crew Training Group was established at Fairchild. In 1971, the group became a wing and assumed control over all Air Force survival schools. Later reduced to a group level command, the unit, now known as the 336th Training Group, continues this mission for the Air Education and Training Command (AETC). To provide air defense of the base, U.S. Army Nike- Hercules surface-to-air missile sites were constructed during 1956/1957. Sites were located near Cheney (F-37) ; Deep Creek (F-87) ; Medical Lake (F-45) , and Spokane (F-07) . The Cheney site was active between 1957 ‚Äì June 1960; Deep Creek Sep 1958 ‚Äì March 1966; Medical Lake 1957 ‚Äì March 1966 and the Spokane site between 1957 and June 1960. In 1985, Fairchild's fifteen B-52G aircraft were replaced with nineteen B-52H; a slightly newer version with more powerful turbofan engines. Air refueling As military operations in Vietnam escalated in the mid-1960s, the demand for air refueling increased. Fairchild tanker crews became actively involved in Operation YOUNG TIGER, refueling combat aircraft in Southeast Asia. The wing's B-52s were not far behind, deploying to Andersen AFB on Guam for Operation Arc Light and the bombing campaign against enemy strongholds in Vietnam. On 10 September 1962, an inbound KC-135A from Ellsworth AFB in South Dakota with 44 aboard crashed into fog-shrouded Mount Kit Carson, just west of Mount Spokane. The incident occurred late in the morning and there were no survivors; it was attributed to a navigational error by the crew. Less than five years later, another crash occurred in the same general area. Returning from Hickam AFB in Hawaii on 19 January 1967, a Fairchild-based KC-135A crashed southeast of Mount Spokane shortly after sunset; all nine on board were killed. In late 1974, the Air Force announced plans to convert the 141st Fighter Interceptor Group of the Washington Air National Guard, an F-101 Voodoo unit at Geiger Field, to an air refueling mission with KC-135 aircraft. The unit would then be renamed the 141st Air Refueling Wing (141 ARW) and move to Fairchild. Work began soon thereafter and by 1976 eight KC-135E aircraft transferred to the new 141 ARW. Today, the 141 ARW continues its air mobility mission, flying the KC-135R model. On 23 January 1987, following the inactivation of the 47th Air Division at Fairchild, the 92nd Bombardment Wing was reassigned to the 57th Air Division at Minot AFB in North Dakota. Less than two months later on 13 March, a KC-135A crashed into a field adjacent to the 92nd Bomb Wing headquarters and the taxiway during a practice flight for a low-level in-flight refueling demonstration planned for later that month. Seven were killed in the crash, all USAF personnel, six aboard the aircraft, and a motorist on the ground. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, a total of 560 base personnel deployed to Desert Shield and Desert Storm from August 1990 to March 1991. The 43d and 92d Air Refueling Squadrons flew a combined total of 4,004 hours, 721 sorties, and off-loaded a total of 22.5 million pounds of fuel to coalition aircraft. On 1 September 1991, under Air Force reorganization, the 92d Bombardment Wing (Heavy) was re-designated the 92d Wing, emphasizing a dual bombing and refueling role. With the inactivation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) in June 1992, the B-52 portion of the wing became part of the newly-established Air Combat Command (ACC) and was re-designated the 92d Bomb Wing. As SAC finished 46 years of service to the nation, Fairchild bomber and tanker crews took top honors at Proud Shield '92, SAC's final bombing/navigation competition. The wing won the Fairchild Trophy for best bomber/tanker team as well as the Saunders Trophy for the tanker unit attaining the most points on all competition missions. 7 December 1993 marked the beginning of a significant change in the mission of Fairchild when the B-52s were transferred to another ACC base while the KC-135s, now assigned to the newly established Air Mobility Command (AMC) would remain. This was the first step in Fairchild's transition to an air refueling wing. The departure of B-52s continued throughout the spring of 1994, with most of the bombers gone by 25 May 1994. On 24 June 1994 one of the few remaining B-52H aircraft at Fairchild crashed during a practice flight for an upcoming air show, killing all four crew members. ‚Äì Contains video footage of the 1994 crash, and details on the hospital shootings. Air refueling wing On 1 July 1994, the 92d Bomb Wing was re-designated the 92d Air Refueling Wing (92 ARW), and Fairchild AFB was transferred from ACC to Air Mobility Command (AMC) in a ceremony marking the creation of the largest air refueling wing in the Air Force. Dubbed as the new \\"tanker hub of the Northwest,\\" the wing was capable of maintaining an air bridge across the nation and the world in support of US and allied forces. Since 1994, the 92 ARW has been involved in many contingency missions around the world. 92 ARW KC-135s have routinely supported special airlift missions in response to world events or international treaty compliance requirements. In 1995 aircraft from Fairchild flew to Travis AFB, California in support of its first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) mission, transporting Russian inspectors to sites in the Western U.S. The wing has flown START missions in the U.S. every year since. And in May 2000, the wing became the first active duty KC-135 unit to transport U.S. inspectors on a START mission into Ulan Ude, Russia. Throughout much of the 1990s, the wing was actively involved in missions against Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. The wing also deployed aircraft and personnel in 1999 to support Operation Allied Force. Following the destruction of the World Trade Center, the wing began providing around-the-clock air refueling of Combat Air Patrol fighter aircraft and initiated 24-hour ground alert operations in support of Operation Noble Eagle. The wing also began a series of extended Operation Enduring Freedom deployments for aircrews and maintainers as well as combat support and medical personnel. 1994 shooting On June 20, 1994, Dean Mellberg, an ex-Air Force member, entered the base hospital and shot and killed four people and wounded 22 others. Previously, psychologists Major Thomas Brigham and Captain Alan London at Fairchild AFB had found him unfit for duty, which resulted in a transfer to the Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland AFB for further psychological examination. With Congressional pressure brought by Mellberg's mother, Airman Mellberg was found to be fit for military service. Airman Mellberg then was reassigned to Cannon Air Force Base where similar events led to him being returned to psychologists for evaluation. After this evaluation, he was discharged from Cannon AFB as being unfit for military service; he had been diagnosed with mild autism, generalized anxiety disorder and paranoid personality disorder.https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1082552.html He traveled to Spokane, Washington, near Fairchild AFB, where he purchased a rifle and planned his attack on the base. At the time of the shooting, Fairchild's hospital was an ungated facility. The gunman, armed with a Chinese-made MAK-90, an AK-47 clone, entered the office of Brigham and London and killed both men. Mellberg continued to move through the hospital, injuring several people, and killing eight-year-old Christin McCarron. The gunman then walked out of the building into the parking lot and killed Anita Lindner. He then was confronted by a security policeman, Senior Airman Andy Brown. From approximately 70 yards away, Brown ordered Mellberg to drop his weapon. After Mellberg refused, Brown fired four shots from his 9mm pistol, with two rounds hitting the perpetrator in the head and shoulder, killing him. After an investigation it was concluded that Airman Brown was justified in his actions, probably having saved lives, and he was awarded the Airman's Medal by President Bill Clinton. In 2016, Brown published Warnings Unheeded: Twin Tragedies at Fairchild Air Force Base. The book reveals the pre-incident indicators of the shooting and the fatal crash of a B-52 bomber that occurred four days afterward.

Originally, the Air Force wanted three sites with three missiles at each (3 x 3); however, in early 1959, the Air Force opted to disperse the missiles to nine individual sites as a defensive safety measure. Work started at Site A on 12 May 1959, and completion at Site I occurred on 10 February 1961. Auxiliary support facilities for each site were built concurrent with the launchers. Support facilities at Fairchild AFB, including a liquid oxygen plant, were completed by January 1961. Atlas at Deer Park (567‚Äì1) in 1961 Activation of the 567th Strategic Missile Squadron on 1 April 1960, marked the first time SAC activated an E series Atlas unit. On 3 December 1960, the first Atlas E missile arrived at the 567th SMS. Construction continued and SAC accepted the first Series E Atlas complex on 29 July 1961. Operational readiness training, which previously had been conducted only at Vandenberg AFB, California, began at Fairchild during the following month. On 28 September 1961, Headquarters SAC declared the squadron operational and during the following month, the 567th placed the first Atlas E missile on alert status. The bulk of the Fairchild force was on alert status in November. As a result of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's May 1964 directive accelerating the phaseout of Atlas and Titan I ICBMs, the first Atlas missiles came off line at Fairchild in January 1965. On 31 March, the last missile came off alert status, which marked the completion of Atlas phaseout. The squadron was inactivated within 3 months. Today all of the former missile sites still exist and most appear to be in good condition. Most of them are in agricultural areas and presumably are being used to support farmers by storage of equipment and other material. Site \\"1\\" and \\"2\\" appear to be redeveloped into light industrial estates; \\"4\\" and \\"6\\" appear to be converted into private residences. Role and operations Fairchild is home to a wide variety of units and missions. Most prominent is its air refueling mission, with two wings, one active, the 92d Air Refueling Wing, and one national guard, the 141st Air Refueling Wing, both flying the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker. The 92nd Air Refueling Wing comprises the 92d Operations Group which provides air mobility for America through air refueling, airlift, and operational support, the 92d Maintenance Group which provides maintenance support to world-class aircraft and equipment, the 92d Mission Support Group which provides the foundation for support and morale of Fairchild and the 92d Medical Group. Other units here include the Air Force Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape school, medical detachments, a weapons squadron and the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency. Over 5,200 active duty Air Force, Air National Guard, and tenant organization military and civilian employees work on Fairchild, making the base the largest employer in Eastern Washington. Fairchild's annual economic impact on the Spokane community is approximately $427 million, constituting 13 percent of the local economy.

The population was 183 at the 2010 census. It was named for the nearby creek, Latah Creek, from the native word for fish. The town was formerly called, Hangman's Creek and Alpha. History Latah Valley saw its first wave of settlers about 1872, which included Richard and Lydia Wimpy family, Hosea and Harriette Harvey family, and Henry and Julia Coplan family. In those days, the settlement took the name of the nearby stream, Hangman's Creek. The stream received its name from the tragic events of 1858, when Col. George Wright hanged several members of the local native tribes in retaliation for the defeat of Lt. Col. Edward J. Steptoe at the Battle of Pine Creek. The exact jurisdiction seems to have been of question in the beginning, as the first postmaster of \\"Hangman's Creek\\" was Richard H Wimpy, appointed 19 Mar 1873, in Nez Perce County, Idaho. The post office was transferred to Stevens County, Washington Territory, on 5 May 1873, with R. H. Wimpy still the postmaster. That section of Stevens County became Whitman County, and finally Spokane County. Meanwhile, Hangman's Creek changed to \\"Alpha\\" in 25 Apr 1881, under postmaster Emery H.

This small farming community gained some fame a few years after the settlers arrived. The eldest sons of Henry Coplan/Copeland had arrived in 1872, followed by the rest of the family in 1873. In May 1876, the Coplan brothers were poking around in a boggy piece of land near the creek when they discovered mammoth fossils, along with a collection of other animal fossils, and evidence of prehistoric human activity. The news attracted visitors and scientist to the area, and inspired another set of brothers, William and Thomas Donahoe, to poke around their property on Pine Creek. The Donahoe brothers found a gargantuan mammoth skull, and other fossils. After extracting a sizable collection, the Coplan brothers, Ben, Alonzo, and Lewis, took their prizes on tour through Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. The Donahoe brothers sent theirs on tour to California. After passing through various other hands, the Donahoe collection was acquired by the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where it still resides. The Coplan collection eventually came into the possession of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago where it remains.

At the 2010 census, the population was 5,060. The city is the site of a psychiatric hospital, Eastern State Hospital, and of Fairchild Air Force Base, two major employers. History The city of Medical Lake was incorporated in 1890. The city took its name from the nearby eponymous lake. The Spokane people, a Native American tribe which had long inhabited the area, believed the water and mud of the lake to possess curative properties. White settlers such as Andrew Lefevre and Stanley Hallett, who moved to the area in the 1870s, promoted this belief and marketed the lake salts for medicinal uses. A salt and soap industry developed here, followed by the construction of commercial bath houses in the 1880s. This was a period when springs and spas were popular developments across the country. Several resort hotels were constructed along the lake shore. In 1891, the state constructed Eastern State Hospital, and this further stimulated economic growth in the city. Such growth continued until the 1920s, when the lake declined in popularity as a tourist destination. A period of stagnation was interrupted in the 1940s with the construction of nearby Fairchild Air Force Base to support the US effort in World War II. This brought a surge of population to the city. Medical Lake's economy continues to depend upon the institutional presence of Eastern State Hospital and Fairchild AFB. Many residents of the city commute to work in nearby Spokane, which has a more varied economy. Geography Medical Lake is located at (47.571384, -117.683333). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The city lies to the east of the lake of the same name. There are many other lakes within a few miles of the city, including West Medical Lake, Silver Lake, Clear Lake, and numerous smaller lakes and ponds south of the city. Driving distance from downtown Spokane is 16 miles via Interstate 90 and Washington State Route 902, the latter of which runs through the city. Eastern State Hospital is situated across the lake to the west. Fairchild Air Force Base is located immediately north of the city. Geologically, the city lies on basalt flows that were heavily eroded by catastrophic flooding at the end of the last Ice Age, making the city and its environs a part of the Channeled Scablands terrain.

In the town the age distribution of the population shows 25.4% under the age of 18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 26.7% from 25 to 44, 24.2% from 45 to 64, and 15.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 112.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 110.6 males. The median income for a household in the town was $38,393, and the median income for a family was $40,556. Males had a median income of $31,071 versus $26,250 for females. The per capita income for the town was $17,128. About 10.3% of families and 18.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.3% of those under the age of eighteen and none of those 65 or over. Education Spangle is also notable as the home of Upper Columbia Academy and Liberty High School. Upper Columbia Academy, a boarding high school affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, is approximately 2 miles southeast of Spangle. 5.5 miles East of Upper Columbia Academy is Liberty High School, a rural school serving the communities of Spangle, Plaza, Fairfield, Mount Hope, Latah, and Waverly. It is a \\"B\\" school that has a total of around 450 students (K-12).Liberty High School http://www.liberty.wednet.edu/libertydistrict/site/default.asp References Category:Cities in Spokane County, Washington Category:Cities in Washington (state) ","title":"Spangle, Washington"},{"id":"138268","text":"Spokane ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Spokane County, Washington, United States. It is in eastern Washington along the Spokane River adjacent to the Selkirk Mountains and west of the Rocky Mountain foothills, south of the Canada‚ÄìU.S. border, west of the Washington‚ÄìIdaho border, and east of Seattle along Interstate 90. Spokane is the economic and cultural center of the Spokane metropolitan area, the Spokane‚ÄìCoeur d'Alene combined statistical area, and the Inland Northwest. It is known as the birthplace of Father's Day, and its official nickname is the \\"Lilac City\\". A pink double flower cultivar of the common lilac, known as Syringa vulgaris 'Spokane', is named for the city. The city and the wider Inland Northwest area are served by Spokane International Airport, west of downtown Spokane. According to the 2010 Census, Spokane had a population of 208,916, making it the second-largest city in Washington, and the 100th-largest city in the United States. In 2019, the United States Census Bureau estimated the city's population at 222,081 and the population of the Spokane Metropolitan Area at 573,493. The first people to live in the area, the Spokane tribe (their name meaning \\"children of the sun\\" in Salishan), lived off plentiful game. David Thompson explored the area with the westward expansion and establishment of the North West Company's Spokane House in 1810. This trading post was the first long-term European settlement in Washington. Completion of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1881 brought settlers to the Spokane area. The same year it was officially incorporated as a city under the name of Spokane Falls (it was reincorporated under its current name ten years later). In the late 19th century, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Northwest. The local economy depended on mining, timber, and agriculture until the 1980s. Spokane hosted the first environmentally themed World's Fair at Expo '74. Many of the downtown area's older Romanesque Revival-style buildings were designed by architect Kirtland Kelsey Cutter after the Great Fire of 1889. The city is also home to the Riverfront and Manito parks, the Smithsonian-affiliated Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture, the Davenport Hotel, and the Fox and Bing Crosby theaters. The Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Spokane, and the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist serves as that of the Episcopal Diocese of Spokane. The Spokane Washington Temple in the east of the county serves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Gonzaga University was established in 1887 by the Jesuits, and the private Presbyterian Whitworth University was founded three years later and moved to north Spokane in 1914.Whitworth College Annual 1914, History of Whitworth College, DONALD D. McKAY, President, page 8. http://cdm16004.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15238coll1/id/464 In sports, the region's professional and semi-professional sports teams include the Spokane Indians in Minor League Baseball and Spokane Chiefs in junior ice hockey. The Gonzaga Bulldogs collegiate basketball team competes at the Division I level. As of 2010, Spokane's major daily newspaper, The Spokesman-Review, had a daily circulation of over 76,000. History Spokane Falls in 1888 The first humans to live in the Spokane area were hunter- gatherers that lived off plentiful fish and game; early human remains have been dated to 8,000 to 13,000 years ago. The Spokane tribe, after which the city is named (the name meaning \\"children of the sun\\" or \\"sun people\\" in Salishan),Phillips (1971), pp. 134‚Äì135 are believed to be either their direct descendants, or descendants of people from the Great Plains. When asked by early white explorers, the Spokanes said their ancestors came from \\"up North.\\" Early in the 19th century, the Northwest Fur Company sent two white fur trappers west of the Rocky Mountains to search for fur. These were the first white men met by the Spokanes, who believed they were sacred, and set the trappers up in the Colville River valley for the winter. Trading post The explorer-geographer David Thompson, working as head of the North West Company's Columbia Department, became the first European to explore the Inland Empire (now called the Inland Northwest). Crossing what is now the Canada‚ÄìUS border from British Columbia, Thompson wanted to expand the North West Company further south in search of furs. After establishing the Kullyspell House and Saleesh House trading posts in what are now Idaho and Montana, Thompson then attempted to expand further west. He sent out two trappers, Jacques Raphael Finlay and Finan McDonald, to construct a fur trading post on the Spokane River, which flows west from Lake Coeur d'Alene to the Columbia River, and trade with the local Indians. This post was established in 1810, at the confluence of the Little Spokane and Spokane rivers, becoming the first enduring European settlement of significance in what later became Washington state. Known as the Spokane House, or simply \\"Spokane\\", it was in operation from 1810 to 1826. Operations were run by the British North West Company and later the Hudson's Bay Company, and the post was the headquarters of the fur trade between the Rocky and Cascade mountains for 16 years. After the latter business absorbed the North West Company in 1821, the major operations at the Spokane House were eventually shifted north to Fort Colville, reducing the post's significance.Meinig (1993), p. 69 In 1836, Reverend Samuel Parker visited the area and reported that around 800 Native Americans were living in Spokane Falls.Ruby (1988), p. 75 A medical mission was established by Marcus and Narcissa Whitman to cater for Cayuse Indians and hikers of the Oregon Trail at Walla Walla in the south. After the Whitmans were killed by Indians in 1847, Reverend Cushing Eells established Whitman College in their memory, also setting up the first church in the Spokane area. In 1853, two years after the establishment of the Washington Territory, the first governor, Isaac Stevens, made an initial effort to make a treaty with Chief Garry and the Spokanes at Antoine Plantes' Ferry, not far from Millwood. After the last campaign of the Yakima Indian War, the Coeur d'Alene War of 1858 was brought to a close by the actions of Col. George Wright, who won decisive victories against a confederation of tribes in engagements at the battles of Four Lakes and Spokane Plains. The cessation of hostilities opened the inter-mountain valley of the Pacific Northwest to safe habitation by settlers. American settlement Spokane ca. 1895 Joint American‚ÄìBritish occupation of Oregon Country, in effect since the Treaty of 1818, eventually led to the Oregon Boundary Dispute after a large influx of American settlers along the Oregon Trail. Great Britain ceded its claims to lands in Puget Sound and the central and lower Columbia Basin by the Oregon Treaty of 1846 The Hudson's Bay Company wound up its operations in the area over the next few years. The first American settlers in what is now Spokane were J.J. Downing and S.R. Scranton, cattle ranchers who squatted and established a claim at Spokane Falls in 1871. Together they built a small sawmill on a claim near the south bank of the falls. James N. Glover and Jasper Matheney, Oregonians passing through the region in 1873, recognized the value of the Spokane River and its falls for the purpose of water power. They realized the investment potential and bought the claims of and the sawmill from Downing and Scranton for a total of $4,000.Schmeltzer (1988), p. 39 Glover and Matheney knew that the Northern Pacific Railroad Company had received a government charter to build a main line across this northern route. Amid many delays in construction and uncertainty over the completion of the railroad and its exact course, Matheney sold his interest in the claim to Glover. Glover confidently held on to his claim and became a successful Spokane business owner and the city's second mayor.Durham (1912), p. 362‚Äì363 He later came to be known as the \\"Father of Spokane\\".Schmeltzer (1988), p. 40 In 1880, Fort Spokane was established by U.S. Army troops under Lt. Col. Henry Clay Merriam northwest of Spokane, at the junction of the Columbia and Spokane Rivers, to protect the construction of the Northern Pacific Railway and secure a place for U.S. settlement. By June 30, 1881, the railway reached the city, bringing major European settlement to the area. The city was officially incorporated with a population of about 1,000 residents on November 29, 1881.Durham (1912), p. 362 When Spokane was officially incorporated in 1881, Robert W. Forrest was elected as the first mayor of the city, with a Council of seven, S.G. Havermale, A.M. Cannon, Dr. L.H. Whitehouse, L.W. Rima, F.R. Moore, George A. Davis, and W.C. Gray, all serving without pay. The marketing campaigns of transportation companies with affordable fertile land to sell along their trade routes lured many settlers into the region they dubbed \\"Spokane Country\\". The makeshift Daily Chronicle office after The Great Fire The 1883 discovery of gold, silver, and lead in the Coeur d'Alene region of northern Idaho lured prospectors. The Inland Empire erupted with numerous mining rushes from 1883 to 1892.Kensel (1969), pp. 88‚Äì89 Mining and smelting emerged as a major stimulus to Spokane. At the onset of the initial 1883 gold rush in the nearby Coeur d'Alene mining district, Spokane became popular with prospectors, offering low prices on everything \\"from a horse to a frying pan\\".Kensel (1969), p. 85. According to the Spokane Falls Review December 1, 1883 edition. It would keep this status for subsequent rushes in the region due to its trade center status and accessibility to railroad infrastructure.Kensel (1969), pp. 85‚Äì89 Spokane's growth continued unabated until August 4, 1889, when a fire, now known as The Great Fire (not to be confused with the Great Fire of 1910, which happened nearby), began just after 6:00 p.m., and destroyed the city's downtown commercial district. Due to technical problems with a pump station, there was no water pressure in the city when the fire started.Schmeltzer (1988), pp. 42‚Äì43 In a desperate bid to starve the fire, firefighters began razing buildings with dynamite. Eventually the winds and the fire died down; 32 blocks of Spokane's downtown core had been destroyed and one person killed. Spokane Falls, 1890 Despite this catastrophe, and in part because of it, Spokane experienced a building boom. The downtown was rebuilt, and the city was reincorporated under the present name of \\"Spokane\\" in 1891. According to historian David H. Stratton, \\"From the late 1890s to about 1912, a great flurry of construction created a modern urban profile of office buildings, banks, department stores, hotels and other commercial institutions\\" which stretched from the Spokane River to the site of the Northern Pacific railroad tracks below the South Hill.Creighton (2013), p. 7 Yet the rebuilding and development of the city was far from smooth: between 1889 and 1896 alone, all six bridges over the Spokane River were destroyed by floods before their completion. In the 1890s the city was subject to intrastate migration by African-Americans from Roslyn, looking for work after the closure of the area's mines. Two African-American churches, Calvary Baptist and Bethel African Methodist Episcopal, were founded in 1890.Williamson (2010), p. 7 Just three years after the fire, in 1892, James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway arrived in the chosen site for Hill's rail yards, the newly created township of Hillyard (annexed by Spokane in 1924). Spokane became an important rail shipping and transportation hub for the Inland Empire, connecting mines in the Silver Valley with agricultural areas around the Palouse region.Schmeltzer (1988), p. 41 The city's population ballooned to 19,922 in 1890, and to 36,848 in 1900 with the arrival of additional railroads.Schmeltzer (1988), p. 44 By 1910 the population had hit 104,000, and Spokane eclipsed Walla Walla as the commercial center of the Inland Empire.Stratton (2005), pp. 29‚Äì30, 32‚Äì33 In time the city came to be known as the \\"capital\\" of the Inland Empire and the heart of a vast tributary region.Malone (1996), p. 201 After the arrival of the Northern Pacific, Union Pacific, Great Northern, and Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific railroads, Spokane became one of the most important rail centers in the western U.S. Early 20th century Monroe Street Bridge, 1911 Expansion abruptly stopped in the 1910s and was followed by a period of population decline, due in large part to Spokane's slowing economy. Control of regional mines and resources became increasingly dominated by national corporations rather than local people and organizations, diverting capital outside of Spokane and decreasing growth and investment opportunities in the city. During this time of stagnation, unrest was prevalent among the area's unemployed, who became victimized by \\"job sharks\\", who charged a fee for signing up workers in the logging camps. Job sharks and employment agencies were known to cheat itinerant workers, sometimes paying bribes to periodically fire entire work crews, thus generating repetitive fees for themselves. Crime spiked in the 1890s and 1900s,Kienholz (1999), p. 209‚Äì210 with eruptions of violent activity involving unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), or \\"Wobblies\\" as they were often known, whose free speech fights had begun to garner national attention. Now, with grievances concerning the unethical practices of the employment agencies, they initiated a free speech fight in September 1908 by purposely breaking a city ordinance on soapboxing. With IWW encouragement, union members from many western states came to Spokane to take part in what had become a publicity stunt. Many Wobblies were incarcerated, including feminist labor leader Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who published her account in the local Industrial Worker. The Masonic Temple built in 1905 After mining declined at the turn of the 20th century, agriculture and logging became the primary influences in the Spokane economy.Kensel (1968), p. 25 The population explosion and the building of homes, railroads, and mines in northern Idaho and southern British Columbia fueled the logging industry. Although overshadowed in importance by the vast timbered areas on the coastal regions west of the Cascades, and burdened with monopolistic rail freight rates and stiff competition, Spokane became a noted leader in the manufacture of doors, window sashes, blinds, and other planing mill products.Kensel (1968), pp. 28‚Äì29, 31 Rail freight rates were much higher in Spokane than the rates in coastal seaport cities such as Seattle and Portland, so much so that Minneapolis merchants could ship goods first to Seattle and then back to Spokane for less than shipping directly to Spokane, even though the rail line ran through Spokane on the way to the coast.Durham (1912), p. 598 The Inland Northwest region has also long been associated with farming, especially wheat production. Initially, the Palouse was thought to unsuitable for wheat production due to the hilly terrain, believing wheat could not be cultivated on the tops of the hills, but the region showed great promise for wheat production when it began in the late 1850s in part due to the hilltops. The Palouse was and still is a breadbasket and was able to develop and grow with the completion of several railroad networks as well as a highway system that began to center around the city of Spokane, aiding farmers from around the region in distributing their products to market. Inland Empire farmers exported wheat, livestock and other agricultural products to ports such as New York, Liverpool and Tokyo. Local morale was affected for years by the collapse of the Division Street Bridge early in the morning on December 15, 1915, which killed five people and injured over 20, but a new bridge was built (eventually replaced in 1994).Creighton (2013), p. 82 The 1920 census showed a net increase of just 35 individuals, which actually indicates that thousands left the city when considering the natural growth rate of a population. Growth in the 1920s and 1930s remained slow but less drastically so, forcing city boosters to market the city as a quiet, comfortable place suitable for raising a family rather than a dynamic community full of opportunity. The Inland Empire was heavily dependent on natural resources and extractive goods produced from mines, forests, and farms, which experienced a fall in demand. The situation improved slightly with the start of World War II as aluminum production commenced in Spokane due to the area's cheap electricity (produced from regional dams) and the increased demand for airplanes. Second half of the 20th century Expo '74 Washington State Pavilion in Riverfront Park After decades of stagnation and slow growth, Spokane businessmen formed Spokane Unlimited in the early 1960s, an organization that sought to revitalize downtown Spokane.Stratton (2005), pp. 211‚Äì212 A recreation park showcasing the Spokane Falls was the preferred option, and after successful negotiation to relocate the railroad facilities on Havermale Island,Stratton (2005), p. 215 they executed on a proposal to host the first environmentally themed World's Fair in Expo '74 on May 4, becoming the smallest city at the time to host a World's Fair.Stratton (2005), p. 207 This event transformed Spokane's downtown, removing a century of railroad infrastructure and re- inventing the urban core. After Expo '74, the fairgrounds became the Riverfront Park. The growth witnessed in the late 1970s and early 1980s was interrupted by another U.S. recession in 1981, in which silver, timber, and farm prices dropped.Schmeltzer (1988), p. 87 The period of decline for the city lasted into the 1990s and was also marked by a loss of many steady family-wage jobs in the manufacturing sector. At this time, market forces began to impact the local Kaiser Aluminum plant and layoffs, pension cuts, a 1998-1999 labor strike, and eventually bankruptcy in 2002 followed. Although this was a tough period, Spokane's economy had started to benefit from some measure of economic diversification; growing companies such as Key Tronic and other research, marketing, and assembly plants for technology companies helped lessen Spokane's dependence on natural resources. 21st century Spokane has an extensive Skywalk network As of 2014, Spokane is still trying to make the transition to a more service-oriented economy in the face of a less prominent manufacturing sector. Developing the city's strength in the medical and health sciences fields has seen some success, resulting in the expansion of the University District with two medical school branches. The city faces challenges such as a scarcity of high-paying jobs, pockets of poverty, and areas of high crime. The opening of the River Park Square Mall in 1999 served as a catalyst and sparked a downtown rebirth that included the building of the Spokane Arena and expansion of the Spokane Convention Center.Spirou (2010), p. 210 Other major projects include the building of the Big Easy concert house (now the Knitting Factory) and renovation of the historic Montvale Hotel, the Kirtland Cutter-designed Davenport Hotel (after being vacant for over 20 years), the Fox Theater (now home to the Spokane Symphony) as well as the completion of the WSU Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences Building in 2013 and the Davenport Grand Hotel in 2015, Ridpath Hotel in 2018 and the ongoing renovation of Riverfront Park (as of May 2019). The Kendall Yards development on the west side of downtown Spokane is one of the largest construction projects in the city's history. Directly across the Spokane River from downtown, it will blend residential and retail space with plazas and walking trails. Geography=Topography Spokane at night from the west, with Krell Hill silhouetted by radio antennas Spokane is located on the Spokane River in eastern Washington at an elevation of above sea level, about from Idaho, south of the Canada‚ÄìUS border, due east of Seattle, and southwest of Calgary. The lowest elevation in the city of Spokane is the northernmost point of the Spokane River within city limits (in Riverside State Park) at ; the highest elevation is on the northeast side, near the community of Hillyard (though closer to Beacon Hill and the North Hill Reservoir) at . Spokane is part of the Inland Northwest region, consisting of eastern Washington, north Idaho, northwestern Montana, and northeastern Oregon. The city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The Upper Spokane Falls of the Spokane River flowing by Canada Island Spokane lies in the Northern Rockies ecoregion near the eastern edge of the basaltic Channeled Scablands steppe, a plain that eventually rises sharply to the east towards the rugged, timbered Selkirk Mountains. The foothills of the Rockies‚Äîthe Coeur d'Alene Mountains‚Äîrise about to the east in north Idaho. The city is in a transition area between the barren landscape of the Columbia Basin and the coniferous forests to the east; to the south are the lush prairies and rolling hills of the Palouse. The highest peak in Spokane County is Mount Spokane, at an elevation of , on the eastern side of the Selkirk Mountains. The Spokane River is the area's most prominent water feature, a tributary of the Columbia River, originating from Lake Coeur d'Alene in northern Idaho.Soltero et al. (1992), p. 460 The river flows west across the Washington state line through downtown Spokane, meeting Latah Creek, then turns to the northwest, where it is joined by the Little Spokane River on its way to the Columbia River, north of Davenport. The Channeled Scablands and many of the area's numerous large lakes, such as Lake Coeur d'Alene and Lake Pend Oreille, were formed by the Missoula Floods after the ice-dammed Glacial Lake Missoula ruptured at the end of the last ice age. The Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge south of Cheney is the closest natural reserve, the closest National Forest is the Colville National Forest, the closest National Recreation Area is the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area and the closest national park is Mount Rainier National Park, approximately a four-and-a-half hour drive from Spokane. Flora and fauna California Quail on fence Spokane is within the Northern/Canadian Rockies ecoregion, which supports an abundance of wildlife in part because of its varied geology and natural history. The area contains a wide range of vegetation, from densely wooded coniferous forests to rolling grassy hills and meadows. Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir are common in the drier and lower elevation areas throughout the region. The ponderosa pine is the official tree of the City of Spokane, which is where specimens were first collected by botanist David Douglas in 1826. The Canadian Rockies ecoregion supports 70 mammals, 16 reptiles and amphibians, 168 birds, and 41 fish species. There is a high concentration of raptors in the area, bald eagles are a common sight near Lake Coeur d'Alene in December and January when kokanee spawn. The most common fish present in area lakes is the Washington-native rainbow trout, which is the official fish of Washington state. Big game common in eastern Washington include black and grizzly bears, caribou, Rocky Mountain elk, bighorn sheep, and cougar. Whitetail deer, mule deer, and moose are also found in abundance. The gray wolf population has been making a recovery in the Inland Northwest. As of June 2016, there are 16 wolf packs in eastern Washington. In August 2016, photo evidence confirmed a solitary wolf in Mount Spokane State Park. Although the ecoregion remains ecologically intact, it faces conservation challenges that include the negative effects of certain forestry management and logging practices, higher risks of forest fires due to the alteration of the trees that make up the forest composition, and habitat fragmentation as a result of urban sprawl and development, which endangers the long-term survival of vulnerable species such as mountain caribou and the Northern goshawk. The Lincoln statue on a clear day Climate Spokane has a dry summer continental climate (Dsb under the K√∂ppen classification), (direct: Final Revised Paper) a rare climate due to its elevation and significant winter precipitation; Spokane, however, is adjacent to and sometimes even classified as a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb) because the average temperature for the coldest month is just over . The area typically has a hot, arid climate during the summer months, bracketed by short spring and fall seasons. On average, July and August are equally warm, and the coolest month is December; July averages , while December averages . Daily temperature ranges are large during the summer, often exceeding , and small during the winter, with a range just above . The record high and low are and , but temperatures of more than or less than are rare. Temperatures above occur an average of 19 days annually, temperatures above occur an average of only 1 day annually, and those below average 3.5 days a year. Spokane's location, between the Cascades Range to the west and the Rocky Mountains to the east and north, protects it from weather patterns experienced in other parts of the Pacific Northwest. The Cascade Mountains form a barrier to the eastward flow of moist and relatively mild air from the Pacific Ocean in winter and cool air in summer. As a result of the rain shadow effect of the Cascades, the Spokane area has average annual precipitation, less than half of Seattle's . Most precipitation occurs in December, and summer is the driest time of the year. The Rockies shield Spokane from some of the winter season's coldest air masses traveling southward across Canada. Government and politics Spokane City Hall The City of Spokane operates under a mayor‚Äìcouncil form of government, with executive and legislative branches that are elected in non-partisan elections. David Condon was elected mayor in November 2011 and took office on the last business day of the year. The previous mayor was Mary Verner, who succeeded Dennis P. Hession who himself succeeded the recalled James \\"Jim\\" West. The city elected James Everett Chase as its first African-American mayor in 1981, and after his retirement, elected the city's first woman mayor, Vicki McNeil.Schmeltzer (1988), p. 71 Spokane is the county seat of Spokane County, a position it wrested from Cheney in 1886. Federally, Spokane is within Washington's 5th congressional district, and has been represented in the House of Representatives by Republican Cathy McMorris Rodgers since 2004. Washington State is represented nationally in the Senate by Democrat Patty Murray and Democrat Maria Cantwell. In the 2012 general election, Spokane County favored Mitt Romney for president over Barack Obama by 51.5 to 45.7 percent; on the state ballot, the county supported the legalization of recreational marijuana ballot measure by 52.2 to 47.9 percent and favored the legalization of same- sex marriage by 55.9 to 44.1 percent. Spokane native Tom Foley was a Democratic Speaker of the House and served as a representative of Washington's 5th district for 30 years, enjoying large support from Spokane, until his narrow defeat in the \\"Republican Revolution\\" of 1994,Stratton (2005), pp. 7‚Äì8 the only time U.S. voters have turned out a sitting Speaker of the House since 1860.Stratton (2005), p. 8 Crime The crime rate per 1,000 people in the Spokane metropolitan area (Spokane County) was 64.8 in 2012, higher than the Washington state average of 38.3; the violent crime rate of 3.8 and property crime rate of 61 also exceed the statewide averages of 2.5 and 35.8, respectively. NeighborhoodScout describes Spokane as \\"Safer than 1% of U.S. Cities\\". Spokane County Courthouse Half of all property crimes are localized in about 6.5 percent of the city. Spokane had the fourth-highest rate of auto theft in the U.S. in 2010 and 2011, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Drive-by shootings and drug use, particularly crack cocaine use, became worse in the early 1990s, and four drive-by shootings were recorded in December 1993 alone. In the 1990s, the Spokane Police Department (SPD) established a special gang unit, with an officer \\"collecting intelligence on gang activity and disseminating it to street officers\\".Kienholz (1999), p.188 The 1990s also saw Spokane's most prolific serial killer, Robert Lee Yates, who killed thirteen prostitutes in Spokane's East Sprague red light district and confessed to two others in Tacoma, Washington.Fox et al. (2014), pp. 144‚Äì145 The transition of the Spokane Police Department to a community- policing precinct model has helped curb crime rates since its introduction downtown, and has been expanded citywide. The crime woes are possibly due in part to an imbalance that Spokane County prisons receive of pre-release and work-release prisoners; An investigation by the Tacoma News Tribune found that while Spokane County accounts for 6.21 percent of the inmates in state prisons, it receives a disproportionate 16.73 percent of the inmate population to be released into the general population. Spokane and the Spokane Police Department have received national publicity and scrutiny in the 2000s and 2010s due to many officer-involved shootings and allegations of excessive force. The most high-profile of these incidents was the 2006 death of Otto Zehm, a mentally challenged man who was initially suspected of theft at a convenience store. Zehm was later found to have committed no crime, but was struck with batons by several officers and tasered. The increased pressure on the SPD prompted an independent review by a commission of the organization's use-of-force policies, an internal culture audit, and the purchase of body cameras. Demographics According to the American Community Survey, the median income for a household in Spokane in 2012 was $42,274, and the median income for a family was $50,268. Males had a median income of $42,693 and females had a median income of $34,795. The per capita income for the city was $24,034. About 13.3% of families and 18.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 23.8% of those under the age of 18 and 10.8% of those aged 65 and older. At the 2010 census, there were 208,916 people, 87,271 households, and 49,204 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 94,291 housing units at an average density of . The racial make-up of the city was 86.7% White, 5.0% Hispanics and Latinos, 2.6% Asian, 2.3% African American, 2.0% Native American, 0.6% Pacific Islander, and 1.3% from other races. There were 87,271 households, of which 28.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.5% were married couples living together, 12.9% had a female householder with no husband present, 5.0% had a male householder with no wife present, and 43.6% were non-families. In 2010, 34.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.97. The median age in the city was 35 years. In Spokane, 22.4% of residents were under the age of 18, 12.3% were between the ages of 18 and 24, 27.6% were from 25 to 44, 25.1% were from 45 to 64, and 12.8% were 65 years of age or older. The gender make-up of the city was 48.8% male and 51.2% female. Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist According to the Association of Religion Data Archives' 2010 Metro Area Membership Report, the denominational affiliations of the Spokane MSA are 64,277 Evangelical Protestant, 682 Black Protestant, 24,826 Mainline Protestant, 754 Orthodox, 66,202 Catholic, 31,674 Other, and 339,338 Unclaimed. As of 2016, there are also at least three Jewish congregations.(\\"almost 200 member families\\") The Emanu-El congregation erected the first synagogue in Spokane and the state of Washington on September 14, 1892. The city's first mosque opened in 2009 as the Spokane Islamic Center. Spokane, like Washington and the Pacific Northwest region as a whole, is part of the Unchurched Belt, a region characterized by low church membership rates and religious participation. The city serves as the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Spokane, which was established in 1913, and the Episcopal Diocese of Spokane, established in 1929. The Spokane Washington Temple, established in 1999, serves Latter-day Saints from the east of the county. Spokane has hosted an annual multicultural celebration, Unity in the Community, since 1995. The city has become more diverse in recent decades. People from countries in the former Soviet Union (especially Russians and Ukrainians) form a comparatively large demographic in Spokane and Spokane County, the result of a large influx of immigrants and their families after the collapse of the USSR in 1991. According to the 2000 Census, the number of people of Russian or Ukrainian ancestry in Spokane County was reported to be 7,700 (4,900 residing in the city of Spokane), amounting to two percent of the county. Among the fastest- growing demographics in Spokane is the Pacific Islander ethnic group, which is estimated to be the third-largest minority group in the county, after the Russian and Ukrainian community and Latinos. Spokane was once home to a sizable Asian community, mostly Japanese, centered in a district called Chinatown from the early days of the city until 1974. As in many western railway towns, the Asian community started off as an encampment for migrant laborers working on the railroads. The Chinatown Asian community thrived until the 1940s, after which its population decreased and became integrated and dispersed, losing its Asian character; urban blight and the preparations leading up to Expo '74 led to Chinatown's eventual demolition. Demographic map of the Spokane metro area Spokane and its metro area in general, particularly northern Idaho has been stigmatized in the popular consciousness by a number of hate groups that have been set up in and around Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, in the past. Low ethnic diversity made the region a destination for some seeking to escape more cosmopolitan cities for a locale with a relatively homogenous, white population. This trend increased with the arrival of retired engineer Richard Butler from California who traveled to Hayden, Idaho, in 1974 to eventually establish a white supremacist church called the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, better known by its political arm, the Aryan Nations. Aryan Nations recruits and associates were responsible for several hate crimes and terror plots during the mid 1980s and 1990s. The group went defunct in 2000 when the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a civil suit which resulted in a $6.3 million settlement, which led to the eventual bankruptcy and closure of their Hayden compound. Another significant act of hate was the attempted bombing of Spokane's Martin Luther King Day Parade by Kevin Harpham of Addy, Washington in 2011. The Southern Poverty Law Center currently lists three hate groups in the Spokane and Coeur d'Alene metro areas, in the categories of anti-Muslim, Holocaust denial, and general hate. Metropolitan area The Spokane metropolitan area consists of Spokane County. As of the 2018 census estimates, the Spokane metropolitan area had a population of 573,493. Directly east of Spokane County is the Coeur d'Alene Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Kootenai County, Idaho, anchored by the city of Coeur d'Alene. The urban areas of the two MSAs largely follow the path of Interstate 90 between Spokane and Coeur d'Alene. The Spokane area has suffered from suburbanization and urban sprawl in past decades, despite Washington's use of urban growth boundaries; the city ranks low among major Northwest cities in population density and smart growth according to the Sightline Institute, however Smart Growth America in a 2014 study ranked the census defined MSA as the 22nd most compact and connected in the nation using their Sprawl Index factors: development density, land use mix, activity centering, and street accessibility.https://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/app/legacy/documents/measuring- sprawl-2014.pdf The Spokane and Coeur d'Alene Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) are now included in a single Combined Statistical Area (CSA) by the Office of Management and Budget. The Spokane‚ÄìCoeur d'Alene CSA had around 721,873 residents in 2017. Cityscape=Neighborhoods The Garland Theater in the Garland District Spokane's neighborhoods range from the Victorian-style South Hill and Browne's Addition, to the Davenport District of Downtown, to the more contemporary neighborhoods of north Spokane. Spokane's neighborhoods are gaining attention for their history, as illustrated by the city being home to 18 recognized National Register Historical Districts. Some of Spokane's best-known neighborhoods are Riverside, Browne's Addition, and Hillyard. The Riverside neighborhood consists primarily of downtown Spokane and is the central business district of Spokane. The neighborhoods south of downtown Spokane are collectively known as the South Hill. Downtown Spokane contains many of the city's public facilities, including City Hall, Riverfront Park (site of Expo '74), and the Spokane Convention Center and First Interstate Center for the Arts, as well as the Spokane Arena and Spokane County Courthouse across the river in the historic West Central neighborhood. The Monroe Street Bridge, a city icon, connects the two areas. To the east of downtown is East Central and the adjacent University District and budding \\"International District\\". To the west of downtown is one of Spokane's oldest and densest neighborhoods, Browne's Addition. A National Historic District west of Downtown, Browne's Addition was Spokane's first prestigious address, notable for its array of old mansions built by Spokane's early elite in the Queen Anne and early American Craftsman styles.Stratton (2005), pp. 168‚Äì169 The area houses the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture. In northeast Spokane, the Hillyard neighborhood began in 1892 as the chosen site for James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway yard, placed outside Spokane city limits to avoid \\"burdensome taxes\\". The downtown Hillyard Business District, located on Market Street, was the first Spokane neighborhood listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Many of the former town's houses were built to house railroad workers, mainly immigrant laborers working in the local yard, who gave Hillyard an independent, blue-collar character. Hillyard has become a home for much of Spokane's growing Russian, Ukrainian, and Southeast Asian communities. ArchitectureCommercial and public buildings= The Romanesque Revival-style Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes Spokane neighborhoods contain a patchwork of architectural styles that give them a distinct identity and illustrate the changes throughout the city's history. Most of Spokane's notable buildings and landmarks are in the Riverside neighborhood and the downtown commercial district, where many of the buildings were rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1889 in the Romanesque Revival style. Examples include the Great Northern clock tower, Review Building, Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes, First Congregational Church, Washington Water Power Post Street substation, Peyton Building, and The Carlyle. The principal architect of many buildings of this period was Kirtland Kelsey Cutter. Self-taught, he came to Spokane in 1886, and began by designing \\"Chalet Hohenstein\\" for himself and other residences for his family, while also working as a bank teller. Other structures designed by Cutter include the Spokane Club, Washington Water Power Substation, Monroe Street Bridge (featured in the city seal), Central Steam Plant, and the Davenport Hotel. Built in renaissance and Spanish Revival style, the Davenport Hotel cost two million dollars to complete, and included new technologies at the time of its opening in September 1914, such as chilled water, elevators, and air cooling. In contemporary times, one of the city's foremost and influential architects has been Warren C. Heylman, who helped give the city a great breadth of mid- century architecture. Heylman's career was most prolific during the 1960s and 1970s where his main body of work was done in the modernist style, designing numerous residential houses, apartment buildings, and architectural embellishments. Some of his most noteworthy works in Spokane include The Parkade, Spokane International Airport, Spokane Regional Health Building, and the Burlington Northern Latah Creek Bridge over Hangman Valley. alt=Kirtland Cutter's Renaissance Revival-style Davenport Hotel, widely considered his The Renaissance Revival-style Davenport Hotel designed by Kirtland Cutter Other well-represented architectural styles downtown include Art Deco (Spokane City Hall, Paulsen Center, Fox Theater, City Ramp Garage), Renaissance Revival (Steam Plant Square, Thomas S. Foley Courthouse, San Marco), Neoclassical (Masonic Center, Hutton Building, Bing Crosby Theater), Chicago School (U.S. Bank Building, Liberty Building, Old City Hall) and Modernist (The Parkade, Ridpath Hotel, Bank of America Financial Center). The tallest building in the city, at , is the Bank of America Financial Center. Also of note is the Spokane County Courthouse in West Central (the building on the seal of Spokane County), the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Rockwood, the Benewah Milk Bottles in Riverside and Garland, Mount Saint Michael in Hillyard, and the Cambern Dutch Shop Windmill in South Perry. =Residential= Patsy Clark Mansion in Browne's Addition As an early affluent Spokane neighborhood, the Browne's Addition neighborhood and residences contain the largest variety of residential architecture in the city. These residences are lavish and personalized, featuring many architecture styles that were popular and trendy in the Pacific Northwest from the late 19th century to 1930, such as the Victorian and Queen Anne styles. In high demand following his firms' design of the Idaho Building at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, Cutter found work constructing many mansions for mining and railroad tycoons such as Patrick \\"Patsy\\" Clark and Daniel C. Corbin and son Austin.Stratton (2005), pp. 167‚Äì173 The older neighborhoods of the early 20th century, such as West Central, East Central, Logan, Hillyard, and much of the lower South Hill, feature a large concentration of American Craftsman style bungalows. In Hillyard, the most architecturally intact neighborhood in Spokane, 85 percent of these buildings are historic. As the city expanded mainly to the north in the middle of the 20th century, the bungalows in the \\"minimal traditional\\" style commonplace from the 1930s to the 1950s tend to predominate in the Northwest, North Hill, and Bemiss neighborhoods. This architectural style occupies the neighborhoods where the integrity of Spokane's street grid pattern is largely intact (especially the areas north of downtown and south of Francis Ave.), and the houses have backyard alleys for carports, deliveries, and refuse collection. Contemporary suburbs and architecture are prevalent at the north and south edges of Spokane as well as in the new Kendall Yards neighborhood north of downtown. Parks and recreation Duncan Garden at Manito Park In 1907, Spokane's board of park commissioners retained the services of the Olmsted Brothers to draw up a plan for Spokane's parks. Much of Spokane's park land was acquired by the city prior to World War I, establishing it early on as a leader among Western cities in the development of a citywide park system.Schmeltzer (1988), pp. 64‚Äì65 Spokane has a system of over 87 parks totaling and includes six neighborhood aquatic centers. Some of the most notable parks in Spokane's system are Riverfront Park, Manito Park and Botanical Gardens, Riverside State Park, Mount Spokane State Park, Saint Michael's Mission State Park, Plantes Ferry Recreation Park, John A. Finch Arboretum, and the Dishman Hills Conservation Area. Riverfront Park, created after Expo '74 and occupying the same site, is in downtown Spokane and the site of some of Spokane's largest events. The park has views of the Spokane Falls and holds a number of civic attractions, including a skyride, a rebuilt gondola lift that carries visitors across the falls from high above the river gorge. The park also includes the historic hand-carved Riverfront Park Looff carousel created in 1909 by Charles I. D. Looff. Riverfront Park is currently being renovated and modernized (as of October 2016). Manito Park and Botanical Gardens on Spokane's South Hill features the Duncan Gardens, a classical European Renaissance-style garden and the Nishinomiya Japanese Garden designed by Nagao Sakurai. Riverside State Park, close to downtown, is a site for outdoor activities such as hiking, mountain biking, and horse riding.Landers (2003), pp.90‚Äì95 The Spokane area has many trails and rail trails, the most notable of which is the Spokane River Centennial Trail, which features over of paved trails running along the Spokane River from Spokane to the Idaho border.Mueller (2004), pp. 270‚Äì274 This trail continues on towards Coeur d'Alene for as the North Idaho Centennial Trail and is often used for alternative transportation and recreational use. In the summer, it has long been popular to visit North Idaho's \\"Lake Country\\", such as Lake Coeur d'Alene, Lake Pend Oreille, Priest Lake, or one of the other nearby bodies of water and beaches. In the winter, the public has access to five ski resorts within a couple hours of the city. The closest of these is the Mt. Spokane Ski and Snowboard Park, which has trails for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and dog sledding. Zoological parks in Spokane include Cat Tales Zoological Park, a wildlife sanctuary primarily for big cats and the Blue Zoo an interactive aquarium in the NorthTown Mall.https://www.cattales.org/about- cat- tales.htmlhttps://spokane.bluezoo.us/?_ga=2.252440650.2111171074.1592280774-2035672830.1592280774 Economy The Spokane Stock Exchange once occupied the Peyton Building Spokane became an important rail and shipping center because of its location between mining and farming areas. In the early 1880s, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Empire; as a regional shipping center, the city furnished supplies to the miners who passed through on their way to the mineral-rich Coeur d'Alene, Colville and Kootenay districts. The mining districts are still considered among the most productive in North America. Natural resources have historically been the foundation of Spokane's economy, with the mining, logging, and agriculture industries providing much of the region's economic activity. After mining declined at the turn of the 20th century, agriculture and logging replaced mining as the primary influences in the economy. Lumberjacks and millmen working in the hundreds of mills along the railroads, rivers, and lakes of northern Washington and Idaho were provisioning themselves in Spokane.Kensel (1968) p. 31 Agriculture has always been an important sector in the local economy. The surrounding area, especially to the south is the Palouse, a region that has long been associated with farming, especially wheat production where it is one of the largest wheat producing regions in the United States. As with the mining industry in the late 1880s, Spokane was an important agricultural market and trade center. Inland Empire farmers exported wheat, livestock and other agricultural products to the ports such as New York, Liverpool and Tokyo. Today, a large share of the wheat produced in the region is shipped to Far East markets.Stratton (2005), p. 128 The Inland Northwest also supports many vineyards and microbreweries as well.Kensel (1969), p. 91Schmeltzer (1988), p. 93 By the early 20th century Spokane was primarily a commercial center rather than an industrial center.Kensel (1969), pp. 96‚Äì97 The Old National Bank Building In Spokane, wood and food processing, printing and publishing, primary metal refining and fabrication, electrical and computer equipment, and transportation equipment are leaders in the manufacturing sector. Gold mining company Gold Reserve, and Fortune 1000 company Potlatch Corporation ‚Äì a forest products company that operates as a real estate investment trust ‚Äì are headquartered in the city proper. Mining, forestry, and agribusiness remain important to the local and regional economy, but Spokane's economy has diversified to include other industries, including the high-tech and biotech sectors. Spokane is becoming a more service-oriented economy in the face of a less prominent manufacturing sector which declined in the 1980s, particularly as a medical and biotechnology center; Fortune 1000 technology company Itron, for instance, is headquartered in the area. Avista Corporation, the holding company of Avista Utilities, is the only company in Spokane that has been listed in the Fortune 500, ranked 299 on the list in 2002. Other companies with head offices in the Spokane area include technology company Key Tronic, vacation rental provider Stay Alfred, and microcar maker Commuter Cars. Despite diversification to new industries, Spokane's economy has struggled in recent decades. Spokane was ranked the #1 \\"Worst City For Jobs\\" in America in both 2012 and 2015, while also ranking #4 in 2014. Additionally, Forbes named Spokane the \\"Scam Capital of America\\" in 2009 due to widespread business fraud. Trends of fraud were noted as far back as 1988, again in 2002, and continuing through 2011. As of 2013, the top five employers in Spokane are the State of Washington, Spokane Public Schools, Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and Children's Hospital, the 92d Air Refueling Wing, and Spokane County. The largest military facility and employer, the 92d Air Refueling Wing, is stationed at Fairchild Air Force Base near Airway Heights. The leading industries in Spokane for the employed population 16 years and older were educational services, health care, and social assistance (26.5 percent), retail trade (12.7 percent), and arts, entertainment, recreation, and accommodation food services (10.4 percent). As the metropolitan center of the Inland Northwest, as well as parts of southern British Columbia and Alberta, Spokane serves as a commercial, manufacturing, transportation, medical, shopping, and entertainment hub. In 2017, the Spokane‚ÄìSpokane Valley MSA had a gross metropolitan product of $25.5 billion while the Coeur d'Alene metropolitan area was $5.93 billion. As of 2014, economic development in the Spokane area primarily focuses on promoting the following industries: manufacturing (especially aerospace manufacturing), health sciences, professional services, information science and technology, finance and insurance as well as clean technology, and digital media. To aid economic development, the eastern branch of Innovate Washington, a state-supported business incubator was placed in the city. Culture The Fox Theater Arts and theater Spokane's main art districts are located in the Davenport Arts District, the Garland Business District, and East Sprague. The First Friday Artwalk, which occurs the first Friday of every month, is dedicated to local vendors and performers displaying art around downtown. The two most important Artwalk dates (the first Friday of February and October) attract large crowds to the art districts. The Davenport Arts District has the largest concentration of art galleries and is home to many of Spokane's main performing arts venues, including the Knitting Factory, Fox Theater, and Bing Crosby Theater. The Knitting Factory is a concert house that serves as a setting for many mainstream touring musicians and acts. The Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox, restored to its original 1931 Art Deco state after years of being derelict, is home to the Spokane Symphony Orchestra. The Metropolitan Performing Arts Center was restored in 1988 and renamed the Bing Crosby Theater in 2006 to honor the former Spokanite. Touring stand-up comedians are hosted by the Spokane Comedy Club. Theater is provided by Spokane's only resident professional company, The Modern Theater, though there are also the Spokane Civic Theatre and several other amateur community theaters and smaller groups. The First Interstate Center for the Arts is often host to large traveling exhibitions, shows, and tours. Spokane was awarded the All-America City Award by the National Civic League in 1974, 2004, and 2015. Spokane offers an array of musical performances catering to a variety of interests. Spokane's local music scene, however, is considered somewhat lacking by the Spokane All-Ages Music Initiative and other critics, who have identified a need for a legitimate all-ages venue for music performances. The Spokane Symphony presents a full season of classical music, and the Spokane Jazz Orchestra, a full season of jazz music. The Spokane Jazz Orchestra, formed in 1962, is a 70-piece orchestra and non-profit organization. Museums Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture There are several museums in the city, most notably the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture, located a few blocks from the center of downtown in Browne's Addition, amid the mansions of Spokane's late 19th-century \\"Age of Elegance\\". A Smithsonian affiliate museum, it houses a large collection of Native American artifacts as well as regional and national traveling art exhibits. The Mobius Science Center and the related Mobius Kid's Museum in downtown Spokane seek to generate interest in science, technology, engineering, and math among the youth in a hands-on experience. The Jundt Art Museum at Gonzaga University features of exhibition space and contains sizable collections of prints from the Bolker, Baruch, Jacobs, and Corita Kent collections.Ware (2004), p. 339 The museum houses glass art by Dale Chihuly, bronze sculptures by Auguste Rodin, tapestries, paintings, ceramics, photographs, and a wide range of gifts, including from the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Foundation and Collections. On the campus of Gonzaga University, the Crosby House, Bing Crosby's childhood home, houses the Bing Crosby Memorabilia Room, the world's largest Crosby collection with around 200 pieces.Bao et al. (2014), p.461 A museum of flight showcasing historic airplanes and curated by the Historic Flight Foundation is located at Felts Field.https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/oct/09/businessman-and-aviation- enthusiast-opening-flying/ Events and activities Spokane is known as the birthplace of the national movement started by Sonora Smart Dodd that led to the proposal and eventual establishment of Father's Day as a national holiday in the U.S.Schmidt (1995), pp. 275‚Äì276 The first observation of Father's Day in Spokane was on June 19, 1910. Sonora conceived the idea in Spokane's Central Methodist Episcopal Church, while listening to a Mother's Day sermon.Schmidt (1995), p. 276 Lilac Bloomsday Run The Lilac Bloomsday Run, held in the spring on the first Sunday of May, is a race for competitive runners as well as walkers that attracts international competition. Also in May is the Lilac Festival which honors the military, celebrates youth, and showcases the region. Spokane's nickname, the \\"Lilac City\\", refers to a flowering shrub that has flourished since its introduction to the area in the early 20th century. In June the city hosts Spokane Hoopfest, a 3-on-3 basketball tournament, among the largest of its kind. One of Spokane's most popular local events is Pig Out in the Park, an annual six-day food and entertainment festival where attendees may eat a variety of foods and listen to free live music concerts featuring local, regional, and national recording artists in Riverfront Park. The Spokane International Film Festival, held every February, is a small, juried festival that features documentaries and shorts from around the world. The Spokane Gay & Lesbian Film Festival, held every November, features contemporary, independent films of interest to the GLBT community. Other notable events in the Spokane region include the Spokane County Interstate Fair, Japan Week, Spokane Pride Parade and the Lilac City Comicon. The Spokane County Interstate Fair is held annually in September at the Spokane County Fair and Expo Center in Spokane Valley. Japan Week is held in April and celebrates the sister-city relationship with Nishinomiya, Hyogo, demonstrating the many commonalities shared between the two cities. Students from the Spokane campus of Mukogawa Fort Wright Institute, Gonzaga, Whitworth, and other area schools organize an array of Japanese cultural events. The gay and lesbian Spokane Pride Parade is held each June. There is an annual Renaissance fair and Civil War reenactment as well. Education St. Aloysius Church at Gonzaga University The WSU Health Sciences Spokane campus, located in the University District Serving the general educational needs of the local population are two public library districts, the Spokane Public Library (within city limits) and the Spokane County Library District. Founded in 1904 with funding from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, the Spokane Public Library system comprises a downtown library overlooking the Spokane Falls and five branch libraries. Special collections focus on Inland Pacific Northwest history and include reference books, periodicals, maps, photographs, and other archival materials and government documents. Spokane Public Schools (District 81) was organized in 1889, and is the largest public school system in Spokane, and the second-largest in the state, as of 2014, serving roughly 30,000 students in six high schools, six middle schools, and thirty-four elementary schools. Other public school districts in the Spokane area include the Mead School District in north Spokane County, outside city limits. A variety of state-approved, independent charter schools and private and parochial elementary and secondary schools augment the public school system. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Spokane manages ten such schools in & around the area. Spokane is home to many higher education institutions. They include the private universities Gonzaga and Whitworth, and the public Community Colleges of Spokane system (Spokane Community College and Spokane Falls Community College) as well as a variety of technical institutes. Gonzaga University and Law School were founded by the Italian-born priest Joseph Cataldo and the Jesuits in 1887. Whitworth was founded in Tacoma, Washington in 1890 and moved to its present location in 1914. It is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church and had 2,500 students studying in 53 different undergraduate and degree programs as of 2011. While Spokane is one of the larger cities in the U.S. to lack a main campus of a state-supported university within its city limits, Eastern Washington University (EWU) and Washington State University (WSU) have operations at the Riverpoint Campus in the University District, just adjacent to downtown and across the Spokane River from the Gonzaga campus. Washington State University Spokane is WSU's health sciences campus and houses the school's College of Nursing, College of Pharmacy, and Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine. The main EWU campus is located southwest of Spokane in nearby Cheney, and WSU is located to the south in Pullman. In addition to WSU's health science presence in Spokane, there is also a four-year medical school branch affiliated with the University of Washington's WWAMI program. An international branch campus of the Mukogawa Women's University, the Mukogawa Fort Wright Institute, is located in Spokane. Sports The Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena Spokane is close to dozens of lakes and rivers for outdoor sports and recreation. People use these for swimming, boating, kayaking, rafting, and fishing. Nearby mountains provide for skiing, hiking, biking and sightseeing. The Spokane region's professional and semi-professional sports teams include the Spokane Shock in indoor football, Spokane Indians in Minor League Baseball, and Spokane Chiefs in junior ice hockey. Collegiate sports in Spokane focus on the local teams such as the Gonzaga Bulldogs who compete in the NCAA's Division I West Coast Conference and the Whitworth Pirates playing in the Division III Northwest Conference and local media covers other regional teams, including the Eastern Washington Eagles, Washington State Cougars, and the Idaho Vandals. The Spokane Indians located in the suburb Spokane Valley, are a Class-A-Short-Season baseball team in the Northwest League (NWL) and have been a farm team of the Texas Rangers since 2003. The Indians play their home games at the 6,803-seat Avista Stadium and have won seven NWL titles since their Short-Season-A debut in 1982. Prior to 1982, the Indians played at the Triple-A level. The team achieved considerable success in the early 1970s, winning the Pacific Coast League championship in 1970, and having a 94‚Äì52 record. In the 1920s and 1930s the Spokane City League, a semiprofessional baseball league of teams of the Inland Empire, reached its peak.Popejoy (2010), p.127 The Spokane Chiefs are a junior ice hockey team that play in the Canadian Hockey League's Western Hockey League. They play their home games in the Spokane Arena and have a regional rivalry with the Tri-City Americans. They have won the CHL's top prize, the Memorial Cup, two times in club history, first in 1991 and again in 2008. The Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena is the city's premier sports venue. In the years since the Spokane Arena opened, it has played host to several major sporting events. The first major event was the 1998 Memorial Cup, the championship game of the Canadian Hockey League. Four years later in 2002, the city hosted the 2002 Skate America figure skating competition and then the 2007 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in the Spokane Arena. The latter event set an attendance record, selling nearly 155,000 tickets. Spokane later hosted the 2010 U.S. Figure Skating Championships ‚Äì ending eighteen days before the start of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia and then the 2016 Team Challenge Cup. Infrastructure=TransportationCity streets= Street layout of Spokane city center Spokane's streets use a grid plan that is oriented to the four cardinal directions; generally, the east‚Äìwest roads are designated as avenues, and the north‚Äìsouth roads are referred to as streets. Major east‚Äìwest thoroughfares in the city include Francis, Wellesley, Mission, Sprague, and 29th Avenues. Major north‚Äìsouth thoroughfares include Maple‚ÄìAsh, Monroe, Division, Hamilton, Greene‚ÄìMarket (north of I-90), and Ray‚ÄìFreya (south of I-90) Streets. Division Street divides the city into East and West, while Sprague Avenue splits the city into North and South. Division Street is Spokane's major retail corridor; Sprague Avenue serves the same purpose in Spokane Valley. With over 40,000 vehicles per day in average daily traffic from Interstate 90 north to the US 2‚ÄìUS 395 junction, North Division is Spokane's busiest corridor. Spokane's extensive skywalk system covers thirteen blocks in the downtown area and is among the largest in the United States; it is used for pedestrian travel in cold and inclement weather and retail space as well.Young et al. (1999), p. 328 Despite this, the city has an average Walk Score of 49 as of 2020, indicating that most errands require a car. Its average Bike Score is 52. =Mass transportation= The STA Plaza in Downtown Spokane Before the influx of automobiles, Spokane's electric streetcar and interurban lines played a dominant role in moving people and goods around Spokane. Streetcars were installed as early as 1888, when they were pulled by horses.Creighton (2013), p.64 Many older side streets in Spokane still have visible streetcar rails embedded in them. Streetcar service was reduced due to declining ridership beginning in 1922, and by August 1936, all lines had been abandoned or converted to motor buses. Mass transportation throughout the Spokane area is provided by the Spokane Transit Authority (STA), which operates a fleet of 156 buses. Its service area covers roughly and reaches 85 percent of the county's population. A large percentage of STA bus routes originate from the central hub, the STA Plaza in downtown Spokane. Spokane has a Transit Score of 35.4 on Walk Score. Spokane has rail and bus service provided by Amtrak and Greyhound via the Spokane Intermodal Center. The city is a stop for Amtrak's Empire Builder on its way to and from Chicago's Union Station en route to Seattle and Portland. Amtrak's through service to Seattle and Portland is a legacy of BNSF Railway's old Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway trackage. Spokane is a major railway junction for the BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad and is the western terminus for the Montana Rail Link. =Freeways and highways= Overlooking Spokane from Sunset Hill Interstate 90 (I-90) runs east‚Äìwest from Seattle, through downtown Spokane, and eastward through Spokane Valley, Liberty Lake, and onward to Coeur d'Alene and then Missoula. Although they are not limited access highways like I-90, US 2 and US 395 enter Spokane from the west via I-90 and continue north through Spokane via Division Street. The two highways share the same route until they reach \\"The Y\\", a fork where US 395 continues northward to Deer Park, Colville then onward to Canada, and US 2 branches off to the northeast, continuing to Mead, Newport, and Sandpoint. US 195, also known as the Inland Empire Highway, connects to Interstate 90 west of Spokane near Latah Creek and travels south through the Palouse. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is tasked with improving local highways to keep up with the region's growth and to try to prevent congestion problems that plague many larger cities. The WSDOT is constructing the North Spokane Corridor. When completed, the corridor will be a limited-access highway that will run from I-90, in the vicinity of the Thor/Freya interchange, northward through Spokane, meeting the existing US 395 just south of the Wandermere Golf Course. =Airports= Concourse C, Spokane International Airport Spokane International Airport (IATA: GEG, ICAO: KGEG) serves as the primary commercial airport for Spokane, Eastern Washington, and Northern Idaho. It is the second- largest airport in the state of Washington, and is recognized by the Federal Aviation Administration as a small hub, with service from six airlines and two air cargo carriers. The airport is located west of downtown Spokane and is approximately a 10-minute drive away. The international airport's three-letter designation is \\"GEG\\", a result and legacy of the Geiger Field days prior to 1960, when the airport was named after Army aviator Major Harold Geiger in 1941. Felts Field is a general aviation airport serving the Spokane area and is located in east Spokane along the south bank of the Spokane River. Aviation at Felts Field dates back to 1913 and the strip served as Spokane's primary airport until commercial air traffic was redirected to Geiger Field after World War II. In 1927, the strip was one of the first in the western U.S. to receive official recognition as an airport by the U.S. Department of Commerce and is now named in honor of James Buell Felts, a Washington Air National Guard pilot. Health-care Deaconess Medical Center The Spokane area has six major hospitals, four of which are full-service facilities. The health- care industry is a large and increasingly important industry in Spokane; the city provides specialized care to many patients from the surrounding Inland Northwest and as far north as the Canada‚ÄìUS border.Stratton (2005), p. 9 The city's health-care needs are served primarily by non-profit Seattle-based Providence Health & Services and non-profit Tacoma-based Multicare Health System, which run the two biggest hospitals, Sacred Heart Medical Center, and Deaconess Hospital, respectively. These two hospitals, the St. Luke's Rehabilitation Institute, and most of Spokane's major health-care facilities, are located on Spokane's Lower-South Hill, just south of downtown, in what is known as the \\"Medical District\\" of Spokane. Sacred Heart Hospital opened originally with just 31 beds on Spokane Falls Boulevard on January 27, 1887, but later moved to its present location at 101 West Eighth Avenue.Popejoy (2010), p.98 As of 2014 it had 642 beds, with 28,319 admissions, 71,543 emergency room visits, and 2,982 births annually, and a full-time staff of 29 doctors and dentists and 583 registered nurses. Deaconess Medical Center, the smaller of the two main hospitals, had 388 beds as of 2014. Other hospitals in the area include the Spokane Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the northwest part of town, Holy Family Hospital on the north side, and Valley Hospital and Medical Center in the Spokane Valley. One of 20 specialty orthopedic Shriners Hospitals in the U.S. is also located in Spokane. One of Washington's two state psychiatric hospitals, Eastern State Hospital, is located away in Medical Lake. Utilities Monroe Street Dam The City of Spokane provides municipal water, wastewater management, and solid waste management. Spokane operates Washington's only waste-to-energy plant as well as two solid waste transfer stations as part of the Spokane Regional Solid Waste System, a collaboration between the City of Spokane and Spokane County. Electricity generated by the waste-to-energy plant is used to operate the facility, with excess energy being sold to Puget Sound Energy. Spokane draws its water from the Spokane Valley‚ÄìRathdrum Prairie Aquifer; this \\"sole source aquifer\\" is the only water supply for Spokane County in Washington, and for Kootenai and Bonner counties in Idaho. Serving over 500,000 people, the aquifer is distinguished in being one of the largest aquifers in the country at 10 trillion gallons, as well as having one of the fastest flow rates in the country at per day, and for its purity. Natural gas and electricity are provided by the local utility, Avista Utilities, while CenturyLink and Comcast provide television, internet, and telephone service. Spokane hosts three hydroelectric generation facilities on the Spokane River: the Upriver Dam, the Upper Falls Dam, and the Monroe Street Dam. The Upriver Dam is owned and operated by the City of Spokane, and generates the electricity needed to operate the municipal water supply's pressure pumps. The power generated in excess of that is sold to Avista Utilities. The Upper Falls and Monroe Street dams are owned and operated by Avista Utilities, and have respective generation capacities of 10 and 15 MW. Media The Review Building Newspaper service in Spokane is provided by its only major daily newspaper, The Spokesman-Review, which has a daily circulation of 76,291 and Sunday circulation of 95,939. The Spokesman-Review was formed from the merger of the Spokane Falls Review (1883‚Äì1894) and the Spokesman (1890‚Äì1893) in 1893 and was first published under the present name on June 29, 1894.Dyar (1952), pp. 1‚Äì658 It later absorbed the competing afternoon paper The Spokane Daily Chronicle, a significant newspaper that existed from 1881 until 1982. More specialized publications include the weekly alternative newspaper The Pacific Northwest Inlander, the bi-weekly Spokane Journal of Business, and the student-run Gonzaga Bulletin. Monthly publications include The Black Lens, an African American community newspaper, a newspaper for parents, Kids Newspaper, and a home and lifestyle magazine, Spokane Coeur d'Alene Living. According to Arbitron, Spokane is the 94th-largest radio market in the U.S., with 532,100 listeners aged 12 and over. There are 28 AM and FM radio stations broadcast in the city. The five most listened-to stations are KKZX-FM (classic rock), KQNT- AM (news/talk), KXLY-FM (country), KISC-FM (adult contemporary), and KZZU-FM (Hot AC). Spokane's primary sources of non-commercial and community radio include Spokane's NPR-affiliate station KPBX-FM and KYRS, a full-power community radio station. Spokane is the 73rd-largest television market in the U.S., accounting for 0.366% of the total TV households in the U.S. The city has six television stations, representing the major commercial networks and public television. Spokane is the television broadcast center for much of eastern Washington (except the Yakima and Tri-Cities area), northern Idaho, northwestern Montana, northeastern Oregon, and parts of southern Canada (by cable television). Spokane receives broadcasts in the Pacific Time Zone, with weekday prime time beginning at 8 pm. Montana and Alberta, Canada are in the Mountain Time Zone and receive Spokane broadcasts one hour later by their local time. The major network television affiliates include KREM (TV) 2 (CBS), KXLY-TV 4 (ABC), KHQ-TV 6 (NBC; Spokane's first television station, on air on December 20, 1952), KAYU 28 (FOX), KSKN 22 (The CW), KSPS-TV 7 (PBS), and KCDT-TV 26 (PBS; operating out of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho).

It is unknown when the present meaning of the word, \\"Sun People\\" replaced this earlier meaning. Unbeknownst to them, the Spokane Valley was the only area within 200 miles that could provide passage to the Inland Empire through the Rockies at a reasonable grade. The present name, set forth by an 1891 charter reincorporated the city under the name \\"Spokane Falls\\", stating: \\"The corporate name of the city is Spokane Falls, and by that name shall have perpetual succession\\" (Charter, Article I). However, a later article in that same charter which was voted on concurrently changed the name to \\"Spokane\\". Secretary of the Spokane chamber of commerce, John R. Reavis tells of Spokane's significance to the Inland Northwest region as an entrep√¥t distributing center (largely the city's raison d'√™tre) in his 1891 Annual Report, writing: \\"By reason of her geographical position and railroad connections Spokane is fitted as no other city is, or ever can be, to be the distributing center of all that country within a radius of 150 miles, and in some instances territory much farther away. There is no point 150 miles from Spokane that is not at least 225 miles from any other city of 10,000 population. We have about us a territory of 60,000 square miles in extent, to every point of which we are nearer than any other city, to every point of which we have better railroad connections and easier grades than any other city ... We have eight lines of railroad that radiate out in all directions through it, so that shipments made here in the morning can reach any point within its borders by nightfall. We have a telephone system connecting us with almost every shipping town and shipping station within its borders. Goods may be ordered, shipped and received, in most instances, within one day. Never was a city more intimately knit to its surrounding territory than Spokane, and never was one more free from a legitimate rival in trade ...\\" The financing for rebuilding the downtown core came in large part from the infusion of investment from Dutch bankers; this investment was so deep that by 1896, one prominent Dutch mortgage company, the Northwestern and Pacific Hypotheekbank owned a quarter of the city.Stratton (2005), p. 33, p. 200 In 1892, the Interstate Commerce Commission agreed with the city after it filed a complaint about these practices, but that decision was struck down by a federal court. In 1906, Spokane sued under the newly passed Hepburn Act, and won on July 24, 1911.Durham (1912), pp. 599‚Äì603 The exact circumstances and sequence of events regarding the discovery of the tree are obscure due to conflicting accounts. Average monthly temperatures obtained by summing the average monthly highs and lows then dividing by 2. A study published in The Spokesman-Review on May 6, 1909, by City bacteriologist, Frank Rose found only seven or eight germs per cubic centimeter of water. As a standard, \\"water that contains 100 germs per cubic centimeter is considered comparatively pure\\". The Spokesman-Review has been a family-owned newspaper since 1894. The Cowles family also owns the city's NBC affiliate, KHQ-TV.

The following year the community received a post office at the residence of A.D. Thayer on Hangman Creek (now Latah Creek), where it remained for five years. In 1884 P. Gimble opened the town's first business, a general store, which was followed by a station for a new branch of the Oregon Railroad & Navigation Company, and warehouses built by the Spokane Grain & Milling Company and the Pacific Coast Elevator Company. In December 1899 a beet sugar factory built by the Washington State Beet Sugar Company opened. It cost $500,000 to build, included a farm, and could process per day. It was considered unprofitable and inferior. Thomas R. Cutler and the Utah Sugar Company advised the factory, based on their success with the Lehi, Utah factory. The factory closed in 1910 and eventually sold to the Gunnison Sugar Company for $100,000. The equipment was installed in Centerfield, Utah in 1917.

Originally, the area was called Fool's Prairie, after the Kalispel Indian who left his own tribe because of a dispute.Drury, Clifford Merrill, First White Women Over the Rockies, Volume 2, Mary Walker's diary, September 11, 1842, page 235 and Chewelah Independent June 12, 1914, History of Chewelah, by Hilda Dickson. crossroadsarchive.net Chewelah and the rest of the Colville River Valley were part of the Colville Indian Reservation from April 9, 1872, when the reservation was created, until July 2, 1872, when a subsequent executive order reduced the size of the reservation.

It had the first Protestant Congregational Church in 1891, the first school in 1869,\\"The Last Bell\\" by Alpa Naff, c. 1984 listed Pinkney City school established 1862 as the first public school in Stevens County. the Spokane Falls and Northern Railroad arrived in 1889, a Catholic church was established in 1885, and the first county newspaper was founded in July 1885.Slater, John B. comments on first newspaper in Stevens County. Initially, Chewelah was a typical pioneer settlement, being an agricultural center as far back as the early 1870s and having its share of prospectors working the adjacent countryside as early as 1842. The town was platted in 1884 and became known for being a rough and tumble mining town; the first lead and silver mines were established around 1886, and others followed in Embry and surrounding areas. The town's newspaper, The Independent, was founded by William Hunter Brownlow (1860‚Äì1946) in 1903 and has been in publication ever since. The first issue came off the press on June 19, 1903, with the help of his four sons‚ÄîTruman, Ralph, Arthur, and Alex‚ÄîBrownlow. The family produced a weekly eight-page newspaper. By 1905 the population had reached 650 souls, and within a few years many prosperous copper, silver, lead, and a few gold mines were flourishing in the area. The most successful ore mined in Chewelah was magnesite. This mineral was used for making bricks and furnace linings that could withstand high temperatures. Magnesite was also an important ingredient for making high-quality steel that was in high demand during World War I. Austria had previously been the main provider of magnesite for the country, but production was interrupted by the War. By 1916 Chewelah's plant was said to be the largest producer of magnesite in the country, and at full production was the largest producer in the world, shipping some 700 tons daily. During the war, there were as many as 800 people working at the plant making high temperature-resistant refractory brick. By 1920 Chewelah's population had grown to 1,600 people and continued to prosper until the late 1960s. In 1968, the magnesite plant closed down due to cheaper competition from Japan and changes in the steel industry. Despite this major change, Chewelah survived the transition from being a \\"one-company town\\", and today Chewelah has several thousand residents and displays a pleasant blend of the past and future. With its moderate climate, dry land, and irrigated farming, ranching and dairy farming continue to be mainstays. Chewelah's diversified economy also includes a ski area and golf course, among other industries.

The population was 4,673 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Stevens County. History John Work, an agent for The Hudson's Bay Company, established Fort Colvile near the Kettle Falls fur trading site in 1825. It replaced the Spokane House and the Flathead Post as the main trading center on the Upper Columbia River. The area was named for Andrew Colvile, a Hudson's Bay Company governor. The fort continued to be used for some time as a center of mining and transportation/supply support associated with gold rushes in the 1850s, particularly the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. After it was abandoned in 1870, some buildings stood until as late as 1910. The site was flooded by Lake Roosevelt after construction of the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River. Americans also wanted to operate in this territory. In the first half of the 19th century, the Oregon boundary dispute (or Oregon question) arose as a result of competing British and American claims to the Pacific Northwest. It was settled by the Oregon Treaty of 1846, which set the new boundary between Canada and the United States at the 49th Parallel, about Forty (40) miles to the north. In 1859, the U.S. Army established a new Fort Colville at Pinkney City, Washington, about 3 miles NE of the current city of Colville. That fort was abandoned in 1882. In late 1871, with the resolution of Hudson's Bay Company land claims, Governor Edward Selig Salomon directed John Wynne to accept those lands which extended south to Orin-Rice Road, including some currently part of the City of Colville.Washington State Archives AR1-J-1 ¬∑ Governor Edward S. Salomon, Correspondence and Subject Files With the planned closure of Fort Colville, businesses and buildings moved to the present location in the Colville River Valley prior to 1882. In January 1883, W. F. Hooker filed the first plat in Stevens County with the name \\"Belmont\\"\\"Colville's First Skyscraper Moved From Main Street\\". (June 3, 1920). Colville-Examiner, p. 3. or \\"Bellmond\\"Hilgard, Eugene W.

He was encouraged to change the plat name to Colville so that the county seat could be moved to this location. On December 28, 1883, the Stevens County Board of County Commissioners, including county commissioner John U. Hofstetter, held a special session regarding the removal of county records to Belmont from the county seat of Colville, formerly called Pinkney City. In that meeting, commissioners allowed moving the county seat and jail to the town with the name of Colville, if proprietors provided a block of land for them without cost. County officers were allowed to move into a building owned by John U. Hofstetter for two years. On January 1, 1884, the Stevens County courthouse moved to Colville.Stevens County Board of County Commissioner's Journal Book A 1860-1883 City tradition says that Colville was founded by John U. Hofstetter. It was officially incorporated as a city on June 7, 1890. In the 1950s, the Colville Air Force Station was developed and operated 14.7 miles north and east of Colville as part of the Air Defense Command's network of radar stations. A few buildings remain at the site today. It is used largely by paint-ballers. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

History Marcus, circa 1900 Marcus was named for Marcus Oppenheimer who settled in the area in 1863. Marcus was a supply and transportation base for northward-bound travellers during the Big Bend Gold Rush of the 1860s in the Colony of British Columbia due to its location just above Kettle Falls, a wall to river navigation. In 1865 the steamboat Forty- Nine was built at Marcus to attempt the run to the goldrush boomtown of La Porte at the foot of the infamous Dalles des Morts or \\"Death Rapids\\", which were located in the immediate vicinity of the rush and were the upper barrier to river navigation. Regular service from Marcus to La Porte did not begin until 1866 due to difficult winter conditions at the Narrows of the Arrow Lakes on the first attempt in 1865.

Janni‚Äôs chimney Peter Janni was born in Italy in 1874 and came to America to work on the railroad. Eventually he ended up in Northport and in 1923 purchased a limestone quarry south of Northport.N.L. Barlee, Gold Creeks and Ghost Towns of Northeastern Washington., Hancock House Publishers., 2004 Janni shipped limestone all over Washington from the quarry. The quarry was located in the center of the tetrahedrite mineralized zone of Northern Stevens County. Ore deposits in the district occur in ‚ÄúVugs‚Äù or ‚ÄúChimneys‚Äù usually narrow veins of galena with high silver content. In 1953 Janni‚Äôs crew discovered a chimney of galena with silver, 6 feet by 5 feet on the second level of the quarry. They followed it down and shipped nearly forty tons of high grade galena to CM&S; Company‚Äôs lead refinery in nearby Trail. After following it down 15 feet Janni came and said ‚Äúcover the damn thing up‚Äù.

The population of the city itself was 31,802 at the 2010 census. The population of Walla Walla and its two suburbs, the town of College Place and unincorporated East Walla Walla, is about 45,000. Walla Walla is in the southeastern region of Washington, approximately four hours away from Portland, Oregon, and four and half hours from Seattle, and only north of the Oregon border. History Recorded history in this state begins with the establishment of Fort Nez Perce in 1818 by the North West Company to trade with the Walla Walla people and other local Native American groups. At the time, the term \\"Nez Perce\\" was used more broadly than today, and included the Walla Walla in its scope in English usage.Alvin M. Josephy, The Nez Perce Indians and the Opening of the Northwest, Abridged Edition (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1965), p. 51 Fort Nez Perce had its name shift to Fort Walla Walla. It was located significantly west of the present city. On September 1, 1836, Marcus Whitman arrived with his wife Narcissa Whitman. Here they established the Whitman Mission in an unsuccessful attempt to convert the local Walla Walla tribe to Christianity. Following a disease epidemic, both were killed in 1847 by the Cayuse who believed that the missionaries were poisoning the native peoples. Whitman College was established in their honor. On July 24, 1846, Pope Pius IX established the Diocese of Walla Walla and appointed Augustin-Magloire Blanchet to become the first Bishop of Walla Walla. The diocese was short-lived as Bishop Blanchet fled to St. Paul, Oregon, after the Whitman Massacre. In 1850, the Diocese of Nesqually was established in Vancouver and in 1853 the Diocese of Walla Walla was suppressed and absorbed into the Diocese of Nesqually. Today, the Diocese of Walla Walla is a titular see currently held by Witold Mroziewski, an auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn. The original North West Company and later Hudson's Bay Company Fort Nez Perc√©s fur trading outpost, became a major stopping point for migrants moving west to Oregon Country. The fort has been restored with many of the original buildings preserved. The current Fort Walla Walla contains these buildings, albeit in a different location from the original, as well as a museum about the early settlers' lives. The origins of Walla Walla at its present site begin with the establishment of Fort Walla Walla by the United States Army here in 1856.Josephy, The Nez Perce, p. 367 The Walla Walla River, where it adjoins the Columbia River, was the starting point for the Mullan Road, constructed between 1859 and 1860 by US Army Lieut. John Mullan, connecting the head of navigation on the Columbia at Walla Walla (i.e., the west coast of the United States) with the head of navigation on the Missouri- Mississippi (that is, the east and gulf coasts of the U.S.) at Fort Benton, Montana. Walla Walla was incorporated on January 11, 1862. As a result of a gold rush in Idaho, during this decade the city became the largest community in the territory of Washington, at one point slated to be the new state's capital. Following this period of rapid growth, agriculture became the city's primary industry. Baker Boyer Bank, the oldest bank in the state of Washington, was founded in Walla Walla in 1869. In 1936, Walla Walla and surrounding areas were struck by the magnitude 6.1 State Line earthquake. Residents reported hearing a moderate rumbling immediately before the shock. There was significant damage in the area, and aftershocks were felt for several months following. Fort Walla Walla - 1874 Baker Boyer Bank building, built in 1911 In 2001 Walla Walla was a Great American Main Street Award winner for the transformation and preservation of its once dilapidated main street. In July 2011, USA Today selected Walla Walla as the friendliest small city in the United States. Walla Walla was also named Friendliest Small Town in America the same year as part of Rand McNally's annual Best of the Road contest. In 2012 and 2013 Walla Walla was a runner-up in the best food category for the Best of the Road. Etymology Tourists to Walla Walla are often told that it is a \\"town so nice they named it twice\\". Some locals and Walla Walla natives often refer to the city in text form with \\"W2.\\" Walla Walla is a Native American name that means \\"Place of Many Waters\\" because the original settlement was at the junction of the Snake and Columbia rivers. The original name of the town was Steptoeville, named after Colonel Edward Steptoe. In 1855 the name was changed to Waiilatpu, and then by 1859 had been changed again, this time to the name it holds today. Walla Walla is humorously mentioned in the Three Stooges. Geography and climate Walla Walla is located at (46.065094, ‚àí118.330167). Walla Walla is also located in the Walla Walla Valley, with the rolling Palouse hills and the Blue Mountains to the east of town. Various creeks meander through town before combining to become the Walla Walla River, which drains into the Columbia River about west of town. The city lies in the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains, so annual precipitation is fairly low. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Walla Walla has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate according to the K√∂ppen climate classification system (K√∂ppen Csa). It is one of the northernmost locations in North America to qualify as having such a climate. In contrast to most other locations having this climate type in North America, Walla Walla can experience fairly cold winter conditions.

Economy and infrastructure=Agriculture Though wheat is still a big crop, vineyards and wineries have become economically important over the last three decades. In summer 2006, there were over 100 wineries in the greater Walla Walla area. Following the wine boom, the town has developed several fine dining establishments and luxury hotels. The Marcus Whitman Hotel, originally opened in 1928, was renovated with original fixtures and furnitures. It is the tallest building in the city, at 13 stories. Walla Walla Farmers Market The Walla Walla Sweet Onion is another crop with a rich tradition. Over a century ago on the Island of Corsica, off the west coast of Italy, a French soldier named Peter Pieri found an Italian sweet onion seed and brought it to the Walla Walla Valley. Impressed by the new onion's winter hardiness, Pieri, and the Italian immigrant farmers who comprised much of Walla Walla's gardening industry, harvested the seed. The sweet onion developed over several generations through the process of selecting onions from each year's crop, targeting sweetness, size and round shape. The Walla Walla Sweet Onion is designated under federal law as a protected agricultural crop. In 2007 the Walla Walla Sweet Onion became Washington's official state vegetable. Walla Walla Sweet Onions have low sulfur content, about half that of an ordinary yellow onion. Walla Walla Sweets are 90 percent water. The Walla Walla Sweet Onion Festival is held annually in July. Walla Walla currently has two farmers markets, both held from May until October. The first is located on the corner of 4th and Main, and is coordinated by the Downtown Walla Walla Foundation. The other is at the Walla Walla County Fairgrounds on S. Ninth Ave, run by the WW Valley Farmer's Market. Wine industry Walla Walla has experienced an explosion in its wine industry over the last ten years. Several of the wineries have received top scores from wine publications such as Wine Spectator, The Wine Advocate and Wine and Spirits. L'Ecole 41, Woodward Canyon, Waterbrook Winery and Leonetti Cellar were the pioneers starting in the 1970s and 1980s. Although most of the early recognition went to the wines made from Merlot and Cabernet, Syrah is fast becoming a star varietal in this appellation.Walla Walla Valley Wine Alliance website - http://wallawallawine.com/ Today there are over 100 wineries in the Walla Walla Valley and a host of shops catering to the wine industry. Walla Walla Community College offers an associate degree (AAAS) in winemaking and grape growing through its 10-year-old Center for Enology and Viticulture, which operates its own commercial winery, College Cellars.College Cellars website - http://www.collegecellars.com One challenge to growing grapes in Walla Walla Valley is the risk of a killing freeze during the winter. They average one every six or seven years and the penultimate one, in 2004, destroyed about 75% of the wine grape crop in the valley. The valley was again hit with a killing frost in November 2010, leading to a 28% decline in Cabernet Sauvignon production, a 20% decline in red grape production, and an overall decline in production of 11% (red and white varietals).Sean Sullivan's Washington Wine Report - http://www.wawinereport.com/2012/02/cabernet-sauvignon-production- down-28.html The wineries generate over $100 million (US) to the valley annually. There are more than 140 wineries in the Walla Walla area. Corrections industry The second-largest prison in Washington, after nearby Coyote Ridge Corrections Center in Connell, is the Washington State Penitentiary (WSP) located in Walla Walla, at 1313 North 13th. Originally opened in 1886, it now houses about 2,000 offenders. In addition, there are about 1000 staff members. In 2005, the financial benefit to the local economy was estimated to be about $55 million through salaries, medical services, utilities, and local purchases. The penitentiary is undergoing an extensive expansion project that will increase the prison capacity to 2,500 violent offenders and double the staff size. Until October 11, 2018, Washington was a death penalty state, and occasional executions took place at the state penitentiary; the last execution took place on September 10, 2010. Washington was also one of the last two states to allow hanging as a choice when sentenced to death (the other being New Hampshire); there has not been a hanging since May 1994 (the default method of execution was changed to lethal injection in 1996). Washington was the last state with an active gallows. Healthcare Walla Walla is served by two health care institutions: St. Mary Medical Center (part of the Catholic Providence Health System) and the Jonathan M. Wainwright Veteran's Affairs Medical Center on the grounds of the old Fort Walla Walla and WWII training facility. Transportation Transportation to Walla Walla includes service by air through Walla Walla Regional Airport, several railroads, and highway access primarily from U.S. Route 12. The Washington State Department of Transportation is engaged in a long-term process of widening this road into a four-lane divided highway between Pasco and Walla Walla, scheduled to be complete in 2020. The highway also acts as the main gateway to Interstates 82 and 84, which run to the west and south, respectively. State Route 125 runs through the city, north to State Route 124 in Prescott and south to Milton-Freewater, Oregon, becoming Oregon Highway 11 at the state line. There are four major bus services in the area connecting the region's cities. Walla Walla and nearby College Place are served by Valley Transit, a typical multi-route city bus service. The city of Milton-Freewater, OR has a single-line bus service with several stops in town with two stops in College Place and five in Walla Walla. Travel Washington's Grape Line is a intercity service between Walla Walla and Pasco that runs three times a day. Finally, Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation operates a Kayak bus to Pendleton, with four trips each weekday and two trips each Saturday via its Walla Walla Whistler route.http://ctuir.org/system/files/Walla%20Walla%20Whistler_14.pdf Whitman Hotel at Rose and Second in the \\"Great Neighborhood\\" Sterling Bank in one of the renovated buildings in the \\"Great Neighborhood.\\" Sports Walla Walla is home of the Walla Walla Sweets, a summer collegiate baseball team that plays in the West Coast League. The league comprises college players and prospects working towards a professional baseball career. Teams are located in British Columbia, Oregon and Washington. Sweets home games have been played at Borleske Stadium in Walla Walla, since their first season in 2010. In only their second season the Sweets played in the WCL Championship game, ultimately losing to the Corvallis Knights. In 2013, the Sweets won their first North Division title with the second best win-loss record in the WCL. The Sweets lost their North Division playoff series to the Wenatchee Applesox that year. There also is a women's flat track roller derby league called the Walla Walla Sweets Rollergirls, their practices and games are played at the Walla Walla YMCA. Walla Walla is the location of Tour of Walla Walla, a four-stage road cycling race held annually in April. The races are held in Walla Walla and in the Palouse hills of nearby Waitsburg. The stages include two road races, a time trial, and a criterium race. The annual Walla Walla Marathon takes place in October and includes a full marathon, half-marathon, and 10k race. The full marathon is a Boston Marathon Qualifier. The race route winds through the streets of the city of Walla Walla and the country roads outside of town, often running past several of the region's many estate vineyards.  Fine and performing arts  The Walla Walla Valley boasts a number of fine and performing arts organizations and venues. * The Walla Walla Valley Bands were formed in 1989 and currently boasts a Concert Band of more than 70 and two Jazz Ensembles. The group rehearses weekly on Tuesday nights at the Walla Walla Valley Adventist Academy in nearby College Place. * The Walla Walla Symphony began in 1906 and performs a season of about six concerts per year at Whitman College's Cordiner Hall. * The Walla Walla Chamber Music Festival is held twice a year and features guest musical ensembles playing classical chamber music in various small venues throughout town. The summer festival includes performances for almost the whole month of June. The winter festival is a small-scale version of the summer program, it is held in mid-January. * Shakespeare Walla Walla is a non-profit organization that hosts a summer Shakespeare festival in Walla Walla. They often bring Shakespeare troupes from Seattle and elsewhere to perform about four plays per year. In the past this was done at the Fort Walla Walla Amphitheater, but more recently at the GESA Powerhouse Theatre. * The GESA Powerhouse Theatre opened in 2011 in Walla Walla; it was originally the Walla Walla gas plant, hence its name. Its dimensions closely resemble the Blackfriars Theatre once used by William Shakespeare. The venue is used by Shakespeare Walla Walla as well as host to various concerts and other performing arts events throughout the year. * The Little Theatre of Walla Walla began in 1944 and moved into its current building on Sumach St. in 1948 where it has performed various plays to this day. * The Walla Walla Choral Society began in 1980 and performs a season of three or four concerts per year in various locations around the Walla Walla Valley. * Fort Walla Walla Amphitheater is an open-air stage with bench seating on the grounds of the Fort Walla Walla Park, next to Fort Walla Walla Museum. It used to host Shakespeare Walla Walla productions and now hosts the Walla Walla Community College Summer Musical. In addition, the area's three colleges‚ÄîWhitman College, Walla Walla University and Walla Walla Community College as well as its largest public high school‚ÄîWalla Walla High School‚Äîstage theater and music performances. Education Whitman College Administration Building in the Fall Walla Walla is primarily served by the Walla Walla Public Schools, which includes seven elementary schools, (1 is in Dixie, 6 of them are K-5 with 1 being PreK-5), two middle schools, one traditional high school (colloquially Wa-Hi), and two alternative high schools (Lincoln and Opportunity). There is also Homelink, an alternative K-8 education program which is a hybrid of homeschooling and public school programs. There are several private Christian schools in the area. These include: * The Walla Walla Catholic Schools (Assumption K-8 School and DeSales High School) * Liberty Christian School, non-denominational * Rogers Adventist School and Walla Walla Valley Academy, in nearby College Place, both of Seventh-day Adventist affiliation * Saint Basil Academy of Classical Studies (K-8) In addition to these, there are three colleges in the area: * Walla Walla Community College, co-winner of the 2013 Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence * Whitman College, an independent liberal arts college * Walla Walla University, in nearby College Place, Washington, affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist denomination Sister cities In 1972, Walla Walla established a sister city relationship with Sasayama (now named Tamba- Sasayama), Japan. The two cities have since named roads after their counterpart sister city. Walla Walla has also hosted exchange students from Tamba-Sasayama since 1994 for a two-week home-stay experience. Yearlong high school student exchanges between the cities have occurred several times in the past. Cultural/art exchanges involving music, dance, and various art mediums have also occurred. The Walla Walla Sister City Committee has been the recipient of the Washington State Sister City Association Peace Prize in 2011 and 2014 for their involvement in promoting peace, cultural understanding and friendship.

In humans, it is sometimes defined as an adult height of less than , regardless of sex; the average adult height among people with dwarfism is , although some individuals with dwarfism are slightly taller.https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases- conditions/dwarfism/symptoms- causes/syc-20371969#:~:text=Dwarfism%20is%20short%20stature%20that,4%20feet%20(122%20cm). Disproportionate dwarfism is characterized by either short limbs or a short torso. In cases of proportionate dwarfism, both the limbs and torso are unusually small. Intelligence is usually normal, and most have a nearly normal life expectancy. The most common and recognisable form of dwarfism in humans is the genetic disorder achondroplasia, comprising 70% of cases. Growth hormone deficiency is responsible for most other cases. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Those with genetic disorders can sometimes be treated with surgery or physical therapy. Hormone disorders can also be treated with growth hormone therapy before the child's growth plates fuse. Individual accommodations, such as specialized furniture, are often used by people with dwarfism. Many support groups provide services to aid individuals and the discrimination they may face. In addition to the medical aspect of the condition, there are also social aspects. For a person with dwarfism, height discrimination can lead to ridicule in childhood and discrimination in adulthood.University of Pennsylvania, Arts and Sciences: \\"The Effect of Adolescent Experience on Labor Market Outcomes: The Case of Height\\" . In the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and other English-speaking countries, labels that some people with dwarfism accept include dwarf, little person (LP), or person of short stature, but most prefer to be called by their name. Historically, the term \\"midget\\" was used to describe proportionate dwarfs; however, this term is now regarded as offensive by some. Signs and symptoms Dwarfism occurs in animals as well as humans; horses can have achondroplastic symptoms, as shown here next to a person with dwarfism. A defining characteristic of dwarfism is an adult height less than the 2.3rd percentile of the CDC standard growth charts. There is a wide range of physical characteristics. Variations in individuals are identified by diagnosing and monitoring the underlying disorders. There may not be any complications outside adapting to their size. Short stature is a common replacement of the term 'dwarfism', especially in a medical context. Short stature is clinically defined as a height within the lowest 2.3% of those in the general population. However, those with mild skeletal dysplasias may not be affected by dwarfism. In some cases of untreated hypochondroplasia, males grow up to 5 feet 5 inches. Though that is short in a relative context, it does not fall into the extreme ranges of the growth charts. Disproportionate dwarfism is characterized by shortened limbs or a shortened torso. In achondroplasia one has an average-sized trunk with short limbs and a larger forehead. Facial features are often affected and individual body parts may have problems associated with them. Spinal stenosis, ear infection, and hydrocephalus are common. In case of spinal dysostosis, one has a small trunk, with average-sized limbs. Proportionate dwarfism is marked by a short torso with short limbs, thus leading to a height that is significantly below average. There may be long periods without any significant growth. Sexual development is often delayed or impaired into adulthood. This dwarfism type is caused by an endocrine disorder and not a skeletal dysplasia. Physical effects of malformed bones vary according to the specific disease. Many involve joint pain caused by abnormal bone alignment, or from nerve compression. Early degenerative joint disease, exaggerated lordosis or scoliosis, and constriction of spinal cord or nerve roots can cause pain and disability. Reduced thoracic size can restrict lung growth and reduce pulmonary function. Some forms of dwarfism are associated with disordered function of other organs, such as the brain or liver, sometimes severely enough to be more of an impairment than the unusual bone growth. Mental effects also vary according to the specific underlying syndrome. In most cases of skeletal dysplasia, such as achondroplasia, mental function is not impaired. However, there are syndromes which can affect the cranial structure and growth of the brain, severely impairing mental capacity. Unless the brain is directly affected by the underlying disorder, there is little to no chance of mental impairment that can be attributed to dwarfism. The psycho-social limitations of society may be more disabling than the physical symptoms, especially in childhood and adolescence, but people with dwarfism vary greatly in the degree to which social participation and emotional health are affected. * Social prejudice against extreme shortness may reduce social and marital opportunities. * Numerous studies have demonstrated reduced employment opportunities. Severe shortness is associated with lower income. * Self-esteem may suffer and family relationships may be affected. * Extreme shortness (in the low 2‚Äì3-foot [60‚Äì90 cm] range) can, if not accommodated for, interfere with activities of daily living, like driving or using countertops built for taller people. Other common attributes of dwarfism such as bowed knees and unusually short fingers can lead to back problems and difficulty in walking and handling objects. * Children with dwarfism are particularly vulnerable to teasing and ridicule from classmates. Because dwarfism is relatively uncommon, children may feel isolated from their peers. Causes Seneb, court official and priest for the Ancient Egyptian rulers Khufu and Djedefre, with his wife Senetites and their childrenAncient Egypt: Kingdom of the Pharaohs, R. Hamilton, p. 47, Paragon, 2006, Dwarfism can result from many medical conditions, each with its own separate symptoms and causes. Extreme shortness in humans with proportional body parts usually has a hormonal cause, such as growth-hormone deficiency, once called pituitary dwarfism. Two disorders, achondroplasia and growth hormone deficiency, are responsible for the majority of human dwarfism cases. Achondroplasia The most recognizable and most common form of dwarfism in humans is achondroplasia, which accounts for 70% of dwarfism cases, and occurs in 4 to 15 out of 100,000 live births. It produces rhizomelic short limbs, increased spinal curvature, and distortion of skull growth. In achondroplasia the body's limbs are proportionately shorter than the trunk (abdominal area), with a larger head than average and characteristic facial features. Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by the presence of a faulty allele in the genome. If a pair of achondroplasia alleles are present, the result is fatal. Achondroplasia is a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. In the context of achondroplasia, this mutation causes FGFR3 to become constitutively active, inhibiting bone growth. Research by urologist Harry Fisch of the Male Reproductive Center at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital indicates that in humans this defect may be exclusively inherited from the father and becomes increasingly probable with paternal age: specifically males reproducing after 35. Growth hormone deficiency Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a medical condition in which the body produces insufficient growth hormone. Growth hormone, also called somatotropin, is a polypeptide hormone which stimulates growth and cell reproduction. If this hormone is lacking, stunted or even halted growth may become apparent. Children with this disorder may grow slowly and puberty may be delayed by several years or indefinitely. Growth hormone deficiency has no single definite cause. It can be caused by mutations of specific genes, damage to the pituitary gland, Turner's syndrome, poor nutrition, or even stress (leading to psychogenic dwarfism). Laron syndrome (growth hormone insensitivity) is another cause. Those with growth hormone issues tend to be proportionate. Other Other causes of dwarfism are spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, diastrophic dysplasia, pseudoachondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, Noonan syndrome, primordial dwarfism, Turner syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), and hypothyroidism. Severe shortness with skeletal distortion also occurs in several of the Mucopolysaccharidoses and other storage disorders. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may cause proportionate, yet temporary, dwarfism. Serious chronic illnesses may produce dwarfism as a side effect. Harsh environmental conditions, such as malnutrition, may also produce dwarfism. These types of dwarfism are indirect consequences of the generally unhealthy or malnourished condition of the individual, and not of any specific disease. The dwarfism often takes the form of simple short stature, without any deformities, thus leading to proportionate dwarfism. In societies where poor nutrition is widespread, the average height of the population may be reduced below its genetic potential by the lack of proper nutrition. Sometimes there is no definitive cause of short stature. Diagnosis Dwarfism is often diagnosed in childhood on the basis of visible symptoms. A physical examination can usually suffice to diagnose certain types of dwarfism, but genetic testing and diagnostic imaging may be used to determine the exact condition. In a person's youth, growth charts that track height can be used to diagnose subtle forms of dwarfism that have no other striking physical characteristics. Short stature or stunted growth during youth is usually what brings the condition to medical attention. Skeletal dysplasia is usually suspected because of obvious physical features (e.g., unusual configuration of face or shape of skull), because of an obviously affected parent, or because body measurements (arm span, upper to lower segment ratio) indicate disproportion. Bone X-rays are often key to diagnosing a specific skeletal dysplasia, but are not the sole diagnostic tool. Most children with suspected skeletal dysplasias are referred to a genetics clinic for diagnostic confirmation and genetic counseling. Since about the year 2000, genetic tests for some of the specific disorders have become available. During an initial medical evaluation of shortness, the absence of disproportion and other clues listed above usually indicates causes other than bone dysplasias. Classification Lavinia Warren, an actress with pituitary dwarfism (growth hormone deficiency). In men and women, the sole requirement for being considered a dwarf is having an adult height under and it is almost always classified with respect to the underlying condition that is the cause of the short stature. Dwarfism is usually caused by a genetic variant; achondroplasia is caused by a mutation on chromosome 4. If dwarfism is caused by a medical disorder, the person is referred to by the underlying diagnosed disorder. Disorders causing dwarfism are often classified by proportionality. Disproportionate dwarfism describes disorders that cause unusual proportions of the body parts, while proportionate dwarfism results in a generally uniform stunting of the body. Disorders that cause dwarfism may be classified according to one of hundreds of names, which are usually permutations of the following roots: * location ** rhizomelic = root, i.e., bones of the upper arm or thigh ** mesomelic = middle, i.e., bones of the forearm or lower leg ** acromelic = end, i.e., bones of hands and feet. ** micromelic = entire limbs are shortened * source ** chondro = of cartilage ** osteo = of bone ** spondylo = of the vertebrae ** plasia = form ** trophy = growth Examples include achondroplasia and chondrodystrophy. Prevention Many types of dwarfism are currently impossible to prevent because they are genetically caused. Genetic conditions that cause dwarfism may be identified with genetic testing, by screening for the specific variations that result in the condition. However, due to the number of causes of dwarfism, it may be impossible to determine definitively if a child will be born with dwarfism. Dwarfism resulting from malnutrition or a hormonal abnormality may be treated with an appropriate diet or hormonal therapy. Growth hormone deficiency may be remedied via injections of human growth hormone (HGH) during early life. Management Genetic mutations of most forms of dwarfism caused by bone dysplasia cannot be altered yet, so therapeutic interventions are typically aimed at preventing or reducing pain or physical disability, increasing adult height, or mitigating psychosocial stresses and enhancing social adaptation. Forms of dwarfism associated with the endocrine system may be treated using hormonal therapy. If the cause is prepubescent hyposecretion of growth hormone, supplemental growth hormone may correct the abnormality. If the receptor for growth hormone is itself affected, the condition may prove harder to treat. Hypothyroidism is another possible cause of dwarfism that can be treated through hormonal therapy. Injections of thyroid hormone can mitigate the effects of the condition, but lack of proportion may be permanent. Pain and disability may be ameliorated by physical therapy, braces or other orthotic devices, or by surgical procedures. The only simple interventions that increase perceived adult height are dress enhancements, such as shoe lifts or hairstyle. Growth hormone is rarely used for shortness caused by bone dysplasias, since the height benefit is typically small (less than ) and the cost high. The most effective means of increasing adult height by several inches is distraction osteogenesis, though availability is limited and the cost is high in terms of money, discomfort, and disruption of life. Most people with dwarfism do not choose this option, and it remains controversial. For other types of dwarfism, surgical treatment is not possible. Society and culture=Terminology Norse dwarfs as depicted in a 19th-century edition of the Poetic Edda poem V√∂lusp√° (1895) by Lorenz Fr√∏lich The appropriate term for describing a person of particularly short stature (or with the genetic condition achondroplasia) has historically been ambiguous, and has developed euphemistically over the past few centuries. The noun dwarf stems from Old English dweorg, originally referring to a being from Germanic mythology‚Äîa dwarf‚Äîthat dwells in mountains and in the earth, and is associated with wisdom, smithing, mining, and crafting. The etymology of the word dwarf is contested, and scholars have proposed varying theories about the origins of the being, including that dwarfs may have originated as nature spirits or as beings associated with death, or as a mixture of concepts. Competing etymologies include a basis in the Indo-European root *dheur- (meaning 'damage'), the Indo-European root *dhreugh (whence modern German Traum 'dream' and Trug 'deception'), and comparisons have been made with the Old Indian dhvaras (a type of demonic being). The being may not have gained associations with small stature until a later period.Simek, Rudolf (2007) translated by Angela Hall. Dictionary of Northern Mythology, pp. 67‚Äì68. D.S. Brewer The terms \\"dwarf\\", \\"little person\\", \\"LP\\", and \\"person of short stature\\" are now generally considered acceptable by most people affected by these disorders. However, the plural \\"dwarfs\\" as opposed to \\"dwarves\\" is generally preferred in the medical context, possibly because the plural \\"dwarves\\" was popularized by author J.R.R. Tolkien, describing a race of characters in his The Lord of the Rings books resembling Norse dwarfs. \\"Midget\\", whose etymology indicates a \\"tiny biting insect\\", came into prominence in the mid-19th century after Harriet Beecher Stowe used it in her novels Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands and Old Town Folks where she described children and an extremely short man, respectively. Later some people of short stature considered the word to be offensive because it was the descriptive term applied to P. T. Barnum's dwarfs used for public amusement during the freak show era. It is also not considered accurate as it is not a medical term or diagnosis, though it is sometimes used as a slang term to describe those who are particularly short, whether or not they have dwarfism. Dwarf sports Dwarfs are supported to compete in sport by a number of organisations nationally and internationally. The Dwarf Athletic Association of America and the Dwarf Sports Association UK provide opportunities for dwarfs to compete nationally and internationally in the Americas and Europe respectively. The Dwarf Sports Association UK organises between 5 and 20 events per month for athletes with restricted growth conditions in the UK. For instance, swimming and bicycling are often recommended for people with skeletal dysplasias, since those activities put minimal pressure on the spine. Since its early days, professional wrestling has had the involvement of dwarf athletes. \\"Midget wrestling\\" had its heyday in the 1950s‚Äì70s, when wrestlers such as Little Beaver, Lord Littlebrook, and Fuzzy Cupid toured North America, and Sky Low Low was the first holder of the National Wrestling Alliance's World Midget Championship. In the following couple of decades, more wrestlers became prominent in North America, including foreign wrestlers like Japan's Little Tokyo. Although the term is seen by some as pejorative, many past and current midget wrestlers, including Hornswoggle, have said they take pride in the term due to its history in the industry and its marketability. Art and media depictions Ivory statuette of a woman with dwarfism, Gerzeh culture (Naqada II), Prehistoric Egypt In art, literature, and movies, dwarfs are rarely depicted as ordinary people who are very short but rather as a species apart. Novelists, artists, and moviemakers may attach special moral or aesthetic significance to their \\"apartness\\" or misshapenness. Artistic representations of dwarfism can be found on Greek vases and other ancient artifacts, including ancient Egyptian art in which dwarfs are likely to have been seen as a divine manifestation, with records indicating they could reach high positions in society.Ancient Egyptian Medicine, John F. Nunn, University of Oklahoma Press, 2002, pp. 78‚Äì79, The Bhagavat Purana Hindu text devotes nine chapters to the adventures of Vamana, a dwarf avatar of Lord Vishnu. The Dwarf Don Sebasti√°n de Morra, by Vel√°zquez Depictions of dwarfism are also found in European paintings and many illustrations. Many European paintings (especially Spanish) of the 16th‚Äì19th centuries depict dwarfs by themselves or with others. In the Talmud, it is said that the second born son of the Egyptian Pharaoh of the Bible was a dwarf.The Talmud ‚Äì Chapter VI. Death Of Jacob And His Sons ‚Äì Moses ‚Äì The Deliverance From Egypt. URL accessed April 23, 2007. Recent scholarship has suggested that ancient Egyptians held dwarfs in high esteem. Several important mythological figures of the North American Wyandot nation are portrayed as dwarfs.Trigger, Bruce G., The Children of Aataentsic: A History of the Huron People to 1660 McGill-Queen's University Press, 1987 , p. 529. As popular media have become more widespread, the number of works depicting dwarfs have increased dramatically. Dwarfism is depicted in many books, films, and TV series such as Willow, The Wild Wild West, The Man with the Golden Gun (and later parodied in Austin Powers), Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift,Gulliver's Travels: Complete, Authoritative Text with Biographical and Historical Contexts, Palgrave Macmillan 1995 (p. 21). The quote has been misattributed to Alexander Pope, who wrote to Swift in praise of the book just a day earlier. The Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, Bad Santa, A Son of the Circus, Little People Big World, The Little Couple, A Song of Ice and Fire (and its TV adaptation Game of Thrones), Seinfeld, The Orator, In Bruges, The Tin Drum by G√ºnter Grass, the short-lived reality show The Littlest Groom, and the films The Station Agent and Zero. The Animal Planet TV series Pit Boss features dwarf actor Shorty Rossi and his talent agency, \\"Shortywood Productions\\", which Rossi uses to provide funding for his pit bull rescue operation, \\"Shorty's Rescue\\". Rossi's three full-time employees, featured in the series, are all little people and aspiring actors. In September 2014, Creative Business House, along with Donnons Leur Une Chance, created the International Dwarf Fashion Show to raise awareness and boost self-confidence of people living with dwarfism.

The expedition spent three days at the village of Chief Yallept and his tribe of Walla Walla people (relatives of the Nez Perce), in the company of about a hundred Yakama people. Meriwether Lewis estimated the total of Native American people at around 550. There the expedition learned of an overland route to the Nez Perce homelands, which shortened their route by some eighty miles. During David Thompson's 1811 voyage down the Columbia River, he camped at the Snake River confluence on July 9, 1811. There he erected a pole and notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a trading post at the site. European settlement of the area began in 1818, when the North West Company built Fort Nez Perce at the mouth of the Walla Walla River. The location was chosen to compete with the Hudson's Bay Company for the fur trade in the Pacific Northwest. That site was maintained until 1855. The first railroad to connect Walla Walla with the Columbia River at Wallula was begun in 1871. The line, called the Walla Walla and Columbia River Railroad, was completed October 23, 1875. The line was later absorbed into the Northern Pacific Railroad. To save money, the original rails were wooden, with strap iron on the upper surface. In 1883, the Northern Pacific completed its line from St. Paul, Minnesota, to present-day Wallula. It built a railroad bridge across the river to connect to the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company tracks along the south side of the Columbia River.

The population was 8,413 at the 2010 census, a 69.6% increase over the 2000 census. Birch Bay was named in 1792 by Archibald Menzies, a member of the Vancouver Expedition. Vancouver's two ships used Birch Bay as an anchorage for several days. Menzies noted a number of species of birch and gave the name to the bay. Geography Birch Bay is located at (48.932167, -122.747192).

Geology 900px Birch Bay is a headland bay created by the refraction of incoming waves on the headlands that lie on either side of the bay. The headland to the north is Birch Point, and the one to the south is Point Whitehorn. The waves bend as they enter the bay and lose energy in the process. The result is a half-moon- shaped bay with a gentle sloping beach. The beach has been modified in past years by the implementation of groins and riprap. Terrell Creek runs parallel along a section of the beach, eventually flowing into the bay.

The city's northern boundary is the Canada‚ÄìUS border; the Peace Arch international monument straddles the border of both countries. The population was 4,684 at the 2010 census. Since Blaine is located right on the border with Canada, it is the northernmost city on Interstate 5, the southernmost being San Diego, California. History The area was first settled in the mid-19th century by pioneers who established the town as a seaport for the west coast logging and fishing industries, and as a jumping off point for prospectors heading to British Columbia's gold fields. Blaine was officially incorporated on May 20, 1890, and was named after James G. Blaine (1830‚àí1893), who was a U.S. senator from the state of Maine, Secretary of State, and, in 1884, the unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate. The city has a \\"turn-of-the-century\\" theme, marked by remodeled buildings and signs resembling designs that existed during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The once conveyed workers to and from the cannery in the 1930s. Today it ferries tourists from Blaine to a resort on Semiahmoo Spit. The world's largest salmon cannery was operated by the Alaska Packers' Association for decades in Blaine; the cannery site has been converted to a waterfront destination resort on Semiahmoo Spit. Several saw mills once operated on Blaine's waterfront, and much of the lumber was transported from its wharves and docks to help rebuild San Francisco following the 1906 fire there. The forests were soon logged, but Blaine's fishing industry remained strong and robust into the second half of the 20th century. Into the 1970s Blaine was home to hundreds of commercial purse seiners and gillnetters plying the waters offshore of British Columbia, between Washington state and southeast Alaska. Blaine's two large marinas are still home to hundreds of recreational sailboats and yachts, and a small fleet of determined local fishers provide visitors with dockside sale of fresh salmon, crab and oysters. Nature lovers have always appreciated Blaine's coastal location, its accessible bike and walking trails, and view of mountains and water. Birdwatchers across the continent have discovered the area's high content of migratory birds and waterfowl: Blaine's Drayton Harbor, Semiahmoo Spit and Boundary Bay are ranked as Important Birding Areas by the Audubon Society. The Cains are the most notable family in Blaine's short history, credited with its founding and achievements. At one time owning most of present-day Blaine, the Cain brothers erected the biggest store north of Seattle, a lumber and shingle mill, a hotel (largest in the state at the time), the first public wharf, and donated large public tracts of land. Nathan Cornish and family moved to Blaine in 1889. He became mayor in 1901; his platform was \\"twelve miles of wooden sidewalk\\". His daughter, Nellie Cornish, having failed to open a successful piano teaching business in Blaine, moved to Seattle, where she founded the Cornish College of the Arts in 1914, which still exists today. During the formative years of her career in the 1950s, country singer Loretta Lynn was often a featured star at Bill's Tavern on Peace Portal Drive in Blaine. William Hafstrom owned the tavern; it no longer exists. Lynn was then living on Loomis Trail Road near Custer, Washington. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Blaine's motto is \\"Where America Begins\\": the community is also known as \\"The Gateway to the Pacific Northwest\\", and the \\"Peace Arch City\\". All these phrases are commentaries on Blaine's unique locale. It lies at the northernmost point of the north-south U.S. Interstate 5 and next to Drayton Harbor and Boundary Bay (the southward extension of Boundary Bay is officially named and often referred to as Semiahmoo Bay). Blaine had a small airport, which was popular with light aircraft owners for its low fuel prices and because it had less fog than other nearby airports. The runway measured 2539 √ó 40 feet (774 √ó 12 m). The Blaine city government operated automated fuel pumps. In the spring of 2006 the city government removed several tall trees south of the runway as a safety precaution. Then in 2007, the City Council voted to close the airport before the end of 2008. The airport was officially closed on December 31, 2008. The land upon which the airport rests is adjacent to a shopping center and light industrial park. The area is now zoned for mixed use development, including light industrial manufacturing and commercial. Climate Blaine lies between the mountains east of Vancouver, the flatlands of Skagit County, Washington, the North Cascades (including Mount Baker), and the south end of Vancouver Island. The coastal climate (Cfb) of the area provides fairly mild weather from the rest of the Pacific Northwest. With annual precipitation of about 1000 mm (40 inches) and its milder location, Blaine enjoys more sunny days and a milder climate than neighboring communities. Canada‚ÄìU.S. border Blaine is home to two main West Coast ports of entry between the United States and Canada. The Peace Arch Border Crossing, which is the northern terminus of I-5 and southern terminus of B.C. provincial Highway 99, serves as the primary passenger vehicle port of entry. The Pacific Highway Border Crossing, approximately one mile to the east, serves as the primary point of entry for heavy truck traffic, and thus is also known as the Truck Crossing. The latter is reached via Washington State Route 543 which departs I-5 on the south side of Blaine and connects at the border to B.C.'s Highway 15 (Surrey's 176th Street) and then to the Trans- Canada Highway. Construction of a new Land Port of Entry (LPOE) was completed by the U.S. General Services Administration in 2011. Peace Arch Project News GSA page retrieved July 5, 2010 A large public art installation entitled \\"Non- Sign II\\" was erected near the crossing booths. The art piece is a \\"blank space\\" in the shape of a billboard sign, surrounded by a mass of twisted metal rods.Ghost Billboard Erected on US-Canada Border. Wired.com, October 22, 2010. On the Canadian side, a new Port of Entry building was constructed by the Canada Border Services Agency. It was officially opened by Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan on August 20, 2009. CBSA news release Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan opens Douglas border crossing facility retrieved July 5, 2010 It was built partly to reduce delays for travelers coming to the 2010 Winter Olympics which were held in Vancouver and Whistler February 12‚Äì28, 2010. VANOC site Ceremonies page retrieved July 5, 2010 International border intrigue has always been a part of Blaine's ambiance. Smuggling became an underground industry in 1919 with the passage of the Volstead Act banning liquor sale and use in the United States. Rum-running and border jumping thrived along Blaine's shared coastline with British Columbia, due in part to the area's largest whiskey still being located on Texada Island, which is located in the northern Strait of Georgia offshore from the city of Powell River, British Columbia. This continued until Prohibition was repealed in 1933 (coincidentally, the US Congressional law which re-legalized alcohol is named the Blaine Act). In subsequent decades, the situation was reversed due to restrictive drinking and entertainment laws in British Columbia, notably a ban on Sunday drinking, which led to Blaine and its sister border towns of Point Roberts and Sumas booming with taverns and adult entertainment of various kinds. Those days are long gone and now Blaine's retail sector booms for goods such as gasoline, dairy products and clothing outlets, as these goods are cheaper in the U.S. The Peace Arch is a monument on the Canada‚ÄìUS border, where I-5 becomes Hwy 99 and enters British Columbia. In the 1990s, smuggling again reached a zenith with exports of high grade marijuana from neighboring British Columbia, and corresponding flow of cocaine and handguns from the United States into Canada. As the production of 'BC Bud' grew across BC, a sometimes dangerous game of cat and mouse played out along Blaine's border with Canada. Smugglers used every technique, from backpacks to helicopter aerial drops to bring tons of the marijuana crop into the US, while a growing phalanx of local, state, provincial and federal law enforcement from both sides of the border sought ways to stem the tide. Following the terrorist attacks of 2001, the addition of hundreds of federal agents and millions of dollars in enforcement technology have pushed much of the smuggling activity into the rugged interior of Washington. With its location at the intersection of an international border, a major interstate freeway, and the Pacific Ocean, Blaine is frequently in the news. The International Peace Arch, dedicated September 6, 1921 by founder Samuel Hill, is located in Blaine in Peace Arch State Park and is occasionally used as a focal point for peaceful demonstrations and debate, such as the annual setting of crosses for each American killed so far in the Iraq War. But most of the people who visit or pass by the Park each year remember it for its beauty and peaceful shoreline setting (although the beach is not officially accessible from the park). The Interstate 5 freeway extends from the U.S./Mexico border at San Diego, northward to Canada, and terminates in Blaine at the city's northern border. The country's only pedestrian crosswalk to cross an Interstate freeway exists in Peace Arch State Park, the Washington portion of the binational Peace Arch Park. The Canadian side of the park, designated as Peace Arch Provincial Park, is in Douglas, the Canadian port-of-entry and part of the city of Surrey, British Columbia. The Peace Arch monument, located in the Park, symbolizes lasting peace and amity between the U.S. and Canada. One innovative feature that has never been abrogated even during the days since 9/11 is that people entering the Park from either side may have the unique experience of strolling to the opposite park's boundary amid flowers, ponds, and works of art, without having to go through Immigration, thus truly making the Park a place of bi- national mingling. Frequently, wedding ceremonies are performed in the Park. In 2006, a local group called the Blaine Peace Alliance unsuccessfully solicited City Council support to formalize a sister-city relationship with Pugwash, Nova Scotia, where promotion of world peace had been an ongoing effort for 50 years. Because Pugwash affiliated itself with the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, the Council ruled such a connection would be \\"political\\". Shortly thereafter, the Alliance disbanded. Since 1937, an annual celebration known as \\"Hands Across the Border\\" has been held at the Park, sponsored by the International Peace Arch Association. Hundreds of Scouts from the U.S. and Canada are in attendance and the highways and Ports of Entry on both sides of the border are closed for several hours for the event. There is a procession of Troops and world flags through the Peace Arch, signifying Scout unity around the world. Speeches are made by honored Scouts from Washington and British Columbia, and State, Provincial and local dignitaries attend. On February 28, 2013, after 90 years, the event's former organizers announced that \\"Hands Across the Border\\" had been cancelled. However, following public support the annual program was re-established in 2015. Demographics The city's population has been exaggerated at times: \\"Population now 1,735 as against peak of 14,000 in the 1920s\\", declared the December 27, 1964 issue of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 2010 census As of the census of 2010, there were 4,684 people, 1,994 households, and 1,291 families residing in the city.

Economy Much of Blaine's economy is based on cross-border Canadian trade. The eastern side of the city accommodates a number of import/export warehouses, freight and courier services and gas stations serving long-haul cargo trucks. The Customs and Border Protection branch of the Department of Homeland Security operates two border inspection stations in Blaine. The Blaine Sector Headquarters of the US Border Patrol employs hundreds of federal law enforcement officers and support staff in the community. Blaine also has a number of manufacturing companies, including Nature's Path cereal and Totally Chocolate. The Port of Bellingham operates a large marina in Blaine, serving a variety of pleasure craft and fishing vessels. As Vancouver, B.C. is just north of Blaine, across the US-Canada border and where several prime-time television series are recorded, several dozen US actors/actresses have rented houses in Blaine and commute to Vancouver rather than rent houses and apartments in Vancouver, which is much more expensive. Included series are: Once Upon A Time, Beauty and the Beast, Supernatural and Nikita. For similar reasons, a significant number of Americans who work for companies in Vancouver are living in Blaine. Several mail service companies have opened branches in Blaine, specifically targeting Canadian residents looking to avoid cross- border shipping costs. The local industry grew during the rise of e-commerce in the early 2000s and the city set up a sales tax that earns $1.7 million in annual revenue.

The population was 2,481 at the 2010 census. Everson and the nearby city of Nooksack lie near the foothills of the Cascade mountains in Northwest Washington. Located on the banks of the Nooksack River, the businesses support the surrounding farms and logging industries. The valley is heavily influenced by Dutch settlers who established dairy farms on the fertile flood prone land. Fruit orchards and berry fields also play an important part of the town's economy. The town's small business district provides all the basic services. There are restaurants, a pharmacy and groceries, auto-repair, and agricultural supply stores. The City Park is located a 1/2 block south off the W. Main St. and Riverside Park is on the banks of the Nooksack River featuring picnic tables and ball fields.

It is north of Bellingham and approximately south of the Canada‚ÄìUS border. The city was established in 1874 near the site of the Nooksack Indian village Squahalish (Nooksack: Sqweh√°lich). The city is located along the Nooksack River and State Route 539. The population of Lynden is about 14,259 according to the United States Census Bureau. Lynden is also home to the Northwest Washington Fair. History Lynden was begun in 1871 and established in 1874 by Holden and Phoebe Judson near the site of the Nooksack Indian village Squahalish (Nooksack: Sqweh√°lich). It was named by Phoebe Judson after the riverside town in Hohenlinden, a poem by Thomas Campbell. According to her book, A Pioneer's Search for an Ideal Home, she changed the spelling of \\"Linden\\" to be more visually appealing. Lynden was officially incorporated as a city on March 16, 1891. The city lies in a broad valley formed by the Nooksack River, which empties into nearby Bellingham Bay. The surrounding area is filled with dairy, raspberry, strawberry, and blueberry farms. The region saw significant Dutch immigration in the early and mid 1900s, spurring the growth of dairies. The city pays homage to its Dutch heritage through the design of buildings on Front Street and local businesses with \\"Dutch\\" names and products. In the early 21st century, the population has nearly doubled in size, with Dutch being more predominate than other ethnic ancestry. In 2005, the drug smuggling tunnel was discovered in Lynden, built by a band of Canadian smugglers in the basement of a residence north of Lynden along the Canada‚ÄìUS border.

At one time, Lynden claimed to hold the world record for most churches per square mile and per capita, although that is unsubstantiated. Due to the town's large population of those who attend or are members of Lynden's many churches, the town has had a long tradition of most businesses closing on Sunday. In recent years, businesses have started to open on Sundays, as in other communities, but the area remains mostly unchanged.

Sudden Valley is the second-largest homeowner association in western Washington, with over 7,000 residents. There are eleven neighborhood parks, miles of hiking trails in woodlands and along Lake Whatcom, beaches, two pools, sports fields, tennis courts, a basketball court, a recreation center with full gym, an 18-hole golf course, a library, a marina and more. Based on per capita income, one of the more reliable measures of affluence, Sudden Valley ranks 97th of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked. History The Community Association of Sudden Valley began as ‚Äúthe Ranch‚Äù. The original owner of the area was Banning Austin. In 1949, Austin sold the land to Glen and Betty Corning, who named it ‚Äúthe Ranch‚Äù and lived there with their children until in 1968 they sold 1,200 acres of property for 1.8 million. The new owner was Ken Sanwick of Sudden Valley Inc. Sanwick envisioned the land as ‚ÄúSudden Valley Undevelopment‚Äù and wanted to preserve the natural surroundings while still incorporating homes into the wilderness. By 1969, the County Commissioners approved the first plat for 158 lots west of Lake Whatcom Boulevard. The first property owner was Mae Schatz, who bought Division 1 Lot 112 in May 1969. In the 70‚Äôs, the Valley changed ownership a few times. SunMark Inc. bought out the Sanwick Corporation in 1973, and in 1975 Continental Mortgage Investors took over from SunMark as the developer. This was short lived, as CMI declared bankruptcy not long after. In December 1976, ownership and control was transferred to the newly named Sudden Valley Community Association. The owner of SunMark, Roger Ufkes, who happened to be the son of the first property owner, formed the original Board of Directors for the new Community Association. Ufkes served on the Board for two years in the early 70‚Äôs and is credited for urging property owners to buy the golf course and all its subsidiaries for 1.4 million. The one‚Äêtime assessment fee of $4,000 was voted on and passed by the residents. From this point on, the SVCA held the title to all the roads, parks, greenbelt, recreation facilities, marina, airstrip, and the country club. Sudden Valley was well on its way to becoming the community it is today. Sudden Valley is one of the most beautiful places in the Northwest that was conceived in the late 60‚Äôs. Now, over 7,000 residents plus an abundance of wildlife call it home. Sudden Valley is proud of its community and offers activities for all ages and abilities, including a marina, library, parks, playgrounds, miles of hiking trails, and an 18‚Äêhole golf course designed by the renowned course architect Ted Robinson. The Community Center recreation area includes a state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêart fitness center and an outdoor Olympic swimming pool.

The population was 2,805 at the 2010 census. The population is estimated at 2,911 per the State of Washington Office of Financial Management in 2018 making Colfax the second largest city in Whitman County behind Pullman. It is situated amidst wheat-covered hills in a valley at the confluence of the north and south forks of the Palouse River. U.S. Route 195, which forms the town's main street, intersects with State Route 26 at the north end of town; in the past, Colfax also lay at the junction of three major railway lines. It was named after Schuyler Colfax, the vice president from 1869‚Äì73. History Palouse Indians were the first known human inhabitants of the Colfax area. White settlers arrived in the summer of 1870, and soon built a sawmill. A flour mill and other businesses followed, and Colfax soon grew into a prosperous town. Originally, pioneer citizen James Perkins called the settlement \\"Belleville\\" in honor of his girlfriend; when he found a new love, he changed the town's name to Colfax,LaFollette, Taber, The History of Colfax, Colfax History Committee, 1956, p. 8. for vice president Schuyler Colfax. Colfax was officially incorporated on November 29, 1873. In 1889-90, the town vied with several other finalists to become the site of a new state agricultural college, present-day Washington State University. The honor ultimately fell to nearby Pullman, southeast. The early history of Colfax was marred by prominent lynchings in 1894 and 1898. The city incurred significant flooding in 1910 in early March. Until passed by Pullman at the 1930 census, Colfax was the largest city in the county. Geography and climate Colfax is located in southeastern Washington at (46.884033, -117.363668), at an elevation of . The nearest cities are Spokane, Pullman, Moscow, and Lewiston/Clarkston. The area is geologically interesting, lying in the midst of the fertile Palouse country in the middle of the Columbia River Plateau, with the Rocky Mountains to the east, the Channeled Scablands to the west, and the Snake River to the south. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. The Palouse River, confined for flood control to a concrete bed that reduces it to an eighteen-inch-wide stream during the dry season, runs through the middle of town, parallel to Main Street. Colfax has a four-season continental climate (K√∂ppen Dsb), with hot, dry summers, cold winters, and a rainy season that generally runs from autumn til spring. The annual rainfall averages less than a year. This climate, together with the deep, rich palouse topsoil, makes for near-ideal wheat growing conditions. Culture The Codger Pole Tourist attractions * The Codger Pole is a chainsaw-carved monument by master carver Jonathan LaBenne. It is located on Main Street and commemorates a 1988 rematch, 50 years after the original 1938 game, between archrival football teams from Colfax High School and St. John. At tall, it is the largest sculpture of its type in the world, and consists of portraits, carved into five upended red cedar logs, of the 51 players involved. The players are shown in old age but are wearing the football uniforms of the thirties. The Codger Pole was recently renovated as of May 2016. It is located at the intersection of Main and Rock Streets. * Downtown Colfax Downtown Colfax is a National Register Historic District consisting of a rich collection of historic architecture ranging from the 1890s to the 1930s. The Downtown District boundaries are Upton Street to the north, Stevens Street to the south, Mill Street to the east, and the Palouse River to the west. * Former St. Ignatius Hospital The Former St. Ignatius Hospital (1009 S. Mill Street) which dates from 1892 is perched on the south hill at the very south end of Mill Street. This location served as a hospital for central and northern Whitman County from 1892 to 1968. When the hospital was relocated up the hill a nursing facility was located on the lower floors from 1968 to 2002. The property has been abandoned since 2002 after a water main broke on the upper floors in winter. The Colfax Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Association held ghost tours at the facility during October and December 2015. The site is currently closed to the public and owned by Anthony Girges. * The Perkins House, on Perkins Avenue, is a meticulously restored Victorian home built in 1886. The original owner was James Perkins, a leading pioneer citizen. The Perkins family occupied the home until 1968, by which time it was sadly dilapidated and slated for demolition. In 1970, the Whitman County Historical Society assumed ownership and began restoring the house, which is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Behind the house is a log cabin, built in 1870, where Perkins lived for sixteen years. This cabin is the oldest standing structure in Whitman County. The house is open for tours from May to September, on Thursdays and Saturdays. The house is now home of the Colfax Chamber of Commerce and Colfax Downtown Association and is open from 8 AM to 5 PM Monday thru Friday and Saturdays.

Novodevichy Cemetery () is a famous cemetery in Moscow. It lies next to the southern wall of the 16th-century Novodevichy Convent, which is the city's third most popular tourist site.  History  The cemetery was designed by Ivan Mashkov and inaugurated in 1898. Its importance dates from the 1930s, when the necropolises of the medieval Muscovite monasteries (Simonov, Danilov, Donskoy) were scheduled for demolition. Only the Donskoy survived the Joseph Stalin era relatively intact. The remains of many famous Russians buried in other abbeys, such as Nikolai Gogol and Sergey Aksakov, were disinterred and reburied at the Novodevichy. A 19th-century necropolis within the walls of the Novodevichy convent, which contained the graves of about 2000 Russian noblemen and university professors, also underwent reconstruction. The vast majority of graves were destroyed. It was at that time that the remains of Anton Chekhov were moved outside the monastery walls. His grave served as the kernel of the so-called \\"cherry orchard\\" ‚Äì a section of the cemetery which contains the graves of Constantin Stanislavski and the leading actors of his company.  Interments  During the Soviet Union, burial in the Novodevichy Cemetery was second in prestige only to burial in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Among the Soviet leaders, only Nikita Khrushchev was buried at the Novodevichy rather than at the Red Square. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Kremlin Wall is no longer used for burials and the Novodevichy Cemetery is used for only the most symbolically significant burials. For example, in April 2007, within one week both the first President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin and world-renowned cellist Mstislav Rostropovich were buried there. Today, the cemetery holds the tombs of Russian authors, musicians, playwrights, and poets, as well as famous actors, political leaders, and scientists. More than 27,000 are buried at Novodevichy. There is scant space for more burials. A new national cemetery is under construction in Mytishchi north of Moscow. The cemetery has a park-like ambience, dotted with small chapels and large sculpted monuments. It is divided into the old (Divisions 1‚Äì4), new (Divisions 5‚Äì8) and newest (Divisions 9‚Äì11) sections; maps are available at the cemetery office.

The population was 70 at the 2010 census. History Lamont was officially incorporated on October 22, 1910. The town was named for former vice president of the Northern Pacific Railway, Daniel Lamont. Lamont was initially founded as a terminal of the Spokane Portland & Seattle Railway, a joint venture of the Jim Hill controlled railroads, Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railways. Lamont is on the Pasco-Spokane extension of the SP&S.; The terminal included a depot, yard, 22 stall roundhouse and locomotive servicing facilities. These facilities included water and oil tanks for SP&S; steam locomotives, and a 6 pocket coal dock for Northern Pacific Rwy steam locomotives. Crews from Spokane and Pasco would work to Lamont and lay over before working back home again. But the railroad shortly reconsidered the remote outpost of Lamont as a terminal, and when the roundhouse burned in 1913, crews started working through between Pasco and Spokane. Trains still stopped at Lamont for fuel and water. In fact in the midst of the World War II, a steel coal dock from the Great Northern in Montana was moved to Lamont to replace the aging wooden dock in 1944. Steam locomotives last passed through Lamont on June 22, 1956, with diesel-electric locomotives hauling the trains thereafter. Fueling facilities for the diesel locomotives had been constructed at Lamont after WWII, but were abandoned in 1957 when they began to fuel in Pasco. Lamont contributed a healthy amount of traffic to the railroad in the form of grain and livestock over the years. The grain elevators still stand as a landmark in town. In 1970 the \\"Hill Lines\\"; Great Northern Railway, Northern Pacific Railway, Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway, and the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway all merged to form the Burlington Northern Railroad. After the merger, the SP&S; and NP lines between Pasco and Spokane were used like double track, with heavy lumber traffic running east over the easier grades of the former SP&S; and westbound traffic on the former NP. But as export grain business began to surge in the late 1970s, the direction was flipped and the heavy grain trains began running west over the former SP&S; through Lamont. Following the bad recession of the early 1980s, BN began to look at ways to reduce the amount of its track in Washington State. The former SP&S; line didn't have much online business, and had issues with rockfall on the south end and flooding on the north end. In the mid 1980s, BN upgraded the former NP between Spokane and Pasco and moved all the through trains off the former SP&S; in 1987. In 1991 the track was removed and the State of Washington obtained the former railroad line as a trail. Some remains of the roundhouse and service facilities still remain.Spokane Portland & Seattle Rwy by Ed Austin and Tom Dill Geography Lamont is located at (47.200456, -117.904513).

The population was 29,799 at the 2010 census, and estimated to be 34,506 in 2019. Originally founded as Three Forks, the city was renamed after industrialist George Pullman in 1884. Pullman is noted as a vastly fertile agricultural area known for its many miles of rolling hills and the production of wheat and legumes. It is home to Washington State University, a public research land- grant university, and the international headquarters of Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. Pullman is from Moscow, Idaho, home to the University of Idaho, and is served by the Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport. History In 1876, about five years after European-American settlers established Whitman County on November 29, 1871, Bolin Farr arrived in Pullman. He camped at the confluence of Dry Flat Creek and Missouri Flat Creek on the bank of the Palouse River. Within the year, Dan McKenzie and William Ellsworth arrived to stake claims for adjoining land. They named the first post office here as Three Forks. In the spring of 1881, Orville Stewart opened a general store and Bolin Farr platted about of his land for a town. Pullman was incorporated on April 11, 1888 with a population of about 250-300 people. It was originally named Three Forks, after the three small rivers that converge there: Missouri Flat Creek, Dry Fork, and the South Fork of the Palouse River. In 1884, Dan McKenzie and Charles Moore (of Moscow) replatted the site and named it for American industrialist George Pullman. On March 28, 1890, the Washington State Legislature established the state's land grant college, but did not designate a location. Pullman leaders were determined to secure the new college and offered of land for its campus. Idaho Territory had established its land grant college in 1889; the University of Idaho was to be in neighboring Moscow. On April 18, 1891, the site selection commission appointed by Washington's governor chose Pullman. On January 13, 1892, the institution opened with 59 students under the name Washington Agricultural College and School of Science. It was renamed the State College of Washington in 1905, more commonly known as \\"Washington State College,\\" and became Washington State University in 1959. In 1961, Pullman became a non-chartered code city under the mayor‚Äìcouncil form of government. The city has an elected mayor with an elected seven-member council and an appointed administrative officer, the city administrator. Geography The hilly terrain of the Palouse, which surrounds Pullman According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Pullman has a total area of , all of it land. The city is in the eastern part of Whitman County in southeastern Washington, approximately south of Spokane and north of Lewiston, Idaho. The city is situated across several loess hills which characterize the Palouse Prairie, formed from windblown sediment over an estimated period of over one million years.Busacca, A.J., 1989. Long Quaternary record in eastern Washington, U.S.A., interpreted from multiple buried paleosols in loess. Geoderma. 45:105-122. This prairie region, the Palouse, is noteworthy for its fertile rolling hills where winter and spring wheat, barley, lentils, and peas are grown. These hills provide a variety of elevations across the city, from 2342 to 2575 ft (714 to 785 m) above sea level. Downtown Pullman is situated in a valley between these hills. Within the Pullman city limits, the Missouri Flat Creek and Paradise Creek both join the South Fork of the Palouse River. Pullman sits in the watersheds of the Snake River and the Columbia River. Pullman is situated across four major hills which divide the city into nearly equal quarters. These are: * Military Hill, north of the Palouse River and west of North Grand Avenue * Pioneer Hill, south of Main Street and the downtown area, and east of South Grand Avenue * Sunnyside Hill, south of Davis Way and west of South Grand Avenue * College Hill, north of Main Street and east of North Grand Avenue Military Hill is named for the Pullman Military College that opened its doors in 1891 and burned down in 1893. Climate Pullman's climate is classified as dry-summer humid continental (K√∂ppen Dsb), using the 0¬∞ threshold for mean coldest winter month; it nearly qualifies as having a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen Csb). This climate is typified by warm, dry summers followed by cold, snowy winters with short transitional seasons in between. Owing to the protective nature of the Cascade Range to its west, clear skies occur regularly throughout the year and rainfall is drastically less frequent in comparison to cities west of the mountains. Clouds of any variety are especially scant between June and September, which contributes to a diurnal temperature variation that is much higher during the summer compared to winter. Pullman has an annual average of of precipitation. The normal monthly mean temperature ranges from in December to in August. The lowest temperature recorded in Pullman is on December 30, 1968, while the highest is on August 4, 1961.

As of the 2010 census the population was 15,858. History Iconic barn in Sunnyside The Yakima Valley was originally inhabited by the Yakama people, who were relocated onto the Yakama Indian Reservation following the 1855 signing of a treaty with the federal government. The modern settlement of Sunnyside was founded by Walter Granger in 1893. The name \\"Sunnyside\\" was coined by a merchant named W. H. Cline. Granger was involved in the financing and construction of the Sunnyside Canal which would allow Yakima River water to irrigate the area. However, due to the Panic of 1893, Granger's creditors foreclosed on the canal, and the town's population dwindled to seven families. However, by the end of 1901, the population had doubled, finally exceeding 300 people. The townsite contained \\"1 bank, 11 stores, 3 hotels, 1 newspaper, 2 blacksmith shops, 2 livery barns, 3 churches, and a large and growing school.\\" On September 16, 1902, residents voted 42‚Äì1 to incorporate as the town of Sunnyside. At the time, the town had 314 residents, just over the state minimum for an incorporation referendum. The first mayor of Sunnyside was the town druggist James Henderson. Sunnyside's population increase at this time was stimulated by the immigration of the Dunkards from South Dakota who were moving to the town. The population of Dunkards was of such notable size that by 1902 it was noted that they had \\"built a commodious place of worship at Sunnyside\\" which was the largest church in Yakima County at the time. The Dunkards, members of the German Baptist Progressive Brethren, relocated to Sunnyside in order to form what they called the Christian Cooperative Colony. The Brethren bought the entire town site and were the developers of its first bank, and a telephone system. They enforced clauses prohibiting alcohol, dancing, and gambling as a condition on every parcel of land sold. Because of this, old maps of Washington identify the town with a cross or halo symbol. Later, in the 1930s, refugees from the Dust Bowl also moved to Sunnyside. Under the leadership of mayor William Bright \\"Billy\\" Cloud (1870‚Äì1959), Sunnyside initiated a project to pave its dirt streets on June 5, 1917. This project was necessary since years of irrigation had raised the water table to the point that the streets had become unbearably muddy. The cost of the entire project was $62,629.45. In 1948, Sunnyside became the first city in the state to adopt a council‚Äìmanager system of government. The system provides for an elected city council which is responsible for policy making, and a professional city manager, appointed by the council, who is responsible for administration. The city manager provides policy advice, directs the daily operations of city government, handles personnel functions (including the power to appoint and remove employees) and is responsible for preparing the city budget. Under the council-manager statutes, the city council is prohibited from interfering with the manager's administration. The city manager; however, is directly accountable to and can be removed by a majority vote of the council at any time. Sunnyside was named an All-America City in 1979. Geography Sunnyside is located at (46.320798, ‚àí120.012232). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Sunnyside Historical Museum Located downtown, the museum houses and displays artifacts and documents with a focus on daily life in Sunnyside during its early years. The building housing the museum was donated to the city by Robert and Martha McIntosh, who had purchased the business from the family of Walter C. Ball & Sons, the local undertaking business. Both were also among the pioneering families that founded Sunnyside. The Sunnyside Memorial Cemetery, founded by the Ball Family, is located north of town. The lone structure at that location was designed by Percy Ball to resemble Chingford Church in Walthamstow, England where Walter C. Ball and his wife Amelia grew up together. This building was used to house the retort for cremations until it fell into disrepair. The family plots of the Ball family are located on the east side of the structure.Family genealogical records of Donald Malidore Schools Many of the original school buildings in Sunnyside, and the town of Outlook just northwest of town, have either burned to the ground or been demolished to make way for bigger and better structures. One of the original structures still in use is the Lincoln School Building which sits at the intersection of Lincoln and Sixth Street. Erected in 1927, it is a two-storey structure with an adjacent gymnasium attached to the east wing of the building. In 1928, female teachers were not allowed to marry. Doing so would void their contract to teach.Sunnyside Museum and Historical Association, Chamber of Commerce Archives 1926‚Äì1928 The land that Lincoln School sits on was donated to the school district by H. Lloyd Miller in 1926. He and his wife later donated the land next to it between the school and 9th Ave. to be used for play fields for the students. Lincoln still remains as one of the oldest buildings in the school district. It has been remodeled and renovated to accommodate the administrative offices for the district. Sunnyside High School was named a School of Distinction in 2015 and 2016. According to ESD105, \\"The Schools of Distinction Award goes to the top 5 percent of Washington schools that have attained the most outstanding levels of sustained improvement in English language arts, math, and graduation rates among their students over the past five years.\\" Libraries Sunnyside has one public library.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 8,949. It is located within the Yakama Indian Reservation, established in 1855. Toppenish calls itself the Town of Murals, as it has more than 75 murals adorning its buildings. The first, \\"Clearing the Land\\", was painted in 1989, and the city hosts horse-drawn tours and annual art events. All historically accurately depict scenes of the region from 1840 to 1940. History All territory set aside for the Yakama Reservation by the Treaty of 1855 was held communally in the name of the tribe. None of the land was individually owned. The treaty of 1855, between the United States government, representatives from thirteen other bands, tribes, and Chief Kamiakin, resulted in the Yakama Nation relinquishing of their homeland. Prior to their ceding the land, only Native Americans had lived in the area. For a time they were not much disturbed, but the railroad was constructed into the area in 1883. More white settlers migrated into the region, looking for farming land, and joined the ranchers in older settlements bordering the Columbia River. The General Allotment Act of 1887 (known as the Dawes Act) was part of federal legislation designed to force assimilation to European-American ways by Native Americans. Specifically, it was designed to break up the communal tribal land of Native American reservations and allot portions to individual households of tribal members, in order to encourage subsistence farming in the European-American style and familiarity with western conceptions of property. Lands declared excess by the government to this allotment were available for sale to anyone, and European Americans had been demanding more land in the West for years. Under varying conditions, Native American landowners were to be allowed to sell their plots. Josephine Bowser Lillie was among Native Americans granted an allotment of land within the Yakama Reservation. Of mixed Native American/European ancestry and Yakama identification, she is known as \\"The Mother of Toppenish.\\" She platted the north of her land. These tracts became the first deeded land to be sold on the Yakama Nation Reservation. T·∫ã√°pni≈° in the Sahaptin language of the Yakama. This is the likely source of the name Toppenish. The word means ‚Äòprotruded, stuck out‚Äô and recalls a landslide that occurred on the ridge south of White Swan, Washington.Beavert, Virginia and Hargus, Sharon.

OCLC 268797329 According to William Bright, the name \\"Toppenish\\" comes from the Sahaptin word /tx√°pni≈°/, referring to a landslide, from /tx√°-/, \\"accidentally\\", /-pni-/, \\"to launch, to take forth and out\\", and /-≈°a/, \\"continuative present tense\\". Another theory suggests the name may come from Thap-pahn-ish meaning \\"People of the trail which comes from the foot of the hills\\" or from Qapuishlema which means \\"People from the foot of the hills.\\" Or it was derived from the name of a Lower Yakama band along the Toppenish Creek, which was called Th√°pnƒ≠≈õ-ƒßlama. The city lies inside the boundaries of the Yakama Nation's Reservation. Toppenish was officially incorporated on April 29, 1907, and founded by Johnny Barnes. Early development A driving figure in Toppenish's early development was William Leslie Shearer (October 31, 1862 ‚Äì June 5, 1922). Since Toppenish had no church in 1897 Shearer obtained permission from the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and offered the freight room for religious services. Following this, he helped organize the first Methodist Church and, as trustee, was instrumental in the construction of a building that would house the church and also serve as school classrooms until a separate schoolhouse could be built. The building was completed in time for the 1898-1899 school term. After leaving the employment of the railroad, Shearer, with Frank J. Lemon as his partner, opened Toppenish's first drugstore in 1905. About a year later, Shearer sold out, turning his attention to the newly organized Yakima Produce and Trading company, with George Plank, A.W. McDonald and M. McDonald as partners. The company bought some acreage and leased more sagebrush land to develop the 1700-acre ranch near Satus Station. Shearer had a system of irrigation ditches constructed leading from Satus Creek to the acreage. Geography Toppenish is located at (46.378880, -120.311823).

The population was 4,997 at the 2010 census. History=Origins The town was founded in 1885 by Indian Postmaster Alexander McCredy as a railroad stop on the Northern Pacific Railroad as Simcoe, Washington. The Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 made it legal for the Yakama Indian Nation to sell their lands, and began to draw settlers into the area. With the construction of the Irwin Canal in 1896, agriculture became the big business in town. In the early 1900s, McCredy and George Rankin established the Wapato Development Company and laid out the town site. They established the town's first bank and began selling lots. In response to persistent confusion with nearby Fort Simcoe, the town changed its name to Wapato in 1903. The 1906 Jones Act further encouraged Anglos to purchase land from the Yakamas. Wapato was officially incorporated on September 16, 1908 with a population of around 300 people. Japanese immigrants As early as 1905, many Japanese people also began to migrate to the city, mainly from Hawaii. From 1916 to 1918, \\"Japanese Town\\" developed along present-day West 2nd Street. With more than 1000 Japanese then living in the Yakima Valley, the community soon became a center of Washington's Japanese population, second only to Seattle. The Yakima Buddhist Bussei Kaikan (1936‚Äì1941), on West 2nd Street, was an architecturally noteworthy building built by members of the congregation. Unfortunately it was not to last, as Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066 forced the Japanese to evacuate from Wapato in 1942, when many residents were sent to internment camps. World War II During World War II, much of the labor in the orchards and fields around Wapato came from either Germans held in a POW camp between Wapato and Toppenish, or from Japanese still being held in internment camps. At the end of the war, a labor shortage created a void readily filled by Hispanic migrant workers, and the Bracero Program (a guest-worker program agreed to by the US and Mexico during World War II). These events significantly changed Wapato's cultural history. Post war through today Through the 1970s and into 1990, Wapato produced some of the largest volume potato and apple crops, as tonnage per acre. Today, Wapato boasts one of the most Hispanic populations in Washington State (76% in the 2000 census). In recent times both Anglo and Hispanic residents have described Wapato as a \\"Mexican Town\\". In 2012, Wapato allowed strip clubs into the city, in the words of one resident, \\"to put Wapato on the map.\\" Geography Wapato is located at (46.445521, -120.421822).

The population was 1,921 as of the 2010 census. History Belington was founded in 1766-70. Originally it was known as the Barker Settlement, after Elias Barker, who had settled there with his brother William Barker. About 1785, it was called Yeagers, taking its name from a settler, George Yeager, and his sons. In 1855, it took its current name, Belington, from John Bealin, who had opened up a store there, and who would later move to Kansas. After the June 3, 1861 Battle of Philippi, site of the first land battle of the Civil War, the Confederate forces, having been routed by the Union Army in Philippi, retreated south. The Confederates made camp near the Laurel Mountain Road, today, a winding single lane dirt road that crosses the mountain and connects Belington with Elkins. In 1891, the West Virginia Central and Pittsburg Railway (later the Western Maryland Railway) was built into Belington. In 1894 the land on the east side of the river was incorporated as Belington, while the west side was incorporated as Alston in 1897. The two towns merged in 1906 to form the present Belington.

History The Hedgesville area was originally settled by William Snodgrass, who arrived in the American colonies in 1700. William Snodgrass is buried in the cemetery of Tuscarora Presbyterian Church in Berkeley County, West Virginia. Officially established by an act of the Virginia General Assembly on February 11, 1836, the Town of Hedgesville was laid out in 1832 along the old Warm Springs Road (now West Virginia Route 9) and named for the prominent local Hedges family. In 1854, Hedgesville was officially incorporated by the General Assembly. The act of incorporation provided for a town council consisting of seven trustees, but the act was amended in 1858 so that a mayor could be added to the council. Hedgesville is a National Register Historic District. Prior to that, in the 18th Century, it was home to the Tuscarora people. On August 17, 2004, President George W.

The population was 2,954 at the 2010 census. It is located on U.S. Route 11. History In the late 1880s, coinciding with the arrival of the Cumberland Valley Railroad (CVRR) extension, a resort that became known as Inwood Park was established on the property of the Strong family of south Berkeley County, West Virginia. On May 5, 1890, the Inwood Post Office opened and the village grew around the Park. From 1892 - 1913, an annual event called the Inwood Fair was held at the Park. This event drew in the range of 7,000 - 12,000 people. The Cumberland Valley Railroad station in Inwood also included a grain elevator, which ensured that much of the local agricultural products would be brought to Inwood to be shipped elsewhere. Other products shipped from Inwood via the CVRR were wood products, such as bark (for tanning) and railroad ties from the area west of the town. The station at Inwood was one of the most profitable stations on the CVRR line. The town of Inwood was originally called Gerrard. There are two stories as to how the town got its name. One story is that it was named for the Park located there - Inwood Park, the park \\"in the woods\\" - therefore INWOOD park. The other story is that Inwood's name was changed when Jonathan Newton Thatcher, of Gerrard, wanted to open a post office in the town. Washington D.C. post authorities told Thatcher that he would have to rename the town of Gerrard, since it would conflict with mail going to Gerrardstown, a town 4 miles west. When Thatcher's cousin from Inwood, California, showed him a letter with his home address on it, he decided to use the name ‚ÄúInwood‚Äù for the town. He wrote to Washington D.C. to get the town's name changed from Gerrard to Inwood and to get a post office established there. Jonathan Thatcher was the first postmaster for the new Inwood, West Virginia. In the early years of the 20th century, a local prominent citizen and politician, Gray Silver, was instrumental in establishing a co-op among the area's many orchardists. The principal crop among those orchardists was apples, because they were less likely to be damaged during shipment and the fact that they could last for long periods of time when stored properly. Through federal funds and the influence of Gray Silver, a school where various aspects of growing apples was established at Inwood. Gray Silver was also instrumental in putting together a group of investors to bring a commercial apple plant to Inwood. In 1920, the C.H. Musselman Company of Biglerville, Pennsylvania, opened an apple processing plant at Inwood. This was convenient to the many apple orchards of the Shenandoah Valley and the former Cumberland Valley Railroad, by this time part of the Pennsylvania Railroad line. By the late 1920s, the Musselman plant in Inwood exclusively produced apple sauce, the first apple processing plant of its kind.Berkeley Journal issue #33, Berkeley County Historical Society, 2007, written by Don Silvius Geography Inwood is located at (39.353438, -78.048811).

Companies and schools Inwood is home to Knouse Foods Musselman plant. The plant opened in 1920 after it was located there due to the active pursuance of local investors who contributed money to buy the property where the plant is located. It was part of the old Inwood Park. The C.H. Musselman Plant, in 1929, became the first apple processing plant to exclusively produce canned apple sauce. It can be said the apple sauce literally put the C.H. Musselman plant and the town of Inwood on the map. In the 1960s the Musselman company became a part of PET, Inc., and after a series of changes in ownership was bought by Knouse Foods in 1984, who continued who continued to operate the Inwood facility until November 14, 2008. Musselman High School, located in Inwood, was built in 1949 when the C.H. Musselman Company donated the land, materials and labor as a gift to the community. The high school first opened for the 1949-50 school year. Until the early 1980s, the Musselman Foundation, a philanthropic branch of the company, provided expansions and facilities the school needed whenever possible. The last contribution to the south Berkeley County community being the auditorium. When a new Musselman High School was built in the late 1990s, the original Musselman High School was torn down and Musselman Middle School was built on the same site. Inwood School, now Inwood Primary School, opened in 1926 and in 1970 became a primary school with the expansion of schools in southern Berkeley County. An earlier school was located west of present-day I-81 near Inwood, and can be seen on the Berkeley County map of 1894. In the early days of Inwood, there was a cooperage (barrel factory) in the village. East of Inwood, to this day, is a quarrying operation, taking advantage of the limestone below the ground for commercial purposes. Today, Inwood is a high growth area and serves as a bedroom community for the nearby Washington Metropolitan area. Fire Department Inwood is served by the South Berkeley Volunteer Fire Company, and the 167th airlift wing Fire/ Rescue. SBVFC is located at 7556 Winchester Avenue in Inwood.

Its population was 17,454 in the 2019 census estimate, making it the largest city in the Eastern Panhandle and the eighth- largest municipality in the state. Martinsburg is part of the Hagerstown- Martinsburg, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Martinsburg was established by an act of the Virginia General Assembly that was adopted in December 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. Founder Major General Adam Stephen named the gateway town to the Shenandoah Valley along Tuscarora Creek in honor of Colonel Thomas Bryan Martin, a nephew of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. Aspen Hall, a Georgian mansion, is the oldest house in the city. Part was built in 1745 by Edward Beeson, Sr. Aspen Hall and its wealthy residents had key roles in the agricultural, religious, transportation, and political history of the region. Significant events related to the French and Indian War; the Revolution, and the Civil War took place on the property. Three original buildings are still standing, including the rare blockhouse of Mendenhall's Fort. The first United States post office in what is now West Virginia was established at Martinsburg in 1792. At that time, Martinsburg and the larger territory were still part of Virginia. The Baltimore and Ohio's Martinsburg Shops three years before the Civil War The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) reached Martinsburg in 1842. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Martinsburg Shops were constructed in 1849 and rebuilt after the American Civil War. An engineer waves from a passing B&O; freight train in 1969. The B&O;'s shops employed many locals throughout its 130 years of operation. According to William Still, \\"The Father of the Underground Railroad\\" and its historian, Robert Brown, alias Thomas Jones, escaped from slavery in Martinsburg on Christmas night, 1856. He rode a horse and had it swim across the freezing Potomac River. After riding forty miles, he walked in cold wet clothes for two days, to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He received assistance there from the Underground Railroad and traveled by train to Philadelphia, and the office of William Still with the Pennsylvania Anti- Slavery Society. Brown's wife and four children had been sold; he sought help to find them. He had a likeness of his wife, and locks of hair from each of them. Civil war In 1854, ten-year-old Isabelle Boyd, known as \\"Belle\\" and later a noted spy for the Confederacy, moved to Martinsburg with her family; where her father Benjamin operated a general merchandise store. After the Civil War began, Benjamin joined the Second Virginia Infantry, which was part of the Stonewall Brigade. His wife Mary was thus in charge of the Boyd home when Union forces under General Robert Patterson took Martinsburg. When a group of Patterson's men tried to raise a Union flag over the Boyd home, Mary refused. One of the soldiers, Frederick Martin, threatened Mary, and Belle shot him. She was acquitted. She soon became involved in espionage, sending information to Confederate generals Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson and J.E.B. \\"Jeb\\" Stuart. Often she was helped by Eliza Corsey, a Boyd family slave whom Belle had taught to read and write. In 1863, Belle was arrested in Martinsburg by the Union Army and imprisoned. Boyd's Greek Revival home, which he had built in 1853 and sold in 1855, had numerous owners over the decades. In 1992 it was purchased by the Berkeley County Historical Society. The historical society renovated the building and now operates it as the Berkeley County Museum. It is also known as the Belle Boyd House. Reconstruction Residents of West Virginia were split in their allegiance during the war, with half of its soldiers serving in the Confederate army.Snell, Mark A., West Virginia and the Civil War, History Press, 2011, pg. 28, The vote to create a new state in western Virginia was very low, but statehood was approved by Congress and President Lincoln, and the new state was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863.Chapter Ten Statehood Referendum The city of Martinsburg was incorporated by an act of the new West Virginia Legislature on March 30, 1868. Martinsburg became a center of the railroad industry and its workers. The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 began July 14, 1877 in this city at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Martinsburg Shops. After several unsuccessful attempts to quell the protests, Governor Henry M. Mathews called for federal troops. By the time these troops had restored order, the protest of the rail company had spread across the country.Bellesiles, Michael A. (2010). \\"1877: America's Year for Living Violently.

History The town was originally created at the ends of two divisions of the Coal and Coke Railway, one originating in Charleston and the other originating in Elkins. Because of its central location, the area was an ideal place to build shops to facilitate the transition between the relatively flat Charleston division, which could operate with standard equipment, and the more hilly Elkins division of the Coal & Coke which required heavier engines. The town was laid out in 1904, and over the next decade, businesses and infrastructure such as hotels, a bank, stores, schools, a hospital, office buildings and churches appeared to serve the growing population.

The population was 994 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Braxton County. Sutton is situated at a center of transportation in West Virginia. Interstate 79, a major north‚Äìsouth route, connects with Appalachian Corridor L (U.S. Route 19), another significant north‚Äìsouth route, just a few miles south of town. History Sutton was settled in 1792 by Adam O'Brien, from Bath County, Virginia. In 1809, John D. Sutton settled at the confluence of Granny's Creek and the Elk River, at the edge of the present town. The village of Suttonville, formerly known as Newville, was laid out in 1835. When Braxton County was formed in 1836, the first court was held in the home of John D. Sutton. Sutton was a transportation hub. In addition to the navigable Elk River, the Weston and Gauley Bridge Turnpike connected the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike to the James River and Kanawha Turnpike, via Sutton. A suspension bridge was constructed on the Weston and Gauley Bridge Turnpike across the Elk River at Sutton in 1853. Railroads also served the town of Sutton, with the Sutton Branch connecting to the West Virginia and Pittsburgh Railroad at Flatwoods, West Virginia via McNutt (near the area now called Laurel Court), a path that would later be used by West Virginia State Route 4. Another branch that ran along the southeastern bank of the Elk River joined the Coal and Coke Railway six miles to the east at Gassaway. Due to its location, Sutton was embroiled in the American Civil War. On September 5, 1861, the town was occupied by 5,000 Union troops. Later in 1861, General William Rosecrans bivouacked 10,000 Union troops there, including future President William McKinley. On December 29, 1861, Confederate soldiers burned most of the downtown. Sutton slowly rebuilt but remained small until the local timber industry boomed. The town then became a commercial center, and many of the banks, hotels, shops, and other historic buildings in the Sutton Downtown Historic District date from this 1890‚Äì1920 period. After this, Sutton once again slowed in development. Sutton Dam was built on the Elk River upstream from the town in 1961, adding a tourism component to the local economy. The William Edgar Haymond House and Old Sutton High School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, along with the historic district. Geography Sutton is located at (38.664437, -80.710172), along the Elk River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The Sutton Lake project was authorized by Congress in the Flood Control Act of 1938. Construction began in October 1949, but was interrupted by the Korean War. Work restarted in 1956 and in the dam was finally completed in 1961. The Dam and lake provide opportunities for boating, picnicking, playgrounds, camping and pavilions available for rent. A handicap-access fishing area was also recently constructed at the Sutton Dam.

If these statements hold, the sequence is called a split exact sequence, and the sequence is said to split. In the above short exact sequence, where the sequence splits, it allows one to refine the first isomorphism theorem, which states that: : (i.e., isomorphic to the coimage of or cokernel of ) to: : where the first isomorphism theorem is then just the projection onto . It is a categorical generalization of the rank‚Äìnullity theorem (in the form in linear algebra. Proof for the category of abelian groups= and  First, to show that 3. implies both 1. and 2., we assume 3. and take as the natural projection of the direct sum onto , and take as the natural injection of into the direct sum.  To prove that 1. implies 3., first note that any member of B is in the set (). This follows since for all in , ; is obviously in , and is in , since : Next, the intersection of and is 0, since if there exists in such that , and , then ; and therefore, . This proves that is the direct sum of and . So, for all in , can be uniquely identified by some in , in , such that . By exactness . The subsequence implies that is onto; therefore for any in there exists some such that . Therefore, for any c in C, exists k in ker t such that c = r(k), and r(ker t) = C. If , then is in ; since the intersection of and , then . Therefore, the restriction of the morphism is an isomorphism; and is isomorphic to . Finally, is isomorphic to due to the exactness of ; so B is isomorphic to the direct sum of and , which proves (3).  To show that 2. implies 3., we follow a similar argument. Any member of is in the set ; since for all in , , which is in . The intersection of and is , since if and , then . By exactness, , and since is an injection, is isomorphic to , so is isomorphic to . Since is a bijection, is an injection, and thus is isomorphic to . So is again the direct sum of and . An alternative \\"abstract nonsense\\" proof of the splitting lemma may be formulated entirely in category theoretic terms. Non-abelian groups In the form stated here, the splitting lemma does not hold in the full category of groups, which is not an abelian category. Partially true It is partially true: if a short exact sequence of groups is left split or a direct sum (1. or 3.), then all of the conditions hold. For a direct sum this is clear, as one can inject from or project to the summands. For a left split sequence, the map gives an isomorphism, so is a direct sum (3.), and thus inverting the isomorphism and composing with the natural injection gives an injection splitting (2.). However, if a short exact sequence of groups is right split (2.), then it need not be left split or a direct sum (neither 1. nor 3. follows): the problem is that the image of the right splitting need not be normal. What is true in this case is that is a semidirect product, though not in general a direct product. Counterexample To form a counterexample, take the smallest non-abelian group , the symmetric group on three letters. Let denote the alternating subgroup, and let }. Let and denote the inclusion map and the sign map respectively, so that : 0 \\\\longrightarrow A \\\\stackrel{q}{\\\\longrightarrow} B \\\\stackrel{r}{\\\\longrightarrow} C \\\\longrightarrow 0 is a short exact sequence. 3. fails, because is not abelian. But 2. holds: we may define by mapping the generator to any two- cycle. Note for completeness that 1. fails: any map must map every two-cycle to the identity because the map has to be a group homomorphism, while the order of a two-cycle is 2 which can not be divided by the order of the elements in A other than the identity element, which is 3 as is the alternating subgroup of , or namely the cyclic group of order 3. But every permutation is a product of two-cycles, so is the trivial map, whence is the trivial map, not the identity. References * Saunders Mac Lane: Homology.

Commerce  Barboursville is home to the Huntington Mall, which is the largest indoor mall in the state of West Virginia, with more than 1.5 million square feet of retail space. The mall is anchored by Macy's, JCPenney, Sears, Books- A-Million, Field & Stream, TJMaxx, HomeGoods and Dicks Sporting Goods. Another busy retail area in Barboursville is the Merritt's Creek Farm Shopping Center just off I-64 Exit 18. The development contains a Target, Home Depot, Office Depot, Petco, Marshalls, Dress Barn, Starbucks, Massage Envy, O'Charleys, Orange Theory Fitness, Bellacinos, Game Stop, and numerous other smaller tenants. There have been two recently announced major retail developments for the Barboursville area. In 2015, Interstate Realty, of Bristol, TN, announced plans to construct a new retail development named Tanyard Station. The development will be built on a 52-acre site that was formerly a CSX rail yard along US Route 60. It is slated to be one of the largest retail developments ever built in Cabell County with over 400,000 square feet of planned retail space. It will be home to approximately 20 restaurants and retailers, including a grocery store, hotel, bank, gas station, and many others. Since its announcement, the development has been plagued by many delays and setbacks including an endangered bat species being found on the property. To accommodate the development, US Route 60 will be widened and intersection upgrades will be made and will include installation of several new traffic lights and signals. An official groundbreaking for the development was held on October 16, 2017 with the announcement of the first four tenants being Menards, ALDI, LongHorn Steakhouse, and Sheetz. Another major retail development known as The Crossing has also been announced to be constructed less than one mile from the Tanyard Station development just off the Big Ben Bowen Highway (WV Route 193). The development has been described as \\"upscale retail, restaurants, and lodging.\\" It was recently announced that the developer hoped to have Phase 1 of the project, which would contain approximately 16 tenants, open by the end of 2017.  Emergency services  Thanks to the tax base afforded by the Huntington Mall, the Village of Barboursville can afford a high degree of police protection. Fire services are provided by a volunteer fire department. Medical transport is provided by the county EMS. There are two hospitals in the nearby city of Huntington, St. Mary's Medical Center and Cabell-Huntington Hospital, both of which are Level 2 trauma centers and affiliated with the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine.  Education  Young people in Barboursville are educated by the schools of the Cabell County Board of Education. In 1994 the Board consolidated most of its schools into a few large facilities. Primary education is given at Village of Barboursville Elementary, which is a consolidation of Pea Ridge Elementary and Barboursville Elementary. Also Martha Elementary, on Martha Rd. Davis Creek Elementary is an additional school that is available to residents of Barboursville.{{cite webtitle=} This school can be found off Davis Creek Road and Alternate 10. High school students began attending Cabell Midland High School, a facility resulting from the consolidation of Barboursville High School and Milton High School, in the fall of 1994. Cabell Midland High School is in Ona, about five miles east of Barboursville. Technical and trade education for Barboursville public school students is administered by the Cabell County Career Technology Center in Huntington; the CCCTC offers courses in automotive mechanics, HVAC, welding, nursing, and information technology. Classes are also available to adults as college-level courses.

West Virginia Atlas & Gazetteer. Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme. . History West Union, West Virginia, 1899 The area was first settled in the late 1780s by James Caldwell, who owned of land that included present West Union. Caldwell sold this land to Nathan Davis, Jr (1772-1866) and his brothers about 1807. They in turn sold to Lewis Maxwell (1790-1862), a Virginia congressman. The settlement was originally called Lewisport,\\"County Seat of Doddridge was First Named Lewisport\\", Clarksburg Exponent, 14 April 1940. but Davis later supposedly suggested the name of \\"West Union\\", in deference to a proposed town of Union to be built on the eastern side of Middle Island Creek. (Union has disappeared, if it ever existed.) According to an early resident, A.A. Bee: \\"The first bridge across Middle Island Creek [at West Union] was of hewed logs with a center abutment of stones. In the great flood of 1835 it was washed away\\". In 1842, a contract was awarded to the well-known civil engineer Claudius Crozet to build a new covered bridge at West Union, as part of a series of public works along the Northwestern Turnpike. Ephraim Bee (1802‚Äì1888), a local blacksmith (who was also a district officer, magistrate, state legislator, hotelier, and postmaster at various times) made all the bolts and bands for the West Union Covered Bridge which was completed in 1843. On the night of March 27, 1858, a fire utterly devastated the town of West Union. At the time, many of the citizens were attending the U.S. court at Clarksburg, and so were not available for fire suppression efforts. The fire originated in an upper room of the residence of Lathrop Russell Charter. The flames spread quickly to other buildings: first, a large hotel and store room belonging to James A. Foley. Next came the residence of Ethelbert Bond and a storehouse belonging to Arthur Ingram. Other buildings followed and the next morning the entire settlement appeared a \\"mass of smoldering ruins\\". The Parkersburg and Grafton branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had just been completed, however, and the town was able to revive economically and structurally fairly quickly. Nearby Maxwell Ridge ‚Äî named for the family of Congressman Maxwell ‚Äî is said to have a cave that was used by the Underground Railroad in the years leading up to the Civil War. West Union was home to Matthew M. Neely, grandfather of West Virginia‚Äôs 21st governor. Governor Matthew M. Neely, also a US Senator, was born in 1874 just south of the town. West Union was incorporated on 20 July 1881. Doddridge County‚Äôs oil and gas industry was a boon to West Union. By 1906, the Ideal Glass Factory opened to take advantage of the abundant gas. It was followed by the Doddridge County Window Glass Company. The two plants employed about 300 people. In later years a garment factory opened, but closed in the 1970s. A long-remembered flood devastated West Union in June 1950, destroying homes and businesses and killing more than 20 people throughout the county. (One casualty was the 107-year-old covered bridge.) Today farming, timbering, oil and gas, and the business of county government and public education support the area, and many people commute to jobs in Salem, Clarksburg, and Parkersburg, or to the North Central Regional Jail in Greenwood. The Lathrop Russell Charter House, Doddridge County Courthouse, Silas P. Smith Opera House, and W. Scott Stuart House are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The population was 1,404 at the 2010 census. It is situated on high bluffs along U.S. Route 60 on a portion of the Midland Trail a National Scenic Byway near Hawks Nest overlooking the New River far below. History=Native Americans, European settlers, Fayette County The area of what is now southern West Virginia was long a hunting ground for nomadic tribes of Native-Americans before the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century. Around 1790, the area now known as Ansted was settled by a group of Baptists who did not hold legal title to the land. These people were known as \\"squatters\\", and built the Hopewell Baptist Church nearby. In 1792, a 400-acre (1.6 km2) tract of land in the area was patented to Charles Skaggs. Named in honor of the Marquis de la Fayette, a major hero of the American Revolutionary War, Fayette County, Virginia was created in 1831. The first county court was held that same year at Miles Manser's general store which stood nearby Ansted's current location along the James River and Kanawha Turnpike, an early roadway built to connect the canals on the James and Kanawha Rivers. The area was known at that time as Mountain Cove. At various times, it has also been known as Woodville, New Haven, and Westlake. American Civil War During the American Civil War, Fayette County became strategic for both Union and Confederate efforts. Nearby Gauley Bridge, a covered bridge carrying the James River and Kanawha Turnpike, was taken and retaken three times in 1861 and 1862;https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/2093 its spectacular burning was long-remembered in the community. During the winter of 1861-62, the Union Army's Chicago Gray Dragoons (later, Companies H and I of the 12th Illinois Cavalry)https://www.lib.niu.edu/1999/ihwt9916.html made the Halfway House (Tyree Tavern) in what is now Ansted their headquarters. Confederate General Robert E. Lee maintained headquarters on nearby Sewell Mountain, where he first met \\"Traveler\\", and later purchased what became his most famous horse.https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/288 The Chicago Dragoons had a strong religious orientation and ties to Chicago's Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). Many Union troops felt they were fighting the moral issue of slavery, although many Fayette County citizens had Confederate sympathies and so sent no delegate to the Wheeling Convention. Nonetheless, the area became part of the new State of West Virginia when it was formed in 1863. Local lore includes romances between the local girls and the young soldiers from Illinois. Some couples married, built homes and raised families in the Mountain State after hostilities ended. Post-war: railroads, coal mining, Ansted laid out Around 1872, the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway added a new line, on both sides of the narrow New River valley, creating a through route to the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The final spike in this portion of the C&O; was placed at Hawks Nest Station, just below Ansted, on January 29, 1873. Dr. David T. Ansted, British scientist and geologist (1814-1880) Also in 1873, the town of Ansted was created and named after British scientist and geologist, Dr. David T. Ansted (1814‚Äì1880), who in 1853, mapped out the nearby seams of high grade bituminous coal and once owned the land under the town. Former Confederate Colonel George W. Imboden, a wealthy lawyer from Augusta County, Virginia and brother of Confederate General John D. Imboden (under whom George Imboden fought with the 18th Virginia Cavalry) laid out the town. Imboden had begun speculating in coal lands in southern West Virginia after the war's end, and attracted British investors. Dr. Ansted, a noted geologist, had been engaged to investigate the region's potential for coal deposits, and his report far exceeded Imboden's best expectations. Ansted and Imboden bought more than a thousand acres (4 km2) of coal and timber land on Gauley Mountain between Hawks Nest and the town of Westlake. They organized the Gauley-Kanawha Coal Company, Ltd., in 1872 and in 1873 opened a mine about above the river and below the summit of Gauley Mountain. The company changed its name to Hawks Nest Coal Company, Ltd., in 1875, and was reorganized in bankruptcy in 1889 as the Gauley Mountain Coal Company. Colonel Imboden, who was Ansted's first mayor, helped stimulate the growth of the town's businesses. His second wife, Angie, renamed their family home \\"Contentment\\" because she and her family spent many happy hours there. Contentment had been built about 1830 on the James River and Kanawha Turnpike in the west end of what is now Ansted, and they acquired it in 1872. Another of the town's more well-known residents was William Nelson Page, (1854‚Äì1932). A civil engineer, prot√©g√© of Dr. Ansted, and mining manager, Page helped develop West Virginia's rich bituminous coal fields in the late 19th and early 20th century. Page also was co-founder and builder of the Virginian Railway. In 1898, on a knoll in the middle of town, Page had a palatial mansion built by Gauley Mountain Coal Company carpenters, where he and his wife Emma Gilham Page raised their four children. Like Colonel Imboden, William Page also served as Ansted's mayor for 10 years, although his title of \\"Colonel\\" was honorific (despite post-war involvement in the West Virginia State Militia). The railroad towns of Page and Pageton in West Virginia were named for him. Railroad to tunnel disaster to tourism Ansted had railroad service from 1874 until 1972. In 1874, mine owners had a narrow-gauge railroad built from Hawks Nest Station up the ravine of Mill Creek. A saddleback locomotive was used. In 1889, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) purchased the narrow gauge railroad and contracted with William Page to do the work to upgrade the line to standard gauge, which was completed on August 20, 1890. The (C&O;) operated the new branch line, which was known as the Hawks Nest Subdivision, from 1890 until 1972. It connected with the New River Subdivision main line at Hawks Nest Station and consisted of of line to and beyond the town of Ansted. The line had one of the steepest grades of any C&O; branch, a 4.17% grade. C & O did not want to transport passengers on the line, but the State of West Virginia ordered it to do so as a condition of licensing. The company appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which in Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company v. Public Service Commission of State of West Virginia, 242 U.S. 603 (1917), upheld the state's authority. Passenger service then began and continued until some time in the 1930s. The branch line's freight rail service ended in 1972 and the tracks were removed. Also in the 1930s, developers of hydroelectric power for the Union Carbide plant at Alloy, West Virginia, the Kanawha and New River Power Company, decided to divert the New River through a three-mile tunnel under Hawks Nest. Many of the 3000 workers building the tunnel were asked to mine the silica they encountered for use in steel production. Never given protective equipment (although managers wore protective breathing apparatus during visits), hundreds developed silicosis some so severe that they died within a year. After Congressional hearings, the Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster led to recognition of occupational lung disease as well as compensation legislation, as acknowledged by a historical marker on the site.https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=34417 It also became the subject of several books as well as historical fiction. Today, the Ansted-Hawks Nest Rail Trail follows the route from the Town of Ansted down the steep mountainside to near Hawks Nest Station in the New River Valley. The trail is in length and the aerial tram from Hawks Nest Lodge links to the terminus. Historical sites and attractions New River Gorge and the New River Gorge Bridge, nearly six miles away. Angie and George Imboden's 1830 home, Contentment, has become the Contentment Historical Complex, headquarters for the Fayette County Historical Society. It includes a historical museum and restored one-room schoolhouse, furnished as the mid-nineteenth century. The mansion of William and Emma Page and their family on the hilltop in Ansted also still stands as evidence of the once-thriving coal business. Later occupied by the family of Dr. Gene Vawter, and still in use as a private residence, the Page-Vawter House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Other historical landmarks include the Halfway House, the former Tyree's Tavern which was headquarters of the Chicago Gray Dragoons during the American Civil War, and the African American Heritage Family-Tree Museum, which helps African-Americans trace their roots. The grave of Julia Neale Jackson, mother of Confederate General Thomas Stonewall Jackson, is located in Westlake Cemetery in Ansted. The marker was placed more than 35 years after her death by Captain Thomas R. Ranson, one of the soldiers of the Stonewall Brigade, to mark his troops' affection for their fallen leader. Ansted has the distinction of having Hawks Nest State Park located within its borders. The park at Hawks Nest features a small museum and gift shop, an aerial tram ride to the New River Gorge, and spectacular overlooks including the famous \\"Lover's Leap\\". U.S. Route 60 threads through the community as part of the Midland Trail, a National Scenic Byway. Ansted hosts the Country Roads Festival each September and the Festival of Lights over the Christmas holiday season, a time when the Fayetteville theater produces an annual holiday play. Ansted also hosts annual PRO-AM Street luge competition. Mystery Hole is a more lighthearted attraction. A war memorial was erected in 2007 through donations, that has the name, rank, and period served of military veterans. Geography Ansted is located at (38.136029, -81.101951).

The town was originally named Vandalia. The Fayette County Courthouse is located on part of the original Vandal farm. The town‚Äôs name was later (prior to 1837) changed to Fayetteville after the Revolutionary War hero, Marquis de Lafayette who toured the US in 1824‚Äì25. During the Civil War, the majority of the people in Fayetteville were in sympathy with the Confederacy. With neighboring counties being predominately Unionist, however, Fayetteville changed hands several times during the war and was partially destroyed during the fighting. In 1897, the Fayette County Courthouse was completed and is a remarkable example of the Romanesque Revival architectural style. The Altamont Hotel was built the same year. Both are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, along with the E. B. Hawkins House. The Fayetteville Historic District was designated in 1990. Fayetteville grew rapidly in the late 19th century thanks mainly to the coal industry. The mining industry declined in the late 20th century. Fayetteville‚Äôs economy now is almost completely based on the tourism industry. Popular activities include white water rafting, fishing, mountain biking, and rock climbing in the region. Also, the New River Gorge Bridge hosts the annual celebration, \\"Bridge Day,\\" which is held on the third Saturday of October. The New River Gorge Bridge is the longest arch bridge in the western hemisphere; its creation made traveling on US 19 much easier, turning a 45-minute sojourn from one side of the gorge to the other into a roughly 45-second jaunt. The New River is one of the five oldest major rivers in the world. Geography Fayetteville is located at (38.051181, -81.106961).

Sometime in 1890, the first Meadow Bridge post office was established, and gave the area the name of Montrode. This was later changed to Clute, after the Virginia lumberman Theodore Clute who came with the railroad to establish a sawmill in the area. With the help of the Meadow River Lumber company, and Theodore Clute, millions of feet of lumber were cut, and soon a town sprang up with shops and houses. With industry in Meadow Bridge, on July 26, 1920, it was incorporated into an official town. Although industry came to the small town of Meadow Bridge, progression was slow and arduous. After several years of hard fighting, in 1924, they finally were able to bring a high school to the town, Meadow Bridge High School. Part of their troubles was the fact that they were isolated from the rest of Fayette County. That changed in 1937, when a 7 mile stretch of road was hard- surfaced, linking Meadow Bridge and the nearby town of Danese. In 1938 a road linking the town of Hinton and Rainelle ran through Meadow Bridge, linking all the towns together and, by extension, to Route 41. This finally gave Meadow Bridge a path to the western part of Fayette County. Industry In 1908, the Meadow River Lumber Company made a 20 mile stretch of track down to Meadow Bridge.

The population was five at the 2010 census. During the heyday of coal mining in the New River Gorge, Thurmond was a prosperous town with a number of businesses and facilities for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. The town was the filming location for John Sayles' 1987 movie Matewan since it still possesses many of the characteristics of a 1920s Appalachian coal town. Today, much of Thurmond is owned by the National Park Service for the New River Gorge National River. The C&O; passenger railway depot in town was renovated in 1995 and now functions as a Park Service visitor center. The entire town is a designated historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Thurmond is the least-populated municipality in West Virginia. During the June 14, 2005, city elections, six of the city's seven residents sought elected office. Rail transportation Amtrak, the national passenger rail service, provides service to Thurmond under the Cardinal route. It is the second least used Amtrak station after Sanderson, Texas. Geography Thurmond's level land is almost entirely consumed by CSX (formerly the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway) operations. Apart from a strip of commercial buildings that front directly onto the train tracks with no intervening street, the remainder of the town climbs the hill behind the bottomland. Thurmond was an important switching center for the C&O;, a place where short trains from mines in the area were assembled into longer trains for shipment to markets on the main line. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. History and description Thurmond was incorporated in 1900 and was named for Captain W. D. Thurmond, who settled here in 1844. He received the 73-acre site in 1873 as payment for a surveying job.https://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/28thurmond/28facts1.htm He served in the Confederate Army and died in 1910 at age 90.Janssen, Quinith and Fernbach, William (1984).

United States Post Offices, Volume VI - The Mid-Atlantic, p. 242. Scappoose, Oregon: La Posta Publications. The community remained small until Thomas G McKell of Glen Jean negotiated with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad for a crossing at Dunloup Creek in 1892. W. D. Thurmond banned alcohol from his lands, which comprised the originally incorporated portion of the town. However, the McKell family had no such scruples, and their Dun Glen Hotel on McKell land just to the east of the Thurmond land became notorious for hosting a fourteen-year-long card party claimed by Ripley's Believe It or Not to be the world's longest-lasting poker game. A district called \\"Ballyhack\\" or \\"Balahack\\" on the south side near the Dun Glen became notorious as Thurmond's red light district. There were two hotels in the town; one was called the Lafayette (known locally as the 'Lay- flat') which was close to the railroad, and the aforementioned 100-room Dun Glen, which opened in 1901, became a nationally known resort, and burned down in 1930, marking the beginning of a decline that saw Thurmond a virtual ghost town by the 1950s. The Thurmond National Bank (owned by Thurmond) closed in 1931 and the New River Bank (owned by the McKells) moved to Oak Hill in 1935. The Thurmond Historic District comprises the entire town and a small portion of the opposite riverbank. Thurmond was accessible solely by rail until 1921. The town occupies a narrow stretch of flat land along the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad track, with no road between the tracks and the town. Instead, a single-lane road crosses the New River on a single-track railroad bridge, crosses the main line, and climbs the hill behind the town so that it parallels the town 150 feet higher on the hill before dropping down next to the tracks. Due to its strategic position on the rail line, the commercial center thrived in spite of the absence of a road. In the residential portion of the town, housing types are standardized, with three or four basic types corresponding to different positions in the railroad hierarchy. The commercial district, while lacking a street for much of its history, boasted two hotels, two banks, and a number of other commercial buildings. The railroad station was built in 1888, while a railyard and shops served the extensive branch line network which carried coal out of the hills. The town once had a population of several hundred, which has dwindled to fewer than a dozen. The railroad depot is now a visitor center for New River Gorge National River.

The population was 1,537 at the 2010 census. It is the home of Glenville State College. History In the late 1700s and early 1800s, pioneers began settling in the area they called ‚Äò‚Äòthe Ford‚Äô‚Äô because it was a place where travelers could cross the river. Later, the community was named Glenville because of its location in a glen. The first grist mill in present-day Gilmer County was constructed there in 1812. The first courthouse was completed in 1850, the second in 1872, and the current courthouse in 1923. Glenville was incorporated in 1856. Before the 1930s, the Little Kanawha River‚Äôs commercial traffic dominated the town‚Äôs economy. Road construction contributed to the demise of riverboating by the late 1930s. The natural gas and oil industry rose to prominence after oil was struck in 1875 at nearby Letter Gap. Glenville is now the headquarters of several oil and gas firms. The 1985 flood devastated the downtown, leading many businesses to move to the higher Hays City neighborhood at the main highway intersection. The Little Kanawha Valley Bank was incorporated in 1901. Its small frame building, covered in pressed metal, is now on the National Register of Historic Places. By 1906, the First National Bank of Glenville and the Glenville Banking and Trust Company had also been created. Glenville is now served by United Bank and a branch of Calhoun Banks of Grantsville. Early Methodist circuit riders and Baptist missionaries brought their respective forms of worship to Glenville early in the 19th century. The Presbyterian Church was organized in 1847; the First Baptist Church, 1850; and Trinity United Methodist Church, 1896. Several other churches also serve the area today. Glenville has a golf club and recreation center, among several other facilities built at the old county poor farm. In 1885, the Glenville Crescent first published Ellen King‚Äôs poem, ‚Äò‚ÄòThe West Virginia Hills,‚Äô‚Äô which later became the official state song. While this newspaper didn't survive, the Glenville Pathfinder (1892) and the Glenville Democrat (1904) have. The flood of 1985 devastated all of Glenville. A late season tropical storm named Juan moved North leaving abundant moisture over the Southeast. On Sunday, November 3, another storm formed in Southeastern Georgia. This new storm tapped into the moisture left by Juan. By November 4, a large area of rain began to form from the Western North Carolina to Southern West Virginia. The storm's center slowly moved north, over central West Virginia. Rainfall rates of 3 to 6 inches in 12 hours were observed over the headwaters of the Potomac, Greenbrier, and Little Kanawha rivers. On Monday night, November 5, severe flooding took place and by midnight the rain became lighter, but by then flooding had begun. All of downtown Glenville was affected. Stores were closed, and buildings were flooded. Shopkeepers attempted to save their stock by piling sandbags up to stop the water, but to little avail. 47 lives were lost to the 1985 flooding. Most of the deaths were in rural Pendleton County and Grant County, according to the National Weather Service.West Virginia Gazette: \\"Remembering the '85 floods\\" (D.

Greenbrier Valley Airport supports a vibrant general aviation community, and also has direct daily flights on United Airlines to hubs in Washington DC (IAD) and Chicago (ORD). Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Lewisburg has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Lewisburg, West Virginia Demographics=2010 census As of the census of 2010, there were 3,830 people, 1,892 households, and 989 families living in the city.

History Civil War cemetery, Lewisburg Lewisburg is named after Andrew Lewis. In 1751 Lewis, as a young surveyor, established a camp near the spring behind the present courthouse. This spring has been known as the Lewis Spring since that time. During Pontiac's Rebellion in 1763, Native Americans completely destroyed two of the early European settlements in Greenbrier County, killing the men and carrying off the women and children. This raid virtually eliminated all of the earliest settlers in the county. The Native Americans were primarily Shawnees, and (according to undocumented tradition) were led by the famous leader Hokoleskwa, or Cornstalk. By 1770 a fortified encampment called Fort Savannah was established at the Lewis Spring. In 1774, Governor Dunmore of Virginia instructed then-Colonel Andrew Lewis to gather \\"willing and able men\\" to go to the great Kanawha River and stand against the Native American forces that were attacking the Greenbrier Valley. In what became known as Lord Dunmore's War, over 1,490 men were assembled, some at Fort Pitt at present-day Pittsburgh, and others at Fort Union, on the site of present-day Lewisburg. These recruits included Lewis's brother Charles, and others which history books refer to as one of the most remarkable assemblages of frontier leaders in American history. Thirteen were men of political and military distinction. Lewis's army marched down the New and Kanawha Rivers to the Ohio River, where they intended to cross over and invade the Ohio Country, which was the home of the Shawnees. The Native Americans, led by Cornstalk, attempted to cut them off at the mouth of the Kanawha, where they fought an inconclusive battle that came to be known as the Battle of Point Pleasant.(Pages 78, 98‚Äì99) Old Stone Presbyterian Church When the town of Lewisburg was formally laid out in 1780, Matthew Arbuckle, Sr. was the first settler. Among Lewisburg's first trustees was Col. John Stuart (1749-1823), a Revolutionary War commander who surveyed and settled the area and is known locally as the ‚ÄúFather of Greenbrier County‚Äù. The land on which the first county courthouse, and the Old Stone Church in Lewisburg, are situated was donated by Stuart. Lewisburg was formally established in 1782 by an act of the Virginia General Assembly. The original trustees were Samuel Lewis, James Reid, Samuel Brown, Andrew Donnelly, John Stuart, and Archer Mathews.Page 284 To accommodate Virginians west of the mountains, several Virginia courts sat in Lewisburg, where Patrick Henry once successfully defended a client accused of murder. The town and the surrounding farms prospered and a number of spas and resort hotels were established at some of the outlying mineral springs. During the Civil War a number of engagements were fought in and around Lewisburg. Several of the present buildings in town were used as hospitals and barracks by both sides in this conflict, and bullet marks can still be seen in some today. The Virginia Supreme Court library, which was located in Lewisburg and served as the Greenbrier County Library until 2008, was used as a hospital and has preserved a section of wall with soldiers' graffiti. In the mid 20th century, the Lewisburg area was home to several children's summer camps. Camp Ann Bailey, (named after Revolutionary War scout Anne Bailey) was located on the Greenbrier River. This Girl Scout camp was integrated in the 1950s thanks to the efforts of Charleston civil rights activist Elizabeth Harden Gilmore. The camp operated between 1927 and 1974, when it was closed to permit construction of Interstate 64. A boys' camp, Camp Shaw-Mi-Del-Eca, founded in 1929, was also located on the river. The two camps held joint activities, such as dances, with another nearby girls' camp, Camp Alleghany. In 1978, a area in the heart of Lewisburg was designated a National Register Historic District. Today, Lewisburg is home to the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine, one of 29 osteopathic medical schools in the United States and one of three medical schools in West Virginia. Attractions and events Carnegie Hall, Inc., Lewisburg In 1902, steel baron and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie built Carnegie Hall as a classroom building for the Lewisburg Female Institute, later the Greenbrier College for Women. Carnegie Hall, Inc. was incorporated in 1983 as a regional not-for-profit arts and education center. Today, the cultural center annually serves more than 75,000 patrons with live performances by artists from around the world, arts in education programming, classes, workshops, fine art exhibits, an independent film series and more. Carnegie Hall, Inc. is one of only four Carnegie Halls still in continuous use in the world. The Greenbrier Historical Society and North House Museum is dedicated to collecting, preserving, and interpreting the rich history of the Greenbrier Valley. The Greenbrier Historical Society has operated within the North House since 1976 and has owned the building since 1992. Built in 1820, the North House was the home of local lawyer John North and his wife Charlotte for more than a decade before becoming James Frazier's Star Tavern and Inn. At the turn of the 20th century, the North House became the President's home for Greenbrier Women's College. Today, the museum's permanent displays and temporary exhibits feature items from across the Greenbrier Valley, including, but not limit to; the training saddle of General Robert E. Lee's horse Traveller, an 18th-century covered wagon, Civil War artifacts, furniture made by local craftsman David Surbaugh, as well as original items from the North family. The Greenbrier Historical Society archives and museum hold artifacts from before the revolutionary war through today. The Greenbrier Historical Society and North House Museum also offers educational program, a research archive, group tour rates, and membership opportunities. The Lewisburg post office holds a mural, Old Time Camp Meeting, painted by American artist Robert F. Gates as part of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. The mural depicts a religious camp meeting, thought to be based on a local camp ground called Brushy Ridge. The Lost World Caverns are nearby, and feature self-guided tours and numerous rock formations. Organ Cave is also in the area. The State Fair of West Virginia is held in nearby Fairlea every August. Lewisburg is the site of West Virginia's largest Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration. The event includes a march through downtown Lewisburg, a community lunch, and a program commemorating the memory and legacy of Dr. King. Belsnickle or Old Christmas is celebrated with the Shanghai Parade on New Year's Day. In this observation of the older traditions, people dress in costumes and march down the main street. Its term comes from \\"collie-shanghai\\", an old word related to making a lot of noise. The parade has been going on for over 150 years . Other annual celebrations include two food festivals, Taste of Our Towns (TOOT) in October and the Chocolate Festival in April, and the Lewisburg Literary Festival, a celebration of books and the written word, held in August. Speakers at the Literary Festival have included Homer Hickam, author of Rocket Boys, Jeanette Walls, author of The Glass Castle, Garth Stein, author of The Art of Racing in the Rain, NBA basketball legend Jerry West, NPR's Noah Adams, West Virginia Poet Laureate and children's author Marc Harshman, and children's author Tom Angleberger of the Origami Yoda series. In 2013, musicians in the community created the West Virginia Winter Music Festival, as a fundraiser for musicians in need of financial support due to a life emergency. It has grown to be an anticipated event in the area every January. The Greenbrier Classic Concert series are held in nearby Fairlea at the State Fair Grounds every July. Artists who have performed include West Virginia native Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood, Keith Urban, Reba McEntire. Miranda Lambert, Rod Stewart, Lionel Richie, Victoria Justice, Jon Bon Jovi, Kenny Chesney, Aerosmith, Maroon 5 and Jimmy Buffett.

Associated to a chain complex is its homology, which describes how the images are included in the kernels. A cochain complex is similar to a chain complex, except that its homomorphisms follow a different convention. The homology of a cochain complex is called its cohomology. In algebraic topology, the singular chain complex of a topological space X is constructed using continuous maps from a simplex to X, and the homomorphisms of the chain complex capture how these maps restrict to the boundary of the simplex. The homology of this chain complex is called the singular homology of X, and is a commonly used invariant of a topological space. Chain complexes are studied in homological algebra, but are used in several areas of mathematics, including abstract algebra, Galois theory, differential geometry and algebraic geometry. They can be defined more generally in abelian categories. Definitions A chain complex (A_\\\\bullet, d_\\\\bullet) is a sequence of abelian groups or modules ..., A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, ... connected by homomorphisms (called boundary operators or differentials) , such that the composition of any two consecutive maps is the zero map. Explicitly, the differentials satisfy , or with indices suppressed, . The complex may be written out as follows. :: \\\\cdots \\\\xleftarrow{d_0} A_0 \\\\xleftarrow{d_1} A_1 \\\\xleftarrow{d_2} A_2 \\\\xleftarrow{d_3} A_3 \\\\xleftarrow{d_4} A_4 \\\\xleftarrow{d_5} \\\\cdots The cochain complex (A^\\\\bullet, d^\\\\bullet) is the dual notion to a chain complex. It consists of a sequence of abelian groups or modules ..., A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, ... connected by homomorphisms satisfying . The cochain complex may be written out in a similar fashion to the chain complex. :: \\\\cdots \\\\xrightarrow{d^{-1}} A^0 \\\\xrightarrow{d^0} A^1 \\\\xrightarrow{d^1} A^2 \\\\xrightarrow{d^2} A^3 \\\\xrightarrow{d^3} A^4 \\\\xrightarrow{d^4} \\\\cdots The index n in either An or An is referred to as the degree (or dimension). The difference between chain and cochain complexes is that, in chain complexes, the differentials decrease dimension, whereas in cochain complexes they increase dimension. All the concepts and definitions for chain complexes apply to cochain complexes, except that they will follow this different convention for dimension, and often terms will be given the prefix co-. In this article, definitions will be given for chain complexes when the distinction is not required. A bounded chain complex is one in which almost all the An are 0; that is, a finite complex extended to the left and right by 0. An example is the chain complex defining the simplicial homology of a finite simplicial complex. A chain complex is bounded above if all modules above some fixed degree N are 0, and is bounded below if all modules below some fixed degree are 0. Clearly, a complex is bounded both above and below if and only if the complex is bounded. The elements of the individual groups of a (co)chain complex are called (co)chains. The elements in the kernel of d are called (co)cycles (or closed elements), and the elements in the image of d are called (co)boundaries (or exact elements). Right from the definition of the differential, all boundaries are cycles. The n-th (co)homology group Hn (Hn) is the group of (co)cycles modulo (co)boundaries in degree n, that is, ::H_n = \\\\frac{\\\\ker d_{n}}{\\\\mbox{im } d_{n+1}}\\\\quad \\\\left(H^n = \\\\frac{\\\\ker d^{n}}{\\\\mbox{im } d^{n-1}} \\\\right) Exact sequences An exact sequence (or exact complex) is a chain complex whose homology groups are all zero. This means all closed elements in the complex are exact. A short exact sequence is a bounded exact sequence in which only the groups Ak, Ak+1, Ak+2 may be nonzero. For example, the following chain complex is a short exact sequence. : \\\\cdots \\\\xrightarrow{} \\\\; 0 \\\\; \\\\xrightarrow{} \\\\; \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\; \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\times p} \\\\; \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\twoheadrightarrow \\\\mathbf{Z}/p\\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\; \\\\xrightarrow{} \\\\; 0 \\\\; \\\\xrightarrow{} \\\\cdots In the middle group, the closed elements are the elements pZ; these are clearly the exact elements in this group. Chain maps A chain map f between two chain complexes (A_\\\\bullet, d_{A,\\\\bullet}) and (B_\\\\bullet, d_{B,\\\\bullet}) is a sequence f_\\\\bullet of homomorphisms f_n : A_n \\\\rightarrow B_n for each n that commutes with the boundary operators on the two chain complexes, so d_{B,n} \\\\circ f_n = f_{n-1} \\\\circ d_{A,n}. This is written out in the following commutative diagram. :650 px A chain map sends cycles to cycles and boundaries to boundaries, and thus induces a map on homology (f_\\\\bullet)_*:H_\\\\bullet(A_\\\\bullet, d_{A,\\\\bullet}) \\\\rightarrow H_\\\\bullet(B_\\\\bullet, d_{B,\\\\bullet}). A continuous map f between topological spaces X and Y induces a chain map between the singular chain complexes of X and Y, and hence induces a map f* between the singular homology of X and Y as well. When X and Y are both equal to the n-sphere, the map induced on homology defines the degree of the map f. The concept of chain map reduces to the one of boundary through the construction of the cone of a chain map. Chain homotopy A chain homotopy offers a way to relate two chain maps that induce the same map on homology groups, even though the maps may be different. Given two chain complexes A and B, and two chain maps , a chain homotopy is a sequence of homomorphisms such that . The maps may be written out in a diagram as follows, but this diagram is not commutative. :650 px The map hdA \\\\+ dBh is easily verified to induce the zero map on homology, for any h. It immediately follows that f and g induce the same map on homology. One says f and g are chain homotopic (or simply homotopic), and this property defines an equivalence relation between chain maps. Let X and Y be topological spaces. In the case of singular homology, a homotopy between continuous maps induces a chain homotopy between the chain maps corresponding to f and g. This shows that two homotopic maps induce the same map on singular homology. The name \\"chain homotopy\\" is motivated by this example. Examples=Singular homology Let X be a topological space. Define Cn(X) for natural n to be the free abelian group formally generated by singular n-simplices in X, and define the boundary map \\\\partial_n: C_n(X) \\\\to C_{n-1}(X) to be ::\\\\partial_n : \\\\, (\\\\sigma: [v_0,\\\\ldots,v_n] \\\\to X) \\\\mapsto \\\\sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i (\\\\sigma: [v_0,\\\\ldots, \\\\hat v_i, \\\\ldots, v_n] \\\\to X) where the hat denotes the omission of a vertex. That is, the boundary of a singular simplex is the alternating sum of restrictions to its faces. It can be shown that ‚àÇ2 = 0, so (C_\\\\bullet, \\\\partial_\\\\bullet) is a chain complex; the singular homology H_\\\\bullet(X) is the homology of this complex. Singular homology is a useful invariant of topological spaces up to homotopy equivalence. The degree zero homology group is a free abelian group on the connected components of X. de Rham cohomology The differential k-forms on any smooth manifold M form a real vector space called Œ©k(M) under addition. The exterior derivative d maps Œ©k(M) to Œ©k+1(M), and d = 0 follows essentially from symmetry of second derivatives, so the vector spaces of k-forms along with the exterior derivative are a cochain complex. : \\\\Omega^0(M)\\\\ \\\\stackrel{d}{\\\\to}\\\\ \\\\Omega^1(M) \\\\to \\\\Omega^2(M) \\\\to \\\\Omega^3(M) \\\\to \\\\cdots The cohomology of this complex is called the de Rham cohomology of X. The homology group in dimension zero is isomorphic to the vector space of locally constant functions from M to R. Thus for a compact manifold, this is the real vector space whose dimension is the number of connected components of M. Smooth maps between manifolds induce chain maps, and smooth homotopies between maps induce chain homotopies. Category of chain complexes Chain complexes of K-modules with chain maps form a category ChK, where K is a commutative ring. If V = V{}_* and W = W{}_* are chain complexes, their tensor product V \\\\otimes W is a chain complex with degree n elements given by : (V \\\\otimes W)_n = \\\\bigoplus_{{i,ji+j=n}} V_i \\\\otimes W_j and differential given by : \\\\partial (a \\\\otimes b) = \\\\partial a \\\\otimes b + (-1)^{\\\\lefta\\\\right} a \\\\otimes \\\\partial b where a and b are any two homogeneous vectors in V and W respectively, and \\\\lefta\\\\right denotes the degree of a. This tensor product makes the category ChK into a symmetric monoidal category. The identity object with respect to this monoidal product is the base ring K viewed as a chain complex in degree 0. The braiding is given on simple tensors of homogeneous elements by : a \\\\otimes b \\\\mapsto (-1)^{\\\\lefta\\\\right\\\\leftb\\\\right} b \\\\otimes a The sign is necessary for the braiding to be a chain map. Moreover, the category of chain complexes of K-modules also has internal Hom: given chain complexes V and W, the internal Hom of V and W, denoted Hom(V,W), is the chain complex with degree n elements given by \\\\Pi_{i}\\\\text{Hom}_K (V_i,W_{i+n}) and differential given by : (\\\\partial f)(v) = \\\\partial(f(v)) - (-1)^{\\\\leftf\\\\right} f(\\\\partial(v)) .

The population was 1,505 at the 2010 census. History severe storm in 2012 The valley and community that contain and predates Rainelle is named Sewell Valley after Stephen Sewell, a scout that settled in the area in the 1750s. The community west of the Meadow River first applied for the name Raine in honor of the Raine family but was turned down by the Post Office Department. They adopted the name Rainelle in 1909. Thomas W. Raine and his brother John moved to the location from Pennsylvania in 1906 to harvest a large stand of hardwoods for building homes, etc. Their Meadow River Lumber Company operated for 60 years, and at one time was the largest hardwood sawmill in the world. In 1970, the owners sold it to Georgia-Pacific Corporation, which tore it down in 1975. The town has suffered from a few natural disasters in the last decade: most notably have been the June 2012 North American derecho, Hurricane Sandy, and the 2016 West Virginia flood. Rebuilding and demolition of structures damaged in the 2016 flood was still in progress in January 2020.

The population was 1,765 at the 2010 census. Culture and history Ronceverte might have been named \\"Edgar\\", for the high number of Edgars who lived in the town, but the name was settled by a leading entrepreneur of the area, Cecil Clay, president of the St. Lawrence Boom and Manufacturing Company. According to Clay, he saw the name on an old Jesuit map from Fort Duquesne. His argument was that the name \\"looked well in print and was euphonious in sound.\\"\\"Ronceverte--Name Chosen for Our Town\\"--Riders of the Flood Historic Newsletter, 2000. As the owner of the town's site, Clay argued he had the right to decide on the name, but the residents could change the name to whatever they wanted once Ronceverte was fully established. That day has never happened. Since April 1, 1882, the town has been Ronceverte. Ronceverte is French for \\"Bramble Green\\", which is the Gallic equivalent for \\"Greenbrier\\". Greenbriers are a common vine (Smilax rotundifolia), and a humorous myth has it the surveyors were trapped in a thicket of the painful vines when they discovered the Greenbrier River. French surveyors were likely the first cartographers for the area, although many of the details have been lost to history. The river is still inseparable from the culture of the town itself, considered one of the earliest significant river ports in the Greenbrier River watershed. Ronceverte has been significantly impacted by the Greenbrier River flooding in 1985, 1996, and 2016. The Hokes Mill Covered Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. The Ronceverte Historic District was listed in 2005. Railroad Ronceverte is a proud railroad town, a part of the C&O; tracklines that connected Pocahontas County to Hinton, and to Clifton Forge, Virginia. Ronceverte was part of the \\"Gravel Girtie\\" line where Hinton-based train cars were sent to the limestone quarry at Fort Spring and loaded with crushed lime. This cargo was sent to Clifton Forge where it fluxed in the large furnaces. During World War II the tracklines carried German prisoners of war to areas like local farms and projects. One of the depots for the area, the Rockland Depot, has been lost to history and only the name of Rockland Road in Ronceverte remains. Geography Ronceverte is located at (37.748460, -80.469910). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Demographics Ronceverte's economic area is in the downtown section, crossed with railroad tracks for the Chesapeake & Ohio and a large floodplain that causes occasional adjustment for its citizens. Grants from Tony Hawk and the Izaak Walton League have allowed this public area to grow for the health and recreational opportunities for its citizens. A ball field, swimming pool, playground, interpretive walk and walking track appeal to all ages adjacent to a public access point of the Greenbrier River, where picnickers are welcome. The county's recycling depot is close by, encouraging further business from a large area. The public access includes a boat launch for swimmers and fishers, and an outdoor amphitheater. Every June this area is inundated with the Ronceverte River Festival, where a unique raffle is held by floating hundreds of small, numbered yellow ducks into the river. The winning duck can be a cash prize or a new truck; runners-up are gifts from local businesses to support county interests. 2010 census As of the census of 2010, there were 1,765 people, 753 households, and 446 families living in the city.

In September 10‚Äì19 the Outdoor Amphitheater stages Riders of the Flood, a popular historical drama based on the book by Pocahontas County author W. E. Blackhurst for the Riders of the Flood Outdoor Drama.http://ridersoftheflood.com/ The play's theme is a demonstration of Ronceverte's importance in the turn of the 20th century, when its St. Lawrence Boom and Lumber Company was the largest softwood mill in the country,St. Lawrence Boom and Lumber Co. and traces of its industry have sculpted Ronceverte's portion of the Greenbrier River to the shape it is today.

History Aerial view of the business district of Moorefield, West Virginia. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has constructed levees along the South Fork to protect the town. Moorefield is situated in the South Branch Valley along the South Branch of the Potomac River. Native Americans populated this area for centuries, farming along the river and hunting in the surrounding mountains. English settlers began arriving in the early 18th century, attracted by the fertile land. This early settlement was centered on the community of Old Fields, which is located about five miles to the north of present-day Moorefield. Conflict between the settlers and Native American populations broke out during the French and Indian War. Two fortifications guarded the South Branch Valley in the vicinity of Moorefield. Fort Buttermilk was erected in 1756 and garrisoned by Captain Thomas Waggoner's Virginia Regiment Company. A second fortress, Fort Pleasant, situated at Henry Van Meter's Farm at Old Fields, guarded the northern side of the valley and was also garrisoned by Captain Thomas Waggoner's Virginia Regiment Company. In the spring of 1756, soldiers from Forts Buttermilk and Pleasant clashed with Shawnee warriors under Bemino (known to the English as Killbuck) at the Battle of the Trough. The land on which Moorefield was laid out was owned by Conrad Moore. In 1777, the Virginia General Assembly chartered the town of Moorefield in what was then Hampshire County, Virginia (today Hardy County, West Virginia). When Hardy County was separated from Hampshire County by act of the Virginia General Assembly in 1785, Moorefield was chosen as the county seat. Many of the historic houses in Moorefield display vernacular adaptations of Federal and Greek Revival architecture and date to the last quarter of the 18th century and first quarter of the 19th century.

The population was 271 at the 2010 census. Originally named Trout Run, Wardensville was chartered in Virginia in 1832 and incorporated in West Virginia in 1879. Wardensville is located west of the Great North Mountain range, which separates it from the Shenandoah Valley. The town lies on the east bank of the Cacapon River at its confluence with Trout Run. The George Washington and Jefferson National Forests border the town to its east and south. History The land which Wardensville occupies was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a 5 million acre tract granted by England's King Charles II and formally established after the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660. In 1719, the land was inherited by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron who administered many of the land grants to the early European settlers who began arriving in the Capon Valley in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. William H. Warden is believed to be the first settler within the present town. He received a parcel of land from Thomas Fairfax, reportedly surveyed by George Washington, on November 11, 1749. During the French and Indian War, hostilities between the English settlers and the Native American populations in the South Branch and Capon Valleys led to the construction of a string of fortified outposts including Fort Warden or \\"Warden's Fort,\\" erected by William Warden at a place called Trout Run (later the town of Wardensville). According to historian Samuel Kercheval, the fort was attacked in 1758 when it was burned. Warden and a man only known by the name Mr. Taff did not survive the attack. The town of Wardensville was established in 1832 when the Virginia General Assembly granted a charter declaring \\"that the town of Wardensville, in the county of Hardy, as the same has been heretofore laid off into lots, streets and alleys, or as the same may be hereafter further laid off and extended into lots, streets and alleys, shall be, and the same is hereby made a town corporate, to be known and distinguished by the name of Wardensville.\\" The first trustees of the town were James Scanting, Samuel Fry, John Pierce, Simon Switzer, and James W. Baker. The town was incorporated by the West Virginia Legislature in 1879. In the 1820 United States Census, the population center of the United States was recorded as being about 3 miles northeast of the town. Historic structures in the town include the Cline Blacksmith Shop/Town Jail, a stone structure on Main Street erected around 1830. Two generations of the Cline family operated a blacksmith shop in the structure until 1895. In the earl twentieth century, the structure was converted for use as a town jail. St. Peter's Lutheran Church was founded in 1840 by Rev. John Hamilton and erected its first church on the site in 1870. After this building collapsed in 1934, the present stone church, designed by A. Hensel Fink in Gothic Revival style. The Old Presbyterian Church was constructed in the latter half of the nineteenth century and is a rare example of Italianate style in Wardensville. The Odd Fellows Hall was erected in 1856 on the southern edge of town near the intersection of Main Street and Trout Run Road. Two properties near Wardensville are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Francis Kotz Farm and the Nicholas Switzer House.

The population was 8,149 at the 2010 census. The town of Bridgeport had its beginning in pre-American Revolutionary War times. In 1764, John Simpson entered the area and gave his name to Simpson Creek. Bridgeport was chartered in 1816. When the town was incorporated in 1887, it established the office of mayor and town council. The city currently employs a City Manager. Bridgeport is home to Meadowbrook Mall, a 100-store regional shopping complex serving North-Central West Virginia. History Bridgeport originally got its name from a cartographer's mistake. Settled in the mid-1700s by early fur traders who came west over the Allegheny Mountains, settlers were forced to build forts to protect themselves from the elements, as well as from Native Americans who didn't care for the intrusion on their lands. Thus, as legend has it, what was known as Bridge Fort was mistakenly deemed Bridgeport. On June 29, 2006, the city became noted as the site of a showdown over the issue of separation of church and state in the United States. A portrait of Jesus originally hung on a wall at Bridgeport High School. Two parents filed suit in federal court to have the portrait removed, after the Harrison County Board of Education deadlocked over whether to remove the portrait. The portrait of Jesus was stolen from Bridgeport High School early in the morning on August 17, 2006 and a mirror was put in its place. In 2016, two baseball teams from Bridgeport won Little League state championships.

The population of the city was 16,578 at the 2010 census. It is the principal city of the Clarksburg, WV Micropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 89,718 in 2019.List of micropolitan statistical areas Clarksburg was named National Small City of the Year in 2011 by the National League of Cities. Courthouse History Indigenous peoples have lived in the area for thousands of years. The Oak Mounds outside Clarksburg were created by the Hopewell culture mound builders between 1 and 1000 C.E. The first known non-indigenous visitor to the area that later became Clarksburg was John Simpson, a trapper, who in 1764 located his camp on the West Fork River opposite the mouth of Elk Creek at approximately (39.28128, -80.35145) Settlement and early history As early as 1772, settlers began claiming lands near where Clarksburg now stands, and building cabins. In 1773, Major Daniel Davisson (1748-1819) took up , upon which the principal part of the town is now located. By 1774, people settling near present Clarksburg included: Daniel Davisson, Obadiah Davisson (Daniel's father), Amaziah Davisson (Daniel's uncle), Thomas, John, and Matthew Nutter, Samuel and Andrew Cottrill (brothers), Sotha Hickman, and Samuel Beard. Undoubtedly, others located on these public lands, of which no official records were made. The Virginia General Assembly authorized the town of Clarksburg in 1785. Now a city, it is named for General George Rogers Clark, a Virginian who conducted many expeditions against the British and Indians during the Indian Wars and the war of the American Revolution, including the strategically critical capture of Fort of Vincennes, now in the State of Indiana, in 1778. As now-President George Washington had proposed years earlier, the General Assembly also authorized a road from Winchester, Virginia to Morgantown in 1786, and a branch from this road (which decades later became the Northwestern Turnpike) would soon begin through Clarksburg toward the Little Kanawha River (which flows into the Ohio River at Parkersburg). In 1787, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the Randolph Academy at Clarksburg, a private school led by Rev. George Towers and the first west of the Alleghenies. However, although many here as the 19th century began wanted the National Road westward to follow McCulloch's Path (improvements beginning after the Northwestern Turnpike company's formal incorporation by the Virginia General Assembly in 1827), Congress instead authorized construction on an easier route (Nemacolin's Path) through Maryland and Wheeling, which opened in 1818. Construction of the first Harrison County courthouse began in Clarksburg in 1787. That building was followed by four increasingly larger courthouses; the most recent one completed in 1932. The first Court House stood on what is now the North East Corner of Second and Main Streets; the jail stood on the opposite side of Main Street near where the Presbyterian church now stands. Relatively poor transportation slowed northwestern Virginia's development, so subscribers in Winchester, Romney, Kingwood, Clarksburg, Parkersburg and other towns en route caused the Northwestern Turnpike to be built. While the toll road increased development around Clarksburg in the 1830s, it also used a relatively anachronistic model. Nonetheless, the Randolph Academy was razed and replaced by the Northwestern Academy in 1841, a year after stage coach service began between Clarksburg and Parkersburg on the Ohio River. Clarksburg's development increased more a decade later due to new technology and further subscriptions. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad reached Clarksburg from Grafton in 1856. Two of the modern city's historic buildings date from this prewar era. The Stealey-Goff-Vance House, now owned by the Harrison County Historical Society, was originally constructed in 1807, expanded in 1891 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Waldomore was built beginning in 1839, served as the Clarksburg Public Library from 1931-1976 (when a new building was built next door for the majority of the collection), and added to the National Register in 1978. Civil War During the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861, both Harrison County delegates opposed secession initially, although delegate (and future U.S. Congressman) Benjamin Wilson abstained from the final vote (which approved the ordinance of secession). Its other delegate, John S. Carlile, became a leader of the Wheeling Convention which led to creation of the Restored Government of Virginia during the American Civil War (during which Carlile served as U.S. Senator), and ultimately creation of the State of West Virginia. On the other hand, Confederate General Stonewall Jackson had been born in Clarksburg in 1824. Clarksburg's citizenry also reflected this divide. Union General McClellan established his headquarters near Clarksburg until the First Battle of Bull Run. The B&O; line made Clarksburg an important Union supply base throughout the war, with at one point more than 7000 troops in the city. It became a target of Confederate raiders, but none actually reached the city, instead striking surrounding areas with fewer defenders. The closest, most famous (and materially successful) raid, the Jones-Imboden Raid of April and May 1863, was designed to impede recognition of West Virginia (which became the 35th state of the Union anyway in June 1863). Postwar industrialization In 1877, Clarksburg became one of three cities from which West Virginia voters would select their new state capitol. Despite its relatively central location and an early lead, it came in second; Charleston, West Virginia became and remains the state capital.Clarksburg Downtown Historic District NRIS, item 8, p. 3 available at http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/harrison/82004794.pdf Around that time Clarksburg gained some industry and manufacturing, particularly involving glass and coal. The city grew slowly but steadily, and services increased apace. The still-functional Despard Building was built in 1870. Telephone service, the first in the state, began in Clarksburg in the mid-1880s, but in 1884 native son Edwin Maxwell (1825-1903; the Republican candidate), lost the election to become Governor of West Virginia. In 1887, Clarksburg laid its first six miles of water lines; downtown streets were lit by electricity in 1889. Nonetheless, in the late 1890s, a visitor called Clarksburg a \\"sleepy, moss-covered town.\\"NRIS item 8 p. 3 Clarksburg's boom years began around the turn of the century, as coal and glass production increased. Population grew from 4,050 in 1900 to 27,869 in 1920, partly because in 1917 it annexed the previously independent surrounding communities of Adamston, Stealey, North View and Broad Oaks. Population may have reached 35,000 in 1929, before the Great Depression.NRIS In 1894, the Traders' Hotel was constructed, the grandest structure to date. Many buildings in the Clarksburg Downtown Historic District date from that era. In 1900, the first sewer lines were installed, and Main and Pike streets were paved with brick. In 1901, the city's first trolley opened for business (it would cease operating in 1947). Merchants Smith, Brown and Company built an early department store beginning in 1890. The Northwestern Academy was razed in 1894 and the Towers School erected (which became the city's high school). Merchants National Bank built a building in 1894 which later became the Community Bank. Clarksburg's oldest bank, the Empire National Bank, built a seven-story headquarters in 1907. Other significant buildings include the Goff Building (1911), Municipal Building (1888), the Waldo Hotel (1901‚Äì1904), Robinson Grand (1912, 1940), Harrison County Courthouse (1931-1932), U.S. Post Office (1932), Masonic Temple (1911‚Äì1914), First United Presbyterian Church (1894), and First Methodist Church (1909, 1956). An automobile had reached Clarksburg in 1902, and that technology fostered further development. In 1928, U.S. Route 50 was paved through Clarksburg. U.S. Interstate 79 would open in 1979 and connect Clarksburg with Charleston as well as Pennsylvania. In 1924, Clarksburg hosted a parade for its \\"native son\\", John W. Davis, who had become the \\"dark horse\\" Democratic Presidential candidate (but lost) to Republican incumbent Calvin Coolidge. The following year, Republican and former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Howard M. Gore, became Governor of West Virginia. During the 1920s, Clarksburg's Melville Davisson Post (1869-1930) may have been the country's highest paid author, writing 17 novels including the characters of Randolph Mason and Uncle Abner and nominated for, but not winning, the Nobel Prize for literature. As the Great Depression began, the Farmers Bank closed in 1929, and the Bank of West Virginia (which had opened in 1869) failed in 1933. Clarksburg's population dropped to 30,579 by 1940, and further as the decade progressed. Former Gov. Gore served as state agricultural commissioner (1931‚Äì33) and later as Public Service Commissioner (1941‚Äì47).NRIS item 8 p. 4 However, Clarksburg managed to avoid urban blight and preserve much of the architecture it had gained during the \\"boom years\\". It is still West Virginia's fourth largest city. The West Virginia Preservation Alliance, the state's first, was created in Clarksburg in 1981. Mountaineer Militia On October 11, 1996, seven men having connections with the Mountaineer Militia, a local anti-government paramilitary group, were arrested on charges of plotting to blow up the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Criminal Justice Information Services Division complex in Clarksburg. While members of the group had been assembling large quantities of explosives and blasting caps, militia leader Floyd Raymond Looker obtained blueprints of the FBI facility from a Clarksburg firefighter. Plastic explosives were confiscated by law enforcement officials at five locations in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Looker was taken into custody after arranging to sell the blueprints for $50,000 to an undercover FBI agent, whom he believed to be a representative of an international terrorist group. In 1998 Looker was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Two other defendants were sentenced on explosives charges, and the firefighter drew a year in prison for providing blueprints. Business and industry The availability of natural resources, coupled with easy access to railroad facilities, attracted industry and manufacturing to Clarksburg, including chemical plants, brickworks, potteries, foundries and machine shops, hardwood and casket companies, glass factories (including the Akro-Agate marble company), and the Jackson (later Phillips) Sheet and Tin Plate Company, the forerunner of Weirton Steel. Economic development brought successive waves of immigrants in the 19th and early 20th centuries, including Irish, Italians, Greeks, French, Belgians, and Spanish. Early 20th century Clarksburg boasted eight banks, three hospitals, and several fine hotels, including the elegant seven-story Waldo, which opened in 1909. The seven-story Empire Bank building went up in 1907, the nine-story Goff Building in 1911, and the 10-story Union Bank in 1912. By 1929, Clarksburg had reached its peak population of 35,115. During the Depression the city lost industry and population, but during World War II the railroad again made it a central clearinghouse. New development came with the construction in the 1970s of Interstate 79 and the new four-lane U.S. 50 Appalachian Corridor D connecting I-79 to I-77, but plant closings in the 1980s had a negative impact. New expansion in the government and technology sectors began in the 1990s, including the relocation of the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Center to Clarksburg and construction of a new federal building and a new building to house Fairmont State University's Clarksburg branch. *In 1975, Clarksburg opened a new public library designed by Marcel Breuer, adding another distinctive element to its architecturally rich downtown. *The city has a daily newspaper, The Exponent-Telegram, three local television stations, and six radio stations. *Clarksburg is home to Eastpointe and Newpointe, the largest strip mall in West Virginia, adjacent to Interstate 79. Most of Clarksburg's retail has relocated to the strip malls, and downtown is now home to many professional services.[18] Akro Agate Company The Akro Agate Company of Clarksburg was a world leader in manufacturing glass marbles. Organized in Akron, Ohio, in 1911 the firm relocated to Clarksburg in 1914 because of the availability of glass sand and cheap natural gas for fuel. The Chinese checkers craze of the 1930s and ‚Äô40s helped make the marbles very profitable, with more than 2,000,000 made per week. Beginning in the 1930s a line of pressed glass vases, floral ware, and colorful glass containers was produced. Miniature glass children‚Äôs dishes, including tea pots, cups, saucers, and other pieces, were sold as inexpensively boxed sets when World War II limited the availability of metal for toys. The marbles and multicolored pressed articles in similar hues are sought by collectors today. Pressed products can sometimes be identified by the trademark of the letter A with a crow flying through it. The firm, located off South Chestnut Street, ceased production in 1951. Hazel-Atlas Glass Company Hazel-Atlas Glass Company, the glassmaking giant in a state known for glass production, was created in 1902 by the merger of four earlier companies. The largest glass company in the United States from the 1930s until the 1950s, Hazel Atlas was a major producer of inexpensive ‚Äò‚Äòdepression glass‚Äô‚Äô table sets of pink, green, blue, colorless, and black glass. Hundreds of thousands of glass premiums given away in oats, coffee, and other products were made by Hazel Atlas. Hazel Atlas glass plants in West Virginia included one along the Tygart River in Grafton (1916‚Äì60) that largely produced wide- mouth canning jars, and the world's largest tumbler factory in Clarksburg (1902‚Äì87). By 1920, the Clarksburg factory had 15 acres of floor space, employed 1,200 people, and shipped all over the world. The company's metal factories in Wheeling made lids and closures for glass containers. Federal Bureau of Investigation In July 1995, the Federal Bureau of Investigation completed construction on its Criminal Justice Information Services Division complex in Clarksburg. The $200 million complex, located on 986 acres, is the national repository for the FBI's law enforcement records. The project came about through the efforts of Senator Robert C. Byrd. In 1990, in Byrd's second year as head of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the senator worked to fund the center and get it built in West Virginia, not Washington.

Belgians During the first decade of the 20th century, French was frequently spoken on the West Virginia streets of such communities as South Charleston, the North View section of Clarksburg, and the small town of Salem. These neighborhoods shared a connection to the window-glass industry, and the people speaking French often were Walloons, or French-speaking Belgians. About 1900, changes in window-glass manufacture brought thousands of immigrants from the Charleroi area of Belgium just when the industry was expanding into West Virginia to take advantage of cheap natural gas and large deposits of silica sand. For a generation, window-glass factories, many of which were worker-owned cooperatives, relied heavily on these Belgian immigrants to provide the skills necessary to make West Virginia a national center of production. West Virginia's Belgians came from an area economically similar to West Virginia. The Charleroi basin of the Hainaut province in Belgium was dependent upon coal mining, steel production, and window-glass manufacturing. The Belgians‚Äô new homes in north-central West Virginia and the Kanawha Valley must have felt familiar. They left Europe because the Belgian glass factories were struggling in the 1880s and 1890s. Equally important, workers had limited opportunities to voice their concerns either politically or economically. Belgian glassworkers found in the United States an effective trade union to represent their workplace concerns and the means to build a vibrant political movement advocating democratic socialism. In fact, some of these Belgian enclaves, including Star City near Morgantown and Adamston (now part of Clarksburg), elected Socialist mayors in the years before World War I. Aside from politics, Belgian ethnic communities also became famous for the cuisine, musical groups, social clubs, and celebrations composing the unique Belgian cultural heritage. The technological changes that had made skilled Belgian workers so valuable, however, soon gave way to newer technologies that turned window-glass manufacture from a skilled craft to a mass-production industry. By the end of the 1920s, a few large corporations dominated the industry and machines replaced most of the skilled craftsmen. One exception, window-glass cutters, continued to provide opportunities to a new generation of Belgian-Americans. More than 70 years later, the Belgian-American Heritage Society keeps alive the history and culture of this fascinating ethnic group. Events Clarksburg is a cultural center of the north-central West Virginia region and hosts many events and festivals. Since 1979 Clarksburg has hosted the annual West Virginia Italian Heritage Festival held during Labor Day weekend. Every September since 1991 the city has been the site of the West Virginia Black Heritage Festival. Since 2006 Clarksburg has hosted the annual Glen Elk Wine, Music and Arts festival. Since 1997 Clarksburg has also hosted the Greater Clarksburg 10K race, the official WV 10K State Championship. In 2007 the race was renamed the Jarvis Greater Clarksburg 10K. Climate Clarksburg has a humid continental climate if one considers the 0 ¬∞C isotherm. To the molds of K√∂ppen the climate may be considered the southern boundary of the Dfb zone at low altitudes in the North American continent (limit of 39 ¬∞ N), although in the immediate vicinity it is Dfa. The city still suffers strong influences from the south, especially from the Gulf of Mexico but due to its location has a much more significant influence of the cold air intrusion of Canada, where it is not protected by the Appalachians. The extent further to the south is due to the eastern and southeastern mountain ranges blocking the oceanic influence in part, even if it is minimal anyway by the considerable distance from the coast. At the same time it can be classified as Cfa or hybrid of different climatic zones according to the criterion to be surveyed, a situation similar to that of Boston. It is the Dfb boundary throughout the northern hemisphere if it is to be disregarded in elevated regions on all continents. The southern record could appear on the Korean peninsula but the dry season defined version (Dwb) predominates in these locations. The average temperature is 52.2 ¬∞F (11.2 ¬∞C) with a high average of 63.3 ¬∞F (17.3 ¬∞C) and a low average of 41.1 ¬∞F (5.1 ¬∞C). It has 45.6 inches (1159 mm) of rain with peak in May (4.8 inches or 122 mm) and lower value in February with 3.2 inches (82 mm). The amount of total snow is 25 inches (63 cm), with highest values between January and February, 8 inches (20.3 cm) in total for each month. Since the season of snowfall goes from November to March.

One month after operations began, senior partner J. R. Phillips was killed in a train wreck, when the Pullman sleeper he was resting in on a siding was struck by a passing train. Either the sleeper car had not been completely onto the siding or a load of steel on a passing freight car shifted. Phillips secretary E. T. Weir then took the helm of the company and tinmill became the first Weirton Steel Company. Summit Park also called Greektown or especially Tinplate and Tin Plate was in the area.

History  Arriving in the early 1770s, the families of brothers Thomas, Matthew, John, and Christopher Nutter were early European settlers to western Virginia. Thomas Nutter had received a land grant for 1,400 acres (5.7 km2) of land along Elk Creek in what was then Monongalia County. Together with the settlers Obadiah and Daniel Davisson, the Nutters constructed a fort in 1772, later known as Nutter's Fort, said to have been one of the strongest forts south of Fort Pitt. Located on the eastern side of Elk Creek, the fort was used by the Virginia state militia from 1776-1780 in conflicts with Native Americans. Thomas Nutter served as a captain in the Revolutionary Army and died in early August 1808.

Notable settler family names included Lippincott, Maxson, Babcock, Plumer, Davis, and Randolph. New Salem was formally chartered and made a town by legislative enactment of the Virginia Assembly on December 19, 1794, on land owned by Samuel Fitz Randolph.

Railroad Station, Salem, WV, circa 1914 By the 1870s, the town was more frequently being called \\"Salem\\" than \\"New Salem\\", as the separation of West Virginia from Virginia in 1863 had diminished the need to distinguish it from the town named Salem near Roanoke. The US Postal Service made the change official in March 1884. Salem was incorporated by the state of West Virginia on 25 February 1905. Salem has a history of large fires. The same full city block has burned down twice in the city's history. The north side of Main Street downtown burned once in 1901 and again on March 2, 2006. The more recent fire burned the old city bank building, several store fronts, and several residences; five structures in all were damaged. The fire was determined to have been started by a hot water tank in an apartment.

History The roots of Shinnston date back to 1778, when Levi Shinn constructed his log home. The log house, located along Route 19, is the oldest standing structure in North Central West Virginia. It is maintained by the Shinnston Historical Association, which opens the home for tours by the general public. In 1815, the town was laid out with three streets, running parallel with the river, and with four crossing streets running at right angles to them. The town was incorporated in 1852 as Shinn's Town by an act of the Virginia legislature, as West Virginia did not yet exist as an independent state. Solomon S. Fleming was elected as the first mayor. A new charter was secured in 1877 and the town's name was changed to Shinnston. In 1915, Shinnston's charter provided for a Mayor-Council form of government. This model remained in place for over 70 years and in 1998, the citizens voted to revise the charter to adopt a City Manager-Council form of local government. That model was implemented on July 1, 1998 and remains in place today. West Fork River Bridge in Shinnston, 1887 Shinnston has enjoyed a history of active commerce, with its beginnings built around both grain mills and saw mills. In its early years, the town saw the development of a tannery, wagon makers, an undertaker, mercantile interests, a pottery, and a local newspaper. The railroad came to the area in 1890, and the first bank opened in 1899. From 1906 to 1947 a trolley operated in the area, offering another form of transportation. As is true for much of West Virginia, energy has been a vital component in our city's history. By the early 1900s oil wells and gas wells joined coal as major economic forces. Energy generation continues to be a major source of jobs and economic activity today, as evidenced by the existing mines as well as the nearby Harrison Power Station. The city's economy has also seen a shift to service-oriented businesses and the downtown is filled with thriving shops and retail establishments, filling the needs not only of Shinnston, but of the entire North Harrison region. Shinnston has also enjoyed a diverse culture of many faiths and denominations. The first church was organized in 1786 and held meetings and services in several homes until the construction of the first church building in 1835. Today, the area churches work together, having formed a Council of Churches offering shared services with members of several faiths. By 1813, the first school was organized with classes taught in a small log cabin. In 1860 a larger building was constructed for use as a town hall and academy. This turned into the first public school in 1865. The first grade school was established in 1895 and Shinnston High School was added in 1907. In 1978, Shinnston and Lumberport High Schools were combined to form Lincoln High School. Over the years these schools have produced many distinguished alumni who have gone on the achieve fame in the fields of athletics, business, literature, art, and higher education. Shinnston has enjoyed a strong sense of community and community spirit. Over the years residents have been challenged by natural disasters, including the Shinnston tornado, which hit on June 23, 1944. The community has always risen to meet these challenges and that spirit of togetherness continues to drive the community. It is that community pride that has led to the development of the Lowe Public Library, construction of the Clay District Veterans Memorial, the Bice-Ferguson Memorial Museum, and the construction of Ferguson Park, among other examples. For those who want to read more about our community's history, several books are available at the library. We encourage you to read \\"A History of the City of Shinnston\\" by Lena E. Poling, to visit the library, the museum, and the Shinnston High School Alumni Room. Shinnston Tornado The deadliest tornado in West Virginia's history struck Shinnston at 8:30 p.m., June 23, 1944. Sixty-six people died in the town and surrounding area. The total number of people killed by the tornado was 103, with 430 serious injuries. After wreaking havoc in farming communities northwest of Shinnston, the twister hit hardest in a neighborhood known as Pleasant Hill, where no more than 10 houses were left standing. The tornado then continued to Shinns Run and Booths Creek, where it destroyed a large natural gas compressor station, passing on through Marion, Taylor, and Barbour counties before blowing out in Randolph County. After the initial deaths and maiming, the greatest destruction was to property and the infrastructure. Power lines went down, including a huge tower and high-voltage transmission line near Saltwell. The two hospitals in Clarksburg had to treat victims by candle and flashlight. Phone service, however, was disrupted for only a short time, thanks to wartime emergency backup preparations. Among the many unexpected ways people helped each other were the lending of generators to the hospitals by a traveling circus and grave digging by the prison camp laborers from Gypsy, north of Shinnston. Selfless efforts were also made by elected officials, the National Guard, police, road crews, firefighters, nurses, doctors, and common citizens. The Shinnston Tornado was part of a broader outbreak of tornadoes and violent weather in the northern Appalachian region during the period of June 22‚Äì23, 1944. Tornadoes were reported in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia, including several tornadoes in a zone from Wellsburg, West Virginia, across southwestern Pennsylvania to Garrett County, Maryland, on June 23. The Shinnston Tornado was the deadliest and most destructive of the June 22‚Äì23 tornadoes. Tornadoes are rare in West Virginia, which has among the nation's lowest rates of occurrence for such storms. The Shinnston Tornado was estimated to have been an F-4 tornado, the second highest of the rankings currently assigned to tornadoes. F-4 storms produce winds faster than 206 miles per hour, capable of leveling houses and throwing automobiles.http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/398 Civil War The area was heavily Northern in its sentiments during the Civil War, and many local men served in the Union Army.

However, for about two decades, confusion arose because the same name was also used for a town established in Ohio County at the mouth of Buffalo Creek, and authorized in the 1791 term of that local court. That area in 1797 became known as Brooke County, with that \\"Charlestown\\" as its county seat until a December 27, 1816 act of the Virginia General Assembly changed its name to Wellsburg, to honor a trader and his son.Nancy L. Caldwell, A History of Brooke County, (Brooke County Historical Society 1975), p. 4 Charles Washington, the founder of Charles Town, was born in Hunting Creek, now Fairfax County, Virginia, on May 2, 1738. He was the youngest full brother of George Washington. He came to what is today Jefferson County between April and October of 1780. The estate of Charles Washington, Happy Retreat, was erected in 1780. In 1786, on 80 acres (320,000 m2) of his adjoining land, Charles laid out the streets of Charles Town, naming many of them after his brothers and one after his wife, Mildred. He donated the four corner lots at the intersection of George and Washington Streets for public buildings of the town and county, provided the town become the seat of the county separated from Berkeley County, In 1794, James Madison married \\"Dolly\\" Todd at Harewood, the home of George Steptoe Washington, son of George Washington's brother Colonel Samuel Washington, just outside Charles Town. 19th century Jefferson County was formed in 1801 as Charles Washington had anticipated. The county court house stands on one of the lots he donated, as did the jail until 1919, when it was demolished and replaced by the Post Office. Charles Washington died sometime between July and September, 1799, only a short while before the death of his brother George. Charles' and his wife Mildred's grave sites near Evitts Run have recently been located and surrounded by a stone wall. In 1844, the first issue of the Spirit of Jefferson newspaper was published in Charles Town by James W. Beller. It is the oldest newspaper in the state still (2020) being published. On October 16, 1859, abolitionist John Brown and his followers raided the Federal arsenal at nearby Harpers Ferry, east of Charles Town. The insurrection was quickly put down and John Brown and his captured associates were tried in the Jefferson County Courthouse for treason, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection; all were found guilty. On December 2, 1859, Brown was hanged in Charles Town at the location occupied today by the Gibson-Todd House. The trial and execution brought the national press and many other visitors to Charles Town. See Virginia v. John Brown. During the first two years of the Civil War, the front lines of the Union and Confederate armies in the area fluctuated and the town frequently changed hands during the military engagements in the surrounding areas, with the town first occupied by Confederate troops, then Union troops, then back to Confederate until 1863 when Union troops occupied the town for the remainder of the war.

Ranson, in Jefferson County, West Virginia, was officially incorporated in 1910, when residents, by a vote of 67‚Äì2, decided to form their own town. It was named in honor of Dr. James Ranson, a dentist and farmer living in the area. The early growth and development of Ranson reflects the late 19th century boom of the Shenandoah Valley and surrounding areas associated with the rise of the railroads, mining, and manufacturing. Early photographs of Ranson show the offices of the Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing & Improvement Company, and the Hotel Powhatan, along with a few residential structures nearby. The community grew north from Lancaster Circle. Some of the companies that located in Ranson early on included the Hotel Powhatan, the Goetz Saddlery, the Shenandoah Brass and Iron Works, the Elemer E. Beachley Saw and Planing Mill, the John Farrin Boiler and Machine Shop, and the Vulcan Road Machine Company.Ranson: A Centennial History by Bob O'Connor (2010) One of the most significant structures to be constructed in Ranson was Hotel Powhatan. This four-story frame Queen Anne structure was located on on 3rd Avenue, between Mildred and Preston Streets. The building was designed by \\"Baldwin and Pennington, Architects\\", and was built by local contractor Julius C. Holmes for $46,500. The hotel opened in October, 1891, but in 1900, it had become the Powhatan College for Young Women. In 1913, the college closed, and in 1915 it was re- opened by the Episcopal Diocese, under the direction of Maria Pendleton Duval, as St. Hilda's Hall for Girls, a Christian school. In 1921, a dormitory was added on property across the street from the original building. This new structure was known as Peterkin Hall, and currently houses the offices of Amerigas. In 1931, with the stock market crash, the school closed, and was converted into apartments. The original hotel structure burned to the ground on December 11, 1937. In 1936, the town of Ranson purchased the former Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing & Improvement Company office building from Mr. Getzendauner for $3,000 for the purposes of establishing a town hall. In 2003, the City began a multi-year renovation of the entire building, bringing it into the 21st century. By 1941, Ranson's population was 1,171. Ranson continued to grow and by 1950, the population increased to 1,436. By 1970, the population had increased to 2,189. In 2000, Ranson had a population of 2,951. By 2010, the population was at 4,440, an increase of over 50% in just 10 years. In the 2000s, the City Council saw a need to grow its tax and employment base after the unfortunate closings of AB&C; Corporation, Dixie Narco, and Badger Powhatan, and took advantage of the commercial development opportunities along the 4-lane stretch of State Route 9 north of Ranson. Thus, the Council annexed several thousand acres, which now host commercial, residential, and agricultural properties. Today, as Ranson celebrates its centennial, the City is transitioning from a small industrial town, which boomed in the late 19th century, to a community that blends major corporations with quiet residential neighborhoods and a developing commercial district. Many of the homes date from the turn of the century and reflect styles of that era. Most are unassuming, vernacular, frame or brick, single family, two-story dwellings or one-story cottages. Newer one-story homes, townhouses, and apartment complexes have been built on vacant lots throughout Ranson, with most new development being on the western and northern boundaries along the 4-lane U.S. Route 9. As in the beginning, Ranson continues to host and welcome business and industry to the community. With the construction and opening of the new $425,000 Charles Town General Hospital on October 3, 1948, at the original location of the Hotel Powhatan on 3rd Avenue, Ranson began to develop a medical community, with many doctors opening offices in and around the hospital. On April 22, 1975, Jefferson Memorial Hospital (now Jefferson Medical Center) opened at its current facility on Preston Street and 4th Avenue, at a cost of $4.5 million. The current facility continues to serve the residents of Jefferson County. Just outside the limits of Ranson, but extremely important to the community's economy, is Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races. This facility provides employment to over 1200 individuals, and generates millions of dollars of taxes to Jefferson County and its municipalities for capital improvements. Thanks, in part, to these proceeds, which began flowing in 2004, the City has been able to purchase police cars and equipment, complete the Mildred Street streetscape project in 2007, which added sidewalks, curb, gutter and benches, renovate and construct parks, and renovate City Hall. In 2004, the Potomac Marketplace and the surrounding residential subdivisions of Lakeland Place and Shenandoah Springs broke ground and opened. The Marketplace, when completely built, is intended to be a commercial development, and currently includes national retailers and restaurants such as Home Depot, Kohl's Department Store, Weis Market, McDonald's, Chick-Fil-A, and Petco, to name a few. Ranson is governed by a mayor, recorder, and five-member city council, who each serve four-year staggered terms. The city employs a city manager who is appointed by council to serve as the administrative head of government. The city is a fully functioning government, with the Ranson Police Department providing 24-hour- per-day, 7-day-per-week protection to the city's citizens. City Hall is staffed with a Planning and Zoning department, Public Works department, Finance department, and Legal department to carry out the functions of government and provide services to the residents of the city. Two volunteer fire departments, Independent Fire Company and Citizens Fire Company, serve the city and provide it with fire protection. Additionally, the city has its own municipal court system. Transportation WV 9 westbound in Ranson The main highway serving Ranson is West Virginia Route 9. This highway, which is an expressway through Ranson, runs in a general southeast to northwest alignment, connecting Ranson and neighboring Charles Town to Leesburg and Martinsburg. WV 9 also connects to U.S. Route 340 and Interstate 81. The other highway serving Ranson is West Virginia Route 115, which follows WV 9's old alignment from before its newer expressway was constructed.

The population was 1,227 at the 2010 census. History In the 1800s, Clendenin was a small settlement at the confluence of Big Sandy Creek and the Elk River that eventually became a small village named Chilton. At this time, timber and coal mining were the principal industries in the area. In 1846, one of the first cannel coal veins was discovered at Falling Rock (only a few miles from Chilton/Clendenin) and became a rich source for manufacturing artificial gas. Clendenin was platted in 1877. In 1893, the Coal and Coke railroad was built running through Clendenin, paralleling the Elk River and allowing the logging industry to set up residence. Along with the drilling of the first gas well in the area in 1900, this allowed the development of one of the largest oil and gas fields in West Virginia. The town was incorporated in 1904 and named after the Clendenin family, an early pioneer family in the Kanawha River Valley. The first petrochemical plant in the world was built in Clendenin in 1920. This plant was the original Union Carbide Corporation facility. Other chief economic staples included timber, coal, gas, oil, and salt. The decades from 1900 to 1930 saw most of the towns growth, and construction of most of the major buildings in town, including the elementary, middle, and high schools, several large churches, three banks, and several blocks of commercial buildings. When Union Carbide moved their production plant from Falling Rock to Charleston, the economy slowed but Clendenin remained a commercial hub for northern Kanawha County, southern Roane County, and western Clay County until Interstate 79 bypassed the town in the 1980s. Clendenin suffered damage during the 2016 West Virginia flood. Recovery was largely complete by January 2020, although some homes remained in need of demolition or rebuilding. The current mayor of Clendenin is Kay Summers. Town elections (including the office of mayor and city council) occur every two years. Recent efforts have been made by 25045-A New Clendenin (a non-profit corporation based in Clendenin) and the Business and Industrial Development Corporation (headquartered in Charleston) to enhance economic and cultural development in the town.

Sites of interest=First petrochemical plant A spinoff of the oil and gas industries started at Clendenin in 1920 when Union Carbide built the world's first petrochemical plant‚Äîproducing synthetic chemicals from natural gas. Carbide soon relocated to South Charleston, and the Kanawha Valley became the nation's chemical capital. But the oil and gas boom had already put Clendenin on the map, with a thriving downtown section.

History  The town of Rome was founded at the junction of the Little and Big Coal rivers in the 1890s by the Childress family. Soon the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway built a line along the Coal River to transport coal from the coal fields in Boone and Logan counties into the hub in nearby town of St. Albans. The town grew and a town council was formed. The town officially changed its name to Alum Creek in 1910. A constable policed the town, although without a vehicle he relied on the generosity of locals to transport him from place to place. In 1922 a set of bridges were constructed across the Big and Little Coal rivers. It was also at approximately this time Union Carbide built Cliffside, a summer camp on the banks of the Coal River. The town flourished for the next half century with most of its residents working in either the mining industries or in chemicals. Two elementary schools were founded in the town, Alum Creek Elementary on the Kanawha County side and Midway Elementary on the Lincoln County side. A high school was also built in the 1930s, named Washington District High School, after the tax district. WDHS was closed in 1980 due to school consolidation. In the mid-1980s U.S. Route 119 was constructed through Alum Creek and brought a host of businesses into Alum Creek; however, this did not help the town out of poverty due to a decline in the coal mining and chemical industries.

History Harts (town), situated at the mouth of Big Harts Creek, is named for Stephen Hart (Heart), an early settler who once lived in the area, or his father, the latter killed by Native Americans in the vicinity. Richard Elkins was the first permanent settler, arriving in 1807 or 1815. At the time of Elkins' settlement, depending on which year is accurate, the present-day town was part of Kanawha County or Cabell County. Prominent early families who settled in the present-day town of Harts include the Elkins, Adkins, and Toney families. After 1824, the area became a part of Logan County. Prior to the Civil War, Isaac Adkins (who lived at the present-day site of the Harts Fire Department) operated a large farm at \\"Harts Bottom.\\" He was one of the area's most prominent landowners; Isaac Adkins Shoals are named for him. In the 1840s, James Toney, a native of present-day Boone County, acquired land from the Elkins settlers at the mouth of Big Harts Creek, just across the river from Harts Bottom. During the Civil War, nearly all local men served in the Confederate Army. In 1869, the area became part of Lincoln County. In November or December 1870, Henry S. Godby established Hearts Creek Post Office. The Hearts Creek PO was discontinued in 1872. In 1877, merchant William T. \\"Bill\\" Fowler established Hart's Creek Post Office. This post office was discontinued in 1880. In 1881, Andrew D. Robinson established the Hart Post Office. During the 1880s, the Lincoln County Feud occurred in Harts and garnered headlines in newspapers across the United States. During the 1890s, Al and Hollena Brumfield were the most prominent residents. In 1904, the C&O; Railroad passed through town. In 1910, Hart PO was discontinued. In 1916, Lewis Dempsey established Harts Post Office, which continues today. Prominent merchants during this time and in subsequent decades included F.E. Adkins, Herb Adkins, P.B. \\"Fed\\" Adkins, Hollena Brumfield, Fisher B. Adkins, Watson Adkins, and L.T. Jones. The Harts Creek community includes the Harts Creek District of Lincoln County and a portion of Chapmanville District in Logan County. It includes the following communities, many of which once had post offices which are now closed: Atenville, Bulwark, Enzelo, Ferrellsburg, Fourteen, Fry, Gill, Green Shoal, Halcyon, Harts, Leet, Rector, Sand Creek, Shively, Spottswood, Toney, Warren, and Whirlwind. The larger community includes the following watersheds: Big Harts Creek (Lincoln and Logan counties), Big Ugly Creek, Fourteen Mile Creek, a portion of Kiahs Creek, Little Harts Creek, Little Ugly Creek, Sand Creek, Dry Branch, Browns Branch, Swift Shoals Branch, Walker Branch, Fowler Branch, Douglas Branch, Green Shoal Creek, and Abbotts Branch. These various locations were populated by numerous families prior to 1840: Brumfield, Elkins, Gore, Adkins, Fry, Brown, Lucas, Spurlock, Toney, Vance, Workman, Conley, Rowe, Adams, Browning, Collins, Dingess, Dolen, Heart, Johnson, Lambert, Lilly, Perry, Tomblin, Hensley, Butcher, White, Mullins, Dalton, Thompson, Dempsey, Abbott, Blankenship, Brooks, Butcher, Estep, Farley, Ferrell, Nester, Richards, Spears, Woodrum, Dial, Carter, and Farmer.

Photo by Lewis Hine. Marion County Courthouse in Fairmont Fairmont is a city in Marion County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 18,704 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Marion County. History Prior to the founding of Fairmont, the land that would become Marion County was part of Monongalia and Harrison County. In the 1700s, the earliest development of this area consisted of subsistence farming settlements. In 1789, Boaz Fleming, a Revolutionary War veteran, migrated to this area and purchased a 254-acre farm from Jonathan Bozarth. Oral history indicates that in 1808, Fleming made his annual trek to Clarksburg to pay his brother's Harrison County taxes. While in Clarksburg, Fleming attended a social gathering that included his cousin, Dolley Madison, wife of President James Madison. Fleming complained to Mrs. Madison about having to travel over a hundred miles each year from his home to pay his Monongalia County taxes and his brother's Harrison County taxes. Mrs. Madison supposedly suggested that he create his own county to save him all that travel. In 1814, Fleming circulated a petition to do precisely that, naming the proposed county Madison County, in honor of Dolley and James Madison. Milford (now Rivesville) was the only town within the borders of Fleming's proposed county, so Fleming decided to make Milford the seat of Madison County. However, Milford's citizens preferred to remain part of Monongalia County. As a result, Fleming's petition failed to gain sufficient support to be presented to the Virginia General Assembly. Fleming then focused on creating a new town near his farm, which was located on the west side of the Monongahela River. In 1817, Fleming's sons‚ÄîWilliam and David‚Äîbegan to clear land on part of their father's farm to make way for the new town; this part of the farm would later become downtown Fairmont. In 1819, a road was built from Clarksburg to Morgantown. Fleming's new town was about halfway between the two cities, making it a good resting point. The town was incorporated as Middletown on January 19, 1820. It is unknown if the town was called Middletown because of its location midway between Clarksburg and Morgantown or because Fleming's first wife, Elizabeth Hutchinson, was originally from Middletown, Delaware. The current borders of Marion County were established in 1842, and Middletown was named the county's seat. At that time, William Haymond Jr. suggested that the town's name be changed to Fairmont because the town had a beautiful overlook of the Monongahela River, giving it a \\"fair mount.\\" The Borough of Fairmont was incorporated in 1843 by the Virginia General Assembly. Many of the first buildings in Fairmont were poorly constructed. By 1852‚Äîlittle more than 30 years after the city's founding‚Äîa large portion of Fairmont was reported to be run-down and dilapidated. Reports from 1873 indicate that these buildings had continued to fall into disrepair. On April 2, 1876, a fire destroyed a large portion of the city's business district, as well as many houses in the area. The continuing dilapidation of the city's buildings may have contributed to the fire; the large number of coal mines under Fairmont may have also played a role. Between 1891 and 1901‚Äîin a span of only 10 years‚ÄîFairmont's population had increased from 1,000 to 7,000. The City of Fairmont was chartered in 1899; as a result of the charter, the city absorbed the surrounding towns of Palatine (also known as East Side) and West Fairmont. By 1901, Fairmont was an important commercial center. Many railroads‚Äîincluding the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad on its way from Cumberland, Maryland to Wheeling‚Äîtraveled through the city. By this time, Fairmont was also the leading center of the coal trade industry in northern West Virginia, employing some 10,000 workers in the coal mines around Fairmont. Geography The Tygart Valley River and the West Fork River join in Fairmont to form the Monongahela River. Buffalo Creek, a tributary of the Monongahela River, flows through the northern part of the city. According to the US Army Corps of Engineers, Fairmont, West Virginia, is the port city farthest from the ocean (2,085 miles) via an inland waterway.

Known as Mannington since 1856, the town is rich with history and heritage ‚Äì from Native American relics to frontiersmen and their settlements to Civil War legends. Perhaps what makes Mannington most unusual is the impact of the oil and gas boom in 1890 that literally changed the shape of the town. The population was 2,063 at the 2010 census. Geography Mannington is located at (39.527340, -80.339742), along Buffalo Creek. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. History=Early history At the time of the first settlement, the west fork of Buffalo Creek was known as Warrior's Fork, while the North Fork has historically borne the name of Pyle's Fork. One of the first settlers in the area was John Ice, who was born in the valley of the South Branch of the Potomac River in what was then Virginia. As a child, Ice and his father searched in vain for his mother, two sisters and brother who had been captured by the Indians. The mother was never found, although the children ultimately were. Only John's brother, known from then on as \\"Indian Billy\\" returned to the family. The sisters chose to remain with their one time captors (Prichard 1983). Indian activity was not uncommon in the area and many settlers and travelers met their fate at the hands of the Indians, including John Madison, the cousin of James Madison the future president, who was killed on a surveying trip in the area in 1783. Although not necessarily as a result of this, James Madison did procure, as an investment, some land on Brush Run and Pyles Fork just north of Forks of Buffalo. The earliest population concentration did not occur in what is now Mannington, but rather approximately two miles west of Dent's Run. Most of the land now falling within the city limits, some , was owned by Robert Rutherford, a Revolutionary War financier and an intimate friend of George Washington. In 1799, Rutherford sold his Forks of Buffalo holdings to James Brown of Berkeley County, Virginia, who, after experiencing financial setbacks, eventually sold the property at public sale in 1824 to a group of Baltimore, Maryland, investors which included William Baker. Baker apparently bought out his partners and, in turn, sold the parcel to James Hanway, a surveyor living in Monongalia County, who parceled the land and began selling it. This final transaction occurred in 1840 and it was then that the area now known as Mannington had its genesis. After the parceling of the land around the Forks of Buffalo, interest in the area increased as did the population. A number of log houses began to be built, with the accompanying entrepreneurial activities that one might expect in an early settlement. By 1850 a tavern owned by George and Samuel Koon appeared in the heart of the burgeoning town. Not long after the tavern was opened, the Forks of Buffalo began to be known as Koon Town. While the local inhabitants may have used the newer name, the United States government failed to do so, in 1850 naming their first postal office in the community the Forks of Buffalo Post Office. It was not until 1856 that the village officially became known as Mannington, named after Charles Manning, a civil engineer with the Baltimore and Ohio (B&O;) Railroad. Manning was well liked by the community and the inhabitants were eager to have a more \\"dignified\\" name for a growing town on the new railroad line. The coming of the railroad heralded the introduction of heavier industry in the Mannington area. Logging and coal were two of the obvious industries which were developed along the railroad line, but there were a great many peripheral industries which appeared as well. Tree bark was used by the tanneries, which, in turn, produced a wide range of leather goods. New planning mills, sawmills, and woodworking plants were started, and the availability of transportation also witnessed an increase in cattle, sheep and crop production. During the American Civil War, the B&O; railroad, of vital interest to both of the conflicting sides, sustained more damage than Mannington proper did. While Confederate forces succeeded in burning several of the railroad bridges at the very beginning of the conflict, reinforcements from the Union insured the integrity of the Mannington section of the line for the remainder of the war. Oil and gas boom A new chapter in Mannington's history began in 1889 with the first oil drilling, following recommendations made by Dr. Israel C. White, a well-known geologist who later became West Virginia State Geologist. Although many felt that the area was unfavorable for oil reserves, White persisted and soon gained enough local support to drill. Following the first strike, late in 1889, real estate prices soared 100% in two days in a boom- town mentality. The Mannington field became one of the largest in the State, with the largest well producing about . Dr. White also pushed for natural gas exploration. It was this venture, more successful than any before or since, that was most responsible for Mannington's growth. The population increased from approximately 700 people in the late 19th century to over 4,000 by 1917. By 1900, Mannington was a thriving town, complete with its own trolley system, electricity, theaters, schools, fire department, telephones and other amenities. The Mannington School Building, constructed in 1902‚Äì1903, was the pride of both the town and the state. In 1923, Albert Heck began the formation of the first community radio cable system from Mannington to its outlying areas. Boom to bust The 1929 stock market crash and the Depression severely affected Mannington's economy. The trolley ceased operation in 1933, factory workers left as demand for products decreased, and the town's population began to decline.

The population was 1,044 at the 2010 census. Monongah was chartered in 1891 based on Chapter 47 of West Virginia code. Its name is derived from the nearby Monongahela River. History The Adena and Hopewell peoples dwelt in what is now northern West Virginia 1,500‚Äì2,000+ years ago. By the time of the early European traders and settlers, the native population is thought to have been nil, decimated by the Beaver Wars.

Monongah mining disaster Monongah suffered the loss of all 358 miners underground and an engineer on the surface when Fairmont Coal Company Mines No 6 and No 8 exploded at 10:30 am on December 6, 1907. The dead consisted of 171 Italians, 85 Americans (including 11 African-Americans), 52 Hungarians, 31 Russians, 15 Austrians, and 5 Turks. Three more people died in the aftermath, yielding a total of 361 victims. This mining accident left approximately 250 widows and 1,000 fatherless children. Mayor W.H. Moore, along with D.F. Morris, William Gaskins, and John Boydoh served on the Monongah Relief Committee, formed soon after to help manage the aid effort. Mayor Moore headed the Monongah Mines Relief Committee after Monongah and Fairmont decided to merge their committees into a joint effort.History of the Monongah Mines Relief Fund, pp 9‚Äì10, books.google.com; accessed June 18, 2017. Memorials were erected in the center of town to recognize the centennial of the mining disaster on December 7, 2007. One memorial, titled Monongah Heroine, consists of a statue of a mother holding a baby with a young child beside her. It is dedicated to the widows and mothers of the miners who died. The inspiration for the statue is reported to have come from Catarina Davia, a woman widowed by the disaster. Feeling betrayed by the coal company for lack of compensation after her husband's death she vowed to make the 1.3 mile trek from her home to the mine to steal a satchel of coal every day until she died. She didn't only do this once every day but she did it twice. Her house was still standing until an accidental fire burned the house down on September 10, 2010. A second memorial, consisting of an engraved metal bell and plaque, was placed by the Italians to recognize the many victims from Molise in southern Italy. Father Everett Francis Briggs, a Roman Catholic missionary of the Maryknoll order, oversaw the memorial project and died just a few days after its completion. On February 21, 2002, the West Virginia Legislature (House Concurrent Resolution no. 40) resolved \\"to name the bridge which traverses the West Fork River in Marion County, located .12 miles west of county route 27/2, the Father Everett Francis Briggs Bridge\\", in honor of Briggs' dedication to the forgotten victims of the 1907 tragedy and the mine widows. Commerce, industry and media Fairmont Coal Company, of Fairmont, West Virginia, bought 36 mines in June 1901, including 6 mines of the Monongah Company. The town's local cement block factory went out of business in 2002 and was torn down in 2003. The broadcast tower for the Fairmont AM radio station, WMMN, was constructed in the middle 1930s atop Tower Hill in Monongah.In 2004, Jack Meredith (1925‚Äì2007) recorded his recollections of growing up on Tower Hill, including the story of how he helped dig the ditches that electrically connected the three WMMN broadcast towers. http://don.homelinux.net/~don1/TowerHill/jack_text.html Education Monongah High School was merged with the public high school populations of Mannington, Barrackville, and Fairview, West Virginia in 1979 to form North Marion High School, located in Farmington, West Virginia. North Marion was constructed to replace Farmington High School, which closed in 1975. The Saints Peter and Paul School was a K-8 parochial school operated in Monongah by the Sisters Auxiliaries of the Apostolate Society, a Roman Catholic society of apostolic life founded in Wheeling, West Virginia on December 15, 1937 and terminated August 26, 2013.West Virginia Companies http://www.companies- westvirginia.com/sisters-auxiliaries-of-the-apostolate-society-khd/ The school and surrounding buildings were demolished in August 2011.Times WV, It's A Sad Day http://www.timeswv.com/local/x890682521/-It-s-a-sad-day Notable people *Sam \\"Toothpick\\" Jones - Pitcher - Major League Baseball *Ruth Broe - United States Marine *Roman Prezioso ‚Äì West Virginia state senator *Nick Saban ‚Äì Head coach, Alabama Crimson Tide football Geography Monongah is located at (39.459531, ‚àí80.215787).

History Rivesville was platted in 1837, and named after William Cabell Rives. In 1900, it was a very small town, population 164, growing to 190 in 1910. This was immediately before the development of large- scale coal mining in the area and the subsequent population growth.Ray V. Hennen, David B. Berger, I.C. White, West Virginia Geological Survey, Marion, Monongalia and Taylor Counties, Wheeling News Litho. Co., Wheeling, 1913, page 35. In the early 20th century, Rivesville was at the junction between the Pawpaw branch of the B&O; Railroad and the Buckhannon & Northern Railroad, a branch of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie a predecessor that was incorporated into the Monongahela Railway formed in 1915. Rivesville was also served by the Fairmont-Clarksburg Division of the Monongahela-West Pen Railways, originally the Monongahela Power and Railway Company.

Coal mining About the only area around Rivesville where the coal has not been mined out is directly under the older portion of the town and under the riverbed. Consolidation Coal Company Mine No. 97 was in the Pittsburgh coal seam around 100 feet below the level of the riverbed. This mine operated between 1922 and 1954, with a peak production of 670408 tons per year. The coal seam itself is 6 to 8 feet thick. The number 97 Hoist Shaft was directly west of the westernmost corner of the Power Plant, with the hoisting engines to the north across the tracks. Consol. Mine No. 24 was directly across the river, with its shaft in the company town of Montana Mines, and in 1943, plans were filed to connect these mines with an under-river crossing.Document No. 904913 West Virginia Coal Bed Mapping Project In 1934, Consol.

Neighborhoods Benwood is partitioned into 4 sections (North Benwood, Center Benwood, South Benwood and Boggs Run) each connected by either Marshall Street or West Virginia Route 2. North Benwood North Benwood is the primary commercial area of the small city and contains several businesses and fast food restaurants. While all of Benwood lies in a flood zone, North Benwood tends to be hit hardest by the floods of the Ohio River. Center Benwood Slightly to the south lies Center Benwood, which is the primary residential section of the city and contains Saint John Roman Catholic Church, Benwood City Park (established in 1973), the Fourth Street Playground, the city building, the fire, water and police departments, the post office, the Blake Brothers Post No. 46 American Legion and the original Undo's Family Restaurant. Center Benwood is laid out in a rectangular grid, approximately 1 mile around divided 4 blocks long and 3 streets wide. Center Benwood used to be hit very hard by the devastating floods of the Ohio River, but a flood wall was constructed along Water Street (the street that runs along the banks of the Ohio River) in 1982, thus protecting that section of Benwood from the river floods seen in the last three decades (1990, 1991, 1996, 2004, 2005 and 2011). South Benwood South Benwood lies below Center Benwood and contains the majority of the city's industrial developments. Boggs Run The Boggs Run area of Benwood contains the land extending from Marshall Street at the mouth of Boggs Run to the confluence of Boggs Run and Browns Run. That portion of land was annexed to the city of Benwood on November 7, 1944. Boggs Run (the creek that runs through the land) is named after John Boggs (1738‚Äì1826), who staked his claim to the land surrounding the creek in 1774 and settled there with his family along the creek. In 1798, he sold the land at Boggs Run and moved with most of his family to Pickaway County, Ohio where he lived the remainder of his life. He is buried in the Boggs Family Cemetery (Elmwood Farm) in Logan Elm Village, Pickaway County, Ohio. Boggs Run has seen many devastating flash floods through the years, but one of the worst in recent history occurred August 31, 1975. Three other significant flash floods in the 20th and 21st Centuries occurred on June 14, 1990, September 17, 2004 and July 28, 2017. In the event of an Ohio River Flood, the mouth of Boggs Run is flooded both by the river and the creek, as the river flood backs up the flow of the creek. Outlying areas While the areas of Benwood Hill and a portion of Boggs Run beyond where Browns Run flows into Boggs Run are provided with some services from Benwood's public works, they fall outside the city limits and are not directly parts of the city. Former neighborhoods Harmony Hill was a residential area of Benwood that was located on the hillside between the mouth of Boggs Run and Schad's Crossing (former entrance to the north end of Center Benwood at Fourth Street) along West Virginia Route 2. Kentucky Heights was another residential area located on the hillside along Route 2 between Schad's Crossing at Center Benwood and The Bellaire Bridge. The homes and businesses of both areas were all razed to make way for the relocation of West Virginia Route 2 through the construction of the present four-lane highway in 1966. Religion Benwood was once home to three churches of different religious denominations. Of the three churches, two remain in operation. Saint John Roman Catholic Church Saint John Roman Catholic Church, located at 622 Main Street in Center Benwood, was officially established as a parish on August 1, 1875 when the first resident pastor, Rev. Patrick F. McKernan, was appointed to serve the Roman Catholic residents of Benwood. Prior to 1875, the original church, which had been constructed about 1868 and was dedicated to Saint John, was served by visiting priests from surrounding parishes. The original church was damaged in the Ohio River Flood of February 1884. As a result, the church was demolished, and a new church was built on the same site between 1891 and 1892. The cornerstone for the second church was laid on June 28, 1891. The second church served the parish for one hundred and twenty-four years until it was destroyed by a fire on March 30, 2015. The 1891 church, along with the rectory, was demolished between May 2015 and August 2015. Ground was broken for the third Saint John Church on June 28, 2016. The new church was constructed on the same site as the 1891 church. Construction was completed in the summer of 2017. The new church was blessed and dedicated on September 9, 2017. The first regular Sunday Mass was celebrated in the new church on September 17, 2017. The majority of the parish consists of the descendants of immigrants from fifteen different European ethnic groups (Irish, English, Scottish, Welsh, German, Hungarian, Italian, Croatian, Slovak, Czech, Austrian, Serbian, Polish, Lithuanian and Romanian) who settled in Benwood and the outlying areas of Boggs Run and Browns Run in the mid to late 1800s and early 1900s. Saint John Church is a parish within the Wheeling Vicariate of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston. Since June 20, 1995, Saint John Church and Saint James Roman Catholic Church in the neighboring city of McMechen have been served by the same pastor. On June 15, 2016, the pastor of Saint John Church and Saint James Church was also appointed the pastor of Saint Alphonsus Roman Catholic Church in Wheeling, West Virginia. Saint Matthew Evangelical Lutheran Church Saint Matthew Lutheran Church is located in Boggs Run on Boggs Run Road just outside the Benwood city limits. The church was formerly located in what is now the Blake Brothers Post No. 46 American Legion building in Center Benwood on Water Street. It was relocated to the present church built on Boggs Run in 1941. Benwood Methodist Episcopal Church A Methodist Episcopal (M.E.) Church was formerly located in Center Benwood. The first structure that housed the church was located on Eighth Street. It was later relocated to a new church built on Main Street in 1900, which was razed in the early 1990s. Education Benwood was once home to several public schools and two Roman Catholic private schools. Marshall County Schools operates area public schools. Public Schools There was a public elementary school in Center Benwood. During the course of its history, three separate buildings housed this school located on Water Street. The first school building was built in the late 1860s and razed to build a larger school in 1873. The second school building was built in 1873 and razed in 1901. The third and final school building was built in 1901. The school closed in 1953, and the building was later razed. A public elementary school was located in North Benwood and closed in 1953 as well. The Croatian Cultural Club building housed this school. South Benwood had a public elementary school, but it was destroyed by fire in the early 1910s. Boggs Run Elementary School is located on Boggs Run Road beyond the Benwood city limits. It was first housed in a wooden structure, but was later replaced with a brick structure on the same site about 1927. The school closed in 1990 at the end of the 1989‚Äì1990 school year. The brick school building still stands, and it now houses a Halloween museum. Union High School, located in South Benwood on Marshall Street, was established in 1913 when Benwood High School was consolidated with McMechen High School. Union operated as a high school (grades 9, 10, 11 and 12) for fifty-five years, from 1913 until the end of the 1967‚Äì1968 school year, graduating its last class in 1968. Union High School was consolidated with two other public high schools in Marshall County (Moundsville High School and Sherrard High School, which both became junior high schools and are still in operation) in 1968 to form John Marshall High School in the city of Glen Dale in Marshall County. John Marshall High School opened at the beginning of the 1968‚Äì1969 school year and is still in operation. Union then became a junior high school (grades 7, 8 and 9) until it closed in 2003 at the end of the 2002‚Äì2003 school year. Parochial/Private Schools Saint James and Saint John School was a Roman Catholic elementary and middle school (preschool through eighth grade) that was located on 7th Street in Center Benwood. The origin of Saint John School dated back to 1860. The school, which was connected to the back of Saint John Roman Catholic Church, was housed in several different buildings in the immediate area during the course of its history before the most recent school building was built during 1952‚Äì1953 and opened in January 1954. At the end of the 1970‚Äì1971 school year, Saint John School in Benwood was consolidated with Saint James School in McMechen, and the school became known as Saint James and Saint John School in 1971. After the fire that destroyed Saint John Church on March 30, 2015, the school was moved to the former Saint Francis Xavier School in Moundsville, West Virginia (closed in 2012) where the students finished the 2014‚Äì2015 school year. On May 18, 2015, it was announced by the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston that the school would remain in Moundsville. The school would be renamed All Saints Catholic School. All Saints operated for two school years (2015 - 2016 and 2016 - 2017) and was a Diocesan school rather than a parish school. It was announced on June 22, 2017 that it would close. All Saints Catholic School served the parishioners of Saint John in Benwood, Saint James in McMechen, Saint Jude in Glen Dale, Saint Francis Xavier in Moundsville, Saint Martin of Tours in Cameron and Saint Joseph in Proctor. Saint James and Saint John School was demolished in August 2015. Saint Catherine School was a Roman Catholic elementary and middle school (first through eighth grade) that was located on Marshall Street in North Benwood. The building, which once stood on the site of the parking lot of the former Pic-way Shoe Store (later the Payless ShoeSource) on Marshall Street, was originally used as a Roman Catholic chapel dedicated to Saint Catherine from 1924 to 1928. It was founded by Croatian immigrants, and it operated as its own parish during those years. In 1929, a school by the same name was opened in the chapel building and continued to operate until Saint Catherine School closed in 1962 at the end of the 1961‚Äì1962 school year. The majority of the students who attended the former Saint John School in Center Benwood (later Saint James and Saint John School) and the former Saint Catherine School in North Benwood went on to attend high school at Bishop Donahue Memorial High School in McMechen, which was founded in 1955. Bishop Donahue High School closed in 2017 at the end of the 2016 - 2017 school year. Mayors The following individuals have served as the mayor of Benwood: * James L.

History= The C√©loron Expedition (1749)  In 1749 French explorer Pierre Joseph C√©loron de Blainville asserts sovereignty of France over the Ohio valley by burying a lead plaque called ¬´ of Point Pleasant ¬ª. In the second half of 1749, the French explorer Pierre Joseph C√©loron de Blainville (1693-1759) claimed French sovereignty over the Ohio Valley, burying a lead plaque at the meeting point of the Ohio and Kanawha Rivers. The text on the plaque is as follows: :L'AN 1749 DV REGNE DE LOVIS XV ROY DE FRANCE, NOVS CELORON, COMMANDANT D'VN DETACHEMENT ENVOIE PAR MONSIEVR LE MIS. DE LA GALISSONIERE, COMMANDANT GENERAL DE LA NOUVELLE FRANCE POVR RETABLIR LA TRAN QUILLITE DANS QUELQUES VILLAGES SAUVAGES DE CES CANTONS, AVONS ENTERRE CETTE PLAQUE AU CONFLUENT DE L'OHIO ET DE TCHADAKOIN CE 29 JVILLET, PRES DE LA RIVIERE OYO AUTREMENT BELLE RIVIERE, POUR MONUMENT DU RENOUVELLEMENT DE POSSESSION QUE NOUS AVONS PRIS DE LA DITTE RIVIERE OYO, ET DE TOUTES CELLE~ QUI Y TOMBENT, ET DE TOUTES LES TERRES DES DEUX COTES JVSQVE AVX SOURCES DES DITTES RIVIERES AINSI QV'EN ONT JOVY OU DV JOVIR LES PRECEDENTS ROIS DE FRANCE, ET QU'ILS S'Y SONT MAINTENVS PAR LES ARMES ET PAR LES TRAIT TES, SPECIALEMENT PAR CEVX DE RISWICK D'VTRECHT ET D'AIX LA CHAPELLE.The C√©loron Plate, one of only two to be recovered among the six placed by C√©loron along the Ohio River during the expedition, is in the collections of the Virginia Historical Society. It was recovered in 1849 after washing out from the river bank; a monument marks the spot today. :(In the year 1749, in the reign of King Louis XV, we, Celoron, commander of a detachment sent by Commander de La Galissoni√®re, Commander General of New France, for the restoration of peace in various untamed villages in the region, have buried this plaque at the confluence of the Ohio and Tchadakoin [Rivers] this 29th day of July near the fine river bank, to commemorate the retaking into possession of the afore-mentioned river bank and all the surrounding lands on both river shores back to the river sources, as secured by previous kings of France, and maintained by force of arms and by treaties, specifically the Treaties of Rijswick, of Utrecht and of Aix la Chapelle) C√©loron's expedition was a diplomatic failure since the local tribes remained pro-English, and English representatives in the region refused to go away. This was, therefore, a prelude to a series of incidents that would lead to the loss of New France and the domination of eastern North America by the British Empire following the defeat of France in the French and Indian War (1754-1763). The expedition can nevertheless be seen in more positive terms as a geographical project, since the C√©loron expedition was the starting point for the first map of the Ohio Valley. The map was the work of the Jesuit Joseph Pierre de Bonnecamps. In 1770, Colonel George Washington visited the confluence that would become Point Pleasant, then proceeded 14 miles up the \\"Great Kanawha\\" and later reported that \\"This Country abounds in Buffalo and Wild game of all kinds as also in all kinds of wild fowl, there being in the Bottoms a great many small grassy Ponds or Lakes which are full of Swans, Geese, and Ducks of different kinds.\\"Cleland Hugh (1955), George Washington in the Ohio Valley; Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, pg 261.  The Battle of Point Pleasant (1774)  In the Battle of Point Pleasant (October 10, 1774), fought on the future site of the town, over one thousand Virginia militiamen, led by Colonel Andrew Lewis (1720‚Äì1781), defeated a roughly equal force of an Algonquin confederation of Shawnee and Mingo warriors led by Shawnee Chief Cornstalk (c. 1720-1777). The event is celebrated locally as the \\"First Battle of the American Revolutionary War\\" and in 1908 the U.S. Senate authorized erection of a local monument to commemorate it as such. Most historians, however, regard it not as a battle of the Revolution (1775‚Äì1783), but as a part of Lord Dunmore's War (1774). Image:The Lord Dunmore.pngStatue of Lord Dunmore at Point Pleasant, in front of the flood wall mural. Image:Dunmore Saga.pngMural with a quotation from Documentary History of Dunmore's War, 1774, edited by Reuben Thwaites (here misspelled \\"Thwaits\\") and Louise Kellogg. Settlement \\"Camp Point Pleasant\\" was established by Col. Lewis at the time of the Battle and the settlement that followed also took that name. Although not certain, Point Pleasant may have been permanently settled by whites as early as 1774. A permanent stockade known as Fort Blair was erected there at about that time. Prior to that, hostilities between whites and Indians all along the Ohio River Valley probably precluded the possibility of settlement in the absence of a substantial stockade.Atkinson, George W. (1876), History of Kanawha County, From its Organization in 1789 until the Present Time, Office of the West Virginia Journal, Charleston, West Virginia. In 1776, a new fort was built on the site of the earlier fort and named for the recently deceased Virginia official Peyton Randolph (1721‚Äì1775). Fort Randolph is best remembered as the place where Chief Cornstalk was murdered in 1777. It withstood attack by Indians the following year, but was abandoned in 1779. George Washington's 1770 journey to the Ohio River Valley had been occasioned by military grants that had been awarded by proclamation in 1754 by Governor Dinwiddie to officers and soldiers who had served in the French and Indian War. The resulting survey encompassed 52,302 acres (or 80 square miles) and was subdivided in the 1780s as follows: 9,876 acres ‚Äî including the present side of Point Pleasant ‚Äî to Andrew Lewis, 5,000 acres for George Muse, 5,000 acres for Peter Hogg, 8,000 acres for Andrew Stephens, another 3,000 acres for Peter Hogg, another 5,026 acres for George Muse, 3,400 acres for Andrew Waggener, 6,000 acres for John Poulson, 6,000 acres for John West. On the lower side of the Kanawha River, 13,532 acres for Hugh Mercer (see Mercers Bottom) and, finally, 10,990 acres for Washington himself. Fort Randolph was rebuilt nearby in 1785 after the renewal of hostilities between the United States government and the Indians, but saw little action and was eventually abandoned once again.Two centuries later, a replica of the fort was built nearby. The settlement at Point Pleasant did not receive an official charter until 1794. 19th century Mason County was carved out of Kanawha County in 1804 and Point Pleasant was designated the county seat at that time. According to historian Virgil A. Lewis, \\"Point Pleasant did not flourish for many years [after the turn of the century]. There was no church for more than fifty years and society was at a low ebb. There was a popular superstition that because of the fiendish murder of Cornstalk there in 1777, the place was laid under a curse for a hundred years\\".Lewis, Virgil A., ed. (1892), Notes to \\"Lewis Summer's Journal of a Tour from Alexandria, Virginia, to Gallipolis, Ohio, in 1808\\", Southern Historical Magazine: Devoted to History, Genealogy, Biography, Arch√¶ology and Kindred Subjects, Vol. 1, No. 2 (February issue), pg 67, n. 59. Lewis also relates that a visitor to Point Pleasant in 1810 observed that ... > Point Pleasant is pleasantly situated immediately above the mouth of the > Great Kanawha, on an extensive and fertile bottom of the Ohio, of which it > has a fine prospect up and down that river. It is the seat of justice of > Mason county Virginia, and contains about 15 or 20 families, a log > courthouse, a log jail and as usual (but unfortunately) in the Virginia > towns, a pillory and whipping post.

(He is > quoting the anonymous 1810 traveler.) Point Pleasant was incorporated in 1833. 20th century Point Pleasant was widely noted for the 1967 collapse of the Silver Bridge, which killed 46 people. On October 10, 1974, Point Pleasant celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Point Pleasant. A replica of Fort Randolph was built in 1973-74 and dedicated as part of the festivities. The town of Point Pleasant was situated over the site of the fort and so the replica is located at Krodel Park, about one mile away.Fort Randolph restoration, from Fort Randolph website National Register of Historic Places The Eastham House, Lewis- Capehart-Roseberry House, and Point Pleasant Battleground are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The central business district and surrounding residential areas are included in the Point Pleasant Historic District. Notable people *Among the early settlers at Point Pleasant was Samuel B. Clemens and his wife Pamela (n√©e Goggin), grandparents of the celebrated author Mark Twain. They had migrated from Campbell County, Virginia and, according to family tradition, Samuel was killed in 1805 by a falling log at a house raising there.Twain's widowed grandmother soon moved on to Kentucky. Twain later gave a similar fate to his character \\"Simon Lathers\\" in The American Claimant (1892) who was \\"crushed by a log at a smoke house raising\\". *Point Pleasant was the final home of Confederate Brigadier-General John McCausland, the next-to-last Confederate General to die. He died at his farm at Grimm's Landing on January 23, 1927, and is buried in nearby Henderson. *Karl Probst, born in Point Pleasant, was an automotive engineer credited in 1940 with the design of the Jeep. *The Shawnee Chief Cornstalk was taken prisoner and later killed by an angry mob at Fort Randolph on 10 November 1777.William Henry Foote, \\"Cornstalk, The Shawnee Chief,\\" The Southern Literary Messenger, Volume 16, Issue 9, pp. 533-540, Richmond, Virginia. 1850.

According to the 2010 census, the city had a population of 968. It was named for Elbert Henry Gary, one of the founders of U.S. Steel. The former coal towns of Elbert, Filbert, Thorpe, and Wilcoe became part of Gary at the time of its incorporation in 1971. History Child coal miners in Gary, 1908. Photo by Lewis Hine. In 1902, U.S. Steel began housing people in Gary Hollow for employment at one of the coal town's fourteen mines that produced metallurgical coal. During the early 1940s, Gary Hollow, named for Elbert Henry Gary, produced around a quarter of the amount of coal mined from McDowell County, as well as a quarter of the coal used by U.S. Steel during World War II. At the time, the town boasted a large number of African American miners and began integrating the school system in the 1950s. However, Gary Hollow's education system was not completely integrated until 1964. On July 1, 1971, the city of Gary was incorporated after the city held an election on March 16, 1970. Beginning in the 1970s, Gary's unemployment rate began to increase after most of the high-quality metallurgical coal had already been mined. In March 1982 alone, around 550 miners employed by U.S. Steel in the town were laid off. By the end of 1982, all U.S. Steel mines located in Gary were closed. Former mayor, Charles Hodge claimed that U.S. Steel failed to make an effort help the city. In March 1983, the unemployment rate rose to 90%, the highest of any town in the United States. Four years later, Gary Enterprise reopened one of the mines after purchasing it from U.S. Steel, and other companies arranged sub-leases to mine the remaining coal that was accessible. In 1990, Gary only had 180 mining jobs. Two years later, the now demolished U.S. Coal and Coke Company Store at Ream was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In July 2003, U.S. Steel announced that they sold their remaining assets to PinnOak Resources.

The population was 282 at the 2010 census. Keystone is one of few municipalities in West Virginia with an African-American majority, with 65 percent of the residents being black.

Home in the McDowell County Coalfields: The African-American Population of Keystone, West Virginia (M.A., Geography thesis). Ohio University. Keystone possessed a unique combination of political, social, and economic characteristics that made it an attractive place for African-Americans to migrate to in the late 1800s and early 1900s. History Keystone was founded in 1892 by the Keystone Coal & Coke Company. Keystone was then incorporated in 1909 by the Circuit Court of McDowell County. Its name is derived from the name of the coal and coke company operating at that point. The city was formerly known as Cassville. On May 1, 1895, 15,000 union miners (predominantly black) assembled in Keystone and armed themselves, planning to march across the state line to Virginia in order to force the Virginia miners in one bordering mine (also predominantly black) to unionize. The governor of Virginia, Charles O'Ferrall ordered an artillery company and six infantry companies to the Va border, but WV Governor William MacCorkle refused repeated requests from O'Ferrall to reciprocate. This was in response to the N&W; Railroad lowering the minimum price guarantee on coal shipped to Tidewater ports. The operators reduced wages by 20% in response and encouraged their miners to strike. By the end of April that year, the mines on the WV side had completely shut down, but a large mine across the state line in Virginia continued to operate. The strike collapsed by the end of August. The UMWA was a relatively young union, and could not support a strike of this magnitude. In the end, most of the mines resumed operations with mostly imported strikebreakers.Black Coal Miners in America: Race, Class, and Community Conflict 1780-1980, Ronald L.

The population was 2,406 at the 2010 census. Incorporated as a city in 1893, it is the county seat of McDowell County. History Welch was incorporated in 1893 and named after Isaiah A. Welch, a former captain in the Confederate States Army who came to the region as a surveyor, and helped establish the plan for the beginning of a new town at the confluence of Tug Fork and Elkhorn Creek. Welch was made the county seat of McDowell County in an election by county citizens in 1892 even before Welch was incorporated as a city. The previous county seat was in Perryville (now English) on present day West Virginia Route 83 along the Dry Fork. Results of the election were contested so to avoid violence county records were secretly moved from Perryville to Welch at night in two wagons by James A. Strother and Trigg Tabor. On March 2, 1921, the Welch City Council met to discuss impeachment of then Mayor J. H. Whitt. Whitt showed up at the meeting and disrupted the proceedings. The Welch City Council then asked the McDowell Co. Sheriff's Dept. to investigate Whitt. Later that same day, Mayor Whitt shot and killed McDowell County Deputy Sheriff William Johnson Tabor who was investigating the matter. Mayor Whitt was arrested and charged with murder but won acquittal at his trial (allegedly based on perjured testimony). Whitt left the area for parts unknown on September 27, 1921. Child laborer at Welch Mining Company, 1908. Photo by Lewis Hine. Saturday afternoon in Welch (1946) On August 1, 1921, detectives from the Baldwin‚ÄìFelts Detective Agency assassinated Matewan Police Chief Sid Hatfield as well as Ed Chambers at the McDowell County Courthouse located in Welch. In the first half of the 20th century during the opening of railroads and coal mines throughout the region, Welch became a prosperous city: the hub of retail business for a county approaching 100,000 in population, and the location for three hospitals. After the production boom of World War II, oil began to supplant coal in many areas of domestic fuel supply. Mechanization of coal mining reduced the number of laborers needed in coal production. McDowell County's population peaked in 1950, and began a decline over decades to follow. In 1960, however, McDowell County still ranked number one in the United States in total coal production. The City of Welch proudly proclaimed itself \\"The Heart of the Nation's Coal Bin.\\" When presidential candidate John F. Kennedy visited Welch by automobile caravan in 1960, he saw a city whose businesses were struggling due to a growing poverty rate throughout the county. What Kennedy learned here during his campaign for the 1960 West Virginia primary was believed to be the basis of the aid brought to the Appalachian region by the Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson administrations. During a speech in Canton, Ohio on September 27, 1960, he stated \\"McDowell County mines more coal than it ever has in its history, probably more coal than any county in the United States and yet there are more people getting surplus food packages in McDowell County than any county in the United States. The reason is that machines are doing the jobs of men, and we have not been able to find jobs for those men.\\" The first recipients of modern era food stamps were the Chloe and Alderson Muncy family of Paynesville, McDowell County. Their household included fifteen persons. On May 29, 1961, in the City of Welch, as a crowd of reporters witnessed the proceedings, Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman delivered $95 of federal food stamps to Mr. and Mrs. Muncy. This was the first issuance of federal food stamps under the Kennedy Administration, and it was the beginning of a rapidly expanding program of federal assistance that would be legislated in the \\"War on Poverty.\\" In the 1960s and 1970s, McDowell County coal continued to be a major source of fuel for the steel and electric power generation industries. As United States steel production declined, however, McDowell County suffered further losses. In 1986, the closure of the US Steel mines in nearby Gary, led to an immediate loss of more than 1,200 jobs. In the following year alone, personal income in McDowell County decreased dramatically by two-thirds. Real estate values also plummeted. Miners were forced to abandon their homes in search for new beginnings in other regions of the country. In 2006, the city received national attention when it, along with Police Chief Robert K. Bowman were the defendants in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU after Bowman allegedly prevented rescuers from providing CPR to a gay man suffering cardiac arrest. After the wrongful death claim was allowed to proceed, the lawsuit was settled for an undetermined amount. In recent years, Welch has attracted the construction of new state and federal prisons which are creating some sources of economic renewal. The city has begun restoration of its historic downtown area. Welch has been the celebrated location of an annual Veteran's Day Parade which over the decades has attracted a distinguished list of speakers, including Presidents Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson. The McDowell County Courthouse and Welch Commercial Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Firsts Municipal parking building in Welch The first public children's playground in West Virginia was built in Welch in 1913. It was constructed using private donations and after 1918 was maintained by the Young Women's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church. The playground sat across the street from the McDowell County Courthouse until 1930 when it became the site for the United States Post Office.Progressive West Virginians, Wheeling Intelligencer, 1923, page 409. Welch was the location of the first memorial building in the United States dedicated to the memory of Americans who gave their lives for their country in World War I, and to honor the veterans of that war. It was dedicated on May 30, 1923. The building was destroyed by fire. The historic site is now an empty lot near the county courthouse. In 1928, Welch resident Minnie Buckingham Harper became the first black woman legislator in the United States. Harper was appointed by the Governor to the West Virginia House of Delegates to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband. Welch also built the first municipally owned parking building in the United States, which was opened September 1, 1941. It accommodated 232 cars and showed a profit its first year in operation. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Periodic flooding of the Elkhorn and Tug Fork rivers has plagued the future prosperity of the city. Most notably, the record flooding in 2001 and 2002 nearly destroyed Welch altogether. Flood reduction projects to prevent further destruction in the future are presently in progress. The town is a railway station on the Norfolk Southern Railway (former Norfolk and Western) network.

History The European-American history of Bluefield began in the 18th century, when two families settled in a rugged and remote part of what is now southern West Virginia. Others joined them and they built a small village with a mill, a church, a one-room schoolhouse, and a fort for defending the settlement against invasions by the Shawnee Indian tribe, which had a village on the banks of the Bluestone River. In 1882, the descendants of the Davidson and Bailey family sold a portion of their land, when Captain John Fields of the Norfolk and Western Railway pioneered the area and began building a new railroad through the hills of Bluefield. The city is traditionally thought to be named after the chicory flowers in the area, which give the fields a purplish blue hue during the summer. Research has shown that this settlement, also known as Higginbotham's Summit in the 1880s, was probably named for the coal fields that were developed in the area of the Bluestone River. Coal rush Beneath the land of the Davidsons and Baileys lay the largest and richest deposit of bituminous coal in the world. The first seam was discovered in nearby Pocahontas, Virginia in the backyard of Jordan Nelson. President Frederick Kimball of the Norfolk and Western Railway described this as the \\"most spectacular find on the continent and indeed perhaps of the entire planet.\\" The coal seam had been mentioned much earlier in Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia, but it was not mined until 1890. Around that time, coal mines were developed in the area around Harman, Bluefield, War, and Pocahontas, which together were known as the Pocahontas Coal Fields. They helped support the Industrial Revolution in the United States. The development of the coal industry in this area created a boom in the local and national economy, and attracted immigrant European workers and enslaved/ migrant African Americans from the Deep South to the mountains in search of industrial work. During the Great War and World War II, coal from this area supplied the navies of the United States and United Kingdom. In the late 19th century, the Norfolk and Western Company selected Bluefield as the site for its headquarters and repair center, which greatly stimulated the town's growth. In the one-year period from 1887 to 1888, passenger travel along the railroad increased 317%. As with the extremely accelerated growth of San Francisco during the gold rush, Bluefield became a city that seemed to spring up \\"overnight.\\" Growth far outpaced the existing infrastructure. Urban sprawl and blight were common complaints in the early days, as workers crowded into aging housing. The growth and decay of the city depended almost entirely upon Norfolk and Western Railroad. When coal tonnage was good and the market for coal was booming, Bluefield was essentially a \\"Little New York,\\" as it was called in the day. A bustling metropolis, it had a nightlife and a personality that was \\"a little bit Chicago, a little bit New York, and a whole lot of Pittsburgh\\"‚Äîrugged and with steel and coal embedded in its soul. The coal boom generated a flood of money in the area. Nearby Bramwell, incorporated in 1888, boasted that it was the \\"Millionaires' Town\\" because more millionaires per capita lived there than anywhere in the nation. The city also had more automobiles per capita than any other city in the country. In 1889, the city of Bluefield was officially incorporated. With a strong ethnic community, Bluefield was the site of the 1895 founding of the Bluefield Colored Institute, an historically black college. It developed as today's Bluefield State College. 20th century During the 1920s, the twelve-story West Virginian Hotel was built. It has been adapted and in the 21st century is operated as the West Virginia Manor and Retirement Home. In 1924, nearby Graham, Virginia decided to rename itself as Bluefield to try to unite the two towns, which had been feuding since the civil war. Nobel Prize-winning economist and mathematician John Forbes Nash was born in Bluefield in 1928. George Marshall Palmer, the well-renowned Purdue University Professor of aeronautics and director of the AerospaceSciences Laboratory at Purdue, lead of the invention of the Boeing wind tunnel and a pioneer in the aerodynamic and structural testing of skyscrapers https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/jconline/obituary.aspx?pid=191945140 was born in Bluefield in 1921. The Great Depression was particularly damaging to Bluefield. With the government nearly bankrupt, after a series of devastating structural fires swept through the downtown area, the city was nearly destroyed. It was not until the outbreak of World War II that coal production revived. The strategic importance of the city was so great that Adolf Hitler put Bluefield on his reputed list of German air raid targets in the United States. Air raid practice drills were common in the city during this time. The Interstate Highway System was constructed through East River Mountain on December 20, 1974; for the first time automobile traffic could reach the city without crossing the top of the mountain. The dependence on the railroads waned and restructuring changed the industry. Bluefield lost jobs and population as a result. Its Amtrak station closed in the 1980s. Mercer Mall, the area's major shopping mall, opened in 1980.

The population was 726 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Bluefield, WV-VA micropolitan area which has a population of 107,342.  History  The first record of continuous European settlement of the Montcalm area is the 1840 census of Mercer County in what was then the state of Virginia.Schreiner-Yanits, Netti. 1840 Census of Mercer County Virginia. On file at the West Virginia University Library A 700-acre farm, located where Crane Creek joins the Bluestone, was the property of George Bailey. He, his wife, and six children lived on the farm that included a farmhouse, likely located on the lower slopes of Tabernacle Mountain, an orchard and in what would be today's Main Street, and a field of timothy grass. About one hundred acres of corn field could be found at the top of a mountain on \\"the opposite side of the river\\" (either Methodist Church Hill or Browning Lambert Mountain). The farm also featured a small dam on the Crane Creek that powered a corn grist mill, the only one in the area and the farm's most valuable property.https://books.google.com/books/about/With_the_border_ruffians.html?id=4r49hc9yrCoC The Bailey family occupied this farm until 1852 when, in preparation for a move to the West, they sold their considerable estate and all of what would one day be the village of Montcalm for $1,500 to Robert Williams, a recently arrived retired sailor from the British Navy. Williams wrote and published his experiences in Mercer County and in the events that led up to the Civil War in Kansas in a memoir published in 1908 titled With the Border Ruffians, which is the earliest narrative of life in Montcalm's Bluestone Valley. Williams wrote about meeting the leaders of the early Mercer County communities, a court day in Princeton, a church camp meeting in what would one day be Glenwood Park, hunting in the hills around the Bluestone, community dances and several threats to his life while homesteading on the former Bailey Farm. After several legal disputes in which he was largely not at fault, Williams sold the farm for $2,000 to the Herndon family, a slave-holding clan who owned a neighboring farm. According to West Virginia historian Kyle McCormick, descendants of the family lived in Montcalm a century later.McCormick, K. The Story of Mercer County According to local tradition, the name of the town that grew up around the former Bailey Farm was first identified as \\"Riverside\\". As it grew with the coming of first local coal mines and then railway lines, it was decided to place a local post office in the town circa 1910. It was then discovered that there was already a town in the state having a post office with the Riverside name and it was necessary to choose a new name. Undocumented tradition states that a group of local schoolchildren, when asked to help select a new town name, selected \\"Montcalm\\" as they had just completed their study of the French and Indian War, wherein Louis-Joseph de Montcalm had been the commander of the French forces in North America, and they liked the name. In 1924 an enormous rainstorm resulted in the collapse of the mountainside along Crane Creek, causing a flash flood to inundate Montcalm and its neighboring town of McComas. An explosion of a mining ash and debris dump was touched off by the storm and began a mudslide that covered the train track in fifteen feet of mud and debris. Eight people were killed in what became known as the Catastrophe of Crane Creek.McCormick, K. The Story of Mercer County. At some point in the 19th century the first formal school in the Montcalm area, known as the Mullins School, was established on Browning Lambert Mountain.\\"W.Va.

History=Coal and Southern West Virginia In southern West Virginia, in the late 19th century, coal mining and transportation by the emerging technology of the railroads combined to form a new industry. Much of the region's bituminous coal was sent northwest to the Great Lakes, or northeast to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's coal piers at Baltimore, or to the world's greatest ice-free port of Hampton Roads in eastern Virginia. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway's coal piers were located at Newport News. Across the harbor, the Norfolk and Western Railway's coal piers were located on the Elizabeth River in Norfolk. The eastern-bound coal transported by the C&O; and the N&W; railroads was highly valued for local use and for steam-powered ships, notably those of the U.S. Navy. Loaded into large ships called colliers, the West Virginia \\"smokeless coal\\" was sent in coast-wise shipping to the Northeastern U.S. points such as New York City and New England, as well as exported to other countries worldwide. Princeton's location was east of the primary coalfields, and most of the coal mining and railroad activity was initially elsewhere. However, a combination of factors would soon change that, and have profound financial and developmental impact on Princeton. William Nelson Page According to local folklore, in the early 1870s, a young civil engineer named William Nelson Page came to West Virginia to help survey and build Collis P. Huntington's C&O; railroad through the valleys of the New River and the Kanawha River to link Virginia with the Ohio River, a line which was completed in 1873 at the new city of Huntington. As his career developed, Page busied himself with many enterprises to develop the natural resources which lay all around him, primarily working with iron and coal operations, often as the manager for wealthy absentee owners. Among these was David T. Ansted, a British geologist who mapped many of the coalfields of southern West Virginia. Dr. Ansted became the namesake for the town of Ansted, where William Nelson Page moved and became his prot√©g√©. Of course, with his background with the C&O;, Page was also heavily involved in railroads. Page settled with his family in the Fayette County hamlet of Ansted, located high above the New River Valley along the old James River and Kanawha Turnpike. As president of the Gauley Mountain Coal Company, in 1890, he had company carpenters build a palatial white Victorian mansion on a knoll overlooking the town. Eight servants were employed to care for the family, which included his wife Emma, and their four children. \\"Colonel\\" Page, as he became known, was in truth a uniformed major in a locally recruited Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War militia. (\\"Colonel\\" was an honorific title used informally in the South for many notable men in the years following the American Civil War). A colorful character by all accounts, he was described as a slight man who was known for his handlebar mustache, pince-nez glasses, iron bowler derby, and elegant suits. He was considered to be somewhat aloof by the local population, and could frequently be seen riding a bicycle on the sloping lawn of the mansion. He found time to serve as a mayor of Ansted for ten years, rose to the rank of brigadier inspector general in the West Virginia National Guard, and was also an incorporator and director of Sheltering Arms Hospital in neighboring Kanawha County. However, William Nelson Page's consuming interest was his work. He was described by former West Virginia governor William A. MacCorkle in his autobiography The Recollections of Fifty Years as a man who knew the geology of the area \\"as a farmer knows a field.\\" Page spent long hours working in the den just off the main entrance to his resplendent home. As he studied the areas mapped out by Dr. Ansted as containing coal, he became fascinated with some of the most rugged terrain of southern West Virginia, and the fact that these lands were not yet reached by the major railroads. Years later, author and photographer H. Reid, who wrote The Virginian Railway (Kalmbach, 1961), labeled him the \\"Idea Man from Ansted.\\" 1902: Deepwater Railway In 1896, Page developed the Loup Creek and Deepwater Railway, a logging railroad connecting a small sawmill on the old Loup Creek Estate at Robson with the C&O; railroad's main line at Deepwater on the Kanawha River. In 1898, it was rechartered as the Deepwater Railway, with modest plans to extend to nearby coal mines at Glen Jean. Around 1903, the new town of Page became the location of one if the earliest stations on the expanding Deepwater Railway, as well as home of the Page Coal and Coke Company. In 1902, William Page enlisted the support of millionaire industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers as a silent partner to finance the expansion of the Deepwater Railway much further, about 80 miles through Mullens to reach a N&W; railroad branch line at Matoaka to open up new territory with untapped deposits of high volatile bituminous coal. Page, Rogers, and other wealthy investors owned much of this land. Rogers was a self-made man who had become a principal in John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. Even after he was well-off financially, Henry Rogers continued to be what was many years later termed \\"a workaholic\\". He was an active developer of all types of natural resources and transportation enterprises. Soon, he had investments of his own in natural gas, copper, steel, coal, and railroad industries. By 1899, he had become one of the richest men in the United States. Henry Rogers was also an old hand at West Virginia short line railroads. He had helped build and sell several earlier enterprises which were initially not a great deal different than those proposed by Page. Overcoming collusion of the big railroads However, as construction of the expanded Deepwater Railway line got underway, William Page found he was unsuccessful in negotiating fair rates to interchange traffic with either major railroad, nor in interesting them in buying his short line railroad. This was later revealed to be caused by collusion by the leaders of the big railroads, notably Alexander Cassatt, William Kissam Vanderbilt, and Frederick J. Kimball, who sought to control shipping rates and coal prices, and prevent any newcomers from entry. They assumed that any entrepreneurs of modest means, such as William Page appeared to be, would become discouraged and give up. In their experience, building costly enterprises such as railroads customarily meant raising large sums of money through public stock offerings and bonds. As construction on the Deepwater Railway continued, William Page's continued efforts to establish reasonable joint rates with the big railroads continued to prove fruitless. To the puzzlement of the leaders of the big railroads, who were unaware of Rogers' financial backing, Page (and Rogers) did not give up. Instead, they quietly expanded their plans again to build to the Virginia state line. This expansion brought right-of-way for the planned the Deepwater Railway through Mercer County and Princeton. 1904: Tidewater Railway In Virginia, Page (and Rogers) formed another intrastate railroad, the new Tidewater Railway, which was legally based in Staunton, a city located along the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;). Notwithstanding its corporate location on the C&O;, agents for the new Tidewater Railway quietly surveyed and secured rights-of-way many miles away from the C&O; across southern Virginia, roughly paralleling the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;). With the help of Rogers' fortune, they were successful, even in the City of Roanoke, where the N&W; had its corporate headquarters and major shops. From Roanoke, the new line ran almost due east, missing major cities and towns, to reach Suffolk. With the help of local leaders in Norfolk, (and more funds from Rogers), a route was obtained set which passed around the City of Norfolk (and the N&W;) in a wide, 13-mile long circular path through rural Norfolk County to be headed almost due west again when it reached the site for a new coal pier on the harbor at Hampton Roads at Sewell's Point. By the time the leaders of the big railroads finally realized that the Deepwater and Tidewater railroads were related, the rights-of-way were secure, and the new competitor could not be blocked. In 1906, N&W; president Lucius E. Johnson was brought to the Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway in New York City by Andrew Carnegie to meet with one of Carnegie's old friends: Henry Huttleston Rogers. N&W; corporate records only record that the meeting lasted only a few minutes. Thus, the leaders of the big railroads finally learned the source of William Nelson Page's deep pockets. Despite their collusion, there would be new player in their games. 1907: Virginian Railway is born In 1907, The Deepwater and Tidewater were combined to become the Virginian Railway (VGN). Victoria, a new town created in Lunenburg County, Virginia, became the Division Headquarters east of Roanoke. Using more modern techniques than had been available to the older major railroads during the 19th century, and the Rogers fortune to build to the highest standards and acquire the finest equipment and rolling stock, it was widely considered an engineering marvel of the times when completed all the way from Deepwater to reach a port near Norfolk, Virginia on Hampton Roads in 1909, a distance of about 450 miles. Virginian Railway: Division headquarters and Shops Princeton was designated to be the headquarters of the New River Division, extending from Roanoke westward. Roundhouses, vital for servicing the new steam locomotives, were established at Sewell's Point, Victoria, Roanoke, and Page. Princeton became site of the VGN's major shops and yards. Throughout its lifetime, the largest number of Virginian Railway employees were concentrated at Princeton. In the 1930s, the VGN even added the capacity to build railroad cars to the Princeton Shops. The tiny Class 1 railroad was very profitable and became known as the \\"Richest Little Railroad in the World.\\" Of course, the VGN's more modern gradient and facilities and profitability were all coveted by the competition. There were many attempts to acquire it. All failed throughout the first half of the 20th century. Finally, as the Interstate Commerce Commission began to realize that railroads needed to be able to compete successfully with trucking and other modes of transportation more than primarily each other, in 1959, the Norfolk and Western succeeded in reaching a merge with the VGN and gaining regulatory approvals, marking what became called the \\"modern merger era\\" in North American railroading which eventually resulted in Princeton's current service by Norfolk Southern Railway, one of only 6 large class 1 railroads operating in the United States in the 21st century. The changes from steam to diesel- electric motive power and the mergers and consolidations resulted in elimination of many shops and jobs, aggravated by a reduction in coal mining activity in West Virginia. Eventually, all but a few of these jobs in Princeton were eliminated by the late 20th century. The N&W; (and later NS) maintained coal piers and export facilities at a major facility near downtown Norfolk known as Lambert's Point. After the 1959 merger, the VGN's former coal piers and yards at Sewell's Point were redundant with the Lambert's Point operations. They were eventually shut down, and the land became part of the massive U.S. Naval Station Norfolk, the largest Navy base in the world. Most of the unused former VGN Princeton Shops facilities were demolished by 2006. The local residents of Princeton were devastated. However, despite the community's loss, a new replica of the VGN's two-story Princeton Passenger Station and Offices had been recently built, the largest such effort in the entire state. A modern structure functionally, while appearing like the original built 100 about years earlier, the new Princeton Station Museum should last for future generations. It hosts a museum to the town's rich railroading heritage and the Virginian Railway. In the tiny hamlet of Ansted along the Midland Trail, the Page-Vawter House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

History = Earliest inhabitants  Native Americans were known to have made many incursions into the Patterson Creek Valley in which nestles the quiet village of Fort Ashby. Shawnee warriors claimed sections of the lower valley as choice camping grounds on which they stopped and rested in going to and from their great hunts. There are at least two distinctly well defined Native American trails leading into the community. One, from the North Branch Potomac River, across the mountain into Short Gap, also used later by George Washington when crossing the mountains, and the other coming in from Dan's Run over Valley Ridge. There are many Native American graves around Fort Ashby in different places where small skirmishes are supposed to have taken place. Native Americans first interred in what is now the Fort Ashby Community Cemetery, or somewhere near. There is scarcely a spot in the community outside the immediate village where some visible trace of the Native American has not been found, and in several places within the limits of the community, darts and arrowheads can be picked up in small quantities. Native American activities in Fort Ashby seem to have been centered against the early white settlers. Tribal differences of various natures seem to have been few and easily settled so that the combined efforts of all was directed toward keeping out the 'pale face' who was ruining the hunting ground. All during the period of agitation between the French and Indian and American Revolutionary Wars the families of Frankfort, as it was then referred, seem to have been jeopardized by the French and Native Americans from the Ohio River Valley.  18th century  The first fort at the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers was built by men from Hampshire County, West Virginia. Part of these men came from the Frankfort District along Patterson Creek, likely Frankfort, as it was more thickly settled than any other section at that time. Captain William Trent was in command of the company. He did not finish the fort, however, as the French captured it before completion and named it Fort Duquesne. Colonel Joshua Fry took command of part of Trent's men and came back with them east of Uniontown, Pennsylvania, where they started to build Fort Necessity. After Frye died during the construction, George Washington finished the fort. About the year 1755 or 1756, the old Native American Chief Killbuck with his warriors from Muskingum River Valley, Ohio, came across the Allegheny Mountains and attacked the settlers in Patterson Creek Valley. It was on this expedition that Killbuck became prominent by his bloody murder of Mr. Williams and Wendell Miller. The carrying away of John Casey also occurred at the same time. In 1755, Colonel George Washington gave orders to build a stockade and fort (Fort Ashby) on the eastern side of Patterson Creek. This was built at the present site of Fort Ashby village and it is now a museum ran by Friends of Ashby‚Äôs Fort. On Christmas Day 1755, Captain Charles Lewis of Fredericksburg took command of the fort and a garrison of twenty-one men. He had orders from Colonel Washington to remain quiet as long as he could and to hold the fort as long as possible, but if necessary rather than surrender it to burn it and try to get to Fort Sellars, located on the east side of the mouth of Patterson Creek, or to Fort Cumberland. In 1756, Washington ordered Colonel Adam Stephen at Fort Cumberland to keep forts Ashby and Sellars completely supplied with food and ammunition. The only really important battle at Fort Ashby occurred in 1756 when Lieutenant Robert Rutherford and his company of rangers was defeated there by a band of French and Native Americans. After the French had gone from the vicinity the Native Americans remained watching for the inmates of the fort. It was during this siege that Colonel John Ashby while out of the fort on what is now Cemetery Hill was attacked by the Native Americans and made a most remarkable escape to the fort. It is from this incident that the name of \\"Ashby's Fort\\" was applied. Colonel Ashby was later put in command of the fort and seems to have remained there until the Revolutionary War or after. On April 22, 1756, Washington wrote to Ashby that if he was attacked by Native Americans to wait for the cover of darkness then blow up the fort and retreat to Fort Cumberland, taking what ammunition they could. In the same year he wrote to Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia as follows: \\"The people are all leaving the section around Frankfort in fear of the Indians and fear that in a short time it will be as desolate as all Hampshire County.\\" Since there is a lapse of about two years for which no records of any kind have been found it is presumed that practically all settlers were driven out of what is now Mineral County except those who were protected by forts Ashby and Sellars. In a later letter to Lieutenant Governor Dinwiddie, Washington said: \\"The men I hired to bring intelligence from the South Branch returned last night with letters from Captain Ashby and other parties there. The Indians have gone. It is believed their numbers were, about one hundred and fifty, that about seventy men are killed or missing and that several houses and plantations were destroyed. I shall proceed by quick marches to Fort Cumberland to strengthen the garrison there. Besides this I think it is absolutely necessary to have two or three companies of rangers to guard the Potomac waters. Captain Wagner informs me that it was with difficulty that he passed the Blue Ridge as crowds of people were fleeing as if a lost moment would mean death. He endeavored to stop them, but in vain, as they believed that all homes were in flames.\\" Captain Wagner was a citizen of Frankfort. It is really a question as to whether or not the first settlers of Frankfort community may have laid claim to the land of that immediate vicinity even before the Native Americans became much interested in it. It is known that white settlers came into the Patterson Creek Valley around Frankfort between the years 1732 and 1736. The names of Casey, Pancake, Foreman, and Van Meter were familiar before the prominence of George Washington. Following the grant of land, from the British Crown to Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron known as the Northern Neck of Virginia, some settlers may have come to Frankfort as renters. Before Washington's survey, however, the immediate land around the village had been taken by people on the grounds of the Tomahawk Claim. In his journals of \\"My Journeys Across the Mountain,\\" Washington said that he stayed all night on March 28, 1748, with Abram Johnson on Patterson Creek, and on the following day, marched fifteen miles (24 km) to one Solomon Hedges, and when he came to supper, on the table was neither cloth, nor knife, nor fork. Abram Johnson lived a short distance south of Frankfort village. Up until the time of the American Revolutionary War there does not seem to have been very many new families moving into the lower part of the Valley. The Johnsons and Van Meters seem to have been the leading citizens and largest land owners. Just about the beginning of the War, however, new names became prominent in the community; among them are Tay-lor, Lynn, Williams, and Powell. We find that history records very little about Frankfort with regard to the American Revolutionary War. That entire section of country bordering on the Potomac and Monongahela rivers was known as the back door of the Revolution. Frankfort was right in the heart of this section. The reason why we see so little mentioned from this section of Virginia in the story of the Revolution is that the men were kept busy watching the Indians. In 1777, Captain William Foreman gathered together from Hampshire County a company of men to keep down the Native Americans who had been agitated by the British. He marched with them to Wheeling and there met the Native Americans at the McMechen Narrows where he was defeated. A monument now marks the spot where Foreman's defeat occurred on WV 28 between Springfield and Romney. Men from Frankfort who were in Foreman's Company were Samuel Johnson, John Willison, and William Lynn. Captain Michael Cresap who lived in Oldtown, Maryland across from Green Spring, came over into Hampshire County during the early part of the Revolution and organized a company of riflemen. They marched to Boston and featured in several small skirmishes there. Cressap returned with them as far as New York where he died and was buried. The men in this company from Frankfort include the names of Johnson, Ashby, Wagoner, Williams, Powell, Pew, Harris, and Miller. Cresaptown, Maryland is named for him. Immediately after the close of the war, Frankfort seems to have developed rapidly. Many new settlers came, including the names of Keller, Richards, Brockhart, and Daniels. It was about this time that the brick house now occupied by Mrs. Blanche Welker and also the old stone hotel were built. Both buildings were used as hotels, replacing the old roadhouse which was located near where Charles Pyles now lives, and the tavern at Short Gap, to some extent.  Establishment of Frankfort  Through the influence of several men of the village, particularly Dennis Daniels, one hundred and thirty-nine acres of land belonging to John Kellar was surveyed into town lots with streets and alleys running between. A charter was passed through the Virginia General Assembly on December 5, 1787, a copy of which follows: 1\\\\. Be it enacted by the general assembly, that one hundred and thirty-nine acres of land, in the county of Hampshire, the property of John Kellar, and laid off by him into in and out lots, with convenient streets, shall be, and the same is hereby established, a town by the name of Frankfort, and that John Mitchell, Andrew Cooper, Ralph Humphries, John Williams, Sen. James Clark, Richard Stafford, Hezekiah Whiteman, and Jacob Brookhart, gentlemen, be trustees thereof, who, or the major part of them, shall have power, from time to time, to settle and determine all disputes concerning the bounds of said lots, and to establish such rules and regulations for the regular building of houses thereon, as to them shall seem best. In case of the death, resignation, removal out of the county, or other legal disability of one or more of the said trustees, it shall be lawful for the remaining trustees, to supply such vacancy, and the person so chosen shall have the same power as if he had been particularly named in this act. 2\\\\. And be it further enacted, that so many of the lots in the said town as are not sold by the said John Kellar are hereby vested in the said trustees, and they, or a majority of them, shall within six months after the passing of this act, sell the lots at public auction, having previously advertised the time and place of such sale at the court house of said county, on three successive court days, and convey the same to the purchaser in fee, subject to the conditions of building a house on each, sixteen feet square, with a brick or stone chimney, to be finished fit for habitation within three years from the date of sale, and pay the money arising from such sale to the said John Kellar, or his legal representatives. So soon as the purchaser of said lots shall have built thereon according to their respective deeds of conveyance, they shall then be entitled to, and have and enjoy all the rights, privileges, and immunities, which the freeholder and inhabitants of other towns in this state, not incorporated, hold and enjoy. If the purchaser of any lot sold by the said trustees shall fail to build thereon within the time limited, it shall be lawful for the said trustees, or a majority of them, to enter into such lot, sell the same again, and apply the money for the benefit of the inhabitants of the said town.  Early commerce  Some of the lots were sold and built upon according to the provisions of the charter. Many were not sold in the time provided but later were sold at public auction under a deed of trust. They were bought by Joseph Inskeep who still had hopes that the city of Frankfort would mature. Inskeep was so strong in his belief that he donated four lots in the center of the village to be used for the good of the public when the city did develop. This tract is known today, as the Public Square and on it stands Evan‚Äôs Dairy Dip, The Corner Bistro and Vintage Market, The Fort Ashby Volunteer Fire Company, and an old unoccupied building. From the time of the establishment of the town of Frankfort for many years this was the trading center of the entire country side. Before the completion of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Frankfort was on the direct route from Winchester to Wheeling over which hundreds of tons of merchandise passed monthly. It was the long wagon trains passing over this route that furnished business for two hotels in Frankfort. Many times has the Public Square been crowded overnight with canvas covered wagons loaded with valuable merchandise. Samuel Brady was probably the first merchant of any importance in Frankfort. He operated a large chain of stores, one of which was located here years before the American Civil War. It is said that almost any article asked for could be bought there. People are known to have traded with him regularly from Keyser and above and also from what is now Ridgeley when the North Branch Potomac River could not be forded to Cumberland.

It is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 5,439 at the 2010 census.  History  Keyser, the county seat of Mineral County, is located on the North Branch of the Potomac River at its juncture with New Creek in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. Throughout the centuries, the town went through a series of name changes, but was ultimately named after William Keyser, a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad official.  The Early Days: Paddy Town  The first Europeans to pass through what would become present-day Keyser are believed to have been William Mayo and George Savage, sent by Lord Fairfax in 1736 to seek out the source of the Potomac River. The first local land grant was issued by Fairfax to Christopher Beelor on March 20, 1752. The place was first called Paddy Town, for Patrick McCarty, an Irish immigrant who came to then-Hampshire County, Virginia, sometime after 1740. Eventually, a community developed, which was also known as \\"the Irish Settlement.\\" Initially a peaceful village, Paddy Town came under repeated Indian attacks after Major General Edward Braddock's defeat west of Paddy Town by French and Indian forces in 1755. The Paddy Towners built stockades and blockhouses to protect themselves. In 1762, Patrick McCarty was killed by a band of Indians while harvesting crops. Patrick McCarty's son, Edward McCarty, was an enterprising fellow who put Paddy Town on the map after his father's death. Among other things, he built an iron furnace and foundry and a salt well, near present-day Armstrong Street. According to an 1851 newspaper article, during the Revolutionary War, \\"there were extensive borings for salt at Paddytown, on the Virginia side of the Potomac, and that after reaching a depth of 600 feet, the supply of salt water was abundant, from which large quantities of this article was manufactured.\\" The Paddy Town, Virginia, post office was established on October 30, 1811. The McCarty family built a stone house in 1815, still standing today at Keys Street in Keyser. A travel guide described the town in these formative years: > Paddytown, Va. post office vacant 1835. Is a small, romantic village, 214 > miles from Richmond and 135 miles Northwest from Washington. Has 6 dwelling > houses, 1 mercantile store, 1 manufacturing flour mill, and in immediate > vicinity 1 forge and iron furnace. Romantic scenery, especially Slim Bottom > Hill (Queen's Point). Lands in immediate vicinity belong to James Singleton. As the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&O; Canal) was constructed alongside the Potomac, from Washington, DC, to Cumberland, Maryland, a resident of the Potomac valley wrote to the editors of the National Intelligencer in Washington in 1837, seeking to make a sale: > At a place called Paddy Town, the residence of the late Col. Edward McCarty, > on the North branch, 25 miles above Cumberland, stands an excellent furnace > and forge, for making iron, now idle for want of capital and skill to work > them. These may be said to stand in the great coal region of the Potomack, > or so near that the coal can be delivered at them for 3 cents per bushel. > Col. McCarty, who built them, and who was a man of great enterprise, failed > by attempting too much at once without sufficient skill. The C&O; Canal was originally planned to reach the Ohio River, but it never made it as far as Paddy Town, let alone the Ohio, overtaken by a railroad and stopping as far west as Cumberland. Paddy Town fell into decline by 1844, when the original post office closed. Then, in 1852, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, in search of a path through the Alleghenies, arrived, giving the town an economic boost. The Paddy Town post office was re-established that year, with Edward Hitchcock McDonald as postmaster. McDonald's wife Cornelia Peak McDonald was an educated socialite from the city of Alexandria, Virginia, and thought the name \\"Paddy Town\\" was \\"unaesthetic and wholly unacceptable.\\" Through her persistent lobbying, the Post Office Department renamed the town's post office Wind Lea, Virginia, in 1855. Mrs. McDonald's literary flourish for the post office did not stick to the town. Sometime between 1855 and the start of the Civil War, the townsfolk renamed the village New Creek Station, after the creek that runs by it. This decision was supposedly \\"by common consent\\" to give the town a \\"more dignified\\" name.  The Civil War: New Creek  In 1861, the American Civil War came to New Creek Station in then-Hampshire County, Virginia. The Union established Fort Fuller on the present site of Potomac State College of West Virginia University. The fort's commanders included Majors Lew Wallace and Benjamin Harrison, the author of Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ and the 23rd President of the United States, respectively. The area changed hands 14 times during the war due to the importance of the railroad.Swick-Cruse, Deborah \\"Keyser.\\" e-WV: The West Virginia Encyclopedia. 31 May 2013. Web. 04 April 2017. https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1198 One history describes \\"four years of carnage\\" at New Creek ... everything was laid to waste. What buildings of importance had been built, many of which were equal to those of other towns in that day, were razed to the ground or reduced to ashes, by the relentless flames of the military incendiary.\\" The railroad that had been a blessing to the town had turned into a curse, drawing repeated assaults by Confederate forces. A Harrisonburg, Virginia, newspaper provided a report of the exploits at New Creek of a Confederate company known as the Brook's Gap Rifles, which had been stationed at Romney in the summer of 1861: > A part of the company -- 18 members, a detachment under command of Lieut. > Philip Kennon -- participated in the fight at New Creek Station, heretofore > known as Paddytown, on the Balt. & O. Railroad, in Hampshire county. In this > skirmish these sharp-shooters did first-rate work, private Black himself > killing three of the enemy with his rifle, and private John W. West giving > another a load of buckshot in the face. Black, who is a splendid equestrian > as well as a \\"deadshot,\\" charged up on the platform at the Station, riding > on 7 or 8 feet. The enemy then drived into a house in which our boys > peppered them, killing 5 or 6 with their deadly Minnie Rifles, which they > handle with terrible precision. Because of its geography, a relatively flat plain in a valley surrounded by mountains and open to many approaches, New Creek was an easy target for Confederates. One editor in Wheeling, West Virginia, opined that holding New Creek was useless, writing in 1863: > The concentration of troops at New Creek and the preparations there for > attack or siege, indicate that it is the intention of our military > authorities to hold that post against rebel investment ... New Creek ... > really protects nothing but the little valley which its guns command. It > cannot prevent the progress of the rebels into Pennsylvania or into Western > Virginia. ... We do not undertake to say what points could be made to > protect West irginia or Western Pennsylvania. We only express the opinion, > in which we are not alone, that New Creek is not one of them ... It is to be > hoped the folly of Winchester is not to be repeated at New Creek -- of > holding a useless and indefensible position, which if not in the enemy's > country now could easily be made so by their getting in its rear. Again and again, the Confederates raided New Creek. The little town was under constant siege. In January 1864, according to one report, a rebel force of 3,000 cavalry was headed in the direction of New Creek, and New Creek residents \\"were forbidden to exhibit lights\\" after dark. Complete disaster finally visited New Creek on November 28, 1864. At 1 p.m. on a Monday afternoon, between 1,500 and 2,000 Confederates attacked a small garrison of Union troops stationed behind earthworks at Fort Fuller. The Union troops were quickly overcome. The Confederates then took over the town, destroying the earthworks and nearly all the buildings, except the home of Colonel Edward Armstrong, whom they knew to be a Confederate officer. A smaller Confederate force was then sent to Piedmont, where they managed to burn the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's roundhouse, a workshop, and other machinery before they were turned away by Company A Sixth West Virginia Volunteers. The residents of New Creek were terrorized by the November 1864 occupation. Men were captured and taken away. One eyewitness complained of the rebels' behavior: > ... the chief thief among the rebels was a drunken, blear-eyed, pug nosed > Major Mason, son of Ex-Senator James M. Mason. This fellow searched and > robbed with his own hands eighteen or twenty citizen prisoners, taking > everything of value found upon their persons. Although thrice ordered by > General Rosser to send his prisoners to the front, he refused to obey until > he had finished his pocket picking. After leaving New Creek, the rebels put > the prisoners on the double-quick and ran them through the mud for about > three miles.

Likely because this northern half of Hampshire County had stronger pro-Union sentiments and Romney was often occupied by Confederates, the new West Virginia legislature moved the county seat from Romney to Piedmont, a few miles up the Potomac from New Creek, until the war ended. Following the war, the state legislature sent the Hampshire County seat back to Romney and split this northern half away to form Mineral County in 1866. Debate ensued over whether Piedmont or New Creek should be the county seat. At this time, a New Creek citizen named Colonel Edward McCarty Armstrong returned from the war, having fought for the Confederacy, and sold his holdings in and around the town to three Davis brothers from Piedmont: Henry Gassaway Davis, William Davis, and Colonel Thomas B. Davis. The Davis brothers set about making the most of their real estate investment, knowing its value would increase if New Creek became the county seat and a greater hub of activity. They donated a major plot of land to the county court for the construction of a courthouse. The court enthusiastically accepted, and New Creek became Mineral's county seat. Until then, the court met in an abandoned Union army hospital on the river bank. The stone courthouse was completed in 1868, was remodeled in 1896, and stands in use to this day.  Incorporation of Keyser  The courthouse question was not the only field of competition between Piedmont and New Creek, as the towns sought to develop in these post- war years. In 1874, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was looking for a place to set up division headquarters. Once again, the town of New Creek won out in the marketing war. The town's trump card was its willingness to change its name, having already gone from Paddy Town to Wind Lea to New Creek. Thus, on November 16, 1874, the town of Keyser was incorporated. William Keyser was then the first vice president of the railroad, living in nearby Garrett County, Maryland, and in charge of the headquarters location division. The honor was too much to resist. In addition to the headquarters, the renamed town of Keyser received repair shops and a roundhouse, lifting employment and economic activity. The town grew. New Creek would henceforth refer to an unincorporated community along the eponymous body of water just south of Keyser. The southern part of Keyser was known as South Keyser, a town unto itself. It would be combined with Keyser proper in 1913, when the state granted a charter to the City of Keyser. B&O; Railroad Yards at Keyser Early advertisement for land in Keyser, from the Cumberland Daily Times, April 23, 1875. The first mayor of Keyser was J.T. Hoke, elected unopposed with 127 votes on January 7, 1875.  The Great Railroad Strike of 1877  Keyser played an early and prominent role in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. That year, in the midst of a deep nationwide depression (\\"the Long Depression\\") that had caused extensive unemployment and hunger, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad cut its employees' wages by 10 percent. On July 16, trainmen in Martinsburg, West Virginia, were the first to take action, uncoupling a cattle train and announcing no more trains would run through until the wage cuts were restored. West Virginia Governor Henry M. Mathews sent militia under Colonel Charles J. Faulkner to restore order, but was unsuccessful largely due to militia sympathies with the workers.Bellesiles, Michael A. (2010). \\"1877: America's Year for Living Violently. The New Press, 2010. p 149. https://books.google.com/books?id=rf4q5LjLbHIC&pg;=PA149 Retrieved November 27, 2012. The strike spread up and down the line and eventually across the entire country. Within two days, workers in Keyser‚Äînotably both black and white‚Äîvoted to strike together, announcing: > Resolved, that we, the men of the Third Division, have soberly and calmly > considered the step we have taken, and declare that at the present state of > wages which the company have imposed upon us, we cannot live and provide our > wives and children with the necessities of life, and that we only ask for > wages that will enable us to provide such necessaries. The Boston Globe reported on July 18: \\"At Keyser a strike occurred this afternoon. The strikers threatened to shoot new men that take places on the road. No freight trains were sent from there.\\" On July 20, a train from Cumberland, Maryland, arrived in Keyser and was sent onto a side track, and strikers removed the crew with force. That same day, federal troops arrived in Keyser to try to break the strike. The Philadelphia Times reported of events in Keyser: \\"The second troop train has just arrived here. A few men are around the station, but all is quiet. The men are firm in their determination not to run out any trains, but they will hardly attempt to stop others, as there is abundant military force.\\" However, by July 30, some 25 freight trains had piled up in Keyser. That night a \\"misplaced switch\\" sent one of the trains off the tracks. The next day, under heavy military escort courtesy of U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes, trains began moving out of Keyser. The Baltimore Sun reported: > The troops at Keyser and Piedmont were deployed along the line of railroad > property, keeping the crowds back at a considerable distance. No one [not] > identified in the immediate employment of the company could pass the guard, > and even the most irrepressible reporters found it necessary to make the > most lengthy explanation of their privileges in order to pass the line. The > strikers being kept back by the military, there was not the slightest > interference with any of the trains ... The movement of the trains over this > division has caused quite a general break among the strikers, and they are > now constantly coming and asking to be set to work. Replacement workers were found, lured by Baltimore & Ohio vice president William Keyser's offer of fifty dollars for each strikebreaker. Meanwhile, any striker who approached the trains, now protected with military force, was immediately arrested. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad refused to rehire any of the leaders. And a manhunt was on in Keyser: > The authorities are endeavoring to detect the parties who threw the train > off the track last night but have no clue as yet. Sheriff Simms has offered > a reward of fifty dollars for the arrest of Joseph Lane, who escaped this > morning. Lane was a ringleader of the striking firemen.

Thomas Goff, as > striking fireman, who led the crowd was fined ten dollars and costs and > confined thirty days in jail, that being the extent of municipal authority. > The others were sent to jail til they pay the fines. After three days of intense fighting along the line, the strike was broken in Keyser, with traffic moving again on August 1, 1877. Company man William Keyser, after whom the town had just three years earlier named itself, held the line against the workers' demands. The wage cuts stood, but the strike spurred the burgeoning U.S. labor movement to begin organizing for both economic and political power, having seen the results when the state is in company hands‚Äîwith the full force of courts, military deployments, arrests and imprisonment employed against the strikers‚Äîall of which were on full display in Keyser. Across the Potomac from Keyser, in Westernport, Maryland, in the heat of the uprising, workers posted the following handbill, illustrating the desperation and militancy of the strike in this area:  Late 19th and early 20th centuries  Armstrong Street in Keyser, early 1900s. Keyser's growth accelerated in the 1880s, with the end of the Long Depression, through the turn of the century. The first high school opened in 1885. The first bank in town, the National Bank of Keyser, was chartered in 1886. A town water system was built in 1892, as was the first telephone line, connecting Keyser to Burlington, West Virginia. The Keyser Light and Power Company brought electricity to the town in 1895. A fire department, the Vigilant Reel and Hose Company No. 1, was organized in 1896. The Hoffman Hospital opened in 1904, as did the Preparatory School, which would later become Potomac State College. Both of these were located on Fort Hill, the site of Fort Fuller during the Civil War. A natural gas system powered street lamps and provided heating beginning in 1905. An ornate music hall opened for entertainment. In these years, a prominent citizen of Keyser was Thomas R. Carskadon. He had been a shareholder of the Keyser Land and Improvement Company that sold the plots that would become much of downtown Keyser. In 1888, Carskadon ran for governor of West Virginia on the Prohibition Party ticket. A newspaper article described his pro-temperance views as unpopular yet voters liked to listen to his \\"characteristic, sound, humorous, eloquent, and happy speeches, which held his audience spellbound to the close.\\" In 1900, Carskadon put his name in the mix for Vice President on the Prohibition ticket but failed to win the nomination at the national convention. Later that year, he ran again for Governor of West Virginia. The Potomac Worsted Woolen Mill in Keyser, 1908. The mill went through various owners and names through the years, including Patchett, Potomac, and Keyser Worsted. Queens Point is visible in the background. All of the aforementioned infrastructure improvements attracted more industry, and Keyser's private sector began to diversify beyond its sometimes problematic dominant employer, the Baltimore & Ohio. Besides the B&O;, railroad workers were now employed by the Western Maryland Railroad and the West Virginia Central Railroad, started by the Davis brothers and their in-law Senator Stephen Elkins in the 1880s. The Keyser Woolen Mills began operations in 1893. Rees' tannery operated on New Creek. In 1905, the Keyser Pottery Company began firing its kilns along the Potomac River, producing decorative and bathroom ceramics. In 1903, another woolen mill, specializing in worsted wool, was opened on the banks of the Potomac in the shadow of Queens Point. It was the women of Keyser who largely worked the machines here. A 1906 story reported: \\"A number of the girls employed at the Patchett Worsted Company are on a strike for higher wages this week.\\" In the early 1920s, the mill employed 200 workers, 175 of whom were women. In later years, sometime before 1946, the workers voted to join Textile Workers Union of America Local 1874, the same local that organized workers at the much larger Celanese plant near Cumberland. As Keyser's industry boomed, so did its population. The need for labor was ravenous. European immigrants made their way to Keyser. The largest group of foreign-born Keyser residents in this era was the Italians, followed by the Irish.Review of 1920 United States Census, Keyser, Mineral, West Virginia; Roll: T625_1964. In 1910, a single quarry operation near Keyser alone housed dozens of Italian men in its boarding facilities.1910 U.S. Federal Census, New Creek, Mineral, West Virginia, Roll T624 1690, Page 12A, Enumeration Dist. 0063, Image 785, FHL No. 1375703. News of jobs traveled through family and village networks. Many of the Italians settling in Keyser and nearby Piedmont therefore hailed from the same Calabrian village, Caulonia. A restrictive national immigration law enacted in 1924 had at least two significant effects on Keyser. First, while the town's population had more than doubled between 1900 and 1920, in the following decade the population leveled out, despite being the Roaring Twenties.See historical population chart on this page. Second, descendants of Keyser's Italian families have a disproportionate number of relatives in Adelaide, Australia. When the U.S. all but closed its gates to Italians in 1924, the village networks led Cauloniesi to emigrate to Adelaide. The same Italian family names found in Keyser and Piedmont can be found in this south Australian city. On February 3, 1913, the West Virginia legislature granted Keyser a charter designating it the \\"City of Keyser\\". The legislation consolidated Keyser with South Keyser and added further territory to the newly chartered city. Until this time, Keyser had functioned under a general law applicable to all municipalities in West Virginia. Its size now justified a special city charter from the state. The charter laid out Keyser's form of government as well. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, the patriotic fervor of Keyser nearly caused another change in the town's name. Because \\"Keyser\\" was pronounced like \\"Kaiser,\\" the title of the German leader, townsfolk began to tire of snide remarks from outsiders whenever they heard someone was from \\"Keyser\\". A campaign to change the name began in earnest. Proposals included Wilson (after the then-President), Pershing (after the then-general), Paddy Town (the original name), McPherson (a Civil War figure), and Fairfax-on-the-Potomac (harkening back to the original land grant). A Keyser soldier and local musician, Gene Cross, heard of the debate while enlisted and wrote a letter to the town newspaper that effectively ended the debate: > When the name Keyser appears before the mind's eye, all that we hold dear at > once confronts us: the old Potomac, New Creek valley, the old B&O;, Prep > Hill, hospital, and all the dear old memories that surround it, and the > greatest of all \\"Her People.\\" By robbing the town of that name, you rob her > of all these things to a certain extent, because when you think of the name, > all these things flash across one's mind ... There is lots of good work that > these people could use their spare time, energy, and brain power that needs > attention far more than this question. So for the sake of the boys who are > away from home and the ones who are going, let the old name stand. As we are > looking forward to the time when all this international trouble will have > passed away and we can come back to, not Wilson, Paddy Town, Pershing or any > other, but Keyser, our boyhood Keyser. In 1924, Keyser experienced its wettest year since 1889, and the Potomac River swelled over its banks twice in March. These massive floods brought widespread damage to homes and businesses in the north end of Keyser especially.  From Great Depression to Post-War Boom  Keyser's experience of the Great Depression in the 1930s was like any other small industrial city in the United States. Jobs were lost. Factories, like the Keyser Pottery Company, closed. Even the Baltimore & Ohio repair shops were closed for an entire year due to the slump, between 1932 and 1933. New Deal programs like the Works Progress Administration (WPA) generated jobs for the unemployed. \\"W.P.A.\\" stamps may still be seen on sidewalks constructed by this program in Keyser. The Depression lifted as World War II began. The war efforts helped. For example, in January 1942, one month after the declaration of war, an entrepreneur from Brooklyn bought the worsted woolen mill with an aim of filling army contracts and ramped up production and employment. After the war, Keyser experienced another boom in industry. When the woolen mill closed in 1948, moving its equipment to India, the community pulled together to lure a new business to take over the facility. When a firm expressed interest, four Keyser service clubs‚Äîthe Lions, Kiwanis, Rotary, and Yeoman‚Äîstarted a campaign to sell $100 notes to purchase the plant for the firm. They raised $60,000 in 24 hours in October 1952. California-based Pryne and Company was the beneficiary, taking over the plant to produce electric fans in Keyser. Pryne was later bought by Emerson, which moved the plant to Bennettsville, South Carolina, in 1965. The site was not empty for long. A new owner soon took over, Penn Ventilator, which produced louvers and ventilators for heating and air conditioning systems. During these baby boom years, Keyser also featured two clothing factories, the Keyser Garment Company and the So Rite Lingerie Company. Other manufacturing concerns included an Anchor Glass plant and the Flex-O-Lite mill, which produced Blastolite beads. In 1950, the Red Scare came to Keyser. That year, nearby Cumberland, Maryland, and Ridgeley, West Virginia, enacted ordinances requiring communists to register with the city. The Keyser American Legion post passed a motion for Keyser to do the same. The post commander said that several of his members said \\"they knew of Communists in Keyser and of Communist meetings.\\" At the time, the Cumberland ordinance was under legal challenge and was ruled unconstitutional a few months later, apparently causing the Keyser efforts to be abandoned. Following the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, Keyser schools began integrating in the 1955‚Äì56 school year. That fall, students between grades 7 and 12 were integrated. Mineral County's school board, however, said younger students could not be integrated yet due to lack of classroom space. African- American children up to grade 6 continued to attend a segregated red brick school called Lincoln School on Church Street in Keyser. They were integrated with white students within the next two years, when Lincoln School was renovated to house the Mineral County Board of Education in the late 1950s. Later, the building became the Keyser Senior Center at 30 Church Street. Sons of Italy dinner in Keyser circa 1950s. Seated at the head of table on right is Congressman Harley O. Staggers. The Sons of Italy was an important civic and social club for Keyser's Italian community. High employment and rising wages marked the 1950s and 1960s. Keyser's population peaked in the 1970 census.  Deindustrialization  Keyser's 20th Century economy relied heavily on manufacturing and the railroad. The economic crises of the 1970s and early 1980s hit the town hard. Plants in nearby cities where Keyser residents may have commuted took the early hits. Brewery, glass, textile, and tire plants in Cumberland, Maryland, especially began to close. The loss of income reverberated through the area economy, affecting retailers and other ancillary concerns. Globalization sent firms in search of cheap labor. By the 1980s, corporate raiders took their toll on employment, ultimately forcing the closure of a major tire plant, Kelly-Springfield, in Cumberland.

Many Keyser factories held on longer than the larger concerns in Cumberland, while reducing headcounts throughout this period. Eventually, however, one by one, they too began to close. In 1990, the Flex-O-Lite plant closed. The owners - the Lukens Company - claimed it was no longer profitable with high natural gas prices and \\"antiquated equipment.\\" Laid off workers represented by the Aluminum, Brick and Glass International Union protested outside the plant when the company offered only $100 in severance pay for each year of service. The Lukens Company made record- breaking profits that year, to the tune of $44.1 million. In 1995, both the Penn Ventilator and Anchor Glass plants closed. Many blamed this pair of closures on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect a year earlier. For Penn Ventilator, the company, like Lukens, blamed old equipment, saying it would cost $7 million to upgrade the plant and \\"there were no concessions the local union or management could have made that would make us competitive.\\" For Anchor Glass, the company cited the very same problem: upgrades would be too costly. Refusing to make the necessary capital investments, both companies shifted their operations elsewhere. In 1997, after a troubled attempt to save it through an employee stock ownership program, the Keyser Garment Company closed. While Keyser's fortunes often rose and fell with the national economy through the centuries, the town did not experience the 1990s economic boom in the same way as other parts of the country.  21st Century  Today Keyser's population has largely stabilized. Since losing much of its manufacturing base, the town has found employment via health care, education, and service jobs. Potomac State College has continued to develop and is associated with West Virginia University. A new modern hospital and high school were opened. With B&O; and its roundhouse and repair shops long gone, the railroad through Keyser is now operated by CSX. The Thomas R. Carskadon House and Mineral County Courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. It is situated in a valley on the south side of the North Branch of the Potomac River at its junction with New Creek. New Creek forms most of the eastern boundary of the town. On the immediate eastern bank of New Creek is New Creek Mountain, peaking at 1,552 feet above sea level on the eastern side of Keyser (though the long mountain itself has higher peaks far south of Keyser). On Keyser's western edge is the Allegheny Front, rising 2,631 feet above sea level at this point along its range. The northern edge of Keyser is bounded by the North Branch of the Potomac River. Immediately across the river, in McCoole, Maryland, another portion of the New Creek Mountain ridge features a massive outcropping of Oriskany or Ridgeley sandstone known as Queens Point, a popular cliff from which to take in views of Keyser. The cliff is approximately 400 feet above the river. The southern edge of Keyser is not bound by geology, as the valley here stretches further south than the city limits. Beyond its southern limits is the unincorporated community of New Creek. Today, Keyser's western horizon is dotted with wind turbines. The NedPower Mount Storm Wind Farm began construction in 2006, installing 132 wind turbines atop the Allegheny Front, many of them overlooking Keyser. Eventually, the wind farm reached 162 turbines, making it the largest east of the Mississippi. Keyser's oldest section is its downtown with the 1868 courthouse and two main commercial streets: Main and Armstrong. Armstrong runs parallel to the CSX (formerly B&O;) railroad tracks, across which is a neighborhood known as the North End, sandwiched between the tracks and the river, where homes were constructed beginning in the late 1910s. Not far from downtown is Fort Hill, a small hill in the center of the city crowned with the campus of Potomac State College. The south end of Keyser features a relatively newer neighborhood, on the west side of U.S. Route 220, with most of the homes built in the 1960s and 1970s, known as Airport Addition, as it was once the site of a small airfield. An area sandwiched between Airport Addition and Potomac State College is known as \\"Radical Hill,\\" which was the name of Thomas Carskadon's farm in the same location, so named by Carskadon because of his self-described radical opinions. The most recent commercial development for the city has been south of the city, where shopping centers, a hotel, the new high school, and the new hospital have been constructed in recent years. The main thoroughfares for the city are U.S. Route 220 and West Virginia Route 46. U.S. Route 220 eventually intersects with U.S. Route 50 south of Keyser. At its north end, 220 crosses the Potomac via newly reconstructed Memorial Bridge, heading toward Cumberland, Maryland. West Virginia Route 46 enters the east side of Keyser from the direction of Fort Ashby, West Virginia, becoming Armstrong Street and then West Piedmont Street before continuing on to Piedmont, West Virginia. Geology The type locality of the Silurian/Devonian Keyser Formation, a limestone, is located in a quarry and roadcut east of the town. Transportation US 220 southbound in Keyser Keyser is served by two primary highways. The most prominent of these is U.S. Route 220. From Keyser, US 220 heads north, crosses the North Branch Potomac River into Allegany County, Maryland, and continues to Cumberland and points north. Heading south, US 220 heads through Moorefield and Petersburg before crossing into Virginia. The other primary highway serving Keyser is West Virginia Route 46. From Keyser, WV 46 heads west to Piedmont and Elk Garden while to the east, WV 46 extends to Fort Ashby.  Government  Keyser's government is headed by a mayor and five-member city council. Each serves four-year, staggered terms. The mayor and two council members are elected at one election, with the remaining three council members elected two years later. Elections are held on the second Tuesday in June of even-numbered years. Originally, terms were only two years long, with staggered terms and elections held every June. Two of Keyser's longest serving mayors were John C. Freeland (1894-1967) and Irving T. Athey (1922-1997). Except for a two-year break in the 1950s due to a reelection defeat, Freeland served as mayor from 1937 until 1957. Athey was first elected in 1973 and had stints as mayor until health issues forced him to resign in 1990.  Economy  As of 2016, approximately 11% of Keyser workers were employed in manufacturing jobs in or around Keyser. Another 20% worked in health care or personal care and service. A little less than 20% worked in sales and food service. Some 17% worked in a combination of education, training, administrative, and social service. The remainder of the workforce was spread across trucking, management, maintenance and repair, and other industries. The poverty rate in Keyser was 27.4%. Its median household income was $28,378. The largest employers for Keyser residents include: * Orbital ATK, which operates Allegany Ballistics Laboratory in nearby Rocket Center, West Virginia, producing rocket motors, warheads, and fuses for the military, with more than 500 employees. * Potomac Valley Hospital, with more than 200 employees. * Wal-Mart Stores, with more than 200 employees. * Potomac State College of West Virginia University, with more than 100 employees. * Mineral County Board of Education, with more than 100 employees. * Heartland Employment Services, which operates a nursing home, with more than 100 employees. * Automated Packaging Systems, which manufactures bag packaging systems, with more than 100 employees. * West Virginia Department of Highways, with more than 100 employees. *Information Manufacturing Inc., with more than 100 employees. * Lumber and Things, which manufactures wooden pallets and skids, with more than 100 employees.

It is part of the 'Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area'. The population was 876 at the 2010 census. Piedmont was chartered in 1856 and the town is the subject of Colored People: A Memoir by Piedmont native Henry Louis Gates Jr.  Geography  As its name suggests, Piedmont is located at the base of a mountain, in this instance the foot of the Allegheny Front, the eastern edge of the Allegheny Mountains or Appalachian Plateau, on the south (West Virginia) side of the North Branch of the Potomac River. Piedmont is located at (39.480232, -79.048086). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land. Transportation Route 46 eastbound in Piedmont The only significant highway directly serving Piedmont is West Virginia Route 46. Route 46 continues west across the North Branch Potomac River into Westernport, Maryland. To the east, Route 46 heads to Keyser, where it has a junction with U.S. Route 220.  History  The Town of Piedmont is situated in the Allegheny Front mountain range along the North Branch of the Potomac River. A century prior to the chartering of Piedmont, the area was opened for European settlement with the creation of Hampshire County in 1754 by the colonial government in Virginia. The region was the scene of hostile interactions between European settlers and indigenous Native American cultures during the French and Indian War. Owing to its location and natural resources, the Piedmont area attracted German, Scotch-Irish, Swiss, English, and Italian immigrants, making the region more diverse than the primarily English-settled Hampshire County. These cultural differences within the county, as well as growing population in the years leading up to the Civil War would later contribute to the formation of a new county. The village of Piedmont was settled by people seeking to extract coal from the Allegheny Front mountain range which extends for several miles to the south of the town. Its strategic location at the intersection of George's Creek Valley, an industrial center in neighboring Maryland, made Piedmont a desirable location for a depot on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as it pushed west on its route to Wheeling and the Ohio River. The original main line of the B&O; railroad reached the site of Piedmont on July 21, 1851. Two years later in 1853, the railroad reached the Ohio River at Wheeling, connecting Baltimore, Maryland with a direct route leading to the rapidly-growing Northwest Territory states. The line through Piedmont remains a segment of the B&O; system, now part of CSX Transportation. With the arrival of the B&O; and the building of a roundhouse and rail yard, the Town of Piedmont was chartered in 1856. During the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), the town of Piedmont was frequently raided by the McNeill's Rangers in an effort by the Confederates to disrupt B&O; train service. Despite the interruption of the war, the region continued to develop new industrial and commercial institutions, leading to the creation of Mineral County in 1866 (separated from Hampshire County). Along with neighboring Grant County, these two new counties were the first created in the state of West Virginia which itself was separated from Virginia in 1863. In 1888, William Luke established the West Virginia Paper Company (now Verso Luke Mill) on of Maryland land known as West Piedmont (now Luke, Maryland, adjacent to the larger town of Westernport, Maryland), fueling further development of the region. Notable residents of Piedmont have included U.S. Senator Henry Gassaway Davis who worked as a storekeeper and railroad agent before opening the region's largest coal mines on the \\"Big Vein\\" on the Allegheny Front. Leslie Thrasher, a noted illustrator whose work was featured on the covers of Liberty magazine and the Saturday Evening Post was born in Piedmont on September 15, 1889. Jazz musician and composer Don Redman was born in Piedmont on July 29, 1900. Henry Louis Gates, a professor of African-American history at Harvard University, was raised in Piedmont, an experience he described in his 1994 book Colored People. Steve Whiteman, lead singer for the glam/rock band Kix was raised in Piedmont and graduated from Piedmont High School.

History The land on which the town is built was originally conveyed from Thomas Lord Fairfax to George Mason in 1749. In 1750, the first frontier fort, Fort Ohio, was built at Ridgeley.Callahan, J. (1923) The History of West Virginia Old and New, Volume I, Chapter VI. American Historical Society It was, at the time, the westernmost outpost of colonial civilization and was most commonly referred to as the \\"New Store\\" settlement at the time. The New Store was primarily a trading post created by the Ohio Company which included prominent members including George Mason and Lawrence Washington. Christopher Gist was in charge of construction of \\"New Store\\" Lowdermilk, W. (1878) History of Cumberland. DC: James Anglim, p. 30 which was just over what is now the Blue Bridge leading into Ridgeley from Cumberland. The settlement was used as a headquarters for traders and trappers from 1750 and 1763, and also served as a local fort outpost to shelter travelers or workers in the event of an Indian attack.Lowdermilk, 1878. Early Ohio Company residents who worked at the settlement (and who explored the surrounding countryside) included Hugh Parker and Christopher Gist. According to a history of the time, there were no white settlers in the area at this point. Lowdermilk's 1878 history reflects that at this point, the area was on the very outside of civilization; in fact, Lowdermilk refers to it as the \\"very outskirts of civilization. The country beyond was an unbroken and almost pathless wilderness. It was separated by many miles of tortuous mountain roads from the settlements in the east\\".Lowdermilk, W. 1878, p. 50. In May 1754, George Washington led a company of troops to meet Joshua Fry at the storehouses at Fort Ohio. Fry was a colonel and commander in the Virginia Militia. He was to take command of the forces sent to the frontier. Fry was thrown from his horse on the way to the fort and died. Washington's notes reflected that Fry was carefully tended to but died, and was buried \\"on the hill\\",Lowdermilk, 1878, p. 71. which is what the area around Fort Ohio (now Ridgeley) was referred to at that time. Washington then took command of the troops, his first military command. Washington staged an attack from Fort Ohio against a French detachment of 40 men that resulted in the death of French diplomat Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, who had been alleged to be a spy. De Jumonville's brother in law confronted Washington, who eventually signed a document asserting that he had \\"assassinated\\" du Jumonville. The document was in French, which Washington could not read; eventually Washington stated that he had signed the document to get himself and his troops safely released and out of the terrible weather. The killing of du Jumonville is considered to have been the first shot fired in the French and Indian War.National Park Service (2012) Jumonville Glen. http://www.nps.gov/fone/jumglen.htm In spring 1755, Washington returned to the area to prepare for General Edward Braddock's attack on Fort Duquesne (commonly referred to as Braddock's March). Fort Cumberland was under construction at the time, and was used as the center of planning for the attack, while Fort Ohio was commandeered and used as well. Both a young Daniel Boone (age 21) and Daniel Morgan (age 20) worked in the area to plan and carry out the ill-fated assault. When Fort Cumberland was all but abandoned in 1763, the Ohio Company reclaimed the land and put it up for sale. Eventually, the land was conveyed to James McCubbin Lingan in 1785, then to Captain George Calmes in 1803. Calmes built a mansion on the property. The land and home passed down through George Calmes' family through most of the 1800s. Late in that century, portions of the town began to be subdivided for housing and business use. In 1905, a group leased the Calmes Mansion and created the Potomac Club, which operated in Ridgeley as an important tennis and boating club until 1919. In 1887, the West Virginia Central and Pittsburg Railway built yards and tracks in Ridgeley. In 1904, the West Virginia Central became the Western Maryland Railroad. The town developed as a blue collar community, many of whose residents worked for the railroad. For most of its history, it had been called alternately \\"St. Clairsville\\" or \\"Sinclairsville,\\" but upon incorporation in 1914, it was renamed Ridgeley after Charles Ridgeley (1822‚Äì1897) a prominent early resident and businessman. The town grew throughout the early part of the 20th century to be a vibrant blue-collar community of schools, churches and businesses. Serious flooding from the Potomac River was a challenge to the town until the Army Corps of Engineers completed a major flood control project in the 1950s. During the 1970s and 1980s, as the Mineral County school system consolidated schools in the area, all the Town's schools were closed, challenging Ridgeley's cohesiveness as a community. In May 2013 Ridgeley mayor James L. Twigg was indicted on eight felony charges in connection with the alleged misuse of the city's purchasing card. He pleaded guilty that October to four misdemeanor counts of failing to perform his duties.

The population was 579 at the 2010 census. Delbarton was incorporated September 6, 1946, by the Mingo County Circuit Court. The name Delbarton comes from the New Jersey country estate of Luther Kountze a Wall Street financier and part owner of the United Thacker Land Company a large coal mining company. Currently a Catholic high school with the same moniker, the Delbarton School, is located on this site. The estate and town and school all derive their name from an amalgamation of syllables in the names of Kountze's three children (DELancey, BARclay and LivingsTON). Prior to being incorporated as a town Delbarton was a coal camp built and owned by the Thacker company. Thacker needed such camps soon after in 1909 acting for the company Luther Kountze arranged the purchase of thousands of acres in the area from Jane Hatfield a woman made widow earlier by the murder of her husband Ellison Hatfield in the famed Hatfield- McCoy Feud. Jane required money for herself and her children and sold cheap unaware of the fantastic mineral wealth she was losing out on. After this acquisition of land Delbarton was created for the needed miners who were recruited and brought in to work the soon to be opened coal mines. The town is located in the heart of the richest coal area of the state, The Williamson Coalfield. Poverty is endemic in the town of Delbarton as it is in Mingo County where it is located. 2018 US Census Bureau estimates put the residents living below the poverty line percentages at 36.5% for Delbarton and 28.7% for Mingo County. This compares to 17.8% for West Virginia and 15% for the USA over all. Economists attribute the most significant cause of this high level of poverty to be the drastic decline in the number of jobs in the local coal mining industry. The loss of such employment which has been going on for several decades is blamed on two things. The reduction in the amount of coal being extracted in the area and the ever increasing use of less labor intensive removal methods for what coal is still mined. Some commercial buildings in town no longer needed for their original purposes of retail or mining administration are now used to cater to the growing tourist industry.

The population was 3,191 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Mingo County, and is the county's largest and most populous city. Williamson is home to Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College. The Tug Fork River separates Williamson from South Williamson, Kentucky. Williamson is the site of a large rail yard built by the former Norfolk and Western Railroad (now Norfolk Southern Railway), which was built to service the many coal mines of the region. The city is protected by a floodwall, completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1991 in response to devastating floods along the Tug Fork River in 1977 and again in 1984. The wall incorporates floodgates along major access points which, when locked, form a solid barrier against floodwaters. There have only been two uses of the gates thus far: the first occurring in 2002 during a major flood in the region, and the second occurring in 2003, when only two lower lying gates were closed in anticipation of rising water levels. The local economy is largely fueled by coal mining, transportation, health care and retail. History Coal House in Williamson, West Virginia Williamson was incorporated in 1892. Most historians believe that Williamson was named in honor of Wallace J. Williamson. He owned the land where Williamson now stands, earned a fortune in real estate investments in the area, and founded the city's first bank and its first hotel. Others claim that the city was named for Wallace's father, Benjamin F. Williamson. He owned most of the land in the region before dividing it among his sons. Williamson grew rapidly once the railroad connected into the town. Its population, just 688 in 1900, jumped to 6,819 in 1920 and 9,410 in 1930.

The population was 565 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Monroe County. History Monroe County was established by an act of the Assembly of Virginia on January 14, 1799, occupying land formerly a part of Greenbrier County. Union did not yet exist when the county's first court convened in 1799. However, shortly after Monroe County was created, James Alexander offered 25 acres of land, including a lot for a courthouse which in time became the town of Union. On January 6, 1800, the Virginia Assembly passed an act creating the town of Union and naming William Haynes, John Gray, John Byrnside, James Handley, Michael Erskine, John Hutchinson, and Isaac Estill trustees. By 1810, at least sixteen lots had been sold in the newly laid out town of Union and a courthouse and jail were built at its center. In 1835, Union had 400 inhabitants and supported two hotels, two tanneries, a school, two churches, and two physicians. Union's location on stage coach lines which carried settlers across the Allegheny Mountains helped to fuel the region's growth, as did the several mineral spring resorts which operated in Monroe County, including Sweet Springs, Red Sulphur Springs, and Salt Sulphur Springs, all within a twenty-five mile radius of Union. Little activity during the American Civil War occurred around Union other than troop movements, especially in 1864 when regiments of the U.S. Army under General Crook encamped near the town. Small skirmishes occurred throughout the war in the vicinity of Union and Monroe County. A majority of the citizens of Union supported the Confederacy and opposed the creation of West Virginia which included Monroe County. Union was incorporated in 1868. The town of Union retains much of its historic architecture, with many structures dating to the antebellum period when the local economy was thriving from the resort industry. The present Monroe County Courthouse, built in 1881, displays the fashionable Romanesque style of the late-19th century. Historic churches in Union include the Old Baptist Church (1845), Old Methodist Episcopal Church/Ames Clair Hall (1857), All Saints Episcopal Church (1875), Union United Methodist Church (1889), and the Union Presbyterian Church (1922). The Monroe County Historical Society preserves several historic structures in the town, including the Caperton Law Office, Owen Neel House, Clark-Wisemen House, Ames Clair Hall, and the Old Baptist Church. In recognition of the history of Union and the integrity of its preserved streetscape, the Union Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. East of Union is Rehoboth Church, built in 1784 and believed to be the oldest Protestant church west of the Allegheny Mountains. Geography Union is located at (37.591211, -80.543022).

History The Samuel Taylor Suit Cottage overlooks the town and often is referred to as the \\"Berkeley Castle\\"; note the fall colors characteristic of the Appalachian mountains View of part of Berkeley Springs State Park During colonial times in 1748, George Washington, then just 16 years old, was part of the team that surveyed the Eastern Panhandle region for Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. Washington returned several times over the next several years with his half- brother, Lawrence, who was ill, in hopes that the warm springs might improve his health. The springs, and their rumored medicinal benefits, attracted numerous Native Americans as well as Europeans to the area. While vacationing in the area in 1767, Washington made note of how busy the colonial town had become. Lord Fairfax had built a summer home there and a \\"private bath\\" making the area a popular destination for Virginia's social elite. With the advent of independence, An act for establishing a town at the Warm Springs in the county of Berkeley was adopted by the Virginia General Assembly in December 1776. Officially, the town was named Bath, in honor of England's spa city of Bath. George Washington, his family members and several of the colonial elite were among the town's first landowners. The town's main north-south street was named Washington and the main east-west street was named Fairfax. Also, four acres were set aside for \\"suffering humanity.\\" The area around the springs always was public land known as The Grove and overseen by a state-appointed group of Beth Trustees. This would become a historic park with its springs and bathhouses, which was made part of the West Virginia state park system in 1925. Nearby, Cacapon State Park was opened in 1933. The mountain that gives its name to the park has an elevation of above sea level. Storage bins (no longer in use). At one time, they were used by the local sand mine for loading train cars for distribution. Bath's population increased during and immediately after, the Revolutionary War as wounded soldiers and others came to the area believing that the warm springs had medicinal qualities. Bath gained a reputation then as a somewhat wild town where eating, drinking, dancing, and gambling on the daily horse races were the order of the day. Chronology of names In 1772, the springs were part of the newly formed Berkeley County, named after its colonial governor, Norborne Berkeley. The waters became known as Berkeley Springs because the existing protocol was to name springs after the colonial Virginia county in which they were located. Previously, the area had been called Warm Springs and Medicinal Springs among other names. Bath became known permanently to the world as Berkeley Springs in 1802 when the Virginia postal system was established in the new nation and there already was a Bath, Virginia, in Bath County. In 1861, many residents of Virginia were opposed to Virginia's secession from the United States, some calling the act of secession treasonous. Following the Wheeling Conventions of 1861, a referendum was held in 41 mostly northwestern Virginia counties on whether to secede from Virginia and seek admission to the United States as a new state. An overwhelming majority of voters in these counties voted in favor of the proposal. The State of West Virginia was admitted to the United States on June 20, 1863. Berkeley Springs remained the conventional name used for the town. Its sister city is Bath, England.

The population was 508 in the 2010 census. The town is known for the nearby Paw Paw Tunnel. Paw Paw was incorporated by the Circuit Court of Morgan County on April 8, 1891 and named for the pawpaw, a wild fruit which grows in abundance throughout this region. Paw Paw is the westernmost incorporated community in Morgan County and the Hagerstown-Martinsburg, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. Paw Paw is located along the section of the Potomac River known as the Paw Paw Bends. The Paw Paw Valley is surrounded by the ridges of Sideling Hill, Green Ridge, Purslane Mountain and Town Hill. The town is the namesake of the Paw Paw Tunnel which was part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. Construction of the tunnel began in 1836 and was completed in 1850, 12 years behind schedule. Today, the tunnel and nearby canal are part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. Geography Paw Paw is located at (39.531140, -78.456920). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.  History  The earliest Native American habitation in the upper Potomac River Valley probably dates from 10,000 BC. In the 17th century, Europeans began arriving in increasing numbers. As European settlements gradually spread across western Virginia, the tribes were pushed from their villages and fields, which were then claimed and cultivated by the new settlers. In 1681, England‚Äôs King Charles II made the first land grants in what is now the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. The territory, which includes Morgan County, was eventually inherited by Thomas, sixth Lord Fairfax and became known as the Fairfax Land Grant. In 1746, Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs father Peter was part of the survey party that reached the source of the Potomac River and set down the landmark known as the Fairfax Stone, now part of the Fairfax Stone Historical Monument State Park. The following year, George Washington surveyed the region and later purchased land on the Paw Paw Bends, so named because of the way the Potomac River twists and turns for 31 miles between the towns of Paw Paw and Little Orleans. Washington described the land as being ‚ÄúIn the shape of a horseshoe, the river running almost around it‚Äîtwo hundred acres of rich low grounds with a great abundance of walnut trees.‚Äù By 1749, the Potomac River near present- day Paw Paw was being navigated by fur traders of the Ohio Company, while settlers were establishing farms on the surrounding land. In 1836, the C&O; Canal Company began work on a tunnel that was designed to eliminate seven miles of navigation on the river near Paw Paw. Two years later, construction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad began. Because of its proximity to both the railroad and the river, Paw Paw was considered a place of strategic importance during the American Civil War and was occupied by some 16,000 Union troops, most whom were quartered at Camp Chase (now Camp Hill), located east of Paw Paw, under the command of Brigadier General Frederick W. Lander. In 1868, J.B. Hoyt and Company of New York established a leather factory in Paw Paw, which provided hundreds of jobs until its closure in 1951.. Paw Paw also became well-known for its local orchards and fruit packing houses. The Morgan News reported in 1894 \\"Paw Paw at the present time is more beautiful than in any former time of her history. The streets are superb, plank pavements elegant and her street lights refulgent.\\" The streets were lit by oil lamps until 1926 when the Paw Paw Electric Company was awarded the franchise to bring electricity to the town. The first public school in Paw Paw started in the early 1870s in a building erected on the grounds of the tannery, but was washed away in the flood of 1877. Transportation WV 9 heading east out of Paw Paw The C&O; Canal and the B&O; Railroad both played important roles in the town's growth and prosperity. The Potomac River was dangerous and difficult to navigate, and the charter to build a canal to create a trade route with western settlements in Ohio and beyond was granted on May 17, 1785 to the Potowmack Company whose investors included George Washington. Three decades later, more than $729,000 had been spent on the project, but navigation on the river was still limited to only 45 days a year. The charter was taken over by the newly formed C&O; Canal Company in 1828. Construction on the Paw Paw Tunnel began in 1836 with a workforce comprised largely of English, Welsh, German and Irish laborers. Plagued by accidents, disease, worker riots, and financial woes, the tunnel finally opened in 1850. Six million bricks were used in its construction which required cutting through 3,118 feet through stratified shale with hand tools and black powder charges. A strike in 1922, a flood in 1924, and the decline in demand for coal, which was a major source of freight revenue for the canal, after World War I led to its closure in 1925. The B&O; Railroad began construction after the C&O; Canal but reached Cumberland, Maryland in 1842, eight years ahead of the canal. Railroad construction started in Paw Paw in 1838, and over the next half century, the town became an important focal point for trade, bringing jobs and prosperity to the region. In 1905, the Western Maryland Railroad was constructed north of Paw, and in 1914, the B&O; built a shortline through Paw Paw, with six local stops each day. The B&O; removed the main line track from Paw Paw in 1961, bringing regular passenger service in Paw Paw to an end. The Paw Paw railroad depot, which had opened in 1845 was permanently closed in 1961. In 1928, the first bridge was built over the Potomac River from Paw Paw into Maryland, enabling the completion of a road directly into Cumberland. Previously, a ferry was used to cross the river. Today, the primary highway into Paw Paw is West Virginia Route 9. WV 9 heads eastward to Berkeley Springs, the county seat, where it connects with U.S. Route 522. WV 9 also continues eastward from Berkeley Springs to Martinsburg. To the west, WV 9 crosses the Potomac River into Allegany County, Maryland, where it becomes Maryland Route 51. MD 51 continues westward to Cumberland, where it intersects Interstate 68 and U.S. Route 40.

In 2010, the census showed Richwood with a population of 2,051. During the 19th and early 20th century Richwood was a booming coal and lumber town. Richwood has a very rich history, including the formation of the Cherry River Navy civic organization to draw attention to issues important to the community. Richwood has also become known statewide as the \\"Ramp Capital of the World\\". Each year, in April, the city hosts a large festival that draws visitors from around the country.  History  The area surrounding the forks of the Cherry River has been populated since the late 1700s. During the 19th century, the area was a sparsely settled semi-wilderness of homesteads and subsistence farms. This changed in 1898 when a railroad was extended into the area, then known as Cherry Tree Bottoms. In 1901, the town was incorporated with its present name referencing the abundant hardwood forests in the area. Soon, the area possessed a large sawmill and the world's largest clothespin factory. The town was once home to several large businesses and industries. In addition to the sawmill and the clothespin factory, there were other factories that produced wood-based products such as axe-handles and paper. Coal also came into the industry picture during Richwood's boom-era during pre-Depression years. Banking was a white-collar industry that succeeded in the city with the large companies investing into the city's financial corporations. Once the large factories closed or relocated, many of the people followed. The final hit was when the coal industry took a downward turn and most of the local coal mines ceased operation. Richwood now seeks to be reborn as both an artisan community and a technology center. The Downtown Richwood Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Richwood is the headquarters of the Cherry River Navy community organization. It was founded by John Teets, A.B. Campbell, and Lee Reese to promote the construction of a since-built missing link in West Virginia Route 39 between Richwood and Marlinton.

Richwood, however, is still by default the political and economic center of eastern Nicholas County, as it is the only incorporated city in the immediate area. The city has a small shopping plaza which houses Rite Aid and Dollar General. There are efforts to attract visitors to the area for the natural environment of the adjacent Monongahela National Forest. The mayor welcomed attendees of the 2005 Rainbow Gathering that was held in the forest and took the opportunity to encourage craftspeople to buy property and set up businesses there.\\"Om on the range: The Rainbow Family welcomes itself back to Colorado\\", The Colorado Springs Independent, June 12, 2006. Richwood operates the small Richwood Municipal Airport, which is located in the nearby unincorporated community of New Hope. Local places of interest The Sterling Spencer Memorial Sculpture Garden replaced a dilapidated vacant hotel that had partially collapsed. The park is named in honor of a respected wood sculptor from Richwood. Richwood has a mountain setting with close proximity to Monongahela National Forest and access to a great number of recreational areas. Three tributaries of the Gauley River (Williams River, Cranberry River, and Cherry River) all flow wild within this portion of the forest. A scenic highway and visitors center also lie at the intersection of WV 39 and WV 150, which is close to the Cranberry Glades Botanical Area and the Cranberry Wilderness. The Cranberry Glades Botanical Area is the southernmost Canadian-style bog in the world. Summit Lake offers the only flat water recreation in the immediate area. Richwood is also home to Cherry Hill Country Club, a nine-hole golf course located on top of Hinkle Mountain. Education Three schools, operated by the Nicholas County Board of Education, serve Richwood students: Cherry River Elementary, Richwood Middle School, and Richwood High School. In 2005, the girls' high school softball team won the school its first team state championship in any sport. Due to flooding on June 23, 2016, both Richwood High School and Richwood Middle School have been temporarily relocated. , there is an ongoing debate regarding the replacement or consolidation of these schools. Healthcare Camden Family Health is the primary healthcare provider within Richwood. It operates a rural health clinic with a full staff including MD, FNP, and RN access. Summersville Regional Medical Center, located in the county seat, offers the nearest emergency room and hospital. Two hospitals were previously located in Richwood. McClung Hospital was open during the city's boom years in the early 1900s. Richwood Area Community Hospital, formerly known as Sacred Heart Hospital, operated from 1954 until June 2008, when it was forced to close due to poor finances. Emergency services The Richwood Volunteer Fire Department serves as Richwood's primary fire and rescue service. They hold an ISO Class rating of 4. They serve the community from their central station located in the middle of town, and provide fire and rescue services to Richwood and surrounding areas. Richwood Police Department is the city's primary police force. They serve the community from their office located in the municipal building. The Nicholas County Sheriff's Department and West Virginia State Police, which has a detachment located in the city, also provide police service as needed. Emergency medical services are provided by Redi-Care Ambulance. They are a private ambulance company with one station located in the east end of town. They typically house one ALS unit and one BLS unit at all times. Transportation Richwood's primary road is a two-lane highway carrying West Virginia Routes 39 and 55. These highways provide access to U.S. Route 19 to the west and U.S. Route 219 to the east. The original construction of the road portion from Marlinton to Richwood through the Monongahela National Forest was spuured by the Cherry River Navy civic organization, reducing what was a three-hour drive on indirect alternate routes to a current 45-minute drive. It is considered one of the most scenic drives in West Virginia, providing access to a number of National Forest recreation sites. In the town's early years, the railroad was a popular form of transporting wood, coal, and passengers in and out of Richwood on a daily basis. As time wore on, however, rail traffic decreased. By the early 1980s, trains had been completely replaced by road transportation in the area. The tracks were removed by the end of the decade and the old railroad grade was transformed into a gravel rail-trail for hiking and bicycling.

The population was 721 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Pendleton County. Franklin was established in 1794 and named for Francis Evick, an early settler. History The Town of Franklin is situated in the Allegheny Mountains on the eastern edge of the Monongahela National Forest and along the South Branch of the Potomac River. This region was populated by Native American cultures for centuries prior to the arrival of English immigrants in the mid-18th century. During the French and Indian War, conflict between the early settlers and Native American populations included two battles at frontier fortifications at Upper Tract and Fort Seybert in 1758, both ten miles distant from the future location of Franklin. The land on which Franklin was laid out was first patented by brothers Francis and George Evick in 1769. Main Street in downtown Franklin Pendleton County was divided from parts of August, Hardy, and Rockingham Counties (Virginia) by an act of the Virginia General Assembly in 1787. The earliest court sessions in the new county were held at the home of Captain Zeruiah Stratton near the present-day village of Ruddle until Francis Evick offered a part of his land to become a county seat around 1789. Additional lots were divided off of Evick's land to form the new town. On December 19, 1794, the Virginia General Assembly chartered the town of Franklin and recognized it as the seat of Pendleton County. Franklin grew steadily over the first half of the 19th century, becoming a local center of commerce and industry. In 1834, there were two stores, two tanneries, three saddlers, two carpenters, two shoemakers, two blacksmiths, one gunsmith, one tailor, one hat-maker, and one cabinet-maker listed among the town's residents. At the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Pendleton County voted to uphold Virginia's Ordinance of Secession, despite strong Union sympathies from many of its residents. Localized fighting occurred between northern and southern regiments throughout the war, but the only major battle to impact the Franklin area occurred in May 1862. Following the First Battle of Kernstown, Confederate Major General Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson initiated his Valley Campaign to draw attention of the Union Army away from its Peninsula Campaign nearing the Confederate capitol at Richmond. On May 8, 1862, Jackson clashed with Union regiments from West Virginia and Ohio under the command of Brigadier General Robert H. Milroy at the Battle of McDowell (some 30 miles from Franklin). After a day of fighting, the Union forces withdrew from the battle and began retreating towards Franklin, pursued by Jackson for nearly a week. The armies clashed briefly at McCoy's Mill (three miles south of Franklin, now a National Historic Site), but Jackson withdrew and returned to the Shenandoah Valley to continue his campaign. Franklin did not grow significantly in the years following the American Civil War until the early twentieth century. In 1917, the town's boundaries were expanded, the streets were macadamized, and public water and electricity were brought into the town. However, tragedy struck on April 17, 1924 when a massive fire destroyed the entire business district and caused $500,000.00 (~$6.5 million adjusted for present inflation) in damages. Most of the town's center, its commercial district, and the Pendleton County Courthouse were constructed following the 1924 fire. Another disaster struck the town in 1985. The South Branch of the Potomac River in Franklin crested at 22.6 feet during the 1985 Election day floods. Flood stage at the time in the shallow riverbed was only 7 feet.West Virginia Gazette: \\"Remembering the '85 floods\\" (D. White) 4 Nov 2010 Historic Sites in Franklin Bank of Franklin Much of the town was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Franklin Historic District in 1986. * Bank of Franklin (1925) Situated at the center of Franklin's commercial district, the Bank of Franklin building was constructed following the fire of 1924 to house one of Franklin's two banking institutions. The new building, constructed of brick, was designed in Neoclassical style inspired by the Beaux-Arts movement. The bank was closed after the passage of the Emergency Banking Act in 1933, along with the other two banks in Pendleton County. * Dr. Preston Boggs House (1900) Located on North Main Street, the Dr. Preston Boggs House was constructed around 1900 in an elaborate interpretation of Queen Anne Style. The house features an octagonal turret positioned on its northeast corner and multiple bay window projections. A wraparound porch on the first floor is surmounted by a smaller porch on the second floor centered on the front facade of the house. Dr. Preston Boggs House * Ernest Bowman House (1900) Neighboring the Dr. Preston Boggs House, the Ernest Bowman House is situated at the corner of Main Street and Dogwood Drive. Erected around 1900, the Ernest Bowman House also displays Queen Anne Style with projecting bays and ornate porches. The south facade of the house features a unique second story porch positioned overtop a bay window on the first floor. * Franklin Presbyterian Church (1922) The Presbyterian Church at Franklin was organized August 19, 1866 near the village of Upper Tract. The congregation first moved to Franklin in 1876 and erected a church across the street from the present edifice (today the Walnut Street United Methodist Church). Construction of the present structure began in 1918 but was delayed due to an influenza outbreak and was still partially completed when the fire of 1924 destroyed Franklin's commercial district (though leaving the new church untouched). The congregation sold its old building to the county for use as a temporary courthouse in 1924 and occupied the present building, which was designed by Stanholpe Johnson of Lexington, Virginia. The Franklin Presbyterian Church is an example of Gothic Revival style. Franklin Presbyterian Church * Franklin United Methodist Church (1881) Methodism in Pendleton County originated with the arrival of Rev. Ferdinand Lair in 1800. The congregation worshipped in Franklin's Union Church from 1809 until the construction of the present church in 1881, designed by H.H. Smally of Lilly, Virginia. Constructed of brick, Franklin United Methodist Church displays elements of Gothic Revival and Italianate design. * McCoy House (1848) Located on Main Street opposite the Pendleton County Courthouse, the McCoy House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Built by slave labor in 1848, the house was constructed for William McCoy, who served at various times as deputy sheriff of Pendleton County, a justice of the county court, and represented Pendleton County in the state legislature. The McCoy House is a two-story, brick \\"I-House\\" designed in Greek Revival Style with an Ionic portico. McCoy House * Pendleton County Courthouse (1925) Franklin was the site of three courthouses prior to the present edifice. A log structure was built in 1788 by Thomas Collett, which served the county for 28 years until a brick courthouse was built in 1816-17. A third, larger courthouse was erected in 1889 by Franklin resident John Add Crigler, which was destroyed by the fire of 1924. The court convened in the old Presbyterian Church (today the Walnut Street United Methodist Church) until the present, fourth courthouse was completed in 1925. Designed by the Snyder Brothers of Keyser, West Virginia, the new courthouse cost $62,577.00 to erect. The Pendleton County Courthouse is an example of Colonial Revival Style. The Ananias Pitsenbarger Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. The Priest Mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

History  Old Town of HillsboroHillsboro AcademyHillsboro was named for pioneer John (Richard) Hill, from North Carolina, who built a log cabin near what is now Lobelia. Most of the early settlers were Scots-Irish and worked in agriculture and stock raising. In the 1800s the town of Hillsboro centered on the educational institution Little Levels Academy. Established in 1842, the school closed 18 years later at the onset of the Civil War. In 1865, the county purchased the building and ran it as a public school through the 1880s, and it became a school of higher order for boys called Hillsboro Academy. The basement of the Methodist Church served as a school of high order for girls called Hillsboro College, or Little Levels Seminary. Eventually the brick Academy was torn down and replaced by a wood frame school for both boys and girls. Later the school was re-built in brick as Hillsboro High School.

New Englanders Marlin and Sewell built a cabin in what would become Marlinton, but after various religious disputes, Sewell moved into a nearby hollowed-out sycamore tree. In 1751, surveyor John Lewis discovered the pair. Sewell eventually settled on the eastern side of Sewell Mountain, near present-day Rainelle, WV. Located at Marlinton and listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the Frank and Anna Hunter House, IOOF Lodge Building, Marlinton Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Station, Marlinton Opera House, Pocahontas County Courthouse and Jail, and Pocahontas Times Print Shop.
